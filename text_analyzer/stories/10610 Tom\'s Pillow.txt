Tom's pillow part1







&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret was on the last year of college.After she'd get her degree in Social studies, she'd return to her hometown and her family until a job opportunity arose.She was walking home from another class that day.The sun glistening on her skin and her long brown hair, same color as her eyes.It was another day waiting at the bus stop.She dressed casually whengoing to campus,usually blue jeans and a t-shirt with some bands name on it.



She was one of those girls that didn't have to try too hard to look beautiful,her slim sillouete looked great in any kindof clothes and her breasts weren't big but certainly not small either.She was listening to music on her cellphone and didn't pay any&nbsp; attention to the man staring at her intensely from a few feet away.He wore a leather jacket and looked a little sleep-deprived.He was in his mid 30s,and a bit skinny.When Margaret turned her head towards him,he averted his eyes to the bus that had just arrived.







&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following days were hard for Margaret.College assignments had piled up and she fell to bed exhausted most of the nights.One night she had stayed up late to finish one of them."Dammit,run out of coffee!"She noticed."I'm going to collapse if i don't drink some."she thought and went down to the nearest 24/7 store to buy some.



It was dark but the street lights provided some light.It's not like she hadn't walked around this neighbourhood all the time.As she was making her way to the register,she saw through the store's window,on the sidewalk,a man's form.She kept moving but her eyes stayed on the strange man for another moment.She couldn't see him very well.but the way he stood like he was watching inside the store, creeped her out very much.Margaret paid for her coffee and,as she walked outside to take a better look at the man,she realized he was gone,almost like he had vanished.







&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next day began badly.After having spent the whole night studying,Margaret slept through her alarm clock's rings."SHIT!SHIT!SHIT!" she yelled at herself for missing the first class as she was getting dressed as quickly as possible.After a tough day she returned home in the afternoon,fell like a sack of potatoes on her couch and turned on the T.V.



After about an hour and a half of mindlessly browsing through the endless sitcoms and chat shows,it was time for bed.As she she headed toward her bedroom, she heard a ring at the door."Weird",she thought to herself.She usually knew in advance if any of her friends would drop over at her place.She opened the door slowly,and saw the same man she had seen the day before.He was smiling but there was something unnerving about him.Surprised,but still polite,she asked."Can i help you?"The man introduced himself.



"Hi,my name is Tom,we just moved in the apartment next to yours with my wife and i thought i come and say hello to my new neighboor."Margaret relaxed.The apartment next door was empty the last 6 months.They must be the new occupants."Welcome then!My name is Margaret.Please come in".



She was always friendly and hospitable when meeting new people.Tom walked inside.As Margaret turned her back on him to close the door he took out a soaked rag and pressed it on her face,holding her head tightly to his chest with one hand,and her one hand from removing the rag with his other.She tried to scream but the rag was over her mouth,muffling her attempts at calling for help.She panickly inhaled quickly,and the fumes from the rag got to their work.In a few seconds,her moanings subsided and she went limp on Tom's hands.







November 15 2014



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Margaret woke up her head was feeling like it weighed over 100 pounds.The pain was there along with a weird numbness that spread on her whole body.The small room she was in was dark and almost empty.She was lying naked down a surgical table,and an oxygen mask had been put on her face.



She heard the beeping sounds of a cardiograph.After 2 or 3 seconds that seemed like hours,she opened her eyes.What she saw made her shriek to the red ballgag that was also strapped in her mouth.Both her legs and arms were missing!Where her pelvis ended were now only two big patches.Same with her arms,that had been amputated at the end of her shoulders.She begun breathing heavily and her heart rate increased rapidly.



Without limbs she was unable to move herself in any way&nbsp; besides wiggling in place and that increased her panicked state.Just then,a shadow immerged from her side.Tom injected a drug into the serum that was connected to a needle on her neck and Margaret slipped back into unconsiousness.







&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tom was sitting next to her when she woke up the second time.He was running his finger around her cute breasts and her soft belly,and the prettiest belly button he had ever seen.He had admired it many times before,that past summer,when she wore those shirts that end just above it.He had watched her on the beach one time too,walking across the sand on a hot bikini.But now,she was finally his.



"i had to put you out again for your own safety",he said like he was apologizing,when he saw her wake up.



"Your heart rate cannot be too high so close after the operation."She turned her look to him.It was clear she wanted to launch at him,to kill him for what he had done to her,but due to her last struggle and the additional medication,she was very weak now.Her hateful look turned into one of despair and her eyes started watering.She sobbed into her gag, realizing the true magnitude of her predicament."I know it's hard for you right now,but i promise you you'll get used to this.You're mine now and that's not going to change,ever.

The faster you come to terms with this the better."



He talked slowly and calmly.She looked at him in disbelief,but kept sobbing and crying,her moans now the only sound in the small room,except from the constantly beeping cardiograph.







&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next days the oxygen mask was removed and so was the serum that basically fed her till then. Feeding her was the toughest part.Tom tried to be patient but after the third time of spitting in his face and angrily swearing curses at him,he had to find a better and quieter way.He found a medical plastic tube,just like the ones they used for stomach evacuation.He took the ball gag and made a hole at its center,then squeezed the tube through it.



"Please,don't do this.I'll be quiet i swear.."Margaret begged him,but there wasn't much she could do as Tom pushed it down her throat and secured the gag tightly in place.Margaret regretted her behavior in the next days.Not only was the feeling of being force-fed horrible and humiliating,she also lost the opportunity to negotiate with her captor a way she could let her go,because there was no reason for her gag to be removed now.



But the worst of all was offcourse the fact that her limbs were gone.She couldn't even slither like a worm or a snake,just stood on that uncomfortable table,in that same room,watching Tom enter every once in a while and feed her or remove her peeing bag.She felt so humiliated and helpless,thinking that even if someone managed to find her,she would never return to her old life.She felt like less like a human and more as some of sort of lesser animal or thing.She would cry herself to sleep every night,hoping next day she would wake up and all this would a horrible dream.







November 18 2014



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was night time,but Margaret didn't know it.Her "room" had no windows to and the door was always locked.She was looking up at the ceiling,lost in her own mind,trying to think of how long she must have been there and if her friends or family had contacted the police by now.Tom walked in the room and walked towards her.She stared at him,afraid of what he might do.He had already fed her twice today,so she didn't know the reason for his presence.



He checked the patches on her wounds and a big smile formed on his face."They have healed faster than i expected!" he said but in a way that showed he was more talking to himself than Margaret.He slowly removed them and Margaret so a scar where her hand used to be.It was big,but not deep.It had take the color of her skin and that pleased Tom even more.She saw him remove all the patches,then her "feeding gag" as he called it.



She started screaming for help as loud as she could,allthough her throat was sore from the tube and her voice came out croaky and weak.He went on a nearby drawer and took another type of gag.This one was all black and had a phallus about 5 inches long attached to it.Margaret was so intent on making the best out of her chance to call for help,she didn't notice Tom walk behind her jam the gag inside her mouth.She was taken by surprise and started choking and gagging on the phallus that pressed against her throat.Tom pushed it until he heard the gag getting hooked under her teeth.The mechanism kept her jaw wide open at all times and added another cause of discomfort.



"If you relax and breath normally you'll have no problem",he advised her.She calmed down a bit and tried to plead to him to remove it.The moan that escaped was much quieter than the previous ones,as her mouth was practically filled with the rubber intruder.



Then Tom did something he had never done before.He picked her up in his arms and head towards the door.Her instinct told her to struggle,to try to avoid what was happening or what was going to happen to her,but after a few seconds she stopped.It was pointless.He held her like a big baby in his arms without any problem as he walked outside the room.



Tom's house wasn't very big.It was a 2 room apartment with a hallway between the rooms.Margaret looked at it and thought that,maybe she wasn't so far from her own home.Tom walked inside his bedroom,where a single size bed stood next to a small desk with a laptop on it.Tom placed her on the bed and started unzipping his pants.Margaret started sobbing at the thought of what would happen but she started gagging again and tried to stop.



"That's where you'll place in the house will be.You'll be my own live pillow,so it's only fitting."he sat on the side of the bed and picked her up,holding her at her waist,she jerked her head left and right,to signal her discomfort,but he steadily lowered her on his hard dick.Margaret screamed as he penetrated her violently.He used her waist to force her up and down and came quickly.He then removed the phallus from her gag,and rotated her upside down.Once he lead her gaping mouth towards his cock,she couldn't do anything to prevend Tom from sliding her up and down.He occasionaly just held her vertically,and let gravity force her deep into him.Margaret had never deepthroated anyone,much less upside down.She choked and almost fainted from suffocating.



When he finished he put the gag back on.She still felt his seed on her tongue and now the gag made sure the taste would stay there.Her privates hurt from theabuse and she wanted to die from her misery.He placed her sideaways on the top of the bed and said to her."This is the last time i'll be talking to you.You are my pillow after all and it would be stupid to address objects.I just want you to understand that this will be your life from now on,so come to peace with it."



Margaret looked blankly at space,but his words rang in her ears like a death sentence or worse.This was certainly worse,she thought.He flipped the light switch off and fell asleep immediately,with a smile on his face,clutching his new pillow in his arms while a barely audible cry was all that could be heard in the room. 











May 4 2015



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a warm sunny day outside.The cicadas were buzzing cheerfully.Tom's half open shades let some sun rays

through his bedroom window.She woke up first as was usually the case,feeling Tom's saliva on her skin.It took

a while for her to get used to the weight of his head against her soft belly.But Tom was a real drooler in his

sleep,and everyday she would wake up(whenever she managed to fall asleep) with a soaked belly or breasts.Margaret had gotten used to that too,eventually.



It was part of her life,now.It was a horrific one,from every view possible,but humans have a quality to adjust 

to every situation,even more so if that situation is unchangeable.Tom's attitude towards her played a great role

in her mental conditioning.Her muffled protests during the first months were never met with replies or threats.

A harsh pinch on her nipples or two fingers over her nose sent the message quicker than any words could.She was

totally under Tom's control and coming to terms with it just meant fewer suffering.



Now she didn't even tried to talk whenever he removed the black gag in order to force-feed her with the red one.

It all seemed so pointless now.No one would ever rescue her now,after so many months.Especially since they had

already come to Tom's house asking for information.She tried to forget about that day,the thought of it alone,made her heart sink.







&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a Monday,she remembered it because Tom had left the radio in his room open.He had just used her once

more and was now making dinner when a knock on the door was heard.Tom never had guests over and Margaret had

noticed.She started screaming at the top of her lungs and struggle as much as she could.Tom looked throught the

eye-hole on his door and saw two police officers waiting."Just a minute!" he yelled nervously and went to the

bedroom.he picked up Margaret and held her against his torso with a hand.He opened the closet where he kept his

laundry and placed her inside the wooden basket.He threw a bunch of clothes over her too,to silence her even more and closed the closet.He opened the door trying to look as relaxed as possible.



"Hello.We were wondering if you could help us with a missing person.She lives a few blocks away."Said the

policeman.The other one showed him the picture of a girl.She had brown eyes and brown hair and her smile 

made her even more beautiful than she already was.



"No i don't think i've ever seen her."said Tom.Margaret's screams couldn't reach the mens ears but she didn't

know that.She could her them talking pretty well and the fact that she knew she was so close to freedom made

her even more miserable.She couldn't get enough leverage to knock the basket she was in down.The clothes that

covered her made breathing more difficult to,and thus she got tired quickly.



"Are you sure?" said the man,who also looked tired."Yes",Tom simply said."I'll be sure to inform you if i see

her anywhere though"The two police officers thanked him for his time and left.







&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other than that no one had visited Tom.He spend mornings away at work,then return at midday and stayed home

until the next morning.He usually left her on his bed while he was away,but just to be sure she wouldn't alert

anyone,he would cover her eyes with a blindfold.That way,even if she could manage to move,she would be unable to 

find help.Those four-five hours every day drove her to the brink of madness.She laid there,without any visual stimuli,her mind the only company she had.



And it was a bad company at that.She couldn't doze off that easily and forget about her past,that she was a 

person,with friends,family and a life of her own.These thoughts would only hurt her now,and therefore she didn't

want them anymore.When Tom returned he would usually feed her for the day,mostly a creamy mix he had made 

himself,consisting of dog food and any leftovers he might had,all mashed in a blender.He sometimes added his piss orsperm in the mix,especially when he the portion wasn't enough.Margaret had realized that the food would sometimesknock her out,in order for Tom to clean her and brush her teeth,although a lot of times he liked to take baths with his 'pillow' and clean her then.



As with everything,she had no choice.She couldn't starve herself to death,because of the tube that was forcefully pushed down her throat,and she couldn't injure herself fatally,as Tom had removed any sharp objects or furniture from his room.Sometimes she wished he would just get tired of her and just end her misery.But after a few weeks,she wasn't even that high of a maintenance.She was truly as important to him,as a furniture or a device you own.An object to make him ejaculate and a pillow to cuddle with its smooth and soft material.







&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he was bored he would often play with her,although she didn't consider whatever was happening at those times "play".He loved to torture her sensitive nipples.he would stick clothe pins on them and watch her moan in pain.After a few times,he would get bored again and added more pins in more places of her butchered body.Her clit,her ears,the inside of her thighs,her armpits.He'd look at her eyes pleading him for mercy,as she knew that trying to talk would grand her even greater suffering.When those pretty brown eyes started welling up,he knew she had reach her limit.



That didn't mean he stopped though.A lot of times when he was taking a bath with her,he would hold her underwater for increasing periods of time.He enjoyed her squirming but that also increased her breath-holding ability,which came in handy whenever she deepthroated him.



He liked her long brown hair and that's why he hadn't cut them off.He used them to secure Margaret,usually on his bedpost or wherever she could slide off.Once he tied them to cealing fan and watched her swing back and forth.It was so cute!Tom really liked cuddling with his pillow in front of the T.V.Her soft flawless skin and her warm body felt great against him.Those times he blindfolded her."Objects don't watch T.V" he had thought to himself.Still,Margaret enjoyed the sounds coming from it.It distracted her from her situation and her thoughts and she remained rather peaceful at those times.







January 19 2016



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret turned 24 that day.Offcourse,she didn't know that.Days and weeks flew by and whatever semblance of time she had came from a rare glimpse on the weather outside,or most importantly,the heat inside the house.She had gotten used to being naked and rarely got cold.On the summer though,Tom was getting hot by her warm belly,so he often layed his head on her breasts and her curvy butt.



More importantly,Margaret had started to forget.People's faces,facts about her past life,most of it was a blur 

now,like a weird dream.That encouraged her mental deterioration.It wasn't obvious really,she didn't had to do any actual mental task.But it showed on the way she was with Tom.She never fought back or protest anymore.She never struggled when he force-fed her,even when she tasted his bodily fluids.She didn't complain when he tortured her for his amusement.More notably,she lately had started to seek sexual release from her time with Tom.During the first year,Tom's sexual urges were something she just had to carry through.At best,she tried to make him finish quickly,so he would leave her alone.



But now,all her inhibitions had been thrown away.She would often try to entice Tom by wiggling her hips and offering him her holes.Being fucked was the only think she could enjoy in her life now,so she tried to take advantage of it.Tom had noticed that,although he didn't care much either way.He used her holes just like before,and was happy that he didn't need to hold her in place so much,as she was willingly bouncing on his penis.



But when her saw her manage to orgasm in two different occasions,an idea entered his mind.He returned home one day holding a plastic bag and went straight to his bedroom.He took out an 8 inch dildo,a remote control and a metal belt that went through the legs and had a holder just beneath the crotch area.Margaret looked at it afraid but also hopeful that she would have some long awaited release.Without saying a word,Tom placed the dildo on the belts holder,the strapped the belt tightly above Margaret's pelvis.she found it uncomfortable,both the metal pressing against her waist and the big dildo that was placed inside her without a drop of lubrication.



Tom pressed a button on the remote control,and she felt a strong buzzing sensation inside her.It felt good,it felt really good!A moan escaped her as she tried to get every corner of her insides touched by moving around as much as she could.Tom laughed at the sight and then clicked another button.The vibrator continued buzzing but it wasn't as powerful as before.Margaret looked at him confused."Why he would lower the setting?"she thought.A smirk emerged on Tom's face and he left the room,closing the door behind him.







&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10 hours had passed since her belt was put on.Margaret was losing her mind at this point.She felt like her own body taunted her.Aroused for so long but unable to orgasm,no matter how much she tried.She had been sweating 

profusely and had dehydrated a lot.The inviting pressure on her pussy walls was now a painful,neverending tease.

He had found a new way to torment her.When Tom entered the room it was almost midnight.She looked at him with the same pleading eyes and yelled through the penis-gag that nested inside her mouth.She had forgotten she couldn't do that."Oh..not again" mumbled Tom and pinched her nipples so hard Margaret thought he would snap them off.She whimpered in pain and then stayed quiet,regretful for her action.



Tom watched her for a few seconds that seemed like hours to her,and then removed her belt.He picked her up and

lowered her towards his erect cock.He stopped at the point where the tip came in contact with Margaret's wet orifice.She jerked in his hands,trying to rub herself on there.Tom laughed again and instead,placed her on the bed next to him.He removed the phallus from her mouth and for the first time in a long time talked to her."You have to make me cum if you want me to fuck you."



He laid sideways on the bed,his now semi-hard penis pointing towards her.She tried to crawl towards,even though

she had learned very well,that just her shoulders and her hips didn't provide much traction.He watched her edge her way,little by little,until she finally reached his member.She put her gaping mouth around it and started moving her head back and forth,sucking and licking like it was the biggest test of her life.She had done that before but not like this,for the first time it meant something,there was a goal for her.



After 15 minutes of experiencing the best blowjob in his life,Tom ejaculated inside her thoat.She swallowed it

obediently like every time he had finished there.She had experienced very well how much Tom liked that.She would

not ruin her opportunity at an orgasm after all that torture.She was praying that he wasn't tired now.He usually fucked her twice every time,except if he was tired,he'd fall asleep after a single and fast pump.



Thankfully for her,after he put her gag back on,Tom picked her up again.This time he thrusted her down his again throbbing penis.She was a bit numb from the torturing vibrator but so worked up it didn't matter at all.She needed him more than ever,she needed his dick more than anything.He increased his speed and so did Margaret's breathing.Every push against her cunt produced a moan,and the rythmic melody of it all accelerated...until Margaret came hard,squirting a bit on Tom's legs.Her muscles twitched and any sound stopped,then she exhaled relieved.







August 22 2016



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She wore the belt everyday from then on.Tom started watering her once a day,in addition to her meals.It was necessary to keep her skin alive and beautiful,otherwise the everyday torment of the belt would suck all the "juice" from her young body.



Margaret hated the belt more than anything,and that subsequently nurtured a new hate towards her owner.Tom bought new batteries every week,to make sure she would wear it 24 hours a day,all the time.Being in a constant state of arousal was a nightmare for her.Unlike her shorter previous torments,this one was something she could not ignore,and that frustration was messing with her mind.



Sex was all she could think of and all she thought of.Now,she wanted Tom to cuddle her,to hold her in his arms so that maybe,just maybe,she could reach over that impeccable hurdle.Tom sometimes teased her himself,rubbing her erect nipples and grabbing her ass,massaging her ass hole or simply sliding his fingers up and down her belly.She sometimes would seem to be close to achieving her desire,but then,with just a cruel click of the remote,he would lower the setting even more,prevending his living toy from cumming.



The look she gave him everytime he did that was priceless.It showed her desperation,seeing how she was so close and yet not orgasming,followed by disapointment,knowing that she wasn't gonna be allowed and there was nothing she could do about it,as she was not allowed to talk back or,try to anyway.



Her blindfolded hours were now even worse.Having her sight taken away,it was even harder to distract herself from the buzzing invader.Her mind was feeding on sexual imagery,as a reflex to her neverending arousal.She wasn't the person she knew she was.Her mind had cleared most of her old memories.She tried to remember her parents faces.Their image was blurry and unfocused.She was drifting away from her humanity and there was nothing she could do to stop it.She had been turned into a sex object and her mind craved one thing...



Tom.the only one who could release her from her misery,even for only a few minutes,even if HE was the one that caused all this to her.It didn't matter anymore.Her rational brain had stopped being in charge.

&nbsp; 

 









Tom's pillow part 3







October 25 2017



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Margaret. My name is Margaret. I am a human being, i have a sense of self and i have a right to live with dignity and respect.... Nooo, just let go of that, just try to focus on taking that buzzing dildo out of your head for a while.... but i must otherwise... OTHERWISE what? You are trapped in this house for years. What's gonna change? who's gonna save you now?.. god this stupid thing is killing me!"



This dialogue with herself occured everyday during those times. She had started to go insane from the endless 

teasing of her permanent belt and the sensory deprivation she experienced. Tom now left the blindfold on and would often forget to take it off for days. He once liked to look at her sad eyes, that had turned into lustful

ones since the day the belt went on. But he didn't care anymore. He had started caring about other things, though.



He was living the house at night, something he had never done before with her around. After all this time, he knew he was safe to do that. Nobody would find him now and Margaret had no chance of escaping like this. He'd leave her all plugged in her own darkness, usually with her nipples painfully pinned and when he returned late at night,he would give her her "reward" for her suffering. After his night outs he was often more or less drunk so he lasted only for four-five minutes before falling asleep completely drained.



She had learned that and tried her best to get her orgasm as quickly as possible, before he was done. But sometimes she wasn't able and she'd have to return to her only peace of clothing unsatisfied, whimpering that she didn't get the only pleasure that the day held for her.



Now, whenever he fucked her, it was a treat. The more the better. Two times a day was great. Three,amazing! After all these years, she instinctively knew every detail about Tom. The way he thrusted when he was close to ejaculate,the violent groping he did when he wasn't that hard. She knew his penis like no woman could ever know something. Every vein on his shaft, every hair on his pubic area, every wrinkle on his balls. She knew them, or at least she felt like she did.







&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But her craving for sexual release was also what would doom her ego. Wanting to be used, by her captor, wanting to be constantly fucked by the man that had cut off her limbs and imprisoned her in this state. That wasn't something her former self, Margaret, would just let happen, and whether or not she wanted that was irrelavant.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tom enjoyed the attention he got. Even though she couldn't express it verbally, her body did the talking just fine. He especially liked whenever he would go to remove her belt, while she was blindfolded. The moment she would realize what was happening was so cute to him. She'd start moaning in lust and try to crawl towards the direction of his hands, in vain offcourse.



He also liked addressing her occasionaly,as it gave him the chance to play with her more and also break her mentally, faster. "If you do a good blowjob, i won't piss on your meal today" or "how many times i cum is how many hours you can spend without the belt" were a few simple motivators. It didn't matter that Tom could force her down his dick however and whenever he wanted. It was the fact that SHE wanted to please him and she would do everything in her minimal power to do so.







&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tom had started playing with her hearing too. Taking away one more sense from his toy made her feel even more dependent on him. The canal-type earphones he put in her ears were taped in place over them, so she couldn't remove them by jerking her head. Margaret kept discovering new ways that a person could suffer, just as she was starting to accept her belt as her inevitable way of going through the day.



The clarity that was left inside her mind was being destroyed by the sounds that violated her every day. These sounds ranged from disturbingly loud white noise to relaxing sea sounds, depending on whether or not Tom was satisfied with her. Sometimes, he just tortured her for no apparent reason. Looping sound clips from hardcore pornography on the mp3 player he had neatly taped on her left side. The volume was turned up to max and she was left to suffer for hours.



Unable to concentrate even on her own thoughts, Margaret's mind gave up. She didn't note the exact moment it happened, how could she,anyway? It wasn't important though. What was important was that She was no longer Margaret, not just in her captor's eyes, but in hers as well. The sweet, kind girl that wanted to become a teacher, that had two best friends named Elisa and Sarah, that always separated her rice from her beans.



She was just Tom's living sex toy, his pillow, something he killed time with. The dialogue that used to take place in her head didn't happen. But the answer had already been given.







March 15 2018





Tom was taking a bath with her after a while. She felt him pick her up after six hours (or was it sixteen?) of the usual sensory deprivation.He placed her on the bathroom sink. He took off the music player and the earphones. Then he unlocked her belt with a loud click and slowly removed the drenched dildo from her over-sensitive hole. To her surprise, he also removed the blindfold. "I think i need to clean that,too." He murmured as he stepped in the warm water with his flesh pillow in his hands. She blinked repeatedly before being able to open her eyes to the bathroom's light. The water felt great on her skin. Her crotch was resting on Tom's thigh. She started stroking her crotch along his skin, too show him she wanted him .He didn't react and she stopped her efforts. But she kept looking up at him with a strange look of affection and submission, her eyes missing that spark they radiated in the first years. She then laid her head on his chest and relaxed,enjoying the water again.



Tom was pretty certain he had broken her as much as he could, but he was curious. That curiosity led him to do something he had never done to his toy while she was conscious. He reached behind her head and unbuckled the gag that filled her mouth. He did it slowly, just so he could put it back quickly in case his toy started screaming.



But she didn't.She was baffled by what was happening,because if Tom wanted to fuck her mouth, he would just take the phallus of her gag, and leave the ring on, so he would have unlimited access to her throat. Tom sat there silent, to see how she would react. She tried to close her jaw, but found out it was impossible, at least fully.

She looked at him again, and he did the same. He felt a small sound fighting its way up her sore throat and rusty vocal chords. It was more a croaky,breathy attempt than any actual words.



Tom instictively pinched her right nipple with his right hand, not hard, but enough to issue a warning to her. To his surprise, she stopped and stood there, silent, still looking at him with an expression that showed she knew her position very well. Tom was delighted on the inside, but tried not to show it too much. Then his toy began licking and kissing his neck. Tom was stunned. She did everything possible to please him. He knew that now and that made him feel amazing! He sat and watched her try to tease him for a few seconds, before finally granding her wish. She tried to stay silent as waves of pleasure hit her with every thrust, but it was impossible after a while. She was looking at him straight in the eyes, like someone would do if they were making love. He then penetrated her ass, something he rarely did. Four years ago, Margaret would have to be in love with someone to even consider letting him back there. Now, she enjoyed the feeling immensely. As he picked up the pace, she came hard, followed a few seconds later by him. 







May 7 2021



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tom was sitting on the couch in front of his T.V. Alone. Another boring football match, another news segment. The world keeps going on.For him that is..



Tom had gotten bored of his toy.Its once perfect glistening skin had started showing signs of time. It was still beautiful as any girl would want but for Tom, the best years had gone by. The everyday routine of its subsistence was becoming tiring, too, even though nothing had really changed. Sure, after the toy's mental conditioning had reached its peak, Tom was very active with his pillow for a good while, happy that he had succeeded completely in turning that cute, brown-haired girl he had seen at the bus station, into the absolute sex toy.But after that conquest, there was nowhere really to go to. And as the girl named Margaret had gotten used to this transformation, so did Tom get used to having a personal slave-toy 24 hours a day.







&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's scars have completely healed. Where once were arms ands legs, now ends a smooth layer of skin. It stays inside the bedroom closet, hanging by a rope tied just under the breasts, the other end secured on the closet's pole. Back then, it could at least feel the touch of the soft sheets of his bed. Now, the only touch comes from him. And it is more welcomed than ever before.



Touch is not the only thing he has removed though. Its voice has also been taken. He had grown tired of its moans and needed something permanent to solve his problem. Cutting the vocal chords wasn't an easy procedure but he pulled it off quite well. It would surely never outer a sound again after that. 



Then came its eyes. He didn't want to use any kind of prop or clothing anymore. That and the fact that the blindfolded was old and dirty helped , too. A special kind of medical glue would keep its eyes shut forever without any complicatons. Being opake it just seemed like the toy had each eyes close, and that made it very easthetically pleasing.



Lastly he did its hearing. Having taken all of its senses already, it would to be lazy work of him to not finish

his toys modifications. He could just set the speakers to an unbelievable loud volume, but that could make its toys heart stop. He surgically punctured its eardrums, removing sound from its remaining life.

 

All these modifications took place in a single night. With the help of some drugging, the toy remained unaware of what would happen to it, until it was too late. When it woke up from the sedative, it realized that its vocal chords had been snapped off. It seemed to not like that, sobbing silently until it saw Tom pick the glue that was destined for its eyes. Tom increased the sedative, so that the glue could set over the eyes without the eyelids moving. Finally, the eardrums were permanently damaged. The toy didn't have much to react to that, unable to see the needle being inserted into her ear canal. Its reaction when it realized what had happened was frantic, so Tom had to up the sedative again, to do its other ear.







&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, what is left of Margaret hangs in his closet, all day, mentally swimming in the void that is her world.

She doesn't wear the belt anymore, although her need for contact is bigger now than those days. She anticipates Tom all day, just to be touched, just to feel something. Her greatest memories are the time he spends with her now. They are rare, but they stay with her until the next time he uses her again. Even if it's just a 5 minute ass fucking to empty his balls, she needs him.&nbsp; 



What's that? She feels something across her right breast, one of the shirts hanging next to her. She squirms, tries to get his attention, to show him she's there, that she wants him. Suspended in the air, she can't do much but wiggle a bit back and forth, but he will see me, please see me, please take me with you! 



But nothing happens. He just grabbed a shirt from the closet and left. And she keeps waiting, alone, a pillow waiting to be hugged.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 









&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tom was on the prowl for a new girlfriend. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

He�d grown bored with his old one. He�d been with her for six years, eight months and three days. That was a lot of time to invest in creating the perfect girlfriend�but sometimes familiarity breeds contempt. He hardly spent any time with her any more. The challenge was gone. Margaret was everything he�d imagined she could be when he first meet her for the first time at the bus station. She�d proven malleable. He�d trained her, whittling away her undesirable features. But these days she just seemed tired and used up. He used to think of her as four holes: three that he could fuck anytime he wanted and another in his wallet. He hadn�t though that would get old, but somehow, the sexual excitement was gone. He fucked her when he needed to relieve himself, but most of the time he�d just as soon watch a ball game. When had he become such an old fart? 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

He�d even dyed her hair blonde recently, trying to recapture the old magic from their early days. But maybe he�d gone too far in making Margaret exactly what he wanted. There was no challenge any more. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

And so he�d left his old girlfriend hanging out at the house and went out bar hopping for the night. Now it was after midnight, but he was pretty sure he�d finally found a new canvas for his creative fantasies to work on. He�d decided to go a completely different direction this time. Where Margaret had been the kind of girl that could make even a gay man look twice�this girl was a little on the heavier side. Not that Michelle was unattractive, she had pleasant features and a nice symmetry�but she was a little heavy through the shoulders stomach and especially the hips. She was desperate for attention but a bit shy; the kind of girl who came to a busy singles bar early and was still waiting to get lucky when it was after midnight.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

And where Margaret had brown hair and brown eyes (at least when he�d met her) Michelle had blonde hair and blue eyes. It hadn�t taken much to get those eyes to look at him adoringly�especially after he�d turned on his spider web charm and bought her a few too many drinks. She was ripe for the picking now. All he had to do was say the words. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

�So, do you want to get out of here or what?� 

Her eyes widened and she was breathing a little too hard, but she was smiling as if she�d been trying to think of a subtle way to ask the same question without seeming like a slut. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As if that was a bad thing. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was obvious that she wanted it. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Tom wanted to give it to her. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Come on,� Tom said. �I think you�re a little drunk. Why don�t you let me drive you home?� 



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifteen minutes after they left the bar, Tom pulled his van between the trees of a nearly hidden driveway and began bumping his way slowly along the gravel drive as it climbed up the side of a very steep hill.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Wow,� Michelle said, �With all these trees, your place must really be secluded.�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �I definitely don�t have any trouble with my neighbors,� Tom said, looking over at her and grinning. �But the trees thin out a little when we get to the top of the hill, so my living room has a great view, without sacrificing virtually any privacy. I think you�ll find my place rather interesting. There are a lot of things I want to show you.� 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Like what?� Michelle said, feeling a warm glow of anticipation. She couldn�t remember the last time a man had said something to her that made her feel like that. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Well, for starters,� Tom said, pausing while he got out of the van and walked around to open her door, like a real gentleman. �I�ve decided to take my life in a whole new direction. I�m getting rid of the old and bringing in the new, so to speak.� 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �You mean like a new job?� She guessed. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tom grinned. �You might say that. Not literally, of course, but training someone to be what you want them to be, is definitely hard work. It�s going to take a lot of time and effort; we�ll have to work together on this if it�s going to work.� 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Together?� Geez, this seemed to be moving a lot faster than she ever would have guessed. But she had to admit, �I kind of like the sound of that.� she looked around his living room approvingly. It was large and plushy furnished; not like her own apartment at all. �but, ah� what exactly did you have in mind?�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �A total transformation,� Tom said as he pushed the front door open. �Something experimental; totally new and cutting edge�only no more cutting I think. I want you to get around on your own, totally independent�within the limits of certain bonds, of course� I�ll teach you how to do what I do on the computer, so you can keep things going, while I�m gone. So really, you�ll be like my helper or a maid.�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Michelle had no idea what he was mumbling about�so the best strategy seemed to be to make light of his words. �You brought me here to be your maid? Kinky. Do I get a uniform, or something?� 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �I don�t think you�re taking this seriously,� Tom said, giving her a stern and disapproving scowl that was almost frightening. �I�m not going to show you what I do if you don�t take it seriously.� 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was he serious, or was this just another part of some role playing game? 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �I AM taking it seriously,� she said. �Really I am. I�ve just never� been someone�s maid before.�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He pursed his lips thoughtfully, as if considering her apology.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Come on� show me what you do.� 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Fine,� he said, taking her hand and smiling, as if nothing had happened. �Let me show you my computer.� 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �You�re computer?� That wasn�t what she�d been expecting at all. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �It�s a new start up company I tried,� he said, �but it�s really taking off. All I do is fill the orders and take the packages into town for mailing.� 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Is this the experimental thing you wanted me to help you with?�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �No, of course not,� Tom said. �That part�s just between the two of us. I just wanted to show you this so you�d understand that I�m not just some bum. I can afford to fulfill all the dreams I have for you. So things will be different this time. I want us to be more like a couple, and I really don�t think I can do that without you. Well, that�s not entirely true� I could go find someone else, of course, but you�re already here and... You�re going to be perfect.� 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a little strange, but it sounded like a compliment; and she hadn�t had one of those in a long time. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Perfect?� She asked, looking down at her own body disapprovingly. �Do you really think so? I always thought I was a little� you know.� 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Trust me, you will be perfect,� he said. �You have a lot of positive elements I can work with. You have beautiful skin, and your features are very symmetrical. It�s a good foundation that I can build on.�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �You make it sound like you have a professional gym in your house.� 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �It�s in the basement.� 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Really?� 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �There�s plenty of time for that later; don�t worry, I�ll whip you into shape. You�ll be perfect before I know it.� 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Michelle chuckled. �You have a way of giving very strange compliments, you know that.� 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �I don�t deal in compliments; I deal in results. Come on,� he said, guiding her back out of his computer room and back down the hall to another door, which was also locked. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �You have strange walls,� she observed, noticing the tile on the walls. It reminded her (vaguely) of a dragon�s scales. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Strange but useful, given our project,� he said, �but now I have something very special I want to show you. You see, I want you to be a bigger part of my life than my last girl friend has been� I mean all she does is hang around. All she�s good for was taking care of my needs, if you know what I mean� And resting my head on her stomach, although even that....� 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Don�t you mean on her shoulder?� 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �I want you to be more.� 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Yeah� part of that new direction you mentioned, huh?� 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tom stuck a key in his bedroom lock, then he seemed to look back at her for dramatic effect, grinning. �Michelle, I�d like you to meet, Margaret, my old girlfriend. I�m afraid we don�t really see eye to eye any more� Now, I know you�re probably going to say it�s because I glued her eyelids together before sewing them shut��

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �What did you say?� She asked. She hadn�t really been paying attention because she�d been a little distracted by his rather large bed. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ��but it�s more than that, really,� Tom said as he pulled the door closed with a click. Then he walked across the room to his closet.&nbsp; �We just don�t connect like we used to,� he said as he began to open the old fashioned, swinging doors. �Oh, she still sucks a mean cock. And she�s developed incredible control over the muscles in her pussy and ass� but I have a theory that those are skills anyone can learn, if you train them right. I�m sure you�ll soon discover what I mean. The right motivation makes all the difference.�



 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His words were finally beginning to register, and they stopped Michelle in her tracks. A moment later the closet doors opened enough for her to see that there was someone inside. For a long moment, what she was seeing refused to take focus; her mind simply couldn�t register the contradictions of what she was seeing. Then slowly, the horror of it took shape. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A girl without arms or legs was hanging from her long blonde hair. Somehow, a bit of red ribbon was hanging from her crotch, although Michelle couldn�t see how it was attached. Beneath her was a small bucket, that stank of piss and perhaps other things. Her eyes were sewn shut, but her mouth gapped open, like a baby bird, waiting for its mother to stuff food in its mouth. The poor girl squirmed on the end of her tether, but the movements didn�t seem to be fearful. Strangely, she seemed eager for Tom�s presence. When he placed his hand on her shoulder, she twisted the bottom of her torso out towards him, as if desperately trying to make contact. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Quiet down,� Tom said, as he looked back at Michelle. �There�s no reason for you to scream. I told you, I�m planning to take you in a whole new direction. This isn�t what is in store for you.� He pointed at her as he said the word you and she noticed that he was holding a syringe in his hand. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she noticed herself in the mirror and realized (for the first time) that she was screaming. But strangely, her voice was coming out in a hoarse little squeak that she could barely hear. �You�re insane,� that voice said. And she couldn�t help agreeing with it, although another part of her mind seemed to be warning her that calling a crazy person insane might not be the best strategy if she wished to escape. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the hyperventilating part of her mind seemed to catch up with the rest of it and take over. She gasped, drawing in a deep ragged breath and she could feel her body trembling now, as her knees literally knocked together with what should have been a painful thump. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She began backing way from Tom. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Where are you going?� He asked, in an exasperated voice, as if he were talking to a troublesome child. �There�s nowhere to go. We�re in a secluded woods, miles away from anything. And I�ve gone to great lengths to make sure that no one else knows where it is. I have a mail box in town� I haven�t even told my family or friends about this place. And I�ve made the rooms sound proof, as you�ve noticed, so there�s no chance that anyone can hear you.� 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Michelle�s fingers clutched at the door handle. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was getting rid of the old and bringing in the new�just like he�d said. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh God! Oh God! Oh God! Her brain screamed silently. I can�t end up like that!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her fingers slipped as she tried to turn the door handle, so she turned around and gripped it harder�but that only made it obvious that the door was locked. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �You really need to calm down,� Tom said.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �You want to do that to me, don�t you?� She whispered, looking back at him in horror. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �You haven�t been listening to me, have you?� he asked, shaking his head and giving her another of his frightening scowls. �I told you: I�m going in a new direction this time.� 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Out with the old, in with the new.� 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Not literally. There�s no reason to get rid of things that work, and even if she�s not much of a pillow any more, because she�s so bony, she still sucks a fine cock.� He held out the hand that wasn�t holding the syringe and motioned her to come forward. �Come sit on the bed and we�ll discuss your new role as my partner.� 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Michelle knew she could overpower Tom, he was much stronger than she was. The smartest thing she could do would be to play along. There was an aluminum baseball bat in the closet; that looked like a promising weapon. All she had to do was find an excuse to get close enough to grab it. Maybe she could pretend to be fascinated by the poor girl hanging from her hair in the closet. Could she do that? It seemed to be the kind of thing he�d want from her. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking a deep, shaky breath, she forced herself to move towards the bed, which brought her closer to the closet and the bat. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Can I look at her?� Michelle asked, taking a tentative step towards the hanging girl. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Of course you can,� Tom said with a pleased smile. �I want you to feel free to use her too, you know. Sometimes I get bored with her and forget to feed her. And I suspect she wouldn�t mind taking care of your needs as well. She really does have a talented tongue. Would you like me to set her on the bed so you can give her a try?� 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �No� no,� Michelle said, walking towards the girl and placing her hand against her side. �I want to take a look at her in her� native position first.� 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She could feel the poor girl�s body trembling with anticipation. It didn�t seem to mater whether it was Tom touching her�she was desperate for any attention, from anyone. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �She�s so pretty,� Michelle said. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At one time, it was probably even true.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Does her bucket need emptying?� she said, pretending to look as she reached for the bat that was leaning against the wall, only a little more than a foot away.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind her, she could hear Tom moving towards her quickly. She clutched at the bat, but it toppled, landing in the pile of his dirty clothes. A moment later, he was grabbing her around the waist. Toppling forward, she scrambled to get a hold of the bat, knocking over the bucket in the process and covering herself with the smell of ripe piss. Tom was pulling her away from the bat, rolling her towards the other end of the closet so she couldn�t reach it. This, however, brought her closer to a tennis racket, which she hadn�t noticed before. Desperately she grasped for it, realizing as she picked it up that it was actually smaller and easier to swing than the bat would have been. She let him pull her out of the clothes she was tangled up in, since it gave her more room to swing. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her back hand caught him in the side of the head. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he screamed and let go, clutching his ear, she kicked up as hard as she could into his crotch. There was a satisfying sound, as her foot connected and he collapsed, curling up into a tight ball. Taking advantage, she hit him several more times with the tennis racket�as blood few everywhere, nearly invisible as it splattered against the blood red walls. After a few moments of taking her fury out on him, she calmed enough to think about the bat again. Tossing the tennis racket aside, she reached for it. It felt heavy and solid in her hands as she swung it over head, bringing it down against his side. There was a cracking sound�and she knew she�d broken a rib, but his body didn�t even flinch. He was done, his head, face and body covered with blood. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Damn, there was so much blood. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She hadn�t exactly beaten him to a pulp, but she didn�t expect him to ever get back up again either. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that moment, she realized she was smiling, and somewhere in the back of her mind it occurred to her that the idea of killing a man should have been more disturbing, but it wasn�t. For the first time in several minutes, she felt completely calm.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Michelle lay on the floor beside the couch. The armless girl she�d recently rescued was lying on the couch in front of her. A small platter of food was sitting on the coffee table, not far away. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though she was expecting her to weigh less, it was surprising (and a little alarming) just how little Margaret weighted�and not all of it was because she was missing her legs. Tom obviously hadn�t been feeding her anywhere near enough.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She winced when she thought about Tom�s body. Ugh! She wasn�t looking forward to getting rid of it�in fact she was still rather confused about how to even start. No, tonight, all she wanted to do was relax and not worry about the things she knew she�d eventually have to do. Shaking her head, she put those thought out of her mind and touched the spoon to the poor girl�s lips again. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Surprisingly, Margaret turned her head away, as if she were too full to eat any more. This seemed odd, given how little she�d eaten; and how eagerly she�d held her mouth open in the beginning. Even the first bite of food seemed to surprise her, however. Michelle couldn�t help thinking it was because the girl wasn�t accustomed to being fed when she wasn�t hanging in the closet; or maybe it was because she was being fed a kind of food (real people food) that she wasn�t used to eating. Whatever the reason, however, having it in her mouth seemed to disturb her. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No wonder the poor thing was so thin. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tears began to fall as she contemplated what the poor girl�s life must have been like�and what it would be like going forward. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Michelle intended to treat her much better than Tom had, but still, the girl couldn�t see. She didn�t seem to hear or speak, either. Her skin was incredibly sensitive, however; she clearly yearned for contact with another human�any human. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Michelle wondered if there was anything that could be done to help her. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The girl�s legs were gone forever, of course. Nothing could grow them back. And she could see the cut in her throat, which implied that Tom must have done something to her vocal cords. He�d probably also done something to her ears, which was why she didn�t seem to be able to hear. Or maybe she�d been born death. Maybe that was why he�d rendered her mute�so he wouldn�t have to listen to her strange voice. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the morning, she�d begin the gruesome task of cutting the threads from the girl�s eyes, to see if her eye sight could be salvaged�although Michelle didn�t really expect much. Tom had mentioned something about gluing her eyes together, and the adhesive probably caused permanent damage. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having been a nurse, at one time, Michelle was reasonably confident that a hospital wouldn�t be able to do much for the girl; certainly nothing that she couldn�t do just as well. And, if she turned Margaret over to the police, she would loose this house and the internet business that virtually ran itself. Not to mention the endless questions they�d ask about Tom�s death. When people learned what happened, there would be unwanted media attention. Her family would wonder what she�d been doing at a bar drinking with a strange man. Her co-workers would find out as well, and there would be the strange looks and mutterings behind her back. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It wasn�t the same at all, but she�d experienced something like what she feared would happen back when she was in high school. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, it would definitely be better all around if she could avoid all that. Going back to her old life, however, didn�t seem practical. She couldn�t leave Margaret behind, but she didn�t see how it would be possible to take her home. Hospitals often had hidden cameras, so she could very well just drop her off somewhere. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only real solution was to stay here and take care of Margaret herself. She�d taken a look at Tom�s computer business, and he�d not only been right about the thing virtually running itself�everything was drop ship and automated�but during the time since the last time he�d taken care of it, he�d sold several hundred dollars worth of inventory. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was enough to live on; enough to put a little away in savings. And the house really was rather nice. It had a fully equipped gym in the basement, and she could purchase a few pieces of medical equipment to help her with Margaret�s needs. She would no doubt be able to give the poor girl far more attention than they would at even the best facility�and that was assuming she didn�t fall through the cracks and there was some government agency willing to pay for her housing and treatment. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, it would be far better to take care of the girl herself. It wasn�t much, but she would spend the rest of her life doing what she could to make the girl�s life a little more enjoyable. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only problem with her plan was the question that still remained: What was she going to do with Tom�s body?



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he opened his eyes, Tom�s body felt bruised and sore and his head felt as if someone had bashed it in with a hammer. Lifted his face off the carpet, he felt a painful twinge in his side that almost made him cry out in pain. He�d never had one before, but there was no question in his mind that at least one of his ribs were broken. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pressing his hand against the pain, he sat up a little further. He felt a little woozy and he was covered in sticky dried blood. Gently, he touched his fingers to the large knot on the crown of his skull and before he even looked, he knew his fingers would be covered with even more blood.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Damn,� he muttered softly, �Something must have gone wrong.� 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He couldn�t remember anything that had happened the night before, but he figured it was time to find out just what went on.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As he rose to his feet, his muscles and joints ached�as if someone had been wailing on him pretty good, but luckily, aside from the ribs, nothing seemed to be seriously damaged. It was just a little stiffness and a lot of soreness. He�d experienced worse after a long night spent drinking. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He went to the night table and checked for his gun. It was still taped under the drawer, right where he�d left it, so not a jealous boyfriend or anything. Still he checked to make sure that it was loaded. Then he started walking down the hall, determined to find out just what happened and set things right, if he could. 











&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He slowly walks out of the bedroom, leaving a trail of blood behind him. Not much can be seen, except his form. He passes through the corridor of the upper floor, holding the gun in his hands. "WHERE ARE YOU HONEYYYY?", his voices echoes in the night's darkness. He stumbles from one side of the wall to the other, trying to keep his balance. "Look, all couples fight at times... it's natural... i forgive you, but you have to GET HERE, RIGHT NOW!!!" The last four words don't come in the voice of the charming guy at the bar anymore. It's the rattle of a psychopathic hunter, stalking his pray.



He goes down the stairs to the living room. Michelle can see him now. She is hiding behind a wall a few feet from him. She can't leave yet! She can't abandon the deformed girl. Michelle holds her breath as the man steps appear closer and closer to her. She remains still, frozen in fear, praying for the man to not notice her...

There's no sound. The footsteps have stopped. As Michelle tries to shift her head and check the room, the man appears right in front of her! He has the same deranged smile he had when he showed her that girl inside his closet, and ...there's a tennis racket coming from the side of his head?!







&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Michelle opens her eyes wide. She is laying on the double bed next to Margaret, whose name she didn't know and could not find out in any way. It was all a dream. A terrifying one. Michelle let out a sigh, reminding herself that Tom was very definitely dead in the room upstairs, and could not harm them in any way. At least not anymore.



She turned her head to face the girl. She was finally asleep, dressed in one of Tom's shirts Michelle had picked from his wardrobe. It was years since the last time she wore anything, and the same years since she last slept on a bed. Michelle kept her eyes fixed on the poor woman. She couldn't even begin to imagine how much she must have suffered. She tried removing the glue from her eyes, but it was medical one, meaning it had fused with her eyelids like a second skin. Apart from her obviously chopped off arms and legs, her deaf ears, her cut vocal chords and her blind eyes, she looked really underfed and skinny. "I will take care of you", she whispered to her, even though she knew she couldn't listen.







&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Michelle always liked taking care of people. Working for years as a nurse was tough, but as rewarding as she hoped it would be. But there was something more she felt deep inside her while looking at the girl, and it made her so unnerved that she tried to push it away from her head all night. 



Sure, living in this big house with a business running itself was logical, as was the fact that probably no one would take as good care of the girl as she would, even her family, if she had one. But as she kept staring at the sleeping girl, with the beautiful, long, blonde hair, Michelle had one thing in her mind. "I want to keep you. I want you."







&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next morning Michelle had to face the fact that she had an 180-pound body to move outside and bury. She wasn't happy about that. Leaving her new roommate to sleep a bit more, she spend the entire morning carrying the tall bastard outside and digging a large enough hole, as far away from the house as it was safe. She had dealt with dead people before, in her work, but never had she shown such little respect for a corpse.

She cursed Tom the whole time while digging his grave, everytime she thought of the awful things he had put that poor woman through.



She returned inside, cleaned most of the blood from the room she was attacked, (or rather, she attacked him, a detail that made no difference at this point). She then took a shower, and went to wake up the girl. She had to eat something this time! Last night she wouldn't eat anything that Michelle had found in the fridge. "I have to give her a name or something, this is not right, referring to her as SHE all the time", the girl thought to herself, even though it wouldn't change much. She uncovered the bedsheet that lay on top of her, and gently placed her hand on her cheek. "Come on, love, time to have some breakfast.." Love. It was a term of endearment she often used, and it came out naturally. The girl reacted, clinging her face towards the hand, with a smile forming on her face. Michelle smiled too, seeing the girl happy.



Then, Margaret reached her tongue towards the hand, trying to lick it, as this was something Tom would like, and therefore something she would be doing at this point. Michelle pulled her arm away, disturbed at the sudden sexualisation of a sweat moment. She tried to show understanding. This girl was probably conditioned into being a sex slave for who knows how long.







&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She took the girl in her arms and carried her downstairs to the dining room. she made some toast and a coffee for herself. "I should get a baby-chair", Michelle thought while holding Margaret thoughout this. She tried feeding her toast and a glass of milk, but with little success. Dissapointed at her efforts, Michelle looked through the fridge's shelves to find what was that woman fed all this time? She then saw a couple of bottles she hadn't paid attention to. There were plain, milk bottles, with a brown liquid inside. As Michelle opened one of them, she yelled "Oooh, what the fuck??". This was certainly not chocolate. It smelled like piss, amongst some other things. Could it be?



As Michelle brought the bottle in front of Margaret's lips, the girl begun sipping its contents without hesitation. "GOD DAMMIT!" The bottle was smashed on the floor. Michelle was enraged and full of tears. How could someone do this to another human being? She told herself she was not going to force the girl, no one was going to force her to do anything, anymore. But the damage already done was great.



Michelle mixed a third of the foul goo into the milk bottle and tried again. Not surprisingly, Margaret was much more accepting of her new meal. "Maybe with time, she'll stop", Michelle hoped.







&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next days passed with both of them getting used to a new life. Michelle bought the baby-chair and a sports bottle, so Margaret could drink without needing her help all the time. She also got her some clothes. Any underwear didn't stay on her for long, so Michelle gave up and left her wearing only shirts. "what was the point of underwear at this point?",she thought. She had made one last stop to her apartment to pick up her most valuable belongings, mostly clothes and old music records, along with whatever little money she had on her.



At nights they would cozy-up in the couch in front of the T.V. Michelle liked talking to Margaret, even though she didn't expect any reply. It was a little thing to keep her from going insane from the silence in the house, but she also geniunely loved talking to her "love", as she had grown to calling her. "How can they be so dumb, love, those kids are running straight towards the killer!", she'd say while watching a scary movie, then throw a little smooch on the girl's forehead.



She really liked the feeling of her warm body on her, it comforted her throught the difficult times she would come by. Angst of whether she might be found by police or others, fear of the business ever collapsing, all stopped when she hold her love in her arms. And Margaret loved it, too. In fact, so much so that a lot of the times, Michelle would abrubtly end their "touchy-games" as soon as she felt awkward by the girl getting too hot and bothered. Michelle liked touching the girl, playing with her and tickling her, it was the only way she could communicate with her, but her logic told her: "It's not right, the girl is psychologically traumatized. It will do her good if she can forget about sex and focus on other things for a change". But it was gradually becoming harder and harder to not notice the girl's erect nipples or even wet marks on her shirt, whenever she put her on her lap.







&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two weeks had passed and Margaret was still being fed with the remains of Tom's recipe, being mixed with the normal meals Michelle would make. Until today, when she opened the fridge and realized they were over. Margaret had gained some weight throughout, and looked pretty normal, nutrition-wise. But she still wouldn't eat plain-old food. Michelle tried to come up with a solution, when she felt her bladder was full, and a twisted idea sneaked in her mind. The mix had definitely human piss in it. Maybe all she had to do was piss in her soup and she would eat it. What else could she do? she rationalised it. The weird thing was, the more she thought of it, the more she wanted to do it. 



"I have to, otherwise she won't eat", she said, out loud this time, as she walked to the bathroom holding the sport-bottle full of warm soup she had cooked today. She always made sure to brush 'love's teeth meticulously after every meal. " Today, i'll do it twice", she promised herself, again out loud, before relxing her bladder and letting the yellow liquid drop inside the bottle. She felt a weird feeling of power, at that moment. Realizing she was getting a high from this, made her feel horribly right after. Angry at herself, she took the bottle downstairs and fed Margaret her special soup. 







&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Life went on the remote house in the country-side. The two women would sleep together in the large bed,&nbsp; with Michelle clutching Margaret in her arms. At mornings, Michelle would usually go for a light run out in the sun, with her friend conviniently placed in her back bag, up to her neck. She liked the breeze and the sun on her face and skin, and Michelle loved seeing her smile, whenever they went outside on a good day. She'd then feed her at noon, her meals containing little to no urine at this point, much to Michelle's relief. She was even eating solid food again, something her teeth had forgotten to chew. 



At the afternoon she'd work out and check the progress of the online business she had "inherited" by Tom. And she'd play with her love. Boy, did she enjoyed that. She'd lay her on the couch and watch her react at the moment she would touch her belly, her nose or her head. And tickling. She loved tickling her. It brought her a mother's joy. Even though Michelle didn't have kids, she thought that was probably how it would feel. She tried avoiding any intimate parts, as to not arouse Margaret.



But the girl's sex obsession wasn't being healed, in fact, it was getting worse and worse, and so was Michelle's loneliness. She had dedicated so much time to Margaret, she had forgotten about herself, her family and friends, who probably missed her a lot and worried about her.







&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One night, when they had watched another movie, or rather Michelle had, she stayed sitting on the couch, with Margaret on her lap as usual. She had a bottle of whiskey next to her, and it was more empty than full.

Her mind was weak, she wasn't thinking clearly anymore. She slowly pulled up Margaret's shirt, revealing her beautiful pussy to her. Immediately, Margaret started rubbing her hole on Michelle's thigh, finding an opportunity for release. Michelle was going to give it to her, this time. She placed the girl between her legs on the couch and with one hand started feeling her breasts from under the shirt, the other moved down to her privates. Michelle had never pleasured another woman, nor had she ever had such a fantasy, but at that moment, nothing made sense.



She twirled her fingers on and around the girl's clit, and pinched her already erect nipples. She couldn't control herself. "I want to kiss her so bad!", was the only thought in her mind. She lowered her head, nibbling on Margaret's neck, before kissing her lips passionately. The mute girl returned her kiss, like she was waiting for it all these weeks. Sex was her only pleasure for almost a decade of her life. She didn't knew much else at this point. Her orgasm wasn't heard in her voice, but her body spasms and heavy breathing were more than enough clues to Michelle.



She took the helpless girl in her arms and moved towards the bedroom, kissing her sensually the whole way. They undressed completely and layed on the bed. Michelle turned Margaret to face the other end. She wrapped her hands around Margaret's waist and stuck her face to her fuck-hole, licking hungrily, like it was the fountain of youth and she would suck its water from inside. At the same time, Margaret found her way with her tongue to Michelle's parts, and got to work as well. 



They must have stayed like this for hours, although Michelle hoped it would never end. They both came several times, before their tongues, more than their will, gave up. At night, Margaret wasn't nervously shifting or grinding towards Michelle anymore. It was the most peaceful sleep they both had in a long time.







&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From that day on, Michelle was having sex with the limbless girl all day and every day. It was like she dove into a sea of lust there was no turning back from, addicting and wonderful. Taken over by Margaret's animalistic nature, she gave into it herself. She made the decision to name her "Love" after that night, too. It felt like there was nothing in the world but them, and indeed, this was the case. Michelle would take her time, enjoying her luscious kisses and teasing the girl with her touch, sometimes for hours, before sending her over the edge of ecstasy. 



At first, things were very intimate. Caressing Margaret's long hair and her beautiful skin, just to watch the goosebumbs on her it and her cute shivers. Michelle loved playing with Love's tongue, inserting her fingers in her welcoming mouth and getting them drenched wet, before moving them souther to her craving pussy. "You're mine, love", she'd whisper in her deaf ears, turning herself on. Michelle loved eating her out, most of all. She even loved the taste of the girl's cum, flowing generously every time she twirled her tongue on her clit. 



Michelle had never thought of herself as a lesbian. But even after all this, she didn't feel like one. Her relationship with Love was stranger than that, something different, deeper. It wouldn't work with any other woman in the world. This was HER Love, and it made sense only with her.







&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Months went by. The situation didn't resolve at the slightest. The two women couldn't even take a bath together, (as they routinely did in the past), without Michelle turning it into another wet fuck-fest. They only seemed to stop when Michelle was cooking or when they were asleep. Cleaning was out of the question.



So much so that it became a living hazard. Michelle composed herself one day, in order to clean at least some of the mess she had let build up all these months. "I should clean upstairs, too", she thought. 



She entered the room where everything had begun. The floor still had some faint red marks on it, as Michelle had decided it wasn't gonna be used, already from the day she first whipped those blood stains. She opened the closet, the same she had first saw Love in, that horrific day. Dirty shirts and pants, some of them piles down on the ground.



Then, something caught her eye. She kneels to see clearer. It's a metal belt, with ... a dildo attached on it! A remote control was laying a few inches away. Michelle picked it up in her hands, wild lust-driven thoughts rushing to her head. "NO! IT'S WRONG! HE USED THIS ON HER! IT'S NOT RIGHT!" She told herself. But the wetness between her legs, told her otherwise...







&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That belt became a frequent toy of Michelle's time with Margaret. She didn't react much when the chubby blonde carefully put it on her. Michelle justified this as a sign of consent, to alleviate her own guilt. She first would leave her for a few minutes before "finishing her off", but soon it turned into hours! Michelle's possesive demon had took over and the sex changed tone. It wasn't loving or caring anymore. It was pure power doing all the work now. Caresses were now gropes and inserting became shoving. There were even sometimes, where unbeknownst to her, Michelle was actively choking Love through some of their "love-making" sessions. The woman still came a lot, and was always game for more, So Michelle didn't think much of it.







&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A year had passed since Michelle's moving in to that damned house. Her life was a mess, a deprived, sex-driven mayhem, like a junkie, always searching for his next hit. That night, Michelle had put the belt on Love, as usual, and left her to jerk around for about three hours. She masturbated intensely, watching her with red-shot, wide eyes. She then felt the need to pee. Simply taking Love and placing her on the floor, she stood above her face. Drunk by the power trip (and also from copious amounts of drinking), she let her urine trickle down to Love's face, hitting her mouth. The amputee immediately opened it wide, receiving the gift and swallowing it.



The next day, Michelle woke up, dizzy from the last night. She saw her naked body, the cum soaked bedsheets, the empty whiskey bottles on the floor. And next to them, the form of a girl with no arms or legs. She jumped up in shock and got to her. She was still wearing the belt, the dildo buzzing indefinitely! The girl was twitching and spasming from the entire night's ordeal.



Michelle quickly removed the belt and took Love in her arms. She sat on the bed holding her for a few seconds. It then hit her. "What have i turned into?!"..."I'm just like HIM!" She had stayed in this place to help Margaret, to show her a better life, but all she had managed to do was turn her into HER sex-object. 



Then, the realisation that everything she did had no effect on the girl, made her miserable. It didn't matter what her intentions were. Whatever Michelle did. she could never really know her. The girl that once occupied that body, was not there anymore. There were only nerve endings now. There was no distinction of good or bad, of happy or sad, of enjoyment or distress. Michelle realised, she had lost, she couldn't bring Love back. 







&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As these facts sank in more and more, as if to prove her right, Margaret started licking the woman's breasts that were in front of her. It didn't even matter how much abuse she had suffered just then. Michelle placed her right hand on the girl's head, the other behind her lower back. Then, she pushed Love's head closer on her breasts, until she was smothered by them. Love continued licking for a few more seconds, then went to move her head back, to take a breather. But she felt the woman's hand holding her head in place. With tears in her eyes, Michelle kept holding the girl on her chest, despite her struggling efforts to turn away from her. She started sobbing, lowering her face on the top of Love's head, who was now suffocating. There was no way she could escape the woman's grip without any leverage. 



After a few more moments of silent struggle, Margaret became completely still. Michelle held her face on her chest for a bit, before loosening her grip. She held the girl, whose mouth was now resting open, in her arms and wept, with tears running down her cheeks and dripping on the lifeless body.
