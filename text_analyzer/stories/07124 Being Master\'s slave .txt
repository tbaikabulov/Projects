Being Master\'s slave 
Provided By: BDSM Librarywww.bdsmlibrary.com
Synopsis: poem describing what it\'s like to be his slave 






Waiting for someone to discover
All of those things that she needs
Until she tenatively whispers to him
And a plan of sorts is agreed

{I can see that she's nervous
She's not sure how much she should say
Yet when she utters thoughts on her mind
I can see her eyes light up, joy on display}

Slowly but surely, giving herself to him
For she needs to serve and obey
Training becoming a little more intense
With each and every passing day

{I can see it in her face, she's overwhelmed
Knowing that this is what she was born to do
Revelling so deeply in her new found role
Ironic, she once thought her thoughts taboo}

Hesitantly doing her best to follow
The new rules put in place each time
Wondering why she never admitted it before
For this feeling is something so sublime

{She needs me, and I need her
We were just waiting to be found
Everytime I gaze into those eyes
Both experience a love so profound}

Struggling to put into words
How it feels to hear his praise
And to feel those lips on her's
Quickly sets her heart ablaze

{And she's growing more each passing day
Although sometimes she stillsuffers some setbacks
Not ready to fully submit herself to me just yet
But a few sharp lashes usually sets her back in track}

Giving into her innermost desires
For she wants and needs him to have control
With every command, every whispered I love you
She's handing him her heart, her body and soul

Passion and trust so deep between them
Knwoing what they have will never be broken
They've handed themselves to each other
So full of love, sincerity and emotion

Used to think that she craved this
Now she knows she needs it more than ever
Struggles with her rebellious side sometimes
Yet she knows she'll serve Master forever
