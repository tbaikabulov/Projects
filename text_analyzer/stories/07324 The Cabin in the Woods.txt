Synopsis: 






 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Chapter 1

It began on the day that the thermos disappeared from the side of the road.&nbsp; Pam had noticed the red thermos one day on her daily commute, and it had become a sort of obsession to look at it each time she drove by.&nbsp; A piece of cast-off garbage gave her a way to pass the time, wondering where it had come from and how it got there.&nbsp; She had been watching it for years, and it had been there on the way to work.&nbsp; Now, on her way home, it was gone.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The rest of the drive home passed without incident.&nbsp; Pam drove into the garage, habitually closing the door before she got out of the car while making sure nobody snuck in.&nbsp; Nobody ever did, or even acted like they were going to try.&nbsp; For the first time that night, she laughed to herself that the biggest change in her life over the past few years was the missing thermos.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The evening passed as all of her evenings did.&nbsp; Charisma, the only other occupant of the cabin, insisted on being petted and fed, not necessarily in that order, immediately upon Pam&#8217;s arrival home.&nbsp; Occasionally the cat would also want to go outside, and today was one of those days.&nbsp; As Pam changed from her uniform into her sweatpants and T-shirt, the quiet of the cabin almost overwhelmed her.&nbsp; She drank a small glass of milk before leaving the house for her daily run through the woods.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As she ran, the thought of the thermos crept back into her mind.&nbsp; When she had first seen the thermos, she had thought it strange.&nbsp; But as time went on, it seemed that the thermos would always be there, and somewhere along the way, she had promised herself that her life would change before the thermos disappeared.&nbsp; Now the thermos was gone, but she was still coming home from the same job, to the same cabin, to the same cat, for the same run.&nbsp; She ran faster and harder to use up some of the despair that she was beginning to feel, and tried to clear her mind of all thoughts except for breathing in and out.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She ran the trail twice that night, pushing herself, almost punishing herself for feeling so trapped.&nbsp; The rocks and roots on the forest floor of the trail kept her looking ahead, and the hills and valleys worked her body.&nbsp; When she was done,&nbsp; her mind calmed a little, as it always did, on seeing her cabin.&nbsp; She had worked so hard for the cabin, and she loved the cozy, woody home.&nbsp; It was the coming home to the empty house, the same old job day in and day out, the never-changing routine that was starting to break her.&nbsp; The same old self-incriminations that if she would just get her act together, initiate the change, do something different.&nbsp; Then realizing, again, that the problem was that she didn&#8217;t know what she wanted, and didn&#8217;t know what she wanted to change.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Charisma was waiting at the door, ready to come in when Pam got back.&nbsp; As Pam did a few laps around the cabin to cool off, the tiger striped cat walked with her, looking longingly at the front door each time they passed.&nbsp; Finally, Pam entered the numbers into the keypad to unlock the door and they both went in.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Pam looked at herself in the mirror as she stripped off her clothes to take a shower.&nbsp; Her long brown hair was damp with sweat and stuck to her face.&nbsp; Her breasts were large, and still covered with sweat, and her stomach was flat and toned.&nbsp; Her legs were hard muscles from her daily runs, but it was her eyes that always caught her attention when she dared to stare into the mirror.&nbsp; The haunted look was slowly disappearing, and she never knew if she would see blue eyes, or the golden-speckled green eyes.&nbsp; Some people had told her that her eyes were grey, and once she had even heard somebody who was looking right at her call them brown.&nbsp;&nbsp; It thought that it wasn&#8217;t common for people&#8217;s eyes to change colors, but hers did, changing with her mood.&nbsp;&nbsp; Today they were the hazel green.&nbsp; When she was really happy, they were bright blue.&nbsp; They hadn&#8217;t been blue in too long.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While the water heated, Pam walked naked into the kitchen to feed the meowing cat.&nbsp; Charisma jumped onto her table and watched as Pam followed the ritual of filling the food bowl with dry food, then filling the water bowl, and finally opening the can of wet food to mix into the dry food.&nbsp; Charisma knew the routine and never doubted that the canned food was coming.&nbsp; The contented purr of the cat as Pam caressed her was one of the highlights of her day.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As she got into the shower, the water slid over her tight muscles, relaxing them with the heat.&nbsp; As she put her head under the spray, Pam let go of all the thoughts racing around her mind and just enjoyed the feel of the water.&nbsp; The warmth and force of the spray was soothing, calming, and sensuous.&nbsp; Pam stayed under the water for a few minutes before moving on with her shower habit of washing her hair, rinsing, and repeating.&nbsp; The conditioner was left on as she exfoliated her body, followed by a long soapy body wash as she massaged each muscle.&nbsp; She turned the water up for the final rinse of her hair and body before reluctantly turning off the water.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The air was cold after the hot spray, and she could feel her nipples tightening as she pulled the curtain back.&nbsp; A towel around her head and a light pat down of her body was all that was needed before she wrapped the towel around herself and went back into the kitchen to pour herself a glass of wine.&nbsp; Her secluded cabin provided her with the opportunity to walk around the house naked without worrying of anybody looking in the window, and as she often did, she left the towels in the bathroom and wandered out onto the deck with her glass of wine to enjoy the evening. 
 The birds were chatting to themselves, and the sun was beginning to go down as she lit the candle on the small wooden table.&nbsp; The breeze swirled around her as she sat back in the hammock chair, spinning slightly as the chair accepted her body.&nbsp; She had just gotten comfortable when she realized that she&#8217;d almost drank her entire glass of wine, and she unrolled her body to make a trip to the kitchen to grab the rest of the bottle.&nbsp; She&#8217;d gotten into the habit of a half of a bottle a night, but it wasn&#8217;t uncommon for her to drink more, especially as the days grew longer and she stayed out on the deck longer.&nbsp; 
Soon the familiar, slightly out-of-body experience took over.&nbsp; The slight buzz, the soft breeze, the chattering birds, and the smooth sway of the chair worked it&#8217;s magic and she relaxed her entire body.&nbsp; She never saw the eyes in the woods, never heard any crackling of a branch or stone being kicked that might have alerted her to her unknown, unwelcome company in the trees.&nbsp; As dusk became night, feeling totally alone in the world, Pam let her hands roam over her body.&nbsp; A finger slipped between her legs to run on her clit as her other hand rubbed up her stomach to her puckered nipples.&nbsp; 
She leaned back and spread her legs as she pushed one finger deep in her cunt to get it nice and wet, then swirled gently around her clit.&nbsp; Her other hand altered between tits, between a gentle touch all around her breast and twisting her sensitive nipples until the pain made her gasp.&nbsp; The fantasy in her head was the same play- she was sunbathing on the beach when a strong man laid down beside her and ripped her bikini off of her, pinning her down as he pulled her head back by her hair.&nbsp; He kissed her, then started kissing down her body, stopping to suck and bite on her tits.&nbsp; He bit her body as he licked and nibbled, causing her to writhe under him, and he didn&#8217;t stop until he had sucked on her clit.&nbsp; She slammed her fingers into herself as she imagined him climbing on top of her and thrusting himself into her, driving all of him into her tight pussy in one effort.&nbsp; Then she rubbed her clit as she imagined him slowing thrusting in and out, biting her nipples, pinning her down so that she couldn&#8217;t move.&nbsp; It was taking longer and longer for her to be able to make herself come with this fantasy, but she finally felt the little tremors as she squeezed her clit and imagined him coming inside of her.&nbsp; 
She sat in the chair for a few minutes, letting her breathing slow and her body calm.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t a hard come, and it didn&#8217;t take long for her to sit up and finish her third glass of wine.&nbsp; Feeling lonely, she blew out the candle and went back into the house, ready to fall into bed and repeat the day all over again tomorrow.&nbsp;
