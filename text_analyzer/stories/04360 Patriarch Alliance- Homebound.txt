�The Patriarch Alliance consists of 3 planets, Planet Whiteside, Thordaw and Kadir.
All 3 planets were lost during the Great Retreat of 7816 and were taken over by
the Walien Theocracy. The aliens withdrew in 7950�the 3 planets (like most of
the other planets in the Outer Rims) decided to declare independence.�

����������������������������������������������� The
Outer Planets, the Lost Terran Empire 

����������������������������������������������� Published
in Year 8024

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Jenny
was ready for culture shock. When the space transport entered hyperspace, she
was ready. When the transport entered Planet Thordaw, she was ready. When she
first saw the sun baked land that was to be her new home, she was ready. When
the male and female passengers of the transport were separated, she was ready.
When she first entered the arrival hall of the spaceport�Jenny knew she was in trouble.

The
spaceport was full with people. Noise filled the arrival hall she entered as
people were shouting out greeting to old family and friends. A buzz of
excitement was in the air as everyone was eagerly waiting for the arrivals. A
very typical spaceport�except that all the people shouting were men. Jenny did
not see a single woman. Then she looked over the men and saw the women of
Thordaw. The few of them she saw were standing behind their men looking at the
ground before them. She almost wished she hadn�t.

�Hey
beautiful,� Jenny found an arm wrapped around her waist. Startled, Jenny looked
beside her and saw the man responsible for her current problems. Boris Frings
was a student she met in the Titan Space Academy, the man she fell in love with� and the man she left
her planet, culture and life for. Her family and friends were shocked when the
ambitious girl they thought they knew said that she was leaving for Thordaw,
but with Boris there, somehow she thought it was worth it.

&nbsp;

�I�m glad you�re here,� the
sound of relief was evidenced in Jenny�s voice.

�Lot
to take in, huh.� 

�You said it. I thought that
all that research I did would have helped.�

�Don�t worry, you�ll be fine.
Look like I found our ferry service.� It was then that she saw the 2 people
beside Boris. 

&nbsp;

�Jenny, this is my oldest
brother Alfred and his first Zhang. Alfred, this is Jenny.� One look at Alfred
and Jenny knew that they were related. A short, slim body shape with black hair
black eyes and a face that scream Korean�which is kind of ironic considering
they were called Frings. Alfred was smiling. Wearing a yellow long-sleeved
shirt with light blue pants, he looked just like Boris except that he was about
half a head taller. This meant that he was about half a head shorter than
Jenny.

&nbsp;

�You didn�t say you were
bringing a friend, Boris.�

�She is not my friend
Alfred,� a short pause and a look to Jenny later, �she will be my first.�

��������� Surprisingly, Alfred�s face became blank. He stood ram-rod
still, the woman behind him however lifted her head. Zhang was dressed just
like every Thordawan woman Jenny saw in the spaceport. She was wearing a
grey�robe would be the best word. The robe was similar to those wore by monks
in the 15th century, it was long sleeved but the length of the robe
only reached her knees. There was also a hood, but unlike the hood of the
ancient monks which covered only the top of the head, this hood covered the
whole face with a mesh in front. Jenny couldn�t even see the eyes. This means
that all Jenny could see was a grey, faceless person whose only visible body
parts were her hands and lower legs. She couldn�t even see the shape of her
tits as the robe was big and very non-hugging. Oh, she was also barefooted. If
Jenny didn�t know that this was the way every married Thordawan woman dressed
in public, she wouldn�t even be able to tell that it was a woman. Just like
every Empire woman she knew, Jenny thought that the robe/uniform looked
ridiculous. 

&nbsp;

The way I�ll look in the future

��������� 

��������� The thought when it came was not a comforting one. Zhang
then lowered her head and looked straight down at her bare feet. Jenny knew
what the look from Boris was for. Feet together, legs straight, Jenny bend
over. With her legs still straight, Jenny then put her hands on her knees and
looked straight at the floor. This was how a Thordawan woman greeted a man she
was just introduced. �The Greeting Position� as Boris called it. Boris was very
adamant that she knows some basic laws and positions before she arrived in
Thordaw. She was still not very happy about some of the positions she will be
forced to do but Boris, with some pain and threats, made sure she practiced the
position and memorized the basic laws of womanhood. �If you want to come home
with me, you will need to live like a Thordawan woman,� Boris said on more than
one occasion.

&nbsp;

�Father knows?� Alfred asked.
The question was for Boris.

�No� Boris said.

�He will not be happy.�

�No, he will not be happy.�
Jenny would like nothing better than to look at the two men and explain to
Alfred why she was here, but this it Thordaw. �Not a cow� place� as Boris put
it. So Jenny looked at the floor and waited.

�She�s from Earth?�

�Jenny is from Talon
exactly.�

�In the Catrim system.�

�That�s right.�

�Still part of the Empire.� A
pause in the conversation. Jenny was exactly scared now. She and Boris knew
that there would be some resistance from his family but she just got there and
haven�t even left the spaceport yet.

&nbsp;

This is from his favorite brother�what will his father
be like. 

&nbsp;

Again, not a comforting
thought.

&nbsp;

�She is mine,� Boris said.

�You sound determined,� this
was from Alfred. Jenny wasn�t sure but she almost heard a voice of bemusement
in the statement.

�I am�

�What if the old man says
No?� Good question.

�His problem, not mine.�

Alfred chuckled at this. �By
the books, you have changed Boris.�

�It has been 5 years.� 

�You are a man now. Not like
when you left.�

�I�m 24 now and you are
right. I�m not like the person that left to see the home world.�

�Your bags will be in the
truck by now. Come on then.�

&nbsp;

With that, the two men walked
away. Jenny was surprised as no one told her to follow. The men were just
ignoring her. She ran and caught up to the two men. She was about to give them
a piece of her mind when a hand stopped her. She saw Zhang was behind her. In
her robes, Zhang put a finger to her lips. The universal human sign of �keep
quiet�. Zhang then signaled her to walk beside her and behind the two men.

&nbsp;

A cow�s place. Of course, walk behind the men, keep your
head down and mouth shut. That�s the way things are done here. This must be a
test.

&nbsp;

The fact that she would have
failed a test within an hour of landing was again not a comforting thought. She
nodded her thanks to Zhang. Zhang nodded back. �Do not speak until spoken to,� another rule of Thordaw. Following
silently behind the men, with head bowed of course, Jenny left the spaceport�
and was immediately hit with the extreme heat that a desert planet would have.
Jenny looked up at the city, she couldn�t help it. She was in a new city on a new planet 12 systems away from Talon. She just
had to look. 

Outside
the spaceport, she saw more variety of people. She even passed a few aliens and
a few human who dressed like aliens. She saw 2 women walking quietly behind 2
men. The men were talking to each other like friends. The 2 women however
couldn�t look more different. One of the women was wearing a sport bra with short
shorts, looking as if she was going for a jog except that there was a thick
black collar around her neck; while the other women was totally hairless! She
was bald, even her eyebrows were shaved. Jenny could even see that her pussy
was hairless. How could she see that you asked? It was because the woman was
totally naked, wearing only a thong. Both women were looking at the ground
while walking. They too were walking barefoot. 

The
men led Jenny and Zhang to a parking area and were walking towards a
hovercraft; or as Alfred will say, �a hover-truck�. The front could seat 2-3 people
including the driver, but it was the back that caught her eye. There was an
open cage where the deck should have been. Alfred opened the cage and Zhang
immediately climbed onboard. A look from Boris and Jenny knew that she was to
enter the cage as well. She could see that their bags were already inside but
she froze. There was no seating and Zhang was sitting on the floor of the
truck. She had had her knees towards her body and wrapped her hands around her
legs. As if trying to be as small as possible.

&nbsp;

Like an animal. I can�t do it. I won�t do it. I�m a
free woman, not a bloody animal. This was a mistake.

&nbsp;

A scowl from Boris told Jenny
that she was taking too long. Looking at his face and another thought came to
her.

&nbsp;

That is your man, your future husband. You are to be
his wife and he is taking a big risk bringing you along. Do you ready want to
disappoint him� can you bear to???

&nbsp;

Only one answer to that. She
entered the cage�and into her new life.

&nbsp;

�A man must be strong, if not,

He must be smart, if not,

He must be fast, if not,

He must be clever, if not,

He must be wise, if not,

He must die.�

&nbsp;

The
Path of Man

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

��������� The journey home was uneventful. Alfred made some small
talk about life on the farm but did not ask any questions about Jenny. Boris
was glad; he�ll have a hard enough time as it is with his father.

��������� When you say �desert planet�, people from Earth always have
images of soft sand and beautiful dunes under a yellow sun. That was
unfortunately not Thordaw. Baked under the twin suns of its system, the ground
is filled with cracks, as if a million small earthquakes have hit the planet. Rocks
of various sizes littered the ground beyond the city, ensuring that any mode of
transport needs to be flying or hovering. Anyone driving on wheels will have a
very sore ass the next morning and anyone walking ant distance was most likely
to die before he reached his destination. The heat and soil content also made
it impossible to grow anything on the planet. A planet like this make hard,
mean men�like his father. 

��������� Boris thought of the time, 5 years ago when he first left
the Patriarch
Alliance. He left filled with the dreams of youth. He dreamt of
a time when all humans in the galaxy under one state. Of a time when united,
humans would reclaimed their long lost status as a powerful people. Of a time,
when humanity would put aside their differences and worked for a glorious
future. That was why he left for studies in Titan. The dreams of youth and, he
now admits, the dreams of a fool. 

��������� It did not take him long to see how difficult his task
would be. Citizens of the Terran Empire believe that people in the Outer Rims were
primitives. Without the long culture and enlightenment of Earth, all they could
do was copy the culture of the Waliens and the Corans. Even Terrans who had the
same dreams as him, firmly believed that the people of the Outer Rims must rid
themselves of aliens� influences�in order to be truly human. The fact that
humans might have something to learn from the Waliens and the Corans was
something that their Terran pride would never accept.

��������� And so he found himself. An alien among humans. 

��������� Then he met Jenny. Social Studies class. He was in front of
the class, telling them about life in the Alliance, about the difference between men and women. The
looks of disgust on the faces of his female classmates were unmistakable. Then
he saw Jenny. She looked curious and very interested in his talk. Boris has
always heard men talk of �hunting women�. Maybe it was because he was tired and
angry, but on that day, he finally understood what they meant. And the hunt
began.

&nbsp;

��������� The family farm was near New Dawn City and it didn�t take them long to reach it. Once the
truck pull into the garage, Boris got out of the truck�and immediately into a
hug.

�Hello mother,� Boris
whispered to the cow. The one person in the family he wanted to see more than
anyone.

�I thought you were never
coming back,� the cow said in a voice that was nearly breaking. 

�Of course I�ll come back,� in
truth, Boris thought the same thing when he left. He pulled his mother off him.
�This is home.�

The
face of his mother could have lit up every city in the Alliance. Without a word, his mother fell to her knees. Hands
and elbows on the floor, she lowered her head till it touched the floor. 

Looking
around, Boris saw that every female in the garage, excluding Jenny, had
followed his mother�s example. Females acknowledging the fact that as a male,
he is superior to them in everyway. Alfred was smiling at the side. A wave of
power swept through Boris. 5 years ago, he would have been embarrassed by the
situation, now he felt that this was only right. �All cows may rise.� he said. The
Family Position was how a Thordawan female greet a male member of her family. Even
a mother greeting a son she has not met in 5 years. 

�

Waiting
for them to get to their feet, Boris called Jenny over, �Jenny.� Jenny went up
behind him.

�Mother,
this is Jenny. I�ll make her my first. Jenny, this is my mother.� The look on
both women�s face was priceless. His mother because her son finally decided to
take a first wife, Jenny because she just saw a mother debasing herself to her
own son. �Jenny will learn the rules of the family and you will teach her,
Mother.� Boris continued without pause. �Jenny, you learn from my mother and
learn her lessons well. Am I clear?� Both women, Jenny after a short
hesitation, bowed their heads. 

�Boris,� Boris looked over at
Alfred. �Father want to see you.� No reason to delay the inevitable. Boris
walked over to his brother at the side of the garage and saw a lift.

&nbsp;

�This is new. When did you
guys put this in?� Boris asked

�2 years ago. The man who
married Siti as his second put it in for us as a marriage gift.�

�Where is our sister now?�

�Kadir. Rothoame City to be exact.� The lift went up a floor and stopped at
the family workshop. Boris saw his father for the first time in 5 years. Like
looking into a mirror, the man in front of him looked just like him, only
older�meaner. 

&nbsp;

�Boris�

�Father�

�Alfred said you bought a
woman back. An Earth woman?� Just like that an argument would begin; Boris
wondered why he thought this time will be different. Abram Frings has not
changed a bit.

�Yes, she will be my first.
And she is from Talon, not Earth�

�An Empire woman cannot be a
first wife of a Thordawan man. Problems always follow.�

�Jenny understands the
culture and agrees to the marriage. I am not a slaver; no one is forcing anyone
to do anything she do not agree to.�

�Jenny?� The question was to
Alfred.

�Blond hair, hazel eyes,
thing of beauty. And half a head taller than me any of us.� Boris wondered
about Alfred�s reply. How his brother really felt about Jenny. Time to finish
this before it got any worse.

&nbsp;

�I�m not asking for your
permission, father.�

�What?� The surprise was
genuine. His father was never a good actor.

�I can take anyone I want as my
wife. I ask for your blessing and I would like to stay here with the family�but
if you are displeased, I�ll take Jenny and live in the City.�

�You will live in New Dawn City and abandon your family again?� 

�No. I rather live here but I
have no desire to work on the energy farm father. I will work in the city but
live here, with your permission of course.�

�Your first?�

�She will work on the farm.
There�s always work to be done here�

�She agreed to be a Thordawan
cow. To work on the farm out of her own free will?� 

�Yes. We will live as the
holy books said. Husbands as masters, females as the animals they are.�

�What if I work her to
death?�

�You work her more than you
should and I will take her and leave for the city.�

�You threatening me, boy?�
His father was beyond surprise, well into the realm of shock.

�Your blessing father. Not
your permission.� Boris looked at his father eyes and knew he had won. Abram
Frings looked at his second son as if he has never seemed him before. In a way,
that was true.

�Done. You can stay and the
Earth woman...�

�Talonese�

��ok, Talonese woman can stay
as well. But I will not give my blessing until I see her work. And how well she
can follow the rules.�

�I expect nothing less.� It
was actually better than Boris expected.

�Told you,� this was from
Alfred. A big smile on his face. �The boy has returned a man.�

�Yes, you did,� his father
still sounded surprise. �What happened Boris? You are different. What cause the
change?�

His
father used his name. Which meant that he accept him as a man, not a boy as he
always called him. �I learned the ways of the Empire,� he finally said, �and
how different I truly am from them.� Both men looked at Boris. �It will be a
long story.�

�The night is still young.�
Alfred is not taking no for an answer.

�Start talking Boris.�
Neither is his father. And so he told, about the 5 years of disappointment and
the one good thing of his life in that dark time.

The Patriarch Alliance were
among the planets lost to the Walien Theocracy in 7816� the planets had taken
the alien�s social, political and even religious doctrine as their own. Most
humans consider the humans of the Alliance more alien then human.

The Outer
Planets, 

The Lost Terran Empire 

����������������������������������������������� ���������������������������� Published in Year
8024

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

��������� �You
hungry?� The woman asking Jenny sat on the floor. �There�s still some food in
the kitchen.�

�No. We ate on the transport.� Jenny looked around her
as she settled on the floor. The room was big. After Boris left with Alfred,
his mother half-drag Jenny into the kitchen. A downward staircase from the
kitchen led to the current room Jenny was in. Jenny saw many single beds with a
small cupboard placed in front of every bed. There was however no chairs, so
Jenny and every woman in the room were sitting on the floor in the centre of
the room.

&nbsp;

�Should we be talking?� Jenny asked. �No speaking
unless spoken to.�

�Cows are allowed to speak first in the kitchen, in
the bedroom and in the pen,� the woman replied kindly.

�Pen?�

�This room. The cows� room.�� 

�This is called the Pen.�

�Where all cows sleep, till her man call her to his great
presence.� Another woman spoke. She wore the same outfit as Zhang only without
the hood. Once in the house, Zhang took her hood off as well.

&nbsp;

Just like an
animal. Jenny was proud that she
managed not to shutter.

&nbsp;

�Where does Boris sleep?�

�Upstairs. In his room, of course.� Boris� mother
sound surprised at the question.

�So the men has their own rooms�while the women sleep
together.�

�Yes�and we are not women. We are cows�

�That doesn�t sound very fair.�

�We are cows,� Boris� mother smiled. �They are men. Glory
to the man. It is only right.�

��OK�

&nbsp;

Glory to the
man? What the hell does that means?

&nbsp;

�A lot to take in, isn�t it?� Boris� mother asked
kindly.

�Yes. May I ask a question?� The look on the women�s
face told Jenny she�d made a mistake. �Did I say something wrong?�

�Nothing major,� the mother assured her. �Cows should
always speak of themselves in the third person. Try never to use �I�.�

�And call yourself something low and useless.� The
woman that spoke was Zhang. �For example, you should say something like �Can
this worthless piece of meat ask something� or �Could this stupid beast ask
something�� All the other women nodded their head in agreement.

�Oh.� She was
right. It was a lot to take in. �Can this worthless cow ask something?�

�Of course dear,� Boris� mother smiled again.

�What�s your name?� 

The women all stopped. Jenny
was afraid that she had made another mistake�then the room exploded. Every woman
in the room was laughing her guts out.

&nbsp;

�She got you there Mary.� �She too happy after seeing
her son.� �Not bad for a first timer.� Everyone was talking at the same time.

�Ok, OK. Everyone calm down,� Mary said, though in
truth she was having a hard time controlling herself as well. Looking at Jenny
after a long time, she said. �Sorry. You�re right, introductions first. This is
Mary of Frings, second of Abram, mother of Boris, mother of Daniel. My true name
is Useless� Mary bowed her head slightly as she spoke.

�Second? That means you are the second wife?�

&nbsp;

Boris didn�t
tell me that

&nbsp;

�That�s right. Sonia here is first.� Mary pointed to a
much older woman beside her.

�This is Sonia of Frings, first of Abram, mother of
Alfred. My true name is Worthless Cunt�

��This is Glory
of Frings, third of Abram, mother of Chan, mother of Elrond. My true name is
Used Pussy.�

�What is a true name?� Jenny asked quickly. She was
very interested in why they keep calling themselves these horrible names.

�Your name is the name your father gave you when you
are born. When you marry, your husband will rename you. This is your true name.
The name only your new family would know. No one else.�

�Oh�something liked a family secret.� 

�That�s right.� Mary smiled again.

&nbsp;

They are
smiling? After all that!

&nbsp;

�This stupid cow is Zhang of Frings, first of Abram,
mother of Avery. My true name is Faceless Whore.� 

�That�s Avery?� Jenny asked. Pointing to the baby
Zhang was carrying.

�Yes, cute isn�t him.� A mother�s pride was evident on
Zhang�s face.

�This is Kris of Frings, second of Abram. My true name
is Piss Drinker.�

�This is Roc, daughter of Abram Frings.�
�This is Yancy, daughter of Abram Frings.�

��������� Roc and
Yancy were dressed differently from the rest of the women. Roc had on a
sleeveless red dress with a gold bodice. The dress was cut at mid thigh. Yancy
had about the same outfit, only it was a blue dress with a light-blue bodice. Both
dresses were very eye-catching.

�You�re Boris� sisters.� Jenny asked. �He said he has
3 sisters.�

�Siti is a worm now,� Mary said. �Roc�s my daughter,
Yancy is Glory�s.�

�Worm? What�s that?�

�A female of Kadir. Females are called worms on that
planet.� Sonia replied.

��So, women are
called differently on different planets?� Jenny was surprised. Boris never said
anything about this�again!

�Yes. On Thordaw, cows. On Kadir, worms. On Whiteside,
pigs. Don�t worry; most outsiders make the same mistakes.� Mary assured her.

�And treated differently as well.� Kris added. 

�Differently? How?� This was something new to Jenny.
Her research never said anything about this.

�Jobs, education and the females are dressed
differently as well,� Mary replied. �By the way, how tall are you?�

�1.84m. Why?�

�We�ll get you a toh-an tomorrow.� Mary looked at
Sonia. �We got anything her size and height?�

�Size yea. Don�t know about height� Sonia replied.

�So she�ll be showing a lot of leg,� Kris said. �The
men won�t mind.� Kris was smiling at Jenny with a hungry look in her eyes.
Jenny, with a start, realized that she was not the only one.

�What�s a toh-an?� Jenny wanted to move the conversation
along.

�What Roc and Yancy are wearing,� Mary said. �All
unmarried female wear the toh-an. When married, you wear the toh-gan.� Pointing
at the grey oversized (and very uncomfortable-looking) robe she�s wearing.

�Oh�but we are getting married?� Jenny knew Boris long
enough to know how stubborn he can be. She has no doubt that they will be
married.

�No ceremony, no test. So you are unmarried.� Mary
said.

�OK,� Jenny said. Something must have showed on her
face. Mary reached over and touched her hand.

�Don�t worry,� she said kindly. �Glory to the man.
Boris is smart. He would not ask you to come to Thordaw if he think you can�t
handle things.�

�He is smart.� That is true. Boris is one of the
smartest man Jenny knows.

&nbsp;

�He is strong,
He is smart, 

� He is fast, He is wise,

� He is My man, 

� He is My master, 

� He is My God�

&nbsp;

��������� Every
woman in the room intoned the chant. One that Jenny knows. 

&nbsp;

Time to impressive
them that I�m not a total idiot.

&nbsp;

�That�s the 8th chant in the Way of the
Female, isn�t it?� Jenny tried to sound as innocent as possible.

�Yes.� Mary looked shocked. �You know the chants?�

�Only the nine major ones. Boris insisted that I
learnt them along with some positions.�

�Glory to the man. Your man is wise.� This was Zhang.
She sounded impressed.

�Jenny?� Glory said. 

�Yes�

�Answer me with the first thing that comes to your
head.� Glory looked serious. 

&nbsp;

She�s going
to ask me a question.

&nbsp;

�Ok�

�Which chant do you most agree with?�

�The 5th.� The answer was out before she
could do anything. 

All the women looked at Jenny.
Some nodded their head, some didn�t. Everyone intoned the 5th chant,

&nbsp;

������������������������������������� �All
woman are cows,

������������������������������������� � Cows are weak, cows are stupid,

������������������������������������� � I am a woman,

������������������������������������� � I am weak, I am stupid.

������������������������������������� � I am a cow.�

&nbsp;

��������� Jenny
was surprised that she had chanted along with the women. �Is that important?� she
asked on one in particular.

�Very important.� Sonia said.

�Why?�

�The chant a cow most agree�� The answer was never
completed.

�MAN!� Jenny didn�t know who shouted but without hesitation,
every woman turned toward the door and fell to their knees. Heads flew to the
floor and everyone assumed the family position. Jenny was not going to be the
only one sitting when everyone was bowing. She assumed the position as well.

�Cows.� The voice belonged to Alfred.

�Yes, Sir.� It sounded to Jenny that everyone had
shouted the reply.

�Father will have Useless today. I will take Faceless
Whore,� Alfred said. �Lights out in 15mins.�

�Yes, Sir.� Again the reply was shouted back. Jenny
heard Alfred walking away. She was not going to risk a look. When the footsteps
were on the stairs, Mary and Zhang jumped up and ran to the back of the room.
There was a shower at the back along with a sink. There was also a hole in the
ground for the toilet. Several mirrors lined the back wall. Mary took off her
toh-gan and jumped into the shower. Zhang was brushing for teeth furiously at
the sink. All these were happening right in front of Jenny. There was not a
single door for modesty. 

&nbsp;

�What�s going on?� she asked. 

�Mary and Zhang will serve their men tonight,� Sonia
said. �They need to get ready.�

�This is what Mary said earlier?� Jenny asked. �The
man pick, then the woman go up to their room to �serve?�

�Yes and we are not women.� Sonia said. �We are cows.
We are worthless pieces of meat that are useless unless we are in the presence
of a man.� It was then that Jenny first discovered that the woman�cow called
Sonia was a very religious female.

�Oh.� Jenny saw Mary and Zhang switch positions. �What
about me? I mean with Boris?�

�Did you spend the night with him last night?�

�You can say that. We were together in the transport.�
Jenny saw that everyone was preparing for bed.

�A cow may not spend 2 nights in a row with her man,�
Sonia was smiling as she said that.

�WHAT?� Jenny was in disbelief.

�In the spirit of fairness, no cow may spend 2 nights
in a row with her man.� Sonia continued, �That way, all the cow in the house can
spend one night every 5 days with their man.�

�So, the rules are that you get to spend one night
every 5 days with your man?� This could be harder than Jenny thought. �One fuck
every 5 DAYS?�

�No, of course not!� Sonia was laughing again. 

&nbsp;

Why do they laugh
so much? They should be crying!

&nbsp;

�A man can have his cows anytime he wants. He just
have to�fuck as you say it, every cow he has at least once every 5 days.�

�So,� Jenny think she is beginning to understand. �A
man can have a max of 5 wives and he has to screw everyone he has at least once
every 5 days?�

�Yes�

�And he can screw them twice in a row?�

�He can do whatever he wants.� Sonia replied. �He just
have to make sure he is not neglecting anyone.�

�So in the spirit of fairness, he is not allowed to
spend 2 nights in a row with any 1 cow? Even when he only has 1 wife?� Jenny
saw that Mary and Zhang are putting on make-up.

�Yes. That�s right.�

�What if he wants to spend the night with the same
wom�cow� Sonia�s look told her to change her sentence to �cow�. 

�Men has rules just like cows,� Sonia replied
patiently. �They must follow their rules just like we follow ours.�

�If they don�t want to?� Jenny was very uncomfortable
sleeping alone on her first night in Thordaw. �You said that they can do what
they want. Right?�

�Men has rules.� A look of sadness crossed Sonia�s
face. �A cow that disobey the rules get punished. A man that flout the rules
get death.�

�A death sentence?� Boris told Jenny that the men of
the Patriarch Alliance has laws that they were harsh, but never this serious.
�For something like this?�

�It is not unheard of.� Sonia looked at Jenny and
said, �In some ways, pigs, cows and worms are more protected under the laws
than men are.�

�Ok. Then I sleep here?�

�This bed.� Sonia pointed to the bed in question. �It
used to belong to Siti.�

�My luggage?�

�Useless.� Jenny grasped at the woman. �You will wear
the toh-an tomorrow and everyday till you are married. Then you will wear the
toh-gan.� Sonia said not unkindly. �What you have belong to your man. Your man
will provide, you will serve, what you have before you came to your knees are
useless in your new life as an animal of your man. Your man will order you,
command you, and protect you. You will obey, you will understand, you will
care. You will suffer and you will be happy. Nothing else matter.�

Jenny stood there shocked.
Beyond shocked. She was very turned-on by Sonia�s speech and that was more surprising
than anything that has happened.

�Sleep tonight.� Sonia said kindly. �Tomorrow you serve.
And you will love your new life.� For some reason that she can�t understand,
Jenny believed her.�� �

&nbsp;

The Path of
Man

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

He woke up in his old room.
Rising up, Boris Frings knew that he made the right decision coming home. He
had never slept some peacefully in the 5 years in the Terran Empire. The soft
bed and old room remained Boris what he lost when he left. The intercom
sounded.

�Up and about yet soft bones?� It was Alfred�s voice.

�Who are you calling soft. Old Man?� Boris said. 

�It�s 5am
in the morning and you are still in bed! That is a mark of a soft man if ever.�

�This coming from a man who once slept till 2 in the
afternoon!�

�I was drunk�and I might add still a boy then.�

�Just get him down for breakfast.� The shout was from
their father. Abram Frings was not too keen with the way the conversation was
going. 

�On my way,� Boris replied. He was surprised at how
easy it was to fall back into the old way of life.

&nbsp;

��������� Boris
went to the bathroom and washed up. He then put on his shirt and pants. A
typical Thordawan outfit. The pants were in light-blue with the gold
long-sleeve shirt over it. The shirt and pants were wide, soft and very
comfortable. Boris left his room and headed down to the dining room. The house
was a two-storey building. The uppermost floor was basically spilt into 2 parts.
The 3 men�s room, the guest room and the study were on one side, and the
workshop on the other. Two stairs led down. One led to the kitchen, used mostly
by the cows, and one to the dining room. Going down to the dining room, Boris
was treated to a marvelous sight. There was a big rug in the centre of the
room. A low table was in the centre of the rug and a feast was on that table.
His father and Alfred were sitting on the rug having their breakfast. Around
the rug were all the cows of Frings. Every cow was in the family position with
their head pointed towards the table. Knowing the way of the family, no one
will get out of their position till the men had finished their meal. Boris saw
Jenny at one side of the rug kneeling with his two sisters. He took his seat at
the table. 

�Finally up uh?� his father gruff voice asked.

�You could have waked me.�

�And make you lost your beauty sleep?� Alfred was
enjoying this. �Not likely.�

�Coffee� Abram lifted his cup. Boris heard someone
crawling to the kitchen. The cow in question then ran back to the dining room
with a pot of coffee in hand. Once she reached the rug, she went to her knees
and crawled to the men. She poured the coffee into Abram�s cup. �Enough,� his
father said. The cow stopped pouring and then crawled back to the edge of the
rug. Once there, she got up and ran to the kitchen. After putting down the pot,
she crawled back to her position in the dining room as fast as her hands and
knees could take her and assumed the family position again. It was Glory. 

�Just like old times.� Boris said.

�They are cows,� his father said. �They live to serve.
Do you agree?�

It was an old argument between father and son. Old as
in past tense. 

�Yes I agree.� Boris said. The look between his father
and brother told Boris just how much he has changed.

�You registered yet?� Alfred asked.

�Later. Then I�m going to the city.�

�Where are you going today?� his father asked, never
liking the city at all.

�Confirming some job interviews and then I am going to
the temple.�

The men nodded their approval. �

&nbsp;

The rest of the meal past
without incident. Mostly Alfred and his father spoke about the energy farm.
Boris avoided the conversation like the plague. After the meal, Boris used the
computer in his room to enter the registry at City Hall. Updating the system,
he registered his residence at the farm and informed them of his permanent
stay. After that was done, he confirm the time and place of his interview at
the spaceport. He then changed and went downstairs. He saw the cows having
their breakfast. 

The cows were on their hands
and knees in the kitchen. In front of each cow were 2 dog dishes placed on the
floor. Boris knew that one of the dishes has water while the other contained
some meat substance. Boris never asked what the meat was made of. Their heads
were lowered to their meal. Animals do not use their hands. He saw Jenny
talking to Sonia and Mary. He was glad she was doing well. Jenny saw Boris then
and they shared a smile. Sonia then touched Jenny on the arm and Jenny�s head
lowered to her dish. 

Boris left the kitchen and
went to the garage. The family has 4 vehicles. 2 trucks, a hover-bike and a
small jet for long distance travel. Boris took the bike. The trip to New Dawn City was short. The hover-bike is much faster than the
truck and Boris was always a fast rider. He saw the huge Temple easily. Landing at a nearby public car-park, Boris
walked towards the Temple of Manhood.

He heard the screams before he
saw it. In front of the entrance of the Temple was the Temple Square. There were 10 X-frames placed alongside one another
in the square. 8 of those frames were currently occupied. A cow was tied to
each of those 8 frames and they were secured tightly. Behind them, a monk was
whipping each of the cows with a long laser whip. Each laser whip was about 3
meter long. When struck, the pain the cows feel was great. Boris also knows for
a fact that the whip give off an electrical charge when it connect with the
skin, furthering the pain. 

The cows on the frame were
there for a reason. Crimes by cows were not unheard of. Usually, the punishment
is carried out by the cows� guardian. This was the cows� father, husband or
son. However, for serious crimes like murder, treason or fraud, the state carry
out the punishment. As the death sentence is not allowed for females, the
punishment for serious crimes is usually changed to heavy labor and whipping.
The cows on the frames were all convicted of serious crimes and the monks were
making them regret it. Hitting with gusto, the monks left red marks all over
their cows� body. Each cow has a daily no. of strikes she must endure, ranging
from 50 to 100, depending on the crime.

As is usually the case, there
was a crowd. Men bought their cows along for the viewing. Standing behind their
men, the cows see the X-frames and the punishment for them if they ever even
imagine committing a crime. Men can also rent the X-frames for a period for
public whipping. The men were showing their cows the price of failure. It is a
very good threat. 

Boris took a moment to see the
whipping. He knew of men who could classify the screams into the categories of
good, beautiful or exquisite. He never knew what they were talking about. To him,
the screams were just loud. He remembers the first time he hit Jenny. 

&nbsp;

They were in her room and he
was holding a leather belt. He was angry with her and told her to strip. She
refused and screamed at him. The belt flew and hit her tits. She screamed again.
He threw her facedown onto the floor and put his knee on her back, pining her
to the ground. The belt hit her ass and a loud crack echoed across the room.
Again and again, the room echoed. Spent, Boris got up and saw her on the floor
crying. Only one word could describe his feeling then. POWER! He tore off her panties
and entered her. She was very wet. She came before he did�and came again when
he finally cum. It was short but intense. The best fuck both of them ever had.
From that day on, she was his.

&nbsp;

Boris knows that Jenny would
never disobey him, but he is unsure about other men. A cow must obey all men in
her family and he was not the only man in the family. He will bring Jenny along
for the next whipping.

Boris left the square and
walked to the Temple of Manhood. It was a huge building. The size of a small football stadium, it was
a 15-storey high building with a number of underground floors. It was the most
beautiful building in the city. City Hall was bigger, the local Military
building was more impressive, but the Temple was the most beautiful. Using the public terminal in
the entrance, Boris found the man he was looking for. He was in his private
chambers.

No cows were allowed in the Temple but men have free access, so Boris went to the chambers
without incident. The door slide open and he saw his uncle. Kiki Frings was a
brother of Abram, but instead of entering the family trade on the farm, he
decided to enter the monastery. About the height of Jenny, Kiki was a strong
man with lean muscles. A martial arts and weapons expert, he, like all monks,
strove to be the embodiment of the prefect man. Like his father, Kiki was a
hard man. He has 2 cows of his own which he use without mercy. The cows were
happy as they belong to a man that strove to be strong. You do not marry a monk
of the Temple without knowing that pain will be your life. That monk
also has a huge smile on his face.

&nbsp;

�Boris!� His uncle gave him a big hug.

�Uncle! How are you?�

�Good. Very good in fact. Come in. When you got back?�

�Yesterday night. Father told you I was coming back?�

�Of course! We had a bet going, you know. I told him
you�ll be back sooner or later. You just made me a little money yesterday.�

�Glad to help.� Boris replied. Maybe his uncle knew
him better then he know himself. 

&nbsp;

His uncle asked about Titan
and his past 5 years. He was surprised by Jenny but told Boris that he was a
man and could do as he wish. That�s why Boris had always liked his uncle.
Support. Finally the small talk was over and the serious questions began.

�So�why are you really here.�

�Can a man visit his uncle?� The look on his uncle�s
face told Boris he did not believe that for a single second. 

�I know you better than that. Why are you here on the
first day of your return?� his uncle asked. �You have something to tell me?�

��Are you still
a member of the Temple council uncle?�

�Yes.� 

The Patriarch Alliance has a
President and a Vice-President elected by the men of the Alliance. Below them, they were advised by the 5 branches of
the government; the merchants (Trade), the scientists (Research), the police
(Law Enforcement), the soldiers (Military) and the monks (Temple). Boris� uncle was a high ranking member of the Temple. Not the top, or even in the top 10, but high enough
to easily be in the top 50. He can get things noticed. 

Boris took a moment to compose
himself. This was not going to be easy. �I believe,� he finally said, �that the
Terran Empire will soon attack the Outer Rims.� His uncle was shocked�but he
recovered. �Explain, Boris.�

So he did, about the 5 years
in the Empire, the military build-up in the Empire, the views of the Terran,
the money that will be made by the war merchants and finally the desire to
regain past pride and glory. His uncle grew grave as his story grew and finally
said, �I believe you Boris.�

&nbsp;














It was a daily ritual

�At the height of its glory,
the Terran Empire consists of 82 habitable planets. We found many alien
civilizations, of which only 10 were space-faring. All were defeated. The Corans
were the 11th. They were reptilians with a resource rich planet. An
excurse was found and war was declared. Sadly, we discovered that we were not
the first aliens the Corans had ever met.�

&nbsp;

The
Outer Planets, the Lost Terran Empire 

����������������������������������������������� Published
in Year 8024

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

It
was a daily ritual. Sonia and the cows in the Pen woke up around 4am. They did their morning routine in the Pen�s bathroom
and went up to the kitchen. Prepared the breakfast, arranged the table and
waited for the men to come down. They arranged themselves around the rug and
fell to their knees. Zhang and Mary joined them from upstairs.

Abram
and Alfred came down first, around 4.30am.
The cows lowered their head to the ground. The men sat down and had their
breakfast. Boris came down later. The 3 men talked. Anytime they wanted
something, a cow would crawl to the kitchen and take it for them. Glory to the
man, this was only right.

After
they had finished, the cows cleared up and prepared their own breakfast. Each
cow has 2 dishes. There were some problems with Jenny as she does not have any
dog dish. But that was easily settled as the family has some extra dog dish
around. The food and water was poured into the dishes. The cows fell to their
hand and knees and ate like the worthless animals they were. Jenny had some
problems as she had never done this before, but she did not complain and tried
her best to eat the food in the same way. 

Maybe
she was just hungry.

Mary
was encouraging the new cow, offering advice on how to best do it. Sonia, to
her own surprise, did the same thing. Sonia had discovered that she quite like
the new cow. Jenny was beautiful, obedient and absolutely in love with Boris.
Glory to the man, Boris was truly smart. He has picked well. Boris came down
then and saw Jenny. They shared a look, a smile�and Sonia knew there was still
some work to be done.

The
relationship between a husband and wife, in the Alliance, is a relationship between a man and his animal.
Whether you call them cows, pigs or worms, one thing does not change. Females
are not humans. Females are animals. Crawling at the feet of the man you love
is the best any female can hope for. The smile told Sonia that Jenny still
thought of herself as a wife, a human, a woman. 

Sonia
decided then that she will pay special attention to Jenny, to teach her the
role of a proper cow. She touched Jenny�s arm and told her to lower her head as
a cow do not look into the eyes of her master. Jenny did so without question.
Sonia smiled. It will be the first of many lessons.

&nbsp;

Later�

��������� It was a daily ritual. Mary took off her toh-gan and stood
in the punishment position. Legs apart, she stood straight and lock her hands
behind her head. Her elbows were parallel to her body and she thrust her tits
out. Sonia showed her the cane and Mary kissed it. Sonia stepped back and delivered
the first hit on Mary�s ass. 

The pain was great but Mary
managed to shout out the phrase. �One! Thank you.� 

The second hit struck her
back. �Two! Thank you.�

The third hit struck her
belly. �Three! Thank you.�

The fourth struck her right
tit. �Four! Thank you.�

The fifth struck her left tit.
�Five! Thank you.� Mary mentally prepared herself for the final 2 hits. The
most painful ones.

The sixth hit struck her face.
�Six! Thank you.� Mary screamed. Only one more to go.

The seventh struck her pussy.
��Seven! Thank you.� 

Mary
held the punishment position and tried to get her breath back. Sonia went on to
deliver the Seven Strokes to Glory. Behind her, Mary can clearly hear Zhang delivering
the Seven Strokes to Kris. The Seven Strokes was a daily beating the cows gave
each other. Every morning after breakfast, each cow should receive the 7
strikes of the cane. This is for their own good. If they fail to please their
men today, the punishment will be much harsher than 7 strokes. The Seven
Strokes will teach them to know their place and remain them of their lowly
position. To remain them, the price of failure

Mary
gingerly put on her toh-gan. She turned around and saw Jenny sitting on the
floor with Roc and Yancy. As unmarried, they will not be receiving the Seven
Strokes. Jenny was looking at Zhang and Kris in terror. Mary could understand
why. The relations between the 2 cows were never good; Zhang was beating Kris
with relish. Mary saw Zhang gave the cane to Kris. Kris will now return the favor
to Zhang. Sonia came over and hand the cane to Mary. Mary took it. She hoped
Jenny wasn�t too scared by all this.� 

Her
master had given strict instructions yesterday on the new cow.

&nbsp;

Later�

It
was a daily ritual. Alfred would load the cows in the truck and drive them to
the farm. He would then unload them and give each of them a wide broom. 

The
family farm was an energy farm. It consists of 12 solar panels, connected side
by side with each other. The panels would catch the rays of Thordaw�s twin suns
and convert it to energy. The energy would be stored in a Walien crystal below
the panel. That was where his father is right now. Abram would change the
crystals whenever one was filled. He would also make sure that the panels were
working properly. Alfred�s job was to make sure the cows were working properly.
�

Thordaw
was not only a planet with a lot of sun; it was also a planet with a lot of
wind. Hot wind kicks across the planet daily, throwing sand and dust in its
wake. Needless to say, a solar panel with dust on it doesn�t work very well.
That�s where the cows come in. With the wide brooms, they would run a circuit
around the panels, sweeping off any dust on the panel. Sonia, Mary, Glory,
Zhang, Kris and Jenny, that was their job. Each cow would be in charge of
cleaning 2 panels. Since each panel was about half the size of a soccer field,
it was a lot of work, a lot of running. 

Alfred�s
job was to make sure the cows do not stop running. To help him, each cow has 2
ankle bracelets, one on each ankle. The bracelets detect movement. Basically,
the feet must be in constant motion. If any of the cows stop moving, the
bracelets would send an electric charge up her leg. Nothing too painful, but
enough to get them moving. However, there are some ways to beat the system. One
of which was what Kris was doing now. The stupid cow was leaning on the broom,
but moving her feet; jogging on the spot. Time for Alfred to earn his pay.

�You
worthless cow, what are you doing? Move your ass before I whip it off you.�
Alfred can�t see beneath the hood, but he could have sworn that he saw a look
of terror on the cow�s face. Kris immediately took off. Alfred knew of farms
that would shoot the lazy animal. With a rifle, the overseer would stun the cow
in question, leaving her wringing in pain on the ground. �Target Practice� was
what it was called. It was a fun idea that was immediately shot down by his
father. �Cows in pain on the ground cannot work� was what his father had said.
Alfred grudgingly admits that he has a point.

�Alfred looked around. All the cows were in
their toh-gan. Like faceless drones, they were running barefoot across the
panels. The only one not in a toh-gan was Jenny. Alfred looked at the cow in
her toh-an.

When
he first saw her, Alfred thought Boris had made a mistake. Like his father
said, �An Empire woman in the Alliance will not work.� However, the new cow had sort of won
him over. She was trying her best, doing all the work without complaints.
Alfred hasn�t even had a chance to shout at her yet. His father had asked him
to keep an eye on the cow and report to him his views on her work. If she
continues this way, Alfred will have nothing but good things to say about her.
Privately, he wondered whether his father will be happy to hear that.

&nbsp;

Later�

It
was a daily ritual. Roc and her sister were on daily house duty. That means
that they would clean the house and prepare the meals. At noon, the two of them took the lunches they had prepared
and walked to the farm. They placed the food near where the hover trucks were
parked. Their father came soon after. The two girls fell into the Family
Position.

Their
father ignored them and went straight to the food. He sat down on the ground
and ate slowly. Roc remained silent but was ready for any orders the man might
give. At 15, Roc was still a virgin. No man in the Alliance may fuck any woman below the age of 16 unless he has a
death wish. It is also the job of the girls� guardian to ensure that such
situations do not occurs. On that, Abram was doing a good job.

Roc
thought of her father in detail. A harsh man, Abram Frings was also in a way a
family man. His family is the most important to him and if he has to be harsh
he would, because he has to always make sure that his wives and children know
their duty to the family just as he knows his. In a year time, Roc would be
able to get married, to be a full cow of her man. Although it�s not necessary,
she wants her father blessing. She loves her father.

�Prepare
the cows� meal.� Roc heard her father�s command and saw that Alfred and the
cows were approaching. Roc and her sister immediately took out the cow�s dog
dishes. Arranging them in circle, Roc put the food into half of the dishes
while Yancy filled the rest with water. The cows got in front of their dog dish
and waited. Roc and Yancy then went to the men. They got into the Family
Position and waited. Her father and Alfred were talking to each other while
eating. Finally, her father asked the daily question. 

�Is the food ready?� 

The 2 girls answered
together, �Yes Sir. The cows are really.� 

�Begin.� The shout was for
the cows. Behind her, Roc heard the sound of the cows falling to their knees
and eating. �You may join them.� The command was for Roc and Yancy. The 2 girls
ran to the circle of cows and began eating was well.

Kneeling
on the ground with her face to her dog dish, Roc felt content. This was what
she was born to do.

&nbsp;

��������� It wasn�t what he expected, but it was quite a sight. Boris
arrived home after dinner. He ate some leftovers and spoke to Alfred and his
father about his talk with Kiki. When it was time to retire, Alfred went down
to the Pens. His father picked Glory while Alfred took Kris. Seeing that he
only has 1 cow, Boris of course took Jenny. 

��������� He waited in his room and changed. Soon after, the bell
rang. Boris could easily see over the video-com who it was but he asked anyway,
�Whose there?� 

�The cow Jenny is here to
serve her man, sir.� Jenny was on her knees waiting beyond the door. Boris took
a moment to compose himself and sat on a chair. �Enter,� He said. The door slide
open�and Jenny crawled to his feet.

&nbsp;

��������� Rushing on her hands and knees, Jenny threw herself at the
feet of her man. She kissed his feet repeatedly, all the while thanking the man
for choosing her for the night. �Thanks you sir for picking this cow for the
night.� 

Thanks you sir for letting
this worthless animal serve you. Thanks you sir, this was what this cow was
born to do�� Over and over she spoke. Jenny felt humiliated but this was, according to Sonia, the standard bedroom
greeting on Thordaw. 

According
to her, the cow will kneel at the bedroom door. Once it opens, the animal will
crawl to her master and kiss his feet. She will then degrade herself and thank
her master for the coming night. Glory to the man, this is only right.

&nbsp;

��������� Boris was not expecting this, but he was no fool. �Stop,�
Jenny stop her begging and lay still at his feet. �Standing Position,� he commanded.
Jenny jumped up onto her feet and stood straight; she lowered her head and
looked at the ground. Boris looked at her and was filled with pride. Here was a
24 year old woman from the Empire and she was all his. �Drop your toh-an and
get into the Inspection Position,� He said.

&nbsp;

��������� Jenny almost tore off her toh-an in her rush. She dropped
the toh-an at her feet and got into the Inspection Position. Legs open wide,
she bend her knees parallel to the ground. She locked her fingers behind her
head and thrust her tits out. Both her tits and her pussy were open for
inspection. Boris didn�t waste any time. His fingers rubbed against her crotch.
His question however caught her off-guard.

�How was your first day on
the farm?�

�Very tiring sir.� That much
was true. Jenny never ran so much in her life.

�Alfred was impressed with
you. He said you worked very hard.�

�Thank you, sir. Though I was
in a toh-an while the rest of the girl�cows were in their toh-gan.� Jenny bit
her lips for making that stupid mistake. Fortunately Boris chose to ignore it.

�You did well today. Feel
proud of yourself. I did.� Jenny was flying from the praise. She has made her
man proud. Boris stood up and wrapped his arms around her. �You are very wet.�

No way to deny the truth.
�Yes Sir.�

Jenny was rewarded with a
kiss. �Get in bed slut.�

&nbsp;

��������� Boris saw the beautiful thing in his bed and wonder how in
the universe can one man be so lucky. He dropped his pants and climbed in to bed.
Boris was under no illusion about his family jewels. His penis wasn�t the
biggest you would ever find; in fact you would have to say that it was at best
slightly below average. But one thing for certain, it was there. And in the
Patriarch Alliance, anyone born with one outranks anyone who wasn�t.� 

��������� Boris put his hands on the cow�s tits and slowly massage
it. Jenny open her legs but Boris waited. He want it to be memorable. He kissed
her on the lips and could feel the tits hardening. �Harder,� Jenny whispered.
Not wanting to disappoint, Boris squeeze the tits with his hands. A small cry
was his reward. This was the way with them, a little pain mix with a lot of
pleasure. With time, Boris intend to change that. Boris moved his left hand to
her crotch and rubbed it. It was very wet. Gently he entered the pussy. The
warm sensation engulfs him and slowly he thrust, as if he was afraid to hurt
her. Jenny wrapped her legs around Boris and helped pull him in with every
thrust. The rhythm increase and soon Boris was ramming it in with fury. This
was the first time they were alone since they have arrived. In fact, you can
say it was the first time they have been able to speak to one another. With all
the tension and build-up hormones involved; almost too quickly, both of them
came.

&nbsp;

��������� One thing strange about Boris was that unlike most men she
knew, Boris actually enjoy talking after sex. �So you have no problems with the
rest of the cows?� One of the main worries Boris has was how the cows would
react to Jenny.

�They are great! Sonia and
your mother are going out of their way to explain everything.� A giggle escaped
Jenny, �Almost like I�m still in school.�

�You seem to be spending a
lot of time with them.�

�Yes. By the way, your father
isn�t as bad as you think he is.�

�Why you say that?� Boris
didn�t know that his father has even spoken to her.

�He left orders with Mary
that I am to feel welcome.�

Now that was a surprise.
�Really? Mother told you that?�

�Yes,� Jenny said. �I think
it�s because of you.�

Boris considered this for a
moment. �You must work hard then. You do that and father will allow you to
stay.�

�I know,� Jenny cuddle up to
Boris. �If I screw up, it will not be from lack of effort.� This was the
opening Boris was waiting for.

�So, you are certain? About
staying?� Boris asked.

�Yes. Of course.�

�Why?� The question caught
Jenny off-guard again. She considered her answer.

�I�m not a freak here.� 

�What? You�re no freak!�

�In the Empire, I am.� Jenny
saw the look on Boris and continued, �If we told all my family and friends in
the Empire that I enjoyed pain and humiliation. What do you think their
reactions will be?� 

�Nothing good.�

�That�s right. With equal
rights, female justice and all that other crap, they would think I am insane.� Jenny
has a blissful look and her face and continued, �Here, I�m just another
faceless cow. Crawling and begging like the way all females should be. Here, I
am normal.�� 

�Crawling, begging like the
way all females should be? You had been reading the holy books?�

�Sonia lent a copy of the
�Way of the Female� to me. An interesting book, to say the least.�

�You seem to be spending a
lot of time with her.�

�Yes. She�s just great. In
fact there is a great sense of togetherness among the cows.� Another giggle
escaped Jenny, �Though if she knows we are talking like this, she be annoyed
with me.�

�Why?�

�You are a master and I am an
animal. She�ll probably think that this is wrong.� 

�You do know that if we stay,
you will live the rest of your life as a cow? An animal and a second-class citizen.
At best!�

�I know.�

�Any male in the family
walking by can order you to do anything and you will have to obey.�� 

�Yes.�

�You will wear the toh-gan? A
faceless drone working from sunrise to sunset?�

�I�m looking forward to the
toh-gan exactly.�

�I thought you believe it to
be stupid.�

�That�s before I saw it at
work.�

�At work?�

Jenny took a moment to think
out her answer. This will not be easy to explain. �Today while we were working,
I took a moment from the running and looked at the rest of the cows.� Boris
nodded his head for her to continue. 

�As I looked up, all I could
see were these gray robes running their ass off for their masters. It doesn�t
matter if they were pretty, smart, young or old, they just have to work. It
doesn�t matter if they were tired or if they were weak. They just have to run
and clean till the men say stop. The�females were just grey robes running
around. The toh-gan hides their beauty, intelligence, youth�and everything
else. They were as Sonia says, �animals�. They were cows. Without beauty,
intelligence or even eyes. Without identity, merely animals that will do
whatever their master tell them to do. The toh-gan helped in this. Without it,
they would be women who run around. With it, they were animals.�

Boris was unsure and said, �And
you will be one of these grey animals.�

Jenny shivered in his arms.
But it wasn�t from fear, �I look forward to it.�

�You will run on the panels
for the rest of your life� Boris needed to be sure.

�A tiring, sweaty,
mind-numbing, back-breaking, boring task. Perfect for a cow,� Jenny smiled.

�Someone has really been
reading the books.�

�Yes, and loving every
sentence of it.�

They couldn�t help but laugh
at that.

�So, we�re staying?�

Jenny looked at her man and
felt her love grows. She knew how very much Boris wanted to stay, but if she is
unhappy, he will leave with her. �Yes. We stay.�
