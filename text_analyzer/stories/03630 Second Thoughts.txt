Synopsis: A chance encounter with a married couple on an online alternative dating service leads to a weekend fantasy experiment that may prove to be a lot more real than Mike had ever intended. Second Thoughts

I'm not really sure when I first had the idea. I'd been a submissive my entire
  life with a very strong bondage fetish. In highschool and college this had
  translated into my visiting pro dominas in the local area. They charged for
  their services, but they were well worth it to get the chance to act out your
  fantasies. And that's what this was�a fantasy that was about to become a reality.
  I had had it in my head that being dominated by a couple- a female and a male-
  would be an incredibly erotic experience. I wasn't gay, and didn't even consider
  myself bi. In fact, he had done a remarkable job of making it sound not as
  if I'd be engaging in homosexual activity, but that I'd just be �submitting
  to a dominant person� and any acts performed were �out of respect to those
  who are dominant.� I had talked to both of them online frequently in the past
  couple of weeks. They had an ad on an alternative lifestyles personal service
  I had paid to join. I had graduated college only a few months earlier and was
  living by myself. I had a job in finance that worked me like a dog and so we
  had a rather limited window within which to act out our �scene.� 
So there I stood on the Saturday morning at the rest area off the local interstate.
  I agree that it was a seedy locale for a first meeting, but it fit the plan
  so to say. The couple would be passing through my area on their way down to
  their weekend cabin. It was about two hours south of where I waited. We had
  discussed the weekend in depth and to great detail, but in actuality, much
  had been left to the imagination. I had almost talked myself out of this on
  several occasions, but ultimately decided to throw myself into the experience.
  Besides, there was a part of me at the time that was seriously considering
  looking in to this lifestyle for myself, and I thought it best to experience
  as much of it as I could in making that decision. We had pretty much only one
  rule for the weekend, and that was that the whole thing would be a role play
  scenario from which we would not break character. We had discussed ways of
  signaling that things should cease, but for the most part I had stressed the
  importance of having very little control of my environment, and the couple
  had agreed that this would be a good idea. It would begin as a kidnapping scenario.
  My car had broken down and I was trying to hitch a ride. I would get in with
  them at which point I would be subdued and taken under their control. How this
  would happen I did not know, or as he had put it��we have to leave some things
  to the imagination.� And it was that phrase that made me both incredibly excited,
  and incredibly nervous. 
It was about four thirty and I had been sitting in my car for almost a half
  hour. It was the beginning of fall and the sun was setting much earlier now.
  I must have lost focus in my thoughts because I hadn't noticed the blue Chevy
  avalanche that was sitting in the far corner of the rest area lot. My heart
  skipped a beat as I saw it sitting there, knowing that things were actually
  about to be set in motion. With trepidation I stepped out of my car. 
For a quick description, I was 22, 5'10, 165lbs with short dark hair. That
  day I wore a pair of khaki pants and a dark blue dress shirt. I walked with
  purpose towards the truck that sat back from everybody and as I approached
  the window rolled down and there he was. 
�Can I help you?� came his voice. It now came to my attention that he had
  a southern twang to his voice. I had seen him before in the pics they had exchanged,
  but seeing him in real life was rather surreal. He wasn't a large man, about
  five-10 as well, average build with short reddish brown hair and a similarly
  colored moustache. From where he sat I could see he was wearing a sleeveless
  t-shirt. I immediately set into character, but my voice came out slightly shaky 
�M-my car�its having trouble, won't start, I pulled over here and I need to
  get to a service station or something.� I offered. 
�Well relax� he began, his voice much more calm and relaxed. �Well, we'd be
  more than happy to give you a lift, we're passing through and could drop you
  at the next station a few exits down.� 
I paused a moment considering this, I knew I was about to go past the point
  of no return. I looked into the car as if to examine and weigh the situation.
  He saw me looking and took the opportunity to introduce himself and the lady
  next to him. 
�My name's Tom, and this here is my wife Janet.� 
�Hi� came another southern twang. Janet too looked just as pictured. She wasn't
  a very attractive woman. They were both in their late forties and she had sort
  of a plump physique and a weathered looking face with short brown hair. Tom
  and Janet were a couple living a D/s relationship. Janet was the sub, however
  was inclined to switch when their play included others. This was essential
  for me. I needed a dominant female presence if I was going to do any sort of
  play that involved another male. 
�And these fellas here are Rusty and Dale� Tom said gesturing to the two blood
  hounds that currently occupied the back seat of the avalanche. I was a little
  surprised to see their two dogs, but recalled conversations where Tom and Janet
  had mentioned how they bring their dogs down to the cabin to play in the lake. 
�Well it's a pleasure to meet you, I'm Mike.� I said. �Yes I'd greatly appreciate
  the ride.� I went to open the back door and get in with the dogs. 
�Well now hold on� Tom began, �Here, Janet, why don't you drive, Mike you
  can sit shotgun, the dogs get a little testy around strangers, I'll sit in
  the back and keep em down.� He said stepping out of the vehicle. Within moments
  everyone had rearranged seating and I buckled my belt as Janet started up the
  car. We drove out of the lot and back on to the highway. No one really said
  much as the car picked up. I myself was nervous as anything. I heard Tom moving
  around in the back but I couldn't really hear what he was doing. We had driven
  for about five minutes when he spoke up. 
�Jan honey, I think you want to take this next exit.� I didn't get the opportunity
  to see what the exit was for, but just as we began to leave the highway I saw
  that it said �Scenic Overpass� 
I decided to voice my thoughts. �Um, I'm not really sure, I don't know the
  area and all, but I don't know if there'd be a service station off this exit.� 
�I'm pretty sure there was, just further down the highway.� Tom replied coolly.
  We all sat silently as the car rolled down what appeared to be a pretty deserted
  road. What happened next is still sort of a blur. I remember Janet making a
  hard turn and the car rolled off the road and down onto a gravel path that
  went into a wooded area. About forty feet in she hit the brakes. The car came
  to a quick halt. I barely had time to mutter� 
�What are we�� before Tom lunged forward. He brought his hands over the seat
  and my head and suddenly pulled a chord down across my body. He pulled it back
  by my elbows and pulling it behind the seat must have hooked the two ends together.
  I quickly realized it was sort of an elastic chord for latching things to the
  roof of a car. It pinned my arms down against the seat. Before I even had the
  opportunity to struggle his hands came back around the seat and he shoved a
  cloth over my face. His hands cupped it over my nose and mouth and firmly pulled
  back. The dank pungent scent immediately triggered something in brain�Chloroform!
  I had never been chloroformed, nor had I known what it smelled like. But all
  of a sudden I panicked, legitimately. I didn't know if this was safe, or what
  it would do to me. I tried to bring my hands up but Janet lunged over and grabbed
  both my wrists and forcefully held them still. I bucked back and forth but
  Tom held on with incredible strength. 
�mmahhmmmmmm� I mumbled. I found it difficult to breathe and I seemed to be
  fighting for air. I felt dizzy and slightly detached from my body. I remember
  thinking about how all of a sudden I didn't want to be in this car and how
  maybe this was all a bad�.and then nothing. 
I don't exactly recall blacking out. But I do recall coming to. I remember
  thinking about work and a project I had been doing of late. For the longest
  time I thought I was asleep in my bed in my apartment. But then something kept
  nagging at me. There was a very loud noise that I couldn't place drowning out
  all my thoughts. Instantly I popped too and jerked forward. All too quickly
  I was back to reality and at that moment had no idea where I was. The ground
  on which I lay was freezing. It was then that I discovered that I wasn't wearing
  clothes. And my body seemed to be vibrating. I blinked my eyes a few times
  but saw only darkness. My head felt dizzy and I went to touch my hand to it
  when I realized my hands were pinned behind me. I shook them violently and
  realized they were clasped together with what felt like a leather tie. It all
  came back to me to quickly. The chloroform�I had been chloroformed, and just
  like in every story or account I had ever read, I had awoken bound. I couldn't
  believe that I had been stripped and not conscious. I suddenly felt very vulnerable.
  Upon quick inspection I realized that I was hogtied. My ankles had been bound
  together with what felt like a similar leather tie, and my feet had been pulled
  up behind me and the ankle bonds tethered to my wrists by a connecting tie.
  I groaned and discovered the impediment to my speech. My mouth was filled with
  what felt like a rubber ball. So I had been ball gagged and as my senses returned
  I found that there were straps running along the side of my face and up over
  my head all connecting in the back. A chin strap seemed to come down as well,
  locking my mouth around the ball which fit almost perfectly. 
�mmmphh� was all I could muster when I tried. I heard the honking of a car
  horn and soon realized where I was. I was in the back of the avalanche. The
  flat bed of the truck. The roof attachment had been put in place and concealed
  me from the outside world. I was dumbfounded at how all this could have happened
  without me being privy to it. I wondered how long we had been driving as I
  tested my bonds. They were extremely strict and allowed for almost no movement.
  I suddenly became very aroused at the thought that Tom and Janet were driving
  down the highway, with other cars all around, none of them knowing they had
  a naked captive bound and gagged in their flat bed. I squirmed around in my
  bonds and was actually enjoying myself when I felt the car begin to slow. It
  was clear that we were turning off. The car made a few turns and I had to fight
  from rolling back and forth on my sides. Then it came to a halt and I heard
  the engine stop. I froze and lay very still as footsteps seemed to approach
  the back. The back latch was opened forcefully and came down loudly. The roof
  top then was pulled aside. I gazed upward and saw only the night sky. Two sets
  of hands grabbed at my shins, startling me and dragging me to the back. A flashlight
  was shone in my face. I shut my eyes as it blinded me. 
�Well, looks like our passenger is awake.� Tom's voice broke the night air. 
�He doesn't look too comfortable� replied Janet. 
�You hear that bitch�you uncomfortable?� came Tom's question. I didn't make
  a move, but I opened my eyes grimacing against the light. The night air was
  cold against my skin. 
�I asked you a question!� he said his voice raising. 
All I came back with was a defeated �mmphhh� 
�Seems that gag done shut you up nicely boh� he smirked. I felt the hands
  reaching on my legs and the strap tethering me in a hogtie was removed. My
  feet were pulled over the edge and hung there. A hand came forward from behind
  the light and something was hooked to my neck. It was then that I realized
  I had a collar around my neck. A leash pulled me forward as I heard Tom command �On
  your feet.� My feet touched the cold earth and I found myself standing upward
  between my two captors, my feet and hands still tied. The light was lowered
  and Tom and Janet came into view. I was startled to see however that both had
  on ski masks. They looked me over in silence. Tom was the first to speak again 
�You're probably wondering whats going on, well they'll be plenty of time
  to explain that later, right now you're getting a piss break, so be thankful
  and be quick about it.� He handed the leash to the masked woman and knelt down
  unbinding my ankles. As soon as they were unbound Janet gave a tug and I stumbled
  forward following her lead. Looking about I saw we were in a wooded area. The
  ground was cold and muddy beneath my feet. Janet marched me a couple yards
  back over to a few trees. Turning to me she grabbed my dick with her hand. 
�Hurry up and piss� she said and then just stood there. I looked forward into
  the blackness. There was no way I could piss with this woman holding my member,
  and I didn't really feel like I had to go anyway. Janet stood there for about
  thirty more seconds, 
�All right, well if you don't�� her voice was cut off was I shot forward a
  little urine, a little more followed and soon I found myself peeing freely.
  Janet coaxed me a long by pulling on my dick as I went. I mumbled softly into
  the gag. I finished up and Janet tugged a few more times to make sure I was
  done. 
�Lets go� she commanded and began pulling me back towards the direction of
  the car. The masked man was standing away from the car relieving himself. The
  two dogs walked about freely. I found it momentarily ironic that I was the
  only one on a leash. As I stood at attention by the car I found myself rather
  impressed with the job the two had done. I had been completely subdued and
  taken under their control, but I thought perhaps I was being too passive. I
  began to struggle with my wrist tie and try to make noise into my gag. Janet
  tugged and the leash, �Hush up,� as Tom headed back over to me. He carried
  the two leather ties in his hand. I could see his eyes through the ski mask
  as he held the flashlight lowered at his side. 
�Let's get him back in.� Within moments I was back in the flat bed with Tom
  retying my bonds and putting me back into a hogtie. 
�Hey honey, get me the hood from the behind the drivers seat.� He said as
  he secured the hogtie. He pulled it what seemed to be a notch tighter and a
  low grunt escaped as I arched my back in response. 
�That gag sure fits well, can barely hear shit outa you.� He sneered. Reaching
  towards me he grabbed my nipple and squeezed tightly. Again, all I emitted
  was a low guttural moan. �No one'll be hearing you back hear� he chided. Janet
  returned and handed something to Tom. He leaned forward and pulled a black
  sack over my head. My world went black and he tied it off attaching it to my
  collar. And then like that the two of them replaced the covering and moments
  later the truck purred to life. 
As we apparently got back on the interstate my mind began to race with thoughts
  about what lie ahead for the weekend. I recalled what we had discussed about
  my limits and their interests and for the first time it occurred to me that
  I no longer had any say in the matter. Also for the first time I started to
  realize how uncomfortable my bondage was. My jaw was beginning to ache from
  the ball gag and my wrists and ankles were beginning to go numb from being
  laced so tight. I began to wonder how much longer the drive would be and if
  I'd be kept tied up like this all weekend. It wasn't long before once again
  the truck turned off the highway, presumably we were approaching the cabin.
  The short interim made me question the necessity of a piss break, but they
  probably wanted to make sure I realized my situation and had time to dwell
  on it before we arrived, which involved waking me. The car seemed to be making
  many turns and I heard no other vehicles passing or driving behind us. The
  cabin had been described as in a pretty secluded area and this seemed to fit
  the bill. The concrete turned to gravel and became rather bumpy. I was tossed
  on my sides a few times but finally we came to a rest. The doors opened and
  I heard them and the dogs get out. The steps led away from the car and I was
  left in silence for a bit. I lay still and struggled to listen through my hood.
  After about ten minutes footsteps returned. The back was opened and within
  moments I found myself standing upright again. However this time, rather than
  release my ankles I felt myself being lifted off the ground. Tom held me under
  my arms and Janet took me by the legs. The two began carrying me away from
  the vehicle. We traveled only a short distance before I was taken indoors.
  I heard a door slam shut behind me, and then we were inside. I was put back
  on my feet and I stood there pensively. One of them took my leash and hooked
  it above my head to something with a clicking sound. It was rather taught and
  tugged at the collar. Seconds later something was attached to my wrists and
  I felt them being drawn up behind me and tied off to the ceiling as well. And
  lastly another leash was attached to my ankles and pulled tight to something.
  My hood was pulled off and I grimaced as once again my eyes had to adjust to
  the light. Facing me were my captors. The two dogs were also pacing around
  the room. Looking about I saw I was in a garage, directly in the middle. It
  was empty, since the truck was outside, save for tools and cans of paint over
  on a set of shelves. Both of my captors still wore their ski masks. Tom spoke
  first. 
�Well I'm glad to see you've quit your struggling, that'll make things easier
  for you�believe me. You're probably wondering what this is all about.� I watched
  him quizzically. 
�Me and the lady have taken a liking to you, and decided that we're gonna
  keep you and have a little fun with you�you don't mind do you?� he offered. 
I decided to protest and began to moan and I attempted to thrash about. It
  was then that I realized just how secure I was. Janet stepped forward and gave
  my face a slap. It took me completely a back. Her eyes glared at me through
  the ski mask. 
�You'll be still bitch� she hissed. I was still and they both moved closer
  to me. Tom took a firm hold of my cock and I froze. Janet meanwhile began massaging
  one of my nipples. 
�You're a long way from home boy, and we've got you tied nice and good�now we
can do this the easy way, or the hard way�but either way, we're doing it�hey
look at me when I'm talking� Tom directed as I had moved my eyes from them in
shame. I'd never had a man hold my dick and I wasn't quite sure how I felt about
it. 
�Now there's no one around for a good couple of miles, but we're gonna keep
  you gagged just for good measure.� Tom went on. 
�Unless of course we need your mouth for something� Janet interjected. 
�Oh yeah, and believe me, we will be using that mouth of yours� Tom said coolly
  as Janet traced a finger over my ball gagged mouth. I let a soft moan escape
  and put on a look of despair. Truthfully, this comment did not settle well
  with me, but at the moment it was difficult to interject. They both stayed
  close to me and I suddenly realized that both of their hands began to massage
  my cock. I soon became rock hard. 
�Look there honey, maybe he likes this� 
�Oh I bet he does� purred Janet. Tom moved his hands up to my nipples and
  began twisting and massaging them as Janet became more deliberate with her
  hand movements. 
�That's right bitch�your ours now, and we own you and that dick of yours� he
  said into my ear. I began to lose myself in the repeated stroking. I gave all
  of my bonds a short tug and grunted again into my gag. Tom grabbed me by the
  hair to steady me as Jaunts hand continued to massage me. I couldn't help but
  moan softly, a sound you could barely hear, yet Tom cupped a hand over my already
  gagged mouth. 
�Shut up� was all he said. I grunted softly into the ball and his hand and
  within moments Janet was bringing me to climax. I came hard and fast and she
  continued pumping me as Tom held tightened his grip so that absolutely no noise
  escaped as I came. When they were sure I was finished Tom walked away. Janet
  stood there watching me. I was breathing heavily and my brow was coated in
  sweat and I dodged her gaze by looking at the cement floor. The next couple
  of minutes I seemed to be in a haze. I recall very quickly deciding that there
  was no place I wanted to be less than in this couples control. I gave a faint
  struggle just to test my bonds but everything held me quite still. Tom returned
  carrying a few items in his hands. His voice broke the awkward silence. 
�Well now, there was a reason behind that. We know that right away, getting
  you off like that ends a lot of the fun for you, but it means just the beginning
  for us.� And just as I went to raise my eyes to meet his it struck me. I jolted
  and the chains held me tight. As my mind raced to figure out what just happened
  I heard the now familiar whoosh and felt a slight breeze before the flogger
  connected against me side. 
�urmmmph� was the small grunt that escaped. My whimpers continued as did the
  whipping. Time and time again, the whoosh sound followed by impact. I just
  stood there, held fast by the leash to the ceiling and the two chains at my
  legs and feet. I felt my entire body begin to glisten with sweat as he continuously
  connected. I almost felt tears swelling in my eyes as my skin burned from the
  beating. My eyes caught Janet looking at me with a devilish smile. Eventually
  Tom brought the flogger to rest and again the two were upon me, both of their
  faces in mine. 
�We're just getting warmed up, we've got a lot planned for you bitch� he grimaced. �But
  I think we'll put you away for a little bit�let you think about your situation� I
  lowered my head submissively. A string of drool from my gagged mouth dropped
  its way to the floor. The couple went to work quickly. My leash was pulled
  down from the ceiling and the chains connected to my wrist and ankle bonds
  were released. I relaxed slightly from the release in tension, but still realized
  I was completely subdued. I felt Tom behind me at my wrists. Rope was being
  wound around them, he pulled the chords tight and I felt the leather tie come
  off as the rope replaced it. He then produced additional rope and began wrapping
  it around my elbows and across my chest. As he did this Janet's fingers went
  to the harness of my ball gag. She slowly worked it loose cautioning me beforehand �If
  you so much as make a sound, you'll pay� and Tom chuckled �Or we'll find something
  else to put in that mouth that you won't like as much.� I froze at all the
  innuendo behind that comment and decided against saying anything. The large
  ball was removed from my mouth, followed by a mouthful of saliva. My jaw ached
  at the release of pressure and I found that it still seemed locked in place
  as if the gag was still in. Tom finished securing my upper body with rope and
  then went about removing the ankle tie. 
Tom knelt in front of me and commanded that I raise first one foot and then
  the other. He slid on what appeared to be some sort of underwear. As he brought
  it up I recognized the material as leather. He pulled the brief like item all
  the way up and I slowly realized what it was. It was a leather chastity belt�I
  had once seen a similar item offered for purchase on some fetish site. 
�This is to make sure we're the only ones having fun� he smirked as he began
lacing it in the back. My flaccid penis seemed to fit perfectly into a sort of
a leather sock in the front band, but as Tom tightened it in the back it hugged
my penis tightly, almost cutting off circulation. In fact it would be impossible
to achieve any sort of an erection, an experience that would prove most painful
when stimulated. I decided to speak since I had not said a word since I was first
subdued back in the car. My voice came out cracked and nervous 
�what do you want with me�mmmph� was all that came out before Tom had cupped
  his hand over my mouth from behind. 
�You don't seem to listen very well do you?� he whispered sharply. Janet got
  in my face from the front. �looks like we're going to have to shut you up again� and
  with that she produced a rag from her pocket. Raising it to my face Tom released
  his cupped hand and reaching around squeezed one of my nipples tightly. My
  mouth opened in pain and Janet stuffed the rag into it pushing it deep with
  her fingers. My cheeks bulged from the amount of cloth and it packed it so
  full that it seemed to start down the back of my throat. I heard a stretching
  sound and then jerked back as Tom brought the role of duct tape around my face.
  Pressing the end tightly over my mouth he began to wrap it around my head numerous
  times. After about five times he tore it from the roll and smoothed the loose
  end against my cheek, patting the side of my face twice. And just like that
  my world went dark again. This time I realized it was because Janet had pulled
  some sort of a blindfold over my eyes. I felt her tighten a strap in the back
  and realized it would not be easily worked off. I felt the chain of my leash
  being picked up and then a tug. 
�mmphh� I mumbled, barely able to get anything out as I stumbled forward in
  to blackness. 
�Move bitch� I heard Janet's voice and felt a smack to my behind. My feet
  moved forward awkwardly, having been bound together for so long. I breathe
  came through my nose loudly and as I was bent forward to follow the pull I
  found myself for the first time testing my new bonds. I had never felt as constricted
  as my upper body did now encased in Tom's rope work. Once again I found myself
  completely subdued. I actually found myself thinking about escape, and how
  one could in a situation like this. Once again, the actual grave nature of
  the predicament I was in came to the forefront of my mind. Here I was bound
  and gagged being dragged into the home of two complete strangers. No one new
  where I was, no one new what I had gotten myself into. For the first time my
  barefeet came upon a carpet. I also felt a warmth and sort of an oaky scent.
  It was remarkable how in just a few short hours it felt like my other senses
  had been greatly strengthened. We seemed to start and stop every couple of
  feet and I sensed that Tom was turning lights on through the home as we went.
  I felt something furry brush past my legs and realized it must be one of the
  dogs. I could hear Janet bringing up the rear behind us as she set down a set
  of keys and stopped to pet one of the dogs. 
�That's a good boy� she purred from behind. In this situation I had to stop
  and consider, who was more of an animal, the four legged pet or the hobbled
  and gagged prisoner being led around on a leash. I felt the slack on the leash
  lessen and then Tom's hand took my arm. I was forced down and thought I was
  being pushed to the ground until my bare behind touched the seat of a chair.
  My bound arms hung down over the back causing me to arch slightly. I let my
  head drop to my chest and quietly tried to work the cloth in my mouth around
  and test pushing it forward against the tape that sealed it in. 
�What do you think, rope are chains?� Janet's voice broke the silence. 
�Lets go with the chains, we're gonna want to move him from here in a little
  bit, after we get things ready in the bedroom� Tom replied. I saw this as yet
  another time when I should attempt to voice my reluctance towards this situation
  and lifted my head up and attempted to moan through the gag. I braced myself
  for what I anticipated would be the requisite slap in the face and order to
  be silent, and found myself puzzled as this did not happen. Rather I felt the
  two of them come to either side of me. They were standing very close to me
  and both of their bodies pushed up against my bound form. Hands began caressing
  my chest and fingers were being run through my hair. I tensed, suddenly very
  unsure and uncomfortable with my predicament. Tom spoke 
�You shouldn't feel to uncomfortable�its not gonna be all bad, I know you
  liked getting jerked off back there, and while that chastity belt is gonna
  keep that from happening again, we'll make sure you have some fun too.� 
�Mmmmphmmmmm� I cooed. Janet brought her face very close to mine. Her breath
  was warm against my ear. 
�The best thing for you to do is to just do as your told. We're gonna rape
  you as many times as we feel like it, and in the end, you'll be our slave.
  You'll do everything we say without hesitating. We won't need to ropes and
  the gags because you'll be ours willingly.� 
Tom picked up the speech as he began twisting one of my now tender nipples 
�We're going to train you to be our bitch. There will be punishments, but
  their will be rewards to. What you need to understand is that this is your
  life now. Your only focus should be to not disappoint us. We know it will be
  tough for you at first, and believe me, we're not going to make it easy on
  you. But over time, you'll come to love it.� 
My mind raced at these words��over time�, this is �your life.� In the back
  of my head, I knew that this was only for a weekend, at least that's what I'd
  been told. But what if that was a lie? What if this was real? They were taking
  this very seriously and had played their parts perfect up until now. Even if
  I had wanted to escape or break the game at anytime, I wouldn't have had the
  opportunity. They'd taken a great deal of caution getting me here in to their
  home, restrained and unseen, and now I paused to consider if I really did know
  these two, or what I had gotten myself in to. Tom left my side as Janet continued
  to tease my hair. The clinking sound of metal grew closer signaling his return
  moments later. The cold touch of chains greeted my naked body seconds later
  as the two of them began wrapping metal links around my body and intertwining
  them with the chair. Each of my ankles was secured to the front chair legs,
  and chains were wrapped over my lap and waist before being pulled taught behind
  me. The clicking sounds behind me indicated the use of several padlocks securing
  their tightness. 
�Well now, this will work for the time being. Janet and I are going to excuse
  ourselves for the time being, some things to get ready but we'll be back�.oh,
  but I almost forgot�one more thing.� 
A drawer was opened somewhere and I heard rustling. As Tom came back to where
  I sat I tensed up not knowing what to expect. Janet took my head in her hands
  and I felt Tom pressing something in to my left ear. It felt cold and was malleable
  as he pressed it further in to my eardrum. Apparently it was some type of clay
  or putty, but it soon filled up my inner ear crevices. He did the same thing
  on my right side, packing in the substance again and slowly my world went quiet.
  I had now lost almost all senses and was truly beyond helpless. I assumed Tom
  and Janet had left me because I no longer felt their bodies near mine, but
  for all I knew they were still standing right next to me, overlooking their
  work. I decided against testing my bonds for a bit, due to this possibility.
  I just let my head fall forward and breathed heavily in and out through my
  nose in my new world void of sight and sound. 
It started at first with my mouth. I decided one by one to test my bonds.
  I tried working the cloth inside against the tape around my head. The cloth
  was so thick inside that I could barely find a way to maneuver it. The tape
  didn't give at all. The blindfold could obviously not be worked in any fashion
  so I didn't even try. I tried shimmying my wrists against the ropes but they
  held tight. My fingers danced about looking for any sort of a loose knot or
  piece of slack but after several frustrating minutes I concluded that none
  could be found. I tried letting out as much air as possible to relax my chest
  and create slack in the chains, but they held me against the chair without
  any give. Once these excerises were complete I turned my thoughts toward my
  captors. Where had they gone and what were there plans for the immediate future.
  Could this all end right now if I wanted? Part of me extremely doubted it.
  I had given myself over to them (although a fair amount of force was required
  on their part) and in the end, this was my own doing. The feel of something
  against my chest suddenly brought me back to my present surroundings. It took
  me a moment to realize what it was. The soft material encasing the object was
  almost definitely nylon and by the circular rubbing motion I concluded it was
  a woman's foot. Janet had a foot against my chest and her toes wiggled around
  as it moved to my nipple. I let out a soft moan and remained rigid and still.
  The foot moved down to my crotch area and began nuzzling in my groin. My manhood
  immediately sprang to life but was met with the constriction of the leather
  chastity belt. I groaned at my inability to achieve a full erection as her
  teasing continued. I lowered my head submissively and tried to lean forward,
  my body seeking the soft touch of her foot. SLAP�my head shot back as it was
  struck roughly from the side. 
�Be still� came Tom's instructions, although I could barely hear this due
  to the wax substance in my ears. His voice sounded far away and drowned out,
  but I quickly fell in line as Janet continued her foot molesting. A moment
  later I felt two hands at my nipples. Since Janet's foot remained in my groin
  I gathered that Tom had moved behind me. He was pinching and rubbing them,
  tugging on the them and giving them an occasional slap. I felt a warmth flush
  through my body as the two aroused my sense of touch, one of the only one's
  I had. I found myself falling into a space where I was becoming lost in the
  moment when suddenly the slack of the chains gave loose and they fell noisily
  to the ground by the chair. I was being picked up from behind but then someone
  was at my feet. They were lifted off the ground and I was suddenly horizontal
  once again as the two were carrying me. Neither spoke so they must have already
  planned the final destination, and unfortunately for me, I was pretty sure
  I knew where it was as well. We began ascending a flight of stairs and I became
  very uncomfortable as my weight sagged against Tom pulling me upward from beneath
  my arms. Janet for her part raised my legs to rest upon her shoulder and helped
  leverage Tom's position. The two clearly worked well as a team on many levels.
  We were moving down a hallway and then I was maneuvered through a door before
  being unceremoniously dropped. I fell free for a quick second before connecting
  with what felt to be a soft and large bed. No time was given for me to squirm
  as a shackle of sorts was attached to one of my ankles and then tugged as the
  end was shackled elsewhere. Tom was at my side by my head and his fingers began
  picking at the tape around my mouth. I suddenly wished very much that I be
  allowed to keep this gag for the sole reason that it kept other things out.
  I heard Tom say allowed, 
�think of it like a bandied� and before I could contemplate what that meant
  he was tearing the tape off, unwrapping it quickly as it took with it, the
  hair around my head in little bits. 
�MMMMMAAA� I yelped. As soon as the last bit was torn loose his fingers pried
  the cloth out and it was tossed aside. I licked my lips and tried stretching
  my jaw. His fingers returned to my mouth as something was now once again being
  pressed in. The circular object was fit behind my teeth and I felt my jaw being
  forced open. Two straps were pulled around my head and it was pulled tight
  and fastened. This new ring gag I found quickly shut me up again but left my
  mouth wide and exposed. Now two sets of hands came up and pulled loose the
  wax substance from my ears. As the wax came out Janet began, 
�Now we have you just where we always wanted, this can go easily or we can
  make it very uneasy for you. Do as we say, understand?� she said in an instructional
  manner. 
I nodded my head, unsure of what would happen next. Hands continued to slide
  up and down my body and I found myself incredibly responsive. I stretched against
  my bonds and seemed to move in anticipation of touches and caresses. I felt
  my penis strain to become erect but the leather chastity belt kept it pressed
  in a half chub state, and I found this increasingly frustrating. There were
  no sounds except their breathing, very warm against my neck and chest. I jerked
  slightly as I felt a finger at my asshole. Some sort of lube was being applied
  and I fought in vain as I slowly was fingered. It was an incredibly odd and
  invading feeling and it became very uncomfortable. Two hands gripped by head
  and held it firm, an indication that I was to remain still and allow myself
  to be violated. I slowly relented to absolute helplessness. 
To say that Tom and Janet took liberties with my body given my situation would
  be an understatement. To this day I remain shocked by the lack of compassion
  or concern for easing me in to a situation I had never before been in. I lost
  complete sense of time and space as I sucked, was probed, and molested. At
  one time I found my gagged and blindfolded face buried deep in Janet's pussy
  as Tom worked me over from behind. I felt like I was suffocating as I gasped
  for hot musty air. Just my luck as they both proved to be very multi-orgasmic.
  I don't even recall when it all ended. I'll admit I was very much shell shocked.
  It finally seemed like all movement had stopped and I found myself lying alone
  panting softly. They were both still on the bed and moments later I felt something
  at my mouth. It was Janet's foot. She tapped my gagged mouth lightly before
  allowing her toes to dance under my nose and press them to my face. I slowly
  forced my tongue out through the ring, a tongue that by now felt very strained
  and stretched. I gently licked her toes and she responded with a soft moan. 
�You're learning� she said in an almost caring manner. I serviced each of
  her feet for the better part of a half hour as Tom was clearly incapacitated
  at the moment. I put up very little resistance when later I felt them both
  picking me up off the bed and dragging me across the floor. 
And that's how I found myself sitting Indian style on their bathroom floor.
  My wrists were still tied behind me with rope and the ring gag was left in.
  However my legs were untied and my blindfold had been removed. It took my eyes
  a good twenty minutes to fully adjust after being covered for what I imagined
  was at least half a day. The leash had been reapplied to my collar and it had
  been locked to a pipe at the back of the toilet. I rested my head on the toilet
  seats hard plastic lid. The light had been left on, probably so my eyes could
  regain normal function. The door was shut closed and I was alone. I occasionally
  heard the sound of sheets rustling outside and assumed that Tom and Janet were
  asleep now. At first I was slightly amazed at the lack of attention to restraining
  me to be left alone, but the more I surveyed the situation I realized that
  even had my hands not been bound behind my back, the leash had a small padlock
  clasping it to my collar and a similar padlock chaining it to the back of the
  toilet. The ring gag was kept me from actually speaking but I knew I could
  make noise through it if I needed to. However, locked in their bathroom, in
  the bedroom where they slept, in a cabin that was probably in the middle of
  nowhere, my chances weren't good of trying to call for help. I dozed in and
  out of consciousness, never being able to stay asleep for very long. My neck
  was very cramped at this point and a steady stream of drool ran from my open
  mouth down to a developing puddle on my leg. I heard movement in the other
  room and seconds later the door to the bathroom flew open. In walked Janet,
  she was completely naked and as I looked up at her less than savory physique,
  I shuddered slightly at what I had done to that woman. Her groggy gaze settled
  on me and she gave me a stern glare. I noticed that in her hand she held what
  appeared to be a brown nylon stocking. She came towards me and bending down
  quickly and expertly blindfolded me again with the stocking. Her purpose quickly
  became clear as the toilet seat was raised and her body sat down inches from
  where I sat on the floor. I turned my head away as I heard a steady stream
  of urine begin to flow. I was quite disgusted but could offer no protest, nor
  would I dare. Janet finished, flushed and before leaving yanked my blindfold
  off to rest around my collared neck. It would remain there for at least another
  three hours when the door once again opened. This time in came Tom. He too
  was naked. I averted my gaze but it was only to be for another moment before
  the stocking was pulled up over the bridge of my nose and pulled tight to once
  again conceal my vision. I sat rigidly as the master of the house relieved
  himself, and unfortunately for me, he was sitting down as well. I had become
  quite nauseous by the time Tom finished up, flushed and stumbled out of the
  bathroom. The door was left adjacent this time and my stocking blindfold left
  in place. I heard Tom connect with the bed and realized it was not yet morning.
  I tried as best as I could to curl up in some form on the cold tiled floor
  with no idea of what the future held for me. 
Part 2 
My vantage point would only change slightly in the hours to come. Still tired
  as anything, I found myself once again bare assed (wearing nothing but my chastity
  belt) on a cold tile floor. This time it was Tom and Janet's kitchen. My bonds
  had changed as well, but I was still at a distinct disadvantage comparatively.
  They had come in together, both of them naked and had gone in to the shower.
  Midway through the curtain had been pulled back and I heard the end of my leash
  unclip. I was brought in on my knees in to the small walk in shower and once
  more was subjected to oral submission. Throughout I managed to be bathed and
  appreciated that fact. I was left laying on the floor, soaking wet as the two
  toweled off and got dressed. After I had almost finished air drying the two
  of them were upon me. I was beginning to become impressed with the ease in
  which they pulled me around, however I had become much more compliant since
  my arrival. Tom pinned me face down on the ground in the bedroom while Janet
  set to work. A leather belt was looped under me and around my waist. It was
  fastened in the back and clipped to the backside of my leather chastity pouch.
  A leather cuff was fastened to one of my wrists and the other cuff lashed to
  the belt. Expertly Janet began unbinding the rope around my wrists. The moment
  I was free of it my free wrist became encircled as well with another leather
  cuff that connected to the belt as well. Both straps were tightened and my
  wrists were pulled tightly to the belt. Confident that I was once again adequately
  restrained they both got off me. The leather wrist cuffs were a welcome replacement
  to the rope that had long since begun to chafe and restrict circulation. I
  was pulled by leash to my feet. My nylon blindfold had come off in the shower
  (much to my dismay) and now all that was left was the ring gag. Tom set upon
  loosening it as I watched Janet walk over to her dresser. She came back and
  I knew all too well what the instruments in her hand were for. She carried
  another stocking in one hand and a pair of panties in the other. As I stretched
  my jaw to allow the ring gag to be pulled free Janet was at my mouth force
  feeding the panties in. They filled my mouth quite well, but did not stretch
  it as much as the stuffing from the night before. Tom took the stocking and
  wound it around my mouth two to three times knotting it tightly behind my head.
  I lowered my head in a submissive gesture as the two of them stepped back a
  moment to look over their captive. My leash was taken up and I was told 
�Come� 
I was led out of the bedroom and for the first time now was seeing the interior
  of the home. I noted now that Tom and Janet no longer felt the need for ski
  masks, so apparently the role of concealed captors was being abandoned. This
  was a sign of confidence on their part, they knew they were fully in control.
  I was lead down a long carpeted hallway that had two other doors in it. We
  reached the staircase and I was lead down in to what appeared to be the living
  room. Both of their dogs had been sitting at attention and now rose to greet
  their masters. 
�Good babies� Janet cooed as she walked forward heading them off. �Come on,
  let's go� she said and they followed her into another room at her heel. Tom
  led me in another direction towards their kitchen. I heard a screen door open
  and close and assumed Janet was letting the dogs out. Tom ordered me to my
  knees upon entering the kitchen and within moments he had chained my leash
  to a kitchen table leg. Janet returned a moment later without the dogs and
  the two of them immediately attended to fixing breakfast. Moments later the
  smell of eggs and bacon filled my nostrils. I realized for the first time now
  how parched and hungry I was. My stomach growled and I kept my eyes fixed on
  the floor hoping to block out the hunger pains. Tom and Janet conversed as
  if I wasn't even there, speaking about how they had slept and what groceries
  they would need to pick up the next time they went in to town. No reference
  was made to the gagged and hobbled figure in the leather chastity thong leashed
  to the table. They sat down moments later, Janet pulled her chair out right
  by me. They began divvying up food and morning paper sections. Without even
  glancing down at me Janet tapped me on the head and snapped her fingers at
  a pointed motion down to her bare foot. I immediately inferred what this meant,
  and not wanting to disappoint I bent my head down and put my nose to her foot.
  I couldn't provide any kisses or licks due to my gag, however I began to press
  my stockinged lips against them as a submissive gesture. She gave no sign of
  approval, merely read the paper and made the occasional side comment to Tom.
  The two made short work of their breakfasts and I was back kneeling upright
  as they tended to the dishes. After a brief period of tidying up I found them
  both standing over me. This time I raised my head and looked up at my captors.
  As usual, Tom broke the silence, 
�I'm sure last night gave you a very good taste of what life as our slave
  is like, and understand that it is our decision when and how we use you. If
  you haven't realized by now, we have covered all of our bases and you're a
  long way from home. But understand that being our slave is not a 24/7 fuck
  fest. It's our job to train you now how we see fit. For starters, understand
  that we will look after you, we will feed you and give you drink, but that
  is the extent of our kindness. Get used to your bondage, it's part of your
  life now. It's a symbol of our ownership of you.� 
He let his words set in. My mind once again drifted back to the notion that
  this was just for the weekend. By now it was clearly Saturday morning. I had
  to hold on to the fact that there could only be roughly 24-30 more hours of
  this, but I would nonetheless play along. 
Janet spoke next, 
�There are quite a few things we are eager to teach you, and eager to try
  on you. This will be a very full day which is why we are going to feed you
  now, and then let you rest briefly. Don't mistake this as a sign of affection
  on our end, we need you very attentive for the remainder of the day.� 
This was terrific news. Food and a nap. My basic human needs and desires were
  to be shortly addressed. 
�Do you want to prepare his breakfast Jan, I'll go get the dogs?� Tom offered.
  Tom took off down the hallway and Janet turned to me. 
�I'm going to take out your gag, DO NOT speak unless spoken to, do you understand?� 
I nodded my head yes and arched upward so she could undo the stocking and
  pull loose her panties. I breathed in fresh air and lowered my head once again.
  Janet turned from me and began preparing something by the sink. As she toiled
  by the sink Tom and the dogs came back in. The two of them ran over to wear
  I was kneeling and turned to stand by my side. I looked at the two dogs who
  now flanked me. They sat patiently looking over at Janet, as if going re-enacting
  a daily routine. I soon realized that this is in fact exactly what they were
  doing. Janet and Tom came over to the three of us carrying a multitude of red
  and blue dishes. They were all set down in front of us. I quickly realized
  they were the dog dishes. Written on four of them were the names �Rusty� and �Dale.� These
  were filled with what appeared to be kibble and in the others was water. The
  two dogs quickly began burying their faces in their respective dishes. Then
  two more dishes were set down directly in front of me. Written on each was �slave.� One
  was filled with water, the other had some sort of a milky brown color. I looked
  up at my captors. 
�Eat� was all Tom said looking down at me. I decided obeying was the smartest
  move and tried as best I could to lower my face to the dish. I first lapped
  some water up out of the first bowl before moving to the second. I put my face
  close and tried to smell it. I paused uncertain as to what exactly I was being
  fed. This moment's hesitation would cost me as Janet raised her foot and pushed
  my head fully into the bowl. I fell forward into the cold much. 
�We said �EAT'� she barked. I opened my mouth and once again without hesitation,
  allowed something foreign in. I discovered it to be cold oatmeal. Happy that
  it wasn't gruel I set about trying to eat with just a face in a dish. I alternated
  between the oatmeal and water as the dogs ate heartily beside me. The sight
  was not lost on me. In this home I too was clearly a dog and would not be treated
  with any greater dignity. My lower back began to ache at the odd position I
  was in and I began to take longer pauses between lowering my head for slurps,
  this action would cost me. 
�Not hungry?�well then you won't be needing this� came Janet's voice as she
  leaned in and quickly pulled away both of my dishes. I sat upright in what
  was initially protest but then thought better of it and remained quietly on
  my knees. It was by this time that I realized Tom was nowhere in my field of
  vision. His location was suddenly and harshly revealed when from behind me
  a hand shot in to view holding a damp cloth. Tom pulled it fast to my face
  and I once again realized I was being chloroformed. It's funny the things you
  find yourself thinking when something like this was happening. My thoughts
  ran the gamut of �I hope he keeps me from hitting the floor� to �I wonder if
  this has any long term effects on a person?� And while I had been working on
  being more compliant, I found myself once again responding harshly and trying
  to buck loose of his firm grip. Janet was upon me as well further pressing
  Tom's hand to my face and with my wrists locked to the belt behind me I offered
  no chance of resistance and once again the world around me began to dim. 
Coming to happened in stages. At first I became apparent of conscious thought.
  I remember thinking about work and a project I had been assigned to about a
  month ago. I think at that moment a part of me truly believed I was in my bed
  back home. It took me only a moment to realize though that the surface on which
  I lay was hard and cold. Then it came rushing back to me. Where I was, who's
  control I was under, and I suddenly determined that it was time to take stock
  of my current bondage situation. This began with the requisite attempt at arm
  movement. It was quickly apparent that I was laying on the floor somewhere
  in Tom and Janet's home and that my wrists were still leather cuffed behind
  me to the belt. I also still had on my chastity harness. A quick kick of my
  legs revealed that they were bound with chord at the ankles and at the knees.
  The fact that I was breathing in heavily from the noes clued me in that once
  again the ball gag had been inserted, and opening my eyes I felt something
  tied over them as well...probably another nylon. Resigned to my fate I now
  attempted to take stock of my environment and try and guess where I was. The
  floor felt like concrete so I wondered if I was back in the garage. I rolled
  myself a little to the right and then back to the left and deduced that I had
  open space on all sides. I wormed my way forward a bit and a moment later my
  head collided with something hard. 
�mmmggg� I grimaced in pain. As soon as the blinding light of pain disappeared
  I tried to determine what I had struck. I saddled my body up against what felt
  like some kind of furniture piece, perhaps a bureau or a dresser. I felt my
  way to the corner edge and suddenly came up with a rather ingenious idea. I
  began rubbing my head against the corner and I soon found that my blindfold
  was not tied very tightly and could slowly be worked loose. I rubbed it back
  and forth a couple of times until it fell from covering my eyes and hung down
  on the bridge of my nose. My eyes began adjusting to what was a dimly lit room.
  I rolled over to survey my surroundings and realized I was more than likely
  in a basement. There were no windows and the only light came from a dim lamp
  that sat across the room on a desk. There was a lot of old furniture lining
  the walls and I realized I had been placed in the center of the room. For some
  reason I felt good about removing my blindfold. Over the past day and a half
  it was really the only thing I had been able to successfully alter about my
  environment. This renewed sense of confidence made me think about trying to
  free myself. True I was bound and gagged in this couple's basement in an area
  I was completely unfamiliar with, but perhaps escape was worth a shot. In the
  back of my head I new this was only to last for the weekend and was all a semi-consensual
  production, but maybe I should up the ante and take the game to the next level
  by attempting a legitimate escape. For all I knew Tom and Janet weren't even
  in the home now and this would be my only chance. Fidgeting with my wrist cuffs
  let me know quickly that they were not the place to start. My gag was strapped
  in way too tightly to try and work that out by rubbing it against anything.
  I decided my best bet was to attempt to untie my ankles. Laying on my side
  I curled my knees up behind me in an almost self imposed hog tie position.
  My hands came upon my bound ankles and I began fidgeting with the rope, looking
  for a beginning to a knot tie. About ten minutes later I found what I believed
  to be the knotted end and began picking at it vigorously with my nails. Five
  more minutes and my efforts were rewarded as the knot came loose and I began
  slowly unraveling the numerous lengths looped around and between my ankles.
  I was elated to have freed my ankles and decided against moving on to my knees
  since the rope would not completely hinder my ability to right myself and walk
  in a modified manner. I sat myself up and pushed my back against the dresser
  and slowly braced myself and began to push myself from the floor. Moments later
  I was on my feet. I was breathing in heavily through my nose and my forehead
  was glistening with sweat as a combination of my efforts and the nervousness
  I was feeling. I further surveyed the scene now, my eyes darting back and forth
  in an attempt to find something that might assist in releasing my wrist cuffs.
  At the same time I looked for an exit to the cellar knowing that I could probably
  attempt to navigate the home in my current half bound state. I spotted a stair
  case over at the far darkened end of the room and I hobbled over to it. Looking
  up it was narrow, wooden and about twenty steps up. I paused before considering
  whether or not to try to go up it. I looked to my side and suddenly my attention
  became extremely diverted. My eyes widened as something came in to focus. It
  appeared to be a bench of some kind. It was blue matted and almost resembled
  a sit up bench from a gym. What shocked me was what was built of to it. At
  one end, typically where you would steady your feet, there was a board nailed
  to it upright, atop which sat some kind of motor apparatus the end of which
  resembled a drill. On the drill like end someone had placed a rather large
  black rubber dildo. I couldn't believe my eyes. It looked like Tom and Janet
  had invented some sort of fucking machine. I could easily envision someone
  bent over the bench while the dildo would be aimed perfectly at their exposed
  anus. Whether this was something they used in their own play or if this was
  something that was intended for me, I had no desire to ever witness it in use
  and now became more determined than ever to escape my confines. I cautiously
  raised a foot and began my slow journey up the stairs. I would have to securely
  plant both feet upon a stair before the next could be negotiated as a result
  of my bound knees. I paused after every stair also to listen and try and determine
  if I could hear anything up stairs. Never hearing anything that gave me reason
  to change course I finally made it up to the door. Slowly pivoting myself around
  so my hands could work the knob I found myself very sweaty now and almost panting
  around my gag. My fingers found the knob and I closed my eyes saying a quick
  little prayer that it not be locked. Slowly turning the knob I found that it
  was unlocked. Incredibly thankful I paused to consider my situation. They had
  left me blindfolded and tied up on the floor in the basement probably never
  envisioning that I could find my way out. Given the degree of care the couple
  had taken up until now, I found this to be surprising that they hadn't planned
  for this possibility. Having slowly turned the knob all the way I very gently
  and at a snail's pace set to pushing the door open. It opened with a low creaking
  noise and gave me pause to panic, hoping that no one had heard that. After
  not hearing any responsive movement I pushed it further and then pivoted myself
  back around to face the final step. Natural light flooded the dark stairwall
  as I made my way out of my basement prison. 







I really had no plan or idea as to what I was going to do. Was I really going to attempt an escape? Given the liberties that had already been taken with me I knew very well that if I was discovered now I would more than likely be handled less than kindly. But I had reached a point of no return. What else could I do? I sure as hell couldn&#8217;t go back in to the basement and attempt to rebind my ankles. The leather cuffs on my wrist presented an enormous challenge and my best bet was to try and find something that could assist in working them off, like a knife in the kitchen. Looking around and trying to get my bearings I realized I was near the living room. I slowly hobbled through it figuring the kitchen would be around the corner. My eyes darted around to take in my environment and I paused momentarily at a small table by the couch. It was adorned with numerous photos. Many of them were of a woman, however it was not Janet. This woman was older with long blonde hair and a rather full figure. Her face was slightly wrinkled however it appeared that she may have been very attractive when she was younger. Many of the photos were of her and the two dogs that Tom and Janet had with them. I found this odd that there would be no photos of either of my captors, and who was this woman? I dismissed it as being a relative of some sort and set about towards the kitchen. With my knees still bound with chord this was becoming a difficult trek and the rope dug tightly in to my skin. Turning the corner I came face to face with a large mirror at the end of a small hall. My figure came in to full view and I appeared haggered and sweaty. I saw that my ball gag was green and it was very large, my cheeks were bulging out and drool was slowly pouring on to my chest. My eyes looked weary and my face was red and sweaty. Suddenly my eyes caught something I had not been privy to. A collar was buckled tightly around my neck. This in itself was not particularly alarming, however it was what was attached to the collar that made my heart skip a beat. There was a small little electronic device that had a glowing red light on it. It was no larger than a garage door opener. I stepped up to the mirror to try and make out exactly what it was. The letters appeared backwards in the mirror, but I was able to decipher the small white writing across the object. It was one word��Invisi-fence.� It took another moment but it soon dawned on me what that meant. This was probably one of those electronic invisible fence things that people use to train dogs. If the dog left a particular area, such as a yard, they would receive a pulsating shock from the device, and now this thing was attached to me! It appeared to be a part of the collar itself, which upon further review was actually padlocked around me. Even if I could free my hands there was a chance that this thing couldn&#8217;t come off! And how was it programmed. If I left the house, would I be shocked? I quickly determined that this would have to be addressed later as the first step would have to be working to free my wrists. I had no clue if Tom and Janet were still in the home and I wasn&#8217;t incredibly anxious to find out. I entered the kitchen and&nbsp; my eyes darted to a set of drawers near the sink. It was a pretty safe bet that one of them hosed the utensils�and in there would be the key to my freedom. If I could find a sharp enough knife, more than likely I would be able to cut through the leather. It would be an awkward scenario to negotiate with my wrists lashed behind me, but it was my only option. I hobbled forward towards the drawers and turned myself around to pull it open with my hands. The pain that shot through me that instant was blinding and one I would not be quick to experience again. My eyes winced shut as I felt a sharp, intense, jarring pinch to my neck. I dropped to my knees instantly, and in retrospect I was lucky to not have fallen completely over. I writhed in pain as I began to hear a slight buzzing noise. I realized that my collar was sending an electric shock to my neck. I rolled to my side and just like that it ceased. I was panting through my nose, struggling to breathe around my gag and my forehead was covered in sweat. As my eyes opened I realized I was at my captors feet. I gazed up in to the cross faces of Tom and Janet. Tom spoke first.
�Well, not bad�not bad at all, I thought it would take you a couple of hours to come to and figure your way out of the basement, but you made it in about 50 minutes.�
Janet interjected
�I didn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d even realize your shot at freedom, but then I guess that&#8217;s why Tom&#8217;s in charge of this operation.� She smirked and gave Tom a kiss on the cheek. Tom knelt down and I saw that he had a small device in his right hand. His eyes caught my gaze. �Ahh, this thing? It&#8217;s the remote control to that there shocking device on your collar. You can use it to set a perimeter or an invisible fence�.or you can just use it directly� And before he finished his sentence he had pressed a button and once again my neck was pinched sharply. 
�MMMMMMGGHG!!� I moaned loudly as I bucked on the ground. He let it continue for what felt like forever, but in retrospect was probably about ten seconds. It ceased once again and I squeezed my eyes shut as a result of the blinding headache I suddenly felt. 
�You see, that there was what we call a test, slave. We had to test how resourceful you are and try and gauge to what lengths you&#8217;d go to get away. We&#8217;ve been about ten steps behind you ever since you made it out of the basement, and before that we were in the next room waiting for that door to crack. What you need to learn quickly is that we&#8217;re not going to make mistakes, so you best bet is to not test us.� He said as he patted me on the cheek. Janet took a step toward me and raised one of her barefeet. She pressed the ball of my gag with her big toe as she spoke,
�You realize now you&#8217;re going to have to be punished for trying to escape� she cooed as she massaged the rubber ball that kept me silent with her toe. 
�And I think I&#8217;ve got just the thing� Tom smirked. �Little something I&#8217;ve been working on for a while, started as a toy for Janet and her friends, although I think it will work out nicely for you�once we get you all greased up.� His hand held me by the chin and I cringed at the sound of his words.

I was left on the floor as Janet and Tom tended to whatever devious idea they had in mind. I was in no position to put up any sort of resistance and my head still burned from the shock treatment. It was then that I started to get that sinking feeling in my stomach. There were about a hundred places I would rather be right now, yet this entire weekend was my own doing. This is how it had been talked out�I was to have no say in the matter. The only way I could&#8217;ve gotten out of this was to have never shown up at that parking lot, after that I lost all say, and now I was sincerely paying for it. It also bothered me to an extent that they were going to lengths that they were to keep me their prisoner. The shock collar was more than a little excessive to say the least. I had also been experiencing extreme stiffness in my joints from being continually bound and immobilized. Soon the two were upon me again and I was once more unceremoniously lifted from my resting spot on the floor and carried away. As soon as they led me towards the basement door I had a horrible feeling that I knew what was in store. They allowed me to look it over first, unaware that I hadn&#8217;t already made the dreadful discovery earlier.
�It&#8217;s a fucking machine� was all Tom said as he began greasing the flesh colored dildo with some type of lube. While he did this, Janet&#8217;s hands were at my anus. Her long nails slid up and down the crack of my ass as the cool lubricant began to coat my crevasses. I mumbled something in to my gag but it was ignored as the two tended to their business. Next I was bent over the device and my knees were unbound and my ankles were tied to some sort of a spreader bar at the base. I lay bent over on the mat as Tom began tying me to it with more rope while Janet playfully took a whip to my backside to �warm it up� as she so delicately put it. Lastly Tom knelt down near my face and produced a roll of gauze. He began wrapping it over my ball gagged mouth and under my chin and over my head. Moments later my world went black as he blindfolded me, completely mummifying and encasing my head with the cloth. Janet struck me extremely hard from behind with the whip and barely any noise could be hard out of me. Tom patted my cheek,
�Nice and quiet, which is good�because trust me, in a couple of minutes, you&#8217;d be making a whole lot of noise if you could.�
He had quite a way of making things sound incredibly unappealing like that. I grunted as I felt Janet guiding the dildo in to my exposed anus. It went in rather easily after my exploratory session from the following evening, but it was still amazingly uncomfortable. I tried to shift and to tense up in any way that might offer the slightest resistance, but I was to tightly bound and exposed. Next thing I know the thing roared to life with a load humming noise. The dildo began moving in and out of me and I began moaning as loud as I could (which was not loud at all). 
�The beauty of this puppy is that it&#8217;s got different speeds�we like to start it out slow and let it build to a climax�make no mistake, it can go about five times faster than this.� 
Terrific, I thought.
My punishment had begun and as the excruciating seconds turned to minutes and continued on I lost all sense of time and space. I felt incredibly warm all over as my insides were slowly and methodically torn apart by the rectal invasion. I was sweating profusely beneath the gauze and my entire body seemed to be developing a glistening sheet. As an involuntary response I moaned silently into my gag with every plunge. Occasionally as the dildo split into me the a whip would strike an ass cheek or dance against my back. It came from all angles and it&#8217;s deliverer did not hold back in the least. I had come to realize that Tom and Janet took had no reservation in unleashing upon me whatever cruel torture they deemed. After what seemed like an hour, but in actuality was probably less than 10 minutes, Janet&#8217;s voice broke the silence.
�Let&#8217;s see how the bitch handles 2nd speed.� I gasped in disbelief that the machine currently pummeling my rear end was only running at it&#8217;s first gear. 
�You think he&#8217;s been stretched enough?� Tom said, although his tone suggested that it was primarily a mock defense of his prisoner. 
�Baby, it&#8217;s not supposed to be comfortable for him. And remember, he tried to escape. He clearly didn&#8217;t appreciate how well we had been treating him and now we need to show him the error of his ways, otherwise he&#8217;ll never learn.� She said as if speaking about an animal. 
�MmmmMMmm� I offered as best I could while violently shaking my mummified head back and forth. I&#8217;d behave, I&#8217;d promise, I&#8217;d do anything just to avoid the fucking machine that I was currently lashed to. 
�Hmmm� began Tom, �He seems to think he doesn&#8217;t need to be taught a lesson. Which to me is clearly a sign that he doesn&#8217;t realize what a mistake he made.� He finished and I felt a weight on my back as he apparently raised a booted foot and brought it to rest on my back. 
�Now what would you have done if you had actually gotten out of the house. Where would you have gone all naked and tied up like that�you know we&#8217;re out in the woods, and you know we&#8217;d track you down before you ever got close to telling anyone how we kidnapped you. The lesson to be learned here is that we are and always will be in complete control of you. If you want to be treated better, then do not test us�.Baby, give it a pause, lube him up some more and then put it on level 3� he commanded. My head shut up in immediate fear and protest but a rough hand firmly grabbed me by the hair and forced my gauze covered face down in to the bench. The machine momentarily grinded to a halt and I immediately felt a cold sensation in my anus as Janet&#8217;s lubricated fingers began exploring me once again.
�You know, a time will come where we won&#8217;t even have to use lube, you&#8217;ll be so stretched an accustomed to being filled.� She mused as she dabbed the substance all around. Within minutes the machine roared back to life, but this time at what felt like almost ten times faster. It had been ratcheted forward a few inches so as to plug me deeper and also left more in me as it backed up. It moved very quickly and my body jerked forward with each propulsion. The whip found my body once again and the punishment continued on. 
I&#8217;m not sure if it was the whirring noise of the machine, or the gauze blocking out my entire world but I think I must have blacked out temporarily because I came to having no semblance of my surrounding what-so-ever. It started out rather quietly, but slowly a new sound began to build. I was puzzled by it at first, and incredibly distracted by the rhythmic ass pounding dildo, but finally I distinguished what was clearly the sound of a woman moaning softly. This was followed by the wet sound of flesh against flesh and it clicked with me that Tom and Janet were tending to each-other now as I was clearly preoccupied. Their moans became loader and I imagined the scene in the dimly lit basement. Me, bound and gagged, bent over the bench being rammed by the dildo machine. The two of them a couple feet of way, naked on the floor fucking, turned on by the site of their captive. Eventually their moaning climaxed, as apparently they did and I heard them slowly remove themselves from their positions on the floor and begin to move about the room. The machine too slowly grinded to a halt as someone apparently turned it on. They moved to my front and stood in front of me. A male hand again grabbed my hair and this time lifted my head up. I struggled to follow and comply while greatly arching my back. I kept still and silent as a sign of complete submission. A female finger traced a line over my gagged mouth and bandaged face and came to rest under my nose. 
�Smell� was the single command from Janet. I breathed in deeply through my nose, eager to show them I could behave and follow orders. A strong pungent scent filled my nostrils and I cringed at how dank it smelled. She stepped closer now and Tom prompted me to raise my head even further my yanking harder on my hair. My nose next connected with soft wet flesh as I recognized her vagina. Tom began moving my head up and done and my nose was dragged across the front of her sex. She pushed gently against my face and my nose would slip in and out of her pussy. It was incredibly moist and the scent was very strong. 
�Good boy, you like momma&#8217;s snatch� she chided as her fingers began exploring herself with my face still pressed firmly against it. Another sound directly to the left of my face indicated to me that Tom was also playing with himself as the sound of his masturbation greeted my ears. The two clearly had a rhythm and their collective timing was rather impressive. Janet became insanely wet and began gasping for air right about the same time I felt Tom&#8217;s spray shoot against the bandage that wrapped my face. I was actually quite thankful that it blocked his cum shot from actually touching my face. My head was released and my cramped neck lowered back to the mat. The two kissed eachother for a couple of minutes and I imagine their hands now were exploring eachother as they both moaned softly. I relaxed while I could, still strictly bound, but for the time being I was thankful to be receiving no attention what-so-ever.

Second Thoughts Part 4

By J Battier

&nbsp;

It ended the way most of our encounters to this point had.
My legs were unbound from the pad and I was brought to my feet. Tom escorted me
up the stairs with my wrists still bound behind me. He had unwrapped
the semen stained gauze but had left the ball gag in. He led me with a leash
that was attached to my shock collar and I was ordered to follow with my head
facing the ground. I did as I was told. Janet was apparently tending to the
clean up of items downstairs. I was led back upstairs and down the hall to
their bedroom. Tom removed my shock collar and put me in the shower. He turned
the cold water on and let it douse me, instructing me to do my best to clean
myself. From my bound position there was very little I could do. I allowed the
freezing water to rinse myself over, but other than that there was no way I
could soap or shampoo myself. I remained in the shower by myself, freezing, for
about 10 minutes. I didn�t dare step out for fear of being accused of trying to
escape again. At one point I did however venture to stick my head out and peer
around the corner. There was no sign of Tom or Janet. I stayed put anyways,
knowing that this could be a trick and also knowing the lengths they would go
to convey another lesson. After a fair amount of time had elapsed the my two naked captors returned. I was led out of bathroom
and stood dripping wet before them in their bedroom. Tom was upon me and
removed my ball gag. When I remained silent he gave me a pat on the cheek,

�You�re learning.� He commended. He reattached my collar and
then walked over to the dresser. He removed the black remote for the collar
from the top dresser. He walked back over to me and began punching in a code to
the small device. The collar around my neck beeped twice. He then turned me
around and a minute later my bondage belt, leather cuffs, and leather chastity
pouch all fell to the floor. 

He stepped back before speaking. 

�It�s important for you to know that I just set your collar
for a fenced in area of about 4 by 4 feet. If you move outside of that area on
your own right now, you�ll receive a pretty intense shock, and let�s just say
that you�ll be put out faster than chloform��

�And wake up with a much worse headache� Janet chimed in. 

�Now towel off� Tom ordered tossing me a towel.

I caught the towel that was tossed to me and began to dry
myself. After I finished I stood silently. I had not idea what to do next, and
so as a shot in the dark I lowered myself to my knees and kept my head bent
towards the floor.

�Very nice� Janet cooed��You may work out after all�

These words puzzled me slightly. I once again found myself
mentally revisiting the situation. How much longer would we play our little
charade? I wasn�t positive as to what time it was, but I knew the weekend was
coming to a close and I would soon need to be returned home. I was almost proud
of myself for following through and enduring what I had endured up until now.
The two of them approached where I knelt. 

�Face up� was all Tom muttered. I raised my head and my face
came in contact with a damp and pungent towel. Yet
again I breathed in the powerful aroma of chloroform, but for the first time
all weekend, I gave no struggle. My world turned black as I began to lose
balance and fell forward in to the arms of my captors. 

&nbsp;

While it appeared that I had grown accustomed to being put
out via the potent drug, it�s tough to say if you can ever get used to waking
up from it. It�s much akin to waking up after a long night of boozing. You
begin to come to, and you have lost all sense of time and space. Of course, for
me, it was impossible to know what type of situation I would awake to. As my
thoughts slowly became my own once again I tried to focus intensely and
determine what predicament I would now be faced with. The first feeling I felt
was an ache in the jaw. I tried to close my mouth expecting to find the
familiar taste of the rubber ball, but instead I tasted moist cloth. Something
was stuffed in my mouth, more than likely one of their undergarments. I did not
attempt to force the cloth out for I was certain something would prevent that.
I later discovered that duct tape had been wrapped over my mouth and around my
head several times. I imagined my wrists would have been pinned behind my back,
but as I began moving them I realized that they were pulled wide to either side
of me and lashed to something. I opened my eyes and slowly the room came into
vision. I was sitting upright in Tom and Jane�s bed with my hands bound to the
posts. My ankles were pulled spread eagle and the rope that circled each was
pulled down off the bed and tied somewhere underneath. I noticed also that I no
longer wore my chastity belt. I mumbled into my gag and looked around the room
for a clock to try and figure out what time it was. It slowly crept into my
mind that the weekend was probably almost over and it would ultimately be time
for them to let me go. I was slightly proud of myself for actually going
through with this, and that I had survived. Sure I had been used and violated
like never before, but I had proven that I could take it. I actually began to
become aroused at this and realized that I had not orgasmed since being jerked
off in the garage Friday evening. I wrestled with my bonds, praying for the
ability to free a hand to get at my now throbbing cock. However, my erection
and sex drive would quickly vanish as the door was pushed open and a person
walked in. 

I froze in my bound state as I looked at who stood before
me. It was a woman, but it was not Janet. She was tall and had long greyish
blond hair. She wore quite a bit of mascara and dark red lipstick adorned a
face whose rinkles betrayed her age. She had a curvy figure with some pudge but
it was clear that she was probably quite slender in her youth. Her outfit left
very little to the imagination. She wore a very tight one piece of black
neglige, like a teddy but much more form fitting. Black stockings where held up
by a garter belt and elbow length black gloves adorned her arms. Her hands
stood on her hips as she looked me over with a crooked smile on her lips.

�Well don�t you just look delicious� she purred, her voice
breaking the silence as she licked her lips. I still sat perfectly rigid.
Moments after her voice pierced the air, a voice that had a hint of a southern
twang, I suddenly realized where I knew her from. She was the woman from the
pictures downstairs, posing with Tom and Janet�s dogs. I was baffled as to what
she was doing here and I realized I was probably blushing as my face felt very
warm given my predicament. She walked slowly toward the bed and she seemed to
thrust her hips to the side as she approached. I tried to edge myself back from
her but my bonds held me tight. She noticed my struggles as she climbed onto
the bed.

�Oh don�t panic sugar, I won�t bite�well, maybe a little�
she said in a sultry tone. As she crawled towards me she went straight to my
right wrist and her gloved fingers began surveying my bonds. She tightened a
knot and then leaned over towards my other arm, her face coming with in inches
of mine and her ample cleavage pressing against my chest. I kept my gaze
fixated at the ceiling as shame washed over me. 

�Hmmm�clearly Tom�s work�he�s meticulous with his
knots�trust me, I�ve been trussed by him quite a bit� she murmured, almost half
to herself. Confident that I was adequately restrained she laid back resting on
an arm down by my midsection.

�Oh don�t be embarrassed, you can look at me� she said in a
coy manner. I lowered my eyes to her and recognized the deviant stare of hers
as very similar to the way Tom and Janet had looked at me all weekend.

�You�re probably wondering who I am and what I�m doing
here.� She said as she raised a nylon covered foot and pressed it to my chest.
She kept it there as she continued.

�Well, it�s quite simply really�this is my home.� Her words
hit me hard. What?! Her home?! Had I been moved?!
Where were Tom and Janet?! The questions flooded my head quickly. No, I
couldn�t have been moved, this was the same room that I had been in the times
before.

�You look puzzled baby�let me explain.� She began to rub her
foot up and down my chest. 

�You see, Tom and Janet are my friends�I met them online
just like they met you, although quite some time ago. For the longest time we
were just play partners, but we developed quite a good friendship and repoir
outside of the scene as well. They knew I had this house down here in the
woods, and they thought it�d be perfect for when they decided to make it
happen. Of course I had to have them watch my dogs for a bit while I was up
visiting friends in D.C. But I made them promise they�d let us meet once they
had set things in motion.�

Her tone was slightly cryptic and I got the feeling that she
was hinting at something I had not yet been made privy to. I mumbled into my
gag slightly and jerked my arms to indicate my frustration. She pushed her foot
hard to my chest pinning me against the headboard. Her other foot shot up to my
gagged mouth and she pressed her toes to the duct tape while making the
�shoosh� sign to her lips. I decided for the time being to comply. Confident
now that I would behave she continued.

�It was a complete favor from them however when they asked
me if I�d like to break the news to you.� Break what news I questioned to
myself, clearly worried about the direction this one way conversation was
headed. 

�They said they�d let me take you for a spin too, you know,
sort of one last fling before they make this thing real.� 

What was she talking about? 

�Although I imagine that they�ll let me see you again�but
believe me, next time we meet you�ll be in an entirely different state of mind.
They�ll have broken you by then.�

As much as her words puzzled me, I had a sickening feeling
in my stomach that I might no where she was going with this. 

�I�d tell you my name�but that is really of no consequence.
There�s no need for you to know, and of course there is an issue of legality�
she purred. Her gloved hands moved to my cock. With one hand she cupped my
balls and with the other she began very matter of factly stroking me. My dick
sprang to life having been given little release of late, but my mind stayed
sharp and focused on her words. 

�Although that really shouldn�t matter
either. They�ve worked this all out perfectly. Let me ask you pet, have
you for once taken stock of your situation?� Little did she know that when I
wasn�t being used and abused or made unconscious over the past 48 hours, my
mind did nothing but continually take stock. 

�You met two people at a truck stop, and were soon bound
gagged and blindfolded riding in their trunk to god knows where. For all you
know you aren�t even in the state anymore. And furthermore, who knows you�re
here besides the two of them, my dogs, and me.� She clearly had a point. None
of this was knew information to me, but to hear it spoken
out by another person caused it to take on a new degree of dire severity. I
tugged at my bonds slightly, not liking the direction
this was taken. I tried to pull my dick from her clutches, but she merely
readjusted herself closer to me. A sharp push of her stockinged foot to my neck
kept me still. 

�Tom and Janet have been planning this for quite sometime.
Sure there were other candidates�hell, there were even times it went so far as
getting to the rest stop before, but each time one side kept chickening out. By
the time you came across their radar, they were ready to go full steam
ahead�.You know, Tom shared with me your little attempt at trying to escape.
It�s very unfortunate that you did that. Of course they were testing you and
there was no way you�d have gotten anywhere�but what you actually did was give
away any chance you�d ever have for flight in the future.� The
future?! What did she mean, where was this going. 

�And that brings us to right now. As I said, part of the
agreement was that I would be the one to get to tell you. I just want to see
the look in your eyes. I want to remember it, I want to cherish it, and I want
to bring it back every time I feel like getting myself off.� She pulled hard on
my dick at that phrase. 

�Tom and Janet are doing this for real�you�re theirs now.
You�re going to be their slave for as long as they choose. Say goodbye to your
old world, because it�s gone forever.� To this day I can never recall precisely
what happened after that. So many things raced through my mind. Was she
serious? Of course she was. This was actually happening. How had I let it get
this far? Where were Tom and Janet. Part of me wanted
to lash out against my bonds, rip my arms out of their sockets if I had to. I
had to put up a fight, express my displeasure, show some sort of aggression.
Yet I�m convinced I did none of the above. The woman was quiet and I just hung
my head. I would not squeal or moan or thrust. I would not panic. I would just
sulk. I felt my face getting extremely red and I felt my stomach twist in
agony. These people were taking me, and there was nothing I could do about it.
My head snapped up and I came back to reality as I heard a strong humming
noise. My eyes settled on the source of the noise just as the vibrator touched
my shaft and balls.

�I knew that news would make you limp. That�s why I have
this. I�m not going to try and ride some limp dick� she hissed, and then
catching my glance she nodded��Oh that�s right baby, I�m going to rape you in a
minute, and I suggest you enjoy it because it�s probably the last time you�ll
have your dick in a pussy, and odds are it�s the last orgasm you�ll be having
for sometime.� My dick came to life once again at the combination of pulsating
vibration and stimulation provided by her hand, and within
seconds I was fully erect. I tried to pull away but I was stretched too
tightly. Minutes later the woman straddled me and pulling aside her
undergarment fabric from the crotch she sat her lips upon my throbbing member.
She was warm and incredibly moist, and a soft moan escaped her as she sat on
me. She began slowly rocking back and forth and as terrified as I was, I could
not calm down my erection. I turned my head to the side and starred off into
space as she slowly rode me, occasionally pulling herself almost off and then
forcefully coming back down. Within minutes we were both cumming. Me thrusting uncontrollably while being restrained and her throwing
her body against my chest and her nails digging fiercely into my skin.
Her sweaty, panting body collapsed against me and she pulled at my hair and
scratched my skin as she came to rest up against me. My mind raced as I began
to think immediately again with the proper head. I gave vain tugs against my
bonds just for the hell of it, knowing all too well there was no way out. I
felt a sickening feeling in my stomach that turned into a full blown gut shot
when the door opened and Tom and Janet entered. They were fully clothed and
wore ear to ear smiles at the site they came upon.

�Ahh it seems she�s had some fun with our pet� Tom began.

�And I take it she shared the good news with you?� Janet
said in a mocking tone. The woman sat upright and leaned against my shoulders.
She draped a stockinged leg over my spread eagled leg. 

�I certainly did�and thank you both kindly for allowing me
to take him for a test spin. Hopefully that�s not the last time we�ll get to do
this, if I can ever find the time to take a trip out your way.�

�You certainly do owe us a visit� Janet cooed, �And we�ll
have him good and broken in by the next time you see him.�

�You mean see �it�� Tom replied as the two of them came and
sat down on either side of the bed, Janet near the foot, Tom on my other side
by the mystery woman. Tom grabbed a fistful of my hair and pulled my face
towards him.

�That�s right, from now on you�re not a �he� or a �him�,
you�re strictly on �it�, and more specifically, you�re our �it.�� He hissed at
me. �You were stupid enough to get yourself into this situation and you�ve made
it incredibly easy for us to make you disappear without a trace. You�re coming
with us�and trust me, it�s a place pretty far from here, but you�ll never know
where. You�re our bitch gimp, so get used to your knew life.�

I shot forward and tried to jerk my head from his grasp. I
mewed as loud as I could into my gag and bucked against my bonds. Tom slammed
my head back against the bed headboard and the woman�s hand shot to my member
where she grabbed it forcefully and gave a firm squeeze. I felt like throwing
up the immediate pain caught me so off guard. No one said a word as I sat there
compliantly waiting for the situation to diffuse. And when Tom finally released
my head I let it fall to my chest in defeat.

&nbsp;

My �packaging� as I would call it began very routinely. The
three of them left me in the room for a bit, and when they returned, all three
came bearing different items that were then strewn out along the floor. The
woman had changed into jeans and a sweater and she went to work assisting Janet
as they opened a rather large duffle bag and began removing a multitude of
black items that appeared to be leather.

�You see� began Tom, �It was one thing to have you hogtied
in the back of the truck driving down here. Sure no one could see or hear you,
but if we had ever been pulled over and the flatbed checked, we could probably
explain our way out of it�and you too at the time would comply and explain that
we were all playing. But now that we�re doing this for real, we�ve got to do a
much better job of concealing you and shutting you up.� He smiled with a nod
towards the items over on the ground. 

�We�re going to strap you up good,
make sure you can�t make a peep, and then you�re going in that there duffle
bag.� He said pointing.

Janet cut it, �Just like luggage,� she offered, with a small
giggle to herself. 

�Yeah, just like luggage. In fact, you�ll be in the back
with all our other luggage from this trip, and no one
could ever tell the difference. No to mention we�ll probably put you out before
we start the trip and maybe chloroform you a few times on the way just so
you�re not fidgeting. Now, in terms of doing you up, you have the option�.we
can put you unconcious right now and do it, but that involves a lot of effort
on our part. Ideally, we�d hope that you wouldn�t mind being still while we
bind you. Keep in mind that Janet�s gonna be standing over there with that
remote to your shock collar and she won�t hesitate to shock the shit out of
you.� With that Janet rose and removed the remote from her pocket for show. She
walked over to a corner of the room and stood ready.

�Also, our friend here is going to take one extra precaution
that is slightly drastic, but that we feel is necessary.� He motioned towards
the woman who got up off her knees and leaving her current task walked over to
the closet. Opening it she lifted something in to her arms and then turned to
reveal a double barrel shotgun. My hear froze as I saw
that. My eyes shot to Tom who was nodding his head in a knowing fashion.

�I know, slightly excessive�but from our perspective we need
to be as careful as possible, so it�s a necessary evil. Now, are you going to
behave and let us do this or do I need to put that rag over your nose and wish
you sweet dreams?�

Wanting to avoid being chloroformed at all costs I nodded my
head slowly.

�Good.� Was all he said. 

Tom went to work untying me from the bed. My mind raced with
ideas as to how I could possibly orchestrate any kind of escape, but with the
shock collar locked around my neck, and the shotgun trained on me, I realized
that this was no game and that an escape attempt could prove deadly. Would they
really kill me? Probably not, they didn�t strike me as murderers, but then
again, they didn�t strike me as human slavers either. More than likely I would
get an intense shock if I tried anything. As Tom untied my arm bindings I
became completely free. He stepped back and ordered me to rise. I slowly lifted
myself off the bed. He had left me with the duct tape gag. My muscles ached
from a lack of use and as I rose I winced slightly in pain. Seconds later I
found myself collapsed to the floor writing in pain as a shock was sent to my
neck that reverberated through my skull. I struggled incredibly for air through
my nose as the shock ceased just as quickly as it came on. I looked up at Tom
as pain tears swelled in my eyes.

�That was to make sure you didn�t get any cute ideas,
because we know what you were thinking�now get up.� He said coldly.

I slowly pushed myself off the ground and stood at attention
with a lowered head. Tom began by taking my wrists behind me and cuffing them
with medal handcuffs. Next he forced my hands into two mittens that had no
fingers. They were strapped tight and fastened to each other by two mini hooks.
He then went to work on my ankles. My eyes went back and forth from Janet to the
other woman. Their cool gazes never left my form. Tom began lashing my legs
together with leather straps. He cinched one by my ankles, one just below the
knees, one above the knees and one at the thighs. He continued this up around
my torso and chest. Three of the successive bindings pinned my arms tight
behind me. Ordering me to the ground, I half knelt and half fell to the floor.
Taking another strap he put me into a very strict hogtie, my ankle bindings
pulled tight and connected to one of the straps that bound my upper chest. 

�Well ladies, you can certainly relax now that it�s nice and
secure.� And with that each of the women put down her respective tool of
enforcement. 

�Jan I�ll let you take care of it�s
gag, I�m gonna begin to round up our things.� Tom said as he rose and walked
from the room. Moments later Janet was upon me. She went right to work
unwinding the tape from around my mouth with little concern for the pain it put
me in. My face felt like it was stuck with a hundred pins as she tore the tape
loose. Shoving her fingers to my mouth she pulled free what had apparently been
a wad of her panties.

�Can you believe we fit three pairs in there?� she said to
her friend. �Tom thought he might choke in his sleep but we packed it pretty
well.�

I began to lick my lips and didn�t dare speak for fear of
what me be inflicted upon me. My mouth freedom was relatively short-lived.
Janet reached for an object that appeared to be a variety of straps. She placed
what looked like a small deflated balloon object into my mouth and commanded
that I bite down. I did as instructed and she pressed the rest of the gag, and
leather mouth covering against my face. She pulled it tight behind me and
proceeded to buckle a series of three straps. One set was pulled directly behind
me, another was pulled up over my nose and over my
head to connect in the back, and a third was buckled beneath my chin.

�Could you be a doll and hand me the pump?� she inquired of
her friend who handed her a singular tube with a ball shaped pump on the end.
She fit the tube into a connector piece on the front of the mouth strap.
Plugging it in she began to press the pump and I suddenly felt the balloon in
my mouth starting to get bigger. She squeezed the pump quite a bit and
gradually a large rubber ball was built up in my mouth. It filled my mouth
completely and as she continued to pump. With one hand still on the pump she
shot another hand to my groin and gripping my balls she gave a hard squeeze. I mmmphhed into the gag in pain. The noise produced prompted
three more squeezes of the pump. She then dug her nails in to my nipples and
gave a vicious pinch. Once again I mewed and once again she gave three more
pump squeezes. By now the pressure in my mouth was unbearable and it felt like
my jaw would burst from the size of the object. A quick jerk of my hair
prompted me to cry out yet again, however this time not a single audible murmur
was produced. I had efficiently been silenced and Janet acknowledged this by
detaching the pump. The other woman pulled forth a leather looking strap and I
instantly new what came next.

�Well now bitch, it�s lights out
time, next thing you see will be the surroundings of your new home.� Janet
cooed. If that was the next thing I would see, the last thing would be her
devilish smile as she pressed the leather blindfold to my eyes. It was actually
two leather patches connected by a strap that wrapped around my head and
buckled in the back. It was notched at least two sizes too tight and I knew
that within no time I would probably develop a miserable headache from the
pressure. Next I felt their fingers at my ears and the sounds of the room
disappeared quickly as they began pushing some sort of putty like substance in.
I had long since lost the ability to hear but still they continued to apply
more of this substance, forcing it and packing it in tightly until my entire
world was gone. My senses were more than just dulled,
they were slowly disappearing all together. The sound of my breathing through
my nostrils was deafeningly loud in my head. My sense of touch had not escaped
me and two hands raised my head and a sticky substance was pushed to the side
of my head. The tension of a wrap became apparent and I realized they were
wrapping tape around my head. They wrapped it around my ears and over my
blindfold, both ensuring that the goo in my ears would stay and adding an extra
lair of security to my blindfold. They let my head drop lifelessly to the
ground and I lay their completely motionless. I had no idea if they had gone,
but for the moment they were no longer tending to me. It was in these fleeting
moments that my thoughts once again drifted to what was actually happening. I
was being taken�stolen�a human being being stripped of his freedom. I had no
idea what my fate was to be. Would they kill me? Were they capable of killing
me? They had shown me the lengths of their sadism over the course of the
weekend�at least I thought they had�and seeing a shotgun in the hands of one of
my captors was absolutely petrifying. I had never seen a gun in person before,
and my first time was while I was being threatened with it. The time for
struggling had long since passed although I slowly rotated my wrists and
mittened hands, and of course it was no use. I wanted to scream out into the
darkness, but no sound could be heard. All I had was my thoughts, and they were
the loudest sound of all. 

&nbsp;

Hands! All over me, hands. Rolling me on to my stomach and
then back onto my other side, my hogtied body responded like a wooden rocking
horse. Two hands held me at my shoulders. Two others were at my feet, and two
others began mercilessly rubbing my genitals. The hands were gruff and probably
belonged to Tom. My balls were squeezed and my shaft repeatedly tugged and I
soon became aware of a smooth grease-like feel to his grip as they slid all
around, forcefully molesting me�and then just like that it ceased. I was rolled
back once again and this time instead of carpet I felt a cold substance beneath
me. My nose inhaled an even thicker leathery smell and as the hands began
positioning me in some desired fashion I felt the material being pulled up over
me. As my feet became enclosed I realized that I was being placed in a bag, a
leather sack of some sort. I panicked�my thoughts immediately came to
suffocation and thoughts of parental warnings never to put a bag over your head
as a child. As the zipper was pulled up my body was slowly disappearing. Just
as I felt it nearing my head and face my thoughts immediately became distracted
by an intense burn that shot out from my crotch. FUCK! I shouted in my head as
I realized Tom must have applied some sort of burning lotion or lubricant to my
dick. As useless as it was I screamed out into the enormous pump gag in my
mouth and suddenly the air around me became musty and dank and the feeling of
the bag against the top of my head let me know it had been closed. Hands! Lifting the bag, multiple hands, probably once again a group
effort. And just like that I felt myself being carried out of the room.
The path they took was all too familiar in my head. Blood rushed to my temples
as I was carried down the stairs with my front end leading the charge. There
was no way of telling where we were in the home since I could hear or see
nothing, but I was well aware of when I was being placed in the back of the
car. I also was quite aware of the feeling of other items being placed upon my
bagged form�probably more luggage to conceal their captive. As much as my brow
and body had began to heat up and glisten with sweat, my nose was aware of a
small cool path of air coming from somewhere. I relaxed only slightly to
discover that the bag had some type of oxygen hook up. The last noticeable
thing I would feel for the time being�aside from the never ceasing burning of
my genitals�would be the gentle rocking of the luggage on top of me as the
truck was set in motion, and my journey to complete and utter captivity began.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;













It was amazing to me how in just a short (but grueling) span of 48 hours I had become rather adept at dealing with extended periods of confinement and restraint. That being said, the position I found myself in for the car ride was the most stringent to date. Part of me found myself wishing that Tom had followed through on his threat of chloroforming me for compliance, but then again, there truly was no need. My captors had gone to great lengths to ensure that I was well put away and securely stashed for our trip�destination still unknown. I did not bother with futilely fighting my bonds as I had come to respect the lengths Tom and Janet went to when binding me. I had difficulty determining which pain to focus on at any given time as my whole body ached incredibly. My legs were lashed tightly with leather strips that began to cut the skin if I shifted weight. My wrist cuffs also bit the skin tightly and I questioned the need for such a small size when a looser pair would still have adequately restrained me. My hands themselves had began to perspire immensely inside the leather bondage mittens that prevented my fingers from meddling with any of my bonds. My lower back had started to feel a dull ache that was slowly building to a sharp pain as the merciless hogtie arched it uncomfortably. But perhaps the cruelest instrument of all was the muzzle-like pump gag that kept me silent. I was convinced Janet had given me permanent lock jaw as she continually pumped and tested it&#8217;s ability to prevent me from making noise during my �packaging.� Over the weekend they had gagged me in a variety of different ways and this was definetly my least favorite. The world within the leather sack would have been dark as night anyways, but the leather blindfold and tape wrapping pushed hard against my eyelids and added to the overall level of discomfort. I suppose the one saving grace was that the burning lotion Tom had applied to my genitals had begun to subside as we drove. This had reached a crescendo very early on in the trip and had led to me bucking wildly about in the sack and thrashing against my bondage. However, I&#8217;m positive that all of my efforts at movement probably resulted in little more than a faint movement of the luggage pile that surrounded me. 

I had deduced I was in the backseat of the Avalanche, as opposed to the concealed trunk cabin that I had ridden down in. I was buffered by the back seat and several other duffle bags that had been Tom and Janet&#8217;s weekend luggage. Some were obviously clothes, but I imagined others were the various toys and bindings that had been used on me over the weekend. 

I had little clue as to how long we were driving, or where we were headed. My mind struggled to grasp just how dire my situation was and what I had subjected myself to. Tom and Janet&#8217;s female friend had recapped it nicely when she marveled at how dumb I was to get myself into this. No one knew about my rendezvous with Tom and Janet at the rest stop Friday evening. That&#8217;s where my car still was at this very moment. It certainly wouldn&#8217;t stick out in a lot filled with transient vehicles coming and going around the clock. They had wisely tied me up and put me out of site for our trip down to �their� cabin and so I had no clue where exactly I had spent my weekend of sexual torture. The revelation that the home didn&#8217;t actually belong to them, but to their devious friend, represented the breaking of my spirit all together. It wasn&#8217;t that I had no will to fight against my slavery, it was just that I had been continually shown that Tom and Janet were one step ahead of me and that my resistance was only worsening my situation. I had truly resigned myself to the fact that this was going to have to be a &#8216;wait-and-see&#8217; scenario. I could do nothing in my present state, and as long as I was kept in the dark regarding my surroundings and what was in store for me,&nbsp; I was at the strategic disadvantage. 

I thought about Tom and Janet, sitting up front in the car, their dogs pacing about in my back seat prison (occasionally stepping over the bags and on me in the process). They must have felt a sense of accomplishment in their work. Had I even half an inkling that my weekend would have taken this dramatic turn, I would&#8217;ve turned and run in full sprint from their car in that parking lot, as opposed to willingly stepping in to that driver&#8217;s side seat. Their plan had worked out splendidly. They used me and degraded me all weekend into satisfying their sexual urges, and at every point they exerted and illustrated their dominance over me. Even my mini-escape attempt served only to highlight that they had thought this through all too well and that I was theirs to control. I hated myself for being where I was. I loathed the foolishness and naivety I displayed. And I was left to simply ponder the fate that lay ahead. 

The drive was taking quite some time and it began to unnerve me, the distance that we were travelling. Most of the time, I simply felt the steady vibration of the road beneath us, although the occasional pothole would cause a (muted) grunt. We made periodic stops and I would brace my weight against the other bags when the vehicle took to the curves of an exit ramp. The putty in my ears made it near impossible to deduce anything about where it might be that we were stopping, and I could make out the faintest sound of car doors slamming shot as they got out. Each time I heard this sound I braced myself for what I figured would be my inevitable carrying from the vehicle. However they must have just been simply food or rest stop breaks as minutes later the doors were re-opened and the engine roared to life. In these moments of waiting to see if we had reached our final destination, the dogs would take to barking and pacing about the backseat in an agitated manner. I figured that we were in a parking lot and the sight of other people caused them to cry out. I too wished that I could cry out. That I could somehow alert a passerby to my predicament. I wondered if either Tom or Janet remained in the car, or if they both got out. As secure as I was, would they actually both leave me unattended in a public place. I ultimately decided that one had surely remained in the front seat and decided against any attempts at making myself visible. 

This latest stopping point was easily the 3rd or the 4th on the journey. It had been many hours since we left and I figured that we could have easily traveled a couple hundred miles during this time. As I began to familiarize myself with these rest stop breaks, I began to hope that my captors might take the opportunity to address me in some fashion, or acknowledge my presence. It&#8217;s not that I was starved for attention, but rather I worried about my concealment within the leather sack. I had some air source supplying my nostrils with oxygen, but given my gag I could easily be in some danger of suffocating. This was obviously of no concern to them. I also longed for hydration, even the tiniest drop of water would suffice. My body glistened in sweat within the sack and had actually began to accumulate. A steady stream of drool had also long ago began to seep around the sides of my muzzle and collected at the base of my chin pressed firmly into the ground and leather lining of the bag. At this point I wished that they might just unzip me for a brief moment, just to feel a fresh burst of air introduced to the clammy, dank environment in which I now dwelled. It was difficult not to become overwhelmed with anxiety by a multitude of concerns. My physical pain was the largest present concern, but by letting my thoughts drift to other things, I was continually confronted with thoughts of my future.

 I was being kidnapped and taken as a slave. I could not come to terms with this. I pictured my face on a milk carton back home. I thought of how long it might take for anyone to realize I was missing. Obviously Monday morning would bring concerns at work, but would that quickly result in a missing persons report? Whenever someone did get around to reporting me as missing, where would the search begin. I hoped it would start with my personal computer. Despite no roommates or other users, I frequently wiped my internet history clean, so would they be able to come across the personal site where I first came in contact with Tom and Janet? Even then, I always deleted all my correspondence from that site as well. The more I thought about it, the more I realized there&#8217;d be very little chance of anyone being able to connect me to the pair, and I also doubted that they had kept their profiles on the site active�they were too thorough in their planning. It was no use in fretting about, I was a captive passenger and nothing else�a piece of luggage, hidden from the world and being transported to an unknown destination. I allowed my breathing to slow and I turned my head to the side. My cheek came to rest in my puddle of drool and perspiration. I inhaled slowly and deeply through my nose, allowing my chest to rise and fall gently. My heartbeat calmed as well and despite the aches, and the pain, and the worry, I found myself fading out of consciousness. It occurred to me that I had not slept for some time and my buddy was crying out for rest. I relaxed my muscles as best I could. I had been flexing my legs and arching my back in an effort to relieve tension from my wrists and ankles, but now I let go and allowed my bindings to pull taught as I went limp. The burn on my genitals had all but faded and the less I wiggled and stressed, the less I sweat. Somehow, some way, I was able to let the peace of sleep envelop me. 

My numerous interludes in and out of consciousness over the past weekend had consistently ended with me being rudely jolted back to reality. Therefore, I was actually kind of pleased to awake from my slumber and find my situation relatively unchanged. As frustrating (and still terrifying) as this was, I did have the luxury of being able to slowly shake off my grogginess and gradually regain my senses. A turn of the vehicle rolled me to my side and I released a muffled groan. This was followed by another turn, and soon another. I rolled to and fro within the bag, although I probably only moved a matter of centimeters in total. I wondered if this meant another rest stop. The whirr of the open road and highway had ceased and it was clear to me that we were off the main road. I held myself tense and strained to hear anything besides the beating of my heart. Whatever the substance that was stuffed into my ears, it had begun to slowly work its way out, probably as a result of my sweating and fidgeting.&nbsp; 

The car jerked to a halt and I found myself rolled to my side. I was able to make out the sound of what I believed to be the driver&#8217;s door opening and slamming shut. Then there was silence. For what seemed like an eternity there was nothing. All of a sudden another door opened and closed and my environment began to shift. The weight of the bags surrounding mine were pushed aside and I was no longer piled upon. I felt myself in my bag being dragged across the floor of the car and the tugging from all directions gave me the indication that I was being lifted from the vehicle. I tried to remain motionless in order to avoid an unceremonious dropping to the ground. The bag was lowered and I came to rest on a surface that did not appear to be steady. A slight shifting of my weight on to my stomach within the bag caused the surface to shake a bit. I felt an increased weight upon the unsteady ground and realized the other bags were being set next to me. I began to move forward and could make out the noise of what sounded like squeaky wheels against concrete. It dawned on me that I must be on some sort of a cart. We were building momentum and I braced myself within the bag with no idea where we were headed. The cart was abruptly jostled and met with resistance as it felt like we came upon a curb. With a little force being applied by whoever was pushing, cart continued forward unimpeded. We moved swiftly and I found my heartbeat steadily increasing at the thought that I might soon be granted a modicum of release. The cart came to a momentary pause, and then once again I perceived a change in surface as the squeaky wheels were no longer grinding against pavement. The soft, muffled, sound of us moving forward led me to believe we were inside, and the sudden slam of a door confirmed this suspicion. I was pushed from the cart and hit the floor with a thud. Instantly the bag was once again being dragged/slid across the floor. I heard another door open and I was pulled on to a more firm surface then the carpet I was just dragged across. There was the sound of a closing door and then silence. 

I lay completely still and waited. All of a sudden a burst of cool air blasted me in the face and I heard the zipper of the leather sack being pulled backward. My skin shuttered at the sudden change of temperature and my nostrils for the first time were filled with a scent other than the musky leather. I could hear muffled voices and I cringed when I finally felt a hand clasp the side of my face. Tom&#8217;s firm grip steadied me and I felt fingers prying at my ears and digging the putty like substance from it. It was the oddest sensation to slowly begin to fully hear out of it as the gunk was cast aside. The other ear had it&#8217;s sealant removed moments later and for the first time in a long time I could completely hear again. My senses were immediately re-heightened, and I perceived that both Tom and Janet were in the room as I heard their heavy breathing. 

�Well, well, well, you are one disgustingly slimy slave right about now. It sure must have been hot in there. We had the AC on high up in first class, but I guess it just didn&#8217;t reach you back their in coach� Tom laughed out loud. 

�We are impressed that you were able to stay so still and quiet for the whole ride, although I&#8217;m surprised you didn&#8217;t pipe up when we stopped for food.� Janet giggled as well. I had enjoyed my temporary reprieve from their sarcastic and tormenting comments. I felt a hand tap the front of my muzzle a few times and I tried to meww softly in protest. 

�I think this here pump gag took care of that nicely. That mouth was too full for any food. Although I&#8217;m sure it wouldn&#8217;t mind being replaced with some cock pretty soon. Lord knows I could use the release after all that time in the car. How bout you, slave? You hungry for your master&#8217;s cock� Tom chided as he patted the side of my face. I did my best to remain still and not elicit any taunting by protesting the thought. 

�Let&#8217;s go ahead and take that blindfold mess off�we don&#8217;t want him going blind on us. He&#8217;s got to see all the horrible things we&#8217;re going to do to him.� Janet suggested. Hands were soon back upon me and the tape that had been pushed up from my ears yet still concealed my leather blindfold was peeled away. As it came unwrapped I screamed in pain as it took some of my hair with it. 

�We&#8217;ll have to shave this head eventually, it will make your tapings much easier.� Tom mentioned as he clearly perceived the pain I was in. By all accounts I did the best I could to test the limits of my gag as the screams went largely muffled but were audible. Once the tape was removed, the leather strap blindfold was unbuckled. It was pulled away and a blinding light pulsated against my closed eyelids. I dared not open them immediately but waited for the glare to subside. I knew it would take me a minute or so to adjust. When I finally braved to open them, the world appeared hazy. Slowly things came in to focus and the first thing I saw as my vision restored were the faces of my captors gazing down at me. 

�Welcome back to the world of the living, slave.� Janet cooed. She stood over me and Tom remained knelt at my side. My eyes darted about what was a rather small, but well lit space. It occurred to me that we were in a bathroom. I was puzzled by the surroundings and arching my head back slightly I saw a porcelain white tub behind me. Reading my mind, Tom spoke. 

�Yep, that&#8217;s right, we&#8217;re in a bathroom. Don&#8217;t worry, this isn&#8217;t your new home. We&#8217;ve made a little stop for the night and this is our lodging.� 

�We thought about leaving you in the car with the other dogs for the night, but then we decided it just wouldn&#8217;t be smart to take any chances with someone seeing our new favorite pet.� Janet nudged my face with a bare foot as she said this. �So this will have to do for the evening.� 

�Not gonna let you in the bed though, we&#8217;ll string you up in hear for the night and then we&#8217;re back on the road first thing in the morning.� I turned my head away from both of them and found myself eye to eye with the base of the toilet. This certainly was a cramped space that the three of us found ourselves in. I kept my gaze off them and I felt myself turning red as they looked over my helpless form. I was hoping Tom would tend to a few of my other bindings as they cut particularly hard against my skin from the position I was laid in. 

�You can probably tell we&#8217;ve travelled a pretty good distance, and there&#8217;s a good deal left to go before you&#8217;re at your new home.� Tom began again. �See, we&#8217;re taking you nice and far from anywhere near where you used to live. Just all part of the lengths we&#8217;re going to in order to make certain you&#8217;re ours forever.� 

�Has that sunk in yet?� He queried. Grabbing my chin he jerked my face back to focus on him. He squeezed at my cheeks and pushed against the hard inflated ball that filled my mouth. �You know, the finality of all this? The fact that you&#8217;re gonna spend the rest of your life as our fuck-toy gimp?� If only he knew how much it had. I knew that in my present situation, there was no immediate escape. I was slightly intrigued by the fact that we were at some sort of lodging facility�be it a motel, or something of the kind. This meant that there were other people in the vicinity most likely, a far cry from the solitude of the cabin I was previously held at. Yet I was certain that there mission of transporting me to wherever �home� was would go off without a hitch. They were too meticulous in their planning, and I knew they would not present me with any opportunities for freedom. Still, I told myself to stay vigilant and to take any opportunity that I could to alert anyone possible that I was being held against my will. 

�Well Jan�why don&#8217;t you tend to the dogs and I&#8217;ll take care of this.� 

�You sure you don&#8217;t need my help getting him situated?� She asked. 

�Not when I&#8217;ve got this puppy� Tom reached into his pocket and pulled out the collar that I had previously been wearing. Attached to it was the electric fence device that had been used to subdue me. �He knows better than to act up when we&#8217;ve got this trained on him.� With his other hand Tom pulled out the remote control for the device. 

�Well then, I&#8217;ll go tend to the pups. I&#8217;ll also see about getting us some grub. The slave will need something too, I suppose.� 

�Of course Jan, we don&#8217;t need to starve the poor bastard�although he is much more compliant when he&#8217;s too weak to put up a fuss.� 

With that Janet walked out of the bathroom and closed the door, leaving me and Tom alone. He looked me over with a mischevious grin on his face.

�Listen here slave. Before I string you up for the night, you&#8217;re going to take care of your Master. Understand?� He muttered gruffly. 

I simply nodded my head, not entirely certain how he intended to use his bound prisoner. Tom set about tending to my bindings. He first let loose the hogtie and removed the leather strap binding my ankles to my cuffs. My legs stretched out and my knees cracked loudly as the tension was released. They were so stiff they could barely move. I lay motionless on my side. Next Tom removed a few of the straps binding my legs and the one&#8217;s pinning my arms . He left the strap securing my ankles together and my hands remained cuffed behind my back and imprisoned in the leather mittens. 

�Now let&#8217;s get you up.� He reached under my arms and dragged me forcefully from the sack. He got behind me, and stepping into the bathtub he pulled me backwards and propped me up against the side of the tub. Stepping over me and back out, he crouched at my side and began to affix the collar to my neck. He flipped a switch on the electric fence device and a small beeping noise indicated to me that it was activated. He smirked knowingly when he saw the look in the pleading look in my eyes. I did whatever I could to signal to him that I would be behaving. After such a strenuous trip, the last thing my body needed was the shock of current sent through my neck. I looked down at my naked body. There were numerous marks around my chest, stomach and legs from where the straps had held me tightly. 

Tom reached back and held his hand to the buckles that secured my gag. He looked me in the eye and said very matter of factly, �If a noise escapes your lips, it will be the biggest mistake you have EVER made in your young life.� I contemplated the statement and quickly realized I would do almost anything to have the pressure of the pump relieved. I nodded my head vigorously but Tom continued �Make no mistake, I�ll be able to shut you back up well before anyone hears a peep from you, and then I&#8217;ll spend the rest of the night making you regret that incredibly ignorant decision. So stay hushed.� And with that he fidgeted with the numerous buckles that harnessed the muzzle to my face. He produced the pump that Janet had used to inflate the balloon in my mouth and he connected it once again to the mouth strap. Releasing a valve I felt the balloon begin to deflate steadily. My jaw slowly relaxed but had a great deal of difficulty coming to a close as it had been locked open for such an extended period. A large amount of saliva spilled down to my chest as the deflated piece was pulled from my mouth and the whole harness was taken off my head. 

My head fell to my chest. Despite the bindings that remained I felt a great deal of release from the Christmas-present-like �boxing� that I had experienced prior. I also realized that I did have the opportunity to yell out. If we were in a motel, I doubted the walls could be very thick. Would I be able to get anyone&#8217;s attention before Tom was back upon me. In order to avoid the shock treatment, and what would certainly be a painful evening if I failed, I elected to stay silent. Tom set the harness gag on the toilet to his right and pulled over a shaving kit that had been resting on the small sink. When he reached in and pulled out the ring gag, I new exactly what was in store. Reluctantly I actually lowered my head and leaned forward in order to make it easier for him to put it on me. I felt that this act of submission might at least lead to him slightly lowering his guard. He too, seemed pleased by this move. 

�Good slave. You&#8217;re learning.� He forced the ring in to my mouth and back between my teeth. It was quite large and it pried my mouth right back open, however it was still less severe then the pump muzzle combo. He pulled the straps tightly behind my head and buckled it in place. He stood up and began to disrobe, kicking off his shoes and pulling off his socks. He pulled off his t shirt and but left his wife beater under shirt on. His jeans dropped to the floor and he I saw he wore only a jock strap. I glanced up at him. It once again crossed my mind what an odd pair he and Janet were. Neither very attractive, or with very good bodies, yet THESE were the two I had corresponded with and arranged my �fantasy� weekend with? The first of many wrong choices about this whole situation I suppose. Tom&#8217;s jock strap was tossed aside and his member dropped free. He moved over me and leaning forward he came to kneel one knee against the tub edge. The other leg propped him and he took his member in his hand and began stroking himself inches from my face. I closed my eyes and turned my head slightly to the side. 

�Look up at me slave� He ordered. I turned my head back and gazed up. Our eyes locked and he shot me a stern glare. He fast became hard and directed his penis to my gagged waiting mouth. I could do nothing as he penetrated the ring and filled my mouth. He let out a moan as he began to work himself back and forth, thrusting into my throat. I tugged ever so slightly against my cuffs and bound ankles clearly incapable of escape. I was incredibly uncomfortable, propped against the tub as I was. I was by no means a willing partner in this oral undertaking. This �limit� of mine had obviously been broken very early on over the past weekend, but I still could not get used to the sensation, or the idea that I was in the position that I was as a straight man. Then again, I realized I now existed in a world of absolutely no limits, as long as I remained under Tom and Janet&#8217;s control. 

Tom was taking his time. Once or twice he found himself getting close to finishing and he pulled himself away to prolong my use. Finally he took me firmly by the back of the head and continuously rammed himself into me, cumming forcefully and making me gag and cough uncontrollably. He kept himself in my mouth as he calmed down and finally slowly pulled my head away. He released his grip on my head and I let it roll to rest on my shoulder. I continued to cough and I felt completely red in the face from how helpless I was and at the mercy of my new self-proclaimed &#8216;master.&#8217; 

�So I guess that mean&#8217;s you&#8217;re not giving me any?� I heard Janet&#8217;s voice chime in as she had returned and was checking in. Tom still stood over me and was now wiping himself clean with several tissues. 

�Oh now, I don&#8217;t know about that. I just felt like our slave here needed a little refresher as to what we&#8217;ll be expecting every day for the rest of his life. You&#8217;re welcome to give him a go if you&#8217;re feeling frisky.� He offered. Janet came up behind Tom and kissed him on the neck. Reaching around she took hold of his member. He winced from the sensitivity but let her loving hand caress him. 

�We should probably get a little real food inside him before I serve him pussy�don&#8217;t you think?� She whispered in his ear. 

Tom looked down at me as I stared back up at them both. �Your Mistress seems to have your best interests in mind, thank her slave.� He ordered. 

�ahhhggmthhkkooooo� I forced over the ring gag.&nbsp; Janet gave me a wicked smile and then left the room. Tom finished cleaning himself and then looked at me as if something occurred to him. He took the wadded up tissues in his hand and pulled several other from the box on the sink. Coming over the me he knelt down and forced them back into my mouth through the ring. He stuffed them in there and they quickly filled up my mouth. He reached for one of this socks and tied it tightly over my mouth, knotting it behind my head. I would&#8217;ve had a great deal of difficulty forcing the wad out with the ring in place but now it was impossible. He was satisfied that this gag would be effective enough in the short term. He took my chin in his hand. 

�You&#8217;ll learn to love the tastes of your master and mistress, slave. And you&#8217;ll eventually learn to live only to please use. We have a tremendous amount of training ahead of us, so the sooner you accept your fate and improve your demeanor, the sooner we can begin. Make no mistake, we have all the time in the world to modify and mold you however we choose, but the amount of pain you feel will be a function of how quickly you learn.� He let the last statement hang in the air. I lowered my eyes and leaned my head forward in as much of an attempt at bowing as I could muster. He patted my head and seemed to appreciate this gesture as well. I could only hope that these little actions would be enough to bide me the wiggle room I needed to escape. 

Tom took something in his hand and before I could react he pushed it up to my face. I panicked, figuring I was about the be chloroformed again but&nbsp; instead I felt the damp and pungent material of his jock pressed to over my nose and gagged mouth. He pulled the strap over my head and let the elastic snap, securing it almost as a surgeon&#8217;s mask. I struggled not to wretch in his presence. He chuckled to himself. 

�I think I&#8217;ll tell Janet to hold off on your dinner for just a while. Now we&#8217;ll be right out here in the room, and even though we&#8217;ve still got you tied and quiet, don&#8217;t even think about struggling or moving about, because we&#8217;ll have this baby ready to go� He chided and tapped the remote control to the electric fence monitor against my forehead. He stood up and finally sauntered out of the bathroom, shutting the light and closing the door shut. I sat there, alone in the darkness once again. My breathing slowly relaxed as I was once again lucky to be alone and not in a state of use or abuse. My wrists now burned from the cuffs and my fingers had gone numb from lack of use inside the mittens. If I was not bleeding from the ankle strap yet, I imagined I would be shortly given how tightly it cut into my flesh. I tried not to focus on my makeshift gag and jock-strap face mask as the thought nauseated me. However, each time I breathed in through my nose I was forced to take in Tom&#8217;s scent. Janet had offered to feed me, but I&#8217;m sure Tom would convince her otherwise. I wasn&#8217;t particularly hungry &#8211; the terror of my ordeal had curtailed much of any appetite. I could hear their muffled voices in the room on the other side of the door. A flickering light from under the door crack and a whirring background noise indicated that the television was on. My initial thoughts were to test my boundaries and check for a method of escape. Given the past bondage treatments I&#8217;d been put through, this current level of restraint seemed relatively tame. I still wore the shock collar though, and that was their primary method of absolute control. I thought about testing my gag. I worked my jaw a bit in the hopes that I could first loosen the sock and then perhaps push the tissue wadding out through the ring. At a minimum I new that I would be able to mumble more than I could with the pump muzzle and that I could maybe make it loud enough that somebody next door could hear. 

But who knew if there even was anyone next door &#8211; or even a room next door for that matter. The risk was too great that Janet and Tom would hear and that I would be dealth with severely for my attempt. I resigned myself to waiting. I was no longer tired thanks to my nap in the car, although my neck and back ached from being propped up against the tub during the oral rape. I eased myself down to the cold tile, pushing aside the leather sack that had remained with my feet. I thought about the long and suffocating ride in the sack from earlier in the day. If this was only a resting point, then that surely was what lay ahead for me whenever we started the trip anew. I stretched my bound legs out further in order to take full advantage of the current range of motion I was permitted. As an afterthought I tried working the sock gag against the floor in an effort to remove it. I was not successful. Resigned to remaining as I was, I stared blankly in to the darkness and sighed deeply as I waited for the terrifying moment when the door would once again open. 











For a while I fixated on the light under the door. I could not actually see out from under it, but I could detect movement and different lights. The flickering of the television or Tom or Janet passing by the field of vision. They did not speak much in the other room�at least not much that I could hear. There were occasional murmurings and every now and again Tom would say something and Janet would giggle�and I would simply sigh to myself. I wondered what type of an establishment I was currently being held at. I pictured a rather bland motel. I imagine that I was brought in on a bag cart much like any guest might borrow to assist in moving in their luggage, and all the while nobody new there was a bound and gagged human being inside. And now, from where I lay in the bathroom, I was probably no more than 10 or 12 feet from the main door to the room, the sole divider between captivity and freedom. 

Well, not the sole divider. Tom and Janet obviously presented a unique and challenging barrier in and of themselves. And in my present state, there was no getting best either of my enslavers. I&#8217;d surmise that about an hour had passed before there was the sound of footsteps towards the door. It opened only a crack; light flooding a corner of the bathroom. From around the door peaked Janet&#8217;s brow. She watched me a moment, as if pretending she was out of site and sneakily observing her prisoner to see if I had made any attempts at alleviating my present situation. 

She spoke. �You&#8217;re right honey, he is becoming more docile. Breaking him might not be as tough as we thought.� And with that she flicked on the light switch and entered. My eyes struggled briefly to adjust to the light and I heard the door close. Looking upwards I saw it was just she and I in the tiny space. She wore black leggings that tightly hugged her pear shaped bottom and a loose t-shirt. In her hand was a can of something. She crouched down next to where I lay. 

�This might actually be easier for you if you just stay like this� She referenced me remaining laid out as opposed to sitting up. 

�Let&#8217;s go ahead and take this stuff off�but remember, nothing funny� She said showing me that she now possessed the remote to my shock collar. I shifted my bound form slightly closer to her at her beckoning and she set about removing my gag. First she pulled the jock strap from my face. My nose relished the fresh burst of air that I breathed in. Janet stretched it out in her hand for a moment, almost playing with it. 

�Tom says it&#8217;s important you come to enjoy our scents�says it will make you more eager to please your Master and Mistress. Maybe after we feed you I&#8217;ll let you tongue bathe my feet!� She said moving one of her feet over to my face. She playfully tapped her toes against my sock gag. Just as I had done with Tom, I feigned deference to her and actually lifted my face fully to her foot, pressing my nose to her toes in a sign of submission. She cooed in delight. 

�That&#8217;s a good slave�but there will be plenty of time for that later� She untied the sock from over my mouth and cast it aside with Tom&#8217;s jock. Next she unbuckled the ring gag and unlodged it from the back of my teeth. With her help I pushed the cum-soaked wadding of tissues out from my stuffed mouth. My mouth was parched and my lips felt dry and cracked. I didn&#8217;t dare speak but I began smacking my lips in the hopes of conveying my extreme thirst. 

�Oh, you must be thirsty. Well I can get you some water, but first let&#8217;s get your feeding over with� Janet brought over the small can that she had come in with. Peeling back an aluminum lid she set it down before me. 

�Can peaches seemed like the healthiest thing in the vending machine, so that&#8217;s what you get.� She pushed it over to the front of my face and I realized that I was meant to eat from it like a dish. Good thing I had had practice at this during our weekend at the cabin. I lowered my face to the dish and plunged my mouth in to the small can, sucking and slurping up as much as I could. The peaches were sweet and the contents of the can were unfortunately rather soupy. Within minutes I had all but licked the can clean, and I was certain my face bore the remnants of my meager meal, as did part of the floor around me. Janet pulled the can away and moved to the sink. She filled the empty can with water and then set it back down before me. 

�Drink up� were her only instructions. I set to and lapped the water with my tongue. It was lukewarm, but I was in no position to protest. I had no idea how dehydrated I actually was as I could feel each sip trickle down my dry throat. I continued to lap hastily but seconds later Janet pushed the tin aside with her foot. Her bare foot now before me she reached over and grabbed a fistful of my hair. Yanking it backward my head cocked back and I let out a tiny yelp but was quick to silence myself, lest I be re-gagged in some horrible fashion. 

�Now bitch, you&#8217;re going to lick my feet clean with your tongue, understood?� 

Fearful of speaking out I offered barely a whispered response of �Y-y-es Mistress.� 

Janet released my hair from her grasp and I lowered my head slowly to her waiting foot. I bowed my head slowly and kissed her big toe softly. I moved down the line and offered soft kisses at each toe and ..CRACK! 
I felt the palm of Janet&#8217;s hand to the side of my face and recoiled quickly. I looked up at her fearfully. 

�I told you to lick, slave. No one said kiss� she taunted. 

Still smarting from the sting of her smack I quickly complied and extended my tongue to her toes. I rubbed my tongue back and forth over the bottom of her toes and the sole of her extended foot. I vigorously bobbed my head up and down taking each toe fully in my mouth and sucking diligently. I did not divert my attention from the task at hand and I was sure to keep my focus on cleaning adequately. I was disgusted by my actions, but I was not willing to incur any further discipline at her hand. When she was satisfied that I had addressed her one foot well enough she offered the other and I quickly set to work in a similar fashion. She began to force more of her foot in to my mouth as I sucked and licked, at one point forcing all five toes in. She seemed especially pleased as I choked back and endeavored to apply my tongue to the mouthful. 

�Look at you slave, you suck my foot like Tom&#8217;s cock. Enjoy the taste because you&#8217;ll be tongue bathing every inch of your Master and Mistress once we&#8217;ve got you home. My feet will probably become the one thing you actually look forward to every day� 

I had to give it to Janet. As sadistically cruel as Tom was, Janet always had a way of instilling an even greater sense of dread about what lay ahead. At first I had seen her as a clear second fiddle in what appeared to be Tom&#8217;s fantasy weekend. But that was before the true nature of my enslavement dawned on me and I saw what an equal role they both played in snatching me from society and taking me as their prisoner. I failed to give any response to the tort but rather continued to work her foot over with my mouth as if it was my last meal. I figured the more vigorous I worked, the more at ease she&#8217;d be and the less inclined she would be to inflict pain. 

From the corner of my eye I noticed the push open a little more and Tom leaned up against the side of the wall to casually observe. 

�Our slave is sure learning what that mouth of his is for. Why don&#8217;t you give him a real treat and sit that beautiful pussy of yours on his face.� He suggested. 

Janet pulled her feet from me. �Funny you should mention, I was just thinking I&#8217;d like to sit on that mouth, but I was thinking maybe she clean out my asshole first � She giggled. 

Tom nodded is head in agreement. �That&#8217;s a good idea sweetheart, go on a roll over slave, she&#8217;s going to really put you to work now.� He addressed me. 

My heart fell to my stomach (as best it could from laying on my belly on a bathroom floor) and I wretched at the thought. In an extremely reluctant and slow fashion I began rotating over to my back. I kicked my knees up and my arms came to be pinned under me, the leather bondage mittens holding me up ever so slightly. Janet for her part began to pull down her leggings. 

As she was pulling her leg out there came a loud knock at the door out of the room! It came so quickly and out of nowhere that all three of us seemed to jump a little. Tom&#8217;s eyes immediately shot to Janet and I saw a look of sheer panic in his eyes. 

�Get him� was all he had time to say before quickly shutting the bathroom door and disappearing into the room. 

Janet, for her part, all but fell on top of me as she lurched to the ground. Before it even dawned on me to cry out she cupped a hand forcefully over my mouth and grabbed me from behind, pushing my head further in to her smothering hand. She did not speak, she only stared at me with an intense scowl on her face. She was laying on top of me and her legs had wrapped around my bound one&#8217;s further keeping me still. I realized as I breathed deeply from my nose to avoid suffocating that I had possibly just missed the one opportunity I had to scream out to others for help and be heard. 

The bathroom was silent except for my breathing. In the other room Tom seemed to be rummaging through luggage or something but he had yet to address the person at the door. I heard another knock come loudly. In response Janet pressed harder covering my mouth. I heard the click of the front door of the room open and then there were voices. One was clearly Tom&#8217;s. The other I could not make out. There was an exchange of dialogue that went back and forth. What were they discussing? Had their been a complaint? Could anyone have possibly seen me, or gotten wind of what may be going on this room. My hope turned suddenly to the fact that with the door slightly open to the bathroom and Tom leaning in, maybe someone could&#8217;ve seen in from the window (presuming of course there was a window�I had still never seen outside the bathroom). As the talking continued Janet removed the hand from behind my head. I hit the floor with the back of my skull producing a dull thud noise. Her hand remained over my mouth and she was squeezing very hard to prevent any utterances, not that I had tried.

 She seemed to be reaching for something on the floor with her free hand and I wondered if this was my chance. From my position on my back I may be able to buck upward and knock Janet off balance and off of me. If her hand came free from my mouth I could quickly scream and alert whoever was at the door. I steadied myself and committed to this course of action. Convincing myself it was the only way out I tightened my leg muscles in anticipation of kicking upward. I flexed and was about to spring up when Janet quickly found what she was searching for and moved an object quickly to my face. 

The blinking red light on the remote in her hand told me everything she was thinking. She mouthed the words silently &#8216;Don&#8217;t think even think about it&#8217; softly. With her thumb I saw her rotating a dial on the remote and I concluded she was adjusting the frequency to a very severe shock level. I tried to nod my head as best I could in order to tell her I understood and would be quiet, but it was quite well pinned against the ground. The voices in the room abruptly ceased and I heard the sound of the door closing shut. Foot steps fast approached the bathroom door and it was pulled open a crack. 

Tom basically slid in through the ajar door and shut it quickly behind him. For a moment, all three of us were silent in the dark. He eventually moved his hand up to the light switch and illuminated the tiny room. There was sweat on his brow and he was breathing heavily. 

Janet looked up at him almost pleadingly, but he simply shook his head &#8216;no.&#8217; 

�It&#8217;s alright baby, everything&#8217;s alright�� he got out between deep breaths as he tried to calm his nerves. 

Alright?! Everything is alright?! From who&#8217;s perspective?! I fumed silently to myself. 

�Just the front desk clerk. He was asking if we would need to baggage cart again in the morning, so he could set it aside for us.� 

�Is he gone?� Janet queried. 

�I told him we&#8217;d need it bright and early and then sent him on his way.� 

�Did he�Do you think he�� she trailed off

�Definetly not. The door to here was closed before I answered, and you know there&#8217;s no looking in through those drawn curtains. He didn&#8217;t see anything.� 

The two of them smiled at eachother and then shared a bit of a laugh. Janet turned her attention towards me, where she still held a firmly cupped hand to my mouth. �That was a little too close, now wasn&#8217;t it slave?� She taunted. 

Tom took over, �I think play times over. It&#8217;s time to bundle him up for the night and then we&#8217;ll get out of Dodge first thing in the morning. Let&#8217;s get him up.� 

He came over to where I lay. Janet removed her hand and they both paused, looking at me. I knew they were waiting for my reaction, would I speak, yell, scream or simply stay silent. Since they were on top of me as is I elected the latter and simply looked away. I failed to see if this pleased them in any way as the next thing I knew they were raising me by my arms. They sat me down on the toilet seat. 

�I&#8217;ll get the bag� said Tom turning and leaving the room. Janet turned to me and held a finger to my lips.

�Good slave� she said in a shooshing manner. She let her finger pick up at my closed lips. Prying them apart she moved it in to my mouth slowly. Instinctively I sucked it gently. A smile crossed her lips and she began sliding it in and out. I obliged her little game in my continued effort to garner their favor for my benefit. 

�Now I see why Tom is so fond of this mouth.� She teased. Moments later Tom re-entered and she pulled her finger from my mouth. I stayed silent. 

He laid a gym bag on the floor and unzipped it. 

�We&#8217;ll prop him up in the shower.�&nbsp; He said to Janet. And then turning to me, �We&#8217;re going to undue your ankle strap, I don&#8217;t need to tell you how to act.� He then set to unbinding my ankle. I almost could not believe it. Only a few hours ago I was packed away inside a leather sack, buried under luggage and tied tighter than I ever imagined a person could sustain. Now I sat between my captors with only a pair of handcuffs and leather mittens preventing me from lashing back out and initiating an escape. Of course the collar around my neck still posed a problem. A quick dart of my eyes observed that Janet had it in the palm of her hand. A feeling of defeat swept back over me. I watched her closely out of the corner of my eye. If she were to set it down, that would be my chance. 

�On your feet.� Tom barked. I rose and stood between them. �Now get into the shower.� He placed two hands on my shoulders as I turned and, one foot at a time, stepped into the tub and shower. Tom reached into the bag and pulled out a roll of duct tape. He climbed into the small tub where I stood naked and cuffed. Kneeling next to me he ordered my ankles together and then proceeded to wrap tape around them. After five or six times around he cut the tape and smoothed it off. He did the same with my legs directly above the knees. Then, standing, he wrapped the duct tape around my chest several times, pinning my arms to my body as they remained cuffed behind me. And just like that I was once again immobilized�.upright�but incapable of movement. Just for kickers, Janet chose this time to go and set the remote to my collar down on the bathroom sink. 

�Gag please, doll.� Tom asked of his wife. Janet reached down into the bag and produced the all too familiar green foam ball-gag that they used on me for a good deal of the past weekend. Tom took it from here and raising it to my mouth commanded me to open. I did as instructed and once again the large foam ball was pushed in and forced my jaw open wide. He buckled it behind my head quite tightly. Not quite satisfied, he picked up the roll of duct tape and went to work wrapping it around my head and over the ball gag, muffling any sounds I could possibly hope to make. My eyes watered slightly due to the bulging ball in my mouth and the extremely tight wrapping that encased my mouth. 

�You&#8217;ve probably had these on long enough� Tom said as he reached behind me and began to unstring the leather mittens. They had been on for my entire trip from the cabin and I wiggled my fingers as soon as they were free, restoring blood to them and shaking off the sweat that had accumulated within them.

�Now put your palms flat together, that freedom is going to be shortlived.� As I placed my hands flat together, Tom took the duct tape roll and wrapped the metallic colored binding around them, effectively neutralizing my fingers ability to meddle yet again. 

Tom went back to the bag and set the tape aside. Thankfully. However, next he pulled out a roll of saran wrap which completely puzzled me at first. Janet, sensing the question in my head decided to fill me in on the details. 

�We&#8217;re going to mummify you, slave. Can&#8217;t have you wiggling and struggling all night while we&#8217;re trying to get our beauty rest.� 

Tom was back in the tub immediately, and beginning at my feet he wrapped the clingy, clear material around my ankles, up my shins, around my thighs and so forth. He continued all the way up my body, slowly and deliberately, pulling the unyielding plastic wrap tight with every rotation. I stood there completely dejected. In a matter of moments they had once again made me completely helpless and with little hope of escape. Tom finished off the roll after numerous times around my chest. He smiled at me and began to rub his hands over my mummified form. 

�Nice and smooth, slave.� He said as he pulled my form close to him. One arm he put over my shoulder. He grabbed my chin with the other and turned my face towards his. 

�You feel how helpless you are right now? Don&#8217;t you?!� he hissed. 

His hand helped to force my chin to nod. 

�Good, this is one of the hundreds of ways that we&#8217;ll be putting you away for the night from now on. Janet and I think it&#8217;s important that you are always left in incredibly tight bondage. Where we&#8217;ll be keeping you at home, no one will ever find you and you can scream to your hearts content, but they won&#8217;t hear you. But we&#8217;re still gonna gag your bitch ass, just so you know that we are in complete control of when you speak. We&#8217;re in control of every part of your life, and don&#8217;t you ever forget it.� He patted my cheak. 

Janet walked over and helped herself into the tub where we all stood. She too ran her hands up and down my encased form. 

�Honey, hearing you talk that way has got me all sorts of hot and bothered. And since I didn&#8217;t get to sit on our slave&#8217;s face, I&#8217;m gonna need you to give me some lovin. Let&#8217;s leash him and be done with it already� She pleaded. Tom was clearly keen to this suggestion. He went back to the bag and pulled out another long leather strap. Coming back he took it and knotted one end around my collar. Taking the other end he looped it over the shower rod and pulled it tight. 

I choked upward as my collar yanked my neck and it dragged up towards my chin. Tom continued to test the slack by pulling hard on the rod. Satisfied that it would hold, he stood up on the side of the tub and knotted the strap off along the rod. I was forced slightly up on the balls of my feet. Janet observed this closely. 

�Looks like he can stand alright, shouldn&#8217;t be in too much danger of choking, provided he stays nice and still.� She patted my butt a few times. I grunted into my gag as this caused me to sway slightly. I shifted the weight on my feet quickly and was able to keep myself from choking further. 

�One last finishing touch� Tom said heading back towards his &#8216;goody&#8217; bag yet again. He pulled out a small metal bell. Jingling it a few times in his hand he bobbed his head to the ringing noise it made. He approached me and taking a small piece of twine he attached to the bell to my collar, tying it off so that it hung slightly further down my neck. He batted it back and forth a few times and it continued to ring uncontrollably. Grabbing it, he halted the sounds. 

�This is so that we know when you&#8217;re fussing in here. If you start testing boundaries or trying to work on freeing yourself, this little puppy here will be enough to wake us. We recommend you just stand still and focus on keeping that pressure off your throat, because if we have to get up to ring this bell, it&#8217;s not going to be pleasant for you.� 

�Although we&#8217;ll probably enjoy it immensely� Janet joked. They stepped away from me and out of the tub. For the first time I noticed I could see my bound figure in the bathroom sink. I looked absurdly bizarre, wrapped up the way I was, tape completely covering the lower half of my face, straining forward to keep tension in the leash. The bell around the collar made me look like some perverse Christmas present of sorts. They 

Janet spoke. �We&#8217;ll be shutting this light off, but no need to blindfold you just yet. We don&#8217;t want to ruin those pretty eyes of yours, and you know we&#8217;ll be sure to blindfold you nice and tightly when we pack you up in the morning. But for now�enjoy. Toodles!� She blew me a kiss. 

�Goodnight slave� was all Tom said as he shut off the light. They both turned and walked out the door. Closing it I was once again cast into darkness. 

Janet was not lying. Within minutes of the door being closed and me being �put away� for the evening, the sounds of their sex began to leak in. I considered their perspective for a moment. How this must all just be one incredible turn-on for them. They were successfully turning their darkest and most perverted fantasy into a reality and I was the victim. Snatched from my normal vanilla life and reduced to an immobilized sex toy. I was sure that it was now Monday evening, that much of the outside world was still apparent to me. That meant that I had missed work today without explanation. I hoped that this would be the catalyst for triggering the series of events that would ultimately lead to a police report being filed. Of course I had no idea where in the country we currently were. The drive to the cabin had been a minimum of a few hours, and then a full days travel in any number of directions meant that it was impossible to conclude where we currently were. 

I swayed silently in the dark, periodically shifting my weight from the balls of my feet to the heels. There was a consistent tug at my neck collar given how taught Tom had leashed me to the shower rod. I experimented briefly with seeing if the pole could be broken. If I completely through my weight into it, was there a chance that it would snap under my weight before it had the chance to choke off my air completely. The noise from the break might alone be enough to rouse suspicion from somebody on the premises. 

The bell around my neck gave a ring as I stretched the leash. I froze. Thankfully there was no interruption to Tom and Janet&#8217;s sex in the adjacent room. They either had not heard the ring, or had chosen to ignore it since it did not indicate a significant amount of moving or struggling on my part. Still, this gave me warning that if I pursued the plan to break the shower rod, there would be a very finite window of time before they would be back upon me. The thing I struggled with (besides the obvious restraints) was that come morning we would once again be on the road; I would not doubt be packaged in a similar fashion as before. This could very well be the last time I was in a public setting�as private as they had made it. If they got me to their home, I was sure I would have little to no hope of escape. My mind was made up. I would bide time and endeavor to crush the bar in the middle of the night. At a minimum, if they were asleep I would have just a little bit more time before they would be able to respond. I steadied myself where I stood and listened quietly. 

Only a few minutes had passed when the door was opened and light once again flooded the room. I winced at the brightness. A naked Tom came sauntering in, his body glistened with sweat. As he closed the door behind him, I caught a glimpse of Janet lying naked over on the bed, clearly exhausted from this recent romp. Tom ignored me as he tended to relieving himself in the toilet. I looked away and tried to do nothing that would draw attention to me. Finishing he turned to me. 

�Once we get you to your new home, it&#8217;ll be your job to lick us both clean after sex. Tonight your off the hook since we need your mouth to stay shut for the time being.� He patted my duct taped cheek. 

�It&#8217;s too bad your gagged though, cause we saved you some desert.� Tom giggled as he showed me used condom that he held by the top in his left hand. I grimaced to myself but tried not to betray my disgust with my gaze. 

�I suppose we could save it for you for breakfast.� He mused. Thankfully, he reconsidered this idea and he tossed it aside in to the toilet. A quick flush assured me that it would not be an option for later. 

Tom looked me up and down for a moment and then appeared to have a realization. 

�You know�I&#8217;m just not certain this shower rod is a good idea. I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re dumb enough to try, but I could see your weight maybe pulling this down thinking you&#8217;d be able to get someone to come check on things.� He gave me a quizzical look as if he was trying to gauge whether this idea had crossed my mind. 

I averted my eyes to the floor but this did not prevent him from pressing the issue as I hoped. 

�Come to think of it, let&#8217;s re-work this just a bit.� 

Tom stepped into my shower prison. His body pressed up against my bound and cocooned form as he tugged at the knotted leash on the pole. It came undone moments later. Holding the leash in one hand and steadying me with his other he instructed me to lay down. 

I had no choice but to comply. He held me as I awkwardly bent my bound legs and I more or less fell backward into his arms. He lowered me steadily to the floor of the tub. I was put on my stomach. Taking the leash he tugged it and pulled the other end tight around the faucet that jutted outward about a foot or so above my head. He wrapped it numerous times to remove much slack and he tied it off just as my head was slightly raised by the pull of my collar.&nbsp; I could rest my chin of the floor of the tub, but did not have much room to move it to either side or to rest a check on the ground. Tom seemed pleased with the adjustment. 

�Much better. I prefer you on the ground like this. Less room for you too.� I stayed still as he got out of the tub and exited the bathroom. 

Once again I was cast into darkness. I surveyed the situation quickly and realized that there was absolutely no options left available to me. Bound as I was and leashed to the faucet I could never make it to my feet without strangling myself. I moaned into my gag in displeasure. I barely made a sound. I contemplated thrashing about, doing anything I could to pry something loose, but I knew this would be effort would be fruitless. I sobbed softly and felt my eyes begin to swell. There was nothing I could do now except wait patiently for the morning when we would once again set forth on the road and I would be that much closer to disappearing forever as their slave.&nbsp; 










For a while I fixated on the light under the door. I could not actually see out from under it, but I could detect movement and different lights. The flickering of the television or Tom or Janet passing by the field of vision. They did not speak much in the other room�at least not much that I could hear. There were occasional murmurings and every now and again Tom would say something and Janet would giggle�and I would simply sigh to myself. I wondered what type of an establishment I was currently being held at. I pictured a rather bland motel. I imagine that I was brought in on a bag cart much like any guest might borrow to assist in moving in their luggage, and all the while nobody new there was a bound and gagged human being inside. And now, from where I lay in the bathroom, I was probably no more than 10 or 12 feet from the main door to the room, the sole divider between captivity and freedom. 

Well, not the sole divider. Tom and Janet obviously presented a unique and challenging barrier in and of themselves. And in my present state, there was no getting best either of my enslavers. I&#8217;d surmise that about an hour had passed before there was the sound of footsteps towards the door. It opened only a crack; light flooding a corner of the bathroom. From around the door peaked Janet&#8217;s brow. She watched me a moment, as if pretending she was out of site and sneakily observing her prisoner to see if I had made any attempts at alleviating my present situation. 

She spoke. �You&#8217;re right honey, he is becoming more docile. Breaking him might not be as tough as we thought.� And with that she flicked on the light switch and entered. My eyes struggled briefly to adjust to the light and I heard the door close. Looking upwards I saw it was just she and I in the tiny space. She wore black leggings that tightly hugged her pear shaped bottom and a loose t-shirt. In her hand was a can of something. She crouched down next to where I lay. 

�This might actually be easier for you if you just stay like this� She referenced me remaining laid out as opposed to sitting up. 

�Let&#8217;s go ahead and take this stuff off�but remember, nothing funny� She said showing me that she now possessed the remote to my shock collar. I shifted my bound form slightly closer to her at her beckoning and she set about removing my gag. First she pulled the jock strap from my face. My nose relished the fresh burst of air that I breathed in. Janet stretched it out in her hand for a moment, almost playing with it. 

�Tom says it&#8217;s important you come to enjoy our scents�says it will make you more eager to please your Master and Mistress. Maybe after we feed you I&#8217;ll let you tongue bathe my feet!� She said moving one of her feet over to my face. She playfully tapped her toes against my sock gag. Just as I had done with Tom, I feigned deference to her and actually lifted my face fully to her foot, pressing my nose to her toes in a sign of submission. She cooed in delight. 

�That&#8217;s a good slave�but there will be plenty of time for that later� She untied the sock from over my mouth and cast it aside with Tom&#8217;s jock. Next she unbuckled the ring gag and unlodged it from the back of my teeth. With her help I pushed the cum-soaked wadding of tissues out from my stuffed mouth. My mouth was parched and my lips felt dry and cracked. I didn&#8217;t dare speak but I began smacking my lips in the hopes of conveying my extreme thirst. 

�Oh, you must be thirsty. Well I can get you some water, but first let&#8217;s get your feeding over with� Janet brought over the small can that she had come in with. Peeling back an aluminum lid she set it down before me. 

�Can peaches seemed like the healthiest thing in the vending machine, so that&#8217;s what you get.� She pushed it over to the front of my face and I realized that I was meant to eat from it like a dish. Good thing I had had practice at this during our weekend at the cabin. I lowered my face to the dish and plunged my mouth in to the small can, sucking and slurping up as much as I could. The peaches were sweet and the contents of the can were unfortunately rather soupy. Within minutes I had all but licked the can clean, and I was certain my face bore the remnants of my meager meal, as did part of the floor around me. Janet pulled the can away and moved to the sink. She filled the empty can with water and then set it back down before me. 

�Drink up� were her only instructions. I set to and lapped the water with my tongue. It was lukewarm, but I was in no position to protest. I had no idea how dehydrated I actually was as I could feel each sip trickle down my dry throat. I continued to lap hastily but seconds later Janet pushed the tin aside with her foot. Her bare foot now before me she reached over and grabbed a fistful of my hair. Yanking it backward my head cocked back and I let out a tiny yelp but was quick to silence myself, lest I be re-gagged in some horrible fashion. 

�Now bitch, you&#8217;re going to lick my feet clean with your tongue, understood?� 

Fearful of speaking out I offered barely a whispered response of �Y-y-es Mistress.� 

Janet released my hair from her grasp and I lowered my head slowly to her waiting foot. I bowed my head slowly and kissed her big toe softly. I moved down the line and offered soft kisses at each toe and ..CRACK! 
I felt the palm of Janet&#8217;s hand to the side of my face and recoiled quickly. I looked up at her fearfully. 

�I told you to lick, slave. No one said kiss� she taunted. 

Still smarting from the sting of her smack I quickly complied and extended my tongue to her toes. I rubbed my tongue back and forth over the bottom of her toes and the sole of her extended foot. I vigorously bobbed my head up and down taking each toe fully in my mouth and sucking diligently. I did not divert my attention from the task at hand and I was sure to keep my focus on cleaning adequately. I was disgusted by my actions, but I was not willing to incur any further discipline at her hand. When she was satisfied that I had addressed her one foot well enough she offered the other and I quickly set to work in a similar fashion. She began to force more of her foot in to my mouth as I sucked and licked, at one point forcing all five toes in. She seemed especially pleased as I choked back and endeavored to apply my tongue to the mouthful. 

�Look at you slave, you suck my foot like Tom&#8217;s cock. Enjoy the taste because you&#8217;ll be tongue bathing every inch of your Master and Mistress once we&#8217;ve got you home. My feet will probably become the one thing you actually look forward to every day� 

I had to give it to Janet. As sadistically cruel as Tom was, Janet always had a way of instilling an even greater sense of dread about what lay ahead. At first I had seen her as a clear second fiddle in what appeared to be Tom&#8217;s fantasy weekend. But that was before the true nature of my enslavement dawned on me and I saw what an equal role they both played in snatching me from society and taking me as their prisoner. I failed to give any response to the tort but rather continued to work her foot over with my mouth as if it was my last meal. I figured the more vigorous I worked, the more at ease she&#8217;d be and the less inclined she would be to inflict pain. 

From the corner of my eye I noticed the push open a little more and Tom leaned up against the side of the wall to casually observe. 

�Our slave is sure learning what that mouth of his is for. Why don&#8217;t you give him a real treat and sit that beautiful pussy of yours on his face.� He suggested. 

Janet pulled her feet from me. �Funny you should mention, I was just thinking I&#8217;d like to sit on that mouth, but I was thinking maybe she clean out my asshole first � She giggled. 

Tom nodded is head in agreement. �That&#8217;s a good idea sweetheart, go on a roll over slave, she&#8217;s going to really put you to work now.� He addressed me. 

My heart fell to my stomach (as best it could from laying on my belly on a bathroom floor) and I wretched at the thought. In an extremely reluctant and slow fashion I began rotating over to my back. I kicked my knees up and my arms came to be pinned under me, the leather bondage mittens holding me up ever so slightly. Janet for her part began to pull down her leggings. 

As she was pulling her leg out there came a loud knock at the door out of the room! It came so quickly and out of nowhere that all three of us seemed to jump a little. Tom&#8217;s eyes immediately shot to Janet and I saw a look of sheer panic in his eyes. 

�Get him� was all he had time to say before quickly shutting the bathroom door and disappearing into the room. 

Janet, for her part, all but fell on top of me as she lurched to the ground. Before it even dawned on me to cry out she cupped a hand forcefully over my mouth and grabbed me from behind, pushing my head further in to her smothering hand. She did not speak, she only stared at me with an intense scowl on her face. She was laying on top of me and her legs had wrapped around my bound one&#8217;s further keeping me still. I realized as I breathed deeply from my nose to avoid suffocating that I had possibly just missed the one opportunity I had to scream out to others for help and be heard. 

The bathroom was silent except for my breathing. In the other room Tom seemed to be rummaging through luggage or something but he had yet to address the person at the door. I heard another knock come loudly. In response Janet pressed harder covering my mouth. I heard the click of the front door of the room open and then there were voices. One was clearly Tom&#8217;s. The other I could not make out. There was an exchange of dialogue that went back and forth. What were they discussing? Had their been a complaint? Could anyone have possibly seen me, or gotten wind of what may be going on this room. My hope turned suddenly to the fact that with the door slightly open to the bathroom and Tom leaning in, maybe someone could&#8217;ve seen in from the window (presuming of course there was a window�I had still never seen outside the bathroom). As the talking continued Janet removed the hand from behind my head. I hit the floor with the back of my skull producing a dull thud noise. Her hand remained over my mouth and she was squeezing very hard to prevent any utterances, not that I had tried.

 She seemed to be reaching for something on the floor with her free hand and I wondered if this was my chance. From my position on my back I may be able to buck upward and knock Janet off balance and off of me. If her hand came free from my mouth I could quickly scream and alert whoever was at the door. I steadied myself and committed to this course of action. Convincing myself it was the only way out I tightened my leg muscles in anticipation of kicking upward. I flexed and was about to spring up when Janet quickly found what she was searching for and moved an object quickly to my face. 

The blinking red light on the remote in her hand told me everything she was thinking. She mouthed the words silently &#8216;Don&#8217;t think even think about it&#8217; softly. With her thumb I saw her rotating a dial on the remote and I concluded she was adjusting the frequency to a very severe shock level. I tried to nod my head as best I could in order to tell her I understood and would be quiet, but it was quite well pinned against the ground. The voices in the room abruptly ceased and I heard the sound of the door closing shut. Foot steps fast approached the bathroom door and it was pulled open a crack. 

Tom basically slid in through the ajar door and shut it quickly behind him. For a moment, all three of us were silent in the dark. He eventually moved his hand up to the light switch and illuminated the tiny room. There was sweat on his brow and he was breathing heavily. 

Janet looked up at him almost pleadingly, but he simply shook his head &#8216;no.&#8217; 

�It&#8217;s alright baby, everything&#8217;s alright�� he got out between deep breaths as he tried to calm his nerves. 

Alright?! Everything is alright?! From who&#8217;s perspective?! I fumed silently to myself. 

�Just the front desk clerk. He was asking if we would need to baggage cart again in the morning, so he could set it aside for us.� 

�Is he gone?� Janet queried. 

�I told him we&#8217;d need it bright and early and then sent him on his way.� 

�Did he�Do you think he�� she trailed off

�Definetly not. The door to here was closed before I answered, and you know there&#8217;s no looking in through those drawn curtains. He didn&#8217;t see anything.� 

The two of them smiled at eachother and then shared a bit of a laugh. Janet turned her attention towards me, where she still held a firmly cupped hand to my mouth. �That was a little too close, now wasn&#8217;t it slave?� She taunted. 

Tom took over, �I think play times over. It&#8217;s time to bundle him up for the night and then we&#8217;ll get out of Dodge first thing in the morning. Let&#8217;s get him up.� 

He came over to where I lay. Janet removed her hand and they both paused, looking at me. I knew they were waiting for my reaction, would I speak, yell, scream or simply stay silent. Since they were on top of me as is I elected the latter and simply looked away. I failed to see if this pleased them in any way as the next thing I knew they were raising me by my arms. They sat me down on the toilet seat. 

�I&#8217;ll get the bag� said Tom turning and leaving the room. Janet turned to me and held a finger to my lips.

�Good slave� she said in a shooshing manner. She let her finger pick up at my closed lips. Prying them apart she moved it in to my mouth slowly. Instinctively I sucked it gently. A smile crossed her lips and she began sliding it in and out. I obliged her little game in my continued effort to garner their favor for my benefit. 

�Now I see why Tom is so fond of this mouth.� She teased. Moments later Tom re-entered and she pulled her finger from my mouth. I stayed silent. 

He laid a gym bag on the floor and unzipped it. 

�We&#8217;ll prop him up in the shower.�&nbsp; He said to Janet. And then turning to me, �We&#8217;re going to undue your ankle strap, I don&#8217;t need to tell you how to act.� He then set to unbinding my ankle. I almost could not believe it. Only a few hours ago I was packed away inside a leather sack, buried under luggage and tied tighter than I ever imagined a person could sustain. Now I sat between my captors with only a pair of handcuffs and leather mittens preventing me from lashing back out and initiating an escape. Of course the collar around my neck still posed a problem. A quick dart of my eyes observed that Janet had it in the palm of her hand. A feeling of defeat swept back over me. I watched her closely out of the corner of my eye. If she were to set it down, that would be my chance. 

�On your feet.� Tom barked. I rose and stood between them. �Now get into the shower.� He placed two hands on my shoulders as I turned and, one foot at a time, stepped into the tub and shower. Tom reached into the bag and pulled out a roll of duct tape. He climbed into the small tub where I stood naked and cuffed. Kneeling next to me he ordered my ankles together and then proceeded to wrap tape around them. After five or six times around he cut the tape and smoothed it off. He did the same with my legs directly above the knees. Then, standing, he wrapped the duct tape around my chest several times, pinning my arms to my body as they remained cuffed behind me. And just like that I was once again immobilized�.upright�but incapable of movement. Just for kickers, Janet chose this time to go and set the remote to my collar down on the bathroom sink. 

�Gag please, doll.� Tom asked of his wife. Janet reached down into the bag and produced the all too familiar green foam ball-gag that they used on me for a good deal of the past weekend. Tom took it from here and raising it to my mouth commanded me to open. I did as instructed and once again the large foam ball was pushed in and forced my jaw open wide. He buckled it behind my head quite tightly. Not quite satisfied, he picked up the roll of duct tape and went to work wrapping it around my head and over the ball gag, muffling any sounds I could possibly hope to make. My eyes watered slightly due to the bulging ball in my mouth and the extremely tight wrapping that encased my mouth. 

�You&#8217;ve probably had these on long enough� Tom said as he reached behind me and began to unstring the leather mittens. They had been on for my entire trip from the cabin and I wiggled my fingers as soon as they were free, restoring blood to them and shaking off the sweat that had accumulated within them.

�Now put your palms flat together, that freedom is going to be shortlived.� As I placed my hands flat together, Tom took the duct tape roll and wrapped the metallic colored binding around them, effectively neutralizing my fingers ability to meddle yet again. 

Tom went back to the bag and set the tape aside. Thankfully. However, next he pulled out a roll of saran wrap which completely puzzled me at first. Janet, sensing the question in my head decided to fill me in on the details. 

�We&#8217;re going to mummify you, slave. Can&#8217;t have you wiggling and struggling all night while we&#8217;re trying to get our beauty rest.� 

Tom was back in the tub immediately, and beginning at my feet he wrapped the clingy, clear material around my ankles, up my shins, around my thighs and so forth. He continued all the way up my body, slowly and deliberately, pulling the unyielding plastic wrap tight with every rotation. I stood there completely dejected. In a matter of moments they had once again made me completely helpless and with little hope of escape. Tom finished off the roll after numerous times around my chest. He smiled at me and began to rub his hands over my mummified form. 

�Nice and smooth, slave.� He said as he pulled my form close to him. One arm he put over my shoulder. He grabbed my chin with the other and turned my face towards his. 

�You feel how helpless you are right now? Don&#8217;t you?!� he hissed. 

His hand helped to force my chin to nod. 

�Good, this is one of the hundreds of ways that we&#8217;ll be putting you away for the night from now on. Janet and I think it&#8217;s important that you are always left in incredibly tight bondage. Where we&#8217;ll be keeping you at home, no one will ever find you and you can scream to your hearts content, but they won&#8217;t hear you. But we&#8217;re still gonna gag your bitch ass, just so you know that we are in complete control of when you speak. We&#8217;re in control of every part of your life, and don&#8217;t you ever forget it.� He patted my cheak. 

Janet walked over and helped herself into the tub where we all stood. She too ran her hands up and down my encased form. 

�Honey, hearing you talk that way has got me all sorts of hot and bothered. And since I didn&#8217;t get to sit on our slave&#8217;s face, I&#8217;m gonna need you to give me some lovin. Let&#8217;s leash him and be done with it already� She pleaded. Tom was clearly keen to this suggestion. He went back to the bag and pulled out another long leather strap. Coming back he took it and knotted one end around my collar. Taking the other end he looped it over the shower rod and pulled it tight. 

I choked upward as my collar yanked my neck and it dragged up towards my chin. Tom continued to test the slack by pulling hard on the rod. Satisfied that it would hold, he stood up on the side of the tub and knotted the strap off along the rod. I was forced slightly up on the balls of my feet. Janet observed this closely. 

�Looks like he can stand alright, shouldn&#8217;t be in too much danger of choking, provided he stays nice and still.� She patted my butt a few times. I grunted into my gag as this caused me to sway slightly. I shifted the weight on my feet quickly and was able to keep myself from choking further. 

�One last finishing touch� Tom said heading back towards his &#8216;goody&#8217; bag yet again. He pulled out a small metal bell. Jingling it a few times in his hand he bobbed his head to the ringing noise it made. He approached me and taking a small piece of twine he attached to the bell to my collar, tying it off so that it hung slightly further down my neck. He batted it back and forth a few times and it continued to ring uncontrollably. Grabbing it, he halted the sounds. 

�This is so that we know when you&#8217;re fussing in here. If you start testing boundaries or trying to work on freeing yourself, this little puppy here will be enough to wake us. We recommend you just stand still and focus on keeping that pressure off your throat, because if we have to get up to ring this bell, it&#8217;s not going to be pleasant for you.� 

�Although we&#8217;ll probably enjoy it immensely� Janet joked. They stepped away from me and out of the tub. For the first time I noticed I could see my bound figure in the bathroom sink. I looked absurdly bizarre, wrapped up the way I was, tape completely covering the lower half of my face, straining forward to keep tension in the leash. The bell around the collar made me look like some perverse Christmas present of sorts. They 

Janet spoke. �We&#8217;ll be shutting this light off, but no need to blindfold you just yet. We don&#8217;t want to ruin those pretty eyes of yours, and you know we&#8217;ll be sure to blindfold you nice and tightly when we pack you up in the morning. But for now�enjoy. Toodles!� She blew me a kiss. 

�Goodnight slave� was all Tom said as he shut off the light. They both turned and walked out the door. Closing it I was once again cast into darkness. 

Janet was not lying. Within minutes of the door being closed and me being �put away� for the evening, the sounds of their sex began to leak in. I considered their perspective for a moment. How this must all just be one incredible turn-on for them. They were successfully turning their darkest and most perverted fantasy into a reality and I was the victim. Snatched from my normal vanilla life and reduced to an immobilized sex toy. I was sure that it was now Monday evening, that much of the outside world was still apparent to me. That meant that I had missed work today without explanation. I hoped that this would be the catalyst for triggering the series of events that would ultimately lead to a police report being filed. Of course I had no idea where in the country we currently were. The drive to the cabin had been a minimum of a few hours, and then a full days travel in any number of directions meant that it was impossible to conclude where we currently were. 

I swayed silently in the dark, periodically shifting my weight from the balls of my feet to the heels. There was a consistent tug at my neck collar given how taught Tom had leashed me to the shower rod. I experimented briefly with seeing if the pole could be broken. If I completely through my weight into it, was there a chance that it would snap under my weight before it had the chance to choke off my air completely. The noise from the break might alone be enough to rouse suspicion from somebody on the premises. 

The bell around my neck gave a ring as I stretched the leash. I froze. Thankfully there was no interruption to Tom and Janet&#8217;s sex in the adjacent room. They either had not heard the ring, or had chosen to ignore it since it did not indicate a significant amount of moving or struggling on my part. Still, this gave me warning that if I pursued the plan to break the shower rod, there would be a very finite window of time before they would be back upon me. The thing I struggled with (besides the obvious restraints) was that come morning we would once again be on the road; I would not doubt be packaged in a similar fashion as before. This could very well be the last time I was in a public setting�as private as they had made it. If they got me to their home, I was sure I would have little to no hope of escape. My mind was made up. I would bide time and endeavor to crush the bar in the middle of the night. At a minimum, if they were asleep I would have just a little bit more time before they would be able to respond. I steadied myself where I stood and listened quietly. 

Only a few minutes had passed when the door was opened and light once again flooded the room. I winced at the brightness. A naked Tom came sauntering in, his body glistened with sweat. As he closed the door behind him, I caught a glimpse of Janet lying naked over on the bed, clearly exhausted from this recent romp. Tom ignored me as he tended to relieving himself in the toilet. I looked away and tried to do nothing that would draw attention to me. Finishing he turned to me. 

�Once we get you to your new home, it&#8217;ll be your job to lick us both clean after sex. Tonight your off the hook since we need your mouth to stay shut for the time being.� He patted my duct taped cheek. 

�It&#8217;s too bad your gagged though, cause we saved you some desert.� Tom giggled as he showed me the used condom that he held by the tip in his left hand. I grimaced to myself but tried not to betray my disgust with my gaze. 

�I suppose we could save it for you for breakfast.� He mused. Thankfully, he reconsidered this idea and he tossed it aside in to the toilet. A quick flush assured me that it would not be an option for later. 

Tom looked me up and down for a moment and then appeared to have a realization. 

�You know�I&#8217;m just not certain this shower rod is a good idea. I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re dumb enough to try, but I could see your weight maybe pulling this down thinking you&#8217;d be able to get someone to come check on things.� He gave me a quizzical look as if he was trying to gauge whether this idea had crossed my mind. 

I averted my eyes to the floor but this did not prevent him from pressing the issue as I hoped. 

�Come to think of it, let&#8217;s re-work this just a bit.� 

Tom stepped into my shower prison. His body pressed up against my bound and cocooned form as he tugged at the knotted leash on the pole. It came undone moments later. Holding the leash in one hand and steadying me with his other he instructed me to lay down. 

I had no choice but to comply. He held me as I awkwardly bent my bound legs and I more or less fell backward into his arms. He lowered me steadily to the floor of the tub. I was put on my stomach. Taking the leash he tugged it and pulled the other end tight around the faucet that jutted outward about a foot or so above my head. He wrapped it numerous times to remove much slack and he tied it off just as my head was slightly raised by the pull of my collar.&nbsp; I could rest my chin of the floor of the tub, but did not have much room to move it to either side or to rest a check on the ground. Tom seemed pleased with the adjustment. 

�Much better. I prefer you on the ground like this. Less room for you too.� I stayed still as he got out of the tub and exited the bathroom. 

Once again I was cast into darkness. I surveyed the situation quickly and realized that there was absolutely no options left available to me. Bound as I was and leashed to the faucet I could never make it to my feet without strangling myself. I moaned into my gag in displeasure. I barely made a sound. I contemplated thrashing about, doing anything I could to pry something loose, but I knew this would be effort would be fruitless. I sobbed softly and felt my eyes begin to swell. There was nothing I could do now except wait patiently for the morning when we would once again set forth on the road and I would be that much closer to disappearing forever as their slave.&nbsp; 

The night passed without further interruption, although there would be no sleep for me. My joints burned from continued restraint, my jaw ached from countless gagging methods, and my mind raced with constant worry. When morning did come (I assumed it was morning), Tom and Janet entered quickly. I could not turn to greet them from my face down position in the tub, but I felt Tom begin to untie the leash from the faucet and I heard Janet&#8217;s voice. 

�Good morning slave. Good news, we&#8217;re all set for the tail end of our trip. Pretty soon we&#8217;ll have you back to your new home.� 

I groaned as Tom&#8217;s firm hands grabbed me by the shoulders and pulled me upward. I shuffled my wrapped legs forward to try and support myself as I was stood up in the tab. My eyes were still adjusting to the bright fluorescent light of the bathroom as my owner&#8217;s looked me up and down. Janet leaned forward and pressed her lips to my duct taped mouth. She held them there as she made a mock &#8216;kissing&#8217; sound. 

�This has worked out splendidly� she clapped to herself. 
Tom interjected. 

�We&#8217;re not out of the woods just yet. Time to package you back up and then get out of here before first light.�&nbsp; 

I won&#8217;t bore you with the details of what came next. Let&#8217;s just say it was eerily similar to the packaging process of before. Piece by piece different increments of my bondage was removed yet any type of freedom was shortlived as it was quicly replaced. Of course I never actually had the opportunity to break free and was secured constantly.&nbsp; 

I found myself strapped back into the hogtie and they rolled me over back on to the canvas sack. I watched as Tom toyed with the pump gag, palming it in his hand and looking at it quizzically. The numerous straps and the pump mechanism hung down from it and he seemed to be weighing whether or not to use it. As painful as it had been for the earlier car ride, it was essentially a moot point for me. Either way I wouldn&#8217;t be able to utter a sound. He arrived at a decision, tossing the contraption aside. 

�I think your gagged well enough. Didn&#8217;t really hear any peeps out of you last night one room over, so I doubt you&#8217;ll be making much noise sacked away in the back again.� His hand reached once more to my exposed nipple and he gave a firm squeeze. 

A muffled protest came out as barely a �mmmph� 

Janet leaned over and cupped a hand to my balls. She tugged hard. Despite the stars that instantly flooded my vision, my pain was once again silenced. 

They both seemed satisfied. Tom rose from his kneeled position over me. 

�Jan, why don&#8217;t you finish zipping him up, I&#8217;m gonna check us out of here.� He exited for the door. I was completely out of sight on one side of the bed when the door was opened and Janet knelt over me so there was zero chance of being noticed. The door slammed shut behind him.&nbsp; 

Janet reached over to where the bag of bondage instruments lay. I saw a flash of silver as she pulled the duct tape from it once more. She set it by here side and reached back in to pull out a small tube. Reaching in I saw her remove the blue putty substance that had packed my ears last time. She leaned over and began squising it in to my left ear. As her fingers pushed it in the sound once again slowly disappeared from my world. She packed the right one equally full and hearing was no longer one of my senses. Taking the roll of tape she pulled it loose and began wrapping additional tape over my gag. Apparently she was not fully satisfied with how silenced I was. She tore it loose and smoothed it over against my cheek. I mewed softly. 

Janet leaned back and looked me over with a grin of satisfaction. I looked up at her pleadingly. I knew there was no hope for mercy, but I endeavored to appeal to some sort of subconscious motherly instinct or delicate feminine nature. Her lips were moving so I knew she was replying to my gaze, although I could not hear a word of it. She sat back a bit and lifted a bare foot to my face. I tried to move aside but my bonds held me in place. She pressed her foot firmly against my face and slid my nose between her two big toes. I imagined she was doing this as some sort of taunt, or as a response to my pleading look. She left it there, pressed to my nostrils and I was quickly forced to breathe in as my gagged mouth prevented me from holding my breath in protest for more than a few seconds. She did not remove it and the two of us were still, alone in the room. What an odd site we must have made, if anyone were able to see us. I was truly in a position of defeat, and Janet was seizing the opportunity to remind me of my new role in this world. A bound and gagged gimp at her foot. 

I did not hear the door open, but a sudden kick to the rear let me know he had returned. Janet&#8217;s foot came free of my face and I saw Tom kneeling down towards me. He had the tape in his hand and taking my head with his other hand he set about wrapping a layer of tape over my eyes. My head dropped back to the hard ground as he finished and as fresh air disappeared from my nostrils I knew that my leather sack was being zipped up again for transport. I sighed to myself as the musty scent of the leather took over. I recalled how hot it had been last time and I could only hope that my confinement to it this time would not be as long. The feeling of the sack being lifted and placed on the unstable surface of the luggage cart keyed me in to the fact that we were leaving. A wave of regret washed over me and I truly found myself resigned to the fate that lay ahead. We were leaving the motel and Tom and Janet had successfully kept me hidden the whole time. Truth be told, the smarter move would probably have been to keep me in the sack and in the car for the entire time�as uncomfortable as it would have been I would&#8217;ve avoided having to please Tom orally and the floor of the bathroom was not THAT much more comforting. 

The dolly began moving.










Author&#8217;s Notes: 
*It&#8217;s been quite some time since I last updated this tail. When I sat down to begin the continuation of the saga, I struggled with what direction to take it. I became intrigued with the idea of switching the perspective from that of the kidnapped slave to that of one his captors. I settled on advancing the story by having it told through the eyes of Janet, Tom&#8217;s wife. 
*For any who missed it &#8211; Part 7 of this story is not entirely a re-print of Part 6. There is additional story added on that moves the events forward. 
*The last chapter of &#8216;Second Thoughts&#8217; concluded with Tom and Janet almost complete with their objective of kidnapping and enslaving Mike. A year has passed since their plan unfolded over the course of that fateful weekend. We pick up the tale now from Janet&#8217;s perspective. 


The days can sometimes pass so quickly! I happened to glance up at the clock above the librarian&#8217;s check-out desk. It pointed to the fact that it was almost 4pm. Almost time for my shift to end. I turned to my co-worker. 

�Barbara, would you excuse me for a moment, I want to go grab something before I leave today. If Linda shows, would you let her know that all the periodicals over there need to be logged back in?� 

�Sure thing, Jan�&nbsp; 

And with that I scooted from my chair behind the desk and made my way back to towards the reference section. I loved it there at the &lt;City Removed&gt; Local Library. I&#8217;d only been there part-time for about 3 months, but Tom had been right, it truly was a pleasant distraction for me and it was good to get out of the house. The pay isn&#8217;t anything spectacular but it gave me a little extra spending cash and the other women there were delightful and fun to talk with. 

I made my way to the section on Health &amp; Maintenance. I was quickly learning my way around the place and really found it to be tremendously helpful�.So much information right at your fingertips! Plus, with everybody relying on the internet, the library had become even more quiet than I remembered from my youth. 

The book I was seeking jumped out at me as I scanned the area devoted to first aid. 

&#8216;Cuts, Gashes, Bruises &#8211; Wound Care 101&#8217; read the title. 

I pulled the item from the shelve and headed over to the copier. I fumbled in my pocket for my employee scan card and placed it in the machine. As I thumbed through the pages I thought &#8216;this is a waste of time, just check the darn thing out&#8217;, but I remembered Tom&#8217;s words clearly &#8211; don&#8217;t ever check out anything we&#8217;re using for him, simply make copies. 

That&#8217;s why I loved my Tom so, he was much smarter than me and I relied on him to always steer us right. I found the pages I was looking for and proceeded to copy about 7 or 8 that seemed particularly relevant. Finishing up I took the warm pages and folded them over. Returning the book to the shelf I made my way back to the front desk. 

Linda had yet to arrive (she typically ran late) and I gave my best to Barb as I took my purse and clocked out for the day. Leaving the building I was greeted by the warm sun, such a pleasant contradiction to the ultra-cool temperature we maintained in the building. 

&#8216;What a beautiful day for an anniversary&#8217; I mused to myself. I headed to the parking lot and quickly found the large Chevy Avalanche parked in my usual space under the tree. I had almost forgot that Tom had taken my car to get work done on it this morning and I was stuck driving this behemoth of a vehicle. I never minded it when Tom was driving, it was nice to be up high and to have all that cargo space, but it was a little much for me. The peaceful scenic drive home through our little suburban town was always such a nice end to my days. I was always out ahead of the rush hour, which wasn&#8217;t much to begin with anyway, and it took only 10 minutes door to door. 

Pulling onto our street I found I had butterflies in my stomach. I was almost giddy and bubbling over with anticipation of getting home. Sure, most days I felt a similar tingle when I came to our block as I was always looking forward to getting back home &#8211; but tonight would be different &#8211; tonight would be special.&nbsp; 

Our house came into view as I neared the end of the block. Pulling into the driveway I opened the garage door via the opener. I surveyed our house as I waited patiently for the door to come up. Tom would have to mow the lawn before the weekend, I had seen they were calling for rain. The one level rambler was also in need of a new paint job and we could probably also afford to address the roof which had started to show a missing shingles. Of course Tom would say that money was too tight and that we had spent too much on the &#8216;other&#8217; renovation, but these things are important, and if it meant cutting back in a few other areas, I was on board. 

Parking the large vehicle inside I let myself down and into the house via the door in the garage. The scratching on the other side let me know that my babies were itching to get out. I opened the door and both dogs came bounding out, almost knocking me over. I greeted them with the daily routine of hugs and kisses and let them set about doing their business outside. I left the door open since they knew to come right back in if they cared for supper and entered the abode. 

Entering the kitchen I made sure to stomp my feet a bit on the floor. I always liked him to know when I was back. I set my bag down on the kitchen table and got myself a drink of water. Looking out into the backyard I thought about some weeding that I should do and wondered if the azalea bush needed a trim. It would be a while before Tom was home and the preparation for that evening&#8217;s meal could wait a bit. I checked the steak I had left defrosting by the sink that morning and confirmed this. 

The dogs came running back into the house and I went back into their room to set out their dinners. Afterward I would put them out on the runner in the backyard. Exercise was important for them, especially after being cooped up inside for most of the day. 
Which reminded me, I had things to tend to.&nbsp; 

Tom and I were much like any other working couple who left the house for the day. We had a routine and it was important. Just like anybody I loved getting home at the end of the day, enjoying a nice meal, having a drink and unwinding. However, there was quite a difference between my daily routine and that of the typical suburban woman. 

I left the kitchen and walked through the living room. I stopped over by the stairs to the basement and gave myself a once-over in the half-mirror in the dining room. My short dark hair seemed like a mop upon my head. I turned sideways to review my 48 year old figure. I had lost about 10 pounds in the past month but I knew I could probably afford another 10-15. Tom always said he liked me just the way I was, but I knew I could be better. I wore a white blouse and black pants. I always wore flats when working since I was on my feet for most of the day. I kicked these off where I stood and opened the door to the basement. 

I flicked the light switch to my right and it illuminated the steps downward. We had re-carpeted the place a little over a year back and the plush material was comfy beneath my stockinged feet. It was only about 15 steps down and reaching the bottom I flicked another switch. The room came into view. It was rather plain and drab, much like any basement. The carpet gave it a �roomier� feel and the lights along the ceiling gave us nice light. We had cleared a great deal and removed much of the clutter when we were putting&nbsp; down the carpet and now there were only a few pieces of furniture remaining as well as a treadmill. The exercise machine wasn&#8217;t intended for me, although I did use it on occasion. We had put a small black and white tv in front of it although it didn&#8217;t get many channels and the reception wasn&#8217;t very good. I would much rather walk through the surrounding neighborhoods than be confined to working out in the basement. Confined! That reminded me. 

I made my way back towards the far wall. We had decorated this area with two large book shelves on either side and a large afghan rug had been hung against the wall. Walking over to it I stopped and picked something up off the floor. 

&#8216;How careless&#8217; I thought as I picked up the leather item. Tom must&#8217;ve left it from this morning since I didn&#8217;t recall being down here since the prior evening. A warm smile came to my face as I thought about last evening. An even warmer feeling spread to my loins as I thought about what lay ahead for this evening. Fingering the leather material in my hand I decided to put it on. 

I&#8217;ll admit that most women probably don&#8217;t have &#8216;donning a leather mask&#8217; as part their after-work routine each day, but then again, most women probably didn&#8217;t do anything similar to what I was about to do. I tugged the mask tight over my head, adjusting the eye spaces until I could see clearly. I snapped it tight in the back and it pinched my hair slightly. I pulled back the zipper that kept the mouth hole shut and licked my lips. There really was no logical reason to wear the mask, at least as far as identity concealment was concerned. But there was something about its smell, and the way it fit to my head that I enjoyed. I think it also helped put me in the right frame of mind; Tom had always said it made us look much more intimidating. I reached for a chord that hung down one side of the large rug and pulling it sharply the material was cast aside and revealed another door. It was only about 5 feet high, smaller than a typical doorway, but this was so the top frame would not be noticed above the decorative rug (again, Tom&#8217;s ingenuity). There was a combination - lock much like you would find on a gym locker - on the door that latched above the knob. I slowly turned the combination and it clicked open. I smiled as it always irritated me if I had to try it more than once. I gave the lock a rough shake, letting the metal clinking give further notice that the lady of the house had returned. Casting the lock aside, I slowly opened the door and stepped into the space.&nbsp; 

�Hello slave�mommy&#8217;s home� I spoke as I fumbled in the dark for a string hanging from the ceiling light. It took me a moment but my hand soon found it. I pulled down and a dim light came on. 

The room was not particularly big, but it was larger than a closet. We had spec&#8217;d it as a �guestroom� but even the builder had mentioned it&#8217;d be difficult to get a bed and anything else in there. That was ok, what would we need a bed for when we had a cage. 

I gazed at the metal contraption in the center of the room and quivered�I never ceased to be excited by the vision that greeted me each day. There, securely positioned and restrained was our slave! Such a wonderful sight to behold! The scene was something I came home to every day and cherished. He was inside our steel cage. We had bought it specifically for him. I had thought our old dog cages would suffice but Tom, once again, new better. He said those would allow him too much movement�and boy did Tom go to lengths to ensure our slave stayed put! 

I strolled over to him and took a closer look at how Tom had left him for the day. The cage itself was in the style of a crate with interlocking pieces that latched into a box. It was padlocked as well and functioned with the same key I wore around my neck. Inside he knelt in a bound and locked position. Tom had bought him knee pads some time ago after we noticed significant bruising from the cage bottom.&nbsp; 

He was hooded, although not with the type of leather mask I currently wore. His was a stocking knit hood with eye and nasal slots and a mouth hole that snuggly fit to his now smooth head. We had begun to shave his head about five months back since we found we enjoyed the smooth bald cut much better to his old full head of hair given the numerous types of hoods and gags we would use on him. Tom had tied a blue bandana securely over his eyes as a blindfold and in his mouth was our new harness ball gag. I was particularly fond of this one as it had a large bright yellow ball and red harnesses that buckled under the chin and laced together up above the bridge of his nose. Leather straps pulled his upper arms almost together behind him and a simple pair of steel cuffs secured his wrists.&nbsp; 

Around his neck was a large, black posture collar. There were ring circles all around it. When Tom would put him �away� for the day he typically ran a chord or a lock through this circle and locked it to the top of the cage. Today he had used a piece of rope that he ran through the collar ring and up and under the slave&#8217;s upper arm leather bindings. He tied it off on the top bars of the crate effectively keeping him immobile and secured to the top. His head drooped slightly past the posture collar although it did not allow for much give. I continued to circle the cage. He knew I was there. I had heard a slight rattle as I opened the door and I knew this meant he was stiffening and making sure he was upright and demonstrating good posture (well, as much as could be expected for someone in his position.) I loved to tap the cage with my foot as I walked. His head would tilt in that direction, craning to hear and to try and deduce what was going on.&nbsp; 

His ankles and thighs wore leather cuffs that we had hobbled with 8 inch connector chains. This would allow for him to hobble when he was on his feet, but there was no concern of too much movement. I moved to his backside and looked down. His beautifully firm and shorn anus was empty. 

�I see Master left you unplugged today. You must have done a very good job pleasing him this morning, slave� I mused. There came no reply. He had learned quite some time ago that a gag meant &#8216;be silent&#8217;, and he no longer fought to speak through them. There was a time when he constantly failed to acknowledge this. Hell, just transporting him to the house he would mew and whine so often that we damn near choked him to death keeping him quiet. And then there was the adjustment period. It took a good deal of time for him to finally break. There was a many a day that I would come home and just listen outside the door to his room and hear his faint sobs muffled against whatever gag we had felt like using that morning. But now�.now it was just silence. He had been broken. 

I continued my observation by kneeling down next to the bars and clutching them between my hands. I strained to see in the dim light of the room whether the towel beneath him appeared damp. From what I could detect it appeared dry. 

�And I see you held your water today. That pleases your Mistress. Looks like you won&#8217;t have to get THAT punishment again.� I emphasized the word so he would know what I was referencing. There was no movement or response on his end except the faintest rattle of chain as he shifted his weight ever so slightly. The only sound that escaped was the gentle, deep breathing through his nostrils. 

I stayed silent just looking him over. I could watch him for hours like this (and in fact I probably had). He was a great source of pride for me, for Tom too I suspected. Sure Tom was rougher than I in dealing with him, but I knew that was a male thing. We had both set out to make him ours and we had succeeded beyond our wildest dreams. It seemed like only yesterday that we had met him in that parking lot, but truth be told it was a year ago. A full year ago today in fact, and that was the cause of our planned little celebration this evening. Tom would be home in a while, and there was much to prepare before that. And, of course, there was a routine to tend to. 

I knelt down to the front of the cage and looked directly at the blindfolded and gagged face of my beast.&nbsp; 

�Time to get you out� I informed him. My key entered the lock and I twisted it free. Unhooking a latch I slowly opened the door. I rose and walked to the side. I dug my nails into the chord that lashed his arm bindings to the roof of the cage. After prying for a few moments the knot loosened. Whipping the chord away he lurched forward slightly, catching himself on his knees and grunting into his harness ball gag.&nbsp; 

I took the rope over to a box in the corner of the room. Lifting the lid I placed it neatly back in and surveying the contents I found the leash I was looking for. I was back at the cage door a moment later and found that he had already moved his head forward in anticipation of the leashing. I latched it to the ring collar and gave a slight tug. The naked male moved one knee forward and then the other until he was able to maneuver himself from the cage. He remained on his knees, awaiting my instruction. I withheld the command for a moment, appreciating the obedience bred by repetition. 

�Up� I finally ordered. 

This was no easy task with the two hobble chains, and the stiffness of being in such a compact position for the past 5-6 hours. I gave him space as he shifted his weight from knee to knee and planted a heel to push off on. He wobbled slightly but was able to right himself and finally rose to stand at bound attention beside me. A tug of the leash brought him a few steps forward to where I needed him. I took my end of his leash and looped the end around the hook that jutted out from the wall before us. Leaving him for a brief moment I retrieved an item from the other corner. I sat the bucket at his feet and nudged it against his shins so he knew it was there. I slapped his rear, commanding him, 

�Piss, slave� 

I stepped back and waited. Nothing happened. A few moments passed and the delay irked me. I slapped his bare ass again, this time with the intent to sting. 

�Now slave!� in a stern voice. 

�Mmmmphphpgggg� came a muffled plea. I moved to strike him in the face for the noise but my eye quickly caught something I had forgotten about. 

�Oh�that�� I giggled aloud. �Well, I suppose this is my fault.� I admitted seeing that his manhood was currently covered in a nylon encasement and bound tightly with more chord. We kept our slave in constant chastity, and usually utilized a small metallic chastity device that locked shut. It appeared that Tom had favored an unusual method of bondage on his cock this morning. 

�What do we have hear?� I queried as my nails moved to the bound genitals. I pulled and prodded as I looked for where to untie the chord and I felt his penis immediately strain against its bonds, longing for the release it had been denied for so long. 

�This must be torture for you, slave. To have a woman fondling you and yet knowing that there&#8217;s no pleasure ahead for you� I teased as I began to untie the chord. It came loose and required much unwinding from around the nylon encased shaft. Tom had also tied it along the center of the scrotum and had tied each of his balls apart separately. I also noticed a hint of eucalyptus smell in the air and it dawned on me that Tom had rubbed him with the sensitizing lotion prior to packaging him. The burning sensation, coupled with the pain of the binding must have been excruciating for some time. I smiled to myself at how devious Tom could be. 

I pulled free the chord and the nylon and cast it aside. 

�There you go, now piss� I said stepping away again. He fidgeted for a moment but then the stream came spilling into the bucket. He finished and I picked up the bucket and left the room. I went to the old laundry sink at the far end of the basement and dumped it down the drain. I thought about using it for some other purpose, but I wasn&#8217;t feeling potentially sadistic today. There were times when Tom and I would place him in some sort of compromising position�say, bound standing on one leg with the other pulled up behind him. We would place the bucket atop his head and then watch him struggle to maintain his balance. Of course, if he was too successful, it might require the occasional flogger to the rear to see if we might be able to break his concentration. Another favorite involved a homemade toy that Tom had come up with. It involved taking a strong rubber balloon and filling it with his urine. Tying it off he would place it in our slaves mouth. While this wasn&#8217;t an extremely effective gag, if he moved his mouth too much the balloon would explode and spill Tom&#8217;s piss down his throat. We typically bound him to a chair for this and then would take great delight in clipping our most sadistic pair of alligator nipple clamps to his chest. He would writhe in pain and do his absolute best to keep silent, yet the clamps would always win and as he bit down in pain we would watch him suffer the additional torture. While both games were quite fun, I decided that I would not amuse myself with either at this time. 

Walking back to the unveiled chamber I entered and pulled his leash from the wall. Tugging it, I directed him out. The hobble chains meant he could not move very quickly and I was patient with him as he stumbled forward blindly. I brought him into the light of the main basement and commanded him to be still. I considered re-binding his genitals but their bright red hue made me reticent; they had been through enough today. My hands went to his back and in particular to his shoulders. His back bore the marks of many a whipping. Some appeared particularly fresh and I noted their glassy appearance as a sign that Tom had put some Neosporin on them before he left. I reached to his right shoulder and a flesh colored band-aid that covered a patch. Peeling it back he could not help but cry into his gag. I did not reprimand him for I knew it must be particularly painful. The wound below the band-aid was quite deep and was the result of a repetitive whipping while he knelt. This had been my doing and I had actually felt a tinge of regret for hurting him so. Nevertheless, he was my slave; my property, to do with as I wished. Tom had chastised me for feeling bad for the mishap and as a punishment to the slave he had not treated the wound. Now it had become quite discolored and I was concerned about possible infection, hence the book I photocopied at the library. I placed a fresh bandage back over it and determined it did not look worse than the day before. I would review the literature in the morning and see how best to treat it. 

Tugging further on the leash I led my slave back towards the laundry sink. I pushed him up against it and secured the leash to one of the faucet handles. I reached up to the back of the ball-gag harness and unstrapped it. 

�Silence� was all I had to say as I pulled it forward from his lips. His compliance of late pleased me greatly. He had been trained quite well. Not that it mattered being down in the basement of our private home, but it was another sign of how broken he truly was. There were times when we first started with this daily protocol that he would attempt to talk and to plead with me. Tom said this was because he considered me the weaker sex. Nevertheless, Tom advised that he handle the daily routine for the next week just to help correct this behavior. I didn&#8217;t ask questions. All I know is the following week when I resumed tending to him in the late afternoons he did not attempt talking to me. Tom was good that way. 

Removing the gag I set it aside and watched the drool spill helplessly from his mouth to his naked chest. His mouth was too stretched and sore to catch it. As he began to loosen his jaw I grabbed the bottle of Listerine we kept by the sink. Raising it to his mouth he instinctively tilted back and allowed me to pour him a mouthful. He swigged for about a minute until I gave him a pat on the rear and he leaned forward depositing it down the drain. 

I raised the toothbrush with toothpaste I had prepared to his mouth as well. He opened wide and permitted me to brush. Tom thought this was a waste of time, however I was adamant about the fact that I wanted us to help him maintain good hygiene. If he was ours forever then we might as well keep him in usable shape. Nobody wanted a slave that would stink due to hours of confinement and laying in its own filth! I finished brushing and permitted him to spit. I put a hand to the back of his blindfolded and hooded head. I forcefully pulled him closer to me and reaching up I brought my mouth to his. Without speaking a word I forced my tongue into his agape mouth and kissed him roughly. His mouth made little effort to return the favor, but rather just permitted the invasion of my lips and tongue. It drove me wild to kiss him like this, I found it to be extremely passionate�at least for me. It added a flair of romance to the whole situation, that this was still about sex and sensuality, even though he was bound and chained. I bit down firmly on his lip for good measure and he whimpered ever so slightly. I released his head and he remained at attention with his head bowed. 

I wiped my mouth a bit and brought my finger to his lips. He instinctively began to suck on it, reacting with haste. I ran my other hand over my breasts as he sucked my finger like a cock. I could feel myself getting moist and becoming immensely aroused. I knew I should cut this little interaction short and focus on more important items, but sometimes its just nice to enjoy the things that are yours. 

�Good slave� I cooed. After a minute or so I pulled loose, playfully pushing him in the chest a bit as if I were being the tease. I took his leash from the sink. 

�Let&#8217;s get you your exercise� and I led him by leash over towards the treadmill. As we reached it I allowed him to hobble ahead of me and he felt around blindly with his chained feet until he found the step up. He struggled up on it and walked forward a few feet. He had clearly memorized the space between him and the settings panel and he waited now for me. 

I took the leash and tied it off to one of the heart rate sensor bars by the panel. I also reached down and removed the chain from between his ankle cuffs. The chain between the knees would remain. I also undid the leather strap that bound his upper arms together but was sure to leave his wrists secured in the metallic wrist cuffs. I undid his blindfold and cast it aside and also pulled the stocking hood from his face. His eyes winced shut in the blinding light, having been in darkness for hours. I ran my hand over his now bald head. It was becoming slightly stubbly and would probably need to be shaved again within the week. I glanced across the room where I had left the multi-strap harness ball-gag. Deciding I didn&#8217;t want to deal with all of the straps and buckles I opted instead for the roll of duct tape that rested on a chair by the treadmill. I tore loose a single piece and pressed it over his lips. I smoothed it over a few times to make sure it held and patted him on the cheek. I knew this wasn&#8217;t the most effective way of keeping him quiet, but it was more about instructing him to maintain silence. His eyes were slowly adjusting to the light and I stayed in front of him a moment. Our gazes met briefly, and he looked into my eyes that stared back through my leather hood. He quickly averted his glance. This was another Tom rule, he demanded no eye contact. I didn&#8217;t feel as strongly about it, but I understood the rationale behind the training. Always remind him that he&#8217;s in a position of inferiority. 

I commanded him to begin walking as I turned the machine in. He moved at a very slow place, still hobbled slightly at the knees. I set the machine for the usual level 2 setting which provided him with little more than the challenge of keeping a regular pace. The machine hummed and he began to keep up. I set the timer at 20 minutes and walked over to the small TV in front of it. Turning it on I flipped through a few channels before finding one where the black and white screen had the least static interruption. It was showing some infomercial for a series of books from Time Life. Turning the volume up slightly I headed for the chair from which I pulled the role of tape. I picked up a magazine that lay on the floor and sat down to begin reading. I began to feel warm inside the hood I wore and I unzipped it and pulled it off. My brow was damp and my hair was matted atop my head. I cast the hood aside and glanced up at him to make sure all was in order. Just like everyday he was walking straightforward and did not have to exert himself much to keep up with the tread. I smiled to myself as he could not see me. He intently watched the tv. I often wondered what went through his mind during this activity. Tom said he appreciated it and would come to crave it as his daily release the same way a prison inmate would savor time in the yard. It was also important that we have him using his muscles on a daily basis to prevent long-term atrophy. It simply is not practical to keep someone in a cage 24/7. He seemed to appreciate the modicum of freedom that this provided him. Sure he was still collared and leashed to the machine. Yes his wrists were also restrained and I had gagged him, but this was truly one of the more free positions he would typically find himself in and he probably appreciated it.

 Plus, he knew that one of us remained in the basement with him at all time any time he was brought out of his �room�. I would observe him a great deal and Tom had told me to specifically see if his eyes were wandering or if he seemed to be testing his bonds. Tom was overly cautious. It had been one full year and we had not once witnessed an attempt at escape. Not like that weekend back at the cabin when we first took him. Back then he had not yet been broken and had not yet grasped the permanent nature of his situation. That was when we had to control him with the old electric fence collar, now simple restraints was all it took. I knew he wasn&#8217;t going anywhere. He was our slave. Tucked away in our basement where no one would ever find him. 

I thumbed through the pages of a magazine rather haplessly. The goal was to give him about 20 minutes. The only noise in the room was the whir of the machine and the sound of his breathing through his nose. It tended to increase in volume and pace as he went. I wondered if it was absolutely necessary to have him gagged during this but Tom assured me it was. We had one &#8216;job&#8217; or &#8216;responsibility&#8217; as he put it, and that was to keep our secret slave silent. In my opinion, we did an excellent job of that. Looking back over the past year, I was amazed at what a thrill I derived from others not knowing about our slave. Tom and I led a fairly typical life outside of the basement. We enjoyed having company over for dinner and entertained quite frequently. I loved the idea of sitting down to a table with two other people who were completely oblivious about our secret. As talk would drift in and out of the mundane I often found my thoughts wondering to the bound and gagged man in a cage one floor below us. Tom would catch my eye and seem to know where my head was. He&#8217;d give me a fleeting wink of acknowledgement from time to time to let me know he was thinking the same thing. As soon as we said our goodbyes and were alone once again we&#8217;d find ourselves racing to the basement to play with our toy. 

Tom loved to taunt him on nights like these. 

�You know there were just people here, sitting down in our dining room right above you� he&#8217;d tease while taking him from behind. Our slave&#8217;s response was only to grunt into his gag.&nbsp; 

�Too bad you got there ball in your mouth, or maybe you could&#8217;ve told them you were down here.� 

There was a time when he used to protest these rear violations. He would buck as best he could against his bonds and would endeavor to cry out, but Tom had a way of quickly correcting this. He would simply inflict more pain, or tie him more tightly. Eventually he learned. 

Tom had developed an interesting relationship with our slave and I think it came from the fact that he used him in such an aggressive and sexual manner. Sure I loved the gratification our slave supplied, and I could let him eat me for hours on end, but Tom was addicted. Having this slave had changed his life. We had played and experimented with different forms of power exchange in our sex life, but as spouses there was always a limit. Now, with him, Tom was limitless and could push and explore all the boundaries he could think of. And explore he did. Tom, like me, enjoyed using many tools in his games�..
