Tanaka's Debt (a poem)
Provided By: BDSM Librarywww.bdsmlibrary.com
Synopsis: 






Remember, dear Tanaka if you can,
remember storming out, back in Japan,
you saying, any man who would submit
to me, a woman, he who would permit
my leadership was not a man at all,
despite my gang&#8217;s great strength, you would recall
an honor that you claimed your family had.
It wasn&#8217;t long before your son, your pride,
went missing, was it? Tanaka, confide
in me, a friend who wishes to enthrall.
He was your only son, as I recall,
a strapping boy who you were grooming for
success, your only heir, to carry your
Tanaka name and trade (in human slaves).
Police investigated for depraved
creatures, you must have known that it was I,
leads disappearing, cops afraid to die.
You must have been frustrated, agonized:
you saw what I can do antagonized.

Your eyes keep wandering, Tanaka-san,
I wonder if I&#8217;m boring you? Or can
it be that there&#8217;s something distracting you?
The huge strapon that Gogo wears in view
that bothers you? I warned her it is curt
to wear it underneath her schoolgirl skirt
but she cares not. She is insane you know,
unhinged, unsafe. I have a cool and plot-
ing mind, I calculate, but she does not.
She follows only her libido, and
 her lust, debasing all she can command.
You men are strange near strapons, swall&#8217;wing hard
and sweating- is it shock or it regard?
-or fear to be around it? &#8211;scared of my
command? - or is it insecurity?
the creeping fear for your own purity?
That&#8217;s one of many reasons why we are
superior, we women can cigar
up our own meaning for your comically
miniature tool and astronomically
upstage you- for we can create our own
tools, not rely on our frail flesh. 
A moan!
Ah yes, it&#8217;s finally arrived: the guest
of honor. Yes, crawl over here, you pest.
It&#8217;s awfully hard to move about when you
have ankles cuffed together and arms too,
so awkwardly locked in that leather sleeve
but you don&#8217;t mind, my pet, you can&#8217;t conceive
a world devoid of my attention paid,
so lonely, locked away inside my cage.

You see, Tanaka-san, the son adored
by you so long ago, he is no more.
This creature here is naught but needy whore,
a creature with no dignity, adored
no more, remorseless and pathetic. Look!
How cute, it&#8217;s seen the strapon, Gogo, look!
I think that that&#8217;s a little tear it dropped,
but is it joy or fear? And it&#8217;s propped
its ass up in the air; we taught it that
with beatings and abuse, denial, though,
denial taught it most, oh how we&#8217;d throw
it in the cage devoid of food or drink.
and we could hear its hopes begin to sink,
but now it craves mostly attention and
the closeness of a human being, a hand
to feel, be it a hug or it a slap,
accompanied even by anal chap.
That poor, lost child overcome with needs
is met by Gogo-san with grace and ease
She is insane. She cares for nothing but
her lust and sadist needs and has a slut.
I do not doubt that she&#8217;ll again draw blood
her lusting takes her over like a flood.
She pounds him so relentlessly, but he 
can&#8217;t help but love her. Never mind the screams,
that his the only noise it knows to make
although she sometimes lets its clit partake,
caressing it with sharpened fingernails-
but I won&#8217;t bore you with all the details.
So tell me of the honor you once had
and hoped to pass on to your strapping lad
Are you still glad you chose not to submit?
And if you want to take it, I&#8217;ll permit,
but only once my girl has had her share.
You take it&#8217;s body only if you dare,
but know I keep the soul. And don&#8217;t forget,
I keep the testes also as your debt.
