Ann Accident

Why had she waited so long, Anna wondered as she jogged down the hall, slowing to a fast walk when she saw other girls coming in and out of classrooms, trying to look normal. On any normal day she would have just gone when she needed to, before it became a problem&#8212; but today had been different. Leave it to Mr. Toba to show an interesting movie for once in his pathetic little life, she thought, cursing him as she passed the door to the vice principal&#8217;s office.
�Where are you off to in such a hurry, Anna?� The older woman asked, through the doorway. The vice principal was a large, faceless woman, with an impressive gait whose deep voice commanded a certain respect that wasn&#8217;t easy to shy away from.
�I uh� I&#8217;m just erm�� She stopped dead, pulled out of her thoughts by the sudden interjection. 
A healthy red glow spread across her face as she managed her footing. Besides the fact that she&#8217;d almost tripped and fallen, she realized at about the same time that she was intensely embarrassed by the fact. She couldn&#8217;t just say, �I have to pee.� It wasn&#8217;t right, nor was there enough time for explanations. The rumbling in her gut deepened and a few drops of piss splashed against the inside of her knickers, dampening them and running down her leg a little. She instantly squeezed her legs shut like a vice grip, staunching the flow.
It was just drops now, but soon she wouldn&#8217;t be able to hold it any longer. Paralyzed with the fear of peeing her pants, right there in the hallway, she dredged the depths of her brain searching for an excuse, any excuse. Anything would be better than standing here. But could she even move now? If she moved� Would she be able to hold it in or would she leave a slippery little trail from here to the ladies room. Anything, she thought, anything was better than that.
�The nurse,� She answered, keeping the muscles in her bikestrong thighs clenched as tightly as she could. But the damage had already been done and she could feel herself losing the race. Even as she said it, she felt a rivulet of piss, a drop squeezed from her meaty labia, as though she was an overripe orange, soak an echo into her plain grey panties and then trickle down the inside of her thigh.
�I f-feel a l-lil&#8217; sick,� she said, trying desperately to constrain the waver in her voice. She felt the drop on her leg cool and then slow as it hit the open air beneath her skirt and listened intently. 
The vice principal didn&#8217;t get up.
�Well don&#8217;t let me stop you, dear,� She said happily, as though to shoo her away. �I hope you feel better.�
Anna nodded and glanced around one last time. No one was there. Nobody saw it. She leaned down and wiped the drop away with her hand, brushing it off on her pleated blue skirt and then took off down the hallway with fast, deliberate steps that remained short enough for her to retain a little pressure on her bladder.
The hallway was long and each step she took was another little squirt. She was holding it back, but she&#8217;d have to change her panties after this, or she&#8217;d be wet the rest of the day. She reached the second floor bathroom just as the urge abated slightly and decided that she couldn&#8217;t risk going in there&#8212; not like this. If somebody in her class saw her&#8212; well, suffice to say, she wasn&#8217;t the most popular girl in class, but she didn&#8217;t really want to risk any further embarressment. If she had to, heaven forbid, wring out her skirt, or at the very least, change undies, she wanted to do it on her own terms&#8212; alone. She flew down the cement staircase and crashed through the stairwell portal just as her bladder finally let go and a steady stream of hot, tepid liquid crashed through the thin cotton barrier and splashed against the front inside of her skirt, dribbling down her legs.
She braced herself, held her breath and booked it down the hallway. The hall was empty. All the first years were half the school away doing jumping jacks in the gym.
Anna hit the door hard with her shoulder, and confident in her momentum, she pushed through it, into the bathroom.
As soon as she entered the bathroom proper, she heard a scream to her left and then another and another. There wasn&#8217;t time for her to really wonder why there were a bunch of first years pushing past her, just as she didn&#8217;t care to ask herself who the older girls were in the corner. All that was on the periphery. When you have to go that bad and then you lose it, right there in the hallway, before you can get yourself situated over a toilet, the rest of the world ceases to exist and all that matters is the fact that you&#8217;re peeing yourself and its getting all over that beautiful blue pleated skirt you washed just yesterday. Getting all over the same uniform you&#8217;ll be wearing two periods from now and to club activities after that.
The four first year girls, not a one over 14, that were huddled against the stall that was opposite of the door dropped what they were doing and scattered as soon as she came flying through the doorway. The little stainless steel thermos they were nursing was tossed backwards, tumbling over the top of the stall as two shrill voices within screeched and a pool of red liquid ran out from beneath the stall door. The girl at the sink who&#8217;d been diligently plucking her eyebrows in the mirror screeched too, no doubt nicking her skin as she recoiled in surprise. Meanwhile, the other girl, who looked no older than 16, had been pushed back by the torrent of first years as she tried to bar the door and they tried to flee. Needless to say, she was still reeling even as Anna stumbled past the both of them and, after fumbling with the first locked stall, booked it into the largest of the three and lifted her skirt in terror as she pissed straight through her scratchy cotton briefs and into the squat Japanese toilet below.
The relief washed over her almost as fast as she managed to piss it all out and before long, the flood slowed and sputtered, and then finally abated entirely.
The nightmare was over.
Anna, still squatting on her hindquarters, blinked and craned her neck, peering into the space between her legs. There were her undies, hanging heavy on her rump, soaked through and dripping into an expanding puddle of urine between her feet, along with her socks and white tennis shoes that splattered, but not completely saturated. While most of her skirt looked dry, the front of it had taken the brunt of the accident but what puzzled her most were the five pairs of legs that seemed to be standing a few feet behind her in the open stall door, unmoving.
She brought her head up slowly and deliberately, turning it in the direction of the door and peered at the girls huddled together at the entrance to the stall. She felt her face redden and then the tears came. She hadn&#8217;t closed the door. The girls that she&#8217;d run past coming in had just watched her� With tears coursing down her cheeks, she opened and closed her mouth, not really sure what to say. The movement was as mechanical as the tears and at first, the other girls just stared at her.
She read their name cards off all in a line: Akiko, Keiza, Chiai, Rina, and Koarin. The five were all quite distinct. They were all older too. Way too old to be first years. And she was sure that at least one of them was a sixth year. She had to be. Akiko was the tallest, oldest looking girl there, and this wasn&#8217;t just any ordinary sixth year. This was� She was beautiful. Her hair was combed into finely woven curtains of silky smooth� what? Crimson, maybe? Black cherry? There was a hint of color in her hair but it was hard to discern it at first. Like a sparkle you only catch on a second glance, but it was there, and it was as gorgeous as the rest of her. A strained expression of surprise was painted across her face, as though she&#8217;d just discovered that the cat that had wrecked her fine china was actually a magical beast, or some equally-trying miracle. It was hard to tell, because her uniform was already a rather dark shade of black, but Anna spotted several dark splotches that looked like fresh stains all across the front of her blouse, and the grey bow tied at her breastbone had taken on a deep, dark red color in places. Behind her was Keiza, a short girl with an athletic complexion and a boys haircut, who&#8217;s solemn expression made her look a lot older than her body appeared. Even through her tears, Anna&#8217;s mind was working overtime. She pegged the taller girl at 17 or 18 and the younger at 16 maybe? She looked like she was at least a third year, but probably older than that. Anna was first drawn to the telltale stains spattered here and there on her uniform too, and second to the redness that spanned both her cheeks and seemed to finally disappear into the top of her blouse. 
The remainder were three. Chiai, the tallest of the three, was an older fifth year with a supple little baby face, the sort of girl who they&#8217;d choose to play the innocent little girl in a television drama, or the cutie sucking on a lollipop as the killer stalked her on an opposite corner. There was a splash of bright sky blue under her uniform top and she had a jilted smile on her face. Part of it was confusion and the rest of it, unrestrained glee. Koarin&#8217;s acne-spotted face peered over Chiai&#8217;s shoulder, her eyes desperately trying to take the whole scene in as Anna just squatted there, looking pathetic. While her age was harder to judge due to her position in the pack, Anna&#8217;s mind labeled her a fourth year&#8212; at least 16. The last of the girls didn&#8217;t seem all that concerned about Anna&#8217;s plight. Instead, she stood behind Keiza and Akiko with a mirror in her hand, admiring her make-up job. And it was indeed a job. Anna registered that she was pretty, but she wasn&#8217;t pretty in the same way Koarin or Akiko was. Instead, she was pretty because she put in the time and effort to maker herself that way. Anna could tell that Rina, who also looked fourth or fifth year to her, had invested heavily in hair spray, body lotion, lipstick and eyeshadow. Her eyelids shimmered sea green underneath full, gorgeous eyelashes and her lips, even though they were, in reality, somewhat skinny and insubstantial, looked sexy, full, and ripe red.
�I tailed them all the way back to the science classrooms,� Koarin said, speaking up in soft, apprehensive tones. She didn&#8217;t sound afraid, but rather genuinely concerned, though whether she was concerned about the girls that had run off, or about Anna herself, that was unclear.
�Brownies are brownies. They aren&#8217;t going to tell anyone. We&#8217;ll just teach them not to scamper off at the first sign of danger before we let them at the carrot patch, is all,� Akiko said, her expression unchanging.
Chiai giggled a little at the rabbit metaphor as the other girls nodded. Anna stood up slowly, still sobbing as she nervously fingered the fringe of her skirt, not sure what she should do. They&#8217;d seen it. All of it. Every last drop and then some.
�I- I�&#8217;m sorry. I don&#8217;t� I don&#8217;t�� Anna searching for the words that wouldn&#8217;t come and whooping meanwhile.
Those were rocks in her mouth, sure, but they were by no means false. She hadn&#8217;t known. She hadn&#8217;t been in this bathroom in months&#8212; not since she herself had been a first year. And what had they been doing in here anyway? Brownies? Bunnies? And that sour, red stuff on Keiza and Akiko&#8217;s dress? Her mind was racing much too fast for her to consider what she had truly stumbled into, and as far as she was concerned, it didn&#8217;t matter anyway. Not with all they&#8217;d seen. If they told anyone&#8212; a single soul, even, she&#8217;d be ridiculed for years by her classmates, girls she was effectively stuck with for three or even four more years.
�Rina, you have a towel with you?� She asked, eyeing Anna&#8217;s nametag on the front of uniform. �Look&#8217;s like little Anna here has had an accident.�
Rina looked up from her mirror and her face twisted into an absurd mixture of horror and contempt. �My towel? You want to give this little pee-paddie my towel?�
Akiko turned back to Rina, and grinned. �Would you rather clean her up yourself? We can&#8217;t just leave her like this, you know.�
The other girls giggled at the thought, all except Keiza, whose cheeks turned a slight scarlet at the suggestion. 
Rina surrendered the towel without further ado.
Akiko handed it to Anna, who took it without saying anything, and dried her eyes out. Maybe they were friendly after all. Or even sympathetic to her plight.
Before she could really consider the idea, Akiko grabbed the towel and shook her head. �It&#8217;s not for your eyes, you bimbo. Try wiping off your bum, instead.�
She stepped up and pointed to the metallic pipe protruding from the bathroom tile floor and crossed her arms. �See that pipe? Look right there and bend over and flip your skirt up. A second year girl who can&#8217;t even clean her own bung off. I thought the brownies were dumb, but this takes the cake.�
Anna blinked and glanced down at the pipe. She didn&#8217;t need any help, did she? She reached out for answers where there weren&#8217;t any and eventually did as the older girl said, bending over so that her ass was in the air. Akiko waited, unmoving. She directed the girls with her other hand, still holding the towel and pointing at the toilet fixture.
�Ka-o-rin. Keiza. Grab her legs. Rina, take her panties and go wring them out in the sink. Chiai, you keep an eye out in the hall; we wouldn&#8217;t want anyone to see little Anna here all puckered up the way she is, now would we?�
Rina rolled her eyes and stuffed her mirror in her bag and then set the whole thing down on the side of the stall, shaking her head and mumbling something about just putting lotion on her hands. Anna felt a rush of cool air against her wet panties and the side of her skirt that was plastered to her leg lewdly as the girls moved in and in a second, she felt their hands, one pair warm and the other soft and cool, clasp her bike-made thighs up by her buttocks.
�Sei&#8212;no.�
They lifted her bottom half up, almost before she could catch herself on her hands, and she felt a tiny hand slither up into her nether-regions, peel away the sopping panties and then pull them down her outstretched legs, leaving her fourteen year old cunny exposed to the cold, toilet air. She felt vulnerable. She was naked under her skirt now and even though it was probably for the best, she wasn&#8217;t thinking of her skin, or the terrible chapping she used to get back when she was still in diapers, but rather, she started to wonder just what Akiko had in mind. It wasn&#8217;t the first time she&#8217;d been naked in front of people she didn&#8217;t know before. There were those health exams she&#8217;d taken every term as a first year, where the nurse had measured the length of the peach fuzz along her little peach blossom and taken a little rubbing from deep inside, but those times had felt cold and clinical. Here, instead of rubber gloves she could feel the probing hands and fingers of her senior schoolmates, and as strange as it felt, there was also a feeling of warmth that she couldn&#8217;t quite place deep down in the pit of her stomach.
The girls set her down and fixed her skirt up again as Akiko came around with the towel, both of them examining the damp, black hair all messed around the crook of her mound. Anna continued to stare at the pipe fixture. She couldn&#8217;t endure looking at them look at her like that and she wasn&#8217;t sure what Akiko would do if she did move. So she just kept her head down and her ass up, like a good little girl.
Keiza, on the other hand, couldn&#8217;t resist getting a little closer. She leaned in for a quick whiff as she set the other girl down. Did it smell like Aki&#8217;s did, she wondered? She fancied there was a tad bit of sweet amongst the sour and wondered. It was new&#8212; she couldn&#8217;t resist. Seeing this, Akiko just laughed and gave Keiza a bit of a shove, knocking her off balance and throwing her face into the other girl&#8217;s cunt. Keiza took in a deep breath as her lips came in contact with Anna&#8217;s tidbits and snapped up a quick, somewhat sour nibble on the her naughty bits, before she caught herself and reeled back into place next to Akiko.
�Bad Keiza,� Akiko chided as she brought the towel up between Anna&#8217;s legs and began to towel her off. �You&#8217;ll get your meat when I say so and not a moment sooner. I know you want it raw&#8212; sour even, but this is punishment hour, you know that.�
Keiza bowed her head low and kneeled down on the tile floor, prostrating herself as she slid the edge of her tongue along the outline of her fragile lips. Kaorin meanwhile turned to the sink Rina was hard at work on a bit of her make-up at and fanned herself with her hand as a blush creeped up the inside of her blouse towards her neck. Akiko worked on her for a minute or so, turning the towel over in her hands every once in a while until she was satisfied that Anna was well-clean. The air tickled her now-only-damp pubic fibers, and the strange feeling in her stomach, like there was a thick, hard rubber ball expanding deep down in her gullet continued to grow. Her anus puckered. Was the room getting warmer all of a sudden?
�We&#8217;re incorporating you into our little circle, Anna,� Akiko began, tossing the crumpled, pee-stained towel into the corner of the stall. �But it isn&#8217;t so bad, really. We&#8217;ll make sure nobody finds out about your little accident this morning, and besides, I think Keiza and and Kaorin here kind of like that anyway��
Anna kept her lower body, who&#8217;s center of gravity was still up in the air and on display, statue-still, but craned her neck so that she could peer under her legs and catch the shared look between the two girls mentioned. Keiza just maintained her straight face, glowing a deep red and Kaorin looked down, and then back to naked butt in front of her and then down again, continuing to fan herself without a word.
�Go ahead, stand up,� Akiko state flatly, as she stepped up next to Keiza and grinned.
Anna slowly picked herself up off her hands, and wiped the dust off on her dress. She wasn&#8217;t sure what to do next, but she did feel better dry. If it wasn&#8217;t for that nasty wet spot on the front of her dress, it would have been hard to tell she&#8217;d even peed herself.
�Joining is easy,� Akiko said, nodding to Keiza. �Show our little recruit the entrance exam.�
Keiza, still blushing, nodded and crawled up close to Akiko, such that her face was parallel with the other girl&#8217;s waist. Aki lifted the front of her skirt, revealing a thin cotton thong that tried hard to cover even the full length of her slit. Anna&#8217;s eyes got a little bigger, though she still wasn&#8217;t sure just what was going to happen next. Keiza swallowed and licked her lips. Bringing her hands around Akiko&#8217;s thighs from behind, she gave the girl&#8217;s ass a squeeze and then pulled the bit of fabric away, revealing a smooth, shaven slit soft, and completely devoid of stubble.
Anna swallowed as she watched Keiza stick her long tongue out and circle the extremities of Aki&#8217;s pubic mound, tracing a gentle circuit into the supple flesh around her labia. She did that once, twice and again, weaving patterns into it, going back and forth at the above and below; Akiko smiled and pushed a few stray locks of hair out of her face with the hand that wasn&#8217;t guiding Keiza&#8217;s ministrations. As Keiza worked her magic, Anna felt conflicted. She was retching in her mind but her tongue couldn&#8217;t help but protrude from her mouth a little, the way her cat did when it wanted milk. She hadn&#8217;t ever tried it&#8212; tasting her own quim, but she knew what she smelled like when she touched herself there, and sometimes, when she got home from school, especially after a particularly busy day of sports she&#8217;d take a quick whiff of her underpanties, just to you know, see how slimy-grimy she&#8217;d gotten on any given day. This was by far though, the most sexual display she&#8217;d ever witnessed, and far more enticing than the random stories that circulated about the boys who&#8217;d sneak in from time to time, only to be discovered by the head mistress and outed.
The display was gentle at first, as though Keiza&#8217;s tongue was being guided by the subtle breezes, but before long, Anna could see that Akiko was getting simultaneously getting both excited and agitated, and Keiza too, increased her efforts. What was at first silent quickly devolved into a lewd slurping chorus and soon, the hands that had been stoking Akiko&#8217;s back moved beneath the dress, too, aiding her oral efforts. Akiko&#8217;s blush began to radiate as the speed of her breathing increased, and Keiza moved to accompany that rhythm, giving her little anal starflower jabs in time as she worked to separate Akiko&#8217;s syrupy labia with her other hand. Anna watched as drops of saliva rolled down Aki&#8217;s thighs and Keiza&#8217;s chin, mingling with Aki&#8217;s own subtle stickiness as Keiza increased her efforts, lapping the other&#8217;s cunt like a dog would peanut butter.
�See,� Aki said, in between breaths, �There&#8217;s nothing to it. Now come on, Anna, take her place like a good little girl. Do it well enough and I might even let Keiza here finish you off.�
Anna blinked, her mind spinning. She couldn&#8217;t do it. Not here. No, not anywhere. She could tell that Akiko took good care of her all her girly parts, but it didn&#8217;t matter. Her mouth? There? Her fingers in there? No. Not at school. Not with a sixth year. She just couldn&#8217;t.
She shook her head and backed up, nearly slipping in the still remaining puddle of her own piddle. She couldn&#8217;t stop shaking her head no. No. Not here. Not you. Not my tongue there or my fingers there. Not any of it.
Akiko shook her head, and Keiza let up, taking a deep breath as she turned to face Anna, her face slightly red and her lipstick slightly smeared.
�Well, you&#8217;ll have to learn to do it some day, and until then, I&#8217;m going to have to punish you.�
Anna continued to back up, into the back of the stall. Surely there was a way out of here. Could she slide under the wall and make a break for it? She wasn&#8217;t sure where Chiai was, or what she was doing, but surely, if she could break through them pissing herself, she could find a way out proper.
Akiko, seemingly reading her mind, shook her head. �Don&#8217;t try it,� She warned, speaking too late and without any sort of promise to curtail the attempt.
Anna dived for the space under the divider, utilizing her size to squeeze through the opening and wriggle past the toilet there. Akiko shouted for Chiai to bar the door and then called for Keiza and Kaorin. As quick as Anna was, she wasn&#8217;t quick enough to cover the distance between the stall and the door on her belly in the midst of a group of girls who had free reign of the bathroom and as soon as she reached for the outer stall&#8217;s floor supports, two pairs of arms hauled her out from underneath the divider, while a third grabbed her legs and locked them together before she could try and do otherwise.
�Rina&#8212; socks. One for her wrists and the other for her ankles.� 
Anna struggled, trying to fight back against her aggressors as the pulled off her shoes and tossed them aside and then tugged the long length of her thick, knee-high socks off. She flailed for a minute at one point, but they hauled her back into the big stall regardless and soon enough they had her wrists bound together in thick, tight cotton. Akiko looped her cuffed hands around the toilet floor fixture so that she was face down as the other two girls worked on tying the sock tight around her ankles. Akiko went for her skirt next. She let the clip loose and then wrapped it around Anna&#8217;s knees, as tight as she could manage it and then tied it off in a rather kludgy knot. The other two girls meanwhile forced her legs into a bent position such that her knees were just slightly stuffed into the hollowed out alcove of the Japanese toilet, leaving her bare ass exposed to the air (and the door to the stall).
She began to cry.
�Not so quick now, are you?� Akiko asked her, shaking her head. �Rina, did you ever get around to washing this little cunt&#8217;s soggy pants out?�
She pointed to the sink and shook her head. �No. They stink.�
Akiko strode over to the sink and wrung them out once more, giving them a little sniff and nodding. �Yeesh. These do stink. You&#8217;re filthy, you know that?�
Anna, sobbing now, just shook her head in protest. �N&#8212;o� No�N-n-n��
Without a second thought, Akiko wadded them up and with a look of bitterness, she squatted and using two fingers, stuffed them into Anna&#8217;s mouth.
This, of course, brought forth a new struggle and a fit of coughing and gagging, as the piss-stench filled Anna&#8217;s mouth and traveled up into her nose, leaving her with a sour, despicable reminder of the bad luck that had brought her down here in the first place. But eventually, Akiko succeeded in prying her teeth open and forcing the girl&#8217;s own dirty panties down into her mouth.
�Rina, the sticky medical tape, two strips.�
Rina got it.
With that done, Akiko stood up and shook her head, admiring their handiwork. �There. Is that better than this?� She asked, raising her skirt and pointing to the crotch of the thong, still skewed to the left. �Next time consider just doing it without question so that I don&#8217;t have to tie you up to the toilet like a pig to teach you a lesson.�
�Chiai!� She yelled, over the tops of the stalls.
Anna tried to fight against her fitted cocoon, but found it all but impossible to get any sort of leverage anywhere. And it was enough just to breath, really. Gagged like this, her body was working overtime, breathing through her nose at double-speed.
Chiai wandered into the stall and squealed. �What a cute little flower-butt,� she said, grinning gleefully. �Anybody have any lipstick?�
Rina rolled her eyes and rooted around in her bag. She pulled out a little tube of lipstick and handed it to the other girl, shaking her head. �You know you&#8217;re buying me a new tube later, right?�
Ignoring her, Chiai took to the canvas in front of her, kneeling and coloring in a big, oily blossom right in the center of the other girl&#8217;s ass, staining Anna&#8217;s puckered little starfish a deep, lurid shade of red. She followed that with a tight spiral that eventually blossomed into a series of concentric patterns. Next, she used the lipstick to draw petals at the edges of the other girl&#8217;s ass, and finally a stem right down her crack until she couldn&#8217;t get any deeper. A few greasy leaves later, her masterwork was finished. 
She stood up and handed the lipstick back to Rina, who bent down quick and businesslike and added her own little doodle, a smeared arrow disappearing into the crack between Anna&#8217;s legs, labeled �eat me.�
In the hallway, the chimes started, signaling the end of the period.
�What&#8217;s more embarrassing, Anna, peeing yourself or giving every little first year who comes through this bathroom a good, long look at your greasy little asshole?�

As the others gathered their things, Akiko leaned down and whispered: �Don&#8217;t even think for a second that I don&#8217;t expect an answer, Fukauchi. I&#8217;ll be waiting.�
Anna picked up her struggling a little as the other girls filtered out of the bathroom, leaving her alone again as the sounds of distant footsteps poured into the hallway.
A drop of sweat rolled down her forehead and then stung her eyes as Rina&#8217;s lipstick started to run.
