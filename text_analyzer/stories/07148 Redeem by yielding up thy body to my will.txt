Synopsis: The title is from Measure from Measure. The tale is from the annals of the future; of a little boy sold to a cruel, unyielding mistress and his experience thereafter






Alex was already thirteen when he was sold, which would prove to be both a curse and a blessing. He had a charmed childhood up to this point, but that made what was to follow even more difficult, if possible.
He had grown up sheltered by a loving mother. She had successfully protected him from the difficulties and rigors of the modern world by keeping him in the house at all times and limiting her friends&#8217; contacts with him. She was rich, a top-level government agent when he was young, and it was her love and sheltering that caused all the misfortune to follow.
Ever since a combination of technology and legality made it the woman&#8217;s right and responsibility to decide the gender of her child and made semen a hopelessly antiquated impregnation technique, the proportion of women to men had slowly skewed toward the fairer sex. It began slowly, but after a few generations, it became clear that men would only be born for of vengeful lust or selfish greed. As men&#8217;s rights eroded and women consolidated all positions of importance in government and business, boys became almost exclusively sex objects and maids. In an attempt to slow black-market slave trafficking and concentrate men in the hands of the elite, the Helsinki Convention ruled that only women of wealth and prominence would be allowed to birth boys, and even then only with diluted Y chromosomes, ending all possibility of a male resurgence in the population.
Alex, however, was a special case. Rather than using or selling him, his mother took good care of him: feeding him well, educating him, giving him a relatively light work schedule, and never allowing other women to be alone with him. Despite having every advantage, however, Alex was a late bloomer and rather short. It was clear from a young age that he would never grow taller than five foot, although he was still just four foot three. It was unclear as to when puberty would begin, for he still had undersized genitals and was without a single hair. No matter how much he ate, it seemed that he could never gain weight, and his ribs showed through under his thin, almost translucently pale skin.
It was his mother&#8217;s protection that had ruined them both. The Party took a very clear line on the issue of proper male treatment, and his being coddled was not looked upon favorably. It took only a single malevolent report from a friend to kick Alex&#8217;s mother from the Party. Without an income she managed to keep him for another few months, but inevitably was forced to sell poor Alex.
She was contacted by an old friend, Jade, who had a daughter who once come over to play when they were very little. Her daughter, Jasmine, would soon be turning sixteen, and being a good, affluent mother, she was in the market for a new slaveboy. Alex&#8217;s mother, with many assurances that he would be treated kindly and safely, sold Alex over to a brand new life, and tearfully said goodbye. As previously mentioned, Alex&#8217;s advanced age upon being sold both spared him the horrors of the average male childhood, but also assured a rude awakening upon entering the real world. He was still a virgin in every sense and would quickly learn the perils of the modern world.
Jade was an upper-level Party member had had more girlfriends than periods. She enjoyed the thrill of new conquests, the chase, capture and training, but never had access to a boy before. She was a proud black woman who stood six foot three with toned but not budging muscles and an ample 38 DD chest. She went exclusively for those smaller than herself in every measurement and loved more than anything the pleading look in a lover&#8217;s eye as she tried to withstand her extensive dildo collection. She approached with world with a significantly different philosophy than Alex&#8217;s mother, who wanted all the best and kindest out of everyone, instead desiring all that would gratify and advance her and her family at the expense of anyone unlucky enough to cross her path. She was ruthless and had as little respect for love as she did for the rights of boys.
When Alex first arrived at her mansion and set his suitcase down on the paneled marble floor of her entryway, Jade entered the loft overlooking him, and called down, �What&#8217;s your name, boy?�
�Um� Alex?� he offered timidly. Upon first seeing Jade, Alex was struck with a combination of awe and terror. He had never seen a woman so beautiful or imposing.
�Alex. Good. Your mother named you neither exclusively male nor female. That shows an open-mindedness that I pray she passed to you.�
Alex said nothing, but looked down at his newly-polished shoes. Jade descended the marble staircase that grew from the foyer slowly, deliberately, taking in the boy&#8217;s diminutive figure. She had her bangs pulled back up and over her head, sloping down on the sides in tight curls, giving the impression of being even taller, with a high, regal forehead. When her five-inch black heels clicked on the entry hall&#8217;s floor, Alex gulped in fear.
�I understand that you are untrained completely?� she demanded coldly.
�Uh-huh� he mumbled.
She slapped him hard across the face with her long, ring laden fingers immediately bringing tears to his eyes. �That is not how you address your Queen.�
�Sorry, ma&#8217;am. I didn&#8217;t mean to�� he stumbled, panicked.
�You will call me Madam and my daughter Princess. Do you understand?�
�Yes. Yes Madam.�
�Good. Good. Come with me.�
He picked up his bag and now found himself staring directly at her voluptuous, rounded ass, silhouetted rather than disguised by her long, tight white dress. He could even make out the impossibly thin, lavender g-string that ran up between her legs. 
She looked bemusedly back over her shoulder. This boy would be fun.
�Here is where you will live and sleep unless my daughter or I command you otherwise,� she said, indicating a large pillow on the floor at the end of the kitchen island. Coming from the cabinetry were five small chains with little collars at the end of each one, attached with carabineers to eye screws drilled into the paneled oak. �The leashes are here not because I&#8217;m afraid you will run away (no one would be stupid enough for that), but just to have that little more control over you. Don&#8217;t worry, you&#8217;ll get used to it soon. Now, let me see that suitcase of yours.�
Alex nodded and handed it over.
�Right, you won&#8217;t be needing anything of your own, so we&#8217;ll just throw this out. Anyway, we have a wardrobe picked out for you, so if you wouldn&#8217;t mind disrobing��
Alex looked up at his with his doleful eyes.
�Yes,� she said, �right now. In the kitchen.�
He nodded. He had been wearing his nicest suit, which he now took off slowly piece by piece.
�Yes. The underwear too. Trust me.�
He took off the last of his clothes and handed them too her. She stooped down to look at him more closely. She ran her long, vicious fingers over every inch of his exposed frame, stopping especially long to explore the crevices of his butt (as he involuntarily leaped and tensed in response). �Completely hairless, I see. I like that.� Shame creeped over him.
He couldn&#8217;t help his eyes from being drawn slowly up her dress and she shifted around, barely catching glances at her glistening crevice, spreading wide and wet beneath its thin lavender dressing.
She slapped his face just as hard as before, sending him reeling to catch his balance. �Do not eye me like a piece of meat. That is your job. And besides, you will get enough of that later. Now, come upstairs with me.�
Alex felt even more naked as he followed his mistress around the house, with its high, grand windows that let as much light in as they let image out. He still had his vestiges of modesty.
They arrived at her bedroom. Every piece of furniture was oversized and ornate, from the sled-shaped king bed to the plush loveseat. The walls were covered with a gold-flaked design that would have pleased a pre-revolutionary French king. �Now,� Jade began, �there are many things in this room for the two of us to &#8216;play&#8217; with. Does anything jump out at you?�
Alex eyed the room more suspiciously now. There- at the side of the bed, �What is that thing�? It looks like a toilet?�
�Very good, you little shit, very well done. Now, go sit where you think you should.�
He went over and sat on the toilet. Jade kneeled down and caressed his head. �That&#8217;s where you think you should be?� He nodded. With her soft, caressing hand, she smacked the back of his head hard enough to send him flying forward, onto her shoulder. �That&#8217;s wrong, dear.�
She opened up a panel on the front of the toilet. She said, �Look in here. Do you see how my toilet has no plumbing? Well, what do you think we&#8217;re going to do about that?�
�Get a plumber to look at it?�
She laughed cruelly. �Okay. I know you&#8217;re new, but no one&#8217;s that stupid. Lay on your back.� He flipped over and quickly found an elegantly high heeled black foot between his legs. She smiled as she slowly scooted her leg up towards his crotch. As soon as the two first made contact, he finally understood and began scooting himself backwards and upwards until his head slid into a strap-holster. �Very good,� she said, tapping his balls just hard enough to make them twinge, but not ache. �All of my machines are brand-new, so I&#8217;d like to calibrate them before Jasmine gets home. So, let&#8217;s see.�
Accompanied by the wheezing mechanical sound of the chair springing to life, the straps surrounding Alex&#8217;s head began to tighten until they formed a comfortable but impossibly strong helmet. Although he tried his hardest to look left and right, he was stuck facing whichever direction it wanted him to, namely, up.
�Here we go,� Jade said, hiking up her dress as she mounted the seat. She let her dress fall, plunging Alex into a world of shade and shifting substance. He was immediately assaulted by his mistress&#8217; smells, built up from the excitements of day so far. He could also see, although barely, the slight lavender strip running tight from the back of her down along the asshole before widening to cover the rest of her. He again swallowed nervously.
�Alright. Come here.� The mechanical sound began again and he felt his head elevating and pulling his head backwards, so that his throat was quickly strained. He had to prop himself up on his elbows just to keep his throat open. Jade smiled coyly as she felt his tiny nose bump against her mostly-exposed asshole. Everything about this boy as so delicate; she was excited by the cuteness and the possibility of it all.
She shifted her weight forward, bringing the lavender silky spread to bear across his mouth and chin. �Perfect. Now, let me acquaint you to two of your most important jobs. Open your mouth.� He complied, and she pulled the delicate g-string away from herself, pressing he lips gently but firmly along his. �Swallow as quickly as you can. You will be punished for every mistake you make.�
Alex was inundated with smells and surfaces that he had never experienced before, his nose burrowed slightly into her asshole, and his mouth pressed against her pussy. He could feel a strange tingling come over him, almost a sense of belonging, until the stream began. Knowing that this would be his first attempt, Jade only loosed a portion of her bladder into Alex&#8217;s helpless mouth. Alex swallowed quickly, but with his head pulled back so far, he quickly began to cough, sending urine rolling down his chest and his nose deeper into Jade.
She jumped up and stared down at his unhappy face peeking up from its cage. �I can&#8217;t believe your ineptitude. I was going to acquaint you with your other job, but it seems that that will have to wait.� She hit the quick release on the chair, sending Alex&#8217;s choking, coughing head plummeting hard to the carpeted floor. For his part, all the coughing seemed to do was lodge Jade&#8217;s urine farther into his nose, increasing the pain.
Jade snatched him by the feet and ripped him from the contraption. �Come here, pigboy,� she growled, and picked him up by the midsection. Still coughing, Alex could not resist being sidled into a set of miniature stockades at the foot of the enormous, sled-shaped bed. Jade forced his head down into the black plastic neck-hole, and then took each of his writs and installed them before pulling the top section down. �These were used in the middle ages for humiliation. You will have an easier time in them to be assured, but not, perhaps, a more comfortable one.� This version of the trap also had a stockade for the midsection, which she now closed and locked. The two pieces had eye screws just like the kitchen leashes, ostensibly to attach to hydraulically-controlled chains in the ceiling. �You spilled almost all of your drink, so I&#8217;m afraid that I am forced to make things very uncomfortable for you. But never fear, for if you learn this lesson, others will be learnt more naturally.�
She left his field of vision and circled around behind him. He heard her spit and felt a warm trickle down his tailbone, and flinched from his anus to his neck. �Now you get it,� she growled. He then felt her finger, well lubricated with spit, press firmly against his protesting rear aperture. �Come on,� she whispered, adding more pressure, but Alex stubbornly held firm. �Now, just listen, boy. If you relax and simply let me have my way, soon you will find that this whole process progresses more quickly and easily. If, however, you resist, you will find it far more painful and intense than you can imagine. Now, what will it be?�
Alex tried to relax, but whenever her finger reaproached him, he flinched involuntarily, preventing her. �Fine,� she said, �we&#8217;ll do it the hard way.� She got up and opened her dresser. Alex could only hear the ominous rolling around of untold objects coming from behind him. She returned with a jar of thick, ropey lubricant. �Now, this is going to do the trick. If you continue to resist, you will feel unnecessary pain. I want to punish you, but there is no reason for this to be difficult.� Again, as she spread the lubricant on him, he couldn&#8217;t help but flinch, squeezing himself closed tightly.
Finally, she made a quick, jabbing approach, and quickly broke his defense and slid in all the way to her second knuckle. With a wide smirk, she remarked, �No, perhaps you were right. Feeling you break was more fun that I thought it could be.�
Alex did not scream, but gasped, catching the breath in his throat. What he felt was not pain in the sense that he had known it before, but a deeper confusion and fear, and a slight anger at being violated and losing control of his own body. As if on cue, Jade added, �It&#8217;s almost cute when you try and resist me. Almost.� He was instantly overcome with a desire, above all else,&nbsp; to rid himself of this unwanted invader, but found that the muscles he used for that sort of thing were completely useless against her strong pressure.
Her voice now came much closer; he could feel a moisture at his ear and a warmth at his neck. �How does it feel to have me inside you? &#8211;bitch!� The word sent a shiver down him, furthering his degradation. �And stop fucking trying to push me out.� Her voice never raised, but stayed an even, level, terrifying whisper. He tried to stop himself, but was already consumed with a desire to free himself bordering on panic. �Stop,� she said again, this time pushing on his prostate. It was only now that he became aware of his erection, which suddenly felt like it would explode with the extra push of blood from the prostate. He could not see himself, but was sure that it was the hardest he had ever been.
All of this, which had seemed to progress in a strange, terrifying, dream-like state, was suddenly broken with a �Hello!� echoing from downstairs. That seemed to break Jade&#8217;s hold, and sent her finger rocketing outwards with equal speed and ferocity. Alex felt suddenly, horribly empty, and while he was glad to be free, was experiencing a different sort of pain entirely.
�Come on up, Jasmine,� she yelled back, walking to the bathroom to wash her hands. �Your birthday gift has arrived.�
�Oh, hurray,� the voice responded with child-like glee, and Alex listened to feet skipping up the stairs one by one.

Part 2: Jasmine
While Alex had managed to remain fairly calm up till this point, trapped as he was and being treated like he never had before, he could not prevent the slow wash of panic come over him as he listened to the heels clicking up the steps just outside the door. It started in his lower abdomen, a place that hurt anyway, but deeper, like a clenching muscle that he could not control. It washed up his spine and down his legs, making them tingle with suspense and a choking, screaming desire to escape and run far far away, back to yesterday, when everything still seemed like it could work out fine. He felt the panic rising in his throat like vomit, and the heels clicked to a stop just outside the door.
�Mom?�
Jade, standing in the bathroom, called out, �Come on in.�
Jasmine pushed open the door slowly, allowing Alex to see her only piece by piece as she entered the room. She looked shockingly like her mother, but smaller and tighter. Her whole body: breasts, stomach, arms, legs, were all compact and tight, toned and sheened. She wore a pink spaghetti-strap and a short, white, poofy skirt with many folds that drew the eye down along her amble hips, then lost it among its many, changing, dark crevices. She wore her hair short and straight, layering it in jet-black mats.
�Well, what do you think?� asked Jade.
Alex was in awe.
Jasmine answered, �You know who he looks like?�
Jade: �I didn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d remember.�
�Is he?�
�Yes. I just bought him off his mother.�
Jasmine wrinkled her brow. �Oh.�
Jade left the bathroom and switched off the light. �Is there something wrong?�
Jasmine immediately became aware of her face, and contorted it into a smile. �No. Of course not. Thank you so much, mom!� She quickly crossed the room and hugged her mom, somewhere behind Alex, who was sinking into greater despair, not only trapped and incapacitated, but being talked about like he couldn&#8217;t hear or speak himself.
After a moment, Jade asked, �Well?�
�Would you mind if I took him to my room?�
�Of course. Of course. Here.� Jade unlocked Alex from her trap and clasped a leather leash around his neck from her dresser. The three walked across the hall, the two women first and Alex following, affording him another impressive view. �Look at this� Jade said, pointing to an apparently new fixture in her daughter&#8217;s room: a pentagon of leashes on eye-hooks, just like in the kitchen. �Let me help,� she exclaimed, dragging Alex to the leashes and tightening on to his limbs. �There we go! How exciting!� She stood still, clasping her hands and staring intently at Jasmine.
�Yes, mother?� she asked.
�Well?�
�Thank you.� Then after a moment: �Would you like go so I can get started.�
Jade smiled cruelly and said. �Very well.� She slowly loped out, letting the door slowly shut behind her.
Alex stood on hands and knees in the corner, leashed up completely, shivering slightly. He looked up at Jasmine with his poor, begging eyes. She looked just like her mother, only, somehow more real. She had a sharper quality, although her mother had more defined features, like she could be a bit kinder, but always a bit harsher. Like she was more friendly, but far more cruel. She walked close enough that he could barely catch a glimpse of underwear under her pink skirt as he looked up.
�Alex?� she said quietly.
�Yes,� he choked. The neck leash seemed unnecessarily tight.
�I remember you when we were young. You seemed like my closest friend and I have many fond memories of you. I state this because I can not bring myself to hurt you in any way. Of course, I cannot protect you from my mother, but I will not harm you. You can trust me if I can trust you.�
Alex jumped to respond, �You can trust me. Whatever you want.�
Jasmine nodded. �I want you to take care of whatever you call that silly thing between your legs.�
Alex looked down and found something looking back up. �Oh no! What do I do?�
Jasmine sighed and said, �I don&#8217;t know, but if you want us to be friends, you will need to control yourself. If I ever see one of those again, we will not be friends anymore.�
Alex nodded passively.
�Good. But we need to kill some time before my mom can be satisfied, so let me look you over.�
For the second time, Alex was closely and uncomfortably inspected. She ran her hands over him, across his face, down his back, up his legs, between his thighs, down his chest, around his balls, back, between, up, up, in, around. When she stood back up, they both were panting, and Alex&#8217;s erection had definitely not subsided. �Interesting,� she said with a giggle, and jumped on her bed. She crossed her legs and laid back to relax, and Alex fell panting and sweating to the ground, shaking with confusion, fright and frustration.

* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*

That night, naked and cold after a dinner of scraps under the table, Alex awoke to the sound of two people stumbling through a door. Earlier, Jade had told him she would be back a little while later as she leashed him tight to the kitchen hooks. Now she had returned.
Alex propped himself up on one arm groggily and tried to peer into the darkness. Jade approached, swaying, with her guest behind her, another black woman but slightly shorter and girthier.
�Is this your boy?� the other woman asked loudly.
Jade spun around and shushed her softly. �You&#8217;ll wake up my daughter. She has school tomorrow. But we can make all the noise we want in my room. It&#8217;s soundproof.� She said the last part with the most seductive smile she could muster.
She stumbled up to Alex and started unhooking the leashes as best she could. As this went on, he tried to discern the new woman&#8217;s features, but she stood outside the slit of moonlight coming through the bay windows, and all he could see was her small eyes in the darkness, staring at him intently, emotionlessly.
�Come on,� Jade said, grabbing his neck-leash and tugging. He tried to follow, but found that his leg was still connected to the wall, and before he could warn her, Jade tugged on his leash again, sending him choking to the floor, which he hit with a loud crack that reverberated around the quiet house. Alex whimpered. The companion giggled.
Jade spun around and, after taking a moment to understand the situation, unhooked Alex&#8217;s other leg. �Now be quiet and come upstairs.�
Once in the room, Jade closed and dead bolted the heavy wooden door. In the silence of the house, Alex could hear the whooshing of air as it closed and the heaviness of the lock. Something about the physical barrier made the light claustrophobia he had dealt with all day seem suddenly more present. He was trapped.
Jade giggled uncharacteristically as she approached her new friend in the warm lamplight of the room. As they fell back onto the bed together, Alex caught another glimpse of the companion&#8217;s eye fixed coolly on him. He shuddered slightly. He could sense something new. Before he had felt small, trapped and confused in his new role, but now there was a feeling of recklessness. He could smell a passion and excitement that wasn&#8217;t there before, and also a danger that his helplessness engendered. Furthermore, he felt slightly ashamed standing there, leashed and naked, watching the two women explore each other on the bed. He was uninvolved, and yet completely naked and unattended. He was neither party nor separate, not free to join or leave, just waiting.
The two continued for a while, each using her mouth in generous and intrepid ways. This was what Jade lived for: the drunken escapades of new women. She used her ample lips to suck, caress, even lightly nibble her partner, hungry for more flesh to explore. She may have continued like this for much longer, but her new one asked lightly, �What about the boy?�
What about the boy.
�Come here,� Jade beckoned.
Alex shuffled forward, leashes audibly dragging across the carpet as he approached. He reached the foot of the bed and looked up.
�Take off Serenity&#8217;s shoe.�
Alex obeyed.
�And her sock.�
Alex obeyed.
�And lick her foot.�
Alex looked up, confused, not from the request, but how to begin. He looked first to Jade, who stared blankly, then to Serenity, who hesitated for a moment, then smiled impishly and jammed her big toe into Alex&#8217;s slightly agape mouth. Alex reeled backwards in surprise, but her other foot was already around the back of his head, pushing him forward. He moaned through his filled mouth in pain and surprise, but that only encouraged her to force more into him. After some more pushing, she relented, letting him pull back just until only her big toe remained. He looked to Jade with desperate eyes, hoping for intervention, trying to pull back the last bit, but she laughed and squealed, �Do it again!�
Alex&#8217;s eyes widened again in fear. This was unexplored, dangerous territory. Serenity was more than happy to again push his head forward with her other foot, which seemed too strong and commanding for Alex to resist, stretching his mouth to its breaking point. The sides of his mouth hurt as if they would rip and his jaw ached, but still she pushed. Alex didn&#8217;t know what to do, so he jammed his tongue in between and around her toes, hoping to sate her. This seemed to work, as the pressure on his head seemed to lighten.
Jade got off the bed, and left Alex&#8217;s limited field of vision. He heard a drawer open, sending hefty objects rolling around, the scraping of things being moved, and then the door shut. There was a moment before Jade approached, coming around the bed and to his side. �I&#8217;m sorry, Serenity,� she whispered, �but there&#8217;s something I want to do.� She dislodged Alex&#8217;s head from the feet and quickly popped something new into his mouth. He was filled with a completely unfamiliar taste. It had the pungency of body odor, but was slightly different. He couldn&#8217;t place it, nor the object in his mouth, but knew that he didn&#8217;t like where this was going.
Jade mounted the bed, allowing Alex to see that she was now in her bra and without underwear, and walked on her knees to Serenity, who was still laying back. She worked her hand slowly between her legs, hovering upwards lightly, gently, under the cotton skirt, up the plump thighs, until she gave a slight start. Jade smiled and worked her hand around the dark crevices that Alex couldn&#8217;t make out in the low light. Serenity laid back and moaned lightly. After a little while Jade produced something that had been behind her and out of Alex&#8217;s sight: a substantially sized black vibrating dildo. She shifted it to her right hand as she laid down with her lover, slowly working it up and in, inciting and responding to the symphony of moans and grunts.
After a moment, Serenity came to again, and asked, �what about the boy?�
Jade looked at her. �What about him?�
�Have you tried him out yet?�
Jade smiled softly, a smile of rising excitement and possibility. �I haven&#8217;t. Come here Alex.�
Alex climbed wide-eyed onto the bed, crawling on his hands and knees towards the waiting ladies.
�Oh wait,� Jade whispered apologetically, �he&#8217;s a virgin. We&#8217;ll need something smaller.�
This brought a new life to Serenity&#8217;s eyes. �He isn&#8217;t? He is? We don&#8217;t need anything smaller. I&#8217;m sure we can make this work.� Her voice was deep with lust.
Jade smiled apologetically, �No, I really do. You have no idea how tight this boy is.�
Alex may have wanted to express an opinion, but, of course, his mouth was occupied.
Jade returned to her drawer, and shuffled objects around noisily as Serenity eyed Alex up and down, causing him to slump slightly. �Yes, this should do,� Jade said, displaying a dildo easily twice the size of Alex&#8217;s meager tool. She then produced a harness, which she began tightening into place.
�Oh, Jade, darling. Let me do it, please. Please. I&#8217;ve always wanted-�
�I&#8217;m sorry, but you have no idea how much he cost me. In fact, I was going to save him at least until tomorrow, but, what the hell; the night is too young and beautiful to waste.�
Serenity pouted lightly, but then resolved, �Well then at least fuck me first so that I&#8217;ll be inside him too.�
Jade giggled. Alex felt the rising terror of earlier return. This seemed reckless and unfair, and he was so helpless. At least he could believe earlier that he was part of some sort of plan. This drunken change terrified him.
Serenity shuffled to the edge of the bed, and Jade, standing, entered her slowly. Serenity said, �You must be joking. That little thing?�
Jade shook her head. �Trust me.�
After a few minutes of unsatisfying motion, Jade dislodged, and turned her dripping extension to Alex. �Ready,� she asked with a wink. Alex cringed.
�Hands and knees, boy,� she whispered in her voice that seemed especially for him. Serenity grabbed his neck leash and pulled him down. Then she reached into his mouth and pulled out the gag, which he could see for a moment to be a slight lavender string. Jade&#8217;s g-string.
He shouted, panicked. �Wait. Please don&#8217;t. I&#8217;m not ready,� but Jade only giggled.
�Okay. Here we go.�
He felt a warm, wet presence at his tailbone slide down, down, and stop at his venerable spot. �Don&#8217;t,� he began again, but Serenity jammed a thumb into his mouth, making it come out, �Gon.� Jade shushed him in an almost motherly tone as she applied pressure. Alex clench involuntarily, but as Jade thrust back and forth gently, he found himself involuntarily weakening, until he finally broke. He heard Jade whisper, �I&#8217;m in,� and Serenity immediately began to touch herself. She watched Alex&#8217;s eyes, unflinchingly staring. 
He moaned gutturally as she began to ease forward. �That&#8217;s too much,� he whispered.
�Too much? I&#8217;m barely in. Just relax and let it happen and things will be much easier for you.� Then she added flippantly, �or don&#8217;t.�
He was hit first by the uncontrollable urge to defecate, but as that became clearly impossible, he noticed different sensations. He could feel his asshole alternatively tightening and loosening as he fought the urge to clench. He could feel an enormous pressure on his prostate, which translated to a throbbing through his erection. He could feel every slight gradation of pressure as Jade pushed onwards, until she came to the end, and he could feel an almost reassuring flatness and warmth of her body against his. �Now that wasn&#8217;t too bad.�
Alex already felt spent, sweating and shaking in his arms and legs. Jade said, �Now comes the fun part.� He lifted his head laboriously, and caught Serenity&#8217;s crazy stare. Jade placed a strong had on each side of his hips and pushed him forward lightly as she pulled out. This felt even worse for him, because he would do nothing to prevent his body from clenching, but Jade either didn&#8217;t notice or didn&#8217;t care, because she just kept pulling. When what felt like a foot of dildo had left him, she pushed back in.
Now he couldn&#8217;t decide which was worse, going in or coming out, because each always seemed harder than the last. He was grunting and panting, and fell on his face as his arms buckled. He heard a voice in what seemed like a faraway place say, �God Jade, look at you. You&#8217;re glowing. You look so strong, so powerful back there.�
Serenity lifted Alex&#8217;s head by the hair, grabbed his collar, and pulled him directly onto her glistening sex. �Lick,� she said authoritatively. �Lick me.� Alex could hardly hear or understand her, but tried to obey whenever he could focus enough to. Jade was in another place entirely. She couldn&#8217;t remember the number of women she had fucked with strap-ons far larger than this, but she could not remember having so much fun. Something in the combination of his milky skin, his tiny body, his gender and knowing that she was betraying an old friend all combined to be enough of a turn-on that even with the minimal pressure against her clit she found herself on the verge of climaxing. Alex, meanwhile, found his gasps for air further stifled by the new placement of his face. He was in a sickening combination of severe pain, oxygen deprivation and a hidden pleasure he could not place. He felt used up completely: spent. The two women moaned in time, taking turns forming the melody and harmony of their sadistic symphony, crescendoing&nbsp; to competing climaxes and working down slowly, gently, to a soft afterglow. Jade pulled out uneventfully, undid the harness and commanded, �sleep in the corner, slave,� before falling into the arms of her new lover. Alex left the bed slowly, shaking, and crawled across the floor before curling up on the soft carpet. He could hardly say where his mind was: lost in the swirl of competing sensation.
