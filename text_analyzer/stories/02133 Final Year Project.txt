Synopsis: A fashion student designs an innovative bondage outfit, which converts from zero to total bondage with everything in between.Final Year Project 
Per &amp; Dorothy (Dor) are final year students living in London, Per is Swedish
  finishing a degree in Media &amp; Communications (which gives him a lot of
  free time) and Dor is finishing a degree in Fashion. Dor is a full time Goth
  and dresses in Goth fashion at all times. Per has been working at a club for
  the last two years which twice a month holds a Bondage / Fetish night. &nbsp;As
  Per can get her in for free Dor went along for a look and soon found that she
  was into the bondage scene. As students they were permanently short of money
  and so they could not afford any serious fetish gear, and Dor had had to improvise
  what little she had, which was basically leather wrist and ankle cuffs, joined
  by dog chain and a leather bondage collar. All these she had made herself but
  she longed for something more cutting edge. 

One night she was surfing the net and drooling over some of the designs she
  found, 

�Have you seen this hobble dress at Demask , its absolutely wonderful ! � 

Per came over and signalled his approval, 

�Yeah, it's just right, but have you seen the price? &nbsp;We are broke already
  and what little we have is going to blown away when we have to pay for that
  corset from C &nbsp;&amp; S.� 

�Hey, don't just blame we, you were all in favour of it as well.� 

Dor had been wearing corsets on and off for the past two years and was down
  to a 24� waist from her natural 28�. &nbsp;She firmly believed that as a Goth,
  a corset was an essential garment. &nbsp;Per also thought she looked fantastic
  in a tight laced corset and for her birthday they had ordered a 20� one from
  C &amp; S. Dor had thought this might be a bit to tight for her 38� bust and
  40� hips, but the thought of a proper corset (and the cost) had spurred her
  on from her initial thoughts of a 22� waist. 

�But look, it's so lovely, can't we manage it somehow?� 

�No way, the only way you are going to be wearing anything like that is if
  you make it yourself.� 

Being a fashion student, Dor had made most of her clothes and really only
  purchased underwear and footwear. 

�You know I haven't got time for anything like that. &nbsp;I am snowed under
  and I still haven't found anything to do for my final project.� 

Per was quite for a moment, and then replied, 

�Well you could kill three birds with one stone, design yourself a killer
  bondage outfit, use it as your project and get the college to pay for it.� 

Per was referring to the fact that the college would give her &pound;200 for
  materials on her final project. 

Dor could see that he was joking and they left it at that. 

The next day at college Dor started thinking again about what Per had said. &nbsp;She
  and the rest of the course were all striving for a radical project, something
  that would get them noticed, something different. Later that day she went to
  see Mrs Franklin her project tutor and discussed Per's idea with her. 

Back at their flat, she told Per, 

�OK, your amazing idea has been accepted, with some reservations.� 

He gave her a questioning look, 

�What idea?� 

�Your three birds with one stone, the bondage outfit. &nbsp;I saw Mrs Franklin
  today and she approved it in principle, but we have to overcome two things.� 

�What are they?� 

�One, the finished outfit has got to be practical in some form, on a day to
  day basis, which seems to me to defeat the object of a bondage outfit, and
  two we will have to totally handle the marketing side of the project.� 

�Well you're the designer you should be able handle the design side, but what
  do you mean about the marketing side?� 

�Part of the project is marketing the design. &nbsp;Usually you have to make
  the outfit, and then take it one of the tame buyers on the colleges list, to
  discuss costs and marketing, but Mrs Franklin is adamant that no one on the
  list would be interested in a bondage outfit.� 

�What do you think�? 

�Well it's a good idea. &nbsp;A bondage outfit would certainly turn some heads
  at the college, but unless we can fulfil the marketing requirement it's dead
  in the water.� 

�Look, I'll talk to Jimmy and see if he has any ideas.� 

(Jimmy ran the fetish and bondage night's at the club). 

�What are your thoughts on the outfit?� 

�Well, it's got to have a hobble skirt, maybe some sort of arm restraint and
  possibly a posture collar, but I haven't really thought about it�. 

� If I had my way it would have all three.� 

�So would I, but what has got me stumped is Mrs Franklin's spanner in the
  works, that it's got to have a practical side.� 


2 Months Later 

Well the day had arrived, Jimmy had given Per a few numbers and after a multitude
  of phone calls Per had organised the presentation and marketing day. They were
  going to show Dor's design at the Erotica show at Earls Court. Per had got
  finally got hold of a guy at �O' Magazine who showed some interest and said
  they could hold a presentation for exhibitors on their stand after the show
  had closed, but it was their responsibility to drum up the interest. Per had
  got a mate to fetch them some cheap wine back from Calais and he and Dor were
  going to start early at the show trying to entice some of the exhibitors to
  the come to the presentation. &nbsp;&nbsp;

When
  they entered the show, Dor was wearing what at first glance looked like a
  wrinkled 80's power dressing suit in white, with a straight knee length skirt,
  a jacket with a peplum, a wide black patent belt, padded shoulders and a small
  stand up collar. On second glance the detail made it look slightly out of the
  ordinary as the seams were all lined on the outside with webbing and there
  were extra webbing straps and buckles around the long turned back cuffs, around
  the elbows and one at mid thigh and a final one at knee level. The slight capped
  sleeves had what looked to be purely decorative zips and at the back was a
  4� wide bank of what again seemed to be purely decorative l acing from the
  bottom of the skirt to the peplum, and the same on the jacket. 

�Are you sure about this Per. What if we can't get anybody to come ? � 

�Look, the dress is amazing and we only need a couple to come to satisfy Mrs
  Franklin. The guy from �O' said he would provide a photographer, I delivered
  the wine last night . We can only do our best, now are we ready?� 

Per had decided that the enticement of the exhibitors would be a multi stage
  operation with the first stage getting there interest with the dress in it's �practical
  mode�, as such Dor was dressed in accessories she would not normally be seen
  dead in, sensible black courts with a low (for her) 2� heel, white stockings,
  a pair of sensible clear glasses and she had borrowed a blond wig and blow
  dried it into a fashion model style. Her makeup was not her usual blues and
  blacks, but just light blusher and some pink lipstick. She was holding a clipboard
  and would hopefully at first glance look like his assistant. 

Per was wearing a tee-shirt with white lettering - 

ZTTO - Zero to Total Bondage Dress 

  2 lengths of hobble skirt 
  3 types of external arm restraint 
  3 types of internal arm restraint 
  3 types of posture collar 
  Adjustable breast restraint 
  Fully adjustable for all sizes 


He also carried a sports bag with the rest of their gear. 

�Right let's start off with the �O' stand and see what he says.� 

Paul at the �O' stand was happy to talk as the show had only just begun. 

�Well where's the dress then?� 

�She's wearing it!� 

Paul looked at Dor , then re-read the list on Per's tee-shirt, and then looked
  again at Dor. 

�This suit will do all that?� 

�Yep, were going to go round the exhibitors this morning with the dress like
  it is now and hopefully get the same reaction, and later on we we'll keep on
  going round and exposing more and more of its features. Hopefully by five O�clock
  we will have raised enough interest to get some of them to come to the presentation
  and Dor's tutor who is coming along to see it, will pass her on the project.� 

�Well good luck to you, �����.. Are you sure it will do all that?�, pointing
  at Per's tee-shirt. 

They did the round of likely stands and the exhibitors were usually polite,
  but did not show much interest, except for the same disbelief as Paul. Per
  left them all with the same line, 

�We will pop by later to show you some of the features.� 

When they had finished Per said, 

�OK into the toilet, put on your war paint, dump the wig, do your hair and
  I'll meet you on the �O' stand.� 

Dor went in to the Ladies' room took off the wig, and scrubbed off the conservative
  make up. She then applied her full Goth face, heavy white foundation, high
  black eyebrows, blue and black eyeliner in sweeping curves and blood red lip
  stick. &nbsp;She gelled back her black hair into a smooth cap and headed out
  again. 

On
  the �O' stand Per was waiting with some serious boots . &nbsp;Dor thought they
  were fantastic; they had borrowed them from Jimmy's girl friend. The boots
  were black leather, thigh high lace up's, with 6� needle thin metal heels and
  pointed dagger toes. There were two problems with them though, one was that
  Dor was only size 5 and the boots were size 7 , and the other was that with
  such a small foot her highest heel was 41/2� inches and they put her on tip
  toe. But Dor was determined to wear them and so they had padded the toes with
  cotton wool and she had practiced walking in them all the night before. She
  had thought that Per was going to reject them as she was only really stable
  when standing still and then she wobbled, but he said that the tottering walk
  would only add to her look of helplessness as they showed off more and more
  of the features during the day. It took them 20 minutes to lace them up and
  when they were finished Dor was again wishing they were hers. 

�OK , � Per said, �First off, stage one hobble and arms at the side.� 

He first undid the patent belt and then off came the jacket peplum, which
  had been held on by the belt. &nbsp;He then bent down , reached up under the
  skirt , undid four press-studs and pulled down the skirt until it was mid calf
  length. &nbsp;Another webbing strap appeared. He then went behind and tightened
  up the skirt lacing until it pulled into a tight pencil line . He finished
  with the skirt by tightening the webbing straps so they were pulled tight to
  Dor ' s legs. 

�Hey not to tight, I still have got to be able to walk.� 


Per
  ignored her, as he was already undoing the webbing straps at her wrist and
  elbows and threading them through the adjacent loops on the jacket. He pulled
  each one tight and when he had finished Dor's arms were pinned to the jacket
  body. &nbsp;He stood back and saw that the jacket was being pulled out a bit
  so he went round the back and tightened the back lacing until Dor's arms were
  pulled tight to her body. 

Paul from �O' was watching all this with interest . 

�Impressive ! �, and looking at Per's tee- shirt again, �and by the look of
  it, you have still got a way to go.� 

Per and Dorothy set off again, only this time slower, as Dor could only manage
  tiny teetering steps with hobble skirt and the unfamiliar 6� heels. &nbsp;Per
  walked beside her with his hand on one arm ready to catch Dor if she fell as
  she sashayed down the aisles. This time they got a lot more interest from the
  visitors to the show, and several took photographs and the exhibitors were
  more interested. &nbsp;A couple even committed to coming to the presentation.
  They slowly made the rounds; Dor could manage no other speed and made their
  way back to the �O' stand. 
Once there, Per released her arms and Dor sat down and took the weight off
  her aching feet, while Per talked to Paul. After 10 minutes, Per came back
  over to Dor. 

�Right, Paul reckons we still need more people to make it worth while, and
  we've got time for one more round.� 


�Oh not again, these boots are killing me, I know they look great but they
  are not meant for walking in.� 

�It's up to you Dor, we have only got a few names, and some of them might
  turn out to be no shows. &nbsp;We want to make sure we get enough to keep Mrs
  Franklin happy� 

Dor thought about it and knew she had to make the effort, and nodded assent. 

�OK, but what do you have in mind?� 

�Right full hobble, mono-glove arms, full mask, breasts out and the corset
  as tight laced as possible to show how the back lacing allows the dress to
  adjust to your figure.� 

�I am not showing my breasts to all these people. &nbsp;What would people
  think?� 

Paul did not answer, but nodded , behind her. Dor turned and saw five models
  walking by wearing nothing but thongs and high heels. 

� I'd say they would think you were overdressed.� 

Dor said she would think about it and so they started to get her ready. &nbsp;She
  stood up and winced as her feet took the strain of the high heels and her toes
  were compressed and squeezed again. They went to the back of the �O' and took
  off the dress, got the corset and liner out from their bag , put on her corset
  liner and eased the new C &amp; S corset around her waist. &nbsp;With Dor hanging
  onto a door handle, Per quickly laced her down to 24.� 

�How far do you want to go?� 

Dor, thought for a moment. &nbsp;The week before she had got Per to lace it
  closed to 20�, but she had only managed an hour before she had to be let out
  to 22�. 

�Lets try 21!� If there is a time to show of my figure this is it.� 

Per smiled and continued lacing . &nbsp;Dor felt her waist being squashed
  with every tug, and started to pant a little to cope with the compression. 
&nbsp;
Per finished and started tying off. 

�Are you sure that's 21� it's feels really tight?� 

�One inch gap, that should be 21� shouldn't it?� 


�I suppose so, but we had better loosen it before the presentation or I'll
  faint.� 
Back on went the dress and Per reached down and undid some more straps and
  the skirt extended until it reached the top of the heels of the boot. &nbsp;He
  tightened the webbing straps and
  then tightened the back lacing, until Dors legs were pinned together for most
  of there length. Next Per turned down one of the long cuffs until it was well
  past Dor's fingers and then folded the excess over and back and fastened them
  back to a loop on the sleeve using a webbing strap that had been concealed
  in the sleeve. He repeated the act on the other side and Dor was left just
  wearing finger and thumbless white mittens. 

Per then reached inside the shoulders and released the padding on both sides,
  this was the built in posture collar. He pulled both sides out, unrolled them
  and joined the two sides at the front with a zip, covered the zip with a Velcro
  flap and put it down, and then stood back and pointed to the two patch pockets
  of the dress. 

�OK, thinking times over, are you going to really wow these people or are
  you going to chicken out?� 

Dor, got a bit angry at his comment and said, 

�How can anybody call me a chicken? &nbsp;I am the one parading round in this
  outfit, so it's my decision� 

�Well what's it to be?� 

�OK , go for it!� 

Per
  stepped forward and ripped off both the patch pockets, to reveal two circular
  holes with Dor's large breasts peeping out. &nbsp;He reached inside and fingered
  each breast through the hole and then tightened a little noose around the hole
  so that each breast was clamped at the base and Dor's breasts jutted out like
  small round melons. Dor looked down and grimaced. 

�Don't worry! &nbsp;In a minute, you won't be able to see them.� 

�Yes, but I will still be able to feel them, did you have to do them quite
  so tight?� 

�Stop moaning, they look wonderful, really pert� 

Per, zipped the front back up and covered the zip with the velcro flap . &nbsp;H
  e then went behind and tightened the top lacing so that Dor ' s waist was smoothly
  defined and her breasts jutted out from a flat bodice. &nbsp;Next he pulled
  both her arms back and fastened them together at the elbow and the wrist using
  the webbing straps. He tightened them until Dor ' s elbows were touching and
  her shoulders were pulled well back. This had the added effect that her breasts
  were pushed even further out. 

Dor was now totally helpless and with no arms for balance , she started to
  totter slightly backwards and forwards making miniscule 2� steps to the limit
  of the hobble skirt, panting slightly from the exertion as her cramped lungs
  struggled for air. 

Per then pulled a white soft ball out of his pocket with a two webbing straps
  hanging from it, and held it in front of Dor ' s mouth. She gulped and opened
  her mouth wide , and Per forced it in and fastened it tight around her cheeks
  and at the back of her head. He then picked up the posture collar and swung
  it round Dor ' s neck and lower face, knowing what to expect, she tilted her
  head back to 45 degrees and the collar moulded under her chin, Per then joined
  the two sides at the back with a zip and covered the zip with a velcro strap,
  leaving just the rear lacing. The collar had two sets of boning, one set, heavy
  tight packed boning around the neck which forced Dor ' s head back , and in
  between lighter more flexible boning which flowed up, under and around Dor
  ' s chin and up to just under her nose. Once past the jaw the heavier boning
  continued in the mask until to mid way up her ears and even higher at the back.
  When he was happy with the fit, he held it up with two webbing starps over
  the top of her head and laced it tight until the mask was stiff and perfectly
  smooth over Dor ' s face and neck. &nbsp;

Dor now stood as calmly as possible. &nbsp;The only sound was from her now
  was a rapid sniffing noise from nostrils as she pulled in air. Paul from �O'
  had been watching this rapid transformation, came over and said, 

�Dor you look sensational, lets get a few pictures.� &nbsp;He grabbed her
  arm and started moving over towards the front of the stand in front of the �O'
  logo. Dor had no option but to try to follow, and as Paul was moving to fast
  nearly fell in the first foot. &nbsp;Paul realised his mistake and caught her
  and slowly helped her the rest of the way, which was only 10ft, but must have
  taken Dor a minute to complete with her diminutive steps. 

�John, over her mate, lets have a few pictures!� 

A few pictures was three rolls, and she was photographed from every angle,
  full shots, torso shots, head shots and even shots with Per and Paul. As she
  stood there helpless, Dor considered that nobody had asked her if she wanted
  the full frontal shots, but she was in no position to argue. 

�OK, Dor lets get going, if this does not catch their eye nothing will.� 

Per took her arm and led her off the stand, easing her down the 4� step off
  the stand . &nbsp;Dor started off up the aisle. &nbsp;She caused a sensation. &nbsp;Everybody
  stopped or turned to look. They had plenty of time as Dor was moving very slowly,
  tottering along with miniscule steps, with her head angled back and not being
  able to see the ground for at least 10ft in front of her, her arms pinioned
  back, the wasp waist defined by the laced dress, her legs pinioned by the ankle
  length hobble skirt, and all balanced on the inadequate support of the needle
  thin stiletto metallic heels and the postage stamp soles. 

After 10 minutes they had hardly managed 50yds and had still not reached the
  first stand and Per realised that they would run out of time and so leaning
  Dorothy against a convenient column he bent down and relaxed the bottom of
  the hobble skirt. &nbsp;It was still very tight from her hips to below her
  knees, but would allow he r a 5� stride. After this , they made better progress,
  with Per hurrying Dor along and Dor swinging her hips and making a multitude
  of tiny strides up to the limit of the skirt, tottering along beside him. 

This time they did get some interest . &nbsp;Per handed out leaflets and Dor
  stood powerless beside him, wobbling on the heels, displaying the product with
  all she'd got. 

As 5 O'clock approached they ended up back at the �O' stand ready for the
  demonstration. &nbsp;Per quickly unlaced and unzipped the mask and then took
  off the gag and Dor , who was still drooling from the gag, was gasping for
  air. Next she was released from the mono glove and mittens, and while Per bent
  down and started loosening and taking up the hobble, she turned back the cuffs
  to release her hands. She then quickly unzipped the front and released the
  nooses on her breasts and popped them back through the holes in the dress.
  Per reached over to the bag and handed up the patch pockets and Dor tried to
  velcro them back into place, but the dress bodice was still too tight and her
  breasts still so prominent that she could not make them fit. &nbsp;Thus , she
  just velcroed them at the top and left them flapping. Dor then tidied up the
  cuffs and refastened the webbing straps on her arms, trying to make her self
  as tidy as possible. 

When Per had finished with the skirt and adjusted the back lacing so that
  it was back to knee length and straight, he picked up the posture collar, split
  the front zip and handed one side to Dor to roll up. When both sides were rolled,
  he inserted them into them into shoulders and velcroed them into place. Dor
  pointed at the her bosom and Per went around the back to give her enough slack
  to fastened the patch pockets and then found got out the patent belt and peplum
  and refitted them. 

�Damn we forgot to loosen the corset, and my ribs are beginning to really
  ache� 

�No time now, it's nearly five. &nbsp;You tidy up you r makeup and I'll start
  opening the wine� 

Paul had laid out the bottles and some plastic cups on a table, and also put
  a board with one of Per's leaflets on it and somehow found a small podium for
  the presentation, Per had hardly got one bottle open when one of the exhibitors
  turned up, closely followed by Mrs Franklin, Dor ' s tutor. Dor finished her
  makeup and started distributing wine. After 10 minutes, and with about 20 people
  on the stand Paul , announced them and Dor took her place on the podium and
  Per started. 

He first pointed out the nylon material and double stitched webbing reinforced
  seams . He reeled off its features using the list from his tee-shirt. &nbsp;He
  then showed each feature in turn with a running commentary. The first stage
  hobble, the second stage hobble, this time tightening the back lacing until
  Dor's legs were squashed together. He then fastened her arms to the bodice
  and tightened up the back lacing to emphasise the shape of he r tightly laced
  waist. Next he released the arms and extended the cuffs. He then crossed Dor
  ' s arms below her breasts and pulling out a webbing strap and attaching it
  to the loops at the end of the cuffs, pulled it tight , forcing her arms into
  her body to show the strait jacket mode. He then moved quickly on through the
  mono-glove mode as most of the audience had already seen it. &nbsp;As each
  stage was completed the �O' photographer jumped forward and a full roll from
  all angles. Dor tried to look cool calm and collected, but the corset was rally
  digging in, she panted for breath, her feet were killing her and she felt she
  would fall off the small podium any second as Per had tightened the hobble
  so tight that she had less than an inch of movement to correct her balance. 

� And now we go onto show the three internal arm restraints modes,� said Per. 


He
  unzipped the front of the dress and pulled down the top so that Dor could pull
  out her arms. &nbsp;She blushed again as her breasts were again put on display
  to the public, although nobody could see her red cheeks through her heavy white
  foundation. Per pushed the sleeves up through the arm holes into the dress
  and sealed the holes with the two now functional zips. Dor put her arms behind
  her so that her forearms were parallel. &nbsp;Per next raised an open topped
  rectangular bag sown to the back of the bodice up around her elbows and then
  fastened the front of the dress again, some of the audience began to clap and
  Dor tried a little bow. Per stepped up and helped do a slow rotate (Dor could
  manage nothing other than slow) and the audience clapped again. 
    





  Once she was facing front again, Per quickly unzipped the front and lowered
    the bag down from her elbows. &nbsp;He then folded both bottom corners up
    to the top middle to form a triangle and fixed them with straps. Dorothy
    folded her arms behind her once again. &nbsp;This time with her forearms
    upwards to form a triangle, Per raised the bag and pulling it tightly upwards
    and then fastened it to the front of the dress again. More applause. 


  
    
    
  


&nbsp;Down cam e the dress again ; this time he folded the back upwards in half
and Dor stretched her arms backwards into a reverse prayer. She was not very
good at this position and so when Per raised the bag over her arms, he had to
force her arms upwards so that he could zip up the front. Even more applause. 

�And now for the finale, the posture collar and the breast bondage . � 

He went on to explain that the posture collar could be supplied in three heights,
  low lightly boned, high and stiffly boned and high with the facemask. &nbsp;He
  then unzipped the front again , reached in and pulled the posture collar from
  the shoulder pads, pulled off the patch pockets, fed Dors breasts through the
  holes and cinched them tight at the base. He fastened on the gag, and then
  zipped up the two halves of the posture collar, laced it tight and stood back. 

�And there you are ladies and gentlemen, zero to total bondage in one , � looking
  at Mrs Franklin, �a totally practical outfit, designed and modelled by Dor
  . � 

The audience applauded loudly, and Per bowed . &nbsp;Dorothy , however, stood
  wobbling on the podium and could not see them. &nbsp;All she could see was
  the roof. 

Per quickly relented and released her from the posture collar and lifted her
  down from the podium to answer questions and let the exhibitors see it up close,
  he still left her arms bound, and the hobble skirt tight and Dor wobbled as
  she tried to look composed in front of the exhibitors. 

Dorothy began answering questions , about material, cost etc and then saw
  Mrs Franklin at the back of the crowd . &nbsp;Mrs Franklin, stuck up her thumb
  and mouthed �A+� and waved goodbye.
