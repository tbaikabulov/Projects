TOP
OF THE LIGHTHOUSE

&nbsp;

By Wolff

&nbsp;

�2006 Wolfwerks

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

She was obsessed with the old
lighthouse. She did not know if it was its blatant phallic form or the white
light on the top � now extinguished � or something else, but it held a siren
call for her.

&nbsp;

When she mentioned it would be
nice to watch fireworks from it, he said with exasperation, �You want a
lighthouse? I�ll GIVE you a lighthouse AND fireworks. Oh yes!�

&nbsp;

Oh the Fourth of July, at dusk,
he made her drive them to the lighthouse in her convertible. She was wearing a
billowing gray skirt and a tight white latex corset. It took him an hour to
lace it tightly. Tina�s mirrored shades defended her from occasional insulting
stare at her elegant steel collar or her ringed boobs riding proud above it.
She did not know what he had in mind, but, she knew it would be SOMETHING wicked
and hot. He was moody as he often was. 

&nbsp;

She drove fast. 

&nbsp;

They arrived at the desolate
promontory and he took her towards the lone stone finger, its whiteness
sketched against the darkening sky. It was windy and cool. Walking across the
grass in her high-heeled Manolos he made her wear was tricky.

&nbsp;

They arrived at the fence and Tina
stared at the sign:����������������������������� 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

DANGER

&nbsp;

THIS SITE IS NOT SAFE

�

THE BUILDING IS UNDER
RECONSTRUCTION

&nbsp;

ABSOLUTELY NO VISITORS.

&nbsp;

TRESPASSERS WILL BE
PROSECUTED.

&nbsp;

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

A pang of fear ran through her
body. Tina felt his hand grip her guts. �If it is unsafe, what are we�..?�

&nbsp;

She saw him pocket his cell
phone after a brief exchange and pull out a key. He opened the creaking gate
and motioned her through.

&nbsp;

As she passed him, he ripped
off her skirt in one motion.� After
all,� it was made to be ripped off. He
stuffed it into a puffer bag and pulled out a latex arm binder and cuffs
connected with a single, wide link.

&nbsp;

Tina obediently offered her
hands on her back. The clutch and antsy fear inside her stomach grew stronger.
Once he cuffed her, he took his time lacing the arm binder. It went almost to
shoulders and gripped her arms excruciatingly. Then he bent her arms at elbows,
pulling her cuffed hands towards her head. He connected them to her collar and
finally tied it all tightly, using extra laces to bind it to her corset. The arrangement
pushed her heavily ringed tits even further out.

��������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������� 

The boiling calm of the space
enveloped her as he slapped her now very exposed ass, moving her towards the
dark opening at the base of the lighthouse.

&nbsp;

As she stared at the metal
door, he blindfolded her, muttering: �And now let�s work towards the slut
fireworks.�

&nbsp;

She heard the grate of the door
and fretfully moved in.

&nbsp;

Somehow she FELT the
tubular space rising above her. In her mind, it was vast and threateningly
stifling at the same time. She imagined a wooden stairs hugging its sides,
winding towards the top platform three stories away. They stairs must be
following a row of narrow windows that she noticed before.

&nbsp;

He pushed her on and she heard
wood resound under her heels. She flinched as he gripped her ass cheek and
yelped as he shoved a butt plug unceremoniously in her ass. It was unlubed.

&nbsp;

�You will now earn every step
of the way up. A bitch has to work for her way to the top.�

&nbsp;

She heard the soft then sharp
whisper of the flogger. It echoed in the lighthouse as it connected with her
bareness. 

&nbsp;

�Move on, bitch. And keep
moving.�

&nbsp;

She moved.

&nbsp;

She found her way up the stairs
one torturous, stammering step at the time. The flogger mercilessly spurred her
on. The rhythmical cadence of the echoing strikes was etched on her ever
reddening ass.

&nbsp;

After a few steps she tripped
and felt his hand grip her shoulder steadying her.

&nbsp;

�Careful little one. These
stairs are old and in bad repair. Reach the top if you can.�

&nbsp;

He went on with his job and she
went on with hers. She imagined a lonely form of the bound woman casting a long
shadow across the creaky stairs and bare walls towards the yawing hole in the
middle. Unforgiving instrument of pain urged her on towards the unknown�s
heights.

&nbsp;

Her beaded pussy began to
twitch insistently.

&nbsp;

Suddenly her foot found an
empty space instead of the step. She stumbled and this time he did not hold her
and she fell heavily on the first landing.

&nbsp;

His hand gripped the butt plug
base, pulled it out, and rammed it back forcefully, pushing her across the old
planks.

&nbsp;

�MOVE BITCH! Crawl if you have
to!�

&nbsp;

She crawled. She heard creaking
and thought she felt the platform move under her. Another, stronger pang of
fear ran from her stomach to her curled toes and back.

&nbsp;

He pushed her on. She crawled
until her trembling hands found the first step of the next flight of stairs.
She felt his arm around her torso, enveloping her, grabbing her throat, pulling
her face upwards. Her open, trembling lips rose in an inarticulate plea.

&nbsp;

�The next rate of the payment!�
she heard him whisper throatily.

&nbsp;

The painful tugging spread from
her nipples. He had attached the connecting chain to her heavy nipple rings.
She knew he was linking the leash to it. He threw it over her shoulder and
looped it through the link connecting her cuffs and drew it tight. 

&nbsp;

He pushed her onwards and the
leashes tightened. Tina�s tits screamed. She tottered on her feet feeling its
very presence steadying her.

&nbsp;

The familiar whizzing whistle
preceded the sharp cut of pain on her plugged bottom. The cane was to goad her
on the next level.

&nbsp;

She moved on, leaning far
forward, leaning on the tight leash, her pulled boobs paying the price of
security. The empty lighthouse acted as acoustic torture chamber. Amplified and
multiplied THWACKS on her ass and buttock carried more weight that the pain
itself. It propelled her upwards along the shaky stairway.

&nbsp;

The creaking gave her repeated
jitters. Tina moved from side to side. She would brush the walls feeling the
powdered mortar falling on her and then she would slide to the other side,
imagining the stairs leaning toward the empty space, the spine of the now
dreadful lighthouse.

&nbsp;

Tina always thought the stories
about sluts slipping in their own juice were just a fantasy. She was not sure
about that anymore. Her inner thighs were slick with her juice and sweat. Her
feet were slipping and sliding in her moisture-filled Manolos. 

��������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������� 

She was moving deeper and
deeper into uncharted regions of subspace. Tina felt tightly packed and
enclosed in scratchy cotton � yet horribly free. The humiliating throb of her
pussy was triggered by increasing waves of pain and fear. It pushed her into a
no-think zone.

&nbsp;

Tina could feel and hear the
stairs dangerously moving and swaying. She felt herself tottering on their very
edge, certain there was no railing. She held back from the kiss of the abyss
only by his strong hold on her leash - hoping that he will not let her fall.
Surprisingly she was not certain of it any more.

&nbsp;

Her mind flashed the black and
white image: an armless woman leaning deeply forward, almost crawling, held
onto the leash by the man swinging the cane viciously. In the back-lighted halo
of light his hair was flying wildly. His heavy breathing and laughter were echoing
in starkly lit vertical space.

&nbsp;

Their huge shadows stretched
expressionistically on the walls, following them like a ghost of old black and
white horrors.

&nbsp;

She knew that the abyss they
were circling was bottomless. It�s ravenousness was unquenchable. No amount of
her cunt juice could fill it. She had an absurd vision of a flock of bats
rising from it, circling the pair, screeching in mad hilarity. They left
towards the top. , their fluttering shadows chased them on the stone walls.

&nbsp;

�Tina flopped on the second landing, rough
planks rousing her briefly from the vision.

&nbsp;

Her ravaged bottom screeched,
too, joining her tortured tits. Her trembling, cane-marked legs trashed as he
mercilessly pulled her up with the leash. She was whimpering loudly, tears
streaming under her blindfold

&nbsp;

Grabbing her from behind, his
hands traveled her body. He did not refrain from molding her hurting breasts to
his hand. Suddenly he slammed her against the wall. She shrieked. Her bound
hands seemed torn.

&nbsp;

His hand crushed her sappy
pussy lips. His fingers slipped in, almost lost in the liquid volcano. Gripped tightly
the betraying flesh he pulled it apart viciously. 

&nbsp;

She felt the rings tugged as he
threaded the leashes through them.

&nbsp;

The leather strip from her pussy
rings was slipped over her hips. Knowing he was gathering all reins in one
hand, she took one tentative step forward and lost her footing. Her ruined
Manolos flew away, clattered on the wood and disappeared. She pictured it
falling, slowly turning as it went towards the peace of abyss still denied to
her. 

&nbsp;

Tina was almost hanging by the
leashes attached to rings piercing her tender flesh. A searing pain enveloped
her as her tits were pulled upwards and her pussy lips spread more than she
thought possible.

&nbsp;

He moved sideways letting her
regain her footing, then, flashed the cat sharply between her open legs. She
gasped, bit her tongue, and jerked forward.

&nbsp;

�The payment for the last leg
is due, bitch. The end of stairways to heaven gate is in sight.�

&nbsp;

The last circle along the
creaking stairs was a journey through the red fog. The seven tongued cat played
its fiery dance all over her body, and whenever he legs moved, apart it kissed
her leashed pussy. 

&nbsp;

The pain impulses merged with
the wild swaying of the stairwell. She was like a ship in the blinding storm �
the lighthouse beckoned to her too. He spurred on his double leashed bitch
mercilessly upwards. Her spread, yet empty cunt sang a siren song to him. They
were enveloped in it�s emanations and their intermingled sweat.

&nbsp;

The fear that the stairs will
give and send them crashing down and that he did not CARE, became almost
comfortable. The corridor of her mind she was traveling was narrowing.

&nbsp;

The night is darkest just
before the dawn.

&nbsp;

Tina did not even realize they
were on the final landing.� She was still
trying to crawl forward feebly. Although exhausted and her mind was in the grip
of pain � she only wanted to crawl on forever. As long as he held her reins
this was the tortuous heaven she wanted to be submitted to. It was the top for
her.

&nbsp;

She felt him lifting her.
Hanging limp on his arm she though she heard the door opening, felt him kick
away her remaining shoe and push her forward.�


&nbsp;

A sudden gust of cold evening
breeze told her they had reached the top.

&nbsp;

He carried her forward. Then
put her down, letting her walk the last few steps on her bare feet. As she had
felt the enclosed space of the inside she now felt the open space of the
outside.� She was on the circular
platform below the light source itself.

&nbsp;

Her lower chest encountered the
metal railing and she leaned over it, her heaving breast hanging in the empty
space. He pulled her leashes back.

&nbsp;

Tina felt his hand his hand
gripping the base of her buttplug. He ripped it out of her ass and snatched
away her blindfold at the same time.� 

&nbsp;

The space yawned in front of
her and the vertigo gripped her. The sky was almost dark; the little bit of
light on the other side of the bay seemed tiny and distant.

&nbsp;

The dry cracks of the first
fireworks and accompanying music also seemed distant.

&nbsp;

The multicolored light flowered
into the sky, showering towards the water and their smudged reflections.

&nbsp;

His cock shot in her ass insistently.


&nbsp;

His knees bent slightly and his
torso moved backwards. He gripped her legs and lifted them off the ground,
securing them at the small of his back, above his ass. Instinctively, she
tightened her calf muscles, hugging him with her legs.

&nbsp;

She was spread like a starfish
on his body, his ravaging cock her only support.

&nbsp;

His bitch began to yelp and
pant as he pumped her asshole furiously. Each stroke seemed deeper and he would
wait for a second, gripping her by shoulders, drawing her closer, crushing her
bound hands in his heaving chest. Then he almost ripped it out of her screaming
anus and slammed it in even deeper.

&nbsp;

The swirling fireworks paled
and disappeared. She exploded into her own fireworks, riding into the dark on
the rocked of her orgasm.

&nbsp;

The various pains and
restraints sublimed into one mighty hand pushing her into ecstasy. Only his
insistent cock remained. Then, it too disappeared.

&nbsp;

Wave upon wave of cum took her.

&nbsp;

As the orgasmic waves receded,
she felt his body turned sideways. His hand gripped her head and tuned it back
and upwards. She stared uncomprehendingly.�
She did not want to understand anything, anyway.

&nbsp;

Suddenly the beacon light came
to life, in obvious synchronization with the fireworks. It was Independence Day
after all.

&nbsp;

The blinding white light
triggered something in her. She moved from the howling darkness area into a
howling light. The cum wave rose again and carried her away into the
brightness.

&nbsp;

He plowed in her ass again. He
was exploring the eternal mystery: how many times a submissive can be made to
cum with such simple act as assfucking?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Later, he let her kneel on her
haunches and stare across the bay at the sky, now dark again. The fireworks
were appropriately over. The beacon light was turning silently. The railing
resembled vertical cage bars. That was appropriate too.

&nbsp;

He was breathing heavily, no
need to say that was even more appropriate. His hand was gliding softly over
her damp hair.

&nbsp;

Then he picked her up and led
her, holding her leashes lightly back to the door leading into lighthouse
insides.

&nbsp;

Her eyes widened as she beheld
the brightly lit interior.

&nbsp;

The winding stairs were brand
new and freshly painted, as was steel railing.�
Even the smell of fresh pain was distinct in the air. It was laced with
their sweat and her pussy juice.

&nbsp;

He smiled gently but his eyes
remained dark and their glint was mercilessly mischievous.

&nbsp;

�It took some effort to
synchronize our visit with the end of repairs. The mind is the most intensive playground
and dungeon of them all, don�t you think?�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

END?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

He pulled out his notebook and
crossed the lighthouse just below the gallery.

&nbsp;

Next on the list were Maxim�s
and the zoo.

&nbsp;

�The ZOO will take several
visits at least,� he muttered. �I think I will finally cum there.�
