A sad, depressed and bittersweet story. 

Disclaimer: All though inspired by a real story, this is fiction. It is a story-taking place in a horrible society where 
money and money only makes the world going round. Disgusting events according to Danish standard are 
described and I would wish that we could save the world back from Denmark, so people did not need to go 
trough such a life, but we can only watch the unjust to happen. The solution has to come from the government 
on the Philippines. I have written this story in response to a TV-program, where those people who exploit those 
poor girls portrayed like angels. 

Synopsis: A young innocent woman gets a rollercoaster ride kind of life out of her control. 

1) A peaceful childhood 

It was the year 1977, when a little girl was born on a remote island about 150 kilometres from Manila. Her 
parents lived of the sea and electrical power, school etc. was not at hand. Linda, as the girl was name lived the 
first 14 years of her life on the island with her sisters. She did not learn to read. Every Saturday the village went 
to a neighbour, which had a radio running on batteries, where they were informed about what went about in the 
world outside. The island was her world; she did not know anything of the world outside. 

Her older sisters all left their homes when they were 14. It was custom because there was no kind of future 
living on the island. Fishing could not support more than those people, which already lived on the Island. Some 
weeks, then her father did not catch anything, they had to live of the few things, and they could grow on the 
Island. 

When she was 14, her parents called her and told her that one of her uncles had a job for her. It was not quite a 
real uncle, but a former angler, which had established himself with a bar at the nearby city on the mainland. 
Linda was crying but she knew in her heart that her parents would not have let her go, if they could have 
provided for her themselves. 

Her "uncle" Bill came for her. He seems to be a relaxed elderly man of about 50 years. On the verge of tears, 
she parted with her parents hoping that some day she could return to the Island. Little did she know that her all 
too short childhood would become the happiest years of her life.

2) Uncle Bill�s bar and Linda�s new uniform. 

When she arrived at her new living place, she was shown where to sleep. A little chamber, she had to share 
with another girl on her own age. After a while, Bill called her to his office. 

When she arrived, two other men also were in the office. 

�Undress!� Bill�s voice was to firm that she did not dare to argue with him. She blushed when she slowly took off 
all her clothes. 

When she was naked, one of the men took out a tape measure and noted the size of her waistline. Then he 
took some kind of steel band and put it around her waist. A part of steel thing went trough her legs and the man 
connected it on her back. It was a little tight but not unbearable. Then he took padlock and she heard a click 
when it closed. 

�This is your chastity belt. Now my investment is preserved.� Uncle Bill seemed to be in a cheerful mind. �Try on 
your uniform!� 

Linda took the dress shown to her and tried to dress. It looked unfamiliar to her but it was a French maid 
uniform. However, the underwear should be put on first and she did not know the concept of a corset. It could 
be laced on the back and one of the men offered his help to her. 

�Place your hands on the table.� Linda did as he told her, but when he pulled the laces, she had to let go. 

�I can not breathe! Stop!� 

�You have to do as we tell.� Bill and the other man took her hands and cuffed them to a pair of leather cuffs. The 
cuffs were connected to a rope hanging from the ceiling and they hoisted her body of the ground. Then the 
connected two other cuffs to her legs. Those two cuffs were connected to the ground. They continued to pull the 
rope until her body was stretched entirely out. 

The first man continued his work of lacing her corset. Linda protested, shouted and groaned, but he did not stop 
and at some point, she was only able to grunt when he pulled the laces. 

Bill commanded the man to stop. �We have to wait for the fabric to adjust before we continue. Go and get some 
cups of coffee.� 

Linda hanged sobbing in her arms. They were so sore and she felt like being cut in half. 

When the men had finished their coffee, they continued to lace her corset. Linda was on the verge of losing 
consciousness and grunted every time they pulled. Finally, they were satisfied and lowered her to the ground. 
Then she painfully took the rest of the uniform on. 

�Here. Wipe those tears away. Get one of the girls. We have to apply some makeup and train her to walk.� 
Another older girl came in and Bill commanded her to take Linda out in the bar and train her to walk.

3) Training and first day on work. 

Samantha as the other girl was named, gave her some shoes to wear. 

Linda tried to take them on, but she could only stand up strait because of the rigid corset. Samantha helped her 
and had to support her when she took her first step. Linda had never worn high-heels and did almost fall, 
whenever she tried to take a step. Samantha helped her and after a half hour she could walk almost normal. 

Next Samantha gave her a tray with plastic service on. Of course, Linda dropped the service the first times she 
tried to handle it. However, she practiced and real glasses and plates replaced the plastic service. 

Finally, Samantha told her to sit on a chair. It hurt in her stomach when she sat down and she at once 
straitened her back. Samantha applied lipstick and took care of her hair. When Linda saw her self in the mirror, 
she almost could not believe what she saw. 

In the evening, the bar opened. Linda�s job was to take order from the customers and wash the dishes. 
Samantha told her that there were two kinds of employees beside Bill. The entertainment girls and the 
waitresses. She would graduate to entertainment girl when Bill could get the right price for her. 

Linda worked hard. Once when she was serving a customer his drink, his hand slipped up under her skirt, but 
he pulled his hands back, when he felt the steel. �Bill always thinks of everything.� he remarked. Linda blushed 
of shame. 

Linda was tired. She had been travelling all day and fell almost at sleep around 10. Bill noticed that ordered her 
to the kitchen. He followed her and took a heavy rubber apron and told her to wear it and some heavy rubber 
gloves too. Then she was ordered to take care of the dishes for the rest of the evening. 

Around three in the morning she finally and exhausted was followed to bed by Bill. When they came to her 
room, he helped her to undress from her uniform, but the corset had to remain on. In order to avoid her 
escaping from the place he gave her a leather collar on which were connected to the wall by a chain. Her hands 
were put inside some leather gloves to she could not fiddle with her laces. She also got a leather belt on where 
the gloves were hooked on some D-rings in the side. Linda fell asleep almost at once.

4) A violent customer. 

The days went by and the daily routine was almost the same. 

About noon, she woke. When one of the older girls came to the rooms to check on them once an hour, she was 
helped to the toilet, where she made her business. Only once a week she got the chastity belt off so she could 
get a bath. Bill and some of the men watched her very carefully when it was time. An hour later, she was in her 
uniform, preparing the bar for the customers. 

When the bar opened, she was in the bar until midnight, where she moved to the kitchen to clean up and help 
where help was needed. 

About three, she went to bed. After some months, she no longer was cuffed and collared. She had adjusted to 
her new life. It was hard but it was a living. 

One night however, she experienced a nightmare. Just before she was going to bed, all the garbage stood by 
the door and waited to be taken out. Normally Bill helped her, but he was busy because there were some 
sailors in town, so Linda decided to take the garbage out by her self. 

When she was almost finished, a pair of hands grabbed her from the back. It was a drunken sailor. He threw 
her over a bench and unbuttoned his trousers. Then he pulled her skirt up and discovered the chastity belt. 
�What the fuck? You little tart! I am going to strangle you instead.� 

Then she heard a knock. The sailor fell to the ground. It was Bill with a baton. He gave the sailor a couple of 
kicks in his stomach and ordered Linda inside. A half hour later, he returned remarking something about a man 
talking with the fishes. Linda was told to go the bed at once. 

The next day Bill called her to his office. When she sat in the chair, Bill explained that she never must leave the 
bar without guard because she would be an easy target. �I have told you that before and therefore you will be 
punished. Undress!� 

All her clothes even the belt came off. Then he ordered her to take the leather cuffs on and to bend over a table 
in the corner. Her cuffs were secured to the table so her behind were up in the air. �I am so sorry to do this to 
you, but our rules are for your own safety. I am only going to spank you with this soft latex whip, so you do not 
get wounds. It would decrease the value of my investment.� 

Then he whipped her behind. Linda cried out every time he hit her. Her parents never disciplined her. She had 
never experienced such a pain. Finally, he was done and hugged her to comfort her. �Never let me down 
again!� She promised.

5) Return of Investment (ROI) 

As the months went by, Linda�s body developed and she noticed that more than often Bill would discuss her 
with some of the customers. One morning Bill called for her, when she was finished on the toilet and about to 
dress. As she went into his office, she noticed the two men from her first day at Bill�s place. 

One of the men released her laces. Then her chastity belt went off. Linda felt it odd. She had worn the corset for 
almost two years. Her back needed support and she was relieved when he gave her a red PVC corset. Once 
more, she was hoisted in the cuffs and prepared to be laced. �Your old corset was 18 inches. The new corset is 
16 inches. Do you want something to bit on when he adjust it.� 

Linda nodded and they putted a bit gag in her mouth. Then the man began to work on her. Several time she 
blackened and Bill used smelling salt to get her back again. When they lowered her and showed her the result 
in a large mirror. Her body was almost bizarre. Her waist was formed like an hourglass and her small breast had 
been pushed up and together making them look bigger. 

They gave her a golden gown and a read PVC collar on. Then they went to the bar. On the stage, there was a 
golden cage. Next to the cage, the pole was where the entertainment girls used to dance around. Samantha 
came and taught her how to dance and show the most of her. Linda blushed when she told her to put her 
behind in the air because she did not have trousers on. 

Linda was a quick learner and when the bar opened, she got to dance. At midnight, John led her to the cage 
and when he had shut the door, he took the microphone. �May I have your attention? In the golden cage, a little 
bird is waiting to sing in private for the highest bidder. May I have an offer?� 

A lot of men raised their arms and numbers flew in the air. It took 20 minutes before a short European man won. 
He got the key to the cage from Bill and they went upstairs. He went to one of the rooms and Linda had to 
follow because Bill had seen to that there was a chain to her collar, the man could hold on to. 

Inside the room, he undressed and Linda was a little shocked by his pale body. He noticed her reaction and 
tried to relax her. 

�Relax! My name is Ib Colding and I am only a Danish tourist out for some fun. I need you to comfort me. Back 
home people disagreeing with my political view had thrown rocks at my house, the bank would not loan my 
money and every time I visit the local supermarket, the employees complained about the sight of my body, so I 
decided to travel around the world. Normally I prefer Japanese girls, but you could do.� 

He smelled so bad. Linda remembered and story a visitor to the island told the children. The name of the story 
was �The snow-queen� by a famous Danish author. Perhaps it was too cold in Denmark to take a bath. Linda 
took her dress off when he told her. She climbed in to the bed and faced the wall resting on her elbows and 
knees and he commanded her. The tourist positioned him self behind her. Suddenly she felt a pain. 
�Auuuuwww�. 

He was going to impale her. That was how she felt it. No foreplay, just pressure. She was crying and he 
continued to pump her. Slowly his penis worked its way up inside her dry love canal. �Say my name while we 
make love.� But Linda did not get the time to say his name more than once. Ib came with a grunt while he 
trusted his penis violent all the way in. He pulled out at once and gave her an extra 100$ Then he left. 

Linda cried when Samantha entered the room. She hugged Linda and tried to comfort her by assuring her that 
not all men were like that. But Linda�s world had turned out to be a lie and Samantha was just adding to that 
fact. 

Linda was how ever a quick learner and she learned how to mentally disconnect from her body while sweating 
and smelling elderly men did have a go at her.

6) The Dutch manager 

One night when she was dancing at the pole, a handsome young man in his late twenties came in the bar. Later 
when her dance was over, she approached him trying to get him as a costumer. It would be a change from the 
elderly men. 

They got to talk and he told her, that he was a co-owner of a growing internet company. Linda did not know 
what the internet was. She could not even read. However, Svend, as the manager was called, seemed to be a 
nice person. During the evening, he bought her drinks and at some point, when Bill came by to make thing 
happen, he also got a drink, which seems to calm him down. When the bar closed, Linda had survived a day 
without ending up in bed with someone and that was quite remarkable. 

The next day when the bar was getting ready to open, the Dutch manager came by and demanded to tall to Bill. 
When he left Bill�s office, he told her that she now was his property and he had bought her for 200$. She 
packed her few belongings and went with the manager. 

They drove in his car some hours and then they ended up at a small house, where he told her, she was going to 
live as his mistress and perhaps wife one day. 

Linda thought she was in heaven. Comparing the standards she had been used to, this was unbelievable. In the 
sleeping room, there was a large soft bed. �You need some clothes. I would arrange for a colleague from the 
internet business to come by with some clothes. Then he unlaced her and ordered her to take a bath. 

Later in the afternoon, she had been given a complete wardrobe. He showed her round in the house. When he 
discovered that she could not cook and read, he arranged a servant to come. 

He ordered some takeaway and she had a fine dinner. When it was time to go to bed, he told her to wait. �I 
have something from my company, you should try first. It is a new dress from Germany, which is a country in 
Europe.� 

She was surprised when she saw the dress. It was made of leather and had two leather cuffs at each side 
connected to a corset with straps instead of laces. When he had dressed her and she was immobilized, he 
fastened a leather strap, which went between her legs. He put a posture collar around her neck, which made it 
impossible to lower her head. She had to look up and it was difficult for her to breathe. 

He made her lie down on her back and the he took a vibrator and began to massage her softly on her clit. It was 
a funny feeling. Normally she had always connected sex to a swift pain but this was different. She felt pleasure 
and it made her ashamed. However, she was at his mercy and finally she caved in to her body and had her first 
orgasm. 

�When I have trained you properly, you would earn the right to my member, not sooner.� 

Linda felt asleep in her restraint wondering what kind of business Svend owned.

7) The mother in law 

Linda lived at Svend�s place for the next months. Sometime he was away on business trips for weeks. Linda 
soon discovered that the golden cage, she was placed in at Bill�s place had been replaced by a larger cage. At 
17 of age, she could not read books and understand the funny languages at on the satellite canals in the 
television. 

When he returned home, he always seems to have a new kind of kinky toy to test on her. A question, which had 
bothered her for some time, she finally got her self to ask one morning. 

�What kind of business do you own?� 

�It is an adult website with interactive entertainment. It is called &gt;&gt;cool diamantes&lt;&lt;. I am quiet regarded a 
master of java programming inside the internet business.� 

Later that afternoon he received a long distance phone call. He was quiet upset when he was finish. �My mother 
is coming here to visit us in a week. We have to make you look decent. She is always talking about me 
marrying a girl and now I have brought you for the purpose, so let us fool her by doing it on the same day she 
arrive. Then I could get some peace.� 

Some days later, Svend and Linda waited at the airport. �There she is.� 

Linda saw a 200-pound woman approaching. �Hey Svend. Who is this nice thing, you have there?� she said 
pointing at Linda. 

�It is my wife to come. We are going to get married this afternoon.� 

The jaw of the woman hit the floor. 

�Linda� Linda presented her self. 

�Ann� the woman replied almost speechless. 

Later that evening the all three went by a priest where they exchanged vows. Svend and Linda were now 
husband and wife. 

Linda seemed that Ann talked down to her and did not take her serious. Ann and Svend had an argument when 
Linda had told her how they met. Linda could feel the cold from Ann and she made remarks when she 
discovered that Linda did not cook. Both were a kind of relieved when Ann went back to Netherland after a 
week. 

That night they had full intercourse together for the first time. Linda almost got scared because Svend seemed 
to lose control like let an animal lose from inside.

8. Children and Linda�s sister. 
Linda had not felt good for some time, when one day the servant called her to the phone. It was her sister Katie. 
She sounded a little offended. �Why have you not called us, when you started to live with Svend? We are your 
family after all. Just because you had married a rich man, there is no reason to deny your roots.� 

Linda tried to explain that Bill at the bar had not given her any address of her family. Because she could not 
read her search for her sister�s phone number had not been a success. Her sister seemed to calm down and 
they agreed to meet at Linda�s home the next day. 

When Katie and her husband Tom visited Linda, they looked around obvious very impressed with the life Linda 
was living. Then Katie said. �I can see that you are pregnant.� Linda became surprised. She did not know 
anything about these things; no one had talked with her about the subject. 

She asked the housekeeper to call Svend at his job and when she told him the news, he became so happy. �I 
have always wanted kids.� When he returned a week later, he brought her flowers. 

Linda�s pregnancy did go without complications and she gave birth to a lovely little girl. However, all the events 
in her life had gone too fast and she got confused. Even thought, she once a long time ago in the island had 
cared for smaller children, a baby in her stressed situation proved too much. It was lucky that her sister offered 
her assistance as a nurse. Svend was delighted. His business was expanding and he also was nervous about 
Linda�s situation and no man can be at two places in the same time. 

Katie almost moved in at their place. Linda slept almost the whole day in her worn out condition. Slowly Linda 
recovered but Katie stayed. Svend wanted a second child and he soon got her pregnant once more. This time 
her pregnancy was difficult. The doctor ordered her to remain at bed the last 2 month until the baby was 
delivered. The birth was difficult and she lost a lot of blood. Her sister had to enter her bedroom and milk her 
because she had not the strength to feed the child herself. 

Katie had taken over the household. She talked to Svend alone and Svend agreed to buy her a car and hire 
some of her children to do other jobs at Linda and Svend�s home. Cleaning, cocking and even shopping had at 
some point been taken over by Linda�s family. After a while the old maid left and she also was replaced by 
another member of Linda�s family. 

Svend did not care. He even lost interest in her regarding sex because he now had those two children he 
always had wanted. Linda was very lonely in her golden cage.

9. The new security guard. 
The police in Manila was underpaid and lacked resources, so when a lot of building was robbed, Svend asked 
Katie to arrange for a security firm to patrol their street. Katie went about to the neighbours soon they had 
gathered enough families to hire a security firm to guard their neighbourhood. 

Linda first met Officer Austin when the alarm in the house malfunctioned. He seemed to be a nice person and 
she decided to go to lunch in the city. Katie warned her of him. �You do not know much about life. He only 
wants one thing from you.� 

Linda did not take her serious and Svend had just called in that he would be away for a month due some 
disagreement with his partners. She dated Austin and after lunch, they went to the cinema. 

It was not the last time. Austin bought her flowers and cared for her. One evening, when they were in town they 
ended up in his apartment, where he offered her coffee, before she left. 

When they sat in his sofa, he moved closer to her and gave her a soft kiss. She did not resist. Softly he took her 
and carried her into his bed. She had missed the soft touch of a lover. He remembered Svend, when she first 
met him and he taught her sex in a new way. Austin kissed her and squeezed her breast softly. 

The he teased her clit softly with a gentle touch. Linda felt so good. His every touch was almost electrical. When 
she was on the edge of an orgasm, he entered her. Wet from the stirring up, it was easy for him to trust his 
penis way all in and she came. 

Waive after waive of pleasure went trough her body and she moaned and shivered, while Austin worked on her. 
Austin also came and they fell asleep almost at once. 

The next morning Linda was tortured with guilt. She had betrayed Svend. When she entered her home that 
morning, she could see the contempt in the faces of her family. They knew! Only Katie showed other signs. 
Linda thought it look like satisfaction.

10. Svend�s business problem 
Svend sat at his office in Hong Kong. He was angry. Their turnover had increased, but the revenue had 
dropped. 

Since the start of the company, Svend had programmed the solution in Java. Now with an increased staff with 
little knowledge of Java, he was under pressure to add some .NET solutions. They were costly regarding the 
price of a Java-solution. 

Arnold his partner did argue in favour of a .Net solution. It was the first real crisis in the company�s history. 
Since the start, Svend had been the keystone in programming the solutions. He felt slighted as if the other 
owners wanted to free themselves from him. 

It was to damn frustrating and he felt that he spent too much time at his work instead of being together with his 
family. He needed to get his frustration out of his system and went to the company dungeon where he whipped 
one of the poor girls they used as models in their website. His company had always been doing a lot for the 
employees and the dungeon was a marvellous idea from the human resource department.

11. The entire family on the take. 
Katie woke Linda one morning with concern in her voice. �There had been a storm at our parent�s island. The 
roof of their house fell down. Luckily, they were not hurt. But now they have no place to live.� 

�We can buy supplies with some of the money I get from Svend. Perhaps I can get some in advance. I would 
phone Svend at once.� 

When Svend heard the reason for her call, he replied that they did not need to use Linda�s allowance. They 
could built a new house with a loan from him and enlarged the house a little so there could be some space for 
Linda to live in when she some day would visit her parents. It would be healthy for his children to know their 
grandparents. 

The new house was constructed within a month and Linda, together with Katie and her children all went to visit 
her parents. It was her first visit back home since she left for Bill�s Bar. It was still a peaceful place, but Linda 
had changed. She could not find peace and neither here at her birthplace she was without problems. Her father 
was getting old and the fishing had not been good for some time. As result, Linda ended up sending a little 
amount every month to her parents after all out of her allowance. 

Back in Manila, Katie continued running the household. One day when Linda was shopping with Austin, they 
met Tom -Katie�s husband. Tom had not seen Linda, when he greeted Austin. They knew each other, which 
Linda had no knowledge of. When he saw Linda, he greeted her shortly and then disappeared from sight. 

Linda personal life with Svend had ended. He spent more and more time working and making business travels. 
Linda spent her time entertained by Austin. Katie took care of the children and ran the household.

12. Svend leaves the family. 
One day Svend came home and asked Katie if she could send Linda into his home-office. When Linda entered, 
Svend told her that he had bought an apartment where he was going to live alone. He would provide for her and 
their children, but he no longer loved Linda and wanted adventure. There was however no reason to start a 
divorce. She could stay as his wife on paper. 

Linda cried. He had loved Svend regardless of his brutal act during lovemaking. He had rescued her from Bill�s 
bar and a life in the gutter. She started to drink and did not want to see Austin, when he called. One afternoon 
however he turned up at her home, and they had sex after she told Katie to take the children on at shopping 
trip. When he told her, that he also was tired of her, she gave him money for a new watch. 

Katie continued to drink all afternoon often sleeping the whole morning away. Several time she had blackout 
lasting days. 

Svend arranged for pool-parties at his new flat. Many young girls participated. He used the parties as recruiting 
sessions for the website. Arnold joined him regardless of their controversies and they enjoyed themselves. 

Occasionally he went to his old house and took his children out for a drive. However, he was careful avoiding 
Linda. Svend loved his new life. Linda did cost him money, but she had after all given birth to his children and 
without talking to her, he did not have to feel sorry for her. All his contacts and arrangement regarding finances 
and the children went trough Katie. 

One day, Linda decided that her drinking had to stop. She called Katie and told her that she and the children 
would leave for her parent�s home and she would phone Svend in order to stop further money transactions. 

Katie became furious. �Do you know what Svend�s money is doing for the rest of the family? We are all 
depended of his money. Think about your own parents, my children and your cousin. What are they going to 
live of?� 

�They would have to get a job.� Linda was firm. 

Katie became so angry, that she left for the rest of the day.

13. Austin and Katie 
A week later, Austin came by late in the evening. He was concerned. �I have heard, what you are about to move 
to your parents. What about my job? I guard this neighbourhood and you family are the one, which pays me 
most. If you move, the rest of the families can not afford the price my firm wants.� 

�I know, but I need to get away from here. I am worn down by this house, my sister etc. I need a fresh start.� 

Katie came in the room with something to drink. �I would not disturb you. I am going to put the children to bed. 
Enjoy.� 

Linda and Austin sat down and took a drink. I had been a long day with practical things to do. She had talked 
with Svend, and he was concerned about the education of the children. There was no school on the Island and 
he was afraid that they would not learn the skills necessary to live in a modern world. Linda took it as an insult 
because she could not read and became angry. The conversion stopped when they started to shout at each 
other. 

Linda felt so tired and she told Austin that it was time for him to leave because she needed to go to sleep. Just 
as she had said her sentence, she dropped her cup and fell back in her chair. 

Katie came into the living room. �Is she asleep?� 

�Yes, she went out cold.� 

Then Katie and Austin carried her out to his car, placing her in the back seat with a bottle of whiskey in her 
hand. 

�Go over to Tom and take him with you. Do not mention that I am involved.� 

Austin left with the headlights of the car shut off.

14. Murder 
Svend had partied all day and he was going tired to bed. Arnold -also present -said that he was going to clean 
up and sleep in the guest room downstairs. Svend was still concerned with Linda decision of moving out to the 
Island. 

Around midnight Svend slept. Downstairs Arnold had not gone to bed. He was looking out of the window. Svend 
had been a pain in the ass for the company for a long time. His stubbornness regarding the use of Java in a 
world where other technologies would out perform Java in a matter of time had made Arnold decide that it was 
time for Svend to leave the company. In order to prevent Svend taking the customers with him, he must die. 

When he saw Austin�s car he went to the door. 

Half an hour earlier, Tom had opened the door. To his surprise Austin and one of his colleagues stood outside. 
�Svend had mistreated Linda and we are now going to visit him. If we cannot convince him to continue providing 
for Linda, your wife too would be out of job. Because you know Svend, we would like for you to come with us.� 

Tom agreed reluctant. He knew Austin and had tried to avoid him in the past. Austin meant trouble. When he 
entered, he saw Linda with the whiskey bottle. �It was her idea, but I think that we should wait to wake her, 
when I have talked to Svend first. She needs it because of his treatment of her.� Then they all drew to Svend�s 
flat. 

Arnold opened for Austin and his pal. With lowered voice, Arnold told Austin that Svend slept on the first floor. 
Austin went up the stairs with Arnold behind him. Austin took a ski mask on. 

Svend woke by the noise. A man with a gun wearing a ski mask stood by his bed. �What???� The man shot him 
once in his stomach. With disbelief, Svend sat up in the bed. A large red spot broadened on his T-shirt. He 
wanted to get up and fight the man, but he could not feel his legs. The man aimed again. He saw Arnold at the 
door. Now he understood. �NO!!!�. 

Down in the alley Tom stood guard. He was nervous. Suddenly he heard a gunshot followed by another. Then 
he ran. 

Austin and his friend still wearing a ski mask ran down the stairs. On the way out Austin hit Arnold in the face 
just so Arnold would be in the clear. Then they ran to the car and left the scene. 

Arnold waited a few minutes so the car could get away without anyone noticing the registration numbers and 
ran to the street shouting �Murder!�. 

When some people approached him, he said: �My friend is shot. That bitch murdered her.� 

Arnold was careful not to show how happy he was. Now he could run the company as he like. Regardless, who 
Svend�s heir would become, they did not know much about the business and what it dealt in. 

It was almost morning, when a taxi parked just outside Linda�s house. Two unknown men in town, which paid 
him good so he could drive their drunken girl friend home, had stopped the cab driver. He woke her when they 
arrived and a confused Linda stepped out. She greeted one of her neighbours, who was out collecting the 
newspaper and went into bed. She could not remember being outside her home and thought, that it was a 
dream.

15. Chaos at the funeral 
At noon the next day, the doorbell rang. Katie went to the door. She called Linda and said that the police would 
like to speak with her. Receiving them in the living room, she told them to sit down. Then they told her, that 
Svend had died in a shooting. Linda broke completely down. They had to call a doctor so she could be given 
something to relax on. 

Katie got Ann�s -the mother in law -phone number from Linda and called her in Netherland. 

When Ann received the fatal phone call, she was in shock. After a while, she got angry. Her little innocent son 
had died. He was her only child. Her first husband died in a traffic accident, when the boy was four. She raised 
him by her self. He was always so polite and gentle. Every day he offered to wash the dices and rub her feet 
after work. 

Years later, she met a new man. Svend liked him from the very beginning and he grew up in harmony. When he 
got his own flat, she continued to visit him and advise him how to maintain a proper home. Oddly enough, he 
did not get a girl friend. Perhaps he was too busy with his work. He became a computer programmer 
specialising in something as odd as the internet. First, she did not understand the concept, but when he to her 
disappointment moved to the other side of the world; she kept in touch with him by email. 

She had been surprised when his mails suddenly mentioned a girl with the name of Linda. Almost 10 years 
younger than Svend, she thought that he was just having a girlfriend to screw. 

When she first saw Linda, her first impression seemed to be right, but Svend had surprised her by marrying the 
girl before she could have a serious talk with him. And she did not even cook! Her son would starve at some 
point. That was sure. 

To her surprise, Linda had given her two grandchildren. However, Ann got upset, when Svend had emailed her 
that her sister was hired to look after them. What kind of woman could not look after her own children? Ann 
remembered that she easily could make it, when she was alone with Svend. Linda did not have her respect. 

What about the grandchildren? Would they vanish, if Svend could not support them longer? She was shocked, 
when she learned that Linda either could read or calculate. 

Ann took the first plane to Manila with her husband. Katie greeted them at the airport. She became on good 
terms with Ann at once. They drove to the hospital where Tom -her husband -had driven Linda. Still drugged 
by the medicine the doctor had given her, Linda remained crushed then Ann saw her son. Linda could make her 
self see Svend. 

Later they drove to the undertaker, where Katie and Ann decided on all the small things, which had with the 
funeral to do. They finally dropped Ann and her husband of at their hotel. 

By accident, they ran in to Arnold at the hotel. He had seen them on pictures at Svend�s office and offered to 
dine with them. Asked about whether Svend was happy at the end, Arnold told of Svend�s marriage going 
wrong due to Linda affair with some security guard. 

This upsetted Ann further and the day before the funeral she went to the police station where she asked for the 
police report. When she was told that they had not had the time to write it, she paid 500$ to get it done. 

The funeral went without any special remarks and Ann left for Netherland. Linda decided to send her son to her 
parents, while her daughter remained in Manila at her sister�s place because she attended school. She was 
completely broken and spent her entire day alone crying and morning.

16. A mother in law on a rampage. 
Back in Netherland Ann read the police report. Something was wrong. No money was stolen. Why did they kill 
her son? No signs of a fight were found, so they did not kill him because he resisted. He was murdered in his 
bed. 

Her son to her knowledge had a respectable job in the society. A solid citizen! Who could benefit from killing 
him? Then she understood. Linda wanted his money. If Linda divorced Svend, she would not get any money 
due to the law out there, but if Svend died, she would be his heir. 

She had to prevent it. With Linda little knowledge of finance, she would had spent the money in a short time and 
her grandchildren would be lost. 

She called Linda and told her that she felt so sorry for her and would like to come out there and support her 
during the difficult times. Linda accepted. 

Ann took Katie�s place in Linda�s house. She got to know her grandchild and took her to school every day for 2 
weeks. She also tried to find out where the other grandchild was, but she got only vague answers. Suddenly 
she did not return one afternoon. Linda became worried and called her sister. Her sister contacted the police 
which found out that Ann had left the country with her grandchild. 

Linda called Ann, which told her that her child would live in Netherland together with Ann, who would provide for 
her. Linda cried. She left the home and went to Austin�s place. He was not at home, and it was clear that he had 
moved without leaving an address. 

Then she stayed at her sister�s place for some days. Linda�s house was sold. She had to because she no 
longer got money from Svend�s firm. She called Arnold. He told her, that she was not legally married to Svend. 
In fact, she never had, because she only was 17, when he took her to a priest. The money would follow the 
children. Now Linda was totally in despair. She went back to Bill�s bar working with cleaning and selling drinks 
at the bar. 25 of age, she was not too old to entertain the customers. 

Back in the Netherland, Ann thought of how to bring Linda to justice. If she returned to Manila, she was at risk of 
being arrested for kidnapping. But if Linda went to jail, the court would appoint her in charge of the children and 
then the problem would be solved. 

She called Katie in a try to find out it she knew something. First Katie was afraid to talk to Ann, but then she 
realized that she could benefit economically from her friendship of Ann regardless if it would cost her sister her 
life. She was disappointed when she found out that Linda would not get any money. She told Ann where to find 
the last grandchild and she even offered to send the child if her family could sell the child for the normal price of 
a person in Manila -200$. 

Ann agreed and 14 days later, she welcomed her last grandchild in the airport. Only one thing remained. 
Getting Linda off the street so she could not convince the police to make an international arrest order for 
kidnapping towards Ann.

17. Paying for evidence. 
Katie was satisfied with the 200$, her husband Tom worried her. He had remorse about the night where Svend 
died. What if he told the wrong people? He did of course not know that she knew about Austin. Katie had been 
depended of the moneyflow from Svend to Linda. Her family all had received money in some way from Svend 
direct or indirect. 

She called Arnold. First, he would not talk to her but when they started to talk, he understood her trouble. 
However, the company could not hire her entire family as employee. It would be to obvious, if the police started 
to dig. 

But if Ann got custody of the children, she would manage Svend�s part of the profit of the company how she 
liked. Katie talked with her husband, who broke and confessed of his knowledge of the event from the night. 
Then she called Ann and told her that she to her shock had discovered that Linda was in the same street where 
Svend�s flat laid when he was murdered. If Ann would let the children visit her family from time to time and 
provide a little money also, she would help Ann to bring Linda to justice. 

When Ann agreed, Katie called the police and told them that she had a witness, whom for amnesty could 
explain the events of the night. The police agreed and Tom told them his story. 

Austin and his friend were arrested and both received 40 years in jail. Arnold had secretly met with Austin and 
told him that he would pay for extra services during Austin�s jailtime, if he remained quiet about Arnold�s part in 
the crime. Austin kept his promise. He could not gain anything with Arnold in jail. 

The police wanted to close the case of Svend�s murder, but Ann was not satisfied. She paid more than 50.000$ 
for witnesses and extra petrol, and computers to the police. All the nice money for the underpaid staff at the 
police made them do an extra effort. 

Finally, with almost all members of Linda�s family on the witness-list for the prosecution, the police made an 
arrest warrant on Linda.

18. Arrest and conviction 
One morning in Bill�s bar the police entered and arrested Linda. She was confused and did not understand the 
charge. She had been down in the gutter for months, because her mother in law had the children. 

The police accused her of planning the murder of her husband with the purpose of getting his money. Linda was 
in shock to learn that Austin had committed the murder. However, she was afraid and lied about her being at 
her own house on this night. 

Her lawyer had just left law school. He was eager to show to the world how tuff a lawyer he had become. 
Therefore, he told her to say nothing and deny anything. What he did not tell her was that his only two previous 
cases were lost. 

In the courtroom, her family surprised her by testifying against her. Tom�s testimony was very damaging placing 
her next to the murder scene. Her former neighbour could testify that she arrived home by taxi, when she 
claimed to be at home. The police had tried to locate the cab driver and he had been found dead killed by 
someone, who wanted his money. A very normal thing occurring almost every day in Manila, so it was not 
suspicious. 

Arnold told the court how Svend had complained of his marriage. Even Bill came and told what kind of job Linda 
had before she met Svend. No witness stepped forward in defence of her. 

In his office, the Judge sat and thought about what kind of punishment she should receive. Normally planning 
and killing a husband would mean death penalty. But something about this case stank. Even inside his court 
building the rumour about the mother in law and her financial aid to the police and the family of the accused had 
reach him. 

So much money in Manila meant that someone had bought a statement. He could however not pinpoint where 
foul play in this case was. He had to convict her to the death. Suddenly it struck him. She was not his wife. She 
was not a grown up woman, when she married him according the law in this country. There was the solution, 
now he could avoid the death sentence. She had no real motive because she was not his heir. Perhaps time 
would bring the truth to the surface. Until it manifested it self, she would be safe in prison. 

Linda had her head on the desk while she waited for the judgement. All the damaging statement had made her 
lost her hope of an acquittal. She noticed that her mother in law also was in the courtroom. With Linda 
imprisoned it was safe for Ann to be in the country. The judge came in and read the verdict. 

�Linda Schmidt. You have been found guilty of planning the murder of Svend Schimdt. For this crime, you are 
sentenced to 40 years in prison without parole. The court is adjourned.� 

The lawyer said �Goodbye� and left in a hurry.

19. A final humiliation 
An officer took her to a holding cell, where she had to wait for the car to her new home for the next 40 year. 

While she was waiting, Ann came to her cell with a couple of strangers. It turned out to be a Dutch film crew.
She had been too worn out to notice them inside the courtroom. While they were filming, Ann talked to her.
�You took my son so now I have your children�
Linda was speechless. Her mind could not understand the full consequences of the verdict so her only answer


was �Take good care of them.�
�I would send you some of their drawings every reminding you what you would miss in the years to come, so


you can learn how you have wasted your life. You had always had every chance in life but you had choices had
made you spill it. You would be an old lady before they let you out and I would never have to see you anymore.�
She gave her an envelope with several drawings and left the crying woman.
Outside with the cameras turned off, she met with Katie and assured her that she would continue to provide for


Linda�s parents so the children could visit them, when they were older.

20. Ending fine -everything fine? 
What became of all the people after the conviction was pronounced? Let us have a look: 

Linda�s children are now living in Netherland at Ann�s house, where they get an education, which would have
not been possible in Manila. It remains unclear what kind of impression of their mother Ann would give them.
Ann continues to send money to Katie and Linda�s parents. She also remains in touch with Arnold, but she had


still not any knowledge about what kind of business, she and Arnold controls. To this day, she regards the


reputation of her sons business to a respectable one.
Katie�s husband is now working again in a new job, because his conscience had been cleared by his testimony
in court.


Linda lawyer would perhaps win one of his cases one fine day. After 20 lost cases, he is still hoping.
The Dutch film crew made a fine documentary, which were exported to several countries.
Ib Colding returned to Denmark after his world tour to find the windows in his house smashed once more.
Austin remains in prison where he enjoys life due to the extra money from Arnold.
Bill continues to run his bar. He ended up marrying Samantha.
Linda had to settle when she entered the prison and adjust to the fact that she was going to live there for the


next 40 years. Soon she joined classes in order to learn how to read and write. Perhaps one day she could 
write to her children and explain them how she saw the story. She would be 68 years old, if she lives to the day 
where her prison time is over. Ironically, she regards her life to be better than it would be at Bill�s bar.
