A special report for the Women�s News Service

&nbsp;

WOMEN DISCOVER A BASIC TRUTH ABOUT MEN������� AND TURN IT INTO A HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL
BUSINESS

&nbsp;

For immediate release

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

By Aaron Oliver

&nbsp;

Based in Colorado,
ODI is the largest and most successful business of its type.

&nbsp;

The founders set it up seven years ago as a membership
organization, with annual dues and a variety of products and services available
for purchase -- and it stole a page from Tupperware and Mary Kay by staging
most of its events in a member�s home.

&nbsp;

Of course, there are also some day-long seminars in various
cities around the country and a series of practical workshops that last
anywhere from half a day to a week; the most advanced take place at the
company�s mountain resort headquarters in Colorado.� And ODI�s staff
members offer personal counseling sessions and on-site training for those who
wish it.

&nbsp;

How did the company become so successful in such a short
period of time?

&nbsp;

Simple.

&nbsp;

The founders recognized a basic truth about men and women.

&nbsp;

�Men think they run the world,� says Donna McCardle, one of the three founders, �but we discovered
years ago there was a way for us to run the men!�

&nbsp;

How?

&nbsp;

By controlling their orgasms.

&nbsp;

The members of Orgasm Denial, Inc. (ODI) are almost equally
divided between men and women.� The men
pay three times as much in dues and aren�t allowed to participate in the
seminars or workshops except as guinea pigs.

&nbsp;

The company�s day-long introductory seminar is intended
primarily for women curious about orgasm denial and its power, women who have
probably fantasized about controlling their husbands and lovers but never
realized how simple it could be.

&nbsp;

The seminar begins with each of the three founders telling
her story � years of sexual frustration followed by discovering what can happen
when they take charge of their lover�s orgasm.

&nbsp;

�Everything changed,� says Marian O�Donnell.� �My husband went from �wham bam thank you
ma�am� to the most devoted lover you can imagine.� I let him have an orgasm every once in awhile,
but he never knows when � and the longer I keep him frustrated, the more he
tries to please me.� It�s wonderful!�

&nbsp;

You can almost feel the buzz in the audience as the founders
speak.� The women can hardly wait to buy
some of the products on display and get home to use them on their husbands or
lovers -- but that�s when the founders warn them to be careful.

&nbsp;

�Look,� says Eleanor Spaeth, the
third founder, �some men aren�t really ready for this.� You might have to trick them into it the
first few times -- and we can show you how.�
Then there are those who must be dealt with more severely -- and we can
show you how to do that as well.

&nbsp;

�That�s why we have the introductory workshops,� she goes
on.

&nbsp;

�Some of them are devoted to the philosophy of orgasm denial
and to the soft skills required to lure your lovers into your clutches.

&nbsp;

�But some of them are devoted to practicalities.� What do you actually do to a man to keep him aroused?�
What sex toys should you use � and how do you use them most
effectively?� What rules do you
establish?� How often do you let him have an orgasm?� What about monogamy � does it make sense any
more?� Why should you confine yourself to
a single lover?� And what does that mean
for your current husband or lover �� should you loan him out to other women?

&nbsp;

�In other words, there are a lot of things to think about.�

&nbsp;

Each of the introductory workshops lasts for a full day and is
restricted to women participants except for the one or two men selected at
random from the company�s membership roster who are used as guinea pigs while
the instructors demonstrate various sex toys, positions and techniques.� The list of potential volunteers is lengthy.

&nbsp;

But the more advanced workshops last for many days and are designed
for women who bring their lovers with them for intensive training and experimentation.� Part of the time the couples work in small
groups, each woman spending time experimenting on each of the men in
attendance, and part of the time men and women pair off in private rooms to explore
the techniques they�ve learned.� By the
time the workshop is over, each woman will have spent private time with each man,
and none of the men have any say about who spends time with them or what
they�re told to do.

&nbsp;

In recent months, ODI has also begun experimenting with
introductory workshops for men, teaching them how to satisfy the woman or the
women in their lives.� Enrollment demand
is high, but the company keeps each workshop to no more than seven men, who pay
a stiff price to participate.� The
workshops typically last from 6 p.m.
Friday until 6 a.m. Monday.� Needless to say, none of the men has an
orgasm during that 60-hour period, but the staff members � usually three to
five women � have as many as they wish.

&nbsp;

What�s next for the company?

&nbsp;

Donna McCardle says �we�re going
into the movie business � a very high quality line of educational videos for
men and women alike.�� She promises initial
videos will be available by the first of the year.

&nbsp;

One of the many contract templates used by ODI members appears below,
and additional information about ODI can be found on its web site.
