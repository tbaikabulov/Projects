Synopsis: A man is inducted into the world of female domination. His experience of one day at the hands of a Mistress removes all doubt in his mind about his own sense of worth. he gives himself utterly to her, and she takes him completely.Night has drawn in and the moon casts a silvery glow on the garden. As I sit
  here naked at the table, I am trying to come to terms with what has happened
  today. I concentrate on my task. 
My left arm is firmly emplaced within the boot; I splay my hand inside the
  foot to press against the leather, as my right pushes down with the soft cloth;
  describing firm circles across the smooth skin. The tang of polish mingles
  with the aroma of my mistress; I stop for a millisecond and breathe in deeply
  through my nose, drawing my head up as I do so, feeling enveloped with the
  heady blend of supple leather and her delicate perfume. I smile to myself as
  I continue with my work. No, not work, more an act of worship, of devotion;
  my love for her is expressed in the orbits my fingers continually make through
  the cloth, working the polish in and over. I feel a physical sensation in my
  stomach and my cheeks tingle, I almost chuckle as I realize the reaction coming
  over me is pride, stopping again, I admire the shine developing through the
  toe of the boot. 
A bead of sweat drops from my forehead onto the shiny leather, the moisture
  balls up, wax repelling it into a semi-sphere. Satisfaction and excitement
  flow though me, I feel sure she will be pleased with what I have done. I close
  my eyes again and recall hearing the steady click clack of her heels tapping
  across the wooden floor to where I had lain. The recollection swells me, and
  I feel the warmth engorging my manhood as I cherish the recent memory of her
  striding in her boots across the room to my splayed form. I reach down and
  begin stroking myself as I recall that by the time she had returned, my arms
  had long since stopped burning. She had deftly and expertly tied my left wrist
  to her dining table and the right to the radiator. My legs had been fixed by
  the ankles to the bottom of the table and the leg of her settee. I was completely
  naked and had felt scared; scared and vulnerable. I continued to massage myself
  with long deliberate strokes as I remembered how I got to be here. 
It had all began simply enough, a dropped fork in Pizza Hut, (Pizza Hut!,
  no-one had told me that was where you were selected by Goddesses for their
  amusement, I had always imagined it would be a bar or a nightclub or somewhere
  like that). I picked up her fork and she took it and looked discerningly. 
�Glad to see you know your place'. 
A tingle like electricity had gone through my body, and I'm sure I had glowed
  crimson. Come to think of it, it wasn't what she said, it was the way that
  she had said it, and how she held my gaze, I had felt myself being devoured.
  However, that was; how long was it? 13 days, 13 long days ago, 13 days. Since
  then I had seen her twice, this was the third time and I was on a steep learning
  curve. The previous encounter had been a flurry of words and exchange of positions,
  3 hours in a coffee shop had disappeared in an instant. She had been warm and
  languid in her responses, amused at my naivet&eacute; but absolute in her authority.
  I had never been able to say how I felt about being dominated before. She had
  been at pains to ensure I was clear about safe words and immersement in scenes.
  I listened and was absorbed. I felt like a fish being reeled in, and I liked
  it. I liked it a lot. 
I had arrived at her house half an hour before we were due to meet. The sky
  was a dazzling blue, and the sun was bright and high, I'm sure if I had tried
  hard, I would have been able to hear larks or some such summer bird. I hadn't
  wanted to be late, so had waited in my car just a few houses down. At 3 O'clock
  sharp, I knocked on the door, I could feel my palms sweating, my heart was
  hammering inside my chest, and I swear I could hear it beating. I just felt
  so overwhelmed that she had allowed me to enter her world. I was intoxicated
  just by the thought of being near her. 
She opened the door and graced me with a smile; I'm not an effeminate man,
  but I honestly felt like I was going to faint, all lightheaded and buzzing. 
�Come in, come in'. 
She motioned me in with her hand; she was wearing cream jodhpurs with a pair
  of dusty riding boots and an old rugby top. She closed the door behind me and
  led me into the large room on the right. It was lit by bright sunshine and
  had two settees with a large dining table and chairs at one end. A magnificent
  full length mirror stood to oneside of the largest settee. Almost immediately,
  my attention was drawn to a beautiful collection of boots reflected in the
  mirror. They were lined up two deep alongside the far wall. Black, red, cream
  and even green; she had ankle and knee high boots, chunky heels and stilettos.
  I let out a low moan crossed with a sigh. She looked at me with a puzzled expression
  and then smiled. 
�Ahh, you're a retifillic; why am I not surprised'. 
I honestly didn't know what she was talking about. My expression must have
  told her as much. 
�The boots' she gestured curtly. 
�Oh' I lamely replied as it dawned on me that retifism must be boot worship. 
�Yes that's me', I grinned nervously. 
I stood there half in the doorway, the silence settling around me like a shroud. 
I desperately wanted to, I don't know, impress her perhaps, and make her see
  that I was a genuine devotee, that I had discernment. Whatever it was, I made
  a mistake and started an avalanche that ended with me on the floor. This was
  the beginning of my first lesson. 
I commented how I much preferred the shiny black stilettoed knee high boots
  she had on display to the dirty old things she was wearing. Her expression
  changed, I wasn't quite sure to what, and it was like the clouds had suddenly
  covered up the sun in this corner of the room. I stumbled on desperately trying
  to fill the silence she had left. 
�I love boots'. 
�Especially shiny ones, black best of all' my voice trailed off. 
Her face had definitely changed, that cloud had just become a hammerhead anvil
  divining a storm. She looked through me. I tried to continue. Stammering; 
�I just, d-d-don't f-f-find'. 
�Don't find what', her crisp voice cut right across me. 
�I- I- I' stammered. 
�Finish what you were going to say'. Her words were deliberate and icy, her
  impatience was obvious. 
�I just don't like dirty boots, and certainly not flat boots' 
The words all arrived at once, tumbling over each other in my haste to get
  them out, I finished with a lame; 
�Sorry'. 
�Sorry', she spat. 
She paused and hurled the word out again as her hand went up, back, and down,
  hurtling across the void between us and connected with my cheek. It was like
  a matrix slomo moment; I saw the slap. I felt the slap, and then I saw my head
  twist and my body pivot round and down to the floor. I could hear myself thinking
  she slapped me so hard I'm hitting the floor, she hit me, she is wonderful,
  I love her; the sharp pain is fantastic, I was savoring it as my shoulder and
  then my head hit the floor. I tried to rise up on to my elbows, but somehow
  she had got down to my level and quickly slapped me on the other cheek knocking
  me back down. I opened my mouth to speak, I didn't even know what I was going
  to say, (I now know that nothing was what I should have done). Even as I had
  begun to open my mouth, she had clenched her fist, drawn it back and brought
  it around to punch me just behind my left ear. The sting of it coursed through
  my body and I collapsed. As I did so, she placed one knee on my chest and bent
  down so her face was less than a hand span away from mine. Her voice was cold,
  hard, and completely full of control. The time between me uttering my naive
  opinion and feeling the weight of her body on mine must have been less than
  a minute. I had never ever felt so alive. 
�You are a worthless, piece, of, shit'. 
Her scorn was absolute. She looked straight at me as she said; 
�You have no right to utter anything about anything. You have a choice. Right
  now, you can get up and walk out, or you can stay and take what you deserve.
  There is no other option.' 
With that, she got up and looked down at me. I returned her look, but averted
  my gaze from her eyes, starting from the tops of her dirty riding boots through
  her cream jodhpurs to her soiled sweatshirt. I stopped at her neck line and
  I tried to say sorry, but all that came out was a sibilant mumble. She gazed
  down with utter contempt and waved behind her. 
�The door is that way'. 
A horrified �no, no' was all I could manage. I swear I saw a smile flit across
  her face as she turned, but just as quick, it was gone, and her face became
  a mask of severity. 
�You will learn your place'. 
Then she turned and walked back out into the hall. 
I really didn't know what to do. I had felt lost, rejected, but excited at
  the same time; I went up on my elbows and wondered if I should have followed
  her when I heard the sound of her returning footsteps. She entered carrying
  a large bucket with what looked like a riding crop poking out of the top. Sitting
  down on the settee, she placed the bucket beside her. 
�Come here' she commanded. 
I went to raise myself up, she sighed. 
�Unless I say otherwise you will crawl on all fours in my presence'. 
I swallowed and nodded, she sighed again. 
�You will acknowledge all commands from me with a �yes mistress''. 
�Yes mistress', I quietly replied and crawled over to her. 
She gazed down. 
�Let me make this absolutely clear to you, if you stay you will be mine; I
  will treat you as I see fit, and we will begin with your admonishment.' 
�Yes mistress' I said again, eagerly this time. 
�Good' she replied briskly. 
�Take you clothes off and lie down over there', she motioned behind me to
  the dining table. 
I quickly disrobed and heard her softly sniggered as I almost fell over getting
  my last sock off. She carried the bucket over and kicked my legs and arms into
  the position she wanted. Saying nothing, she had draped soft cotton ropes on
  my limbs. Kneeling down once more she silently and almost reverently tied the
  ropes around my arms and ankles, quietly asking me if I was comfortable and
  able to move at all (I was and I couldn't). I felt perplexed, didn't know what
  to say, she was almost caressing my arm as she had spoken to me. I thought
  maybe the severe disciplinarian who had chastised me so vigorously was just
  a feint, that she was actually just another woman who wanted to be soft and
  gentle. That I had made a mistake. But she was tying me up, she was in control,
  she was dictating everything that happened. I felt confused; I wondered if
  I was forgiven, and the punishment would just be to be left tied here. Then
  I realized it was not me that pleased her, but the act of tying. There was
  a distinct ritualistic slant to her devotions. I was part of, but completely
  separate to her consideration. I could just feel the edges of the sublime purity
  in the perfect moment she appeared to be having. She completed the last knot
  and stood up surveying her work, a gentle smile played on her face. 
�Now we can begin' she murmured softly and moved up to my head. I smiled and
  felt good in the warmth in her voice. This abruptly changed when she looked
  down at me. 
�Turn your face to look at my boots' she commanded. 
I twisted over to look at the flat riding boots. The black leather dull with
  a coating of dust towered upwards. A thin strip of leather ran vertically the
  length of the boot; it was tightened by a buckle at the top and a retaining
  D-ring at the heel. 
She took a step or two backwards, swiveled a chair round and sat on it the
  wrong way. Leaning over the back of the chair, she cradled her long leg around
  so the travel stained boot lay on my chest. 
�You may now demonstrate what little worth you have' she instructed. 
�Yes mistress' I replied. 
�What are these boots to you worm'. 
�They are the centre of my existence mistress'. 
She curtly nodded, almost displeased that I had said something right. 
�Clean them', she pushed the boot into my face. 
I moved my head over and reached out with my tongue, I felt the stiffness
  of the leather around the toe and was surprised at its smoothness. The dust
  was actually gritty in my mouth and left a sour acrid aftertaste. I could feel
  my saliva drying up but I continued moving my tongue and lips as much as I
  could. As I did so, she slowly rotated her boot allowing access; shuffling
  the seat closer meant I could continue up the side of her boot. She abruptly
  grabbed hold of my hair and I winced as she yanked it back and forth wiping
  the boot dry. She let go, dropping my head back to the floor and nodded at
  me to continue. I ran my tongue over the D-ring and sensed its coldness against
  the warmth of the leather; a metallic tang accompanied its chill feel. I tasted
  the soapiness of the polish as I worked my way up the side. She moved her boot
  round again and the inside calf was exposed to my licking; I could barely manage
  to accommodate any moisture at all, and tried dragging my tongue across my
  teeth to induce some. I then realized there was a zip and ran my tongue up
  it, the rough texture rasped alongside my lips as I worked my dry mouth on
  to the top of her boot, I tried to suck the leather to induce some saliva in
  my mouth to complete my task. However, it was no good. 
�Mistress I'm dry' I pleaded. 
She sighed, removed her leg, and stood up swinging the chair behind her as
  she did so. She went to the bucket, picked up the crop then strode over to
  my prostrate body and knelt down on my chest. Slowly increasing her weight
  until the pressure pushed all the air out of my lungs, I gasped and she had
  beatifically smiled again. She took her knee off my chest and knelt down below
  my left arm. 
�You have so much to learn my darling'. 
Her hand reached out and I winced in anticipation, but it was a soft caress
  that met my face. 
�When you are good, you are rewarded and when you are bad�' she left it unsaid
  and just scanned my body up and down as she straightened up. 
I pleaded with her. 
�Please, I'll try harder, please.' 
Bending down she had sniffed hard and spat on my face, reflexively I shut
  my eyes, her spit splattered across my forehead and my eyelids, the phlegm
  began running down my cheek. 
�You really are pathetic, I should just cut you loose and not bother with
  you', the sneer in her voice was far far worse than the words. 
�No mistress' I whined softy and then; 
�Please mistress' again. 
�Clean them' she said and lifted the toe of her boot to my mouth. 
I tried to lift my head and reach my tongue out to lick the sole of her boot.
  My lips were cracked and my tongue was dry, I attempted to work some saliva
  up to wet the toe, but it was all gone, I knew I didn't dare risk saying anything,
  I whined softly. She pulled her boot back slightly, I moved my head up again,
  it was excruciating, I barely met the tip of her boot, my tongue just caressed
  the leather when she pulled it away again. For a moment, I thought she was
  going to kick me in the face, a cold shiver ran over me and my nipples became
  hard as Goosebumps contracted across my body. 
�Are you too dry my pet?' there was a smile to her voice. 
I nodded vigorously, she leant down again and spat into my mouth, for some
  reason this surprised me and I nearly choked and then enjoyed savoring the
  sensation that she had spat into my mouth, I was still hers. I existed because
  she willed it. She repeated the maneuver and I felt myself swell and groaned
  slightly. She looked back at my stiffening cock. 
�Pay attention worm', flicking the crop at my member as she did so. 
It caught the tip and I winced in reply. 
�You will learn' she clearly enunciated. 
�These boots will be the entire focus of your being'. 
I nodded. She stepped over my arm and stood directly over me placing a booted
  foot on my neck and chin. 
�Understand that every stroke of my crop and sting of its kiss is directly
  related to the lack of reverence you have shown'. 
�Yes mistress' I replied. 
�Good' she said and moved to a kneeling position on my chest. 
�All that happens now is deserved' and she brought the crop down hard on my
  left arm, just inside the elbow. 
I screamed and tried to rise up, she simultaneously slapped me around my face
  twice, fore and back hand, then pressed down harder continuing with her administering
  with her crop; doing the same to the right and the again to left, and back
  again each time leaving a red mark in a different place. Each and every stroke
  of her hand brought an intense flash of pain followed by a brief spell of warm
  buzzing sting mixed with real sexual heat. She was deliberately hesitating
  a second between each caress of the crop, accentuating the sensations building
  up on my arms. She was an artist creating an image with the canvas of my body.
  As she brought the crop down, she said : 
�You, are, nothing,' 
�You, have, no, opinions,' 
�My, word, is, all'. 
�My, word, is, all', she had then stood up, smiling as she did so. 
15 welts were raised on my arms, I stifled a sob, the pain had gone through
  so many different changes, it was like my life had been monochrome and suddenly
  I had Technicolor. A sharp sting, a dull ache and a tingling (please don't
  go holding onto kind of) throb, all rolled into one, and washed over and around
  me. I could feel the emotion roll over and around me; the muffled sobs were
  not because of the pain, but the joy I felt. I was incredibly hard, I was carrying
  her marks, she had taken me completely, at least so I thought, later I was
  to realise that this episode was just her breaking me in before I was really,
  truly taken by her. 
Each stinging contact had been underlined with a word, stringing together
  her wonderful pronouncement on my being, I was being reborn, and she had engulfed
  me. She pulled herself back off of my body and lowered her head, her hair gently
  stroking my face and neck as she moved down; the gentleness of her caresses
  accentuated the previous moments of pain. Then an excruciating spasm shot through
  me as she clamped her teeth on my right nipple and bit down hard, I cried out
  in agony; her mouth opened and reclosed around my entire areola drawing the
  flesh up into her mouth, she sucked more in and drew down harshly sinking her
  sharp incisors deep into my breast. She released it and returned to the nipple,
  again causing me to scream, this time she bit even harder. I could actually
  see sparkling lights; flashes of green obscured my vision as she brought herself
  up and once again spat into my face. The spit was tinged with red, and I suddenly
  realized it was my blood; she turned to the left nipple and enclosed that with
  her teeth as well. I waited for the same excruciating pain, but it never came.
  She teased it with her teeth, I visibly relaxed, she obviously felt the relaxation
  of my body because she quickly responded with another clenching. Biting hard
  and drawing more blood, which once more she spat into my face. The second gobbet
  of phlegm joined the first on the bridge of my nose and together they slid
  down my face into my mouth, the coppery taste of blood filled my senses as
  she continued to suck hard on my left breast, biting and worrying it with her
  entire mouth. She pulled herself upwards and looked straight into my face,
  the spasms of pain in my pecs was overwhelming the dull burning on my arms.
  Slowly even that began to fade to a monotonous throb in time with my heart
  beat; I knew then that she was truly an artiste of sadism as she continued
  to gaze into my eyes whilst simultaneously taking hold of my ball sack in her
  left hand and squeezing with the points of her nails. It was quick, hard and
  viscous. I screamed out loud 
�Fuck' 
A tear welled up in my eye and rolled down my cheek as she constricted even
  harder and yanked down on the whole scrotum at the same time pulling out several
  clumps of pubic hair as she did so. A strangled gasp issued from my clenched
  teeth. She smiled broadly. Let go, then immediately slapped my testicles as
  hard as she could. 
Abruptly she got up and once more left the room. I had no idea how long it
  had been since I had knocked on her door, I knew only that it had been someone
  else's life when I had entered her realm. I as a person no longer existed.
  I could feel the warmth of my own blood trickling from each nipple entwined
  with the cold sensation of her saliva cooling on my chest and the dull aching
  sting from the welts on my arm. The sun was still streaming in the room and
  it warmed my legs, my cock had gone from being completely rock hard to soft
  again, I could feel it retracting and shrinking as I lay there. Time passed,
  how long I couldn't say, the sun had moved up my body to just below my nipples,
  I couldn't feel any blood flowing from them and my arms had become a mass of
  dull aching. Then I heard the staccato sound of stilettos, I was confused,
  surely she was wearing riding boots; riding boots that I now knew I had to
  show respect to, to worship as I worshipped her. I lifted my head as the click
  clack of heels drummed their way into the room. I could feel my jaw drop open;
  her jodhpurs were gone she was now wearing a pair of black patent leather boots
  that came up to her knees. The sweatshirt had been replaced with a cream open
  neck silk blouse that reached down to below her waist. I vaguely remembering
  taking in the fact that there appeared to be nothing below the blouse. The
  boots had my total and undivided attention. She was wearing boots that were
  the foundation of most of my fantasies. It seemed karmic, that finally I should
  meet a woman, no, a mistress who not only knew how to command but was wearing
  the very sort of boot that I had only ever dreamt about. 
The sun caught her as she strode into the room, its light caught the leading
  edge of the leather, dazzling and glinting as she moved. She drew closer and
  I had been able to take in more detail; the toes were acutely pointed and the
  four inch stiletto heel was narrow and stainless steel. It stretched down from
  a bulge at the base of the boot to a sharp tapering point. It appeared keen
  enough to cut the air it moved through, the arrow true straightness contrasted
  with the round form of her calf through the leather. The subtle smoothness
  of its form drew my eye round and down it; I could see the seam cutting down
  from the top, criss crossed by the stitching that looped around the ankle.
  As I drank in the appearance of those beautiful boots, I realized I had been
  mistaken about the patent leather. The texture of the shininess betrayed the
  fact that they had been meticulously spit shined by someone. A tremor of jealously
  had gone through me. I put it to the back of my mind as I focused again on
  the vision of her boot clad legs. The light played around the soft shape the
  boot had just under the knee; how I had longed to caress and kiss them. I was
  hard, and could feel myself trembling as I took in the loveliness of those
  boots, the smooth shining leather just begged to be stroked, I imagined rubbing
  my face and cheek against them like a cat. I actually wanted to purr, what
  a wonderful mistress, how could I please her? I desperately wanted to show
  her that I would do anything she wanted. The glossy silkiness of the boots
  completely entranced me. They were an object of worship; I believed they could
  only bring pleasure into my life. I really had absolutely no idea that boots
  such as those could actually be used to inflict massive amounts of pain. That
  had been my second lesson. What brought pleasure and what gave pain was arbitrary,
  my mistress decided how things around me rewarded and punished me. I no longer
  had any part in those decisions, I was only to receive and give as she so deigned. 
As I thought back to those beautiful boots encasing her shapely legs I found
  myself becoming even more aroused. The pale moonlight shone on the riding boots
  I was now polishing. I brought my boot encased arm up to my face and inhaled
  deeply as I pulled harder on myself. The scent of leather spilled into my mouth
  and nostrils. I increased the frequency of the strokes as I remembered what
  she had done only an hour ago. Entering the room like a 1000 fantasies distilled
  into one distinct vision, her sharp heels had played a tattoo as she crossed
  the room to where I had lain. She had straddled me sitting on my chest and
  caressed my face as she said; 
�I'm going to untie you, and you will then finish cleaning my boots'. 
In my fetishtic induced semi-trance, I hadn't even noticed that she had been
  carrying her riding boots by their tops. 
�When I return they will be spotless and as pleasant to look at as these are.
  Do you understand?' 
I nodded as she placed them on the floor. 
�Good. It is so tiresome when I have to underline my requests with sanctions'. 
Her fingers traced the raised welts on my arms and her nail gently caressed
  the outline her riding crop had made earlier. She slid down my chest slightly
  and squeezed my left nipple between her nails, 
�Let's not have a repeat of earlier'. 
A shower of pain sensations went through my nipple as she squeezed even harder,
  my bottom lipped buzzed and I could taste a metallic sensation in my mouth
  as the hurt from previously was reignited. She lightly traced her fingertips
  over my bruised scrotum, I whimpered, and this brought a light smile to her
  lips. She smiled again as I let out another small snivel, gave my nipple another
  hard twist and stood up. I felt the pain catch fire across my chest. She lent
  down and caressed the ropes around my wrists, stroking them gently as she undid
  them. Using quick movements, she released the slipknots and the pressure on
  my arms eased. Swiveling about herself, she did the same for my ankles. She
  picked up all four pieces of soft cotton rope and kissed each as she put them
  into her hand. Turning she went and sat down on the sofa gently depositing
  the ropes in the bucket as she did so. 
I sat up, she looked at me but said nothing, her expression gave little away;
  although I sensed that I should not have moved without permission, but for
  some reason she was letting it go, almost as though something else was on her
  mind. I went onto all fours. She smoothly and deliberately said 
�So you love, black, shiny, high heeled, boots?' 
There was an underlying smile in her voice as she slowly uttered each word.
  I convinced myself it was because she was rewarding me. Her purposeful enunciation
  of each syllable thrilled me. How little I knew her or understood what my true
  position was. I was such a fool, the fact she was smiling was a warning, the
  not punishing me for a minor transgression was a warning with klaxons. She
  had something bigger in mind, something infinitely more humiliating and degrading
  than a slap or welt mark on my arm. Oh how I would learn my third lesson about
  understanding my mistress. I was to judge nothing, no assumptions, and no values.
  I was here only to please her, what I wanted, needed, desired, was completely
  irrelevant to what was happening and what was going to happen. 
She languidly beckoned me over, saying; 
Let's see how much you really love, black, shiny, high heeled, boots, shall
  we?' 
I nodded eagerly, feeling fantastic, like a fat boy who has been locked in
  a cake shop. I wanted to masturbate right there and then. However, some small
  spark of sanity prevented me, some survival instinct kept me low down with
  my hands well away from my cock. I crawled over to her. I had an idiotic smile
  on my face as I gazed at her and her beautiful, shiny encased legs. 
�Glad you're pleased' she murmured. 
The subtly of her sarcasm completely washed over me in my heightened state
  of desire. Reaching back down into the bucket, she pulled out what looked like
  a thin black belt. She held it up and I realized it was a dog leash. In my
  naivety, I wondered what it was for; I had never entertained any fantasies
  of being lead round by a leash. However, as I have already said, what I fantasized
  about and wanted was completely irrelevant. She motioned me forward and placed
  the loop of the choker around my neck. She shifted her position as I came to
  rest at her feet. Her blouse rose up slightly revealing a short black linen
  skirt underneath, she placed one leg over the other, and I felt myself glow
  crimson as I was rewarded with a small flash of white panties glistening under
  the skirt, the smoothness of them suggested silk or satin. I suspect that I
  may have even let out a small moan, but I can't be sure. Such is the intensity
  of the emotion and physical feelings the memories stir up I can only recollect
  the beginning of it in thin wisps. The full on power of the following 20 minutes
  engulfed me. 
She gently commanded me to come closer. I shuffled forward inches away from her
  legs; I could smell perfume and something else. Something that was initially
  indefinable. A sweet musk that aroused me and pulled at a distant memory, I
  breathed in deeply and instantly the recollection flooded back of my first
  encounter with a wet pussy. She was turned on! My mistress was excited! I didn't
  know how to assimilate this new information, nor did I have time as she lifted
  her right leg up slightly from where it was crossed over the left. 
�Kiss it' 
I placed my lips alongside her calf and gave the smooth, shiny, leather a
  slow loving kiss, my tongue describing small circles on the surface. She gave
  a deft flick upwards, reminding me of the choke chain. 
�No no, naughty boy' she mockingly chided me. 
�We always start with the tip'. 
She let the leash out slowly and softly swung the toe of her boot towards
  my mouth; I placed my lips around it and closed my eyes as I French kissed
  her foot. The coldness of the boot combined with the fantastic smoothness and
  its sublime shape engulfed me. I lost control of myself and caressed it ravishingly,
  enjoying the feel of it. I forgot my own self preservation instincts and touched
  myself. One hand held the boot whilst the other reached down and cupped my
  balls. 
A curt �NO!' cut straight across my reverie; I instantly dropped my hand away
  from my sack. She snapped up hard on the choke chain in her left hand, my throat
  closed and momentarily I couldn't breath. The strength in her hands and arms
  was amazing. I flushed, knowing I had disrespected her again, thinking of myself
  ahead of her. She pushed more of the boot into my mouth. 
�Love these boot's' she sneered, and filled my mouth as she pushed the toe
  fully in, it slowly edged into my mouth further stretching my cheeks. She pulled
  her foot out then pushed it in again, even harder this time. Her pace quickened
  as she repeatedly pulled out and kicked in again with a brutal motion. 
�These boots are going to fuck you' 
Only now, when she pulled the boot out, it came out completely. Switching
  position again, she commanded me to lie down beneath her, this time there is
  no softness in voice, no cool languidness, just complete and absolute authority.
  I dropped down as quickly as I could and looked up at her. The sole of her
  left boot was just above my head. She jerked up again with the lead; 
�Suck the heel you pathetic piece of shit' 
She placed the tip of the stainless steel stiletto on my lips; I kissed and
  caressed it with my tongue. The tip slipped inside my mouth as she applied
  pressure on it. The steel was frigidly cold to touch, like an icicle inside
  my mouth. 
�You like these best, don't you'? I knew it was rhetorical, the mocking tone
  made it clear, I said nothing, I was beginning to learn. 
She pushed the heel in further; I started to gag as it touched the back of
  my mouth. She laughed at my choking sounds. 
�As you love them so much, let me fuck you with it' 
She pulled her heel up and then jammed it back down again, rhythmically in
  and out, in and out, dragging on the side of my cheeks and scratching the tender
  flesh. I had an instant of time to recover from the previous thrust before
  the next one was upon me; wave after wave of nausea came over me as I tasted
  the blood inside my mouth from the sharp heel. My tongue could feel the gouges
  it was making on the inside of my cheek. I was a being mouth fucked by her
  stiletto heeled boots! I was engorged, I could actually feel my cock throbbing
  as I lost all sense of time. Finally, she pulled the heel out completely. I
  felt relieved and at the same time deeply disappointed that she had stopped.
  I was swallowed by a longing to have that heel back inside me. I was only truly
  alive when she was giving me life. Every sensation from her administrations
  filled me with vitality, each scrape was a heartbeat, and every tear was a
  breath. As I lay there looking up at her boot encased foot, I swam in the intimate
  details of its being. The warm metallic taste of my own blood filled my mouth
  as my tongue traced across the narrow canyons inside my cheek made by her heel.
  The sole was a warm tan color and had dark patches of wear; I felt aroused
  again at the thought of how much she must have worn these boots to produce
  such coloration. Even as I gazed up that sole, it came crashing down onto my
  face. The heel thrust its way through my lips again and passed my teeth like
  it was coming home. That sole I had so admired was pressed down hard onto my
  face squashing my nose such that I couldn't breathe through it. Dust from the
  floor was ground into my eyelids and forehead as she continued her foot back
  and forth in an arc stubbing out the dirt into my face. 
�Do you still love shiny boots?' she snarled as she pushed down harder and
  harder, my nose felt like it was beginning to swell and I could hear a low
  painful moan interjected with whimpering. I listen to this for a while as she
  rotated the heel inside my mouth before I realized I was the one making the
  sounds. There was an overwhelming sensation of relief as she removed the heel
  once more. Then she quickly resumed, but even harder this time. I began to
  feel more than a little scared, I sensed she was really enjoying my cries,
  and the intensity of what she was doing had made me just a thing. She continued,
  slowly and relentlessly grinding my face and mouth with the sole and heel of
  her boot, she flicked my tonsils with the tip of the steel and once more I
  gagged, this quickly developed into full blown retching and she removed her
  boot and grabbed my hair with one fluid motion twisting my head to one side
  as she did so. 
�Is poor baby alright' she laughed, I nodded and felt drained, an empty husk
  about to blow away. This was what they meant when they spoke of a roller coaster
  of emotions. She patted me on the head and bent forwards slipping off settee
  as she did so and crouched down on her haunches, opening her knees. She uttered
  very softly; 
�Repeat after me' 
�What my mistress likes, I adore'. I managed to croak it back to her. She
  continued, 
�I am not fit to pass any comment on the boots she chooses to wear', once
  more I managed to rasp a subservient echo of her words. She seemed satisfied
  with that and moved forward, crouching down over my face she queened me. Almost
  straight away, I became aware of the deep musk emanating from her pussy. It
  had made the gusset of her silk knickers damp. She rubbed herself lazily against
  my entire face; I was dazed, hurting; sore and absolutely overwhelmed with
  her presence. Quickly the environment around my face became humid and uncomfortably
  hot, I was so turned on, but unable to breath. The delicious musk became everything
  about me, it was my taste, my smell, my vision my own personal heat. It felt
  physical in between my snatched breaths as her pussy slid far enough down for
  me to suck air and expel it again from my lungs. She rapidly increased her
  movements panting as she did so, my ears were caught every now and again but
  I could hear the sounds she was making. Once more my cock stiffened as she
  moved frantically grabbing my head and forcing my face up into her silk knickers
  as she jerked herself to climax. As abruptly as she started, she finished.
  I was disappointed that I hadn't given her real satisfaction; I desperately
  wanted to please her. She paused a while, then stood up again, straightening
  her skirt and blouse as she did so, smoothing them down with her hands. 
Reaching back down she adjusted the choke chain around my neck and took the
  slack up in her hand. She patted her side as you would to a dog, walked over
  to the other settee, and sat down near the full length mirror. I padded over
  on my hands and knees and kneeled down at her feet. My mouth was still sore
  and the numbing pain around my nipples glowed; but I felt myself get erect
  again as I saw her and her reflection in the mirror. Two divine mistresses
  to worship. She smiled and nodded at me, 
�Turn yourself round honey' she purred as she let out all the slack in the
  chain. 
�I really  want you to be able to see what's going to happen', her
  husky voice had the texture of melted chocolate, I knew that such sensuality
  in her tone could only mean that I was about to experience pain, humiliation
  or both. Warmth spread along the length of my cock as I turned on my knees
  and faced the mirror. 
�Assume the position' I wasn't sure what the position  was, my hesitancy
  was reflected in subtle change in her body language, I could see her tensing
  up and felt the chain shift along my back. I quickly guessed at all fours and
  parted my legs, my rear end facing towards her beautiful form. I felt no smack
  of redemption so assumed I had got it right. Holding my position, I decided
  to risk a glance over my shoulder as I awaiting my next command. It came even
  as I did so. 
�Look into the mirror bitch', I watched our reflections as she placed one
  leg either side of mine and pulled me back towards her, levering the choke
  chain to pull my neck up. I shuffled myself quickly backwards to avoid the
  strangulation of the chain. 
�Watch bitch' she growled and slid back onto the settee, she drew her right
  leg back and placed the other over the top and laid the tip of her stiletto
  against the bottom of my spine. I felt a quiver travel down my back bone which
  terminated in an abrupt shake. She laughed and slid the black encased apex
  of the steel heel down a few centimeters more, as the tip grazed the soft skin
  around my rectum, I closed my eyes and clenched involuntarily. 
�Open your fucking eyes and watch bitch', I opened them again and saw her
  press home the heel into the grip of my puckered anus. It quivered as she pushed
  a little harder. The dark rubber of the stiletto point was thrown into relief
  by the whiteness of my skin, it only just parted the entrance to my anus, but
  it felt like someone had shoved fist up there. My rectum puckered again and
  resisted as she pressed vigorously; the pain was excruciating but delicious,
  the opening around my arsehole parted and the sphincter muscles were pushed
  apart as she eased the heel in. The rubber protector at the end of that solid
  steel shaft was swallowed by my passage. It had only gone in less than a quarter
  of an inch when she pulled it back again, supporting her leg with both hands
  as she did so. As she withdrew I was suddenly thrown back to a distant memory
  of being 14 years old and �experimenting' with my slightly older cousin, she
  had tossed me off and slid her pinkie into my anus as I came. It had been the
  most intense orgasm of my adolescence and I had shot all over her arm and most
  of the posters on her wall. She had been most unimpressed and kicked me out
  of her room, thinking back I really wish she had told me to lick it off, because
  I would have gladly done so. 
�Focus on what I am doing to you'; her crystal clear command brought me well
  and truly to the present as I saw the heel slide in further into my arse, the
  brittle coldness of the stiletto was in sharp contrast to the hot stabbing
  pain travel through my gut. I could see and feel more and more of the heel
  being taken in. The stiletto was smooth and cold, but the rubber tip felt hard
  and linear, I could sense every millimeter of its abrupt edges as it scraped
  its way into me. Then like a receding tide she pulled back, then forward again;
  each slow methodical stroke pushed a little further into me. The penultimate
  stroke took the stiletto in all the way to the sole of her beautiful shiny
  boots; she twisted it slightly left and then right. The edge of the rubber
  tip gouged into my insides. She rocked back and forth on the fulcrum of my
  spine, thrusting the heel in and out of my anus. Then with a flourish, she
  pulled it out once more, her eyes locked on mine as I watched it all. 
�Tell me what you see bitch', I tried to form words, but all I managed was
  a big fat tear which ran down my left cheek. She laughed and smirked as she
  pushed the heel in again. 
�Lost the power of speech you pathetic wanker. Not so quick to tell me now
  what you think are you?' She pulled the heel out dropping it down to the floor
  and simultaneously pulled up sharply on the choke chain. 
�When I fucking well tell you to describe what you see, you will fucking do
  it' she accentuated her statement by leaning forward and wrapping the chain
  around her hand, so a series of quick successive jerks made me feel like I
  was going to be garroted. 
�Back again fuckwit' she commanded as she rested her leg on my cheeks. The
  back of her boot felt cold whilst her shaft felt wet and warm on my skin. 
�This time, I want you to describe what I am doing to you'. Once more she
  began parting my soft tissue around my anus and pushed forward, she stopped
  and raised her eyebrows at me. I licked my lips and attempted to provide a
  humiliating commentary on her complete domination of my body. I found myself
  stuttering again; 
�Y-y-y-ou are f-f-f-fucking me up m-m-m-y arse' 
�Jeesssus fucking Christ, what are you some sort of retard' she spat out. 
�I'm only playing with you, this isn't even close to fucking someone up the
  arse' and she rammed it in hard and fast. Just as quickly, she pulled it out;
  using both feet, she kicked me forward onto my face. 
�You need to know what its like to be fucked' her mocking tone filled the
  air as she stood up pulling on the chain around my neck. I was dazed, I had
  taken the brunt of my collapse on my face, and my nose and lips had a dull
  ache and throbbing background to them. I moved up as quickly as I could as
  she pulled me over to the settee once more. 
�But that can wait. Right now you need to clean these' she proffered up the
  heel that had just been fucking me. 
�After all you are the dirty fucking bitch that made them this way' 
It dawned on me that she wanted me to lick clean the stiletto heel that had
  been thrust deep inside my arse. It was coated in mucus and what looked like
  trails of blood. 
�Don't just fucking look at it, clean it you fucking pathetic piece of shit.' 
Once again, I took one of her boot clad legs in my hand and raised it towards
  my mouth. The difference was this time I wasn't sure if I was excited, turned
  on or just scared. The idea of sucking off something that had just been used
  to fuck me intimidated the hell out of me. As the steel heel passed between
  my lips and I tasted the salty tang of my own lubrication, another veneer was
  laid down that said you cease to exist as a person . I licked my own
  blood and fluids off the shaft and sealed my own psyche as a slave bound to
  her whims. I took the whole stiletto in my mouth up to that gorgeous tan sole
  with its intricate pattern of wear that had so turned me on only 30 minutes
  before. 
�Good boy, you see what you can achieve when you put your mind to it?' the
  warmth in her voice made me feel worthwhile; she smiled at me and stroked my
  hair. There was an unspoken divided that had been crossed, I felt I was on
  the side of the chosen. She looked quizzically at me 
�Would you like to wank yourself'? Something about her intonation told me
  this wasn't just a question of what I wanted; it was a question of my understanding
  of my role in this relationship. My answer now would either affirm my position
  or destroy it. I cast my eyes down not daring to look a goddess in the face
  and replied as meekly as I could 
�I do only what you want me to do mistress'. This answer pleased her; she
  allowed another smile to play on her face.
