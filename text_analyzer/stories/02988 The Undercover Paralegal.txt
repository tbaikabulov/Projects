The Undercover Paralegal

  Deputy Duffy
 
   
  The sound of shuffling papers and dragging chairs signified the end of another
  Friday meeting. Cheryl Thomas sat nervously tapping her pencil on the mahogany
  table and glancing up at Mr. Griswald, the firm's senior partner. He had asked
  her to remain after the meeting so they could &quot;talk.&quot; Her head was
  swirling as to what he might have meant by that, surprised he even knew her
  name. She had fidgeted throughout the meeting. With two small boys at home,
  this wasn't the time to lose her job. She didn't have long to think about it
  though, since the meeting was brief, and the room emptied quickly.
 
&quot;Mrs. Thomas....&quot; Griswald beckoned her.
 
  Cheryl moved slowly to the head of the table. She was a little taken aback
  when he stood up and pulled out a chair for her. She thanked him and settled
  into the luxuriously padded executive chair that was normally reserved for
  the firm's partners. She felt uneasy.
 
&quot;Mrs. Thomas, it has come to my understanding that your work on the Porrello
case has been invaluable.&quot;
 
  Cheryl mentally blew a sigh of relief. &quot;Thank you sir,&quot; she said,
  looking up into his faded blue eyes, once again thinking how much they reminded
  her of Paul Newman's, as he appeared in her favorite movie, &quot;The Verdict.&quot;
 
&quot;Now, you know part of your job here, as a paralegal, is to investigate
the facts of cases and to ensure that all relevant information is considered.&quot;
 
&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; she mumbled.
 
&quot;Well, we have some information that might just set our client free.&quot;
 
&quot;I see, sir..., good..., but what does that have to do with me?&quot;
 
&quot;We need someone to get it on tape.&quot;
 
&quot;Tape?&quot; Cheryl offered.
 
&quot;Look, I won't force you to participate, but we've backed ourselves into
a corner on this one.&quot;
 
"Me,&quot; Cheryl said with a shrug, her heart a-flutter.   
 
&quot;I'm going to be honest with you. You only have one day to prepare, because
tomorrow you have a meeting at Mr. Carrasso's house.
 
&quot;Mr. Carrasso! Are you crazy!&quot; Cheryl snapped (as she knew about his
reputation all to well), and then she blushed at her outburst. 
 
&quot;Settle down. Mr. Donahue will be meeting with Carrasso. You will hang out
at the pool with his daughter.&quot;
 
&quot;Pool?&quot; Cheryl groaned. "Why?"
 
&quot;You see, his daughter knows that our client didn't kill anyone, because
she was with him the night of the murder.&quot;
 
&quot;Really?&quot; Cheryl blurted.
 
&quot;Yes, she was having sex with him and his girlfriend. We know because we
have an informant who actually saw the sex tape. Miss Carrasso is quite proud
of it.&quot;
 
&quot;Sex tape.&quot;
 
&quot;Yes, she's another Paris Hilton; in fact, she looks very much like her.
She may even be prettier. All we need is for you to record her telling you about
the sex tape. She bragged about it once. Of course, if you could get your hands
on the actual tape....&quot;
 
&quot;I don't think I can, sir,&quot; Cheryl said with a gulp. She also felt
very strange talking about sex with her old boss.
 
&quot;We already have it set up. We have Mr. Donahue's apartment completely bugged.
We just need you to talk her into coming over to his apartment, however you can.&quot;
 
&quot;Why?&quot; Cheryl asked. She also didn't like the &quot;however you can&quot; part.
 
&quot;To get it on tape. She has a loose lip, so it shouldn't be hard to get
her to admit to making the tape at the time of the murder. She knows it's true.
Once we have her recorded admission, she'll have to testify. You just have to
use some of your womanly charms. You'll save our ass on this one.&quot;
 
&quot;I see. Why don't I just ask her at the pool?&quot;
 
&quot;We need to record it, and Carrasso's place is out.&quot;
 
&quot;I could wear a wire,&quot; Cheryl offered, as much as she couldn't believe
she was even thinking about it. But Griswald didn't appear to be taking a &quot;no&quot; for
an answer. She was also growing strangely excited, probably because usually her
day consisted of pushing papers.
 
  Griswald shook his head. &quot;A wire is out. They would find it.&quot;
 
&quot;What?&quot;
 
&quot;Trust me on that one. Take the rest of the day off and be at Donohue's
at noon. Bring a bikini.&quot; Griswald stood up.
 
&quot;Hold on, sir! Just tell me why they'd find it!&quot; Cheryl plucked at
Griswald's sleeve.
 
  He straightened his jacket. &quot;Carrasso doesn't trust anyone...especially
  lawyers.... So his security team will search you both, before they will let
  you in.&quot;
 
&quot;Oh,&quot; Cheryl moaned, as her boss made his way out the rear door. &quot;Wait,
sir, please, I can't.&quot; But he was gone.
 
  Cheryl slumped into her chair. &quot;Searched!&quot; she gasped, shaking her
  head. &quot;What have I gotten myself into?&quot;
 
  The side door opening startled her out of her daze. It was an old janitor with
  a broom. She offered a friendly smile in passing and made her way out into
  the hall. She turned the corner and almost ran headlong into the very lawyer
  she was supposed to partner with tomorrow.
 
&quot;Ah, Jack, you surprised me,&quot; she gushed.
 
&quot;So, can we count you in?&quot; He asked.
 
&quot;I-I-I guess.&quot;
 
&quot;Oh, thank god! You'll save our ass on this one. You know where I live.
Come by tomorrow at eleven, so we can go over our game plan,&quot; he said rapidly,
then turned to leave.
 
&quot;Wait Jack,&quot; she said, grabbing his arm. &quot;That's twice I've heard
that 'saving ass line.' But...why me?&quot;
 
&quot;You,&quot; he said, and then paused as if searching for the right words.
Well, I was supposed to go over with my girlfriend, and I set everything up,
and then I went home yesterday, and she and her stuff are gone...cleared out.&quot;
 
&quot;But...again...why...me,&quot; Cheryl demanded, jerking on his arm. &quot;I
mean, there are some pretty lawyers here in the firm that could play your girlfriend.&quot;
 
&quot;Ok, Ok,&quot; he groaned, pulling his arm free. He smoothed out the expensive
cloth. &quot;You, ah, fit the description we got.&quot;
 
&quot;Description?&quot;
 
&quot;Yeah, well, description or prescription.... You're a pretty blonde, with
big bo....&quot; &lt;Ahem&gt;
 
&quot;Boobs!&quot; Cheryl snapped, a little insulted.
 
&quot;Yeah, that seems to be his daughter's type,&quot; he said. Then he laughed. &quot;Ok,
that's a universal type.&quot;
 
&quot;Gee, thanks.&quot; Cheryl wasn't happy, but at least now she knew why she'd
been picked. She also didn't like the fact that her boobs were being used as
bait to lure another woman into a damaging admission.
 
&quot;But seriously, you seem like you can handle pressure. Every time I give
you something to do in a pressure situation, you come through." He paused and
looked at his TAG Heuer watch. "You have some time now, so here," he said, handing
her his credit card and a business card of a high-toned beauty salon. "Go have
some fun and get your mind off of things for a little while. We have a big day
tomorrow. And thanks again."
 
  Cheryl took his advice. It was true that she very rarely had a day to herself.
  So she used this opportunity (and Jack's credit card) to unwind. Her first
  stop was the salon whose card Jack had given her. They knew him well. She wasn't
  really surprised that Jack went to a beauty salon; after all, she'd always
  thought of him as a &quot;pretty boy.&quot; She also joked that he might spend
  more time in front of the mirror than she did. But she had to admit he always
  looked good, and he always had a sexy woman on his arm at the firm's get-togethers. 
 
  She ordered up the works, since Jack was paying. And, remembering the bikini,
  she included a bikini wax. Cheryl blushed when it was time to take off her
  panties in front of a total stranger, but she tried to think of the female
  technician sort of like a doctor. She also didn't realize how painful it would
  be.
 
  Next, it was off to buy a new bikini. She went to a small, name brand clothing
  store. The well-dressed sales girl helped her pick out a few to try on. Cheryl
  blushed when she offered to help. Cheryl just shook her head and scurried off
  to the changing rooms at the back of the store. She hurried out of her clothes
  and tried on the first one. She took some time looking herself over, as it
  had been a few years since she had worn a suit that brief.
 
&quot;I guess I can still pull this look off,&quot; she said with a nervous giggle. &quot;Plus,
I still have these.&quot; She pulled the sting on her bikini top, and her breasts
fell out. She pirouetted, her exposed breasts bouncing and staring back at her
in the mirror. She reached up and cupped them in her hands, running her thumbs
around her pink areola and then, with a purr, over her erect nipples. 
 
&quot;Are you all right, Ma'am?&quot;
 
&quot;Ah...yes!&quot; Cheryl squeaked. Her face flushed when she heard the sales
girl's voice, and she suddenly remembered where she was. She tried on a more
conservative solid red one next and thought it was more appropriate. And she
felt less naked. Though she liked it, she still tried on a dozen more before
she left with the simple red one. Before she left, she also grabbed a white silk
robe. On her way home, she made a stop to get a spray-on tan, since having two
sons to look after didn't leave her with a lot of time to laze in the sun.
 
  While she was shopping, she also thought about what to tell her husband --
  and what not to tell him. She decided that, after they put the kids to bed
  for the night, she would tell him she had to work tomorrow with Jack Donahue
  and that they had an important 
  meeting...with Carrasso (just in case). And that's all she dared tell him,
  for now.
 
  It turned out he wasn't happy with the sudden news. Although he said he really
  didn't remember who Jack was, he certainly knew all about Carrasso's reputation
  from reading the newspapers. Carrasso was reportedly into guns, prostitution,
  gambling, and more. If the mob was dead, someone had forgotten to tell him
  and his gang.
 
  She assured him that she wasn't in danger, because the FBI knew who went in
  and out of that mansion, and Carrasso was aware of it. Her husband pouted,
  but remained silent.
 
&quot;Look honey, this is my chance to prove that I'm more than the blonde paralegal
with the big boobs,&quot; she said, as she stroked his hair. &quot;Plus I'll
tell you all about it tomorrow night. Although, I might not be home until late
'cause after the meeting we have to draft some briefs. But I will tell you. I
promise. I would never do things behind your back.&quot;
 
&quot;Ok,&quot; he finally said, after Cheryl had batted her blue-green eyes
a few times. &quot;I know that, and I trust your judgment. But please be extra
careful. I know your job is important....&quot;
 
&quot;Nothing is more important than you and the kids,&quot; Cheryl interrupted,
as she stroked his hair. &quot;And I will honey, everything is going to be fine.
And I will have my cell phone....&quot;
 
  Her husband held her chin in his hand as he stared her in the eyes. &quot;I
  just don't know what I would do if anything ever happened to you. I just love
  you so much.&quot; Cheryl was too moved to respond with anything but a passionate
  kiss...that led to an even more passionate love making session. 
    
Cheryl started a hot bubble bath afterward; she was still too wound
    up to sleep. As she soaked in the dim, candle-lit bathroom, she thought about
    what her boss had said earlier -- especially about "The Search." She had
    read some stories on the Internet and seen some movies that involved men
    searching women. She always got a small tingle of excitement as she pictured
    herself in that powerless situation. Cheryl's hands wandered over her body.
    She closed her eyes and drifted. Suddenly it felt like there were a host
    of hands touching her...rubbing her shoulders...caressing her breasts...patting
    her tummy...squeezing her ass cheeks...playing in between her legs...fluttering
    over her shaved pussy.... And then fingers slipping inside...even slipping
    inside her little bottom hole.
 
&quot;Oh god!&quot; she gasped, as she suddenly realized she was actually fingering
her own asshole. &quot;That's a little too real,&quot; she said, before she slipped
under the water.
 
  In the morning, after making her boys' breakfast, she grabbed her pool bag
  and headed for Donahue's apartment, which was located in a plush complex across
  the city. She flashed her husband one last reassuring look before she left.
  His smile warmed her heart.
 
  She drove across town, her nervousness building with every passing mile. She
  knew Donahue's apartment well because she had often been sent there to pick
  up paperwork. (Working at home was just one of the perks Donahue enjoyed as
  the firm's most successful attorney.)
 
  She spotted him jogging not far from his place and pulled over, but he just
  waved her on. She didn't have to wait long on the landing outside his apartment,
  however. When he jogged up the stairs, he was shirtless and sweat-soaked. It
  made his muscular body glisten. She followed him into his apartment, while
  catching a glimpse of the front of his tight, damp running shorts. Of course,
  she had heard the rumors, but now she had a better feeling as to why he walked
  with such confidence.
 
&quot;I have to take a shower. Make us some breakfast,&quot; he said, and headed
for the bathroom. Cheryl chuckled until she realized that he was serious. For
the second time today Cheryl found herself at the stove. &quot;Men!&quot; she
groaned. She wasn't really surprised that she was half through with her eggs,
when Jack finally made his way out of the bathroom, his cologne signaling his
approach. 
    
After some initial small talk, the conversation turned to the task
    at hand. He did most of the talking, and she did most of the nodding and
    mental note-taking. It was the way it always was between the two of them,
    as much as it irked Cheryl. It didn't help when he suggested she go change
    and &quot;pretty up&quot; in the bathroom.
 
  Now it was her turn for some mirror time. When she walked out of the bathroom
  sometime later, Jack looked up from his paper and did a double take. &quot;Oh,
  Cheryl, if I can be so bold, you ARE beautiful.&quot;
 
  Cheryl, who usually didn't wear a lot of makeup at work, blushed, dropped her
  chin, and fluttered her lashes. Jack looked her over carefully. She had her
  dirty blonde hair pulled back into a ponytail, but she left some bangs that
  fell seductively over her blue green eyes, now dramatic with dark liner. Her
  makeup was capped off with fire engine red lipstick, which accented her pouty
  lips. She also smelled like a warm spring time breeze.
 
  But then Jack started to chuckle.
 
&quot;What?&quot; Cheryl demanded.
 
&quot;You going dressed like that?&quot; he asked, shaking his head. She was
wearing her new silk white robe, with its sash wrapped tight around her waist,
and a pair of flip-flops. &quot;I thought you said you bought a new bikini?&quot;
 
&quot;I did -- it's under here,&quot; she said, as she seductively untied her
robe, causing Jack's heart to skip a beat. &quot;Taa-daa,&quot; she cheered,
as she pulled her robe open.
 
&quot;What's that?&quot; Jack said, with a frown.
 
&quot;It's my Atlanta Hawks basketball jersey,&quot; she said, with a giggle. &quot;It's
good luck. But don't fret, my love, my bikini's under here,&quot; she teased,
as she tied up her robe again. &quot;What did you think, I was going to go over
there wearing only a bikini, when you're in your Armani? I feel silly enough.&quot;
 
&quot;Ok, Ok,&quot; Jack said, &quot;but we're making a stop to do something
about those flip-flops.&quot; Jack stood up and surprised Cheryl, who was looking
at her feet wondering what was wrong with her flip-flops, by picking up her pool
bag as well as his briefcase. &quot;Let's go, honey-bunch.&quot;
 
  Things returned to normal when he handed Cheryl the pool bag. She huffed and
  followed him outside to his silver Lexus.
 
&quot;Hey!&quot; Cheryl whined, standing in front of the passenger's door as
Jack was about to get into the driver's side. &quot;You're supposed to be my
boyfriend.&quot;
 
  Jack just rolled his eyes, snapped on his shades, and got into the car. Cheryl
  glumly shook her head and got in. As they sped off, she called home on her
  cell phone. (Jack was a constant reminder of why she loved her husband so.)
 
  On the ride to the suburbs, they made a stop at a fancy shoe store. Cheryl
  was a little embarrassed to be trying on shoes while dressed for the pool (especially
  the styles that Jack picked out), but her shoe boy seemed to enjoy it and her
  freshly waxed legs. Although Jack wanted seven, she settled on a pair of six-inch
  spike heel sandals. The feet were glittery and transparent, and the spike heels
  were burnished silver. Cheryl had to practice walking in them, for it had a
  long time since she'd worn heels six inches high. She felt like they were made
  for strippers, but Jack was paying and it was for only one day. She also knew
  that her feet would be sore tomorrow. As they left the store, Jack dropped
  her flip-flops in a trashcan.   
They finally pulled up in front of a mansion that was guarded by a
    brick wall and a steel gate. They sat idling for a few minutes, taking the
    time to compose themselves. Jack had Cheryl put her cell phone and wallet
    into the car's glove compartment. Suddenly Jack laughed and pointed out the
    car's window.
 
  Cheryl looked out the window, but was a little puzzled. &quot;What's so funny,
  Jack?&quot;
 
&quot;When's the last time you saw three telephone workers up the same pole?&quot;
 
&quot;Oh,&quot; Cheryl groaned, remembering the FBI surveillance. She let out
a little laugh. Funny as it was, it didn't settle her nerves much. The large
steel gate started to open, and a large figure slipped out through the gap and
walked their way.
 
&quot;Oh, god, the ring! Your ring!&quot; Jack blurted.
 
  Cheryl jumped in her seat, and then realized she was still wearing her wedding
  ring. It was a struggle to get it off, since it was the first time she'd removed
  it since the wedding. But she just did manage to get it off and stashed in
  the glove compartment before the large figure came up to Jack's window.
 
&quot;You the lawyer?&quot; he bellowed.
 
&quot;Yeah, Jack Donahue,&quot; Jack said, handing the large man his ID.
 
&quot;Ok, pull in, and go to the front entrance.&quot; Cheryl realized, as he
talked, he was also scrutinizing her legs. It made her a little uneasy. Jack
drove the car through the gate and up to the front entrance.
 
&quot;I don't know if I can do this, Jack,&quot; she whispered. Reality was setting
in.
 
&quot;Nerves.... I'm nervous, too,&quot; Jack said, taking a deep breath. Cheryl
did likewise. &quot;Just follow my plan. We absolutely must get her back to my
place.&quot;
 
  Cheryl sighed. (&quot;He makes it sound so easy,&quot; she thought. &quot;But
  I'm the one with the tits.&quot;)
 
  They got out of the car and went up the front walkway. The door opened before
  they got to it, and a large bald man, wearing a suit and tie, waved them in.
  They edged past him into the foyer, where they were met by three other well-built
  men, dressed in cheap suits.
 
&quot;Hey, what the...!&quot; Jack bristled, as one of the men grabbed his briefcase,
while another pushed him against the wall. Cheryl didn't have time to react to
that, since her pool bag was ripped away, and she was also pushed against the
wall.
 
&quot;Check his stuff good,&quot; one of the men barked. &quot;If there's one
kinda geek Mr. Carrasso ain'ta trustin' most, it's a lawyer!&quot;
 
  One of the men began searching the briefcase; another rifled through Cheryl's
  pool bag.
 
&quot;Hiding anything I should know about?&quot; The bald man whispered, as he
started to rub Cheryl's shoulders. She turned her head to protest, but saw Jack
getting patted down, too. She also knew it would be futile. The bald man moved
his hand roughly down her body. He squeezed her ass and then moved his hands
around front. Cheryl squirmed as he brushed her sex. His hands moved higher and
higher. Cheryl held her breath for the inevitable. Her searcher purred as both
of his hands cupped and then fondled her breasts.
 
&quot;Well, what do we have here?&quot; he whispered.
 
&quot;Find something?&quot; The man who was searching her pool bag said, looking
up and then, catching on, laughed.
 
&quot;Get off,&quot; Cheryl snapped, but that just drew more laughter.
 
&quot;Good afternoon, all.&quot; An oily voice filled the hall, just as the bald
man yanked back on Cheryl's ponytail. &quot;Sorry I missed your entrance.&quot;
 
  Her hair free, Cheryl turned her head back and saw a well-dressed man in a
  black, pin-stripped suit with a beautiful long-haired blonde, wearing a flowing
  red robe, on his arm.
 
  (&quot;That has to be her,&quot; Cheryl immediately thought. &quot;Oh my! She
  is everything they said she was.&quot;)
 
&quot;Sorry for my men. They tend to be uncivilized at times,&quot; he said,
as he pulled on the arm that was pressing on Cheryl's back. &quot;Easy, big fellar.
Let her go.&quot;
 
  Cheryl slowly turned around -- and quickly fixed her robe, as she read the
  blonde's roaming eyes.
 
&quot;Hello, my name is Eddie, and this is Maria. From what I understand, you
will be meeting with Mr. Carrasso,&quot; the well-dressed man said. He looked
at Jack, who merely nodded. &quot;And your girlfriend will be enjoying the pool
and Maria's company,&quot; he continued, this time looking at Cheryl, who also
nodded. The beautiful blonde was now wearing a sly smile. Her eyes focused on
Cheryl. &quot;Good, nice to see we are all on the same page,&quot; Eddie said,
before he added. &quot;Frankie, escort Maria out to the pool.&quot;
 
  Cheryl watched as one of the men walked away with the blonde, who flashed a
  smile back over her shoulder. Cheryl was puzzled, wondering why she wasn't
  going along with them.
 
  Eddie moved over in front of Jack. &quot;Ok, before you enter for your meeting,
  I must insist on a further search.&quot; Jack began to sputter. &quot;I know,
  I know, you wouldn't dream of concealing anything. But let's be sure.... Strip.&quot;
 
&quot;What? You can't be serious,&quot; Jack argued.
 
&quot;Do I come off as anything but serious?&quot;
 
&quot;I really don't think this is...ough.&quot; Jack's protest was cut off by
a punch to the stomach, from one the goons. He sank to his knees. Cheryl could
only gasp, as the bald guy had her by the collar. She also realized, from the
way the men were positioned in the hall, that they were trapped.&quot;
 
&quot;Now, it didn't really have to come to this,&quot; Eddie said, bending down
in front of Jack. &quot;And believe me, we aren't going to get some sort of thrill
out of seeing you naked. It's just our job to make sure you're clean.&quot;
 
  He helped Jack to his feet and stepped back. Jack brushed off his suit and
  wiped his eyes. &quot;Look guys...knock it off.&quot;
 
  Cheryl's heart pounded as second after nervous second passed. Jack seemed frozen.
 
&quot;That is a very nice suit. Is that the problem?&quot; Eddie said. &quot;Just
hand it to Vinnie here, and he'll give it back good as new. It's not like you
have to go to the meeting naked.&quot;
 
&quot;It's not that,&quot; Jack said, before glancing at Cheryl.
 
&quot;Oh, I understand,&quot; Eddie said. &quot;Well, it's time to swallow some
pride. Wouldn't you say it's better for her to watch you a little humiliated
than to watch you get your ass kicked?&quot;
 
&quot;Please Jack,&quot; Cheryl moaned, as she thought she understood the real
reason he looked her way. And when Jack finally started to undress, she looked
down at the floor. She kept her eyes there until it was time for Jack to lower
his briefs. Then curiosity got the better of her, and she peeked. She had to
clench her teeth to keep from gasping -- the rumors were indeed true. Jack was
allowed to pull his briefs back up, and then Vinnie, with a sneer, escorted him
deeper into the house.
 
  Cheryl gulped, as the three remaining men all seemed to turn towards her at
  the same time. She didn't like that look in their eyes.
 
&quot;Sorry, honey, I didn't catch your name,&quot; Eddie said. The two other
men moved over to stand on either side of him. They had to be a foot taller than
him. It seemed almost humorous to her.
 
  Eddie cleared his throat. &quot;Did your parents give you a name?&quot;
 
&quot;Cher - Cheryl.&quot;
 
&quot;That's a pretty name...for a pretty woman,&quot; Eddie said, as he reached
out and brushed aside a lock of blonde hair that had fallen across her brows. &quot;And
such pretty eyes.&quot;
 
  Cheryl trembled and flinched. His coolness made her uneasy.
 
&quot;You saw your companion's search, no?&quot;
 
  Cheryl nodded, starting to get teary. A bad feeling started to wash over her.
 
&quot;So you know what's coming next?&quot;
 
  Cheryl knew, but didn't want to say. She was also still clinging to a vain
  hope.
 
&quot;I said, 'You know what's coming next?'&quot; This time Eddie spoke with
more force.
 
  Cheryl looked into Eddie's eyes and fluttered her dark lashes, but when she
  did, a small teardrop escaped and rolled down her cheek, ruining the desired
  effect.
 
&quot;No need for the water works, babe...no one'll hurt you here,&quot; Eddie
said. He crossed his arms and added, &quot;Just strip, and you'll be soaking
up the sun in no time.&quot;
 
  Cheryl played with the sash on her robe. She suddenly remembered her red bikini.
  She breathed a sigh of relief. (&quot;Surely they'll be able to see I couldn't
  be hiding anything in it.&quot;)
 
  She untied her robe. When she slid it off, she stood confused, until one of
  the burly men, who Cheryl thought was really mean looking, held out his arm.
  It startled her at first, but she took a deep breath and draped the robe over
  his arm, wishing the men weren't 
  standing so close.
 
  The largest of the trio laughed. &quot;Fuckin' Hawks jersey. I di'n't think
  nobody wore that shit no more.&quot;
 
&quot;Quiet!&quot; Eddie barked with a snap of his thumb and fingers. &quot;Jesus,
you talk like a retard.... Sorry my darling, please continue.&quot;
 
  Cheryl took another deep breath, lifted the shirt over her head, and draped
  it over the mean man's arm. Today it hadn't been so lucky.
 
&quot;Holy bazooks,&quot; the tall goon muttered. Cheryl quickly threw her arms
up in front of her chest. The bald guy that searched her earlier just smiled,
knowingly.
 
&quot;Can I go now? I really could use a swim.&quot; Cheryl wasn't lying; it
felt like she was on fire. Their lusty, roaming eyes weren't helping.
 
&quot;Sure,&quot; Eddie said, nodding his head, &quot;but finish what you've
started.&quot;
 
&quot;What?&quot; Cheryl gasped.
 
&quot;Yeah, we've seen why you're with that scum bag lawyer, now let's see why
he's really with you.&quot;
 
  Cheryl was insulted. (Even though she wasn't really with Jack, she knew what
  Eddie meant.) She made a throwaway gesture. &quot;You guys just want to see
  me naked!&quot;
 
&quot;Wow! Beauty AND brains,&quot; Eddie said. &quot;Plus, we are just doing
our jobs. Can't be too careful these days; there is a lot of shit going down...sorry,
pardon my French.&quot;
 
  Cheryl stood frozen, but her mind was a-buzz. Maybe she knew all along that
  she would be getting totally naked, especially after what had just happened
  to Jack. She also remembered her boss said something about a wire being found.
  And she also felt that these weren't the type of guys who would settle for
  her in just a bikini, when they could have more. She shivered, wondering just
  how much more.   
 
  When Eddie cleared his throat, she knew it was show time.
 
  A mother of two, Cheryl wasn't completely satisfied with her body, but knew
  that that her 36DD breasts would surely hold their attention. She untied the
  top of her bikini, spun it around to untie the back, and handed it over. She
  took their gasps as a strange compliment, although they made her blush even
  more. But she also hoped her breasts would divert their attention while she
  quickly slipped off her bottoms. She didn't hand them over though. Instead,
  she kept them balled up in her hand. They were too distracted to notice.
 
  When Eddie instructed her to make a slow half turn, Cheryl was happy to have
  those stripper-like shoes, for the first time since she got them. She felt
  as if they were helping her strut. Although it did made it a little harder
  when she had to bend down to touch her toes. She also knew the guys weren't
  really interested in her flexibility. A lone teardrop fell to the cold tile
  floor when she had to reach back and spread her ass cheeks apart, next. Then
  (omigod!) Eddie suddenly asked to see some &quot;pink.&quot; Cheryl was too
  embarrassed to argue and just wanted it to be over, so she readjusted her fingers
  a little 
  deeper and pulled apart again. She was sure they could see everything now,
  but apparently they wanted more, so she had to pull deeper and wider. Her eyes
  were so watery that Cheryl couldn't see much, but she knew Eddie had moved
  in for a closer look. She braced for his touch.
 
&quot;That's good. You can turn back around," Eddie said, lightly slapping Cheryl's
ass. "And if you ever need a job, my buddy is always looking for new talent.&quot; Eddie
handed a business card to Cheryl, who was somewhat confused. He also wiped her
tears with a hankie. She pulled away from his touch and then, finally realizing
that Eddie's buddy ran a strip joint, resumed her indignant pout.
 
&quot;Ok, you can get dressed now. Enjoy your stay. I gotta go. Take care of
her, guys.&quot;
 
  Cheryl heaved a sigh of relief. She bent to put her bottoms back on, as Eddie
  went out the front door. When she looked up, both of the men left wore similar
  sly smiles. &quot;Ok, guys, you had your fun with me, ha ha,&quot; she said,
  as she tucked the card in her bikini's 
  waistband.
 
&quot;Are you looking for this?&quot; the bald man teased, holding up her bikini
top. She saw that the other one held her robe and shirt behind his back.
 
&quot;Very funny guys, giv'em back,&quot; she said, nervously, as the men began
to circle her. &quot;C'mon, guys, quit it!&quot;
 
  The two men, teasing, tossed her bikini top back and forth over her head just
  out of her reach. She bounced between the two of them, like a topless pinball.
  Because of their size, she felt so helpless. To make matters worse, they were
  also taking every opportunity to 
  pinch her ass or cop a quick feel.
 
  The bald man finally turned and started walking through the house, holding
  the scrap of cloth over his head. Cheryl slowly followed, her hands clutching
  her breasts. Her ass was also receiving playful slaps from the other man as
  he herded her along. She was thankful that the house was otherwise empty. She
  saw the bright light of day and figured, with some relief, that she was finally
  being led out to the pool area.
 
  Cheryl stepped out onto the patio. The bright sun temporarily blinded her,
  and its heat hit her like a fist. When her eyes focused, she saw the blonde
  nearby sitting in a pool chair, wearing only a small Confederate flag bikini.
  There was an empty chair next to her. Cheryl wanted to sit down, but she wanted
  her top back, too. She saw the bald man waving it in the air, standing by a
  small pool house. Sighing at this juvenile game, she walked towards the pool
  house. But she stopped suddenly, as she realized she was acting like a rat
  following the scent of cheese, and she didn't want to be trapped like one.
 
&quot;Looks like I'm going to be sunbathing topless,&quot; she said, and then
she stuck her tongue out, in the bald man's direction.
 
  As she started to turn around, the man who was following her scooped her up
  off her feet and carried her squirming body into the pool house. She cried
  out to the blonde for help, but only heard a giggle, as the pool house door
  slammed shut. Cheryl was tossed onto an old wicker love seat. She got up quickly
  and tried to run to the door, but just bounced off the bald man and fell to
  the rubber matted floor.
 
&quot;Please, guys, don't hurt me,&quot; Cheryl pleaded.
 
  The men turned to each other and shared an evil laugh. The bald man turned
  back to Cheryl with a sly smile. &quot;Didn't you hear what Eddie said? No
  one will hurt you here.&quot;
 
&quot;Then let me out of here!&quot; Cheryl cried out.
 
&quot;But didn't you also hear him say 'take care of her, guys?'&quot;
 
&quot;C'mon, guys, let me go!" Cheryl pleaded, as she shifted back over to the
love seat. 
 
&quot;Oh, we will,&quot; the bald man chuckled, while he tapped on the front
of his pants. &quot;But first you're gunna have to 'finish what you started.'
Eddie also said that. Remember?&quot;
 
  When he moved his hand, Cheryl gasped, seeing that his pants were definitely &quot;happy.&quot;   
"Now, you've got a couple of cocks to suck and then you can go swimming."  
"Yeah, to wash off the cum," the other goon added.
 
&quot;No way!&quot; Cheryl cried, as the men crept forward. &quot;I'm marr....&quot; She
reflexively covered her mouth with her hand, her heart pounding in her chest.
Suddenly pushing papers didn't seem that bad. But they didn't seem to notice
her slip of the tongue.   
&quot;Talking time is over. Time to use them sultry red lips for a
    better purpose,&quot; the bald man sneered. He pulled her off the love seat
    and onto her knees. &quot;Don't say you never dun this before. And if you
    can handle that lawyer's horse dick, ours should be no problem.&quot;
 
  She tried to scamper away, but the bald man grabbed her ponytail. When she
  looked up, the other man had already dropped his pants and was pulling his
  cock out of his boxers. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw a figure looking
  in one of the windows (and it had blonde hair). Cheryl tried to move out of
  the way of the advancing cock, but the bald man was controlling her head. She
  felt a hand on her breast and it quickly went for a nipple twister. She let
  out a squeal. It was the opportunity the man standing in front of her was looking
  for, and he quickly stuffed his semi hard cock into her open mouth. She gagged,
  as the bald man began pushing her head back and forth on his partner's cock.   
"Yeah, suck that cock, bitch!"
 
  She gasped (for air), when they finally gave her second to breathe. She also
  gasped (in surprise) when she saw another face in the window. Recognizing Jack's
  slick black hair, her mind was racing. She took the cock back in her mouth.
  This time the bald man didn't need to push and pull; now she slurped on the
  cock, freely.
 
  (&quot;Was this Jack's plan all along?&quot; she thought. "To seduce the blonde.")
  She felt the bald man's hands wrap around her breasts, and this time he caressed
  them. It reminded her that she had never been with two men before, except in
  her dreams. Her husband's face suddenly flashed before her mind's eye, and
  she stopped sucking. But the big goon just grabbed her ears and started fucking
  her face. Her arms were tugged behind her back roped together. She gargled
  a protest.   
"There, she don't need them anyways." the bald man said, admiring
    his roping job.
 
  (&quot;Geez, what choice do I have now?&quot; she thought.) She started sucking
  again to try to stop the gagging face fuck. Her quick excuse to herself: She
  was undercover, and with Jack and her target, Maria, watching, she figured
  she wasn't in any real danger...if she just cooperated, anyway.   
She hoped Jack knew what he was doing. And she also hoped her husband
    would understand.... Besides, though she'd never admit it, sucking cock while
    being tied up, and pawed at -- with an audience watching -- was starting
    to turn her on. And when she felt a hand slip into the front of her bikini
    bottoms a couple of minutes later, she wondered if the hand's owner would
    know. His quick laughter was the answer. 
    
&quot;Man, this bitch is good to go,&quot; the bald man said, pulling
    on her hair. &quot;Here, have a taste.&quot; His slimy fingers slipped into
    her mouth, and after a slow start, she licked them with real enthusiasm.
    (While the other goon tore her bottoms off.) Although it was the first time
    she had tasted her own pussy juice, she was just thankful to have a cock
    sucking break. It was a short one.
 
  (&quot;If they want to freak me out, they're gonna have to try harder than
  that,&quot; she thought, trying to build her confidence.)   
She didn't even get flustered when, a few minutes later, the goon
    in her mouth started cumming; she had used the interval to prepare for the
    inevitable. It also brought back some "backseat" memories, from her teenaged
    years.
 
  The bald man pulled back on her hair again. She opened her mouth gratefully
  when she saw a silver flask in his hand. But she gagged and shuddered, as the
  flask's contents burned her throat. (&quot;Cheap men, cheap whiskey,&quot; she
  thought.) Still, when she saw the bald man unzipping his fly, she hoped he
  had more whiskey in that flask. She had a feeling she was going to need it. 
    
It was much, much later when Cheryl stumbled out of the pool house.
    The sun was considerably lower in the sky. She scrambled into the pool, not
    even pausing to take off her shoes. Submerging briefly, she ran her hands
    over her tender flesh, taking the men's advice to wash off the cum. A lone
    water chair floated by, and she climbed on top of it. It was a struggle;
    her whole body ached. Once aboard, she finally relaxed, letting the cool
    water wash over her lower body. It was soothing. 
    
She paddled until she could see the pool house where she had been
    for quite a while. She wondered just how long it had been. She could see
    that there seemed to be movement from inside. The biggest of the goons, slowly
    walked out the door, and offered a wave. She just shook her head, remembering
    that he shot off in her mouth and then still came back for more. The bald
    guy followed. He just smiled. She knew it was a satisfied one, since he had
    enjoyed both her mouth and her pussy. He seemed get a charge out of switching
    back and forth between the two.
 
  Two more of the guys walked out and never even looked her way. Cheryl laughed.
  She felt they might be a little more than just friends, although they still
  had their fun with her. When one fucked, one got sucked. But Cheryl felt like
  they were showing off for each other and the other men and that she was just
  their prop.
 
  Cheryl could see one more figure in the pool house, and she knew who it was.
  She remembered the look on Jack's face when he walked into the pool house:
  pure lust. He had watched her with four men, and he wanted to be number five.
  Yet he announced that he wasn't there for a blowjob, and he wasn't there for
  a shot at her cum-dripping pussy. Cheryl shivered, just like she did earlier
  in the pool house when he said he wanted to fuck her ass. Cheryl pleaded futilely
  with him when she saw the size of his erect cock, but instead she was tied
  into a helpless position. 
 
  Cheryl splashed some water on her face, as it burned again, like her asshole.
  But it wasn't from the setting sun. There were some things that puzzled her.
  She tried to work out the questions that danced in her head. Like when Jack
  first walked in, why didn't anyone seemed surprised? Why did they let Jack
  join in, especially after he announced his intentions? Why did the bald man
  tie her to the love seat in such a lewd position: Hands and feet bound overhead,
  her ass hanging off the seat's edge. Where did the lubricant come from? Where
  did Jack learn to use his fingers like that, to open her asshole? Why wasn't
  she more scared when she felt Jack's impressive cock knocking on her backdoor?
  Was that the most powerful orgasm she's ever had? Was it the mixture of pleasure
  and pain? The bondage? Or was it because everyone was watching? And when he
  was through, why did she have to suck off the bald guy and the goon one more
  time? 
 
  Cheryl splashed some pool water into her mouth and spit it out, wondering why
  she didn't do more of that earlier. She thought about the blonde, next. Why
  did the girl come inside the pool house and stand in the corner when Jack was
  butt fucking her? But why did she leave so soon and miss Jack's impressive
  cum shot? 
 
  A naked Jack walking out of the pool house and into the pool interrupted her
  thoughts. He swam over to her. &quot;Enjoying the water?&quot;
 
  Cheryl nodded with a smile, although she felt awkward. 
 
&quot;That's good baby, but this isn't the place we should be hanging around
in, if you know what I mean.&quot;
 
  Cheryl did. She quickly flopped off the chair, and they made their way out
  of the pool. There were no towels around and Cheryl couldn't find her pool
  bag. Jack was dressing in the pool house, and Cheryl really didn't want to
  go near it, but she finally made her way over.
 
&quot;Jack, I can't find my stuff. Where are my clothes?&quot; she said, standing
in the doorway and primly averting her eyes.
 
&quot;No clue, anything important in your bag?&quot;
 
  Cheryl thought about it. &quot;Nothing really, just a towel, some sun block....&quot;
 
&quot;Alright, then, forget it,&quot; Jack said, interrupting. &quot;Here, take
this.&quot; He unbuttoned his shirt and passed it to her. She cringed, because
she was wet, and the white shirt immediately turned transparent, but it was the
best she was going to get. Jack carried most of his clothes in a bundle as they
hurried back through the house towards the front door.
 
&quot;Hey, here it is,&quot; Jack said, scooping up her pool bag from the foyer
floor. Cheryl, though more confused than ever, didn't linger.
 
  Jack opened the passenger door and helped her in. Dropping the bag at her feet,
  he circled around to the driver's side, jumped in, and took off with a roar.
  Curiously, the front gate was open.
 
&quot;Jack, what the heck just happened? I mean...is the blonde coming over later?
But forget that, why did you let those guys do that to me? Was there a screw-up?&quot;
 
&quot;Ah, well, interesting word,&quot; he said with a laugh. &quot;No, I think
things went swimmingly!&quot;
 
&quot;Funny, Jack,&quot; Cheryl sneered.
 
&quot;Ok, we have some drive time, I guess I can tell you now.&quot; He turned
off the car's radio. &quot;Well, you see, it goes like this. It's a small world
sometimes, where people know people and their kinks.&quot;
 
&quot;Jack, don't talk like you're trying to bullshit a jury,&quot; she snapped. &quot;I
just want to know what the fuck's going on.&quot;
 
&quot;Ok, ok, I guess you'll find out everything anyway,&quot; he said, pointing
at her bag between her feet. &quot;Look in the bag.&quot;
 
  Cheryl opened the bag and saw some anonymous videotapes had been added to her
  stuff. &quot;What are those?&quot;
 
&quot;Tapes...surveillance tapes. That's what we came after, after all.&quot;
 
&quot;What?&quot;
 
&quot;Yeah, that's what this was all about.&quot;
 
&quot;Huh?&quot;
 
&quot;You see Cheryl, some things are easily explained...and some not.&quot;
 
&quot;I object!&quot;
 
&quot;Sorry, Cheryl. So, ah, here are the facts. Mr. Carrasso would never talk
to me. I'm defending his rival, after all. He'd like to see him rot in jail,
but he wouldn't testify to do it. That's not his style. And his daughter would
never admit to sleeping with Porrello, period. She knows it would kill her father
if he knew. I think that's kind of why she did it. And that sex tape. It doesn't
exist anymore -- and neither does the informant who saw it.&quot;   
 
&quot;Wait, slow down.... Murder...? How do you know all of this?&quot;
 
&quot;It's my job.&quot;
 
&quot;Don't be a smart-ass!&quot;
 
&quot;Sorry.... Well, I grew up around here. I know these people. And I wasn't
always a lawyer.... Besides, it wasn't murder...just a permanent vacation.&quot;
 
&quot;Oh, that's much better. But I'm still a little confused.... What's up with
the tapes?&quot;
 
&quot;You are.&quot;
 
&quot;What?&quot;
 
&quot;Yeah, they're tapes of your little performance today, although I'm not
sure 'little' is the right word.&quot;
 
&quot;Stick to the explaining, please,&quot; Cheryl said, noticing his eyes slide
downward to her wet chest.
 
&quot;Well, the house and the pool house was wired. Honestly, I think it's to
keep an eye on his daughter.&quot;
 
&quot;His daughter?&quot;
 
&quot;Ah hum, yeah, she is strictly off-limits. The last guy who even touched
her hair got his dick chopped off.&quot;
 
&quot;That's why you guys never.... Oh my!&quot;
 
&quot;Yep, as much as I'd have liked to. Me and every guy in there....&quot;
 
&quot;So you guys settled for me.&quot;
 
&quot;Oh, there was no 'settling' there, believe me. I wouldn't have gone through
all of that just to 'settle.'&quot;
 
&quot;Gee thanks, I think. But what was this really about then? Did you just
want to see me suck cock and get fucked? Or get gang-banged? You surely didn't
do this just so you could fuck me.... And why did it have to be in the ass? And
why the fuck are you laughing?&quot;
 
&quot;Sorry, but I must say, I enjoyed myself.... And I know you'll never admit
to liking it, so I won't even ask, but I know you did, too.&quot;
 
&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; Cheryl groaned, but deep down, she had a feeling he was
right. &quot;So now you have the tapes for proof. Is that it?&quot;
 
&quot;Sort of.&quot;
 
&quot;Explain.&quot;
 
&quot;Well, I have the tapes, and on our way back to my place I'm going to stop
at a trusted friend's house, and he's going to do some editing.&quot;
 
&quot;What's to stop me from destroying the tapes right now?&quot;
 
&quot;Nothing, go for it, if you want. The tapes aren't for me, anyway.&quot;
 
"Oh, yeah, then who?&quot;
 
  Jack chuckled. &quot;The one person who would probably enjoy seeing them the
  most.&quot;
 
&quot;What, you gunna show'em to our boss?&quot;
 
&quot;Not even close, although he played his part well. Think again.&quot;
 
&quot;Jack, stop teasing me. I'm tired.&quot;
 
&quot;I'll bet you are...but I hope you have enough energy for some more.&quot;
 
&quot;More?&quot;
 
&quot;Yeah, back at my place. You know I promised you a threesome.&quot;
 
&quot;Only if we couldn't get her to talk.... But...wait...you just said she
was off-limits.&quot;
 
&quot;Oh, Carrasso's daughter is, that much is true. But it's not with her,&quot; Jack
said, deciding to tell her the whole truth now. 
 
&quot;Look, who says I'm going to do it anyway? Even though I still don't know
what the fuck you are talking about.... Lawyers!&quot;
 
&quot;Oh, I think you will, when you see him -- and her, for that matter.&quot;
 
&quot;Her?&quot;
 
&quot;You see, truth be told, this isn't even about Carrasso's daughter...you'll
soon be eating my girlfriend's pussy, while being fucked from behind.&quot;
 
&quot;Yeah, right! Girlfriend? Wait, I thought you two split.&quot; He just smirked. &quot;Fuck
you Jack! Don't be fooled by my actions today. I did it 'cause I thought it was,
well, something I had to do for the case -- and like I had a choice. Fuck, they
tied me up. But I'm not a whore. I'm not having sex with you and your ugly ho.&quot;
 
  Jack laughed. &quot;You didn't think she was ugly when you saw her.&quot;
 
&quot;Yeah, when was that?&quot;
 
&quot;Today.&quot;
 
  Cheryl scrunched her face. &quot;Huh?&quot;
 
&quot;Yep, you can't tell me she isn't hot -- especially in that Confederate
flag bikini.&quot;
 
&quot;But I'm still not having sex with you or her.&quot;
 
&quot;You're right, you're not!&quot;
 
&quot;What?&quot;
 
&quot;You're having sex with my girlfriend and the main person behind this whole
day:   
your husband.&quot;
 
&quot;Huh? My husband?&quot;
 
&quot;Yep.&quot;
 
&quot;Wait a fucking minute!&quot; Cheryl screamed. &quot;If your girlfriend
was there.... Oh, you asshole!&quot; she punched him in the shoulder, and the
car swerved. "You set me up."
 
&quot;Easy, don't get us killed here.&quot;
 
&quot;I can't believe you guys. That wasn't even Carrasso's house was it?&quot;
 
&quot;Nope, close though, two doors down. Just rented it for the day from that
short guy in the slick black suit for the price of one naked woman.&quot;
 
&quot;And the big men?&quot;
 
&quot;Just some guys I use to play high school ball with. They used to block
for me, although we never did anything like THAT in high school.&quot;
 
&quot;Oh, you ass,&quot; Cheryl said with another punch. &quot;And here I was
thinking....&quot;
 
&quot;Yeah, all an illusion.&quot;
 
&quot;And the tapes are for my husband aren't they?&quot;   
"Sort of. The strip-search tape is for him and the pool house, well, that
  ones for me."  
"Huh?"  
"Well, he confessed that you have this running fantasy of being controlled
  by a group of men and being forced to strip naked. Well, he was tired of hearing
  about it."  
"So he got you to find the guys and tape it."
 
&quot;Now you're getting it. He said wanted to watch. Although, I personally
don't get it. I mean, if I had a woman like you, I would keep her all to myself.
I was even a little jealous in the pool house. But I had to let them, it was
the only way they'd go for it.&quot;   
"And, what was that all about, and why in the butt?"  
"That was me having a little fun. Your husband didn't know about that part.
  You see, not to be crude, I've wanted to fuck your ass since the second I saw
  you. The fact that you were so cold to me turned me on more."  
"Your such an asshole!"  
"Yeah, I think that's why I like the asshole so much. Plus, the look on your
  face."  
"God, I hate you."  
"I know, that's why I knew this would be my chance to have you. Let's just
  say your husband put his trust into the wrong man's hands.  
"He should have known never trust a scumbag lawyer.... So, my husband knows
  nothing of the sex?"  
"Not unless you wanna tell him."  
"No way, you can never tell anyone."  
"The gang bang will be our little secret. And no one will see the
    tapes but me and my girl. Oh god, do you think he's fucking her already?" 
    
"Gee, you are the jealous type."  
"I am. But it was the only way."  
 
&quot;Uh huh, but you will share your woman with us?&quot;
 
&quot;That part of the plan doesn't really thrill me, just like when my buds
threw a curve at me and made ME strip in the foyer.... Assholes! That wasn't
supposed to happen, but I can't wait to see the tape of your search, if your
hubby lets me. And don't get mad at your husband, the three way wasn't really
his idea, either. Although he didn't fight it too hard.&quot;
 
&quot;I bet!"
 
&quot;Serious, the idea was Kimberly Ann's...that's my woman's real name. Let's
just say...um...she has a thing for three-ways. It'll be her, you, and for the
first time another man....your hubby...but it's a one-time deal. That's the only
way she would agree to the whole thing, when the three of us talked it over at
last year's Christmas party. But she didn't have blonde hair back then.&quot;
 
&quot;So you guys have been planning this for...like six months. Oh, that rat-bastard
husband of mine! He even said this morning that he didn't remember you.&quot;
 
&quot;He said that was the hardest part...keeping secrets from you. But now you
know.&quot;
 
&quot;Oh my god, even the boss knows!&quot; Cheryl gasped, as she remembered
her meeting with Griswald.
 
&quot;Calm down, he doesn't know shit, as usual,&quot; Jack said, with a chuckle. &quot;All
I'll tell him is that we went to Carrasso's today... which we did, sort of, and
he refused to meet with us...which is what he did when I phoned last week for
a meeting.&quot;
 
&quot;But still...,&quot; Cheryl whined.
 
&quot;So this is between the four of us. Oh, and my guys know nothing more than
that they were helping fulfill a soccer mom's fantasy. But I think you fulfilled
some of theirs as well. A couple of 'em are married, too. So they won't talk.
And like you said you were tied up, and outnumbered. So you weren't exactly doing
it freely, although I've never seen someone come that hard.&quot;
 
&quot;God, I'm so embarrassed.&quot;
 
&quot;Yeah, well, that will wear off.&quot;
 
&quot;You sound so sure.&quot;
 
&quot;If your fantasy was, say, to wear a diaper and drink cow's milk right from
the cow, while a midget tickled you, THAT you could be embarrassed about.&quot;
 
&quot;Shut up!&quot; Cheryl said, with a giggle. 
 
&quot;Really now.... Once in your life, you wanted to know what it was like to
be controlled by a group of men. I don't see a problem with that. And I think
you found out that you like being tied up during sex.&quot;
 
&quot;But Jack, I see a small problem,&quot; Cheryl said, a small smile forming
on her lips.
 
&quot;What's that?&quot;
 
&quot;What if I liked it so much that I want to do it again?&quot;
 
  Jack smiled, (he knew he owned her now.) &quot;Well, all you have to is whistle.
  Just put your lips together and blow....&quot;
 
   
   The End   
   
Thanks for reading my tale.
