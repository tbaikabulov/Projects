***************************************************************** Cathy moaned, writhing. She hung, suspended face down in total darkness,
  long tendrils wrapped around her arms and legs, holding her spread-eagled and
  helpless.  
As her consciousness returned she became aware that the tendrils were warm,
  pulsing slightly, and that the ones on her arms were moving toward her torso,
  slithering up her arms like a pair of snakes.  
Her body jerked sharply, and the ones on her legs began moving as well, coiling
  up around her thighs, moving ever closer.  
She gasped as the tips of the tendrils on her arms brushed against her nipples,
  making them harden. And when the ones on her legs brushed her clit she came
  hard.  
From somewhere she heard/felt a deep chuckle, and more tendrils flowed over
  her. Two encircled her breasts, pulsing against them in a gentle massage as
  another curled about her throat. One brushed her lips, lightly tracing them.
  One that felt to be about the size of a man's fist and forearm pressed lightly
  against her vaginal opening as another burrowed between her ass cheeks, widening
  as it parted them.  
She opened her mouth to cry out against that intrusion and as she did so
  the tendril around her throat tightened, pulling her head back as the one at
  her lips surged into her open mouth, swelling and filling it, pushing into
  her throat as the ones at her ass and pussy thrust hard into her.  
She woke, screaming into her pillow, tangled in blankets.  
Jason sat up and pulled her close, reaching for the light. &quot;Shhhh...
  it's okay, baby. Just a bad dream.&quot;  
Sobbing and shaking, she clung to him as he soothed her. When she had calmed,
  he asked, &quot;Do you want to tell me about it?&quot;  
&quot;It was just a dream,&quot; she said, then sat up and glared at him.
  'YOU! It's all your fault! You and that - that - movie     you
  bought!&quot;  
&quot;It was just a cartoon,&quot; he protested, laughing.  
Cathy kicked out of the blankets and went into the bathroom. &quot;Cartoons
  are about talking bunnies that eat carrots, and about stupid coyotes. They
  are not about girls being raped by mechanical octopi.&quot;  
Jason chuckled to himself, not only at her comment, but at the signs and
  scent of her arousal. 'Yes,' he thought. 'She will be a good one. S hokushu
  will be pleased  .  ' 
    
::Indeed I am, human male. Indeed I am.::  
Jason smiled. He should have known that Shokushu would have been involved
  in Cathy's dream. He liked testing potential flesh that way.  
Cathy returned to bed and Jason turned out the light, pulling her close to
  him. One hand stroked up her thigh, brushing lightly past her hip and up her
  torso to stroke the side of her breast. She moaned softly as his mouth captured
  one breast, sucking lightly on the nipple.  
&quot;Jason... God, Jason, it's 3 am.&quot;  
&quot;So?&quot;  
&quot;I have to get up for wor-&quot; She had missed the slight edge in his
  voice, and her words were cut off as his lips covered hers, his tongue pushing
  into her mouth as he rolled her onto her back, covering her body with his,
  pressing hard against her, groping for her breasts, kneading and squeezing
  them, his hands harsh, and demanding.  
She groaned, and her legs parted for him despite herself. She was still wet
  from her dream and he thrust deeply into her pussy, taking her roughly, his
  original intention of a long slow lovemaking session washed away in the anger
  at her protest.  
She writhed beneath him, breaking the kiss. &quot;Jason, please, you're hurting
  me.&quot;  
He stopped, buried deep within her, moving his hands to her throat, his thumbs
  pressing lightly against her windpipe. &quot;What did you say?&quot;  
&quot;Please,&quot; she whimpered.  
He increased the pressure. &quot;What happens when I want to fuck?&quot; he
  hissed. She whimpered, neck arching, trying to relieve the pressure. &quot;What
  happens?&quot; he repeated, his grip tightening.  
&quot;We fuck,&quot; she choked out.  
The pressure decreased slightly. &quot;Say it again.&quot;  
&quot;When you want to fuck, we fuck.&quot; 
    
&quot;Again.&quot;  
&quot;When you want to fuck, we fuck.&quot;  
Cathy was nearly sobbing now, and he released the pressure. &quot;That's
  better.&quot; He resumed fucking her, almost mechanically now, taking his pleasure
  from her.  
He pulled out just in time to shoot his load across her breasts and belly,
  then rolled away from her. leaving her naked, uncovered, and cum splattered.  
&quot;I'm going to sleep,&quot; he informed her. &quot;You will call off
  tomorrow, and you will not clean yourself until I tell you to. Understand?&quot;  
She shuddered, but felt a tingle between her thighs. &quot;Yes, Sir. I understand.&quot;  
Cathy lay on her back, unmoving, listening as Jason's breathing deepened.
  But for her, sleep was a long time coming.  
********************************************  
Jason woke before the alarm and turned it off, then rolled over to look at
  Cathy. She was still on her back, his cum dried on her flesh. She did not seem
  to have moved since he had finished with her, and he smiled. She was a good
  little slut, all things considered, and he would miss this one.  
He was over his anger at last night's near refusal, but still, she needed
  to be reminded of her place so he slapped her face to awaken her.  
Cathy jerked awake, sitting up sharply to find Jason grinning at her in a
  most disconcerting way.  
&quot;Do you remember what I told you, slut?&quot;  
For a moment her brain was still sleep fogged, then last night came back
  in a rush.  
&quot;Yes, Sir. I am to call off from work and not clean myself until you
  tell me to.&quot;  
&quot;Good girl.&quot; He flicked a finger across her clit. &quot;Get to
  it.&quot;  
He lay in bed, waiting for her to finish in the bathroom. &quot;All fours,&quot; he
  said as she emerged, and she moaned as she sank to her hands and knees, crawling
  for the living room and the phone. He watched, smiling, liking the way her
  breasts moved as she crawled, the way her ass and cunt were exposed, feeling
  himself getting hard.  
Smiling, he waited a few minutes, then rose, following her silently, leaning
  in the doorway while she dialed, then moving to kneel behind her, his cock
  pressing against her pussy. Leaning forward, he grasped her breasts and put
  his lips to her free ear, &quot;Better get wet, slut...&quot;  
She moaned softly, trying to cut the sound off as her call was answered. &quot;Grace,
  Milburn and Howser, Attorneys at Law. Vivian speaking, how may I help you?&quot;  
 
  Jason grinned as he heard the voice of the office prude (and personal secretary
      of Horace Grace, the founder of the firm).   
&quot;Vivian, this is Cathy Westin. I -&quot; Jason thrust hard into her
  as she spoke and she gasped hard. &quot;I wo- won't be com - I won't be in
  today.&quot; She stammered out the words as he fucked her hard, doggy-style,
  his balls slapping her with each thrust.  
&quot;Cathy? Are you all right?&quot;  
&quot;Y-yes. Just really sick... bad stomach cramps..&quot;  
Vivian made some sympathetic noises and Cathy just barely managed to get
  the phone hung up before she groaned at Jason's assault.  
He grinned, pumping hard into her as he squeezed her breasts. &quot;Might
  have to do something about these tits today... Oh, did I mention that you won't
  be wearing any clothes?&quot;  
Cathy whimpered, and he suddenly pulled out of her and stood, gripping her
  hair to pull her up on his knees as he stepped in front of her, his cock at
  her mouth. Obediently her lips parted and he thrust into her, cumming almost
  as soon as her lips wrapped around his cock, holding her head tightly as she
  sucked and swallowed.  
She milked his cock dry, shivering as she felt the increasing wetness between
  her legs. &quot;Now that you've had your breakfast, see to making mine.&quot; Wiping
  his cock with her long blonde hair, he turned and headed for the shower, leaving
  her to crawl to the kitchen.  
Cathy knelt quietly beside his chair as he ate breakfast and read the paper,
  taking no notice of her. It hurt. She loved him, and being ignored was the
  worst thing he could do to her. She felt that it was unfair, that he was punishing
  her far more than she deserved for last night, but she said nothing as he rose,
  folded the paper, and headed for the door.  
 
  He stopped at the table next to it and opened the drawer, pulling out five
      binder clips, holding them for her to see. &quot;When I get home, I want
      one on each nipple, one on your clit, and one on each pussy lip. Understand?&quot;   
&quot;Yes, Sir.&quot; She shivered as he scattered them on the table top,
  the sound ominous to her.  
He left with no further word, and she crawled away, not rising from her knees
  until she reached the kitchen and began clearing away his plate.  
As she made and ate her own breakfast, she thought about how she'd come to
  be here, naked, cum-splattered, a near slave to Jason.  
Jason was a young attorney at a different law firm than the one she worked
  at, but in the same office building. She remembered the first time she'd seen
  him, how she'd admired his trim body, the body of a natural athlete, of someone
  who went out and did things, not of someone who spent an hour a day at the
  gym.  
She saw him frequently, and one day they ended up on the same elevator, and
  he turned to ask her what floor...brown hair, warm blue eyes, and a smile that
  could melt both polar ice caps. Somehow she'd managed to get out her answer,
  hoping she didn't sound like a total idiot. She could feel his eyes on her
  as it went up, but she avoided his gaze even as she felt the color rising in
  her cheeks. Somehow she managed not to get off on the wrong floor, and fled
  to the ladies' room to try to regain her composure.  
Then she had tried to immerse herself in her work, but he kept intruding
  at odd moments. She would find herself thinking about him, seeing herself kneeling
  before him, her lips around his cock. She kept shaking herself out of the fantasies,
  trying to focus, but it was no good. Co-workers who noticed her distraction
  asked if she was okay, and she merely said she wasn't feeling well and was
  having trouble focusing.  
She had stayed a bit late to finish up her notes, and the floor was deserted
  when she left. The floor, but not the building. He had been waiting when she
  got off the elevator.  
He introduced himself, and asked her out for drinks so sweetly that there
  was no way she could have refused, and before the night was out she had fallen,
  hard.  
They had made love for the first time that weekend, and she had moved in
  with him a month later, and soon after that had surrendered completely to him.  
And she still didn't know why she had, or how it had happened. It had started
  as fun and games, but the game ended and became part of her daily reality...
  And now... Now it seemed to have changed again. There had been no gentleness
  in him since last night's stroking of her body, a stroking she had foolishly
  objected to...  
By 10:00 the housework was done, and she was restless. The thought of the
  clips on the hallway table preyed on her mind, and she often found herself
  going out to look at them, shivering at the thought of the cold metal pinching
  her flesh.  
The phone brought her back to herself and she answered it to hear Jason's
  voice. &quot;Put that DVD in and put it on continuous play. I'll call throughout
  the day, and I'll expect to hear it.&quot; He hung up before she could reply,
  and she slowly put the receiver back in the cradle... and obeyed.  
The music was cheesy, the dialogue more so, and the artwork made her think
  of Speed Racer drawn by perverts on Viagra, but as the day wore on she found
  that it was preying on her mind more and more. And on her body as well: when
  the tentacled monster was raping its victim for the third time, she found herself
  on her back, her hips bucking as she immersed herself in the memory of her
  dream last night.  
True to his word, Jason called again, just as she could possibly have cum
  as the girl in the movie screamed. &quot;Just checking,&quot; he said, and
  hung up.  
The next call announced that he was on his way home, and that he expected
  to find her standing in the shower, no water -- he wanted to see the dried
  cum -- clipped as instructed. She glanced at the clock. It was a quarter after
  five and she had no way of knowing if he was just leaving the office, was half-way
  home, was stopping off somewhere, or about to walk in the door. Fearfully,
  she grabbed the clips, pinching them onto her nipples as she headed for the
  bathroom, almost gasping at the pain. Stepping into the shower stall she stopped
  to do the ones on her pussy lips, biting her lower lip as they closed harshly.
  As the last one closed onto her clit she did cry out, and collapsed against
  the wall, shuddering as she tried to adjust to the pain. Slowly it faded and
  she forced herself not to relax, trying not to move.  
The walls were mirrored, and she studied herself as she waited. Round breasts
  cruelly pinched by the clips, her face showing signs of the pain and also need,
  her lips full and naturally dark, even without lipstick. Her hair hung in unbrushed
  tangles, she having not wanted to risk Jason's wrath by brushing away the remnants
  of the morning's cum, dried bits from last night still adorning her breasts
  and belly. Her hips had just enough curve, and her legs were firm and toned,
  and parted, the three clips clearly visible.  
She heard the door open, and straightened, raising her arms, locking her
  fingers behind her neck, gasping as the movement brought pain.  
She waited, straining to hear him over the movie, trembling in fear and anticipation,
  aware of the scent and feel of her excitement as her nipples hardened in their
  clips. She closed her eyes, concentrating on listening, and suddenly he was
  there, his naked body crushing hers, sending fresh waves of pain as he pressed
  her against the wall, his lips on hers.  
She kept her fingers locked behind her neck, her back arching, pressing her
  hips against him, moaning, responding helplessly to him. He broke the kiss
  and stepped back, smiling, and she looked into his eyes and melted again, even
  as his hands painfully kneaded her breasts. He cupped one in his hand, bending
  the handles of the clips forward to press into her flesh, repeating with the
  other as her murmured about how glad he was to see her, how pleased that she
  had followed instructions so well, and she shivered in pleasure.  
He pointed to the floor and she knelt; he brushed his cock against her lips
  and she opened her mouth, taking him in, moaning in pain as her breasts brushed
  against his legs, but sucking and licking obediently.  
&quot;God, Cathy, I've been thinking about this all day,&quot; he groaned,
  his hands in her hair. He felt her shiver of pleasure and smiled, not just
  at the feel of her mouth on his cock, but at the thought of how well she was
  turning out... had turned out, he corrected himself; it was almost time to
  turn her over.  
He pulled her head away and moved behind her, kneeling as he pushed her to
  all fours, reaching down to release the clips on her pussy lips, thrusting
  into her as the pain surged, making her cry out. He fucked her slowly, knowing
  that each thrust brought pain as well as pleasure, his hands playing with her
  breasts, watching her in the mirror, savoring her pain, her tears, her surrender
  and obedience and acceptance. He released the clips on her breasts, massaging
  them, bringing pleasure as well as pain, feeling her thrusting back into him
  as he took her.  
Yes, he would miss this one, he thought as he thrust hard into her one more
  time, gripping her hips as he released.  
He stood up, and she turned, licking his cock clean without being told. She
  finished and he drew her to her feet, then led her to the bedroom, laying her
  on the edge of the bed, her feet on the floor. He removed the final clip and
  as she nearly screamed at the returning sensation he licked and sucked lightly
  at it until she climaxed.  
&quot;Thank you, Sir,&quot; Cathy panted.  
&quot;You're welcome, slut.&quot; Jason smiled and ran his tongue along her
  slit, then rose and pulled her to her feet. &quot;Come on, shower time, and
  then dinner out.&quot;  
She smiled and followed him to the shower, adjusting the water before they
  stepped in. As they washed each other, Cathy relaxed. This was the Jason she
  knew and loved. But then, the other Jason was as well. She loved his tenderness
  and his cruelty and the way he took control and the way he knew exactly what
  she needed, even when she herself didn't.  
That night, she fell asleep quickly and easily in Jason's arms.  
*******************************************************  
Cathy cried out as the lash descended yet again, burning another stripe across
  her ass. She was on fire from the strikes, knowing that red lines crisscrossed
  not just her ass but her upper back, shoulders and arms, the backs and inside
  of her thighs, and her breasts. She was once again suspended in total darkness,
  held spread-eagled by tendrils on her arms and legs, but this time there was
  no caress to her nipples and clit -- this time they merely held her with a
  vise-like grip, stretching her, exposing her, making her vulnerable to the
  stinging strikes of a thin lash. A lash that she somehow knew was also a tendril.  
She woke, screaming, her body convulsing, as the next blow sizzled on her
  clit. She lay there, sobbing for breath as the all-too-real dream pain faded.  
&quot;Cathy?&quot;  
She rolled over at the sound of his voice as Jason stepped into the bedroom. &quot;Jason?&quot; His
  arms were around her, holding her as her shaking slowly eased. &quot;I - I
  had another dream about... about tentacles.&quot;  
&quot;Hush... It's all right. It was just a dream.&quot; He kissed the top
  of her head softly. &quot;That movie really got to you, didn't it?&quot;  
She nodded against his chest, whimpering.  
He smiled, one hand reaching down between her legs, and she flinched, fully
  expecting her clit to hurt when he brushed it, the dream still too real and
  vivid. Instead, he stroked his fingers against the soft velvet of her shaved
  pussy, drawing up fingers damp with her arousal and holding them to her lips. &quot;Seems
  like it got to you in more ways than one.&quot;  
Her only response was to suck her juices from his fingers.  
He tucked her back into the bed and turned away. &quot;Jason?&quot;  
&quot;Hush. I couldn't sleep so I got up to surf the web. Let me log off
  and I'll be right back.&quot;  
As the computer was shutting down he felt a familiar presence. ::She is most
  amusing this one. You have done well with your selection and training of her.
  I am well pleased. We are all well pleased. We look forward to receiving her.::  
Shokushu was pleased, and this pleased Jason. Yes, he would miss Cathy, but
  pleasing Shokushu was more important.  
::Perhaps when we tire of her we will return her to you:: Shokushu chuckled.
  ::Perhaps.::  
Jason smiled, turned off the light, and went to bed.  
::Tomorrow. Bring her tomorrow.::  
Jason nodded. 'Tomorrow,' he thought.  
Cathy was already asleep, but Jason lay there for a bit, listening to her
  breathing, thinking about what was to come for her. And for him. There was
  a smile on his face as he finally drifted off.  
She lay face down in a hammock of the living tendrils. They held her, wrapped
  around her calves and forearms, and she writhed in them, fearful, her mind
  wracked by memories of pain and assault, of rapes and whipping. But they just
  held her, quietly, almost soothingly, and she felt them pulsing gently, rubbing
  and massaging her arms and legs. They emitted a gooey liquid substance, rubbing
  it into her skin. It had a soft scent, mildly intoxicating, and she couldn't
  resist drawing it deeply into her lungs, nor could she resist the lethargy
  that it caused.  
The tendrils started moving towards her torso, and her body jerked, tensing,
  struggling in blind panic as she remembered the first time, the ruthless taking
  that had come after the gentle touches. But they just continued their steady
  pulsing, holding her firmly and surely as she struggled against the urge to
  relax, to accept them, trying not to inhale the fragrance of their secretions.  
They lightly stroked and kneaded her breasts with a lover's caress, and despite
  herself she moaned softly in pleasure. They kneaded her back and neck and shoulders,
  pressing hard into her flesh, and she feeling the tension ease as they worked
  out knots in her muscles, slowly working their way down her back, their touch
  firm and steady.  
She felt them on her ass, kneading the flesh there, and she shivered. The
  liquid flowed into her crack, and one of the tendrils followed it. &quot;No!&quot;  
The liquid splashed across her ass as she jerked wildly, crying out her protest.  
&quot;Cathy?&quot; Jason was trying to right the bottle of massage oil, keep
  the overflow from spilling onto the sheets and sooth her all at the same time,
  suddenly wishing he had a few tentacles of his own.  
&quot;Jason? What -?&quot;  
He chuckled softly as he put the bottle of oil on the nightstand and massaged
  her ass with the towel that was sopping up the spill. &quot;Just a massage,
  Cathy. You've been so tense lately, I thought you could use one.&quot;  
She relaxed under his touch, calmed by his words, her eyes closing. &quot;You're
  so good to me,&quot; she murmured.  
&quot;I think we need a break today,&quot; he offered.  
&quot;So are we going to 'get up and get away'?&quot; she laughed, singing
  the last part.  
Jason chuckled. &quot;Well, get up and get away at any rate. I thought maybe
  a drive and a picnic out in the country. There's this place I know... a meadow,
  a lake, very private...&quot;  
&quot;Sounds wonderful,&quot; she replied.  
&quot;Good.&quot; He leaned forward and kissed the back of her neck. &quot;Go
  shower the oil off and we'll go.&quot;  
He cleaned up while she was in the shower, and when she came out there was
  a sundress laid out on the bed for her. She smiled and put it on, along with
  the sandals. There was a straw hat also, and she put it on, feeling a bit silly,
  but if he wished it...  
Jason came into the bedroom and smiled, hugging her, his lips hot on hers
  as his hands roamed her back, squeezing her ass. She knew he was checking to
  make sure she was not wearing panties, and that excited her as much as the
  feel of his hardening cock pressing against her.  
He took her hand, and led her out to the car, opening the door of the red
  convertible for her, kissing her again as he closed the door.  
They made two stops, one for a bottle of wine and one for a basket of picnic
  food that he'd called ahead for while she showered, and then they were heading
  out of the city, and were soon on a winding road that led through open tree-dotted
  fields.  
The sun was bright in a cloudless sky, the temperature just warm enough,
  and everything in Cathy's life suddenly seemed perfect.  
Jason parked the car, and the silence seemed deafening. He got out of the
  car and put the wine in the basket, then opened the door for her. Hand in hand
  they walked up a path through some trees, listening to the soft sounds of nature,
  Jason wondering what she would think if she knew that this was the last time
  she would hear them, the last time she would feel the sun and a warm breeze
  on her skin, the last time she would walk on the Earth.  
Maybe she didn't know it was her last day on Earth, but Jason did, and he
  vowed to make it special.  
And it was. Cathy lay back on the blanket, gazing at the sunset, thinking
  that today had been everything she could ever have wished for. Jason had been
  wonderful, loving and attentive. They had spent the afternoon twined together
  in long slow lovemaking, savoring every inch of each other's body. And yet
  something had been missing... her mind had kept straying back to her dreams
  and the disturbing eroticism of them...  
Jason poured two final glasses of wine and handed one to her. &quot;To all
  that has been,&quot; he said, touching his goblet to hers.  
&quot;And to all that will be,&quot; she added.  
&quot;Yes, and to all that will be,&quot; he murmured, watching her as she
  drank.  
*********************************************************************  
Cathy knelt on a solid but cushiony surface. She was naked, her wrists bound
  tightly behind her back, her ankles lashed together, and her knees pulled widely
  apart... not by ropes or scarves or leather or metal, but by the tentacles
  she had come to know so well. Another was wrapped around her throat, and it
  tightened and pulled back, pulling her head up.  
There was the familiar darkness, but this time there was sound, voices for
  lack of a better term, several of them. It almost sounded like there was a
  crowd in front of her, but she could not understand any words, could not recognize
  a language.  
A tentacle touched her chin, lifting it, and she raised her eyes, for the
  first time seeing her tormentor, and her mind reeled, unable to comprehend
  what she saw. She wanted to scream, but somehow she couldn't.  
She got the impression of a smile, not entirely unkind, but thoroughly unnerving.
  ::I am glad to finally meet you in person:: A tentacle caressed her breasts,
  and she moaned. ::You have quite a few fans here. It should be a most interesting
  and lucrative auction.::  
&quot;Auction? What... Who are you?&quot;  
::You could not pronounce my name, but you can call me Shokushu. It is one
  of the names that Jason uses for me.::  
&quot;Jason?&quot; She struggled against the tendrils that held her. &quot;Where
  is he? What is going on?&quot;  
::He is not far away. And what is going on is an auction. Yours.::  
&quot;But...?&quot;  
::Enough. It is time.::  
The being moved away from her, revealing a constantly shifting tableau that
  her mind struggled to wrap around. She seemed to be on a stage, with tiers
  of seats rising up in an arc from it. The movement came from the tentacled
  beings that sat there, arranging themselves, settling in. They were also responsible
  for the sounds she had heard, but they quieted as the one who had spoken to
  her moved to a podium.  
She shuddered as the auction began, for an auction it unmistakeably was.
  The bidding thinned until there were only two, and she struggled to force herself
  to study them.  
With a sudden shock she recognized them in some unknown way. One was the
  one who had whipped her, the other was the one who had massaged and caressed
  her.  
'But those were only dreams!' she told herself. 'Just dreams! So this has
  to be a dream... Come on, Cathy, wake up! You fell asleep in the meadow and
  it's time to go home.'  
But even as the thoughts raced through her mind she knew... She knew it was
  not a dream, but a nightmare from which she would never awaken. And Jason,
  she thought, Jason had put her here.  
The bidding slowed, the two beings seeming to take their time, considering
  their bets carefully. The cruel one was ahead.  
Desperately she sought out the gaze of the other. 'Please.' she thought.
  'Please, buy me... Don't let him have me. Oh, please...'  
She caught a sense of curiousity from the creature. ::You wish to be mine?::  
A wave of relief made her almost slump in the tentacles that held her. 'I
  don't want to be his. Please...'  
Again ::You wish to be mine?:: and she groaned. She didn't want to be his,
  she wanted to be Jason's, the way things used to be. But Jason was somehow
  responsible for her being here, she knew that, without knowing how she knew,
  even though her mind refused to believe it. The afternoon flowed through her
  memory, Jason's voice whispering what he had never said before, that he loved
  her...  
She sobbed, suddenly broken. 'Yes. I will be yours. I'll serve you willingly.'  
She could see Shokusho out of the corner of her eye, could see that he was
  about to lower the gavel, sealing her fate, selling her to the cruel one and
  she begged... 'Please... He'll kill me!'  
He made a motion and the gavel paused as the crowd gasped.  
Shokusho looked to the other, who made what could only be a motion of negation
  and the gavel came down.  
Cathy was lifted and passed to the creature in the front row, and thus handed
  (tentacled? she thought) from creature to crature until she was passed to her
  new owner.  
::You will know me as Kah'lmar:: he said, ::but you will call me Master.::
