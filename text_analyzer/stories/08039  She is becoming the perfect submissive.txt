She is becoming the perfect submissive

When they first met she did not know how much he would get into her mind. How much she would desire to be back under his control. They had grown to know each other over time each time she would visit the states they would talk and hang out. One day she finally went off alone with him and some would think it was dangerous for her but what she found was a deep submission that she yearned for. They were laughing and joking around at his house, they had played around discussing the D/s lifestyle for a long time. He went and grabbed some things out of his dresser drawer. He reached around her and placed a collar on her neck, you could see her eyes roll back and the catch in her breath. She trembled all over as she felt the leather tighten on her neck; then she heard the click of the lock. The only words out of her mouth were �yes please�. She slowly undressed and presented herself to him in all her beauty. She has a very petite body and medium sized breasts, a very nice ass, all of the mixed perfectly with slightly pale skin. You could see the power of just the collar had over her mind; he knew that he was capturing this beauty under his powers. He sat there and caressed her soft skin, contemplating his next move. He reached down and brought out the leather cuffs and locked them on her writs and again the sweet submissive yet lustful look overtook her face. She could feel her pulse race with each sound of the locks closing. Finally he locked her ankles in the leather cuffs and locked her away. Although she had full movement of her limbs her mind felt like a captive. She knew she was going to submit to his desires. She had longed to be like this with him and now it was happening, she knew she had know escape. No escape from the cuffs and no escape from her mind.

He started caressing every part of her body, their lips met and they could feel the heat building. In her mind she could feel his loving touch; she knew she would be safe in his control. He started to rub her clitoris learning what touch she needed to bring her to orgasm. She guided him in her needs and allowed him to learn her body even more. Her first orgasm splashed against his hands, he relished in her juices knowing he had her body now as well as her mind. He knew she was his; he could toy with her body and make her his plaything. He brought out lengths of chains and began to secure her even more, locking her body and her mind deeper in his control. She told him she was not into pain and that was her limit, she began to open up about her many fetishes she enjoys. He took many mental notes maybe not for this session but for future ones. He got out his crop and decided it was time to add some color to her paled skin little ass. She enjoyed his soft but firm strokes on her ass; her soft moans only drove him on. Slowly her skin gained a nice red tint that he desired. He decided it was time to spank her sweet pussy. She had never had any one do that to her and she felt the apprehension build inside her has she felt his hand contact with her flesh. She started to fight within her mind that although the slaps were soft but firm she could feel the sting in her skin and pleasure and heat building inside her. He continued to spank her pussy she moaned and tried to slightly wiggle away from them. She felt bad that she was enjoying this that her body betrayed her thoughts as soon she was having on of the most intense orgasms. 

Her mind was spinning with all the pleasure and feelings her body was going through. It was time to just tease her body. He pulled out a silver bullet remote vibrator and placed inside her. He left it buzzing inside her and then stopped. He would let her lay there as they kissed and the hit it on high only to just shut it off again. His pleasure was coming from her mental anguish, her need for more know it was all in his hands. He began to kiss and nibble at her whole body enjoying the taste of her skin. There kisses became more passionate as the time ticked away. Finally he let her show him how she pleasured herself. She began to put on a show for him. The coldness of the chains stroking her skin, the noise they made reminding her that she was his captive. Her mind was again fighting with her body, she had not masturbated in front of someone before and yet she was close to orgasm again. He told her to hold back to just keep it building deep within her. Her body was twitching and her legs were becoming weak. She finally asked permission to cum. He debated and was slow to answer but finally allowed her to go over the edge. She came hard and yelled out in her pleasures.
After she finally calmed down they laid in each others arms as the listened to music and relaxed. She still chained could still feel the power he over her. He had the keys to her freedom; she also knew she would be used more before the night was over. Finally he had her lay face down and asked if she had been hogtied, when she said no, he knew she was going to learn. He pulled her arms and legs up together and linked the chains together in to a hog tie. You could her soft �wow� leave her lips. 
He pulled her body down to the end of the bed and grabbed her chains and pushed himself deep in her body. All she could say was �yes please�. He used the chains to constantly pull her deeper on him. He could feel her inner muscles tighten around him, trying to milk him. Their bodies mixed together, the feelings of submission and loving touches drove her body pleading for more. His eyes watching this beautiful woman all locked away under his control drove his passion more. She was yelling out her pleasure wanting it harder and yet enjoying his soft tease of gently sliding in and out of her. Soon he pulled the chains harder, her arms feeling the tightness in her muscles with each pull. She began to orgasm over and over. Each time she came her muscles would tighten down harder on him soon both collapsed in deep orgasms together. He lay down beside her ash she continued to lay the in her hogtie. He body feeling week but unable to move. He finally released her from the strenuous position allowing her to relax slightly still in her binds.

The kissed and enjoyed each other for a few more hours before he curled her up on her side. He pulled himself up behind her warm body and cradled her in his arms. Feeling each breath she took and the sweet scent of her skin. As they both started to fall asleep with the rattle of the chains with each slight move she made. They slept in a wonderful dream of the next time they have together.
