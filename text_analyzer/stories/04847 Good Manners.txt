Synopsis:
The Danish public last told patience with the youth drinking, having sex and
destroying property. So new and tuff laws are passed in the government and this
is the story about a young man being put through the system. (13-09-2006: This is part one only. Work is in

Good manners

&nbsp;

1. In
court

&nbsp;

As the
final of the three youngsters stood before the judge in the courtroom they all
joked loudly. The whole trail had been influenced by their disturbing conducts.

&nbsp;

The judge
announced the conviction: �Ahmed Hussein: It is the decision of this court that
you have broken several laws regarding normal conduct.�

&nbsp;

�First you
have evaded the draft laws of 2010. You were supposed to undergo the first two
parts of the draft program last summer in order achieve status as adult. This
has not happened.�

&nbsp;

�Secondly
several reports of you shouting foul words at girls down at the bus station.�

&nbsp;

�And then
you forced a girl to give you blowjobs because she was wearing a mini-skirt,
which made her a prostitute in your eyes.�

&nbsp;

�You have
shown every sign of not becoming respectable citizens in your grownup life. The
court would change that. You are going to turn 18 in a couple of month and in
order to save you from ending up in prison sooner or later for years, we are
going to send you to one of the new behaviour modification centre for a crack
course in understanding the burden of being female, ordinary good manners and
doing the parts of the draft, you were suppose to do according to the law. Take
them way.�

&nbsp;

2. Ahmed

&nbsp;

Some months
ago the Danish parliament became tired of the impudent behaviour of the young
people when they spoke to each other. Words like �Bitch�, �hooker� etc. have
become almost common in every sentence and had polluted the beautiful Danish
language. In the old days young ladies have been treated with respect. Those
days had gone and the parliament wanted to do something about it.

&nbsp;

Almost
every citizen in Denmark knew what was wrong. Sometime back
in the 60�s the intellectual elite in Denmark had it out with the strict morale
and norms that were present in Denmark at that time. Everyone became
afraid from making demands and slowly it became clear that both youth and
newcomers to the Danish society had lost respect for the values and laws in the
country.

&nbsp;

The new law
issued a zero-tolerance against rude behaviour and cruel language between
people under 18. In schools the pupils would be put before the new students
courts established in all schools. Often the punishment would be removal of
litter, weeding out in the beds around the school or even cleaning toilets. 

&nbsp;

However,
while it worked for most parts some people would not learn. Take Ahmed for
instance. He had been hanging out with mates since he was 14. His family had
stayed in Denmark for 30 years and neither his mother
nor his father did speak Danish very good. Needless to say, Ahmed was soon
regarding himself as the man in the house. His parents tried all they could to
make him stay home after one of the elderly had told his parents about him lying
toward them about the fact that it was OK and normal for kids of his age to
stay out all night. But as soon they were at sleep he sneaked out.

&nbsp;

Domestic
corporal punishment is forbidden in Denmark and because his parents had failed
the use of alternative disciplining on him in time, he lived a life with other
kids establishing themselves an alternative community
with values of their own. After a while he skipped school and even though the
society�s response was to cancel the child maintenance all parents in Denmark
got, his parents was not able to control him.

&nbsp;

But then
there was the incident of him and some of his mates forcing a girl to give them
blowjobs. The police arrested him and because he was the only one that had not
completed the draft program, he could not get off by a short period in
isolation while writing an apology to the girl and a written acceptance of
guilt, wearing a chastity belt and doing community service for a period.

&nbsp;

So now he
was his way on to one of the new behaviour modification centres. He was a kind
of nervous because exactly what was going on there was a kind of secret.

&nbsp;

3. Arrival in the centre

&nbsp;

�Step in
line.�

&nbsp;

Ahmed stood
in a line of youngsters - a mix of boys and girls � all waiting for it becoming
their turn. One by one they were called into some examination rooms. Sometime
screams were heard from inside but for the most they just called the next in.
Ahmed became more nervous. Finally it was his turn.

&nbsp;

�Ahmed
Hussein. Go to room number two!�

&nbsp;

When he
went inside two guards and a doctor greeted him. 

&nbsp;

�Take all
your clothes of and lie on the table on your stomach! Hurry!�

&nbsp;

As he lied
down the guards fastened some cuffs at his wrist and his feet. �We want to
check you for hiding drugs. Relax.�

&nbsp;

�Where am I
supposed to hide anything? I am naked�, he thought. The he felt a pain in his
behind. �Ow! It hurts. Stop!�

&nbsp;

�Sorry. But
we have to stick this tube containing a mini-camera up in your rectum. We have
seen people hiding small packages containing drugs up there. Just relax and it
would be over in just a few minutes.�

&nbsp;

Some
seconds the pain lessened and it only took a short while before they were
satisfied. So they redrew the tube and released him from the cuffs. Soon he was
back on his feet again.

&nbsp;

�Stand
still. I am going to measuring your waist for the chastity belt.� 

&nbsp;

�Wait a
minute. Why am I going to wear a belt? I am locked up here. I can not be with
any girl.�

&nbsp;

�In fact a
large part of this program is making your understand the relationship between
male and female, so we would avoid pregnancies and sexual transmitted diseases.
Step over here. This plastic belt with straps is for measuring only. The real
belt is made of steel covered with neoprene. If you make trouble we would cuff
you.�

&nbsp;

They
measured him and found a belt. �See, you penis goes into this tube. Once put
inside it would be painful if it become erected so that would not happen.� 

&nbsp;

�It is too
tight. I can hardly breathe!�

&nbsp;

�No. One
this program, you will be put on a tight exercise program combined with healthy
food. You will loose weight and the waist belt would not be tight after a week.
Properly it would be necessary to change the size to a smaller during the
program.�

&nbsp;

�What about
relief? It is well known that long periods of denial would result in an
increased cancer-risk. It is not fair that you will condemn me to an illness
that could be fatal.�

&nbsp;

�You do not
have to worry. We have taken precautions in order to prevent that from happen.
You are finished here. Go trough that door so you can begin phase 1.�

&nbsp;

4. Phase 1: Living as a
girl

&nbsp;

a) Dressing up

&nbsp;

A guard
accompanied him as we went down a long corridor. �Dressing room number 8: In
here!�

&nbsp;

�Hey. This
is not right. This is a dressing room for girls.�

&nbsp;

The entire
room was covered from wall to wall like a woman clothing shop. Two matrons
greeted him: �Welcome. You are Ahmed Hussein and you have come to the right
place. You are going to be dressed as a girl for the next week. Please,
cooperate or we would restrain you.�

&nbsp;

He began to
sob. �It can not be right. This is humiliating.�

&nbsp;

�Just as
humiliating as the girls felt you teased in the street? Just as humiliating as
the girl felt you forced into giving you a blowjob? Please to over to that
bar.� As he stood under the bar, they once again cuffed him at his wrist and
feet. �Try to hold on to the bar. Although it is suspension cuffs, it would be
easier if you hold on.� They began to raise the bar so he was pull up and
eventually he was stretched out.

&nbsp;

�First the corset. I can see that they have measured you to 28 inches, so 24 would be
fine.� They began to lace it on his behind.

&nbsp;

�Stop. It
is too tight. You are going to cut me in half.�

&nbsp;

But without
world they ignored his protests and after a while he could only produce a
silent grunt when they pulled.

&nbsp;

�You have
to hang on for 5 minutes so the fabric can adjust before we take it the final
step.� They stepped over and drank a cup of coffee while they waited for the
time to pass. Ahmed hanged quietly with tears running down his face.

&nbsp;

�Let�s be
done.� They continued to pull. A couple of time he passed out but the guards
revived him with smelling salt every time. Finally they were satisfied with the
result and lowered him to the floor.

&nbsp;

�Now for the rest of the underwear. Here is a pair of pants.�

&nbsp;

Ahmed
dressed and lets his hands feel the surface of the corset. It felt strange and
he could not bend over with pain in his lower stomach. 

&nbsp;

�Here is a
dress. I will give you a helping hand with the zip in the back.� It was an all
pink dress reaching down to her knees. 

&nbsp;

�Then there
are the pink knee-high stockings and matching shoes. When you are done it is
over to our hairdresser and the photo shoot.�

&nbsp;

Ahmed
followed the guard out of the office. He had his head down. Never in his life
had he felt so low. Him dressed up as a girl, was
almost too much. When they came to the hairdresser he was ordered into a chair
and once again they put on some restraints. �We are going to give you some hair
extensions. We cannot give you rats' tails without adding a little length. When
we are done with your hair, it is time for your makeup. During this week you
will be able to do it yourself, so pay attention.�

&nbsp;

�You must
be kidding. I would never put makeup on by myself. You must be dreaming. It
would never happen.�

&nbsp;

�We will
see. It will happen. You will do it by your own will. Just wait and see.�

&nbsp;

After a
while the hairdresser announced. �We are done. Look in the mirror.�

&nbsp;

Ahmed
looked and almost lost his jaw. They have turned him into a girl. He began to
cry.

&nbsp;

�Don�t cry.
It would ruin your makeup. Now I would release you and show how we would except you to follow orders.�

&nbsp;

As he stood
up a guard came with a belt with a black box on. �What is that?� 

&nbsp;

�Wait and
see. You have properly noticed that the fabric in the back of the corset feels
a little stiffer and different than the rest of the corset. That is because
small and tiny threads of conductive metal had been weaved into the corset just
outside the kidney area. Also in your dress there are holes in the back to we
can connect wires to the conductive area. These wires we connect to the box.
The name of the device is called Graduated Electronic Decelerator also called
GED.�

&nbsp;

�Back in
the 1990s the now famous Judge Rotenberg Educational centre in Massachusetts started to threat wrong behaviour of
children with mild symptoms of autism, ADHD and emotional problems with
electrical shock. This treatment had shown to be successful in adjusting almost
every kind of bad behaviour and we in Denmark have also copied it. This unit
delivers 45-milliamp shocks for 2 seconds. It would send you to the floor and I
would recommend that you behave. Do not test us. We would not hesitate to use
it. All rooms are monitored and the device has an alarm that would inform us if
you try to remove it. Now it is in place and activated. We would need a photo
of you to put on the control, so we by mistake don�t activate the wrong
control. Stand still.�

&nbsp;

The guard
took a photo and then it was time for Ahmed to leave for his room.

b) Tugging in

&nbsp;

�Here are
you room. You have your own toilet. Please notice that the door does not have a
lock. It is not necessary because it is monitored and the hallway has a
detector that tells us if someone is moving around.�

&nbsp;

�Over here
is your bed. Bedtime is 9 p.m. and we expect you to stand with your face
against the wall at that time when the guard enters the room in order to help
you with the dress. Here is a typical program of the day of the first week.�

&nbsp;

6 a.m.: The alarms sounds.
Leave your bed and face the wall. A guard would be around and release your from
the sleeping belt and the gloves. Then we expect you to wash and use the
toilet.

7 a.m.: Breakfast in your room. A tray would be
placed in front of the door.

8 a.m.: Teaching in manners and ordinary
housekeeping.

11 a.m.: Makeup course

12 a.m.: Lunch in your room

1 p.m.: Teaching elementary school syllabus adjusted
to those needs you have according to the information we have received from your
former school.

6 p.m.: Dinner in your room.

7 p.m.: Free time until 9 p.m., which you should spend in your
room working on an apology to your parents for your behaviour.

&nbsp;

�I do not
owe anything to my parents.�

&nbsp;

�You don�t
know exactly how well-treated you have been. Those nice parents don�t deserve a
son like you. But you would wish that you would have listen
to them. Sit down and eat your dinner. I would be back at 9.p.m. I would except you to stand facing the wall as instructed or�.� He
pointed at the control-box in his belt.

&nbsp;

Ahmed ate
his dinner quietly. This place was horrible. They had dressed him up as a girl.
He had to sit down if he wanted to urinate. It was so shameful. 

&nbsp;

He turned
on the computer. A welcome message said that the only program installed was a
word processor with an email function and there was no Internet access. However
emails had to been sent to the office, which would send them to their
destination.

&nbsp;

He wrote a
small letter to his parents. It was simple:

&nbsp;

�Get my
lawyer! They mistreat me here. They are abusive and it is inhuman. Please help
me.�

&nbsp;

After he
had written his letter he sat and look at the wall
until a sound signalled that it was time to face the wall.

&nbsp;

A guard
came in and helped him undress and put a leather belt around his waist. Then he
was told to take on two leather gloves on, which were attached to the belt. Now
he would be unable to fiddle with the corset. It was time to sleep.

&nbsp;

c) Disobedience

&nbsp;

After a day
of the humiliating program, a guard called for him. �Ahmed. We have a special
task for you. As a part of the punishment you are going to experience a part of
the ordeal you have put your victim through. Come with me.�

He was led
into a room. �What is that?�

&nbsp;

�That is an computerized artificial penis and scrotum. It is made out
of latex with a sensors placed all over it. Your task is to give it a blowjob
like you forced that poor girl too. Because we are nice you are allowed to pull
a condom over it. What flavour would you prefer? Chocolate or
strawberries?�

&nbsp;

�I wont do it!�

&nbsp;

�I did not
hear you�

&nbsp;

�I wont ��
A shock send him to the floor. �You zapped me!� It felt like being kicked in
the kidneys. It seemed like going on forever. Lying on the floor he cried out.
�It hurts.�

&nbsp;

�I did not
hear you�

&nbsp;

�I wont ��
A second shock made him lying convulsing on the floor.

&nbsp;

�I did not
hear you�

&nbsp;

�Strawberry
flavour!� he sobbed.

&nbsp;

�Here.
Tease it so the erection would make the condom be pulled over it and start your
blowjob. You seem out of practice. By the end of this week you have to make it
come in two minutes or next week would be the same as this week.�

&nbsp;

He began to
suck after having fitted the condom and it tasted awful. Strawberry flavour �
where? 

&nbsp;

�Try to
touch the area just behind the scrotum. Did the poor girl not teach you
anything? What a sissy you are.�

&nbsp;

Tears began
to roll down his check. It was noticed.

&nbsp;

�Why are
you sorry? You seems to think that it must be
wonderful for the women to do it to you.�

&nbsp;

Finally the
computer decided that his job was fulfilled and a warm liquid appeared inside
the condom.

&nbsp;

�Good job.
Perhaps you can develop into a good cocksucker after all. Don�t you feel lucky
that is was only a blowjob you forced the poor girl into doing.�?

&nbsp;

d) Milking

&nbsp;

The first
week was almost over. If he passed the test tomorrow then he would move onto
phase 2. The doctor approached him and called for him.

&nbsp;

�Ahmed. It
has been about 6 days since you arrived here. Because you have the big exam
tomorrow we have decided that you get relief today. We would not expose you to
the risk of getting prostate cancer. Come with me.�

&nbsp;

As they
went into an examination room he was told to undress and stand in his corset
and chastity belt only. 

&nbsp;

�Sit down
on this chair.� It was a strange chair. There was a kind of hole in the chair.
As he sat they strapped him with leather straps at his wrist, his feet and over
his chest. 

&nbsp;

�When am I
going to get the belt off?�

&nbsp;

�You are
not�

&nbsp;

�But how
can I get relief then. My penis is locked up. I need to get release. I can�t
stand it anymore. Please!�

&nbsp;

�Just wait
and see. But we can not have you shouting during the process.�

&nbsp;

Quickly he
produced a ball-gag and shoved it into Ahmed�s mouth. Ahmed tried to protest
but the gag only let out mumbled sounds. The doctor moved behind the chair and
suddenly Ahmed had a reason to protest even more. Something was pushed against
his sphincter. 

&nbsp;

�Relax, it
is a special device called aneros or generally known as a prostate massager. I
am going to insert it in your rectum and provoke your prostate into releasing
the semen. I would not be unpleasant once it happens. However, it can hurt a
little while it is inserted.�

&nbsp;

The doctor
began to work with the massager and due to the long time of denial, it only
took a minute before Ahmed came. It was a huge disappointment. It only felt
like peeing slowly. Ahmed cried. Before he got arrested he used to yank it off
several times a week and he had missed it so much. Even as he was released he
continued to sob.

&nbsp;

�Cheer up. Lets get over and choose the clothes for the exam tomorrow.
Your task is to walk through a neighbourhood somewhere in Denmark dressed as a girl so you first hand
can experience how they feel when youngster like you bully and insult them.�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

e) Exam part 1 � walking
in domestic surroundings

&nbsp;

When he
woke he was a kind of worried. The clothes they had chosen for him would make
him look like a hooker. First there were the High-heels, which he had to walk
around in the cell for hours in order to avoid tripping in them. Then there was
the miniskirt. In fact, so short that it was difficult to hide the chastity
belt. Artificial breasts and the corset laced all it could, made
him look like a cheap tart. His hair have been coloured so it now was blond.

&nbsp;

With
difficulties he made it into his clothes and staggered a little around in order
to adjust the use of the shoes.

&nbsp;

�Come on.
You are going to walk two routes in your hometown. The first route is from the
local bus station to your parent�s block. However, you are not going to visit
them but you will continue down past the public school and through the football
field to the sports centre, where we will pick you up and drive you to the
starting point of route number two.�

&nbsp;

�No. You
cannot make me do that. I would get laughed at and I could be recognized. I
won�t!� 

&nbsp;

�I did not
hear you.� The guard opened the box for the remote control.

&nbsp;

Ahmed sunk
his head. �I will comply.�

&nbsp;

�You should
not be nervous about being recognized. We have redone your hair and with
exaggerate use of makeup you should hardly be recognized if you don�t speak.
Come now. If you fail it would be another week just like the last one before
you have a second chance to pass the test.�

&nbsp;

After
having given Ahmed the final touch with makeup and hairstyle, they drove of to
his hometown. He stood out at the bus station and began to walk to his previous
home. He thought about his former friends �Please. Do be at work.� But in his
heart he knew that they like him self had not done a single day of hard work in
their life. He began to sweat as he continued his staggered walk on high heels.
Damn foundation! It used to consist of paving stones but they have often used
some of the stone to through them at the police and fire brigade whenever they
had errands in this part of the town. Now the footpath was more dirt than
paving stones and that made it difficult for him to walk.

&nbsp;

�Hey. Look
at that tart!� It was Epu � a little guy about 12 years old. Some of his friend
soon joined him. �May we squeeze those melons?�

&nbsp;

Oh � why
had they chosen a D-cup? He tried to feminize his voice the best he could.
�Fuck off!�

&nbsp;

But they
did not let him go. They grabbed his arm and suddenly there were five of them.
They dragged him into the bushes and forced him down on his back. One of them
pulled his trousers of. �What is that?� They looked in disbelief as they saw
the chastity belt. One of then noticed a bit of his scrotum
at sticking out. �He is a male. Who are you? No one shall make fun of
us. We would kick your ass 14 days into next week.�

&nbsp;

�Stop. I
am Ahmed. I am forced to walk around like this. Don�t hurt me. Leave quickly
they are monitoring me from a distance.�

&nbsp;

�Ahmed !!!? It cannot be true. You are no sissy. Why have you
let them do this to you? Why did you not resist.�

&nbsp;

�I have
some kind of electric shock device attached to my body. The same would happen
to you if you don�t get going. Leave now!!�

&nbsp;

Just as
they stood like frozen, looking at the bizarre sight, but then they got the
meaning of his word and began to run. But it was too late.

&nbsp;

�Stop or we
would tase you!� It was two police officers.

&nbsp;

In recent
year it had become clear that the police force could not rely on the use of
guns only. Lack of training and an old fashion way of stopping criminals had
resulted in the shooting of people that properly could have been arrested
without a fatal result. Back in 2006 a murderer had been driven by one of his
mates and the police got them selves placed so the officers felt as they were
in danger and had to shoot. More than 20 shots fired from two guns ended the
driver�s life. The criticisms lead to the introductions of tasers as an
alternative to the use of guns.

&nbsp;

The boys
stopped at once. The first officer came forward. �We did not mean that you
should stop all of you. Now we cannot have fun. I have almost been to long
since I used it last time. Even tough, it was fun to through tear gas into a
kindergarten at Christiania a taser fired over a wall into the same kindergarten also can result in
fun. I have been looking forward to shock you for a long time regardless the
cause.�

&nbsp;

The boys
remained still. Some of them wet their pants. They knew that they still were at
risk of being shocked after they have been handcuffed. On Youtube the police
forces all over the world had their own competition with home videos of how
funny people being tasered could look.

&nbsp;

The guard
from the centre came and helped Ahmed on his feet. �You have to dissociate from
this unfortunate event. The exam is still on and in fact this episode was
expected as a part of your therapy. If you would like a minute to adjust your
makeup it is OK, but then it is on the move again.�

&nbsp;

Ahmed
continued his walk. Soon he was at his parent�s doorstep. Just as he passed the
front door, his mother and sister came out. They hardly noticed him first.

&nbsp;

The
contrast of tartly looking women and Muslim women totally covered was very
normal in this neighbourhood. His sister should not even have been at home. His
parents had arranged her marriage for long time, but it could never be. News
laws had increased the claim for funds needed for settling in Denmark. Only Bill Gates would be a new
citizen after the last adjustment. So his parents were stuck with his sister
and both parties seemed to be happy with that arrangement.

&nbsp;

But after
some 20 meters you could almost see a lightning striking the women. They both
turned and look after Ahmed as he continued almost running to his destination.
Then they turned their faces against each other for a minute, but they shuck
their heads and continued.

&nbsp;

When he was
passing the bushes at the football field, his little brother bike passed him.
He did not dare to turn his head but looked straight ahead. He heard a voice
after a minute. �Ahmed. Is that you?�

&nbsp;

�Yes. But
you don�t say it to anyone. I would ring your neck if you do. I am forced to do
this or I would be electrocuted. What are you doing anyway? You should be in
school.�

&nbsp;

�I am
playing truant like you used to. I want to tough like you.�

&nbsp;

�Do I look
tough? Get you little sissy ass right over in school now or you will end up
like me. Go now! And not a single word, do you understand?�

&nbsp;

His brother
biked away very obvious very disturbed about this meeting.

&nbsp;

Finally he
came to the sports centre. When he entered the van, he asked �Where now?�

&nbsp;

f) Exam part II � finer
neighbourhood and rehabilitation

&nbsp;

�You next
assignment is to walk from this street and down along the wood to a large white
house with the number 187 on it. You will go in there and receive the rest of
your assignment. Go on.�

As he left
the van, he could see that he close to the beach. It was a totally other part
of the town. Large houses with well-kept gardens dominated the sight. It was
easier to walk here in those damn high-heels but he could feel that he had got
blisters so his feet hurt.

&nbsp;

Finally he
arrived at the house. �Miss. Jensen Convalescence Centre� the nameplate said.

�

A nurse
greeted him.� �Come in. We were expecting
you. Miss. Hussein. Take a seat in that office.�

&nbsp;

They
pronounced him as Miss. not Mister. They were making jokes
of him. He sat and waited for 5 minutes - then the nurse returned.

&nbsp;

�Stand up
and face the wall! They have sent over the control to your GED and if you make
problems it would be activated. Hands on your back!�

&nbsp;

He felt
some leather being pull over his arms. �What is that?�

&nbsp;

�It is an
arm binder. Stand still. I would fastens those straps going over your shoulder
and lace it tight.�

&nbsp;

�It is
tight. My arms are beginning to sleep.�

&nbsp;

�Yes. But
the task you are going to do requires that your arms be tied down. Look how it
makes your breast stand out. Come with me.�

&nbsp;

They got up
the stairs and went into a room. A girl sat in a bed with her back towards the
door.

&nbsp;

�Sarah. Look!
See who is coming to see you.�

&nbsp;

As she
turned, he recognized her. It was the girl they had forced into doing blowjobs.
As their eyes met, he saw the fear in her eyes. Even though, he was dressed up
as a girl in the most bizarre way, she still saw the molester that had
humiliated her that day.

&nbsp;

�Sarah!
Calm down. He cannot do anything to you. He is here for two reasons:�

&nbsp;

�First as
part of the punishment of violent people, it is the law that a confrontation
between victim and assailant has to be arranged. He is restraint in order to
even out the psychological balance between you. He is going to apologize for
his actions and you would also gain from it.�

&nbsp;

�That
brings us to the second part. Him being here and doing a favour for you would
contribute to your therapy. Men scare you and in order to restore your ability
to involve yourself in a relationship some day in the future, Ahmed is going to
help. Ahmed. Down on your knees.�

&nbsp;

�Can I get
some help? It is difficult in those high heels with my arms bound.�

&nbsp;

�Sure. Here
you are. Sarah! Open that bag that came yesterday and take the equipment on.�

&nbsp;

Sarah did
as told. It was a strap-on dildo. 

&nbsp;

�Sarah!
Move in front of Ahmed. Command Ahmed to lick the dildo just
as he commanded you.�

&nbsp;

�Ahmed.
Lick it.� Sarah sounded hesitant but she trusted the nurse.

&nbsp;

With tears
building up in his eyes, he licked it like he had done in training. First Sarah
also was at the edge of crying, but then she saw how Ahmed felt and soon she
began to feel in control. She pushed the dildo down his throat making him gag.

&nbsp;

�Ease up a
little. The purpose is not to strangle him.�

&nbsp;

Sarah
slowly began to smile. The nurse was a little surprise. Sarah had not smiled
since she was admitted. The therapy program was good for her.

&nbsp;

�Sarah. How
do you feel by making him serve you?�

&nbsp;

�I feel
like a human again. They had made me feel like a fuck toy instead of a human
being. Now I understand a little of their power trip. This turns me on. I
hadn�t a relationship since the mugging. I was a little active regarding the
sexual thing and I need to cum.�

&nbsp;

�That can
easily be arranged. By a fact I can remove the steel plate for the anus hole in
his chastity belt so you can access it.�

&nbsp;

�Is he
wearing a chastity belt?�

&nbsp;

�Yes it is
a part of his punishment. All male violent offenders are wearing a chastity
belt until they have completed an anger management course and if the crime also
involved a sexual act until the court decides that they no longer are a treat
to society. In the last case it could take years. I will remove the steel
plate. All his sucking must have lubricated the dildo sufficient. Ahmed! Stand
up and bend over that table.�

&nbsp;

�I wont do it. We only forced her into giving us a blowjob. We
did not get the chance to fuck her.�

&nbsp;

�You leave
me no choice.� She gave a signal up to a video camera at the wall; he didn�t noticed when he went into the room. He immediately felt it
like sticking his finger into an electrical socket for two seconds. The
tingling continued after the current was turned off.

&nbsp;

�You zapped
me!!�

&nbsp;

�It was the
opinion of the centre that the only reason you did not rape Sarah was because
the police turned up in the last minute. You WILL bend over. You WILL allowed her access to your sissy cunt or you WILL suffer a
shock more.�

&nbsp;

Sobbing he bend
over the table. The nurse took out a leather strap and fastened his body to the
table. His bed was also fastened.

&nbsp;

�Sarah!
Come over here. Let him lick your strap-on dildo once more. Ahmed! Your licking
is all the lubrication the dildo would get, so do your job fine or it would
hurt like hell.�

&nbsp;

Ahmed
licked the dildo so good that his drool ran down on the table. 

&nbsp;

�Sarah:
Move behind him and press slow against his sphincter. We would not hurt him for
life. Ahmed: Relax � if you taut, it will hurt a lot. Sarah:
Harder!�

&nbsp;

Ahmed began
to whine. �It hurts. You are going to split me info two!�

&nbsp;

�Sarah:
Ignore him. Press harder! Ahmed: If I had known that you were a squeezer, I
would have used your own high-heels to force your sissy cunt open.�

&nbsp;

Sarah
continued to work on Ahmed sphincter but as a virgin it was tight and Ahmed was
tense in every muscle, so the nurse took a tube of lubricant and smeared the
content on the dildo. Sarah tried once more. Ahmed was now crying like a little
baby. Suddenly it went in and Ahmed went quiet from the shock. 

&nbsp;

�Sarah!
Move forward and back in slow strokes. Let it work the whole way in slowly.�

&nbsp;

Sarah
followed the instruction and she worked as hard as she could. The table began
to move and the nurse had to sit on it. Suddenly a slow flow of semen began to
drip down from Ahmed�s belt. He was milked once more. He was so humiliated. All
that pain - All that stuff of being a girl � The stress of the constant risk of
being shocked � Him having a dildo up his ass � It became too much � He passed
out.

&nbsp;

�Oh. This
is good� Sarah was close to climax. �Yes. Ohhhhh�. She
came shivering for the first time since the mugging with her body covered from
sweat. Exhausted she fell in over Ahmed lifeless body until she caught her
breath again. She noticed his semen.

&nbsp;

�Is he a
gay or something?� Sarah withdrew the dildo uncovering a dildo with some blood
on it.

&nbsp;

�No. It is
quite common that a male can be stimulated in way that would result in prostate
milking. By your action today, I would prophesy that you have a chance for a
relationship at some point. Remember to control your man in the future so the
traumatic experience you have been put through don�t
come back to you reinforced.�

&nbsp;

---

&nbsp;

Ahmed woke
by the guard calling his name. �Congratulation. You
have passed the test. Lets go back to the centre to
discuss the next step in your rehabilitation plan.

&nbsp;

5. Phase 2: Performing
normal draft program part one

&nbsp;

a) First week: Basal aid
courses

&nbsp;

Ahmed stood
in the office of the behaviour camp manager. �Congratulation.
You have passed phase one as ordered by the court. You have helped our victim
in her recovering process. I hope you have learned some of the effect your
previous behaviour had on your victims. So you should be glad about the message
I have for you now: Your days as a girl are over. Go with the guard and he
would provide proper clothes for you.�

&nbsp;

Ahmed got
his hair shaved. All male students, which were not during phase
one, must be ball. Is also got a yellow boiler suit with �YOUTH CORRECTION INSTITUTE�
labelled on it. Then he was led to a classroom, where he should wait with other
some students.

&nbsp;

A Teacher
came in and started to welcome them. �You are here because you have eluded part
one of the Danish draft program. Some of the choices given in the program, you
are excluded from because you tried to avoid doing it. However this first three
weeks would be similar to the program, you would have gone through it you had
done it voluntary. We would start with three courses during the first week. 1)
A normal first aid course, 2) A special first aid course and last a fire
control course.� 

&nbsp;

Ahmed
participated without resistance. First he still wore the GED4. Second this was
not so bad comparing with all the harshness he had being going through in the first
phase. Some parts was even fun. He could not figure out why he had not done it
voluntary but he thought that the person he was before just did not care of
anything besides hanging out with his mates.

&nbsp;

During the
week he recognized a girl he had met time-to-time back in his own
neighbourhood. As he during one of the breaks talked to her, he got her story.
Ann as her name was had been hanging out with a girl gang and the group had
done some shoplifting as a method of spending time. Sometime they also had
jumped some gays in the local park, taking their money.

&nbsp;

One of they
gays had turned out to be an under-cover officer and she was tasered while she
tried to run away and was brought to the modification centre. She also wore the
GED4 and had been shocked for quite some times until she started to work with
the system instead of against it. Now she stood there in a pink pinafore dress
with rat's tail looking like a nine-year-old schoolgirl. It had taken him some
time to recognize her because her hair colour was not her normal dark brown
instead of pink. She seemed not very happy and he felt like trying to comfort
her. It was in a way somehow strange because normally he did not care for
anyone but himself.

&nbsp;

�How are
you feeling?�

&nbsp;

�This place
is so horrible. They forced me to remove my piercings and dyed my hair. I got
to wear a chastity belt and it had been hard because I used to satisfy myself
almost every evening. I tried to resist, but at a point I could not stand being
shocked anymore and now I am just going along like a robot. What about you?�

&nbsp;

�The
previous phase was so horrible, that I would not speak about it. This phase
feels like relaxation.�

&nbsp;

He hugged
her and they both were on the edge of breaking into tears, when the teacher
told them to resume with their work.

By the end
of the week they were together whenever they had the possibility. Their ability
to bond was not unnoticed by the staff and reports went back to their hometown,
where the authorities had discovered a serious offence.

&nbsp;

b) Solving a felony 

&nbsp;

Saturday
they would normally have been confined to their cells most of the days. All the
students in the centre had been skipping schools for a long time so a part of
the program was to catch up with their schoolwork, so they would leave the
facility at the same level, as they would have been if they had attended school
like almost all other children.

&nbsp;

But Ahmed
was called to a meeting in the manager�s office. In the hallway he met Ann and
together they went into the office.

&nbsp;

Inside the
office some guards but also his parents and as it turned out Ann�s parents was
waiting. They were all sitting quietly look down in the floor.

&nbsp;

The manager
took the word. �As a part of the investigations of your crime, we did a house
search and confiscated your computers. On the computer we discovered that your parents long time ago had made arrangements for you to
marriage local people from your family�s old countries. As you properly know,
arrangement of marriage for children under 18 is illegal and would result in prison
time for your parents. They would face at least 5 years in prison both if they
do not cancel this arrangement.�

&nbsp;

�So we took
the liberty of offering them a deal. If they agreed to cancel the arrangement
and let you two marriage instead just as an extra
precautions against them watching for an opportunity to get you out of Denmark and letting the marriage be done
there, they would not end up in prison. They agreed and now we are here. I am
licensed to perform the marriage ceremony and there is no need to delay it any
further. If you do not want your parents to go to prison it is time now. What
do you say?�

&nbsp;

Ahmed
dropped his jaw. �I am not ready to marry anyone.�

&nbsp;

Ann also
shook her head. �I do not know Ahmed that well.�

&nbsp;

The manager
cut in. �Either of you did properly know who your future husband or wife would
be. As I see it you would not end worse up if you decide to go ahead and your
parents would stay free. Why not give it a try? After some years you could
always get a divorce. And you will be freed from your chastity belts for one
night.�

&nbsp;

�Give me
some minutes with Ann in the hallway.�

&nbsp;

�That is
OK.�

&nbsp;

They went
out in the hallway.

&nbsp;

�I feel
betrayed by my parents. Of course I knew that I would end up with a girl
someday but I have always pointed out towards them that the choice should be
mine and mine only. What about you?�

&nbsp;

�I knew
that they had a guy for me. When I came to think of it, it was the reason why I
began to hand out after school. We had a huge fight when I was forth teen and
they spanked me so well that my school discovered it and fined them. They even
had a visit every week from the social department just to ensure that I did not
kept being beaten up and the authorities confiscated my passport. I lost
respect for them and without them having possibility to spank me, I did as I did think fit. They had talked about me
having a holiday next year in our old country and now I understand that it was
a trick to force my into a marriage with my half retarded cousin.�

&nbsp;

�Why don�t
we marry then - just to show the old folks who is in charge?�

&nbsp;

�It is OK
with me. But no sex tonight other than oral - Can I trust you?�

&nbsp;

�OK�

&nbsp;

They
returned to office and in a manner of minutes they said yes to each other.
Their parents were quite during the entire ceremony. Just occasionally tears was seen on their mothers. When the ceremony was over
they parted with their parents. It was clear that it had not been an easy
decision for the parents to make. Now the parents would not be able to visit
their old country because breaking up an arranged marriage is regarded deeply
shameful.

&nbsp;

That
evening when they were in Ahmed bed they hugged and they both felt like
discovering their own body now free from the belt for the first time in many
days.

&nbsp;

Ahmed kept
his promise of oral sex only. Fortunately Ann showed her self to be an expert
of handling his cock. Her gentle tongue brought him pleasure and when she
touched the skin slightly just behind his scrotum, he came at once.

&nbsp;

�Touchy!�

&nbsp;

�It have been a week ago, since I got relief last time. If I
work on you now perhaps we can to it once more afterwards.�

&nbsp;

�OK. Lie
down on your back. I want to be in control.� She positioned herself so he got
her cunt just in his head.

&nbsp;

�Start to
lick. NOW!�

&nbsp;

What a
temper. But he wanted to have one more shoot later even by the fact that he had
not done this before. Sex for him had always been about him.

&nbsp;

�Can you
not stretch your tongue more? I want you to taste my juices.� 

&nbsp;

Ahmed did
the best he could inexperienced as he was. Ann instructed him and after a while
she came with a shout. �Dig in your tongue! Drink!� Oh. This is good.� Ahmed felt her juices
running down his cheeks. 

&nbsp;

Ahmed had
to wash his face in the sink before Ann took care of his need once more. She
took his cock in his mouth and in a short while it hardened. Soon he was
brought to a climax and he was rewarded for the second time.

&nbsp;

When he was
about to sleep he had once last comment to Ann. �The only problem of sleeping
in this place is that you know that you eventually have to wake up in the
morning.�

&nbsp;

Ann nodded.

&nbsp;

c) The baby

&nbsp;

�Welcome to
the second week of the draft program. Denmark largest resource is the people
living inside our country and their ability to bear children and bringing them
up. Your task this week is to simulate pregnancy and taking care of an infant
child during it first months. We are lucky to have an equal number of male and
female so you can team up two and two. By the way: Congratulate Ann and Ahmed.
They got married this weekend.�

&nbsp;

They
students applauded them and the teams were formed. Ann and Ahmed were of course
teamed up. Then the male and female were separated. Ahmed found himself in a
gym together with the other boy in front of an instructor. �Your task here is
to undergo physical exercises like pregnant women do. In order to make you
understand just how hard it is we have these pregnancy simulator vests. The
half of you would perform the exercise and the other half would support as
husbands do. Then you switch.�

&nbsp;

It was hard
to do cable lying leg-hip raise and crunches with the huge vest strapped on.
They all were exhausted when they were done. �Now join your female partner.
They had been learning about smoking, alcohol and pregnancy in the meantime,
while you have exercised. They would have a hard time for the next 24 hours.
They would have to carry the vest all the time and you job is to support them.
However before you go to your cell they also must complete the exercise
program. Support them as best as you can. You know the drill.�

&nbsp;

After the
exercise Ahmed followed Ann back to the cell. She complained about back pain
and nor sooner was they back in the cell before he had to massage her feet.
�What a relief! I don�t get why we have to be trained in becoming a parent. I
certainly would not become pregnant. I was on the pill before I got caught.�

&nbsp;

�I don�t
get it either. Perhaps it has something to do with the fact a lot of girls end
up as single moms, but I feel it like an undeserved punishment. Try to sleep.�

&nbsp;

�I would,
but it is difficult with 30 pounds on your stomach.�

&nbsp;

The next
day it was time exchanging the vests into computerized dolls. Everybody got a
doll. It had a computer inside and each doll was connected with a sender so a
student could take care of his own doll only. For the next three days they had
to continue their normal schoolwork in their cell while they random,
individually had to feet, comfort, and change diapers on the doll. Each day
they would go to the classroom where a data would be distracted from the doll
and computer printout with data of how well the dolls �need� were met.

&nbsp;

Needless to
say the some of the dolls did show shaken-baby syndrome. Such syndrome and
coarse neglect were rewarded by an electrical shock. Ann and Ahmed tried their
best and they were only met with minor reprimands. However, by the end of the
week Ahmed could not tell the difference between night and day, because he by
chance and got a doll programmed with colic. Now he truly could feel exactly
how hard a single mom must have it.

&nbsp;

After they
had passed the program, Ann went to see Ahmed. As they rested in each other
arms they both promised each other that children were not on the program for
many years.

d) Ending phase 2

&nbsp;

The last
leg of the first part of the Danish draft program sounded easy. First they had
a course in conflict resolution, which lasted a day. This course was introduced
because the police had been busy with street fights every time one of the
Danish cities had a civic festival. Also the increased traffic had resulted in
a lot of incidents involving road rage.

&nbsp;

The last
course was passing a bicycle designed for children with an age of 12. However
most of the students had not owned a bicycle or they had lost respect for the
laws. Ahmed crashed two times and left the course scrapes on the elbow and knee.

&nbsp;

However,
his spirit had change. When he came to the centre, we saw society as an enemy
as a whole. He was reluctant from doing any thing. Now he took on an assignment
with enthusiasm. A part of him felt pride with the tasks completed.

&nbsp;

6. Free weekend with the
family.

&nbsp;

On Friday
the manager came to his cell. Ann was there too. He had a message for Ahmed:
�You do show so good result that we have decided that you can go home for the
weekend. I have sent the local police and the court an email, so they would not
arrest you, if they stop you. However the chastity belt must stay on. The court
feels that it is still too risky to let your cock loose in society. If you come
back here on Sunday afternoon, we would grant you a night of in your cell with
Ann. She is free to travel with you in your company. But you have to travel
together. You would both have a transmitter cuffed to your legs and a loud
alarm would go off if you go more than 10 meters from each other. What do you
say?�

&nbsp;

�Of course
we will.�

&nbsp;

Ann and
Ahmed took the bus back to his city. It was however not a warm welcome they had
when they went to see his family. His father was angry.

&nbsp;

�I have
been told that you should have been here last week dressed up as a sissy. Some
children told their father about you after they had been released onto
community service. Your mother did see a tart looking like you but of course
they did not put two-and-two together. Last and not least our plan with you and
marriage was destroyed because the authorities interfered. I have most respect
and my position in our society. You can stay for coffee, but when your
punishment one day is over, I would have to ask you to leave this house.�

&nbsp;

Ahmed
became upset. �First of all that dressing up was a part of my
punishment. Don�t even think for a minute that I liked it. Secondary I
feel betrayed. At no point can I remember that it was OK for you to choose who
that is going to be my wife. As for leaving the house, you can regard my
departure as starting now. Contact the behaviour centre and make arrangement
for my stuff to be stored somewhere in the city. As for respect in this
society, you did not have one at any point. Back in your homeland, you could
say that you had some kind of position. Here in Denmark you are a loser that no one can
respect. Why did you think my path of the rail got started? I have only one
thing to say to you and that is goodbye.�

&nbsp;

Then they
left.

&nbsp;

�Where to now?� Ahmed stood outside his parent�s front door.

&nbsp;

�We could
go to my family. Perhaps they are not so angry.�

&nbsp;

Ann�s
parents were a kind of relieved. In a fact they had felt obligated to arrange
the marriage to a local man under pressure from their family. The interference
of the authorities had taken them of the hook. However, still there were
problems. Even if they accepted that the matter of a husband for their daughter
was out of their hands, they could not have Ann and Ahmed staying there
forever. It was OK for this weekend, but in the long term they had to find
another place to stay.

&nbsp;

7. Phase 3. Pony cart
service

&nbsp;

a) A new beginning

&nbsp;

When they
returned to the centre they had a long talk with the manager. Youth homes were
not exactly growing on the threes. The manager phoned round and found a
solution. It was not an easy one.

&nbsp;

Back when
the population got tired of the anarchy regarding the population upholding the
laws, traffic offender could be ordered to do pony cart service. People caught
speeding or people, which had cause bodily harm to
others in traffic could be ordered to serve inside the city centres. The pony
cart service actually solved two problems. 

&nbsp;

In year
2015 the traffic system broke down due to heavy traffic. The Old Danish cities
were not built to handle the intense traffic of the twenty-first century. So
the solution was simple. No traffic by car during the day or evening. Only
deliveries could be made during the night. An army of bicycle taxis and pony
cart serviced the city centres during the day. 

&nbsp;

Both Ann
and Ahmed lacked to do the second part of the Draft program. Normally they could
have chosen between being a voluntary teacher in public school, but they would
have needed higher grades. They could also have worked in a home for elderly or
a kitchen in a shelter. But their need for a roof over their heads meant that
they only had the choice of the pony cart service.

&nbsp;

�I don�t
like it at all. I have heard that the ponies start every day by having an enema
and a butt-plug rammed up in their behind. I have even heard rumours of teeth
removal.�

&nbsp;

�That is
correct, but a butt plug is on mandatory for offenders and teeth removal does
only apply for those who have killed people in the traffic. Because they would
usually serve for 1-3 years every day depending of how sincere they took
responsibility for their crimes, they got two of their teeth in the upper mouth
removed to make better space for the bit. You would as a part of the draft
program only serve 4 months and you will have two days off every week. Instead
of the daily enema and insertion of a butt-plug, you would have the choice of a
diaper.�

&nbsp;

�But both
Ann and I have been convicted in a court of law. We are a
offenders.�

&nbsp;

�That is
also correct. But I have spoken to the judge and your family�s reluctance to
help you being rehabilitated had meant that he had changed his verdict so you
now in fact are on probation. That meant that we could get you an small public own apartment where the tenancy agreement is
attached to your future job.� 

&nbsp;

�So now we
have a roof over our head.�

&nbsp;

�Yes. Only
one problem remains. The judge still feels that we need more assurance
regarding your sexual behaviour before you can go without the chastity belt and
Ann are also still going to wear her belt until she
had undergone anger management therapy.�

&nbsp;

�How can we
get rid of those?�

&nbsp;

�The judge have ruled that you can see a therapist next week and
if he decide that your behaviour pattern have changed so much that he can make
a statement of you being safe for the society, the belt would be gone. As for
Ann - Her therapy starts Monday and if she works with the therapist, her belt
would have been gone in one or two days. Now go � instead of a Sunday
relaxation without the belt, you have a Sunday of hard work moving in your new
apartment. You can remove your GED4 and go. Here are the address and the keys.�

&nbsp;

Ann and
Ahmed went to the address. It was a small apartment consisting of two rooms. A
firm of furniture removers came with their stuff from their previous homes. By
the end of the day they were ready to start in their new service the next day.

&nbsp;

As they
went to bed they both were marked by a little fear of living outside the
behaviour centre. They have been shielded from the temptations and it was scary
to face them. It would be so easy to go off rail again.

&nbsp;

b) Pony cart training 

&nbsp;

Monday
morning they stood ready at the pony cart central. Mr. Harris, the manager
greeted them. �Please follow me. We would measure you for your harness.�

&nbsp;

After some
hours of measuring and trying on they stood ready. Their outfit was almost like
the same:

&nbsp;

Starting
from the head they had a red latex hood on with a ponytail of latex straps
going out from the top. They had a rubber bit in their mouth and in order to
preserve their identity they also had a blindfold over their eye with a small
opening, so they could see.

&nbsp;

On their
body they still wore their chastity belt. Then they had a red leather bodysuit
covering all their body (This part was for use in the colder part of a year
only). On the outside of the suit their were wearing
their pony harness. Basically it consist of a wide leather waist clincher with
straps going over the shoulders and front shield of leather covering their
genitals, which would be good to wear during the summer where it was common for
the ponies not to wear the leather bodysuit. Ann harness was slimmer and
consist of more leather straps. The got an artificial horsetail connected to
their waist clincher.

&nbsp;

Last their
hands ended up on their back in an arm binder.

&nbsp;

When they
were finished an instructor leaded them out in the yard. They would be pulling
a cart as a team. It meant that they had to corporate and understand each other
body signals because they ability to speech were very limited with the bits in
their mouth.

&nbsp;

As they
were connected to the cart by D-rings in the harness, Ann turned towards Ahmed
and said

�My arff
are beginning to sleef (My arms are beginning to sleep).�� Ann had an alarmed look in her eye and the
instructor came forward and calmed her.

&nbsp;

�Relax. It
is normal to experience difficultness regarding the ability to talk. You don�t
need to worry. It is not necessary to talk in order to do your job. Horses
don�t talk.�

&nbsp;

An
instructor took place in the cart and guided round on the field. Although they
had trained in the behaviour centre they were puffed after 15 minutes.

&nbsp;

The
instructor took their bit out and Ahmed commented. �It is hot and I am sweating
a lot. What about water and how about moving once bowels?�

&nbsp;

�First of all. We have staff checking you out at the cart ranks all over the town.
Each cart is issued with a GPS-tracking device and every time the staff give you something to drink they report in on a
palmtop, so no one dies of thirst.�

&nbsp;

�Second,
people can not order a cart outside the city centre. An alarm would sound if
the GPS shows that a cart is leaving the area. And every time a trip is done,
you are to return to the nearest cart rank. No one can hire you directly on the
street. That is a safety measure.

&nbsp;

�And for the moving of bowels. Most of the ponies have a butt plug with a
tail, so they only have needs to pee during the day. The alternative is a
diaper. I would recommend the last alternative because you for now only are on
contract for 4 months.�

&nbsp;

�But our
break is over. 15 minutes of more training with the cart and then it is over to
the walker for the rest of the day in order to strengthen your endurance.�

&nbsp;

�The walker?�

&nbsp;

�Yes. The
walker is a device where you is connected to and would have to walk in circles
lead my a leach to your harness.�

&nbsp;

Their bits
went in their mouth and they continued the training until late in the
afternoon. When they were in bed that evening, they fell asleep almost at the
same.

&nbsp;

c) In service

&nbsp;

It was a
Wednesday in June. They had been in service for 1 month and although it was
hard physically, they felt it rewarding and meaningful.

&nbsp;

Everyday
was exactly the same. About 6 a.m. they reported in for the fitting of
their costume and they were on the street an hour later just in time for the
rush hour. Then they serviced the citizens until 10 a.m. where the parked their cart at a
cart rank. A staff member freed them and they had a break of 30-60 minutes
depending of the temperature. Then they worked until 2 p.m. where other pony carts took the
late shift.

&nbsp;

The hardest
part of pulling the cart was starting up and in fact the cart was not driven by
human force. Magnets at the axle stored power during the trip and whenever the
cart started from a full stop a small electric motor gave the cart a small
computer controlled boost.

&nbsp;

As they
stood ready and connected with the cart after their break, they heard familiar
voices. It was Ahmed�s mother and sister. 

&nbsp;

�Let�s take
a cart to the department store. There is no reason to overtax your legs.� His
sister hurried his mother. As Ahmed turned towards the voices he almost got a
shock. His sister wore no veil. She had makeup on and look liked almost any
woman in her early twenties.

&nbsp;

His two
family members entered their cart and they rode to the department store. When
they dismounted the cart Ahmed turned and whistled after them shaking his head
in order to make them come closer. As they stood face to face they first asked
what was the matter and then unbuckled the bit, as
they understood that his was unable to talk with them as long as he had the bit
in his mouth.

&nbsp;

�It is I,
Ahmed�

&nbsp;

�You.
What are you doing in that outfit? Is it a part of your punishment?�

&nbsp;

�No - All that I am over and done with. I am doing it as a part of the draft
programme. It was our only choice because you threw me out of your home. Say
hello to Ann.� He nodded in her direction.

&nbsp;

�It was not
my idea. Your father became so angry. Not only did the authorities meddle in
your marriage arrangement. They also took a closer look at the situation of
your siblings. In the end he just left for his old village in his native land.
I got a life and your brother took more interest in his schoolwork by the aid
of a remedial teacher. Somehow your sentence turned out good for the whole
family. What about you after the draft programme? Would you like to return home
when the draft programme is over?�

&nbsp;

�No. I am
married to Ann and we live together as a couple. I am not moving back home. We
do not know what to do after the draft programme is over. However, we have a
final meeting with the judge and the manager of the behaviour modification
centre in 3 months in order to both evaluate the entire process and determine
some goals in our future. But for now we just concentrate about doing our
jobs.�

&nbsp;

�Well, now
you know that you are welcome for a visit. We would really like to talk about
all the things that had happened since we saw each other the last time.�

&nbsp;

�We will
phone you. Please, buckle the bit again. I can see a customer waiting for us at
the empty cart rank.�

&nbsp;

They
continued working and in the evening they called his mother and arranged a
visit in the weekend. The next Saturday they laughed and cried as Ahmed told
them of his time in the behaviour modification centre (He left the cock-sucking
part and his meeting Sarah out.) Also the draft programme commentated on.
Ahmed�s sister had taken an education as a health visitor. Now they could see
the purpose of it, because she told them of all the problems parents to
newborns faced.

&nbsp;

�You told
me that you were forced to wear some electrical punishment devices. Do you not
regard it as a kind of torture?�

&nbsp;

�I a way it
is. It hurt. It made you aware off your behaviour in a fearful way. However,
the alternative would have been countless confrontations and even fights with
the staff. I could have ended up in an isolation cell or having been restraint.
Seen in the light of the alternatives an electrical shock must be lenient.�

&nbsp;

His brother
was curious. �What about the bizarre outfit you are wearing at work? I had
heard that a part of the tail is suppose to enter your
butt!�

&nbsp;

�Yes, that
is correct for some ponies. But because we only do the pony service for 4 month
we use a diaper. It is not something we a proud of. But it is difficult to go
to a toilet, when you are hooked up to a cart.�

&nbsp;

�Can I come
over and see you dress? I am 16 next year and have to decide in what way I
would do my draft service.�

&nbsp;

�You may.
However, there is to many ways you can serve your
country. The draft programme has so many options. Our choices were limited by
our own action. By entering the programme voluntary you can choose the kind of
service which suits you best.�

&nbsp;

�I would
still like to see you dress.�

&nbsp;

�Your little kinky� But it OK. Be there punctual!�

&nbsp;

d) About not moving on in
life

&nbsp;

One
afternoon Ann was just finished doing two hours in the walker. Every week they
worked out and underwent examinations so possible injuries could be prevented.
Ahmed was seeing the doctor about a foot problem. Ann sat down at a table as
John came in.

&nbsp;

John was
one of the ponies convicted to stay in the service for at least a year. A year
earlier he had made the headlines all over Denmark when he killed a family on a
bicycle holiday when his car skidded out during a private and illegal drag
race.

&nbsp;

The Danish
law had been tightened and he received a judgement of 2-4 years in the penal
system depending of his progress during the sentence.

&nbsp;

As John sat
down, she noticed that he had a steel bite instead of a rubber bite. It also
looked like he was missing some teeth. When he was seated, a staff member
unbuckled the bite, so he could have some water. His cuffs with was fastened at
his harness were released and connect to a system of chains connected to a hook
in the floor instead.

&nbsp;

When he had
finished his drink, Ann spoke to him.

&nbsp;

�How are
you doing? I can see that you are on a more permanent assignment here. I heard
they came down hard on you.�

&nbsp;

�I am doing
fine now. First I was a kind of shocked by the judgement. It was an accident. I
was young and could not relate to the death of the family. But I was in for a
lesson. It had become mandatory for people like me to stay restraint in a chair
for a whole hour, while the family, co-workers and friend do a
here-are-you-life-kind-of-show for me. Everybody, who had met the victim during
his or her lives and at their death, can contribute to the show. I broke down
when the doctor showed pictures of the remains of the little boy or what should
I say the leftovers of him. I hardly heard the rest of it. They even had to
un-gag me during the show, because I had to throw up�

&nbsp;

�Un-gag you?�

&nbsp;

�Yes.
During the show you have a head harness on so you can not look away and because
lecturers must not be disturbed they put a muzzle on.�

&nbsp;

�Gruesome.�

&nbsp;

�Yes. But I
realised that my torment could not by any means be compared with the suffering
the remaining relatives must endure. It took a month for me to realize the full
extend of my crime and the preparation for the pony service was also hard.�

&nbsp;

�Why did
they pull out two of your teeth?�

&nbsp;

�Because
horses have a space among their teeth we human don�t have. So I lost two of my
teeth in the upper mouth in order to use a bit of steel. When I one day are
going to be release I would get some implants instead.�

&nbsp;

�What other
kind of preparation did you have to endure?�

&nbsp;

�First of
all my tail is in fact a butt plug with a tail on. They had me wear bigger and
bigger plugs for days until they decided on the final size. Every morning I get
an enema before the plug goes in. If I during the day built up stools, I just
have to hold out the stomach pain. Also my harness is rather different than
your. First of all it is very simple. It consists of a combined chastity belt
and a waist clincher, wide leather straps going from the clincher to my collar.
My hands are always collared and locked to the clincher in the side unless I am
eating like now. Then I am chained to something.�

&nbsp;

�I have
been there regarding the chastity belt. I was also convicted to wear one
because of a crime of violence in my past. I can remember how hard it was to
wait for my day of relief.� 

&nbsp;

�Yes, I
have milked every week for almost three month. My box in the stable has a bidet
so it is easy to keep it clean. The staffs wash me down two times every day.
However, I am only allowed to be satisfied on special occasions like Christmas
and my birthday and it is always with a machine. No human contact.�

&nbsp;

�That is a
harsh punishment!� 

&nbsp;

�Yes.
Sometimes I just wish that we were back some twenty years where a punishment
was about doing time in a prison and enjoy the drugs that were smuggled inside
but then I realise that I during my entire upbringing had done drugs and in
fact had a life without any meaning. Name a drug and I have been on it. I
started at a age of 12.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, back
then they did not force people to confront themselves with responsibility about
their actions. It was just a long wait.�

&nbsp;

�However,
as I see it I have come to peace with my actions and I live a good life without
drugs given the circumstances. In fact, I am somehow grateful being locked up
in my box every evening. No temptations can reach me here on the inside.
Although I miss being around people, it had saved my life. I would have ended
up in the gutter.�

&nbsp;

�When are
you going to be release?�

&nbsp;

�In fact I
am trying to postpone it. I am afraid of the outside world.�

&nbsp;

�I also
know that feeling. I have been there. It is al about gaining structure in your
daily schedule and getting a job. Work is everything.� 

&nbsp;

�They have
told me about it, but I am still afraid. Thanks however for your advice. Oh. I
can see that my break is over. I have to go. Thank you for taking time to talk
to me.�

&nbsp;

The staff
member came back and John had to leave for his shift.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

8. A new life.

&nbsp;

a) A job opening

&nbsp;

Hr. Harris
looked down in his papers. Both Ann and Ahmed had done well doing their draft
service. How could he keep them? By doing the draft service they also were out
of probation. They could go wherever they liked.

&nbsp;

As they sat
in his office, he had a proposal. �If you sign up for two years, we could
educate you to be instructors. You have your apartment for the next month and
if you sign up, you can keep the apartment until the end of your contract. We
have very satisfied with your work. What do you say?�

&nbsp;

�We would
like to accept the offer. We working here have eased the transition from an
institutionalised life to a normal life outside. Would we still work as ponies
during the education?�

&nbsp;

�Yes. I
would recommend a holiday before you start up. The education consists of parts
working as a pony, academic studies and training in motivating other. The only
part of you will avoid it having teeth being pulled out. All other aspect of the
service you have to try on your own body. Am I scaring you?�

&nbsp;

�No. We
have been through a lot.�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

b) Testing new equipment

&nbsp;

A month
later John lied tied up as Ann was testing tails on him. �How was the enema?�

&nbsp;

�Terrible?
The mixture of soap, coffee grounds really made my stomach work. I have not
felt that empty for months.�

&nbsp;

�That is
good. You have been complaining about stomach pains since we ordered pizza last
week. Something was wrong with it. It is nice that treatment can be a part of
the job. Would you like to be gagged before I proceed?�

&nbsp;

�Yes.
Please. My dear.�

&nbsp;

Ann gagged
him and took one of the tails. It was huge and normally it was only used on
people who had killed other people. It would certainly hurt and it was her turn
later. She lubricated it as much as she could and even put something at his
hole. Then she slowly started to press it inside Ahmed. First he clenched his
sphincter, but she told him to relax and teased him a little by using her
finger at the area just behind his scrotum. It turned some of his attention
away so he relaxed and the plug went in a little further.

&nbsp;

Eventually
she could not remove his attention from the intrusion of the plug. He began to
sweat and made repressed sounds and drool began to run down from his mouth. Ann
was really worried but suddenly it went all in and settled. Ahmed made as loud
a sigh as the gag permitted.

&nbsp;

When he was
released, she asked him about the feeling of the plug. �It is terrible. It
brought memories back from my time in the behaviour modification centre. I have
told you about Sarah and the strap-on event. However, this plug is much worse.
I don�t know how I would be able to run with it in me. But lets
try the rest of the new outfit on.�

&nbsp;

Ahmed was
hoisted by is arms. It was the old wooden bar connected to a pulley. Because he
was cuffed both by his hands and feet, he soon was stretched out. Ann produced
the leather corset, which was a part of the new outfit. �Are you comfy?�

&nbsp;

Ahmed
nodded. He knew what was next. He had been there before. Ann wrapped the cloth
around his waist and began to tug the laces. Again he felt the familiar feeling
of being cut in half. He made silent grunts as she continued to tug him.
Eventually she finished the first leg. �We have to wait for the fabric to rest
before I can continue. Would you have something to drink? I can get you a
bottle of cola with a straw.�

&nbsp;

Ahmed
nodded, as he was virtually speechless. Five minutes later he was finished and
Ann began to tug the final part. Ahmed had never felt to compressed. As he was
lowered to the ground he tried to sit, but it hurt too much in his stomach.
�This is very strict outfit. What kind of horrible crime must enable one to
wear it? I have to maintain my body entirely rigid. �

&nbsp;

�It is a
test outfit, we have to try out. The government are trying to find new groups
of people they can enrolee in the pony cart service. Prison time is waist of
time for the convicts and waste of money for the state. Let�s gets the bridle
and hook you up to the walker. I would interview you and fill out those forms
after the training.�

&nbsp;

�Tomorrow
it is your turn to try the outfit. Don�t look forward to it.�

&nbsp;

Three hours
later Ahmed walked back to the changing room supported by Ann. It had been the
most difficult training, he had done since he entered
the service. Back in the changing room Ann removed the plug with the greatest
caution. When it was gone Ahmed felt how every heartbeat made his splinter
convulse and fighting to retract. Ann had left his bridle on and his teeth
clenched around it. 

&nbsp;

Ann opened
her back and took out her strap-on dildo. Actually it had two dildos so Ann
also would get something from it. The entire behaviour modification course had
left one side effect on Ahmed. From time to another he needed to feel a woman
to take his sissy pussy. �Stand still. I would go on hard now that your sissy cunt have been prepared. If you can endure 5 minutes without
getting a release, the plug would stay out. Else I would put it right back in.
Understand!�

&nbsp;

She rammed
the dildo right in. Ahmed grunted. Ann worked with her abdomen and she soon
began to moan. �Oh. Baby. Come for mamma. Yes. Yes!� 

&nbsp;

Unfortunately,
Ahmed could not hold it back. Suddenly he came and there was still 30 seconds
left of the 5 minutes. �Oh. Baby. I am so sorry. Now
the plug must go in again.�

&nbsp;

Ahmed tried
to plead, but he knew that in this marriage she wore the trousers. She
reinserted the plug. �Out to the walker again. Move!�

&nbsp;

As he was
connected he though that there would be a day tomorrow.

&nbsp;

However,
there was a long night ahead of him. When they were finished they were in the
dresser and after the bridle had been removed, he expected to be freed, but
instead Ann changed the huge butt plug with a more endurable size. �We are
going to play tonight. I am a bit angry, because you did forget what day it is
today�

&nbsp;

�Oh.
Christ. We were married two years ago�

&nbsp;

�Exactly.
I had hoped that you had remembered it. But you did forget and now you are
going to pay the price. Tonight you are my slave.�

&nbsp;

He loved
Ann and he wanted to pay. His cuffs were connected to the side of the corset
and she got a long coat and put it over his body in order to disguise him. Then
they left for their apartment. They greeted a pair of their unsuspicious
colleagues and just looked like a normal couple on the way home.

&nbsp;

Back in the
apartment she put a posture collar on him and cuffed him on his back instead.
�Lick me!� she said as she lied down on the bed. 

&nbsp;

He climbed
into the bed slowly and began to lick. It was hard because of the rigid corset.
He could only catch small breaths. Her nibbles soon began to be erect. They
kissed and he licked her behind her ear, which made her giggle. Then he went to
work on her pussy.

&nbsp;

She moaned
and was almost on the edge of coming when she sat up and ordered him to lie on
his back. She cuffed his feet to the bed. �You are going to drink � my boy!�
She sat on the top of him and stuck her cunt in his face. He tried to lick the
best he could but the combined pressure of the corset and Ann made it difficult
for Ahmed to breathe. She pushed her cunt down over his face making him gag. He
tried to kick with his legs but he could only move the slightly. 

&nbsp;

He began to
panic when he ran out of air. Ann was in rage. �I don�t like to be forgotten.
Lick or it will be the last thing you experience!� 

&nbsp;

�Man�, he
thought - He must have pissed her off.

&nbsp;

He licked
and drank when the juices began to run out of her. But it became too much. He
went black. As Ann felt his body convulse under her, she immediately stood up.
She gave him CPR and switched to kissing when he regained consciousness. �Lets have another go!�

&nbsp;

�No.
Please.� But Ann didn�t hear. She positioned herself once more. Tears ran down
his cheek as he began to lick her once more. Ann pressed her cunt down on his
face causing him to black out almost as once. Ann came with a cry as his body
began to shiver.

&nbsp;

c) Making up

&nbsp;

When he
came to himself, she stood with a leather hood in her hands. She put in over
his head. There was� an
opening for the eyes and mouth - But not for long. She buckled a blindfold on
and a put a gag ball in his mouth. �Now I am going to return the favour!�.

&nbsp;

His member
having a hard-on, but Ann was not satisfied. It was time for some CBT. She tied
a cord around the base of this scrotum and tightened it. Ahmed was coming from
hell to heaven. 

&nbsp;

As he lied
on his back in total darkness, he felt her hands moving around his body. Oh. He
was so tense. She slowly pinched his nipple. Then she licked it, making it
standing out. It felt so nice.

&nbsp;

Suddenly he
felt the pain. She had used a nipple clamp on him. The pain was so intense. He
struggled and pulled his restraints but they were too tight. He made suppressed
screams until the pain decreased and it became bearable.

&nbsp;

Then she
started on the other nipple. He tried to enjoy it but he also began to sweat by
the pure thought of her use of a nipple clamp. He was not disappointed. And the
pain was so big. He cried inside the hood. 

&nbsp;

Now Ann
began to work with the butt plug. The old one went out and she inserted
another. Gratefully it was not bigger. But it changed when he discovered that
she could pump it and she did. Soon the pressure from the inflated plug was
extremely perceptible.

&nbsp;

She took
his penis in her mouth and began to suck it.

&nbsp;

He had
forgotten al about his nipples. This was heaven. There was only one problem.
She continued to tighten the cord around his scrotum as he came closer to
climax. The she activated the last part of her plan. The plug was a vibrator.
He was so on the edge. He wanted relief. He tried to plead, but the gag did not
let any understandable message out. 

&nbsp;

This was
too much!!

&nbsp;

Ann was
really enjoying this. She could see the pre-cum running down from his penis.
She could see his body covered from sweat. She could see the same body
shivering from arousal. But she could also see his scrotum turning almost
purple. Sadly good moments come to an end. 

&nbsp;

Quickly she
placed herself on his penis and let it all in. She began to move around and
when she herself was on the edge of a climax, she released the cord. Ahmed
came, as he never had done before. She continued to ride him until the last
drop was gone and then she did a last thing just so he would not forget their
wedding day. She removed the clamps and continued her ride dragging the last
drops of semen out of Ahmed.

&nbsp;

She left
him stay tied up in bed until the morning, although she changed the gag ball
with a bit just in case. She wouldn�t let be suffocated.

&nbsp;

When he
finally was freed and naked, he went to take a shower with pain almost every
part of his body. He knew that it was his turn to try this new corset out on
Ann and it would be fun.

&nbsp;
