Prologue

&nbsp;

She looked so beautiful, despite, or
perhaps because of the frightened look on her face. Again she struggled with
the hard restraints but could not free herself.

�I�ve given you five minutes to escape,�
the Dominant said in amusement.

�Mmmph!� her helpless captive replied,
struggling. She was bound to a pole kneeling down, her long golden hair limp.

�Well, you know what happens to bad
slaves?� the Dom demanded gleefully. She held up a long metal rod.

The blonde head shook desperately. She
clicked her fingers; some sort of sign.

�No! You are mine for now!� the Dom
replied. She touched the end of the rod to the captive�s left
breast.

The result was somewhat more than she
expected. The prisoner jerked and fought for a moment, then made an odd
clicking sound, and slumped.

�Slave?� the Dom asked, alarmed. She
moved forward and knelt, checking the pulse, but there was none. She
frantically slapped the blonde girl, as if that might bring her back. Her hands
strayed to her communicator.

&nbsp;

A half hour later, a detail of Trons
came and removed the body secretly. It would be dumped or disposed of, and no
one would now. That is, no one but an unknown woman who had seen the whole
thing through a crack in the door. So while the Dominant went and got dressed
to erase the memory of the accidental death, the mysterious watcher slipped
away.

&nbsp;

Deception and Truth

&nbsp;

Vassha, a very pretty Aquaris; a type of
sea adapted humanoid, was very unhappy at the moment. She was crying, and being
comforted by both Mr Tavenar and Angerau, his second in command.

�It�s alright, dear,� Angerau whispered to
her. Her own hard face was a rictus of controlled anger. �It�s not your
fault�shh�� she soothed.

�I will make sure that the person who did
this knows how much they have hurt you,� Jules promised, patting the girl on
the arm, comfortingly.

�Boss, do you want me to stay with Vassha?�
Angerau hinted, suggesting Tavenar should leave the room.

�Yes, please do, my dear. I will talk with
this�Countess,� he said and stood.

�But she said I�d be in trouble if I told
you,� Vassha said unhappily.

�You are not going to get in trouble, she
is, I promise you. Our job is bad enough without women
like her treating you like a slave.�

Vassha cuddled up to her comforter, feeling
safe at last.

&nbsp;

Jules Tavenar walked into the meeting room
where one of his guards had made sure their guest had stayed put.

�I warn you, if you do not get on your
knees and beg forgiveness now, I�ll have you arrested for wrongful
imprisonment,� the haughty human Countess declared.

�Countess Dumare, you are here because I
have just been comforting a young girl who is distraught at your treatment of
her.�

�Oh, so the whores are getting picky, are
they?� Dumare sneered. �I paid for the slut, so she�s mine for the night.�

�You pay for companionship, not for a
slave. If you want that, I am sure that in the lower city, you can find an
illegal slaver. My girls, and boys, are not slaves, they have rights, and the
rules that you violated, and her trust, will not be tolerated.�

�What are you going to do? Ban me from
coming back? I�m leaving this wretched planet tomorrow, so good luck. But I
have a few friends in government who would be eager to shut you down. So don�t
think you can scare me, you pimp.�

Tavenar showed no reaction to the insults,
but inside, he was fuming, angry and wanting revenge. �I want you to apologise
to the girl you abused,� he replied calmly.

Dumare dropped her cheroot on the floor and
crushed the ash into the carpet. �No. It is my choice. I paid money for the
bitch, and she gave up. Typical aliens, they all want rights but no work.� She
stood. �I am leaving now, and if you stand in my way, you will be arrested.�

Tavenar stood aside unhappily as she
swooped past.

�Good boy,� Dumare said and walked down the
stairs and out.

&nbsp;

Angerau looked up hopefully when Tavenar
entered, but he shook his head. His assistant sighed and kissed Vassha on the
cheek. �I�ll be back, darling.�

Outside the door, Angerau glared at
Tavenar. �You just let her go? How could you?�

�And what was I supposed to do?� he replied
stiffly. �Lock her up? I want to make her apologise, but it cannot be done. She
is a noble with influence and power. Any attempt by me to make her accountable
will either end up in court, or with me getting involved in a smear campaign.
And I don�t want that, our people don�t deserve that.�

�There is an alternative�� Angerau said
with a smirk.

�What?�

The tall human whispered something in his
ear. �How�s that for affirmative action?�

Jules Tavenar�s eyes were wide, but he
couldn�t help smiling. �Can it be done? I don�t want any harm on this place.�

�I know just the people�.�

&nbsp;

Adril Tythorin was bored. She missed her
wife, and it wasn�t just for the sex, it was for everything. She�d been married
for three and a half years, and she�d grown to love it, to rely on it in a way
that would have made her laugh just ten years ago. Regardless, it allowed her
to catch up with work, which was hard to concentrate on when she could be
making love to her wife instead!

It was while she was typing away at her
computer, that she heard a buzz on her communicator. She opened it to see it
was Angerau, and she was waiting outside the security shield with a very nice
looking, but unknown girl.

�Adril, dear, mind if I come into the
fortress? I�ve got someone for you to meet.�

�Sure, come right in,� Adril said, lowering
the power field, and then heading down to the door. She opened it, and then
hugged her friend. �How are you, Ang?� she asked happily.

�I�m doing good, pet,� Angerau replied jokingly,
letting her hands roam down Adril�s ass.

�None of that yet!� Adril said with pretended sternness. She bowed to the newcomer. �Hi
there, I�m Adril Tythorin. You work for Mr Tavenar, I guess?�

�I do�I joined a few months ago. I�m Vassha
Vailea. I�m very pleased to meet you,� she added. Vassha was of average human
height with greenish tinted skin which offered cover in the water, gills behind
her pointed ears to help breath in water, and eyes which were covered by a
special membrane to stop seawater irritating them.

�You�re a new girl, is that right? Err�are
you here to let me�� Adril said, then blushed.

�Maybe later,� Angerau said firmly, leading
Adril into her lounge. �But first of all, I want your advice on something. Something that is not legal, but I think is morally right.�

Adril nodded seriously, though didn�t know
what she was talking about. �Go on, but be aware, I will not do anything
illegal without good reason.�

�Vassha here is only new to the scene.
She�d performed well, and had nothing but praise from all her clients. Then,
two days ago, a visiting Countess from the Empire came to us. She was a
demanding, arrogant little bitch, and I, perhaps against my judgement, gave her
the benefit of the doubt.� Angerau paused and cuddled the sexy Aquaris girl
reassuringly. �She took Vassha away to her hotel room and there�well�I�m not
sure I should-�

�She tortured me,� Vassha cut in angrily.

Adril�s jaw tightened visibly. �What did
she do to you?�

�She tied me up, and wouldn�t let me go
when it hurt. I tried to safeword her, but she just laughed at me and hit me
again.� She turned and pulled down her pants, showing harsh red lines over her
ass. �I didn�t like it, so she gagged me.�

�Where is she?� Adril asked coldly. �I�m
going to-�

�No!� Angerau said with such power that
both women stopped. �That will only make things worse. Thankfully, Vassha was
able to activate her bleeper. We came and released her. Her client was an
arrogant bitch, and she thought it was her right to treat Vassha like a slave
because, you guessed it, she was an alien.�

Adril took a long, deep breath. �Vassha, I
am so sorry. You can be assured that I, or any of
those in this house would dare violate you so. But what can we do?�

�That�s where I come to you. I think that
this woman needs to be taught a lesson. Experience what it is like to be on the
receiving end�.�

Adril shook her head. �Kidnap is a serious,
dangerous crime. I want to help you, but that sort of thing will get your house
closed down, and if I�m involved, a lot of trouble.�

Angerau looked crestfallen for a moment.
Then she looked up. �I�m right, am I not in saying that you were a slave once?�

Her friend nodded. �I was, an unpleasant
experience, let me tell you.�

�You don�t have to, I was one too. That is,
until the Akarian Guard smashed the cartel I was enslaved by.�

�Oh�� Adril said uncertainly.

�These nobles, they live in their fine
houses and towers and look down on people like me, and even you, because we
weren�t born to some snob of a parent. What she did is hurt Vassha more with
her attitude than any whip could. She thought it was her right to hurt and
punish her because she thought she was better.�

�Yeah, I know. But what will it achieve?
You can hardly mention it even if you do succeed, and she will hardly be
thankful for it.�

Angerau sighed. �I thought you might have
understood. Didn�t you ever think that when you were a slave? Despise your
owner�s superior attitude?�

�Of course I did, how could I not?� Adril
snapped back. �That is not the point though. The point is that revenge will
solve nothing.�

Vassha said nothing, just stared at her
feet mutely.

�If it was one of your friends wouldn�t you
do it? If you were married to Vassha, would you do it then?�

�I would, but�� Adril began.

She sighed. �Alright, I�ll do it. But we�ll
need help, and somewhere to go. Meet me here at thirteen tonight,� Adril said
and stood. �Pleased to meet you, Vassha.�

�Just so you know,
this is not the first time. You know Isari? Well�she has some information you
might find very interesting�.� 

&nbsp;

xxx

&nbsp;

Countess Allie Dumare laid out her clothes
on the bed. Normally, she�d not do something so servant-like, but these were
garments that were too important to be ruined by grubby peasants. Despite being
twenty nine, she was firmly convinced still that it was her right and privilege
to be a noblewoman. To those of her station in life, she was respectful and
courteous, but to anyone else, she was withering in her condescension. She did
not consider herself wrong, or even particularly arrogant, Dumare just believed
that people should stay where they were born. It was a notion that she liked a
lot, because she was well-born, and didn�t care much about other people.

She had been angered, therefore, when her
toy had been taken off her. It was a mistake, she knew, to have gone to that
place, with its ridiculous rules and pretensions. Normally those she hired
could not complain even if they wanted to. It was the problem with Verusia, she
had told her bodyguard leader; give a peasant a vote, and they thought they had
rights.

There was a knock on the door. Dumare
looked up irritably.

�Well?� she snapped petulantly.

A hotel porter, a Verusian, entered.
�Countess, there is a message for you to be delivered in person.�

�Go on,� she said icily. She pushed her
black hair back.

�A message from Jules
Tavenar. He apologises for his conduct, and will
refund your money should you wish it.�

�Granted. My assistant will give my details. Reply saying that our enmity is
over,� she added sweetly. She turned away as the porter left. Light she�d be
happy to get back to the Empire where people acted with respect.

�Guard!� she called out. There was heavy footsteps, and a middle aged veteran of a man
walked in.

�My lady?�

�You may stand down. I do not know what
insults me more; that Tavenar is a peasant, or he is a coward. I will sleep
now, we will leave tomorrow morning.�

�Shall I have a guard outside, my lady?�

�Hmm, yes. See to it. You can never tell with aliens.�

The guard saluted and left.

The Countess settled in her bed and was
soon asleep.

&nbsp;

Allie Dumare was not awoken by the sun�s
shining in her window, but rather by an instinct. She opened her eyes and
looked up, seeing a dark shadow silhouetted against the window.

�Who are you? Guard!� she called, sitting
up.

�He�s having a nap,� the figure said
softly.

�What do you want?� Dumare demanded. She
reached surreptitiously under her pillow for her hold-out las-pistol. It wasn�t
there.

�Looking for this?� the figure asked,
aiming a weapon at Dumare.

�What do you want; money?� Dumare asked. She
was frightened, but would not show it.

�Tell me�where did you go to school?�

�I don�t have to-� she
began, but there was an ominous click and the small whine of the powercell
charging. �Castle-Guard Grammar. It�s on-�

�I know where it is. It�s ironic, they
teach three hundred courses, but not one of them is common courtesy.�

�That-� Dumare
began, but then something sharp like a dart hit her, and she slumped back. The
world spun, and her eyes closed, and she knew no more.

&nbsp;

Allie Dumare was jolted awake. She opened
her eyes, but it was just as dark as with them closed. She was lying on a
blanket on something hard, but there was hard metal to either side, like she
was in a box. Next she felt the tape over her mouth and the cloth over her
eyes. As she tried to move her hands up to remove the offending material, she
found then trapped. Her mind raced and she realised she was in a metal box,
tied up�kidnapped!

�Mmmph!� she tried vainly, struggling
against the tight bonds on her legs and arms. Her struggles rattled the chains
binding her, making them clank loudly. Taking heart, she rattled them some more
to try and attract attention.

Her struggles ceased when the sound of
footsteps appeared outside her box. The light flooded in as the lid was opened,
but the blindfold still kept her from seeing her captors. Her hopes that she
might be rescued plummeted when a hand touched her bare breasts. Dumare shied
away, but to no avail.

�What a nice one you�ve got me,� a voice
hissed. When the Countess tried to speak through her gag, this mysterious woman
slapped her face hard. �You will speak when spoken to, slut. You�re mine now, and if I want to burn my name into your skin with
heated knives, I can, and you can�t stop me!�

Dumare cowered, and stopped speaking
quickly. It was warm, so warm that she felt the sweat prickle over her body.

�Now�slut, the
formalities. You are now owned by me, by right
of conquest and capture. That means you will obey my commands without question,
you have no rights except what I give you and if you wish to speak, you will
ask my permission. Am I understood?� the domineering woman asked. Dumare stayed
silent, and there was sudden, terrible pain on her left breast as if it had
been canned or hit. �Am I understood?� her captor roared.

Dumare nodded desperately, struggling frantically
with her bonds.

�Good. You chose a good prize,� the woman
which Dumare though of as the Mistress said.

�Thank you. I hope you don�t mind if I
stick around? This bitch is one tight little cunt,� the woman who had captured
Dumare said. She began to think of her as Slaver.

�Not at all, she must be trained�and
broken,� Mistress said. �But first�so she knows that there is no help�make her
stand up.�

A hand undid the shackle on Dumare�s right
wrist. Instantly, she reached for her gag, but her arm was held with such
strength that the Countess, fit though she was, was trapped. Despite her
struggles, her left hand was untied, and then handcuffed tight behind her back.
Dumare was dragged to her feet, her bound knees and ankles helpless for
escaping. The Countess noticed, irrelevantly, that the ground was not cement at
all, but dirt.

&nbsp;

She soon found out why. Holding her naked
body still, the blindfold and gag were pulled off, and Dumare stood, amazed.
She was standing on a wide grassed view overlooking a steeply sloped area
broken by grass and small pools. To either side and behind was jungle echoing
with the calls of birds. Before Dumare was the sea, a magnificent beach led
down to the water�s edge. Then, her gaze turned to the great, multileveled
building before her, almost like a fortress.

�Where am I?� she demanded, awkwardly
turning on her captors.

A hand shoved her from behind, and she
sprawled painfully on the dirt. �You will speak only when you are spoken to,
slave,� Mistress said. A hard boot rested on her neck, pushing and hurting.

�But since it helps our purpose, we will
tell you,� Slaver added gleefully. �You are not on Raetia�you are about a quadrillion
miles away.�

The boot moved off her back and Dumare
rolled over to look at her tormentors. They were dressed from head to toe in
black like wraiths. Over their faces were blank iron masks.

�What do you want?� she asked stubbornly.

�Oh, your body, life and soul will do
fine,� Mistress said in amusement. When her slave tried to wriggle backwards,
Mistress caught her and hauled her upright. �Cuff her legs, and get the leash.�

Dumare was powerless to stop Slaver cuffing
her legs so she could walk with small steps, and then fixing a collar around
her neck like that put on animals. Even though she was wrapped up in fear and
rage, Dumare had to admit these people were thorough.

&nbsp;

�Walk down the
hill,� Mistress ordered, producing a heavy whip from a pocket.

Dumare began her walk of shame down the
hill, and was very thankful that there was no one to watch this procession but
her captors.

�While we walk, slave, I will explain what
will happen. You were taken because of your looks, and because an aristocrat
fetches a high price. Indeed�we�ve already got a buyer for you!�

�Slavery is illegal, and-�
Dumare began, but a whip cracked the air and silenced her.

�Of course it is, but not much help to you,
is it? In fact�it is the absence of rules and laws that help us train little
bitches like you.�

Dumare wriggled her hands, but there was no
chance of escape. The handcuffs were special metal and leather instruments that
gave her no leeway to get out, and stopped her hurting herself too. The
Countess evaluated her chances of running, but knew even if she got more than
five steps, she�d never get the chains off.

�Stop!� Mistress said. They were by a pool of water like a little oasis in
the shade. �Get in, wash yourself,� she ordered.

�How? I can�t-� Dumare began but then was pushed
fully into the water. Bound like she was, it took her a few heart stopping
moments before she could touch the bottom and be safe. Instantly though, there
was a splash as Slaver waded in and grabbed her. Bound and naked, Dumare could
not struggle against this strong opponent who dunked her head into the water.
She splashed and struggled, but Slaver�s grip was remorseless. Just as her
lungs started to burn, she was pulled up harshly.

�This is just a warning, slut,� Mistress
called from the grass. �We don�t need you, and though your sale would be nice,
it is hardly necessary. Remember that only by being a good girl can you make it
through. You do what we say when we say it�and we will spare you the need for
pain. Got it?�

Dumare was terrified. Not just by their
words and actions, but because she had actually, on a sick level, enjoyed the
feeling she had just had! It was wrong and she resolved to pretend to be good,
and wait for a chance to escape. �Yes,� she said.

�And what do you call me? Yes, who?� There was silence. �Mistress!� her captor
shouted. �Dunk her,� she ordered slaver.

�Wait!� Dumare said desperately as Slaver
grabbed her arms.

�Hold!� Mistress ordered. �What do you call
me?�

�Mistress!� Dumare wailed, her face an inch from the
water.

�You are learning. Let�s take her to her
accommodation.�

&nbsp;

Dumare was pulled out of the pool by the
leash and blindfolded again. Then, she walked over grass and dirt until she
came to hard concrete. A door opened and she was pushed into wonderful cool
air. It was unfortunately not to last, as a second door was opened, and she was
forced down stairs into humid air. Her blindfold was removed, and Dumare stared
at her cell. 

�Welcome to your palace,� Slaver said
happily, dragging her in. There was a toilet and wash basin, a mattress on the
floor and a pile of books, presumably to read. The one small window was too
high to reach, even by standing on the mattress, and was sealed with a metal
mesh. It was, however, clean. The three walls of the cell not containing the
window were barred, but also had energy projectors to instantly create an
unbreakable barrier.

In the centre of the floor was a riveted
metal ring, to which Dumare was dragged. She struggled, but even without her
bonds, she would be no match for Mistress and Slaver. They padlocked the long
chain to the ring on her collar, untied her wrists and arms, then
locked the cell door.

�We will be back�soon,� Mistress said
ominously.

As soon as they were gone, Dumare tried to
free herself, both at the ring and her collar, but she was trapped. Countess
Allie Dumare was naked, chained, trapped and helpless. Despite that though, she
was not without hope. The chain was long, allowing her to go anywhere in the
cell. Once again she admired and was disheartened by the levels of preparation
her captors had done to keep her in. Her chain, the bars and the energy field
all kept her in, and only if all three were compromised could she escape from
just this cell.

Around an hour later, Slaver came in and
gave her food. No cutlery and only paper plates, but the food was tasty, not
what Dumare thought of as prison food at all. When she was done, she laid down and slept.

&nbsp;

She woke at the sound of footsteps. It was
dark outside, but the room was lit by ceiling light globes. Dumare lay utterly still, tensing as the cell door opened and closed and the
footsteps came closer. A hand touched her shoulder, and Dumare reacted. She
rolled from her side onto her back and swung her left fist up into her captor�s
face. Instead of hurting her opponent, Dumare�s fist felt like it struck a
wall. She followed up with a blow to the opponent�s stomach, but that was
covered with what felt like iron too!

Her next swing was caught, and she was
unceremoniously rolled on her back and held down on the mattress.

�Try that again, slut,� Slaver hissed, �and
I�ll break one of your fingers.� To reinforce her threat, she uncurled Dumare�s
left hand and tightened her grip on her middle finger. �Got it?�

�Yes,� the Countess said, trying to stop herself crying out as her finger was wrenched painfully.

�Good,� Slaver said and hauled her up.
Dumare was pushed against the cell bars and held there while her handcuffs were
locked on and her chain replaced with a leash. �Now, come on,� Slaver ordered
and pulled Dumare along. The Countess� futile struggling was useless as she was
dragged to a set of stairs going even further down, and forced to follow her
captor.

&nbsp;

The first thing Dumare noticed was the
sound of another captive being punished. There was a whimper and a harsh sound,
a snapping crack. The Countess shied away from the sound, but was pulled hard.
She considered lashing out with her foot, but decided against it.

Instead, she let herself be dragged down to
see the dungeon that had been built on this second ground floor. It was, at
least in design, a wide cellar in the cool depths with plenty of space for
storage. Now, however, a variety of�devices were in the room. To Dumare they
were ominous, as if ancient terrors of torture had come to this modern era of
space travel.

She saw that there was indeed another
prisoner, a tall, slender woman, shiny with sweat, and it was easy to see why.
Suspended from the ceiling by her wrists, her feet rested on a single block of
wood that could be easily knocked aside, and leave her hanging painfully in air.

What was worse for the captive, as well as
the blindfold and gag, was that electrodes were stuck over her body, so when
Mistress played with a remote in hand, her helpless captive moaned and
struggled fitfully.

�This slave refused to do as she was told,�
Slaver commented.

Dumare tried to stop herself
being dragged forward, but it was no use.

Mistress turned and nodded. �Ah, the fresh meat. Look up, slut, you have a friend!� she
ordered her hanging captive. Obediently, she raised her blindfolded head a few
inches and slumped down again.

�This poor girl is very sorry, aren�t you?�
Mistress said, stroking her body. When the only response she got was a moan,
she zapped the suspended captive. �Isn�t that right?!� she hissed angrily. This
time, she got an emphatic, but gagged answer. �Good. Now, shackle this one to
the bench and let�s examine her.�

&nbsp;

The Countess was dragged to a steel table
complete with manacles. She fought with all her might, kicking out, but
Mistress joined in, and while she was held still, her legs were manacled in
place. Despite all her fighting, her hands were forced into the metal clamps,
and she was left trapped. 

Mistress reached out with a gloved hand,
tracing it up Dumare�s body, starting between her legs, and continuing up
between her breasts, and then lingering over the nipples. Caressing each in turn,
Mistress suddenly moved and slapped Dumare hard across the face.

�You are not here to enjoy yourself!� she
snapped angrily.

Slaver walked to the far end of the table,
and there used her fingers to examine Dumare�s vagina like it was some
interesting specimen.

�No! Stop that-!� Dumare called out, trying
vainly to jerk away.

Mistress slapped her three times hard on
the cheek. �Shut up, slut! What are you going to do?�

Dumare struggled, then
looked up defiantly. �Go to hell.�

Mistress seized the Countess� head and
slammed it back on the steel table, making Dumare�s head ring. �You are very,
very fortunate that I want you alive to be sold or else I�d rip out your
useless tongue right now!�

�Do whatever you want, I am not afraid,�
Dumare countered boldly.

�You will be,� Mistress said icily and
turned to Slaver. �Get the devices.�

Dumare knew she was pushing her luck, but
she refused to give in without a fight. �I�m scared now,� she mocked.

Mistress ignored her and set some
instruments out on a bench before Dumare. She did not mock or threaten, it
seemed she was over that. She simply produced a pair of sharp clamps connected
by a chain.

Dumare struggled to get away as the steel
teeth closed over her nipples. She cried aloud in pain and struggled, but was
helpless as the second clamp bit into her other nipple.

Slaver was using this opportunity of
torture, to light a candle and run it over the soles of Dumare�s feet, making
her struggle desperately. She refused to beg them to stop, so soon her feet
were a mass of pain, burned so she would have trouble walking.

�It can all stop,� Mistress said,
tightening the clamp�s bite.

�No! I won�t!� Dumare said, gathering her
courage.

Mistress stared down at her, then tied a rope to the middle of the chain between Dumare�s
clamped breasts. Then, with a brutal motion, she yanked it up and tied it off
to a wire overhead. To Dumare it felt like her nipples were about to be torn
from her body, but she managed to grit her teeth and bear the pain. Her
tormentors were not perturbed, and produced needles which they inserted into
her breasts.

The pain was terrible, but Dumare, if she
had been rational, would have noticed that they were not trying to maim her.
What use was a slave who was permanently damaged?

�Now, let us see if she likes some
pleasure,� Slaver said and produced a small egg like device. Dumare watched
warily as Slaver advanced, and then inserted it into her vagina, using padded clamps
to close her labia so it could not fall out. Dumare struggled, expecting
terrible pain, but was pleasantly surprised when it started to vibrate very
nicely.

�Let�s take this other slut to her cell,�
Mistress said.

�Don�t go away,� Slaver said snidely to
Dumare and pressed a controller which was taped to the table. She came over and
gagged the Countess with a large red ball, strapping it tight so it could not
come loose.

&nbsp;

As the other prisoner was hauled bodily
away, Dumare was left in a mix of pain and pleasure. The pleasure was very nice
indeed, and because there was nothing she could do to stop it, she lay back and
let it take her mind off the clamps. It soon became clear that Dumare had no
choice but to be aroused, she attempted to hold her arousal in, but it was no
use, it bypassed her brain and went straight to her instincts. And after a few minutes,
her arousal was about to reach its peak, and she could feel an unwilling, yet
still promising orgasm rising. Just as she was about to crest the wave and
descend into relief, the machine stopped its buzzing!

Dumare moaned into the gag and struggled
desperately. She wanted release, but none would come! Her clit throbbed and her
heart raced, but the pain was back from her breasts, and she moaned unhappily.

&nbsp;

As Dumare�s pulse was getting back into its
normal rhythm, the machine started up once again. Suddenly, Dumare at last
realised the trap. The vibrator was somehow linked to her heart rate, so when
it reached the point of orgasm, it would stop, and there was nothing Allie
Dumare could do in the world to stop it! She remembered once when a pet had stopped
giving her pleasure, and she had felt so frustrated she had ordered the girl
beaten. Now, that need was many, many times worse, and she could not sate it at
all.

As her arousal and lust reached a second
peak, the vibrator stopped, and she struggled, cursing and yelling incoherently
into the gag.

The third time she tried to trick it,
desperate for release, but somehow the machine�s
programming, and her treacherous body thwarted the attempt, and she was left
frustrated again. The fourth time, Dumare tried to orgasm quickly, before it
could be denied to her, but it was useless again. Screaming
in impotent rage, laid her head back in despair.

&nbsp;

�Aww�poor little slut,� Slaver said,
appearing as if from nowhere. She ran her hands over her captive�s wet folds, and
up to her sweat streaked stomach. �Do you want release?� she asked sweetly.

�Mmmph!� Dumare called, nodding.

�Be careful what you wish for, slave, you
might get it. Have fun!� she said, playing with the controls.

The vibrator continued to buzz, but to Dumare�s
relief, it did not cut off. This time, just a few second was all it took for
her to finally crest the tide of passion. So much arousal and passion was built
up, that as she came, a thin white liquid dripped out from her vagina as she
let out a contented sigh.

However, it was then that she noticed what
was wrong. The vibrator was still buzzing its song in her! Now, instead of
being unable to orgasm as before, she could not stop herself doing it now.

Orgasm after orgasm was ripped from her,
and with each one, her heart beat raced faster, and her clit throbbed. It was pleasurable,
at first at least, but then it became more and more painful, and her nether
regions were so sensitive that even the slightest movement of air made her feel
waves of ecstatic pain.

It was just as she was about to pass out,
that the buzzing stopped. The sopping vibrator was removed, and she was
unchained from the table. The torture implements were removed, but Dumare did
not really notice. She was too zoned out to struggle, but they chained her as
usual and dragged her off up to her cell. They untied her, fastened her collar
chain, then locked the door. Dumare staggered to the
bed and collapsed into a deep, exhausted sleep.

&nbsp;

Dumare woke as the light streamed in. With
horror she remembered the last night, and knew that they had won that round,
not through torture, but through her own treacherous body. She slowly got to
her feet, then saw to her amazement, that there was a
second prisoner, the one she had seen from the dungeon.

�Hi,� her fellow captive said warily. She�d
been looking around to make sure no one was watching them.

Dumare was tempted to ignore the other
slave, but had nothing more productive to do. �Hello.�

�I�guess you saw me down in their dungeon?�
the girl muttered. She was blonde haired and looked very sweet in a young way.

�Yes�what happened?� Dumare asked.

�If you disobey them�you get punished.
Zapped and worked and hurt until you do what they say. They�re real good at
making sure you don�t get marked. That cell used to have an Eldorai in it. She
was defiant�until they made her do something, then she was quiet as a mouse.
I�m Kalinai by the way.�

�Where are we?� Dumare demanded. She was
not happy talking to someone like this, but she had
little choice. She would not give out her name to this girl though.

�Don�t know. I was taken on Raetia. I was
trying to get a job in a bar.�

�As a stripper?� Dumare asked acidly. Her attitude indicated that the other girl had
got what she deserved.

Kalinai glared at her in a hurt way. �As a waitress. We�re not all gifted with millions like
you,� she snapped.

�And how would you know anything about me?�

�They told me of course. Said they were
equal opportunity slavers or something. Heh, you�re not so strong now, are
you?� Kalinai sneered. Her mood had turned from friendly to resentful quickly.

Dumare stared at her and sniffed. �Well,
you�re probably enjoying it,� she said scornfully.

&nbsp;

Any retort Kalinai might have given was cut
short by the door to the upper levels opening and the sound of voices. Dumare
sat cross-legged, hoping they were not there for her, and was relieved that
they had come for Kalinai.

Slaver and Mistress were in the company of
a tall, well dressed woman, making Dumare wonder why everyone she had met had
been women. It was a question she couldn�t answer.

�And you see, Lady, this is our newest
acquisition,� Mistress said, pointing to Dumare. �She�s an arrogant little
bitch, but she is being broken in.�

�Is she already sold?� the visitor asked
eagerly.

�Regrettably,� Slaver replied. �She is not
yet housebroken, but she will be.�

The visitor, Dumare was thinking of her as
Buyer, came to the cell where Kalinai was. The blonde girl was clearly anxious,
as she was wringing her hands together nervously. �This is her?� she asked.
Buyer was an Eldorai with pale skin, which seemed to almost glow in the light.

�Yes. Wait here, my Lady,� Mistress said.
She opened the cell, and she and Slaver moved in and shackled Kalinai�s hands
behind her back, then cuffed her legs. This all seemed part of their meticulous
care in never giving the prisoner a chance to escape.

Slaver bowed and admitted entry for Buyer. 

Buyer looked down on Kalinai, who was
kneeling naked and looking at the ground. She was shivering slightly as she
waited.

�Are you frightened?� the Eldorai asked
softly.

�Y-Yes, Lady,� Kalinai admitted. She
clearly expected to be punished for the admission, and indeed, Mistress� fists
were balled like her slave had done something very bad.

Instead, Buyer caressed Kalinai�s face.
�Don�t be. I treat my pets well. If you are good and obey me, you will be given
a better life than most at freedom, but cross me�� she left the threat hanging.

�Shall we have her sign?� Mistress asked a
shade impatiently.

�Yes, do so.�

Slaver unlocked one wrist and dragged Kalinai
over to the bed where she lay a book down and produced an electric screen.
�Sign,� she ordered, giving a stylus to Kalinai.

Kalinai hesitated to read the contract of
debt bondage that was legal in the Empire, and received a slap for the delay. 

�Sign!� Mistress ordered.

With shaking hands, Kalinai signed. There
was a beep to show it was accepted. �It matches with her passport signature, my
Lady,� Slaver assured.

�Good. Help me take her to my ship.�

&nbsp;

Dumare watched the whole process with worry.
Kalinai was gone, her last look as she was hauled
away, was one of sadness and worry.

The Countess frantically yanked at the
chain that connected her to the floor, crying as she did.

When that proved as futile as ever, she
picked up a book to read. It was a cheap romance novel called �Captive of the
Shadows�. Dumare threw it against the bars and went to sleep.

&nbsp;

The first she knew of Mistress and Slaver�s
approach was when the cell door opened and she was hauled upright. She
struggled and managed to kick Mistress in the shin, though it hurt like crazy.
It earned her three jaw grating slaps across the face while Slaver held her
still.

�You listen to me, slut bitch, no one knows
you are here, and it could be very easy to just�forget about you. Are we on the
same wavelength here?� Mistress snarled.

�Y-yes�Mistress!� Dumare said. She was
frightened by the hatred in the voice.

�Take her out of my sight and make her
sweat!� Mistress growled.

Slaver attached a leash and dragged Dumare
to the cell door. There, she affixed a gag and blindfold, then dragged her
upstairs, through the house, and out into the humid heat of a jungle morning. 

The door slammed shut behind her and the
blindfold came off. �You�re going to work, slut,� Slaver said, pulling her on
by the leash.

The two came to a wide flat area overlooked
by the house. Since the house was built on a slope, only the top level was
visible at the upper slope, but two levels and the upper cellar could be seen
at the hill�s foot, including the cell windows.

Waiting there was a wide winch, like an
ancient wheat grinder with four horizontal spokes. By pushing a spoke in an
anti-clockwise direction, the winch would turn. Each spoke, or arm, was made of
wood with heavy chains hanging from it.

Dumare saw a chance to escape, but that was
nullified when her leash was locked to the� spoke. Slaver undid her handcuffs and manacled
them to the bar in front so she could not get away. Dumare struggled for a
moment against the grip of the chains, but it was no use.

�Push,� Slaver ordered, settling in the
shade of a tree. When her slave did not obey, Slaver produced a thin telescopic
rod from her robe and advanced. 

�Mmmph!!� Dumare said, trying to do as she was asked. Slaver easily stopped
her and touched the touched the electro prod onto Dumare�s ass. There was an
electric snap and the slave struggled and pulled at her bonds desperately. She
remembered a rod like that�with bad memories!

�That is so you don�t forget who is in
charge,� Slaver said indifferently, leaving her gagged. �Now, work!�

&nbsp;

For hours on end, interrupted with brief
removals of the gag for water to be forced into her, the work continued. Dumare
was covered in sweat and was exhausted. Her body was red with sun exposure, and
her feet especially hurt. She could not do anything to stop the torment.
Chained as she was there was no escape, and the terrible pain of the shock-rod
made it impossible to resist.

After what seemed an eternity, Dumare was
stopped, her hands re-chained behind her back, and she was dragged back to her
cell. As always, she was blindfolded until she reached her cell. After washing
herself as much as she could, she fell to the mattress in despair. Thoughts of
suicide entered her mind, but despite the impracticality of trying it in this
cell, she came to realise that she had not been treated too badly. Maybe if she
waited another day, things might ease.

&nbsp;

She was awoken by Slaver the next morning
and bound once more with her hands behind her back. She was dragged downstairs
to the dungeon level, but instead of being tortured again she was forced into a
converted gymnasium. Dumare dug her heels in and struggled desperately to avoid
being forced onto one of the machines. Slaver tired of the opposition and drew
her shock-rod.

�Do as you are told, slut!� she ordered and
smacked it into Dumare�s legs.

�Ow! Bitch!� the Countess said, yanking
herself free and running, still cuffed, for the door. However, she found it was
locked, and she was soon caught by Slaver who looked angry.

Slaver pushed her hard into the wall twice
then dragged her down to the dungeon.

�I was going to go easy on you, slut, but
now you will suffer!� she said. She activated a commlink on her wrist, and it
was not long before Mistress arrived.

�So, you threw it back in our face, have
you? Well, now you will pay for that attempt. No pleasure, no going easy,
unless you beg to be a good girl.�

Though Dumare was dreadfully afraid, she
said nothing.

�So be it,� Mistress said. She pushed her
to a large X frame near the wall and helped Slaver chain her to it face first.

She fought with her legs, but they too were
soon locked tight. Just as she was wondering what was going to happen, there
was a crack like thunder behind her.

She turned as much as she could, to see
that Mistress was holding a long whip which crackled with electrical power. 

�No�please don�t!� Dumare said. She�d never
had something frighten her so much.

Mistress cracked it in the air again, the
tip just whistling past her arm and smacking the stone wall.

�Mistress�please!�
she begged. Dumare was so worried that a single blow from the whip would cut
her back to the bone.

�Please what?� Mistress asked
remorselessly.

�Please don�t whip me!� she pleaded
desperately.

�Or what? You�ll stop me?� her captor sneered.

�No�I�ll be a good girl! Please don�t do
it! Please!� Dumare begged, struggling uselessly.

�Swear on that, if you mean it.�

�I promise�I swear I�ll be a good girl! A
good pet!� she found herself saying. Something about the whip made her feel
terrified.

�I will hold you to this, slut,� Mistress
said. �For each infraction, one lash, got it?�

�Yes, Mistress.�

&nbsp;

�Take her to her cell, I will be up soon to
test her resolve,� Mistress ordered and stalked out.

Dumare felt broken, and did not resist. She
knew if she struggled, they would not hesitate to whip her bloody�then probably
kill her. Slaver was not any less cautious, despite her seeming collapse of
willpower, and made sure she was securely chained before she was dragged upstairs.
Once inside the cell, the leash was replaced with the floor chain, but her
other bonds were not removed, and Slaver stayed in the cell watching her.

�Shall I give you advice, slave?�

�Y-yes, Mistress�.�

�Be a good girl. I do not delight in
whipping a pretty girl to the bone, but I will if you resist. You are going to
be a slave regardless of what you do, so you might as well do it without
pain�and maybe earn something nice from it.�

�But�but,� Dumare said, cowering.

�Go on, speak,� Slaver said with stern
patience.

�How could I live with myself if I just
submitted blindly?�

�How could you live with yourself if I whipped
your back to rags, then sold you on? Would it make any difference? Live with
it, you�re a slave, you didn�t choose it, so make the best of it.�

Dumare nodded. It made sense to her, in fact, it made a lot of sense to her. She had learned
in the few days she had been here that these slavers were not the normal ones
she heard about. If she was good they treated her well, so perhaps it was time
to obey? The realities of being a slave, even to a noble like she had been had
once been abhorrent. And indeed, it still was, but now it was tempered by an
understanding that she had little choice. If she resisted, she would be no use
to these people�and they would not look kindly on her.

&nbsp;

Her musings were interrupted as Mistress
entered wearing essentially the same clothes, but without metal plates below
the waist and with lighter material. She still wore her face concealing mask
though, so her expression, like Slaver�s, was invisible.

�You said you would be a good girl. Do you
still hold to this?�

�Yes, Mistress,� Dumare answered quickly.
She figured that being helpful and quick would help her cause far more than
being obstructive.

�Good. Gag her, mouth open,� she ordered.

Slaver moved forward and slipped a dental gag
into Dumare�s mouth so that she could still use her tongue, but could not bite
down. It was clear what would happen next.

Mistress slowly removed her trousers. Under
it, she was naked. �Now�slave, your duties with your new Mistress will not be
simply work related. Some, probably most, will be in the bedroom with her. Make
me orgasm�now.�

Dumare hesitated, then edged forward and
moved her head forward to touch her tongue against her Mistress� pussy.

Dumare tried her very best, but was
hampered by the gag, and it showed.

�I am going to give you a chance, slave. If
you bite me, then I will make the whip seem like a holiday,� Mistress hissed. 

Slaver came behind Dumare and removed the
gag. The Countess was tempted to bite, but she didn�t. She went straight in
with more desperation than skill. She had little actual experience, normally it
was done to her, or she was able to use her fingers too. It seemed to be
working though, as Dumare licked and sucked, Mistress voiced her approval with
moans of delight. She pushed Dumare�s head in, urging her to go faster.

After a few moments of intense activity,
Mistress let out a final sigh and stepped back. �Good pet�very good,� she said
breathlessly and left the cell with pants in hand.

�You did well,� Slaver said, patting her on
the head.

�Mistress�are you
going to untie me?� Dumare asked, struggling.

Slaver knelt in front of her, then nodded. �Are you going to stay still?�

�Yes, Mistress,� Dumare promised. 

�Good,� Slaver said and left the cell. She
was, as always, thorough, and locked the cell, even though Dumare had utterly
no chance of leaving the cell. She went downstairs though, and Dumare was left
nervously bound in the same position. She was afraid to move, in case she got
in trouble.

Fortunately for her Slaver returned
quickly, this time with tightly wound lengths of rope. �Lay flat. I�m going to
come see you tomorrow�I want you to have escaped from everything except your
collar�I know you can�t get that off.� With that, she unchained her and bound
her wrists, ankles and knees with rope. She also put a tight crotch rope
connected to her wrist bonds, and then left her on the mattress.

&nbsp;

As soon as the cell closed and locked,
Dumare struggled. She could not struggle much at all because of the tightness
of the bondage. Each movement of her hands tugged on her crotch rope, making
her loins tingle and throb with every movement. Rolling on her front again, she
struggled with her legs, but they were hard bound for the moment. She had to
get her wrists free, she reckoned.

So to do this, she knelt up on the mattress
and struggled at the bonds with all her might. The ropes were well done though,
and no matter how much she struggled against her ropes, she could not free
herself or reach a knot. She was afraid she�d be punished, but with no way to
obey, she�d have to accept punishment. Slaver had tied her too well to let her
have any real chance of escape. So, she went to sleep uncomfortably, still bound
by the ropes.

&nbsp;

The next morning she was awoken by Slaver
who looked down on her. �I see you are not free of your ropes.�

Dumare shivered. �I�m sorry,
Mistress�please forgive me!� she said fearfully. Her
inner self could not believe she was acting like this.

Even though she wore a mask, Slaver seemed
to smirk. �I knew you couldn�t escape�I wanted to see your reaction now. Come,
you are wanted.�

Once again Dumare was blindfolded and
gagged, then untied from her ropes and cuffed again.

She was led up into the coolness of the
house, and instead of outside, up more stairs. She walked on soft carpet until
she was dragged into a room. The door closed and locked behind her, and her
blindfold was pulled off.

She was in a room with a balcony, bed and
wardrobe. Mistress was standing on the porch and came in. �Ah, I believe that
your training is almost complete. What you will need more than anything is the
ability to be trusted by your new owner. Are you trustworthy?�

�Yes, Mistress,� Dumare said obediently.

�Would you do anything your Mistress
ordered of you?�

The Countess hesitated, but then nodded. �Yes, Mistress.�

�Such acceptance!� Mistress laughed. �Undo her hands,� she ordered. When this was
done, she handed a long bladed knife to Dumare. �What will you do now? Do you
want to kill me? Take your freedom?�

Dumare looked down at the blade. Yes�she
could see it would be so easy to attack and drive it in, then
escape! Then she had second thoughts. It was a trap, and she knew it. They
wanted her to resist so they could test her. Maybe if she did what she was
supposed to they might let her go. She also figured that she would not be able
to get the blade close enough before the two of them overpowered her.

She put the knife on the carpet. �No,
Mistress. I am a good girl,� she mumbled.

Slaver placed her hands on Dumare�s
shoulders to hold her while Mistress picked up the knife and concealed it
again.

�Very good, pet. Very good. You will spend tonight in this
room. The door and window will be unlocked�but we will know if you leave. If
you show yourself worthy of trust, you will not be punished by us again. Do you
understand?�

�Yes, Mistress,� Dumare said gratefully.

&nbsp;

Dumare was left in the room with no bonds
on her. She could be out the door in a moment and away! To where though? She
strongly suspected that they would know if she left, and that it would not be that
easy to escape. Not that she had anywhere to go. The Countess went to the door
and looked at the control panel. It said the door was unlocked, and she raised
her finger to press the button. Then she reconsidered and lay down on the bed.
She had been good and they had rewarded her so far. Of course, her new owner
might come tomorrow�but since she would be a slave whether she wanted it or
not, she might as well be well behaved and gain something from it.

&nbsp;

The next morning Slaver woke her up and
looked down at her. As she was wearing the mask, it was impossible to read the
expression. �You were good, pet. You were very obedient.�

�Thank you�Mistress,� Dumare said, smiling
up.

�Good girl. Roll over and let me cuff you.
Be brave,� Slaver advised as she added the ankle and wrist cuffs, then the gag
and blindfold.

Dumare was led outside, into the shade of
the building. Her blindfold was removed and she was pulled over to a metal pole
sunk into a concrete base. Her bonds were redone so the pole was holding her in
place. She could turn in a circle, but could not move away, though she could
get to her knees.

Slaver made sure the locks were secure, then nodded to Mistress.

�We decided that we would do this in the
open air. I trust there are no objections?�

�No, Mistress! Of course
not!�

�Good. Now�you will be asked to sign your
contract. That will make things legal. Then you will have your bracelet welded
on, and you will be your new Mistress� slave. Do you understand?�

�We-welded, Mistress?� Dumare asked, shivering.

�Not to your skin,� Mistress said
condescendingly. �But you should meet your new owner now,� she said, walking
off.

Slaver wandered over and let her hands
wander over Dumare�s body. Just a few short days ago, the Countess would have
shied away, but now she stood rock still until Slaver was satisfied with her
passiveness.

It was then that the knowledge that she had
been tamed hit her. A week before she would be fought, as she had on the first
day, but now, the weight of reality crushed the need to survive into her. She
would be a slave, so she might as well be a good one while working out an
escape.

&nbsp;

Her reverie was interrupted by a well
dressed woman with hood and cloak that covered her face. She wore blue, and had
gloves over her hands.

�So�this is my pet, is it?� she asked. The
voice was vaguely familiar to Dumare, but she was too nervous to think about it
much.

�Well?� Mistress demanded haughtily of
Dumare.

�Yes�Master. I am.�

�Kneel!� she ordered Dumare thought of her
as Master. Master reached out and slapped her hard on the cheek. �No more fun
and games, you are mine now,� she hissed.

�Master-� Dumare
started.

�Silence!� her buyer ordered. �You know
what happens to bad slaves!�

The memory of those words�spoken at a
different time, came home to Dumare. �Please, Master-� she
tried.

�No! You are mine for now!� her new owner
said coldly.

Those words were a haunting echo to a
painful memory in the Countess� past. She was afraid.

&nbsp;

With a dramatic motion, Master pushed back
her hood to reveal�Vassha Vailea.

&nbsp;

At first Allie Dumare could not believe her
eyes. They widened, and her mouth opened and closed, then she shook her head
frantically.

�Oh no�no�no!� she said. She struggled with
her bonds as Vassha advanced.

�What goes around,� Vassha whispered,
�comes around.�

�No�no, please, don�t do this!� Dumare
begged.

�Do you remember I said that to you? Did
you let me go when you had me at your mercy? Did you let any of us go?�

�No�.� Dumare whispered softly.

�Then why should I do the same? Maybe a few
lessons from me would teach you?�

�No�please. I beg you!� she said, her eyes
tearing up. �I�m sorry, so sorry! Please�forgive me!�

Vassha leaned her face very close to
Dumare�s frightened visage. �And why should I believe you? Five days ago you
violated me and my trust. And showed no remorse for it, none.�

Dumare struggled futilely, and bowed her
head. �I guess I deserved all this.�

�Indeed, but you can still change. I am
willing to forgive you.�

�Forgive me?� the Countess asked hopefully.

�If you are truly sorry, then I am willing
to believe you, are you truly sorry? It is not just me, I am sure,
you have done it to others?�

�Yes�for longer, and more dangerous,�
Dumare admitted.

�Well, then it is a problem with yourself.
You are a Countess�and for you, you have the choice not to give in to this.�

Dumare nodded. �I�m sorry,� she said, and
surprised herself by meaning it.

&nbsp;

�Then, perhaps I should tell you a little
secret?� Vassha said with a smirk and nodded to Slaver and Mistress.

They walked around in front of Dumare and
pulled off their masks. The faces beneath were instantly recognisable.
�Mistress� was none other than Angerau, the woman who had been so very angry at
the treatment of Vassha. �Slaver� was even more incredible, for it was the
subject of half the galaxy�s celebrity gossip: Adril Tythorin.

�You!� Dumare said, staring at Adril. �Wha-what are you doing here? And you, Angerau? What is happening?�

�To each of us we have a lesson to learn in
life,� Adril said sweetly. Now without the mask and the voice distorter, her
speech was more recognisable as hers. �Mine was similar to yours; that we are
only what we make ourselves. I was once a woman who cared for nothing but
reputation, glory and obedience. Like you, I believed those below me were
inferior, though not because of birth, but because of my achievements. You,
Allie Dumare, have everything, you must learn what so
many fail to understand.�

�So�this was all a trick?� Dumare asked in
amazement. �Let me go now!� she ordered, her confidence returning.

�No,� Adril said sadly. She sighed. �Yes,
it was a trick, an exceptionally well done one, even you must agree.�

�Yes�it was,� Dumare said, struggling
against the chains. �Now, untie me!�

�You have learned nothing,� Angerau said
grimly and turned away.

�Wait! You can�t leave me here!� Dumare
shouted.

�The blindest are those who refuse to see.
And you, my dear, refuse to accept something before your very eyes.�

Dumare stared at their retreating forms.
Memories of the last four days contrasted painfully with her own memories of
the women she had forced into worse situations. She chose the girls from the
lowest areas and made them hers, and she made them fear her. And then there was
the one who had�died. She�d not even known her name.

�Wait�� she said quietly.

Adril turned. �Yes, my dear?�

�How did you find out about�the others?�

�Quite simple, my dear,� Adril said. �What
you did to Vassha was terrible, but it would not warrant this. No, I talked to
one of your family�s pets�the one who escaped. And I realised that what you did
to Vassha was just the beginning, that you were obsessed with power over
people.�

�I�I see now,� Dumare said, taking a long
breath.

�I hope so,� said the new voice. It was
Buyer, the one who had �bought� Kalinai. She walked from the shadows, and
Dumare saw it was a face from long ago.

�Is-Isari?� Dumare asked softly. Isari had been a slave of her families�her
first �toy�.

�The very same. Now�we are both here. I saw you that night with the girl who died.
It was an accident�but you just got rid of her like she was nothing.�

Memory came back to the Countess, and she
shuddered. �Are you going to kill me?� Dumare asked softly. Tears ran down her
cheeks, and the way she felt, she clearly believed she deserved it.

�No, I am not. I am not a vengeful person,
though I was tempted when I saw you in that house, to confront you, I did not.
What you did to me, and others was bad�and to those
others there, but I know you can change. Perhaps this has made you think of
that.�

�Yes�I suppose it has,� Dumare said and
sighed. �I am sorry, to all of you. I want to change, because you are right. I
lived my life badly�very badly. And I want to change.�

�Do you promise then, on your soul, your
life, your being that you mean that?� Adril asked intently. �Hurting you would
have proved that we were as bad as you were. And trying to convict you in court
would be futile and would have changed nothing. So we decided to give you a
chance at redemption.�

Dumare nodded. Though a stubborn part of
her hated to admit it, she had changed in the four days. Guilt had built in her
over her captivity, and now she realised, to her horror, that she had rather enjoyed
her time here. It was a disturbing revelation.

�I�I accept.�

Angerau stepped forward and put a small box
onto her forehead. �Say it again.�

�I am truly sorry to Isari�and Vassha.
And�I want to make it up to them�and redeem my past.�

Angerau nodded and pocketed the box. �She
tells the truth.� The madam leaned forward and gave the anxious Dumare a kiss.
�Let�s get you washed up, shall we?�

Dumare smiled for the first time�for a long
while. �Please,� she replied, returning the kiss.

Epilogue

&nbsp;

�Okay�that�s enough, dear,� Adril said
breathlessly.

From between her legs, Allie Dumare�s face
looked up anxiously. �Did I do wrong, Mistress?�

Adril knelt down, petting her pet on the
head. She was naked, and as she undid Dumare�s bonds, her body rubbed against
the Countess�. �You did most excellently. I must admit�I am surprised by your
transformation. I mean, we wanted to shock you, teach you a lesson, and make
you change your ways. None of us expected you to turn into a submissive like
you have!�

Dumare blushed. �Well, you know. I did a
lot of thinking about what you, and the others said.� She stood as the last
bonds were removed. �And I realise that what I did was very wrong. But�it never
seemed wrong at the time. Hell, my father never had less than a half dozen
�servants� around him. But I killed someone. It was an accident, but that
didn�t teach me anything. So, I figure I�ll find out what life on the other
side is like.�

�Well�yeah,� Adril replied uncertainly.
�But we�re not making you stay here! I mean�you are welcome to stay and be my
pet, but you�re heir to a Sector Governorship.� It had taken a minor diplomatic
miracle for Dumare to come back in the midst of a search after she had been
assumed kidnapped.

Dumare smirked. �A week ago, that was the
most important thing to me, but not now. I told father I was staying here for
research for my university courses. And I will do that, but I want a bit of excitement.�

�You�ve changed,� Adril said, laying a hand
over the girl�s bare shoulders.

�I have been doing some thinking, as I
said. Would Mr Tavenar accept me, you think? I mean�I was quite mean to him.�

�I think that the nature of your sincerity
will become quite apparent to him. So�are you my pet? You don�t have to be!�

Dumare bowed her head. �Let�s just see how
it goes�Mistress.�

Satisfied with the answer, Adril led her
away.
