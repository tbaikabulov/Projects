Staying in the Dark

Chapter one

John was a very tall man (if you could call him that) who never had any friends and always stayed to the shadows. He stalked his pray, jumping from roof to roof watching her walking on the street below of the city.

Her name was Molly and to look into a crowd she did not stand out, she was 5&#8217;2 and had an athletic body, with long dark hair.&nbsp;&nbsp; She wore jeans that hugged her legs going down into a pair of leather flat soled boots.&nbsp;&nbsp; For the top half she wore a warm woollen jumper and a long black cashmere coat that want all the way to her feet.
She had picked the coat because it was warm and soft as it brushed against her skin of her neck.&nbsp;&nbsp; As the coat brushed against her she could feel the two daggers up each sleeve on her body and the gun under her arm with another knife at her back.

As John looked down at her; he knew she could sense he was there following always staying to the shadows until he was ready to spring his trap on her.&nbsp;&nbsp; As the snow began to fall again she felt the vampire on the rooftops following her, getting closer and closer as he got braver.&nbsp;&nbsp; She just smiled as she mentally prepared herself for the fight to come.

She then sensed another vampire down a little close to her left and he was about to feed on a young blond woman.&nbsp;&nbsp; Molly ran down the close and as she came out into the courtyard at the end she saw the girl struggling as the vampire bit into her neck tasting the blood from the blond.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Molly grabbed her knife from her left wrist and ran at the vampire. As she leaped into the air she felt something hit her from the back of her head. 

Even though the blow stunned her, she was strong and did not let this put her off her attack. The vampire looked up and threw the blond to one side while trying to side step Molly.&nbsp;&nbsp; But he was too late as she landed on his chest and as the vampire went to grab her she sliced him through with her silver bladed dagger, cutting as deep as she could.&nbsp;&nbsp; The vampire started to fall to his knees as she fell to her feet beside him finishing the cut and killing him dead.&nbsp;&nbsp; She turned just in time to see another Vampire come down the close, maybe one of the biggest vamps she had ever seen.&nbsp;&nbsp; She then heard a whoosh sound as John jumped down from where he had been watching.

Molly went for her gun and shot at the vamp in the alley hitting him in the legs not hurting him badly but slowing him down.&nbsp;&nbsp; Before she could get a head shot off, John had moved lightning fast and knocked the gun from her hand.&nbsp;&nbsp; Keeping her cool she went for her second dagger as the vampire made it to the end of the close.&nbsp;&nbsp; He got ready to fight, moving his feet into a fighting stance and bring his hand up in a guard.&nbsp;&nbsp; He started to edge closer watching for her move as she started to try to get back into a corner so her back was not exposed to the two vampires and she could see them both.
John had moved to the left side only giving Molly the option to take a smaller close on her right as she tried to find some space to fight.&nbsp;&nbsp; As they both moved in together John was thinking that his plan could not be going better as he watched her edge towards the close where he wanted her.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The vampire lashed out with a kick as his bullet wounds were now starting to heal up and he was gaining his strength.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Molly suddenly felt the presence of another vampire above her head as she blocked the vampires kick and swiped his other leg out from under him causing him to fall to the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp; As she went to slice his head off to kill him suddenly she heard a whooshing sound of the other vampire jumping down from the tops of the roofs to the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp; Molly could not react fast enough to get out of the way and the vampire landed on her back knocking her to the ground.&nbsp; As Molly hit the ground the wind was knocked out of her and she dropped her dagger.&nbsp;&nbsp; John moved fast to kick the dagger away from the vampire slayer so she was now unarmed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her only weapon left was a simple gold cross that she wore round her neck.&nbsp;&nbsp; Molly struggled to breathe as her lungs did not want to work with the weight of the vampire on top of her.&nbsp;&nbsp; As she started to black out she could feel the vampire&#8217;s fangs at her neck.&nbsp;&nbsp; �STOP� John commanded the vampire �I want her alive.�&nbsp;&nbsp; The Vampire stopped and with an unhappy look about him said �very well my lord�.&nbsp;&nbsp; As he stepped of her molly got to her hands and knees and started to fight to get air into her lungs, as it started to flow freely in and out, in and out.&nbsp;&nbsp; She jumped to her feel lashing out at John; he blocked it and kicked her legs out from under her.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she felt something hard and metal hit the back of her head as she start to fall forward, John upper-cutting her in the jaw.&nbsp;&nbsp; She fell to the ground out for the count, trying to fight the blackness that was coming over her, telling herself that she could not let it happen.&nbsp;&nbsp; Molly could feel cuffs being put on her wrists as they weere secured behind her back and then the blackness came. 

John wanted to be careful so he had his two vampire minions bind her legs and then place her inside a heavy-duty body bag that had some holes so she could breath.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John suddenly heard a wheezing sound coming from the blond girl as she woke up as a vampire.&nbsp;&nbsp; He walked over and looking down at her, said �bloody mongrels� and then ripped her head off of the blond&#8217;s body.&nbsp;&nbsp; He then walked over to the fallen vampire looked at him and turned to his minions saying �He died with honour, now leave them hear for the sunlight to clean up and lets go�.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He heard the usual �yes my lord� as they both talked together and followed him into the under ground streets of Edinburgh.

Molly woke up slowly with her head feeling like it was hosting an underground rave.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her vision blurred. She was not even going to attempt to stand as her head continued with the thump, thump, thump of the pain inside her skull.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John was watching her from his office smiling since the vampires had never managed to catch one of the slayers in the three hundred years of his life.&nbsp;&nbsp; He watched on the monitor as Molly slowly tested her restraints and her look of panic when she discovered that she was naked.

John had two vampires go into the room and cuff her arms and legs as she was freed she leapt at the first vampire smashing his head into the wall, killing him outright as his skull caved in.&nbsp;&nbsp; The second vampire made a run to the door, but he could not get it open, as he turned to fight her felt a knee hit his balls, the room filled with screaming as the pain exploded inside of him.&nbsp;&nbsp; He fell to the ground clutching what was left of his manhood with tears running down his cheeks.&nbsp;&nbsp; Molly snapped his neck and the room suddenly went quiet.&nbsp;&nbsp; A bright UV light came on in the room and the two dead vampires just became dust.&nbsp;&nbsp; John smiled at the monitor thinking of the fun he was going to have breaking this warrior and making her his little plaything.

Molly was breathing quiet heavily from the fight as the UV lights were turned off.&nbsp;&nbsp; She looked round her prison and saw that it was very basic, a toilet that did not flush, a shower that did not work and a bed with no mattress--just a wooden board.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she saw two weird things sticking out of the wall that where shaped like dildos.&nbsp;&nbsp; One was blue and had water written above it the other was black and had food written above it. 

She suddenly heard a voice come over a speaker, as John talked into the microphone from the comfort of his leather chair.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said �I hope you have enjoyed your stay so far.&nbsp; You will be punished later for killing my two guards�.&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly she heard a buzz and the ground started to shock her as she jumped from tip toe to tip toe making her way to her bed for safety just as she was about to step on it spikes came though holes in the wooden board making it impossible to stand on.&nbsp;&nbsp; The shock continued for what felt like a life time to Molly but was only about ten minutes before john hit a switch and they stopped.&nbsp;&nbsp; She was exhausted but the spikes still covered her mattress so she could not lie on it and was to afraid to lie on the floor in case she got shocked again. 

John hit the switch on the microphone and started to talk again �that was the lowest setting bitch.&nbsp; If you do anything stupid I will turn it up next time be warned.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I am sure you have had a good look around your cell looking for an escape. Let me tell you there is not one. The door to that room is a double air lock with a vacuum in the middle and both air locks are kept flooded. The walls are all solid steel with reinforced concrete behind them and to help you out if you try to escape we will release a gas into the room that will knock you out.� Molly looked at the camera and said �Fuck you!&nbsp; My friends will rescue me�.&nbsp;&nbsp; At that moment a shock ran though the floor that knocked Molly off of her feet.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As she got back to her feet she could hear John talking again �think what you will for you are mine now to do with was I like.&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw you trying to flush the toilet and turn the shower on. These are privileges that you will have to earn. Do I make myself clear?&nbsp;&nbsp; The two dildos that stick out from the wall are where you will get your food and water from.&nbsp; All you have to do is put them deep in your mouth and suck, but if you do not put them deep enough nothing will come out�. Laughing, John finished with �I hope you enjoy your stay.� The speaker went dead and Molly was left alone again.

Molly used the toilet then went over to her bed and lay down to try and get some sleep. She knew she would need her strength to survive this.&nbsp;&nbsp; As she slowly drifted off to sleep tears slowly rolled down her face as she knew would not be taken back by the slayers after being captured in case the vampires had messed with her mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; She thought of her boyfriend Patrick and how much she loved him.&nbsp;&nbsp; How he took her in his arms and hugged her and kissed her softly each night when she came home.&nbsp;&nbsp; She loved the fact that he respected her beliefs of waiting til marriage and he had agreed to that himself.&nbsp;&nbsp; As she drifted off she could hear the last words he said before she had left the flat. �Be strong, I love you�.&nbsp;&nbsp; Molly found a dark and dreamless sleep that night as she wondered how her life was going to change. 









Chapter 2

As day light broke into the sky the two vampire bodies in the close turned to dust, as John want to his bed to die for the day with his lesser already dead in there rooms.&nbsp;&nbsp; Molly was just steering and remembering everything that had happened.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

As she got up she felt so hungry and thirsty but she was not going to give them the satisfaction of eating though the dildos.&nbsp;&nbsp; She used the toilet and then started into a hard workout routine, 100 sit up, press up, jumping jacks, and jogging on the spot until she could jog no more.&nbsp;&nbsp; Covered in sweat she walked to the shower and tried the water, forgetting that there was no water.&nbsp;&nbsp; Starting to feel the chill from the seat on her body she went back to the bed and curled up to try and stay warm.&nbsp;&nbsp; She drifted off to sleep out of boredom.

In another part of the city, Patrick was waking up.&nbsp;&nbsp; As he reached over to kiss Molly he realized she was not there.&nbsp;&nbsp; She was normally in bed by now; he got up and went for his shower.&nbsp;&nbsp; As he raped a towel round his waist he picked out his suit for the day and a pink shirt and matching tie.&nbsp;&nbsp; Five minutes later he had his suit on and was ready for a day at the office.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Checking his phone he thought it weird that she had not at lest called to tell him she was ok.&nbsp;&nbsp; He flipped the phone open and hit speed dial 1 putting him strait though to the slayers head quarters.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Patrick put the phone to his hear he could hear the phone on the other end ringing, on the seventh ring.&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly he heard a voice come down the line at him �Hay Paddy, how it hanging?�&nbsp;&nbsp; Patrick recognised the voice from when he was a slayer, and replied �Hay G, its hanging low man�.&nbsp;&nbsp; Which was the code for something was wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
G then asked �Did Molly come home last night? Cause she hasn&#8217;t signed in�
Patrick with a look of worry said �Call me G when she does�.&nbsp;&nbsp; G then said you know the drill Patrick she has 12 hours then the Slayers go dark and you won&#8217;t be fit to get in touch.�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Patrick being the outsider, since he no longer worked for them, new that he would never see any of them again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He grabbed his case and ran to catch the bus to work. 

Mean while back in the underground things where quit as John and his team slept guarded by humans that they had whipped the minds of and turned in to slaves. 
Molly lay on her bed shivering; it was as if some one had turned the heating of in her room.&nbsp;&nbsp; She thought to her self that&#8217;s this was the beginning of them trying to break her will and spirit, but she thought that they where going to get one hell of a fight.&nbsp;&nbsp; She was ready if anyone walked though that door to kill them and take the punishment, cause molly new she was stronger than they thought.&nbsp;&nbsp; She was a warrior, a fighter and that blood that coiled though her veins made her strong.&nbsp; 

Suddenly molly felt the spikes on her bed rise out of the wooden mattress as she jumped off her bed; she felt the first shock hit her foot.&nbsp;&nbsp; God she thought not this again.&nbsp;&nbsp; As she jumped from foot to foot as shock after shock hit her body, she did not know how long they did this for but she was never going to let them see her pain.&nbsp;&nbsp; She started laughing and shouting �is this the best you can do, scared to face me think your two week�.&nbsp;&nbsp; The shocks suddenly got more intense she laughed now only to hold back the tears and screams.&nbsp;&nbsp; The suddenly heard a voice that she did not recognise �You can stand in the blue squares and not get shocked�.&nbsp;&nbsp; She looked around franticly trying to find the blue squares then she saw them in the middle of the room.&nbsp;&nbsp; They where a 2� square and about 3&#8217;, she found she could only stand on her tip toes and she was spread in a very exposed way.&nbsp;&nbsp; This gave the person on the other end of the feed a lovely look at her body with legs wide open of all to see.&nbsp;&nbsp; For the first time since her capture she felt naked, vulnerable and alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She new that the only person that would come looking for her was Patrick and even he was not strong enough for John and the other Vampires he controlled.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She felt the cave muscles start to strain and cramp and then she lost her balance and.&nbsp;&nbsp; As she feel to the floor she prepared for the shock but there was nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp; They where toying with her she thought to herself.&nbsp;&nbsp; She want over to the toilet and set down, as she want to cross her legs there was a shock run though the metal toilet.&nbsp;&nbsp; She jumped up as the voice talked once again �no crossing you legs are you will be punished�. 

Molly had no choice now but to drink some water she was so thirsty. She walked over two the wall and crouched down putting her mouth to the dildo she started to suck the end but nothing came out.&nbsp;&nbsp; She sucked then she tried biting and sucking but she could get nothing from it.&nbsp;&nbsp; She heard the Voice again �pleasure it like it&#8217;s a cock to get water�.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mollies checks burned as she slipped her lips over the dildo and started to bob her head up and down on it.&nbsp;&nbsp; A tear ran from her eye at the humiliation she was made to suffer, &#8216;why did they not just kill her&#8217; she thought.&nbsp;&nbsp; She then started to feel water squirt out of the dildo into the back of her mouth she drank it down still thirsty but glad to have had some water.
The shocks continued randomly throughout the entire day, unbeknown to Molly since she did not know what time it was.

As the day came to a close, Patrick decided to head home and get his weapons.&nbsp;&nbsp; He swore to himself under his breath �he would not sleep until she was with him again.�&nbsp;&nbsp; Being a man of his word he planed to keep it and he did not care how many vampires he had to kill to find her.&nbsp;&nbsp; He new that the slayers would not help as they would be moving to keep there location hidden from the vamps, he was on his own.&nbsp;&nbsp; As he jumped on the bus and found a seat the journey was long as he thought of where to start looking for her.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
He got off the bus at his stop and walked towards his apartment, as he turned down the close there was a man standing in front of him.&nbsp;&nbsp; The man was in rags and held out his hand and asked �you got some spare change sir?� Patrick looked at him and knowing he did not have time ignored him, as he pushed past the the bagger suddenly said �give me you money are I will cut you�.&nbsp;&nbsp; At that Patrick stopped and turned to the bagger steering him in the eye he could see the fear in the man&#8217;s eyes at this action.&nbsp;&nbsp; Patrick then in a low menacing voice said �Trust me I don&#8217;t need a knife, I will rip you apart with my bear hands�.&nbsp;&nbsp; The beggar ran off down the close scared at the challenge and seeing burning in his eyes. 
As Patrick want into the apartment he ran a hot shower and washed off the grim of the day, he knew it was going to be a long night.&nbsp;&nbsp; As her got out of the shower he, heard the beep from his phone and knew he no longer had the slayers as back up.&nbsp;&nbsp; Reaching in the top shelf of his wardrobe he took down his old leathers and put them on.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The leather against the skin felt good, he reached for his long leather trench coat and sung it on over his shoulders.&nbsp;&nbsp; The last touch was the daggers that lived in a wooden box.&nbsp;&nbsp; He opened the box and muttered to him self �Hello old friends�&nbsp;&nbsp; slipping them into the trench coat he was ready.&nbsp;&nbsp; He want down to the garage and though the back door out into the night streets.

John woke up back at the underground ready for a night time&#8217;s fun with Molly.&nbsp;&nbsp; He knew that his human slave had been torturing her all day was she ready to break yet he wondered.&nbsp;&nbsp; The he thought to himself with a smile &#8216;it would be a shame if she did&#8217;.&nbsp;&nbsp; Getting dressed into some jeans and a black t, he bent down put on some socks and then his shit kickers.&nbsp;&nbsp; The boot had been specially made that when he hit his heel off the other boot a spike would come out of the toe.&nbsp;&nbsp; Smiling to him self he walked down the corroder to his office.&nbsp;&nbsp; As he set in his chair he saw that molly was still had not been broken and he was glad cause he wanted the job himself.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
He hit the switch on the mic and talked �I hope you have had a good day bitch and my slaves have not hurt you two much.&nbsp;&nbsp; A Drawer will open in a few second beside the door put the cuffs on behind you back�

Molly looked over to the door as she heard a sliding sound and a bit of the wall moved and a drawer appeared, as it opened she looked inside she saw the cuffs, being defined she look up at the camera flipped it the bird and said �why don&#8217;t you make me�.&nbsp;&nbsp; Showing she spirit that made who she was a warrior, tormented all day and still defiant.&nbsp;&nbsp; She heard on word over the speaker �Fine�, the floor suddenly exploded with electricity much stronger than she had felt before.&nbsp;&nbsp; She tried to fight it but eventfully with a scream she passed out.

Patrick had hit the streets he was back and he was angry.&nbsp;&nbsp; He new in his hart he could not live without Molly, his love, his wife and companion.&nbsp;&nbsp; He did not have the gift of being able to sense vampire like Molly, but they always found him when he want hunting.&nbsp;&nbsp; He walked up the royal mile to the castle and looked out across the city wondering where hi love was.&nbsp;&nbsp; But there was no tears in his eyes cause he new she was alive he could feel it.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
He walked back down the Royal Mile when suddenly he heard a scream coming from a close.&nbsp;&nbsp; �Bingo� he muttered as he walked toward the close.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As he opened his jacket so he could get his daggers, if he needed them.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end he saw a vampire finishing with a young girl who looked like a student.&nbsp;&nbsp; As he looked up at john he let the girl drop dead to the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp; Patrick looked at the vampire and smiled he was angry and hurt and this is where his revenge would begin.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The Vampire dropped into a fighting stance, as Patrick thought &#8216;where are these guys learning this shit&#8217;.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
He look the Vamp in the eyes and said �I will let you live for to night if you tell me where the captured slayer is?�&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The Vampire smiled at Patrick saying �over my dead body would I tell you that�
Patrick looked at him calm and ready and said �I&#8217;m down with that�

The vampire made the first move a punch that knocked Patrick on his ass against a wall.&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8216;God I&#8217;m rusty&#8217; he thought to him self, as he rolled to the left to avoid a kick.&nbsp;&nbsp; The kick hit the wall with a crunch.&nbsp;&nbsp; As Patrick jumped to his feet the vampire limped at him with a wild swing from his left fist.&nbsp;&nbsp; Patrick Ducked and in a swift motion drew a dagger and slashed the vampires other leg causing him to fall to the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Patrick looked down at the vampire and smiled as he said �do you still not want to tell me�.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The vampire between gasps of pain whaled �fuck you�.
Patrick reached into his coat and pulled out a silver cross the vampire tried to crawl away but was followed by Patrick.&nbsp;&nbsp; When they got to the end of the close Patrick set the cross on the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the Vamp he said �what you going to do now? I can leave you trapped here to the sun comes up�.
The vampire climbed to his feet using the wall to steady himself, he swung with his free arm.&nbsp;&nbsp; Patrick blocked and slashed right to the bone leaving it hanging off and blood running freely unto the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The Vampire slouched to the ground saying �They will torture me if I tell you�
Patrick said �and I will torture you if you don&#8217;t, do you know what holly water will do you your balls and they won&#8217;t regenerate�
A look of true horror came over the vampires face as he thought of life with out sex would be like.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he said �I can&#8217;t�.
Patrick reached into his coat putting the dagger away he brought out a wee bottle of holy water.&nbsp;&nbsp; Patrick said �This is you last chance to talk bitch�.
As the vampire reached to protect him self with his good arm, Patrick kicked it two the ground.&nbsp; As Patrick Stamped on his arm, bones breaking echoed thought out the close.&nbsp;&nbsp; Patrick opened the bottle and as he turned it for the first drop hit the Vamps trousers where his balls would be he said �ok I&#8217;ll talk, just not that, please�&nbsp;&nbsp; Patrick replied �well hurry up then, before my hand slips�.
The Vamp spat the words out �She is being held be Prince John some where in the underground�&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Patrick looks at him shouting �where in the underground?� 
The Vamp replied scared �I don&#8217;t know�
Patrick turned around and took a step away, as he heard the Vampire taking a breath of relief he snapped back drawing his dagger and took its head right off.
Picking up his cross he walked off in search of his Love.&nbsp;&nbsp; He new that royalty was well protected and this would not be easy, he thought &#8216;if they have hurt her, scared her, they where dead&#8217;.

Back in the underground Molly, opened her eye to find she was lying on the floor.&nbsp;&nbsp; She tried to move then realized they had cuffed her hands behind her back, while she had been out cold.&nbsp;&nbsp; She heard a voice from in the room �Get up bitch�.&nbsp;&nbsp; When she did not move she felt a wipe crack down on her back.&nbsp;&nbsp; She gritted her teeth as john started wiping her shouting �I told you to get up bitch�.&nbsp;&nbsp; With the blows getting harder and harder she struggled to her feet.&nbsp;&nbsp; As she got up she turned to face John as the wipe caught her left nipple she let out a scream.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She went to kick him but he stepped to the side and she fell down, John continued �I said get up bitch; you will learn to do what you are told�.&nbsp;&nbsp; She struggled to her feet as her back ass and legs started to turn red.&nbsp;&nbsp; John put the whip away and pulled out a longer one that he could hit her with anywhere in the room.&nbsp;&nbsp; She looked at him as the first blow landed on her ass, she screamed as panic took over her.&nbsp;&nbsp; She ran to the corner but the blows just kept coming, she ran and tried to dodge she thought I have to get away from him I have to.&nbsp;&nbsp; The new whip was opening up cut with blood flowing feely.&nbsp;&nbsp; Molly started to sweet and pant as the was kept on her toes running and dodging, but every blow landed on its mark.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her tits where red and puffy, blood flowed from her back, ass and thighs, between the loud crack of the whip and her screams all she could hear was John saying �you will learn to do what you told when you&#8217;re told slave�.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Session continued for about three hours, as he stopped whipping her.&nbsp;&nbsp; Molly could only fall to her knees and try and get some air into her lungs, she was exhausted and he had never given her a chance to attack him.&nbsp;&nbsp; John walked over to his captured slayer that would soon be his slave.&nbsp;&nbsp; As he looked at her with her head hung down sweet mixed with blood dripping from her body, her chest rising and falling.&nbsp; He knew that one day she would offer her body freely.&nbsp;&nbsp; He walked over lifted her head and said �There is only so Much you can take, before you become mine.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217;m glad your strong so I can beet your will out of you more slowly�.&nbsp;&nbsp; She looked up at him and Spat in his face and said �Go fuucc� she did not get the rest our as he backhanded her and it all went dark.
