 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The incident I am about to describe to you took place a year ago. It was summer vacation and I was spending it on my uncle&#8217;s ranch. My uncle had bought the ranch a few years before and hadn&#8217;t done much to it. He was still living in town where he worked and lived. The ranch was a three hour drive from his house. The ranch sat up in the hills. It was a great place to spend time because it was very peaceful and very secluded. The ranch its self was over two hundred acres but on either side of it was state land which no one owned or really went on. It sat in a valley and had multiple creeks running through it but the surrounding hills were barren. My uncle had let me stay on there for free for the summer as long as I took care of the place. Taking care of the place wasn&#8217;t hard. Mostly it involved taking care of the horses and making sure the fields got watered. I spent most of the time lounging out side sunbathing naked. I love lying out in the sun bare ass naked. And if anyone were ever to watch they would too. I am a five foot six; I have a nice body and a very nice set of tits. Besides looking good seeing a naked girl sunning her freshly shaving crotch is a sight I am sure mostly people would like to see. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I had been experimenting with self bondage for a very long time and had tried it out a couple of times while I was on the ranch. The problem was it wasn&#8217;t very exciting. It was hard to tie myself in good positions that kept my attention for very long. I had been skinny dipping in the creek and had started taking walks around the property naked but never found either too exciting. I have even saddled up one of the horses and took them out riding wearing nothing at all. I was in the barn one day trying to come up with something that would be exciting to try when I got an idea after finding an old saddle that was here when my uncle bought the ranch. Since it wasn&#8217;t one of his I knew I could do what I wanted with it and he would never know. I took the saddle down from where it was hanging on the wall then headed to the tool shed. I found two shovel handles that I figured no one would miss then headed back to the barn. In the barn were the tools for fixing up the ranch that I planned to use to set things up. I put the shovel handles in a vice and cut the top seven inches off each. The shovel handles where an inch and a half in diameter with rounded tops and would serve as plugs for my holes. With the shovel handles cut I then took a power drill to the saddle and drilled two small holes in the base of the saddle then drilled holes in the bottom of each handle. The holes would be used to put screws through to secure the new plugs to the saddle. Before I put the plugs on I placed the saddle on a wooden horse. The small cross beam things you use to put boards on to cut. With the saddle on the wooden horse I got on it and started adjusting the stirrups. I lengthened the stirrups until I was sitting on the saddle with my legs fully extended. If I stood on my toes I could raise myself about four inches off the saddle which would relieve myself a little of the plugs but wouldn&#8217;t allow me to get off them. With the stirrups set at their new height I took a couple of pieces of wire and wound them through the stirrup holes with a pair of pliers. I would need the pliers if I wanted to change the height of the stirrups now. With the stirrups finished I used two screws to secure the handles to the saddle. The plugs were positioned so when I mounted the saddle they would go into my cunt and ass. There were only a few things left to do. The first was to saddle up one of the horses. There were several horses on the ranch to choose from. I decided to go with Colt; he was a beautiful black stallion. I didn&#8217;t usually ride him because he had a tendency to do what he wanted and not listen to you. I went out to his pen where he was kept with reins in hand. Leading him back to the barn I saddled him up under a beam in the barn roof. I planned on using the beam to lower my self onto the saddle since I couldn&#8217;t use the stirrups to get enough height to get over the plugs. The last thing to do was make a quit trip to the house. I was really getting excited about doing this. As I got to the house I was starting to have second thoughts. I knew there was no way I could get off of the horse once I was in the field. The only way to dismount would be to get back to the barn and use one the beams or to find a tree branch then walk across the field naked. I also knew that if someone came I could just ride the horse to a different area of the property and be safe. It seemed really disappointing to know I could be safe so easily and I really wanted to do something outrageous. Walking inside I went for my backpack that had my toys and condoms. I had originally hoped there would be some sexy farm hands on one of the nearby ranches so I could have some midnight rendezvous this summer but that plan had fallen through. I grabbed two condoms, my lube and on a whim I grabbed my pair of handcuffs. Before I left the house I grabbed the handcuff key and the string that was in ice in the freezer. I had been using the ice cube method of release this summer to get out of the other self bondage positions I had put my self in. The key was tied to one end of a long string that was looped over a couple of times with the loop being held by the ice. When the ice melted the looped part of the string would uncoil letting the string fall a couple of feet. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With my items in hand I walked back to the barn. When I got to the barn I stripped all my cloths off and threw them into a pile in the corner of the barn. Next I took the condoms out of their packages and rolled one down each of the plugs. The condoms were rough riders with studs on them to add to the sensation. I then took a little lube and applied it to each of the condoms. I was almost done. I took the key string and tied the free end loosely around my neck. Then I took the cuffs in my hand and locked one end around my left wrist so they would stay there. One last step, I put my foot into the stirrup and stood up. I reached up. Grabbing the beam I pulled myself above the two plugs and swung my leg over the other side. I very slowly lowered my self down onto the plugs. As soon as my toes were touching the stirrups I let go of the beam. I was now standing on my toes with at least three inches of the plugs in me while my legs were held wide apart on either side of the horse. Before I had second thoughts I took the rains in my hand and got Colt moving. I steered Colt out to the open field. My calves were already starting to burn so I lowered myself the rest of the way onto the plugs. God I felt full. Every step the horse took got transmitted to me through the plugs. I steered Colt around a little then decided to test things out. I gave him a quick kick in the sides and told him to go. We were flying across the field at a full gallop. I was bouncing and moving on the saddle as much as the plugs would allow. By the time we got to the back field my pussy was a little sore and soaking wet. When we got to the middle of the field I put the last part of my plan into motion. I took the ends of the reins and tied them to the saddle horn. This way the reins wouldn&#8217;t hit the ground but they were still loose enough that Colt could move his head in any way he wanted with out the reins affecting him. With that done I took the string around my neck and turned it so that it was hanging down my back. Then I placed my hands behind my back and closed the other cuff around my right wrist. I was stuck on the horse and just along for the ride until the ice melted and I could free my hands. I figured it would only take about an hour since the noon sun had really headed things up. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was really exciting sitting there on a horse naked and out of control. If someone came not only could I not run and hide but I was also on a horse adding a whole knew bizarre twist to things. All I could do was wait for the hour or so that it was going to take for the ice to melt. I was really horny sitting there. I tried wiggling around to move the plugs inside of me so I could get a little relief. As I moved around I tapped Colt on his sides with my foot which he took as a signal to move. Colt began a lazy walk through the field while I sat on top trying to wiggle around on the two plugs inside of me. With the control out of my hand Colt was free to go where he pleased. He had been walking around for about ten minutes before he realized he was in control. I think he must have started smelling my juices at this point because he was really starting to get excited. He started going back and forth across the field at a trot. I was bouncing up and down trying to concentrate on staying on but all I could think about were the plugs moving inside of me. Half way across the field my pussy exploded into an orgasm. I moaned so loud I was sure that the neighbors would hear it. Colt definitely heard it. Suddenly he went from a trot to a full gallop. My crotch was getting pounded by the saddle as I bounced up and down. By the time I was able to get the key and unlock my hands we were on the other side of the property. My cunt was extremely sore and tender after receiving such a beating. My whole body was exhausted. Between trying to stay on and the multiple orgasms I was beat. With my hands free I grabbed the reins and led Colt back to the barn. Once I got to the barn and off of Colt I took his saddle off and put him back in his corral.

Chapter 2: Repeats aren&#8217;t always the same
By SG

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Several days had passed since my previous adventure and yet my loins were still moist from the lingering memories running through my mind. Fuelled by adolescent hormones an irresistible urge was growing within me to try my selfbondage scenario again. Driven by my emotions I knew I would have to alter my scenario to make this adventure even better than the first. Ever since I got off my stallion my mind has been turning, coming up with new ways to increase the thrill of the scenario. And after all of my brain storming I think I found a new twist to make things even more interesting.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yesterday I had completed my pre-setup for today&#8217;s events. The preparation involved taking three keys and hiding them across the property.&nbsp; Each key would be retrieved later in order to unlock various things. Key one was the key to the house.&nbsp; I hid this near the corner of the property next to the road that ran past the ranch and the side of the property that was owned by another rancher. The key itself was placed in the air, hung from a tree branch. With out bringing out a latter the only way to retrieve this key was while sitting on a horse. With the key hidden there I would be forced to expose myself during my adventure. Instead of hiding in the back pasture as I did before, this bondage adventure would force me out into the open and risk exposure. 
 The second key I hid was a skeleton key for the lock on the bathroom door. That key got placed on the other corner of the property that was next to the road but also next to state land. It was also hung in the air from a tree at a height unreachable from the ground but easily within reach while on a horse. The third and final key went in the mail box across the street from the driveway. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With the keys all put in their places yesterday my preparations today started with heading out to the barn to saddle up my horse. I headed out to the barn with a pair of Rough Rider condoms in my pocket as well as some lube. Once I got into the barn I went over to Colt&#8217;s stall. He was standing there ready to go. This was a horse that didn&#8217;t want to stand around all day. Taking his reins I pulled him out of the stall and walked him over to a post in the barn and tied off his reins. Conveniently located directly above was an overhead beam that I could use to mount the saddle. Once Colt was tied in place I walked over to the corner of the barn where I had previously hidden the saddle. 
Picking up the saddle I couldn&#8217;t help but admire my handy work. With saddle in hand I walked back over to Colt and saddled him up. Taking the first condom out of my pocket I pulled it out of its packaging and slowly rolled it down the first peg on the saddle. I stroked the latex covered handle admiring the soft studs that lined the condom. I reached down with my other hand and started to slowly play with my already enlarged clit. NO I told myself. I wasn&#8217;t going to get off before the ride. I pulled my hand away from my crotch then pulled out the other condom. Once it was rolled down the second plug I pulled out the lube and generously applied it to each of the condoms. With the horse saddled up I was almost done.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Going back to the house I made my final preparations. Step one was to go into the bedroom where my suit case was sitting on the bed. Inside the suitcase was all of my clothing minus what I was wearing now and the outfit I had laid on the bed. I stripped off all of my clothes and placed them into the suit case. Picking up the lock that was on the bed I looped the hasp through the zippers on the suitcase before clicking it shut. The only way to open the bag now was with the key across the street in the mail box. That left only the cloths I had laid out on the bed earlier for me to wear. 
On the bed were a white mini skirt and a white top that was nearly see-through. The top was several sizes too small for me but stretched nicely. When I wore it, the top hugged my body and showed a good portion of my midriff. The skirt was short enough that even if it was pulled down it would only hang several inches below my butt. 
Picking up the clothes from the bed along with the suitcase I headed into the bathroom. There I dropped the load I had been carrying and picked up the spare bathroom key. Closing the door to the bathroom I used the key to lock it then slid the key under the door. Now the only way to get my clothes was to go get the keys. Before I walked out the front door I grabbed the final items that I would need. They were my handcuffs, my ball gag, two clothespins and my block of ice containing a string and a hand cuff key. To make this last longer I had used a cup to freeze the water in. The larger block of ice I estimated would take about three hours to melt. With my gear in hand I headed back out to the barn making sure that the front door locked behind me on the way out. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A hint of dampness could still be felt on my bare feet as I walked across the lawn. The grass was still damp as the early morning sun continued to evaporate the dew. Just walking out to the barn was more exhilarating this time. In my hands I carried the means to my bondage as I walked across the lawn bathed in the light of the early morning&#8217;s sun. My bright red ball gag was swinging in the air for all of the world to see as I walked between the house and the barn.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Walking into the barn I could feel a familiar buzz starting to grow in my stomach as my excitement built. Standing next to Colt I knew I was ready for this. I used my left hand to lock one side of the hand cuffs around my right wrist. Holding the strap of the ball gag and the two clothespins in my teeth I used both hands to loosely tie the free end of the string, which was encased in the ice, around my neck. The block rested high on my back sending shivers down my spine from the cold kiss of ice followed by the small trickle of water running down my back, between my butt cheeks then down my inner legs. 
Untying the black stallion from the post, I laid the reins over his neck. Waiting a few seconds I made sure Colt wasn&#8217;t going to move. He stayed and with the gag and pins still held between my teeth I climbed onto him. With my left leg in the stirrup I grabbed the saddle horn and swung myself up. Once I was straddling the horse, with my body positioned just behind the plugs, I reached up and grabbed the over head beam. 
Using my upper body strength I pulled myself up till my orifices were positioned above the plugs. Ever so slowly I eased myself down. My holes stretched as the plugs slowly intruded. Once the plugs were in about two inches my toes were able to touch the stirrups and support my body weight. Reaching forward I picked up the reins off my stallion&#8217;s neck and got him moving out of the barn. Once he was in the open field and walking at a nice pace towards the far fence line I tied the reins around the saddle horn and completed my bondage. 
While holding the clips in my hand I placed the red ball gag behind my teeth and pulled the straps behind my head. Not wanting to leave any lasting marks, I only pulled the straps on the gag tight enough to hold the ball in place. Now that my lips were held silent I took a clothespin in each hand. Pinching the clothespins to open their jaws I moved them into position. The soft breeze that was coming through the valley had all ready done the job of making my nipples erect. Releasing the pressure from my fingers I let the clothespins pinch down on my nipples. Once I let go I quickly reached behind my back and closed the remaining cuff around my left wrist. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The pain on my nipples felt exquisite. It felt like they were on fire. With time the pain started to subside to a dull ache. As the pain subsided in my nips I grew aware of the pain in my calves. Still standing on tiptoes, my calves had begun to burn. To relieve my sore legs I slowly lowered my self the rest of the way down onto the plugs till they were fully in and my weight rested on the saddle. Colt lazily made his way across the field while I wiggled in the saddle. The sun felt good as it beat down on my naked body. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My black stallion was in full control of where we went. Moving from the shade of the trees to out in the middle of an open field. I was nothing more than a figure on his back along for the ride as he roamed the land at his leisure. Whether we were to stop in the middle of a field as he grazed or in the seclusion of the trees as he drank from the creek, I was left with no means of control.
Although I was bound in place on a horse with no control over where we went my level of exposure was not as high as it could have been. As Colt followed the fence line separating the back corner of the property from the front I was relieved that I had had the foresight to plan ahead for this. Part of my preparations yesterday involved closing off all the gates separating the various pastures. From the barn I had only left open the gates that would lead my horse to the fields on the secluded back corner of the property. 
Eventually we came to the end of the fence line where it terminated at the property line. The fence line we were following ended in a gate that was connected to the fence line running to the left and right. As we turned to follow the next fence I inspected my handiwork. The fence was held closed by a rope tied between the fence and the gate. The rope was at the very top of the gate putting it within reach while I was still on top of the horse.
Heading in our new direction, the back stallion chose to continue following fence lines in the hope of finding an escape. Aware of the fact that pastures are always greener in somebody else&#8217;s field, this was one horse who has always quickly escaped if any gate is left open. No real path existed near the fence line so our course left us weaving in and around bushes and clumps of trees.
It was as we rounded one patch of trees that I a sense of fear hit me as I noticed something I hadn&#8217;t seen before. Looking at the fence line it was apparent that the old posts had been pulled out and replaced with new ones. Having never walked this part of the fence I had no way to tell how long it had been since this repair work had occurred. That pang of fear went straight to my sensitive parts and I quickly turned my attention back to trying to get more attention to my stuffed holes. An even greater pang of fear hit me as we continued down the fence line. Not only were the fence poles brand new but the dirt around them was freshly disturbed. On the other side of the fence, laying on the ground, were the old posts that had been pulled out and replaced.
A large patch of brush had grown up next to the fence causing us to detour around it. Just before we rounded the brush I heard the distinct clunk, clunk, clunk of someone driving metal posts into the ground. Coming round the patch of brush I saw him and he saw me. It was the owner of the neighboring ranch. He was at a hole in the fence pounding a new post in the ground and Colt was headed right for him. 









Horse Ride
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Chapter 3: My secrets on display
By SG

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How things can change oh so quickly. Before this moment I was out enjoying an early morning naked ride across my uncle&#8217;s secluded ranch. 200 acres of trees, creeks and pastures bathed in the summer&#8217;s sun made the ranch the perfect place to explore my wildest fantasies. Living alone on the ranch I had free reign across it. There was no one around to disturb my naughty activities. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Naked on a saddled horse, riding across the land, enjoying the cool early morning summer&#8217;s breeze, that is what I had been doing up until this point. My horse, Colt, had followed a trail along the fence line and stopped right next to a man. Repairing a hole in the fence was the owner of the adjoining ranch. I could feel my entire body turn beet red to the point my skin probably matched the red of the gag in my mouth. Kicking Colt in the sides, I tried to guide him away from the man but the stubborn horse just wouldn&#8217;t budge from his path. Colt walked up right up in front of the man and just stopped. With heels dug into the horse&#8217;s sides I desperately tried to spur the horse onwards but the animal refused to acknowledge me. Panic swept over me. I desperately pulled at my cuffs but they held my wrists tight. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was on display for the man fully mounted. His face was a mixture of shock and admiration. Shock from seeing a girl bound on a horse like I was. Admiration because he was looking at the well tanned athletic body of a nineteen year old. Had there not been a gag silencing my mouth, there still would be no sounds uttered. The terror filling my mind from being discovered overwhelmed any abilities I might have had to speak. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well now. Here&#8217;s something you defiantly don&#8217;t come across every day,� he said in a slightly dazed voice. �Did you do this to yourself?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Without question, the next step on the list of all things humiliating, following actually being discovered tied up, would have to be being forced to admit that it was self inflicted. A pit existed where my stomach once was. It completely dwarfed any butterflies that had filled it at the start of this ride. A corner of my mind was suddenly filled with the hope and desire that this stranger might take me away and use me for his and my own pleasure. But on the whole, fear was over riding my desires and guiding my thinking. 
People in the real world don&#8217;t play with and pleasure the girl they find in bondage. In the real world when a person discovers someone in bondage they call the police to report that person was raped or else is a pervert. Being found in bondage like this was more likely to result in a night in prison for indecent exposure and bestiality than it was to result in a day of fun and pleasure. Of course maybe prison wouldn&#8217;t be so bad. There is always the flip side to the human mind, the pleasure that can be derived from the embarrassment of being discovered and arrested. The erotic act of getting locked up in a cell for being so naughty� but that was something I didn&#8217;t even want to dwell on at the moment. Being whisked away by the police was just too much to handle thinking about.
He gave me a long hard look up and down while he circled around, taking in the full view. �Well I&#8217;m not entirely sure what I should do with you.� The look on his face showed that the gears were rapidly turning in his mind but to what end I had no idea. �What do you say we start with taking you home?� The question came more as a statement, I had very little to say in what we did. Scratch that, with the gag securely in place, I had absolutely no say in what happened. I really didn&#8217;t want to argue though. I was quite happy he said he wanted to take me home. Of all the things that could have just happened, it came as a great relief to hear he was going to take me back to the house. 
With the proposal made he went about untying the reins from the saddle horn. Stepping in front of the horse, the man used the reins to lead Colt away with me along for the ride. In stunned silence I took in the events unfolding around me. The man was not leading my horse back the way we had come from. Instead he was taking us through the gap in the fence and off of my uncle&#8217;s property. My mind was a mixture of fear, embarrassment and a certain level of arousal that didn&#8217;t seem to go away. The excitement of this adventure was supposed to come from taking a chance that someone might see me, serious emphasis on might. Now I had been not only discovered but was also under the complete control of a stranger. A stranger who was taking me away from the safety of my family&#8217;s property and off to some unknown location.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mounted on my trusty steed, I was led naked across his property. Eventually the trail we were following brought us to his house and barn. My fear grew a hundred fold as I was led up in front of the barn doors. The heavy metallic clack as the lock was opened on the doors was followed by a piercing shriek as the hinges alerted everyone in the area to their movement as the man slowly opened the doors. 
A chill ran through me as the darkness of the barn washed over me. With a slow pace I was marched into the depths of the barn till we came to stop at its very center. After tying the reins around a post in the middle of the barn the man walked away. He returned with a step stool which he place next to colt. Using the stool to stand on he was able to elevate himself to my height. I sucked in my breath and closed my eyes as his hands reached out to me but instead of feeling fingers on my nipples I felt him touch me in an entirely different location. With a plopping noise the gag came out of my mouth. Opening my eyes I saw the drool covered gag swinging in his hand. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Now that your mouth is free of this gag we can talk. Who are you and what do you think you are doing on Allen&#8217;s place with one of his horses?� he asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m Brea, Allen&#8217;s niece. He&#8217;s letting me stay at the ranch and take care of it for the summer.� Please lord let him believe me. If he calls my uncle to confirm any of this I will be dead in so many different ways.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Ok, that answers part of my question,� he replied.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From the stern look on his face I knew he wasn&#8217;t going to be willing to walk away with anything short of the full, in detail story. Do you remember the days as a child where you did something wrong then had to fess up to it to your parents? As you tell the story your lips actually quiver from the fear. I think as an adult it is even worse. Maybe it was just the magnitude of what I was admitting to but either way, by the time I was done telling him my story my whole body was quivering. He took great interest in the fact that I had hid the keys out and around the property in places where to retrieve them I would be forced to expose myself. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had a bit of a perplexed look on his face when I told him the truly perverted aspect of riding this saddle. The perplexed look was followed by a slight chuckle and a shake of the head that I just couldn&#8217;t read. To ride a horse with a saddle that had a plug penetrating my pussy should be enough to occupy the gossip of an entire town. Here in the bible belt of the country the attention my cunt was receiving would only be mentioned as a side thought. All the gossip of the town, probably the county, would be fully devoted to the sodomization I was subjecting myself to.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A silence fell across the land as I finished telling my story. He just put his head down lost in thought. When he had finished thinking things over he pulled out a pocketknife and looked me straight in the eye. I shut my eyes as he reached for my throat. My breathing stopped as his rough hands touched my neck.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then the hands were gone. As my brain finally snapped back into gear I realized that the string around my neck and the ice block hanging from it had been removed. Opening my eyelids just enough to peak through I saw the man walking away with the string, ice and key in hand. I opened my eyes all the way to watch him disappear out of the barn. I heard a house door shut as he went inside then heard it again a short time later as he exited the house. Reappearing in the doorway to the barn, I was a little surprise to see him walk over to the quad instead of coming over to me.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;ll be back in a while. I&#8217;d tell you not to wander off but that would just be too much of a pun,� he said as he got on the four-wheeler. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Starting up the ATV he drove off leaving me naked, mounted on a horse. Colt was still tied to the post and my hands were still locked behind my back. With the keys to the handcuffs now confiscated there was no hope of gaining freedom. I was left to wait here till the man returned. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was all alone, left to wonder what my new fate might entail. There was no way of knowing if he had left to go get the authorities or to round up some cowboys who wanted to take turns riding a cowgirl. He had left to go do something and I doubt it was to go run errands. Even tied up in the barn I knew that I was still at risk of further discovery. There was still the likely possibility that someone else might stop by this ranch. Farmers are always stopping by their neighbors to borrow stuff. And there is always the possibility that this guy has other farm hands that might be showing up to work. What are they going to think if they find me mounted on a horse left in the middle of the barn, with hands cuffed behind my back.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was quite happy when the ranched did return and without anyone else in tow. Yet as he parked his quad back in its place I grew increasingly more hesitant. The man I had just met went to run a mysterious errand immediately following his discovery of a naked girl on a horse. What kind of errands do most guys run after finding a girl in bondage? He could have posted a sign in town advertising his find or gone to borrow a video camera from a neighbor. I was freaking out thinking about all the possibilities. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Climbing off the ATV, the man turned and walked out of the barn. A naked girl was tied up in his barn and yet he barely acknowledged me. The sole glance he made at me was held just long enough to ensure I hadn&#8217;t moved. No time was taken to admire the curves on the bound body before him. His mind was focused on a task making his concentration unbreakable. Immediately after he had disappeared from sight the sound of a truck door closing could be heard, quickly followed by the sound of an engine coming to life. The sound of a truck departing down the road filled my ears.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Locked away in the cool shade of the barn, a chill was starting to run across my skin. The fear of being caught and bound up in a barn was only adding to the strength of those chills. After what felt like an eternity the sound of a truck returning could be heard. Once again I was ignored. Instead of coming to see me, my captor chose to go into his house. An hour must have pasted before he finally returned to me.
There was no camera or knife in his hand so a small wave of relief came over me. He stood before me, head cocked to the side and a smile on his face. Scratching his chin in deep thought, he just stood there in front of me with that goofy grin on his face. Try as I might, I couldn&#8217;t figure out what on earth was going through his mind.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He broke the silence, not with a word but an action. Stepping up on the stool, he pulled my gag out of his back pocked to present to me. Before I had a chance to get a good look at the alterations he had made the ball was pushed against my lips. Having no real means of resisting I gave in without fight and opened my mouth. My teeth were forced apart as the man pushed the red ball gag into my mouth. The leather straps of the gag were pulled around my head to be re-buckled. At first he was soft and gentle as he applied the gag but that quickly passed as the straps were pulled tighter and tighter. 
My jaw was stretched even further open as the ball was forced deeper into my mouth. The tightening didn&#8217;t stop until the man had managed to pull the straps several notches tighter than I had had them previously. With the straps buckled this tight I was guaranteed to be left with marks across my cheeks and mouth. A startled moment of surprise struck me as the distinct sound of a lock snapping shut was heard. A quick tug on the back of my head to ensure the lock was secured told me that the man had changed out the gag&#8217;s buckle in order to make it lockable. The realization that I was now silenced until he chose to unlock the gag sent a wave of apprehension coursing through me.&nbsp; 
Stepping down off the stool he walked away and disappeared from the barn. When he did return it was with the ice block and key in one hand and more noticeably six large party balloons in the other. The balloons were bright red and yellow. They strained at their strings as the helium inside of them caused them to rise. It was when he set the key and ice block down on the ground that I noticed the major alteration that he had made to my escape method. 
The bock of ice that I had started with was now several times larger than when I had first created it. In the same manner that the ice in a glass of water will fuse together, he had added numerous ice cubes to my original block of ice. Now my ice release was a conglomeration of numerous ice cubes making it significantly larger than before.
Leaving the key and ice behind, he continued to approach me with balloons in hand. Once he was standing on the stool he pulled out a small spool of tape from his pocket. I observed as he taped the ends of the strings tied to the balloons to the clothespins pinching my nipples. Each clothespin received three balloons. The upward force of the balloons was just enough to lift up on the clothespins but not enough to pull on my tits.
With the balloons in place he pulled out a small envelope from his pocket. Using the tape he secured the envelope to the front part of the saddle just below the saddle horn. Staring down I read the words written across the envelope. They said in big letters, �The Kinkster&#8217;s Scavenger Hunt, Clue 1�. Some how he was planning to turn my predicament into some sort of game. Fear overwhelmed me realizing that this scavenger hunt might not start at clue one. Given the length of time he was gone, the scavenger hunt might start at a higher number and give clues to this envelope. Any number of people could already be out scavenging, looking for the clue that is going to lead them to the final clue and grand prize, a bound girl decorated with balloons.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Making no haste, he stepped off the stool to retrieve the ice and key on the string. Returning with my last item, he quickly got back on the stool and tied the string to the lock that secured the gag. The cold block of ice was once again resting on my back dripping down my spine. I prayed that he was going to give me a fighting chance in this scavenger hunt and leave me enough time to free myself before anyone had a chance to find me. As that thought crossed my mind a new one took its place. I was even more vulnerable than I first realized. Having told him where my keys were, he could have easily set up clues that would lead people to my keys. In that event all they would have to do is sit and wait for me to come to them.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I watched in a stunned daze as he went about carrying out his plans. Now he was untying the reins from the post and leading me out of the barn. The hot noon&#8217;s day sun beat down on my skin as we cleared the shadow of the barn. We left the barn area and returned to the same path we had come in on. A gentle breeze swept across me. The breeze was soft enough it would have gone unnoticed had it not been for the balloons. Caught in the draft the balloons strained against their tethers as the breeze tried to whisk them away. The gentle pull on my nipples kept me keenly aware of even the slightest breeze.
 As far as I could tell he was freeing me but I just didn&#8217;t believe it. A nagging uneasiness still hung over me. It just didn&#8217;t make sense that he would let me go free and clear, not with the way he was grinning at me before. Something was definitely up and I was about to find out what. 
From the trail we were taking it appeared that he was going to take me back to the fence line where we had first met but I also realized he might just be moving me from one barn to the next. I wondered if he was trying to separate himself from the scavenger hunt by moving me back into my uncle&#8217;s barn. It would have been just as easy for him to post the scavenger hunt all over town with the final clues leading people back to my uncle&#8217;s barn instead of his own. Separating himself from me would give him complete deniability. As far as anyone would know, I would just be a horny girl who had left clues across town to lure people to the barn to find and do as they wished with me. It wasn&#8217;t until we had returned to the fence line that he finally spoke to me.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;ve had a long interest in bondage so I know all about what you&#8217;re doing. Although I personally am no where near the risk taker you are, I do know about the immense thrill exhibitionist get from exposing themselves like you are,� he said as he gently patted my thigh. �After hearing you describe your scenario and based on what I know from experiences with girls like yourself, I decided it would be ok if I took a few liberties with your bondage plans and the keys to your release,� he paused as he led my horse through the fence line and turned to head back the way I had originally come from. 
�Given the amount of effort you put out to come up with an inescapable bondage scenario that was as pleasure filled,� he said as he gave the saddle a shake, �as it is exposing,� he paused to run a finger down my leg. �It is pretty obvious that you enjoy the excitement that comes from exposing yourself just as much as those two plugs that you described in such vivid detail back in the barn that are currently stuffing both those young holes of yours.�
The rancher kept leading my horse further and further down the fence line. Ignoring all the trails and fields which would lead us back to the barn, he instead chose to continue following along the fence line. I was stunned by the sudden surprise that greeted me as we rounded a tall patch of bushes. The fence gate leading to the front pasture was wide open. In my preparations earlier this morning I had closed all the gates leading to the front pastures. Using rope tied between the top bar of the gate and the fence post I had shut the gates knowing I could untie the rope later while I was still on a horse. 
Instead of having the gate tied shut it was held wide open with the same rope I had used to close it. With the gate open Colt would be free to roam the front pasture along side the road. Leading us through the gate the rancher continued on only stopping after we had reached a narrow field that stretched all the way out to the road side fence line. From there, the field turned to the side and opened up as it ran along the road.
Retying the reins around the saddle horn the rancher prepared to release control of the horse. Once the reins were retied he started to walk back the way we had just come from. My eyes were fixed on the fence line in the distance. When I heard him pause after taking only a couple steps I twisted in the saddle to turn and look at him.
He looked me in the eye then shifted his gaze to look down the field. I turned my head to look at the fence then turned it back. Our eyes met and a mischievous grin spread across his face as he spoke to me.
�Consider this my big favor to you. Since good neighbors do favors for other neighbors, and I&#8217;m a good neighbor, I am doing this as a favor to you,� looking down the field to the fence line he made a dramatic pause before he added, �actually; this could probably be considered a favor to everyone. I guess that just makes me a really good neighbor. Don&#8217;t worry about repaying me now; I just want you concentrating on the here and now. If you are still confused let me explain. You told me all about your little selfbondage experiment you are trying here and I&#8217;m now helping you do the things you didn&#8217;t have the courage to try�� he stopped. His face changed as though he was considering something he hadn&#8217;t thought of before. �Then again, this could be the sort of stuff you were smart enough to not go through with.� Shrugging his shoulders his smile returned. �Either way, have fun.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With a loud yea, and a hard slap to the hind end the rancher sent my black stallion at a full gallop across the field with me bouncing along for the ride. Squeezing my legs tightly around Colt I desperately tried to stabilize myself but nothing could stop me from bouncing up and down. With every bounce I got a deep double fucking as I rode up and down on the rods in my pussy and ass. We were flying across the field at breakneck speed. At a racing pace we were headed towards the road side fence line.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I could feel the raised studs on the condoms in both my holes which were now in an extremely heightened level of sensitivity. Most noticeable I could feel the studs rubbing against my clit. Every bounce also brought a tug to each nipple as the clothespins bounced around, jostled by the balloons bouncing through the air. The emotional high I was on plus the physical treatment I was being subjected to combined to leave me screaming into my gag. My whole body shook as a powerful orgasm rocked me to the core.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My pussy clenched down on the rod inside me and went into spasms as I continued to get pounded by the rod. Even my ass puckered up and had spasms from the rod that continued to fuck it. The orgasm crashed through the rest of my body in waves. Even with the gag, even with the distance Colt had put between us and the rancher, I still know my moans were loud enough for the rancher to hear.
