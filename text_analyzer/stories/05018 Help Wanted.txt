I was getting older, 49 to be
exact.� And though I could pass for
younger, Hollywood for the most
part was a young person�s game, and I was getting a little too old for the
demand for the young, cute and cuddly.�
Let�s face it, I was a dinosaur, and in the age of �reality� television
when episodic drama had all but disappeared, I was definitely expendable.� I had
worked in the business for a decade plus six, and while I wasn�t A-list, I had
been a decent writer and able to provide a reasonable living.� While it was nothing outstanding, I had been
able to secure a fine home, nice cars, vacations and
the other niceties of a successful career. Circumstances change�sometimes
drastically.� My second wife now lived in
the house and drove the Mercedes I had purchased for her birthday while I made
do in a dingy one-bedroom apartment with my son from my first marriage. I had
survived in a tough business and had enjoyed the perks and freedoms of being a
writer.� Only now, that career choice
wasn�t too rosy.

����������� My
divorce had put a major crimp in the financial situation and I had been out of
work for almost two years.� With my
savings depleted by the divorce settlement, business was never a strong suit,
that, and the brutal shark of a lawyer my wife had hired, I was now on the
brink of homelessness.� With bills piling
on my desk, I needed employment in a hurry.�
Let�s face it, I was desperate which led to a
desperate decision that put me where I am today.

My ex and I had
been friends with a younger couple for 14 years since our kids met at school�my
son, now 20�was a couple of years older than their fraternal twins, a boy and a
girl--and when I was offered a job working for them, I said yes despite my
hesitancy and embarrassment of accepting employment from what had been
friends.� It was a humbling experience
when I was out playing golf with Jeff and he said that maybe something could be
worked out.� At the time I detected an
attitude of slight smugness, but Jeff always had that air about him.� He was intelligent, well-educated and while
friendly and cordial, I always got the sense that he felt himself somewhat
superior to me though it was so subtle that I always checked it off to my own insecurity.� Yeah, I might be able to beat him on the golf
course, but I�m sure he felt that in the game of life he was ahead.

����������� He
was a businessman with his own consulting business and few other side
projects.� I wasn�t sure of his income,
but it was well into the six figures, the forty-one-year-old Jeff was doing
quite well.� Also, he and his wife, Ann,
came from fairly well-to-do families.�
Married while in college and having kids early, they were exceedingly
mature for their age when I first met them during the Kindergarten year of
school when my son was in the second grade.�
They were comfortable, and while far from being ostentatious, they drove
BMWs and owned a large home in a new subdivision, and pretty much did whatever
they pleased, money never seeming to be an issue.� I can�t say I was ever jealous or envious of
their financial comfort; at least I wasn�t until the work dried up and I found
myself struggling to make rent on the dreary apartment that was home.� After the divorce, my wife and I had both
remained friends with the couple, though my relationship was much cooler than
the one my wife maintained with them, particularly Ann, who remained a close
friend to my ex.

I wasn�t qualified
for most employment, a self-made writer, I had only
made it through a year and a half of college.�
I had come to Hollywood with
a briefcase full of scripts and was one of the lucky ones to actually find
work.� Without any training or education
and being on the old side, the work world wasn�t exactly clamoring for my
services.� I was close to taking a supermarket
job or something similar, maybe an assistant at a food-fast food place when
Jeff said I could come and work for he and his wife.� When not involved with their children, his
wife assisted with some of the businesses and supervised the maintenance of their
household.� I�m sure my ex gleefully
filled them in on my financial straits, so I wasn�t entirely surprised that
they said they could use my help.� I WAS
somewhat surprised I said yes, I guess the thought of looking for a menial job
would be more humiliating than going to work for my smug friends.

His wife, Ann, was
very attractive, definitely didn�t look her age of thirty-nine.� Tall and almost too thin, her shoulder-length
light brown hair framed a pretty face that might have been a tad long, but nonetheless
she was looker.� Of course, her smile was
perfect, teeth white and straight and she had intense green eyes that flashed
with impatience when things didn�t go exactly they way she sought.� She was a perfectionist and subtly
demanding.� I knew that working for her
wouldn�t be easy, that it would be unlikely anything would be complete
satisfactory for her judging from the way she would nitpick and complain about
every little thing in her life.

Jeff wasn�t much
better.� He was immaculate in appearance and
manner.�� And he had the same
perfectionist manner of his wife.� More
than once I could over hear him on his cell phone upbraiding an employee to do
their job right.� He wasn�t a screamer,
but he knew what he wanted and how he wanted things done and accomplished.� So there it was, I had say yes and found
myself one morning ringing the bell to their house, standing at the door,
questioning how I got myself into such a situation.

We hadn�t
discussed the details of my employment, only that my salary would be
five-hundred a week, a far cry from the thirty-grand I used to get for each
television script for which I received credit.�
Jeff had said he was sure they would be able to find something for me to
do, joking even if it was only cleaning their house, but that he and Ann always
had a need for another hard working person in their life.� He said that they could use a
secretary�administrative assistant he quickly corrected himself,
that they could trust and depend on.�
He did iterate that he and Ann could be demanding and I said I knew this
well, and that I was eager and willing to work hard to please them.

The part-time maid
answered the door and said that Mrs. Moore was expecting me in the office.� I walked back to the office, which was
located in the rear of the house, a house that was decorated with great style
and taste even if it leaned a little to the �shabby chic� generic.� It felt odd to be in the home when it wasn�t
a party, play date or social visit.� I
was anxious and still feeling slightly embarrassed that I had reached the
situation for a mercy hiring by my friends.�
The door to the office was partially opened and I walked in with
butterflies roiling in my stomach.� Ann was
sitting at the desk, typing on the computer keyboard.

�Good
morning.�� I tried to sound cheery and
eager to be there, though I had a certain dread running through me.

Ann didn�t look up
from the computer screen.� �You�re late.�

Thankfully Ann
couldn�t see me flush red from her comment.�
Yes, I was late, but only by five minutes and I was struck by the
coolness in her voice and that I was starting from a negative as it was evident
that she was displeased by my slight tardiness.�
�Uh, I guess, I�m a couple of minutes late.�

�No, five minutes,
Mike.� I know with your Hollywood
job things were a little more casual and that you know us socially and so
forth.� But this is now a workplace and I
expect you to be professional and prompt.�

Anger started to
swell up within me and I almost turned and walked out as I felt I didn�t
deserve to be treated quite so abruptly, but I didn�t want to fail on the first
day and give Ann and Jeff any satisfaction that their standards were higher
than mine and I would be unable to meet them.�
Plus, I really could use the money.�
�Uh, okay, Ann, I�m sorry, I will be on time from now on.�

�Good.� Your fine will be five dollars.�

�My
what?�� I couldn�t believe she had
the audacity to suggest a fine, particularly with the measly five-hundred I was
earning.

�Mr. Moore and I
will assess fines as we see fit.� Keep you
motivated and from slacking off.�

�You�re
kidding�right?�

Ann was not happy
with my protest.� �Look, Mike, these are
our rules.� If you can�t abide by them,
then get out.�

Damn, I knew she
could be tough, but this was a whole different side to Ann.� Again, I thought about leaving, but figured
the fine thing was simply a ploy to get my attention and wouldn�t be much of an
issue.� �No, no, I don�t want to
leave.� It just seems a little
unfair.� Particularly since I didn�t know
about the rule.�
����������� �Well you know what they say
about law.� Ignorance is no excuse.�

�Whatever
you say, Ann.�

�Also, Mike, when
you are in a work situation, you need to address me as Mrs. Moore and Jeff as
Mr. Moore.� Do you have a problem with
that?�

Wow, this was
going to be harder than I thought.� Here
was this woman, someone I had thought of as a good friend, someone ten years my
junior, instructing me on how to address her.�
�No problem, Mrs. Moore, you�re the boss.�

I could see a hint
of a smile on her face.� �Yes, I am your
boss now, Mike.� Please don�t let our
history cloud our understanding of the current situation.�

�No, Mrs. Moore, I
won�t.�

�Good.�� Ann looked up at me, her stern green eyes
intensely scrutinizing me.

She looked
great.� Wearing a skirt and blouse,
barefoot, her toes, as always, perfectly manicured, this time in pink with a
flower painted on each big toe.� I was
glad, that if nothing else, I would get to be with her even if I was now in her
employ.� I stood there for a couple of
minutes feeling awkward as I didn�t know what I was supposed to do and I didn�t
want to interrupt her.� Finally, I said,
�What would you like me to do?�

I could see the
familiar wrinkle of irritation cross Ann�s face as she raised her right hand as
to stop me from talking.� �I�ll let you know
as soon as I�m finished.�� 

Again, I thought
she was being unfairly abrupt.� She
certainly wasn�t making this easy for me.�
She worked for a few more minutes, before sitting back and looking at
the computer screen as if she was scrutinizing her work. �But I got the sense she was making me stand
there simply because she knew she could.

Maria the maid
popped into the room.� �Ann, what would
you like me to do with these papers on the coffee table?�

Ann looked up and
warmly smiled at the maid.� �Just leave
them on the kitchen table, I�ll go through it later.�

�Don�t forget that
I have to leave early today.�

�I haven�t.� Mike will drive you home after lunch.� You know Mike right?�� Ann said, introducing me to Maria.

I said hello and
nodded at Maria who glared back while saying, �Yes, I�ve seen him before.�

�He works for me
and Mr. Moore now.� And he will be
helping you too.�

Maria brightened
at this comment.� �Very
good.� I always could use
help.� Much to do
around here.� I go back to work
now.�

Maria left.� Ann had been so much more friendly and warm
with her maid, so much for the workplace formality she had just expressed to
me.� �Let�s see, where was I?� Ann was
looking at the computer once again.� She
then swiveled her chair towards me, bare legs crossed, girlishly bouncing one
foot as she looked at me.� �What shall I
have you do?�� She had a smile on her
face as if she was enjoying the fact that I was now her employee.� �This is a little odd, isn�t it, you working
for us?�

�Yes kind of��
����������� �I�ll have to admit though, I
kind of like it.� And I�m sure Joann is
going to flip when I tell her you�re working for us.�
����������� Joann was my ex.� I hadn�t really given it much thought of her
knowing about it since I had been more concerned about getting some cash.� I wanted to ask Ann why she liked it, but
decided not to press the subject.�� I had
been there twenty minutes, just standing and watching her work as I felt like a
fool.� There was a chair on the other
side of where Ann sat, but she hadn�t offered it to me and had made no effort
to allow access to it.� So I had stood
while she worked.� I thought it ironic
that she had upbraided me for my five-minute tardiness, yet I hadn�t done a
thing.� Typical boss
kind of thing.� Finally, I
couldn�t take the idleness anymore.� �What
can I do for you?�

�Mrs. Moore.� Please don�t forget the proper manner of
respect.�

�What would you
like me to do, Mrs. Moore?� I repeated resenting having to address her that
way.

�Right now, you
may clean my car.� Vacuum, dust, wash it.� You know
where I keep my keys.� The supplies are
in the laundry room.� If you need any
help finding things, ask Maria.�

�Yes, Mrs. Moore,�
I said, knowing that the keys were on a hook in the kitchen, everything in the
house having its proper place.

�Good.� You�re dismissed.�

Dismissed?� I felt like a servant and almost let out a
sarcastic, yes oh great Mrs. Moore, but I said nothing.� I gathered the supplies and went into the
garage where the SUV was parked.� I
passed a large closet full of shoes, as the Moore�s
had a rule of no shoe wearing inside the house except for guests who didn�t
wish to remove their shoes or the exception of Maria who wore her thick sole
nurse type shoes when she was working.�
Having a foot and shoe fetish I imagined what it must be like to have to
clean and polish Ann�s shoes and wondered if that would ever become one of my
duties, though it would be humiliating to actually have to clean the shoes of
someone who had been my equal and that I had known so long as a friend, nothing
in the least kinky or sexual.

But interrupting
my brief shoe reverie was the need to clean Ann�s ride and I got to work for
the next hour and a half cleaning her new X5 trying my best to get it as
sparkling as possible knowing Ann�s fastidiousness.� When I went back into the house around
eleven, I found Ann sitting on the plush sectional sofa in the entertainment
room and talking on the phone while Maria was sweeping the kitchen that
connected to the area where Ann sat.� She
was laughing about something when I began to sit on the sofa across from
her.� Phone to ear, looking up at me she
shook her head no indicating that I wasn�t to sit down on the sofa.� What was this?� Now I wasn�t good enough to sit on her
precious furniture?

�Just
a sec.�� She put the phone to her
shoulder and said while pointing towards the kitchen, �Go make Maria and me
turkey sandwiches and cut up some fresh fruit.�

�Yes, Mrs. Moore,�
I said, quietly seething to myself.

�Did you bring
lunch with you?�

�No, Mrs.
Moore.�� I didn�t even think of bringing
lunch.� Ann had always been generous in
offering food or snacks during previous visits.�
I had no reason to think otherwise.

She kind of shook
her head and said, �That�s too bad.� I
don�t want you eating any of the turkey in case the kids want something later.� Maybe after they have had their snacks, you
can have a banana or something.� From now
on, you�ll be expected to provide your own food.�

I didn�t know what
to say.� I was dumbfounded with her
attitude, so I simply said, �Yes, Mrs. Moore,�
like a robotic idiot.

�Good.� I�m glad you understand.� Now go!�

I didn�t
understand.� Why was she treating me this
way?� Why did Maria get to eat her food
but not me?� And as I pulled the turkey
out of the refrigerator to make lunch and seeing that there was enough meat to
feed the neighborhood, I realized that there was something more going on than
simply having enough food for after-school munchies.� I could her hear continue the phone
conversation and I realized she was talking with Jeff.

�He�s doing all
right.� It will be an adjustment for all
of us.� Of course, he started out on the
wrong foot by being late�Yes, I fined him.��
There was a second of silence followed by much laughter from Ann.� �Yes, maybe we�ll have to do that.� He�ll learn or else.� All right, I�ll see you later, darling.� Love you.��
Ann put down the phone after hanging up.�
�Is that lunch ready?�

I was hurrying to
put her turkey sandwich together.� I had
eaten enough at Ann�s house to know how she liked her sandwich prepared.� �Getting there, should be a few more
minutes.�

�You need to work
fast, Mike, I don�t like to be kept waiting for anything.�

�Yes, Mrs. Moore,
I�m aware of that.� I�m working as
quickly as I can.�

�That�s a good
attitude, Mike.� I know I can be
demanding, impatient, even unfair.� But
that�s just me.� You�ll have to deal with
it.�

�Yes, Mrs. Moore,
I understand.�� I quickly finished the
sandwiches and cut up the fresh fruit and put them on plates as Ann thumbed
through a magazine.� �Your lunch is
ready, Mrs. Moore.�

�That�s so cute
the way you say Mrs. Moore, Mike.� Do you
hate addressing me that way?�� Ann said
standing and walking the few short steps to the kitchen.� �Maria that�s good,� she said to the maid who
was puttering around the kitchen.

�No, if that�s
what you wish, I have no problem.�
����������� �Good, Mike, you are more
agreeable than I thought you would be.�
You must have really needed this job.�

�Yes, I did��

Ann was circling
her hand for me to finish my sentence.�
�Don�t forget your manners.�

�Yes I did, Mrs.
Moore.�
����������� �And?�

Maria had taken a
seat at the table and Ann was standing at an end chair waiting for me to
realize that I was to pull out the chair for her to seat down.� And?� I
wasn�t sure what she meant by that.� �And what? Mrs. Moore?�

The question
displeased Ann who snapped as she sat down.�
�A thank you.�

�Oh�thank you,
Mrs. Moore for the job.�� I could see
Maria smirking and trying not to laugh as she enjoyed Ann�s difficult treatment
of me.

�That�s
better.�� I placed the plates before Ann
and Maria and began to clean up the kitchen.�
Fixing the food had made me hungry, but I wasn�t about to venture into
that territory, Ann had made it clear that her food was not available for me.

�Mike.� Do you think that Maria and I are some kind
of philistines?� Where are our napkins?�

Messed
up again.� �Sorry, Mrs. Moore,� I
said, scurrying over to the table with two cloth napkins that I pulled out of a
linen drawer.

�Apologize to
Maria also.�

Ann smoothed the
napkin into her lap as I handed the other napkin to Maria with my apology.� This was a little weird, but I was going to
go long with Ann�s little game.� �Sorry, Maria.�� I
turned to go back to cleaning.

�No wait.� I think you should address her as Mrs.
Lopez.� Show her a little respect.� After all, you ARE the probationary employee
around here.� And since you will be
helping her with the household duties, she is going to be your boss too.�

This was getting
to be too much.� The maid was my
boss?� I flashed back to when I was
working in television, the eager assistants hoping to break into the business
getting us lunch, doing our errands.� I
had sunk a long ways, but it could be worse, and I wasn�t eager to explore the
job world any longer.� Besides, there was
a little bit of me that enjoyed the new attitude displayed by Ann.� �Sorry, Mrs. Lopez.�

Maria giggled a
little and said, �That�s okay.�

Maria and Ann
discussed Maria�s trip back to Central America while I
finished cleaning up the kitchen.� Ann
telling Maria that she would have to train me on the ways of the
household.� Even though the details of
what I was going to be doing was rather vague when I agreed to work for the Moores, I didn�t really expect to be doing so much cleaning
and such, but that�s what looked like would be needed, so that was what I was
going to be doing.

After Ann quickly
finished her lunch, she said she was going out to inspect the X5 and quickly
disappeared.� Maria wasted no time
asserting her status.� �Next
time, no tomato on mine.�

�Yes, Mrs. Lopez,�
I said, looking at her, trying to maintain my cool.

�Good.� Clean up these plates.�

I couldn�t believe
she was ordering me to do this like she owned the place.� �What the���
Before I could go any further, Ann had already returned.

�Mike, are you
sure you cleaned my car?�� Her voice was
full of disgust and she noticed the tomato slices that Maria had left on her
plate, one of them with an obvious bite taken out of it.� �You don�t like tomato, Maria?�

�No, Ann, it make
my stomach hurt.� I told him not again.�

�Good.� I�m sure he won�t.� I hate to see any food wasted.� You eat it, Mike.� You said you didn�t bring anything with you.�

�Yeah, but a
tomato��� I could see that the already
agitated Ann didn�t want to hear my protest.�
��will be very good.� We all know about the starving kids who would
love a tomato,� I weakly joked.� I took
Maria�s leftovers and ate the two tomato slices.� They weren�t that bad and I tried not to
think about the one that had a gap from Maria�s bite.� Anyway, I had worse things on the horizon.

�I want to show
you what you missed on the car.� Follow
me.�� We went into the garage where Ann
slipped on a pair of older sandals and I put on my sneakers, then I trailed
after Ann to the driveway where I had left it for her inspection.� She proceeded to show me a small streak here
and there that a quick wipe erased.� And
then she showed me a couple of pieces of grass on the carpet and a minuscule
amount of sand left in a cup holder and some other dirt far underneath the
seats.� �Do it right, then take Maria
home.�� Ann turned and quickly walked back
into the house.� I furiously cleaned the
spots she pointed out then returned to the house where Maria and Ann were
already saying goodbye.

�I�ll see you at
nine, Maria,� Ann said, giving her maid a hug.�
�Make sure you open the door for her, Mike,� Ann instructed, enjoying
her little power trip.� �Before you come
back, you need to go to the store.� Here
is a list of things I need.�� Ann handed
me a grocery list and a hundred dollar bill.�
�Hurry up, you�ve got a lot of work to do
around here.�

I escorted Maria
out to my old beater of a Camry and opened the passenger door for her.� �Sorry about the mess, Mrs. Lopez,� I said as
the older woman slid into the seat.�
Maria must have been in her late forties, plump and somewhat
matronly.� She wore glasses and her teeth
were somewhat crooked.� She favored print
dresses that she probably picked up at garage sales, and always wore pantyhose
and those ugly back nursing shoes with the thick soles.� She directed me to her house, nothing else
being said except this way or that.� When
we pulled up to the small place on a busy street, she waited for me to get out
of the car and open the door for her.� �I
guess I�ll see you tomorrow,� I said trying to be friendly.

�Yes, you have
much to learn.�� Maria walked up the
cracked cement sidewalk to her home as a teenage girl came out the door to
greet her mother and eyed me suspiciously.

I drove to the
grocery store and tore up and down the aisles as fast as I could.� I knew it wouldn�t be fast enough for Ann,
especially after she called me twice on my cell phone adding items that she had
forgotten to list.� Never mind that they
were at the other end of the store.� I
returned to the house and carried the groceries into the kitchen.� Ann emerged from her office and started
looking through the bags of groceries to assess my purchases.

�Store must have
been busy,� she said, inspecting the romaine lettuce I had purchased.

�Yes, Mrs. Moore,
I went as quickly as possible.�

�I�m sure you
did.� These grapes taste like crap.�� She had eaten a test grape then took the rest
and threw them into the garbage can.�
�Don�t you know how to pick out fruit?�

�I thought so,
Mrs. Moore.� It�s hard to tell with
grapes.�

�How much were
they?�

I scanned the
register receipt.� �Three
ninety eight.�

�Did you get the
little spiral notebook?�

�Yes, Mrs. Moore.�� I was getting nervous and off balance finding
myself disappointed that I had let Ann down.

�All
right.� Add the three ninety-eight
to this morning�s five dollar fine.�
That�s part of your job to keep track of the penalties you are
assessed.�

I was going to
have to pay for the grapes she didn�t want?

�And while you are
at it.� Fifty cents for the tomatoes
wasted on Maria�s sandwich.�
����������� I tried to protest.� �But the tomatoes didn�t go to waste��
����������� �Quiet.� I don�t want any arguing.� If you are going to do that, then leave.� Now!�

I should have
left, but I couldn�t.� Jeff had promised
to pay me that evening my first week�s salary and I needed the money.� �No, Mrs. Moore, I won�t argue.�

�These bananas are
a little green, but we�ll keep them��

And
on through the grocery sacks, many things earning a criticism.� By the time she was finished, I had been
fined again, this time five fifty eight
for purchasing the wrong deodorant for her.�
She told me I could either take it back and get a refund or use it
myself, but that she expected me to purchase the correct one before I returned
in the morning.� It was a brand geared
for women, so I didn�t want to use it.�
And I needed it to exchange it for the correct kind (though I was sure I
bought the correct one in the first place) so I wouldn�t be out of any more
money.� The fine still stood even though
I was going to make it right the next morning.

After I put away
the groceries, I was told to vacuum and dust while Ann worked on a
project.� As I cleaned, I began to dread
the end of the school day when her children would come home and see me in my
new role as their mom�s employee.� I
hoped it would be low key, or even better, I would be dismissed before Nicole
and Jordan came
home.� I was vacuuming the formal living
room when Nicole entered the house.� She
was a senior, 18 years-old.� She stopped
for a moment when she noticed me in the living room.� Gave me a little wave and then went to look
for her mom.� Though Nicole seemed to
always have liked me, she also had the air of privilege and possessed the same
keen intelligence of her parents.

A minute later,
Ann appeared, again looking displeased.�
I shut off the vacuum.� �What do
you think you�re doing?�

�Vacuuming,� I
innocently said, knowing that this wasn�t the right answer.

�You didn�t see
Nicole come home?�

�Yes, I saw her.�

�You work for the
entire household, Mike, the entire family.�
I know she is a friend of your son and that you�ve known her a long
time, but you are now her employee and when she comes home from school or any
other time, you will check and see if there is
anything she needs.� Got it?�

I didn�t exactly
agree to be working for her daughter, but I wasn�t about to argue with
Ann.� �Got it, Mrs.
Moore.�

I went into the
kitchen where Nicole was sitting at the table.�
Before I could say anything she said, �Mom said you work for me now.�

�Yeah, I guess.�

�Miss
Nicole.�� Ann was standing right behind
me.

�Yes, I work for
your family now, Miss Nicole.�

�If there is anything
you need, you just tell him.� And if you
ever have any problems with him, if he disobeys you or does something wrong,
you tell me so we can correct his behavior.�

I was red again, I
felt like a dog or something.

�Okay,
mom.�� Ann went over and gave her
daughter a hug� �That�s
my baby.� All right, I�m going to finish
up my project.� Mike, after you�re done
with Nicole, finish your vacuuming then clean the
bathrooms.� I will warn you ahead of
time, there will be fines for incompetence.�

�Yes, Mrs. Moore,
I�ll get right on it.�

Ann left the room, I looked at
Nicole who was staring at me with a smirk on her face, it
was getting to be a familiar look.� �Is
there anything I can get you, Miss Nicole?� 

�This is kind of
cool.� I�ve never really had anyone working
for me before.�

�Well you do now.�
����������� �Did you forget something?�

���Miss Nicole.�

�Going
to have to report that to mom.�

Whatever.� �So, is there anything that I can get for
you, Miss Nicole?�

Nicole was still
reveling in her power.� �Calling my mom
Mrs. Moore, that�s weird�and me, Miss Nicole.�

�It�s a matter of
respect, Miss Nicole.�

�I like it.� Well, employee Mike, I want some apple slices
with peanut butter.�

I simply nodded my
head and opened the fridge to prepare the apples.

�Make sure that
you peel them, I don�t like the skin.�

I nodded my head
trying to avoid the Miss Nicole thing.

�Did you hear me?�

�Yes, Miss Nicole,
I heard you.�

I quickly prepared
her snack as I needed to get to work on the cleaning as I knew that Ann would
soon be expressing her impatience.� �Here
you go, Miss Nicole,� I said, laying the plate on the table, peanut butter in
the middle surrounded by her apple slices.

�Hey, that looks
cool.�
����������� Finally, a compliment even if
it was from a eighteen-year old.� �Thank you, Miss Nicole.� I need to go back to my cleaning.�

�All
right.� But I might want something
later.�

�Just let me know,
Miss Nicole.� It will be my pleasure,� I
lied.

I spent the rest
of the afternoon cleaning only stopping to fix another snack for Miss
Nicole.� After an intense scrubbing and
it was getting near five o�clock, I
finally decided to tell Ann that I was finished with the three bathrooms of the
house.� She was in the kitchen preparing
dinner.

�Mrs. Moore, I�m
finished with the bathrooms,� I said, feeling childish that I was reporting to
her in such a manner.� I�m sure Maria
never did such a thing.

�Fine.� I�ll check them when I get a chance.� Now, I want you to scrub the laundry room
floor.�

I looked at my
watch once again.� �How long were you
planning on me working today?�

��Mrs.
Moore.�� Ann corrected.� She wasn�t going to let go of that.

�Mrs. Moore.�

�Until
we�re done with you.�� She
returned to preparing her meal.

We hadn�t
discussed hours, but I assumed it was to be a regular hour gig.� Obviously, Ann had different thoughts.

�All right, Mrs.
Moore.�

As I began to
leave, Ann said, �Mike, this isn�t going to be easy.�

�I understand,
Mrs. Moore.�

�And I mean scrub
that floor, Mike.� Hands and knees, buff
it clean.�

�Yes, Mrs. Moore.�� I glanced over at Nicole
who was watching television, I�m sure she was laughing at me.� I got the necessary supplies and began
cleaning the bright white tile floor.� I
scrubbed for about five minutes when Ann appeared in the doorway.� Looking up from my kneeling position, she had
one hand on her hip, the other hand a crooked finger indicating that I was to
follow her.� She was imposing and the
look on her face meant she disapproved of my cleaning job.

�Come on, Mike,
let�s go,� she huffed.

Now what?� I stood and followed her with a dread of
pupil going to the principal�s office.�
First visit was the downstairs bathroom where Ann ran her finger along
the edge of the basin and displayed the residue of cleaning powder that I
hadn�t completely removed.� �This isn�t
acceptable.� I thought you said this was
clean.�

I didn�t know what
to say.� I had never seen Ann this angry before, or even angry period.� She had hidden this side of her
personality.� �I�m sorry Mrs. Moore�it
won�t happen again.�

�It better
not.� That�s a ten dollar penalty.�

�Ten
dollars��� I stopped,
no need to escalate the issue.

�And the roll of
tissue is to be folded like this.�� Ann
demonstrated a small triangle on the tissue.�
�That�s only going to cost you three dollars.� But each time I find that the tissue is not folded
properly, you will be penalized.�� She
stopped for a moment as I waited for the next criticism.� �Aren�t you going to write down those fines?�

�Oh,
okay, Mrs. Moore.�� I pulled the
spiral notebook and pen out of my pocket.�
Ann had instructed me to carry those with me at all times, not only to
note my fines, but in case she had something she wanted purchased or something
to be recalled.

Gee, she expected
me to check the paper every time anyone was in the bathroom?� I knew the upstairs bathrooms were the
same.� I wanted to run ahead and fix them
before I was penalized for them, but I didn�t have that chance as Ann told me
to follow her.� We entered the master
bathroom and the first thing Ann did was point at the toilet paper that wasn�t
in a triangle and simply said, �That�s another three dollars.

She found a couple
of hairs in the tub, a little dust underneath the cabinet and a handle that she
didn�t think was suitably polished.� Another five dollars worth of fines.� Onto the children�s bathroom where I was
informed that fines would be doubled.� Again, a few minor flaws that cost me another ten dollars.� While we were doing this, Jeff had arrived
home.� We could hear him talking with
Nicole, but the words were indistinguishable.�
I could see Ann visibly brighten at the sound of her husband�s voice, I only wished he had arrived earlier to put her in a
better mood.� Still, it wasn�t going to
be easy to see Jeff in my new role.� And
then I heard another male voice and realized that Nicole�s twin brother was home,
an arrogant kid who was the typical popular jock at school type.

�Fix what I showed
you, finish the floor downstairs while we eat.�
After dinner, then you can meet with Jeff.�

�Yes, Mrs. Moore.�

Ann
disappeared.� It wouldn�t take long to
finish the bathrooms and that would only leave the laundry room.� I was looking forward to going home.� It had been a long day.

I finished the
laundry room and avoided seeing Jeff.�
After semi-hiding behind my chores, I could hear them finishing up with
dinner that smelled so good, my stomach aching for a meal, Ann only allowing me
a banana.� I had also bought a candy bar
at the grocery store.� Ann was calling
for me and I had no choice except to face the entire family.� I took a deep breath and walked into the
kitchen where they all sat around the dining table.

�Hi Jeff,� I said,

Ann glared at me
and cleared her throat reminding me of my error.

�I mean, hello Mr.
Moore.�

�Hello, Mike.� How was your first day?�

It sucked.� �It was fine, Mr. Moore.�

�Mike,� Nicole
said. ��Get me more cola.��� Jeff looked at his daughter with a bit of
surprise, but the grins on everyone else�s face, except mine of course, relaxed
his attitude.

�Yes, Miss
Nicole,� I said, getting the soft drink from the refrigerator.

�Isn�t that cool,
dad,� Nicole said.� �Our
own employee.� Mom says we can
boss him around all we want.�

�Oh she did, did
she?�� Jeff was now smiling at his wife.

�Yep.� He has to keep our rooms clean.� Fetch us drinks and snacks.� Anything we want.�

�Well, Nicole, to
a point, Mike has certain duties that he must attend to.�

�Oh, we know,�
Jordan, Jeff and Ann�s son said.� �We
know we have to share.�

�This is quite a
change isn�t it Mike?� Still want to work
for the Moore family?�

�Sure,
Mr. Moore.�

�Clean off the
table and wash the dishes.� Then in the
office.�

Jeff rose from the
table.� �Let�s watch some television.�

I watched him for
a moment.� He was wearing dark slacks,
dress shirt, blue socks, his shoes in the garage
closet.� He moved with arrogant
confidence.� It was hard to believe this
man was in control of my life at the moment.�
I had beaten him many times on the golf course as Jeff wasn�t
athletic.� In fact, physically, he was
kind of soft with a slight belly around his middle.� But he never lost that attitude and could dig
the knife in whenever needed.� I finished
up my chores as the Moore family
relaxed on the sofas.� Jeff
and the kids watching a movie, Ann thumbing through a decorating magazine.� When I was done, I went over and stood behind
Jeff and said, �Mr. Moore, I�m finished.�

Jeff looked
straight ahead as he firmly said, �Didn�t I tell you to go to the office when
you were done?� Or are you just stupid?�

Stupid.� I felt ready to punch him as his kids laughed
at the comment.� �Well excuse me, Mr.
Moore.�� I couldn�t hid
the sarcasm in my voice.� �I will go to
the office now.�

�I�ll deal with
you in a moment,� Jeff snapped.

I waited probably
forty minutes before Jeff entered the office along with Ann.� I was sitting at the desk, moping about my
situation�� �Out of my seat, Mike� Jeff
said.� �You�re not allowed to sit on our
furniture.�

I stood up and Ann
sat in the other chair.� �I don�t
appreciate your attitude,� Jeff said as he imitated my �excuse me, Mr. Moore.�

�I�m sorry Jef�Mr. Moore.� I�m
very tired and it�s been a long day.�

�I don�t give a
damn about your day or your excuses.� You
wanted to work for us and we were generous enough to give you a job.� If you don�t like it, then get lost.�

�It�s not that��
����������� �And the way you are going,
you�ll never make it through the probationary period anyhow.� I should fire you right now.�� Jeff was slinked back in his chair, his
fingers interlocking, legs crossed as he studied my reaction.

I don�t know what
it was, but I was about to cry.

�Don�t you have
anything to say for yourself?�

�I�uh�I need the
job, Mr. Moore.�

�I don�t like the
Mr. Moore, just make it sir.�

�I need the job,
sir.�� I was now calling my former pal,
sir.

�I don�t know,
honey.� I had to fine him a lot
today.� I don�t know if he is worth the
trouble.�� Ann was enjoying this,
watching her husband put me through the ringer.

�True, from what
Ann has told me, by the end of the week, you�ll be owing
us money.�

�You were serious
about the fines?�

�Of course we
were, idiot,� Ann said.

I blushed from
being called an idiot.� Jeff said, �Mike,
you have to show us that you really want the job,�

�And how should I
do that, sir?�
����������� �Think of something.�

I wasn�t sure what
he wanted, but I sensed this was going to take another direction.� For some reason, I was desperate to work for
them.� �I really really
want the job, sir�Mrs. Moore.�

�You can call me,
ma�am, matches the sir.�

�Ma�am.�

Jeff got an evil
little smile on his face.� �Beg for your
job.� Show us how much you care, how
badly you need to work for us.�

I had tears in my
eyes as I sniveled, �Please, sir, ma�am, may I work for you.� I�ll do whatever I can for you.�

Ann was grinning
as she said, �I think the little baby is crying�wah�wah�wah�

Jeff laughed.�� �You know, when I see someone beg, I think
they should demonstrate proper respect for their superiors.�

Ann piped in with,
�Yes, kneel and beg for your job.�

By now, I no
longer cared.� I fell to my knees,
sinking into the carpet and said, �I beg you, sir, ma�am, may I please keep my
job?�

Ann also had her
legs crossed and was bouncing her leg up and down.� I think the whole scene was getting her
excited.� �I don�t know, dear, do we
allow him to work for us?� she said dramatically.

Jeff was staring
down at me, seriously contemplating something.�
�I don�t know�I suppose we can give it a little more time.�

�You�re so kind,
honey.�� Ann was sitting next to Jeff and
leaned over and gave him a kiss.� �Show Jeff your appreciation for his kindness.�

�What do you mean,
ma�am?�� 

�Kiss his feet and
say thank you, kind and generous sir for giving this old washed-up loser a
job.�

�What?� Are you kidding?�

�Just do it,� Ann
sneered.

I looked up at
Jeff who shrugged his shoulders as if to say, what can I
do about it.� I knew this was a now or
never moment and was strangely excited by the whole situation.� Not kissing Jeff�s feet, that was way beyond
anything I had imagined, but I wouldn�t mind kissing Ann�s pretty feet.� I crawled forward and quickly kissed the top
of Jeff�s socked foot and said, �Thank you for your kindness and generosity,
sir in giving this old, washed-up loser a job,� just as Nicole appeared in the
doorway.

�What are you guys
doing?�

I couldn�t see her
reaction, but it must have been amazing to see me in this position.� And how much did she hear?� It was true, I was a washed-up loser.

�Is he kissing
your feet, dad?�

�Don�t worry about
it, Nicole, we�ll be done in a moment.�� Jeff was not pleased by his daughter�s
appearance.

�Can I make him
kiss my feet too?� she eagerly asked.

�We�ll talk about
it later,� Ann said, �go back to the television.�

�Sure.�

�And shut the
door,� Ann added.

The door shut and
Ann said, �Now, where were we?�

�Mike was thanking
me.�� Jeff sounded pleased.

�That�s right,�
Ann said.� �Do it again and mean it.� And Jeff has two feet.�

�Yes,
ma�am.�� I once again kissed the
top of Jeff�s crossed over foot, then scrunched over further and kissed the
foot that was on the ground.� Jeff�s feet
had a moderately strong aroma and it was enormously humiliating to be kissing
them.� As I was doing this, Ann had
picked up a digital camera from the desk.�


�Again,� she
commanded, �I want a record of this.�

I once again
kissed each foot, Ann taking a picture each time, making me pose so she could
make sure my face could be clearly seen.

�All right, do the
same for your Mistress,� Jeff said.

�What was that?�
Ann asked, a curious excitement in her voice.

�It seems
appropriate.� After all, we practically
own him.� Ma�am is ok for public stuff,
but Mistress Ann has a cool ring to it.�
Not quite so matronly.�

�Yeah, I like it,�
Ann mused.� �And that means, he should call you Master.�

�Yeah, whatever,
Master or sir is fine.� Go on�� Jeff
nudged me on my face cheek with his foot, �Kiss you Mistress� feet.�

�Yes,
Sir.�� I kissed the top of each of
Ann�s feet while Jeff snapped a few pictures with the camera.

�I can�t wait
until I show these to Joann,� Ann said with glee.

�Please don�t,
Mistress.�

�Are you telling
me what to do, Mike?�� She took her foot
and bopped me on top of my head with it.
����������� �No, Mistress but��

�You just do as your told and behave yourself and we�ll see about the
pictures.� Can you imagine all the moms
and dads at school seeing you kissing our feet?�� Ann and Jeff were both laughing.

�Yeah, that would
make quite the impression.�� Jeff agreed.

�Ah, look at the
little foot kisser, I think he�s going to cry some more.�� Ann loved rubbing it in.� �Joann was so right in leaving you.� I�m glad I encouraged her to do so.�

I had heard rumors
that Ann was behind motivating Joann to leave me.� Ann had always been so nice previously to me,
that I didn�t believe it.� Now, it was
all too easy to believe.� So much for the
image she projected.

�You have no idea
how much we know about you,� Ann said.�
�When Joann was planning the divorce, she asked for my help, which I gladly
gave her knowing what a loser you are.�
And Jeff here, being the computer expert, was kind enough to go through
your entire computer history.�

I knew I was
sunk.� The pornographic
websites that I used to visit.�
The movies and stories I downloaded.��
I�m sure he found it all.� They
say you tell about everything from a person from their computer and I know that
Jeff was a computer expert.

�You are quite the kinky little pervert.� Female domination websites, chicks with dicks
sites, all kinds of weird stuff.�

As Ann spoke, I
felt myself go nearly dizzy as if she could see into my being.

�There won�t be
any secrets, you�re going to tell us everything.� You�re going to live a lot of those things
you fantasized about.�

�When Ann and I
first talked about hiring you, we didn�t really know if it would come to this,
but if it did, we thought it might be fun to have a wimp to kick around.� We need the help, and the one thing you are
besides being perverted, is honest and reliable.� So no matter what, we figured we couldn�t
lose.� But when Ann called me this
morning telling me how easy it was to push you around, that
you scarcely raised a voice in protest, that�s when I told her to go for it, to
keep pushing you.� And since we knew that
deep down you crave this sort of thing�well, here we are.� You on your knees, kissing
our feet, crying like a baby begging for your job.� There are people in this world who rule, and those that serve, and I always got the feeling
you were one of the servers, the pleasers.�
It looks like I was right.�

I had my head down
and was staring at the floor.� No longer
sniveling, I knew that any submissive desires I had were about to explode.� Jeff put his foot under my chin and tilted my
head up.� �Look at your Master when I�m
talking to you, boy.� At
least, when you have permission to look at us.�
����������� �Yeah, I�m not so sure
I want the scumbag looking at me,� Ann chimed in.� �In fact, if I see you looking me in the
eyes, you will be fined big time.� You
keep your head bowed in my presence, look at my feet or something, like you do
all the time anyway.�

Yes, it was true, I was always looking at Ann�s feet.� I had no idea that she had noticed.� I looked up at Jeff, his dark brown eyes
intent as his wife�s eyes.� His foot still underneath my chin.� �You are now our slave, our servant.� You will do whatever you�re told, without
question, without problems.� Quickly and to the best of your ability.� Is that understood?�

�Yes,
Sir.�

�Good.� Ann and I will continue to fine you as we see
fit.� We will also begin punishing you
for your mistakes.� I would advise you to
do your best because I would love to take a paddle to that wimp ass of yours
which I will do anyway simply because I can.�

As I was looking
up at Jeff, I began to feel genuine fear as he talked of the paddle realizing
that he was serious about being a Master.�
Despite his arrogant nature, I never suspected he would be into such a
dark and kinky area.

�There is a lot we
will have to be going over, but I don�t want to take the time right now.� I�m sure the kids are quite curious about
what�s going on in here after Nicole saw you kissing my feet.�� Jeff was smiling.� �I guess that is something she is going to
see a lot of.�

�Yes, what are we
going to do about Nicole and Jordan?��
Ann asked.

�Like
we have been.� Explain that Mike
now works for us and that it is old-fashioned strict way of showing respect� It will work
out, don�t worry about it, honey.� After
all, they are now young adults.�

Ann smiled
lovingly at her husband and got up from her chair and positioned herself on
Jeff�s lap causing Jeff�s leg to jump around, his foot bumping into my face as
if I wasn�t even there.� �Mmm, all of this is making me hot, lover, � she cooed. 

I had never even
remotely seen this type of affection between them and it was, again, quite a
contrast.

�You�re not
looking at us, are you, scumbag?�� Ann
asked, between long kisses.

�No,
Mistress.�� I stared at the floor.

�Maybe we
shouldn�t do this in front of him,� Ann questioned.� �He doesn�t deserve such a treat.�

�Have to disagree
with you on that one, sweets.� He�s just a piece of shit property,
this is a little way to remind him of what he is missing.� What it�s like for a real man and his woman
to share intimacy.� I�m pretty sure once
we�re done with him, he�ll never entertain the thought of a genuine
relationship again.�

�True.�� Ann laughed.�
�Not that he was much in bed before.�
Isn�t that right, shithead?� Joann told me all about what a limp dick
worthless lover you were.�

I didn�t say anything, I was too embarrassed at the truth of the
statement.

�She asked you a question, do I have to get my belt off right now?�� 

I believe Jeff was
serious and wasn�t making a vague threat.

�No, Sir.� Mistress is correct.� I was�am a lousy
lover.�

Jeff chuckled.�
�I believe you, Mikey, I believe you.� I�ve never worried about you being around my
wife.� All that time you spent with her
when the kids played together, I never once thought, gee�is Mike screwing with
Ann.� Not only because I knew that she didn�t like you, but that we both had a good idea that
you were a wimp loser.� Repeat after me�I
am a wimp loser.�

Quietly and with
great dejection, I said, �I am a wimp loser.��
I looked up at Ann on Jeff�s lap.�
They made a great looking couple.�
The portrait of young suburbanite success.� They were embraced once again and thankfully
they didn�t notice my glance. 

�MMm, that was so nice,� Ann said, breaking apart their
kiss.� �I�d better go out front.�� She smoothed her skirt and stood up while I
remained with head bowed, keeping my eye on the floor.� �What are you going to do now?�

�I have some work
to do, shouldn�t keep me up too late tonight.�
But first, I was thinking that maybe I should punish that piece of crap
down there.�� Jeff kicked me lightly in the
ribs.� �So he gets an idea of what he can
expect in the future.�

�What about the
girls?� They�ll be sure to hear it.�

�Possibly.� We don�t have to tell them anything specific,
something like dad is correcting the servant�s behavior.� Eventually, I�m sure they�ll be witnessing
the discipline.�

�Or wanting to
mete it out themselves�especially that Nicole.�� Ann giggled.�
�She can be very tough.�

There was knocking
at the door, this time it was Jordan
yelling through the closed door.� �I
can�t find my guitar.�

�Just
a sec.� Ann said moving towards the door, �I wanted to watch you,
babe.� Give me a couple of minutes with
the kids, then I�ll be back.�

Ann left the room,
Jordan peeking
in and seeing me kneeling on the floor.�
I heard him ask Ann what was going on, Ann simply saying that they were
talking to Mike.� Jeff didn�t immediately
say anything, letting me squirm in the moment as I stared at the floor, feeling
his commanding presence over me.� Finally
he said, �If you try to run away from us, we�ll be sure to ruin your life
though it�s pretty much headed that way anyway.�

�Yes, Sir, I
understand.�� 

�But you probably
like this anyway.�� Before I could say
anything more, Ann returned.

�Okay, they seem
to know that something is going on, so we�d better do this quick.� I�ll guard the door.�� Ann was excited as if she was kid on
Christmas morning.

�Stand up, shithead.�

I was scared, so
nervous I was nearly shaking.� �Please,
Sir, do we have to do this?�

Ann laughed at my
pitiful plea.� �I think the wimp is
scared.�

�Stand up and drop
your pants.�� Jeff�s voice was deep and
serious and growing agitated.

I stood up and
fumbled around with my belt and then dropped my jeans.� Despite my nerves and fear, I was also
excited, my cock straining against my boxer shorts.

Jeff had a voice
of disgust and impatience.� �Underwear too, idiot.�

�Geez, look how little he is even with all his excitement,�
Ann said as I pulled down my underwear, both it and my jeans piling at my
ankles.� I was looking down at the
ground, but I could hear Jeff undo his belt buckle.

�Bend over the
chair.�

I shuffled over to
the office chair that was in front of the desk and bent over the arms.� It was very uncomfortable, the arms hard and
digging into my ribs though I�m sure that Jeff and Ann could care less.

�Comfortable,
Mike?�� Jeff asked his voice
filled with obvious happiness at my predicament.

�Not really, Sir.�

�Good.� I don�t want you to be and I want this
punishment to be etched clearly on your mind.�
You will not��� Jeff wasted no
time and delivered the first blow from the belt, it was firm landing with a
loud splat. I gasped from the pain.�
��ever forget your place.�� Jeff punctuating the four words with four quick lashes of the belt.� There was no warm up and nothing erotic about
being beaten by the man.

�Please, Sir, I won�t
forget my place.�� I had squirmed and
thrashed about as he hit me.

�Keep your voice
down,� Jeff commanded giving me another brutal slash with the belt, this one
causing me to involuntarily cry out.�
�Shut up you stupid pig,� he said quietly but angrily.� �You�re not going to control yourself are
you?� You are going to have to learn to
take a beating without making a sound.�
For now��� Jeff reached down and
pulled off one of socks, �you get this.�

Ann laughed and
said, �Oh god, that is beautiful,� as Jeff stuffed the malodorous, damp sock
into my mouth causing me to gag slightly as he pushed it in deep. 

�You like that,
darling?�

�Yes, it�s
fantastic, sweets.�� Ann was backed up
against the door, and I believe I detected a change in her voice and breathing
as if she was excited.

�Get ready for
more, pig.�� 

I bent over and
steeled myself.� Jeff laid the leather on
thick and harsh.� One lash after the
other in quick succession, my mind flashing white with pain as I moaned into
the sock gag, spittle running down my face, tears forming in my eyes.� I was nearly hyperventilating from the agony
and was praying that this would soon end.�
I couldn�t believe how sadistic the mild-manner Jeff was as he continued
my beating.� He finally stopped, I�m not
sure how much time had passed, but it seemed like an eternity.� I could hear him breathing hard,
my ass was throbbing and felt like it was swollen to twice its normal
size.� The room was very quiet like
everyone was exhausted from one long orgasm.�
I didn�t dare move until I was told to.

Finally, Jeff
said, �That was quite a workout.� Next
time, maybe I�ll use one of Nicole�s riding crops that she loves to use on her
horses.�

Ann seemed awed by
the situation.� �Look at his ass.�

Jeff laughed.� �Goddamn, I did fuck him up, didn�t I?�� Jeff was moving around and picking up the
camera from the desk.� He snapped a few
pictures of my battered bottom.� �You�ll
look at these everyday as a reminder of the power your Master has,� he said.

�Yes, Sir,� I
mumbled, the sock still in my mouth.

�I�d better check
out front.�� Before she did, Ann walked
over and traced a finger across my bottom.�
�Look at all those welts and bruises.�
I wouldn�t want to make you mad, honey,� she said tenderly to Jeff.

�Yeah, can you
imagine what I could do if I was angry?� 

Ann snuggled up
and gave Jeff a long hug and kiss.� �Mmm, yeah babe, I don�t know if I could imagine, but I
wouldn�t want to be there.�� Ann gave me
a hard slap with her bare hand on my tender and sensitive ass, which caused me
to jump excessively.� She laughed and
said, �Look at that, a little slap from me and he almost goes through the
wall.� I�ll see you soon?�

�Yes, I�ll finish
up with him and then will be out.�� 

Ann left the room
once again and I remained still.� Jeff
ran the leather of his belt across my damaged ass.� �That was enjoyable and a warning to you that
we�re not kidding around.� Understand?�

I mumbled another
yes.

Laughing, Jeff
pulled the sock from my mouth.� �Yuck,
you got my sock all wet and there is drool on the chair.� I should beat your ass for that.�
����������� Broken, fearing it meant more
whipping, I fell to my knees and started frantically kissing his feet, one
bare, the other still with a sock.�
�Please, Sir, please, Master, no more�I can�t take it.�

Jeff snickered as
a kissed his feet.� �All right, if it
means that much to you.� I�ve got better
things to do right now than beat your ass.�

�Thank you, thank
you, Sir.�

�But I like this
groveling, Mike.� Very
appropriate.�

If possible, I
felt even more embarrassed in the manner I had totally debased myself.� This was someone who not long ago I had
considered an equal, and now I was groveling and slobbering his feet with
kisses, completely defeated.

�You know you look
ridiculous.� Pants and
underwear at your ankles, crawling around on the floor.� Take off my sock.�

I removed his
sock.

�Kiss my
foot.�� As I kissed his foot, he
continued, �Whenever you remove our shoes, socks, stockings, you will kiss our
feet to show your reverence and humbleness.�
And you will be doing that often.�
In fact, when you are here, you know our rule about no shoes in the
house, whenever we enter or leave the house, you will
remove or put on our shoes.� You will
have a myriad of duties that we will get into later.� For now, pull up your pants.� Wipe the drool off the chair and come out
front.�

Jeff left the room
while I quickly cleaned up.� I wondered
how much the twins heard, they must have heard the slapping of the leather on
my skin; what would they think was going on?�
I took a deep breath and walked out front.� Jeff and Ann, with his arm around Ann, were
sitting on the couch between their children.�
They all took glances at me then returned to watching
television.� I was exhausted and
wanted to go home.� I stood at the
kitchen counter that bordered the casual room and waited for Jeff or Ann to say
something, the room was eerily quiet, the daughters not their usual perky, loud
selves.� I�m sure that they knew.

Finally, I had to
say something.� �Is there anything else I
need to do today?�

�I want a Popsicle,�
Nicole said.

�Yes, Miss
Nicole.�� I hurried to the
refrigerator.� �What flavor, Miss
Nicole?�

�I don�t
know�strawberry.�

I retrieved the
Popsicle and went into the room and handed it to her.� It meant walking in front of the rest of the
family as Nicole was on the far side of the sectional.� As I handed it to her, Jeff showed his
displeasure and error of my ways.

�You just got in
our way.� Do you expect us to move our
heads so you can do your work?�

�No, Sir.�� I was getting fearful again that he would
punish me.

�You didn�t open
it, stupid,� Nicole said.� No one said a
work about her calling me stupid.

�Oh, sorry, Miss
Nicole.�

I opened the
package then knew I had to retreat to the other side of the room.� Jeff seemed to sense my dilemma.� �Crawl.�
Keep yourself low enough so you don�t block our view.�

I fell to my belly
to keep low enough, then squirmed across the floor to the laughter of the
family, particularly the girls.

�That�s so funny,�
Jordan said.

Nicole added,
�This is way too cool.� Can I make him do
something, dad?� Please��

�Like what,
honey?�

�I don�t know�make
him bark or something.�

�All right, you
can do that.�

�Bark, Mike,
bark.�

�Woof�woof.�

This completely
cracked up the girls, �That�s a good doggie,� Nicole said.� I glanced at Mike and Ann sharing a look that
they knew Nicole was going to run with this.�
She took the wrapper off the Popsicle and threw it onto the floor.

Ann started to say
something about Nicole throwing her trash on the floor when Nicole said,
�Fetch, doggie.� 

I was still on my
hands and knees and I turned and looked at Ann and Jeff with pleading and
questioning eyes�did I have to do this?�
I also glanced at the 18-year-old Nicole, who was looking at me with a
challenge to disobey her, her brown eyes as intense as her mother�s.� Nicole was wearing shorts and a blouse, her
bare feet rested right next to the wrapper on the floor.

Jeff calmly said
with a smirk.� �Do what your told, Mike.�

I turned around
crawled to pick up the wrapper.� As I
reached for it, Nicole plopped her foot on top of it.� �Pick it up with your mouth, doggie, doggies
don�t have hands.�

Ann laughed.� �Nicole, you are so mean.�

Nicole proudly
said, �Yep and Mike is going to learn just how mean.�

�Don�t get carried
away with yourself,� Jeff warned.

�I won�t, dad.�

Nicole�s foot was
directly on top of the wrapper and I couldn�t get to it.� �What�s the matter, doggie, can�t you reach
it.�
����������� �No, Miss
Nicole.�

�Ask me nicely and
maybe I�ll move my foot.�

�Miss Nicole,
could you please move your foot.�� I glanced
up at Ann and Jeff to see their reaction to all of this.� They appeared rapped on the television.

�I saw you look at
me, Mike.� That�s another ten dollars,�
Ann said.

�Yes,
ma�am.� Please, Miss Nicole��I
begged.

She moved her foot
enough to expose half the wrapper.� �With your mouth, doggie.�

When I leaned over
to pick up the wrapper with my teeth Nicole took her foot and planted on my
face covering my nose and mouth.� �Do you
like my feet, doggie?� Do they smell good?�

Nicole�s feet had
a strong odor, I knew she often wore sneakers without socks, and I wasn�t sure
what to say.� �You have very nice feet,
Miss Nicole.�
����������� �Yeah right, doggie,� she
said, shoving my face with her foot, before pulling it back.� �Pick it up!� she ordered.

I picked up the wrapper.


�Crawl out of here
and put it into the trash with your mouth.�
No hands.�� Giggles from the
others accompanied my humiliation as I crawled through the living room.

Her voice
cheerful, Ann asked, �Nicole, where did you learn to be so mean?�

�It comes
naturally, mom�Don�t use your hands to open the cabinet door, doggie.�

I was about to
reach for the door when Nicole said that, instead, I pushed the door open with
my nose and then dropped the Popsicle wrapper into the trash with my mouth,
shutting the door with my nose.� I
crawled back to the edge of the carpet and the hard wood floors.� Jeff said, �Get out here, Mike,
you�re going to have a long day tomorrow.�

�Yes, sir,� I
said, standing.� No one even looked at
me.� �Goodbye.�� Again, ignored, like I wasn�t
even there.� This was humiliating,
I wasn�t even worthy of human acknowledgement.�
I left the house, went home, ate a quick dinner and collapsed into
bed.� I was sure Jeff was right about one
thing, tomorrow was going to be a hard day.

HELP WANTED

PART TWO

&nbsp;

All rights
reserved.

&nbsp;

Three times during the night I received phone calls
from the Moore family, so much for
getting sleep, once from Ann telling me to pick up a coffee for her and Maria
from the coffee bar.� The two other calls
were from Jeff instructing me to be at the house at 7 a.m. and to bring fresh bagels.� Jeff�s second call coming at three a.m. was about the bagels and to tell me
to let myself in with a key he had hidden on the side of the house. 

When I arrived at the house, everything was quiet
and peaceful, a suburban peace that was a contrast to
that of what my life was becoming, a servant, almost a slave to the Moore
family.� A simple thing like the
newspaper lying on the driveway took on new proportions�what if I didn�t bring
it into the house on time or even in the correct manner?� Would I receive a whipping for making too
much noise entering their home that morning?�
I was anxious, knowing that any little error could mean discipline,
humiliation, verbal disgrace.

I found the key
and let myself into the house, arriving precisely at seven, having waited five
minutes outside so I would arrive at the proper time.� Any earlier or later and I knew I could be
subjected to punishment.� My thought
process was no longer the same, almost not my own.� I had begun to think, anticipate what the
family might require next.� I heard
nothing when I came into the home, eerily quiet, I
wasn�t sure what to do next.� I figured
my Master and Mistress�yeah, I was already thinking of my former friends as
Master and Mistress, were still in bed and I didn�t want to disturb them.� I was no longer their friend,
after all, it had been less than twelve hours since I broke down in Jeff�s
office.� Whatever happened, I would never
be an equal in their eyes.� There was no
turning back.� Unless I was to run and
hide develop a new life, it looked like I would be working for the Moore
family.� I could only hope that they
would tire of abusing me, but I suspected that it would only grow worse.

�What are you doing
down there, stupid, trying to think?�

Jeff�s voice had
broken my reverie.� I looked up and saw
him standing halfway down the staircase.�
�Not exactly, sir.�

�First bring me
the paper, then prepare the bagels and bring Ann her coffee.� We will be having breakfast in bed this
morning.�

�Yes, sir,� I said
pacing quickly to the stairs.� I went
halfway up the staircase and started to hand Jeff the paper.

�You don�t hand it
to me like that, servant,� he said, emphasizing servant like I was a piece of
trash.� �You kneel and hand it to me,
with respect.�

�Yes,
sir.�� I knelt and held up the
paper for Jeff to take which he did after making me hold the position for a
moment.� His bare feet were almost eye
level and I had a good idea what would be next.

�You may greet
your Master good morning��� Jeff put his
foot to my lips.� I kissed his foot and
then the other.� �Go fix our breakfast.� When the girls wake up, I�m sure they�ll want
something.�

�Yes, sir, right
away.�

�Good, Mike, your
beginning to understand now, aren�t you?�

�Yes, sir, thank
you, sir.�

�Very
good.� You will find life much
easier if you simply accept your new status, your true calling.� The less you think about your pitiful self,
and the more you think about pleasing us, obeying us, the better off you will
be.�

�Yes, sir, I will
try.�

�Trying is not
good enough�I�m sure you know that.�

�Of
course, sir.� Is there anything
you would like to drink for breakfast, sir?�

�Ah, very good,
slave, that�s what I mean.� There is hope
for you yet.� Orange juice will be fine.�

Jeff returned to
his bedroom and I went to the kitchen to prepare their morning meal.� Bagels toasted and sliced, put on nice
plates, cream cheese and lox on another plate.�
I poured Ann�s coffee out of the paper cup into her nice china, Jeff�s
juice into a glass.� I found a silver
platter that was in the formal living room and put everything on it and carried
it upstairs and entered the bedroom.�
Jeff was reading the newspaper, Ann was asleep beside him.

I started to walk
towards the bed when Jeff said, �Ahem, aren�t you forgetting something?�� He pointed downward indicating that I was to
kneel and shuffle across the floor on my knees holding the tray in hand.

Though this was
very difficult with the food and heavy tray, I made it to the bedside and held
the tray up for Jeff.� �Ann, honey,
breakfast is being served.�

Ann stirred and
sat up in bed.� She was wearing a sheer
purple nightgown and I only glimpsed at her.�
Everything seemed so intimate, yet informal.� Jeff was in his boxer shorts and Ann the
nightgown, neither showing any modesty.�
It stamped my new status as being so lowly that they didn�t even care
about my seeing them in the intimate setting.�
She looked over at me and smiled.�
�I like this.� The
king and queen being waited upon by the serf.�

Jeff kissed her on
the neck.� �Get used to it, baby.� Mike will be waiting upon us hand and
foot.� And if he ever displeases us�last
night�s whipping will be like a walk in the park.�

My arms were
already getting a little tired from holding the tray up, but I concentrated on
not wavering. 

�Would you like
some coffee, sweets?�� Jeff handed Ann
her cup of coffee and took his juice.�
�Is this fresh squeezed?�
����������� I�m sure Jeff knew it
wasn�t.� �No, sir.�

�Five
demerits.� Instead of simply
fining you, we want you to keep track with points.� Then later, we can decide whether to hand out
your punishment in dollar fines or taking it out of your ass, or both.� You do have your book with you, don�t you?�

�Absolutely,
sir.�

Sleepy eyed Ann
looked over at me with a wry smile.�
�This is too cool.� I can�t
believe how much I am enjoying this.�
Slave, over here, I need to put down my coffee.�� Remaining on my knees, I quickly shuffled
around to the other side of the bed and held the tray out for Ann to her coffee
on.� �Do it faster next time,� she
snapped.

I wanted to look
at her, but I kept my head bowed not wanting to risk further demerits.� �Yes, Mistress.�

�Slave, I want a
bagel now.�

�Yes, Master
Jeff.�� I quickly shuffled to the other
side, my knees already getting sore and raw from the crawling.

�More
coffee.�� The torment and
amusement continued as the couple ran me back and forth enjoying watching me
suffer as I tried to accommodate their commands.� They laughed and barked orders until my knees
were bleeding.

�Master Jeff, I�m
afraid my knees are starting to bleed and I don�t want to get any blood on the
carpet.�� I could see that this
information displeased Jeff very much.� I
was already sweating and tired and it was only seven-thirty; I couldn�t imagine
how I was going to feel by the end of the day.

�You think we give
a fuck about your knees.� Go into the
bathroom and get some tape out of the cabinet underneath the sink and wrap your
knees.� Hurry up, piglet.�

�Yes,
Sir.�� I put the serving tray on a
dresser and did as he told.� I could hear
Ann and Jeff snuggling and kissing again as I did my best to repair my damaged
knees so I wouldn�t stain the carpet.�
Gathering up the tray and kneeling back down at the bedside, I kept my
head bowed except for a quick glance where I saw Jeff and Ann embracing and
kissing.� I felt insignificant and
jealous that he was getting to enjoy the erotic warmth of Ann while I simply
knelt and waited like I wasn�t even there.

�Can you go in to
work a little late, after the kids are off to school?�� Ann asked, somewhat breathless as she was
growing excited.

Jeff was moaning
with pleasure as Ann nibbled on his neck.�
�I shouldn�t, babe, but you�ve got me so hot��� Jeff stopped as if he remembered I was in the
room.� �Yeah, let�s get the twins out the
door, then we�ll have some fun.� Slave, take the tray downstairs and then
check on Joran and Nicole and see what they need.�

�Yes, Master I
understand.�

�Good.�

Ann stirred from
the bed gathering a robe from her closet.�
�I�m going to freshen up.�

�I�ve got to make
a couple of calls, hurry back when you can.�
����������� �MMm,
you better believe it, lover, I will.��
Ann went over and gave Jeff another kiss as I was exiting the
bedroom.� �I can�t believe how horny I am
this morning.�

�Me too, baby, me
too.�

����������� I
walked over to Nicole�s room and gently knocked on the door.� �Miss Nicole, it�s Mike, may I bring you
something for breakfast?�

����������� I
could hear Nicole stirring in her room.�
�Bring me a cheese omelet and a cup of tea, and hurry up.�

����������� �Yes,
Miss Nicole, right away.�� I couldn�t
believe I was letting this eighteen-year-old girl treat me so rudely.�� I then knocked on Jordan�s
door.� I wasn�t sure how to address
him.� �Excuse me, Jordan,
may I bring you something to eat?� I asked politely while feeling ridiculous at
the thought of serving him breakfast in bed and being so docile towards him.

����������� The
door flew open and Jordan
was standing there.� Shirtless and
barefoot, he was wearing blue jeans and a grin on his face.� �Wow, you�re already here.� What did you want?�

����������� The
whole thing was embarrassing.� �I was
asking if you would like me to bring you some breakfast.�

����������� �You
want to like, uh, bring me breakfast?�
Like breakfast in bed?�

����������� �If
that�s what you wish, Sir.�

����������� �Sir?� I like
that.� And yes, I usually don�t eat
breakfast, but bring me a Mountain Dew and a donut.� Make it quick.�

����������� �Yes, Sir.�� The thought of a soft drink and donut for breakfast disgusting.

����������� I
quickly prepared the twin�s food and brought it back upstairs.� I was relieved that I wouldn�t be required to
crawl in their presence, we hadn�t, at least up until
then, reached the point where I would have to do that.� Knocking at Nicole�s door, she said, �What?�
like I had disturbed her.

����������� �I
have your breakfast,� Miss Nicole, �tea and omelet.�

����������� �Just
a minute, retard, I�m getting dressed.�

����������� �Yes,
Miss.�

����������� I
walked over to Jordan�s
room and did the same.� He told me to
come in where he was laying on the bed, watching television.� �He is your breakfast, Sir.�� I placed the tray on the bedside table.� �Is there anything else?�

����������� �Not
right now, but I�m sure there will be.�

����������� �Yes,
I�m sure they will.� I need to take Miss
Nicole her food.�

����������� �Whatever,
dork.�

I quickly ran back
over to Nicole�s room, I hoped I hadn�t missed her request to bring her
breakfast.� Again, I found it amazing
that I had reached the point already were I was genuinely worried about making
an error in my mundane task of serving a breakfast. 

As I reached
Nicole�s door, my question was quickly answered.� �I said I was ready, asshole,� she said,
reaching the door at the same time I did, �where were you?�

�I was serving Jordan
his food.�

Whack.� Nicole slapped me in the face.� The shock and the audacity of the blow
overshadowed the stinging sharpness of her young hand against my face.� �Listen, old man, I don�t want to hear about
your excuses�� she slapped me again, this time even harder.� �I had to get up from the bed to see where
you were.�

My face felt warm
from where her slaps had landed, I was certain that she had left hand imprints
on my face.� �I�m sorry, Miss Nicole��

�Apologize in the
proper manner, Mike,��
Jeff said, walking up from behind.

I looked back, I�m
sure pleading was etched on my face.� �Proper manner?�

He pointed
downward and said, �Don�t act like you don�t know.�

I looked at the
smug face of Nicole who was leaning on the edge of the door jam, tapping her
barefoot on the carpet.� She also was
wearing jeans, along with a tshirt.� I knew what was expected even though I
couldn�t imagine that I was about ready to kneel at the feet of an
eighteen-year-old and beg her forgiveness.�
I sank to my knees and kissed her toes.�
�Please forgive Miss Nicole.�

�Not good enough,�
she said, her voice heavy with arrogance.� �Try again.�
Impress me, flat on your belly like the worm that you are.�

I laid flat on my
belly.� I could sense Jeff and Ann
standing behind me as I groveled before their daughter.� �I beg you, please forgive Miss Nicole.�� I reverently kissed her toes of her left foot
as the right foot pressed into my neck.

�Don�t let it happen
again.�

�No, Miss Nicole,
I won�t.�

�Ten demerits,�
Jeff announced as Nicole kept me pinned against the carpet with her foot on my
neck.

�Yes, Sir,� I
replied.

Nicole finally
stepped off of me and returned to her bed.�
�You may serve me breakfast, worm,� she said.

�Yes, Miss
Nicole.�� I picked up the tray and
carried it over to her and knelt at the bedside and offered her the food.� �Lay it on the bed and get out of here.�

I did as she
told.� The next fifteen minutes were
spent cleaning the kitchen until the kids were ready to leave for school.� Then I had to fetch their sneakers and put
them on their feet, Nicole having me tie her shoes three times before she found
the acceptable tightness.� After they
left, I went back into the house that was now very quiet.� I knew that Jeff and Ann were both still
home, their cars parked in the garage.�
Unsure of what to do next, I didn�t want to bother them because I
suspected they were having sex and the last thing I wanted to do was to
interrupt them.� I checked the toilet
paper in the bathrooms to make sure it was folded properly and did some other
puttering around.� After about a half
hour I heard Jeff yelling for me.� I ran
upstairs to their bedroom and knocked on the door.

�You wanted me,
Master?�

�Get in here.�

Entering the
bedroom I saw Ann resting her head on Jeff�s chest, the musky essence of sex
permeating the room.� They had the sheet
pulled up to their shoulders so I couldn�t see much of their naked bodies, Jeff had a devilish grin on his face as he stroked
Ann�s hair.� �This is something you will
never experience again.�

I knelt at the end
of the bed.� How does he know that?� I no longer felt like an equal human, I felt
more like I was their property or an object.

�You�re not worthy
of entering a woman�s sweet hot cunt.�

Ann laughed.� �Jeff, such talk.�

�You know it�s
true, you would never let him near your pussy�at least not unless you were
going to piss on him or maybe let him eat my cum out
of you if he works hard enough to earn the reward.�

�Wow, you are
wicked this morning,� Ann said, her voice edged with
excitement.

�Would you like
that, slave, to eat my cum out of Ann?�

I didn�t know the
answer to the question.� While the idea
of Jeff�s sperm was revolting, the thought of being allowed to lick Ann�s pussy
almost overwhelmed any revulsion towards Jeff�s sexual deposit. 

�I asked you a
question slave��

�Yes, I would,� I
finally admitted.

�I thought so.�

Ann�s voice was
tarnished with disgust.� �I�m not sure I
want his mouth anywhere near my pussy though I do like the idea of him being
used to clean me up like he was a mop or something.�

Jeff acted like he
was drifting off into a thought.� �I
doubt if he is at all worthy of either one of us.� For right now, he�s lucky to taste our foot
sweat, maybe I�ll let him feast on my toe jam.�

�That�s
disgusting,� Ann said.

�Yes, but Mike
here better get used to the idea.� After
all, he will be expected to clean my feet after my basketball games.�

�You�re really
getting gross.�� Ann was giggling, not
sounding all that disgusted.

�He�d better hope
that I don�t make him do the whole team.�
Now that would be rank.� Wouldn�t
it, slave?�

�Yes, Master,� I
answered, totally dejected wishing that I had never started with this.� I couldn�t imagine having to do that.� �You really wouldn�t make me do that would
you?�

�You never
know.�� Jeff looked like he savored the
thought.� �Drop your pants and
underwear.� I want to see how that ass
looks.�

�Yes,
Sir.�� I didn�t want to strip for
them, but knew it was useless to argue.�
I stood up and removed the clothing.�
The air in the room was cool and made me more uncomfortable than I
already was.� I started to put my hands
in front of my genitals.

�Hands at your
side,� Jeff commanded.

Ann was laughing
as I stood in front of them, again feeling humiliated.� �It�s so freakn� small,� she said, referring to the size of my
penis.

�He�s like a
eunuch.� Is that what you are Mike?� A eunuch?�

�No, Sir.�

�You are now.� At least while you�re in our employ.� Turn around.�

I did as
instructed, Jeff whistled as he saw my bruised and swollen ass.� �I did a number on you, didn�t I?�

�Yes Sir.�� I felt so humiliated and lowly knowing that
the person who I once thought as a friend, an equal, I had consented to allow
to beat me, that I was nothing much more than an object to him, something well
below his stature.

�You�d better
behave today, because it would hurt like hell if we had to punish you further,
those bruises would make it very painful.�

Ann was studying
me.� �Come over here.�� Her face was serious and I wasn�t sure what
she wanted, but I feared it wasn�t good.

I went to her side
of the bed.

�Face the
wall.�� She traced her fingernails across
my bottom.� �Boy, it�s really
swollen.�� I could hear her give Jeff a
kiss.� �I never knew how powerful you were,
honey.�� Ann then smacked my ass causing
me to jump from the sudden pain.� Even
though it wasn�t much of a hit, on top of the bruises, it really hurt.� They both laughed from my involuntary gasp
and jerking.� �Ah, does that hurt?�� Ann mocked.

�Yes, Mistress,� I
said, from between gritted teeth.

She smacked me
again, this time even harder.�
�Good.� Now pull up your pants and
go get Maria, she will be training you today.�

�Yes, Mistress,� I
said, trying to hold back tears from the pain and humiliation as I pulled up my
pants.

�Don�t forget to
drop to your knees and crawl out of here,� Jeff said.

I fell to my
knees.� �Wait, before you go.�� Ann slipped one leg out from underneath the
covers and held her foot out.� �Kiss and
thank me.�

I kissed the top
of her foot.

�Bottom too.�

I obeyed.

�Same
with Jeff.�

I crawled to the
other side and began kissing Jeff�s foot all over, his toes, the
sole of his foot.� It was so degrading to
have to turn my head under and put myself underneath him.� I truly felt at an absolute low.

�You like that,
slave?� Kissing my dirty, stinky feet?�

�Not really, Sir.�
����������� Jeff laughed.� �At least you�re honest.� Get out of here.� I�m sure you�ve got lots of work to do.�

�Yes,
Master.�� I crawled out of the room and
quickly ran downstairs to go get Maria. 

I pulled up in
front of Maria�s house and honked the horn.�
No one came out, so I got out of the car and went up to the door and
rang the bell.� After a few seconds, her
20-year-old son answered the door.� �I�m
here to pick up Maria.�

�Yeah,� he said
gruffly, �she�ll be out in a minute.� You
can wait here.� 

I stood on the
front step for an awkward minute, her son looking me up and down.� �Mom says you�re going to be working for her
now.�� He had a smile on her face.� �That makes her very happy.� You�d better do a good job or I�m going to
hunt you down and kick your ass big time, white boy.�� The young man had an evil grin on his face.� I had no doubt that he could easily
accomplish the task of beating me up.

I nodded my head
yes.

�Did you hear me?�

�Yes I heard.�

�Good�and I mean
it.�

�I believe
you.�� My life was beginning to be like I
had a sign on my neck, �please abuse me.�� Maria came to the door, her hair damp and she
looked harried.� In her hands she was
carrying her thick-sole black work shoes.�
She handed them to me.

�Put them on me.�

This was getting
out of hand.� �What?�� I was stunned at her request even though by
now nothing should have surprised me.

Her son answered
my confusion.� �She said to put her shoes
on, I wouldn�t argue if I were you.�� His
voice was dark menace.� Not only did I
have him to answer to, but if I had refused, I�m sure Maria would have reported
my insubordination to Ann.

�Hurry up, we�re
running late,� Maria snapped at me.

Red faced, knowing
there was little choice to refuse, I knelt down before
the older woman who was wearing pantyhose underneath her second-hand
dress.� I glanced at her toes and noticed
that, unlike Ann�s, were not manicured and in need of trimming.� I simply thankful at that moment that she
wasn�t making me kiss her stocking feet.�
I slipped on the shoe as I heard a car drive by.� What a sight I must have been for the
neighborhood, a Caucasian man kneeling and putting the shoes on a
domestic.� I tied the lace and slipped on
the other shoe and tied it.

�Too
tight.� Do it again!�

�Yes, Ma�am,� I
answered, retying her shoes.� Whether
they were really too tight or Maria was demonstrating her authority, I wasn�t
about to argue.� I wanted out of there as
soon as possible.

�Yeah, that�s what
I like�seeing the proper respect for my moms.�

�Yes, Carlos, he
knows his place,� Maria said before nudging my face with the toe of her
shoe.� �Lick my shoes, then
we can go.� I want them to shine.�

�Now wait a
minute.�� I began to sit up as this was
going too far.� It was one thing to be
humiliated and abused by Ann and Jeff, but this?� This was out of hand.� �I�m not���
Before I could finish my protest, I felt the leather of Carlos� shoe on
the back of my neck forcing my head down.

�Get down there,
white boy.� �Carlos then kicked my hard
into my ribs pushing air out of my lungs from the force of the painful
blow.� �Lick them, and do a good
job.�� Carlos kicked me again, I was
afraid he was going to break a rib.

�I am, I am,� I
cried out, quickly lowering my head, sticking out my tongue and lavishing the
dirty work shoes with my tongue.� Carlos
placed his foot into the middle of my back as I licked.� I could taste a mixture of leather, dirt and
specks of grime.� But at the moment, I
was so worried about being beaten by Carlos, that the disgusting nature of what
I was doing was overshadowed by the possibility of being beaten.� I spent about five minutes cleaning and
licking, my tongue feeling like it was coated with dirt, when I looked up and
said, �How is that, Miss Maria?�

She lifted up her
right foot and inspected the shoe.� �You
missed a spot on the heel.�

She put her foot
back down on the cement and I craned my neck to her heel and gave a thorough
licking.

�All right, that�s
enough.� Get up!�� Maria commanded with unexpected force.

As I began to
stand, Carlos kicked me hard in the butt.�
�You�d better not disappoint my moms.�
����������� �I won�t,� I said, as I
stumbled forward.

Unbelievably,
Maria reached over and slapped my face.�
�Show him respect, call him Sir.�

�I won�t
Sir.�� It was like she had lessons in how
to dominate.

Carlos just
grinned at me, an evil grin that portended nothing good.� �Sir�no one has ever called me that before.�

�Well he is.� And if I had more time, I would have him
clean your shoes too, my son.� Let him
show the respect our people deserve.�

�I like that,
moms, next time maybe.�

Maria gave her son
a kiss goodbye.� We started down the
sidewalk to the car.� �You will walk two
steps behind me like a servant.� If you
disobey me or disrespect me, I will have Carlos and his friends beat you to a
pulp.� Understand?�

�Yes Miss Maria.�

�It is now Diosa Maria, Spanish for Goddess.�

�Yes Diosa Maria, as you wish.�

I opened the door
and let her into my car.� She then had me
drive to a coffee shop and purchase her one of those flavored coffees that she
had seen so many of the housewives drink.�
Maria was flourishing in her role as my superior and I feared where it
could lead.� I planned on talking to Ann
about the situation before it got out of hand.�
I was aware that my talk might lead to further trouble, but I was hoping
that Ann would understand my concerns that Maria could harm me or interfere
with the proper time I needed to dedicate to serving the Moore
household.

We entered the
house and Maria began looking around to see what would be on the day�s
agenda.� Ann was at the kitchen table
drinking a cup of tea and talking on the phone as Maria instructed me to get
started on cleaning the counters and wiping down the cabinets.� I could see Ann with a satisfied smile as she
watched her maid taking command of the situation.� While I was cleaning the kitchen, Ann, still
on the phone, arrogantly snapped her fingers and pointed at her teacup and
saucer as an indication that she was finish with them.� It had already come to that, a snap of her
finger and I came running to do her bidding.�
She caught my eye as I removed the dishes while she was laughing about
something on the phone, I no longer saw the least bit of friendliness or
familiarity, I was nothing but a peon to her now.

After she finished
her conversation, she simply said, �Phone,� holding it out for me to run over
and take from her and then hang it up.�
She was writing on her pad and said nothing else to me as I cleaned.

Five minutes
later, Maria returned.� �Good morning,
Ann,� she said brightly.

Ann looked up and
smiled.� �Good morning, Maria, I see
you�ve got the servant working.�

�Yes, he is
learning.� Isn�t that right?�

�Yes Dioas Maria,� I answered.

Ann
quizzically at Maria.� �Dioas?�

�It means
goddess.�

Ann laughed.� �Very good Maria.� A natural I see.�

�Yes, like
yourself.�

Ann laughed even
more.� �You are very funny this morning.�

�Thank you.�

I had slowed
slightly in my cleaning as I listened.�
Of course, Ann had picked up on my slackened pace.� �Are you eavesdropping, slave?�

�No,
ma�am.�

�Mistress Ann!�

�No,
Mistress Ann�not exactly.�

�Come over here.�

I walked over next
to Ann who was sitting at the table next to the door leading out to the patio.

�Kneel�

I knelt on the
hardwood floors facing her.� I could see
anger in her eyes.� She slapped me across
my face.� �You will only pay attention to
what is necessary.�� She slapped me
again.� �Any conversation that is none of
your business, you will tune out.�� Another slap.�
�Understand?�� One more slap.

My face was
burning with the blows, Ann could deliver a sharp
slap.� �Yes, Mistress Ann, I apologize.�

�Write this down
in your punishment book.� Crawl over to
Maria and ask her to slap your ugly face.�
Tell her you are sorry and that you deserve to be punished.�

I did as I was
told.� �Please punish me Diosa Maria�I beg you to slap my face.�

�Ugly,� Ann
snapped.

�I beg you to slap
my ugly face.�

�With pleasure,�
Maria said, sneering down at me as she gave me a resounding slap which brought
a chortle out of Ann.

�Not
too hard, Maria.� We don�t want to
injure him.�

Maria nodded as
she gave me another slap, this time less hard, but smarting nonetheless.� Even with the brief blows, I could feel the
roughness of her hands, the slight calluses on her fingers.� She slapped me one more time as the phone
rang.� I didn�t have to be told to fetch
it and I quickly crawled over to where it was kept on the counter and quickly
ran back and handed it to Ann.� It was
Ann�s mom and they started chatting as Maria told me it was time to get started
cleaning the bathrooms.� The rest of the
morning was spent with my doing housework and being told what to do by
Maria.� Vacuuming, scrubbing and such,
Maria doing the laundry, pretty much everything else being left to me with
Maria showing up every fifteen minutes or so to yell and prod me to go
faster.� Finally at noon, Maria told me to get into the kitchen, as she and
Ann were ready for lunch.

I fixed sandwiches
for the pair like I had the previous day making sure to omit the tomato on Maria�s
lunch.� Ann and Maria sat at the table
and I served them their food.�� �So, is
Mike doing all right Maria?�

�He could do
better, but he�ll learn.�� Maria glared
at me while I picked up the kitchen and put away the food.

�Of course he�ll
learn.�� Ann grinned.� �Slave, show Maria what happens when you
don�t learn.�

�What?�

Ann was displeased
that she had to repeat herself as I wasn�t quite sure what she wanted.� �Drop your pants and show her what happens to
bad slaves.� You don�t mind, do you, Maria�seeing
him naked?�

�No,
Miss Ann, no problem.�

I had no choice, I unbuckled my trousers and dropped my pants then
pulled down my underwear.� I felt
humiliated and vulnerable as I stood in the kitchen with my pants down.

�As you can see,
Maria, how severely Mr. Moore had to beat him.�
I think the bruises are beautiful in their own way.� A way of marking Mike and
reminding him of what can happen.�

�Will I ever be
able to do that?�

Ann laughed.� �Of course.� When he needs discipline, I expect you to do
what is necessary.� I never realized that
you had such a streak in you, Maria.�

�Just
with him, Miss Moore.� He needs
it.�

�Yes, I think
you�re right, Maria, he does need it.� All right, Mike, enough of displaying your ugly ass.�� I pulled up my underwear and began to pull up
my pants.� �Wait,� Ann said.� �What are those bruises on your side?� Jeff didn�t hit you there.�

�Ahh�I don�t know.�

Maria stepped
in.� �I�m sorry,
Miss Ann, but my son kicked him there this morning.�

Ann was very
interested in this.� �What is this?�

�Tell her, Mike,�
Maria commanded.

�Maria told me to
polish her shoes this morning�with my tongue�and I�uh, didn�t move fast enough
for her son Carlos so he kicked me a couple of times.�

Ann chortled
between words.� �Oh my, slave, things
have been rough for you.� She made you
lick her shoes?�

Maria was looking
at her sandwich almost as if she was embarrassed as I continued my
confession.� �Yes, Mistress Ann, I had to
kneel on her front porch, in public, and lick her shoes.�� I was hoping that I would gather some
sympathy from Ann.� And I was relieved
that I wasn�t going to have to have a private talk with her

�Cool�Maria you
are something else.�� I could see Maria
now beaming with a perverse pride.� �This
is going to work out better than I could have ever imagined for all of us.� But you need to be careful with him, we don�t want to permanently harm him.� You�ve told me a little about your son and he
sounds like someone who could really harm him.�

�I�ll be careful.�

�What do you say,
slave?�
����������� �Thank you, Diosa Maria.�

Ann picked up her
plate.� �I�ve got some work to do in the
office.� Maria why
don�t you relax and finish your sandwich while Mike massages your feet.� I bet you could use that after working all
morning.�

I wanted to object
as I could imagine how rank Maria�s feet were.�
Even when I had put her shoes on in the morning I had a quick whiff of
the strong aroma of her feet.� Now, after
wearing her shoes all morning, it would only be worse.� �Yes, Miss Ann, that
would be nice.�

�Now, slave!�� Ann barked.

I pulled up my
pants and moved towards the table.� I
hesitated a moment as Maria had made no effort to move her feet from underneath
the table.� Ann noticed my hesitation.� �You�ll have to crawl underneath the
table.� You don�t expect Maria to discomfort
herself for your convenience do you?�

�No,
Mistress Ann, of course not.�� I
crawled underneath the kitchen table as Ann left the room.� I unlaced Maria�s shoes and slipped off her
right shoe.� I was greeted with a strong,
overwhelming odor; I did my best to ignore the smell as I almost retched from
the awful odor and took her stocking foot into my hands.� Her foot was moist and warm and I gently
began stroking her foot.� Her skin was
rough and callused and I thought that if I was going to be doing this regularly
that I should begin to take care of her feet so that in the future the task
would be less onerous.� I was scrunched
over and uncomfortable, wedged in between the table, its legs and the legs of
the chairs around the table.� 

�Take off my other
shoe, slave,� Maria commanded, �but keeping working on this foot.�� I removed her other shoe and she rested that
foot on my shoulder as I massaged.� She
shifted back into dining chair as she began to relax.� �This is good.� This I like.��
Maria took her resting foot and mashed her pungent foot into my
face.� �Smell good?� she asked as she
laughed and rubbed her sweaty foot all over my face.� �I wipe my stinky feet on you.� It feels good.�

It was immensely
humiliating to be used by this older woman as her foot wipe
and she was relishing the opportunity to make sure I received the full
treatment of being underneath her as she wiped her foot�slick with
perspiration�across my face.

�Kiss it.�� She pressed the callous ball of her feet onto
my lips and forced me to kiss her foot as I maintained my massage of the other
foot.� This went on for fifteen minutes,
rubbing one foot, kissing the other, as she occasionally bopped me in my face
with her foot.� Ann returned to the
kitchen.

�How is he doing?�

�He doing okay.�

�Good, feel free
to use him like this everyday at lunch.�
While you eat your sandwich, he can eat your toe jam and sweat which is
too good for him.� Isn�t that right,
slave?

�Yes, Mistress
Ann.�

�Yes,
what?�
����������� �Diosa
Maria�s toe jam and sweat are too good for me.�
I�m grateful she allows me to clean her feet with my tongue.�� I knew it was futile to resist, so I was
diving into my new status.

�Enjoy him for a
few more minutes, Maria, but then he should get his work done.�

�Yes, Ann, I
understand.�� She sighed loudly.� �It does feel good though.� 

Another ten
minutes passed before Maria finally said enough before roughly kicking me on
the side of the face and telling me to put her shoes back on.� When I had followed this command, she said,
�Lick them, I want to make sure they shine.�

I licked them for
a few minutes then she held up the bottom towards my face.� �Bottoms too.�
����������� �But, Diosa
Maria they are too dirty.�� I had to
protest this.

�Do I need to talk
to Ann?� You disobey, you in trouble.�

I weighed my odds.� I hoped that it would be hard for Ann to side
with Maria and I really didn�t want to clean the soiled soles of her
shoes.� �Please Maria?�� I decided to go for begging.� I looked up at her dark eyes magnified by her
thick glasses.� �Please?� 

She shook her head
no and touched my nose with the toe of her shoes.� �Lick.�

I stuck out my
tongue and began to lick, dirt and grit soon caked my
tongue as I cleaned her shoes.� Another
five minutes of this degradation followed before she relented and told me to go
clean the bathrooms.� The taste on my
tongue and in my mouth was nothing like I had ever known.� A dirty sourness and discomfort from the
dryness and friction on my tongue.� I
wanted water and mouthwash but knew I would be receiving neither.� As I crawled out from underneath the table I
not only saw Maria�s shoes, but the bare feet of Ann standing above.

�How was that,
slave?�

�It was fine,
Mistress.�

�Show me your
tongue.�

I stuck out my
tongue.� Ann put her foot underneath my
chin and lifted my head up as she giggled.�
�That�s disgusting, it�s all dirty.�
����������� �Diosa
Maria had me lick the bottom of her shoe.�

�You�ll do
anything you are told won�t you?�
����������� �I guess.�

�Look at you,
you�re disgusting.� Kneeling on the
floor, my foot underneath your chin looking at a your
filthy tongue coated with the dirt and slime from the street.� How low will you sink?�

I thought the
question was rhetorical.

�I asked you a
question slave,� Ann snapped.

�Uh, I don�t know,
Mistress.�

�I bet you
don�t.� I was so right about you, about
how you are weak and pitiful.� What would
Joann say if she saw you now?�

A wave of panic
struck me as I imagined Ann having my ex-wife ready to walk in.� �I don�t know, Mistress Ann.�� My voice was resignedly dejected.

�She would see
what you really are.� And
your son.� Your
parents.� Your
former coworkers.�

Ann was hitting
deep.

�They would all
see that you are nothing but a spineless foot-licking lackey.� What would Audrey and Phillipe
think right now?�

Audrey and Phillipe were a couple we used to
often socialize with when I was married along with Ann and Jeff.� �It would be very embarrassing if they knew,�
I muttered.

�I have a good
mind to invite them over tonight for drinks and dinner.�

�Please don�t
Mistress.�

�Are you telling
me what to do?�

�No, Mistress, I�m
simply begging you not to invite them.� I
don�t know if I could bear that humiliation.�

Ann lifted my chin
higher with her bare foot.� �Look at me,
Mike.�

I looked into her
eyes staring down at me.

�You must face the
fact that many others will see that you work for us now.�

�Yes, I know�but.�

Ann quickly
reached down and slapped me viciously.�
�Did I say you could talk?�

�No,
Mistress.� I apologize, Mistress.�

�You will work and
serve whomever I say.� My entire
family�who I graciously allowed you and your family to spend holidays and other
time with�will know you as our employee now, maybe even learn of your slave
status.� Everyone you come into contact
with you can assume as your superior, including the maid.� Understand?�

�Yes,
Mistress?�

�You may talk.�

�But can�t it be
kept at a respectable level?�

�What do you
mean?� As in respecting
you?�

�Something like that.�

Ann started
laughing, her chortles humiliating.� �Yeah right,� her voice dripping with sarcasm.� �Just do what your
told and don�t worry about others, slave.��
She withdrew her foot letting my chin drop.� �Get back to work.�

I spent the rest
of the afternoon working hard, cleaning the house, pulling weeds in the yard
eventually escorting Maria home with little incident.� I also got a break from the Moore
kids, Jordan
going over to a friend�s house, Nicole playing tennis on the high school
team.� Alone with my thoughts, I kept
thinking of the ungodly potential humiliation of former friends or even my son
witnessing my new status.� Each time the
phone rang, I kept imagining Ann inviting someone we knew over to witness my
descent into servitude.� Also, as the day
wore on, I grew more anxious knowing that Jeff would soon be home and I would
be facing that humiliation of having to work and serve him.

Ann sometimes
liked to cook and that evening she was preparing dinner when Jeff arrived home
earlier than usual, even arriving home before the children.� I was assisting her by cleaning dishes and
fetching things as she barked out orders between talking on the phone, even as
she was preparing dinner.� One phone call
was from Audrey and Ann made me squirm as she talked to our mutual friend.� Of course I only heard her side of the
conversation, but it was more than enough.

�Did I tell you
that Mike works for us now.� Things were tight, he needed a job and we
decided he might be useful.� I couldn�t
believe it when he accepted it either.�
Yeah well, television is a tough business right now. Laughing.� True, probably not as nearly as tough as I
am...I only expect perfection.� What does
he do?� Whatever we tell him.� Yes, well, I�m not the one who got myself into this situation.�
Yes, it can be a little awkward, but he�s fitting in just fine and is
quickly learning how to do things the Moore
way.�

They finally moved
onto other conversation rather than about me, talking about their daughters as
Audrey also had an eighteen-year-old daughter.�
I was almost enjoying the moment helping Ann cook, being close to her and
she was being reasonably civil to me. �She was curt with the orders, but nothing too
overwhelming.� Unfortunately, Jeff came
through the door and yelled out for me.

�Mike, where are
you?�� 

I ran back to the
laundry room that connected to the garage.�
�Right here, Sir,� I said as he entered the house.� �I was helping Ann prepare dinner, Sir.�

Jeff raised an
eyebrow.� �Ann?�

�Sorry,
Sir, Mistress Ann.�

�Add it to your
book.�� 

�Yes,
Sir.�

For a moment I was
confused as Jeff was standing in the doorway between the garage and laundry
instead of entering.� �Are you forgetting
something?�

�Sir?�

Jeff pointed
towards the ground and I suddenly realized that he was still wearing his
shoes.� �You don�t expect me to remove my
own shoes do you?�

Well, yes I did, I
should say, I used to have that thought, now I shouldn�t expect it I
guess.�� �No, Sir, of
course not.�� I sunk to my knees
and reached for his tasseled loafer.

�Wait.�

I looked up.� �Yes, Sir?�

�Clean it
first�with your tongue.� I hear you
already have a lot of experience with that.�

�Yes,
Sir.� �Ann must had
told him about Maria.� Immediately I
leaned over and began licking the soft leather of his shoe.� I don�t know which was worse, cleaning the
maid�s dirty work shoes, or suffering the indignity of lapping at the feet of
the arrogant man who I had once considered a friend�and an equal.� The taste of leather flooded my mouth and it
wasn�t as bad as the dirt from Maria�s shoes or the acrid taste of her
feet.� But still, licking the shoes of
another man, this was still amazingly humiliating.� Ann strolled in to see what was going on.

�I thought I heard
you.�

As I polished
Jeff�s shoes, Ann walked up and gave her husband a kiss, standing on my hand as
she embraced him, neither one acknowledging my presence or the fact she was
standing on me.� �How was your day?�

�It was good.� Got out early, but have to make some calls
tonight.� What about you?�

�It was good.�

�And our slave�how
did he do?�

�Adequate.�� Ann laughed.�
�Maria put him through the ringer, making him lick her shoes on the
porch of her house, then at lunch, he kissed and
massaged her feet.� God, they smelled
bad, I had to stay in the office while he did that.�

Jeff was
laughing.� �Ah, did our poor little slave
boy enjoy that?�

�Not really, Sir,�
I said between licks.

�Who cares.�

Ann gave Jeff
another long kiss.� �Got
to finish din-din.� The kids
should be home any minute.� 

Ann left the
room.� �Stop.�� Jeff held each shoe up for inspection.� �Not bad.�
I�ll expect this everyday before and after work, a man�s shoes reflect
on how he carries himself and I expect mine to be spotless and shining
brightly.�

�Yes,
Sir.�

�You hear me
coming home, you be on your knees and waiting in the garage for now on,
slave!�� Jeff�s voice rose in anger.� �I have a good mind to beat your ass right
now.�� He had momentarily seemed
pleasant, but as he spoke, I sensed his anger growing.

�Please, Sir��
����������� �Please Sir what?�

�Please don�t beat
me.� I�m so bruised.�

�You sound
pathetic, you know that.�

�Yes,
Sir.�

�What are you?�

�Pathetic,
Sir.�

�Removed
my shoes.�

I slipped off his
loafers, the aroma nearing that of Maria�s strong smell.

�Kiss my feet and
then put my shoes in the closet in the garage.�

�Yes,
Sir.�� I kissed his socked feet
and then crawled out into the garage as he went into the house.� Quickly putting the shoes into the proper
space, I walked quickly back into the house and returned to the kitchen just as
the front door opened with Nicole and Jordan returning at the same time as
Nicole had picked up her brother after practice and driven him home.� To say that Nicole and Jordan were the
spoiled royalty of the neighborhood would have been an understatement, though
both were highly successful in school and worked hard, they also enjoyed the
fruits of Jeff�s labor, lots of clothes, the latest electronics, and in
particular, the matching BMW convertibles that they each normally drove,
Jordan�s being serviced at the moment.

�Mom, we�re home,�
Jordan yelled.

�Where�s Mike?�
Nicole yelled.

�Go see what they
want.� Jeff commanded as he snuggled up behind Ann and hugged her as she
finished the last bit of fixing dinner.

�Perfect timing,�
she said as he nuzzled her neck.

I ran to the front
door where both kids were sitting on a small loveseat that was near the
entrance.� Nicole was in her tennis
outfit�shorts, polo shirt, socks and tennis shoes, Jordan wearing jeans, Tshirt and sneakers he had worn to school.� �Did you want me Miss Nicole?�

�Yes, stupid, you
need to remove our shoes.�

I couldn�t believe
she felt so comfortable calling me stupid and telling me to take off her shoes,
it seemed the entire Moore
household was made up of demanding dominants.�
�Of course,� I said, starting to bend over to remove their shoes.

�Kneel,
idiot.� And hurry up,
we don�t have all fucking day!� Nicole snapped impatiently causing Jordan
to laugh.

�You�re a bitch,
you know that, sis?�

�Thank you,
brother.� I know I am.� Poor Mike here is going to find out just how
much.�

�I�m sure he
will.�

I knelt on the
hard floor and quickly unlaced Nicole�s shoes and took them off.

�Smell good?� she said,
pressing her moist socked foot into my face, �I�ve been playing tennis all
afternoon.� I bet they smell real
pretty.�

They were pungent,
but nothing like her father or Maria�s feet, plus it didn�t hurt that she was
so cute, but it was still humiliating to have the girl sticking her foot in my
face.� Jordan
followed his sister�s lead and did the same after I removed his shoes, this
time a male foot that had been in sneakers all day, the smell approaching that
of the Maria�s feet.� �Kiss it, pig,� he
said, �I know that�s what you do.�

I didn�t have the
strength to protest, and kissed the boy�s feet.

They both then
strolled away as I rushed the pair of shoes to the garage then returned to the
kitchen, Nicole�s dirty socks in my back pocket until I could put them in the
laundry later.� The family sat down at
the dinner table and was talking among themselves as Ann dished up the food,
then told me to serve them.� I gave
everyone their plates, filled drink orders and waited upon them.� Of course there was no please or thank you,
just get me this, get me that, otherwise ignoring me as they talked about
school, how tennis was going, etc.�
Mundane dinner conversation everything seemed perfectly normal except
that I was now, let�s face it, now I was their slave.� The conversation veered into new territory
when Nicole mentioned that she had seen my son, Jonathon, at the country club
where he worked and she played tennis.

I kept my head
bowed and tried not to react, but I definitely had my ears on as Nicole
talked.� �It was kind of weird seeing
him.� I remember how I used to treat him
like shit in school and he put up with it.�
Now, I think I understand.��
Nicole was staring at me.

Jordan
snickered.� �We used to pick on him
to.� I kicked the crap out of him one day
in the gym locker room.� He was such a
pussy.�

I wanted to defend
my son, but knew it would be near impossible in this room.

�He�d almost be in
tears begging me not to hurt him.� Please
Jordan,� Jordan
mocked in my son�s voice �don�t hurt me�I thought we were friends.�

�Friends?�
Nicole exclaimed incredulously.� �He had
the nerve to think we were friends?�

I wanted to
interject that the three had known each other since grade school, but I
remained silent, stewing in the wimpy silence of my own and my son�s disgrace.� Jeff picked up on my state of conflict.

�What do you
think, Mike?� Is Jonathon a friend of
Nicole�s and Jordan�s?�

�I wouldn�t know,
Sir.�

�I can tell you
right now, he�s not,� Nicole snapped.�
�Get me another grape leave.�� I
hurried and served Nicole some more of the dinner Ann had prepared as they
continued talking.� �Instead of a friend,
I think more of him as being a piece of shit.��
I glanced at Nicole, then the rest of the family, they were all waiting
for my defiance.

�Language,
darling,� Ann gently admonished her daughter as I readied my defense.

�That�s not really
nice, Miss Nicole.� Jonathon liked both
of you.�

�That�s not really
nice,� Nicole mocked repeating my pitiful voice, �I would never claim to be
nice.� Nice is for losers�like Jonathon.�

�Go back to
minding your own business, Mike,� Ann said.

�Yes,
Ma�am.�

I started cleaning
the kitchen as the conversation continued.�
�I remember that one time when Frank stuck Jonathon�s head in the toilet
and flushed it.� It was hysterical as he
yelled, help I�m drowning, help.�

�Can you imagine
drowning in a toilet,� Nicole said laughing.

They all were
smiling or laughing by now and I could feel myself turn red despite my best
attempts to appear not to be listening.�
As usual, Ann picked up the change.�
�Mike, you aren�t listening to the details of our conversation were
you?�

�Uh�uh�� I didn�t
know what to say.

�You know that
servants aren�t privy to private conversations of their employers.�

�Yes, I know,
Ma�am.�

�Hhm, because if you were listening then that means you
disobeyed my orders.� Did you do
that Mike?�

�Well, I might
have heard something, but not purposely�I was just trying to be aware if you
needed anything.�� I�m sure everyone was
enjoying watching me squirm.� Yes, it was
impossible not to hear the conversation; after all, I had to be able to respond
to their commands.� But I also understood
Ann�s point.� �I mean�I�

�Tell us what you
mean, Mike,� Ann said smugly.

�I�I understand
that anything that I hear is as if I didn�t hear it.� I mean, I listen so I can hear your
commands.�

Ann was immensely
enjoying my quandary.� �Maybe we should
remove your ears.�� She and the rest
started laughing.

�And his tongue so
he can�t talk back,� Nicole added.

I was
mortified.� Jeff stepped in.� �Don�t worry, Mike, we�re just joking
around.�

Ann wasn�t going
to be so easy.� �Well, he�s not supposed
to be listening in on our conversations,� she said angrily.

Unbelievably Jeff
was defending me.� �He does have to
listen for our instructions.��� Let�s
face it, he�s not exactly got it going on and he needs our explicit guidance.�

�True, but still,
that would be directly disobeying me.�

�Then, maybe I
should fire him.� Mike, you�re fired.�

I couldn�t believe
it.� Fired?� After everything I had already been through,
firing didn�t even seem a possibility.

�Dad, you can�t
fire him.� I have plans for him,� Nicole
said, ominously.

�We all do, dear,�
Jeff said.� He was smiling and I realized
that he was kidding around.� �Mike is
going nowhere�fast.� With all the demerits
he is earning, he�ll owe us money in the end.�

�Like an
indentured servant,� Jordan
added.� �I remember that crap from
school.�

�But, Sir��

Jeff lost his
casual manner.� �Sir
what?�� Jeff startled me with his
abrupt anger.

�Nothing
Sir.�

�Good.� I don�t want to hear anything negative from
you, Mike.� You WILL be punished for
disobeying Ann whether it is unfair or not.�
Fair is no longer in your vocabulary.�
And Sunday, we will have a family meeting to go over the rules of the
household for you, what is expected, and how you should anticipate being
treated.� Ann and I need to have further
discussion on this or I would do it tonight.�
Right now, I want you to go into my office and wait for me.� You can clean this up later.�

�Yes,
Sir.�� As I was walking towards
the office, I could hear the twins eagerly questioning their father what he was
going to do to me.� But I didn�t hear his
answer.� I didn�t know which was
worse�knowing or not knowing.

It was another ten
or fifteen minutes before the door to the office opened, but it wasn�t Jeff, it
was Nicole.� I had decided it was best to
kneel as I waited, and when I saw Nicole, I was embarrassed and began to
stand.� 

�Don�t bother,�
she said dismissively, signaling that I was to remain kneeling.� �That�s the best position for you.� On your knees, serving my
family.� You are a loser with a
capital L, aren�t you?�

�Yes, Miss
Nicole.�

�Yes, Miss
Nicole,� she mocked me in a sing-song voice.�
�Not only a loser, but a wimp.� I
know my dad whipped your ass last night and I hope he does it again.� Every night.� I can�t wait until I get my chance to do the
same.�

�Uh, maybe they
won�t let you, Miss Nicole.�

She laughed
more.� �In your dreams,
loser.� I have no doubt I�ll be
kicking your butt in no time�making your kiss my feet, run my errands.� Wait until my friends get a look at you.� I bet you�ll want to kiss my boyfriend�s feet
too.�

Not on your
life.� �No, Miss Nicole I wouldn�t.�

�Are you arguing
with me?�

�No, Miss Nicole,
just being truthful.�

�Yeah, I doubt it,
loser toe sucker.�

Jeff finally
entered the office and walked over and stood in front of me.� �Nicole, what are you doing?�

�Nothing.�� She smiled at her dad.

�I bet.�� I need you to leave.�

�Can�t I watch?�

�There�s nothing
to watch.�

�Are you going to
beat his ass again?�

�Nicole��

�All
right, but sometime I wanna watch.�

�We�ll talk about
it later.�

Nicole finally
relented and started to leave.� �Have
fun, Mikey.�

Jeff watched her
leave and was shaking his head as he said, �She is something else.� I like that you�re on your knees.� Nicole tell you to
do that?�

�No, Sir, I did it
myself.�� I couldn�t bear to look at Jeff
and kept my head down.

�Head down,
kneeling at my feet.� Wow, how the mighty
have fallen.� I remember when you used to
think you were pretty hot shit because of your Hollywood
job.� Is that the way you used to get
work?� Get down on your knees and beg for
a job?�� Jeff grinned at me.

�No, Sir.�

�Whatever.�� Jeff sat down at the desk.� �Right now you�re going to be my
secretary.� You�d better not fuck
up.� We�ll start easy.� Get Sanborn on the phone.� And make sure you call yourself my secretary,
not my assistant.�

�Yes,
Sir.�� Mark Sanborn was one of
Jeff�s best friends and work colleague.�
We had met socially over the years and I was sure it was Jeff�s method
of further humiliating me.� Still on my
knees, I dialed the phone number that Jeff had written down for me.� �Mark Sanborn, please.� Mr. Sanborn, this is Jeff Moore�s secretary,
please hold for Mr. Moore.�� I was
calling Mark�s house so the formality was a little silly, but Jeff was getting
a kick out of it.� Before I could hand
over the phone, Mark started having a little fun of his own.

�I didn�t know
that Jeff had a secretary.� How long have
you been working for Mr. Moore?�

�Just
a few days, Sir.�

�I see.� And as his personal secretary, do you do
anything particularly personal for him?�

�I�m not exactly
sure what you mean, Sir.�

����������� �Oh,
I have a feeling that you do, Mike, you little pussy.�� He told me about how you go running around
and doing everything you�re told and how he blistered
your ass last night and how you like to kiss his feet.�

����������� �It�s
not that I like it��

����������� �Are
you arguing with me?�

����������� �No,
Sir.�

�You�d better not
be.� Give your Master the phone, pussy.�

I handed the phone
to Jeff and heard another one-sided conversation.� �Yeah, he�s still here.� Sure, you can use him too.� Yeah, we�ll have our fun.� So what do you think about the Peterson
account?�� For the next thirty minutes
Jeff and Mark discussed business.� After
the first five minutes, Jeff prodded me with his foot and told me to rub, so
after removing his socks, I spent the time he was on the phone massaging his
feet.� He tilted back in his leather
chair, propped one foot onto my shoulder as I massaged the other one.

About halfway into
his conversation, Nicole knocked at the door and Jeff had told her to come
in.� She had a question and walked over
to the desk where I remained in position massaging his feet while his daughter
received help from her father.� Not once
did he address the situation that there I was with his foot on my shoulder as I
rubbed the other one as he laid back in his chair like
he was a king.� Nicole simply glanced
down at me with disdain, but said nothing.�
It was almost as if it was natural that I was doing this for her
father.� 

Jeff finally hung
up the phone with Mark.� �You do that
pretty well, slave.�

�Thank you, Sir.�

�How did it feel
talking to Mark as my secretary.�

�Embarrassing,
Sir.�

Jeff
snickered.� �I bet.� He and Betsy will be coming over this weekend.� Maybe I�ll have you rub their feet.�

�Understand, Sir.�

�And maybe since
you�re such a pussy, I�ll have you wear a dress.� The only reason I might not is because of the
kids.�

�Please, Sir, I
don�t want to wear a dress.�

�I bet you
don�t.� And I bet you don�t want to be
rubbing my feet, or licking the maid�s feet or cleaning our toilets.� But you do it, don�t you, you know what you
are.�

�Yes, Sir, I know
what I am.�

�And that is?�

�Your slave,
Sir.� Your pussy slave, Sir.�

�Very good,
Mike.� At least you have a talent for
knowing what you are.�

Just then Ann
entered the office and walked over to the desk and sat down on the edge,
dangling her legs over, her feet inches from me.� �How�s it going?�

�Not bad.� Just trying to resolve a few problems.� What are the kids up to?�

�Working on their
homework.� What did Mark think of your
new secretary?�

Ann and Jeff must
have talked about this.� 

�Just laughed,
said he wanted to have a little fun of his own.�

�Which they will
this weekend.� Won�t that be great Mike?� Waiting upon old friends?�

�Yes Mistress.�

�You aren�t lying
to me, are you?�

�Well��

�Mike, that�s one
thing we won�t tolerate.�� Ann was
shaking her head in dismay and I felt like I was in genuine trouble.�� �Have you decided what to do with the liar?�

I began to
object.� �I�m not a li��

�Shut up!� Ann
snapped.� �You�ll speak when spoken to.�

�Yes, Mistress.�

�Since you said
you�re not a liar, I want you to call Mark and tell him how excited you are to
be serving him this weekend.� I want you
to tell him that he should regard you as nothing more than a slave and treat
you as such.� After all, you said it
would be great to be waiting upon them.��
Jeff had a beaming smile on his face as Ann gave me my
instructions.� �Do you think he�ll be
alright with this?� she asked her husband.

�I think Mark will
be amused.� Call him.�

Nervous, I dialed
Mark�s number hoping that the call would be brief.� �Hello, Mark, this is Mike,�
����������� �Tell him my secretary,� Jeff
said, kicking me in the ribs.

��Jeff�s
secretary.�

�Yeah, what?� Mr. Moore wants to talk to me some more?�

�No Sir, I uh,
just wanted to say I look forward to seeing you this weekend.�

�That�s what
you�re bothering me about?�� Mark was
displeased.

�No, uh, I wanted
to tell you that I want you to treat me like your�your slave and I�m eager to
do whatever I can for you.�

Mark started
laughing.� �Oh is that what you want?�

�Well uh, Sir,
just wanted to know that it will be great to see you.�

�We�ll see about
that�slave I guess it is.�

�Yes Sir.�

�Anything else?�

�Uh no.�� Click.�
Mark simply hung up on me.

�What did he say?�
Jeff asked.

�Not much, just
that we�ll see about how much I like seeing him as he laughed.�� I was relieved that Mark had been easy on me
though I doubted the weekend would go as smooth.

�Oh yeah, you
think I�m arrogant,� Jeff said.� �All
right, what were we talking about?�

�Mike�s
punishment.�� Ann was now resting her
feet on my shoulders, Mike had his legs crossed, a foot inches away from my
face.� Ann began flicking her finger
against my head, it was very irritating, but I knew better than to say
anything, I accepted her subtle punishment.

�I don�t know, his
ass is such a mess that I�m afraid I would do serious damage if I were to beat
him again.�

�Yes, we�ll wait
until the weekend to work on that,� Ann said.�
�Betsy seemed curious about it, though she doesn�t seem like the
sadistic type.�� There was a moment of
silence as the two considered what to do with me.� I looked at the clock and realized it was
almost nine, I had forgotten any notion of having a normal job or normal hours.

Once again as if
reading my mind, Ann said, �I bet you would like to go home now, wouldn�t you?�

�Yes, Mistress, I
am very tired.�

�You know, since
money is so tight for you, it�s probably best you become a live-in of some
sort.� Depending on what we need or how
we feel, you can sleep at the foot of the bed, in the closet or in the garage.�

Garage?

Ann giggled, �Or
outside, like in a dog house, particularly when he misbehaves.�

�Wow, that�s
wicked.� Love it.�� Jeff looked at Ann with a mixture of love and
lust.� �Okay, before I finish up with
work, it�s time to get Mike�s punishment over with.� Mike, crawl over and lock the office door.�

I could feel sweat
start to build upon me as I crawled over and did as told.� What was Jeff up to?� As I crawled back, he told me to strip off my
clothes.� Within a few seconds, I was
naked and kneeling before the couple who were chatting as if nothing was abnormal.� They made me wait a moment as they discussed
what they wanted to have for dinner during Mark and Betsy�s visit.� Finally I was told to stand and put my hands
behind my neck.

�All right, slave,
keep those hands laced behind your neck no matter what,� Jeff warned.� �Face Ann.�

I turned and faced
Ann who was still sitting on the edge of the desk, her legs dangling as she
began to lecture me.� �You doing a little
better, but I�m still not comfortable with you being intimate with everything
in my life.�� She sighed loudly.� �But I suppose that is an adjustment I need
to make, eventually I�m sure I�ll see you as nothing but an object, like an
appliance to make our lives easier and better and I won�t worry about what you
do or don�t hear.�

�Yes, Mistress.�

�But in the
meantime�� All of a sudden, Ann gave me a swift kick straight to my testicles,
it wasn�t real hard, then again, it need not be.� �I�ll expect nothing less the one-hundred per
cent from you.�

My knees had
buckled and I gasped for breath as a sickly feeling overwhelmed me.� Somehow, I managed to keep my fingers behind
my head.

�Stand up
straight!�� As soon as I stood up, she
kicked me again as in involuntary loud groan came from me and I hunched over in
agony as the couple laughed at my misery.

�What�s the
matter, Mike?� Something bothering you?�
Jeff asked with glee.

�Please��

�Oh, you want
another one?�� Ann kicked me once more
even before I could stand straight.� This
one sent me to the floor like a pile of rags at their feet and I lost the grip
behind my head.

I couldn�t see
straight or think, the pain was blinding and I feared I was going to
vomit.� �Stand up, slave,� Jeff said
through the murk of pain.

I stood back up as
Ann made feigning motions like she was going to kick me again.� I jerked back involuntarily as they laughed
at my reaction.� �Hold still, dumbshit,� Ann said between guffaws.� �You are disobeying me.�

Tears were running
down my face and I was gasping for air.�
Ann looked at me without an ounce of pity and the next thing I knew Jeff
reached out and slapped my balls hard.�
Again, I went down from the agonizing pain.� This time Jeff stood up and pushed me over
onto my back with his foot, then planted it square in my chest and held me
down, the victor standing over the defeated.�
Ann reveled in the sight.� �That
looks great.�� She slipped off the desk
and then stood with full weight on my chest and stomach as she embraced Jeff
for balance and to be able to share a few kisses.

I was now like a
carpet, Jeff resting a foot on my chest, Ann feet planted on chest and stomach
as I struggled to breathe and I could feel my face turning red from the
pressure as they made out.� �I can�t wait
until bedtime,� Jeff said, his voice deep with lust.� �What do we do with him?�

�He can sleep in
the garage tonight.� There are some old
blankets in the trunk of your car.�� Ann
stepped off of my as air gushed out of my body.�
�I�m going to see what the kids are doing.�

As she headed to
the door, I remained flat on my back as Jeff then put his foot on my neck and
pressed down.� �Whose mercy are you at
now?�

�Yours, Master,� I
choked out.

Just before she
left, Ann said, �Don�t kill him, honey.�

�I won�t.�

As I felt the
pressure from Jeff�s foot on my throat, he had me scared that he might harm
me.� He pressed harder.� �You�d better never disobey me, slave.�
����������� �I won�t, Sir,� I gurgled out.

�Good.�� He released my throat as I gulped for
air.� He held the same foot over my
face.� �Kiss.�

I craned upward
like doing a half sit up and kissed the sole of his foot.

�Stay there.�

My lips remained
pressed against his foot, my stomach tightening and burning from the muscle
strain of staying in place.� I felt
myself begin to shake as the seconds passed.

�If you stop
before I tell you too, you get five more kicks.�
����������� I nodded and began to
disassociate from the stomach burn as I feared the kicks more than the current
hurt, though I knew that muscle failure would eventually happen.� He held his foot higher and I struggled to
keep my mouth against the sole of his foot.�
Now, my stomach was really starting to burn, my muscles were shaking and
I knew it was almost over; Jeff was having no mercy and glowered down upon me
as I struggled.� �Please�� I managed to
gasp as sweat formed on my body.� My
muscles finally gave out and I collapsed to the floor.

����������� �Looks
like someone is in for a ball kicking.�

����������� �Please,
Sir, I tried as hard as I could.�� I
could hardly move my stomach was so fried.�
I knew that tomorrow I would be extremely sore, stomach and testicles
paying the price.

����������� �Not
good enough.� Spread your legs.�

����������� I
spread but instinctively started to reach down to cover myself.

����������� �Put
your hands behind your neck.�

����������� �Please�what
can I do?�

����������� �Shut
up.�� Jeff was standing between my legs.

����������� �Sir�please�.please��

I could see that
Jeff was enjoying my pleading.� �Try not
to scream too loud.�� 

The next thirty
seconds were the most agonizing of my life as he gave me five quick kicks in
succession to my balls.� I was yelling,
twisting and turning like I was having seizures as my mind turned white and
blank with the pain.� Sweating and
gasping, it didn�t last long, but the toll was large and I hoped I never had to
face such agony again, though with the Moore
family�s sadistic tendencies, that was unlikely.� When I finally regained some resemblance of
composure, I saw Jeff looking down at me, arms folded across his chest, with
smug complacency at what he had done to me.�
�That�s lesson number two of what can happen if you displease any of
us.�� I nodded my head.� �You go out into the garage and make yourself
a bed on the floor, there are some blankets in the trunk of my car.� I expect breakfast just like this morning and
every morning.� In the morning, you
quietly crawl into the bedroom, go to the end of the bed and gently pull up and
sheets and begin kissing and lightly sucking our toes to wake us.� You will do this until you receive a kick to
the face.� Then you will serve us
breakfast.� After that, you will gently
knock on the kid�s doors and quietly tell them it is morning and time to get up
and ask how you may please them.� Do not
go into their rooms without permission.�
You do so, and this will seem like happy camp.�

�Yes, Sir, I
understand.�

�Good, now get
your ugly face out of my sight.�

I quickly left the
office, and tiptoed out into the garage.�
The house was eerily quiet and I�m sure the kids had an earful of my
yelling from the pain.� Jeff must have
done this purposefully or he would have gagged me.� Entering the garage I was struck at the chill
of the area.� I found the musty, dirty
blankets from the back of the car and made the best bed I could to keep myself
warm and give me a little padding from the hard garage floor.� It would be another fitful night of sleep as
I was chilled, uncomfortable and sore from the past two day�s of work and
punishment.

PART
THREE

&nbsp;

The next couple of days passed
relatively uneventfully.� I did my usual
chores, was scolded and had a few humiliations, but nothing major.� It was as if everything was being saved for
the weekend.� Even the twins had little
to say, just a comment or two about my seeming to have had some kind of
accident in the office since they heard my screaming.� I spent two more nights on the hard, cold
garage floor, but was so tired from all the menial work that I was able to get
some sleep.� Waking up early on Saturday,
I was filled with dread for the arrival of the guests.� The kids were being farmed out to the friends
and I sensed the Jeff and Ann were as anxious as I was for the arrival of their
friends, only their anxiousness and my anxiousness were for entirely different
reasons.

����������� I
spent the day, as usual, cleaning and preparing the house for the arrival of
the guests.� Jeff and Ann were in and out
of the house, doing what, I didn�t know, but I was too busy to even give it
much thought.� Ann had thought about
cooking for her friends, or having me prepare the food, but decided to have it
catered instead, preferring the ease of the
prepackaged, and allowing me to concentrate on other aspects of attending to
their needs, as she put it.� It was also
interesting how playful and flirty Ann and Jeff were, kissing and smooching
since they didn�t have to worry about the kids.�
When 4 p.m. rolled around and Jeff ordered me to fix a pitcher of
martinis for them, I felt as anxious as a boy on his first date and I got a
sense that Jeff and Ann were also anxious to share their new servant and see
their reaction to me.� Jeff and Ann had
sat on the couch as I poured their drinks into a martini glass, put them on a
tray and carried them over to them, kneeling down as I offered them their
drinks.� They were both dressed
casually�it wasn�t so much a party, but friends getting together�shorts, polo
shirt for Jeff, blouse for Ann.� They
kissed for a few minutes I knelt, head bowed, tray held conveniently for when
they decided to pick them up.

����������� �I
think our servant boy has something for us,� Ann noted between kisses.

����������� �He
can wait.� I�m getting so fucking hot, maybe we should go have a quick one.�

����������� I
took a quick glance up and saw that Ann was rubbing Jeff�s cock through his
shorts and he had a couple of buttons undone on her blouse and was playing with
her breasts as they continued to neck.� I
felt jealous, yet excited as I knelt there and felt the glance was worth the
risk of being caught looking at them.�
Finally, they broke apart, laid back on the sofa, both simultaneously
sighing with mutual pleasure.

����������� �Drinks,�
Jeff snapped and I held the tray up closer for them to retrieve their
glasses.� They took their martinis and
sipped as I knelt with head bowed staring at Ann�s beautiful pink toes.� But instead of getting to kiss her gorgeous
feet, Jeff gave me the command to worship his feet.

����������� I
leaned over and began the task of kissing his feet by kissing the top of his
foot, then sort of moving down and kissing the top of his toes, trying to avoid
going too far on his feet which retained their masculine smell.

����������� �How
hot is this?� Your former friend is down
there kissing your feet while you and I make out like queen and king,� Ann
marveled.

����������� �We
are the rulers of the Moore castle,
babes.� Suck my toes, shithead,�
Jeff barked.� �To Mike, we rule.� Isn�t that right, Mike?�

����������� �Yes,
Master, absolutely,� I mumbled as I sucked on Jeff�s big toe.

����������� �Make
sure you run your tongue between my toes, clean them, make
your Master feel good.�

����������� I
nodded my head and did as he told, cleaning between his toes, sucking and
nibbling as I went.� They had been
walking around barefooted for most of the day and I noticed that their feet
were somewhat dirty.� I could hear them
kissing and moaning as I attended to Master Jeff; after a couple of minutes,
Ann said, �Slave, keep sucking, but look up here.�

����������� I
tilted my head upward as I licked Jeff�s toes and I was nearly shocked to see
that Ann was stroking his cock with her hand.�
Jeff was fully erect and sticking out of the fly of his shorts, I had to
admit not only was the brazen display of Jeff�s penis surprising, I could see
the power and lust in Ann�s eyes as she rubbed her man; I also couldn�t believe
how large Jeff�s member was:� not
enormous or anything, but a good size. 

����������� �Isn�t
it beautiful?� Ann said,
her voice masked with lust.

����������� �Yes,
Mistress,� I agreed.

����������� She
leaned over and gave the shaft of his penis a long lick as Jeff moaned with
pleasure.� I also was fully erect at the
display of eroticism, Ann was no longer a soccer mom, she was freaking hot
sexual animal.

����������� �Baby,
that feels so good,� Jeff managed to say.

����������� �I
can�t tell how much it turns me on to watch you getting your toes sucked by
that piece of shit.� Tell your Master how
beautiful his cock is.�

����������� �Master
Jeff, your cock is beautiful,� I said, totally embarrassed.� Not long ago I could have
never imagined that I would be telling Jeff that his cock was beautiful.

����������� �Tell
him you want to kiss it.�

����������� What?� I didn�t say anything.

����������� �Tell
him you want to kiss it before I whip the hide off of you.�

����������� I
had no doubt that Ann was serious and capable of whipping me with great
severity.� �I want to kiss your cock,
Master Jeff.�� I could see Jeff leering
down at me with a grin as Ann continued to run her hand up and down his
shaft.� Kissing his cock was about the
last thing I wanted to do, but I feared the pair and I wasn�t going to argue.

����������� �Beg
for it.�� Jeff surprised me with this
command.� Jeff and Ann were about the
last couple I would have expected to be asking for something so different and
kinky�guess you never know about someone.

����������� �Yeah,
that�s right, beg,� Ann panted as she kissed his neck and stroked his shaft
faster.

����������� �Please,
Master Jeff, may I kiss your beautiful cock.�
I beg you, Sir.�

����������� �You
call that begging?�� Ann was nearly
breathless as she and Jeff made out.

����������� �Please�please�please
Sir, may I kiss your beautiful cock?�

����������� �Me first.�� Ann took
Jeff�s cock into her mouth and bobbed up and down a few times as Jeff moaned
from her cock sucking.� She came off of
it with a loud slurping sound and looked down at me, her eyes dizzy with
passion as a bit of spit hung from her mouth.�
�That�s how you suck a cock, you worthless piece of shit.�

����������� Jeff
had completely unbuttoned her blouse and he was playing with her breasts as I
glance upward and said once again, �Master, may I please kiss your cock?�

����������� �Yes, just a kiss.��
He and Ann started French kissing as I leaned up and forward and
hesitantly kissed the top of his penis, which was moist from Ann�s saliva.� It was softer than I would have imagined and
not entirely unpleasant.� I sat back down
on my haunches as they made out for another minute Ann finally breaking apart
their embrace.

����������� �Did
you like kissing your Master�s cock slave?�

����������� �It
was okay, Mistress.�

����������� �Okay?�� Ann leaned over and slapped my face hard.
�That was a privilege and honor.� Okay
doesn�t cut it.�� She slapped me again.

����������� �Yes, Mistress, sorry Mistress.� It was great honor.�

����������� �You�d
better get used to it.� There are times
when Jeff needs a little pleasure and I can�t or I�m not in the mood-that�s
when you will be performing another duty for your new bosses.� You�ll suck his cock like your life depended
upon it.�

����������� I
couldn�t believe I was ready to agree to this, but I found the words, �Yes,
Mistress� tumbling out of my mouth as if they had their own will.� Just then the doorbell rang.

����������� �Shit,
that must be Betsy and Mark.� We�ll have
to finish this later.�

����������� �But what about this?��
A big smile on his face, Jeff thrust his crotch upward indicating his
massive erection.

����������� �We�ll
take care of that later, babe,� Ann said, buttoning her blouse.� �Go answer the door shithead,
but stay on your knees.� I want our
guests to witness from the start what you�ve become.�

����������� Greatly
nervous, I quickly crawled to the front door and opened it.� The warmth of the afternoon entered the room
and flooded me along with my embarrassment.�
I kept my head bowed, unable to meet the gaze of my former friends.� 
����������� �What do we have here?� Mark
asked arrogantly, �a fool on his knees?�

����������� Betsy
muttered something like �Oh brother,� as Ann and Jeff came up from behind and
warmly greeted their friends who entered the foyer as I shut the door behind
them.

����������� �I�m
so glad you could make it,� Ann gushed, giving each a big hug.

����������� Jeff
gave Betsy a hug and shook Mark�s hand and said his hellos, the foursome
momentarily ignoring me.� Betsy began to
slide her foot out of her sandal, but Ann stopped her.� �Let him take it off for you,� she said,
giving me a small kick, �that�s part of his duties.�

����������� �Are
you sure?�� It was obvious Betsy was
somewhat uncomfortable with the situation.

����������� �Oh
yes, honey, I know it seems a little weird, but you�ll like it.�� Mark was encouraging his wife to go with the
situation.� �I don�t have a problem with
it, take �em off,� Mark barked at me, sticking his
foot in front of my face before I had a chance to remove Betsy�s sandals.� He was dressed country club, green pastel
polo shirt, Bermuda shorts and loafers.�
He was the epitome of a wealthy arrogant preppy and I detested him, but
there I was, crawling at his feet.� He
wasn�t wearing any socks with his loafers and as I pulled off his shoe I
dreaded the worst.� I removed the shoe
and Mark held his smelly bare foot directly in front of my face.� �Kiss it.��
Mark planted his foot square on my face and I pressed my lips to the
sole.

����������� Betsy
gave him a playful slap.� �What are you
doing?� That�s disgusting.�

����������� �Yea,
it�s disgusting, but what do I care.� Get
the other one off now!�� Mark was
immediately into the role of dominating me.�
Mark put the other foot into my face and I removed the shoe, giving his
sweaty foot a kiss.

����������� �Now Betsy.�� Ann said
to me before turning her attention to Betsy.�
�I know it�s a little on the weird side, but it�s also a lot of fun, not
to mention, convenient.� A simple snap of
my fingers, and he comes running, or in his case, crawling, to do WHATEVER I
want.�� Ann was only a few steps away as
she snapped her fingers and pointed downward towards her feet to demonstrate
her control over me.� 

����������� I
quickly crawled in front of her, �Yes, Mistress?�

����������� �See
what I mean?�� Ann was giggling.� �I want you remove Betsy�s sandals and show
her the proper respect.�

����������� �Yes, Mistress.�� I
slipped the low-heeled sandals off of Betsy�s feet, giving each foot a
kiss.� Thankfully, her feet were well
maintained, the nails a pretty pink.�
Betsy matched her husband�s preppiness, but
not his arrogance.� Dressed smartly in a
sundress, she was casually stylish. 

����������� As
I kissed her feet, Betsy said, �That kind of tickles, but I like it.�

����������� �Feel
free to tell him to do whatever you want, he�s simply
a servant and nothing more.� Don�t
hesitate to use him, maybe later, I�ll have him give you a foot massage,
somehow he is good at it.�

����������� �Excellent.�� Betsy said.

����������� Jeff
turned to lead the group into the entertainment room.� �What would you like to drink?� I made martinis or we have beer, wine.�

����������� �A
martini sounds delicious,� Betsy said.

����������� �I�ll
take a glass of wine, a merlot,� Mark said.

����������� Before
moving on, Jeff gave me a kick in the ass.�
�You heard our guests.� Move
it!�� 

����������� �Yes, Sir.�

����������� �And
crawl, don�t think about standing up unless one of us
tells you too.�

����������� I
quickly crawled away as guffaws from the group littered down upon my ears.� �Unbelievable,� Mark said, �I never thought
he had much going for him.� Now I see
why.�

����������� �He�s
a loser, that�s for sure,� Ann agreed as the group sauntered into the family
room.� Almost useless, but it is fun to
torment the shithead.�

����������� I
poured their drinks, put them on the serving tray and awkwardly crawled into
the family room where Ann and Betsy were talking about houses, Jeff and Mark,
the Lakers.� I had a wisp of nostalgia
for when I used to engage in sports talk, but crawling around on the floor had
mitigated any idea of the posed machismo that was needed to talk Lakers or
football; I was meeting head on with the fact that I was their wimpy servant.

����������� �Sir,
your drink,� I said to Mark, holding up the tray as he took his glass of
wine.� I proceeded to serve the rest, no
one paying any attention to me; it was like I was invisible.� I took out a tray of cheese and crackers and
while remaining on my knees, served the hors devours to them. 

I should have been
happy about being ignored for it wasn�t long when Mark decided to have a little
fun with me, at least what he considered fun.�
He took a bite of one cracker and said, �I don�t like this one.� You can have it.�� With that he took the cracker and mashed it
onto my nose, the cheese binding it to my skin.�
They all started laughing.

�Good job, Mark,�
Ann said gleefully, �the more you hide that ugly face, the better.� Sometimes, I think we should get him a mask
to wear.� Over here,� Ann said, beckoning
me with crook finger.� I crawled to her
as she took a cracker off the tray and smashed onto my head, grinding it into
my hair.� Jeff, who was sitting next to
his wife, reached over and did the same.

�Now, look at you,
slave, you�re a mess,� Jeff chortled.�
�What do you have to say for yourself?�
Don�t you have better manners than that?�

�You�d better not
be getting crumbs on my floor,� Ann warned.��
�Look at that, he is getting crumbs on the floor.� What a slob.��
Ann was voicing what I assumed was mock anger, but anymore, it was hard
to discern her mood.

�Lick them up,
pig� Jeff said.� �Every
single crumb.�

I bent down and
began licking the floor, carpet fibers getting mixed in with cracker crumbs
only added to the disgusting nature of my command.

�Remember when
this guy thought he was some kind of hot shit, writing that Hollywood
television crap?� Mark asked with disdain.�
�Now he is licking your floor like a human vacuum cleaner.�

�Sounds like he�ll
lick anything,� Betsy said with disgust.�
�Feet, floors, what won�t that disgusting pig lick?�

�Should we give it
a test?� Mark asked with eagerness.�
�What should we have him lick up now?�

�Here�s one.�� Ann took a plate that she had been using to
hold her crackers and spat upon it.� She
held it out.� �Lick this.�

Betsy and the rest
gave laughs of disgust and humor.� �Ann�you devilish girl.�

�You don�t know
the half of it,� Jeff said.

I stuck out my
tongue and clean the thick spit off of Ann�s plate which was disgusting enough,
I feared the men would do the same.�
Fortunately, if you can call it that, Ann turned to Betsy.� �Betsy, want to try?�

Betsy looked at
the plate with a mixture of distaste, intrigue and a gleam of mischief.� �He really will?�

�You just saw for
yourself,� Ann said, handing Betsy the plate.

�Why
not.�� Betsy took a moment and
gathered spit in her mouth before letting it loose on the plate.� �Lick, you disgusting pig.�� I took the plate and licked Betsy�s spittle
off of it, trying to distance my mind from the grotesque act.� This set something off in Betsy who suddenly
became more aggressive.� �You like
that?� You enjoy my spit?� Maybe you�d like to drink my piss too?�� Betsy stood up and slapped me.� �What would Joann say if she saw you doing
this?� Or your son?� Do they know how disgusting you are?�� She slapped me three more times.

�Go Betsy go,�
Jeff cheered.

�Yeah, give it to
him, honey,� Mark encouraged.

�I asked you a
question?�� Betsy slapped me again and
began tapping her foot.

�I�uh, Joann would
be disgusted, I suppose.�

�Of course she
would, because you ARE disgusting.�� Slap
again.� �I just want to beat the fucking
shit out of you, you know that?�

�Yes,
ma�am.�

�Ma�am?!� Do I look that fucking old to you?�� Betsy rattled my head four more times with
her vicious slaps.

�No,
sorry.�

�Apologize and
make sure you call her Mistress Betsy,� Ann said sternly.� �And if you want to beat the crap out of him,
please do.�

I leaned over and
kissed Betsy�s feet.� �Sorry, Mistress
Betsy, I apologize deeply for calling you ma�am.�

She looked at her
friends and said, �You�d think I was some kind of grandma or something�you�re
the old man around here, the old, washed up loser.�� They all started laughing at Betsy�s comments
which struck deep; I WAS an old washed up loser being overwhelmed by my younger
counterparts.

�I have an idea,�
Jeff said.� I hated Jeff�s ideas, they
were nothing but trouble.� �Go get a
magic marker from the office.�

�Yes, Master,� I
mumbled crawling away having an idea that something was going to be marked on
me.� I quickly found the pen and the
ominous writing on the label of the permanent marker.� Permanent?� This could be bad, very bad.� Returning to kneeling
before the two couples that were laughing and enjoying themselves like any
other group of friends getting together for a Saturday evening.� They ignored me for several moments leaving
me feeling awkward simply sitting there on knees and doing nothing.� Jeff and Mark were busy making disparaging
remarks about a coworker, questioning his competence, which gave Mark an
opening for a dig.

�Of course, Nerd
Boy,� the coworker they were talking about was called nerd boy, like they had
any room to be calling someone a nerd, �isn�t as nearly as bad off as
Mike.� Mike is the ultimate of
incompetence.� The
bottom of the food chain.� Literally the bottom.�

�Yes,� Jeff
agreed, �could you see Mike serving as Andrew�s lackey?� It would be like the blind leading the blind.�

Mark laughed.� �Yeah, I�m sure that Andrew hasn�t even
gotten laid.�

�Whose Andrew?� You
haven�t said anything to me about him,� Betsy said.� I could see the curiosity in Betsy about this
Andrew.

�He�s some new
hire, only a couple of years out of school.�
He�s pretty smart, but a lot to learn.�
And he�s chubby, shy, awkward around
women.� Your usual loser, unlike��� Jeff leaned over and grabbed the marker out
of my hand.� ��this loser.�� He began writing on my forehead.� �Here it is in permanent marker�l-o-s-e-r.�

They all started
laughing.� �Oh, that is too funny,� Ann
said.� �We should send him out for an
errand.�

�That is evil,
Ann.�� Betsy was looking at Ann with a
new appreciation.

�I don�t know
about that.� But it will certainly keep
him humble�they way he should be.�

Mark was staring
at me with absolute disdain.� �Oh I don�t
think he will ever have an idea of anything but being humble from now on.�

Betsy was also
staring at me, whether it was the situation that was so crazy or if she was
mulling an idea through her head, I could see that something was going on with
her.� Ann also noticed her
pondering.� 

�What is it,
Betsy?�

�Maybe we should
dress him up like a girl�or as much as possible and let Andrew practice with
him.� Mike, or I guess it would be
something more like Michelle would be his little toy slut, use him anyway he
liked.�

�I�m not so sure
that Andrew is gay or as kinky like we seem to be,� Jeff doubted though a smile
crept on his face.

�You might give
him a few hints.� Perhaps hire Mike to be
his secretary and work it in from there.�

�Hhm, interesting idea, but probably have better uses for
Mike for right now.�

Betsy
continued.� �You know what we should
do�check out what kind of girl loser is.�

�Yes,� Mark
agreed, �he should be in a dress.� He�s
definitely not a man.�� Mark stared at
me.� �You�re not a man are you?� At least a real man?�

�Uh, I guess not,
sir.�

�You guess?� Do real men go around kissing other men�s
feet?� Letting them beat them?� Have loser written on their forehead?� �Mark was laughing at me.

I was near tears
as I stared at the floor.� �No,
Sir.�� I was defeated,
there was no way that I felt that I could really be called a man.

Mark held up is
barefoot.� �Go ahead, kiss it.�� I planted a kiss on the bottom of his foot.� �Thank me.�

�Thank you, Sir.�

�For
what?�� Mark�s tone was no
nonsense and the room had grown quiet.

�For
showing me what I am and allowing me to�to�be in your service.� To be in all of your
service.�

�Good, Mike,� Mark
said, holding his other foot up for me to kiss, �I�m glad you understand your
position.� You are very fortunate that
the Moore family has taken you
in.�� I had stopped with one kiss.� �Keep kissing� he said as he lectured
me.� �I know that there are people like
you in this world meant to serve us.� He stopped his lecture and pressed his
foot down on my face.� �Lick�and that is
the right nature of things.� We all can�t
be winners can we?�

�No, Sir, we
can�t,� I said between licks to the sole of his sweaty, salty foot.� I took a glance at the group
who was watching Mark with an odd contentedness, whether it was the alcohol or
the moment, the mood had decelerated into mellowness.� 

Ann had a bemused
smile on her face.� �What do you think,
Betsy?� How does it feel to watch your
husband demean and use another man?�

Betsy had rested
her head on Mark�s shoulder and was holding his hand.� �It�s fabulous.� Still a little weird.� I don�t think I�ll be sharing this with our
neighbors anytime soon.�

Ann leaned forward
with a jolt of eagerness raising the energy level.� �You know what is even better?� Watching your man beat another man.� It is so primal, I mean, damn to watch
someone get thrashed by another person���
Ann mocked fanning herself.�
�Hot��

�Cool down there,
girl.�� Mark was all smiles.� �I can see that things are going well that
way in the Moore household.� I hope it has the same affect on Betsy.� Suck the toes, boy.� Lick between them before I beat your
worthless ass.�

I
was licking, kissing and sucking, dreading what was about to happen.� I had healed up from my previous encounter
with Jeff, and I was suspecting I was in for more of the same.� �You used a belt on him last time?�� Mark asked with an insouciance that defied
the concept that they were talking about beating another human being.

�Yes,� Jeff
answered with equal casualness, �I used a belt, but we can find something else
for you�though we do need to get some proper implements like whips, crops and
canes.�

�Oh, honey, what
are you thinking,� Ann interjected like they were discussing the weather, �we
have the girl�s riding crops in the garage.�

�Yes, yes,� Betsy
said excitedly, �crops.� Now that would
hurt.�

�Oh, there are a lotta of things that we could use.� Ping pong paddles,
wooden spoons from the kitchen, what else�shoes.�

�Shoes?�� Mark had a gleam in his eye.

�Yes,� Ann matched
his gleam.� �Would you like Mike to fetch
your loafer or one of Betsy�s slides?�

Mark pretended he
was pondering a deep thought.� �The slide
would be too light.� Fetch the loafer
boy.� And bring it back in your mouth
like a good dog.�

Once again, I
crawled away and managed to get the shoe into my mouth and bring it back to
Mark.� �Good, boy,� he
said, taking his loafer into his hand, �bringing your Master his shoe to
blister your ass with.� Stand and
strip,� Mark commanded.

This was not going
to be easy, getting naked in front of what was essentially an audience.� I slowly rose to my feet, it felt good to
stand, and began undressing in front of my tormentors.� �Geez, haven�t you
ever heard of a gym?� Mark said.

Mark was in a
little better shape than Jeff, but he didn�t have anything to brag about, yet
there were titters from the women.�
�Yeah, instead of loser, we should have written lumpy on his forehead,�
Betsy giggled.� She stood up and walked
over to me and pinched my sides revealing love handles of fat, she then pulled
harder yanking me onto my toes from the pain.�
�Isn�t this disgusting?� It�s like
seal blubber.�

�Make a seal
noise, slave, perform for us,� Ann ordered.

I hesitated trying
to think of what the sound was like.�
Betsy grabbed a nipple and pulled hard.�
�You heard her, seal.� Make a
noise.�

As Betsy pulled
and twisted, I started barking the best I could like a seal as everyone
laughed, Ann even clapping with delight at my behavior.� �That is too much.�

�And what is this
tiny thing?�� Betsy pointed at my
penis.� �Poor Joann, I never knew she had
it so bad.� I didn�t know she was married
to a eunuch.�� I had stopped
barking.� Betsy twisted my nipple
viciously.� �Keep barking.�

As I barked, I
noticed the shoe in Mark�s hand as he kept rhythmically slapping it against his
hand, an evil look on his face as he waited his turn with me.

�Back on your
knees, clap and spin like a seal,� Betsy ordered.� Betsy falling quite quickly
and easily into the role of dominant.

�Too bad we don�t
have a ball to balance on his nose,� Jeff commented.

�Use this.�� Mark handed Betsy his loafer and she put it
over my face, the inside part covering my nose so I had to inhale the
odor.� 

Ringmistress Betsy kept things going.� �Bark, spin, clap and balance Mark�s shoe on
your nose.� You drop it, you�re going to
pay.�

Keeping my head
turned back, spinning and clapping my hands while barking gave great amusement
to everyone who clapped and urged me to spin faster and bark louder.� �That�s right, perform for us, loser,� Jeff
yelled over the racket I was making.

Betsy was twirling
her hand above me as she urged me to go faster and faster.� The inevitable occurred and the shoe slipped
off my face and plopped onto the ground, the room instantly becoming quiet as
if I had committed a major faux pus.�� I kept my head down as I dreaded the next
sequence of events.� Betsy slowly
hissed:� �Look at me.�

I looked up and
she stood over me glaring down with obvious anger, it seemed to me they were
taking all of this a bit too seriously.�
�What did I tell you?�

�Not to drop the
shoe,� I mumbled.

�Louder.�

�Not to drop the
shoe, Mistress Betsy.�

�Not exactly, I
said if you dropped it, you were going to pay.�
Now, what do you think I meant by that?�

�That
I�d be in trouble.�

�Oh yes, you�re in
trouble all right.� But for a loser like
you, I�m sure that�s nothing new, is it?�

�No, I suppose
not, Mistress.�

�Yes, I suppose
not.� I�m trying to keep my composure,
despite the fact that you insulted my husband by dropping his shoe on the
ground.�

�I didn�t mean to
insult him.�

�Then you meant to
insult me by disobeying my order.�

Mark got up from
the couch.� �So you meant to insult my
wife?��� He was standing next to Betsy, I was staring down at their feet wishing I could
disappear.� 

�Please Master,
Mistress, I did not mean to insult you.�
It was the furthest thing from my mind.�
I only want to please you, to do everything I can for your pleasure.�

�That�s not what
your actions demonstrated,� Mark said.

�I�m very
disappointed in you, shithead,� Ann said.

�I�m sorry,
Mistress.�

�Sorry doesn�t cut
it.�� Ann sounded disappointed, I wasn�t
sure how much was genuine, but she certainly was acting like I had let her
down.� �My apologies to
you and Betsy, Mark.�

�Don�t worry about
it, Ann, it wasn�t your fault.� I�ll be
more than glad to handle his discipline.�
With your permission of course.�

�Yes, please do as
you wish.�� Ann was the gracious host
trying to keep her guests happy.

�Go push the
ottoman in front of Ann and Jeff.�� 

I followed Mark�s
orders and put the piece of furniture in front of Jeff and Ann.� �Pick up my shoe and hand it to me, then get
up on it on your hands and knees.�

I did as I was told, my ass in a convenient position for Mark to punish,
arms and legs shaking from fear as Ann put her foot under my face for me to
kiss her toes, her nails pedicured in a French
style.� �This should be
interesting.�� Ann�s voice had that what
was now familiar tone of lust and Mark was once again slapping his shoe against
his hand in an ominous rhythm.� �Are you
shaking, shithead?� 

�Yes, Mistress
Ann,� I said, between kisses to her toes.

She and the rest
laughed at me.� �Aw, the little baby is
shaking,� Ann mocked.

�He has good
reason to,� Mark said, �after his insults, he is going
to get a much deserved lesson in respect.�

�Please, Sir, I
greatly respect you.�

�Shut up.� You insulted both my wife and me.�

�No, Sir, no
sir.�� I was nearly in tears.

Mark slapped me
hard on the ass with the heel of his shoe.�
�I said to shut up.� You have the
nerve to disobey and argue with me?�

�Sorry,
sir.�

�You will
be.�� The beating started.� �You keep kissing your Mistress� toes with
the respect you failed to show us,� he yelled as he pounded my ass with his
shoe.� He slapped me hard with the shoe,
the heel seeming to connect with the core of my ass, as I groaned from the
thudding pain.� The room was eerily
quiet, only the slapping of leather against skin and my moans.� Jeff had plopped his feet on my back using me
as a footrest as he laid back and enjoyed watching me get worked over by his
partner.� I happened to catch a glance of
his hand tickling Ann�s leg and I�m sure everyone was turned on by the show of
force over me. 

Betsy was standing
in front of me.� �I love watching the agony
all over his face, honey,� she said calmly as I twisted and turned with each
slam of the shoe.

�Are you getting
turned on?� Jeff asked with glee.

�Jeff, you naughty
boy,� Betsy answered.� �Yes, I am.�

�So am I,� Ann
said, her voice low and sultry.� �This is
great.�

Mark was
relentless.� By now I was nearly crazy
with agony, I was sure my ass must have been colored a deep purple by now, even though it wasn�t�at least not yet.� �Please, mercy, please, please,� was all I
could scream.

�Quit making a
racket,� Ann admonished, �suck on this.��
She shoved her foot in my mouth to use as a gag as I stopped the begging
and simply moaned, about to pass out from the pain.� I sucked and choked on her foot and then
suddenly Mark stopped.

�Wow,� he said,
sounding stunned, �I can�t believe I did that.�

Betsy moved over
behind me and touched my throbbing, bruised bottom.� �I�d say you have a streak of sadism in
you.�� She gave him a big kiss.� �Nice job.�

�Thanks, honey.�� He
handed her the shoe.� �Want to see what
it is like for yourself?

�Don�t mind if I
do,� she answered with joy.

I wanted to shout
out, please no, but knew that would most likely only agitate them.� Ann pulled her foot out of my mouth and wiped
it on my hair.� �Yuck, he got his drool
all over my foot, that�s almost as bad as stepping in dog crap.�� Ann continued wiping her foot off on me like
I was a rug.

�You can suck on
my toes now, while Betsy has at you,� Jeff said, putting his foot in my
mouth.� �Suck and lick, clean the sweat
from your Master�s feet.�� Ann leaned
back and like Jeff before, rested her feet on my back.

I started to work
on Jeff�s malodorous foot as I sensed Betsy lining up behind me.� I could feel her tapping the shoe against my
ass, getting it into position.� She
brought the shoe leather down against me, the first blow tentative, not nearly
as brutal as Mark�s strikes.� �Come on,
Betsy, you can do better than that.��
Jeff wiggled his toe that was in my mouth as he said this.

�Give me a second, guys.�� The
next one was stronger, still somewhat tentative, but enough to cause me to jump
slightly.� Three firm ones in a row
followed that one, all hitting the same spot, which really hurt and caused me
to squirm and twist. 

�Yes, that�s it,�
Jeff yelled, �give it to him.�

Betsy was off and
running, slamming me with the loafer as I grunted and moaned under the
attack.� After about five relentless
minutes, Betsy, breathing hard, stopped.�
�That�s hard work.� I�m like
sweating.�� Mark went over and embraced
his wife, giving her a deep long kiss.

�I think it�s
having the desired effect,� Mark said, winking at his hosts.� �Why don�t you have dickhead clean off some
of that sweat.�

�What do you
mean?�

�Have him lick
under your arms.�

�Hhm, okay.�� Betsy
stood in front of me, the sundress allowed access to her arm pits, she lifted
one arm and simply said, �Lick.�

I sat up on my
knees and began licking the warm, salty sweat from her armpit.� I could taste a little bit of deodorant mixed
in with her musk, but I never imagined licking another person�s armpit until
that moment.� I only licked for a few
seconds before she pushed me away and back down onto my knees.

Betsy was now
breathless from more than the physical effort of the beating.� �Oh yeah, honey I�m definitely feeling
it.�� She put the shoe on my back and
started making out with Mark.� Jeff and
Ann had also started making out as I kept in position, feeling my ass becoming
bruised as I worshipped my Master�s feet.�
By now, I knew he liked to have me not only suck and lick between his
toes, but to run my tongue along the sole of his foot, giving the rough bottom
long slow licks, as I tried to mentally distance myself from the degrading,
ignoble task of being used in such a degrading manner.

� Mark led Betsy over to the sofa a little ways
apart from the hosts and the two couples continued to explore each other as I
tried my best to ignore the passions within the room, concentrating on Jeff�s
feet as each couple moaned and kissed.� I
noticed Mark give Jeff the thumbs up signal as he kissed Betsy�s neck and
looked over her shoulder at Jeff, Ann nibbling on her husband�s neck.

�This fucking
rules,� Mark said.� �After beating him, I
feel like I do after a good workout.�

�I love the way
you mastered that wimp,� Betsy said, tracing her finger along Mark�s chest.� �You are so manly, strong, showing no mercy,
showed your strength.� Someone else would
have caved in to the pussy�s whining.�

Ann broke her kiss
with Jeff.� �Isn�t it amazing, the power
surge.� I can�t imagine what it must be
like to really own someone.�

Jeff said, �Baby,
we pretty much own this one.� Isn�t that
right, toe jam sucker?�

�Yes, Sir.� I
mumbled.

�And we have it
all on tape.� Maybe for our next party,
we�ll play it.�

�I think we should
play it for Joann,� Ann suggested.�� �Or
maybe his son.� Would you like that,
slave?�

�Not really,
Mistress,� I said weakly.

�Not really,� Ann
said, mocking me with a sarcastic tone of voice, �what a fucking sissy.�� Ann sat up and picked up the shoe off of my
back.� �A god-damn-sissy-,� she said,
bringing the shoe down on my ass four hard times with each word as I yelped and
bucked with each strike.� Ann sat back
and put her feet onto my back once again.

�You know what,
all of this is making me hungry.�� Jeff
stretched his arms lazily before shoving me off the ottoman and onto the floor
with his foot.� �Serve us dinner, sissy.�

�Yes, Master.�

�You�re going to
have him put something on, aren�t you?� Betsy asked, her voice filled with
disgust making me feel even worse about my appearance.� �I don�t want to have to look at his tiny
thing while eating dinner.�

�Sissy, there is
an apron in the drawer below where the baggies are kept.�

�After you get
your apron, bring me my purse,� Betsy ordered.�


I quickly did my
bidding and returned to kneel in front of Betsy and hand her the purse.� �Stand up,� she said curtly as she dug
through her purse.� �Model for us,
sissy.� 

I put on the white
lace-trimmed apron, stood up and spun around.

�Curtsey for
everyone,� Jeff ordered.

I held out the
apron and did a small curtsey as best as I could for each person.

�Bend the knees
more,� Ann commanded.

�Wait, before he
does that, come here,� Betsy ordered.� I
went over to her.� �Bend over so I can
put this on.�� In her hand she held a
tube of lipstick that she proceeded to put on my lips, a bright pink
lipstick.� �Since it has touched your
awful fucking lips, you owe me a tube of lipstick.� It�s MAC.��


�Yes, Mistress
Betsy,� I said, feeling my face turning from embarrassment.

��Go do your proper curtsey, show your owner
how well you can do it.�� I started to
turn to curtsey when Betsy said, �Stop.�
Come here.�� I turned to her and
she wrote in lipstick with big letters the word, sissy on my chest.� �It�s obvious to us, but in case you forget,
what you are is right there in pink, a fucking sissy.� Lowest on the food chain, meant to serve all
others.�

I meekly nodded my
head and turned towards Jeff and deeply curtsied.� �What are you?� he asked.

By now that was a
loaded question, I was a lot of things:�
His slave, a sissy, a wimp, a thoroughly beaten and degraded human.� �I�m a sissy, Master, your slave, Sir.�

�You are whatever
I want you to be,� Jeff said.

����������� Ann
giggled.� �Sorry, honey, one thing he
can�t be even if you told him to is be a real man.� He is definitely a wimp and can�t be anything
but that.� Isn�t that right, sissy?�

����������� �Yes,
Mistress.�� I curtsied for her.

����������� �Now
face the camera and curtsey and tell everyone what a sissy wimp you are.�

����������� I
faced the camera and said, �I am a sissy wimp.��
I was sure this would eventually be seen and would be a source of great
embarrassment.

����������� Jeff
finally announced that he had enough of this and said it was time to eat.� For the next hour the group enjoyed their
food as I waited upon them, keeping their water and wine glasses full and being
attentive to their needs.� They discussed
business and other issues as if I wasn�t there.�
They had tired of playing their games with me and between the lateness
of the night and the alcohol, greatly to my relief, things slowed down and they
basically left me alone to concentrate on my servant duties.

����������� Betsy
and Mark finally decided to make it a night and said their goodnights, of
course I had to kiss their feet one more time and put on their shoes and as
they departed Betsy commented that they would be sure to come back and amuse
themselves more with me.� Ann telling her
that I was available anytime she or Mark wished.

����������� Ann
and Jeff had embraced after shutting the door and were kissing as I knelt like
an obedient dog at their heels.� �All
right, dickhead, before we retire to the upstairs and you get to work cleaning
up the mess, I want you to assume the crab position,� Jeff announced with
arrogant pleasure.

����������� �Please,
Sir,� I begged while immediately getting into position.

����������� �Yes,
slave, I hope you are begging for us to kick you hard.� Anything else and I will consider it a
demerit.�

����������� I
was going to beg for mercy, but I immediately knew that it was a useless
thought.� I said nothing.

����������� �You
were saying something, slave?�� Jeff
asked.� 

����������� �No,
Sir.�� I could see the joy in Jeff�s eyes
as I am sure he knew that I wanted to beg for mercy.� I was in position, weight supported by my
arms as I bent over in the crab position, my genitals completely exposed.

����������� �Would
you like to have the first honor?� Jeff asked Ann.

����������� �Why
thank you, dear.�� Ann held her right
foot over my face.� �Kiss the foot that�s
going to create so much discomfort for you.�

����������� I
craned my head upwards and kissed the bottom of her bare foot.� She moved in front of me and quickly kicked
me directly into the balls, white agony filling me as I twisted and turned from
the pain, but remained in position as previously instructed by Jeff.

����������� �Very
good, sissy,� he noted, �you remained in place.�
����������� �Yes, Master� I gasped, �I
hope it pleased you.�

����������� �Yes,
I suppose it did.�� He held his foot over
my face and I kissed it as I had done for Ann.

����������� He
moved into position and waited a moment before letting loose with a vicious
slam to my crotch with his foot.� Again,
I was ready to vomit the pain was so intense, but I remained in place as my two
tormentors laughed at my agony.

����������� �Ah,
does that hurt our little sissy� Ann mocked in baby talk before embracing her
husband.� �Babes, you gotta
fuck me right now, I�m horny as hell.�

����������� �Let�s
go.�� Jeff and Ann made their way to the
stairs.� �Clean up down here.� When you are done and if we hadn�t called for
you, then you can lay down outside our door in case we need you throughout the
night.� Otherwise, you know the morning
routine.�

����������� �Yes,
Master,� I said, grateful to finally being left alone even if it was only to
clean.

PART
FOUR

&nbsp;

����������� The
next week was rather uneventful.� I was
ordered around by the family, by Maria, but no one else was exposed to my
submission and Jeff and Ann were relatively light on me as far as corporal
punishment.� The twins were busy with
activities and I didn�t see a lot of them, and on Thursday Jeff let it be known
that they were letting up on the punishments because of Family Night which was
going to be on Sunday.� This was
definitely a double-edged sword, a respite from pain, but Sunday would be hellish.
That would be the day when I would read off my demerits and be appropriately
punished. It also meant that I was most likely in for
a severe beating since they were concerned enough about my body to make sure it
was healed and not bruised.� 

����������� Again,
Sunday was a day of tension as I wasn�t sure what to expect except that the
meeting was schedule for four p.m.� When the time arrived, the family made themselves comfortable on the sofas and I served them soft
drinks.� After telling me to kneel in the
middle of the room, Jeff then stood up and in a semi-formal manner addressed
the family as I knelt at his heels.� I
was dressed casually in jeans, Tshirt and socks.� The rest of the family was also dressed
casually and all were barefoot.

����������� �Obviously
Mike here is more than our employee, he is our slave.�

����������� �No
kidding, dad,� Nicole said.� �but why?�

����������� �With
him, I think is some kind of genetic defect where he has this desire to serve
others.� He realizes the fact the he is
inferior to us, I know that might sound a little harsh, but let�s face it,
we�re all not equal.� And in regards to
Mike, he�s barely worth licking our feet so he should be grateful to be in our
home.� Plus he got himself into a
situation that resulted in our hiring him.�
Initially we didn�t quite expect all of this�� Jeff rested his foot on
my back.� �But it turns out we�re all
quite suited for this.�

����������� �This
is going to be great,� Jordan
said, �no more picking up or cleaning.�

����������� �You
guys need to be careful about what you say, having a
slave is not exactly politically correct to say the least.�

����������� �We�ll
just tell anyone who cares that he works for our family.� Considering that his son is such a pussy, no
one will be surprised by that.�� Jordan
was probably more arrogant than his father.�


����������� Nicole
brightened, the ennui absent.� �I�ve got an idea, dad, why don�t we hire his
son to work for us.� Like father, like
son.� I�m sure he�s a natural just like
his father.� He was always volunteering
to do stuff for me though I wanted nothing to do with him.�

����������� �What
do you think, Mike, should we hire Jonathan?�

����������� This
was awful, I had a hard time explaining to my son why
I was always at the Moore
household, now this proposal.� �I don�t
know if that�s such a good idea, Sir.�

����������� Jeff�s
voice was angry.� �Are you saying that
Nicole had a bad idea?�

����������� �Oh,
no Sir, not that�I just�it would be so embarrassing.������ 

����������� �Thinking
of yourself again�tsk�tsk.�� Ann said
condescendingly.

����������� �I
think it�s a splendid idea,� Jeff said.

����������� �But
he already has a job,� I protested.

����������� �Yes
I know, works in the kitchen at the country club,� Jeff said.� �Tomorrow, I�ll see to it that he is fired, then you can make the proposal that more help is needed
here.�

����������� I
had no doubt that Jeff would have Jonathan fired as he was on the board of
directors and well-connected at the club.�
Jonathan had gone to work there so he could play the course once a week
with the other employees after I was no longer able to afford the
membership.� Jonathan was a pretty good
golfer though not quite good enough to have played on the varsity squad.� 

����������� �Also,
in keeping with the family thing, we will eventually be introducing Mike to the
rest of the family as our slave.�

����������� �I
bet grandpa Charles will love kicking his ass,� Nicole
said.

����������� �Yes,
I�m sure mom and dad will have their fun with him,� Ann said.� Then added with a giggle,
�I can see Dad taking him out to the barn, hanging him from a hook and taking a
whip to him.� He used to talk
about doing that to some of the workers he employed.� Maybe that�s where I got my sadistic side
from.�

����������� �We�ll
leave that for the future.� Right now, I
thought it would be nice to have a proper ceremony to recognize our property�s
new position.� We will begin by having
slave Mike go to each of us, kiss our feet in proper
adoration and respect, then pronounce his service for us.� You can handle that can�t you, slave?�

����������� �Yes, Sir.�

����������� �Then,
begin with me.�

����������� Jeff
planted his feet before me and I kissed them, then
said, �Master Jeff, your lowly slave vows to do his best to serve you.� Thank you for allowing me to do that.�

����������� �We
will see how long it lasts.�

����������� I
crawled over to the sofa where Ann was sitting.�
She looked smug and pleased as I approached her, then
began shaking her head.� �No, no, not low
enough.� Go back to Jeff, then crawl over again, this time on your belly like the
slime you are.�

����������� �Yes, Mistress.�� I
crawled back to Jeff, this time on my belly just to be safe, kissed his feet
one more time, then returned to Ann.

����������� �Look,
it�s a worm,� Jordan
gleefully pronounced.

����������� �He�s
not even that,� Nicole said, with that smug boredom that only a teenager can
possess.� �He�s more along the level of
the slime a worm creates.� Isn�t that
right, mom?�

����������� Ann
laughed.� �Yes, dear, I believe you are
right.�� Ann, as she often did when
excited or nervous, was bouncing her right leg which was crossed over her
left.� I kissed her planted left foot, as
the right foot kind of bounced off my head, then she
stopped the leg bounce long enough for me to kiss the bottom of that foot.� �Thank you, Mistress Ann, for allowing this
slime to serve you.� You are far too
gracious to allow me this honor.�

����������� �You
are right about that, slave,� she said before bopping me in the nose with her
foot, bringing tears to my eyes.

����������� I
then crawled the couple of inches to Jordan
and kissed his feet.� �I hope I can
please you, Master Jordan, I will do all I can for your pleasure.�� 

����������� �Lift
up your head.�

����������� I
held up my head and looked up at the eighteen-year-old who glared down at
me.� He took his feet and slapped each
side of my face with the bottom of the corresponding foot, whacking my face
back and forth several times, each slap with the
bottom of his foot resulting in firmer hits than if it had been his hands.� �Boing�boing�boing�� he said as he did
this much to the laughter and amusement of his family. 

����������� �What
do you say?�� Jeff asked sternly as he
moved and sat next to his wife on the end of the sofa, putting his arms around
her.�� They would have appeared as the
typical family except for the fact that I was on my belly kissing their feet.

����������� �Thank
you, Master Jordan.� Please punish me as
you see fit.�

����������� �Oh,
I will, dirtbag.� As much as mom and dad will
let me.�
����������� I had a sense of dread as I
knew that he could be quite cruel.� I
moved on to Nicole and kissed her feet offering her devotion and that I would
work very hard for her.� Boredly she said, �Yeah, yeah, we will see.� You know what I feel like doing�� she looked
over at Ann.� �Can I spit on him, mom?�

����������� �Sure,
honey, if that�s what you want to do,� she said pleasantly as if Nicole had
asked if she could have a cookie.

����������� �Look
up, pig.� 

����������� I
looked up and was greeted by a wad of spit flying onto my face, most of it
hitting my forehead then languidly dripping into my eyes.� She spit a few more times while laughing, the
moisture hitting my face including my eyes and lips; it was dreadfully
humiliating.� 

����������� �Mind
your manners, slave,� Ann said, the room suddenly quiet after their laughter of
watching the spittle rain upon me.

����������� �Thank
you, Miss Nicole.�

����������� �It�s
Mistress Nicole,� she said.

����������� �Thank
you, Mistress Nicole.�

����������� �That
was interesting.�� Jeff said as if in
deep thought.� �Mike, go to the kitchen
and get a plate.�

����������� �Yes,
Master.�� I quickly crawled to the
kitchen and returned to the plate, holding it up for Jeff to take from me.� He immediately spat upon it.� Then again, and again, collecting phlegm.

����������� �That�s
kind of gross, dad,� Nicole said.

����������� �Yes,
but our slave is going to appreciate his position even more now.� Go ahead honey, add your contribution,� he
said to Ann, handing her the plate.

����������� And
so it went, the family handing down the plate until it was a liquid mess of
spittle that I knew I would be faced with in a moment; just how, I wasn�t quite
sure.

����������� �What
a freakn� mess,� Jordan
said after Nicole contributed a large load of spit.

����������� �Yuch, now what?� Nicole asked, holding out the plate like it contained nuclear waste.
�This is really gross.�

����������� �It�s
time for Mike to do the dishes,� Jeff said.

����������� �Dad�are you really�?��
Nicole asked with awe in her voice.

����������� �Put
in down there.� Lick it clean, slave.�

����������� I
could feel my stomach begin to roil as I faced the viscous mess before me.� �Sir, I�m not sure��

����������� Before
I could finish my protest, Jeff had produced a crop from somewhere and jumped
behind me and lashed my back viciously while saying,
�You will do it now, slave.� Lick it
clean.�� 

����������� As
he whipped me, Jordan
put his foot on my neck and smashed my face into the spittle.�� �Lick it, dirtbag.�

����������� I
began the onerous task of licking their spit from the plate.� I tried blocking it from my mind, I tried to
pretend it was a type of gourmet food, but the reality was, I was actually
cleaning their disgusting spit from a plate, licking up the entire vile mess as
the family talked among themselves ignoring what I was doing for them.� It took me several minutes to get all slime
cleaned from the plate and I could barely keep myself from vomiting, but I knew
if I began to wretch or vomit I would be punished for not appreciating their
spit.

����������� �I
imagined our toe jam doesn�t taste so bad anymore,� Jeff commented as I finished
the plate.

����������� �Yes,
you�re going to be closer to this family than you ever imagined,� said
Ann.� �Consuming who knows what?� What do you say to that?�

����������� �It�s
an honor, Mistress Ann, to be your servant, thank you so much for allowing me
to consume your spit,� I lied.

����������� �Oh,
they�ll be plenty of that.� With every
meal I imagine.� Being the creative chef
I am, I�ll create some kind of vile cruel for you, you know, spit, cold
oatmeal, some yucky leftovers.�

����������� �Maybe
even some piss,� Jeff added.

����������� �Dad,
you are wicked,� Jordan
said with admiration.

����������� �Yes,
piss sounds like a good idea,� Ann agreed.�
�The way I feel about you I�d even shit in it except that�s too
disgusting even for me.� Plus, very
unhealthy, as much as I enjoy torturing you, I don�t want to kill you.� At least not yet.�� Ann was now laughing.

����������� �All
right, slave,� Jeff said, standing up, �return the plate to the kitchen and
prepare for your atonement.�

����������� I
took the plate to the kitchen, crawled back and knelt in front of the couch
waiting while Jeff and Jordan discussed when his next baseball game was taking
place.� �Strip,� Jeff ordered, in between
his conversation with his son.

����������� I
took off my Tshirt and shorts, then
hesitated about the underwear, he couldn�t have wanted me to be naked in front
of Nicole and Jordan.� �Everything,� he
announced as if reading my mind.� I took
off the underwear and added it the neat pile of clothes.� I was totally humiliated being naked in front
of them.

����������� Jordan
and Nicole both snickered when I finished stripping.� �What an ugly body,� Nicole sneered.

����������� �Yeah,
old man,� Jordan
said, �you ever hear of exercise.�

����������� �Yes,
Sir, I have,� I said.

����������� �Then
try it some time.�

����������� �Yes,
Sir, I will.�

����������� �Jordan,
I have an idea� Ann said, �you can be his
trainer.� Work him hard, I want our property
to look suitable for the Moore
household.�

����������� �Oh
yeah, mom, it will be my pleasure.� In
fact, give me twenty-five pushups right now,� Jordan
barked.� �Over here in front of me, kiss
my feet each time you go down.�� 

����������� I
began my exercise, struggling through the pushups, I began to shake and tremble
after only ten, Nicole said, �You are pathetic, you know that.� My poor brother has his work cut out for
him.�

����������� �Feel
free to discipline him as needed when you are training him,� Jeff said.

����������� I
finally finished the twenty-five and my arms were exhausted and shaking.� �That�s enough for now, Jordan,
we need to get started on his punishment.�
Mike go stand in the middle of the room and
begin reading from your journal of errors that you have committed.�

����������� Being
so nervous, I could barely make out the words in my small notebook.� I started with the errors made at the grocery
store, things left unclean or untidy, a whole litany
of minor mistakes that Ann had nitpicked and fussed over.� Then I started on more serious errors, real
or imagined behaviors where I was judged to be insufficient in showing respect,
etc.� I could feel tears well up in my
eyes as I noticed the family growing more perturbed as I read from the list,
particularly Jeff.� When I finished, I
was left to stand there for a long time while Jeff seemed to be considering my
plight.

����������� �Disrespect
for my family will not be tolerated,� Jeff started.

����������� �Sir,
I would never disrespect anyone in your family.�

����������� �Shut
up, I didn�t ask for your opinion.�

����������� �Of course not, Sir.�
I apologize.�

����������� Jeff
then went over and opened his briefcase which was on the kitchen counter.� �This is a little something I picked up the
other day.�� I could see that it was a
wooden paddle and he was slapping it against his hand.� �About once a month or so, this little baby
will be used for to correct Mike�s misdeeds.�
We will all have a turn with it and I expect our property will remember
his behavior for the rest of the month.�
I�d do it more often than monthly except I imagine Mike is going to be
in rough shape after we are finished.�

����������� I
began to tremble when he finished the statement and the room was eerily
quiet.� Finally, the silence was broken
by, �Who is going first?� Jordan asking the question.

����������� �Good
question.� I figure we will let Ann have
the honor of going last and finishing him off, particularly after we have him
ready for her.� One of you kids can have
the honor of going first.�

����������� �Can
I��� Jordan
was beyond eager.

����������� �You
okay with that, Nicole?�

����������� �I
don�t care, I�ll get my time with him soon enough.�

����������� Jordan
jumped up from the couch and walked over to get the paddle from his
father.� �First,� Jeff said, �we�d better
restrain him he said to his son as he handed him the paddle.� �Pull the ottoman into the middle of the
room, slave� Jeff ordered.� I quickly
obeyed and then was told to lay over the large piece of furniture.� Jeff then tied my wrists and ankles to the
legs of the ottoman so I was stretched out and unable to move.� So there I was, tied down to the ottoman,
stretched out naked before the audience that was ready to witness my pain and
humiliation along with being eager participants.

����������� �This
is awesome� Jordan
said, �I can�t believe I�m about ready to paddle Mike.� You ever think that I would be doing that,
old man?�
����������� �No, Sir.�

����������� �I
bet not.� Are you ready for this?�
����������� �Not really, Sir.�

����������� �Too
bad, because it�s time for a little beat down.��
Jordan
moved behind me.� My hearts was pounding
and I almost was hyperventilating with fear.�
I could feel him lining up the piece of wood and then there was a sudden
wisp of air movement followed by a resounding thwack to my ass, Jordan
not even coming close to giving me a warm up.�
The sound of wood against flesh echoed and I gasped from the sudden,
searing pain.� �I guess those tennis
lessons will pay off now,� Jordan
said as he delivered another thudding blow against my ass.� I bucked against my bonds and could only
think there was no way I was going to survive this; Jordan already had me in
agony after two swats and there was three more people to go after he was
finished.

����������� �Good
thing we tied him down,� Jeff said casually.�
The ottoman was turned sideways and I glanced over at the family sitting
on the sofa. Again, they looked contented and like any other normal family, Ann
snuggled into her husband�s arms, Nicole looking on with a feigned disinterest,
arms folded over as she slumped back into the plump sofa.

����������� �Yes,�
Jordan said as
he hit me again, �I would say he would have a difficult time holding still
without the restraints.� �Look at that,
he�s already turning nice and red.�

����������� �He
won�t be sitting on that ass for a while without discomfort� Ann commented,
�and that�s good.� He�ll never forget his
place with this family.�

����������� �Give
it to him good, Jordan,
you should see his face each time you hit him,� Nicole said.

����������� �Yeah,
I�ve been messing around too much with the pussy, time to get going.�� Jordan
then began rapidly and firmly bringing the paddle down on me, time and time
again, I jumped, moaned and then finally began crying out loudly from the pain.

����������� �Yeah,
that�s music to the ears,� Jeff said as I reacted to the pain.� �Make him suffer, son, make him suffer.�

����������� After
about five minutes of this brutal beating, Ann finally said, �You�d better
stop, Jordan,
we�ve got three more of us to go.� We don�t
want to send him to the ER.�

����������� �Oh
man, but this is so much fun. Can�t I give him a little more?�

����������� �Three
more, Jordan,�
Jeff said, �you�ll have numerous opportunities to beat
him in the future.�

����������� �All right.�� Jordan�s
voice was etched with disappointment.� He
gave me three hard whacks and I could feel my ass already swelling, tears were
running down my face and I was howling with agony.� I could feel myself panicking with the
thought of the additional beatings being administered by the remainder of the
family, I was hoping for mercy of some sort if not simply that they wouldn�t
kill me.

����������� �I�m
next,� Nicole said gleefully as she got up from the sofa and walked over to
Jordan who handed her the wicked paddle.

����������� �Have
fun, sis.�

����������� �I
will, though I think Mike here is the one having all the fun.� After all, he is getting all the attention.�

����������� I
was trying to hold in my anxiety, but I couldn�t, the fear and the pain was too much.�
�Please, mercy, please, mercy,� I kept repeating as if the mantra was
going to save me.

����������� �Mercy?� I haven�t
even got started.�� Nicole was
incredulous at my pleading.

����������� �I
can�t take it.� I�ll do anything if
you�ll stop.�
����������� Nicole simply laughed at my
pleading.� �You�ll do anything anyway, you don�t have much choice anymore.� What do you think, dear family, should I have
any mercy?�

����������� �Fuck
no,� Jordan
said.

����������� �Watch
your language, Jordan,�
Ann said, as if his use of the word fuck was more outrageous than the fact that
I was naked before them and her son had just beaten the shit out of me. ��And as for mercy, no, go ahead, Nicole, this
is meant to be an unforgiving lesson.� In
fact,� Ann stood up and walked over before me, I was shaking with fright.� �That�s right, shake with fear,
I want you to fear us, to know that the slightest degree of disobedience will
mean punishment.�� Ann slapped me
viciously across the face.� �I don�t want
you every questioning us again.�� Another wicked slap.�
�Do not ever ask for mercy again.��
She slapped me again, her sadistic nature seemingly flaring up under the
situation.� �Give him five hard ones now,
darling.�� 

����������� �Sure, mom.�� Nicole
let loose with the paddle and a struck my aching ass five times, I could feel
myself getting wobbly and about to pass out.�
Ann had returned to the sofa, I could see her crossed over leg bouncing
up and down once again as was her mannerism when agitated.� �He�s getting purple back here.�
����������� �Good,� Jeff said, �keep
going, hun.�

����������� �With pleasure.��
Nicole began paddling me again, and sure enough, the pain became
overwhelming and I lost consciousness for a moment.� The next thing I knew Jeff was standing in
front of me telling me to wake up.

����������� When
I finally did, he said, �Did you get permission to pass out?�

����������� �No,
Sir,� I gasped.

����������� �Then
why did you do it?�� I could see a grin
starting on Jeff�s face when he looked back to the family as if he knew the
question was impossible to answer.

����������� �I�m
sorry, Sir.�� I was totally devastated.

����������� �Since
you are such a pussy, I guess that Mistress and myself
aren�t going to be able to fully enjoy ourselves.�

����������� �I�m
disappointed in you, slave� Ann said as she got up from the couch.� She walked behind me and chuckled, �He�s
beginning to bleed too.� We�ll have to
stop.�� Yes�I felt relief that the
paddling might have been over.

����������� �I�m
sorry, dear,� Jeff said to his wife.

����������� �It�s
okay, we�ll just have to play the crab game.�

����������� Panic
began again.� Not the crab game; despite
my fear, I knew to say nothing.� �Good
idea.� Jeff began untying my arms.

����������� �What�s
the crab game?� Nicole asked.

����������� �You�ll
see soon enough.�� Jeff had quickly
untied me.� �Assume the position.�

����������� I
was stiff and in pain and it was difficult to move, yet I creakily assumed the
position, my crotch available and naked before the entire family.� �Too cool,� Jordan
said as his mother lined up.� �I can�t
believe my parents are so fucking mean.�

����������� �Language,
 Jordan,� Ann said
curtly.� She took her foot and gave a
quick thrust to the testicles.� The small
movement bringing further agony as I yelped before squirming with pain as
everyone laughed.

����������� �Ah,
what�s the matter, piggie, does that hurt?�� Nicole said.

����������� Jeff
then took a kick and said, �You�d better not pass out on me again, Mike.�

����������� I
screamed with agony and gasped for breath from his hard kick as Ann put her
foot directly on my face to hold me down for the next kick from her
husband.� Again, the pain was searing and
I wanted to vomit it hurt so much as laughter from my
tormentors echoed in the background of my agony.

����������� �All right, your turn, Ann.�
It�s almost time for your television show and I�m sure you don�t want to
miss it, even though this is a lot of fun.�

����������� �True
dear, we could TIVO it, but there will be plenty of time to torment Mike in the
future.�� Ann and Jeff switched places,
Jeff planting his big foot right on my face as Ann positioned herself at my
crotch.� �Just a couple
of kicks, Mike,� Ann said pleasantly, �no big deal.� I�m feeling kind at the moment.�

����������� No
big deal? Kind?�
�What do you say?� Jeff barked at me.

����������� �Thank
you, Mistress for your kindness.�

����������� �You�re
welcome.�� Then came
the kick, which was anything but kind.�
Then one more kick with Jeff lifting his foot off of me after it which
signaled that my punishment was finished.

����������� �Slave,
thank each of us for your first Family Night punishment,� Jeff told me as he
embraced Ann and kissed her.� Ignoring
me, I kissed his feet then hers as they kissed each other, then I crawled over
to Nicole and Jordan and kissed their feet and thanked them.� �What do you think, kids, did you like that?�

����������� �That
was way cool, dad,� Jordan
said.

����������� �No
kidding, I don�t think I could ever get tired of doing that,� Nicole said.

����������� I
was completely spent and my entire body ached from the beatings and
kicking.� I wanted nothing more than to
go to sleep and forget what my life had become now that I worked for the Moore
family.� But I had work
to do, cleaning, putting things away and continued waiting upon the family as
they requested snacks and drinks.� Since
starting with the household, everyone, particularly the children, left clothes
and trash everywhere as it was expected that I would quickly clean up after
them.� The job seemed endless and I felt
I was deep into whatever hole I had created for
myself.� I seldom went home and my son
was growing more concerned with my extended absences even though it meant he
had the apartment for himself. 

����������� Monday
offered a surprise when after serving the family dinner, Jeff announced that he
was going to let me go home that evening, and it was going to be as soon as I
cleaned up.� I quickly performed my
duties and was ready to leave before seven.�
The family was in the front room when I kneeled before Jeff and asked to
be dismissed.

����������� �May
I now leave, Sir?������������ 

����������� �Did
you get all your work done?�

����������� �Yes, Sir.�

����������� �All right.�� Jeff
then reached into his back pocket and pulled out his wallet.� �I want you to buy a couple of hamburgers or
something for you and your son.�

����������� Jeff
was being almost normal and kind, I had an inkling of what was up.� Jeff held up the money, �I haven�t paid you
lately, have I?�

����������� �No,
Sir.�

����������� Jeff
then threw some of the money on the floor.�
�Pick it up�with your mouth.�

����������� I
crawled around on the carpet picking up the twenty dollars that Jeff had thrown
on the floor, two fives and ten singles.�
Jordan and Nicole were laughing as I scrambled to pick up the money as
they yelled at me to hurry up.� I kept
dropping the bills as I wasn�t able to keep all the money in my mouth and this
irritated Jeff.� �What kind of gratitude
is that, dropping my hard-earned money on the ground?� Pick it up!��
Jeff snapped.

����������� I
was trying my best to cram the dirty wad of cash in my mouth when Jeff jumped
up from the couch as a riding crop magically appeared in his hand.� It seemed anymore that in the Moore
household a crop was always at hand.� He
snapped it onto my deeply bruised ass and I howled with pain, again my
suffering punctuated by more laughter.�
�Get out of here, fuckhead.�� I started to crawl out of the room.� �One other thing, your son is out of a
job.� We�ve got one here for him.� I expect you to follow through with this.�

����������� �Sir,
my son?...Please�.�

����������� Jeff
slapped my face.� �Are you going to
dispute my authority again?�� Another slap.� �Don�t
you ever learn?�

����������� Both
blows smarted greatly and I felt like he had left an imprint of his hand on my
face.� There was no use in arguing, and
with all the video evidence they now held against me, I felt it was better to
let Jonathon witness my situation rather than the entire world being witness to
what I had become at the hands of the Moore
family.

����������� I
stopped and bought a couple of hamburgers with the money Jeff had given
me.� Arriving at my apartment, I was
depressed to see the deteriorating condition of the building.� I entered the apartment.� Jonathon was sitting on our used couch,
watching television and drinking a diet soda.�
He was quite surprised to see me.�
�Dad, what are you doing here?��
He looked upset, almost like he had been crying.�� I knew that Jonathon was a sensitive boy, and
it wouldn�t have surprised me if he had been in tears.

����������� �I
got the day off a little early.�

����������� �Oh.�� Jonathon was disappointed.� �I thought maybe that you had
quit�though��� Jonathon drooped his head in sadness.�
�It�s probably good that you didn�t���
His voice trailed off and I knew what he was about to say.� �I got fired today.�� He was ready to cry.� �I don�t know why, I really needed that job
for college.�

����������� �I�m
sorry to hear that, Jonathon.�� Reeling
in my mind were the thoughts of the future and what Jeff and his family wanted
me to do.� I would hope that they would
be a little easier on him, let him witness his dad�s degradation rather than be
a part of it.

����������� �What
am I going to do?� I need that money for
school.� Do you have enough to help me?�

����������� �I�m
sorry, but with my Joann�s alimony, child support for her daughter and the
massive cut in income of late, I don�t. �You know I would help if I had it.�� Yes, it was true, I had agreed to pay Joann
child support even though her daughter wasn�t my child and her daughter was
nearly twenty-one.� By the time she
turned of age and the support was due to stop, the money from my savings would
be completely gone.� It was a stupid, and
now I see, a submissive act to agree to such a thing, but it seemed a simpler
solution to a nasty divorce at the time.�
Money I could have used for my own son was being drained to pay for
Joann�s daughter.

����������� �I
know dad.�

����������� I
looked at my son.� He was tall and lanky,
a little bit of an acne problem, smart, not socially graceful.� If I was to be honest, he was a nerd, and I
couldn�t believe it, but I was ready to take the plunge, I had to please my owners.� �Jeff was just asking if I knew anyone that need a job.� What
about that?�

����������� �Jeff?� He wants both of us to work for him?�

����������� �Well,
he didn�t say you specifically,� I lied, �but I�m sure he would at least talk
to you about it.�� 

����������� Jonathon
was staring at my face.� �Is that a mark
on your face?�
����������� I turned red with
embarrassment.� �I don�t think so, I did bump the door of my car getting into today.�

����������� Jonathon
didn�t exactly buy it, but I had been so different since serving the Moores that I don�t think anything
would have surprised him.� �Would he
expect me to put in the same kind of hours?�
How much would I get paid?�

����������� �I
don�t know anything about the details; you�ll have to get that from Jeff.�

����������� �Well,
I really need the money.� I can�t even
play golf for free anymore.�� Jonathon
shook his head.� �I just don�t understand
it, why did they have to fire me.� They
wouldn�t give me a good reason.�

����������� �I
don�t know, son, sometimes things just don�t work out the way you expect.�

&nbsp;

I was at the Moore
household at five a.m.� The house was a total mess and I worked
quietly until it was time to serve everyone their breakfast.� After serving the twins, I entered the master
bedroom, an apt term in this household, knelt down and held up the tray with
their breakfast and coffee.� I was nude
as I only wore clothes when around visitors,
otherwise, I was expected to be naked.� I
had already awakened Jeff and Ann by sucking on their toes as I did every
morning before I fixed their breakfast.

����������� As
usual, I held the tray as they ate and talked to each other as if I wasn�t
there.� I had become somewhat of an
object to them, a convenience and except for giving orders or punishing me, they paid little attention to me.� After about ten minutes, Jeff addressed
me.� �What did he say?�

����������� �I
believe he will call you today, Sir.�

����������� �You
believe?�� Jeff shook his head in
disgust.� �He�d better is all I�ve got to
say.�

����������� �Yes, Sir.�
����������� �You disgust me.� Get out of here before I decide to beat your
ass.�

����������� I
quickly crawled out knowing that my bruised bottom needed relief, not further
punishment.� The rest of the morning was
uneventful as I continued my household duties without further trauma to my body
as everyone was off doing their own thing.�
I enjoyed the solitude and doing my menial chores without fear of
punishment.� Dinner time finally arrived,
Jeff and Ann before coming home a half hour before I served them their
meal.� The twins were still off with
friends and I was enjoying my daylong reprieve from them.� About halfway through serving the meal, as I
was pouring more water for Ann, Jeff cheerily said, �Guess what, Mike, I
received an interesting phone call.�

����������� I
didn�t say anything, but from the glee in his voice and the look on his face, I
figured it had been Jonathon.

����������� �Aren�t
you interested in the call?�

����������� �Of
course, Sir, may I ask who called?�� I
asked in my most polite tone of voice.

����������� �Why
of course you can ask, stupid.� It was
Jonathon.� Funny thing, he told me he
lost his job and couldn�t understand why.�
God, he sounded pathetic, just like his old man.�� In a mocking, whiny voice Jeff
continued.� �Do you think you might have
a job for me, Mr. Moore,� he sniveled, �my dad said you might have something
for me.�

����������� Ann
was grinning at her husband.� �What did
you tell him, dear?� Do you?�

����������� �Well
first, I had to teach him a little respect.�
Do you have a job for me, sir,� I told him, it was great listening to
the loser repeat it back with the sir.�
We�ll have him trained in no time, won�t me, Mikey?�

����������� �I
suppose, Sir.�� I was regretting the
decision to get Jonathon involved in this though I kept telling myself I had no
choice.

����������� �Don�t
worry, we�ll go slow in the beginning.� Let him get accustomed to the idea of being a
slave, though it didn�t take long for you to figure out your place in life, did
it?�

����������� �No,
Sir, it didn�t.�

����������� �No,
it didn�t you slimy, foot-licking piece of crap.� Hurry and clean up this mess, your son will
be coming over soon for his interview.�

����������� �Tonight, Sir?�
����������� �That�s right, slave,
tonight.�

����������� I
couldn�t believe this was already happening, Jonathon was a gentle person and
with this family I knew he would be kneeling next to me in no time.� It was going to be horrendously embarrassing
for me for him to witness my situation and the only thing I was thankful for at
the moment was the twin�s absence and that they wouldn�t have a chance to start
in on him.� Seven
 o�clock rolled around, the doorbell rang and Ann gleefully called
out for me to answer it; I knew it was Jonathon not only because no was
expected and Ann sounded too happy as normally an unexpected doorbell ring
would have pissed her off.

����������� I
was now dressed and glumly walked to the door.�
Standing there was Jonathon.� He
was dressed in his �interview� clothes:�
black slacks, white dress shirt, a cheap tie, polished
dress shoes.� �Hi, you decided to give it
a try?�

����������� �Yeah,
there isn�t a lot of jobs around for my age right
now.� And, Jeff,
said that he would work around my schedule and might eventually work into
something for the future, even post college.�

����������� Yes,
it certainly could, I pondered, but not the way Jonathon was thinking.� �It�s Mr. Moore, not Jeff, Jonathon,� I
reminded him, knowing that the Moore�s
could hear our conversation.

����������� �He
does have a couple of businesses that are very successful, right?�

����������� Unlike
you, dad, I�m sure he wanted to add.�
�Yes, Mr. Moore is quite successful,� I agreed.� I looked at my watch.� Seven o� three.� Hurry up.��


����������� Jonathon
looked at me strangely.� �It�s only a
couple of minutes after seven, dad.�

����������� I
nodded and said impatiently, �Take off your shoes and follow me.�

����������� �Mr.
and Mrs. Moore, Jonathon is here.�� I led
Jonathon to the family room where Ann and Jeff were lying on the sofa watching
television, neither bothered to pay attention to us.

����������� �Have
him wait in the office.�

����������� �Yes, Sir, Mr. Moore.��
I led Jonathon into the downstairs office.� There were the usual two chairs, one behind
the desk, one next to it.

����������� Jonathon
whispered to me, �Boy, dad, you�re so formal with them.� Mr. Moore?�
Sir?�

����������� It
was only the beginning, I�m sure my son could sense my anxiousness.� �Like you want to be, I�m their
employee.� It�s a matter of respect.� Wait here and don�t be impatient.�

����������� �Okay.�

����������� �And
don�t touch anything.�� I left the room
and went out to where my owners were lazing back on the sofa.

����������� Jeff
looked up and crooked his finger at me.�
When I got in front of him, he quietly said, �Kneel.�� I knelt in front of him fearing that Jonathon
might come out of the office and see me, but I had no choice but to obey my
Master.� Jeff smiled evilly at me.� �Everything in order?�

����������� �Yes, Sir.�

����������� Jeff
held up his sock clad foot for me to kiss.�
�Good.� Go do your work and we�ll
call you when needed.� Be sure to listen
closely for us.� In fact, I want you by
the door, discreetly, listening to our conversation.� You actually have permission,
no make that a command, to eavesdrop.�

����������� �Yes,
Sir,� I said, kissing Jeff�s other foot.�
I went back to work as Ann and Jeff watched television and made Jonathon
wait.� It was seven-thirty before they
left the couch to talk to Jonathon, they had already made him wait over
twenty-five minutes and I was a little surprised that he hadn�t come out of the
office to see what was taking so long.�
Ann and Jeff went into the office and I snuck along outside where I
could hear, but not be seen.

����������� �Hello,
Jonathon,� Jeff said.

����������� �Hi,
thanks for giving me the interview.�

����������� �Sure.� That�s my chair, Jonathon, sorry, but you are
going to have to stand for this, we only have the two seats.�

����������� �No
problem, Jeff.�

����������� Oh
no, not Jeff.

����������� �Uh,
Jonathon, it�s Mr. Moore and Mrs. Moore.�
This is a professional situation.�
I know we�ve known each other a long time, but we don�t forget that this
is a real job we�re talking about.�

����������� �Okay,
I understand.�� Jonathon stuttered.

����������� �Yes,
Sir, is better.�

����������� �Yes
Sir,� Jonathon quickly agreed.

����������� �Mike
get in here,� Jeff yelled.

����������� I
quickly ran in.� Jeff was sitting at his
desk, his feet up on it, Ann in the chair, legs crossed, looking on with
amusement as Jonathon stood before the couple, Jonathon looking frightened.� �Yes, Sir, Mr. Moore?�

����������� �I�m
thirsty.� Get me some water.� Anything for you, honey?�

����������� �No
thanks, dear,� Ann sweetly said to Jeff.

����������� �Go.�� Jeff ordered.

����������� I
quickly fetched the water, putting in a slice of lemon for my Master.� As I sat it down on the desk, I heard Jeff
asking Jonathon why he wanted the job.�
As my son gave a stock answer, Jeff knocked a pen off the desk and onto
the floor as if by accident when reaching for his water.� I was sure it wasn�t an accident.� �Whoops.�
Mike, pick that up.�

����������� �Yes,
Sir,� I answered.� The pen had rolled
under Ann�s crossed over leg and as I bent down to pick it up, Ann made no
effort to move.� As I reached for it,
Ann�s foot was essentially on my back, a quick symbol of my status and
demonstration for my son. �Here you are, Sir,� I said handing him the pen.� �Anything else?�

����������� �Yes,�
Ann said, �I decided I would like a glass of water.�� She arrogantly snapped her fingers and said,
�Hurry up!�

����������� �Yes,
Ma�am,� I said, turning red with embarrassment.�
They weren�t wasting time in demonstrating that I was their lackey.

����������� �All
right, now where were we?� Ann said smugly.�
�You were telling us why we should consider you to work for us.�

����������� I
ran out of the room feeling humiliated and for a moment, thought about
rebelling and getting myself and Jonathon out of there.� But it was too late.� Most of me perversely liked being their
slave, plus there were the tapes.� There
was even a little bit of me that wanted Jonathon to submit to them.� He was of my blood, somewhere in those
genetics there had to be the same desire to submit.� Returning to the room, Ann snapped, �Put it
down there,� as she pointed to a spot on the desk.� �That�s all.�
Leave.�� She continued watching
Jonathon as I retreated from the room and went back to listening.

����������� �You
do understand, Jonathon, that if you take the job, you will not only be working
for me, but for Mrs. Moore and possibly the kids.� You have known Nicole and Jordan for a long
time haven�t you?�

����������� �Yes, Sir, Mr. Moore, since grade school.�

����������� �And
would you have a problem working for them?�

����������� �Uh,
I guess not.�

����������� �You
guess?�

����������� �No,
it shouldn�t be a problem.�

����������� �Maybe
this job isn�t for you.� You don�t sound
positive about it.�

����������� �Oh,
no, Mr. Moore, I�d really like it.� How
much does it pay?�

����������� �Fifteen dollars an hour. But you haven�t convinced me you
are the right person for the job.�

����������� That
was pretty good money for Jonathon and I suspected he might get a thrill out of
working for Nicole.� I didn�t want to
think about what Jordan
might do to him.� �I�ll work real hard,
Mr. Moore.� I�m responsible and honest.�

����������� �You
wouldn�t have a problem picking up our dry cleaning or washing the cars?�

����������� �Oh,
no, Sir, I don�t mind at all.� We all
have to start somewhere.�

����������� �What
do you think, Ann, should we give him a try?�

����������� �Tell
you the truth, honey, I�m not convinced.�
I mean, it would be great to find someone who could eventually work into
our businesses, but I�m not sure that Jon is even capable of fetching us a cup
of coffee.�

����������� Jeff
laughed.� �Oh, come on now, dear, I think
Jonny can manage that and more.� I even have an idea,
maybe we should give him a little test.�
Are you up for that, Jonny?�

����������� Jonathon
hated being called Jonny, and I dreaded what kind of
test Jeff might dream up for him.

����������� �Sure,
Mr. Moore, like what?�

����������� �I�m
sure Mrs. Moore could use something from the grocery store.� We�ll give a little list and see how you
handle it.� I know it doesn�t seem like
much, but it�ll show us how you approach your job.� It will show if you take even the small, dumb
ass tasks seriously, everything is in the details.�

����������� �No
problem, Mr. Moore.�

����������� �Got
something you need, darling?�

����������� �I
suppose.�

����������� �Here
write it down.�

����������� There
was a pause of silence, then, Jeff said.�
�All right, Jonny, here you go.� Here are a few twenties to pay for it.�� 

����������� I
slid into the kitchen before Jonathon came out of the room.� �Hey, dad.� They�re giving me a test,� he said when he
saw me.

����������� �Really?� A test?� I�m sure
you�ll have no problem with it.�

����������� Jonathon
was looking at the list, concern on his face.�
�She wants that?�

����������� I
wasn�t about to ask what that was.� �If
you want the job, just get whatever they want.�

����������� Jeff
and Ann emerged from the office.� �You�d
better get moving, Jonny, time counts.�� Jeff said, displeased to see that he was
talking to me.

����������� �Yes,
Mr. Moore, I�m out the door.�� Jon ran
over and quickly put his shoes on and exited the house.

����������� Jeff
walked over to me and slapped me across the face.� �Did you get permission to talk to him?�

����������� �No,
Sir,� I said, trembling in fear.

����������� He
slapped me again.� �Don�t you think for
one second that you can slack off just because your son is here.�

����������� �No,
Master, I know better.�� I dropped to my
knees and began kissing his feet.�
�Please, Sir, forgive me, please.�

����������� �Head
up.�� 

����������� I
looked up as he gave me another slap.�
�Don�t let it happen again.�

����������� I
returned to my duties while Master Jeff went into the office to do some
business.� Twenty minutes later, Jonathon
returned to the house carrying a couple of bags of groceries.� Ann told him to take the groceries to the
kitchen where she would assess his performance.�


����������� �Take
each item out and place it on the counter,� Ann told him as she stood right
behind Jonathon.� I was dusting in the
living room and watching the proceedings per my owner�s instructions.

����������� Jonathon
took out a bottle of wine, Ann immediately snatched it
up and checked the label.� �Yes, correct
vineyard, but wrong year.�

����������� �But
they didn�t have the year you wanted, Mrs. Moore.�

����������� �I
don�t want excuses Jonathon.� Next time call.� You
do have a cell phone, correct?�

����������� �Yes,
Mrs. Moore, but I don�t have very many minutes on the plan.�

����������� Ann
gave a look of pity.� �Your destitute
father couldn�t afford any, huh?�

����������� I
could see Jonathon glance at me with embarrassment.

����������� �Uh,
it�s not that.�

����������� �Then
what is it?� You�re still in school, correct?� Your dad still helps you financially, doesn�t
he?�

����������� �Not
really, Mrs. Moore.�� Jonathon gave me a
helpless look.

����������� Jeff
returned to the kitchen.� �Jonathon is
back.� How did he do?�

����������� Ann
shook her head.� �He got the wrong wine
for starters.� I told him he should have
called when he couldn�t find the right one, but he mumbled something about not
having enough minutes and that his father doesn�t support him.�

����������� I
wanted to interject that it wasn�t because I didn�t support him, but I knew to
keep silent.

����������� Jeff
kind of laughed.� �True, Mike doesn�t
have much money, that�s why he works for us now.�� Jeff pulled a roll of money out of his
pocket.� �Here you go, son, buy yourself
some minutes.� I want you to do well, I want you to have this job.�� Jeff handed Jonathon some money.

����������� �Geez, Mr. Moore, two hundred dollars?�

����������� �It�s
nothing, Jonny.�
But if something like that happens again, you�ve got to get in touch
with us.� I don�t want you doing anything
on your own.� How did the rest of it
go?� Find everything?�

����������� �Yes, Sir.�

����������� Ann
began pulling out more items.� It was
like the first time I went to the store for her, and I could sense that
Jonathon was nervous.� She held up an
apple.� �Not bad.�� Then she pulled out a few more items that
passed her inspection.� As she neared the
end of the items, I could see that Jonathon was beginning to relax.� Then Ann suddenly stopped and shook her head
like she had discovered dog shit in the bag.�
�What is this?�� Ann held up a box
of tampons.� 

����������� �It�s
the tampons, you asked for, Mrs. Moore,� Jonathon stuttered.

����������� She
made him buy tampons, embarrassing, and not a surprise.

����������� �No,
it�s the wrong kind.� Right
brand, yes, but wrong kind.�� Ann
looked perturbed.

����������� �I�m
sorry, Mrs. Moore.�

����������� Jonathon
was a pathetic as me, I could see that Ann was
enjoying this.

����������� She
waved him off dismissively.� �That�s okay, your father will return them and get the right
ones.� At least he knows how to do that
right.�

����������� �Okay,
Jonathon, give Mrs. Moore and me a moment to talk this over.�� They went into the office.

����������� Jonathon
looked at me.� �They�re picky, huh dad?�
����������� I just nodded my head fearing
to speak.� There were a few awkward
minutes before the couple came back out of the office.� �Congratulations, Jonny,
you�ve got the job,� Jeff said.

����������� �But
you are on probation.� Too many mistakes
and you�ll lose the job.�

����������� �I
understand, Mrs. Moore.�

����������� �We�ll
see.�

����������� Jeff
said, �I want you to come to my Valley office tomorrow.� Nine o�clock
sharp, we�ll get started.�
����������� Jonathon actually looked
happy.� �Thank you, I will work hard for
you.�

����������� �Oh
you will,� Ann said ominously, �Harder than you can imagine.�

����������� With
that, Jonathon left the house, saying he�d see me later.� After he was gone, I was summoned to the feet
of my Masters.� �It won�t be long, shithead, until he�s kneeling right beside you, kissing our
feet, begging for our mercy.� He�s such a
fuckn� loser, just like his old man,� Jeff said.

����������� I
didn�t say anything as I questioned my existence.

����������� �So,
what is your son?� Jeff asked.

����������� I
knew what he wanted me to say.� �Please,
Sir, not my son.�

����������� Jeff
smacked me on the back of my head.� �You
know better.� Say it.�

����������� �My
son�is a�loser.�

����������� �Again,
shithead,� Ann said.�
�Without hesitation.�
����������� �My son is a loser.�

����������� �No
doubt about that,� Ann agreed.� �I wonder
if he�ll like eating our toe jam as much as you, slave,� Ann continued,
bringing her toes up to my mouth to kiss and suck.� �Maybe we�ll have a weekend where you two
will live off of nothing but our family�s body fluids.� Spit, sweat, piss, toe
jam, all things lovely.� Would you like
that, shithead?�

����������� �I
guess, Mistress.� 

����������� �You�re
not lying to me, are you, slave?�

����������� �No,
Mistress, it would be an honor to receive that from you.�

����������� �Whatever.
Finish your chores, then go home.� Bond with your fellow
slave.�� Ann laughed.� �This is going to be so good.� Wait till the twins get a hold of him.�

����������� Arriving
back at our depressing apartment, Jonathon was watching a baseball game on
television, still wearing his �interview� outfit.� �So, what did you think?�

����������� �It
was a little weird and kind of embarrassing, but it�s a job and I need the
money.�� Jonathon brightened a little as
he held up the money Jeff had given him.�
�Two hundred dollars, that was really generous of him.�

����������� �Yes,
the Moores
can be a little intense and I guess generous too.�� I looked at the money in Jonathon�s hand and
knew it was just another way for Jeff to put me down.

����������� �They
seem to have you hopping around a lot.�
It�s kind of a menial job.�

����������� �Yes,
it�s menial.� But like you said, it�s a
job.� I�m old, Jonathon, not formally
educated, I take what I can get at the moment.�

����������� �But
you�re a good writer.� You used to be so
successful.� Now, look at you, returning
tampons for Mrs. Moore.� And, what�s with this Mr. and Mrs., we�ve known them forever.�

����������� �They
are trying to keep things professional.�
Look, I work for them, that�s the
situation.� Mr. Moore is generous enough
to give you a job that pays pretty well, so I would do my best to keep it.� Besides, you�ll probably get a chance to hang
out with Nicole, she�s a real hottie.�

����������� �I�m
a little worried about that, she used to be kind of
mean to me in the past.�

����������� �Don�t
worry about it.� Get some sleep, you want to be sharp tomorrow.�

&nbsp;

I was busy hand washing Mistress
Ann�s panties when the doorbell rang.� I
was wearing what was now my �uniform� for regular visitors:� black slacks, white shirt and tie.� I answered the door and standing there was
Ann�s mother, Roselyn.� She looked me up
and down.� �My, you look spiffy.� Ann said she was working on getting you into
more presentable shape.�� Roselyn stepped
into the house.

����������� �Yes,
Mrs. Harrison, I appreciate all she does for me.�

����������� �You
should.� From the sound of it, without
her and Jeff�s generosity you would be out on the street.� Or maybe in jail for back
alimony and child support.�

����������� �Yes,
Ma�am, I�m very lucky.�� Child?� I kept fuming
thinking about Joann�s daughter and the money she had drained from me.

����������� Roselyn
was an elegant and wealthy woman.� In her
Sixties, she had kept herself in good shape, she was thin, her gray hair perfectly
coiffed, always immaculately dressed.�
Today, she was wearing a silk blouse, black slacks, Gucci
loafers on her feet.� Diamonds in her
ears and on her fingers revealed her wealth along with the tailored
clothes.� She was formidable and direct.� She had always been cordial to me, though
typically cold; I never thought she really liked me.

����������� Roselyn
sat on the bench next to the door as Ann came over and greeted her mother.�� �Hi, mom, I�m glad you could make it.� Take off her shoes,� Ann commanded me as she
hugged her mother.

����������� I
knelt down and removed the loafers from Roselyn�s feet as she said, �This must
be quite a come down for you, Mike.� From
being a somewhat successful television writer or whatever it was you did, to
being my daughter�s and son-in-law�s butler.�

����������� �I�m
just grateful to have a job, Mrs. Harrison.�

����������� �I�m
sure you are, dear,� she said, using my shoulder to push herself up from the
bench.� She looked down at me, her blue
eyes cold and penetrating.� �You know,
Mike, I never understood why Ann and Jeff remained friends with you so
long.� I know your kids grew up together,
but still,� she shook her head, �you never were made out of the same stuff that
they are.� They�re smart, successful,
while you were lucky there for awhile.�
Now, you�ve found your true calling I believe.� My husband Richard eats fools like you for
lunch, just as Jeff and Ann have.� Not to
be rude, dear, but we�re superior to you.�
Some are born to rule, others serve.�
Do you understand that?�
����������� By now I had my head bowed and
was staring at the black cashmere socks on her feet.� �Yes, Ma�am.�

����������� �Look
at me when I speak to you!�� I looked up
at her furious eyes.� �You�ll never have
the finer things in life. You will always be less than my family.� The same with your son, I could always tell
he was way outclassed by Nicole and Jordan.�
Look at my shoes that you just took off of my feet.� Gucci loafers.� Do you know how much they cost?�
����������� �Not really, Ma�am.�� Why was she doing this lecture at the door?

����������� �Five hundred dollars.�
Probably more than you make in a week now.� Do you think you�ll be buying a pair of Guccis?�
����������� �No, Ma�am.�

����������� �Of course not, inferior beings do not deserve superior luxuries.�� Roselyn turned to her bemused daughter who
stood there grinning at her mother.�
�Sorry, dear, but I couldn�t help myself.�

����������� �That�s
okay, mom.� Any reminders of his status
are fine with me.�

����������� �Yes, dear.� And how
are the children?�� Ann escorted her mom
to the formal living room where they were going to talk.����� 

����������� �We�re
having tea, Mike,� Ann called back to me where I was kneeling.

����������� �Yes, Ma�am.�� I got
up and raced to the kitchen where I put the water on to boil then brought out
the leather case that held the myriad of teas that Ann kept on hand.� I stood to the side of Roselyn and opened the
case to show her the selection.

����������� �Don�t
stand over my mother,� Ann growled.�
�Kneel, when you present her anything.�

����������� �Yes, Ma�am.�� I knelt
and saw the curious glee in Roselyn�s eyes as she looked down on me with a
bemused smile.

����������� �My,
this is quite the service,� Roselyn said as she decided upon the tea.� �Very respectful, I like that.�

����������� �Mike
is here for anything we want.� In fact,
when we are having our tea, you should have him give you a foot massage.�

����������� �Yes,
that does sound nice, dear.�

����������� �And
if he doesn�t do a suitable job, he will be punished.�

����������� �Punished?� My, my, Mike, it doesn�t sound easy working
for my daughter.�

����������� �She
keeps me honest, Ma�am.�

����������� Both
women had selected their teas and I was dismissed to go fix their drinks.� From the kitchen, I could hear their
conversation.

����������� �So
you really punish him?�

����������� �Yes.� Now, I don�t want you to be shocked by this,
mother, but Mike is a little more than our butler.� He�s more like our servant, you could even
say slave.�

����������� Roselyn
nervously laughed.� �Slave?�

����������� �Yes.� He does anything we tell him to.� And he�s beaten or otherwise punished for
infractions or.�� Ann began laughing.� �If we feel like it.� Sometimes quite severely.�

����������� �Well,
this is quite interesting.� Nicole and Jordan also?�
����������� �Oh yes.� Eventually I hope the entire family will know
of our situation so we can use him for our gatherings.�

����������� �I�m
sure your father would enjoy using him.�

����������� �Of course, mom.�
Anytime you want him, let me know.�
We�re working on his son too.�

����������� �His son.� Oh yes,
what is his name�The few times I met him, he was so plain, so
unnoticeable.� He would be lucky to be Jordan�s
servant.� Maybe he could learn something
from him since his father is so worthless.�

����������� The
tea was done and I returned to serve the beverages.� I knelt in front of the women and offered
them the beverage.� �Well, Mike, Ann has
been telling me that you are her slave.�
����������� �Yes,
ma�am.�

����������� �And
that she beats you.�

����������� �Yes,
she does.�

����������� �You
don�t mind that?�

����������� �Whatever
Mistress Ann wishes to do to me I gladly accept.�

����������� �Mistress
Ann?�� Roselyn laughed loudly.� I was red.�
�I like that.�

����������� �You�re
okay with this?� Ann asked.

����������� �Okay?� I love it, dear.� Like I said a little earlier, it�s obvious Mike is inferior.� Your father is going to love this.� He often talks about how he wished slavery
was still legal.� That
after a hard day at work, how relaxing it would be to come home and whip his
property like in the old days.�

����������� �This
is such a relief.� Slave, massage
Mistress Roselyn�s feet.�

����������� �Yes,
Mistress Ann.�

����������� Roselyn
has her legs crossed and I positioned myself at the end of the crossed foot.

����������� �Make
sure you show her the proper respect and thankfulness for allowing you to touch
her.�

����������� �Yes, Mistress.�� I
kissed Roselyn�s socked feet and said, �Thank you, Mistress Roselyn for allowing
me to serve you.�

����������� �You�d
better do a good job or I�ll have Charles horsewhip you.�

����������� �Yes, Mistress.� May I
ask you a question, Mistress Roselyn?�

����������� �Speak.�

����������� �Would
you like the socks on or off?�

����������� �Off, stupid!�

����������� I
removed her socks, kissing each one in proper homage to her authority.� I began gently massaging her feet.� Though well cared for, they weren�t nearly as
pretty as Ann�s feet.� Roselyn was an
older woman and the wear of age was unavoidable.� The toes were crooked, the skin wrinkled and
they had a moderate aroma, but it was slightly better than massaging Maria�s
feet.� They enjoyed their conversation
and paid no attention to me.� After about
fifteen minutes, Roselyn focused on me again.

����������� �So,
slave Mike,� she pressed the ball of her wrinkly foot on my face, while resting
the other on my shoulder, �how do you like having this old lady�s feet pressed
on your face like you�re a doormat?�

����������� I
wanted to say I didn�t like it at all, but I also wanted to live.� �It�s my pleasure, Mistress.� It�s where I belong.�

����������� Roselyn
looked at Ann with mild shock.� �My
goodness, he is a panty waist.�

����������� �I
know.� It just makes you want to abuse
him more.�

����������� �He
should be wearing a dress since he is such a sissy.�

����������� Ann
laughed.� �That�s a great idea, Mother. A
little dress, some high heels, maybe some lipstick, he�ll be our little sissy.�

����������� �What
do you think of that, panty waist?� Ready to wear a dress?��
Roselyn lifted her foot off my face so I could answer her.

����������� �If you wish me to.�

����������� �Poor
thing, he sounds so sad about his new dress.�
Kiss this old lady�s foot and thank her for the suggestion,� Roselyn
snapped.

����������� I
kissed the bottom of her foot and said, �Thank you, Mistress Roselyn for the
idea of wearing a dress.�

����������� �Mmm, this feels kind of good having your feet kissed.�

����������� �Suck
her toes, slave.�

����������� I
began sucking Roselyn�s old wrinkled toes.�
�What kind of man are you?�� The
sneer in Roselyn�s voice was humiliating.�
�Sucking a grandmother�s toes.� Oh, that�s right, you�re not a man, you�re a sissy.�
You�re going to come over to my house one day, put on your maid�s dress
and serve Charles and me.� I�m sure
Charles will enjoy having you suck his toes too�that is before he whips the
crap out of you, sissy.�

����������� I
didn�t say anything, but kept worshipping her toes.

����������� �What�s
the matter, sissy?� Nothing
to say about that?�

����������� �It
would be an honor to suck Master Charles� toes, Mistress Roselyn.�

����������� �Shouldn�t
a slave be nude before his superiors?�

����������� Ann
looked curiously at Roselyn.� �Gee, mom,
I had no idea you were like this.�

����������� �From
the sound of things, you�re a chip off the old block.� Strip, sissy.�

����������� I
quickly removed my clothes and knelt, naked, at the two women�s feet.� Roselyn could see my battered bottom.� �My, dear, you did mete out some punishment
on the sissy.� Good for you. �You need to keep your chattel on a tight
string.� Lay on your back, sissy.�

����������� I
laid flat before Roselyn who rested her feet on my face.� �At least he�s good for something, like being
my footrest.�� As Roselyn said this, I
could hear the front door clicking open.�
Light shown into the room as the door opened.�� �Is that my dear grandson?� Roselyn
exclaimed as she saw who was there.

����������� �Hi Grandma.�� It was Jordan
and a wave of fear swept over me.

����������� �The
prodigal son returns,� Ann said.� 

����������� �Where
is Mike?� Jordan
asked.

����������� �Over
here, dear�under my feet.�
����������� Jordan
began laughing.� �Grandmother�you
too?�

����������� �Yes,
the whole family seems geared that way.�

����������� Jordan
approached and I started trembling.�
�Goodness, my footstool is shaking.�

����������� �He
should be.�� Jordan
kicked me right in the balls and I yelled and squirmed from the pain.� �That�s for having to take off my own shoes.�

����������� �Hold
still,� Roselyn scolded me.� �And be
quiet.�

����������� �We
need more fucking slaves around here,� Jordan
grumbled.

����������� �Watch
your language�and you might get your wish.�

����������� �What
do you mean, Mom?�� Jordan
sat down at the table and casually rested his feet on my legs like they were
part of the floor, Roselyn�s feet still on my face.

����������� �Do
you remember Jonathon?�

����������� �Who?�

����������� �You
tell him, slave.�

����������� �Jonathon�my
son,� I mumbled quietly.

����������� Jordan
laughed.� �Oh yeah, that�s right, loser
number two.�� I found it hard that Jordan
couldn�t remember a friend that he had grown up with.

����������� �I
think it�s wonderful that Mike and his son are going to be serving our
family.� I�m tired of all this equality
nonsense.�� Roselyn increased the
pressure on my face with her feet as if to emphasize her points.� �The world would be a better place if people
simply accepted their positions in life.�
They wouldn�t be jealous or envious, they would
find it a privilege to serve the upper class.�
Not everyone can be as smart or as good looking as Ann, you Jordan,
Nicole, it�s just a fact.�

����������� The
phone rang, Ann snapped her fingers, �Get it.�� 

����������� I
quickly rolled out from under Roselyn�s feet with a quick, �Sorry, Mistress,�
and retrieved the phone for Ann, then resumed my place as Roselyn�s
footrest.�� From the conversation it was
easy to ascertain that Ann was talking to Jeff.

����������� �How
is it going with your new assistant?�� I
could see Ann grinning at her mother and son with a knowing glee.� �Really?�� Ann laughed.�
After another long pause she said, �This is good.� All right, honey, I love you too.�� She hung the phone and looked down at
me.� �Slave, you�ll be glad to know that Jonny is doing a good job.�
We just might keep him around.�

����������� �Great,
Mistress.�

����������� �Jeff
says he is a real hard worker and very obedient.�

����������� Obedient,
what does that mean?

����������� �Oh
dear look at the time,� Roselyn said, �I should be going.�

����������� �Would
you like to stay for lunch?� Ann asked.

����������� �Not
today, I meeting your father for lunch.� I�ll fill him in on the details of your new
lifestyle.� I�m sure he�ll be interested
in hearing about Mike�he always said that there was something odd about
him.� Was he ever right about that!�� Roselyn lifted
her feet. �Socks.��
I kneeled up and put her socks back on her feet, then crawled after her
and Ann as they walked over to the door where I place the shoes back on
Roselyn�s feet, giving the loafers a kiss of respect as mother and daughter
hugged goodbye.

����������� Ann
was glowing with satisfaction as she shut the front door and strolled back to
the dining table where Jordan
was still sitting.� �I can�t believe how
quickly and easily mom did that.� I would
have never known that she had such a sadistic, dominant streak in her.� Makes me wonder what she and father have been
up to all these years.�

����������� �I
don�t want to think about it,� Jordan
muttered.� �Come here, slave,� Jordan
commanded sharply, �it�s time for your workout.�

����������� I
was hoping that Jordan
had forgotten about his wanting to get me into better condition as I was
certain that he would be brutal on me. I knelt in front of him as Ann took a
seat at the table to watch her son.�
�Give me some squat thrusts to warm up.��
I started the exercise, up and down and it wasn�t long before I was
breathing hard and sweating, my cock and balls bouncing up and down as I
performed the physical exertion.

����������� �Look
at his little penis bounce around,� Ann said with amusement.

����������� Jordan
was laughing.� �Yeah, it�s funny
looking.� Faster, slave!�

����������� I
increased my tempo feeling ridiculous exercising while nude.� Jordan
gave me a couple of slaps on my butt.� �I
said faster, cunt.�
Now move it.�

����������� Now
I was starting to gasp for air and my arms and legs were getting tired from the
effort.� �Up, down, up down.�� Jordan
was trying to keep me on a strict cadence.

����������� �God,
you�re pathetic,� Ann said, �he told you to move it faster.� Do it.�

����������� I
was trying my best to go faster, but the body wasn�t cooperating.� On one of the thrusts, when I was in the push
up position, Jordan
stood up and planted his foot into my back.�
�Give me forty push ups now, old man.�

����������� Forty?� I didn�t think
I would be able to do ten.� I went down
and started to push back up, Jordan�s
foot impeding my already shaky effort as I struggled to finish the first one.

����������� �Damn,
what a sissy.� Mother was right about you
wearing a dress,� Ann sneered.� �Is that
why Joann left you?� Did you wear a dress
for her?�

����������� I
was starting on my third pushup, Jordan�s
foot still on me.� �No, Mistress, I never
wore a dress.�

����������� Jordan
was laughing.� �You�re going to make him
wear a dress?�

����������� �Probably.� Something cute�maybe a little maid�s outfit with high heels.�

����������� �He�ll
look ridiculous,� Jordan
said before standing with his full weight on my back so I couldn�t move.�� �Why did you stop?�

����������� �I�I
can�t move, Sir,� I moaned.

����������� �I�m
getting tired of this.� Besides, if
you�re going to be wearing dresses, you don�t need any muscles.�
����������� �Show Jordan
your gratitude and kiss his feet.�

����������� I
kissed Jordan�s
feet.� �Go fix me a sandwich,� he
commanded.

����������� �Me
too, then get back to work,� Ann snapped.



����������� I did as ordered then resumed my
daily chores, life back to normal as it could be for someone in my position.



&nbsp;

����������� That
evening it was gleefully announced by Ann that Jonathon would be joining the
family for dinner; he would witness my waiting upon the family.� It was another one of those moments when I
seriously thought about running away and disappearing forever, but, as usual, I
knew I would stick around and endure the humiliation that was sure to
come.� I was very nervous preparing
dinner and Ann buzzed around the kitchen eager to get in a few jabs before
Jonathon�s arrival.

����������� �I
wonder what your son is going to think of you after tonight,� she said, as I
handed her a glass of water that she had told me to get for her.

����������� �I
don�t know, Mistress, I can only worry about doing my job, not what he thinks.�

����������� �Good
answer, slave.� I like that.� Who cares what your own child thinks about
you.� You�ve got more important things to
worry about�like my son and daughter.�
It�s funny how that is.� Their
comfort is more important than Jonathon�s comfort.� Isn�t that true?�

����������� �Yes, Mistress.�� 

����������� �I
love the idea of you and your son toiling side by side, working hard to please
the Moore family.� This is going to be great.�

����������� �Yes,
Mistress,� I agreed absently.� Both kids
were home, up in their rooms doing who knows what.� I looked at my watch and saw that it was six, Jeff would be arriving home soon.� As if answering my thoughts, the garage door
opened.

����������� �I
believe the fun is about to begin,� Ann said.�
�Go greet your Master.�

����������� I
took a deep breath and went to the garage entrance to the house, at least
Jonathon would be in his own car, I thought as I watched Jeff pull in his
BMW.� I was shocked to see my son sitting
in the passenger seat, why wasn�t he driving his own car?� I rushed up and opened Jeff�s door for him,
he handed me his briefcase as he got out of the car as Jonathon exited the
other side of the car.

����������� �Hi,
dad,� he said as I followed Jeff to the entrance to the house.

����������� �Hi,�
I muttered, afraid to say anything, though I wanted to ask him how his day was
going.� Jeff stopped at the doorway and I
knelt to remove his shoes, my face bright red with doing this in front of my
son as Jonathon removed his shoes knowing the custom of the Moore
household.� At least Jeff didn�t make me
kiss his feet as he usually did when he came home.

����������� �Do
a better job of polishing them, they weren�t up to par,� Jeff snapped.

����������� �Yes,
Sir,� I said, standing.� I caught a glance
of Jonathon looking at me with dismay and disbelief.

����������� �Let�s
go, Jonny.�

����������� After followed after them as Jeff entered the main room where
Nicole and Jordan were watching television.� Ann came down the stair case and greeted her
husband.� �Hi, honey,� ignoring
Jonathon�s presence, she wrapped her arms around him and gave him a hug.� Jonathon stood awkwardly nearby unsure of
what to do as I returned to the kitchen to finish getting dinner ready.� �What�s he doing here?� Ann asked about
Jonathon.

����������� �I
told him he could have some dinner before finishing up a project that I gave
him, he�s going to use our computer.�

����������� �I
see.� Very generous of
you to feed such a low level employee.�

����������� �I
don�t want his blood sugar to be so low as to cause errors.� Mike will fix him a peanut butter sandwich.�

����������� Ann
smiled at her husband.� �I suppose a
peanut butter sandwich is okay.�

����������� �Did
you hear that Mike?� A
peanut butter sandwich for Jonny.�

����������� �Yes,
Sir,� I said, as I finished preparing the crab legs and boiled potatoes that
the family would be having for their supper.�
How embarrassing for Jonathon to eat peanut butter while the Moores ate like royalty.� I could see how out of place Jonathon felt, and I�m sure any discomfort on his part was welcomed
by the family.

����������� �Jonathon,
you know Nicole and Jordan.�
����������� �Yes, hello,� Jonathon
said.� The twins ignored him and didn�t
answer.

����������� �Go
sit at the kitchen table,� Jeff told Jonathon, �we�ll
have dinner soon.�

����������� �Yes,
Sir,� Jonathon said respectfully before taking a side seat at the table.

����������� �Dinner
is ready, Sir and Madam,� I announced shortly thereafter, sounding like a
butler announcing the service at a formal dinner party.� It took several minutes before the family to
move into the kitchen to eat their dinner.

����������� As
Nicole arrived, she looked at Jonathon sitting at the table and made a
frown.� �What is he doing here?� The help isn�t going to eat with us?�� I could see Jonathon turn red.

����������� �Of
course not,� Jeff boomed, �eat at the other table, Jonny.�

����������� Jon
looked confused and embarrassed as if he wasn�t good enough to be with the Moore
family.� �Oh, okay,� he said, nervously
getting up from the table, then accidentally hitting a glass of water and
knocking it over.

����������� �Geez, you big klutz, look what you did!�� Nicole stared angrily at Jonathon as he
scrambled to wipe up the spilled water.

����������� �Sorry�it�s
just water.�� 

����������� �You
think it�s okay to spill water on our furniture?� Ann
said, as Jonathon and I both wiped up the spill.

����������� �No,
ma�am, nothing like that.� I just meant it wouldn�t stain anything.�

����������� �No,
it might not stain anything, but water can damage wood.� Maybe you don�t care about your things, but
we take care of our home,� Ann scolded.��
�Hurry up and get that dried up!�

����������� It
only took a few seconds to wipe everything up and I was sure Ann was being
dramatic for the show; any opportunity to berate or humiliate was not going to
be passed by.� Jonathon was in a daze and
stood at the table staring at the spot where the water spilt.

����������� Jonathon
was standing next to Jordan�s
chair and as he sat down, he gave a little shove to my son.� �Move, dork, go sit at the
other table before you cause any other problems.�

����������� �Whatever,�
Jonathon said with teenage insolence.� I
knew that this was a big mistake.� Jeff
jumped right in.

����������� �Whatever?
What kind of attitude is that?�
����������� �Fire him now, dad,� Nicole
said, a smirk on her face.

����������� �Is
that what you want, Jonny?� You want me to fire you?�� Everyone was staring at Jonathon who was now
greatly embarrassed.

����������� �No,
I don�t want that.�

����������� �Did
you forget something, Jonny?� Repeat after me, no sir, I don�t want to be
fired, Mr. Moore, Sir.�� Stunned,
Jonathon looked at me for help, but I averted my eyes.� I knew this was a now or never moment and we
would be finding out if son was like father.�
�We�re waiting��� The Moore
family was standing at their places but none had actually sat as they watched
Jonathon.

����������� �Uh�I�d�Uh,
no, Sir, I don�t want to be fired, Mr. Moore, Sir.�

����������� �Well
then you�d better shape up that attitude�also apologize to Jordan
for your rudeness,� Jeff snapped.� �You
didn�t raise your son to be rude to others did you, Mike?�

����������� �No,
Sir,� I promptly answered.

����������� �I�m
sorry, Jordan.�� Jonathon looked shell shocked and confused

����������� �Don�t
let it happen again, dork-face.�� Jordan
slipped into his chair as Jonathon shuffled towards the formal dining table as
Nicole tittered at her brother�s comments.�
Ann and Jeff were also smiling.� I
hated that my son was being called names, but I knew that I was powerless to do
anything.� I also pretty sure that
Jonathon would be joining me soon as their property.� Everyone sat down and I began to serve them
dinner as Jonathon went to eat at the other table.

����������� After
I served the first course of salad, Nicole immediately got on me.� �Mike, I dropped my napkin.�

����������� I
scurried over to Nicole�s side of the table where the napkin laid at her
side.� It would have been quite easy for
her to reach over and pick it up, but that wouldn�t have made for a good show
for Jonathon who could see us from where he was eating his sandwich.� I bent over and picked up the cloth
napkin.� �Would you like a fresh one,
Miss Nicole?�

����������� She
snapped it out of my hand.� �No, this
will do.�� She purposely dropped it
again.� �Oops,� she said sweetly, before
barking out, �pick it up!� I bent over and handed it to her.� �Not this one, stupid, you expect me to use a
dirty napkin?�

����������� �No,
Miss Nicole, sorry, I�ll get you a fresh one.�

����������� Nicole
then addressed the table.� �What the fuck
is wrong with him and his son?� Spilling water, using dirty napkins.�

����������� �They
need training,� Ann said.

����������� �No
shit,� Nicole said, �A lot of it.�

����������� �Jonny, are you about done with that sandwich, you need to
get to work on those flow sheets.�� Jeff
wasn�t giving Jonathon anytime to eat.

����������� �Almost, Sir.�

����������� �Hurry
up, you�re not getting paid to sit around the house.�

����������� �Hurrying, sir.��
Jonathon got up and placed his plate in the sink, his sandwich only half
eaten.

����������� As
Jonathon was walking to the office, Jordan
barked out a couple of commands to me, more cola, more butter and throughout
the meal, it was a constant ring of orders from the four.� I knew that Jonathon could hear them ordering
me about with pure callousness, but at least I wasn�t being physically punished
or made to perform some of the humiliating acts that they enjoyed inflicting
upon me.� So I worked throughout the
evening as usual while Jonathon worked in the office until everyone had retired
to bed except father and son.� That is
when I finally gathered up my nerve and went into the office where Jonathon was
toiling on some boring spreadsheets.

����������� �When
are you going home?� I whispered.

����������� �Why the whisper?� Jonathon asked looking up from the
computer, the glow of the monitor reflecting off of his pale face.

����������� �I
don�t want to disturb anyone, they would be very angry.�

����������� Jonathon
had a painful look on his face.� �They
don�t treat you very well.�

����������� I
nodded my head in sad understanding.�
�True.� You had a difficult night
too.�

����������� Jonathon
nodded along with me.� �Yeah, I couldn�t
believe how they treated me.�

����������� �But
you stayed.�

����������� �I
need the money.�

����������� �Of course.� �Jonathon
could see that I didn�t entirely believe him, I sensed
that same slavish streak within him.�
Just then Jordan
yelled out from the stairs.

����������� �Slave,
where are my high tops?�

����������� Jonathon
looked alarmed at my being called slave.�
�It�s one of Jordan�s
things�you know how he can be.�

����������� �Sure.� I know.�

����������� �I�ve
got to take care of this.�� I ran
upstairs to Jordan�s
room where he had gone back into and laid back on the bed.� He was wearing only his shorts and was
watching Sports center on the television.�


����������� �Where the fuck are my shoes, loser?�

����������� I
raced to the closet and pulled them out where they were always kept, �Here,
Sir.�

����������� Jordan
stared at the television for a moment then lazily sat up.� �Put them on the end of the bed, stick your
nose in them as you bend over and pull down your pants and shorts.�

����������� �Sir�please�my
son might hear.�

����������� �Fuck
that, I don�t care.� Hurry up before I
get more agitated.�

����������� �Yes, Sir.�� I quickly
pulled down my pants and underwear to my ankles, bent over and stuck my nose in
one of Jordan�s
smelly basketball shoes.

����������� Jordan
pulled his belt out of his shorts.� He
could have used a paddle that was nearby or a riding crop that was in the
closet, but he enjoyed the drama of removing his belt.� �You�re going to get a whipping, boy, next time
I want my shoes where they belong.�

����������� �Yes, Sir.�� Arguing
was impossible and I braced myself for the pain.� Jordan
thrashed me for about five minutes leaving me red before he decided I had
enough.� When he was done, he simply
pointed at the ground where I knelt and kissed his feet and thanked him for my
punishment.�� �I should have you send Jonny up here for being rude to me tonight, but it will
wait until another night.� Dad said I
couldn�t tonight.�

����������� Jordan
had his foot planted on the nape of my neck as I kissed his other foot.� �Yes, Sir,� I mumbled into his bare foot.

����������� �Get
the fuck out of my sight, old man.�

����������� I
quickly went back downstairs, Jonathon was still working.� I couldn�t decide whether to go in there and
see if he heard anything, I finally decided to check him out.� �Hey, you must be beat.�� After I said those words we both knew what a
Freudian slip I had said.

����������� Jonathon
looked up at me with distress.� �I think
you�re the one who is beat.�

����������� �Yeah,
I�m tired.� I�m going to go to bed.�

����������� Jonathon
let it drop.� �Goodnight.�

����������� �Go
home.�

����������� �I�m
staying the night.� Jeff said I could
sleep here.�

����������� �Oh,
okay.�� They weren�t wasting anytime on
their indoctrination of Jonathon.� I
wasn�t sure where I was going to sleep.�
Normally, I would have just gone out into the garage and slept on the
air mattress that Jeff allowed me to sleep on, but he hadn�t specifically said
I needed to stay and I didn�t really want Jonathon to see me sleeping in the
garage.� I decided to maintain the
tiniest thread of dignity I had remaining and went home to sleep in the crummy
apartment.� Somehow I sensed my days
sleeping there were about over.
