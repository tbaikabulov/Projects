Synopsis: Young girl seeks help from the father of her friend - only to find herself prey for his vengeance.         






The rain was washing against the window shutters as it had for the last couple of 
days. The cold and depressing weather added to the hopeless mood that Mark 
Cockwidth was filled with. He was sitting in his kitchen wondering whether he should 
again drown his sorrows with a bottle of vodka as he had done some days ago. Not 
that this had been the first time � he had done this too often during the last months, 
much too often since his wife has left him. 


His glance locked again with the slim, clear bottle which was sitting on the table. It 
urged him, whispered silent promises of easy oblivion. But he still resisted. He did not 
want to become a captive of alcohol, one of those run-down figures he had always 
despised all his life. This would certainly be the last triumph for both his wife and his 
daughter to see him becoming a worthless piece of junk, living from the refuse of 
society, begging for a piece of money to buy some cheap booze, himself nothing 
more than a reject of humanity. He felt again the hatred creeping up in him, like he 
had felt it the last year when Dorothy and Susan had tried to top each other in the 
insults they showered him with. Why? He had never understood. They had been 
such a very happy family. Of course, he had to work quite a lot to pay for the house, 
to cover up all their depts. and to allow them a good standard of living. At times he 
had worked up to fourteen hours a day, even on the weekend. But he had done it for 
them. And what for, after all? To be left alone when he thought that the worst was 
over. Most of their debts had been paid back; the house was his after all. And during 
all this time, his wife has had a lover, some greasy, slimy piece of shit. He had never 
suspected anything. And his daughter had known it! The three of them had played 
happy family during all the time when he was struggling for a living. Visiting nice 
restaurants, going to the movies � even some short weekend trips. How sarcastic 
both had been when they finally told him. Told him what a looser he was, what an 
idiot! He could have killed them both at this moment. But he had done nothing. Had 
only listened without understanding. 


The bottle was still there, luring him, calling to him. He was fighting with himself, 
loosing, loosing every second a little bit more. Soon, he knew, he would fetch himself 
a glass and then the next morning he would be lying totally drunk in the kitchen. But 
who cares? It would be Saturday anyway. No need to go to the office. No need to 
face the pitying glances of his colleagues. His hand reached out for the bottle. 
The sharp sound of the door bell interrupted his move. His glance fell at the big 
kitchen watch that was hanging on the wall. It was almost eleven pm. Fuck off! He 
didn�t expect anybody at this time. Actually, he didn�t expect anybody at all ringing at 
his door. He wanted to be alone, alone in his misery, undisturbed by the outside 
world. His hand reached for the bottle. The bell was ringing again. This time more 
urgently, two � three times. With a deep sigh he started for the door. 
The bulb of the lamp outside the door had been broken some time ago, so his eyes 
took some time to adjust to the dark. The figure outside was small, and at a second 
glance he decided that it must be a young girl that was standing there. Here long wet 
hair was sticking to her face, she was wearing a green, washed-out parka, jeans and 
short boots. On her back she was carrying a small back-pack; her arms clutched 
firmly a bulging plastic bag. Frightened she starred at Mark Cockwidth. 


�What do you want?� Mark uttered unfriendly 
�Mr. Cockwidth? Can I speak to Susan?� 
�Who are you? What are you doing here in the middle of the night?� 


Mark Cockwidth eyed the girl suspiciously. She looked raggedly, uncombed, 
desperate. �Please, I have to speak to Susan. I�m Mary. Mary Fisher. Please. Me and 
Susan had been friends. Don�t you remember me?� 




The girl looked at him with pleading eyes. Yes, he remembered her now. She had 
lived only some streets away, and she and Susan had played quite often together. 
But then, some years ago, Mary�s parents had moved to another town and he had 
not seen her since. He eyed her again. Some dark desire was building up inside him, 
a means to satisfy the urges of hatred and revenge. �Come in�. He closed the door 
behind her. Now, in the light of the room he could observe her much better. She was 
surely in a pitiable state. She must have been in the rain and cold for the whole day, 
soaked to the skin, her body trembling, the lips blue. 

�You still did not explain what you were doing in the middle of the night outside, 
looking the way you are. Do your parents know that you�re here?� 
The girl defiantly kept her mouth shut. �Listen, if you don�t explain yourself, I�ll call the 
police. Do you want that?� Mary�s glance went nervously to the door, but Mark has 
positioned himself between the door and the girl, to make any escape impossible. 
Desperately she shook her head. �No, please�. �You�ve run away from home?� It was 
more of a statement than a question. The girl nodded. �Why have you come here?� � 
�I don�t really know. I was wandering around and suddenly I remembered this town. I 
thought of Susan and that we had been close friends. I thought maybe she could 
help me �� � �So, nobody knows that you�re here?� � The girl shook her head. 
�Susan�s currently not at home so she can�t help you. But I won�t fiddle in you affairs. 
I can only give you the advice to return to your parents. But if you don�t want � It�s 
your life. For the time being, if you need some help � Do you want something to 
eat?� He led the girl to the kitchen. �Take off your coat and shoes and put your bags 
somewhere. No need to carry them around. Nobody will carry them away�. Mark 
grinned. He was feeling better and better every second. He took a glass and filled it 
with Coke and vodka. �Here, drink this. This will warm you.� The girl grimaced but he 
urged her to drink the glass. Under her coat she was wearing only a thin sweater that 
was also completely soaked. It was clutching at her skin and clearly showed the slim 
form of her body and the small, firm breasts. If she was the same age as Susan, she 
must now have fifteen years. Shivering she sat on the kitchen chair, trying to get 
warm. Water was dripping from her long, black hair and she rubbed her cold feet at 
each other. Pleadingly she looked at Mark. �You won�t call my parents? Please, I 
don�t want to go back�. Mark smiled �I promise. I won�t tell anybody that you�re here. 
As I said, it�s your life.� The girl had finished her drink and was looking at Mark with 
some newfound hope. 

�Now I propose that you will take a hot bath so that you get warm again. In the 
meantime I�ll prepare something to eat for you�. Mark guided her to the bathroom on 
the first floor and opened the taps. Hot water was streaming in the tub. The bathroom 
was small, one basin in the front, the tub to the right and the toilet at the back. Mary 
was plunging heavily on the small stool standing in the middle of the bathroom. 
Obviously, the alcohol was taking its toll. �I�ll leave you now. Take your time�. Mark 
left the bathroom and closed the door. Outside he immediately kneeled and peeked 
through the keyhole. He could not see much, only that the girl started to undress. But 
just the glimmer of her naked flesh was sufficient to make his cock rock-hard. It took 
all his will to restrain himself. When he heard her entering the bathtub, he left to look 
for some towels and a bath robe, giving him a good excuse to enter the bathroom 
again. Mary turned red when he suddenly stood before the bathtub, smiling broadly. 
She firmly closed her legs and hid her chest with crossed arms. �Here, I�ve brought 
you some towels and a bathrobe of Susan. Hope it fits. I�ll put your clothes into the 
washing machine. Take your time. I�ll wait for you in the kitchen�. He was grinning 
inwardly. The bathrobe had already been too small for Susan two years ago, that 
was the reason why it was still here. And Susan was a little bit smaller than this girl. 
Should be a quite exciting picture. 



He hurried back to the kitchen. The fridge was almost empty: Some slices of bread, a 
bit of cheese and a couple of eggs were the only inhabitants that were still in a 
consumable state. Some time later the eggs were frizzling in the pan, and the table 
was prepared with a bottle of wine for his special guest. He had used quite an 
amount of salt and pepper on the eggs, so the girl would become quite thirsty. Mark 
was getting impatient. �Mary, the meal�s getting cold! Please come down� Mark went 
upstairs and knocked on the bathroom door. �Mary! Everything OK?� � �Yes. I�m 
almost finished. I�m coming�. The girl hurried up and Mark heard the buzzing sound 
of the hair dryer starting. 

Mark was waiting in the kitchen when Mary finally appeared in the doorstep of the 
kitchen, nervously trying to hide her body in the much too small bathrobe. Its lower 
border was just reaching to the middle of the thighs, the sleeves were much too short 
and jamming the forearms and Mary had to hold the front close with both hands so 
that it would not expose her breasts. With every move the robe parted at her hips and 
Mark could see a glimpse of her black pubic hair. Mark pretended not to notice and 
guided her to the chair at the top of the table. He himself took place left to her. �I�ve to 
apologize that I don�t have much to offer to you. I didn�t expect any guests. I hope 
that you like the wine. I�ve reserved it for a special moment.� Mark studied the girl 
attentively. Her long black hair that was a nice contrast to her white skin. Her body 
was slim, fragile and her dark eyes were emphasized by the deep by the dark circles 
around them. It must have been quite some time since she had been sleeping in a 
soft bed and eaten a decent meal. 

The girl attacked the plate fervently and wolfed down all the food with a great 
appetite. Even if she didn�t like the wine too much � Mark told her that regrettably, no, 
he didn�t have any juice or mineral water any more � thirsty as she was she drank too 
much of it. After some time she started to giggle and laugh about Marks silly jokes, 
and did not pay attention on the bathrobe any more that was now diverging widely, 
clearly showing her little, firm breasts and her slim, young body. 

Mark couldn�t wait any longer. �Now let�s go to bed�. Mary tried to rise from the chair 
but immediately dropped back, giggling foolishly. Mark approached her and reached 
for her arm. �Let me help you�. He put his right arm around her waist and guided her 
to the stairs up to the bedroom. Her warm, young body amplified his arousal and he 
almost pushed her to the big bed, immediately locking the door. Watching him 
undress had a sobering effect on the young girl. Horrified she stared at him, sliding to 
the most distant corner of the bed, fervently closing her legs and clutching the 
bathrobe. �What are you doing? I don�t want that! Please leave me alone.� she 
stammered, her voice showing almost no sign of drunkenness any more. Mark 
grinned sardonically. �I�ve been nice too you, now it�s your turn to be nice to me.� He 
approached the bed, his cock standing straight erect, pre-cum already dripping from 
its tip. With his right hand he grabbed the girl who was trying to move away at her 
bathrobe and pulled her next to him. �And I advise you to be very nice� Mary 
struggled in his hold and tried to push him away. Mark gave her a light slab into the 
face. Than he grabbed her by the hair and shacked her head roughly from left to 
right. �You want to fight? I�ll beat you senseless, you little slut and fuck you anyway!� 
He tossed her back to the mattress and yanked her out of the bathrobe. Before she 
could react he was over her, pinning her arms firmly with his hands, his body lying 
heavily on hers. He bent over and tried to kiss her, but she turned her face to the 
side, closing her mouth tightly shut. With his left hand he grabbed her hair and jerked 
violently. Mary gave out a loud cry of pain. �Still don�t understand, eh? Will you 
behave like a nice girl or do I have to hurt you?� Broken, the girl stared at him. This 
time she offered no resistance when he bent over and kissed her. His tongue 
violently pushing into her mouth, he was rubbing his cock against her body. Then he 



started licking her neck, down her breasts. Soon he was sucking fervently at her 
small nipples which quickly became erect. �Seems you like this.� Mark remarked 
tauntingly. �Wait! Soon it will become even better�. The girl�s face turned red, but 
otherwise she did not react. Mark worked his tongue deeper and had soon reached 
her stomach. Mary desperately closed her legs but Mark forced them open and 
attacked the girl�s vagina. Her black pubic hair was still not very developed; the lips 
were small and slim. The licking and sucking had its undeniable effect and even 
though the girl was obviously fighting the feelings she slowly got aroused. Her pussy 
lips parted and a short thread of liquid was trickling out of it. The girl rhythmically 
moved her hips and a low groaning was coming from her lips. Mark pushed his body 
up and placed his swollen cock against Mary�s fuckhole. The girl stared at his with 
wide open, pleading eyes. �Please. No. Don�t do that�. With a brutal thrust Mark 
pushed his cock inside her. The girl screamed out loud but Mark stifled her sounds 
by pressing his lips against hers, pushing his tongue into her mouth. Then he started 
to pull his body back only to violently thrust inside the girl immediately again. It took 
him only a short time to come and he sprayed his cum right onto her stomach and 
breasts. Blood and sperm flowed into each other and a thin thread of blood was 
running out of the girl�s pussy along her thighs onto the white covers of the bed. The 
girl was rolling over into a fetal position and sobbing softly. Mark lay on his back next 
to her with closed eyes. He had not felt as good since months, nay, years. Life 
suddenly did not seem depressing any more. With a broad smile on his face, Mark 
fell asleep.
