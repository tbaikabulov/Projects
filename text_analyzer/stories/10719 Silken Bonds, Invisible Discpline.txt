 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We had been dating for a while, you knew I was submissive, I knew you were dominate, I would come over and, I would cook dinner, rub your shoulders but I never really showed much interest in going much past that.&nbsp; A few weeks ago, you had picked up some jammies for me, you wanted me to spend the night.&nbsp; I liked you and you knew it, I enjoyed spending time with you, I was always guarded, and you confronted me on it.&nbsp; We were sitting on the couch and you blurted �Do you not find me attractive?�&nbsp; �No, I think you are very pretty.�&nbsp; �Do you not want to play?&nbsp; Do you not like sex?�&nbsp; �No, I have just been hurt a lot, I like what I have, and I don&#8217;t really care for sex, it takes a lot of effort for it to feel good, so I don&#8217;t usually bother.�&nbsp; �Do you trust me?�&nbsp; �I guess so.�&nbsp; �Can I try something with you, would you mind putting on your pajama&#8217;s and I will be right back.�&nbsp; �I guess so.� I replied, you came back with a little rope, �Would you turn around and put your hands behind your back.� I complied, you slowly coiled the rope around my wrists, and I knew you could go faster, I appreciated you going slow.&nbsp; �Everything ok, if you want me to stop, I will.�&nbsp; �No I am ok�&nbsp; �Let me help you sit down, I like having you at my mercy, I can tickle you without mercy,� she straddles me and starts her assault, then she stops, �Or I can take my time and learn exactly how to kiss you, that perfect way, the way that makes you melt, or the way that fills you with desire.�&nbsp; You lean in and kiss me gently, you pull back and study me for a minute, then you lean in and kiss me again you hold my face gently in your hands, you slide one down to hold my chin, the other up through my hair and then back, you release my lips, but not my face you hold it you look me in the eyes, �Would you like another, I know you liked it I could feel it, you were trying to let go, I want you to.�&nbsp; �Yes, please kiss me again.�&nbsp; You lean in again holding my face your touch is gentle, you your lips are gentle, I focus on your touch, your kiss, your kiss grows stronger, as you feel me relax, you let go as you lower back onto the couch.&nbsp; �Shh just relax, put your head down, that&#8217;s it.�&nbsp; You turn Netflix on to Adam-12.&nbsp; You run your nails softly over my back, making languid designs, �If you fall asleep, I am going to know exactly how to get my way with you.� You move one hand to my hair, and starts stroking, �Go to sleep, you are safe, with me, relax, shh go to sleep, just focus on me, nothing else.�&nbsp; My eyes flutter, and I am not asleep or awake, I just languish, in this state, where nothing seems real, that this is just a dream, you undo my arms as I fall asleep, limp as a noodle, happy.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You called and invited me over for dinner.&nbsp; You answered the door in nothing but a short sun dress, you had a big smile, it lit up your whole face, �Bad day, sweetie,� You lean in and place my face in your hands, just that perfect, gentle way.&nbsp; You kiss me, pulling me into you, you stop and push me up, �Am I making you want to melt, sweetie, trust me. Let me in I will make you melt.�&nbsp; You hold me and pull your rope up from the entry table, you lean into me you kiss me, and you wrap my wrists up and make me want to melt.&nbsp; �Now that I have you at my mercy, I think it is time I learn how to make you burn, I can make you melt, make you safe, but I want to feel your desire know I caused that desire, make you burn for me.�&nbsp; You place your lips on mine, flick your tongue against my lips, I feel you need, I feel what you want, I yield to your tongue, I let my tongue dance with yours.&nbsp; Then the hurt starts, I want to sob, you stop you look at me your eyes fixed on mine, you hold my face, you see the tears shimmering in my eyes.&nbsp; �Why did you stop?�&nbsp; �I felt your pain, sweetie, I can see it in your eyes, May I kiss you, may I hold you, May I,� �Please, hold me,� �Of course, baby,� you hold me, you let your hands, caress me, you start making languid patterns with your fingers on my back in my hair, you must feel the continued cracking. You whisper in my ear quietly gently, so quiet you think I can&#8217;t hear you. �You are broken, your heart is ripped, your eros soiled, and filthy, but you are beautiful, and so strong of heart, I want to own you, to keep you, and protect you. I will see you shine, see your beauty, see you filled with desire for me, hear you call me Mistress.�&nbsp; You stopped stroking me, held me up, looked into my eyes, you leaned forward and made me melt, offering your strength to me.&nbsp; �If I take you to see a therapist, will you go?�&nbsp; �Why do I need to see a therapist?�&nbsp; �Because, you are hurt and broken, and while I can support you, hold you, care for you protect you, I don&#8217;t know how to fix it, and I need to see you fixed so,� She leans into my ear and breathes huskily, �So I can make you burn with desire for me, and feel you burn for me, not taste the sadness of your tears, the bitterness of your pain.�&nbsp; She laid me back down, �I like you this helpless to resist my advances, you have no choice but to let yourself melt into me.�


 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I think I want to have your sister over for dinner, is that okay with you?�&nbsp; �My Sister?�&nbsp; �Yes your sister, Lynn, the one you say you never had, but always wanted.�&nbsp; �Umm, ok?�&nbsp; �Do you no want her to come over?�&nbsp; �No, I do, I just was surprised, that&#8217;s all.�&nbsp; �I want to meet her new boyfriend, threaten to cut his balls off he hurts her.�&nbsp; �You are awfully protective over my not sister sister.�&nbsp; �Anybody, you want to have as your sister, must be special person.&nbsp; Anyway, I thought I would trying being overly protective, instead of you.�&nbsp; �Ok�&nbsp; �I will give her a call�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;About a week later, the doorbell rings, I go to answer it, I look through the peephole, its Lynn I open the door, as you yell �Pet take off your collar.�&nbsp; I had completely forgotten you had put my collar on me, Lynn&#8217;s eyes go straight to it.&nbsp; �My boyfriend will be here in a little while.&nbsp; Can I meet the person who contains your depression?�&nbsp; You round the corner, and kiss me as you take off my collar.&nbsp; �Lynn I am so sorry, I forgot that I had put his collar on him, he was having a case of the nerves this morning, I am Cassie, I like to think that the smile on Karol&#8217;s face is my fault,&nbsp; I know he is to blame for the smile on mine� you kiss me again and wrap my hand in yours.&nbsp; �Lynn please come in, it is so great to meet you.&nbsp; Karol, is always talking about you. Why don&#8217;t you go sit in the living room, anywhere you like, and don&#8217;t mind the rope in the cushions.� You turn to me, �Karol go bring your sister some wine.� You lean into my ear, �I want to answer the door for Lynn&#8217;s boyfriend.�&nbsp; You punctuate your sentence by sticking your tongue out at me, then you kiss me on the cheek.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You are not taking yourself to your therapist."&nbsp; "Yes I am," I screamed back.&nbsp; "I don't need you for everything, and it is not right of me to make you miss what you want to take me to the dr."&nbsp; "Pet, I am your Mistress and you will let me go with you to the Therapists office."&nbsp; "You have that friend from Greenville coming in, you wanted to get from the airport, and I can just drive myself."&nbsp; "Pet you will regret it if you don't let me go with you."&nbsp; "I guess then I will regret it."&nbsp; I drove myself to the therapist.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Wojitya, the therapist will see you know.&nbsp; Your girlfriend isn't here with you today."&nbsp; "No we had a fight." 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Last time you were here, I asked you to think about, why you think you have trouble feeling like you accomplish anything."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�How does that make me feel?�&nbsp; I could feel myself starting to crack, �It hurts,� I said I was choking on tears, I was being stubborn determined to prove you wrong, my fists were balled I was digging my nails into my palms, you had told me you didn't think I was ready to come by myself, I had argued with you and had driven myself, you were going to be so mad.&nbsp; �What do you mean it hurts?�&nbsp; The therapist asks.&nbsp; �It hurts you stupid motherfucker, what do you mean how.&nbsp; It fucking hurts.�&nbsp; I had failed, the cracks, tears are blinding me.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The door bursts open, you had followed me, you had a friend bring you.&nbsp; You knew today was going to be hard, I had drained myself arguing with you.&nbsp; I barely noticed you, you sat on the arm of the chair, you reached your and down and touched me, �Pet darling, tell mistress how it hurts.�&nbsp; The therapist doesn't say anything. Sitting there, he knew we were into BDSM, but we had displayed it in front of him.&nbsp; �Pet, sweetie mistress wants to help, how does it hurt, I know it hurts bad, shah pet, I want you to think about how it hurts, tell me pet.� �Mistress, my heart feels, shattered, I feel empty, it just hurts mistress, and it hurts bad.� my clarity had come to an end.&nbsp; �Shah Pet, I will bring him back next week.�&nbsp; You stroke my hair, attempting to soothe me.&nbsp; �Shh pet, let&#8217;s go I brought your favorite collar.�&nbsp; I didn't need to see it I knew which collar it was, a soft black leather collar, it had a single nickel buckle, when always used it with a nickel heart shaped lock, what she said when she locked with that lock the first time, was why it was my favorite. I like this lock, it makes sure that I can keep my heart right where it belongs, with my pets.&nbsp; She had me on tied and we were laying together on the couch, she locked her lips on me when she locked the collar on me.&nbsp;&nbsp; She wraps the collar around my neck, the softness of it makes me feel safe, protected, like being held, soothed. I am blubbering.&nbsp; �Shh, pet, shah, or I will gag you.�&nbsp; A smile forces itself out, �See isn't that better, I need to take you home pet.�&nbsp; She leads me out of the office and to the car.&nbsp; She puts my shackles on, they were older than my collar but would have matched when they were new, and she had had wings stitched on to them after she had given me my collar.&nbsp; I was getting ready to go out of town on a business trip when she put them on me, my first trip since I had been given her collar, "I had wings put on these to speed your return home, when you leave to come back where them under your boots and socks, lock them on you, I will have your collar here waiting for you, my pet."&nbsp; She kissed me and wished me a safe trip as I got out of the car and walked into the airport.&nbsp; She then fastened my cuffs, they matched my collar, my hands were in my lap and my feet held together by a two foot chain. She buckles me into the seat, and gets in the driver's seat.&nbsp; �Pet you need to listen, to me very carefully, I know you want me to think that you are strong, and capable and independent, but when you accepted my collar you accepted my protection,"&nbsp; She is mad her face is red.&nbsp; She takes several deep breaths her face returning to porcelain, then she continues. "I know you are strong, you are getting help, you need to trust me, I took you knowing you are broken damaged, stomped on, hurt, and bloodied, I took you I saw your strength, I want you to shine.�&nbsp; I broke down and cried, she slid me over next to her, and held me to her.&nbsp; �shh pet, shh, I am not going to free you for at least an hour after we get home, but pet I am not happy with you.&nbsp; You knew I didn't want you to go alone and you assumed that it was because I didn't think you were strong, or capable, listen to this very carefully pet, I love you I don't like you going here by yourself, because it is hard on you it drains you, as you would say you leave feeling like your superstructure has been blown off, I worry about you on the way home.&nbsp; You are mine, you belong to me, I want you, and I am going to keep you."&nbsp; I am drowning in my tears, they are soaking Mistress's shirt, " Well pet, what do you have to say before I gag you?"&nbsp; "I-I-I am s-s-s-s-sory M-m-m-m-is-tress."&nbsp; "Is there anything else pet, and I am not listening to this all the way home, after you say what&#8217;s next I am going to kiss you, and if you don't stop crying I am going to gag you, nod once for yes."&nbsp; I nod, " I-I Lub you Mi-is-tress." She wraps my face in her hands leans in and kisses me deeply, I melt, tears stream down my face, I don't want to cry, I want this to go on forever, Mistress feels me melt, she pushes her kiss into harder, stronger.&nbsp; I relax she settles me back into my seat, and refixes my seat belt.&nbsp; "Let's go home, pet, I think someone owes me a candlelight dinner, for being such a good understanding Mistress."&nbsp; She starts the car and we take off.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Pet your therapist called, he wants you to think about how it felt the first time I placed a collar on your neck, when I asked you to let me protect you, to shield you.�&nbsp; I sat down and tried to think about it the first time you had placed a collar on me, I had been sleeping over at your place, I had been having nightmares, the kind where you insisted I sleep in your guest room, we were getting ready for bed, I had my hands bound, with my head in your lap, your favorite position for watching tv after a long day, drawing on me in your way.&nbsp; �Who&#8217;s going to have sweet dreams tonight?&nbsp; Hmm?�&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t know, probably not me.�&nbsp; �Do you trust me, my sweet one?�&nbsp; �Of course I trust you. Why?�&nbsp; �I want to try something, tonight, I want to see if I can take away your nightmares.&nbsp; Is that okay with you?�&nbsp; �Well what do you want to try?�&nbsp; You sit me up, turn me into you at forty-five degrees.&nbsp; �I think, I want to you to be mine for ever, I want to give you a collar, a very special collar, if you want my protection, I want to make you my sweet little pet, are you willing to consider it?�&nbsp; �Yes, I am� �I made you this collar,� you pull out an inch wide braided silk band with a snap on it.&nbsp; You wrap it around my neck and snap it in front. �Sweetie, when I put this collar on you and I kiss the snap, you can&#8217;t have any nightmares.�&nbsp; Then you&nbsp; kiss the snap and place your hands around my face, kiss me.&nbsp; �I think it is time for bed, I will tuck you in, I have another bedtime surprise for you, if you think you are ready for it.�&nbsp; You stand me up and I expect you to lead to me your guest room, but you lead me to your room, and sit me on your bed, untying my wrists, �Do you want to share my bed, to feel my arms around you as you sleep?&nbsp; Does it make you uncomfortable?�&nbsp; �Please may I sleep with you, tonight?�&nbsp; �Yes you may, but I want you to wear these cuffs that I made you, is that okay?�&nbsp; �Yes.�&nbsp; You fasten cuffs on me that match my collar, they sanp together, my hands in are folded in front of me, I bend my knees to how I usually sleep, I know you have watched me sleep because you have folded my hands, they way I fold them, you pull the cover around me, you kiss me, softly sweetly.&nbsp; You climb into bed behind me folding yourself around me, drawing on me.&nbsp; I could remember the events but as with everything else I could remember the events, positivie emotions alluded me.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The first time I had a nightmare, I was at home you weren&#8217;t there with me, Things had been stressful, bad, you had been worried, I would call you often, seek you out often, you knew something was really wrong, when I asked you to bind me, begged you to hold me.&nbsp; I wouldn&#8217;t stay long in the dreamy state you loved to keep me in, but I wouldn&#8217;t stay asleep long either, I don&#8217;t know if you let up in your stroking while I was asleep, but I thought you would speed it up when I would thrash myself awake.&nbsp; You never said anything about it, you wouldn&#8217;t of course.&nbsp; You would only want me to stay sleep, only try to make that happen, just whisper to me that I was safe in your arms.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My phone rang it was late, or early depending on you looked at it, only you would call me at this hour, �Are you awake, have you had any sleep?�&nbsp; �Yes and No�&nbsp; �Are you dressed?�&nbsp; �Yes I am dressed why?�&nbsp; �Do you trust me?�&nbsp; �You know I do.�&nbsp; �I am outsided, waiting for you.&nbsp; I had a gut feeling you would be in a bad way tonight, and I couldn&#8217;t sleep.&nbsp; I thought you would like to sleepover at my place, I have you jammies, and hot chocolate.�&nbsp; I slid into the passenger seat of your car, looked you in the eyes and kissed you.&nbsp; You slide the car into gear, turned up the radio and we were gone, your hand around mine.&nbsp; �We should do this more often.�&nbsp; �I should have more nightmares?�&nbsp; �No Silly I should be your Knight in Shining Armor and save you more.&nbsp; Its fun.�&nbsp; You Kiss me again.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I wake up in your guest room, in my jammies, refreshed and confused.&nbsp; You left me a note, �Bet you are confused, but seriously you really need to work on your drug problem.&nbsp; If you see me in the living room I will help you with it.�
