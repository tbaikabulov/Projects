Chapter 1

&nbsp;

Cindy looked at her reflection in the
mirror one more time before she went out.�
She was wearing a low cut top that hugged her breasts and showed off a
far bit of cleavage. Her skirt was short, so short that she would have to be
careful how she sat. She had finished off her outfit with stockings and a pair
of super high heel shoes.� It was not how
she would normally dress; in fact, she had never worn anything like it before.
She had gotten sick of sitting home alone every night and decided that she was
going to do something to change that.�
She had just begun her annual vacation, and was determined that she was
going to use the four weeks to change her life. She picked up her bag and ran
out to the honking cab so that she would not have a chance to change her mind.

&nbsp;

Cindy saw the cab driver look at her and
give a low whistle as she carefully got into the back seat. She could see
herself in his mirror, almost not recognising herself with her extra makeup and
died red hair.� �Where to love?� She realised
the driver was talking to her and gave him the name of a club she had overheard
some of the girls at work talking about. She had no idea what kind of club it
was, but decided that for tonight at least, she would not be the kind of
worrier she usually was.� 

&nbsp;

�Club Blue please, I think it is in the
city.�� Cindy realised that she should
have at least looked up an address, but she hoped the club was popular enough
that the driver would know of it.� �Club
Blue hey, I guess that explains the outfit, though I would have thought that
leather would have been more appropriate.�

&nbsp;

Cindy wanted to ask him why, but then
remembered her decision not to worry about little things, so just smiled and
turned to look out the window. The trip into the city only took about ten
minutes and soon he was pulling up in front of the club. It looked like a
typical club, with bouncers out the front and people in groups talking. She
hoped that they would let her in, not knowing what kind of dress code they had.
Paying the driver, she walked on slightly unsteady legs up to the
entrance.� One of the bouncers asked for
some ID and then asked if she was alone.�
Cindy was a bit puzzled by this but said yes.� She was surprised to find one of the men
taking her by the arm and leading her inside. 



What she saw almost made her want to turn
and run, but she couldn�t with him holding her arm. �Just wait here,� he had
told her, and for some reason she did. She was standing at the entrance to the
club and could see many people inside, but they were the kind of people she had
only ever seen on the Internet.� Some
girls were wearing almost nothing and some had collars around their necks.� She looked in one corner and saw a girl
kneeling between the legs of a man dressed all in black, his hand resting on
her head.� She was just about to see what
would happen next, when she was startled by a man�s voice.

&nbsp;

�Good evening, my name is Charles and I
have been told that you are all on your own tonight. I am here alone too, so if
you like, I can show you around the club. It can be a bit daunting the first
time you visit, especially if you are alone.��
Cindy was mesmerised by the man talking to her, not only did he have the
sexiest voice she had ever heard, he was very handsome too.� Like the other man, he was dressed all in
black, with what looked like leather pants and a soft silk shirt.� His hair was also dark and he had soft brown
eyes that seemed to gleam at her.� He
wore no jewellery apart from a ring on one finger.� She suddenly realised that she had been so
busy looking at him that she had not answered him yet.

&nbsp;

�My name is Cindy and yes, that would be
very nice, thank you.�� She had tried to
sound confident but thought she had sounded more like someone responding to an
offer of a cup of tea or something. He had not seemed to mind however and held
out an arm for her to take.

&nbsp;

Charles had been intrigued when the bouncer
had come and told him that there was a young woman wanting to enter the
club.� He had told him that she was all
alone and did not really look like she knew what kind of club it was.� Charles had come along tonight just to look
around and see if there was anyone he might consider taking on as a sub or even
just to find someone looking for a little fun.�
He had had a regular sub that had liked to play on weekends, but she had
recently been offered a fantastic job in another city, which she had of course
taken.� He missed her, but was also
excited about the prospect of being with someone new.� He liked finding out what a sub liked and
didn�t like, and with his previous sub he had been starting to find that they
knew each other too well.

&nbsp;

When he saw the girl, he was a bit
surprised, as she did not look the usual type you would find in Club Blue. He
thought that she had a pretty face, which for some reason she had hidden under
a thick layer of makeup.� He liked her
body under her clothes, though he would like to teach her the difference
between sexy and slutty if he had the chance.�
He could see her attention was taken with something in the corner and
looked to see a woman servicing a man.�
He saw the flush on the girl�s face and again thought how out of place
she seemed, however he didn�t want her trying to navigate the club on her own.� When he had spoken, he had recognised that
look that most woman got around him.� She
had taken his arm and allowed him to lead her into the club.

&nbsp;

�Cindy, can I get you a drink, perhaps a
wine?� He could see her staring around the room, definitely seeing things she
had never seen before.� He caught the eye
of one of the drink waitresses, Cindy wide eyed at her clothing or rather lack
of it.� All of the waitresses simply wore
a collar with matching ankle and wrist cuffs and a small black g-string.� He saw Cindy look the girl up and down before
turning away when the girl looked at her and smiled. 

&nbsp;

�Cindy, do you know what you want to drink
or can I just get you a white wine?� 
When she still did not answer he ordered her a wine and a scotch for
himself.� He told the waitress they would
be over on the couch and lead a still staring Cindy over to sit down.

&nbsp;

Cindy sat down on the couch, trying to take
in all she could see around her. She saw a waitress walk up with two drinks and
suddenly she had a glass of wine in her hand.�
Without thinking she almost drained the glass in one hit, needing
something to calm her nerves.� She heard
Charles order another glass before the waitress left and she put her glass down
on a table, embarrassed at her behaviour. She turned to look at Charles for the
first time since she had entered the club and saw that he had a grin on his
face.

&nbsp;

�I think you are lucky that I was here
tonight, or you might have not make it out in one piece.�� Cindy just smiled but her former self started
to emerge and worry about what he meant.�
�Tell me, how did you know about this place. No offence, but you don�t
really seem the type.� �Some friends told me about it, and as they were unable
to come tonight, I though I would check it out myself.� She hoped that he would
leave it at that, but he seemed intrigued by her choice of clubs.� �What did they tell you, these friends of
yours?�

&nbsp;

�Well, not too much, just that it was a
cool place and really interesting. Tell me, Charles, what do you do?� She knew
she was changing the subject, but hoped he would let her for now.� �I run my own company, we help small
businesses set up websites.� What about
you, what do you do?�� This was a
question she had thought she would be asked and not wanting to say she was a
boring office worker, she had decided on a more interesting career. �Oh, I work
in the movie industry. I help to cast actors and find locations, that kind of
thing, though I am on a break at the moment.� 

&nbsp;

Charles thought there was something not
quite genuine about her answer, but again he let it go. They talked for a few
more minutes, before the music stopped and the curtains opened indicating that
the show was about to start. Charles was interested in seeing Cindy�s
reactions, as he knew tonight�s performance was meant to be quite extreme.

&nbsp;

Cindy saw the curtains open to reveal a big
stage, with something that looked like an old fashioned set of stocks sitting
in the middle.� A man wearing nothing but
a very tight pair of leather pants appeared on the stage pulling something
behind him.� Cindy was shocked to see it
was a woman, her hands tied to the rope he held.� Cindy could see she was naked and that she
had something attached to her breasts. She was vaguely aware of Charles moving
closer to her, his hand coming to rest on her knee.� Her inner voice was telling her to brush his
hand away, but her mind was too taken with what was happening on the stage to
listen to herself.� 

&nbsp;

Charles could see that Cindy was completely
captivated by the show, and decided that this was an opportunity too good to
miss.� He moved his hand onto her leg and
noticed that despite a brief glance down, she was ignoring him.� He moved his hand up her leg and then down to
her inner thigh, feeling the soft skin above her stocking tops. He could feel
her breathing becoming short, though whether it was from him or what she was
watching, he wasn�t sure, nor did he really care. He allowed his other hand to
reach around her and sit on her breast for a moment, before slipping it into
her bra when she did not move away.� 

&nbsp;

He started to rub her nipple inside her bra
and was not surprised to feel the nipple grow under his fingers.� His other hand was still stroking her inner
leg and he even thought she had moved her leg a bit to let him get better
access.� He moved even closer to her,
expecting that at any moment she would push his hands away or worse still, run
away from him.� He was aware of a few
people around him looking at what he was doing but for the most part, all eyes
were on the stage. 

&nbsp;

Cindy could feel Charles� hands on her, but
still she did nothing but stare at the scene in front of her.� The man had forced the woman onto her knees
and had secured her into the stocks, her body side on to the audience.� She had been able to see that she had some
kind of clip on each breast and had tried to imagine what she must be
feeling.� When the man had knelt down and
placed what looked to be big ball bearings onto the clips, Cindy had not been
surprised to hear the woman moan in what had to be pain.� All the while, she could feel a growing
sensation in her pussy, as Charles continued to gently manipulate her
body.� She felt him move his hand that
had been stroking her leg and start to rub her pussy lips through her panties.
The feeling made her gasp, as his fingers sent small shock waves through her
body.� 

&nbsp;

She was about to say something when the man
on stage picked up what looked like a whip and hit her with it.� The woman screamed, her body jerking in the
stocks.� The man dropped the whip and
picked up what to Cindy looked like a red table tennis ball with some straps
attached.� He again knelt before the
woman and lifted her head by gripping her hair in his hand. As her mouth
opened, he pushed the ball in, letting her head drop as he tightened the
straps.� He then used her hair to raise
her head again, looking to be checking the fit of the ball in her mouth.� He dropped her head down once again and moved
to pick up the whip, proceeding to whip her all along her back, bottom and
upper legs.� With her mouth now blocked,
the woman�s screams were muffled.� Cindy
wondered if she should just run out of the club while she had the chance, not
wanting anything like that to happen to her, but she felt like something was
holding her to the seat.

&nbsp;

Charles knew that Cindy was not really
aware of what he was doing, but he could feel that her body was.� He had moved his fingers to rub her pussy
through her panties, not surprised by how wet they were. He heard her soft
gasps as he rubbed her, knowing that this time it was definitely him she was responding
to. Her body tensed as the scene on the stage intensified and he prepared to
grab her if she decided to run off.� It
was not that he wanted to keep her here against her will, but he did not think
it would be a good idea for her to be alone in the club and especially not the
surrounding neighbourhood. He decided to give her something else to think about
and moved her panties aside to allow his fingers to enter her pussy.� 

&nbsp;

This time her gasps were louder and he felt
her body relax a bit under his fingers. He gently rubbed her, feeling her
moisture on his fingers. Working his way further into her, he suddenly stopped,
feeling her resistance.� He wondered that
she could still be a virgin but he had the proof right there, at his
fingertips.� He withdrew his fingers
slightly, not wanting to hurt her, and moved up to rub her clit.� 

&nbsp;

Cindy had felt Charles� fingers move to
enter her pussy and felt a warm, tingling sensation spread through her whole
body.� Her breasts felt heavy and the
hand on her breast felt like it was part of her.� She was aware of him moving deeper into her
and then stopping. She had thought for a moment that her virginity had tuned
him off, but when she felt him rub her clit, she forgot all thought.� Cindy even lost focus on what was happening
on the stage as she felt her orgasm approaching.� Though she had not had much experience with
men, she had become fairly good at bringing herself to orgasm.� She had to admit, though, that she had never
felt anything as intense as she was feeling now.� She was about to cum when he abruptly removed
both of his hands and stood her up.

&nbsp;

Charles could tell that she was close to
cumming and didn�t want her first orgasm with him to be so public.� He knew the club kept rooms for members to
use, and as he could see that most people were intent on watching the show,
that there would be no trouble finding an available room.� He could tell that Cindy was confused by his
actions and moved her quickly to the area of the club where the rooms were.� He used his member�s card to enter a room,
and sat her down on the couch inside. 

&nbsp;

Cindy did not know why he had stopped what
he had been doing or why they were now in another part of the club. He had sat
her down on the couch, but when he had turned to shut the door, she had
panicked and moved to the wall at the back of the room.� What had she been thinking, letting him touch
her the way he had been before? What did he want now?� For all she knew, he wanted to do the same
thing to her that was still being done to the woman on the stage. When he
turned around to look at her, she could see his surprise that she wasn�t on the
couch.� Expecting him to come for her,
she moved back further into the wall.�
When he simply moved to the small fridge and pulled out a bottle of wine
and two glasses, she still did not move. She watched as he poured out the
drinks, placed the glasses on the low table near the couch and moved to sit
down.� 

&nbsp;

Charles could have kicked himself, he had
succeeded in doing the last thing he had wanted to do and that was to scare
her. It would serve him right if she demanded to leave right away. When he had
turned to see her not on the couch, but standing looking like a frightened
child, his first instinct was to hold her in his arms, but he knew that would
only serve to frighten her more. So, he had tried to act as if everything was
normal and poured them both a drink. Now that he was seated and sipping the
wine, he could see her start to relax and even find enough nerve to come and
take the other glass. 

&nbsp;

He knew that he had to take it slow and decided
to let her make the first move. As time went by and she said nothing, just
sipped her wine and looked at him over her glass, he knew that he would have to
be the one to break the silence. He tried to think of what he could say that
would not scare her even more and hopefully keep her with him for a bit longer.

&nbsp;

Cindy sipped her wine, still not sure what
was going on, but starting to calm down a bit as Charles made no move to
approach her.� She still was not sure if
she was comfortable being in a room alone with him, but she felt that she was
in no immediate danger. She sat down on a chair opposite the couch and
continued to sip her wine.

�Cindy, I am sorry if I scared you, believe
me that was not my intention. I had only thought to take you somewhere more
private as I was sure you didn�t want everyone to see you cum.� At the mention
of her near orgasm, not only did she feel herself blushing but became aware of
her pussy throbbing. 

&nbsp;

�I can see by your blush that you remember
what happened out there. If you like, we can take up where we left off, or I
can arrange to take you home.�� Cindy
considered his options, the old, sensible Cindy screaming at her to go and go
now, but she had never felt like she had before and knew that she would regret
it if she didn�t stay for at least a little bit longer. After all, she had left
home determined to make a change in her love life.� The throbbing in her pussy also helped to
make up her mind to stay, her body crying out for more.� �Charles, if you are willing to spend more
time with me, then I wish to stay and� and well�finish what you started.� Cindy
was not used to talking about sex, especially in connection to herself. She saw
Charles smile and ask her to stand up. 

&nbsp;

�Cindy, I need you to trust me and do what
I say, do you think you could do that? I promise that no harm will come to
you.�� Charles knew that he was taking a
risk in asking her to trust him so soon, but he could see that he needed to
take control as Cindy obviously had little experience. He actually liked the
fact that she was so innocent, his mind running over all the things he could
teach her. He was pleased to see her nod, her eyes showing some feint remnants
of her earlier fear, but nothing more than he would expect to see in a
situation like this.

&nbsp;

�Good girl, now I need you to stand and
remove you shirt and skirt.� Charles waited while she took another drink before
standing and starting to remove her shirt.�
He could see she was embarrassed but this did not stop her. When she had
her skirt off, he asked her to come and stand in front on him.

&nbsp;

Cindy moved to stand in front of Charles,
trying to cover herself as she stood close to him. She had bought new underwear
and thought the see-through material sexy in the store, but now she wished she
had her old sensible ones on again.�� She
could feel his breath on her stomach as he moved forward to examine her.� He gently took her hands and moved them to
her side, tracing the line at the top of her panties.� She gasped, feeling a shock go through at
this slight touch. 

&nbsp;

�Cindy, you are so beautiful. Now I want
you to sit on the couch, with your legs spread and your bottom at the edge.�
Cindy saw him stand up and she moved to take his place, sitting just as he told
her to. She felt the cool air on her panties and knew that they must be
soaking.� �Good, now remove your bra and
place your hands on your breasts.�� Cindy
followed his instructions, again feeling her face flush.� She felt him lift up her feet and remove her
panties and then her stockings one by one. She tried not to think of the view
she was giving him and just let her body relax. It felt strange that she was
letting a man she had only just met touch her, but it just felt so right.� Cindy shivered as he ran his hands up and
down her legs and closed her eyes to make the feelings even more intense. 

&nbsp;

Charles saw her body revealed and marvelled
at how beautiful she was. He told her to start to squeeze her breasts, while he
lowed his mouth to taste her pussy. He saw that she was not a natural red head,
her pubic hair a mousy brown colour.�
Using the back of his hands, he gently moved her knees out wider and
used his tongue to burrow between her pussy lips. The sound of her moans
reached his ears and he knew he had hit the right spot. 

&nbsp;

He sucked and used his tongue alternately
until he sensed her orgasm was close.�
Charles lifted his head to see her eyes half shut and her head moving
side to side. �Cindy, Cindy! I want you to pinch you nipples.� That is right.�� He saw her pinch her nipples, making them
stand up even more than they had been.�
Charles lowered his head and found her clit, sucking it into his mouth. 

&nbsp;

Cindy felt the jolts through her body as
first she pinched her nipples and then as he sucked her clit into his mouth.
She could feel her orgasm building up to one even bigger than before. Suddenly,
her world exploded, her body jerking uncontrollably at the most incredible
orgasm she had ever experienced.� �Well,
that was a beautiful sight.� Now, there
is a shower here if you would like to freshen up before you decide what you
want to do next.�� 

&nbsp;

Cindy was aware of him talking to her,
saying something about having a shower, but her mind was still trying to come
to terms with what had just happened to her body.� She felt him help her to her feet and lead
her into a small bathroom. He turned on the shower and returned to the main
room.� Cindy stepped into the shower,
loving the feeling of the water on her skin. Without thinking, she let the
water run over her head. Too late, she remembered her fancy hairdo and makeup.
Knowing it was too late to save either, she relaxed and let her body enjoy the
sensation of the warm water. She allowed her mind to relive the feeling of his
mouth on her and that wonderful orgasm.�
Cindy thought she could hear the sound of Charles talking, but was
enjoying the shower too much to worry.�
Turning off the shower, she dried herself with the softest towel she had
ever felt. It was not until she looked at her reflection in the mirror, did she
see how the water had ruined her makeup.�
She had just begun to wipe away the worst of her running mascara, when
she heard Charles voice behind her.

&nbsp;

�Well, I am sure that feels much better and
don�t worry too much about your makeup, the club keeps everything you might
need in the drawers.� However, please
don�t use so much this time, I would rather see your pretty face than a pile of
makeup. When you are ready, I have taken the liberty of getting you some new
clothes that suit the club better. Of course, you may wear your old clothes if
you wish,� 

&nbsp;

At that, he left, not giving her time to
respond. When she turned to see the dress he had hung on the door, she thought
she had never seen anything so beautiful. It was dark blue and made out of the
lightest of materials. She knew it would sit perfectly. Eager to try it on, she
quickly redid her makeup, being careful not to use too much, but still more
than she was used to.� She saw a hair
drier on the wall and dried her hair, letting it fall naturally around her
shoulders.� Once she was satisfied that
she no longer looked like a drowned rat, she turned to put on her underwear,
suddenly releasing that they were nowhere to be seen. She was just about to ask
Charles where they were, when she spotted a bag hanging with the dress. On
closer inspection, she could see that he had also provided her with new, very
expensive looking underwear.� 

&nbsp;

She put on the bra and panty set, noting
that though they were very light, they fit her perfectly.� She saw he had also provided her with new,
silk stockings, and loved how they felt on her legs. When she pulled the dress
over her head, she couldn�t help but stare at the image she saw in the
mirror.� The dress exposed just as much
skin as her previous outfit, but instead of making her look like a hooker, this
dress made her look like a model. It skimmed her body while still showing off
her breasts and hips in a feminine way.� 

&nbsp;

Charles stood in the doorway, watching
Cindy looking at her reflection in the mirror.�
He was amazed at the change in her, her hair and makeup looking much
more natural and the dress was as prefect as he thought it would be.� �Cindy, you look stunning! I just knew that
dress would suit you. Here are the shoes to match. Now, come and sit down, so
we can decide how to best spend the rest of the night.�� He saw her sit, a curious look on her face.

&nbsp;

�I know you are wondering about the
clothes. The club provides many extra services for long-term members, including
access to a range of clothes.� Now, this
will finish off the outfit rather nicely.��
He held out what looked like a velvet choker with a sparkling blue gem
in the middle.� He moved to fasten it
onto her neck, stepping back with a satisfied look on his face.� Cindy could feel the choker on her neck and
was reminded of the collars she had seen many of the women in the club
wearing.� She was about to comment on
this, when Charles started to speak again.

&nbsp;

�Cindy, I have enjoyed my time with you so
far, as I hope you have too.� I would
like it if you would consider coming home with me tonight.� Of course, we can just spend some more time
in the club and I�ll make sure you get back to your home safely. You don�t need
to answer now, but just know that it would make be very happy if you were to
agree.�� He could see her mind going over
the possibilities and was glad that at least she wasn�t saying no right
away.� 

&nbsp;

�Charles, I am not sure what to say, you
have been so kind to me. The clothes, your company and, well, you know.� I will certainly think about your
offer.�� She saw him smile and was
pleased that he was not doing anything to pressure her. �Charles, this chocker,
it reminds me of what many of the women in the club are wearing.� Does this mean the same thing?�

&nbsp;

�No love, your choker is for show but for
many of the woman in the club it means that they are slaves.� The collar showed that they have a master or
mistress.�� Charles saw her go pale, and
realised he may have given her too much information.

&nbsp;

�Slaves, what do you mean they are
slaves?�� Cindy felt herself go weak at
the thought of people owning other people, and remembered all that she had seen
before she had been brought into the room.�
�Love, I have scared you again, I just keep forgetting that all this is
new to you.� What if I arrange for you to
talk to one of the women in the club, so you can see that it is not as bad as
you are obviously imagining it to be?�
Remember, we can leave or I can send you home whenever you want to.�

&nbsp;

Cindy looked at Charles, the honesty she
could see in his eyes convincing her that she should at least stay for a while.
�Ok, I will stay for a while.��

Chapter 2

&nbsp;

Cindy walked out behind Charles back into
the main section of the club. The stage area was empty and it seemed like there
were less people than there had been earlier.�
She was aware of several sets of eyes looking at her, not all male
either.� She saw that they were heading
toward a couple sitting in the corner. The girl was kneeling on he floor while the man stroked her hair. Cindy noticed the
man look up at her, his gaze making her feel like he could see into her very
soul. Then Charles shook his hand, making him look away.� 

&nbsp;

Charles knew that what he did now was
crucial to what choice she would make later.�
He had seen Simon as soon as he moved back in to the club and knew that
Tina, his slave, would be the perfect one to talk to Cindy. The two men
exchanged small talk for a moment before he got to the point. �Simon, I have a
favour to ask.� I see you have noticed Cindy and I really need Tina to talk to
her.� I am afraid that I put my foot in
it and mentioned that the collars mean that someone is a slave. Now, I have big
hopes for her, but I won�t get anywhere if I scare her off on the first
night.�� 

&nbsp;

Charles waited while Simon considered his
request, his eyes on Cindy the whole time. �Simon, would it help if I promised
that if she becomes mine, you can come and play one night?�� He saw the gleam in the other man�s eyes and
was sure he had him. �Ok, I will let you share Tina for a while. Slave, go and
talk to our new friend over there and do a good job.� Charles saw Tina stand up
and approach Cindy, hoping that one day it would be him with Cindy kneeling at
his feet. 

&nbsp;

Cindy had felt very exposed while she had
waited for Charles to talk to the man, all the while feeling the other man�s
eyes on her. When she saw the girl coming towards her, she knew that she was
going to find out maybe more than she wanted to know about being a slave. �Hi,
I�m Tina and you must be Cindy. My Master has asked me to talk to you a little
bit about my life as a slave. Come and sit down and we can have a chat� Cindy sat
down on a chair at one end of the table that the two men were sitting at.� They were far enough away that she could not
hear what they were saying, but close enough to keep eye contact.� Once they were seated, she didn�t know what
to say and was grateful when Tina began to speak.

&nbsp;

�Cindy, I don�t know you but would I be
right in saying that this is all very new to you?�� Cindy just nodded. �Ok, then I will just tell
you some basics, so you can get a bit of a feel for how I live my life.� First, I heard Charles say that you were
curious about the collars that many slaves wear.� It is simply a visible sign that you belong
to someone, just as a married couple wear wedding rings.� My Master presented mine to me when I signed
my slave contract. Oh, by the way, do interrupt if you have a question, as I
tend to talk a lot.�� Cindy just had to
ask about the contract.

&nbsp;

�Tina, what do you mean when you say you
signed a slave contract? Is it like when you buy a house or something?�� �Well it is agreement between a slave and
their master in which the limits of the relationship are set, the time frame
and other important information. You see, with a real Master, there is always
communication, even though they are in charge.�
For example, I have a safe signal that I can use if I need to stop what
is happening and if it is used, my master will try to find out what is wrong.
�Why do you let him treat you like that though, kneeling at his feet and
letting him treat you like a pet.� I�m sorry
if that sounds rude, but I just can�t understand it.�

&nbsp;

�I can see how to someone outside of our
world, it could look like that.� I just
know that with Master Simon I feel protected.�
He would never mistreat me in a way that other men have. It may sound
strange but our relationship is very intense and I know that he thinks about me
almost all the time. I suppose what I am trying to say is that I am happy and
isn�t that all anyone wants.�

&nbsp;

Cindy had to agree, looking up at Charles
as he talked to Tina�s master.� He looked
so confident and she still could not believe that he was so interested in
her.� Usually men rarely even gave her a
second glance let alone chose to spend time with her.� �How long have you known Charles for?�� She turned back to look at Tina as she
answered her question.�� �Oh, we only
just met tonight, I came in alone and one of the bouncers at the door
introduced him to me.� I must say that it
has been a very interesting night so far.��
Cindy did not want to go into details and was glad that Tina did not
pry.� �Well, I can tell you that he is a
great guy and would be a fantastic master if that is what you are looking
for.� He used to come over to play
sometime with his sub Cleo, but she left a few months ago and we haven�t seen
her since.� 

&nbsp;

�What do your mean by a sub?�� Cindy was almost afraid to hear the answer,
her mind already picturing Charles with a girl at his feet as Tina had been
before. �A sub is someone who is submissive to another, but does not want to
make it more formal like I have. Often they only see their master or mistress
for a few hours or maybe a weekend.� It
is a way for people to enjoy the feeling of being mastered but not have to give
up their usual life.��� 

&nbsp;

�So Charles had a slave, or a sub, who he
was master to?� The news that Charles had been involved in the things Tina was
telling her about made Cindy feel strange and she felt like she needed some
air.� Before she knew what she was doing,
she was trying to find the way out, pushing past people until she found an
exit.� It was not the way she had come
in, but she did not notice this in her need to get outside.� Cindy ran down the street, not paying any
attention to where she was going.� 

&nbsp;

�Hey baby, have you come to play? Come on
over here so I can find out what is under that pretty dress.�� Cindy heard the man�s rough voice and
screamed as he approached her. In her shock, she did not notice the other man
until she felt an arm grab her around her waist and lift her off her feet.� She screamed even louder, until she was
dumped on the ground, her breath knocked out of her. She looked up to see two
faces leering at her and wondered how she was going to get away from them. She
began to struggle as they moved down closer to her.

&nbsp;

�Joey, you grab her legs and I�ll get her
hands.� Now darling, if you want to survive,
you will do exactly as I say, or else.� At that, he pulled a small knife from
out of his pocket and held it to her throat.�
Cindy got the message and stopped her struggles, not knowing if he would
carry out his threat, but not wanting to find out either.� She felt hands on her ankles and then Joey
grabbed her hands and pulled them up above her head, holding both of her hands
in his.� Cindy felt like she was in the
middle of a nightmare, but the feeling of her undies being pulled down reminded
her it was all too real.

&nbsp;

Joey pushed his lips onto hers, his teeth
rubbing against her lips until she was forced to open her mouth.� She could taste cigarettes and beer on his
breath and had to try hard not to gag. She heard the sound of a zipper and then
a heavy body was lying on her. Not wanting to look at the men�s faces, she
closed her eyes. Suddenly she felt the body that had been pressing onto her
move away, and as she opened her eyes to see why, she could see the man who had
been on top of her lying on the ground at her feet.� What surprised her was the hand that came
down and dragged him up to his feet.� 

&nbsp;

Charles saw Cindy lying on the ground, her
stockings torn and her panties on the ground near her feet. He had seen Simon
pull the thug off her and throw him to the ground.� He saw the other one, who had a knife in his
hand, look up in surprise and then run off in the opposite direction.� Simon went off to chase him, leaving him with
Cindy and the thug on the ground.� He
could see him moaning, holding his arm.�
Charles grabbed this arm and pulled him to his feet, his yells of pain
filling the air around them.� 

&nbsp;

�Listen to me, you asshole, and listen
good. You are going to get out of my sight as fast as you can, and never, ever
treat a woman that way again, do you understand me? But first, there is
something I have to do.� Charles could see the fear in his eyes and was pleased
that he was feeling some of what he had put Cindy through. He reached down and
pulled his pants completely of him, leaving him naked from the waist down. When
he let his hand go, the man ran off, holding his injured arm to his chest and
the other one over his penis. If the situation were not so serious, he would
have laughed out loud.

&nbsp;

Cindy had not moved as Charles dealt with
the man, the enormity of what could have happened sinking in. She felt herself
start to shake and knew that there were tears on her face. She jumped as a hand
touched her shoulder, looking up to see Charles looking at her in concern.
�Cindy, are you ok? Did they hurt you?��
Cindy tried to answer but only managed to shake her head.� �Good, I know we should have called the
police, but they would take forever to get here and then you would have to
answer lots of questions, including why you were running down the street at
night. I hope you don�t mind.� 

&nbsp;

Cindy was about to answer when Simon came
running up, his breath coming out in gasps.�
�Man, I am out of shape. The punk got away and I saw the other one
running like the devil was behind him, crying and trying to hide his
dick.�� Cindy saw him turn to look at
her, his stare not seeming quite so intense now. 

&nbsp;

�How are you sweetheart?
We got such a fright when you ran out of the club.� It seems like we got here just in time.�� Cindy had been managing to control her tears,
but at his reminder of what the men were about to do to her, she couldn�t keep
her sobs in any longer.�� She was vaguely
aware of Charles picking her up and hearing him say that he was going to take
her home. She buried her head in his shirt and let him take her to his
car.� 

&nbsp;

Charles said a quick thank you and goodbye
to Simon, promising to contact him soon.�
He could feel Cindy hiding her head in his shirt and hoped that she
would be ok.�� He still wanted her to
spend the night with him, but he was realistic enough to realise not much could
happen.� He placed her gently in the
passenger seat of his car and pulled her seat belt on. �Cindy, do you want me
to take you back to your home?� When he got no response, her sobs still rocking
her body, he decided he would just take her to his home, and let her go back to
her home later if she wanted to.

Chapter 3

&nbsp;

Cindy was only partly aware of being
carried and placed in a car. She just could not seem to stop crying. When she
felt herself being picked up again and then placed onto a soft surface, she did
not protest.� It was only when she felt a
glass being placed at her lips and felt the warmth of the liquid moving through
her body, did she became aware of her surroundings.� �Charles?�
Where am I?� How did I get
here?�� 

&nbsp;

Charles was relieved to hear her voice,
having been worried about how she had sobbed all the way to his house.� �Cindy, you are at my house.� I didn�t know where you lived and did not
want to leave you alone while you were so upset.� How are you feeling now?�

&nbsp;

Cindy thought about his question and
realised that although she was still a little bit shaken,
she was feeling much better.� �I am
feeling ok. Whatever this drink is, it certainly woke me up.�� She took another sip, again feeling the
warmth spread all through her.� She knew
she should be concerned that she was in Charles home with him, but at the
moment she just felt so safe.� �Charles,
I don�t think I said thank you.� I know
it was a silly thing to do, but I didn�t think about it at the time.� 

&nbsp;

�Do you think you can tell me why you ran
off? Tina was beside herself thinking she had upset you.� Cindy thought back on
what had set her off, and wondered if she had enough nerve to tell him.� �I�m not sure. I think I was just feeling
overwhelmed by the whole night and talking to Lisa just made things more
real.� Do you think I will be able to
tell her sometime that it wasn�t her that upset?� Charles could tell that she
was not telling him everything, but knew that now was not the time to press her
for more detail.� �I can contact Simon
and ask him if he could tell his slave.� He saw her look up again at the
reminder that Lisa belonged to Simon and wondered if that was the root of her
problem.� �Cindy, does the idea of
someone being submissive to another person bother you? Is that why you ran
off?� Cindy decided that since he had been so good to her, he deserved some
honesty. 

&nbsp;

�Charles, before I stumbled into the club
tonight, I never even realised that people lived this way.� I mean, I liked Lisa and even though I was
not sure about Simon, it didn�t worry me too much that she was his slave. �In fact, what she told me was somewhat
interesting.� However, when Lisa
mentioned that you used to have a girl, a sub I think she said, well I just
felt strange.�

&nbsp;

He could see that this time she was being
honest and tried to be honest with her as well. � Cindy,
it is true that I used to have a girl, a sub or submissive, who used to like to
play on the weekends.� Cleo didn�t want
to be a slave full time, like Tina is to Simon, but she liked to let me take
over on the weekends. She left to take a new job and I have not really been
looking for a replacement, but when I met you tonight, it just seemed to feel
right. I suppose it is up to you whether you would like to explore what bondage
is all about.�� 

&nbsp;

�I don�t know how I feel about everything I
have seen and heard tonight. As you no doubt have noticed, I have not had much
experience with men and I have certainly never been made to feel as sexy and
wanted as you have made me feel.� If you
are not sick of me, then I would like to stay and learn some more.�� 

&nbsp;

Cindy could not believe that she had
actually told him she wanted to stay the night. She began to worry what he
would expect of her, but stopped herself and decided she had to trust him.
Charles looked at her, amazed that after all that had happened she still wanted
to stay with him.� He knew that he would
have to take things slow.

&nbsp;

�Cindy, I won�t expect you to submit fully
on our first night, but I would like to introduce you to some of the things I
like. I might be a bit rougher then I was earlier, but I need you to know that
you can stop whatever is happening at anytime. If you need me to stop, you
either say the word tropical or you show me a thumbs
down signal.� If you are unable to do
either of these two signals, then you grunt in the SOS pattern. I need you to
tell me you understand.�

&nbsp;

Cindy had felt as if she was in another
reality as she listened to Charles tell her the signals.� She hoped she would not need to use one, but
was pleased she had an out if she needed it.�
She could see he was waiting for her response. �Yes, I understand that I
need to use one of the safe signals if I need to stop.� Will you be upset if I have to stop?� Charles
could hear the worry in her voice and wanted to put her at ease.

&nbsp;

�No love, I will not be angry, disappointed
maybe, but not angry.� One of the most
important things about setting off on any new relationship is communication,
but it is even more important in this kind of relationship. I never want you to
think you can not be honest with me.� He could see the serious look on her face
and decided it would be a good idea to start before she changed her mind. �Ok
then, let�s get started. Come with me into my room.� 

&nbsp;

Cindy heard the dominant tone in his voice
and found herself following without any hesitation. Once in his room, he told
her to undress while he did the same thing. She had seen only one man naked
before and that had been when she had walked in on her brother in the
bathroom.� She couldn�t help but stare at
Charles�s cock, it seeming to be very large to her.� Charles saw her looking and told her to kneel
down on the ground in front of him. He saw her hesitate and hoped he hadn�t
blown it already, but then she moved and gracefully knelt down before him. 

&nbsp;

�Take my cock in your hands so you can feel
it.�� He saw her reach out and he almost
came on the spot as he felt her first tentative touches. Cindy was surprised at
how heavy and warm it was as her hands slide up the length of his cock.� �Now, reach down lower and feel my balls. Let
them lie in your hand.� Cindy did as he said, her curiosity overriding any
fears she was feeling. �Good girl, now I need you to take just the head of my
penis into your mouth and just let it sit on your tongue. I promise I won�t
move until you are ready.� 

&nbsp;

He saw her open her mouth and moved to put
his penis onto her tongue. He was grateful that he had learnt to control his
orgasms over the years or he would have been spurting into her already.� He loved the way she was looking up at him as
she held him in her mouth.� �Good Cindy, you
are doing very well. Now I am going to move my cock further into your
mouth.� You will need to open up wide and
breath evenly through your nose. Nod you head when you
are ready.� 

&nbsp;

Cindy nodded and then felt his cock move
further into her mouth.� She felt her
lips spreading wide around him and gagged when he hit the entrance to her
throat. He moved back and rested the head on her tongue again. �Cindy, you
noticed that you gagged when I reached the entrance to your throat. Another
time, if you want, I will teach you how to take all of my cock into your
throat, but now I just want you to move up and down with my cock in your mouth.


&nbsp;

Charles let her work his cock in her mouth
for a few minutes before taking her by the shoulders and bringing her to her
feet.� �Now, I am going to tie your hands
behind your back. Remember you can stop at anytime.� He hoped she would not
need to but knew it was important to keep on reminding her every so often.� Cindy felt a bit nervous about having her
hands tied but was not ready to stop yet.�
She felt Charles turn her around and tie her wrists using what felt like
rope.� When he was done, she tested the
bonds, feeling some movement but knowing she would not be able to get loose
either. 

&nbsp;

�Anytime you are tied and you feel that
your circulation has been cut off, let me know.�
It is normal to feel a tingling but numb is not normal. How does that
feel?�

�It is strange but not too tight.�� Cindy felt his hands come around from behind
to pinch her nipples, her fingers coming into contact with his cock.� He took one nipple into his fingers and began
to squeeze. �I need to check your pain levels, just so I know how far I can go
without hurting you too much.� I am going
to squeeze and you need to tell me when it is too much for you to take.� 

&nbsp;

Cindy gasped as he pinched her nipple
tighter until she had to tell him to stop. He repeated the same process on her
other nipple, reaching about the same level until she again said stop.� He then rubbed her nipples gently, making her
forget the pain. After a few minutes, he began to pinch again and pull her
nipples out, though not enough that she couldn�t take it. Charles was pleased;
she seemed to have a fairly high pain threshold for a beginner.� He moved away from her and reached into the
bag he kept behind the couch for his pegs. He was not too sure if she would be
able to take them yet, but he thought he might as well try.� Cindy saw him get something from a bag he
placed on the couch, but it was not until he was holding the peg up to her nipple
that she saw what it was. 

&nbsp;

�I am going to put these pegs on your
nipples. Now let me know if they are too much and I will remove them.�� Cindy felt him pull on her nipples a few more
times then watched as he held the open peg over her left nipple. He pushed the
peg down onto her nipple and she was surprised that it didn�t hurt as much as
she thought it would have.�� He repeated
the same thing with her other nipple. �How do they feel? Remember I need you to
be honest with me.��� 

&nbsp;

�They feel OK, I mean, I know they are
there but there is no real pain.� Is that
how they are supposed to feel?�� �They
would feel different to everyone, I am glad you don�t mind them as they look
really good on you.�� Cindy looked down,
thinking how strange it was to see pegs attached to her nipples. Charles
stepped back to look at her, and then reached into his bag for a ball gag.� He saw her look at the gag and take a step back.� 

&nbsp;

�Cindy, I just want to see how you look
with a gag, I promise that if you don�t like it, I will remove it before we go
on. Would you let me try it?�� Cindy had
been thinking about the girl on the stage back at the club and the way the
straps of the gag had looked so tight on her checks.� She had been about to say that she didn�t
want it in her mouth, but after his promise, she decided to at least try
it.� 

&nbsp;

�Ok, I am a bit worried about how it will
feel, but if you really will take it out if I want you to, than I�ll try
it.�� She saw Charles smile and come
closer with the gag in his hand.� He
stroked her hair. �Cindy, I am so glad you are willing to trust me. Now, I need
you to open up wide and let me check the size of the gag.�� She felt him try to push the ball into her
mouth and then go back to the bag to pull out a slightly smaller one.� 

&nbsp;

�Ok, let�s try this on.�� He pushed the ball against her lips and this
time the ball slipped into her mouth.�
She was surprised that the ball was not too uncomfortable, but then she
felt him pulling on the straps. The ball moved further back into her mouth and
she did not feel quite so comfortable anymore.�


&nbsp;

�Cindy, I need you to try to push the ball
out with your tongue.� Cindy tried but couldn�t move the ball, it being well
and truly lodged in her mouth. She found her breathing getting shallow.� Charles came around to look at her, noticing
the look of panic that had come into her eyes.�


&nbsp;

�Cindy, nod if the gag is
too tight.� Cindy nodded, and he loosened the
ball a bit more, so that she could move it a little bit but not push it out
altogether. She felt her breathing return to a more normal pace. Charles came
back around and was pleased to see her looking far more relaxed. �Good, that
seems to be better.� You will have to let
me know if things are too tight. Are you ok to leave the gag in for a while?�

&nbsp;

Cindy thought for a moment, and decided
that now he had loosened the straps she thought she could stand it for a
while.� She nodded and he again stroked
her hair.� 

�Now, I am going to stand behind you and I
want you to use your hands to rub my penis.�
If you succeed in making me cum, I will remove the pegs but if you fail,
they will stay there for longer.�� He
walked around behind her and felt her reach for him. He felt her rub her hands
up and down his cock, as much as her tied hands would allow. 

&nbsp;

Cindy could feel his cock harden as she
rubbed. She had found that if she bent her knees she could reach it
better.� His hands come around and rubbed
her, one hand on her clit and one on her breasts.� She thought back to the last time he had held
her like this, when she was in the club, and hoped he would not leave her
waiting like he had then.� 

&nbsp;

Charles knew that he was about to cum and
rubbed her clit harder.� He heard her
gasps and knew she was close too.� Cindy
felt her orgasm rising again and rubbed Charles even harder,
wanting to make sure he came before she did. It felt strange to try and breath through her nose with the gag in.� Drool ran down her chin and onto her
chest.� She heard him moaning and then
felt a sticky substance on her hands. Once he had cum, she concentrated on her
own orgasm and it wasn�t long before she was cumming too.� 

&nbsp;

Struggling to hold onto her, Charles turned
Cindy around and sat her down on the bed.�
He then sat down beside her, breathing
hard.�� Neither spoke for a few minutes,
as they got their breathing under control.�
Once Charles could speak again, he turned her around so they were
sitting facing each other on the bed. �Cindy, I am very pleased with you. Now I
promised to remove the pegs, but I think I might take off your gag first.� Cindy
was pleased he was removing the gag. It had not been too bad, but she didn�t
like the drool, and her jaw was starting to hurt.� She felt him reach around behind her head and
undo the straps.� As the ball came out,
she could feel the relief in her jaw. 

&nbsp;

�Now, about these pegs.� Tell me what your nipples
feel like now.� Cindy realised she was not really feeling too much. �They
aren�t really sore at all.�� Charles
smiled at her in a way that told her there was something she didn�t know
yet.� �Cindy, let me tell you what will
happen when I remove the pegs. At the moment, the pegs have stopped the blood
flow from getting to your nipples, but when I remove a peg, the blood will flow
back.� You have not had these on for too
long, so it won�t be too intense, but you will feel some pain. Are you ready?�

&nbsp;

Cindy nodded again, knowing now that the
longer they stayed on, the more they would hurt.� She braced herself as he took one peg in his
fingers and opened it.� The feeling of
the blood coming back into her nipple was like nothing she had ever felt
before.� She gasped as he rubbed her
nipple firmly in his fingers.� She looked
up at him and saw a gleam in his eyes that she hadn�t noticed before.� When he went to touch the other peg, she
pulled back.� 

&nbsp;

�Honey, I have to take it off. Now just
take a deep breath and it will be off before you know it. Ready?�� She took his advice and took a deep breath at
the same time as he took off the peg.�
Though she still felt pain as the blood came back, it did not seem to be
as bad as before.� She wasn�t sure how
she felt about what had just happened, the feeling of pain mixed with pleasure
a new one to her.� 

&nbsp;

Charles reflected on what had happened and
decided that he would not push her too far tonight, not that he wouldn�t have
loved to continue.� �Cindy, turn around
so I can untie your hands.� I think we
might leave it there for tonight, unless you want to continue.�� Cindy turned around slowly, part of her
wanting to continue while the more sensible part wanted to stop. When Charles
had untied her wrists, she turned back around to face him.

&nbsp;

�Cindy, what are you thinking?� I could tell that you found it hard when I
took the pegs off. Was it something you never want to do again or have I
managed to spark your interest?� Charles held his breath, waiting for her
answer.� Cindy was considering how to
answer him, her mind a jumble of emotions.�


&nbsp;

�Charles, I am not so sure how I am
feeling, but I still trust you and think that maybe I would still like to
explore more with you, but not tonight.�
It was strange how I just found myself wanting to do as you said, even
though it was all new to me.� Is that how
I should have felt?� 

&nbsp;

�Darling, it is different for every one,
but I certainly would like to think that any girl I am with,
wants to do whatever we do together.� I
am not into forcing someone to do something against their will, which doesn�t
mean I won�t push a few limits.� He could see her looking at him with some
confusion, but choose to wait for another time to give her a more detailed
explanation.� �Ok, I don�t know about
you, but I am feeling quite hungry. Come into the kitchen and I�ll whip us up
something to eat.�� 

&nbsp;

Hearing him use the word whip made Cindy
think back to the scene in the club, but he seemed not to have noticed he had
even said it.� She was still amazed that
this handsome, sexy man wanted her, the girl that she knew others at work
called the mouse.� She had never been
sure if it was because of her mousy brown hair or the way she never said
anything much while at work.� She did
know that they had laughed at her modest clothes and her lack of social
life.� What would they think if they
could see her now?�� 

&nbsp;

�Cindy, do you want to eat?�� �Charles, I am a bit� hungry, but you don�t have to go to
any fuss over me.�� Her words fell on
deaf ears as he was already heading down the hall and she had to almost run to
keep up with him.� On the way, she
noticed the expensive paintings on the wall and the nice thick carpet on the
floor.� As she entered into a large, open
kitchen area, he had already started to pull out some things from the
fridge.� �Can I help?�� �No, I have this under control, though you
can pour us both a glass of wine.�� 

&nbsp;

Again Cindy found herself doing as he asked
and soon she had two glasses of wine ready for them both. Sitting down on a
stool near the bench, she watched as he prepared a simple omelette.� As he sliced up some mushrooms, she watched
his hands, thinking of how they had felt on her body.� Taking a sip of her wine, Cindy thought over
what had to be the most amazing night of her life.� The smell of the omelette cooking made her
feel hungry and when he placed a plate in front of her,
she could hardly wait to take a bite.� 

&nbsp;

�Eat up, don�t let it get cold.� Charles
saw her take a mouthful and then smile as him. �That is wonderful,
you must teach me how to make this some time.� He smiled back, pleased that she
was planning at least one other visit.�
When they had both finished, he asked her something he had been curious
about all night. �Cindy, you can tell me this is none of my business but how
have you managed to remain a virgin?��
Her blush was bright on her face and I thought she was not going to
answer me. She busied herself with putting the dishes in the sink, before she
came back and sat down again, this time looking at me with a serious look on
her face.

&nbsp;

�Charles, I am not usually like this. I
can�t tell you how many nights I have sat at home and dreamed of meeting a man
like you. I have never been popular and before tonight, no one had ever said I
was beautiful or sexy. I guess what I am trying to say is that as I didn�t get
asked out, and I wasn�t really the type to go out and find someone, I never
really had the opportunity.� She wasn�t looking at him and he could see that
telling him had been hard.

&nbsp;

Reaching out, he lifted her face and gently
kissed her. When he pulled back, he could see she had tears in her eyes.
�Cindy, I didn�t mean to upset you, I was just curious. I suppose the big
question is do you want to do something about changing it.�� 

&nbsp;

Cindy had dreamed of the man who would take
her virginity and although Charles was more than she could have hoped for, the
knowledge of his love of bondage made her pause.� She knew that if she had sex with him, she would
want to stay and as yet, she had not made up her mind if she wanted to find out
more about his lifestyle. Standing up, she walked over to the sink and poured
herself a glass of water. She was confused, wanting so much to experience sex,
especially with a man such as Charles.� 

&nbsp;

Knowing he was waiting for an answer, she
made her way back to where Charles was sitting.�
He held out his arms to her and she just fell into them. �Cindy, as much
as I want to make love to you, you do know it is your choice.�� Being held in his arms, Cindy did feel safe
and wanted, but she could not get all she had seen and heard tonight out of her
head. It was just such a new world and she felt like a child trying to find
their way around a new school.� She
decided she had to be brave and talk to him about it, or else he might just
think she didn�t want him.

�

Unhooking herself from his arms, Cindy
moved to sit back on her chair. Taking a deep breath, she began to try to
explain what she was feeling. �Charles, I want so much for you to teach me all
the things I have been missing but there is something worrying me.� She paused
and could see him looking with concern at her.�
�What is it love, you know you can tell me
anything.�� �Charles, even though I have
just met you, I can tell you are an honest and caring man, however I am not
sure if I am ready to submit myself to you. I mean with the bondage and stuff.
It is just all so new and a bit scary too.��


&nbsp;

Charles replaced a strand of hair that had
fallen down across her face.� �Cindy,
listen to me.� Though I love bondage and
I certainly like my girls to like it too, I would never make you submit to me
if you didn�t want to.� However, I would
love to be the one to show you the joys of sex.�� He could see she was thinking hard and
decided to give her some time to think about things.� �Cindy, how about you go and have a bath, and
think about this.� I have a few phone
calls to make anyway, so you can have some time to yourself. Would you like
that?�� 

&nbsp;

Nodding, Cindy followed Charles into a
beautiful bathroom and watched as he filled the bath with bath oils.� By the time the bath was full, the room was
filled with the aroma of lavender.�
Charles left the room and she sighed as she stepped into the bath. She
relaxed back onto the pillow that was stuck to the bath and let the water
soothe her body.� Charles� offer to take
her virginity kept going through her mind and by the time she heard him outside
the door, she knew she had made up her mind.

Chapter 4

&nbsp;

When Charles re-entered the room, Cindy was
already half way out of the bath and reaching for a towel. She knew what she
wanted but had to be certain he would agree to her terms. �Charles, thank you
letting me have some time to think but I have to be talk to you about something
first.�� She saw him nod and quickly
dried off so he would not have to wait for long.� Wrapping the towel around herself, she headed
back to his room, Charles following along behind her. Once in his room, she sat
down on the bed, tapping the bed for Charles to join her.� 

&nbsp;

�Charles, I have made a decision but you
need to agree to something first.� Charles nodded and Cindy took a deep breath
before continuing.� �As I said before, I
am not sure if I am ready to find out more about bondage yet but I don�t want
to leave without letting you make love to me. I just need you to agree not to
become upset with me if I want to take things slow or even if I need to
stop.� There is also one more thing I
need to know, what happens tomorrow?�� 

&nbsp;

Charles looked at her and wasn�t too sure
what to say. He certainly didn�t want this to just become a one night stand but
wasn�t sure either if he would want to be involved in a relationship that did
not include at least some elements of bondage.�
He could see her worried expression when he didn�t answer straight away
and could not stop her when she moved to the other side of the room.�� �Cindy, to be honest with you, I really
don�t know. I don�t want you to think I do this type of thing all the time
either, because I don�t. I can�t promise that I would want to carry on a
relationship if you decided you never wanted to experiment with bondage again
but I also don�t want that to influence your choice too much either.�� 

&nbsp;

Cindy turned around to face him, her face
looking pensive as she considered his words. Coming back to sit on the bed, she
reached up to kiss him softly.� He had to
fight the urge to take control, instead gently running his hands through her
hair.� When she pulled back, she looked
like she had made up her mind. �Charles, I usually worry about everything but I
have tried my best tonight not to.� So,
to hell with tomorrow and let�s just enjoy tonight!� 

&nbsp;

She pulled off the towel and lay down on
the bed. Charles moved to get a condom from his drawer and once it was on,
straddled her body.� He knew that more
then ever he needed to go slow and hoped he could withhold his natural
urges.� Leaning down he kissed her, at
the same time letting his fingers explore her pussy. He was pleased to note that
she was wet and moved a bit deeper inside of her, hearing her breath getting
shorter the faster his fingers moved.

&nbsp;

Breaking off the kiss, he looked down at
her only to see her eyes closed.� Not
wanting to spoil her moment, he used his other hand to fondle her breasts, her
moans growing louder.� He found her clit
and rubbed on it and before he knew it, she was cumming.� He watched as her body shook and then she
opened her eyes in what seemed to be surprise. Charles did not want to wait too
much longer and moved so that his cock was poised at the entrance to her now
very moist pussy.� Keeping eye contact he
gently pushed in until he met her resistance and bent down to kiss her as he
pushed more firmly until he could feel it give way.� Her groan of pain was quickly replaced by
ones of pleasure as he moved very slowly in her. 

&nbsp;

Cindy thought she had never felt anything
as wonderful as Charles� cock moving inside of her. It had hurt when he had
first pushed in but the feeling had soon faded to be replaced by the
toe-curling feeling that was washing over her body. Without realising what she
was doing, she lifted her arms up over her head like they were tied there and
it wasn�t long before Charles was holding them in his own hand.� He was moving faster now and his thrusts were
starting to rock her body up and down. The strange part though was that she
only felt like she wanted him to go faster. �Faster, Charles, do it faster.� 

&nbsp;

He looked at her with some surprise and
then he did as she asked and began to thrust even faster into her. Cindy�s mind
began to spin as her orgasm approached and then her mind was filled with
nothing but the feelings in her body as her biggest orgasm yet rocked her.� By the time she was recovered enough to be
aware of what Charles was doing, he was in the middle of his own orgasm.
Charles collapsed on Cindy and she could feel his chest rising and falling on
top of hers.� He still had her hands
above her head and as he raised his head to look at her, she could only smile
up at him.� 

&nbsp;

Charles let go of her hands and rolled
over, while Cindy pulled her hands down and just lay back in total
relaxation.� After a few minutes, Charles
propped himself up on one elbow and ran his other hand down her breast. �Well,
what did you think?�� Cindy tried to
figure out how to put what had just happened into words. �It was.. it was
wonderful!�� She knew she wasn�t being
very descriptive, but it was all her brain could come up with at the time.� Charles smiled at her. � I thought so.� If you want to have a shower, feel free
otherwise I don�t know about you but I need to get some sleep.� Don�t go worrying about what will happen
tomorrow, will you.�� 

&nbsp;

Charles kissed Cindy one more time before
he rolled over and was soon snoring. Cindy lay awake for a bit longer, thinking
of how this one night had changed her life forever.� She also realised something else, she was not
so sure she didn�t want to explore more bondage with Charles. She rolled over
to cuddle up to him and smiled as she thought of telling him her decision to
find out more about him and his lifestyle.�
She felt at peace and knew her life would never be dull and boring
again.



The end.
