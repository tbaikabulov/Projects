His Dove

Synopsis:      He sneaks up on her. Really nothing happens, just something quick I wrote...






It was a field made for wandering. The lush green grass grew so soft that it practically begged to be crushed under bare feet, and her dress was tugged by a wind that blew refreshingly on the warm spring night, carrying the fresh smells of lively earth through the tender air. Beyond the regal crown of the swaying trees that grew in a halo around the field, the sky hung like a bolt of velvet cloth above her head, inky and mysterious and content, all at once, and coated with a veil of bright glimmering stars all vying for attention.

Eric stood under the heavy stone archway at the entrance to the field, upon which a carved faun, Pan, god of fields, stared restlessly down at all who would enter. Dusting off his coat and leaning against the stone, he watched her from the shadowy gated area as she skipped back and forth, her little candles spread in shimmering circles about her. Their tiny flames seemed to mirror the stars above as she moved between them, tending to her garden of lights. He lingered patiently, his mind intent on mischief, as she went about her task, carefully manipulating her tripod and photographing her glittering garden, her Tuesday night�s homework, overdue, as he knew from the email she had sent him that morning. He knew, too, that she thought him to be still overseas, and wouldn�t expect him back for a week at least.

At length she seemed finished, for she began putting the camera equipment away. He smiled, and used her distraction to his advantage, gradually moving along the ring of trees until he was behind her, careful to use the obscuring gloom of the shadows to keep himself concealed. Eric smirked to himself as she bent over the candles, mindfully blowing them out one by one, her back to him. As the darkness crept forward with each extinguished candle, so did he, until at last she blew out the final light and he swiftly put his arms about her and drew her toward him, eliciting a sharp gasp from his unsuspecting prey. He laughed aloud.
�So, I�ve caught you at last, my pet!�
�Eric! You villain!� She grinned in breathless surprise, and strained against his grip half-heartedly. Embracing her tightly, he gave her a pinch, �Now, none of that, little dove.� She tilted her head up to kiss him as she rested against his chest, and lay soft and compliant in his arms. Raising a brow as she looked questioningly up at him, she asked, �What were you doing then, sneaking up on your little dove?� A dark grin. Eric held her close. �Quickening her interest, awakening her blood, warming her up for the time I�ll need comfort, maybe.� �You�d terrified her.� �Of course I frightened her. �Tis the best way to enrich her imagination and guarantee her curiosity, for she�ll want to test herself against me? and all the time tremble for enslavement. Don�t I frighten you?�

And, kissing him again, she smiled in secret delight, and trembled.
