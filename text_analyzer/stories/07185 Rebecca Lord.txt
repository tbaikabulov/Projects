Synopsis: An arrogant company director learns her true place in the world the hard way 






The offices of Marley Johnson Associates were unremarkable. The street they were in was nothing out of the ordinary; the small English town that surrounded the offices was similar to many other prosperous towns up and down the country. Marley Johnson was a medium size accounting firm. Business was good and as such the well-known local firm had no problem in recruiting local staff. One of those was Rebecca Lord, director of Personnel Recruitment. Rebecca hadn&#8217;t gone to university, one of the few in the company who had not. She had started as an admin assistant straight from school and worked her way through the company. Being ambitious she had managed to make herself useful to Mr Charnley, one of the elder statesmen of the company. Having been his secretary she managed to convince him of the need for a Personnel department, run by her of course.

And now here she was, a director of a prestigious company. The road to the top hadn&#8217;t been easy. She had trampled on some people and abused the goodwill of others. Some were impressed by her aggressive, go-getting attitude. Others were intimidated by her abrasive manner particularly her subordinates who were often upset by her demanding nature. She had, unbeknown to her, made many enemies. However while old man Charnley was manager of the company she could do no wrong. And she knew it.


Rebecca Lord lay back in her chair and surveyed the large office with a smile. She had everything, at 28 she was Personnel Director of a large, respected, easy-going firm, nice house, nice company car, impressive salary, and even if she said so herself the looks and the brains to go with it. She was single she was in control of her life she was going places.
She leaned over and spoke into the intercom.
�Tanya in here now please�
Tanya Reeves was her secretary just out of school and in Rebecca&#8217;s opinion something of a non-entity. Clever though went to the local girls&#8217; Grammar. That was a black mark as far as Rebecca was concerned. She didn&#8217;t really like &#8216;book-clever&#8217; girls. They were usually swots with none of the real-life experience that she herself had accumulated. And any way who wants a clever girl in the office? Usually they were too big for their boots. Could be a rival one day. Rebecca smiled as she remembered requiring the girl to come to her interviews in her smart grammar school uniform. Remembering her embarrassment at having to come to the office in it. Kept her in her place though.
A knock at the door
�Enter�
�You wanted me Rebecca?�

Rebecca looked up as Tanya entered. Whilst not exactly fat Tanya could well be described as buxom. She was quite tall and well developed. She had jet- black hair and brown eyes.

�Yes Tanya as you are aware head office is about to land us with some sort of management whiz-kid to replace old Mr Charnley. Therefore I need the work I left you typed, copied and left on my desk by 9.00am tomorrow morning. In triplicate.�
�But Rebecca I..I will never finish all that by 5.30 �
�So?�
�Well I&#8217;ve got to meet someone tonight.�
To be honest Tanya that&#8217;s not my problem. What I want is that work on my desk before you leave tonight, do you understand?�
�Y.Yes Rebecca�
Spineless wimp thought Rebecca any way who on earth would be interested in you?
�In fact for your cheek young lady I would like my office to be thoroughly tidied before you go as well, understood?�
�Yes Rebecca, sorry Rebecca.�

Idly Rebecca imagined taking the submissive girl across her own stocking clad knees, raising her skirt and spanking the insolence out of her. Maybe that pleasure lay in the future. Being fairly small herself, a little over five feet and one inch, she preferred her subordinates to be bigger than herself. It gave her a strange feeling of pleasure ordering them around. 
Also her assistant&#8217;s taste in clothes and her general appearance was irritating Rebecca. Why did she have to dress in such a frumpy way? Why were her choices of colours so dull?

�Oh and Tanya, try and smarten yourself up tomorrow for God&#8217;s sake. Let&#8217;s try and make an impression on the new boy.�
�Yes, I&#8217;ll try Rebecca.� Said the girl blushing.
�Try hard Tanya because if you are as dowdy tomorrow as you are today then I&#8217;ll send you home to change into your old school uniform. Do you still have it hung in your wardrobe.�
�Y..Yes Rebecca.�
�Would you like that? Having to work in the office in your school uniform? Now that would make an impression on our new director.�
�N.n.no Rebecca�
�Smarten yourself up then! Look at me at least I make the effort.�

Her thick designer-cut brunette hair tumbled over her shoulders, she wore an expensive grey pinstripe suit with a short skirt, sheer black stockings and 3 inch red heels. Of course her make-up was perfect. She liked to make an impression. That was part of her job as she saw it. She aimed to intimidate and titillate the men she met in business. That policy had worked very well with old Mr Charnley. She smiled to herself when she remembered the little old man&#8217;s pathetic attempts at flirting with her. The whispered threat of a sexual harassment case had worked wonders at crushing her manager&#8217;s puny libido. When she could no longer ignore his gnarled old hands &#8216;accidentally&#8217; brushing past her when they moved about the office.

As far has her assistant and her other female colleague were concerned she dressed to impress merely to intimidate them. All other women and especially female management were simply competition that had to be pressured and bullied until they saw thing her way or better still resigned and left the company. In her mind&#8217;s eye she saw the legend Marley Johnson Lord above the offices.

�Until tomorrow then Tanya�

She dismissed her assistant.
At four p.m. she gathered her things together and left her office. Over her right shoulder somewhere she could hear the sounds of the photocopier 
whirring away. 
&#8216;That will teach the little madam&#8217;. She smiled grimly to herself,
As she wandered downstairs towards the car park she could feel the eyes of the workforce as she headed for the exit one and a half-hours early. &#8216;The perks of management&#8217;. She smiled again.

As she drove home in her smart company car she idly speculated on the identity of her new boss. Perhaps it would be Stevens from the London branch. She half hoped it would be, the little twerp. Better still John Neil. She sniggered to herself when she remembered turning down his offer of dinner at some seminar they had both attended. The look on his face had been simply priceless. He was obviously an admirer and she would soon turn that to her advantage.


The following morning Rebecca was surprised to see a strange woman sat at her desk.
�And you might be?�
�My name is Angela Stone, your new MD,� She replied coldly.
�Oh� said Rebecca momentarily surprised �It&#8217;s just that we were expecting.....�
�Yes I know what you were expecting.�
She wasn&#8217;t a beautiful woman but she had slate grey eyes, which bored into the back of Rebecca&#8217;s head. She was large and imposing, certainly not fat but a strong-looking woman. A woman used to getting her own way. She was dressed in a black suit with a pale blue silk blouse; she wore horn-rimmed glasses and wore her blonde hair scraped into a bun.

�You I assume are Mrs Lord?�
�It&#8217;s Ms Lord actually�
�Oh is it really?�

The two women glared at each other. Neither willing to give an inch

�Yes Angela it is. I have worked for this company building up this department for ten years. I think I deserve a little respect. Don&#8217;t you?�
�Indeed you do Ms Lord.�

 She stood and offered her hand.

� I apologise if I upset you. Let&#8217;s not get off on the wrong foot. I feel that you and I will be working with each other very closely in the coming weeks.�

Rebecca took the proffered hand trying to ignore the fact that her new superior towered over her and had a bone-crushing grip as well. Up close it was apparent that she also had beautiful unflawed skin and perfect white teeth.
For the next few days the office operated in much the same way as it always had done. Angela Stone was introduced to all the staff and made a couple of well-received speeches. She appeared to settle in seamlessly. She had a natural aura. People respected her. She didn&#8217;t need to shout or cajole to get the best out of her workforce. She simply requested and her staff carried out her wishes. Everything appeared to be going very well. Everybody appeared to be happy. Well, not quite everybody. Rebecca 
Lord had begun to actively dislike the woman. She was everything that Rebecca hated. Obviously well educated, very well spoken and always immaculately dressed. She simply reeked of old money and good breeding. Her very appearance evoked disturbing memories for Rebecca. She reminded her of a particular prefect at her boarding school in Surrey who had managed to make her life a misery. Both had that similar air of assumed authority that only wealth and power could bring. In short Angela Stone was everything that she herself aspired to be. When measured next to Angela, which people would surely do, Rebecca could only ever be second best. Not a position that came naturally to her.

What was equally galling for Rebecca was the apparent shine that her new boss had taken to her assistant, Tanya Reeves. For heavens sake why would an apparently rich and sophisticated woman like Angela Stone be interested in a non-entity like Tanya? It simply defied belief. Hearing the two of them laughing together was starting to drive Rebecca mad. What were they giggling about? They weren&#8217;t laughing about her were they? What was there to laugh about? Had she committed some social gaffe she was unaware of? What could they possibly have in common that would exclude her from their little circle? These thoughts seemed to be continually swirling in Rebecca&#8217;s head. So exhausted was she that she decided to leave and go home early. She packed her bag, put on her coat and was walking down the hall towards the lift when she met Angela Stone.

�Ah Ms Lord I didn&#8217;t realise you smoked.�
�I am sorry, I don&#8217;t follow you,�
�I assume you have put your coat on in order to go outside and smoke.�
�No, in fact I don&#8217;t smoke at all.�
�Well then why do you have your coat on in the office at three o clock in the afternoon?�
�I am not feeling too well I..I thought an early finish��
�I think we should get a couple of things straight Ms Lord. Let&#8217;s go to your office.�

Without another word Angela Stone led the way back to Rebecca&#8217;s office. Her long strides made Rebecca almost have to jog to keep up. Once inside she sat on Rebecca&#8217;s desk and began.

�I am not sure how you view your position here at&nbsp; Marley Johnson but the rest of us work a minimum nine to five thirty shift. Why do you feel free to leave at three?�
�As I have said, Angela I don&#8217;t feel particularly well. I think it would be best if..�
�If this were the first or even second time that this happened then I could understand but from what I hear this is becoming a regular occurrence.�
�What do you mean &#8216;a regular occurrence?&#8217; Have you been spying on me?�
�Certainly not Rebecca. However it&#8217;s not as if you sneak out the back way. All the staff can&#8217;t help but notice and it sets a bad example. Don&#8217;t you agree?�

She smiled sweetly and waited for an answer.

�Well I have been under pressure recently Angela and I am feeling a little under the weather. But no you are right.�
�That&#8217;s fine dear you know that if you genuinely need to go early at any time you only have to ask.�
�Yes Angela.�
�I am so glad we had this little chat Rebecca. Oh and by the way I am not in tomorrow so no sneaking off early!�

Angela Stone laughed, as she exited the room, not bothering to wait for an answer
Rebecca slumped in her chair. Had she really just heard that? She &#8216;only had to ask?&#8217; Had she not been so shocked by Angela&#8217;s words she would have screamed in anger. Who the hell did the woman think she was? She only had to ask indeed. She had worked bloody hard at Marley Johnson and now she was required to ask permission to leave the bloody building. Who did that arrogant stuck-up bitch think she was? She would have to learn that nobody treated Rebecca Lord like this and expect to get away with it. 

At that moment there was a knock at the door and Tanya Reeves entered carrying some papers. Still furious Rebecca looked up and saw her young assistant with a pleasant smile on her face. Oh no, she must have heard every word of her humiliating put-down from Angela. That little bitch, eavesdropping again.

�Come here young lady. What are you grinning at? Do you think its&#8217; clever to listen outside my door? Come here and stand in front of my desk.
 ��I wasn&#8217;t grinning Rebecca and I wasn&#8217;t listening at your door.�

But Rebecca wasn&#8217;t convinced. She needed to re-establish her authority in the office

�Do you really think that what you are wearing constitutes smart Tanya? Look at yourself!�

The girl was wearing her usual unflattering sweater and slacks combination. Totally fine thought Rebecca if she was waiting tables or working behind a bar but unacceptable here at&nbsp; Marley Johnson. Doubly 
unacceptable considering that she works for me. 

�Yes I..I think it&#8217;s ok.�

�What did I say to you only last week about your clothes?�
�You said you would send me home to change my clothes if ..if you didn&#8217;t like them.�
 �It&#8217;s not a matter of me not liking them I warned you that you should dress appropriately for your position. As my assistant people expect a certain style and you my dear are very much failing that test. You dress like a shop girl and that&#8217;s perhaps where you should be. Would you rather work behind a counter than here at Marley Johnson? Well I have threatened and I always keep my word Tanya. I want you to report here in my office tomorrow morning at nine-o clock. You will wear exactly what you wore for your final interview here. Which as I recall was your St Clare&#8217;s school uniform. Do you remember it? I went it exactly as you wore it. Tie blazer the lot. Don&#8217;t forget all your cute prefect badges either.�


The next morning a beetroot red Tanya Reeves found herself stood in front of her boss&#8217;s desk dressed horror of horrors, in a school uniform she hadn&#8217;t worn for over a year. Rebecca leaned back with a derisory smile on her face looking her assistant up and down.

�That uniform really suits you Tanya. You look every inch the schoolgirl in it.�

The truth was that Tanya had outgrown her old school uniform and although it was still smart it was too short and too tight especially across her boobs and her bum. 

�I don&#8217;t necessarily want to humiliate you Tanya but this uniform punishment will be a regular feature of your life in my office unless you learn too dress with a modicum of style. Now I want you to go back to your little desk and answer the phone in your best big-girl manner. Do you think you can do that dear?�

Too ashamed to answer Tanya nodded and then turned and fled to the relative sanctuary of her own office.
But that was just the start to her miserable day. Rebecca Stone took every opportunity to humiliate her assistant. Whenever a delivery arrived, it was always Tanya who was called to sign for it. Whenever a visitor came to her office Rebecca called her subordinate into the room on some pretext. At one point, in front of an elderly male client, she made the girl take off her school tie and retie it because it had become loose.
At lunchtime she sent Tanya, minus her coat, into town to buy food. It seemed to the unfortunate girl that everyone in the town had seen her in her old school uniform. The looks and remarks she got especially from lascivious older gentlemen made her blush with shame. Oh this couldn&#8217;t be happening to her. All this for the sake of that old bitch of a boss.

When the office clock signalled the end of the day Rebecca still wasn&#8217;t satisfied. She called her assistant into the room and closed the door after her.
�How was your day young lady. Did you enjoy being the centre of attention and the object of every man&#8217;s dirty thoughts?�

Tanya lowered her head scared that her tears might be seen. Oh how she hated Rebecca Lord right at this moment. She was nineteen years old and stood in front of her manager&#8217;s desk at work in school uniform! What could be more humiliating than this? It wasn&#8217;t as if she had even done anything wrong.

�I think that your lesson needs reinforcing Tanya, don&#8217;t you?�
�I�I�don&#8217;t know what you mean Rebecca.�
�Come around my desk and stand next to me. There&#8217;s a good girl. Now when you were at school Tanya and you did a naughty thing how were you punished?�
�I don&#8217;t know Rebecca I was never very naughty.�
�At my old school naughty girls had to report to their form mistress or their housemistress or in very extreme circumstances to the headmistress. Do you know what happened then Tanya? They were spanked. Either a hand spanking a ruler or the slipper.

Tanya didn&#8217;t reply but her face had gone a pretty shade of pink

�Do you know why I am telling you all this Tanya? 
�No.�
�Because you are about to go over my knee.�


Tanya almost laughed aloud despite the situation.

�You can&#8217;t be serious?&nbsp; You can&#8217;t spank me I am not a child.�
�You&#8217;re certainly dressed like a child and recently you have been acting like one.�
�You still can&#8217;t spank me though. It&#8217;s illegal.�
�That may be true young lady but you will be requesting a spanking from me.�
�How do you mean?�
�It&#8217;s simple Tanya. A well-educated girl like you should have no problems with comprehension. Listen carefully. Your first yearly assessment is coming up this month. The management relies a great deal on the director&#8217;s opinions. Should you receive another bad report from me to go with your half yearly one then I imagine that you and Marley Johnson will soon be parting company. Do I make myself quite clear?�
�That&#8217;s blackmail. You can&#8217;t d��
�Oh but I can do that Tanya. I can do it because you don&#8217;t have the guts to stand up to me. Also because who is going to believe the word of a jumped up shop girl like you against that of a director?�

Tears started to well in Tanya&#8217;s eyes. She knew she should leave right now but she couldn&#8217;t. She simply dare not. Besides if she walked out now where else would she get such a well-paid job at her age? The prospects of promotion in such a large organisation were so good.

�Well Tanya? Are you going to ask me for that deserved spanking across my knee? Or are you going to walk out of this office for the last time?

Slowly, reluctantly Tanya began to lower herself across her superior&#8217;s stocking clad thighs. She felt the hem of her slightly too short grey skirt being lifted from her knickers and placed on her back. Then she felt a finger on each side of her navy schoolgirl knickers. Slowly they were pulled inside out to her knees. Finally she felt Rebecca&#8217;s cold hand resting on her bare buttocks.

�Don&#8217;t you have something you want to ask me Tanya? Don&#8217;t you have a request?
�Erm �er could you please spank my bottom Rebecca?
�Now why would I do such a thing Tanya?�
�Because�because I&#8217;ve been a�a.�

Rebecca&#8217;s hand crashed down on the upthrust buttocks eliciting a shriek from her victim.

�The answer is &#8216;because I&#8217;ve been a naughty girl miss&#8217;. You say it.�
�Because I&#8217;ve been a naughty girl miss�
�Let&#8217;s start again. What is it you want me to do Tanya?�
�Please spank my bottom miss.�
�Why Tanya?�
�Because I&#8217;ve been a naughty girl miss.�
�If you insist young lady.�

Rebecca&#8217;s hand rose and fell with alarming frequency. Ignoring the cries and the pleading she simply slapped the girl&#8217;s buttocks until they were crimson.

�The problem is Tanya.� She gasped between blows. �Is that you have such a large bottom that it takes a lot of time to cover the entire surface. Either you will have to lose some weight or I will have to buy a slipper.�

The implication that this would not be her last spanking was enough to set Tanya wailing again. She squirmed around on the smaller woman&#8217;s lap all thoughts of preserving her dignity gone. Rebecca could not help but notice her young assistant becoming more and more flustered as the spanking warmed her backside. Her legs were scissoring now wider and wider. Dare she put her hand down there? She decided that it was a little too risky with the young girl in her present state. She smiled to herself. There would be plenty of time for that sort of thing later on. Meanwhile her hand gradually slid down her victim&#8217;s legs until she was spanking Tanya&#8217;s plump thighs. These she decided could take quite a lot of punishment. She belaboured them until the entire backs of her thighs were pink. 

�Up you get Tanya.�

She hauled the girl to her feet and was gratified to see her perform a little war dance her hands clasped tight to her buttocks and thighs. Her white hands contrasting sharply with the red of her chastened posterior. Rebecca watched amused for a couple of minutes until impatiently she ordered,

�Put your knickers back on unless you want more of the same.�

Hurriedly the girl struggled into her tight blue panties grimacing as they pulled over her bottom.

�Now take yourself and your wobbly bottom and stand in that corner.� Rebecca indicated the furthest corner from her desk
�Stand to attention, nose pressed against the wall. There&#8217;s a good girl.�

Tanya was left in the corner for thirty minutes. Only interrupted by Rebecca coming across and tucking the hem of her skirt into her knickers and delivering two hefty swats to the backs of her legs before returning to her seat and continuing with her paperwork. Eventually she was dismissed from the room and left with her face almost as red as her chastened backside.


The following morning Tanya arrived at work at the normal time and simply carried on with her duties. She worked diligently but could not look Rebecca in the eye much less acknowledge what had gone on between them. It was if by refusing to meet Rebecca&#8217;s superior smile she could wipe away the previous night&#8217;s humiliation.
She had however &#8216;made an effort&#8217;. She was wearing a skirt and blouse, which were not exactly stylish but were an improvement on her usual attire. Rebecca made her come to the office and then do a twirl to show off her new appearance.

�Are you wearing stockings Tanya?�
�Yes Rebecca.�
�Show me.�
�I�I beg your pardon?�
�For a supposedly clever girl you can be very stupid at times. Lift your skirt and show me your stockings.�

Blushing bright red Tanya lifted her skirt and stood so that her boss could see her black stocking held up by a white suspender belt.

�Turn around slowly again. Better young lady but not ideal. Your skirt is too long and the colour of your blouse doesn&#8217;t really suit you. But at least I don&#8217;t have to put you across my knee again. Well not for now anyway.�

Tanya left the room with the mocking laughter of her manager ringing in her ears and returned to her own desk.



Rebecca really enjoyed her lunch. She was in a very good mood. Business was going well. She was slowly getting the better of that bitch Angela Stone. But best of all her assistant was falling further and further under her control. Whilst she ate her dessert she slowly squeezed her thighs together under the table and considered what further indignities she could visit on her young assistant. Making her wear her uniform had been a masterstroke. Not only did it belittle Tanya but it also emphasised the gulf in seniority between them. Almost as if Tanya expected to be punished whilst wearing it. Somehow she became more malleable, easier to bully. With a jolt of excitement Rebecca realised that was what was turning her on. The opportunity to bully. When she was younger and less experienced she was always the victim of the bullies. Small for her age and very self-effacing she had suffered for other people&#8217;s amusement. Especially at school. Penelope Stanton-Keith. She could remember that bitch&#8217;s name even now. She was hardly likely to forget it. Her parents had scrimped and saved and gone without to send her to St Mary&#8217;s. At first it had been great the excitement of boarding, the thrill of new friends. However it had quickly gone sour. She had for some reason that she had come to the attention of a senior prefect named Penelope Stanton-Keith who had simply decided that Rebecca didn&#8217;t belong at St Mary&#8217;s. From then on she had made her life a misery. It started by Penelope hiding her books and calling her names but it soon escalated. Rebecca&#8217;s few friends were intimidated into abandoning her.&nbsp; Penelope and her little gang would wait for Rebecca and ambush her. Sometimes they would take her to their dorm room, sometimes to an empty classroom. There alone and frightened she would have her accent or her manners mocked by the girls. Then it would progress to hair pulling and slapping. Then the little pocket money she received was regularly taken from her. The final episode involved her being tied across a desk with old ties and school scarves and then being slapped and slippered across her bare backside. Then, after suffering the punishment, she was brought to her first ever climax by a knowing and mischievous hand. That of Penelope Stanton-Keith she assumed.

It was at that moment that a teacher discovered the little group. Of course the school hushed up the whole affair. There was no point in dragging the good name of the St Mary&#8217;s through the dirt. It was even rumoured that Rebecca was somehow in on the whole affair and that she had consented to the acts being carried out on her! Certainly Penelope Stanton-Keith was never held to account. Perhaps the fact that she was the daughter of one of the school governors had something to do with it thought Rebecca bitterly. The only concrete outcome was that Rebecca&#8217;s parents were encouraged to remove her from the school.

But know; now she had the power. She had waited long enough for her revenge. The fact that Tanya Reeves was the innocent party and in fact had done nothing wrong was irrelevant as far as Rebecca was concerned. She had escaped her victim status and was well on the way to exorcising her personal demons. What should her next step be? Ideally she would like to exert even more control over the hapless teenager. Ultimately she would like the girl to be her &#8216;special friend&#8217;. Rebecca had not thought of herself as a lesbian but the thought of the submissive girl lapping at her pussy was almost too much for her to handle. She could feel her left hand straying to the hem of her stylish office suit as she imagined the scenario. Only by an effort of will did she drag herself back to the reality of the little coffee shop in which she regularly ate her lunch. She glanced at her watch. Her lunch hour was virtually up. She had better return to the office.
