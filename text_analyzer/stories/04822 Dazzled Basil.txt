DAZZLED BASIL

&nbsp;

BASIL AND LINDY

&nbsp;

Basil breathed through his nose as
Lucinda rubbed the tip of his cock once again. The Ten o�clock News was now over�and it was time to go to bed. Lindy let
go of Basil�s cock, and watched it bounce with a smile on her face. She patted
Basil�s cheek.

&nbsp;

�Well, another fun night of
television.� Lindy smiled at Basil, who tried to smile back weakly. Since
they�d finished dinner, Basil and Lindy had been sitting on the sofa, Basil�s
pants down as always. Lindy, an ash blonde resplendent in her powder blue tube
top and cut-offs, had been playing with Basil�s cock throughout their TV
watching�mostly during commercials, of course. 

&nbsp;

Lindy liked to focus when �Gray�s
Anatomy� and the news was on. Then Basil, who was unable to focus on the TV,
would sit on his hands while his lovely wife enjoyed her program, and only
slowly returned her hand to Basil�s hard, twitching cock.
Basil got up and nearly tripped over his pants, and Lindy chortled again. As
Basil leaned down to pull them up, Lindy said �Oh, no�I need to get rid of that
distraction. I don�t want you trying to spoon me in bed tonight, Basil, honey.�

&nbsp;

Lindy reached beside the sofa and
picked up the riding crop. �Do you like it, Baze?� It irritated Basil that his
American wife pronounced his name Bay-sil instead of Bah-sil. 

&nbsp;

He looked at Lindy�s new crop.
�Only you would find a fiberglas riding crop, Lucinda.� But his cock was
straining, and she smiled.

&nbsp;

�Well, you need a little more than
the average bear, honey.� Lindy stepped up to Basil. �Hands
behind your back� Lindy giggled, and her powder blue tube top jiggled, which
didn�t help the erection problem any. Basil breathed through his nose
and put his hands behind his back.

&nbsp;

When Basil had first begged Lindy
to dominate him and participate in his teasing and denial fantasies, she�d told
him she wasn�t having any of the ropes and chastity devices. �You�re going to
control yourself, because this is what you want�even when you don�t think you
want it, dear heart.� So he had to hold one wrist with the other.

&nbsp;

Lindy smiled and lifted the fiberglas riding crop. Basil thought desolately that if it
had ever been used on a horse, Lindy would have been jailed by the A.S.P.C.A.
WHACK! Basil�s eyes closed as he commanded all of his will power to keep his
hands behind his back. The sting was unfathomably painful.

&nbsp;

�Did you like that, honey�?�
Lindy�s voice came to Basil�s ears. He gritted his teeth. The scorch right
above his glans was killing him. �Tell Lindy how much you liked it.�

&nbsp;

Basil opened his eyes weakly. �It
was wonderful, Lindy. Thank you for taking the trouble to work with me on my
special needs.� Lindy grinned, tapping the tip of the fiberglas
riding crop against her burgeoning boobs.

&nbsp;

�Well, I do my best to please my
sailor boy.� WHACK! THWACK! WHACK! Three times the crop fell against Basil�s
penis and he shrieked, but did not let go of his wrist. Warming to her work,
Lindy slammed the crop again and again, and was amused to see Basil hopping up
and down, but he did not let go of his wrist, which was all she wanted.

&nbsp;

�Th-thank you Miss Lindy�� Basil
said with tears in his eyes. �Th-thank you�fuh-for taking the troub-trouble to
work�� Basil began crying. His cock hurt so much. Night after night they went
through this, the endless teasing and then the punishments, but he could never
quite get used to it.

&nbsp;

The night before, they�d not
watched television�instead Lindy had sat Basil naked to the cold, metal kitchen
stool, in a sitting position thank God, and she�d stroked his cock as she made
bran muffins�this had gone on for three hours, and then she�d thumped his cock
limp with her fifteen inch two finger tawse. As Basil had screamed in
frustration, Lindy had reminded him that she�d bought it---after he�d picked it
out, and with his Visa card.

&nbsp;

Now, Lindy waited patiently for
Basil to stop crying. She tapped her foot, and Basil whined on. �You know, I
think you need something to cry about�you bitch too much, honey. As Basil�s
eyes widened, Lindy went to the bedroom and came out with a nasty dog whip, and
of course the strap-on.

&nbsp;

An hour later, the much bruised
Basil lay in bed gently, and Lindy rolled in beside him. �It�s so hard to deal
with you some nights, Baze� she said gently, as she kissed Basil�s neck. Her
perfume much aroused Basil�s cock, now denied 74 days. �I have to do so much to
make you get your life together�and now I�m tired, and I need some pampering.�

&nbsp;

Basil looked at Lindy�s beautiful,
full naked breasts and shaved twat, her flat stomach. He smiled �Would you like
a massage, darling?� Lindy smiled assent, and Basil spent an energetic half
hour rubbing his lucky hands all over Lindy�s full buttocks, her soft thighs,
her back, before turning her over and enjoying having his fingers wandering
along her soft breasts.

&nbsp;

Then Basil moved his head down to
Lindy�s sweet vagina and he brought her to three orgasms before she finally
fell asleep around midnight. Basil had to
struggle to keep from touching his rock hard cock as he prayed for sleep, which
didn�t come til about 2 a.m.

&nbsp;

THE NEXT DAY, AT WORK AT WESTERN
COMMONWEALTH WOMEN�S COLLEGE, ENGLISH LITERATURE 201

&nbsp;

� After the assassination of Buckingham in 1628, critics in Parliament turned their
attention to King Charles' religious policy. He angrily dismissed his third
Parliament in 1629� Basil said, as he walked back and forth in front of the
class. His eyes wandered to Evan Parsons, a luxurious brunette, who leaned
back, smiling at him, as her pink sweater bobbed. Basil breathed, but
continued. 

&nbsp;

�Charles
imprisoned several of his leading opponents, and declared his intention of
ruling alone. The eleven-year period of the King's Personal Rule was also
described as the &quot;Eleven Year Tyranny���
Suddenly a hand was raised. 

&nbsp;

A
lovely little white hand with magenta nails. It was Stacy Wintersmith, whose
curly blond hair was quite beguiling. Her long fingers with their pretty nails
waved in the air, and Basil imagined them toying with his cock. As she raised
it higher, to attract Basil�s attention, he could see her breasts rising in her
pro-choice T-shirt. �Get Your Rosaries Off My Ovaries� was ballooning behind
those hot boobs.

&nbsp;

�Yes,
Ms. Wintersmith?� Basil�s cock, now orgasm-less for 75 days, was bulging
against his boxer shorts. He might have to dismiss class sooner so he could
touch himself in his office.

&nbsp;

Stacy
smiled and licked her lips. �I understand that this so-called Tyranny was a
good thing for the English, Professor Naples.� Stacy�s right leg, swathed in
fishnet stocking, crossed her left knee.

&nbsp;

�How
I do like students who do the reading.� Basil smiled benificently. �Yes, Depending on one's political affiliation, this time was
known either as the &quot;Eleven Years' Tyranny&quot; or &quot;Charles'
Personal Rule&quot;�and it was primarily Parliament who felt tyrannized.�� Basil beamed as Stacy Wintersmith smiled at
him, and he looked longingly at her lower pouty lip.

&nbsp;

�Yes,
the Eleven Year Tyranny was initially successful � during the turmoil of the
Civil Wars, many people looked back upon it as a golden age of peace and
prosperity.� Basil gasped silently as another girl, Felicia Tomaso, absently
tucked in her snug top.

&nbsp;

A
gorgeous coppery redhead with blond highlights whose name Basil didn�t know
raised her hand, pulling her striped jersey up over her expansive bosom. �But
isn�t it true, Professor, that Parliament would�nt give the King money?�

&nbsp;

Basil�s
cock was now roaring. �Yes, this is true, but Charles found an ingenious way to
take in money. He decreed anyone who earned
�40 or more each year to present himself at the King's coronation so that he
may join the royal army as a knight, Charles fined all individuals who failed
to attend his coronation in 1626.�

&nbsp;

The girl in the striped jersey
pouted and dimpled at the same time, and her breasts jiggled a bit. �That
doesn�t seem fair, Professor Naples.� Oh God, thought Basil, I may take her
here and now. He smiled. �Well, often life isn�t fair.�

&nbsp;

Basil
continued his talk. �You see, Charles' rule
without Parliament constituted a valid but nevertheless exceptional exercise of
the royal prerogative.� Basil breathed heavily, as the girl dimpled at him. � In former times such rule would have been considered just
but by the middle of the 17th century it was held by many to be an exercise of
absolute power.�

&nbsp;

Then Eva Parsons put her tongue
out just past her lips, and Basil coughed huskily. If he pulled out his dick
and began jerking off, he would be in trouble with Lindy AND would lose tenure
AND would go to jail. But still it was tempting.

&nbsp;

Gamely,
Basil went on��Charles had made peace with Spain and France by 1630. Trade and
commerce grew; the King's finances were stable by 1635. This enabled him to
commission great works of art by Rubens and�� Eva Parsons unbuttoned one of her
top buttons, and it was just too much. �I�I�m dismissing class five minutes
early today.� Basil said. �Remember that we have a test on Wednesday.�

&nbsp;

BASIL�S
OFFICE�WHERE THE ACTION IS!

&nbsp;

Basil
rubbed his cock up and down, as his pants swaddled round his knees in his
stuffy little faculty office. His laptop was up, and Lady Champagne, an
indolent brunette, was rubbing and squeezing her breasts on the webcam. �Are
you enjoying this, Basil?� Champagne purred, as the overheated professor gasped
and rubbed his cock a little faster.

&nbsp;

Champagne�s
webcam cost Basil $8.50 per minute, and she�d been on for nearly an hour since
his seminar had lapsed. �Don�t�don�t you want to cum, Basil, boy?� Champagne
purred at him, and Basil jerked harder. 

&nbsp;

Close�closer!
Basil felt as if he were about to cum, and he released his hand, and sadly
watched Champagne go through her gyrations until his penis finally calmed down
a bit�and then he began rubbing again!

&nbsp;

Champagne
was unbelievable. She had, in the past forty-two minutes, put three different
dildoes in her ass and pussy, she�d sucked a vibrator and made her nipples dance
as the frustrated history professor pounded his cock.

&nbsp;

He
had to slow down a bit, because he was so in danger of spurting�and if he did,
Heaven only knew what Lindy might do to him. Basil�s last accident had resulted
in Lindy running a curling iron up and down his balls for nearly an hour.

&nbsp;

�Come
on baby�you know what you want, don�t you?� Basil rubbed the purplish head of
his penis. He brought the laptop to work every day just so he could use the
computer without the university administration finding out about the porn
sites.

&nbsp;

Before
Basil had gotten the laptop, and discovered Champagne�s wonders, he�d used his
cell phone to call 1-900 numbers until Lindy complained the bills were too
high. Champagne was actually cheaper, though Basil kept her on for long periods
of time, as of course he wasn�t allowed to cum.

&nbsp;

There
was a knock on the office door, and Basil quickly shut off the laptop and
pulled his pants and his underwear over his swollen penis. �Come in, please.�
The door opened and the girl in the striped top entered. Basil smiled, as his
hand moved to the desk to avoid playing pocket-pool.

&nbsp;

�Professor
Naples? Hi, I�m Andria Havens? I was in your class?� Andria shyly pulled her
coppery mane so it partially covered her blue striped top. �Do you have a
moment?� As Basil smiled even wider, and pointed to a chair, Andria sat down
and crossed her legs. Basil was happy to see that miniskirts had not gone out
of style.

&nbsp;

For
forty-five minutes, Andria talked to Professor Basil Naples. First they
discussed her upcoming paper on the role of Oliver Cromwell in the in the
battles of Marston Moore, and then Andria told Charles about her boyfriend, and
her upcoming beach trips.

&nbsp;

As
Andria spoke, she absently picked pieces of lint off her striped top and
crossed and re-crossed her legs. At one point as she was showing her interested
professor a picture of her and her girlfriends in their new bikinis, Andria
toyed with her earlobe and ran her tongue across her teeth�and what a good
listener Professor Naples was!

&nbsp;

�I-I
feel like I can trust you, Professor Naples�you�re so patient, and�your accent
is like public television or something!� Andria giggled. �Do you mind if I take
my sweater off, it�s a little warm in here�but am I taking up too much of your
time, sir?� Andria�s eyes were sincere. �Oh no, no�� Basil responded
enthusiastically. �You are such an intelligent young woman.�

&nbsp;

Andria
threw her striped top onto her bookbag. �I guess you think this halter I have
on underneath is too skimpy� the redhead said, �But I get so hot in this spring
weather, you know? Oh, you are so nice,� she said as Basil turned on a small
fan. �I have to tell someone this, and I�m so ashamed. Everyone here is so
young, and I�m old for a freshman, almost twenty-one. Do I look old?�

&nbsp;

Basil
shook his head vigorously, worrying that his thigh was rubbing too hard against
his almost missile-like prick. Good God, he couldn�t make a mess in here. The
girl pushed her chair around behind his desk so she was looking sincerely at
Basil.

&nbsp;

��I can�t tell any of the girls who go to this
dipshit school the truth about myself�but I used to be a stripper, for nearly
two years after I dropped outta high school..and I gave lap dances. It was so
humiliating� Andria looked intently at her professor and rubbed his hand with
her fingers.

&nbsp;

�L-lap
dances? I don�t think I�m familiar�� Basil had only been in the country a
couple of years after he�d finished up at King�s College, Oxford. As Andria
bent over to tell him more, her halter top cleavage nearly opened up, and he saw
Nirvana. �Is it a sort of� fox-trot, or
like the American Hustle dance?�

&nbsp;

�I
never heard of those.� Andria said simply. �It�s a terrible, dehumanizing thing
for a woman to have to endure, Professor Naples.� She shook her red mane and it
danced over her shoulders and breasts. 

&nbsp;

�P-please,
Andria, call me Basil. If-if you�re not comfortable discussing this��
Basil� wiped his forehead. �I know it
must�ve been painful, dancing�was it cage dancing?�

&nbsp;

Andria
laughed. �Naw. Wait, and I�ll show you. I can�t believe you never had one.� She
got up and skipped over to the door of Basil�s office, and locked it from the
inside, and came back before he knew it.

&nbsp;

Flipping
on Basil�s clock radio, Andria flipped stations until a Bee Gees oldie came on.

&nbsp;

�It�s
so offensive, and now I�m a Women�s Studies major, but I can�t explain a lap
dance, I gotta show you, Professor Basil.�

&nbsp;

As
the soft tones of �How Deep is Your Love� filled the narrow little office,
Andria stood back from Basil, placing one foot on the floor between his feet
and the other on the arm of the chair.

&nbsp;

Basil
listened, transfixed to the song, as the girl swayed her hips slowly with the
music, and Barry Gibb sang:

�

�I know
your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I wanna feel you in my arms again�

&nbsp;

Andria shook her chest in Basil�s face, and twitched her rear
end, staring straight into Basil�s eyes. She stroked her breasts and licked her
lower lip as the song went on:

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

.� Then you come to me on a summer
breeze
Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love�

�Basil began breathing� quite heavily and Andria winked at
him, taking her foot off the arm of his chair and poking him gently in the
crotch�and Gibb sang on�


�How deep is your love, how deep is your love
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me�

Andria ran her hands over her stomach
and breasts, looking as if she was giving herself an incredible massage. She
closed her eyes in ecstasy as if she was having an orgasm.

The voice filled the
room as Andria absently turned up the volume on the radio:

�I believe in you
You know the door to my very soul
You're the light in my deepest darkest hour
You're my saviour when I fall�

Andria slowly removed her halter top,
and then her skirt, gyrating her hips� wildly. Basil felt as if he might
explode. 

�And you may not think
I care for you
When you know down inside that I really do
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love�

Then Andria removed her bra, her panties
and began unhooking her old fashioned garter stockings, while still caressing
herself occasionally. She smiled at Basil, and he gaped back at her,looking like a calf about to be slaughtered. 

My God, she�s naked,
Basil thought�a naked girl in my office. Look at those beautiful pendulous
breasts, not fake like Champagnes�goodness!

Andria leaned into Basil, letting him
smell her perfume, and rubbed her bare breasts in his face, keeping the nipples
just out of his mouth�s reach. Then she spun, rubbing her delicious buttocks
into Basil�s lap.

�Grinding her buttocks against his taut pants,
she hummed along with the Bee Gees song, and as she felt Basil rubbing his
crotch back against her.

Andria ran her long hair up and
around Basil�s shoulders and along his chest. And suddenly she was sitting in
his lap, pushing her bare buttocks against his swelling crotch, and whispering
in Basil�s ear. �You see how humiliating that would be for a woman?� Andria whispered. Basil groaned in
response�

�It�it must be
horrible for you� Basil croaked. �I-I can�t believe you had to degrade yourself
like that.� Andria looked at Basil with glowing eyes. 

�You understand! Finally, a man who understands, and doesn�t want to cheapen a
girl!� Enthusiastically, Andria gave Basil a huge kiss on the
lips, smearing her Bonne Bell Lip Smacker Lip Gloss all over Basil�s cheeks. 

Hopping off Basil�s lap, Andria began dressing. �You are a wonderful man, Professor
Naples�and I won�t call you by your first name�I respect you too much.� As she
walked out, Andria waved at Basil�s sweating face cheerily.

Outside the door, Andria tapped a few buttons into her cell phone. �Hey
Lindy�yeah, it was fine. I don�t even think he knows I�m not in his class.� Andria giggled. �No, that�s okay. You have to pay the
bachelor party company for my services, but you don�t owe me a tip�that was
hysterical�and no, he didn�t cum.�

�Andria listened again, laughed, and shut off the phone.
Twitching her miniskirt, the 34 year old stripper clicked down the hallway,
drawing scandalized�
views from the old bags in the Faculty Lounge.
