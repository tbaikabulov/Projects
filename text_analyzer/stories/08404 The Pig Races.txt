Stacey knew very well that she was too old to still be living like this.

At 29 years old, Stacey lived very much like she had lived when she was 23. She was still a waitress working nights at the Rib Crib Bar and Grill, she was still occasionally being set up on dates by her friends and she still had no idea what her future would one day look like. 

As the seasons rolled by Stacey, she was becoming increasingly fearful that her future might look similar to&nbsp; her present. She knew that she needed to find �her man� and she knew that time was not really on her side anymore. She had now moved past that point in her life where meeting available younger guys was easy. The once high standards that she set for a men had been steadily dropping over the last few years but her Romeo was still not in sight. 

It was not that Stacey wasn&#8217;t pretty, she was in fact a very nice looking girl. Although she stood only five feet four inches tall, she had a nice set breasts and real �girl next door� kind of charm. Although at such a pedestrian height she had never been called �leggy,� her short legs topped off nicely with a large and well-rounded behind. When she was 22 she had received a lot of compliments about how great her butt looked in a pair of jeans but lately she heard compliments like that less often. Sure, her butt was a little bit bigger than it once was, but most guys still seemed to like it and she thought it a strength. She had signed up for a gym membership a while back but she didn&#8217;t seem to find time to work out as often as she wanted to.

Stacey wore her blonde hair long and straight. She knew it wasn&#8217;t really the style anymore but she also knew that a lot of men like both blondes and long hair so she had kept to her familiar style. Her hair was a light colored blonde but it was not as full as she would have really liked. Stacey had a good completion and she had straight white teeth. It was her smile that her friends actually thought was her most endearing feature. It was a wide smile and it completed her face wonderfully. Stacey had joy in her heart and she showed it easily.

Stacey always carried a happy disposition and she was well liked by most of her coworkers at the restaurant. Some people might call her a bit plain but she had an easy manner and&nbsp; a wholesome charm and that made her quite appealing.

In her free time she spent a lot of time working on her MySpace page. Her page had lots of pictures of both her and her friends and it detailed her interests and activities very well. Most of her closer friends were now married and she looked at the internet as a way she could advertise herself to her future husband. In spite of all her efforts, Stacey was receiving far less views on her page than she did when she put it together a few years back. She heard most people were using FaceBook now and she was planning a move.

A few months ago she had a little reluctantly posted a full gallery of pictures of both herself and her friend posing down at the river in their bikinis. She checked the gallery almost every day but she still hadn&#8217;t received very many comments about her pictures. Mostly she was getting kind words from her girlfriends telling her how hot and sexy she looked. That was nice but it wasn&#8217;t exactly what she had been hoping for.

Stacy really needed to find �the one.� Her friends&#8217; lives had mostly moved on now and she really wanted to join them in the adult world. Besides using the internet, she had a few other strategies that she used in order to find new guys. While she was at work she spent a lot of effort making sure that she always knew if any groups of men were hanging out inside the bar area. This spot in the restaurant had reluctantly become her own little �hunting ground.� In particular she looked for businessmen that came in together as a group, she felt privately that it was in just such a setting she would find her guy.

Many of the men Stacey had been dating were slightly older than her 29 years and many were coming off failed marriages. Unfortunately for Stacey, she had proven to be little more than a �rebound� girl for these type of older men. When they met Stacey they would be very interested in her and typically they would&nbsp; begin a very passionate sexual relationship with her very early on. The sex would become very regular and she would dutifully comply with any of their sexual wishes. Stacey was a pleaser and she made her men happy.

Later on she would find out that the men �just weren&#8217;t ready to get back into another relationship� and in spite of all the reassurance and the liberal amount of oral sex she gave to them they would eventually lose interest in her and drift away. In a couple of cases, she had found out later that they had returned to their wives. Stacey couldn&#8217;t really figure out what she was lacking and she didn&#8217;t really understand what she was doing wrong. Why can&#8217;t I keep a man? That question sometimes drove her (and more often her girlfriends) crazy.

It was on a Friday night at about 10:00 when she first saw Ray Porter. He was standing at the bar with a group of his friends when the two made eye contact for the first time. Making eye contact with a single waitresses was something many men did, but when Stacey made contact with Ray, it was a long and hard hit�..she knew that he was for real and she knew she had to meet him. Maybe he was �the one.� Maybe her Romeo had appeared just where she had always envisioned he might.

Ray had been ordering a beer at the bar when he first saw Stacey. As he watched her short choppy strides and as he looked upon the muscular swell of her ass he knew she had great potential. He had kept his eye on her for more than twenty minutes before she saw him. He could see that she was not wearing a wedding band and he watched as her eyes were constantly scanning over all the men in the busy bar. He had a strong feeling that she might be exactly what he was looking for; she just might be �his first champion.�

Ray was 27 and he had been involved with female pig racing for a number of years. It was a sport that was very popular in both Kansas and Missouri. The sport involves very compliant woman racing each another on their hands and knees for the visual pleasure and the gambling challenge of a large group of men. The woman are stripped to a g-string and they raced each other around specially built courses to win small prizes but mostly to avoid the terrible punishment inflicted upon them if they lose. It is not a sport for proud women, the female pigs run the race course for many reasons but pride and vanity were not among them.

In order for a man to watch and bet these races, he had to procure and ready his own race pigs. Once a member of this special group, he is free to invite one or two of his friends. Most of the men who have become involved with the races initially brought in their clingy wives or desperate young girlfriends and had forced them to participate in the races as the price of keeping the relationship. Some of the better pigs came from the growing ranks of single young moms but all the race pigs share one thing in common: they will do anything to stay with their man. It is almost universally the quality that these woman share. 

A couple of the pigs have raced for many years and are clearly mentally ill but they are allowed to participate because their unpredictable behavior spices up the racing action. 

The more experienced players like Ray were always scouting for woman who could be brought into the sport. Not every woman can be made into a race pig. Those who have high self esteem or strong father figures are very difficult to recruit. Ray knew that a great race pig needs to be built strongly, but she must also be very determined and have a great need for a man. Ray could read people well and this quality served him well while looking for new recruits.

Ray understood well that is was a unique marriage of many qualities that made a champion race pig. In order to win the seasonally awarded �Blue Ribbon� the pig has to be something very special and as he watched Stacey perkily bounce around the restaurant he began to think that she could be his special pig. 

�That is my prize pig� he calmly told his friend Mike. Mike watched Stacey as she scurried an order out to a far table. �Big hips, a quick stride and about the perfect age for racing� Ray told him softly, �with a little training she could be a very tough little race pig.�

On her way back through the bar Mike watched as Ray made and held his first eye contact with Stacey. As Mike watched Stacy flush he said back to Ray, �you know you might just have a shot with that one brother.� Both men laughed a bit nervously because they understood that Stacey was a great prospect but she was a long way from the racetrack. 

With that first look, Ray began the recruitment period with Stacey. After another drink Ray walked over to the bar and had a delightful conversation with her. Later, they both told friends that it had gone �very well.�

They began dating the next weekend. Ray took her to Jack Stack BBQ and they both enjoyed a great meal. After dinner, Ray took her to his large house in Overland Park and they enjoyed another glass of wine and had a long conversation all about Stacey&#8217;s life and her unfulfilled hopes and dreams. 

She told Ray about all the problems she had experienced with men and they both laughed at her stories of heartbreak and frustration. Ray admitted that he too had spent a long time looking for �the right woman� and Stacy was thrilled to hear that he was already confiding those type of thoughts to her.

Much to her delight Ray asked Stacey back a few nights later and offered to make her dinner. Ray made her a very large bowl of spaghetti and it made her feel wonderful that he wanted to cook for her. Much to Stacey&#8217;s embarrassment she had gone through the entire meal not knowing that she had a tiny splash of spaghetti sauce on her chin. When Ray finally mentioned it to her they both laughed. When dinner was finished they watched a movie and Ray held her softly by his side. Before she left for her apartment Ray kissed her for the first time. It was a magical moment for both of them.

Over the next few weeks Ray treated Stacey with great respect and kindness. He never pushed himself on her sexually in any way. Stacey was so �over the moon� for Ray that she had told her friends and family all about him and she had secretly changed the status on her MySpace page to �in a relationship.� It was only two weeks later when Ray first told to Stacey that he loved her.&nbsp; She squealed with joy and jumped into his waiting arms and cried �I LOVE YOU TOO!�&nbsp; She continued to cry and Ray held her tightly in his arms. He could feel her shaking and was very optimistic about the all progress they were making.

Later that night the two went into Ray&#8217;s bedroom and they had sex for the very first time. Stacey enjoyed having sex with Ray but was a little confused about his insistence about having sex with her in the �doggy style� position. She wanted him to be on top of her but he was adamant that he wanted to have sex with her from behind. 

�Well maybe my butt isn&#8217;t too big after all� she contented herself. When Ray had finished cleaning his sperm from her ass and lower back he lay next to Stacy and she felt wonderful. It seemed to Stacey that she was on her way now and her future might be beginning to fall into place.

Ray&#8217;s thinking about the sex that night had been a little bit different, �Pigs get fucked from the rear, nobody wants to look at a pig as they fuck them.� It was something that he had learned early on when he first started recruiting and training new pigs.

The next afternoon at her parents house Stacey told her Mom that Ray had said that he loved her. The two woman stood together in the kitchen and cried openly. After all the years of working at the restaurant and all of Stacey&#8217;s false starts, she had finally met the man of her dreams. Ray was successful, he was loving and had even mentioned maybe one day starting a family.

Stacey&#8217;s Mom could now relax, it looked like the grandchildren that she had so wanted from her only daughter might finally be on the way. She was so very happy for Stacey. They spent well over an hour talking about Ray and about Stacey&#8217;s future. Stacey eventually confided to her Mom that she and Ray had �made love.� the previous night. Reluctantly her Mom smiled and quietly congratulated her. Stacey&#8217;s mom was a woman of high moral character but she was also a practical Midwestern woman; she knew the score.&nbsp; It was a great night.

�Finally!� Stacey&#8217;s Mom said to her husband Brian after the excited twenty nine-year-old girl had left the house. Stacey&#8217;s Mom and Dad clutched each other for a long time after she left. Both were very relived that their daughter might now have&nbsp; the life that they had always wanted so badly for her. It was the day the older couple had waited a long time to see and it had now quite suddenly arrived. Later that night the two of them made love together for the first time in many years. 

For Ray this part was always the hardest. He knew going that this is what is required when recruiting a new pig but he hated all the time it took. �All the fucking conversation� he told his friend Mike. �Blah blah blah blah fucking blah.� But Ray knew that winning over the friends and family were an important part of the procurement process. It was not his favorite part but he kept at it.

When the day eventually came for Stacey&#8217;s first race she would need an awful lot of motivation to go through with it. �The price of participation in the racing must be less that the price of ending the relationship� it was the mantra of all successful recruiters. Ray had a good feeling that Stacey would quickly go through with the racing. A 29-year-old waitress with few prospects is rarely willing to lose a relationship, he understood that well. A woman like Stacey would be a reluctant but a willing race pig, he was quite sure. 

Before her first race Ray would tell her that her participation in racing was simply her duty to him and that if she refused he would end the relationship immediately. Ray knew from experience that she would cry and demand an explanation. He would be very firm with her and he would tell her how much this meant to him.&nbsp; He would again tell her that this was something that he required of her and he knew she would consent. 

Of course she would have very little idea of what kind of ordeal lay in front of her.

�If the new pigs knew, they wouldn&#8217;t race,� It was a saying as old as pig racing itself and nobody broke the code of silence to the new pigs. 

The plan was simple. One night after she had moved in with Ray he would tell her that they were going to �the races.� She wouldn&#8217;t have any real understanding of pig racing until she was scampering along the racecourse with the other pigs.

The old timers loved nothing more than watching a new pig. The new pigs always cry horribly about the nudity and the whips, they always put on a great show. Of course they sometimes suffer horribly.

The pig races are held in an old barn far from Kansas City. The large red barn is divided into four parts:

The first part is the �receiving area.� This is where the pigs are dressed and prepared for the upcoming races. The pigs are stripped of their clothes and are forced to wear only a pink thong. They then have a black number painted across their backs so they can be easily identified during the running of the race. New pigs (called maidens) wear a black thong so they can&nbsp; also be identified by both gamblers and other onlookers.

The pigs hair are fittingly put into �pig tails� and when their race number is called they move into an area of the receiving barn set up for �race staging.� Here the men (typically between 50 and 100) evaluate each runner before placing their bets. The pigs are not allowed to speak to the men but the men typically rub each runner&#8217;s legs and rear ends looking for telltale signs of �race readiness.� The larger and firmer the ass, the better the runner (some of the old timers say).

The larger ass always pays off on the racetrack. An experienced pig can use her large ass to block runners moving up from behind her. A pig with a skinny ass can easily be passed and then forced into a wall which causes a critical loss of momentum. They men also use this time to discuss and review each pigs race history and make a full evaluation of the race. Since many of the pigs are woman who have raced many times before, the �maidens� always draw a lot of special attention. Ray understands that Stacey will receive a great deal of attention because of both his past history of delivering winning pigs and the fact that her body which is built just perfectly for the racing. 

Once all the runners have been evaluated and all the bets have been placed, the pigs move into �The Pig Pen.� This is actually a starting gate and a racecourse built primarily of old plywood. The pigs are lined up in the starting gate and they wait for the signal. When �the starter� raises a pink flag, a man standing directly behind each pig simultaneously slaps their pig&#8217;s ass with a large electric prod. The pigs then scamper out on their hands and knees onto the racecourse.

The racecourse is initially wide but quickly narrows to a choke point. At the first narrowing the pigs gather together and fight for entrance into the �pig runs.� It is a very violent beginning for the maidens because the experienced pigs fight aggressively. If a poor position is obtained here it is very difficult to avoid the punishment that comes later on.

The pig runs are typically wide enough for two pigs but at some points they widen out slightly more. The pigs race through the course while the men who have bet the races stand at each side. Each man holds a riding crop and is free to whip the pigs as they pass him. As a general rule the men only whip the pig on which they have placed a bet. The sharp sting of the crop typically propels the pig forward so the men do not generally strike pigs on which they have not wagered.

Sometimes the men do however whip the maidens even though they have not bet on them. They do this because the maidens rarely win anyway and also because it is fun to hear their surprised little squeals. The pigs race the entire seventy five yard length of the course twisting and turning as they proceed along the track. An experienced man can skillfully move from point to point on the course in order to whip his chosen pig multiple times during the race. 

The pigs battle for position and they sometimes play dirty. The older and more experienced pigs have been known to pull back on the runners leg in front of them in order to quickly scamper past them. There are few rules once the race is actually underway and the fear of the upcoming punishment sometimes propels the pigs to get quite nasty.

At the finish line a camera is used to determine the exact order of finish. Once the pigs move past the finish line they are lined up in the order of finish and moved to the final area of the barn.

This final area is called interchangeably&nbsp; both the winners circle and the punishment pit. The winning pig receives a red ribbon and is paid $25 dollars cash. The blue ribbon is only awarded at the end of the racing season and is given to the pig that has won the most races during that season. That pig alone is called �The Champion.� Once the winning pig has been properly celebrated and photographed, the losers are introduced in what is then called the punishment pit.

It was decided many years ago that the losers should be punished. It was originally done because the men who had lost money wanted to see punishment inflicted upon the pig that had failed their bet. But over the years the whippings came to serve a higher purpose; Knowing that a whipping will occur to the losers has made the sport much more competitive and much more fun for the men who have grown to love the sport. It is not only visually exciting for the men but it also makes the pigs try harder in subsequent races.

Each pig is brought out in the order of finish. The pig that finishes in second or third position typically receives only a very minor spanking from the handlers, but as the descending order of finish continues the spankings grow much more severe. Once the fifth place finisher has been properly punished the handlers use a short bull whip as a means of both punishing the pigs and of course encouraging&nbsp; improved performance. Almost all pigs who receive the bull whip cry uncontrollably. They are held securely (or bound if it is required) and they receive many strokes with the thick bull whip. This spectacle is one of the things that has made the sport of pig racing so popular over the years. Everyone except the pigs enjoys the whippings.

The final indignity is given only to the pig that finishes in the last position. Once this pig&#8217;s whipping has concluded, the owner of the winning pig is given the option of sodomize what is called the �worthless pig.� If the worthless pig is older or unattractive the owner may pick a delegate. While there are generally plenty of volunteers, most long time owners will pick younger boys or older men who typically have not had the opportunity to ass fuck a race pig. This poor pig is degraded horribly but most observers enjoy this part quite a bit.

When a maiden&#8217;s finish position qualifies it as the �worthless pig� it is a point of pride that the owner of the winning pig himself does the ass fucking. It is a proud tradition that pig owners break in another man&#8217;s new pig in this way. A small ceremony is held as the pig&#8217;s owner is called out and made to watch the more successful man sodomize his losing maiden. They call this �breaking the maiden.� This indignity has never been something Ray has been made to endure but he has seen it happen many times.

And so it was on an early summer evening only a few weeks after Stacey moved in with Ray that he asked her if she wanted to go with him to the races. Stacey who was now no longer working at the Rib Crib was&nbsp; finally on a level playing field with all her friends and she eagerly told him yes. She loved Ray very much and enjoyed spending her time with him. She was by now quite confident that she held a very special place in his heart and she was sure that this was just the beginning of the rest of their lives together.

As the two lovers drove out Interstate 70 Ray silently drove past the sign to the Kansas Speedway towards the countryside far beyond.

�Honey, I think you missed the off ramp� Stacey helpfully told Ray.

Ray reached over and patted the firm muscle on Stacey&#8217;s left leg. �Thanks sweetheart, but we are going to different racetrack tonight.�

As Ray continued to massage her left thigh Stacey looked out the window and smiled. �It&#8217;s so good to finally be in love� she thought silently to herself.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Miles away in the old barn the handlers had already began stripping and preparing the pigs for the evenings first races. Stacey was not scheduled until race #6. It was a race against prior winners and had an owner&#8217;s&nbsp; prize of $2,000 dollars. Almost all the prize money comes from internet sales of digital recordings of the races and whippings.

�I love you honey� Ray said to Stacey. 

Stacey smiled and watched the green countryside roll slowly past her.
