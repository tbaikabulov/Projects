Synopsis: A male submissive story with a slight twist.  Not really a surprise, but a twist.  It addresses the fantasy question.THE CALL  
I wish I could say that the car broke down, I wish I could say that it was
  a stormy night, and I had no choice, that I had to run up to the house for
  shelter&hellip;as stereotyped as it all may sound, but I can't say any of that.
  The car was running better than it had for months, and it was late in a summer
  afternoon, bright and clear. I just had to stop the car&hellip;.because of
  the call.  
I was on a road trip, an impulse drive. Dave was history, and I got restless.
  I wanted to be someplace I'd never been before. So an impromptu road trip,
  one that suddenly stopped. I can't say what it was, but I had to stop. I pulled
  over to the side of the highway, and followed the pull through a few small
  turns on country roads, pulling up next to a large open gate opening onto an
  immense yard fronting a house that seemed to live in the boundary between a
  mansion and a castle.  
&hellip;wait&hellip;.  
I blinked. I heard the voice, but not with my ears. I was alone in the car,
  the only people I could see were a cluster of landscapers in front of the mansion
  who were loading their trucks, done for the day. I reached for the pepper spray.  
&hellip;please wait&hellip;  
My hand froze. It was the tone, though with no voice, that was hard to explain,
  even to myself. There was a friendliness to it that I sensed I could trust,
  though I was sure that not everyone could. I watched, tense, as the landscapers
  finished loading their trucks. They came down the driveway, a pathetic caravan
  A few of them glanced at me as they drove through the gate, but only one stopped
  and approached me.  
"Are you okay, lady?" he asked.  
"Yes, quite fine, thank you." My tone was almost as distracted as I was feeling.
  I knew this man had nothing to do with the call, and I just didn't want to
  be bothered. He got back in his truck, to the laughter of the others, and soon
  I was alone again.  
I waited, knowing that waiting now was as important as stopping here had
  been earlier. I watched the sunset, shadows growing, and listened to the crickets
  and frogs start their chorus. I closed my eyes for a moment, wondering if I
  should try to nap, not knowing exactly how long I needed to wait.  
&hellip;the smell of sweat and leather, under that, the faint scent of blood,
  the harsh smack of wood on flesh, the lights low, him on hands and knees at
  my feet, the silky feel of his hair in my fist&hellip;.  
I sat upright, all thoughts of sleep gone. I was struggling to keep my breath,
  my pulse racing. The image was more vivid than any daydream I'd ever had, my
  fingers still felt the hair in my grip, the other hand could feel the handle
  of a paddle. Every time I blinked, the image came back to mind.  
A light came on in the mansion, and I started my car again. I pulled into
  the driveway and approached, stopping my car and knowing that I still had to
  wait. The shadows grew until the sun had fully sunk below the horizon.  
&hellip;come, please&hellip;  
I was shaking with the tension. I knew this was important, and I knew that
  my life would never be the same after tonight, no matter what happened. My
  only chance for my life to stay the same was to get back in the car and drive
  away, but I couldn't do that.  
I stepped up a series of elegant but shallow steps onto the porch&hellip;as
  I approached the door, it opened, and he was standing there, smiling slightly.
  My first thought was "Fabio's the butler?" but within a second, I realized
  that there were more differences than similarities. I thought that this was
  what Fabio would have wanted to look like. He was only wearing leather pants,
  so I could see that this man's muscles were lean and well toned. His skin was
  pale, his hair dark but long, pulled back in a ponytail that fell across his
  shoulder and reached just below his pectoral muscles as it spread across his
  chest. The jaw was narrower than Fabio's and his eyes were black. He had an
  assured air about him, but it wasn't the shallow posturing I was so used to
  seeing in other men. His smile broadened and it was a warm smile, showing more
  spirit than I was used to seeing from most men, too.  
I held out my hand. He gently took it and bowed over it, pressing his lips
  to the back of my hand without his eyes ever leaving my face.  
"My name's Lisa, and&hellip;uh&hellip;" I drifted off, not knowing how to
  explain why less than an hour ago I was driving by at seventy miles an hour.
  Or why I was here now.  
"A pleasure, Milady Lisa, my name is Andrew. Mistress is inside and waiting,
  if you please." His voice was a rolling musical tenor. He stepped back from
  the door and swept his arm in a gesture of welcome. I stepped inside. He closed
  the door, then walked around me. "If you would follow me, please." I did, and
  saw that my earlier assumption was right, he was wearing nothing but the leather
  pants&hellip;they were too tight and too low cut to be covering anything but
  him, and he wore no shoes. The view while I was following him was impressive
  enough that I have to admit I didn't see much of the house until we entered
  the room where Mistress waited.  
It was a beautiful drawing room, with elegant oak paneling and more furniture
  by item count than my whole house had. He indicated a seat for me, and before
  I could take it, he was at the feet of the older woman who waited in her chair.
  He sank to his knees, facing me. I assumed this was Mistress.  
She smiled down at him and reached forward, stroking the back of his head
  idly. He closed his eyes and leaned back into the touch, for a second.  
"Mistress, may I present Lisa?"  
"Andrew, why don't you get me some more tea, and see if she'd like anything.
  She must be parched after waiting out in the afternoon sun like that." She
  chuckled. "I assure you, Lisa, that we have a fully stocked bar, so whatever
  you want, you have a good chance of getting it here." Her smile was warm, and
  I returned her smile tentatively.  
"Actually, just iced tea sounds good to me right now." I smiled down at Andrew.  
"Yes, Milady. Do you take, sugar, lemon&hellip;?" He smiled back at me.  
"Two sugars and lemon, please."  
Andrew glanced up over his shoulder at Mistress, and rose at her nod he padded
  out of the room quietly, leaving us alone.  
Mistress was not just older, she was old. Her view of seventy was in her
  rear view mirror, and the walker beside her chair was testament to her years.
  Her hair was a solid gray and her skin hung loose on her thin frame. She wore
  a gentle blue pants suit that wouldn't have looked too out of place at a church
  function. Her angular jaw and high cheekbones could have been harsh features
  given how thin she was, but they were softened by the sparkling blue eyes and
  her ready smile. She wore a gold necklace that was almost high and tight enough
  to be a choker.  
"I'm sure you've got lots of questions, Lisa, so go ahead and start if you
  want." She chuckled again, this time breaking into a cough. "I'm sure that
  I don't know where to start with this."  
I opened my mouth to speak, but stopped.  
&hellip;Andrew on his knees, naked, his wrists tied behind his back, me pulling
  his head to my hips, his mouth to my heat&hellip;.  
I blinked hard.  
"Andrew, stop that!" she yelled, and laughed.  
"Yes, Mistress," his voice was faint, but held amusement.  
"Anyway, you were going to say?" Mistress turned back to me.  
"I&hellip;well, I was driving by, and I just felt&hellip;" I found myself
  reaching for the words. "compelled&hellip;."  
"Yes," she nodded. "Andrew's doing, it was. Kind of hard to explain, I don't
  really understand the mechanics, but he's been calling for someone for a while." Before
  she could continue, Andrew entered the room, pushing a tea cart. He served
  her, then picked up a tray and approached me, setting it down on a table beside
  me.  
My eyes fell on the vase in the center of the tray first, a shiny black rose
  in the crystal. There was a tall glass of iced tea next to it, a slightly squeezed
  lemon slice floating in it. A small bowl of strawberries rested opposite from
  the glass. Andrew stepped back, then returned to Mistress' feet.  
My eyes went back to the rose and I reached forward to touch a petal. Instead
  of the gentle texture of a flower, I felt something harder and smooth. I leaned
  forward, and sniffed. The smell of leather wafted up.  
The rose was a construct, made from leather and wire, but it was a perfect
  copy to the eye.  
I turned back to them, and she was stroking the back of Andrew's head again.
  He was reacting to it like a cat being stroked, and I could swear he was purring.
  I looked around the room again, momentarily feeling awkward in the face of
  their affection.  
"Nice house, Mistress." Andrew and Mistress both laughed.  
"Oh the house isn't mine, it's Andrew's." She patted his head again, and
  he smiled at me, a genuinely happy grin.  
"I'm sorry, I&hellip;"  
"Don't be, it's an easy assumption to make. Andrew, why don't you go and
  take care of business? Just be back as soon as you can."  
"Yes, Mistress." He rose and headed for the door, stopping long enough to
  bow to me before slipping out.  
"He'll be gone for an hour or two, we can talk freely." She sipped her tea
  and gestured for me to do the same. I tried it, and it was delicious. I didn't
  recognize the blend. The strawberries were perfect, too.  
"You said that it was Andrew calling me, how&hellip;?"  
She shrugged.  
"I don't know how he does it, exactly, but it was a specific call. For someone
  with the taste, who wasn't on pressing business, and who isn't currently involved
  with someone."  
"With the taste?" Before she could say anything, I felt it again.  
&hellip;the whip in my hand falling across his back, him writhing, the smell
  of blood faint in the room, his moans softly echoing&hellip;..  
She gestured at the fireplace and I glanced there, at the objects on a plaque
  over it, crossed like dueling swords on display. I froze, my heart pounding
  again.  
They were riding crops, the shafts wrapped in black leather, the flaps were
  brown and the handles worn from long use. Without thinking about it, I stood
  and approached the fireplace. Finally, I don't know how much later, I turned
  back to her. She had not left her seat, but had pulled her walker around in
  front of her. She smiled.  
"But I&hellip;I've never&hellip;" I trailed off.  
"You have, though, thought about it? Fantasized?" I nodded slowly, unable
  to speak. "The call was for you, or someone like you. Two others answered,
  the most recent a week ago. But they didn't follow through." She shrugged. "You
  can qualify for the call and the chemistry be wrong. And it is your decision,
  too. You may not want to, after all."  
"Want to what?"  
"Want to play with him, of course. At my age, I need this thing to walk, " she
  tapped the walker. "no way I'm safe to tie him down or whip him right." She
  chuckled again, prompting another wheezing cough. She sat up straight and looked
  at me appraisingly. "You have the taste." It was a statement, but it had the
  feel of a question, so I nodded. "Only one way to find out, Lisa? Do you want
  to find out with Andrew?"  
I nodded more slowly, feeling my breath catch again. Every nerve ending in
  my body was tingling.  
"I know he likes you, Lisa, and he's still calling to you isn't he?"  
"Now and then, Mistress."  
"Well, when he gets back, why don't you give it a try?"  
"I&hellip;I think I will."  
&hellip;the feel of straps around my hips holding something in place, something
  I'm guiding into Andrew's ass, the smell of a lubricant strong in the air,
  the coppery scent of blood fainter than before, Andrew moaning in passion and
  him pushing back onto the dildo that rests on my hips&hellip;  
"But what&hellip;what if it doesn't work out?"  
"It's a relationship, there's always a risk. If it doesn't work, it doesn't
  work. You'll have answered at least one question about yourself, and all you'll
  be out is one evening, and some energy."  
"Are you saying he's hoping for more than one night?"  
"If everything works out. Does that present a problem, Lisa?"  
"Not really. But I don't really know him. And even if the 'play' goes fine,
  who knows about anything else? A relationship for long term&hellip;"  
"That's about more than sex, yes. But the rest can grow, or if that doesn't
  work, then Andrew would settle for just the sex as a side dish for you. He
  wouldn't insist on an exclusive relationship if his didn't completely meet
  your needs."  
I stared at her.  
"Why are you doing this for him?"  
"I have my reasons. I owe him."  
"All right, why isn't he talking to me about this himself?"  
"He had something that he needed to do, he'll be back soon and he'll join
  in the conversation then." She looked at me levelly. "So, are you interested
  in what he's offering? What I'm relaying?"  
I swallowed. The verbal dancing and the bizarre messages aside, this was
  the moment I nodded slowly, amazed by how dry my throat was.  
"Do you want to nap for a bit, Lisa?"  
"I don't think I could sleep if I were drugged right now, Mistress."  
She chuckled as she pulled the walker in front of her. "Then perhaps you'd
  like to join me for dinner? Andrew made enough for both of us."  
I agreed and followed her to the kitchen. It took a while, and by the time
  we got there I had another question, but I waited until she had seated herself
  at a table near the window before I asked&hellip;there were two covered plates
  there, and steam was rising through the holes at the top of the covers. She
  uncovered one, and I could see a Cornish game hen with steamed asparagus lined
  up next to it, rice pilaf filling out a third of the plate.  
"So, why didn't he serve dinner?"  
"What he had to do was important&hellip;.he usually serves all my meals.
  That's the worst part of his service&hellip;occasionally he does have to attend
  business, but it's no more than twice a week." She looked like she was about
  to say more, then shook her head lightly and began to eat. I uncovered my plate
  and joined her. If Andrew had cooked it, he was a stellar chef.  
We ate in silence and after she'd finished, I took our plates and loaded
  the dishwasher. Mistress watched me, chuckling.  
"That may well be the last time you ever do a domestic chore, Lisa&hellip;Andrew
  is very good, and he does have a cleaning staff most of the week." She smiled.  
I returned to the chair and smiled back at her.  
"You said you don't understand it all, but you have to understand part of
  it&hellip;how does he do that&hellip;.with the calls?"  
She looked uncomfortable.  
"How open minded are you?"  
I stared at her for some time before I lost it, the laughter bubbling up
  out of control. Finally I got it under control.  
"I'm talking about things with you that I've never told anyone in my life,
  and I've only known you for an hour or so. I think that's pretty open minded,
  don't you?" I was still laughing.  
"You're missing the point. You've felt the call, and it's stranger than anything
  you've ever felt before. It's calling directly to your tastes. But that's the
  what&hellip;the why and the how are even stranger." Mistress sighed, looking
  down at the table top.  
&hellip;the whip in my right hand, a leash in my left, I lead him to a low
  stock, and secure him in place, then walk behind him, the lights low, the feel
  of the leather warm and smooth in both hands, the smell of leather, the smell
  of sweat, the smell of passion, the smell of blood&hellip;  
"What's going on?" Andrew was standing in the doorway to the kitchen, dressed
  as before, though he had a leather jacket draped over one an arm. He smiled
  at Mistress. He entered the room and knelt at her feet again.  
"She was asking how you called to her," Mistress explained, looking nervous.  
"I thought you two would have gone past that point by now," he sounded disappointed.
  I noticed him wiping delicately at the corner of his mouth, then he stuffed
  a carefully folded napkin into the jacket, which he set aside.  
"We didn't go too far into it, and we'd just gotten back to it," Mistress
  explained, "I expected you to take a bit longer, boy."  
"Things went well, Mistress." He smiled up at her. "So what did you two talk
  about, then?"  
"I confirmed that she has the taste, and she's expressed an interest in the
  two of you playing."  
Andrew smiled up at me, his open friendly smile again. Mistress turned to
  me, also.  
"So, any more questions, Lisa? I'm sure that Andrew would like to play, it's
  been far too long since he's been able to relax."  
In the face of their combined smiles, I was flustered for a moment.  
"I guess just the standard questions, past history, health concerns&hellip;" They
  laughed again, and I knew that I'd played into another private joke between
  them. This time I didn't feel like the butt of a joke, just someone who didn't
  have enough information to be in on it yet.  
"And I want to know how you called me&hellip;.how do you do that? What is
  it about you that's so special? There's something here I don't understand." He
  nodded, and I continued. "You're apparently offering me something long term
  here, nearly sight unseen" he nodded again chuckling. "You're offering and
  asking a lot without much warning."  
"That's true," he nodded. "I'm just asking for tonight first, anything else
  depends on your decision. After that&hellip;..you can walk if you want, but
  I hope you won't."  
Mistress reached over and stroked his head again. Once again he leaned into
  her touch, purring. I felt even more like an intruder in this smaller room.
  They noted my expression and Mistress spoke.  
"You're not intruding, Lisa. Like I said before, I'm no good to swing a whip
  any more. I'm not the Domme he needs anymore, I'm just too old. I have a lot
  of good years behind me" She looked wistful. He smiled up at her again, and
  they were obviously sharing some memory, but this time none of us could pretend
  I wasn't intruding to some extent. Though I had to wonder how much history
  they could be talking about since he looked to be younger than me.  
"If anything," she continued, " You're standing in for me while you'll be
  making your own place at the same time."  
I looked from one of them to the other and then realized that I'd been steered
  off track again.  
"Andrew, how did you call to me? What about you is so unique?" He frowned
  and looked up at Mistress&hellip;she shrugged slightly.  
"That's what I was trying to decide when you came in, boy. How much should
  we tell her now?"  
He looked back and me and considered. Then a short nod and he spoke.  
"You won't believe me, but I'll tell you." Mistress started to speak, but
  silenced when he shook his head. "She needs to know. She needs the truth to
  make her decision." Mistress nodded then. She bit her lip and looked at me
  nervously.  
"So what's this deep dark secret?" my throat was dry.  
"I'm a vampire." He flinched like he expected me to laugh, and he expected
  that to hurt. For a second, laughing seemed the right response, then for a
  few seconds, getting up and leaving without another word seemed the right thing
  to do. But there was the call&hellip;  
"And anyway," I thought, "as long as he isn't trying to take my blood, is
  there a problem with him thinking he's a vampire?" Besides, there was that
  call&hellip;  
"I see. So that business you needed to take care of&hellip;"  
"I needed to feed. I don't have to do it every night, but when I do, I don't
  waste any time."  
I nodded. "Do you kill when you feed?"  
"No." He shook his head, eyes down, and somehow I knew that meant that he
  didn't have to, but he had in the past.  
"So where do I fit in with all this?"  
He looked up at me, startled.  
"I would never feed on you if that's your worry." Mistress chuckled, and
  Andrew glanced at her, an expression I couldn't read at all.  
"Then where?" 
    
"You know how legends&hellip;well, movies anyway&hellip;.have stories about
  vampires having human servants?" I looked from Andrew, kneeling on the floor,
  to Mistress, smiling from her chair. I stood and stepped away from them.  
"So you're his servant?" My giggle was more than a little hysterical at the
  moment. Part of me couldn't believe this at all. But there was the call&hellip;  
"Only in that sense, Lisa." Mistress smiled, her voice soft again. "Voluntary
  sharing is an exchange of power. If the one giving power has more power, then
  they have more to give." And just because he's a vampire doesn't change the
  nature of the person he was before and still is. He wants to submit, but he
  has to be able to trust the ones he submits to fully."  
"So he's your servant," I asked, reaching out for the chair I'd stepped away
  from. Faster than my eyes could register, he was up, and had moved the chair
  behind me.  
"He's got the taste, too, he's a sub. He wants to serve, he needs to serve.
  But because of what he is, he has some extra power, and some extra vulnerabilities,
  too."  
Andrew smiled, then returned to Mistress' feet.  
"So, where do I fit in?"  
"I'm won't be around much longer," she chuckled. "And I want to make sure
  he's taken care of. Best way for that is for him to start playing with my replacement
  before I'm gone. Sounds mercenary, I know, but it isn't. We're talking about
  a relationship that could and should last you for the rest of your life, so
  it won't be casual, and it will be very emotional. Might as well start now,
  right?"  
"How long have you two been together?" it was rude to ask, but I had to know.  
"Fifty-three years," she smiled, looking down at him.  
"I&hellip;" I honestly couldn't figure out what to say. It was so odd, what
  she was saying, but it made such sense&hellip;and there was that call&hellip;  
"You need to understand," Andrew sighed. "This isn't a pleasant thing to
  think about, but it never is when someone you love is going to die on you.
  Saying goodbye is painful, and it takes time. But I've learned that you don't
  have to do what people usually do, shutting their hearts off from everyone
  else while you learn to cope with the loss. And Mistress thinks that this overlap
  will make things work better for everyone. I think she may be right."  
"I see."  
"I'll tell you what, Lisa, why don't you go to the room where I met you,
  we'll go downstairs through this door. You can join us after you've thought
  about it, or walk out the front door, no harm done." Mistress smiled again.  
Andrew stood and went to a door that opened onto a stairwell. I presumed
  their playroom was down there. I glanced at the doorway as Mistress stood and
  Andrew helped her walk to a seat that ran on a rail down into the basement.
  I heard the motor whine as it started and she began to descend. He followed
  behind her, and I walked to the top of the stairs before they were at the third
  step.  
"Let's not bother with a wait. We'll give it a try."  
The playroom was well lit, but the walls, floor and ceiling were all black,
  so the furniture all seemed to be floating in a field of darkness. Mistress
  walked slowly over to a chair and sank gently into it, Andrew at her side.
  I looked from item to item.  
There were stocks, for standing and kneeling, a few variations on stocks
  that seemed geared for various laying positions, a bastinado rack, a saint
  andrew's cross, two benches with straps indicating how a person was supposed
  to be secured to it, a chair designed to hold someone in bondage securely,
  and a bed of sorts, with straps lining the sides of it's frame. There were
  racks lined with whips, crops and floggers. Chests at various points promised
  to hold more items.  
"Milady Lisa, I'm at your disposal." Andrew kneeled quietly, and crossed
  his wrists in front of himself. At some point while I had been checking out
  the room, he had discarded the leather pants and was waiting naked in the light,
  his skin shining with a pinkish sheen, and the scent of blood hung in the air.
  I looked over at Mistress, and she was grinning.  
"Well, Lisa, now it's time for you to show him you mean business." I could
  see that she had missed this and she was looking forward to it, too. I relaxed
  when I saw this, and stepped over to a rack, picking up a flogger with thick
  suede strands.  
"Before we start, Andrew, do you have any limits?" I had read enough to know
  that I knew this was an important question, though in all honesty, I wasn't
  sure if his answers would make too much sense to me. He smiled.  
"You are acting on behalf of Mistress, and that means I have no limits, save
  those you choose to impose yourself." I glanced to Mistress, and she nodded,
  smiling.  
"Then present your back , slave." The look on his face was almost beatific
  as he leaned forward. He pressed his forehead to the ground and I swung the
  flogger with an easy stroke across his back.  
He shuddered, and I could see that Mistress was grinning widely. She gestured
  like she was swinging a whip herself, but gestured harshly. I swung again,
  harder. He moaned softly, but shifted position slightly to give me better access
  to his back. I swung again, and then began to settle into a rhythm. When I
  stopped, his back was crisscrossed with welts and his back was covered with
  a light red coating of blood. I looked up at Mistress, my pulse racing.  
"You're fine, Lisa, it's how he sweats."  
I turned back, staring at the blood on his back from no wound. "So," I thought, "he
  really is a vampire." And all doubt fled from my mind. I swung the flogger
  again.  
"You should be thanking me, slave." I smiled down at him, and set the flogger
  aside, then reached for a riding crop. I approached him again, and stopped
  with the tips of my shoes next to his face.  
"Thank you, Milady." His voice was muffled as he still had his face pressed
  to the floor.  
"Kiss my feet, slave, show me you appreciate what I'm doing for you." He
  turned his face to one side and kissed the side of my shoe, purring quietly&hellip;I
  watched the crimson sweat trickling down his back along his neck, and watched
  him kissing my shoes. "Lick them now, slave."  
He extended his tongue and began licking along the side of my shoe. I lifted
  my foot slightly and he began to lick the sole of my shoe. I had a strong and
  powerful man at my feet, doing what I wanted, and I found the thrill was running
  through me like an electric current.  
Oh yes, I had the taste, all right&hellip; this was my place, and I had no
  intention of leaving these two. I glanced up at Mistress, and she applauded
  lightly. I stepped back, and told Andrew to hold still. I approached Mistress
  and smiled.  
"How are you feeling, Lisa?" Her eyes sparkled. I leaned close to her before
  I whispered my answer  
"I'm so damned hot, I can hardly stand it."  
"Then take off your clothes." She laughed, her twinkling eyes challenging
  me.  
"That isn't what I meant and you know it."  
"Taking off your clothes helps with that, too&hellip;his tongue is heavenly."  
"Thanks." I started to take off my clothes, still standing where he couldn't
  see me. I approached, and he could see my bare feet as I approached. To his
  credit, though, he didn't move from position.  
"On your back, slave." He rolled onto his back, and looked up at me, smiling
  at my body as he looked at it from the floor.  
I put my feet on either side of his head, and slowly lowered myself until
  I was squatting just above his face. Then I settled down, pushing against his
  lips.  
"Now, slave, you know what to do." He nodded, and I could feel his tongue
  reaching up to explore me. I shuddered as he moved his tongue with skill I
  had only imagined before. I settled into place, surrendering to the pleasure.
  When I started to feel close, I twisted in place, and swatted with my riding
  crop at his cock. He moaned and licked faster. It was all I could do to swat
  again, this time aiming for his balls. I swung again, and shuddered, his tongue
  hitting me every right way.  
I felt my orgasm building, and found myself leaning forward, holding myself
  up with my arms, pressing myself down hard on his mouth. I came, and pulled
  up only reluctantly. I looked around the room, trying to decide what to use
  next, momentarily overwhelmed by the choices. I noticed Mistress sitting in
  her chair, smiling at me with a dreamy expression.  
"Any suggestions, Mistress?" I managed. My voice sounded husky to me, and
  my breath was ragged.  
"The kneeling stocks are a favorite of his," she chuckled. "And I think he's
  ready for a cane." I didn't understand what she meant at first, then noticed
  a small rack of bamboo canes next to the stocks she referred to. I stood and
  pointed to the stocks.  
He wordlessly crawled over to them, and rested his wrists and neck in the
  lower part of the openings, his knees on the floor. I closed the upper half
  of the stocks to him and noticed rings in the floor. I opened one of the chests
  and found a few leather cuffs. I put them on his ankles, and using leather
  thongs that were in the chest, I tied his ankles to the rings, leaving his
  legs outstretched slightly. I retrieved a cane, and smiled down at him. I held
  the cane forward, and he kissed its shaft.  
"Thank You, Lady Lisa." His voice was raw, now, and he was trembling, but
  his passion was clear. His face was contorted with it and his cock was showing
  me how excited he was.  
I stood beside him and swung the crop, the first blow landing across his
  back. He writhed against the bonds, but I could see he wasn't trying to get
  loose. I swung again, lower on his back. Then again across his ass. I found
  the rythmn for the crop, my arm rising and falling steadily, watching the lines
  the rose across his back, and faded quickly. The smell of blood from his sweat
  was stronger, and I had to stop now and then to make sure he wasn't bleeding.
  I stepped away eventually, and put the cane up. I walked back to the chest,
  and began rummaging, I found a small cluster of straps that puzzled me for
  a moment, then I unfolded them and could see that they were designed to fit
  around his cock and balls. I knelt beside him and fixed the straps in place,
  making it fit snugly, then tightening it further. His moan when I fastened
  the last strap was not unhappy.  
I freed his ankles from the rings, but linked them together with the straps
  that had held them in place. I retrieved matching wrist cuffs and put them
  on his arms before I freed him from the stocks.  
"Hands behind your back, slave." He crossed his wrists behind his back without
  a word. I glanced at Mistress, and she was watching intently, nodding her approval.  
I tied his wrists together. I reached around him and slid my hands over his
  cock in its leather prison. Already hard, I could feel it straining further,
  and I gently ran my fingertips along the sides, loving the soft moan that escaped
  him as I did.  
"I hope you're happy with things, slave," I whispered, "Because I think I'm
  going to stay." He trembled in place, and nodded. From where I was standing
  I couldn't see his face, but I could see Mistress'. I don't know if she had
  heard me or not, but she was positively beaming. I led him to the bed and told
  him to lie down. He did, and I rolled him onto his back. I climbed on top of
  him, and knelt across his hips.  
I rubbed against his encased cock, then bent forward. I kissed him lightly.
  I let my body rub against him. My lips grazed lightly against his and he moaned
  softly. I reached down and guided the head of his covered cock against me.
  I pushed and felt my body accepting him. I stopped when the head of his cock
  was inside and kissed him again.  
"You want more, slave?" He nodded. "You want me to fuck you, slave?" I pressed.  
"Oh, yes, Lady Lisa."  
I pushed down, forcing the full length of his cock into me, moaning myself
  now. I began to ride his cock, the pleasure building again quickly. I stopped
  and pulled off of him, and began to unfasten the straps. I went back to the
  chest and picked up a few clothespins. I came back and closed the pins on his
  nipples, listening to the music of his soft moans, and then I climbed back
  on him.  
"Are you going to cum for me, slave?" he nodded wordlessly. I pushed down
  hard and began to ride his cock, watching his face, and feeling his body. This
  was right, this was what I had been wanting all along, taking this man after
  using him. I felt close to cumming when I felt his hips bucking uncontrollably.
  I let him cum and I rode him, feeling him pouring into me. Then a thought made
  me shudder. If his sweat was mixed with blood, then his cum&hellip;.  
Then the automatic solution occurred to me and I smiled as I slowly crawled
  up off of his cock, and squatted over his face again.  
"Clean me out, slave, and make me cum again."  
His voice was muffled as he answered me, but the enthusiasm of his tongue
  showed me just how happy he was with the order, and it was only a few seconds
  before I was cumming again, so hard I could barely stay upright.  
I crawled off of his face after, and smiled down at him. I bent down and
  kissed his lips lightly, and began to unfasten him. He stood when I freed him.
  It was then that I saw the first hesitation in him, he stepped between us,
  at a loss for what to do. I finally realized what was puzzling him, and gestured
  with me head for him to go to her. He smiled a quiet thanks and went to her
  side, kneeling at her feet in his usual position.  
"Well, Lisa, I think you're going to do very well," she chuckled. "For a
  novice, you've got good form." Andrew chuckled.  
"Thank you," I smiled and sat back on the bed, dazed.  
"Any questions, Lisa?"  
"A few&hellip;and more will come, I'm sure."  
"Well let's start with what you have now."  
"Am I going to move in here?"  
"You don't have to, but it would be easier."  
I nodded.  
 
"So when should I start?"   
Andrew answered, "How quickly can you pack?"  
"Do you have any obligations you need to take care of? Family, job&hellip;?"  
"Well I have my family, but I can call them and visit now and then, that's
  no big deal. The job&hellip;" I shrugged.  
"Very well, then, tomorrow, you can start getting things ready if you want.
  We do want you to visit as much as you care to during the transition, you realize."  
I smiled. "I was hoping you'd say that."  
#  
That was the night that started my apprenticeship to Mistress. I found that
  there were many other common interests with both of them. Mistress became one
  of the dearest friends I'd ever had in the two years we had together before
  she finally died peacefully.  
And Andrew calls me Mistress now.
