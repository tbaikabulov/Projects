Version 13

&nbsp;

By

The Gray_Man

&nbsp;

Caution! The
following is a work of pure fiction I have been thinking about writing for some
time.� If there are any similarities
between the names, characters, places and actions of this story and those of
the 'real' world then it is 100% coincidence.�
There is a great deal of violence, and other sensitive subject matters
here.� If you are under 18 years of age
or this material is considered illegal where you live then do not read any
further.� It is not my intention to get
anyone in trouble, just to write out and express my free speech rights while I
still have them.

&nbsp;

Synopsis:��� Jack Dullman had always had problems.� His girlfriends leave him.� His pets run off.� He is balding, fat, and in a go nowhere job
with a pitiful salary and bleak prospects for anything positive.� But one day in the not-too-distant future his
luck changes, because Jack Dullman is the winner of a free virtual fantasy,
courtesy of Future_Line Virtual Industries INC.�


����� But just when things appear to be turning
around for him, Jack finds himself stuck in a perverse computer generated world
of his own choosing where the lines between pain and pleasure are blurred, and
his only escape back to the real world is death.� 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

������ �Hello.�

������ Jack�s eyes flew open.� He had been given countless instructions as
to what to expect but nothing prepared him for the sharp �reality� of what
happened.� One moment he had been swimming
in a vast sea of warm white light letting the pulsing waves of energy flow over
his flesh and then, without any warning, he was sitting in the middle of an
ornate office decorated in warm wood tones with bookshelves and art and a
magnificent view of a city skyline from floor-to-ceiling windows that covered
half the room.� That, in itself, would
have been disconcerting to most but being in this classically beautiful office
naked as the day he was born was ridiculous.

������ �Woa...what the fuck!� He screamed. �Is
this how this shit starts?�

������ The person on the other side of the
desk, sitting across from him in a plush leather chair, gave him the briefest
of smiles.

������ �I�m sorry.� I do not understand the query.�

������ Jack looked down at all his parts
hanging out and winced.� He saw himself
getting into the shower every morning and getting dressed and undressed.� He should not have been so shocked at the
sight of his own gut, man boobs, hairy chest and tiny pecker lying out
there.� But sitting down was
different.� All the parts were pushed up
together to make his stomach that much more pronounced, his chest saggy and his
dick appear even smaller than it usually did.�
Damn, but he had let himself go.�
Too many late night pizzas.�
Hastily, one hand moved to cover his flaccid member and he crossed his
legs as he looked around nervously.

������ In stark contrast was the man at the
desk.� His graying hair was short and
well maintained.� His shoulders were
broad and his torso appeared solid but fit beneath the navy blue fabric of his
custom suit.� His face was strong featured
and lean but well tanned and the hair of his goatee was thick but expertly
trimmed.� He gave off a powerful, almost
menacing presence that set Jack even more off balance that what he already was.

����� �Is there a problem?� The man asked
calmly.

����� �No.�
Everything is fine other than me being in the skinny over here.�

����� �Skinny?� The man repeated in a quizzical
tone. �I do not understand.� Please
re-state.�

����� �Re-what.�

����� �I do not understand.� Please re-state.� He said again in clear,
precise English devoid of accent.� In
fact, Jack realized, he had asked the same question twice, in the exact same
tone, in the exact same manner.

����� �Who the hell are you?� Jack demanded
warily.

����� The man across the desk nodded.� He rose from his chair and offered a hand to
Jack.

����� �Of course, introductions are in
order.� I am Lothor, an avatar.� I am your direct interface with �the Core�
for the duration of your virtual fantasy.�

����� �What�s up.� I�m naked.� Jack ignored the hand and glanced
around the room scratching his bald head. �Hey, Luther.� You wouldn�t happen to have some cloths
laying around anywhere, would you?�

����� Lothor looked back with a blank stare for
a few seconds, his hand still extended.�
It was almost like he was listening to something far away.� And then he came to.� �My apologies�there must have been a slight
skip in a subroutine in one of �the Core�s� periphery systems.� Most unusual but easily corrected.�� And he snapped his fingers. 

����� For an instant there seemed to be a subtle
shift in everything.� The world lost
focus for a mere second and came back just a little clearer.

����� And now he was wearing cloths.� Jack jerked with a start.� Tentatively he moved his hands over the
fabric of the pale gray shirt and black slacks.�
He looked to his feet and....yep...he had shoes too.� A comfortable pair of black loafers had
miraculously appeared down there.� And it
all felt real.� Almost immediately his
mind tried to wrap around the fact that he was not sitting in a corner office
of a high-rise.� He was actually in a
controlled coma, lying face down in a cold, dark room on a modified massage
table with a trio of data-stream cables plugged into the back of his head while
Future_Line technicians he could still remember speaking with quietly monitored
every vital sign he had; from respiration and heart rate to each fart that
passed his ass cheeks.

����� The techs and warned him about this.� It was easy to forget that this was not as
real as it seemed.� But even if it was
not real it could still hurt you.� The
techs had patiently tried to explain this to him even though he still barely
understood.� What it boiled down to was
that all of the five senses, when broken into their base forms, were streams of
electrical pulses interpreted by the brain.�
The data link Jack now had with �the Core� was capable of overpowering
or even suppressing his natural electrical pulses and transplanting different
ones directly into his cerebral cortex which coincided with whatever stimulus
the program was offering.� So, in other
words, the cloth felt real, the room appeared well lit, the air seemed fresh
because �the Core� was telling him it was.

����� �Nice cloths, Luther.� But you have got to tell me next time you try
that shit.� You almost gave me a heart
attack.�

����� The avatar hesitated, but then nodded. �Understood.� You will now be notified of all further
attempts to alter or manipulate the current user package.�� 

����� �Yeah, great.� Thanks.�

����� �You are welcome.� He almost sounded
defeated when he spoke.

����� Again he leaned over the desk and offered
his hand. �I am Lothor, an avatar.� I am
your direct interface with �the Core� for the duration of your virtual
fantasy.�

����� Jack stood and grabbed Lothor�s hand
tentatively.� �I�m Jack Dullman.�

����� Lothor seemed to ignore him. �I suppose
congratulations are in order. You are the winner of the Future_Line Virtual
Fantasy Giveaway.� 

������ Jack was not the best of judges when it
came to character but even he could tell the avatar�s congratulations were less
than sincere.

����� �Oh, really?� You already know about that?�

����� �Of course.� I have access to all personal and preference
information at �the Core�s� disposal.�

����� Jack�s eyebrows rose.� �That was fast.�� 

������ �As an interface with all client users,
it is one of my primary functions.� The
download was accomplished while you awaited the current Main Start-gate program
to load.�

������ He remembered the nearly four hundred
question psych test, all the papers, disclaimers, and release forms he had been
forced to sign and the various medical probes that he had been subjected
to.� All of it loaded in a few
seconds.� He wondered why it couldn�t
have been that quick for him.

������ Jack looked over both shoulders before
pulling the avatar close enough to whisper in his ear. Even as he did it he
realized the absurdity of the gesture in a computer simulation.� 

������ �Hey, Luther.� You said all my preference information was
downloaded too, right?�

������ �Yes.�
Your preference information was downloaded as well.� The avatar replied
matter-of-factly.

������ �So...uh...you know exactly what I want
for my fantasy?�

������ Lothor nodded.� �All of the data requirements to place you in
the proper program have been met.�

������ �Well, good.� I...�

������ Lothor cut him off quickly.� �However, any further discussion concerning
the parameters of your choice program should wait until you can be supported by
your Personal Program Assistant.�� The
avatar smiled.� It was a cold,
machine-like gesture with no warmth at all.�
Jack almost shivered.� �You shall
meet him shortly...but first we must deal with a few matters of legality.�

������ Lothor snapped his fingers again and
Jack saw movement in the corner of his eye.�
A large set of shelves, covered with various bottles of fine liquor
retreated from the center of the wall behind the wet bar he hadn�t even known
was there.� Suppose it fit in,
though.� In its place emerged a massive
TV screen which promptly came to life.�  

������ �Hey.�
I thought you were going to tell me before you did anything like that?�

������ �The recessed video monitor was already
a facet of the Main Start-gate program.� Lothor replied.� �I am required to only notify you if I
attempt to alter or manipulate some aspect of your user package.�

������ �Oh...okay.�

������ A white background with fine type began
to scroll across its surface and he began to speak with all the excitement of a
telemarketer on valium.

������ �Future_line Virtual Industries
Incorporated has an excellent record with its clients.� In the history of the company there have been
no reported accidents or injuries associated with the Virtual World Interaction
System II.� This is due to the fact our
company places a high priority on safety.�

������ �Oh yeah?� Jack interjected. �What �bout
that guy I heard of out in California back when the company was just getting
started?� They say he got his brain fried
crispy and when they tried to pull him off of the system he went into
convulsions and died before they could get him to a hospital.�

������ �I am positive that despite whatever
rumor you may have heard there have been no reported injuries or deaths with
the use of this system.� Lothor responded.

������ Jack accepted that...for the most
part.� He had heard it from his cousin
Benny up in Jersey.� Benny was a moron.

������ �Okay.�

������ Lothor went on. �Considering the
importance of our customer�s safety we have instituted a dormant emergency
failsafe which may be activated at any time by the user.�

������ �User?�

������ �Yes.�
User. That would be you.� If at
any time during your fantasy you feel endangered or threatened or if you wish
to simply end the program you have only to repeat your secret safe word three
times in a row and an automatic escape route back to the Main Start-gate
program will be enabled.� You can await
upload from here.�

������ �Upload?�
Oh, you mean back to the real world?�

������ �Yes.�
Your safe word was created, and is only known, by you.� Do you remember it?�

������ �Yeah.�
I got it.� What if I don�t want to
go back to the real world?�

������ �I am sorry.� Your time in the choice program is limited
even with the Mark V compression filters Future_Line currently uses.� Your session is eight hours long.� You have a minimum program run time of twenty
four hours and a maximum run time of twenty six hours, after which you will
automatically be removed from the choice program and returned to the program
start-gate for upload.�

������ �Sounds great.� Jack said, even if most
of it had gone clear over his head. �When do we start?�

������ Lothor ignored the question.� More writing rolled down across the viewer
and the avatar continued.� �There is a
privacy disclaimer.� All customers of
Future_Line Virtual Industries Incorporated are under the protection of the
Virtual Privacy Act which entails that at no time can any aspect of your
fantasy or your actions while in your fantasy be reproduced, copied, sold, or
in general, used for or against you for any reason unless it is by your
consent.� As avatar of �the Core�, I and
your Personal Program Assistant both fall under the purview of this act.� We are sworn to uphold your personal privacy
no matter what your actions are.�

������ �Gotcha.�
Can we get started now?� Jack said.�
He had started to come to grips with his surroundings and the initial
shock of this �virtual world� had worn off.�
Now he was getting excited.� If
the program he went into appeared as �real� as his current surroundings, and
there was no reason to think it would not be, then he was going to have some
fun.� This was a once in a lifetime
license to do whatever he wanted.� These
Future_line fantasy getaways were thousands of dollars a session.� There was no way he would ever be able to
come back and try this again.� And he had
wasted enough time listening to a long-winded simulated person informing him of
his right to bail out and go home.� 

������ He expected Lothor to say no, not yet,
and start into another bylaw or legal issue.�
But instead the avatar let go of a very human sounding sigh of
exacerbation.� He snapped his fingers and
the viewer went dead, retreating back into the wall to be replaced by the
stocked bar shelves.� He took hold of
Jack�s arm and guided him to the office door, talking as they walked across the
thick carpet.

������ �You have finished the orientation of
the Main Start-gate program.� Any future
inquiries concerning legal or other issues must be directed to your Personal
Program Assistant.�� 

������ They stopped at the door. �To access the
next level of your virtual fantasy you must enter through here.� Good luck, and from all the employees of
Future_Line Virtual Industries Incorporated, we hope you enjoy your fantasy.
Good day to you.�

����� This was it.� The moment he had been waiting for.� Jack went to take the door handle.
&quot;Yeah, Luther. Thanks p-&quot;

����� There was a blinding flash of light that
was gone almost as soon as it hit.� Jack
raised his arms up to shield his eyes instinctively.� He blinked several times to disperse the
brilliant white spots and his eyes slowly refocused.� 

����� &quot;Sorry about that.&quot;

����� Jack nearly jumped out of his skin.
&quot;What the fuck are you doing?&quot; He yelled as all his frustrations came
out. &quot;First it's poke her and prod there!�
Then it's swoosh here and a big flash, then swoosh there!� Snap at this and snap at that!� This is seriously fucked up, Luther!&quot;

����� &quot;I must sincerely apologize, my
lord.&quot;

����� &quot;Well this is getting
ridiculous.� You can take your apology
and st...Holy shit!&quot;

����� Jack's eyes had adjusted and he realized
he was no longer in the office.� In fact,
he seemed pretty far from it.� He was
standing in the middle of a cavernous, ancient style, high roofed room with
gray stone walls.� Evenly spaced around
the perimeter, on both the lower floor and the second floor gallery, were
fantastic suites of armor covered with cloth banners of all different colors
and beautifully adorned with their own individual sigils.� In the center of the floor was a large table
covered in maps, scrolls and books.�
&quot;Badass!� Complete
badass!&quot; He muttered.

����� &quot;I am glad you appreciate it, my
lord.&quot;

����� Jack was so stunned by his change in
surroundings that he had forgotten all about the voice he had heard.� It wasn't long before it hit him this was not
Lothor.� There was a slight accent to
this one and the tone was not nearly as deep.�
He turned on his heels and came face to face with a small, almost
delicate man with short blond hair and full beard.� The man wore a suit of chain mail armor
covered at the shoulders and chest by plates of gray steel.� On his hip was a long, straight sword and
under his arm was a steel war helmet with thin grooves for eye slits.

����� His free arm went out to his side in a
sweeping motion and he bowed with all the grace of someone who had been born to
it. &quot;My lord, allow me to name myself.�
I am Axel, your Personal Program Assistant.&quot;

����� Jack stared at him for a minute. &quot;Axel...Axel?&quot;

����� But the assistant smiled.� It seemed a truly friendly expression.
&quot;A name is but a name, my lord.� I
care for it not.� You may call me what
you wish.&quot;

����� Jack waved it off and embarrassment
flushed through him for being so rude.�
Then he realized he had been rude to a computer program.� All the same, manners were still manners.

������� &quot;No...no.� Axel is fine.�
It�s just a little unusual, that�s� all.�
I�m Jack Dullman.�

����� Axel nodded curtly. �It is an honor to
meet you, my lord.�� Welcome to the
Medieval World Program Start-gate.�

����� He took another look around the vast
expanse of the room.� �So this is
it?� This is my fantasy?� Where is everybody?�

����� The blonde man smiled. �Not precisely, my
lord.� It is usually the custom of all
new users to review their personal preferences before continuing to the actual
choice program.�

����� �Well, okay, if you say so.� Lothor said all my information was already
downloaded.�

����� �Yes, my lord.� I already have access to it.� You requested Medieval World, Version 12.� Is that the correct choice?�

����� �Yeah.�
I think it is.� I�m not exactly
sure what all that means.� Jack said.� He
remembered choosing exactly what he wanted from the list of possible
fantasies.� He thought those were the
right picks.

����� �Might I give you a brief overview?� Axel
asked.

����� �Well why not.� I�ve waited this long.� Jack said as calmly
as he could even though he was getting slightly perturbed.� It seemed he was doing nothing but wasting
time with avatars and personal assistants when what he really wanted to do was
go find a chambermaid or some willing tavern wench so he could have his way
with her.� But he tried to remember the
old saying about all good things going to those who waited. �Whatcha got for me?�

����� Axel walked over to the table and Jack
followed.� He effortlessly took up a
large book bound in leather and opened it, flipping the massive tome to show an
illustrated diagram. �As you can see, the choice programs are divided into
different worlds.� Medieval World,
Western World, Ancient World....they are but a few samples of the available
selection.�� Axel�s thin finger traced
the outline as he spoke. �You have chosen Medieval World...see here?� Each World program has several different
versions.� Medieval World has 12
different versions.� You have chosen
Version 12.� It is a most unusual program
as it deals more with the sexual fantasy aspect of the era more so than the
simulation or the adventure versions�

����� �Yeah.�
That�s me.� The unusual one.� I�m probably the only one who will ever use it.�

����� Axel shook his head. �On a contrary, my
lord.� There are actually six other users
currently in the same version.�

����� Jack was shocked. �There are other
people....real people in this version of my program?�

����� Axel nodded. �Yes, my lord.� But do not worry.� The size of the program is so large the odds
of you meeting and interacting with another user are infinitesimal.� Then he
turned the page of the book he was holding.�
The title of the page was �Lord Jack Dullman� with a rounded shield of
aquamarine blue above it.� In the center
of the blue field was a golden eagle with outspread wings.� 

����� �Hey!�
Is that mine?� My banner?� Jack
asked excitedly.

����� �It is, my lord.� Exactly to your specifications, is it not?�

������ Blue and gold were his favorite colors.� The eagle was his favorite animal.� He had thought so many of the questions he
had been asked were incidental and their answers would never be used.� He was beginning to realize he was wrong
about a lot of things in this virtual world.

������ �You are Lord Jack, master of the castle
and village of Hargate, in the Duchy of Loranth.� You will find that you have your own retinue
and court created specifically to cater to your every need.�

������ Axel turned another page, this time
opening up to a map.� The land had a
jagged coastline and dense forests in the interior bordered on the north side
by a mountain range and to the east by a wide plain.� In the center of the western forest was a
tiny dot with the name Hargate scrawled above it.� A slender finger pointed it out.

����� �This is where you will be, my lord.� 

����� �Do I have my own women?� He blurted out.
�Oooops.� Sorry, Axel.� I got carried away.�

����� �I am sure you will find all the
provisions you desire within Version 12.�
It caters to all different aspects of human sexuality.� Whatever they may be.� And if you do not, then you have only to call
me and ask.�

����� �You�re gonna be there to help?�

����� �Yes, my lord.� I am, after all, your Personal Program
Assistant.� I can advise, re-arrange or
alter any feature within the program, excluding actually reconfiguring the
program itself.� I am sorry to say that
is the purview of the �Core� and its avatar.�

����� �Okay.�
Well, can we get going now?� I�m
getting an itch I have had for a long time here.� Can I go get it scratched?�

����� Axel smiled warmly.� It was very human-like. 

����� �By your leave, my lord.� You have only to call if you need me.� Do you have any questions or comments at this
point?�

����� Jack shrugged. �I guess not.�

����� �Do you wish to alter any aspect of your
user package at this time?� Axel asked.

����� �Well...no.� Jack answered, slightly
confused.� He wouldn�t know what to
alter.� �I�m okay as is.� I can�t think of anything to change.� 

����� Even so, Axel hesitated.� �Very well.�
Enjoy yourself.� He closed the book and put it down.� His hand came up with thumb and middle finger
touching.� He was ready to snap when Jack
stopped him. �Wait! Wait...wait...wait.�

����� �Yes, my lord?�

����� �I did want to say something.� He offered
warmly. �Enough of this �my lord� stuff.�
If we are going to be working together you can call me Jack.� And just for the record, for a person made by
a computer, you�re a damn nice guy.� One
hell of a lot nicer than Luther.� Maybe
you should get promoted to avatar or something.�

����� Axel bowed slightly to the statement.
�Why, thank you, m....Jack.�� Then he
laughed. �And you are a damned nice person too....for a human.�

����� Jack smiled broadly. �I appreciate that.�

������ �You�re welcome.� Now, are you ready to begin your fantasy?�

����� Jack had learned his lesson.� He tilted his head back and shut his eyes to
the blinding flash he knew was probably coming.�
He set himself, widening his stance and girding his midsection, like a
man expecting to be punched in the gut.

����� Two deep breaths and exhale.� �Okay, Axel.�
Zap me!�

����� He heard the snap of the fingers and felt
a sudden shift. 

����� And then nothing.

����� At first, he thought something had gone
wrong then Jack opened his eyes and the sun nearly blinded him.� He could feel the warmth of the rays against
his skin and a fresh breeze slapped him in the face.� He gazed down to see his new cloths; knee
high boots and breeches, a white linen shirt and black vest.� All fit perfectly and far more comfortably
than his cloths in the real world.� After
a quick inspection of his surroundings he discovered he was standing on a
balcony in a stone tower.� Not far below
was a curtain wall where armored sentries with spears and bows walked along the
battlements.�� The slate roofs of
countless buildings were packed below into the confines of the great wall.� Beyond the main gate where chimneys belched
soot filled smoke he could track tiny people moving about, some walking, some
with horses or mules and even some with ox carts.� Beyond the village was a vast emerald green
sea of dense forest and cutting through it was a single road.

����� �HELL YEAH!! FUCKING SWEEET!� He screamed
at the top of his lungs, not caring if any of the computer simulations within
earshot of his booming cry heard it. �THIS IS FUCKING SICK!!!�� He cupped both hands to his mouth to amplify
his voice.�
�WooooooooooooooHoooooooooooooooooooooooo!!�

����� Jack shuddered as an earsplitting crack
sounded off around his head. �Hey, what the fuck was that?� He uttered as he
tried to cover his ears in a belated attempt to protect them.

����� �WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS?� 

����� Jack spun around and was faced with the
woman of his dreams.� She appeared to be
in her mid to late twenties even though Jack had a horrible time with
ages.� She had a lovely face framed by
long, thick tresses of black hair which hung down loosely to the top of her
ample breasts.� She wore a flowing gown
of crimson and black with a near bursting bodice scrolled with silver
thread.� Even under the heavy hems of her
skirts, Jack realized she must have had an amazing body.

����� And she had a bullwhip in her hands, idly
flicking the tail of the whip back and forth like a cat about to get a bowl of
cream as she leaned against the entrance to the dark tower interior.

����� �I asked you a question, my lord.� What is the meaning of this?�� Her voice was smoky and strong.� The authority in her tone left no doubt as to
a challenge.� Jack�s knees nearly
buckled.� This was not what he had been
expecting but if this is what he got....then so be it.� Who was he to argue with is very own Fantasy
program. 

����� �You are one hot assed computer person,
sweetie.� Jack told her as he placed his hands behind his head in
supplication.� �Come and take me,
mistress.� I've been a baaaaaad boy.�

����� �Then my lord had best prepare for his
punishment.�� She walked forward slowly,
like a panther stalking its dinner. 

����� �Oh yeah, devil woman.� Hurt me.�

����� 

����� Jack had always thought himself to be a
dominant.� Jack could never remember
actually having submissive fantasies.� He
had never really thought about submitting to bondage and discipline
before.� So he really didn�t know why he
went along with the lady in crimson and black.�
Perhaps because this was his fantasy and to try something once when no
one else would ever know....well what was the harm in that?� Or perhaps because he had always been the
type of person to go along with the flow and when the dark haired beauty had
blindfolded him, wrapped the bullwhip around his neck and began to lead him
down into the bowels of the castle he had simply followed the way of things,
assured that at some point he would be able to turn the tables on her.

����� Turning the tables no longer seemed like
an option with his wrists chained above his head and his legs spread wide on
the cold stone floor, ankles chained to opposite walls in the small
chamber.� But at least he had gotten his
own set of mistresses.� Once the lady in
crimson and black had gotten him down to the dungeon she had watched him strip
naked, took him into one of the smaller cells and chained him, but then, to his
surprise, she had left him to the tender mercies of two lovely blonde women who
had appeared out of nowhere.

����� For what seemed like forever one of the
dungeon helpers, clad only in boots, loincloth, halter and heavy gloves, slowly
paced around him, a short leather cat-o-nine tails in her hands, swishing out
to thwack him somewhere on his exposed flesh every so often, while the other
knelt down in front of him and used her tongue to expertly stroke his cock
while her hands gently massaged his ball sack.�
He was rock hard and the waves of near orgasmic pleasure she was giving
him was in stark contrast of the stinging kiss of the whip and the growing
frustration from being held on the verge of ultimate pleasure without getting
to release.

����� �If I don�t cum soon, I�m gonna go
insane.� He muttered between gasps.� 

����� �Oh, really?� The blond with the whip
answered mockingly. �The mistress gave express orders that you were not allowed
to let go your seed.� If the pleasure is
driving you mad then perhaps we should turn up the pain to take your mind off
of it.�

����� The blond threw the whip down and roughly
tightened the screws on the iron nipple clamps she had placed on him some time
ago.� He yelled as a wave of fresh pain
washed over every nerve in his body.

����� The blond drew away and went over to the
wall where various other whips and paddles hung from metal hooks leaving the
weighted nipple clamps bobbing up and down in her wake.� She paused briefly and even if Jack was
distracted by the mind blowing mixture of pleasure and pain he was receiving he
still tried to focus and pay attention to what she was doing.

����� The blond reached over and picked up a
paddle.� She studied it for a moment then
brought it over to him.� Jack�s eyes
widened as he took in the monstrous device.�
The paddle was nearly two feet long and six inches wide.� Its smooth surface was marred by countless
rows of iron studs bored into the wood.

����� The blond saw his expression and laughed
cruelly. �Should this be sufficient to take your mind off of my companion�s efforts?�

����� �That thing looks like it might hurt.�

����� The blonde smiled wickedly. �I assure you,
my lord, it certainly will.�

����� �No, please.� Jack was not sure how much
of it was act and how much of it was real anymore.

����� The blond walked about him, slapping the
paddle lightly into her gloved palm.�
Jack followed her with his eyes as growing trepidation filled him.� That paddle was a monster.� It was really going to burn.

����� Finally she ducked under one of his
outstretched arms and was on his back side where he could no longer watch
her.� A moment of panic filled him.� There was no way of knowing what she was
doing back there and his mind filled with a helplessness that he had never felt
before.� 

����� �Hey, lady....please be careful with....�

����� THWAAACK!

����� Jack�s breath exploded from his lungs in
an ear splitting scream as searing hot pain spread across his ass.

����� �THAT FUCKING HURT!!!� He bellowed as the
pain slowly began to recede.�� A hand
grabbed what little hair he had left and yanked his head backward.� Jack could feel the blonde�s hot breath on
the side of his face and her whisper sounded like thunder. �Still too much
pleasure?�

����� Somebody had definitely turned this up a
notch.

����� �No!� Jack answered hoarsely.� �Please.�
Don�t hit me like that again.�

����� But the blond gave his head a hard jerk.
�What was that, worm?� Did you say
something?�

����� Jack answered louder this time. �Please
don�t.� Don�t hit me like that again.�

����� �Oh?�
Don�t like it?� Care to beg
now?�� She took the massive paddle and
rubbed it up and down his back, the sharp iron studs scraping along his skin
like nails.

����� �No!�
Please put it away.�

����� Anger filled her voice. �You shall not
tell me what to do, worm.�� She let go of
his hair and backed away.

����� �Wait, lady! No, stop....oh shit!�

����� THWAAACK!

����� Jack screamed again as fresh agony infused
his already sore ass.� He slumped in his
chains briefly but all of his considerable weight was then being supported by
his wrists and he was forced to stand on his feet again.� 

����� �I see your game, worm.� The blond
said.� She walked over to one side of the
room and Jack noticed a small wheel set into the wall.� The woman began to turn the wheel, her
tattooed arms straining with the effort.�
Jack heard the clanking of chains and felt himself being pulled up by
the wrists.� After only a few turns Jack
was forced up on the balls of his feet placing extra strain on his arms
shoulders and calves. �Now you have nowhere to go.� No room to relax.�

����� Jack hung his head and shut his eyes.� The pain was nearly unbearable.� Years of ideas and fantasies floating around
in his head were being called into question and he was beginning to wonder if
he had chosen wisely.� This was wrong.� This was all wrong.

����� THWAAACK!

����� A new sheet of pain spread across the back
of his left thigh.� 

����� THWAAACK!

����� Same pain, this time across his right
thigh.

����� Every muscle in his body tensed and he
screamed like a banshee as the bite of the iron studs pierced the flesh and his
legs trembled with the effort to keep him up as his hamstrings were turned to
jelly by the blows.

����� THWAAACK!

������ THWAAACK!

������ THWAAACK!

������ Several more blows fell on his ass and
back and thighs and several more screams resounded off the stone walls.� Each hit brought another harder and faster
than before and Jack could feel blood trickling down his legs to pool at his
aching toes.� Jack could no longer judge
time as he once could.� The beating with
the paddle, and the never ending blowjob seemed to go on forever.

����� �I trust my assistants have kept you
interested?�

����� With pain filled eyes Jack looked up to
see the woman in black standing in the doorway to the chamber.� His eyes widened and he had to admit that
even through the suffering he was aroused by her outfit.� She wore only a black loincloth and black linen
wrap to cover her ample breasts with knee high boots turned down at the
cuff.� Her body was just as magnificent
as he had imagined it when he first laid eyes on her.� 

����� �Please, mistress.� Jack muttered half
delirious with pain.� �No more,
please.� I can�t take it.�

����� The lady in black smiled.

����� �Oh, poor Lord Jack.� Can�t take anymore, eh?� Well I should guess you could use a bit of a
rest.�

����� Relief began to flood over him.

����� She stepped forward and placed a loving
hand on the head of the blond woman kneeling before him. �That will do nicely,
Ayla.� I think his lordship says he has
had enough.�

����� Ayla gave him one last flick of her tongue
along the shaft of his member and backed away leaving his dick hard and wet and
with no possibility of relief in sight.�
Jack almost broke down and cried as his relief vanished.

����� �Please.�
Take me down now.� I�m done with
this fantasy.� he said.� Things had
started off fun enough, but now they had turned disturbing.� Jack had never been more helpless than he was
now and it was beginning to scare him. 

����� The lady in black stepped up to him,
leaning in to press her chest against his and Jack could feel the softness of
her breasts beneath the cloth which bound them.�


����� �Have you really had enough?� She asked
him.

����� Jack slowly nodded. �Yes, mistress.
Please.� I�ll do anything.� I don�t think I want this anymore.�

����� �Then why don�t you quit?�

����� �Okay I�ll....huh?�� 

������ It hit him suddenly.� The safe word!� He had forgotten all about it.� Say the safe words and everything would be
back to normal except he would be kicked out of his fantasy.� 

������ But even if his body was throbbing, his
mind clouded with agony, he could still tell there was something not quite
right.� It seemed all too easy.

����� �Quit?�
You mean....use my safe word and go back?� I don�t want to quit.� I just want you to stop hurting me.�

������ Her dark eyes smiled at him.� It was an evil smile, devoid of any feeling.
�It is a simple thing to do, my lord.�
You have but to call out your safe word three times and all will be
well.� I promise you.�

����� �Fuck you.� Jack retorted defiantly, not
believing what he was hearing.� Fantasy
was gone out the window now and Jack was really scared.

����� �Well,� The dark mistress chuckled as she
backed away. �If you will not quit for me, will you scream for me?� Is it not the least you could do?�

����� For a brief moment fresh strength infused
him and Jack strained every muscle in his body to break his bonds but he soon
slumped in exhaustion, all the fight in him was gone as he realized the chains
were not going to break.

����� �This is not real...this is not
real...this is not real.� He began to repeat over and over again.

����� �It is real enough, my lord.� The lady in
black mocked. �Varisa?� Ayla?� I think it is time we used more persuasive
methods.�

����� �Yes, mistress.� Both answered nearly in
unison.

������ Jack watched as Ayla stepped over to the
wall and retrieved a four foot long leather whip with shining bits of metal
entwined in the braid.� The other blond,
Varisa, put her monstrous paddle back on its proper set of hooks and picked up
a second whip identical to the first.

������ The lady in black gave one more look to
Jack as he hung helplessly in the dungeon room, his eyes full of desperation
and fear. �Continue with your work, my dears, but use the razor whips only
sparingly.� I have something much more
painful in mind for him and I shall return shortly.�

������ Razor whips?� More painful?�
She had to be joking.� But if she
wasn�t?

������ He was near panic.� He had to do something.� Jack filled his lungs with air and screamed. 

������ �HELP ME!� SOMEBODY HELP ME!� THESE BITCHES HAVE GONE CRAZY!�

������ All three women laughed.� �My lord,� The lady in black informed him.
�There is no one who will hear your cries for help.� You only waste your strength.� It would be a shame if you did not save some
for later.�

������ And with that she turned and left.� Ayla and Varisa stepped up and held their
whips for him to see.� Jack turned his
head away rather than see the instruments they were going to use on him. 

������ Both women snickered as they stepped to
either side, one to his front and the other behind him.� Jack closed his eyes, preparing for the first
blows to fall.� He knew this was going to
hurt.� Those whips would shred his skin
like tissue paper.� 

������ Using his safe word was starting to look
better and better.� But there was an
uneasy feeling in his stomach.� If this
was supposed to be his fantasy world then why were the computer generated
people trying to kick him out of it?� He
did not know but whatever reason was behind it, Jack knew it would certainly
not be good.� Quickly, and with far more
courage than he thought he ever had, Jack decided to try and hold on for as
long as he could.� Perhaps this was all
scripted and soon his rescuers would come running down the dungeon stairway.

������ �Ayla?�
Varisa?� The mistress suddenly called from beyond the chamber
entrance.� �Come and help me a moment.�

����� Jack opened his eyes and saw an expression
of sheer disappointment cross the face of Ayla, the blow job tease.� 

������ �Come on,� She said to her companion. �,
lets go see what she wants.�� As Varisa
walked by she caressed his flank with her nails, �Why don�t you hang around
awhile until we return, my lord.�� And
both women walked out the chamber entrance laughing, coiling their whips at
their sides.� 

������ Though he could no longer relax without
feeling as if his arms were being ripped from their sockets, he breathed a
quick sigh of relief.� He had been given
a momentary reprieve but soon they would be back and he did not know how much
more he could take.� The paddle had been
bad enough.� His ass and the backs of his
legs felt bloody and burning.� But those
barbed whips horrified him beyond words.�
He did not want to be on the receiving end of them but there was soon to
be little choice.� Either he could use
that safe word and go back to the real world or he could hang there while three
crazed women continued to torture him.�
He fought through the pain filled haze that was clouding his judgment
and searched for any other option that was open.

����� �Where the hell is Axel at when I need
him?�� Jack muttered absentmindedly.

����� �I�m right here, Jack.�

����� The familiar voice was a shock to his
ears.� His eyes brightened as the small
statured man stepped into his view. 

����� �Axel?� Jack cried out, not fully
believing what he was seeing. �Is that really you?�

����� �Shhhhhh! It is me.� But you have to be quiet or else they will
hear.�� 

����� �Where have you been you lazy fucker?� Zap �em, Axel.� Snap your fingers or somethin�.� Those bitches are evil.� 

����� Axel took his hand and placed it over
Jack�s mouth. 

����� �MMMMmmmmmmmph?�

����� �Jack,� Axel said at barely more than a
whisper.� �Listen carefully.� I am here to help you but you must hold
on.� I could not come until I was called
but I promise I will get you out of this.�

����� Jack jerked away from Axel�s hand. �What
the hell is going on here?� He returned with a whisper of his own and a quick
glance at the entrance to make sure they had not already been heard.�� �I thought this was a medieval sex-fest, not
a torture session with the wicked witches of the west.�

����� �Trust me when I say it was not meant to
be so.� His assistant said. 

����� �Then what the hell happened?�

����� Axel looked to the dark entrance of the
cell then back to Jack�s abused form. �Something very, very bad has
happened.� I will tell you more about it
later but for now I must go and get help.�

����� �What?� Jack almost shouted, remembering
at the last moment they were supposed to be quiet. �You are NOT leaving me
chained up here with these psycho women, Axel.�

����� �I promise I will be back as soon as I
can.� Axel tried to explain.

����� �No,no,no,no,no.� You need to find a way to get me down...or
better yet; you need to zap my big ass to somewhere nice and safe.�

����� He remained undeterred.� He shook his head.� �It is not that simple.� I can�t do that anymore.�

����� �Axel,� Jack nearly sobbed in desperation.
�, these women have barbed whips they are going to use on me.�

����� �I swear to you, Jack,� The assistant said
trying to be as reassuring as possible. �I will come back just as soon as I get
help.� But in the meantime, and this is
extremely important, you must not use your safe word in an attempt to escape.� Do you understand?�

����� �Why not?� He asked. �I�m not stupid.� They want me to use them but I�ve been
holding out so far cause I know something really fucked up is going to happen
when I do.� But I don�t know how much
more I can take.�

����� �I will explain later.�

����� Axel stepped away. �Remember, Jack.� Whatever you do, you cannot use the
failsafe.� It is a trap.�

����� Jack could not help himself.� His voice called out. �Axel? Axel!� Damn you, don�t leave me here!� You sorry fuck!�

����� With one final twist back Axel snapped his
fingers and dissolved away just as Ayla and Varisa came back into the
cell.� Neither one of them were pleased
by the interruption.

����� �Who were you talking to, worm?� Ayla
asked harshly.

����� �Go fuck yourself.�

����� Having the cavalry on the way was a great
boost to Jack�s morale.� There were only
two problems.� (A)How much morale could a
man beaten and whipped bloody and chained up in a torture chamber have once his
tormentors returned and (B) how long was it going to take the cavalry before
they arrived. 

����� The lady in black returned to the
entranceway. �Was he talking with someone?� 

����� �The mutterings of a fool driven mad, more
the like.� Varisa offered in explanation.

����� A sadistic smile crossed the face of the
other blond. �Soon to be driven even madder, I�ll wager.�

����� Jack saw the mistress�s eyes narrow.� Finally she said. �Very well.� Ayla, bind and prepare him.� Varisa come with me.�

����� Both women nodded their consent and the
lady in black retreated back into the darkness with Varisa.� Jack watched Ayla as she went over to the
wall and took down a thin leather thong about eighteen inches in length.� In the corner of the room was a small jar
which she also picked up. 

������ �What are you gonna do with that?�

������ �Watch me.� She chuckled.

������ She went down on her knees in front of
him again and slowly started to stoke his now flaccid penis back to an
erection.� Even through the pain it was
not long before he began to respond.�
Expertly she took the thong and began to tie it tightly around the base
of his member so as to keep the blood from flowing out of the erection.� Then she worked the cord down and around his
sagging testicles and roughly bound them in such a way as they were not only
kept separated from his body but also from each other.� Then she intricately laced it up the shaft
and tied the thong off at the head and looked up with a smile.� All the while Jack peered down helplessly,
gasping with each yank and squeeze.

������ �Did you enjoy my tongue, worm?� I am an expert in its use for all manner of
pleasures.� Ayla cupped his ball sack one last time. �I have also been
instructed in every manner of cock and ball torture known to womankind.� This is one of my favorites.� Perhaps it will be one of your favorites
too.�

������ She reached down to the jar at her side
and lifted out a liberal amount of an opaque jelly-like substance.

������ �Now be prepared.� She said mockingly.
�The salve will be cold....but not for long.�

������ Ayla took the salve and smeared it over
his balls and stiff cock and Jack took in a sharp breath.� Cold was not exactly the word he would have
used.� Frigid would have been
better.� And despite himself he began to
enjoy the sensation of her hand massaging the cold cream onto his tightly bound
package.

������ From behind, Varisa waddled in, a
brazier in her mitten covered hands with tendrils of distorted air shimmering
up from its contents. 

������ �Oh, no fucking way!� Jack exclaimed as
he realized what was about to be done to him.

������ �HELP ME!� HELP ME SOMEBODY!!� He screamed. �AXEL!� GET YOUR ASS BACK DOWN HERE AND HELP ME!�

������ Varisa sat the brazier in the middle of
the floor only a couple of feet in front of him.� It stood about two feet off the ground and
the coals in the heart of it were glowing red.

������ �AXEL!!�
YOU SORRY MOTHERFUCKER!� WHERE THE
HELL ARE YOU?�

������ �Don�t waste your lungs, yet, worm.� There is so much screaming left to be done.�
Ayla said with a smirk.

������ �Of course,� Varisa retorted. �You could
always use your safe word and all of this will be over.� What say you?�

������
�Drop dead.� He cried out with all the bravado he could muster.

������ Varisa laughed derisively.� �Is that really the best you can do?� I should think you would know so many better
insults to use on us than that.�

������ �I tire of this game.� Ayla said though
her eyes watched him with lustful excitement.�
Both these women wanted to see him squirm and hear him scream and beg
for mercy. �Let us finish him and get our reward.�

������ �Very well.� Varisa agreed.� Her booted foot went to the corner of the
brazier and gently began to push it ever so slowly toward the apex of his
spread legs.� 

������ Jack�s breathing became labored as he
prepared himself for the white hot, soul searing pain that was to come.� He watched as the brazier moved ever closer
with each second.� He could not pull his
eyes from the sight of it creeping toward his tender parts.� 

������ And even after Axel had told him not to
do it, the safe word started mulling around in his head almost ready to spill
out of his lips.

������ BLAAAAMMMMM!

����� The thundering echo was a tremendous shock
to both Jack and his two torturers.� The
women whirled on the entrance, the brazier only inches from being directly
beneath his exposed crotch.� From out
beyond the door there was a commotion going on.�
He could hear muffled voices yelling at distance.� 

����� BLAAAAMMMMM!� BLAAAAAAMMM! BLAAAAAAMMM!� 

������ There was the gut wrenching screech of
wood being torn asunder as one of the heavy dungeon doors was battered and
split off its hinges.� 

������ That was all the incentive Varisa needed
to leave.� Without a word she bolted
through the door and was gone before Ayla had any time to react.

������ �HOLD THERE!!!� Came a booming female
voice. �HOLD, I SAY!!!�

������ This was the chance he had been waiting
for.� The cavalry had arrived.

������ �I�M IN HERE!!! HELP ME!!! I�M HERE!!!�
Jack blasted as loudly as he could.

������ Ayla turned then.� Spite filled her brown eyes. �Burn, you
bastard!� Burn and say the words!�

������ With one foot she kicked the brazier the
final short way between his spread legs.�
Jack�s eyes turned wild as the coals were only a few inches from his
family jewels and the heat came on immediately with an intensity he had not
expected.� He screamed like he had never
screamed before as the salve began to melt and bubble on the soft skin of his
balls and prick.

������ Ayla stood there for another brief
second and gave him a final, wicked smile as she made a run for it too.

������ Jack did not know how long it took
before the first of the guards entered into the room and kicked the brazier
over onto the floor.� It seemed like
hours, but he knew it could not have been that long.� But still, after the heat was gone, his balls
still burned, and he still screamed.� He
did not notice as Axel and a beautiful young woman with long, straight red hair
and a round face, wearing a cloak of blue and gold entered into the room while
guards unfettered his wrists and ankles and laid him gently on the floor.� Jack saw Axel and the woman speak to him. �At least their mouths moved but he could not
hear anything.� Then everything started
to turn gray.� He wondered if he was
starting to go blind.� No, that was
silly.� With a sudden, heart thumping,
jolt he thought that maybe he had said his safe word and activated the failsafe
shutdown or whatever it was they had been trying to force him to do.� But no again.�
He had not said anything like that.�
At least he didn�t think so.�
Maybe he was...just..... passing.............out............

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

����� �Jack?�

����� His mind had been floating near the
surface of consciousness for some time waiting for the right reason to wake
him.� His name was the trigger it had
been looking for.� Jack opened his eyes
drowsily but the light was too bright and he had to wait while they adjusted so
he could see his surroundings.

����� �What happened?�

����� �Is it any wonder?� You passed out.�

������ �Is it over?� He asked.

����� �Is what over?� 

����� �The fantasy, is it over?�

����� �No.�
Fortunately for you it is not.�

����� �Fortunately for me?�� Jack laughed as he tried to focus and the
vague outlines of shapes coalesced into solid objects. �Hello Axel, you sorry
bastard.�

����� The PPA smiled as he sat down next to him.
�Good to have you back, Jack.� And still
in proper spirits too, I see.� I was
getting worried for a moment.�

����� One quick glance around the room and he
immediately felt at ease.� He was no
longer in the dungeon cell but in a bedroom, tucked into a soft, warm bed with
covers up to his chest.� The light of mid
morning poured into the room and the windows were open to allow in fresh
air.� Rose petals had been tossed onto
the bed and the pillow had been scented with sweet oils.� It was all designed to make him feel better.� 

����� And how did he feel?� He wasn�t really hurting as he thought he
should be.� The memories of his
experience at the hands of the lady in black and her two companions had come
rushing back to him nearly as soon as his senses had come aware.� But still there was no pain.� Not even in his balls.� Even so he was scared to move.��� 

����� �How am I doing, Axel?� Am I burned for life?�

����� He was given a most reassuring smile. �No
worries.� It is one of the fundamental
rules of any of �the Core�s� programs.�
If you are harmed in any way, the program is set to heal you with great
rapidity.� After all, it would not do for
a user to walk into a shower of arrows or under a falling gargoyle and be
unable to experience the rest of his fantasy because of a slow recovery
time.� You should be perfectly fine.� In fact, as long as you are in the program
you are very nearly indestructible.�

����� Breathing a sigh of relief, Jack moved his
legs.� Even after listening to Axel he
still half expected a burst of pain from his abused thighs.� When nothing happened, he slid his hands
under the covers and gently brushed his fingertips against his cock and
balls.� Everything felt normal, so he
felt of the underside of the spongy head of his dick.� He distinctly remembered the feel of that
soft tissue blistering as the salve Ayla had so liberally massaged into it
boiled from the heat of the red hot coals.�


������ It was still slightly tender but nothing
out of the ordinary.

����� Everything was fine.� Exactly how it should be.� This is how his fantasy was supposed to
be.� Except Axel was a beautiful woman
ready and willing to pleasure him at the first sign of his waking.� Jack looked at the gruff little man and
decided that was not going to happen.

����� �Okay, Axel.� I got a few questions for ya�.� First, what the fuck took you so long?� They worked me over for hours!�

����� �One hour twenty three minutes to be
precise.� The PPA provided matter-of-factly. �I came as soon as I was called.�

����� �Oh, so you were watching with a
stopwatch?�

����� �Jack,� Axel said consolingly, �there was
nothing I could do.� I was not released
from the program start-gate until you said my name.� I came almost immediately, if you will
remember.�

����� Jack had to give him that one. �Yeah,
well, okay.� But why didn�t you just snap
me back to here or something?�

����� Axel leaned closer. �Remember when I came
to speak with you and I told you I was going for help.� I knew then I could not exhibit the same
level of control within the program as I had previously.�

����� �You can�t zap anymore?�

����� �I have limited mobility for myself within
the choice program but that is all.� I am
afraid that is not the only control I have lost.� I am also unable to gain access back to the
program start-gate.�

����� Jack was clueless. �Well....what does that
mean?�

����� �That means there is no way of going back
to the program start-gate.� We are
confined to the parameters of this program.�

����� �How in the hell a......are you trying to
tell me we�re trapped here, in a computer program...is that even possible?�

����� Axel shifted uncomfortably. �At this point
it would certainly seem so.�

����� �I�m a living, breathing person.� I have a body...even if it isn�t much.�

����� �Yes, well.� With the program start-gate shut down there
was always your emergency access to the failsafe which would get you back to
the �main�.�

����� �Yeah. You told me not to use it,
remember?�

����� �There was good reason for this.� Axel
replied. �While your Personal Program Assistant, I am not only responsible for
basic interaction with your user profile I am also charged with monitoring the
state of your physical being.�

����� �So you keep track of my body just like
the technicians back at the lab?�

����� �Precisely.� Only...� The PPA hesitated.

����� �Spit it out, Axel. It looks like you
swallowed a frog.�

����� �...well.....Jack, since you were
downloaded into the program I have stopped receiving updates of the status of
your physical being.�

����� Jack�s eyes narrowed. �Wait,
wai....wait.� You stopped getting info on
the condition of my body?�

����� Axel frowned but nodded.

����� �Okay...so is that normal?�

����� Axel shook his head.

����� �So what does that mean...I mean, you say
yourself you don�t have as much mojo as you used to have, right?�

����� �Agreed,� He was forced to admit. �There
are two very distinct possibilities.�

����� �Which are?�

����� �Either I have lost access to the data,
which is, of course, a logical assumption....or your physical being has been
removed from the connection.�

����� �You mean gone...unplugged.�

����� �Yes.�
That is why I told you not to enable the emergency failsafe.� There is no more access to the Program
start-gate.� Without access I cannot tell
if the main start-gate has maintained its integrity.� If there is no main start-gate to return to
your user profile would have been sent back to its host form.�

����� �And with no body to return to?�

����� �Your user profile would have been
deleted.�

������ That struck him like a fist.� The women who had tortured him had wanted him
to activate the failsafe.� If he had
broken and said the safe word, he would have been killed.� �How did this happen.� Jack asked, dumbfounded.

����� �I do not know, but I believe we must
discover the reasons why this has happened, who is behind it and if the current
situation can be amended or reversed.�

����� �Hey, Axel?�

������ �Yes, Jack?�

����� �If something has happened to my body,
why am I still here?�

����� �I do not know.� Perhaps it is some residual effect of your
leftover consciousness.� Axel said.� His
tone was not reassuring. �This is most extraordinary.�

����� �You�re tellin� me?�

����� His blonde assistant smiled then. �It is
not all bad news, Jack.� There are some
people waiting outside I think you should meet and we also have a surprise for
you.�

����� �A surprise?� For me?�
Axel, you shouldn�t have.�

����� �Of course I should have.� He
replied.� �You are still lord of the
castle until we can figure a way out of this for you.�

����� He clapped his hands together loudly and
the door to the chamber opened as Jack threw back the covers.� A young girl, no older than fourteen or
fifteen, stepped meekly into the room.�
She wore breeches and boots and a simple green tunic.� Her hair was a dark red mass of curls and
wavy bits someone had clumsily tried to pin back.� Nervously she bowed as he sat up on the side
of the bed.

����� �M....my lord.� I...�

����� �Who the hell is this?� Jack interrupted. 

����� �M.....my...my lord...�

����� �Damn, Axel.� She is worse than you are.� Is this my surprise?�

����� The young girl looked up, her eyes wide
with fear and Axel laughed. �Most certainly not.� This is your squire.�

����� Jack frowned. �I thought squires were
boys?�

����� �Yes, well.� There are several aspects of this program
that are rather a bit different than what they should be.� Consider it yet another strange aspect of
this mystery we must solve.�

����� Jack shrugged. �Hell, I think I would just
settle for getting back to my body.� Hey,
girl, what�s your name?�

����� �My..my lord, .....K...Ktari, my
lord.� I...�

����� Jack held up a hand to quiet her.� �Calm down before you have a stroke.�

����� �Of course.� She answered, scared nearly
beyond words.

����� �Okay, whatever.� Axel, what is this girl supposed to do?�� He leaned in a little closer and covered his
mouth. �What exactly is she supposed to do for me?�

����� �She is supposed to help you in any way
she can.�

����� �She�s a little too young...�

����� �No.� Axel interrupted. �Not that.� Ktari here will dress you, fetch your meals
for you, and stand by while you have your morning ablutions....�

����� �While I what?�

����� �While you bathe.� He answered
patiently.� �In short, she is your
personal servant.� If you are going to be
here for a while then I believe you will need whatever assistance she can
offer.�

����� �Okay.� Jack stretched out a hand in
greeting. �Hi, Ktari.� I�m Jack.� It�s nice to meet you.�

����� The girl saw the offered hand and shrank
away.

����� �Don�t be frightened, child.� Axel told
her.� �Step forward and take it.� My lord is a kindly man.� He will not harm you�

����� With a hesitant look up to him, she slowly
tip toed forward and gently took his hand.�
Jack smiled as they shook.� The
girl was short and thin, all knees and elbows and not even very pretty.� She was just ordinary, and Jack marveled at
the engineering that had gone into this program, into all the programs, into
the �Core� itself, to create such a complete world for the mind to wander
in.� And, in his case, for the mind to
get lost in.� Because as he smiled, he
began to realize there was no other place for him to go.� No way to get home.� Not that there was all that much for him to
miss or to go back to.� But still, it was
his world.

����� �It�s nice to meet you, Ktari.�

����� �Y...you honor me, my lord.� It is a great honor to make your
acquaintance.�

����� �Look, I think my friend Axel here has a
few people he wants me to say hello to.�
Since you are gonna be my helper, can you find me some clothes to wear?�

����� �Of course, my lord.� As you wish.� And she scampered off.

����� Jack turned to his assistant. �Do you
think she knows what she�s doin?�

����� Axel smiled and nodded. �If she does not
know, I am sure her sister will beat her until she does.�

����� �Her sister?� Jack asked.

����� �Yes.�
Lady Lynette Hunter.� She is the
captain of your guard.� Axel answered. �And, I might add, one of the first to
find you in the dungeon and save you.�
She is awaiting you in the day chamber with other members of the
household.�

����� Jack breathed deeply, savoring the fresh
air. �Well, I guess it would be rude of me to disappoint them.�

&nbsp;

����� Disappoint he did not...and neither did
Ktari.� In a flash she returned with
black riding boots, buff colored breeches and a blue tunic with the golden
eagle of Hargate across its chest.�
Disappointment filled him when he discovered he would have to put his
clothes on normally.� Apparently Axel had
lost the power to dress him with a snap as Lothor had done.� So be it. 

����� After dressing he stood in front of a hand
tempered bronze mirror and hummphed a short approval.� He turned sideways, studying himself from all
angles.

����� �You know, it looks like I lost some
weight in the transition.� What do you
think, Axel?�

����� �You look fine, Jack.� He answered,
sounding more like a husband asked once too often by his wife if she were too
fat.

����� �Yeah, I do.�� He turned to his companion. �Let�s go.�

����� The heavy wooden doors swung open and Axel
and Jack strode into the day room, with tiny Ktari bringing up the rear.� The room itself was immense.� There were two distinct levels; the lower
level was adorned with a writing desk, a small dining table and chairs, a large
globe and map table.� The upper level,
separated by banisters and a short set of stairs, was lined with bookshelves
and another, even larger table with high backed chairs.� That was where they waited.

����� Jack was pure nerves but even he was
surprised by how well he handled the meeting.�
There were half a dozen men and women waiting for him.� Axel introduced them and in turn they came up
and bowed.� Lady Jane Tolway was the
first.� She was a delicate but well
proportioned brunette in a rather plain dress with striking blue eyes.� She was the Steward of Hargate and therefore,
Axel explained, was responsible for keeping the place running properly.� Sir Jeremy Ross was Master of the Horse.� He was short like Axel but built like a
bodybuilder, he had short black hair and a black beard which came to a point
below his chin which looked sharp enough to spear a wayward hand...or
sausage.� Mistress Roslyn was the
resident healer.� Though her face was worn
with the first signs of age she was still quite pretty.� Her smile was warm and inviting and Jack felt
the sudden urge to sit her down and tell her all his troubles.� Next was Sir Alwyn Kessel, he was dressed in
full armor, complete with helmet under his arm, just like when Axel had first
greeted him.� He was of medium height and
weight, with long dark hair and trimmed beard.�
His eyes were big and expressive and almost as blue as Lady
Tolway�s.� He was the Master of Foot at
Hargate.� Sir Robin Beckford was next
up.� Slim and pale, it made Jack�s skin
crawl just to look at him. �The man
looked even more like a snake than some real live snakes he had seen.� Axel named him Master-at-Arms for
Hargate.� He was the one responsible for
keeping weapons, provisions and also for training of the new recruits into the
guards and levy.� And last but not
least....Lady Lynette Hunter stepped forward.�
He briefly recalled her from his final moments in the dungeon before he
passed out.� Now that he had time to
concentrate on her he was stunned.� Even
in her armor he could tell she was small but lithe.� Her dark red hair was parted in the middle
and flowed down about her shoulders.� She
had green eyes, a spatter of freckles...and she was one of the most beautiful
women Jack had ever seen.� Of course, he
had thought the same thing about the woman in black before her, and her little
friends, had tried to cook him like a pig over a fire. 

����� �My lord, it is good to see you up and
about.� Lynette said to him and he was forced to smile.

����� �After what they did I�m lucky to still be
alive.�� And in truth he was.� He was beginning to feel just how close of a
thing it had been.� Even now, if he were
to burst out with three little words he would probably cease to exist.� It was a scary thought to have your own
demise on the tip of your tongue.� 

����� �I guess I should thank you.� Jack told
her with a quick glance back at Axel. �I was told that you were the one who
really saved me.�

����� �No thanks are necessary, my lord.� I was merely doing what I have sworn to do.� 

����� �Well, thank you anyway.�

����� �I am always at your lordship�s service.�
She said with a bow. �But it is with much regret I must tell you we were not
able to capture the ones responsible for your suffering.�

����� Jack shook his head. �I didn�t think you
would be.� She was probably long gone
before you arrived.�

����� �What does His Lordship remember of the
incident?� Slimy Sir Robin asked. �Anything at all would be of the utmost
help.�

����� Jack knew that he was merely a computer
simulation of a person but he still could not stand him.� With a hard tone and a menacing glance he
answered. �I remember being taken and almost killed in my own castle.� Does that help?�

����� Sir Robin bowed again and slinked away
toward the back of the group and out of his line of sight.� But soon his anger cooled and he told
everything he remembered, from when he had first met the lady in black all the
way up until he was screaming for his life as Lady Lynette and the guards burst
through the dungeon door. 

����� �And does His Lordship know this woman in
red and black?� Lady Jane asked him, utterly fascinated by the story he told.

����� �Never seen her before in my life.� He
answered. �Not a single one of them.�

����� Lady Lynette shook her head. �That is
something I do not understand.� This
woman and her minions were able to enter into the most heavily guarded rooms of
the castle and spirit His Lordship away without issue.� They were not even challenged.�

����� �They were able to escape our grasp by use
of a hidden passage.� Perhaps there were
more that allowed their entrance.� Sir Alwyn argued. �There is no other way.�

����� �Yes that is possible.� Mistress Roslyn
interjected. �But we miss the obvious as well...that they were aided from
inside the castle.�

����� There was a round of muttering among the
group.� Jack stood back and watched with
as much confusion as ever.� This was all
so absurd. 

����� Then Axel cleared his throat to gain the
attention of everyone.� 

������ �Good knights and ladies,� He said to
them with a quick look to Jack. �, there is no need to argue.� I have but a simple solution.�

����� �And pray, sir, what would that solution
be?� Sir Jeremy said.

����� �Why, sir....if we do not know who this
mysterious lady in black was, and where she came from or who sent her, then we
have but to ask.�

����� Jack frowned. �What is that supposed to
mean.�

����� Axel smiled.� It was evil and conspiratorial at the same
time.� �Remember the surprise I was
telling you about, Jack?�

����� �Yeah.�

����� �Even if the lady in black was able to
evade us....one of her minions may not have.�

����� There was a sharp intake of breath from
several in the group. �We�ve got a prisoner?� Jack asked, heart thundering in
his chest.

����� �Not quite, but I may know where one of
them went to.�

����� �Axel,you dramatic fucker, why didn�t you
just say so?�

����� 

����� 

�����

Version 13

By

The Gray_Man

&nbsp;

Part II

����� �Well this certainly beats the hell out of
working for a living.�

����� Jack leaned back, propping his boots up on
the edge of the table and finished off another goblet of honey ale.� It didn�t taste like anything he had ever
drank before...not that he was a big drinker in the �real world�.� Still, it was an acquired taste that he had
spent the last few days trying to gain.�
It seemed to the others around the table that he had succeeded.�� After the last few drops crossed his lips he
let go with a rolling belch that drew everyone�s attention accept for
Axel.� He was sitting in the corner of
the chamber by himself trying to see if, by sheer practice, he could regain
some of the control abilities he had lost.

����� �You know, its kinda sad to see you over
there snapping your fingers and nothing ever happening.�

����� �Patience my friend, it will come to
me.� I am sure of it.�

����� Jack chuckled. �Yeah.� Whatever. �

����� More than a week had passed since he had
been trapped in the computer world and nothing had really changed.�� Day to day life continued on.� Or what could best be described as day to day
life at Hargate Castle.� More like a
boring version of life in the real world, medieval style. 

������ Even the finer details of life, such as
bodily needs, were within the boundaries of the simulation.� He got hungry about the same time of day as
he usually did so Jack dived right in to Hargate�s cuisine and surprisingly he
had to admit, the food was excellent.� A
testament to this was the greasy bones of a roasted chicken plated near his
propped feet.� It had been served with an
herb stuffing, buttered garlic potatoes and a heel of warm bread.� He would pay for eating it later, he knew,
when he would have to make a deposit in his own personal waste closet.� For now he was content.� But the newness was wearing off and boredom
was quickly setting in.� Lynette was so
intent that nothing should happen to him again that she had placed a squad of
her best guards at his set of rooms with orders to go with him wherever he
went.� This had quickly got annoying and
soon Jack abandoned exploring.� 

������ So if he was a virtual prisoner in his
own rooms what was he to do all day?�
Jack had wished on more than one occasion for cable but had to settle for
reading the books his shelves offered.�
He had convinced Ktari to play chess with him but he soon let her go
once he realized she was purposely losing.�
And Jack had even contemplated asking someone to send him a couple of
nubile chambermaids to screw around with. This was, after all, supposed to be a
sexual fantasy world.� Why shouldn�t he
fuck every piece of ass in sight?�
Because, horror of all horrors, he had lost all desire for sex after his
run in with the �bitch in black�.� 

������ What was even worse is that he couldn�t
even rest well as he waited for his session to end, just as Lothor had told him
it would. Every night he would lay awake for hours trying to drift off to
sleep, not sure if he would wake up in the Future_Line lab or even not wake up
at all.� But eventually he would sleep,
and he would come to as Ktari pulled the heavy drapes of his bedroom allowing
in the first rays of the dawn.� Every
morning Axel could be found in the same place trying to get back the power he
had mysteriously lost.� And every morning
the search for answers continued in the courtyard, the village, and the
surrounding woods.� But nothing had been
found yet.� Nothing that would help.

������ Jack discovered he had been unconscious
for a full day after passing out in the dungeon.� In that time search parties had managed to
re-open the passage Lynette and some of the other guards had seen Ayla escape
through.� Apparently she had barred the
door to stop her pursuers.� By the time
they got it open their quarry was gone. �The narrow, winding corridor they found was
dark and rat infested and very easy to get stuck but it was empty.� The passage led directly from the dungeon to
the outer curtain wall amid an outcropping of rocks near the edge of the
forest.� In all likelihood the women were
long gone.� At least that was what Sir
Alwyn and Mistress Roslyn told him.� 

������ Axel seemed to think differently.� 

������ �Was anything found today?� He asked as
Ktari approached with a pitcher of ale to refill his goblet.

����� ��No, my lord.� Sir Alwyn muttered.

����� ��So
why have the guards spent the better part of the week searching the village and
castle?�

������ �Looking for one of your devil women.�
Axel answered without even looking up or breaking his concentration. �We have
been over this before.�

������ �Yeah, so maybe we have.�

������ Axel sighed deeply but deferred to the
expert. �Sir Jeremy?�

������ The big man straightened in his chair.
�My lord, at the egress to the passage that we opened we found two sets of
horse tracks leading away from the rocks into the woods.� The trail was followed by our best trackers
but unfortunately was lost.� However, a
third horse was found, saddled but riderless, wandering in the fields near the
rocks.�

������ �And that�s what makes you think one of
those bitches is still somewhere around here?�

������ �Your council is divided on this.� Sir
Robin interjected. �, but it is a logical assumption.�

������ �Agreed.� Axel said. �The tracks which
have been found are not overloaded...say by a horse carrying more than one
person.�

������ �The guards were summoned and sent to
their posts as soon as Sir Axel called upon me.� Lady Lynette added.� �Some were sent out the south and western
gates as a matter of routine.� The
passage exit is very near the western gate so perhaps the one we search for was
unable to make her getaway for risk being seen.�

������ Jack shrugged. �That still doesn�t mean
she�s hanging round here.�

������ �There is no place else for her to
go.� The woods are notorious for swallowing
people whole.� With no horse, no
supplies, her companions gone, she must bide her time until she thinks the
moment is right.� Axel said. �Besides, I can�t explain it but...somehow I can
feel her presence nearby.� That�s how I
can be so sure she is still here.�

������ �Okay, Axel, that�s just creepy.�

������ �Somewhere on the castle grounds I
should wager.�

������ �If she�s out there, where could she be?

������ �The woodline has been searched well.�
Sir Jeremy confided. 

������ �As have every room in the castle and
every house in the village...thrice over.� Lady Lynette muttered.

������ Jack threw up his hands in a shrug,
spilling ale on his tunic, �Look, guys, we�ve been turning over every stone we
can think of for a week looking for this bitch.�
So if she�s not in the village and not in the castle and not in the
woods, just where the fuck is she?� Hell,
do we even know if she made it out of the tunnel?��� 

������ Jack noticed Axel suddenly look up, Lady
Lynette frown, and Sir Jeremy glance at those around the table to see if they
had gotten it as well.

������ 

������ 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

����� There were several things Jack had never
thought he would ever do in life.� Ride a
horse was one of them.� It just wasn�t
one of those experiences which were high on his list of things to accomplish
before he died.� But being stuck in a
simulation of some twisted medieval world was quickly changing the size and
composition of his list.� The horse was a
massive destrier called Midnight, its shining black coat of hair giving ample
reason as to why.

������ Jack was scared at first.� The animal was huge, powerful, and thoughts
of it raising up and slamming a hoof right into the middle of his forehead kept
circling around in his mind.� But Ktari
had told him, in her own halting way, that Midnight was as gentle a horse as
she had ever known.� And that was saying
a lot for a girl who had worked in the castle stables for the better part of
her computer generated life.

����� Jack squirmed in the saddle.� It was taking some getting used to.� After only a short time his ass was sore, his
back hurt and his thighs were chaffing.�
If he stayed on Midnight much longer he would have a blistered
backside.� But he forced himself to
remain there.� It would look bad if he
got off, or complained about his soreness.�
And besides, if Ktari�s scrawny little ass could sit on a horse and ride
then so could he.� He was not going to be
outdone by a fourteen year old girl who couldn�t form a whole sentence without
a stutter.

����� Of course, the hard part was not sitting
on the horse, it was getting the beast to go forward, back and in whatever
direction you wanted it to go in exactly when you wanted it to go.� Fortunately for him he had plenty of help.� After some brief instructions from Sir
Jeremy, the horse followed along with the rest, nudging out some of the others
for head of the pack.� All Jack really
had to do was pull left or right on the reigns a bit and hold on as best he
could.....which he did by leaning forward and clutching to Midnight�s neck for
dear life.� 

����� At a canter Jack, Axel, Sir Jeremy, and an
escort of nearly forty soldiers, rode to the top of a low swell in the grassy
plain near the rock outcropping only a stone�s throw from the western
gate.� Jack reigned in clumsily but
Midnight responded, coming to a halt with only a slight turn to the left and
the others followed suit.

����� �Can somebody please tell me who came up
with this hair brained idea?�

����� �You did.� Axel answered. �Or at least you
started us on the idea.� 

����� Jack shook his head. �Who ever heard of a
hidden passage with hidden passages.� 

����� �In truth,� Sir Jeremy confided, �, the
passage was only checked to see where it led to.� There was no thought of the tunnel itself
being a place to hide.�

����� They were within sight of the
outcropping.� More than a dozen men were
scaling the rocks, some with torches, heading toward the recently discovered
mouth of the escape tunnel.� As Jack and
the others watched, one by one they slowly disappeared into the dark cavity.

����� �Trust me, Jack. � Axel told him, �She is
still here.� I can feel her closer now
than ever.� We will find her soon.�

����� Jack knew that on the other end, inside
the deep recesses of the castle dungeon, there was a similar scene being played
out.� Lady Lynette and a group of the
Household Guards were moving down the tunnel from the opposite direction.� 

����� Jack sighed, utterly frustrated. �This
could take days.� If there are more
tunnels, she could be anywhere in the castle.�
Axel, don�t you remember the layout of this place or anything like that?�

����� �I am afraid I have found my knowledge of
Hargate Castle to be faulty.�

����� �Well, that�s no comfort.�

����� �As we have said before,� He continued on.
�, this is not quite right.� This program
is not as it should be.� There are many
things....wrong here.� It is but another
mys...�

����� Jack waved him off. �Oh please.� We have enough mysteries to solve for one
lifetime.� I don�t think we need any
more.�

����� Shouts came from inside the tunnel.� They were faint because the group was so far
away but they were incessant.

����� Jack�s ears perked up.� What the hell? 

����� Axel was quick. �Sir Jeremy?� He called
and without a word the big man spurred his horse into a slow gallop toward the
rocks with many of the mounted soldiers in tow.�
The commotion which followed was hard to see but still it was
fascinating to watch.� He saw a woman
with long blonde hair pulled back into a ponytail break from the tunnel
entrance and try to climb down the rocks.�
She was an agile little thing, he had to admit, as she bounded from one
stone pile to the next until finally jumping down to the ground already at a
run.� Men of the search party were
erupting from the tunnel but they were all too slow.� The blonde woman was very fast with a huge
head start and she might have even had a chance to get away if those on foot
were the only ones in pursuit.� But she
could not outrun a horse....much less thirty of them.

����� She was halfway to the forest edge when
Sir Jeremy rode her down.� Expertly he
galloped up beside her as she ran, and for an instant it seemed as if the woman
put on more speed in a vain attempt to get away.� But then two more riders came up, bracketing
her and tossed forth a large hunting net which covered her completely.� She tripped and fell hard, tumbling to a stop
as the mounted soldiers rode past.�
Others jumped down and even then the woman did not give up, fighting
desperately to claw her way out of the net and through the ever growing number
of guards that surrounded her.� 

����� Axel gestured toward their captive with a
wide grin. �I told you she was here.�
Shall we?�

����� He had not expected such quick
results.� In fact, he had not expected
any results.� �Well, hell yeah.� Let�s go see who we got.� He replied and
awkwardly nudged Midnight forward.� 

����� By the time Jack got to them, the guards
had removed the net from their captive, bound her hands behind her back and
hobbled her feet to keep her from kicking.�
She had already nearly shattered one kneecap and two sets of balls.� As he approached the woman caught sight of
him, and almost immediately her struggling ceased.� Her eyes and appearance took on the look of a
trapped animal amid her heavy breathing.�
He examined her quickly.� Her hair
and face were dirty, her clothing filthy from living in the passages for a week
but it was the same person he remembered from the dungeon.� There was no mistaking her.

����� Jack peered down at her. �Hey, Ayla.� What�s up?�

����� She spit at him, the stream striking him
in the shoulder.� One of the guards
rewarded her with a fist slamming into her gut.�
Ayla doubled over and sagged in the arms of her captors. �May you fall
through the Great Abyss for all eternity.� She managed to groan.

����� He wiped the spittle away from his tunic.
�Yeah, its good to see you too, sunshine.�
So..uh where are your friends at?�
We could all get back together and talk about old times.�

����� �Long gone I trust.� You won�t ever find them.� She managed to
say.� She was a brave woman.� Jack had to give her credit.����� 

������ Sir Jeremy pranced up on his roan
stallion, �My lord, I�ve spoken with the commander of the search party.� She was exactly where we thought she would
be, hidden inside a side tunnel no more than two feet high, living with the
rats.� What shall be done with her?� He
inquired.

����� Axel nudged closer to his side. �She must
be questioned.�

����� Jack shrugged. �But what if she doesn�t
want to say anything?� He whispered back.

����� �I can assure you.� She will not tell us what we wish to know of
her own accord so do not be na�ve about what I propose.� This is a medieval simulation...of a fashion.� We must use whatever methods are available to
us.�

����� �I don�t exactly know how I feel about
that.� He said hesitantly.� They were
talking about some brutal stuff.

����� �Remember,� Axel pushed. �This is one of
the same women who tortured and almost killed you.� If the roles were reversed, you know full
well what she would do with you.�

����� That got his attention...and helped make
up his mind.� He paused for a
moment.� Then, �Okay....Jerry?�

����� �Yes, my lord?� Sir Jeremy answered.

����� �Take her to the dungeon.�

����� Sir Jeremy nodded. �As you wish, my lord.�


����� Ayla was dragged away roughly but in
silence.� She knew what was coming and so
did the others who carried her toward her fate.

����� �I don�t want anything to do with it.�
Jack finally said once the others were out of earshot.

����� �Very well.� Axel conceded. �I shall
handle the matter if you wish.� But you
know it is for the best.�

����� �Yeah...I know.� He replied, deflated.

&nbsp;

����� 

&nbsp;

������ Some time later Jack finished another
cup of ale.� His fifth in the last hour.� The sweet liquid washed down his throat and a
buzz filled his ears.� He had never been
the type to drown his problems with alcohol but the events of the day were
pressing on his mind uncomfortably and a little numbing was welcome.� Ktari came out of nowhere and tried to refill
the cup but he held up his hand. �No, that�s okay, Nibblet.� I�m fine.�

����� �A..as you wish.� She stammered and fled.

����� The sun was setting and the sky outside
overhanging the battlements was an extraordinary display of clouds and color.� Absentmindedly he wondered what time it was
in the real world.� Was the sun setting
or rising on a new day there?� How much
time had even passed?� Would he ever get
back?� He didn�t know.� It was confusing to him and it made his head
hurt worse than it already did.�
Inevitably his thoughts returned to one thing.� 

����� Ayla

����� He shook his head.� There was no telling what was being done to
her.� Axel and the others didn�t seem to
have the same qualms about torture as he did.�
He always thought he was a product of a normal, civilized world where
torture was a bad thing....something the bad guys did to the good guys.� It didn�t matter what she and the other two
women had done to him, it was still wrong.�
They were all a product of this medieval simulation. �Except for Axel.� He was all by himself in this.� But Jack guessed that personal program
assistants didn�t have any more moral issues regarding the subject as anyone
else.� Yet even with his supposed moral
high ground it had taken him less than a minute to condemn Ayla to the
dungeon.� 

����� �Oh fuck it.� He muttered angrily and got
up from his seat.� Who was he to argue
about moral issues when he had ordered the woman interrogated in the first
place.� If she was tortured, then so be
it.� Better her than him this time.� But if these things were being done in his
name, right or wrong, then at least he should have the balls to witness them. 

����� He staggered once, then went for the
door.� Sentries were posted outside and
he ordered them to take him to the dungeon.

����� Soon they came to the winding staircase
which led down into the stone pit of a chamber.�
A place he had not visited since he had been a prisoner of its
walls.� He took each step slowly,
regretting all the honey ale he had taken on board.� About halfway down there was the audible
crack of a whip followed by a woman�s piercing scream.� Jack stopped, suddenly wondering if he could
continue on.� Quickly he found he had no
choice, not so much because of any moral issue, but because he was curious.

����� The small torture chambers lined the
wall.� Some were open and empty, others
with their doors bolted.� The sounds of
the whip and the screams got louder and louder until finally Jack came to the
right cell. 

����� Ayla hung from the ceiling, her wrists
bound behind her, her body hoisted up by her wrists in a cruel strappado.� Her feet dangled limply above the floor, and
a thin sheen of sweat covered every inch of her naked body.� Her flesh was crisscrossed with countless
angry lash wounds and her long blonde hair was matted to her forehead and sides
of her face.� Her head rolled and she
looked up with agony in her eyes.� She
saw him.

������ �You came to watch.� She rasped
deliriously between ragged breaths.�
Despite every fiber in his being wanting to turn away he was fascinated
with the sight of her.

������ �Jack?� Axel called. He was standing in
one corner of the small cell overseeing the interrogation.� Quickly he pulled him to the side. �What are
you doing here?� I though..�

������ He nodded, �I know.� But I had to see for myself.� Any progress?�

������ Axel frowned. �Not yet.� She is proving very stubborn, but you are
just in time.� I think Sir Robin believes
she is near to breaking.�

������ �Robin?� Jack asked. He had thought Sir
Robin Beckford to be distasteful as master-at-arms.� Now he was inquisitor too?� Somehow, Jack thought that fit better.

������ The whip cracked again and he watched as
the leather thong wrapped across her back, around her torso and struck against
her ample breasts.� A fresh line of red formed
and began to weep crimson tears as Ayla jerked in her bonds and uttered another
earsplitting scream.�� 

����� From another corner of the cell, Sir
Robin, clad in a bloody leather smock and as creepy as ever stepped forward and
with a thin, cadaverous hand, brushed a few strands of yellow hair away from
Ayla�s face as she cried.

����� �My dear child,� He said soothingly, �,
you have suffered so much.� Is it not
time to end this.� You have only to tell
me the things I wish to know and we can make your pain go away.�

����� A shiver went down Jack�s spine as he saw
the look in his eyes.� Sir Robin was not
only a good interrogator.� He was
enjoying this.

����� �MAY THE GODDESS DAMN YOU!� She retorted
with a screech of pain.

����� �Very well.� Sir Robin nodded to someone
in the background and two big men, sweaty and stripped to the waist,
appeared.� One held a rope and the other
a large stone ball which Jack judged to weigh about twenty pounds.� As he watched, one man grabbed Ayla�s
ankles.� She tried to resist but every
movement was agony to her strained shoulders and before long they were tied
tightly together.� The other man then
hooked the twenty pound stone to her bound ankles and with a shove, pushed it
out of his lap.� The ball fell to within
inches of the ground before the line caught sending Ayla swinging.� The extra weight was a shock on her arms and
she screamed and cursed wildly.

����� �I�LL SEE YOU ALL DIE FOR THIS!� She
exclaimed between screams.�
�MY...MISTRESS....WILL SEE YOU ALL....BEG FOR DEATH!�

����� Another session with the whip
followed.� More screams and more
blood.� The men helping Sir Robin spun
Ayla around so Jack could see her backside as well.� In the same manner as her front side, bloody
wounds marked the flesh of her back, ass, and legs.� The weight of the stone attached to her
ankles made her toes point to the floor and Jack could even see marks on the
soles of her feet.� After what seemed
like a lifetime Sir Robin finally asked her the questions again.

����� She was out of her head mad with pain and
she was beginning to utter things which they had been searching for without
even realizing it.

����� �YOU WILL ALL....DIE LIKE DOGS...WHEN MY
MISTRESS COMES!� HER ARMY..WILL SWEEP YOU
ALL...AWAY TO THE ABYSS!�

����� �We are not afraid of your mistress.� Sir
Robin told her. 

����� �YOU...WILL...BE!�� Her breath was coming shallow and hard now,
sweat and blood pooled at her feet.� Ayla
looked exhausted, like all her energy was gone.�
And just then, Jack could see into her eyes, and it looked as if hope
was leaving her as well.� Her spirit was
failing, her bravado gone.

����� �Tell me my dear,� Sir Robin cajoled
softly. �, tell me what we wish to know and all of this will be over.� Don�t you wish for me to stop?�

����� �Y...YES!� She screamed.

����� �Then tell us.� Tell us so we may help you.� Do you wish to tell us?�

������ Ayla started to cry then, openly sobbing
and Sir Robin and one of his assistants moved in to support her.� �GODDESS FORGIVE ME!� She bawled. �IT HURTS
SO MUCH.�

����� Jack watched Ayla break like a twig in
front of him.

����� Axel went over and knelt down next to Sir
Robin as the stone ball was removed from her ankles and she was gently lowered
to the ground.� Jack could hear her
sobbing but occasionally she would mutter a few words to her tormentors.� Jack paced back and forth, watching and
waiting.� 

����� Finally Axel stood, and so did Sir
Robin.� They both peered over their
shoulders with worried expressions.�
After a brief conversation Sir Robin ordered his helpers to carry Ayla�s
limp body into her cell.� They did so and
Jack noticed, after putting up with so much for so long, she had passed
out....just as he had done.� 

����� His assistant walked over and Jack could
see the expression on his face.

����� �What�s wrong?� He asked.

����� Axel sighed. �We have a problem.�

����� Jack threw up a stomach full of ale across
the dungeon floor.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

����� In the darkness Hargate Castle was usually
a quiet place.� Only the guards and a
scattering of servants were up at all hours.�
The fires along the battlements would have been lit to mark the castle�s
line and to keep the sentries who manned the walls warm.� The gates would be open for easy access by
returning patrols from the dark wood, along the roads and inside the town.� The villagers would be soundly asleep, under
their covers, warding off the damp chill.

��� ���But tonight was different.� The fires along the walls were extinguished
so as not to blind the night vision of the sentries.� The castle gates were up and barred and the
servants and guards were all turned out.�
The village watch went from door to door waking every family and calling
out those of the levy.� The household was
in an uproar and no one really knew why....except for a few in the master�s
tower.

������ �So who was this queen bitch?� Jack
asked.

������ �Lady Cora Golwyn.� Axel answered. �Your
woman in black.�

������ �The Countess of Sharford .� Lady
Lynette supplied like Jack was supposed to know what the hell she was talking
about.

������ Axel saw his confusion and drew him over
to the map table where a local scroll was laid out. �Here.� A large tract of land and holdings about
seventy leagues to our south.�

������ �Oh.� Jack said.

����� �I should have known from your
description, my lord.� Mistress Roslyn lamented. �She adopted the sigil of a
silver scorpion on a red and black field after her husband died mysteriously
not long after their marriage.� It has
always been said she put scorpions on him in her own wedding bed.�

����� �Well that makes sense.�

����� �Indeed, my lord.�

����� �So if she is gone and she lives so far
away, why all the extra precautions?� Jack demanded.� The guards at many of the doors and gates had
been doubled.� The echoing footfalls of
people resounded everywhere.� The place
was alive with activity.

������ �Ayla supplied us with much information
about the Countess of Sharford.� Axel told him.

������ �For instance?�

������ �For instance,� Axel rejoined. �The
countess has made a bargain with someone who wants you dead.�

������ �Me? Dead?� No kidding.� 

������ �Precisely...though who and to what
purpose we do not know.� Neither does
Ayla apparently.� She only knows she was
sent here with her companion and the countess to take you with womanly guile
and force you to enable the failsafe as quickly as possible.�

������ �Well, I could have told you that.� Jack
said sarcastically. �Anything else?�

������ �That she may be marshalling her forces
and preparing to march on us.�

������ Jack was dumbfounded. �Huh?�

����� Axel clued him in. �It would seem that the
countess, after having failed at her clandestine approach to kill you could now
be trying a more conventional method.�

����� Jack shrank down to his chair.� His head fell into the palms of his hands.
This was just a never ending nightmare.�
At one point Jack had wanted nothing more than to stay in this fantastic
computer world.� That had been his first
five minutes here.� Now he wanted nothing
more than to go home.� He had been here a
week and already there was another attempt on his life brewing.� Things were so much simpler in the real
world.� He wished Future_Line had their
free giveaway stuck up their asses sideways.

����� �Any idea if what Ayla told you is even
true?� Jack said, grasping at straws. �The girl would have told you anything to
stop what was being done to her.�

����� �True.� Axel agreed. �But there is a way
we may know for certain.� Sir Jeremy�s
scouts are already well on their way to the River Nyder.� It is the border between Golwyn and Dullman
lands.�

����� �It could take days for scouts to get
back.� He whined. �What are we supposed to do around her until then?�

����� �Prepare for the worst.� Sir Alwyn told
him. �The Scorpion, if she comes, will be a hard match for anything we may put
in her way.�

����� �Maybe we could talk to her...try and work
things out.�

����� Axel smiled, as a father would to a child.
�Jack, my dear friend, this is deadly serious.�
If they come then they are coming for you.�

����� �Yeah, but....�

����� �If she comes for you then she will settle
for nothing less than your capture.� And
if you think what was done to you before was harsh....then you have no idea
what suffering truly is.�

����� �I don�t know.�� He said, suddenly remembering the smell of
his own flesh cooking over a fire. �I think I have a pretty good idea.�

����� �Do you?� Axel asked, suddenly harsh.� �You think you may escape whatever fate
awaits you because you have your safe words?�
Instant suicide once the going gets too hard?� Suppose the words don�t work.� We really don�t know if they do.� So many other things have gone wrong that I
cannot say.� Then you will be trapped
here and you will be completely at the Countess�s mercy.� I wonder how long she could keep you
alive?...a few months perhaps?� A year or
more?� You heal so quickly.� Do you understand if you are captured you
face what we did to Ayla only ten times worse?�

����� Jack exhaled sharply, and ran a hand
across the top of his bald head.� 

����� �I didn�t think like that.� He said
apologetically, but his companion was not finished.

����� �And what do you think will happen to
them?� Axel pointed to the others in the room, Lady Lynette, Lady Jane, Sir
Jeremy, Sir Alwyn, Sir Robin, Mistress Roslyn and Ktari.� �They are risking their lives too...and for
all I know I may be as well.� 

����� Jack shrugged. �What do you mean by
�risking their lives�?� They�re all
computer programs.�

����� Axel�s mouth nearly dropped open.

����� �Computer programs?� Axel repeated
finally. �Do I seem real to you?�

����� �Well yeah.� Jack said dejectedly.

����� Axel pointed to the others who stood
around uncomfortably silent. �And how about them?� Do they seem real enough for you?�

����� He nodded reluctantly.� 

������ �Let me tell you something you may not
know.� Each one of them is a sentient
program like me.� They eat and sleep and
reproduce, feel pain and pleasure, are happy and sad.� These computer worlds were built to be as
authentic as possible and in this world we are just as real as any human.� After witnessing what we did to Ayla is there
any doubt still left in you.�

������ After a moment�s silence Jack cleared
his throat.� �Hey, I�m sorry, Axel.�

������ �Then wake up.� This is life and death for the lot of us.�

����� �My fault, big guy.� Jack consoled. �I
should have known better.�

����� �Yes, you should have.� Axel told him,
rubbing it in. �But things could be much worse.�

����� Jack snorted as the tension eased a bit.
�And just how is that?�

����� �At least we were given some warning.� Axel
reminded him. �If Ayla�s information is right and the Scorpion is on the move,
had we not questioned our young captive then the first we would have known of
it would have been when the van of her army came thundering up the south road.�

����� �What would we have done?�

����� �Nothing,� Axel answered simply.� �It would have been too late.�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

����� 

&nbsp;

������ That night Jack could not sleep.� About midnight a light rain began to fall and
the temperature dropped causing a damp mist to form along the ground.� Jack stood at one of his bedroom windows and
watched it roll and billow and creep through the streets of Hargate as his mind
wandered.� There was so much going on he
couldn�t comprehend it all.� Imminent
death approaching from every turn.� The
lives of people he was starting to think of as his friends, especially Axel,
hanging in the balance.� It was all too
much to deal with.� So much to
grasp.� His mind refused to work.� He tried to concentrate on the problem but he
kept drawing a blank.

����� �Time to take a walk, I think.� He
muttered to himself and headed straight for the door.

&nbsp;

����� 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

������ The heavy door opened with a squeal of
rusted hinges.� The guard stepped in with
his guttering candle and held it forth so Jack could see where he was going.� He eyed the cold stone walls warily, the
flickering light providing little comfort and even less warmth.

����� �There, my lord.� The man pointed.
�Against the back wall.�

����� Jack took the candle. �Thanks, man.�

����� The guardsman bowed. �My lord is too
kind.�� And he was off.

����� The cell was as damp and cool as the
outside and despite the clothing he wore he shivered.� 

����� �So you�ve come back.� A frail voice
called out to him, still, after everything that had happened, taunting in its
tone. �Going to finish the job?�

����� Jack held the candle out until the light
hit her.� Ayla winced at the brightness.

����� She was laying in the floor, curled up on
her side in an effort to keep warm.� Her
arms were pinned back behind her in a leather arm binder, her ankles chained to
a large ring in the floor.� Her naked
body had been whipped bloody, her shoulders were dislocated, and her eyes
betrayed a person dealing with constant pain.

����� �Go ahead...I won�t stop you.�

����� �I ya...I came down here to ask you some
questions.� Jack said.

����� Ayla managed a lame smile though she did
not move a muscle. �More questions?�
Haven�t I already told your people everything they wish to know.�

����� �Maybe.�
Maybe not.� Jack told her. �There are things I wanna know and right now
you are the only one who can tell me.�

����� �Why should I say anything to you?�

����� �Because your answers will decide exactly
what happens to you.� Jack explained.

����� �I am a dead woman anyway.� It makes no difference to me.�

����� �Oh I don�t know.� There seems to be a lot of really horrible
ways to die in this world.�

����� This time Ayla managed a laugh, but it was
cut short as it seized into a caugh which racked her already agony filled
body.� She groaned and made a soft cry
out, almost like the mewl of a wounded animal.�
A tear caught in the candle light but there was no sob with it.� Jack thought about brushing it away but
thought better of it.

����� �If you have come to threaten me, you
should find someone else.�

����� �No threats...just answers.�

����� Her eyes looked up to where he stood and
stared for a moment.� She fought through
the pain and focused on him silently.� It
was as much an unspoken consent as he was going to get.

����� �Who sent you?� 

����� �The Countess of Sharford.� I was in her employ.�

����� �How did you get into the castle?�

����� �The same way we got out.�

����� �But you three were waiting from the very
moment I got here.�

����� �Yes.� She answered.

����� �How?�
How did you know I was coming?� 

����� �I don�t know.� I only know we left from Nordale more than
two weeks ago.� We stayed in Hargate
Village until the Countess said you were about to arrive and then we made our
way into the tunnels and prepared while she went to bring you to us...like a
spider enticing a fly into its web.�

����� �You said us.� You mean you and the other girl?� Varisa?�

����� �Yes.�
Varisa.�

������ �Why did you want me to say the safe
words and activate the emergency failsafe?�

����� �So you would die.� The Countess said you would die if you said
the words.� She answered that one just as she had done with the others.� She did not flinch as she told him.

����� �Why did you want me dead?�

����� �So we could collect on our reward.�� 

����� �What was the reward?� Jack asked,
shifting uncomfortable as the answers became more and more personal.

����� �A gift beyond imagining.�

����� �That doesn�t tell me much.� He commented.

����� �It wasn�t meant to.�

����� �Who is the Countess working with?�

����� �I don�t know.� That is a question you must ask her when she
gets here.�

����� �Is she really coming back with an army?�

����� �I suppose so.� She said coyly.� �It was her plan to do so if we failed.�

����� He shook his head. �Why didn�t you just
finish me off the moment you had the chance?�

����� Ayla smiled. �The countess wanted to play
with you for a while.� She found you fat
and amusing.� She watched in the darkness
for all of your punishment while...well I think I have said enough.�

����� �One more question.�

����� �Enough questions.� Ayla mumbled. �Leave
me be.�

����� �One more,� Jack demanded. �What would you
do if you had a second chance?�

����� Her brown eyes made contact with his. �I
would have brought out the hot coals first.� She said without hesitation.� �I would have gagged you so you couldn�t end
your suffering and pushed the fire between your legs and let your cock and
balls roast.� Then I would have made love
to my darling Varisa while you screamed.�

����� Jack started to feel queasy.� 

����� �You don�t remember, do you.� You screamed so prettily....just as your
friends soon will.� 

����� That did it.� Those last six words.� He stood there for a moment watching her and
despite the pain coursing through her she managed a wicked smile.� It was the same wicked smile she had given
him after she kicked the brazier between his spread legs.

����� Finally, Jack nodded. 

����� �Thank you.� He said. �You�ve been a big
help.�

����� And he turned and left.� 

����� 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

����� By the next morning the rain had stopped,
the clouds were gone and the sun was burning away the last vestiges of fog that
still clung to the land.� Jack went down
into the courtyard, his guards scurrying behind him, and found Axel talking
with Sir Alwyn while a scattering of knights and squires huddled around.� At a distance he called to him.� �Hey, big guy, can I see you for a sec?�

����� Axel looked up, gave a brief
acknowledgement to the Master of Foot, and came over.

����� �Yes, Jack?� I�m a bit busy.� May I help you with something?�

����� �Actually I was wondering if I could help
you?�

����� Axel gave him a curious expression. �I
don�t know.� I�m just a computer
program.�

����� Jack chuckled.� �Okay...I know at times I�ve been an ass so
far.� But I did some soul searching last
night and I think I can help.�

����� �In what way?�

����� �Well, for one thing, you seem to be
taking all this on your own shoulders and that�s not fair.� This is my fantasy, I should be doing
something too.�

����� Axel nodded.� �Ideally, yes, but let us be frank.� I am responsible for you and your safety
while a part of this program.� If I were
you I would try and not worry about it so much.�

����� �Not worry?� Jack responded incredulously.
�If psycho bitch is headed this way then its because of me and she won�t be
satisfied until I am dead and gone.� That
puts everyone that helps me in danger.�
That means you too, my friend.�

����� �Yes, but...�

����� �So I�m supposed to sit up in my tower and
wait for my best pal to rescue me?� I
don�t think so.�

����� �Just how can you help then?�

����� �Well, actually I need something from you
first.�

����� Axel arched his eyebrows in an unspoken
question.� Jack smiled sheepishly.� �I need someone to help me train.�

����� �Train?�

����� Jack slumped, looking both ways to make
sure no one would hear him.� �Axel, I�m a
janitor.� I clean floors for a
living.� I don�t know how to fight with a
sword, I don�t know how to shoot an arrow....I�m damn near helpless if you
think about it.�

����� Axel frowned. �Wait..a janitor?� You�re bio-file said you were a maintenance
engineer at a prominent local university.�

����� �Yeah,� Jack answered.� �What do you think a janitor is?� Look, bottom line is that I need some help
and soon you will need every able bodied person you can get.� I know you�re getting ready for war here, but
can you spare somebody?�

����� He stood there, brow furrowed in
concentration. �I tell you Jack, I can�t think of anyone.� Everyone is busy with something...Lady Jane
and Mistress Roslyn with the castle, Sir Robin with the armories, Sir Alwyn
with organizing the levy....�

����� Jack threw his hands up. �Except me.� I�m not doing a damn thing but sitting around
waiting to die.� I�ve tried talking with
these idiots.� Jack pointed out his guards with a sweeping gesture. �But
they�re so busy guarding me I can�t learn a damn thing.�

����� �Well there is someone...� Axel explained.

����� He jumped at it. �Who?� I�ll take anybody.�

����� �Well Ktari is available.�

����� �Aw, come on!� Nibblet?� Jack said. �She couldn�t hit her
ass with both hands much less teach me how to defend myself.�

����� Axel shrugged. �Jack, what do you want
from me?� We are preparing for a fight to
the death.� I can�t spare anyone else.�

����� �I�ll tell you what.� Throw in her sister for at least a few hours
a day and I�ll promise to stay out of your hair.� He suggested.

����� �Very well, Jack, you drive a hard
bargain.�

����� �Same to ya.� Jack said as he shook hands
on the deal.� �Well, I gotta go track
down Ktari so...�

����� �Good luck.� Axel told him.

����� �Yeah, Axel.� Peace and hair grease, pal.�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

����� Jack tracked down Ktari, and willingly or
not, she began his first lessons in the art of self defense.� She was a squire and thus a potential knight
in training.� Unfortunately he soon found
out that Ktari had a better grasp of books and songs than swordplay.� She knew the histories and lineages of all
the great lords and ladies of the land, she could sing any song he wished to
hear as long as it was not too bawdy, and Jack was surprised to find that the
little thing had a powerful set of lungs on her.� She even rode better than he did, which was not
a shocker.� So he studied with her every
day from sunup to sundown and beyond with the occasional riding lesson thrown
in from time to time.� But Jack was just
as interested in learning how to fight.�
His life might soon depend on what he learned.� And knowing the things that might await him
if captured spurred on his determination to fight it out...even if it was to
the bitter end.

����� That was where Lady Lynette came in.� 

����� For three special hours a day the
redheaded guard captain kicked the Master of Hargate�s overweight ass up one
side of the training arena and back down the other.� Even though they were using practice wooden
swords, Jack went back to his studies with Ktari every day with countless
bruises and scrapes which, by the time he got up the next morning, had healed. 

����� If only his ego healed as quickly as his
physical wounds he would have been fine.

������ 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

������ Jack sat up, pulled off his iron cage
practice helmet, and brushed the sand from his coat.� The heavy leather was thickly padded to avoid
serious sparring injuries but the pain of every strike she had landed pulsed
angrily.� He laid the wooden sword at his
side and slowly picked himself off of the ground, purposely ignoring the
worried attentions of Lady Lynette.� �Oh
dear, I didn�t mean to!� My lord, are you
alright?�

����� He nodded and held up a hand, silently
smarting in pain.� �I�m fine, Lynn.� I�m just tired of getting knocked down.� How many times have I hit the dirt
today?� Fifteen?� Sixteen?�

����� �Thirty one, my lord!�� Ktari yelled out happily from her vantage
point on the lip of the arena pit.� She
had gotten better with the stuttering speech and he was actually beginning to
warm up to the child as she came out of her shell around him and began to show
the true imp that she was.� 

����� �What?� Jack focused on her and called
back playfully.� �Keeping score now,
Nibblet?� Shouldn�t you be off doing
something official, like polishing my armor?�
Yeah, that�s right!� Run
along!� Go empty a chamber pot!�

����� Jack turned back to his tutor. �Your
sister is a little shit sometimes.� You
know that?�

����� �My lord, if you wish to replace her...�
Lynette stammered.

����� �No.�
I was just kidding.� She�s
actually not that bad when you get down to it.�
She�s certainly been helping me out with some stuff. I....�

����� �My lord!� 

����� A messenger with a blue and gold sash
across his chest came running out onto the arena floor.� He stopped and knelt before them, his head
bowed as he spoke. �Sir Axel�s compliments, my lord.� He has called the council in your private
chambers.� He bids me inform you that the
scouts have returned from the south.�

����� Jack looked to Lynette and without another
word they were both heading out of the sand pit, shedding their heavy
coats.� Ten minutes later Jack came into
his chambers with Lady Lynette directly behind him.

������ �So what�s up?� Can somebody fix me a drink?� I might need it before this is over.�

������ �We may all need one before this is
over.� Axel replied somberly.

������ Ktari had already poured a cup of honey
ale and handed it off to him as he approached the map table on the lower level
of the main room.� Sir Alwyn and Sir
Jeremy were there as well.

������ �That bad, huh?� Jack asked after
gulping down half the cup.

������ �Well it�s certainly not good.� Axel
said.� Across the table was a parchment map
already laid out and held down by weights at its four corners.� Jack studied it for a brief moment.� There was a dense forest in the center with a
mountain range to the north and a wide plain to the east.� A long river ran from the mountains down the
length of the plain and hooked to the west to run parallel, and in some cases,
butt up against the edge of the forest.�
He immediately recognized it.� 

������ �Our scouts have confirmed what the girl
Ayla told us.� The Scorpion has not only
called together an army but they are already on the move.� They have crossed the Nyder here,� Axel
pointed. �, and are fast approaching the village of Raven�s Forge from the
south.�

������ �How many?�

������ �Seventeen hundred foot and near a
thousand horse.�

������ �What about us?� Jack asked. �What do we
have now?�

������ �The levy is nearly complete.� Sir Alwyn
supplied. �We�ve twelve hundred infantry.�

������ �And eight hundred cavalry.� Sir Jeremy
interjected. 

������ Jack whistled.� This was going to get real nasty. �So what do
we do now?� 

����� �We do not dare risk open battle, my
lord.� Sir Alwyn told him.� �We are
outnumbered and with few options.� I feel
we should stay and strengthen the castle for siege.�

����� �Nay, sir.� Sir Jeremy retorted hotly. �We
should go forth and offer battle.� A
siege here would be a disaster.� It is
spring at Hargate and we have not the food to last a month after so long a
winter.�

����� Jack turned to his friend. �Axel?�

����� The blond man nodded. �Both their
arguments hold merit.� The Scorpion has
moved fast so she may not have planned for a long siege.� But on the other hand, if she has, we would
indeed be doomed if we stayed behind these walls.� So after careful consideration I think this
is what we will do.� We shall...�

����� �Who�s closer to Raven�s Forge,� Jack
calmly interrupted. �,us or the �Bitch in Black?��

����� Those around the table glanced at one
another.� Sir Jeremy�s eyes shot over to
Axel then back to him. �The Scorpion, my lord, but only just.�� 

����� �So we could reach the �Forge� first if we
really pushed it?� 

����� Axel shifted uncomfortably but nodded.
�Yes, Jack.� What are you getting at?�

����� �This is what I�m getting at.� He stated
as he pulled a chart from its slot and unrolled it, spreading it out to replace
the one already on the table.� The others
studied the field the new map showed with puzzled expressions.� 

������ Jack smiled as he saw their
confusion.� �While everyone else was off
prepping for the big fight, I was actually stuck in here for the last two weeks
studying maps and reading books and I tell ya, I still may not be able to beat
anybody in single combat but I can damn sure plan a battle.�

������ �Jack,� Axel cajoled. �I understand you
wish to help but perhaps you should leave this to us.�

����� �Look� Jack said with a shrug. �Give me a
few minutes to tell you what I propose and if you still don�t believe in this
then you can go along with your own plans.�
How is that?�

����� There were no objections.

����� Jack laid out his idea over the next five
minutes.

����� �And that�s about it.� Jack finished
proudly as he stabbed a finger in the center of the map. �That�s what I think
we should do.���� 

����� �There was silence around the table.� Axel finally looked up, his eyes surprised.
�Well, I�ll be damned.� He muttered.

����� Jack laughed sharply. �Axel, did you just
curse?�

����� Lady Lynette cleared her throat. �It is
certainly an....audacious plan, my lord.�

����� �Audacious.� Yes.� Sir Alwyn commented. �But perilous
too.� If things go badly then we will be
slaughtered.�

����� �If we lose under any circumstances I fear
we will be slaughtered.� Sir Jeremy said, stroking his pointed beard. �But this
plan just might work, especially if her scouting forces are as thin as my
people tell me they are.�

����� �This may very well work.� Axel agreed,
studying the map closer. �Of course the Scorpion would have to go exactly where
you want her to go.�

����� Jack threw up his hands. �Look at the
terrain.� Where else can they go?�

����� �Is this map even accurate?� Axel asked,
trying to find a point Jack had overlooked. 

����� �It is, my lord.� Lady Lynette answered.
�I was raised in this area.�

����� �See, that�s even better.� Jack offered.
�We have our very own local guide.�

����� Axel exhaled slowly.� His eyes focused on Sir Jeremy in unspoken
question.� The Master of the Horse gazed
back and nodded firmly.� Sir Alwyn was
next and reluctantly he nodded as well.�
Finally came Lady Lynette and she nodded too.

����� �Jack, are you sure about this?� If we lose...�

����� �I know, Axel.� If we lose we�re all dead.� Or worse.�
But we have to do something and this is as good a plan as any.� Do you have a better suggestion?�

����� �I thought I did.�

����� Jack patted his program assistant on the
shoulder.� �If we fail then so be
it.� We tried, right?� But if we win....we can kick the �Bitch in
Black�s� sorry ass all the way back across the River Nyder.�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

����� Lady Cora Golwyn, the Countess of
Sharford, stretched her naked body across her luxurious fur covered bed, and
yanked playfully on the cord attached to the slave�s gold adorned collar.� The young man caught the hint and sank down
as easily as he could while both his hands and elbows remained tied behind
him.� He squirmed briefly and situated
himself between her spread legs, his face moving to her groin.

����� �Oh, yes, Noran.� Lady Cora uttered
breathlessly as the slave�s moist tongue moved straight for her clit. �That
feels ever so good.�

����� Noran was one of her newest acquisitions
and thus she had chosen him to come along on campaign with her specifically so
he could be properly trained...and also because of his tongue.� He was not as well gifted in other
areas.� Her personal slave quarters held
male slaves with longer pricks and more toned bodies.� But Noran was a novelty.� He was the best male she had ever seen with
his tongue.� And what a tongue it
was.� Three inches in length.� Pink and soft as silk.� 

����� Waves of pleasure washed over her and her
fingers entwined in his curly dark hair.�
She moaned as she slowly built toward orgasm but suddenly she pushed him
away roughly. �Not yet, fool, you�re going too fast.� I�m not ready yet.�� 

����� �Yes, mistress.� The slave said and
returned to his work more carefully.

����� There was a call from outside the tent
entrance.� Lady Cora yelled back her
consent between gasps and a slim blonde woman clad in armor came into the tent.

����� �Mistress, the prisoners who begged to
petition you are here.� The blond informed her sourly.� She had not been the same since they had been
forced to leave her companion behind.�
They had neither heard nor seen anything of her for many weeks and
privately Lady Cora thought she was already dead.� If she was, then so be it.� Their mission had been not only extremely
risky but far bolder than anyone would have suspected someone of her stature
and rank to attempt.� But the rewards
would have been worth it had they only succeeded.� They had both known the risks .�� The woman who stood before her would simply
have to get over it.

����� Very well, Varisa.� Lady Cora said as
Noran�s head bobbed in her lap. �Bring them in.�

����� The two prisoners were pushed in by a pair
of guards wearing the black armor of her personal watch.� They were a man and woman, both in their mid
thirties, their hands bound in front of them.�
The man�s clothes were dirt covered, his face streaked with mud.� The woman�s dress was torn, her auburn curls
a tangled mess.� They were but two of a
growing number of refugees which had been taken prisoner as the Golwyn army
advanced toward Raven�s Forge.� They both
sank to their knees in front of the bed, their heads bowed in fear and shock of
what was happening in front of them. 

����� Lady Cora pushed up on her elbows to get a
better view of the pair, watching them intently as Noran continued to pleasure
her.� 

����� Finally she said angrily. �Well, does one
of you know how to speak?� I must assume
you have disturbed my pleasures for a very good reason.�

����� Both man and woman smarted as if stuck
physically but kept silent. 

����� �Well speak up, damn you!� She yelled.

����� �If it please, Your Ladyship,� The man
spoke shakily without looking up. �, we had thought to come before you with a
plea for our children.�

����� �Your children?� Lady Cora repeated. �What
about them?�

����� �Your Ladyship�s soldiers came to the pen
where we have been kept and took them away this morning.� To where, we do not know.� The woman
said.� She lifted her gaze briefly and
the look in her eyes told of a person nearing hysteria.

����� Lady Cora�s brows furrowed. �Truly?�

����� �Yes, Your Ladyship.� The man answered.
�They are young and innocent and have done no harm to anyone.�

����� �We beg of you.� The woman started to cry,
her bound hands clasped in front of her ample bosom. �We ask only they be
returned.� We fear for their safety.�

����� �I forget who you are.� We have captured so many prisoners
lately.� How many children do you have?�
Lady Cora asked, fighing to maintain control as the pleasure between her legs
built.

����� �Three girls, Your Ladyship.� The woman
answered frantically. �Please, we meant no harm in comin� here.�

����� �Most unfortunate you were trying to
travel with your entire family at such a time to begin with.� She commented as
she thought. �Varisa, do you remember anything about the children of these
peasants?� 

����� The blond concentrated for a moment then
nodded. �I believe they mean the three young girls who volunteered for service
today.�

����� �Ah, yes.� Lady Cora purred as she fought
back moans of pleasure. �Now I know of who you speak.� I had them brought here so I could give them
their tasks myself.�

����� Both man and woman looked up.� �Y....Your Ladyship,� The man stuttered. �,
we did not know it was done on your orders.�
We thought they had been taken by the guards to....�� He trailed off, leaving his darkest fears
unspoken.

����� �They are safe?� The woman asked.

����� �I am sure my men are taking good care of
them.� Lady Cora told her. �They could not wait to offer their services to my
men.�

����� The woman started to cry what sounded like
tears of joy.� The man was not nearly so
moved.� Immediately he looked more
wary.� 

����� �My lady, we are farming folk.� The man
told her in a pleading voice. �We have very little but whatever we have we will
give for the return of our daughters.�
They are everything to us.�

����� �Really?�

����� �Please.�
We harbor no allegiance to the Lord of Hargate.� We have no quarrel with you.� We place ourselves at your mercy and ask that
you please give our children back to us.�

����� A shudder washed over her. �Ah yes...right
there, right there, Noran.� That�s the
spot.�� After a moment she focused on the
two kneeling before her. �It would seem that your daughters have taken to
serving under my banner.� Why should I
take them away from their duties and simply give them back to you?�

����� By now tears were streaming down the
woman�s face.� �Please, my lady.� We only want our children.�� They are so precious to us.� As a woman, you carry the heart of a mother
as well.� Can you not see your way to
letting them go.� She managed to say between sobs.� 

����� Lady Cora�s eyes turned cold just before
they rolled into the back of her head and her breathing came hard.� Waves of pleasure washed over her as her
muscles tightened and flexed.� �Yes,
Noran, fuck yes!..now!...now!...now!...YESSSSS!�� Her back arched and her breath came out in a
long moan.� 

����� Once it was done she fell back on the
furs, her respiration settled, and her fingers grabbed Noran by his hair.� �Wonderful, my slave.� So good of you.� Remember to take it slowly next time.� 

����� Noran finally came up for air and flicked
his obscenely long tongue at her. �Whatever your pleasure, mistress.�� He was rewarded with a harsh slap across the
face for his brief insolence.

����� ��Get away from me, dog, before I have you
whipped!��� She commanded menacingly and
slowly he slinked backward.� Lady Cora
threw her leg over him and rolled onto her stomach.� She propped her head up on her forearm and
gazed down at the prisoners.� They had
cast their eyes down again so they would not see what was happening on the
bed.� 

����� She asked them.� �When were you captured?�

����� �T..two days ago, Your Ladyship.�

����� �And where were you taken?�

����� �Along the road, Ladyship.�

����� �Why?�
Where were you going?�

����� The two looked up, their eyes growing
wide. �M...my lady, we...we were...�

����� �I shall ask again.� What were poor farm folk doing traveling the
South Road headed toward Raven�s Forge when they should be working on their
lands?�

����� They both tried to utter a nervous answer
at the same time but the Countess held up her hand to silence them.� �Let me venture a guess.� She remarked
coldly. �You were fleeing from me.�
Running as fast as you could to the north and the safety of that great,
fat pigeon at Hargate.� But in your own
stupidity you and your family stumbled into our lines and were taken.�� She looked to Varisa. �Does that about cover
it?�

����� �I should think it does, mistress.�

����� �You thought to come and petition me for
the safe return of your daughters as if you were my own subjects.� But you are nothing more than spoils of war
taken on enemy lands.� I will therefore
use you as such...just as I have done with your daughters.�

����� The woman turned frantic again.� The man was looking trapped.� Lady Cora waved a hand to the guards who
grabbed the hapless couple amid shouts, sobs and protests.� She then told Varisa. �Take these two fools
to the common grounds where I had their daughters pilloried.� Strip the woman and place her next to her
daughters.� I suspect they have been well
used by now and my men will appreciate a fresh set of holes to poke.� Then take the man and have him impaled on a
pike.� Make sure they are facing him so
they may witness him die as they continue servicing the lust of my troops.� 

����� Varisa bowed. �As you command, mistress.�

����� She left the tent amid screams of panic
and horror.� And then there was silence
for a time.� She leaned back onto the
soft, decadent fur covering her bed and nearly drifted off to sleep.

����� �My lady!� The call came from Lorri,
another one of her slaves.� Lorri was a
beautiful brunette with a voluptuous body.�
She, like Noran, had also been selected for the campaign because of a
special talent.� She was Lady Cora�s
personal servant.

������ �What is it, Lorri?� She demanded
irritably.

������ �I was sent by Sir Olric.� She said in a
soft voice.� �He bids me tell you that
the Lord Commander has urgent news and wishes to see you.�

������ Lady Cora sighed heavily. �Very
well.� Get me some cloths.�

������ Lorri quickly came back with a sheer
black sleeping gown.� The countess
stretched her muscles lazily then stood while her servant dressed her in the
simple garb.� Then she took the
Countess�s long black hair and bound it in a quick ponytail.� One final touch was the silver scorpion
necklace she wore every night to sleep.�
She turned briefly to a mirror and once she was satisfied told Lorri to
bring him in.

������ As Lady Cora stretched out along her bed
once again, Sir Ansyl Wellock, the Lord Commander of the Golwyn army entered
into the tent and stood before her.� He
was a tall, strong man, with graying hair at the temples and a full, salt and
pepper beard.� His face was square and
handsome with the faint pucker of a scar across his left check.� He wore the obsidian black armor of personal
Golwyn service with a red cape and silver scrollwork on his breastplate.

������ �Yes, Sir Ansyl, I must assume you have
very important news otherwise you would not be standing in my tent at such an
hour.�

������ �It is indeed, Your Ladyship.� He said
gruffly. �Our scouts have made contact with an army to the north of Raven�s
Forge.� They fly the blue and gold of
Hargate.�� 

������ Lady Cora�s eyes widened in surprise
then she chuckled. �Really?� The pigeon
has found his balls, has he?�

������ �It would seem so, Your Ladyship,� Sir
Ansyl told her. �, he is encamped for the night with a force of what looks to
be near two thousand men.�

������ The countess stopped chuckling.� �How far from the Forge is he?�

������ �Only five leagues, my lady.�

������ Her scouts had informed her the terrain
just to the north of Raven�s Forge offered excellent high ground and easily
defended positions with thick forest close in to either flank.� It was, in essence, a bottleneck.� The first of many in the area.� If the Pigeon of Hargate could reach that
ground before her army he would have a distinct advantage.� That pudgy little shit was closer but if she
could force a march during the night she could probably still beat him to
it.� It was a race now.� One she was determined to win.

����� �Strike the camp,� Lady Cora said
decisively.� �I want our vanguard moving
within the hour.� You shall make for the
heights to the north of the Forge and capture them before that fat pig gets
there even if you have to march all night to do it.� Understood?�

������ �As you wish, Your Ladyship.�

����� �As usual I shall stay here a while
longer.�

������ �Verywell, Your Ladyship.�

������ �Make no mistake, Ansyl,� The countess
said with an icy tone. �, as the Goddess is my witness, tomorrow evening I want
the Pigeon of Hargate brought before me in chains...and before the week is out
he will wish he had never been born.�

����� �Praise be to the Goddess.� Sir Ansyl
said.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

����� 

����� A light rain had been falling for hours
and it looked as if it would continue through his first battle.� Jack had passed the point of being simply
nervous.� Now he was closing in on being
terrified and was probably fast approaching being catatonic.� But Axel was as cool as ever, sitting atop
his horse in his gray armor.� It was both
annoying and re-assuring that someone could be that confident.

����� Jack pulled back on Midnight�s reigns and
stopped at his side.� He had gotten used
to sitting on a horse but what still bothered him was the odd feeling of being
encased in wet cloth and steel.� His
stomach was held in by his breastplate and his posture was held perfectly
straight.� His boots felt funny too.� They were stiff and unforgiving.� His helmet fit a little too tightly for him,
it made him feel claustrophobic, and he had decided he wouldn�t put it on until
it was absolutely necessary.� It all felt
weird to a guy who had usually lounged on a couch all day in sweatpants and a
t-shirt.

����� �So,� Jack whispered to his companion. �Do
you think this is gonna work?�

����� Axel leaned his head over to him, peering
out from under his steel helmet. �It�s a little late to be asking me, don�t you
think?�

����� Jack winced. �Well...maybe.� I�m just worried, I guess.�

����� �It�s too far gone to worry.� Everything will either be fine or it won�t.� We will know soon enough.�

����� Jack looked to the left and the
right.� There was enough morning light
now to unmask the ethereal forms which only moments ago had danced in the dark
mists.� He could make out rows of
horsemen, armor clad and at the ready, standing vigil in complete silence for
as far as the eyes could see in the poor visibility, their blue and gold sashes
worn proudly across their chests.

����� �I think these guys look ready.� Jack
commented.

����� �They are ready.� They are confident.� They are yours.�

����� �Okay so what does that mean?�

����� He nodded to both sides at the lines and
beads of rain water streamed down his helmet.�
He whispered. �These people are not here today because of me.� They are not here because Sir Jeremy and Sir
Alwyn ordered them to be here.� They are
here because of you.�

����� �Me?�

����� �They are more than simple vassels
required to do whatever you order them to.�
Over the weeks you have talked to many of them where one of their own
lords would not have.� You have been kind
to them as many of their own would not be.�
And they have all watched you struggle to learn and adapt.� In many ways they respect that most of
all.� You may be a stranger in a strange
land here but you have fit in main well.�
You are their leader.� You may not
see it but I do.�

����� �Me...a leader?� I�m not a leader, I�m scared shitless.� Jack
chuckled quietly.

����� �So are all of them.� Axel countered.
�They are not blind.� They see the threat
the Scor...�

����� Jack wagged a finger up in front of him.
�Alright, the �Bitch in Black�...they see her threat and understand what it
would mean if she wins this fight.�
Hargate would be destroyed...and their homes and families with it.� They would rather die than let that happen.�

����� For a moment there was an uncomfortable
silence broken only by the faint whinny of a horse.

����� �Axel, there�s something I have to tell
you.�

����� �Yes?�

����� �Whether we win or lose today, despite
everything that has happened...I think its been a pretty good run.� Don�t you?�

����� He saw Axel turn to him and smile. �It�s
only been little more than a month...but yes.�
It has been.�

����� They offered a steel covered hand to one
another and there was a barely audible clank as they shook.� Then it was back to sitting and waiting while
the fog swirled and the rain came down amid the pale dawn.

����� In the distance, along the tree line, a
shape formed in the mist.� It grew in
clarity as it came closer.� It was one of
the scouts on foot.� Jack watched as he
ran up to Lady Lynette and knuckled a salute.�
He spoke briefly then Lady Lynette came over to where he and Axel
waited.� 

����� �The vanguard has passed.� The beautiful
redhead told them.� �The main body is
before us.� Now is the time to strike.�

����� Jack took a deep breath and gave Axel one
last look. �Well, here goes nothing.�

����� �See you on the other side, my friend.� He
responded as he drew his sword.

����� Jack removed his hat quickly and put on
his helmet.� He had a sword but also two
crossbows, holstered on the flanks of his horse, as many of the cavalry
had.� They were light, easily handled
with one hand and even easier to use, though tricky to reload in a fight.� He drew one of them as Lady Lynette and her
guard detachment pulled their swords as well.�
Others followed suit and soon the action was being repeated up and down
the lines.� Then, in a great tide
everyone seemed to move forward to the edge of the forest until there were no
more woods to hide in and the empty ground that marked the South Road seemed to
go on forever.� Bannermen came up and
unfurled their flags, the golden eagles of Hargate rampant on their aquamarine
fields.

����� Swords dropped to point the way forward
and the army began to move out at a walk then a slow trot.� Jack�s frightened eyes searched the mists as
he rode among the others.� As they moved
through the thick fog a long dark shape appeared in front of them which seemed
to be crawling along the road.� The shape
turned into a column of infantry, unarmored and unsuspecting.� Then the shouts arose and many spurred their
horses forward into a full gallop to close the distance in an instant.� The shouts grew in an ever increasing wave
until it hurt his ears.� Jack�s heals dug
into Midnight�s side and the big destrier surged. 

����� It was then that he yelled at the top of
his lungs. �This is so fucked up!�

����� He lowered the crossbow at a surprised
target and pulled the trigger.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

����� There were several factors which helped
determine the Battle of Raven�s Forge, as it became known.� The terrain was one.� The topography to the south of the village
was flat land along the road with large stretches of thick forest nearby for
the attackers to hide in.� Another factor
was the weather.� If it had not been so
poor on that day, as some would say later, then things may have come out
differently.� And yet another factor, and
purely the fault of the Lord Commander, was the lack of any significant scouts
on the flanks of the Countess of Sharford�s forces.� They had been virtually non-existent.� This oversight on his part was perhaps
because he had not suspected an attack or believed one was possible at such a
time and place.� Another reason could
have been that he was in a headlong rush, driven by Lady Cora, to reach and
engage his enemies on ground which would have favored him.� Whatever the case for his failures were,
there would always be speculation about them.�
Sir Ansyl Wellock, the Lord Commander of the Golwyn army was killed in
the opening moments of the battle by a crossbow bolt through the eye.� He was identified later due to his
distinctive armor and facial scar.� With
him lay eight hundred of his men.� Many
were captured, others fled.� With those
who escaped were Lady Cora and her Household Guard.� She had stayed behind at the previous night�s
encampment to watch the torment of her wayward victims.� Once she heard of the disaster that had
befallen her army, she lapsed into a state of shock that remained unbroken
until they crossed the river Nyder and back into Golwyn lands a week
later.� Among those who crossed with her
were Varisa, Noran, Lorri, a half dozen other slaves and only two hundred
soldiers.� The rest were gone.

����� There were many who reviewed the battle
and simply discounted the fact that the plan the Lord of Hargate had come up
with had been brilliant.� Sir Alwyn
Kessel had led a force of only two hundred infantry and barely fifty cavalry to
the north of Raven�s Forge and encamped there, waiting for the enemy scouts to
come, purposely putting up enough tents and keeping enough fires burning at
night for ten times as many.� They had been
the bait which had drawn the forces of the Scorpion in.� Meanwhile, with cold camps and barely fed
soldiers and horses Jack and the greater part of his army had watched for the
right moment in the dense thickets and dark woods bordering on the road to the
south of Raven�s Forge.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

����� Jack sat on the ground beneath the shade
of an oak tree only a stone�s throw from the river.� It was mid spring now and quickly growing hot
in the noon hours so a bit of cool rest was welcome after a long ride.� At least he thought so.� They had ridden hard to reach the Nyder.� Now the horses drank from it and the soldiers
filled their skins along its banks.� They
had all earned their brief rest.� 

������ He took his hat off, dropped it on his
lap and wiped a tunic sleeve across his sweaty brow.� Axel sank down next to him, offering him a
fresh cup of honey ale to wash away the dust from his dry throat. 

����� Wordlessly Jack took the cup and with one
flip drank it all down in a few gulps.�
He handed the cup back.

����� �Feel better now?�

����� Jack smiled. �Not much.� I�m worn out.�
This campaigning shit is harsh.�
How are you holding up?�

����� �I�m doing well as always.� Thank you for asking.�

����� �You�re a sorry bastard, Axel.� The least you could do as my personal program
assistant is have some sympathy exhaustion.�

����� �Not in my programming, I�m afraid.� Axel
retorted smugly.

����� �It figures.� He pulled a parchment from
his waist sash and opened it on the top of his hat.� It was a map of the surrounding area and he
began to study it closely.� Axel watched
him and laughed.

����� �What�s so funny?�

����� �For someone who thinks campaigning is so
harsh, you certainly have become good at it.�

����� The Lord of Hargate leaned back against
the oak�s massive trunk.� He looked
around to the perimeter guards and over to where Lady Lynette and Sir Jeremy
stood in full battle armor talking beneath the blue and gold flag of his
house.� Satisfied there was no one else
around he leaned in close to his companion.�
�You remember I told you I was a janitor at a local university?� He said
softly.

����� �Yes.�

����� �I worked in the History Department.�

����� �Well, that explains something.�

����� �What can I say.� I learned a few things while I was on the
job.�

����� �You learned how to run a campaign?�

����� �Naw.�
Not exactly.� Jack told him. �But I did learn enough to know this is one
fucked up place.�

����� �On that we agree.� Axel said.� �There are many things not right about this
world.�

����� �That�s an understatement.� Look at those poor bastards crossing the
river.�� Jack pointed to the ford not far
from where they sat.

����� The Nyder, due to the spring runoff from
the mountains where it started, was running a little deep but the ford was
still manageable for horses and those on foot.�
It was the same place where Cora Golwyn had fled, heading south with
those few who remained to her.� It was
the place his army would soon cross in pursuit.�
And it was now where a long straggling line of men, women and children,
both old and young, barefoot and disheveled worked their way tentatively
through the waist deep waters.� Some wore
plain shifts of different colors, others simple loincloths.� While a lucky few drew two wheeled carts
others carried small bundles which seemed all they owned in the world and many
carried nothing at all.� 

����� �I don�t remember this being in the
brochure when I picked this damned program.� Jack told him as he watched a
group of cavalry cross to the south bank.�
Most of the refugees shied away from them, running for the nearest cover
or keeping their distance.� Some, a brave
few, flocked to them like vultures with arms reached out for any handouts they
could get.� �Where the hell are they all
coming from?� 

����� �Nordale and the surrounding farms I
should guess.� Axel said. �Our advanced scouts have already reached the town
and have found many peasants left behind while their masters have fled.� 

����� Jack shook his head.� 

������ They started to appear two days
earlier.� Sir Jeremy Ross�s vanguard of
cavalry began coming across first one, then another, then entire groups of
them.� At first Jack had thought they
were simply fleeing from the path of the fighting but they were moving to the
north from Golwyn lands, not south.� Then
he discovered the truth.� They were
trying to escape from Golwyn lands.

����� Jack had taken the time to ask about them
and Lady Lynette answered. �They come across the river to find an easier life
for themselves and their children.� There
are many lords and ladies of the land who are ruthless toward their own
people.� The Countess of Sharford is
one.� It is even rumored she keeps an
unfortunate few in perpetual bondage.�

����� �You mean like tied up?�

����� �No, my lord.� I mean slavery.�

����� Jack had let that go, unsure of what to
make of it.� Later that night, as he went
to his tent, he asked Ktari if she knew anything about the slaves the Countess
was said to keep.� She was sitting on the
ground doing her nightly cleaning when she looked up.� She nodded happily.

����� �It is said she keeps two classes of
slaves.� The lowest wear a plain
collar.� They are the workers and
servants.� And the ones who wear the
collars with the gold bands...� Suddenly she trailed off.  

������ �Yeah?�
What about the ones who wear the gold band?� Jack pressed.

����� �...they are the pleasure slaves, my
lord.� She said finally.

����� He thought about it for a moment.� �Oh!�
You mean the sex slaves.�� Then he
had a sudden wicked idea enter his mind.�
He pictured Lady Lynette Hunter wearing a collar with a gold band and
nothing else, her long, flowing red hair reaching nearly to her full breasts as
she went down onto her knees and....then he saw her sister sitting on the
ground polishing the grime off of his kit, eyes level with his rock solid hard
on.� It had been his first boner since
Ayla had...well...

����� �Talk about an awkward moment to get your
groove back.�

����� �What was that, Jack?�

����� �Oh. Sorry, Axel.� I was just talking to myself.� 

����� �Perhaps you were talking yourself into a
solution for these people.� They are
choking the roads we will have to use to advance and could become a strain on
our resources.�

����� Jack held up his hands and shut his eyes.
�One disaster at a time, please.� 

����� He had no idea how he was going to deal
with the potential flood he was facing.�
But for the time being things would not be as bad as Axel made them
sound.� Odds were the majority of them
had stayed where they lived anyway and were waiting either on him or on the
return of their masters and mistresses.��
It was the safe bet considering the things that could happen to those
who were caught escaping.� 

����� Jack did not know what their punishments
would have been but he had seen firsthand what happened to people who had
unexpectedly fallen into the hands of the Countess.

����� The day after the fight at the Forge they
had come across the campground where the Countess of Sharford had spent the
night before the battle.� His scouts had
found an entire family who had been taken; a father, mother and their three
daughters.� The mother and three
daughters had been stripped naked, bent over at the waist with their heads and
wrists fitted into sets of wooden stocks and their ankles spread wide and tied
to stakes in the hard ground.� It
appeared as if they had died there after having endured rape after rape until
they simply collapsed from exhaustion and were strangled by the cruel
pillories.�� But before they died they
had watched their father and husband as he was impaled on a greased pike and
suspended in mid air in front of them.�
He had ordered them buried on the side of the road.� It was the least he could do.� 

������ But the grisly discovery was not an
aberration.� Day after day they stumbled
across other campsites as they advanced, where pillories had been set into the
ground, and nearby to each of them were freshly dug graves.�� 

����� �We have to press on.� Jack muttered as he
fought with the memory of the young girls� blue faces and violated bodies laid
out on the earth side by side.� He pushed
against the tree and gained his feet.

����� Axel looked up, perplexed.� �I thought you were worn out?� 

����� Jack shrugged as he walked over to his
horse with renewed purpose. �I am....but it doesn�t mean I can rest yet.� We started on this mission because we thought
the �Bitch in Black� was out to get us.�
Now I�m out to get her before she can do any more damage.� She is one evil woman, Axel.�

����� Axel stood, brushing himself off as Jack
climbed up onto Midnight. �You have a long road ahead if you are going after
every evil person in this world.�

����� �Hey man, I�m not trying to change the
world.� Jack said as Midnight pranced and pawed the earth beneath his hooves.
�But I can at least do some good until we can figure out how to get me
home.� And getting rid of her would be a
big start.� Besides, if we get to Nordale
tonight I might actually get to sleep in a real bed again.� If that�s not a good enough reason to keep
moving, I don�t know what is.�� He lifted
a hand in farewell. �See ya there.�� ����� 

������ Jack pulled on the reigns and Midnight
galloped away.� Axel watched as Lady
Lynette and Sir Jeremy mounted and rode with him, ringed by a detachment of
Jack�s personal guards.� Axel shook his
head as they turned down the main road and hit the ford at a steady trot,
crossing to the south bank amid splashing water and scattering refugees.� 

����� �You may well do some good, my
friend.�� He said after Jack shrank out
of view. �I only hope once you are done you will have a home to go back
to.�� He went over to his own horse in
silence, climbed into the saddle and crossed the River Nyder alone.� The invasion of Sharford had begun.

Version 13� 

&nbsp;

By 

&nbsp;

The Gray Man

&nbsp;

Part III

&nbsp;

����� Lady Cora Golwyn, the Countess of
Sharford, known to her enemies as �the Scorpion�, was stunningly beautiful as
she dismounted her horse and approached the gathering.� Her long hair was combed, oiled and braided
into an intricate design.� She wore
leather boots, buff colored linen riding breeches so tight they seemed molded
to her skin, and a short, waist length tunic.�
Her dress, as always, was designed to compliment her figure and distract
those men whom she chose to speak with on anything close to equal terms.� She could feel the attention on her and she
did not mind.� Her appearance placed so
many people off balance.� And being off
balance around a scorpion could be deadly.�


������ With her audience assembled Lady Cora
gave a nod to Varisa.� She, in turn,
motioned for the guards to bring the prisoner forward.� Four of her black armored guards brought
forth a naked man between them.� He was
middle-aged, of medium height and heavy with arms and legs powerfully
built.� His head and face was covered in
dark hair and his green eyes were fixed on the woman who had ordered him
brought there.� Lady Cora was not shy as
she stared back at his hatred.� When she
moved out of his way it was because she was standing on the site where she
wanted him placed, not because of any fear of or deference to the
condemned.��� The man stumbled and nearly
fell but the guards held him firm.� The
Countess stood at his feet as the guards forced the man down onto the ground
and tied him spread eagled to the stakes already pounded into the dense
earth.� The man tried to fight back at
that point but there was very little fight left in him.� Varisa had already used many of her
considerable talents on him and his body showed the evidence of her
treatment.� Soon enough the guards
finished their task and stepped away.�
Lady Cora pondered the man one more time.� He was fairly handsome in a rugged sort of
way and his long, flaccid member and hefty set of balls were impressive.� He had a decent body as well...or at least
before Varisa had taken a set of branding irons and hot pincers to his chest,
abdomen and thighs.� The man winced in
pain as he struggled to pull up the stakes but Lady Cora knew they were too
well placed, too deep for that.� 

����� She faced the group of officers and smiled
icily as she motioned to the man on the ground. �I imagine,� She began. �That
many of you know Sir Bryndin Bayne quite well.� 

����� No one dared say a word lest they end in
his position.

����� The countess continued on wistfully. �I
should think so because Sir Bryndin has served me and even my late husband with
distinction.�� She turned sharply on her
booted heels and stepped around the bound man until she stopped at his head.�� �On many raids Sir Bryndin rode forth and killed
my enemies, stole their treasures, and brought me back those who would make the
choicest slaves and for his service I rewarded him well with lands and servants
and anything a good and loyal vassal would want.� But was it enough for Sir Bryndin?�

����� She shook her head slowly.� Sir Bryndin remained silent.� His jaw was set and his breathing was
heavy.� The cordlike muscles in his body
flexed to the limit his bonds would allow despite his injuries.� He was preparing himself for what was to
come.� 

����� �Once, Sir Bryndin was one of my most
loyal officers, worthy of my highest trust.�
He was even close to becoming Lord Commander of my army instead of Sir
Ansyl.�� She spit the last words as if
they were a curse.� �But now look upon
him.� He lays before you a trait......�

����� �Lies!��
The man screamed.� He had heard
enough. �All lies!� I am no
traitor!�� His eyes focused on the band
of men in front of him, many he had once called friends.� They stood silently watching.� �Do not listen to her!� I withdrew!�
Any of you would have done the same!�
She li...auuuugggppphhhh!�

����� Two of the guards grabbed a handful of
hair and lifted Sir Bryndin�s head into position as Varisa fitted a heavy
leather gag into the man�s mouth and strapped it on.� When they moved away Lady Cora placed a foot
on the man�s shoulder and dug a heel into one of his fresh burn wounds.� The man�s eyes became wide with the pain and
a grunting scream emerged from his throat.�
�I shall thank you not to interrupt me again.� She told him with a sneer
and a final twist to her boot.� 

����� Once she was done she stepped back glaring
at all those around her.� �Did you not
hear him?� He dares to call me a liar
when he has uttered so many lies to us all....such as the lie about
Nordale.� Sir Bryndin was in command there.� He was supposed to hold the town but was
forced to withdraw...or so he said.�� 

������ With an angry jerk of her head she
commanded a scribe to step forward.� The
scribe did so.� He unraveled a scroll and
cleared his throat as he began to speak.�
�Sir Bryndin Bayne, Knight and Officer, formerly in the service of Her
Ladyship, the Countess of Sharford, you have been charged with treason against
your Lady and Mistress, for purposely having subverted and disobeyed her direct
orders to hold the village of Nordale and the surrounding area from enemy
hands.��� Having been accused and
arrested you were put to the question and confessed to abandoning the village
without a fight and attempting to flee back to your home.� After being given a fair trial in all manners
of the law you have been found guilty.�

������ Sir Bryndin shook his head violently,
claiming his innocence from behind his gag.�
The scribe continued reading, oblivious to the outburst.

����� �And so, as is the law of the land, the
sentence for treason is death.� The
sentence shall be carried out at Her Ladyship, the Countess of Sharford�s
discretion and in the manner of her choosing.�

����� The scribe bowed gracefully and was
gone.��� 

����� Lady Cora stood at Sir Bryndin�s head and
purposely stood on his hair so he could not lift his head from the ground.� She looked down at him, her eyes filled with
evil intent.� �And so how does one best
kill a traitor?�� She asked him.� His only answer was a wild grunt of anger and
frustration.� She quickly lifted her gaze
to the others. �Hmmm?� Sir Olric?� Do you know?��
That worthy shook his head in silence.�
�No?� How about you, Sir
Marin?� Do you know?�� Again no answer came.

����� Lady Cora sighed.� �Well, if no one knows, I shall tell you.�
Her eyes turned to glaciers as they watched. �You kill them as slowly as you
can......Varisa?�

����� Varisa came forward and Lady Cora turned
her attention to Sir Bryndin.� �I have
contemplated your fate ever since Nordale fell.�
I ordered you to stay and fight but you ran instead, saving your own
skin.� Your actions have eaten away at me
for some time but soon the tables will turn.�
It is you who will be eaten.� Let
me tell you of your predicament.� You
have been staked out near a fire mite mound.�
I shall have your wounds and...oh yes...your privates covered in sweet
oil.�� Sir Bryndin�s eyes widened and the
first traces of fear wear apparent.� It
was like a fresh breeze to the countess.�
�Ah, yes.� You understand, don�t
you?� You must have seen fire mites when
stimulated with sweet oil.� The bite of
one or two is horrid.�� She paused then
for ultimate effect. �But shortly you will be covered with hundreds.�� Servants with jars of oil knelt at the
condemned man�s side and began to rub handfuls of the sticky fluid onto his
body at Varisa�s direction.� 

������ �You shall die here, Sir Bryndin.� You shall die in agony as you are de-fleshed
one layer at a time.� And what�s more,
you shall remain here as a lesson to others who doubt if they should obey my
commands.� But have no fear.� I would have you know that your wife and son,
who you were so desperate to get back to, are safely in my care, awaiting my
pleasure in the dungeon of Sharford Castle.�
Perhaps I shall pay the soon-to-be widow and that strapping young
bastard of yours a visit to offer my condolences on your demise.�� 

����� Sir Bryndin�s eyes bulged in horror.� He screamed into his gag and struggled in
vain against his bonds.� The servants
soon moved away leaving tendrils of oil on the sandy soil as paths for the fire
mites to follow.� 

����� Lady Cora went over to where the group of
officers stood in hushed silence.�
�Remember what has happened here today.� She told them.� �Tell your men to remember as well.� Such will be the end for any who fail
me.� You may go....all accept you, Sir
Olric.� I shall have a word with my new
Lord Commander.� 

����� The group of officers, some with faces as
pale as death, scattered as quickly as they could.� Sir Olric Dunsan waited patiently, showing no
sign of his feelings and paying no attention to Sir Bryndin writhing and
screaming into his gag.�� 

����� Lady Cora grabbed him gently by the arm
and guided him away from the horrible scene.�
�Sir Olric, I must return to the castle soon but I wanted to speak with
you about how matters are progressing.�

����� Sir Olric dropped his voice so no one else
could hear.� �You ladyship, I feel I must
tell you in all honesty we are in a bad way.�

����� �Really?�
How bad?�

����� Sir Olric came on guard as soon as she
spoke.� It was sometimes dangerous to
tell the countess the truth.� In her best
mood she could be accepting.� But after
the past few weeks, Sir Olric just didn�t know.�
However, he surmised, if she found out he had lied or not told her the
complete truth....he could end up next to Sir Bryndin.� It sent a shiver down his spine to think of
it.

����� �Ladyship, the enemy has taken near half
of your lands and is twenty leagues away from Sharford as we speak.� Only three day�s hard march.�

������ �What of the army?� She asked with a
hint of a cold smile.� 

������ Sir Olric nodded.� �We have managed to put together a small
force.� But those we have are little more
than boys in plate and mail.� Too many
good men were lost in the Western Wood.�
They were the hardened veterans of countless raids and other actions.�

������ �Do you have any plans?�

����� ��My
first thought would have been to fall back on the castle and wait the enemy out
from behind the safety of its stone walls.� He commented hopefully but she
shook her head.

����� ��You know well I have forbidden such a
course.� She told him sourly. �I will not be trapped behind Sharford�s walls
while this fat toad roams freely throughout my lands.� I demand you offer open battle.�

������ �Then, your ladyship, we find ourselves
in a position,� He expressed himself with brutal honesty. �, where we cannot maneuver
without opening up the castle to assault and we cannot attack for we do not
have enough men and it would surely fail.�
Lord Dullman will strike soon.� He
has moved fast so far and there is no reason to think he will stop.� I fear our only hope is to fight him to a
standstill.� If we can keep him at bay
then this could well last into the summer.�
By then the vast resources of Sharford will begin to show.� Our numbers will grow while his will
decline.� He will tire of this war and
could very well take an offering of peace.�
But above all, no matter what happens, we must keep the army together.�

������ Lady Cora�s dark mood eased a bit as she
ran a hand down the front of his breastplate. �If that is what you think is the
wisest course.� For years you have served
me well as the captain of my guard.� I
trust your judgment to be sound.�

������ Sir Olric bowed. �I shall do my best,
your ladyship.�� What else could he say?

������ �Of that I have no doubt.� The countess
said. �But even so I have some plans of my own.�
I should think they will work quite well.�

������ Lady Cora looked over her shoulder where
Varisa stood sullenly in plain dark breaches, tunic and breastplate.� She motioned for her to come over.

������ �I am sure you know of my dear Varisa.�
Lady Cora purred as the woman approached, her sword swinging at her hip, her
long golden ponytail bobbing.� 

����� �Of course, ladyship.�� He did not mention he had not been able to
stomach her presence ever since her and that other woman, Ayla, had come to the
castle.� At least the other one was gone.


����� �She carries with her a set of orders,
Sir Olric.� She will accompany you on
campaign to make sure they are followed to the letter.�

����� The lord commander nodded with barely
concealed apprehension. �As you wish, your ladyship.�

����� Lady Cora reached up to run the back of
her hand gently across his cheek.� �I
must leave now but my prayers go with you.�
Be sure you do not fail me as others have done.�� 

����� The black haired beauty bit her lower lip
softly and left, giving one final glance at Sir Bryndin Bayne.

����� He screamed and thrashed about as the
first tiny insects swarmed over his oil covered skin.� Not far from where he lay a post had been
set.� A plaque covered in large white
letters was nailed to the top.

����� It had a simple message.�� 

����� HERE LIES A TRAITOR

����� 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

����� Sharford village had never been the
happiest of places.� In the best of times
it was a dreary, overcrowded warren within the shadow of Sharford Castle, the
seat of power for the region.� With an
invading force so near, the town was a ghostly ruin.� The sun bleached wood and plaster homes were
empty or shuttered.� The markets and
shops closed.� Many were gone, pressed
into service or fled.� Those who stayed
remained locked in their homes.� There
were few who milled about.� Only the
dregs who begged any passersby for whatever handout they could get.� Lady Cora paid them no mind as they cantered
down the eerily desolate cobblestone street toward the castle�s central
gate.� The trip back from the camp had
been quiet.� Sir Aiden Thorne, her new
captain of the guard, did not wish to speak or draw attention to himself.� He rode silently beside her, never once looking
in her direction.� Her mood could change
so quickly and he had yet to find any rhyme or reason to the shifts.� If she had needed him she could have
called...which she didn�t.� So much the
better.� He did not want to end up like
Sir Bryndin after only a few days on the job.

����� They ran along in column through the
raised gate and into the bailey.� In the
days of not so long ago Sharford Castle had been an armed camp.� A place where no one in their right mind
would have dared to attack.� But there
were so few defenders left.� So many had
died at Raven�s Forge, and despite the training groups being full of recruits,
there weren�t enough to even man the walls in case of a sudden assault. 

����� At the entrance to the main tower stood a
greeting party headed by Sir Jaylin Foster, the Steward of Sharford.� He was a healthy looking man, clean shaven
with solid white hair and the flashing smile of an obedient lackey.� He bowed with a flourish as a black collared
slave ran forward and dropped down on his hands and knees.� Lady Cora slipped down from the horse using
the slave�s back as a stepping stool.� 

����� �Ladyship, I trust your vis....�

����� Sir Jaylin stuttered to a stop as the
countess brushed past him headed into the tower without so much as a word.� He stood up straight and ran behind her,
struggling to catch up.

����� �Your Ladyship!� He called out as she
walked away. �Wait please!�

����� She whirled on him at the door to her
apartments, stopping him cold with a backhand across his face.� �Why am I surrounded by fools?�

����� �Your Ladyship?� Sir Jaylin was aghast as
he skittered to a stop.

����� �Ansyl Wellock was a brute but he was no
fool.� Lady Cora told him.� �He was one
of the few Sharford men I have ever met that was worthy of being called a man.�

����� �But, your ladyship, Sir Ansyl is dead.�

����� She struck him again, this time with the
other hand. �You state the obvious to me as if I did not know.�

����� Sir Jaylin�s eyes widened, then he dropped
to his knees. �Your Ladyship, I did not wish to imply....�

����� Lady Cora waved him off angrily.� �Stop whimpering, you spineless pig!�

����� �My apologies, your ladyship. �I did not mean to anger you.�

����� �Is it any wonder that I am angry?� This was supposed to be over.� The lord of Hargate should be long dead and I
should have received my reward as I was promised.� But instead that fat worm is now threatening
to overwhelm me.� Do you hear, Jaylin?�

����� �Surely not, your ladyship.� The lord commander has an army well placed to
stop the enemy.�

����� �The Lord Commander is a fool with an army
of farmers and street sweeps.� Lady Cora huffed.� �His only plan is to wait and see what �the
pigeon� does and then try to block him until he tires himself out.� He will never hold.� The enemy will be besieging this castle
within the week unless I miss my guess.�

����� She turned and proceeded into her
apartments, shedding her riding gloves while Lorri brought forth a glass of
wine on a silver tray.� Lady Cora downed
it all in a few gulps.� She motioned for
the beautiful young slave to return and demanded another.� Sir Jaylin regained himself and stepped
inside the door.

����� �If your ladyship believes there is no
hope, then perhaps arrangements should be made to leave Sharford Castle and go
elsewhere.�

����� �I did not say there was no hope.� I said Sir Olric is a fool who will never
hold.� But I have other plans.� I trust they will soon come to a successful
conclusion.�

����� �I pray to the Goddess that they will,
your ladyship.�

����� �Do not speak to me of prayer.� Lady Cora
chided after she downed half of the wine Lorri brought to her. �I have prayed
to the Goddess for guidance for weeks to no avail.� The Goddess used to talk to me.� Now when I pray I hear only silence in
return.� So be gone.� Leave me to rest.�

����� �But your ladyship, there is a matter I
must discuss with you.�

����� �I�m listening.�

����� �Lady Trista Bayne begs you to give her an
audience.�

����� Lady Cora�s eyes glinted with a malevolent
playfulness.� �Does she beg?� Really?�

����� �Most pitifully, your ladyship.�

����� �Good.�
Is she unharmed?�

����� �Physically?� Yes, your ladyship.� I had her placed in a cell next to her son,
as you ordered.�

����� �Can she here what is happening to him?�

����� �She can, your ladyship.� And she is most distraught.�

����� The countess tossed her head back and
laughed heartily.� It was the first time
she had done so in a long while.

������ �Lorri, you must remind me to visit the
poor widow when I have a chance.� She told her personal servant after regaining
her composure.

����� �Sir Bryndin is dead?� The steward asked.

����� �No, but he will be soon.� Where is Sir Lanart?�

����� �He is resting in his apartment, your
ladyship.�

������ �Good.� She replied. �Send him my
compliments and bid him dine with me on the evening.� We have much to discuss.�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

����� 

&nbsp;

������ Jack Dullman, former janitor, now Lord
of Hargate, threw back another cup of honey ale and looked to his friend across
the campfire.

����� �I gotta tell ya�, Axel.� This honey ale is some good shit.� If I ever get back I wonder if I could sell
the recipe to this stuff?�

����� �As with every program, it is most likely
a simulation of a real beverage used in your world.� Axel replied
matter-of-factly. �I don�t think it would be legal or ethical for you to try to
sell a recipe to something someone else owns.�

����� �Well shit.� Jack said with a frown. �You
know, big guy, I miss the real world.�

����� �I�m sure you do.�

����� �Now don�t get me wrong.� He quickly
added, mainly for the benefit of the others who were also by the fire as the
sun sank below the horizon. �There are a lot of things about this world that I
really love.� His eyes locked onto Lady Lynette Hunter for a long moment. �Like
peace and quiet.� My old apartment was
near a railroad track and there were freight trains going through my back yard
every couple of hours every damn night.�
Oh yeah, and there�s the air.� No
smog or pollution.� Just crisp and
clean.� And the food?� It�s all awesome.� The roasted chickens and the beefsteaks are
great....but there are a few things I really, really miss.�

����� Axel smiled thinly.� �And pray tell us what they would be?�

����� �Yes, my lord.� Tell us so perhaps we may provide them for
you.� Lady Lynette added earnestly.

����� �Well,� Jack continued. �I haven�t found
anybody who has figured out the concept of pizza and cheeseburgers yet.�

����� �I tried, my lord.� Ktari said as she
refilled his cup. �You had one of those cheese-things only last night.� 

����� �Yeah, I know you did, sweetie.� But somehow I think whoever fixed it didn�t
understand what I meant by ground beef.�
It was a little too...chunky for me.�
Sorry, nibblet.� So anyway....oh
toilet paper.� I almost forgot toilet
paper.� Everyone stared at him as if he were speaking in a foreign language.� And in a certain way, he was.

����� �Television, radio, ranch dressing and hot
wings, but I think we might be able to fix that, and, last but not least, air
conditioning.� It�s getting hotter than a
motherfucker around here.�

����� �Yes.� Sir Alwyn agreed in his typical
short manner. �It has been a hot spring.�

����� �And it will get hotter still.� Axel added
seriously.

����� Jack knew his friend had a point and he
was not talking about the temperature.�
Earlier in the day Sir Jeremy�s scouts had confirmed the rumors they had
been hearing about another Golwyn army gathering to the south to stand in their
way.

����� �It�s the last gasp of a defeated enemy.�
Sir Jeremy Ross offered his opinion when the subject changed. �The Scorpion is
all but beaten and she knows it.� They�ve
barely a thousand men left.� Her lands
are taken.� Her people are broken.� Mark my words, my lord.� They will try to parley.�� He leaned in a little closer over the fire as
if to impart some special secret. �We should take advantage.� Move ahead and attack as soon as
possible.� Hit them now before they can
prepare.�

����� �The Scorpion may be wounded.� Sir Alwyn
Kessel countered. �But a wounded animal is often times the most dangerous.� Perhaps we should hold here, my lord.� Even send out envoys of our own.� What we have done is most unusual among the
great houses.�

����� Axel nodded vigorously. �Sir Alwyn is
right.� Most of the warfare on this scale
is conducted by raids and counter raids.�
A burned village here or there is the worst thing done.� We are on uncharted ground.� If we continue on as we are we may well anger
the other local houses into joining forces against us.�

������ �If this is my lesson in Medieval World
politics, it�s coming at a bad time.�
We�re asshole deep in enemy territory with an army big enough to pull
down the �Bitch in Black� before the week is out and NOW you are worried about
what the neighbors might think?�

������ Axel shrugged. �It is a consideration.�

����� Jack threw up a hand as if swatting a fly
away. �Fuck considerations.� She started
it.� I wonder how many of these other
nobles were almost murdered in their own castles by the woman next door?�

����� There was silence to answer because he had
a point.� Everyone knew it.

����� Finally Axel cleared his throat. �It�s
whatever you decide to do, Jack.� We�re
all with you.�

����� �Do you even remember why we are here,
Axel?�

����� He chuckled. �Of course I do.� Do you?�

����� Jack snorted and rolled his eyes.� �Yeah.�
I remember.� And I think somewhere
down the line we lost focus.�

����� �This is not a game, Jack.� Axel warned.
�There will be serious consequences to whatever we do.� We must be cautious.�

����� �What if this is a game?� Jack countered
as the others around the fire squirmed uncomfortably. �This certainly isn�t the
medieval fuck-fest I was promised when I signed up for this shit.�

����� �Nor is it any gaming program I ever
recall.�

����� �Well, what if we ain�t in the known
database anymore, Toto?�

����� �Jack, I think it highly unlikely...�

����� �Unlikely?� Jack interrupted. �Everything
that�s happened to us for the past three months has been unlikely!� You really wanna know what I think?� I think somewhere along the lines we got
stuck, somehow, someway, in a bastard version of Medieval World.� One that wasn�t listed.� Like...hell...let�s call it Version 13.� How we got into Version 13 I don�t know.� Maybe it�s some sorta� lost program running
on its own.� Maybe it�s a failsafe where
the users get sent if the mainframe goes down.�
I don�t pretend to understand it.�
But whatever it is, it�s all fucked up.�
So now we have to find our way out.�
And the only way I know of doing that is to go forward and see where it
leads us.� Do you have a better idea?�

����� Axel studied his companion for a long
moment. �You have thought about this for a long time, haven�t you?�

����� �What else did I have to do?�

����� The Personal Program Assistant started
counting off on his fingers. �Plan a campaign.�
Fight for your life.� Drink
massive amounts of honey ale....�

����� Jack laughed dryly. �Very funny,
Axel.� You�re getting pretty good with
the jokes.�

����� �....eat too much.� Get your arse knackered by Lady Hunter every
afternoon.....�

����� �Okay!�
Okay!� You made your point.�

����� Axel smiled briefly but stopped teasing
his companion. �Truly I had not considered it in such terms.� Version 13, you say?� I suppose it�s as good an explanation as
any...for now.�

����� �Yeah.�
It�s an idea we can build on.� But
the only way to find out for sure might be to get a hold of this crazy,
psycho-bitch countess and ask her ourselves.� 

����� �Then to do so we must take the castle.�
Axel reasoned. 

����� �My thinking exactly.� Jack said. �We�ve
come too far to slow down or stop, dude.�

����� �Yet caution may still be in order.�

����� Jack raised his hands in resignation.
�I�ll tell ya what, we advance as quick as possible and try to catch this
bitch.� But if we are called to a
truce.....and you all think it�s a good idea.....I�ll agree to talks.� But that�s it.� That�s as far as I�m goin.� No promises.�
If the other lords and ladies get pissed at me for what we�re about to
do then so be it.� I�ll fight them too.�

����� There was iron in his last words and he
saw the spines of those who served him straighten ever so slightly with pride.

����� �Then it�s agreed.� We continue the march on Sharford Castle on
the �morrow.� Axel announced.

����� There was a chorus of affirmation from
around the fire.� The course was settled.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

����� Lady Cora placed the guest�s hand on top
her own and walked with him down the long corridor.� She looked into his eyes with a smile.� �I trust dinner was to your satisfaction, Sir
Lanart?�

����� �As always, your ladyship.� The man
replied.� �All of your dinners are so
well done.� I should think I will not see
a meal of their like until I reach home.�

����� Sir Lanart Brassey was a huge man, over
twenty five stone; almost as big around the waist as he was tall.� His hands were fat with large, sausage-like
fingers, his beard was greasy and his breath smelled of garlic.� The countess knew him to have but two loves.� Food was one of them.� The man had eaten like the cow he was and
nearly drank her cellar dry during his extended stay.

����� �I must compliment you on setting a most
satisfactory table for someone so far from civilization.�

����� She bowed her head, ignoring the insult.
�At such times as these one does the best one can.�

����� �I�m sure it must be horrid.� No theater.�
No court.� Only poor wines to
sample.� He said with a cultured sniff. �I will be sure to tell my brother of
how you suffer out here.� Such a lovely
creature as yourself deserves better.�

����� Lady Cora�s smiled deepened despite her
revulsion at being so close to him. �You are too kind, Sir.�

����� �Nonsense.� Sir Lanart told her. �Silvan
shall know of what is going on here.�

������ �Do you mean the fighting?�

������ The big man nodded. �He shall know of
the heinous acts this Lord Dullman is committing against your people and he
shall be put down and brought to justice.�
I give you my word.�

����� Lady Cora stopped and turned to him.� She placed a hand on her cleavage to steady
her heart, suddenly fawning with emotion. �Oh, may the goddess bless you, Sir
Lanart.� I�ve hoped for someone to answer
my plea for aid.� This Lord Dullman is
evil incarnate.� The things he has
done.....�

����� The countess paused and tried to catch her
breath.

����� �Do not fret, your ladyship.� Sir Lanart
told her, openly concerned. �We shall see this man destroyed soon enough.�

����� �This very night would not be soon enough,
Sir.� She said, sounding as if she were ready to faint.

����� Lanart�s confidence vanished and he
stammered apologetically. �Un...unfortunately it is a long journey back to
Knightsbridge.� It would be still longer
to consult with my brother and return.�

����� �Then there is no hope for me.� Am I to be abandoned to fight alone?� She
asked, a tear forming in her soft blue eyes. 

����� �Nay, your ladyship, but there is scant help
I can offer you for now.� Have matters
truly come to such a sorry state?�

����� Lady Cora started to walk again amid a
swish of skirts.� For the months Sir
Lanart had been a guest at the castle he had been in the dark about almost
every aspect of the conflict between Hargate and Sharford.� Fortunately he was a blind fool and keeping
him miss-informed had not been too difficult.�
But it was now time to come clean.�


����� �I had thought not to worry you, Sir
Lanart, but the situation is desperate at best.�
Lord Dullman is within three days march of the castle and, unless the
Goddess grants us a miracle, we will not be able to stop him.�

����� Sir Lanart was dumbfounded by the
confession. �My dear, I had no idea!�
This is a most grave situation indeed!�

����� �I do not mean to be an unkind host,� She
continued on hesitantly. �, but as it stands, it may be best if you were to
leave the castle and return home as swiftly as possible.� My men still control the roads east...some of
them, at any rate.� But I do not know for
how much longer.� It would seem I cannot
guarantee your safety anymore.�

����� The envoy bristled. �Your ladyship, I
would be remiss if I did not stay and see to your well being.�

����� �No, Sir Lanart.� Please.�
It is so brave of you but I would not have you fall into the hands of
such a fiend as he.� Lady Cora begged. �He would do things, unspeakable things
which...� She stopped to calm herself, again a hand went to her ample chest.

����� Sir Lanart made a poor attempt to hide his
nervousness beneath a blanket of bravado. �I shall not leave you to such a
horrible fate.� Perhaps you will come
with me.� The roads are long and I am
poor company but I believe my brother would be most taken with you.�

����� The countess tuned up to cry, pulling out
a silk cloth to dab at her eyes. �And leave Sharford behind?�

����� �Only for now.� Sir Lanart added quickly.
�My brother is a powerful man.� Once he
hears of how you went to this villain in peace and barely escaped with your
life he will be enraged.� You could
petition him in person.�

����� �I don�t know if I could.� I feel responsible for Ayla�s death.� She was one of His Grace�s favorites, was she
not?�

����� �Indeed she was.� Both Varisa and Ayla have served my family
well.�

����� �Just as Varisa continues to serve me at
your bequest.� Lady Cora said with forced gratitude. �For which I thank you.�

����� �Pity about the girl.� Sir Lanart sniffed.
�Are you sure of her death?�

����� �One can only hope poor Ayla has found
some final release.� She remarked sadly. �I shudder to think what could be
happening to her if she were still alive.�

����� Sir Lanart sighed. �My brother will be
most inconsolable.�

����� �That is why I think it best if you were
to speak for me.� He may focus upon me as
the reason for the girl�s loss.�

����� �Very well.� He answered. �But you should
still come with me.� Events here sound
dreadfully dangerous.� There is much life
and culture to partake at Knightsbridge.�
You would be my guest, under my protection until I have shown my brother
what is happening out here and we can decide on a course of action which will
correct this little problem once and for all.�

����� She turned to him and shuddered with
released emotion. �Truly?� The favor of
the Goddess be upon you, sir.� I have
prayed for weeks to find someone who would help. You have answered those
prayers.� But...but perhaps I should stay
to await the coming battle.� It would be
unseemly of me to flee the castle while my brave men are still fighting in the
field.��� 

����� He smiled yet deep down in his belly there
was a queasiness growing as his own safety hung in the balance. �We shall wait
for word of your coming battle.� If
matters should turn then we will go.�

����� She curtsied to him, a sign of far more
respect than she felt.� But it was
something she had to do.� �You are too
kind by far.�

����� They continued to walk until they reached
the guest rooms set aside for Sir Lanart.

����� �I must rest now, your ladyship,� He told
her before going in. �, but it has been a delightful evening.� I thank you for your hospitality.�

����� Lady Cora nodded with a slight twinkle in
her eye.� �I wish you a good night, Sir
Lanart.� I hope you do not mind but I
have provided you with some entertainment I am sure you will enjoy.�

����� Sir Lanart�s smile grew ever wider.� He opened the door and found a dark haired
youth face down on his bed, bound hand and foot to the four corner posts,
wearing only a golden collar around his neck.�
�Oh my dear.� He muttered, barely able to control himself.

����� �He is yours.� Consider him a gift.� She supplied though she
didn�t even know if he was listening.

����� �Is he broken?� He asked.� His skin appeared smooth except where he had
struggled against his bonds and rubbed his wrists and ankles raw.� And there were several pinkish lines crossing
the two fleshy orbs of his ass, the sign of a caning. 

����� �Nothing that won�t heal.� He has been handled roughly but remains
untouched.� She assured him. �You will find him most pliable.�

����� �Pliable?�
Are you sure?� There can be such
fire and tenacity in one so young.� He told her, salivating.

����� �His slave training was, of a necessity,
short and brutal....but it was complete.�
He will give you no trouble.� You
have my word.�

����� �Thank you, your ladyship.� He bowed his
head to her. �I shall not forget you for this.�

����� Lady Cora began to back out of the
room.� When she got to the door she
stopped and gave the son of Sir Bryndin one final glance. �His name is
Nicholus.� Have joy of him.�� 

����� �Thank you.� I will.� 

����� She closed the door when Sir Lanart began
to remove his cloths.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

����� With the towers of Sharford Castle barely
visible off in the distant haze the two armies met in a large clearing.� A two story wood framed structure loosely
called an inn and a set of crossroads were on the edge of that clearing.� White Tavern was the name of the place.� The Golwyn army, a ragtag force of only eight
hundred infantry and a handful of cavalry, sat over the intersection guarding
the route to Sharford with their lives.�
On the other end of the field, with Axel and Lynette at his side, Jack
watched his own men deploy from a nearby hill.�


������ He was burning up in his armor.� He had put his helmet aside, so he wore the
wide brimmed beige hat he usually preferred.�
The breastplate was heating up and the greaves and shoulder pauldrons
were like ovens.� But even if he was
roasting in the scorching heat he was awestruck by the sight before him.� Sunlight glinted off countless pikes and
spears.� The steel helmets and
breastplates of cavalrymen shown with the brilliance of tiny stars beneath
flapping banners of blue and gold.� A low
but continuous rumble filled the air as his men moved forward; seven hundred
cavalrymen to the left and right of a massive line of heavy infantry.� He had never seen such a display. 

����� He had been in the thick of the fighting
at Raven�s Forge but that had been different.�
He could remember only snippets here and there.� People screaming and being hacked to pieces
or shot with crossbows.� He had only seen
a small section of the field amidst the fog.�
Here he could witness everything.

����� �Those guys over there are so screwed.� He
muttered.

����� �Aptly put.� Axel agreed dryly. �We�ve
have over a two to one numerical superiority with the initiative, training and
experience to boot.�

����� The rumbling stopped.� The army reached its set lines.� Only an eerie quiet hung in the air, accompanied
by the flutter of his banners snapping over his head and the occasional courier
riding back and forth.

����� Lady Lynette observed the lines for a
time.� �I believe we are ready, my
lord.� Sir Alwyn awaits your signal.�

������ Someone on the field yelled out.� It sounded strange as it was carried by the
wind.� A half dozen riders struck out
from the Golwyn army for the center of the field.� Jack noticed each one wore black armor from
head to toe, with one carrying a rectangle of stark white cloth on a pole.� A pair of riders rode out from his own lines
and met them there.

����� �Okay, what�s happening?� Jack asked and
Lady Lynette nodded. 

������ �It is as we suspected. They wish to
talk.�

����� �About what?�

����� �Remember what you said, Jack.� Axel
chided.� He was in full armor as he had
been at Raven�s Forge and the heat didn�t appear to bother him at all. 

����� Jack suddenly felt cornered. �What is that
supposed to mean?� What did I promise?�

����� Lady Hunter refreshed his memory. �I
believe you said you would talk if a truce were called and we all agreed it was
for the best.�

����� Jack shook his head, giving her a
disgusted glance. �Thanks, Lyn.� How
could I forget.�

����� The Hargate men broke off from the group
and returned to their lines while the black clad Sharford men waited.� It wasn�t long before a messenger came up the
hill and informed him of what was going on.

����� �Sir Alwyn Kessel�s compliments, my lord,
but the enemy wishes to parley a truce.�

����� Jack tilted his head over to Axel who
nodded. �At least see what they have to say, Jack.� They may be ready to surrender.�

����� �I agree it is for the best but you must
go well protected.� Lady Lynette added. �Take the Eagle Guards with you, my
lord.�

����� �The Eagle Guards?� Jack asked with
consternation.� �Who the hell are they?�

������ Axel chuckled deep within the recesses
of his helmet and Lynette grinned.� �The
same men who have been guarding you ever since you were rescued...oh sorry, my
lord.� I did not wish to bring back bad
memories.�

����� �No, no, it�s okay.�� The Eagle Guards?�� They were the same annoying bastards who had
followed him around at Hargate Castle like a group of wayward geese and been at
his side during the attack at Raven�s Forge.

������ �If they�ve been protectin� my fat ass
since I got here they deserve a nickname if it�s what they want.�� He sighed heavily.� He had a really weird feeling about
this.� A sudden thought flashed through
his mind.� Maybe he could order the
advance anyway.� Maybe he should order
it.� Crush the enemy before they would
even have a chance to react.� But,
no.� Just as quickly he dismissed the
idea.� They were under a flag of
truce.� The white banner.� It was sacred even in his own world.

������ �Okay.�
Let�s do this.� Get �em ready to
ride, Lyn.�

������ �As you command, my lord.�

����� Jack and Axel, accompanied by eight guards
wearing gold chains with pendants of a rampant eagle around their necks trotted
out to meet those who waited under the flag of truce.� They were joined by Sir Alwyn as they went
out into the empty field.� Jack pulled
back on the reigns and Midnight pranced to a halt fifteen feet away from
them.� The Eagle Guards fanned out behind
him and Axel and the Master-of-Foot came up to his sides.

����� A lone knight walked his horse
forward.� His armor was dinged and dented,
the breastplate embossed with the emblem of a silver scorpion.� A single plumed feather, dyed crimson,
protruded from the back of his helmet.�
He stopped, raised his visor.�
Inside was a face which at one time may have been young, but
responsibility had taken its toll.� Yet
his back was straight and his voice strong.�


����� �I am Sir Olric Dunsan, Lord Commander of
the Golwyn army.� He said to them. �I am here at the order of Her Ladyship, the
Countess of Sharford.� I demand parley by
the rights of warfare as sanctioned by all the great houses of the land.�

����� Jack nodded stiffly. �I�m Jack Dullman,
the Lord of Hargate.� If you wanna talk,
then talk.� Don�t waste my time.�

����� �My lord,� He began, removing his helmet,
revealing a head covered by a silver chain mail hood.� �, it is the wish of the Countess that a
message be delivered to you.�

����� Jack humphed. �And what would she want to
tell me?�

����� �She says that everything which has
happened so far has been a grave mistake.�

����� �I�ll say.� Jack snorted. 

����� �A misunderstanding, if you will.�

����� �I�m listening.�

����� �She says that in many respects Her
Ladyship and you are much alike.� More
alike than you know.� She says she has
merely been a pawn in a much larger game.�
A game you know nothing about.�

����� Jack smiled coldly. �It might surprise her
what I know.�

����� �Did you know it is no accident you are
here?�

����� �Really?�
How did I get here then?� Jack asked, more than a bit curious but trying
to sound as sarcastic as he could.

������ �Perhaps we could arrange another meeting.� You could discuss it with her
personally.� She knows many of the
answers to which you seek.�

������ Jack chuckled. �I don�t think so.� The last meeting we had together didn�t go
too well.�

������ �Yes.�
She told me what happened.� Yet
she still offers you a hand in friendship.� Sir Olric said. �You would refuse
it?� We could end this conflict here and
now.�

����� �What the hell are you talking about?� What did she tell you?�� 

������ �This is not the time or place for
recriminations.� Despite all the offenses
you have given her she is willing to set them aside and offer you peace.�

������ �The offenses I�ve given her?� Jack
snapped. �That bitch tried to kill me!� 

������ Axel�s hand on his arm came too
late.� It was already said.� Sir Olric gritted his teeth and his eyes
narrowed in anger.

����� �My lord, we came to you in good faith
under a flag of truce.� The lord commander exclaimed.� �There was no need to give insult.�

����� �You wanna talk about insult?� Jack
retorted angrily, his blood was starting to boil. �Bite my ass, you prick!� How�s that for a insult?�

����� �Jack!� Axel leaned into him and groaned
underneath his breath. �What are you doing?�

������ Sir Alwyn rode up between the two sides,
his hands raised. �Perhaps we should calm ourselves, my lords.�

����� �I am calm, Al.� Jack snarled. �Now get
your ass back into line!�

����� Sensing the rising tensions, Sir Olric�s
warhorse began to jostle about, whinnying.

����� �Very well, then!� Sir Olric rumbled icily
as he tried to maintain control of the horse and his temper. �If you do not
wish to take the hand of the Countess in friendship then she gives these
demands!� You will disband your army and
leave the lands to the south of the River Nyder!� You will pay the Countess of Sharford the sum
of one hundred thousand crowns for damages done to her holdings and lives
lost!� You will submit yourself to the
justice of a tribunal council formed from lords and ladies of neutral houses
who will determine fault for this war!��
And finally, if found to be guilty by the council you shall renounce all
rights and claims to be lord and master of Hargate!�

����� Jack raised a hand, extended his middle
finger and yelled back at him. �FUCK...YOU!�

����� THUNK!

����� Something hit Jack square in the
breastplate.� He looked down and his eyes
widened.� A crossbow bolt was protruding
from his chest.� He looked around,
surprised.� They were supposed to be
under a flag of truce!� You didn�t shoot
people under a flag of truce!� There was
a scream.� Sir Olric was yelling
something, he couldn�t tell what.� His
ears were ringing and everything was moving in slow motion.� One of the black armored knights was throwing
down a crossbow.� It wasn�t one of the
smaller, one handed types.� This was a
heavy, double handed crossbow with a wooden shoulder stock.� He picked up another and shot Sir Alwyn in
the neck while he fought with a rearing horse.�
He fell backward in a heap, a fountain of blood spurting from his
wound.� Jack saw several other bolts fly
by.� One of his Eagle Guards fell from
his saddle but the others were drawing their own weapons.� People on both sides began to tumble to the
ground.� The black knight drew his sword
and charged at him.� One of the Eagle
Guards placed himself between Jack and the knight.� Steel rang on steel and the Eagle Guard
screamed as the black knight sliced downward into his shoulder shredding armor,
bone and muscle alike.� Jack slumped
forward holding onto Midnight�s neck as a hand came from nowhere and grabbed
the reigns.� 

����� Jack shut his eyes.� He didn�t know what happened next.� He must have blacked out but when he came to
he was staring up at the sky.� He was
lying down but could feel the strange sensation of motion.� Soon he realized he was being carried.� He tried to clutch the bolt in his
chest.� There wasn�t much pain.� More pressure than anything.� He felt if he could just get it out he would
feel better.� Not so tingly.

����� Axel appeared over him as he was put down
on the ground.� Someone was holding his
head.� It was Lady Lynette.� There were tears in her eyes as her hands ran
a cool, damp cloth across his forehead.�
There was a sudden sense of urgency.�
Something they had left undone.�
Then he remembered.

����� �Axel!� He sputtered. �Axel, the battle.�

����� He couldn�t hear what he was saying but he
saw his mouth form the words. �Don�t worry, Jack.�

����� But there was an expression on his
companion�s face he had rarely seen before.�
It was concern, but for what.�
Jack suddenly had the feeling this was not going to be good.� Damn but he wished he was back home. 

����� Someone reached in and pulled the bolt out
of his chest and a wave of white hot pain seared across his torso.� Jack screamed and coughed which sent even
more agony into him.� The cough was wet
and a sticky liquid filled his mouth.� Be
brought a hand up to wipe at his lips.� It
came away bloody.� He was coughing up
blood.� People hovered over him.� Some screaming and yelling, others took off
his armor and tried to hold him.� His
head started to swim and he could feel his body jerk.� A dark haze filled the air and the last thing
he saw was lovely Lynette crying, calling his name.

&nbsp;

����� 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

����� Lady Cora decided she did not like having
her fate in the hands of others.� It was
a helpless feeling, one she did not much care for.� The two armies had met, she knew.� Reports had already reached the castle.� But what was happening was still a
mystery.� She had tried to concentrate on
other things unsuccessfully.� She tried to
read but failed.� She paced the rooms of
her apartments and tried to eat but found she had little appetite.� Even sex with Noran, her favorite slave, had
not taken the edge off her anxiety.� 

����� Finally she gave up and decided it would
be best to burn off her frustrations.�
She dressed in black boots, a black pleated kilt, and a dark gray corset
decorated with intricate gold embroidery.�
Then she went down to the dungeon.

����� Once there she quickly found the person
she wanted to torment.� She picked up a
whip and examined the braided cord leading from the wood and leather
handle.� It was thick yet supple.� Just the thing she had been looking for.� She spun back to her victim, striking at mid
air and was rewarded with the satisfying crack of the steel headed tip.� Lady Trista sobbed behind her teeth but there
was little she could do.� She was tied to
a short stake, only about three feet tall, her elbows were hooked behind iron
pegs on the back side of the square post, her wrists bolted to the sides at her
waist.� Her ankles had been pulled up and
bolted just below her wrists, forcing all of her body weight down onto her throbbing
kneecaps.� Her head had been wrenched
back over the top of the post and leather straps across her chin and forehead
kept it secure, forcing her mouth closed and her eyes to the ceiling.� There were two iron spikes on the front side
of the post, the first sharpened point pressing between her shoulder blades,
the second, and longer of the two, driving into the small of her back.� Her breasts were exposed, her throat
bare.� A thin sheen of sweat covered her
from head to toe.� Her breathing was slow
and shallow.� In such a position every
rise and fall of her chest was agony.

����� The countess layed the cord of the whip
across her breasts and heard her groan in response.� Her skin was smooth and unblemished.� Her perfectly shaped breasts still firm and
perky. �Lady Trista was a beautiful young
woman.� Bryndin Bayne�s second wife.

����� �You poor thing,� Lady Cora said, enticing
a shiver from her victim. �You look positively miserable.� How long have you been bound to the post like
this?� Two days?�

����� She brushed a hand over her forehead
gently.� Trista followed her with
pleading eyes.� They were swollen and red
rimmed, blood shot from lack of sleep.� The
suffering in them was apparent.� She
groaned plaintively and tried to whisper something back.

����� Surprised by the effort, Lady Cora bent
down to her. �Yes, dear.� Is there
something I can get for you?�

����� Through dry, cracked lips she mouthed.
�Wa....water.�

����� Then it dawned on her. �Water?� You haven�t had any water since you were
placed here.� Have you, dear?�

����� Lady Trista�s grunted. �Water, pleeeese.� 

����� The countess nodded to one of the guards
at the cell door.� The guard left but
shortly came back with a ladle full of fresh water.� She took the ladle, had a gulp for herself
then held it above Lady Trista�s head so she could see it clearly.

����� �Is this what you want?� Lady Cora
gestured toward the water bringing it closer and closer to her mouth.

����� The young brunette squirmed.� Her eyes became desperate.� The water was so close to her lips she could
taste it.

����� �Pleeeese!� She begged weakly through
clenched teeth.

����� At the last minute, when the ladle was
only an inch from her, Lady Cora laughed mockingly and pulled it away, pouring
the cool liquid out onto the stone floor. 

����� �Stupid girl.� She gloated. �I�m the same woman
who left your husband to be eaten alive and had your stepson turned into a boy
lover�s sex slave.� Why would you think I
would give you any water?�

����� She bent down to speak directly into her
ear. �You are going to die here.� Didn�t
you know that?� But first I�m going to
whip you raw.�

����� Lady Trista sobbed openly, her eyes
pinched shut.� Lady Cora stepped back to
give herself plenty of room.� She cracked
the whip once more in promise of what was to come.

����� From behind, at the entrance, someone
called with urgency. �Your ladyship!...Your ladyship!�

����� The Countess of Sharford whirled about and
caught sight of Sir Jaylin Foster entering into the chamber, pushing the guards
at the door aside.

����� �Your ladyship, word has arrived from the
lord commander!�� He caught sight of Lady
Trista�s body, naked and twisted, and quickly dropped his gaze to the ground.

����� �What is it?� Lady Cora demanded hotly,
Lady Trista was all but forgotten.

����� �He sent word by courier.� Sir Jaylin
stammered, barely able to keep his composure.�
�There has been a battle at the White Tavern.� The fighting was said to be fierce.�

����� �Yes, yes.�
Go on, imbecile.� The countess pressed eagerly.

����� �There was a truce called, your
ladyship.� Lord Dullman was
there...and...and things were said.� The truce
was broken and Lord Dullman was killed.�

����� Lady Cora�s eyes flashed and a smile
etched itself across her face. �Are you sure, Jaylin?� Is Sir Olric positive?�

����� �The lord commander witnessed the strike
himself.�� Sir Jaylin�s hands shook as he
spoke.� �A bolt hit him in the chest
which went in four fingers deep.�

����� The Countess�s smile slowly began to
recede. �He was not beheaded?�

����� �No, your ladyship.� He was led off of the field before he could
be finished.� But the Lord Commander said
there is very little chance of his survival.�

����� Lady Cora�s face darkened. �The lord
commander is a fool.� As long as there is
life in him, the worm is a threat.� What
of the battle?�

����� The steward was taken aback by his liege�s
abrupt mood swing.� �Your...your ladyship,
perhaps the courier would be the best to ask.�
He was a witness to the day.�

����� She handed her whip to one of the guards
and moved into the central chamber.�
There she waited as Sir Jaylin had the courier brought forward.� He was a man lightly armored and covered in
dust.� On his head was a blood soaked
white bandage.

������ He went to one knee before her.

����� �What did you see happen after the truce?�

����� �Your ladyship, there was much confusion.�
The man drawled amidst heavy breaths.�
�Men began ta� fall from their horses as we watched.� Sir Marin Canmore thought to take advantage
and ordered the line ta� advance.� We
took the enemy unawares and drove �em back.�
The fighting was hard, your ladyship.�
Very hard.� Sir Marin held the
line together until the Lord Commander returned....but there were too many of
�em and we were out in the open.� Their
cavalry scattered ours ta� the four winds and turned on our flanks.� But even so we managed to hold �em off an�
withdraw from the field.�

����� Lady Cora observed the courier with a
callous eye. �So you were defeated.�

����� Her words seemed to confuse the soldier.
�Nay, your ladyship.� Twas� a draw, I�d
say.� The lord commander is retreatin� in
good order t�ward the castle an� the Eagle o� Hargate is all but dead.�

����� She paused, giving the man an evil glance,
then reached out a hand to one of her guards.�
She gestured wordlessly to his crossbow which he handed over in due
course.� �Why do you presume to lecture
me on what a defeat is?� Are you one of
my commanders?�

����� ��Nay, your ladyship.� He answered nervously
watching as she drew back the string and set it.

������ �Are you one of my advisors?�

������ �Nay, your ladyship.� He tried to stand
as Lady Cora took a razor tipped bolt from the guard and loaded the weapon.

������ �Good,� She said. �, then you won�t be
missed.� She raised the crossbow to her shoulder and pulled the trigger.� The bolt struck him in the middle of his
forehead.� The courier went backward with
a grunt to sprawl across the floor.� His
body twitched then was still. 

������ She stood overtop the soldier for a
moment amid the quiet of the chamber.�
Then she calmly handed back the weapon and focused on Sir Jaylin.
�Inform Sir Lanart I will accept his offer of travel to Knightsbridge as his
companion but if we are to leave we must leave within the hour.�

����� The steward was shocked to silence but he
nodded. 

����� �Find Sir Aiden and have him assemble my
guards in the courtyard.� She continued on, resignedly.� �And ready the coaches.� Lorri should have already made certain they
were packed.�

����� �What about this one� One of the guards
asked, pointing into the cell at the helpless Lady Trista.

����� �Leave her as she is.� She replied. �Bar
and seal the door.� Let her cell become
her tomb.�

����� There was one final, whimpering cry as the
door clanged shut but the Countess of Sharford was too troubled to enjoy it. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

����� 

����� Jack woke up covered in sweat.

����� �Okay,� He exclaimed drowsily as he threw
off the blankets. �Which genius decided to wrap me up in wool during a heat
wave?�

����� There was a laugh.� It was full and genuine, tinged with a great
deal of relief.

����� �I think that was Ktari, my lord.� A
familiar voice answered. �How do you feel?�

����� �Like shit.� How do I look?�

����� �You have regained much of your
color.� With any luck you shall be ready
for another lesson with the sword in a few days.� Lady Lynette leaned over him,
dabbing a fresh cloth on his forehead. 

����� Jack opened his eyes and looked at his
surroundings.

����� �Where the hell are we?�

����� �The White Tavern, my lord.� She
explained.

����� �Oh yeah?�
I hope we didn�t pay too much for it.��
The walls were filthy, the sparse furniture barely usable.� The floor was covered in grime.

����� �This is one of the better rooms, my
lord.�

������ His hand reached up to his chest where
the bolt had struck him.� He rubbed it
gently.� It was very sore but much better
than he had expected.� The quick healing
the program provided him was hard to get used to but he was not about to
complain.� By all rights, if he had been
in the real world he would probably be dead.

����� �How long was I out this time?�

����� �The better part of two days.�

����� His eyes widened. �Huh?�

������ Jack tried to get up but the guard
captain stood and pressed down gently on his shoulders. �Wait, my lord, you�ve
not yet fully healed!� You could
re-injure yourself.�

������ She called to one of the men at the
door. �Go find Sir Axel.� Tell him his
lordship has regained consciousness.�� 

������ �Right away, my lady.� The man said
excitedly and was gone.

������ Jack grabbed on to Lynette�s arms.� �What�s happened?� Is everything okay?�

������ She nodded her head and a few strands of
dark red hair spilled out to dangle above his face.� It smelled of jasmine.

������ �All is well.� There was a battle but that is all I will
say.� I shall let Sir Axel explain the
details to you.� 

������ Jack fell back on the feather bed.� He rested a little easier then...until he
realized had an erection fighting to free itself from the sleeping shirt he was
wearing.� Despite the pool of sweat he was
laying in, Jack quickly pulled the covers back up hoping Lynette hadn�t
noticed.� If there had ever been any
doubt of his survival, it was now at an end.

������ Jack and Lynette talked for a few
moments.� Then she left him alone.� Not long after she walked out the door there
was a shimmer in the air and Axel appeared out of nowhere.� He was dressed in full armor, his helmet
under his arm looking almost exactly like the day they had first met. 

����� �Jack nearly jumped out of his own skin. �Fuck!
I forgot you could do that shit!�

������ �Hello, Jack.� He greeted with a broad
smile, extending a hand to his friend. �How do you feel?�

������ Jack took it. �Like I got run over by an
ox cart.� What the fuck happened out
there?�

������ The blond man chuckled, pulling up a
stool and sitting by the bed. �One of Lady Golwyn�s knights shot you while
under a flag of truce.� Don�t you
remember?�

������ �Yeah.�
Kinda.�

������ �Do you recall me pulling you to
safety?� 

������ Jack�s eyes grew wide. �Oh, man.� That was you?�

������ Axel grinned. 

������ Jack quickly became solemn. �So you
saved me again.� I guess I owe you
another one, don�t I?�

������ �You owe me nothing, Jack.� I did exactly as I am supposed to.� Protecting you is, after all, one of my
primary purposes.�

������ �How�s Midnight?� Is he okay?�

������ �He�s in better shape than you.� Axel
teased.

������ There was a flashing image, something he
had seen during the fight right after being hit.� Jack frowned.

������ �What about Sir Alwyn?�

������ Axel�s grin faded. �Sir Alwyn Kessel is
dead.�

������ Jack cursed.� 

������ �You very nearly died yourself.� He
added. �We were all worried.�

������ �I thought you told me I was nearly
invincible.� Jack demanded, unable to understand.� �Lyn said I�ve been out for two days and my
chest still hurts.� I haven�t healed
nearly as quick as I did before.�

������ �Up to now your worst injury was a
severe burn.� Axel patiently tried to explain.�
�This was different.� You were
shot at point blank range by a heavy crossbow.�

������� �A heavy crossbow?� One of those big ones with the winch on the
end?�

������ �Yes.�
They were most serious about ending your life with this attempt.�

������ �Can you tell me when they haven�t been
serious?�

������� Axel chuckled. �At any rate, this wound
was very deep with a large amount of tissue damage and blood loss.� You may be nearly invincible, but you are not
immortal.�

������ �So now you tell me?�

������ �The choice program is designed to heal
almost all injuries, even purge your system of poisons.� However, there are some wounds which, if
incurred, will default the user back to a preset area.�

������ �Such as?�

������ �Catastrophic injuries to the brain and
heart.� Axel told him. �The bolt you were shot with punctured one of your
lungs.� If it had pierced your heart,
which it very nearly did, you would have automatically been sent to the Program
Start-gate.�

������ �And with no program start-gate....�
Jack had finally caught on.

������ �Precisely.�

������ Jack thought about that for a
while.� It didn�t take long before he was
ready to switch subjects. �So after I got shot, what happened?�

������ �A battle happened.�

������ �How�d we do?� 

������ �Not as well as you might think although
the situation now is most agreeable.� The
men were disheartened to see you and Sir Alwyn fall, Jack.� It nearly took the fight from them but myself
and Sir Jeremy were able to rally and drive what was left of the Golwyn army
back to Sharford Castle.�

������ Jack nodded proudly. �Good job, big
guy.� You won your first battle.�

������ Axel bowed his head. �Thank you.� It was not easy but we did it.� At any rate, Sharford Castle has been
invested since yesterday and we are laying siege.�

������ �Yessssss!� Jack whispered, pumping his
fist in the air in triumph.� 

������ Axel cleared his throat.

� ��� �What?�

����� A strange smirk came across his bearded
face. �There is one thing I have yet to tell you....and I hesitate to even
mention it because I know the reaction I am going to get but....�

����� Jack was resigned. �Go ahead.� You may as well say it.� 

������ �Well....� He continued shyly. �It would
seem that since this morning the red and black banner flying above the castle
has been supplanted.�

������ �Huh?�

������ �...by a flag of truce.�

� �����Jack nearly jumped up from the bed. �Oh no
fucking way!�

����� �Axel raised his hands to soothe is anger.
�Now, Jack.� Please.� Calm yourself.� Under the circumstances of what has already
happened I would probably agree with you.�

������ �Why do I feel a �but� coming?�

������ �But...I believe something has been
happening behind the castle walls.�
Something is not right.�

������ �Do you have one of those feelings
again?� Jack huffed.

������ �Yes.�
And do you recall the last time I had one of those?�

� ������Ayla.� They both said the name in unison.

������ There was a long silence.� Jack lay in the bed staring up at the
ceiling.

������ Finally he said. �We really need to get
you and these feelings of yours checked out.�
I can�t believe you actually want me to talk with that asshole
again.� He killed Al and almost got me
too.�

����� �It was not Dunsan who shot you and Sir
Alwyn.� It was one of his knights.� Axel
argued.

����� �That�s a shaky distinction, pal.�

����� �Agreed.�
However, I do not believe he is fully responsible for what happened.�

����� �Why not?�

����� �Because I saw his face.� He was as shocked as anyone when you were
hit.� He cursed his own men and ordered
them to stop.�

����� �Oh yeah?�
Well they didn�t listen.� Jack snipped.

����� �Matters were too far gone by then.�

����� Jack�s eyes narrowed. �So what?� Am I supposed to forgive him and invite him
down for a second chance at killing me?�

����� �There will be little risk this time.� He
confided. �If Sir Olric or whoever is in command truly wishes to talk with us
he can refuse no demand we place on him.�
This is what I would propose as conditions....� 

������ Axel went on to explain his thoughts and
when he was done, Jack grimaced.

������ �Those are some pretty heavy
conditions.� I don�t think I would go
through with it if I was in his boots.�

������ �You would if you were sincere and
trusted the honor of those who you wished to talk with.� Axel countered.

������ �So, in other words,� Jack drew it out.
�If the commander doesn�t really want to talk then he�ll drop the truce flag
and keep fighting.�

������ �Exactly.� Axel said. �And if he wishes
to talk in earnest he will have no choice.�

������ �Are you sure about this?� Are you sure your feelings are leading you
right?�

������ �I�m certain, Jack.� His friend replied
soberly. �I would not ask you to do this if I were not.�

������ Jack took a deep breath and exhaled
slowly.� He couldn�t believe he was
actually contemplating doing this. 

����� �Okay.�
Set it up.�

����� 

������ 

������ 

����� 

����� Sir Olric Dunsan had chosen to put on his
finest suit of armor.� It was polished to
perfection, the shining silver emblem of a scorpion on his lacquered
breastplate standing in stark contrast to the obsidian black surrounding it.� He was, after all, Lord Commander of all
Golwyn forces remaining in the lands of Sharford.� He should at least look the part in front of
the enemy.� 

����� He dismounted cautiously amid a group of
soldiers wearing sashes of blue and gold and followed his escort to the
entrance of the White Tavern.� The two
men he had been allowed to bring with him followed but were stopped by the
guards.

����� �They must stay here.� The escort told him
coldly and Sir Olric gave them the signal to hold.

����� Sentries were at the door wearing eagle
pendants around their necks, hands on the hilts of their swords.� He started up the steps to the door but was
stopped.

������ �Arms up, sir.� The escorting knight
ordered and hesitantly he complied.� The
sentries moved in to search him for weapons.�
They relieved him of his sword, sword belt and a knife he had carried
since he had become a member of the countess�s guard.� Finally, once satisfied, they passed him
through.

������ �You may go in.�

������ He entered, not knowing what he would
find or what type of reception he would get.

����� It took a moment for his eyes to adjust to
the dark but when they did he found himself standing in a large common
room.� A place where, in better times,
travelers and guests and drank and supped.�
Men bearing weapons at the ready stood at every corner and nearly every
window.� The floor had been cleared
accept for a single table.� It had been
placed in the center.� And seated at the
end of the table in the only chair was......

����� Sir Olric�s eyes widened in surprise.� He had seen him hit and all but killed by a
crossbow bolt.� And two days later here
he was again, very much alive.� The man
wore a plain buff colored tunic and white shirt beneath.� His wide brimmed hat lay on the table.� By his side stood a small man with short
blond hair and a beautiful young woman with thick red hair pulled back in a
ponytail.

����� He had always heard the countess call him
names like fat pigeon and worm.� He could
not say such a thing as he studied him without the bulky gear war
required.� He was broad in shoulder and
solid, but not as fat as he had been led to believe.� Once again the countess had lied.� He was bald with only a slight tuft of dark
brown hair on the sides of his head.� On
his face he bore a thick mustache curved downward at the corners of his mouth
and grown long, nearly to his chin.

����� Lord Dullman eyed him cautiously as he
relaxed in his chair.� To his credit the
lord commander recovered quickly and bowed to him feeling the powerful stare of
everyone in the room.

����� �We meet again, my lord.� He said, slowly
moving to the area at the opposite end of the table a good distance from the
Lord and Master of Hargate so as not to appear a threat.�  

����� �Yeah, we do.� Lord Dullman answered
simply.

����� �I compliment you.� You have shown great forbearance in allowing
me to come here after the events of our first parley.�

����� �Yes I have.� Was all he would say.� 

����� �I must tell you what happened was not of
my sanction.�

����� �I�m sure it wasn�t.� There was heavy
sarcasm in his voice.� Sir Olric realized
then he was standing on very dangerous ground.

����� �Believe what you will.� Countess Golwyn gave me orders to make a
truce with you if it were possible.�
Failing that I was given instruction as to the only demands she would
accept.� I had nothing to do with her
plan to murder you under a flag of truce.�

����� �So now it�s her fault?� Lord Dullman�s
brow furrowed. �Does she know you�re blaming her for everything?� Why in the hell did she send you back out
here?�

����� �I am not here on the authority of the
Countess of Sharford.�

����� �Truly,� The blond man spoke up. �On who�s
authority have you come to us?�

����� He lifted his chin as a shot of pride ran
through him. �My own as Lord Commander.�

����� �And the Countess does not know you are
here?� I find that hard to fathom.�

����� �Her Ladyship fled after news reached her
I was withdrawing to Sharford Castle.�
She is not within its walls.� Sir Olric informed him.

����� Lord Dullman and the blond man gave each
other a short glance.

����� �Why are you here then?�

����� �To negotiate as best I may.� It is my aim to end this conflict.� Enough have already died.�

����� �Then put down your arms and surrender the
castle.� The blond man demanded.

����� �I would gladly do so...but first we must
discuss the terms of the surrender.�

����� �After all that has happened, you come
here and ask for terms?� You are
besieged. �You are in no position to ask
for anything.�

����� A thin smile crossed Sir Olric�s face
though there was no humor in it.� �A
siege is a curious thing.� Some
work.� Some do not.� There is no guarantee.� If possible, I believe it best to avoid such
a long, drawn out hardship.�

����� �Perhaps we will attack.� You are outnumbered near three to one.� All your men would be put to the sword.�

����� �Then do so.� He fired back sharply. �You
would bleed yourselves white in the attempt.�

����� Lord Dullman cocked his head to one side
and appraised him with a sly look. �You got a set of balls coming back, I�ll
give ya� that.�

����� �Thank you.� Sir Olric replied with a nod.

����� �Put down your weapons and surrender the
castle and your men can go free.� Lord Dullman told him.

����� �There will be no harm to them?� 

����� He shook his head. �They can go wherever
they want.� I won�t bother them.� If any wants to stay in my service they can
take an oath and join up.�

����� �The officers too?�

����� �Most of them can go too.� But no more black armor and no more
scorpions.�

������ �Most of them� Dunsan repeated.� �But not all.�

��� � �Some
will face a trial for crimes against the people of Hargate.�

����� �My lord, this has been a hard fought
campaign.� Things were done on our
advance north.� It is the nature of war.�
Sir Olric tried to explain.

����� Lord Dullman�s eyes suddenly became hard
and cold. �Do you know how many bodies we buried on our way here?� How many victims we found of your �hard
fought campaign?�� 

����� �All done by the order of the Countess and
by the hand of Sir Ansyl Wellock.�

����� The blond man spoke up. �Of those, one is
dead and the other is gone.� How
convenient for you.�

����� �It is the truth.� I swear to it.�

����� �You swear your oaths all too easily.� The
red haired woman finally spoke with much bitterness in her soft voice. �Did you
not also swear an oath to maintain the sacredness of the white flag when my
lord was almost killed?�

����� Sir Olric leveled an angry glare in her
direction but held his temper. �Tis� true, lady.� What was done was against all laws of good
conduct and tradition.� That is why I
offer to you, as a token to redeem my honor, the one who was responsible for
the attack.�

����� �You got the guy that shot me?� Lord
Dullman prodded.

����� �Aye, my lord.� I have the woman in my care.�

����� �Woman?��
There was a note of disbelief in his tone.� He had naturally assumed the knight who had
shot him had been a man.� But the more he
thought on it the more he realized it could have been a woman.� A suit of armor with a visor pulled down was
the perfect cover on a battlefield.

����� Sir Olric nodded.� �She has been a companion of the countess
ever since our little war began and was given a position of some
authority.� Fortunately, such authority
was lost when Her Ladyship decided to run away.�

����� There was a long pause.

����� �Her name wouldn�t happen to be Varisa,
would it?� 

����� The Lord Commander tried not to show the
shock he felt when the Lord of Hargate called the woman�s name.

����� �You remember her?� She was one of the escorts for her ladyship
during her embassy to Hargate.�

����� �Let�s just say Varisa and I have a
history.� You�re gonna give her to us?�

����� �I also offer you myself.�

����� The redhead snorted with derision.
�You?� What possible use would you be?�

����� �I offer my knowledge of the Countess and
her schemes.�

����� �Maybe I already know enough about her.�
Lord Dullman bated.

����� �Oh?�
I should think there is much you would want to know.� The two of you are so much alike.�

����� Lord Dullman pointed a finger at him, a
fierce anger seeping into his voice.� �I
am nothing like that bitch.�

����� �My apologies, my lord.� Sir Olric
said.� He dropped his blue eyes to the
chest where a crossbow bolt had been. �I had thought since you both can heal
wounds so quickly....and you both have, at times, spoken in the same strange
manner, there could be a connection.�

����� His words had the desired effect.� Lord Dullman�s mouth dropped open.� The blond man�s eyes flared beneath brows
arched in surprise.� Seeing both her
companions in such a state the red headed woman recovered her wits.� 

����� �What price would you put on such
information?�

����� �A parole.� He quickly stated while they
were off balance. �I would become my lord�s prisoner.� I would tell him all of what I know and have
discovered about the Countess over the years I was with her.� I assure you, I have the most fascinating
stories.� Once I have told everything I
would be allowed to take my leave and return home like my men.� It is all I ask for myself and my second in
command, Sir Marin Canmore.� 

����� There was a brief hush over the room, then
the chair scraped across the floor as Lord Dullman slowly stood.� He placed a hand on his chest as he did so
while the blond man and red headed woman helped him to his feet.

����� �Freedom for the men who want it....only a
handful of officers put on trial for war crimes....you get paroled....I get
Varisa.� Anything I forgot?�

����� Sir Olric shrugged. �I think it shall do
nicely.�

����� �Shake on it.�

������ Lord Dullman offered out an empty sword
hand across the table.� Sir Olric felt
the apprehension in the room.� He heard
hands tighten on weapons.� He stepped
forward cautiously and took the offered hand.�
They shook.

������ �My lord, Sharford Castle and all the
lands of its domain are now yours.�� Sir
Olric Dunsan took a quick step back and bowed formally to Jack Dullman.� 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

����� For months, ever since Lady Cora had given
the order to summon her levy in plans of moving north, Sharford Castle had been
adorned with banners of crimson and black hanging from the high walls.� Those banners were now tumbling to the ground,
their tethers being hacked through by Hargate axes.� The massive flag bearing the Golwyn sigil
which had once flown proudly from the spire of the central tower was gone,
replaced by aquamarine blue and shining gold.�
A procession of men, haggard and defeated, stumbled out of the main gate
headed back to their peacetime lives.� 

������ Axel sat on his warhorse watching them,
silently contemplating whether it had all been worth it.� So many had died.� Sir Alwyn Kessel, Hargate�s Master-of-Foot,
would be buried under the shade of an oak tree not far from the place where he
fell and Axel had very nearly had to bury Jack too.� Sharford had been conquered.� But the Countess had gotten away despite
their best efforts to stop her.� Sir
Jeremy believed her to be somewhere to the south or south east, headed toward
the border regions.� The Master-of-Horse
had sent out scouts and detachments to search but Axel believed they had little
hope of success.� The countess had a two
day head start.

����� Lady Hunter rode up to him, giving him a
brief nod. �The last of the defenders are disarmed and my men are searching the
castle room by room.�

����� �Is everything in order?� He asked.

����� �There has been some looting but that was
expected.� Lynette replied. �Sir Olric Dunsan has been given a suite of rooms
with the company of my best guards and the woman known as Varisa has been
secured and remains in the dungeon to await Lord Dullman�s pleasure though she
seems none too happy about her new living quarters.�

����� �Excellent.� 

����� �There were many prisoners in the
dungeon.� She continued on. �Some in rather poor shape.� What shall be done with them?�

����� Axel thought for a moment. �If they were
imprisoned by the countess, they may not be all bad.� Keep them where they are but see to their
needs.� There will be time for them soon
enough.�

����� �My lord continues to recover?�

����� �He does.�
He should be well enough to ride on the morrow.�

����� �It is hard to kill one of the Chosen.�
She said with a smile of relief. �Thanks be to the Makers.�

����� �Thanks be to the Makers, indeed.� Axel
agreed. �But be mindful of yourself.�
Such talk is fine with me but there are things which must not be said
where His Lordship can hear.�

����� �As you wish.�

����� For a long moment Lynette sat by his side
not saying a word but all the while she studied him closely.

����� �Sir Axel, why do you seem unhappy? 

����� �What is there to be happy about.� He
snorted in return.

����� �We have been victorious.� Is that not enough?�

����� He turned to her solemnly as a wagon laden
with wounded Sharford men trundled by.�
�A victory you say?� Perhaps it
is.� But it is nothing to be happy
about.� There are dark clouds over the
horizon.� There is much danger in them.�

����� �Are you certain?�

����� �I can sense we are standing on the edge
of a great conflict...one which will drench the land in blood.�

����� �Perhaps we should tell his lordship.�
Lynette pondered but Axel shook his head.

����� �For now Lord Dullman should rest.� I will tell him in due time.� You see, there is an innocence about him this
world has not yet destroyed.� If I were
to inform him of what I suspect he would think there is something he can do
about it.� He is still new to this world,
Lady Hunter, and does not yet realize there is much which goes on in this place
that is beyond his control.�

����� The sun was setting in the west, bathing
the world in its crimson glow.� Somehow
it seemed fitting.�

Part IV



 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;





 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The three women walked slowly down the narrow corridor amid the pitiful screams of the dungeon.&nbsp; They gazed from left to right as they passed by the many torture chambers where various questioners and their helpers went about their trade oblivious to the fact that they were being carefully observed.&nbsp; Sometimes they would stop and watch something that caught their attention through the iron lattice doors.&nbsp; Other times they would steal a quick peak and move on.&nbsp; They seemed an odd trio of tourists in such a place.&nbsp; Two were dressed similarly in boots and pleated pantaloons with white linen peasant shirts open about the chest to show off a considerable amount of youthful cleavage.&nbsp; The other was older and thus a little more conservative in her attire.&nbsp; She wore boots, black breeches and a dark green doublet which covered her feminine charms but was close fitting enough to leave no doubt that they were there beneath the fine fabric.&nbsp; They all wore brown leather sword belts with sabers dancing at their hips as they moved.&nbsp; The two younger women wore their sandy brown hair in similar braided queues which hung lazily down to the middle of their backs while the third let her blond tresses fall where they may.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finally the woman in green stopped and held up a hand to her two companions.&nbsp; She might have been the oldest among them but even so she had barely seen her thirtieth summer.&nbsp; She turned fully into one of the chambers studying those who worked within its confines and listening to the cries of the one who was the center of their cruel intent.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Is this the one you wished me to see.?� The woman asked as the chief inquisitor stepped away from his work for a moment to converse with his visitors.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It is, my lady.� The man confirmed.&nbsp; �A Hargate officer.&nbsp; One who was recently taken along the frontier and sent back for interrogation as was your order for all such prisoners of his kind.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A quiet but frustrated grunt slipped from the woman's lips.&nbsp; �Another one?&nbsp; I hope he has proved more helpful than the last few.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I assure you, ma'am.&nbsp; He has.� The man said.&nbsp; With a snap of his fingers the inquisitor received from one of his assistants a set of papers which he studied for a moment to find the relevant parts then offered them to the woman.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After only a moment of glossing over the transcripts her eyes shot up from the papers and over to the subject in question.&nbsp; He was a fair haired man, naked and restrained, pinned to the front of an upright X frame like an obscene butterfly with heavy leather bands at strategic locations across his form to keep him stable and unmoving.&nbsp; Upon, even in some cases protruding from, his body were a number of devices.&nbsp; Vices, needles and other more unique instruments ornamented his bloody, welt covered flesh, each in their own place, providing a separate, specific agony.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She gave the tortured man a soft, elegant nod of her head.&nbsp; �Sir Ryan.� She said to him, her gaze full of wonderment like a child who had just found a new toy.&nbsp; �I think congratulations are in order.&nbsp; You are the first Hargate man of knightly stature to grace our chambers...for now, at least.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Captain Sir Ryan Barnett, late of the Hargate cavalry, could only whimper back, eyes desperate above the temporary band of cloth the other workers had put into place to keep his screams muffled.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I take it he has been put to the question for some time?� She asked the inquisitor.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Two days, my lady.&nbsp; He was very stubborn and broke just last night.&nbsp; I must say he has been most resilient.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Quite.�&nbsp; The woman acknowledged with a raised eyebrow at the prisoner's tenacity in holding out under what must have been hellish suffering for so long for no other reason than not giving in.&nbsp; The questioners she had brought with her were some of the best and most efficient at inflicting pain she had ever seen.&nbsp; They had refined torture to a high art form...at least she considered it so.&nbsp; They were all in the employ of His Grace and he would have them no other way.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She reached out and laid a hand on his bare skin and the man shuddered at her touch.&nbsp; She moved closer.&nbsp; Leaned over and whispered into his ear.&nbsp; �I should thank you for your services, good sir.&nbsp; You have provided us with such a wealth of information.&nbsp; I am forever in your debt.�&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And then she stepped away pulling the inquisitor to her side. �Continue the torture for the next few days.� She said in a quiet tone so the unfortunate in question could not hear.&nbsp; �Find out if there is any other things he might know.&nbsp; You know what to look for.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The man nodded.&nbsp; �Will there be any need to call the executioner?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The woman sighed as she studied the prisoner's battered but still intact body.&nbsp; �No, I think not.&nbsp; If he is still alive next week I will send him back as a gift to His Grace.&nbsp; Goddess knows he loves a new play toy every now and again.&nbsp; Until then pray continue and inform me of any new developments as you see necessary.�&nbsp; As an afterthought, while the pair of brunettes walked out of the chamber,&nbsp; she added.&nbsp; �And keep up the good work.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�By your leave, Lady Leandra.�&nbsp; The inquisitor simpered with a bow then returned to his job which had been sorely neglected while he was away.&nbsp; �No, no...� He grumbled as he saw what one of his assistants had been attempting.&nbsp; He took the thin barbed probe from the man and demonstrated the proper technique.&nbsp; He lifted the prisoner's flaccid penis and pressed the lancet against the defenseless head.&nbsp; The prisoner could see what was happening and began to cry out in sheer terror of what was about to be done.&nbsp; The gag was then removed and the man pleaded in a voice all but ruined from continuous screams.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Please!&nbsp; What is the use in this for I have already told you all that I know!�&nbsp; The man was shedding tears at the thought of more suffering, his eyes transfixed on the wickedly serrated surface of the probe as the tip pressed against the tiny mouth of his member.&nbsp; �If there is any mercy in you then just kill me and have done with this!�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The inquisitor looked up with genuine indignation. �I have no intention of killing you, sir.&nbsp; Now where would be the use in that?�&nbsp; He then slowly pressed the finely tooled device down the shaft of his organ and fresh wails of burning agony erupted in the busy dungeon.











 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As Lady Leandra Vale walked out of the chamber she found her two similarly dressed companions waiting.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Am I to believe the information you have been seeking has been found?�&nbsp; One of them asked as she approached.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I dare say it has, sister.�&nbsp; Lady Vale answered smugly as she waved the transcripts from Barnett's interrogations.&nbsp; �Sir Ryan actually met with Lord Dullman on several occasions and has served with him since he arrived at Hargate Castle.&nbsp; His insights and knowledge of events will be of the greatest interest to me.&nbsp; This is exactly what I have been waiting for.�&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The other, clearly the youngest of the trio, shook her head and frowned.&nbsp; �Yet do we not already know all there is to know about Lord Dullman?&nbsp; This seems like such a waste of effort.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�We know what Lord Dullman used to be, my dearest.� Leandra explained to the novice with much patience. �What we don't know and understand is what he has become.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Forgive me, my lady,� She responded honestly.&nbsp; �,but I see no difference.&nbsp; I myself have studied all about him and have found nothing lacking in the accounts.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Leandra raised an eyebrow. �Truly?&nbsp; And what do you make of the man?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Put on the spot the young one thought quickly and formulated her reply.&nbsp; �He is slow witted and lazy.&nbsp; Every record we have says so.&nbsp; More interested in his meat and drink and his own pleasures than what happens around him.&nbsp; All of his kind are thus.&nbsp; I doubt that could change.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yet this slow and self absorbed man has successfully battered the single greatest military power in western Loranth to it's knees in only two months.�&nbsp; Leandra stared her down but the young girl would not give in.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Perhaps he has just been lucky.&nbsp; Or others have been incompetent.�&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She refused to give up her point.&nbsp; The girl had spirit just like all the others who bore the mark faithfully. �Perhaps you are right....on both accounts.�&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Without another word Leandra left the dungeons behind and her two companions followed at her side until they emerged into the inner courtyard of her temporary home.&nbsp; The day was muggy with low cloud cover and warm drizzle coming in spattering fits.&nbsp; The trio was making their way quickly over to the stables when they saw several men in the segmented body armor of the Knightsbridge Levy approaching them.&nbsp; They were led by a tall, well dressed man wearing the latest city fashion complete with feathers and tassels.&nbsp; Leandra recognized him immediately.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She stopped. �Captain Raigern, good day to you.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The officer greeted them but he did not look happy.&nbsp; His demeanor was of a man both angry yet resigned at the same time.&nbsp; Without preamble he held forth a note. �I think you should read it.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What does it say?� Leandra asked trying to glean a hint about it's contents.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It's a dispatch from our people along the frontier.� Was all he would say.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After reading the note Lady Leandra Vale's lips curled in a smile devoid of humor.&nbsp; She handed it over to the girl known as Shanyn, the novice.&nbsp; �Care to rethink your ideas of lord Dullman?� 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As the youngest of them read the dispatch the other young brunette, known as Alexis, spoke up. �Something has happened?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Leandra nodded.&nbsp; �I should say so.&nbsp; Sharford Castle has fallen.�&nbsp; She turned to Captain Raigern. �How long ago?&nbsp; Do we know?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Six days.� Was the answer.&nbsp; The news was six days old. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�And no mention of Sir Lanart?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�None.� Captain Raigern said.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Leandra cursed. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I don't understand how this could have happened.� Shanyn's voice was full of disbelief.&nbsp; �How could it have been taken so swiftly?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Read the note more carefully.&nbsp; It wasn't taken. It surrendered.� Leandra said looking up at the angry sky as the rain grew suddenly heavy. �Let us take cover, sisters.&nbsp; We can at least be dismayed and stay dry at the same time.&nbsp; Captain, be so good to find Sir Rodrick and inform him of what has happened.&nbsp; I doubt he is unaware but we can at least give our allies this courtesy.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�As you wish.� Captain Raigern replied with a smirk.&nbsp; He took Lady Leandra's hand, kissed it and was gone.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The trio found shelter beneath a wooden awning near the stables.&nbsp; They were silent for a while, contemplating their own thoughts and trying to cope with the reality of what they had just discovered.&nbsp; The news hammered them for they knew what it meant.&nbsp; Sharford was done for.&nbsp; Hargate forces already controlled half of their territory.&nbsp; The castle was the only stronghold preventing the fall of the rest and now it was gone.&nbsp; That did not sit well with any of them.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Alexis finally broke the quiet.&nbsp; �Was there no word of the Countess Golwyn?&nbsp; Perhaps something can be salvaged from Sharford.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Leandra looked to her companion.&nbsp; �There were no specifics in the dispatch but unless I miss my mark Lady Cora was nowhere near her castle when it fell.&nbsp; Neither was Sir Lanart.&nbsp; In fact, they are probably trying to make their way here even now.&nbsp; Though to their success I cannot speak.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�And what about our sisters?� Shanyn asked.&nbsp; She was taking the news hardest of all.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Leandra shook her head as she stared out at the rain.&nbsp; �Of their fates we know even less but one thing is for certain....if the Countess failed in her endeavors to control and destroy Lord Dullman then they have failed as well.&nbsp; Perhaps they are with her and perhaps they were lost.&nbsp; Only time will tell us.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shanyn was visibly shaken.&nbsp; �So what do we do now?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lady Leandra turned to them.&nbsp; �We must steel ourselves for what is to come, sisters.&nbsp; Sharford is gone.&nbsp; This little war of theirs has come to a close and Lord Dullman has been victorious.&nbsp; All that has been done to stop him up to this point has failed.&nbsp; We must not make the same mistakes...for now it has become our task to stop him.&nbsp; His Grace has given us the charge and we shall, Goddess willing, do so or die in the attempt.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�As you command.� The two women echoed in return.

 









 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;White Tavern.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Not just a place....but a name which would be stuck in Jack's head for the rest of his life.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Over a week had passed since a battle involving nearly four thousand men had been fought on a quiet field just outside his window.&nbsp; More than a week since Lynette and some of his loyal bodyguards had carried him up the stairs to a lonely room and placed his pale form on a creaking old cot unsure of whether he would live or die despite the best works of the healers and his body's amazing ability to regenerate itself.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Oh yes...White Tavern was a name he would remember for a long time to come.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He stood in front of a sheet of dented copper mottled with a green patina, the closest thing to a mirror to be had, and lifted his arms as Ktari buckled the straps of his new cuirass.&nbsp; It was a plain piece lacking any fancy adornment but it suited him just as well.&nbsp; It was not so different in design from the old one which had to be thrown away due to the hole driven into it by an assassin's bolt.&nbsp; There was one major difference, however, which caught Jack's attention and his imagination.&nbsp; It's brilliant shine.&nbsp; He smiled to himself.&nbsp; All his life he had wanted to be a knight in shining armor.&nbsp; A soldier who fought in great battles and saved damsels in distress.&nbsp; Now he was actually starting to become what he had always dreamed.&nbsp; If only it wasn't so damned dangerous.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While the little squire went about her work he took a more careful note of his likeness in the metal and found an unfamiliar form gazing back.&nbsp; His face looked worn, his cheeks sunken.&nbsp; In the boring days and restless nights at the tavern his appetite had left him and not returned.&nbsp; His belly, which had only months ago been considerable, was melting away with something close to an alarming speed.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No more shed for the tool.� He mumbled.&nbsp; �Well, I guess I won't be hearing any more fat jokes for awhile.� 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What was that, my lord?� Ktari asked as she peaked at his reflection from beneath his arm.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh....you heard that?&nbsp; Sorry, Nibblet.&nbsp; Just thinking out loud.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The lanky teen smiled back at him in the mirror. �It's alright, my lord.&nbsp; For you, at least.&nbsp; My sister tells me quite often that thinking in one so young as me is a dangerous prospect.&nbsp; Be it out loud or in silence.&nbsp; She tells me I should try to avoid it whenever possible.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That caused Jack to chuckle.&nbsp; �I suppose it was pretty tough growing up with your big sis being the Captain-of-the-Guard.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�She was not always so.&nbsp; Life was hard when I was younger and being in service to my sister was a thankless task.� He saw the pretty smile fade a bit but then brighten. �but I was rescued from that.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Really?&nbsp; What happened?� 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You did, my lord.� And her reflection darted away with a playful wink as she refocused on her task.&nbsp; More and more Jack could see Lady Lynette in the young girl.&nbsp; When he first met Ktari she had been shy and awkward.&nbsp; Thin, lanky and not that pretty at all.&nbsp; But then he began to study her face.&nbsp; The eyes, the nose, the chin.&nbsp; They were like standard parts copied and placed on both.&nbsp; And even if she was still awkward and bony with hair that would frighten most brushes away Jack could tell that the seeds of true beauty were within her.&nbsp; Just like her sister, Ktari Hunter was going to be one hell of a hottie.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jack could feel a warmth start to rise within him and a sudden panic followed.&nbsp; His member began to harden and strain against the fabric of his breaches.&nbsp; Jack closed his eyes and tried to take his mind off sex.&nbsp; More importantly he did not want to think of Ktari in such a way.&nbsp; Lynette was one thing.&nbsp; Ktari was another.&nbsp; The child was barely fourteen.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The only consolation for him was his thoughts of Ktari were of the older, fully blossomed version.&nbsp; Not the narrow-ass little waif she was.&nbsp; He tried to act normally as Ktari circled around him, double checking each of the many fastenings of his armor and coming uncomfortably close to his groin.&nbsp; He was actually getting control over himself until she touched him.&nbsp; Checking to see how the breastplate fit at his waist the back of her hand brushed ever so gently against the shaft of his semi-hard organ.&nbsp; The touch sent a shiver down his spine.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Both hands went to his face to cover his eyes and he cursed himself for his weakness.&nbsp; In the real world he had been no stranger to abstinence.&nbsp; He had actually begun to think of himself as a sexual camel.&nbsp; Give him a piece of ass every blue moon or so and he could eek by.&nbsp; But this world was different.&nbsp; This world was supposed to be a place of sex and passion and lust.&nbsp; The irony of it was he had yet to have sex a single time in the months he had been locked in a virtual reality program designed specifically to give him every sexual experience he had ever wanted.&nbsp; Ayla giving him a blow job the first day of his arrival didn't count.&nbsp; He didn't bust a load and she had tried to murder him.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Come to think on it, he hadn't even jerked off since he got downloaded.&nbsp; That had to be something of a record for him.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Time to think of other things.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�How do I look?� He sputtered, rubbing his eyes and dropping his hands away as a cover.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Most handsome, my lord.&nbsp; The polished armor suits you main well.� She answered proudly. �It's much more noble than the old gray steel.�

He looked at his reflection from head to toe in the mirror and had to agree. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Wow.&nbsp; It does look pretty cool.&nbsp; Especially with the black pants and sleeves.�&nbsp; Beneath the three-quarter armor Jack wore a suit of coal black as padding.&nbsp; From neck to thigh he was covered in steel..&nbsp; All with the same shimmering surface.&nbsp; He was half man in black, half shinning metal.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jack had to lift his arms again as Ktari helped him put on a double wrapped belt and scabbard carrying a basket hilted straight sword.&nbsp; And, as a final touch, a polished steel gorget with a golden rampant eagle embossed on it's front was placed around his neck.&nbsp; Hargate craftsmen had made them as a more permanent replacement to the gold pendants his security detail wore.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Are we all packed?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ktari nodded. �The last parcels were taken down while you dressed.&nbsp; All is ready.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A wide brimmed cavalier style hat, black with a large white plume in it's band lay on the bed.&nbsp; The very bed where he had laid and recovered from his wound.&nbsp; He picked it up and, with a flourish Ktari had taught him, he sat it upon his head.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good.&nbsp; Let's get the fuck outta here.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jack gave the room one last sweep.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I hope I never have to stay here again.�











 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The guards at the bottom of the stairway straightened as Jack made his way down.&nbsp; He could hear chairs scraping against the floor and people moving about with a sudden quickness.&nbsp; When he got to the common room of the tavern he was met by a squad of his personal guards.&nbsp; Their blue and gold waist sashes marked them as soldiers of the Hargate Household Guards.&nbsp; But they too wore the rampant eagle gorgets.&nbsp; They called themselves the Eagle Guards.&nbsp; They were the best of his best.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lady Lynette Hunter stood at their head, resplendent in her own armor, and she offered a respectful bow as her eyes showed approval of his appearance.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I must say the new armor does you justice.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Thank you, Lyn.&nbsp; That's real sweet a' you to say.� Jack said. �I gotta admit it feels a little weird but it looks fuckin' awesome.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I'm sure you will make a good impression on the crowds today.� She told him with a weak smile. �That is, as long as you insist on riding.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He frowned.&nbsp; �Do you ever give up, woman?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lady Lynette lowered her gaze in expectation of what was coming.&nbsp; �I'm afraid not when it comes to your safety, my lord.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well, I wish you would get it through your thick skull.&nbsp; I am not riding in a carriage like a little old woman.&nbsp; Okay?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As Jack had recovered from his injuries Axel, his personal program assistant, had taken the task of setting Sharford Castle back in order after it's surrender.&nbsp; Both had taken longer than expected.&nbsp; Lady Hunter, in that time, had begun to obsess with Jack's well being.&nbsp; She took up a sparse room just down the hall from the place where he stayed for the sole purpose of being near him in case she was needed.&nbsp; She had begged, pleaded and all but demanded that he stay there and not leave unless escorted by half the army.&nbsp; The White Tavern soon became her own personal fortress and no one could enter or leave without her say.&nbsp; She had been his Captain-of-the-Guard during two assassination attempts.&nbsp; Both she seemed to blame on herself.&nbsp; To compensate for what she saw as her past failures she began to micro-manage every aspect of his life around security and he had been forced to put a stop to several of her schemes.&nbsp; One of which was the idea of riding into Sharford Castle in a closed carriage so as to avoid the crowds and thereby frustrate another possible attempt on his life.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�If that is your wish.� She said, at last defeated.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It is.� He told her with a nod. �For me to be seen riding into the castle on horseback is probably the best thing I could do.&nbsp; Hell, Lyn, you know the rumors that started circulating about me after I got shot.&nbsp; Some of our own men thought I was dead...and what have I done to change that?&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; Until today.&nbsp; Trust me on this....will you?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At that she straightened defiantly yet her eyes seemed to fill with hurt. �I have always trusted you, my lord.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jack remembered it then.&nbsp; He was laying on his back with a crossbow bolt buried in his chest.&nbsp; Lynette's face was hovering over top of him.&nbsp; Her hair dangled in his eyes but he could still see the pain and grief...and the tears flooding down her cheeks.&nbsp; She had taken his near death hard.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I know you do.� He consoled. �But you have to give me some room here.&nbsp; I know it would be safer to ride in a carriage but sometimes I have to do what I think is best even if it's against your better judgment.&nbsp; You understand?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Reluctantly she agreed.&nbsp; �I do, my lord.&nbsp; I suppose my other arrangements will have to be sufficient.� 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What other arrangements?&nbsp; Oh, forget it.&nbsp; Come on.&nbsp; If it'll make you feel better I'll let you ride beside me.&nbsp; Okay?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One of the guards opened the door and stood aside.&nbsp; Jack walked out into the bright sunshine and was stopped dead in his tracks.&nbsp; Instead of the small squad of escorts he was expecting he found in front of him a line of soldiers mounted on their horses along both sides of the pathway leading to the road..

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From behind, Lady Lynette screamed at the top of her lungs. �Company!!......Draw Sabers!!�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Steel rasped against steel as a hundred swords were unsheathed to glitter in the morning light.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Three cheers for Lord Dullman!!!......Conquerer of Sharford!!!!�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was a thunderous explosion of sound. �HOOORAAHH!!!.....HOOORAAHH!!!......HOOOORAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!!�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Son of a bitch.� Jack muttered to himself.&nbsp; At first he was astonished.&nbsp; He was nothing more than a janitor.&nbsp; Had never intended to be anything more and had become accustomed to the idea he never would be.&nbsp; But that was the real world.&nbsp; His consciousness being trapped in a bizarre computer program had changed all of that.&nbsp; They had just cheered him and the rush of vibrations the sheer noise had made was like a wave of strength and confidence.&nbsp; Something he had seldom gotten before.&nbsp; He grinned as he began to walk down between the rows of horsemen.&nbsp; He smiled up at all, spoke to some and gave acknowledgment to others.&nbsp; He started to hear short phrases of encouragement as they expressed their belief in him, their wishes for his continued safety and health, and he even began to reach out and grab those hands which were offered to him.&nbsp; By the time he got to the end of the line Ktari came around leading a tall, black stallion by the reigns.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Midnight!� Jack called out, happy to see his horse once again.&nbsp; He reached forth a hand and Ktari gave over a carrot she had been holding for him.&nbsp; The horse took the treat as Jack rubbed his dark coat.&nbsp; �Good boy.&nbsp; Good boy.� He whispered. �How's my boy been?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the real world Jack had kept several pets.&nbsp; Most were cats who never stayed for any length of time.&nbsp; The one dog he had owned, a chihuahua named Rosco, bit him, pissed in his shoes and ran away after only a week.&nbsp; Midnight had become his one and only true animal companion and the strong feeling he had at seeing his horse again were surprising.&nbsp; He slipped to the side and placed a foot in the stirrup.&nbsp; Grabbing hold of the pommel horn he lifted himself into the saddle.&nbsp; The first time since the battle he had been there.&nbsp; And damn but did it feel good.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Others were mounting up as officers called out orders to the company escort.&nbsp; Jack pulled Midnight around with practiced ease and gently spurred the big charger into a trot.&nbsp; Near daily training under the watchful eyes of Ktari had transformed him into something he thought he would never be....a horseman.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The day promised to grow exceedingly hot but the pace of the ride was quick and the fresh air tasted sweet on Jack's tongue.&nbsp; As they neared the village he began to notice people gathering on the sides of the road.&nbsp; They were peasants.&nbsp; Farmers.&nbsp; Entire families dropped what they were doing in the fields and ran to see what was going on.&nbsp; They stood in silence and watched.&nbsp; They did not cheer or call out.&nbsp; They seemed too afraid for that.&nbsp; He started smiling at some but they only stared back.&nbsp; Others he tried to wave to but they scurried away, acting as if someone had given them a physical blow.&nbsp; Just before entering the town they came across several squads of soldiers.&nbsp; His reception there was much better.&nbsp;&nbsp; They raised their hands to him, cheering as he passed by.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once he entered the town he began to understand why Lynette had been so concerned.&nbsp; People came out of nowhere to stand on the narrow cobblestone ways crowding in on them as they made their way to the castle.&nbsp; And once again he found them to be dead silent.&nbsp; No one cheered him, no one said a word.&nbsp; They seemed to be such an angry lot.&nbsp; He held up a hand to them as he went by.&nbsp; Some of the children waved while others tried running beside the horses.&nbsp; The adults just looked on.&nbsp; It was spooky.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sharford Castle was not as impressive as it had once been.&nbsp; At a distance it dominated every other building in the village with it's high stone walls and towers.&nbsp; But upon closer inspection it was just another run down building.&nbsp; Hargate Castle was much nicer in his opinion though not as big.&nbsp; The main gate slowly descended, the portcullis raised as they approached.&nbsp; Hargate men were everywhere as they rode through the gatehouse.&nbsp; They let their voices ring out in celebration of their triumph as Jack entered into Cora Golwyn's former lair.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They crossed the courtyard and came to the front entrance of the main house within the defensive wall.&nbsp; It was a three story wood and carved stone building with a heavily repaired slate tile roof directly connected to the massive central tower.&nbsp; Axel stood in front of a solid block of kneeling servants.&nbsp; He appeared calm and well rested as always.&nbsp; Nothing seemed to get to the man.&nbsp; He was unstoppable.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Axel!&nbsp; What's up?� He called out as he pulled Midnight to a stop.&nbsp; The program assistant grinned and offered up a hand.&nbsp; Jack leaned down and took it, locking forearm to forearm.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You are looking well, my friend.� The blond man said in greeting. �Although you are a bit thin.&nbsp; Haven't they been feeding you?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jack shook his head disgustedly.&nbsp; �Brother, you have no idea.&nbsp; The food at the Tavern reeked.�&nbsp; He swung a leg over the horse and slid out of the saddle. �But other than that....I'm good to go.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Excellent.� Axel mused. �I'm glad to hear it.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jack became distracted for a moment when he caught movement at one of the upper floor windows.&nbsp; Someone was looking out at them.&nbsp; He did a double take at the window but the person seemed to melt back into the darkness which had surrounded them.&nbsp; He then lifted his gaze and tried to take in the whole central structure of the castle with it's core walls and towers.&nbsp; Run down or not they still seemed all too functional. �Son of a bitch.� He whispered.&nbsp; �This would have been one hell of a place to try and take.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes, it would have been.� Axel agreed somberly. �Would you care for a tour?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Hell yeah.� Jack said.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Then follow me....and well-come to Sharford Castle.�











 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well...it looks better than I thought it would.� Jack admitted rather happily.&nbsp; �Here I was expecting everything to be red and black with manacles hanging from the walls.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ktari snickered as she put away his armor.&nbsp; It was the first thing he shed when he entered the set of rooms that would be his, the final stop on a tour that had taken him from the highest ramparts to the lowest scullery.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What would you have done if it was?� Axel asked as he poured a dark liquid from a crystal decanter into two short tumblers.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jack lounged back onto the cushions of the window settee unbuttoning his doublet and pulling open the white shirt underneath to bare his sweating chest to the fresh air. �I think I'd be sleeping back at the tavern for the night.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The computer program picked up both drinks and handed one to Jack.&nbsp; �Yes.&nbsp; I believe you would be.&nbsp; But rest your fears.&nbsp; It was nothing of the sort.&nbsp; Granted, we did have to set a few things right and clean up here and there but for the most part it was as you see it.�&nbsp; The walls were paneled and thick carpets covered the floors.&nbsp; Art and ornamental weaponry hung everywhere and suites of ancient chain mail armor stood vigil at every corner.&nbsp; All the rooms were small, the corridors leading from one to the next were claustrophobic but that was to be expected of the architecture.&nbsp; The layout was of a central parlor with bedrooms, bath closets, conference rooms and library radiating out from it.&nbsp; There was a stairway in the parlor leading down to a similar suite on the first floor.&nbsp; They were all fully appointed with lacquered hardwood furnishings.&nbsp; Very tasteful.&nbsp; It was something he had not expected of the countess.&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Did you check the bed?� Jack inquired. �You know....just to see if there are any scorpions under the covers or anything.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This time Axel stifled a grin.&nbsp; �Trust me, my friend.&nbsp; No scorpions......Cheers!� He hefted the glass, tossing back it's contents and gritted his teeth as it went down his throat.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jack looked down at his own tumbler with a frown. �Hey, what is this stuff.�&nbsp; He swirled it around softly trying not to spill it.&nbsp; He took a sip and his eyes lit up.&nbsp; �Holy shit!�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It's plum brandy.&nbsp; What do you think?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jack took another exploratory sip then started to fan his face.&nbsp; �Two things.&nbsp; First off, it's some pretty good hooch.... and second, it's melting the lining in my throat.&nbsp; What is it, a hundred forty proof?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Not quite....but close.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ktari popped up off of the floor where she had been cleaning his armor and stowing it away piece by piece. �May I have some?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What?....Hell no.� Jack retorted. �Ain't you supposed to be doing something useful.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She froze.&nbsp; Jack could see she was trying to think but her mind didn't appear to work. �Well...uh....my lord...I uh...�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Nibblet, you do the airhead look really well.� Jack said. �What about my gear?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Put away, my lord.� She answered.&nbsp; She had been tirelessly unpacking into the new home while he had been taking in the view.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Then get out of here and find your own room.&nbsp; Take one of the bedrooms downstairs for all I care.&nbsp; Then you can go look around, okay?&nbsp; Now shoo!�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ktari's face lit up and she squealed like the overjoyed teenager she was.&nbsp; She started to run back into the parlor, remembered herself, turned to bow, and disappeared from sight.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Axel returned to the decanter and filled his glass once again. �Care for more?� He offered.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No thanks.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Very well....more for me.� 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jack laughed.&nbsp; �Go easy, big guy.&nbsp; I wouldn't know how to handle a drunk program assistant.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Don't worry,� He explained after downing half of his tumbler in a single gulp.&nbsp; �I don't have the same simulated functions as the other programs in this choice package.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Okay....so what does that mean?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Simply put, I don't get drunk.&nbsp; I do, however, feel something.&nbsp; I think you would call the effect being lightly....'buzzed'?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Interesting.&nbsp; I guess next thing you tell me is you don't have to sleep.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Axel walked over and sat on the other end of the settee with his back against the window sill to face Jack.&nbsp; �I'm surprised you hadn't noticed until now but actually I don't.&nbsp; I merely rest for an hour or two.&nbsp; It's quite sufficient.� 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jack just shook his head and sipped on his brandy.&nbsp; �Weird, Axel.&nbsp;&nbsp; Very weird.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The blond man acknowledged it with a dip of his head.&nbsp; �Thank you.&nbsp; I think.�&nbsp; Then he cleared his throat.&nbsp; It was almost like a signal that the conversation was going to take a more serious tone.&nbsp; Axel himself appeared to grow more focused.&nbsp; �First, let me say it is good to see you back up and in fine shape too.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Thanks.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�And let me also say I hope you've gotten plenty of rest....because you are going to need it.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jack rolled his eyes.&nbsp; �Figures.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�While you were off at the tavern recovering I was here trying to set this shambles of a house in order and the work is still not done.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I thought you said things weren't that bad?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh, Jack, we have more problems than just a messy castle.� Axel said after he finished the tumbler off for the second time. �There are things which I may do alone such as preparing this place for you or keeping the army together or keeping the people in order.&nbsp; In fact, it is in my files to do so in an effort to make your experience in your choice program more enjoyable...�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well I'm enjoying the hell out of it so far.� Jack butted in sarcastically.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�...and then there are things which only you can do as rightful lord.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Like what?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Like making a decision on what we do with Sharford.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jack exhaled slowly at the blunt reply, his eyes darted to the gardens below and the servants working in it.&nbsp; �Damn.&nbsp; To be honest with ya' I never really thought this far ahead.&nbsp; But that's the million crown question now, isn't it?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It's one we may have to answer quickly.� Axel pressed.&nbsp; �We are stuck in a field of nettles here.&nbsp; Which ever way we move it seems we will get pricked.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�The other houses?&nbsp; Like Wexford and Cardin?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Axel nodded, pleased with Jack's knowledge of the situation. �Precisely.&nbsp; You've been studying, have you?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Hell yeah.&nbsp; What else was there to do besides heal?�&nbsp; Jack looked over the room, still half a disaster from Ktari's unpacking.&nbsp; He pointed to a book on a corner table. �That's it.&nbsp; Over there.&nbsp; Ktari gave it to me to keep me occupied while I was stuck in my room.&nbsp; It's called the Histories and Lineages of the Great Houses of Loranth.�&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Hmmmm.&nbsp; Sounds damn dreary.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh I don't know.&nbsp;&nbsp; It told me a whole lot of stuff about this bunch of brats we've got living around us.&nbsp; I thought Cora Golwyn was bad.&nbsp; And then there's the Duke...this Silvan Brassey guy.&nbsp; If only half the shit they're saying about his family is true then they make Charlie Manson and his bunch look like fuckin' cub scouts.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Axel winced.&nbsp; He was probably the only other person inside the program who would understand the reference. �Yes.&nbsp; I imagine it did but the duke is not our immediate problem.&nbsp; This group of 'brats' as you call them, is.&nbsp; With the fall of the castle Sharford has collapsed.&nbsp; Sir Jeremy reports he is moping up the last pockets of resistance in the south as we speak....but the victory was not complete.&nbsp; The countess has slipped through our fingers and as soon as she can she will spread any number of poisons about us.&nbsp; From what I have heard tell, the countess may well be despised by the other landed gentry but her case will likely hold merit with them.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�How?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I fear our conquest here will be seen as nothing more than a land grab or some sort of personal vendetta taken too far.&nbsp; Such a thing is against the very laws of this realm without royal edict.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Okay.� Jack said calmly but with a very distinct sinking feeling in his stomach.&nbsp; �So we just brought the attention of every lord in Loranth down on us?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I think it to be very likely.�

�I see.� Jack said with a nod.&nbsp; �And so what happens next?&nbsp; The whole country comes together against us and we get put down like a bunch of wild dogs?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I'm afraid that may be correct.�&nbsp; The computer program shifted uneasily.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Sweet.� Jack said. �This program sucks, Axel.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jack emptied the last of his tumbler in one massive gulp.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Running!&nbsp; Constantly running!&nbsp; It's what their lives had been reduced to.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The pace was grueling.&nbsp; Ten leagues a day and damn the poor soul who could not keep up.&nbsp; The men were nearly falling from their saddles.&nbsp; Their mounts were ready to collapse.&nbsp; But the ragged line of soldiers, knights, followers and servants clustered themselves together beneath the last crimson and black banner of their mistress's house and moved on day after day in a desperate bid to deliver Sir Lanart Brassey to Knightsbridge, the great capital of all Loranth.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Their escape from the castle had been a difficult one.&nbsp; They had almost left too late.&nbsp; To their dismay, they discovered the eastern roads which would have taken them through the Fyns were swarming with Jeremy Ross's cavalry, cutting off their most direct and safest route.&nbsp; The southeastern roads, though open, were still hazardous and several bloody skirmishes had occurred with advance Hargate patrols on their long journey to the border.&nbsp; Once there, on the edge of her territory, Lady Cora Golwyn spoke with Sir Lanart about continuing on.&nbsp; They were about to enter the lands of Wexford, ruled by a lord who was as much Lady Cora's implacable foe as Jack Dullman.&nbsp; She had raided into Wexford for years, burning, pillaging and even enslaving some of it's people.&nbsp; She was sure it would not be appreciated.&nbsp; Perhaps they should head south and take the longer, more cumbersome road through the lands of Devonwick where the greeting promised to be more civil.&nbsp; But Sir Lanart was confident his banners would protect them both in their crossing.&nbsp; No one would dare defy the power and authority of Loranth.&nbsp; Not even Wexford.&nbsp; Or so the theory went.&nbsp; Besides, it was so close now and the path so much easier and quicker to follow.&nbsp; Misgivings at placing herself at the hands of an enemy aside, Lady Cora did not have much of a choice.&nbsp; It was either go forward and face capture or stay where she was and face capture.&nbsp; The proverbial rock and a hard place.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And so they moved on, leaving Sharford behind in the pre-dawn hours of a beautiful early summer day.&nbsp; The column straggling through the gentle hill country going deeper into the unknown.&nbsp; Lady Cora decided to ride a horse rather than ride in the only remaining carriage.&nbsp; They had started out with three of the delicate vehicles.&nbsp; Two had broken down with splintered axles.&nbsp; The undue haste of the escape having been the cause of their destruction.&nbsp; They were left on the side of the road and stripped bare, cannibalized to keep the third one rolling with the spare parts.&nbsp; It was also where Sir Lanart chose to dwell, barely coming out of the shuttered cab for anything except for the calls of nature.&nbsp; She did not have the stomach to sit with him and his slave Nicholus, who was his constant companion.&nbsp; She could not stand his company even in the best of times.&nbsp; So she rode beside the carriage wearing a set of riding cloths dusted with leagues of roadway.&nbsp; Her boots were worn brown leather, her snug fitting pants were made of red homespun.&nbsp; Her shirt was barely white and her dark sleeveless doublet was open about the neck in a large V.&nbsp; Her lustrous hair hung loose but for a few strategically placed combs.&nbsp; It was the most common many of those still with her had ever seen her look.&nbsp; But on her hip was an unmistakable symbol of her power.&nbsp; It was a broadsword with a bejeweled pommel and a wrapped leather grip taken from her late husband.&nbsp; It was not her first choice in attire but of what she had remaining to her it was perhaps the most functional for the situation.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A situation which changed ominously when the column unexpectedly came to a stop.&nbsp; She swore under her breath.&nbsp; Almost since the hour they had entered Wexford she could sense they were being watched.&nbsp; On occasion she had even seen the telltale glint of metal far off on the horizon.&nbsp; She had warned Sir Aiden Thorne, the captain of her guards, to be mindful, that Wexford scouts might be around them.&nbsp; Despite their fatigue he had assured her he and his men would be alert to any dangers.&nbsp; Now this....after only a day in southern Wexford.&nbsp; A full hour before the next brief respite was due.&nbsp; It did not bode well.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One of the blinds went up on the carriage and Sir Lanart poked his chubby face out the window.&nbsp; �Ladyship, why have we stopped?&nbsp; Is there a problem?� He whined.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Nothing to worry about, I'm sure.� She answered him but there was a genuine concern leaking into her voice.&nbsp; There were many times she had been forced to draw on her ability to act in ways contrary to her nature.&nbsp; This was no act.&nbsp; �I believe I shall ride ahead and find out what the issue may be.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sir Lanart nodded. �You are brave to do so, Lady Cora.&nbsp; I shall wait for you here with my guards.�&nbsp; He eyed her strangely for a brief second and then his face disappeared back into the cab and the blind was shut.&nbsp; She cursed him for being the spineless coward he was and spurred her white charger to the front of the line, coming to a stop beside Sir Aiden who was talking with Sir Jaylin Foster, former Steward of Sharford Castle.&nbsp; The captain appeared worn down, his eyes bloodshot.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What is going on?�&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sir Aiden pointed up ahead.&nbsp; �Look there, on the next hill over.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lady Cora shielded her eyes with her hands and looked off into the distance.&nbsp; It took a moment to find what he was pointing to but she soon did.&nbsp; The countess groaned at the sight.&nbsp; Horsemen were pouring out of the wood line and forming across the road up ahead.&nbsp; Hundreds of them....and in the center was a group of officers beneath a flag bearing a black tree in the center of an orange field.&nbsp; The banner of Wexford.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As she watched the lines gather horses galloped to and fro behind her.&nbsp; She twisted in the saddle and found Thorne speaking with a pair of scouts.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What shall we do?� The captain asked when he came back to her side. �We have more cavalry to the north and south.&nbsp; Less than a league away and approaching fast.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Angrily she snapped on him. �What would you have us do, fool?&nbsp; Surrender?&nbsp; Surely you did not think we could walk all the way across Wexford without being found out?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He bowed his head to her in way of an apology.&nbsp; �I merely meant to ask what your orders were.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They were clearly in a bad way.&nbsp; Suddenly they found themselves outnumbered and surrounded in an enemy's territory.&nbsp; An enemy who would, if given the chance, kill them all first and then find out who they were later.&nbsp; She gazed upward and saw one of the problems.&nbsp; The crimson and black of her house was drawing them in like moths to a flame.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Secure the scorpion banners.&nbsp; Bring forth a half dozen of your best men and have one to carry a flag of truce.� She ordered, disgusted by the fear and weakness she sensed in both of them....no wonder they had all failed her so miserably.&nbsp; �You will stay here.&nbsp; I will ride forward and speak with them.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I would advise against it, Mistress.� Sir Jaylin Foster pressed in, his white hair and clean cloths now frazzled by days of non-stop running.&nbsp; �It is surely too dangerous.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Just being here is dangerous.&nbsp; If I cannot talk with them we may all end as crow's food in this field.�&nbsp; Sir Aiden was silent but Foster looked up nervously for the circling birds.&nbsp; She smiled wickedly then. �But since you are so concerned with my well being, Sir Jaylin, you may come with me to assure my safety.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Uh...y...yess, mistress.� He stammered, taken aback.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Captain Thorne, send someone back to tell Sir Lanart we have company.&nbsp; Inform him we will require a pair of his bodyguards to come forward....and they are to bring one of their pretty green flags with them.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�As you command, Ladyship.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She kneed her horse forward and brought it around to face Sir Aiden, �Take what few men we have left and form a perimeter around the carriage.&nbsp; If we should fall they will surely attack.&nbsp; In that case do whatever you deem best.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It went without saying there would be no hope of escape and they would all perish.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The escort was quickly formed and a flag of truce made while a pair of Sir Lanart's guards joined them at the head of the column, one carrying the silver aegis, crossed sabers and emerald green background of the Dukedom.&nbsp; With the countess in line with the others the group trotted out to midway distance up the road and halted.&nbsp; A moment later the small knot of Wexford officers came forward at a leisurely pace.&nbsp; They stopped only a lance length away.&nbsp; One of the knights, positioned in the center of the group, wore armor more ornate and gilded than the rest of them.&nbsp; He lifted his helmet and revealed a middle aged, tanned face wizened by years of warfare.&nbsp; His beard was trimmed down and peppered with gray, his head&nbsp; balding with short cropped hair around the sides.&nbsp; With cold eyes he stared down each one of them....until he saw the countess.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Are you Cora Golwyn of Sharford?� He asked in a deep yet smooth voice.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She glared back at him with an expression carved from stone even while her nerves jumped within her.&nbsp; For her to be recognized was most unexpected.&nbsp; In her dirty common dress she looked more like a tracker than a countess.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Come now.&nbsp; It is a simple question.� He said after he received no answer.&nbsp; �Are you the Lady Cora or not?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She stared down the knight for a moment then gave a gentle nod.&nbsp; �I am.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Allow me to name myself.� He dipped his gaze to her in deference of her rank.&nbsp; �I am Sir Geldon Paige, Master of the Horse, in the service of Lord Jordane of Wexford.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She arced her eyebrows to show some mild curiosity. �And how is Rowan the Red?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh, he is most anxious to met you.� Sir Geldon assured her in a leering tone.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I'm sure he is.�&nbsp; She was no fool.&nbsp; To meet him in person would be a death sentence....a long, slow death sentence.&nbsp; She had always heard of a boast Rowan Jordane was fond of making among his own court.&nbsp; It was said he would one day have Lady Cora brought to Birchwood Manor for dinner though he was not sure how he wanted her prepared.....boiled, baked or roasted.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The old knight glanced beyond her and her men to the carriage in the distance.&nbsp; �And I should trust that the Duke's brother is well?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Confusion began to burn within her.&nbsp; This was not the way she had expected this meeting to go.&nbsp; But her interest was piqued.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You know Sir Lanart travels with us?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Of course.� He said rather dismissively.&nbsp; �We have been expecting him to try returning home for quite a while.....but I had no idea until recently he would take a route this far south and you would be with him.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You seem to know much, Sir Geldon.� She stated.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His eyes fixed with a stark chill upon her.&nbsp; �I know you crossed our border without permission with near two hundred of your black guards and the same number of servants.&nbsp; I know you have the nerve to brazenly carry your own banners beside the flag of Loranth in OUR territory.�&nbsp; He paused to spit to the side as if the words which he was forming were leaving a bad taste in his mouth.&nbsp; �And I know you and Sir Lanart make for Knightsbridge where you intend to beg an audience with His Grace and claim grievance against the new Lord of Hargate.....or so I've been told.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He flicked a hand at one of the other knights who reached to his side and lifted a pair of severed heads into the air by their hair.&nbsp; The faces of the two men still held the same mix of surprise, fear and agony they had felt at the moment of their deaths.&nbsp; The countess frowned at the gruesome sight.&nbsp; Sir Jaylin heaved while the Lorantine guardsmen and the other soldiers stiffened.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�And who are they supposed to be?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Two Sharford dogs we captured earlier.� Sir Geldon explained.&nbsp; �They were noisy, easily taken and squealed after only a few sticks with a hot iron.&nbsp; If this is the quality of your scouts then I should say there is no wonder Ansyl Wellock lost an army in the Western Wood.&nbsp; But here, they are your men.&nbsp; You should have them back.�&nbsp; Sir Geldon gave the knight holding the heads a quick gesture.&nbsp; He swung his arm and let the two heads fly up in an arc to land on the ground between the two groups.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You do not know everything, Master Paige.� Lady Cora said icily.&nbsp; She was off balance and at a disadvantage.&nbsp; A position she clearly did not like being in.&nbsp; �Sir Lanart has given me and my escorts safe conduct through to Knightsbridge.&nbsp; No further harm may come to me or anyone who rides with me upon pain of death.� 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes...well.&nbsp; I'm afraid your journey to Knightsbridge will have to be delayed.�&nbsp; It was then that Sir Geldon sneered like a predator.&nbsp; �We have been sent to escort you and Sir Lanart back to Birchwood Manor.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She could feel the men around her come on their guard.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You intend to divert us?�&nbsp; She asked while watching him warily.&nbsp; �On what authority?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�On the authority of His Grace, the Duke of Loranth.� Sir Geldon exclaimed, suddenly looking as if his prey had been snatched from right in front of him. �By HIS order you and your men are to be given every accommodation.&nbsp; You have been out of touch for a long while, Lady Cora.&nbsp; Events here and in the east have changed dramatically in the last few months....besides, as I have already said....Rowan is MOST anxious to meet you....over dinner.�  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 











 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the days that followed his arrival at Sharford Castle Jack did little more than work.&nbsp; There were many things that needed attending to and Axel certainly did his part but,&nbsp; as the sentient computer program had so adeptly pointed out, there were things which only Jack Dullman could do.&nbsp; And he soon found out there were some of the hardest things he had ever done.....like signing the death warrant for five knights who wore the black armor of the Sharford Household Guard.&nbsp; They were hanged from a gallows built within the castle walls with little ceremony.&nbsp; They had been officers in charge of the prisoner pens which had accompanied the Lady Cora on her fateful ride north toward Raven's Forge.&nbsp; Jack held them completely responsible for the torture, rape and murder of dozens, if not hundreds, of Hargate civilians who had been caught trying to flee from the approach of the Golwyn army.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was a hard thing to do.&nbsp; He knew they were merely programs in an elaborate simulation but still they seemed as real as any person he had ever met in the real world.&nbsp; But then he remembered looking down at the girls and young women who had been raped without mercy and left to strangle slowly in sets of wooden stocks.&nbsp; They had seemed just as real.&nbsp; The look on their pale dead faces, burned into his mind, was what continued to haunt him.&nbsp; And it helped push his quill pen when he signed the warrants.&nbsp; It would serve as a deterrent to others, not only to those he occupied but to his own forces that such actions against people who could not defend themselves would not be tolerated.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Other things were less hard.&nbsp; Jack had found out the Countess Golwyn had placed many harsh restrictions on commerce and travel.&nbsp; Jack was no economic expert but even he knew some basics and releasing those restrictions and lowering the crushing tax burdens carried by the people of the land was a logical step.&nbsp; The hope was within no time trade and manufacturing would start up again in Sharford.&nbsp; The first signs were already promising.&nbsp; After the initial shock of the conquest faded a certain tentative peace settled over the land and the village markets became more packed with goods and foodstuffs every day.&nbsp; Former Sharford soldiers were reformed into details to clean up refuse within the village, others were assigned to paint and refurbish many of the buildings which had been abandoned or fell into neglect during the long winter of Cora Golwyn's rule.&nbsp; Returning peasants were welcomed back to their homes and shops had begun to reopen.&nbsp; Sharford was starting to bustle again as it had not done in years.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But always in the back of his mind there was the question.&nbsp; What to do now?&nbsp; Day and night thoughts crossed his mind on what his options were.&nbsp; They were limited to say the least but something would have to be done.&nbsp; Even he could see that.&nbsp; Reports were beginning to come in from the frontier regions of Wexford and Devonwick patrols coming close to the borders of Sharford.&nbsp; That was not good.&nbsp; Not good at all.&nbsp; Something was brewing and a feeling he had not had since marching out of Hargate Castle on the long road south was creeping up the back of his neck.&nbsp; War was coming again and soon.&nbsp; A fight which he knew would be different.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One which he knew he should try to avoid.&nbsp; And he found the more he thought on it the more he just wished it all to be over.&nbsp; He had been the cause of so much death and pain since he arrived.&nbsp; Medieval World Version 12, or wherever he was, would have probably been a much nicer program if he had never showed up.&nbsp; He had heard some whisper of the Goddess and the Abyss behind his back.&nbsp; Even Ayla had talked of it back at Hargate.&nbsp; He did not know or pretend to know of the belief system held by the sentient programs of this realm but if there was such a place as a binary heaven then Alwyn Kessel was looking down on him laughing his ass off at the things Jack was now putting himself through.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sir Jeremy Ross returned to the castle sooner than expected.&nbsp; His cavalry had pushed through the southern lands subduing the last resistance to Hargate control.&nbsp; Only a pair of garrisons had decided to fight briefly.&nbsp; A third had killed the officer in command who had been so bold as to demand they fight to the last man under the Golwyn banner.&nbsp; They had come out offering Sir Jeremy the knight's head wrapped up in the red and black ensign as a sign of goodwill.&nbsp; The fighting was now truly over.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once they were all together again Jack invited Lady Lynette, Axel, Sir Jeremy, and the interim Master-of-the-Foot, an old, wispy haired captain named Sir Reginald Butler to dinner.&nbsp; Duck was on the menu and there was just small talk for conversation. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jack swallowed the last mouthful of dinner from his plate and leaned back in his chair.&nbsp; He took a splash of honey ale to wash it down and looked around to the others at the table.&nbsp; The were all finished and appeared well satisfied with the meal.&nbsp; Axel was his typical stoic self.&nbsp; Lynette was being proper and demure.&nbsp; Sir Jeremy looked happy to get something other than field rations into his belly.&nbsp; And Sir Reginald was smashed though, to his credit, he at least had the good sense to be quiet and reserved.&nbsp; It was now time for the real meeting to begin.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Okay, Ktari, pack up and get out of here.&nbsp; The grownups have to talk.� He told his squire and she dutifully obeyed.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was gone in a flash taking the other servants with her.&nbsp; Jack glanced at each of them in turn. �I've brought you all here to tell you something very important.&nbsp; I have thought long and hard about what we have to do next.&nbsp; There have been some tough times along the road so far but nothing we haven't been able to overcome together...and so I feel like I owe you guys an explanation.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They all nodded their agreement.&nbsp; Even Sir Reginald who was barely conscious.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�When I first got downloaded into this program I thought I would only be here for about a day or so....and that day has turned into months and still I don't know if it's possible for me to go home.� Jack sighed. �I wouldn't even begin to understand how to get back.&nbsp; Or if it was safe.&nbsp; I think Cora Golwyn has some, if not all, of those answers for me.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�But she got away, Jack.� Axel chimed in.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh I know....and it's not your fault, Jerry.�&nbsp; Sir Jeremy was looking haggard as if he were personally taking the blame for not finding and stopping the Lady Cora from escaping. �But I've come to realize without her I may never be able to get out of this program...� Axel looked as if he were ready to protest until Jack quickly added �...and I'm okay with that.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For a long moment there was silence at the table as the understanding of what he had said sank in.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Are you sure?� Axel finally asked. �There are other ways to find the answers we seek.&nbsp; There is Sir Olric and the woman Varisa.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�The only thing Olric has is a few stories about how creepy the Bitch-in-Black was.&nbsp; And as for Varisa?&nbsp; She's gonna have to pay for what she did to Alwyn but other than that I don't have the stomach to do the things necessary to make her talk.&nbsp; I just don't.&nbsp; I'm sorry.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Slowly Axel nodded his acceptance.&nbsp; �As you wish, my friend.�&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�So if I ain't able to go home then I'll just have to stay and make the best of it.&nbsp; I've decided to try and negotiate a settlement with the other houses of Loranth for a peaceful withdrawal from Sharford.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Axel frowned, Sir Jeremy bristled angrily and Lynette looked as if she had been kicked in the gut.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You can't, my lord....�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�There is still too much danger....�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Here it goes... �And if that is successful I'm going to give Hargate back to Lady Jane.&nbsp; I'm going to abdicate.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With that even Sir Reginald got into it. �Bloody hell man!&nbsp; Have ya lost your fuckin mind?!�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jack sank back into his chair calmly as the four bombarded him with their concerns.&nbsp; It wasn't unexpected.&nbsp; He knew this was going to be their reaction.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�So what else can we do?�&nbsp; He asked them once they had all worn themselves out. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sir Jeremy pounded his fist on the table. �We could stand where we are, my lord, and fight if need be.&nbsp; We have done far more than anyone would have thought possible and we could do more still.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jack shook his head.&nbsp; �With what?&nbsp; We bled Hargate dry just to get here.&nbsp; What more do we have.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�We have what is now the finest territorial army in all of Loranth.� Ross continued to argue.&nbsp; �And the bravest.&nbsp; I have little doubt of that.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Really?� Jack countered.&nbsp; �They may be the best and the bravest but they're also spread out pretty damn thin.&nbsp; We've got seven hundred in the garrison here and another six hundred in outposts and forts all over the rest of the territory so what does that leave us?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ross set his jaw. �The cavalry.�&nbsp; He uttered with pride.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yeah.� Jack nodded.&nbsp; �The cavalry.&nbsp; About six hundred horsemen to fight....how many would you say the rest of Loranth could put together?&nbsp; Ten....twenty thousand men?&nbsp; Not good odds.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Jack, you have a point.� Axel spoke up in the wake of the Master-of-the-Horse.&nbsp; �But there must be something else we can do.&nbsp; To just leave Sharford at the mercy of the other houses would be, I believe, a grave mistake.&nbsp; After they have plundered her and butchered her people they may well allow the Countess Golwyn to return.&nbsp; And then we would be back where we started.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�And we would be without you, my lord.� Lady Lynette Hunter interjected. �You cannot consider abdicating.&nbsp; Please.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sir Reginald hiccuped and all eyes turned to him. �Aye.� He slurred, pointing to the others with a slim finger. �What they said.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Lord of Hargate took a slow, steady sip of his drink, licking his lips as he finished.&nbsp; �You know, ever since I got downloaded into this program it's been nothing but drama.&nbsp; I used to daydream about a time when I would find myself in a situation like this with all the action and adventure I could never have in my normal quiet life....but I've come to realize that I miss that normal quiet life a whole lot more than I thought I would.&nbsp; I'm starting to get worn out by this shit and I don't know what else to do.&nbsp; It's my hope that maybe, just maybe, if I can't go home then I can at least have a little solitude.&nbsp; Let's face it.&nbsp; Our little run is over.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�After all that has happened do you truly believe you may still find solitude?&nbsp; You may think so but there you are wrong.� Axel told him.&nbsp; �Cora Golwyn did not act alone.&nbsp; We know this from Ayla.&nbsp; There is someone who wants you dead very badly and as yet we know not who.&nbsp; If you give back Sharford then you lose a potential asset you will never recover and if you abdicate then you open yourself for easy attack.&nbsp; You may as well sign your own death warrant.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�If it brings peace then that's a chance I'm willing to take.� He told them as they sat in stunned silence.&nbsp; He remembered back to the book he had been reading and thought of what it had said about Hargate.&nbsp; �Lady Jane was ruler of Hargate before I came along and she stepped aside just for me.&nbsp; She is a good woman and deserves better than that.&nbsp; Lyn, Jerry, Reginald.&nbsp; You served her before I got here and you can do so when I'm gone.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�But what if we want to continue serving you?� Lynette asked and the tone in her voice was heartbreaking.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Perhaps we should discuss this further.� Axel said.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jack put down his glass and smiled faintly. �I don't think there's any use in that.&nbsp; The decision's already been made.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Let's not be too hasty.� Axel countered. �This is a serious matter.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It's not a discussion anymore....it's a done deal.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A worried expression formed on the program assistant's narrow face. �Why?&nbsp; Why would you say that?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I sent the first envoys out three days ago.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lynette nearly broke into tears.&nbsp; Jeremy Ross simmered with anger.&nbsp; And Axel placed his head in his hands.&nbsp; �Oh, damn it, Jack.&nbsp; What have you done?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Even if the question was rhetorical Jack answered it, refusing to give anyone the last word on this. �Because it's what I thought was best.&nbsp; I thought you guys trusted me?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�We do.� Axel told him with a stern glare.&nbsp; �We just hope that trust hasn't doomed us all.�











 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Birchwood Manor sat atop a crossroads only a half league from the bustling village of Durbinshire like a great guardian troll who would let none pass without them falling under it's monstrous glare.&nbsp; A large outer ring of packed earthen berms and watchtowers with soldiers standing vigil in great numbers made up the outer defenses while the inner compound was castle-like in all but name.&nbsp; The manor's curtain walls were stone several feet in thickness and the tops were crenelated with murder holes and platforms where catapult artillery could hurl heavy rounded shot at an approaching enemy.&nbsp; Inside the spacious inner compound were houses and barracks, stables, mills, workshops and smithies situated around the main dwelling which was a huge four story wood and white plaster home.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The site was impressive to all.....except to Cora Golwyn.&nbsp; When the carriage came to a stop in front of the main house she took Sir Jaylin Foster's offered hand without thought and climbed down the side steps to view her surroundings with little emotion.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�So this is where the bastard lives.� She muttered under her breath where only Sir Jaylin could here.&nbsp; The white haired man winced at the comment.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Wexford household troops with their orange and black sashes were everywhere and a lieutenant stepped forward to greet them.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good day, Countess.� The young knight said after a quick glance at Foster.&nbsp; �You are expected. Right this way.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The lieutenant walked inside and Lady Cora followed with what remained of her escort in tow, Captain Thorne and a half squad of veteran black armored guards.&nbsp; At last count there had been only a hundred and eighty of her men left of the thousands she had once held in thrall.&nbsp; Those few had encamped a league away near an isolated grove well separated from gathering Wexford troops who, no doubt, would still be holding grudges.&nbsp; The hostility between the two powers had been long and smoldering so who could blame a vengeful Wexford officer for seeking to even the score with what remained of the luckless Sharford army. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They were taken up several flights of stairs and down a pair of corridors until finally they came to a door where a detachment of&nbsp; soldiers awaited.&nbsp; The lieutenant conferred with the officer in charge of the detachment and after a moment and barely hid sneer at the countess he opened the door and went inside.&nbsp; For some time they waited for the officer to return with permission for them to enter like unwanted guests at a social gathering.&nbsp; The countess was calm on the outside yet inside she fumed.&nbsp; It was just another slight in a series of insults she had received since Sir Geldon Paige had met them.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finally the knight returned.&nbsp; He held open the door, �You may enter.� And he stepped aside to let them pass.&nbsp; Only Lady Cora, Sir Jaylin and Sir Aiden entered into what must have been an informal dinning area with a round central table and a massive fireplace in one corner.&nbsp; Around the table were a group of perhaps a dozen men in their court finery.&nbsp; Lady Cora soon picked out Sir Lanart for he was the largest man among them.&nbsp; His dark, curly hair flowed freely over his shoulders and back and his beard was now closely trimmed, something she knew he had neglected during their flight from Sharford Castle.&nbsp; His cloths were clean, blue silk breeches and tunic with labor intensive silver thread embroidery on the cuffs and hem.&nbsp; Immediately her stomach churned at the sight of him.&nbsp; Sir Lanart was a fop who couldn't button his own pants without a servant to do so for him.&nbsp; But she suppressed her distaste as the duke's younger brother looked up from the table, met her gaze and smiled.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Countess!� He exclaimed as he pushed aside a pair of courtiers to greet her. �My dear but you are stunning as always.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She did indeed look stunning.&nbsp; Her hair had been washed and styled by Lorri and the burgundy dress she wore was the finest of those remaining to her.&nbsp; He grabbed her by the shoulders and kissed her on the cheek and it was all she could do not to stiffen and slap him when he did so.&nbsp; She managed a gentle smile.&nbsp; �You are too kind by half, sir.&nbsp; It does my heart good to see you well and in proper spirits.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She had seen nothing of him since Sir Geldon had stopped their column.&nbsp; One of the first things the Wexford Master-of-the-Horse had done was separate the two of them.&nbsp; He had done so by offering Sir Lanart the use of his pavilion for the duration of their journey and a seat at his well stocked table.&nbsp; Sir Lanart had taken the offer on the spot.&nbsp; His only alternative would have been to stay in his stifling hot carriage and eat dried beef and biscuits for the remainder of the trip.&nbsp; But Lady Cora's invitation to join in any comfort was ominously omitted.&nbsp; From that point on Lady Cora saw her one hope for survival fade with every passing day and she was helpless to prevent it.&nbsp; She had tried to meet with Sir Lanart but it was no use.&nbsp; Sir Geldon's pavilion had been turned into an armed camp unto itself and no one was allowed to met with him.&nbsp; She tried to send him countless letters explaining her need for his continued assistance and warning him of Wexford treachery only to receive just one in reply.&nbsp; A brief scribble from Sir Lanart to assure her he had not forgotten his mission and a dismissal of any worries over his safety she might have.&nbsp; What made things worse was she and her men were purposely kept out of touch and in the dark for the entire journey.&nbsp; No one would speak to her or tell her what was going on.&nbsp; For the two days after arriving at their current camp she had tried to see someone, anyone but to no avail.&nbsp; The quiet waiting for the summons to Birchwood Manor had tested even her steel nerves.&nbsp; But now they were back together and answers would have to be forthcoming.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As if he could suddenly read minds Sir Lanart wrapped an arm around her and began to walk with her back to the circle of men. �Dear woman, I am so very sorry about my lack of attention to you but duties have been thrust upon me of a sudden.&nbsp; Great happenings all around I should say.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The man was excited.&nbsp; It was the first time she had seen him so and the countess ignored the chubby hand low on her waist, his fingers resting on the top of her buttocks.&nbsp; If someone other than him, someone she had not needed had placed his hand there she would have had the man flayed alive and buried up to his neck in salt.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What great happenings?� She asked, sparing a glance at the others around the table.&nbsp; Sir Geldon had hinted at something in the east at their first meeting but had not elaborated.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Though I have heard few details it would seem there may be war....and not this regional nonsense.&nbsp; Real war.&nbsp; Svinland has fallen into chaos and Aladar and Imberland are threatening to invade.&nbsp; If they do Turis may surely follow suit.&nbsp; With half the continent in such an uproar Cambria and Umbria have decided it to be a good time to harass our northern borders.&nbsp; Silvan has marched the greater part of the Levy and troops from the east to handle these incursions.&nbsp; Were it not for this crisis I believe he would have come directly to deal with this problem of ours.�&nbsp; Then his excitement quickly turned to shock. �No!&nbsp; My dear, forgive me.&nbsp; I have been so caught up in my own affairs I had forgotten to tell you....�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Tell me what?� The countess frowned.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Lord Dullman has taken Sharford.� He blurted out. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The countess exhaled, her brow furrowed with the stress of the news.&nbsp; It was not unexpected.&nbsp; Sharford Castle had served the purpose of keeping the attention away from their escape but it's fall was still like a physical blow.&nbsp; She had but to think of Jack Dullman taking up residence in what was her home and her blood began to boil.&nbsp; �How?� She managed to ask.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Your Lord Commander had the good sense to surrender after barely a day's siege.� Came a smooth voice.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cora looked to the voice and met face to face with a handsome, broad shouldered man with medium length coppery hair and a gaze which seemed to pierce right through her.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Lord Jordane?� She inquired of him.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He nodded with the barest flash of a boyish smile. �At your service.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She curtsied gracefully yet her eyes burned with the first sight of her mortal enemy. �It is good to make your acquaintance at last though I find your assessment of my Lord Commander to be wanting.&nbsp; Olric Dunsen should still be fighting as we speak.&nbsp; He was well appointed in my castle.&nbsp; Had he held there would still be a glimmer of hope for me to return with help.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before he could voice an answer Sir Lanart grabbed her by the arm, his excitement flowing again.&nbsp; �Your glimmer of hope still prevails, my lady.&nbsp; It would seem my brother has already heard of the depredations of this Lord Dullman and wishes us to dispatch him once and for all for his crimes.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now this was a turn of events.&nbsp; She observed Rowan's bulky form become restless.&nbsp; It was subtle but there none-the-less.&nbsp; Lord Wexford was discomfited by what Sir Lanart was saying.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Is this why we were brought here instead of being allowed to continue to Knightsbridge?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lanart grinned.&nbsp; �Indeed it was.&nbsp; Silvan has sent forth a special decree that whatever actions necessary be taken in squashing this little rebellion and liberating both Hargate and Sharford.&nbsp; He has authorized a call to the banners and a forming of an army to bring this situation to resolution.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There had been many times since leaving her castle she had wondered if she were riding to her death and in recent days that demise had felt closer than ever.&nbsp; She had never thought to live as long as she had already done and even if death was expected it most certainly was not welcome.&nbsp; And she did not fool herself.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first few seconds after meeting Rowan Jordane she knew that if it were up to him she would long ago have been killed in some suitably horrible fashion.&nbsp; Something that might have even made her own twisted imagination proud.&nbsp; But fortunately Rowan the Red did not control events, not even in his own home.&nbsp; Perhaps there was indeed some hope left if she played her cards right.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Please tell me you do not jest, Sir Lanart?� She asked, her ample cleavage heaving with every labored breath as she began to swoon in his arms.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fat man laughed.&nbsp; �No jest, my lady.&nbsp; My brother tells me he sends a force of two thousand from the ranks of the Levy for me to lead.&nbsp; They cross the River Gladstone into Wexford even now.&nbsp; It is to be the core of the Army of Western Loranth.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�And who is to lead this army?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lanart's joyous mood failed a bit.&nbsp; �I had thought to be Lord High Commander on my own but Silvan, in his wisdom, believes me to be too much of a novice at military affairs.&nbsp; He has asked Lord Jordane to take the mantle.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now there was true irony for you.&nbsp; Rowan and Cora had fought each other for a decade.&nbsp; Now he was to be responsible for retaking Sharford and returning it to her.&nbsp; An unsettling hush descended on the room as the two leaders of their respective houses became locked in a stare.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�My Lord Jordane,� Cora said finally. �It cheers me to see after so many years of strife we can still come together in common cause.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rowan watched her for a moment, contemplating what to say.&nbsp; When he finally did speak his tone was sober and determined, completely lacking the venom she saw in his stare.&nbsp; �Countess, it is my mandate to accomplish this task before us by any means at my disposal and so I shall.&nbsp; Despite our differences we seem to find a foe we agree upon for the moment.&nbsp; Let us take advantage of this while we can.� 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was a universal, though barely audible, sigh of relief from those at the table, including Lanart Brassey.&nbsp; Apparently they had all been holding their breath.&nbsp; The bitterness was deep between them but it seemed from this first meeting they had buried it for the time being.&nbsp; They closed with one another and Rowan gave her a very formal bow.&nbsp; She turned her head to the side, lowered her eyes to him in gratitude and curtsied to show her acknowledgment of his greater authority.&nbsp; It was a fine bit of acting.











 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sir Geldon Paige waited patiently until Rowan came storming down the hall.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Didn't go as planned?� He asked, falling in at his side as his lord and master entered into his quarters.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Afraid not.� He muttered as he moved immediately to a side bar and poured himself a cup of something to drink.&nbsp; �The witch still breaths.�&nbsp; He took a gulp and tossed his head back, letting the blazing liquid slide down his throat.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Unfortunate things do happen, my lord.&nbsp; There could be an accident or some......�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Lord of Wexford held up his hand. �Stop there.&nbsp; Say no more and clear your heart of such thoughts for I have had them aplenty and find no way to act upon them as yet without taking the blame.&nbsp; Lanart sees fit to kiss her arse and as long as he does we have no recourse but to tolerate her presence here.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Geldon grunted. �Well if it be any consolation I have never seen the countess as vulnerable as she is now.&nbsp; Were it not for the duke's brother she would already be sleeping in the dungeon.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rowan walked over to lean against a dormant fireplace.&nbsp; He placed his arm and his drink on the bare mantel and faced his Master-of-the-Horse. �Ask my uncle how vulnerable she can be and if he were alive today instead of rotting in the grave she put him in he might would tell you.&nbsp; I'll grant you she is a pretty thing and looks helpless enough but beware.&nbsp; Looks are very deceiving.&nbsp; Beneath that plump bosom lies the cold blooded, calculating heart of a demon straight out of the Abyss.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�So what must we do?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Exactly as we should.� Rowan told him. �We shall gather our forces and crush this lord of Hargate, taking back Sharford in the bargain.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was a little bit of shock in Sir Geldon's voice. �We are to retake Sharford and give it back to HER?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rowan barked a short laugh. �Of course not.&nbsp; I read the commission given me very carefully.&nbsp; We must capture Sharford and end the reign of&nbsp; Jack Dullman.&nbsp; His Grace never said anything about placing Cora Golwyn back in charge.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Geldon thought of that for a moment then grinned wickedly. �I take it you failed to mention that flaw to anyone yet?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rowan took a sip of his drink and shrugged innocently. �What flaw?&nbsp; I see no flaw.&nbsp; I see only what the duke bids me do as Lord High Commander.�&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That answer brought a hearty laugh from Master Paige. �Well said, my lord.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Lord of Wexford then leaned in closer. �But be on your guard still, Geldon.&nbsp; These are treacherous times we live in.&nbsp; Soon we will have men from the Fyns, Devonwick and Cardin running about....not to mention a division of the Levy.&nbsp; We shall go along and do our duty as men of Loranth and one day, when this deed is done and Lord Dullman is no more, Lanart Brassey will pack his things and return to court....and we shall have our turn with the fair Cora.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes, my lord.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It is a shame really.� Rowan said wistfully after finishing his drink. �We stand here planning his end yet I believe I owe Lord Dullman a great debt.&nbsp; He crushed Cora Golwyn completely.&nbsp; If for no other reason I would be forever grateful to him just for that....but he chased her all the way here and now I can begin to plan my revenge on her in my own good time.&nbsp; I should thank him for that most of all.�













 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lady Cora returned to her camp and noticed the group of horses and the men waiting with them almost right away.&nbsp; They were different than her own.&nbsp; They were clean for one, and nowhere near as ragged.&nbsp; Their cloths were more of the eastern style with tassels and wide cuffs.&nbsp; Their hats bore several feathers in the band instead of a single one.&nbsp; Just like Sir Lanart.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I think we have company.� She said and Jaylin Foster looked to them as their coach and four passed.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Soldiers of Knightsbridge.� He surmised nervously. �I wonder who they bring?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�We shall find out soon.�&nbsp; She answered, her sudden wariness remaining well hidden.&nbsp; Perhaps it was nothing at all.&nbsp; Maybe just a messenger.&nbsp; But there was a feeling of dread that began to take hold in the pit of her stomach at the thought of who had come to see her at such a late hour.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The carriage stopped in the center of the camp and the countess disembarked.&nbsp; She waved both Foster and&nbsp; Captain Thorne away and approached her tent with trepidation.&nbsp; Lorri was waiting at the entrance.&nbsp; Her head was lowered, her hands clasped in front of her.&nbsp; It was her usual pose of submission.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Forgive me, my lady,� The buxom slave said without looking up. �You have visitors.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�They're inside already?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes, my lady.&nbsp; They refused to wait outside as they were asked.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�And you couldn't keep them out?&nbsp; Where were the guards?�&nbsp; The tent she had was the largest in the encampment, borrowed from stores of surplus supplies reluctantly given over to them by their hosts.&nbsp; It was better than sleeping under the stars or in a makeshift shelter but it was nowhere near the size of the pavilion she had to leave behind.&nbsp; It was, however, her home.&nbsp; Whoever had gone inside had breached hospitality and her privacy by entering without her permission.&nbsp; It would take either a fool or someone supremely confident of their position to do such a thing. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The ire in the countess's tone was unmistakable.&nbsp; The slave tried to explain.&nbsp; �I told the guards to allow them to enter.&nbsp; They bear the mark.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cora's stomach dropped away from her.&nbsp; She looked to Lorri who crumbled under her stare, then to the tent.&nbsp; This was a moment she knew would come though it was always her hope it would not come quite this soon.&nbsp; As if there weren't enough complications in her life.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Leave me.� She told her slave.&nbsp; �I will deal with you later.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Instinctively Lorri turned away but stopped.&nbsp; �I have done no wrong.�&nbsp; She said, the defiance in her tone was clear.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cora moved with lightning speed, grabbed a handful of her brown curls and twisted her head back.&nbsp; �How dare you.� She whispered into her ear, fresh rage boiling out of her soul.&nbsp; �No matter what you may think I still control you.&nbsp; Don't ever forget and don't ever defy me again, you useless bitch, or by the Goddess I will watch you die ten thousand deaths.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lorri whimpered but she did nothing to defend herself.&nbsp; Her hands went down to her sides and her face screwed up as if she were ready to cry. �Yes, my lady.�&nbsp; She said finally and the countess released her.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Get out of my sight.� 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And the pretty slave fled. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now alone in front of the tent she hesitated.&nbsp; As Countess of Sharford she had ruled with an iron fist and relished the fact she had no one to answer to for any of her actions, no matter how cruel or unusual.&nbsp; But as she looked at the flaps of the tent she realized that for the first time in ten years she would have to report to someone and if her actions were seen as lacking they could have dire consequences.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With a deep breath she went inside.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Hello, sisters.� Cora said, pushing all emotions from her voice.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A lantern fitted with a single large wick candle lit the interior.&nbsp; The weak light was enough to give form to the three women who were inside with her.&nbsp; One was seated in the chair beside her cot while the other two, similar in appearance and dress, stood careful watch from behind.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The woman seated locked eyes on her.&nbsp; �Countess Golwyn.� She acknowledged.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lady Leandra Vale rose from her seat and walked over to her, observing the raven haired beauty with great curiosity.&nbsp; Cora became as demure as she could.&nbsp; Her eyes dropped to the wooden planks of the temporary floor.&nbsp; �Lady Vale, it has been such a long time.&nbsp; It is good to see you again.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Leandra's gaze hardened and her voice came out cold. �Save your act with me, sister.&nbsp; I will have none of it.&nbsp; Report as you were taught.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cora looked up and straightened her spine and the thin cover of compliance faded away.&nbsp; �If that is what you wish.&nbsp; I beg to report I have yet to complete my mission.&nbsp; There were a few...problems.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The blond scoffed.&nbsp; �Problems?&nbsp; I should think catastrophes would be a better word to use.&nbsp; You have failed miserably and that is why we have been sent out here to this Goddess forsaken wilderness.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You were sent to assist me?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Leandra laughed derisively.&nbsp; �No.&nbsp; You are to assist us.&nbsp; Your failure is known in Knightsbridge and His Grace is most displeased.&nbsp; You have been a sad disappointment to him yet he means to give you a second chance.&nbsp; Help us complete your mission and the Duke will not send you back to Desalon.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Despite it being a warm evening a sudden chill ran down Cora's back.&nbsp; �I must thank His Grace for his forbearance.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Thank him by sending Lord Dullman's head on a platter.&nbsp; Is it really so hard to do?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Lord Dullman has proved to be harder prey than I thought.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�He is of the Chosen.� Leandra told her. �They do prove more stout or at least so I am told.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It is both a gift and a curse.&nbsp; I assure you.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Leandra smiled but it was devoid of warmth. �Yes.&nbsp; You would know, wouldn't you?&nbsp; And what do you have to say for Ayla and Varisa?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cora looked to the other women standing there.&nbsp; They stood silent and still, watching and listening.&nbsp; Just like the women in question would have done.&nbsp; �Ayla was lost at Hargate Castle during my first attempt to complete my mission.&nbsp; I don't know what happened to her.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I do.� Leandra informed her icily. �She was captured and interrogated.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cora's brow wrinkled. �How do you come to know this?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�A prisoner told us of your bungled farce.� Leandra answered. �Though some of the details are lacking I can piece together that Ayla told of your planned campaign into Hargate.&nbsp; She gave them sufficient warning so they were able to counter you at Raven's Forge.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Countess was stunned.&nbsp; �Did she tell all of what she knew?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Not all.&nbsp; The Order's presence in Loranth remains a secret....for now.&nbsp; What of Varisa?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�She was in an engagement only a league from Sharford Castle.&nbsp; I received a report she had very nearly killed Lord Dullman but was unable to complete her task.�&nbsp; Cora remembered the afternoon which seemed like a far distant memory when the injured scout had come to tell her of the battle at White Tavern.&nbsp; She had been exultant until she learned Varisa couldn't finish her work.&nbsp; She had murdered the scout where he knelt for bringing her the bad news.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Did she survive?� Leandra prodded. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I know not.&nbsp; Once I knew the battle to be lost I thought only of getting Sir Lanart to safety before the Hargate forces surrounded us.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You did not think to stay and continue the fight.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I will not be trapped like an animal and besieged.� Cora said hotly. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lady Vale scowled back.&nbsp; �I see.&nbsp; So you sacrificed your castle, your lands and your people to save yourself....and Sir Lanart?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I did what was best.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Best for whom, Lady Cora?&nbsp; Two thousand men of the Levy are within a few days march of here.&nbsp; Had you stayed put and held out we would have been able to come and relieve you.&nbsp; Sharford would have been saved and you would not be a refugee.&nbsp; And if that weren't bad enough Lord Dullman's power continues to grow.&nbsp; Already the people of Hargate are fanatical about him.&nbsp; Sharford will soon follow if we do not end this soon.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I tried.� Cora snarled hotly.&nbsp; �I did as I was told to do and went to Hargate.&nbsp; I took him on my own and nearly made him use the failsafe but we were discovered.&nbsp; Varisa and I barely escaped.&nbsp; And then I tried again using all the force I could muster.&nbsp; But this time we were led into a trap and I lost three thousand men before I got back to Sharford.&nbsp; And even then I tried a third time.&nbsp; I ordered Varisa to set a trap for him just as his men had done for us.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�And you failed again.&nbsp; I suppose you have someone to blame?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Blame fortune or luck.&nbsp; Blame the cowards and fools that served me.&nbsp; But do not blame me for I have made every effort to gain the failsafe and kill him as I was ordered.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lady Vale edged closer until the two women were nose to nose.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Your stupidity astounds me, countess.&nbsp; How long did you have this man in your grasp?&nbsp; An hour?&nbsp; Two?&nbsp; You mean to tell me with all the knowledge of pain and torture you possess you couldn't make him use his failsafe in that time?&nbsp; You have single handedly squandered the greatest opportunity we may ever have of stopping Lord Dullman and using his knowledge.&nbsp; Now we must destroy him.&nbsp; Aid us well and pray that we do so swiftly and with little problem.&nbsp; Your fate hinges on it.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Leandra abruptly walked out of the tent and the brunettes quickly followed leaving Cora standing in the middle of the floor speechless.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She stood there in silence for a time taking ease now that it was over.&nbsp; Once again she had avoided a death sentence.&nbsp; One which Lady Vale could have very easily pronounced and her two minions would have executed on the spot.&nbsp; Even so another sword hung over her head ready to drop with all the others if she made a misstep.&nbsp; There seemed to be an endless supply of dangers these days.&nbsp; After a moment to gather herself she pulled back a tent flap.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Summon Captain Thorne.� She told the nearest sentry.&nbsp; �I have need of him.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;









 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lorri entered the tent and knelt at Cora's feet.&nbsp; �You called for me, mistress?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes I did.�&nbsp; She said as she towered over her slave, her hands resting on her hips, volumes of coal black hair hanging loose about her shoulders.&nbsp; �Have you forgotten who I am?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The young woman hesitated a glance up and shook her head. �No, my lady.&nbsp; I have not forgotten.&nbsp; You are my lady and mistress and always will be.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Then why did you talk back to me earlier?�&nbsp; She sounded like a mother scolding a child. �You know I brook no disobedience in my slaves.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lorri's eyes sank to the ground.&nbsp; �I know not, my lady.&nbsp; I don't know what possessed me to do such a thing.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I know what it was.� Cora said as if the answer had suddenly dawned upon her. �It was a lack of respect.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No, my lady!&nbsp; Never!�&nbsp; Lorri protested.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But the countess would hear none of it.&nbsp; �Yes, I'm afraid so.&nbsp; There are many who feel since I have lost Sharford they may say and do with me as they will.&nbsp; They think because I have lost much of my authority I have also lost my power.&nbsp; As if I am no longer dangerous.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That's not true, my lady.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Worry not.&nbsp; You are not the first to treat me so.&nbsp; Sir Lanart dismisses me, Lady Vale bullies me, and Lord Jordane tolerates me while he waits to pounce...some patronize while others openly insult.&nbsp; But either way it makes no difference.&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon I will show them all the error in their ways.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was then she bent down and placed a gentle hand under Lorri's chin and lifted her face upward.&nbsp; She looked into the slave girl's soft brown eyes and smiled warmly.&nbsp; It was like a small part of the old Cora had returned to look upon a friend.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�If there is anyone in this wretched place I give even a half a care for it would be you, sweetheart.&nbsp; How long have we been her?&nbsp; Can you remember?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lorri's eyes welled up with tears.&nbsp; �I have long ago forgotten, my lady.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It seems like forever and a day.&nbsp; Does it not?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It does.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�And in all that time you have been the most faithful of any who have served me.&nbsp; We have been through much together....� In the flickering candlelight Lorri saw Cora's face suddenly harden to stone.&nbsp; She drew back her hand and stood.&nbsp; �....which makes what I am about to do all the more difficult.&nbsp; Captain!�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lorri twisted her head around to see Sir Aiden and a pair of his black armored guards step in.&nbsp; �My lady, please!�&nbsp; She exclaimed, her eyes wide with trepidation as the soldiers took her by her arms and lifted her to her feet.&nbsp; Rough hands began to pull at the simple homespun peasant's dress she wore tearing it to shreds.&nbsp; When the last of her clothing was gone and she stood among them naked the guards pulled her arms behind her and bound her wrists tightly together with coarse ropes.&nbsp; Once that was accomplished one of them placed her ankles together and bound them as well.&nbsp; When she was tied Lorri just stood there, trussed and helpless, the guards restraining her by her elbows,&nbsp; not saying a word or uttering a cry but looking to her mistress and silently pleading for mercy.&nbsp; None was forthcoming.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The countess stepped forward, hands back on her hips as she studied Lorri's firm, proportioned body.&nbsp; She cruelly scraped her nails against a defenseless nipple and watched the slave instinctively flinch.&nbsp; �I have been thinking upon your punishment and I have decided on something which may allow you to contemplate your disobedience here with me while I sleep.�&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her eyes darted over to Sir Aiden and she gave him a slight nod.&nbsp; The captain left but soon returned with a rectangular wooden box.&nbsp; The sides of the box were honeycombed with small holes.&nbsp; Four across and six down.&nbsp; Twenty four holes a side.&nbsp; The top of the box was in two halves with one larger hole cut into it's center.&nbsp; Lorri took one glance at it and her knees buckled.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Please forgive me, my lady!� She begged as her voice cracked and she began to cry.&nbsp; �I have wronged you!&nbsp; I am sorry!�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One of the men pulled the top off and another picked Lorri up from the ground and began to place her feet first into the small device.&nbsp; She began to struggle weakly but it was too late.&nbsp; It took a moment to force her in but they soon finished the task.&nbsp; She was placed into the box in the seated position with her knees drawn up to her chest, her body wedged in so tightly she could do nothing more than breath and move her fingers and toes.&nbsp; The guards slid the top pieces back into place and locked them down, forming a firm and inescapable seal around Lorri's neck.&nbsp; The slave whimpered as the first of the boards lined with rows of steel spikes were brought in.&nbsp; Each spike was needle sharp and almost two inches long.&nbsp; There were twenty four to a board in rows of six by four.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lorri began to breath rapidly as she watched the first board laid out.&nbsp; She looked back to the countess one last time. �No, mistress.&nbsp; Please make them stop.&nbsp; Don't let them do this to me.� She sobbed.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But Cora watched on coldly with a stark distance and dispassion, completely unmoved by her pleading.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At Sir Aiden's direction the two soldiers picked up the box with Lorri inside and positioned it above the spike covered board.&nbsp; They took a moment to line the spikes up with the holes on the bottom.&nbsp; As the poor girl inside became more and more frantic her breathing started to come in gasps as the expectation of pain and suffering grew.&nbsp; Without warning the men released the box and it settled down on the board, the spikes sliding through their corresponding holes drove deep into Lorri's buttocks and the soles of her feet.&nbsp; The brunette immediately drew in a sharp breath and let out with a blood curdling scream of pain.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The men locked the first board into place with metal hasps to secure it and brought out a second.&nbsp; Sir Aiden kicked the box onto it's side with his booted heal and the men set about putting the next board on.&nbsp; The holes were easier to match up with this one but Lorri's weight wouldn't be used to push it in to the point where it could be locked into place.&nbsp; One of the guards stood on the board until the wicked spikes sank into the girl's left side piercing her torso, thigh, calf and the side of her left breast.&nbsp; There were fresh screams in the tent as the box was set up and flipped onto it's other side.&nbsp; Once again a board was placed and a man had to stand on it to make the sharp metal sink into the victim's flesh.&nbsp; It was quickly locked on and the fourth board was brought out.&nbsp; This one was placed at Lorri's back and she begged her tormentors to stop amid screams of pain as it was fixed on just like the others.&nbsp; This one sent spikes through her back, arms and the palms of her tied hands.&nbsp; The last board was placed on the front of the box and those barbs injected themselves into her shins, some grating against bone.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All the boards were locked down and Lorri wailed pitifully as tears flowed down her cheeks.&nbsp; Her body was impaled but the needles were not deep enough to hit anything vital.&nbsp; She would live even though blood began to leak from the corners of the device.&nbsp; She would be badly injured but she would survive....and that brought a smile to Cora's face.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Pleeeease!� The tortured girl cried. �Don't leave me like this!� 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But the countess merely kicked the box, jolting it and causing Lorri to scream.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You shall stay like this all night while you think on the error of your ways.� The countess told her.&nbsp; �You will be released from it on the morrow....at a time of my choosing.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She sent the guards and Sir Aiden out and once they were gone she began to hum a tune to Lorri's moans while she pushed the torture box to one corner of the tent.&nbsp; She then began to remove her cloths until she stood naked in the candlelight wearing only her silver scorpion necklace.&nbsp; The countess gave one more look to the wooden box with Lorri's pretty head jutting out from the top of it.&nbsp; She waved at her as she pulled the covers back from her cot and slid beneath them. �Rest well, Lorri.&nbsp; I certainly shall.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�My lady, please!� Lorri bleated as Cora rolled over.&nbsp; She continued to groan and cry out in agony for the rest of the night but it did not bother the Countess of Sharford.&nbsp; She was soon fast asleep.&nbsp; Soothed by the sounds of the slow suffering of another unfortunate victim.
