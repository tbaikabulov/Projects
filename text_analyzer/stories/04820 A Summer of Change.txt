Part 1- Decisions������� 

&nbsp;

Tian Lung

He was off the moment he heard the
scream. As usual, Tian Lung was practicing alone in the woods when he heard the
cry of help. There�s only one reason why anyone would come to Mount
 Shi. Whoever they are, they were
going to the Temple of the Fire
Sun. As a disciple of the temple, Tian Lung had to help the travelers.

����������� 

Knowing the woods well, it took but
two cycles to reach the clearing. The scene that greeted him was not what he
expected. A man was dead on the ground with his companion standing beside him.
Wearing a bloodied leather vest and holding a long sword, the man was barely
standing. With a look, Tian Lung knew that the man will not last long in this
world. Facing the lone man were his attackers. 4 female fighters, each holding
a short sword had the man trapped. Luckily, the 4 female fighters were facing
away from Tian Lung. With a silent run, Tian Lung entered the melee. 

����������� 

The first female fighter was down
before she knew anything. Tian Lung threw a wicked punch to back of her head,
knocking her unconscious. With a flowing movement, he was onto the second
fighter. The fighter was surprised but recovered well. She stepped back,
swinging her sword in an arc to fend off her attacker. Tian Lung jumped a step
inside the swing. The fighter�s face showed fear before Tian Lung hit her
throat with a punch. She collapsed dead on the ground. The remaining 2 fighters
charged at him. Tian Lung stood motionlessly and waited. Once they were within
2 steps of him, he went right. The fighter he jumped into had to abruptly stop,
switching from offense to defense. She wasn�t quick enough. With a punch to her
face, Tian Lung staggered her. Then Tian Lung spins around. As expected, the
last fighter was charging his back. She stabbed the sword forward. With almost
inhuman speed, Tian Lung sidestepped the stroke. A knee to her guts doubles her
over, and then an overhand strike from his elbow broke her neck. The fighter he
staggered had recovered. With a death cry, she ran forward seeking to overwhelm
Tian Lung. It was a good idea�if he wasn�t so highly trained. Retreating, Tian
Lung waited for his chance. It came from a swing that went a little too high.
Ducking under the swing, Tian Lung attacked the fighter with a flurry of
punches. She was dead in seconds.

����������� 

Just like that, the fight was over.
Tian Lung looked over to the man. He was smiling�and then he collapsed.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Yu Sheng

����������� The abbot
was the highest ranked monk in the temple. A small, frail looking man, Abbot Lu
Seng looked every bit like an old man who has seemed 54 summers. He was the
oldest man in the temple, maybe the oldest man alive. He was also a man Yu
Sheng respected, which is why this will be so hard.

&nbsp;

�Abbot, I recommend that we refuse the offer.� 

�I see.� The abbot sat on his chair looking at Yu Sheng with
his piercing black eyes. �Why would you say no, Master Yu?�

Yu Sheng stood before the abbot and answered immediately,
�Duke Hatak seeks our aid because he knows that he is weak. Without us, his
rebellion will fail. Even with us, he may fail. If we fight for him, we will be
joining the losing side.�

�The duke said in his message that he will start the
rebellion at the start of summer. He is sure that he will have success.�

�Then why does he need us, my abbot? We are disciples of a religion
that is heresy in the Bright Kingdom.
He will lose support from women just by having us by his side. No, he is
desperate. That can be the only reason.�

�There is another reason Master Yu.� 

Yu Sheng looked at the abbot with a raise eyebrow. �And that
is?� 

�The 2 messengers the duke sent were cultist.�

�WHAT?�

�It seems that Duke Hatak also follow the Prophecy of
Bokkan.� The abbot said with a smile. �If he succeeds, he will name the
Prophecy of Bokkan as his country�s official religion. Do you think this is a
risk we should take, Master Yu?�

����������� 

Yu Sheng was in shock. The Bright
 Kingdom covers the whole of Warron.
The entire continent, and subsequently much of the world belong to the land of
light and their mistress. Women ruled the Bright
 Kingdom, and have been since Minka
Rose named herself Empress over 150 summers ago. Now only women can own
property and they are considered the head of the family. There is only one
religion in the empire and that is The Church of Light, all followers of other
religions and teachings were put to death. The highest ranked priestess of the
church is called the High Mother and is considered the second most powerful
human in the world. Just behind the Empress.�


&nbsp;

The Temple
of the Fire Sun however follows a different teaching. The monks of the temple
follow the Prophecy of Bokkan. In the prophecy, it is said that 8 powerful
women born in different times will create 8 disasters. The last of which will
destroy the world of Allfarr. To prevent the destruction of the world, women
must be kept from power. On Mount Shi,
only men matters. A woman�s place is on her knees at the feet of her master.
Needless to say, the temple and its teachings were unwelcome in the Kingdom
proper. However, some men in the kingdom do follow the temple�s teaching. Yu
Sheng has known for a long time that small cults do exist in the kingdom. That
they would count a duke among their members is something he had never imagined.


&nbsp;

�Duke Hatak is a cult member?�

�Yes. I�ve known about it for quite some time,� the abbot
replied. �But his ambition is something else. I�ve never thought he will rebel,
even after killing his sister. That is why I seek your advice Master Yu.�

�So the rumors were true. The duke did kill his sister to
inherit the dukeship.�

�Yes. That�s how I know about his loyalty. He sent another
messenger 6 summers ago. Another cultist who requested aid in the �accident� of
the sister.�

�Who did we sent?�

�Monk Tian Lung.�

Yu Sheng was shocked again. �He was the one who found the
messengers.�

�Yes, he was.� The abbot smiled again. �Fate? Anyway, that�s
a different matter. The question now is if we will accept the duke�s request.
What says you, Master Yu?�

Yu Sheng considered for a moment, and then said, �If Duke
Hatak will do as he says, and then the temple must help him Master Abbot.�

�Must?�

�Yes. This is a chance we may never get again. A real chance
to change the world and in the process, saved it.�

�Did you not just say that we will be on the losing side,
Master Yu?�

�No, Master Abbot. I said that the duke may lose even with
us, but this chance and its rewards may outweigh its risk.�

�Good, good. I will take your suggestion under advisement. I
will speak to the other masters, leave me.�

�Master Abbot.� Yu Sheng bowed his head and then left the room.
It will be an interesting year ahead. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Lu Seng

����������� Lu Seng sat
with his leg cross close to his body. Slowly, he cleared his mind and entered
his meditative state. The other masters all agreed that the temple must helped
Duke Hatak, but as High Abbot, the decision was his alone. That is why he is
here in the dungeon. To seek answers. 

&nbsp;

�Abbot, the prisoner is ready.�

The abbot stood up and turned around. A layman of the temple
stood in front of him with his had bowed and hands behind him. �Has she given up?�
The Abbot asked.

�No, my Abbot.� The layman continued. �She refused to say
who sent her.�

�Very well.�

&nbsp;

����������� �Lu Seng walked into the cell. The woman had
her arms chained overhead. The steel chains were connected to the ceiling of
the cell and the woman had to stand on her toes to keep balance. Lu Seng looked
at the woman impassively. A tall busty woman with the blond hair of the north,
she had the weathered look of a fighter. The woman looked at Lu Seng with hard
eyes, challenging the abbot to do his worst. She was the first fighter to go
down in the fight with Tian Lung but the only one to survive. Knowing Tian Lung
brutal style, that takes some doing. Even in his advanced age, the abbot loves
a challenge. 

&nbsp;

����������� Lu Seng
showed nothing to the woman. He walked around to her back, out of her view.
Quietly, he picked up a whip. With a word the abbot whipped the woman�s back.
The scream echoed around the cell.

&nbsp;

Swoosh! The
rebellion will be dangerous.

Swoosh! But it is
a great chance.

Swoosh! All the
masters agreed that we should help the duke.

Swoosh! But is
glory clouding their judgments?

Swoosh! Is glory
clouding mine?

Swoosh! But Yu
Sheng is right!

Swoosh! We may
never get this chance again.

Swoosh! But can
Hatak do it? 

Swoosh! Can he be
successful?

Swoosh! Probably.
With the Kingdom so weak right now.

Swoosh! But we
will need to send a sizable force.

Swoosh! What if we
fail?

Swoosh! The temple
will be destroyed!

Swoosh! What if we
succeed?

Swoosh! We will
save the world.

Swoosh! Yes,
saving the world of Warron.

Swoosh! What good
is the temple if the world is destroyed?

Swoosh! That is
correct. We will go!

Swoosh! We must
go!

&nbsp;

����������� The Abbot
stopped. Red stripes colored the woman�s back, the layman was checking the
woman�s back. Lu Seng released the whip and asked, �How many?�

�20 strikes Abbot. And her skin is still not broken.� 

&nbsp;

There was a touch of awe in the
layman�s voice. Lu Seng could understand why. To go on a meditative whipping
and not break the skin is the mark of a true master. The abbot always made
important decisions during a whipping. And those decisions are usually right.
He walked in front of the woman. The abbot lifted her head with his hand and
said, �Tell us who sent you or I will return tomorrow.� The woman�s eyes showed
only fear, but not enough. Lu Seng will have to return tomorrow. He smiled,
turned and left the cell.

Part 2- Journey��������� 

&nbsp;

Yu Sheng

����������� It took 10
days to prepare for the trip once the decision was made. The messenger died on
the third day so the temple sent their own runner to the duke. The Temple
of the Fire Sun would march to his aid.

&nbsp;

����������� No one was
surprised when Yu Sheng was named commander of the temple forces. Yu Sheng was
the third highest monk in the temple and with both the Abbot and First Monk in
advanced age; he was the most obvious choice to lead the campaign. 

&nbsp;

����������� Duke
Hatak�s province lies just west of Mount
 Shi. The journey to his province
would take about 8 days, the temple troops will arrive just before the
beginning of summer. Yu Sheng looked at Mount
 Shi as he started his journey. Mount
 Shi lies at the southeastern tip of
Warron. Green thick forest covered the mountain with only one path cutting
across it. The inaccessible location and terrain of Mount
 Shi was what kept the temple safe.
The temple lies near the top of the mountain just below the snowline. Yu Sheng
was born on the mountain 30 summers ago and had devoted his life to the
temple�s teachings. The temple had been his life and now he is leaving. 

&nbsp;

����������� Yu Sheng
thought of his troops as they march towards their fate. At the front of the
troops were the Slaves. Females who had been claim by the various monks of the
temple. In the Bright Kingdom,
they would be called wives but in the temple, things were very different.
Numbering about 300, the slaves were each equipped with a short sword and small
shield. They wore light leather armor with the symbol of bright red sun in the
middle of armor. The slaves also have a tattoo on their face. In the temple,
when a monk claimed a woman as his own, the monk will commission a symbol. The
symbol will then be tattooed on the woman�s right cheek. This symbol will
remain on her face for all to see, telling everyone that the woman is the
property of someone. 

&nbsp;

����������� Behind the
slaves, marched the monks. With their green robes and long staff, you couldn�t
tell that they were fighting men. But no one on Warron, male or female, wants
to face a monk of the Fire Sun. With their quickness and strange fighting
style, the monks were considered to be the best one-on-one fighters on the
continent. Numbering over a hundred, Yu Sheng knew that they were the backbone
of his forces. 

&nbsp;

����������� Behind the
monks came the laymen. 200 young men who were disciples of the Fire Sun but who
have yet to complete the test of monkhood, they were the eager apprentices. The
young energetic warriors all armies must have. Armed with a spear and armored
with a leather vest, Yu Sheng knew that their energy were the heart and soul of
his troops. 

&nbsp;

����������� Behind the
laymen, came perhaps the important part of his troops, the bitches. The bitches
were females who hadn�t been claimed by a monk. An army on the move still needs
to eat, that means wagons of food must follow the army. However wagons can�t
move by themselves. The bitches solved that problem. Eight bitches are assigned
to each wagon. The wagon is basically a rectangle box on four wheels. A long
pole jut out from the front and two shorter poles are placed across the long
pole. In teams of four, the bitches will pull the wagons behind the troops till
the time came to change teams. In theory, the bitches can switch around
whenever they are tired. However, a Pain-master sits on every wagon. The
Pain-master is a monk who for one reason or another cannot fight with the
troops. As such their talents are used to take charge of bitches. With a whip
in hand, they made sure that the wagons kept up with the troops and any bitch
that do not pull their weight is almost guaranteed a whipping at the end of the
day. An important and difficult post, a Pain-master can�t be too hard or too
soft on the bitches. It�s a hard balancing act but those who succeed at it were
greatly admired. The High Abbot himself was a former Pain-master. 

&nbsp;

����������� In the Bright
 Kingdom, men not women are used to
pull wagons. The people of the Bight Kingdom
believed that men with their greater strength are considered to be better
suited to be slaves. The fools never stopped to think that men with their
greater physical abilities were naturally leaders. Even without the prophecy
and its� danger, the stronger always control the weak. That is and always will
be the way of nature. With hope, the temple will spread its wisdom to the
world. Yu Sheng gave one last look at Mount
 Shi, then turned and marched to the
future. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Tian Lung

����������� Tian Lung
sat quietly by the fire. All around him, everyone was preparing to rest for the
night. For 3 days they had been marching, soon they will be at their
destination. His follow monks and their slaves were spending their last moments
of the day around a fire. Most likely it will be their last moments of peace
for a while. Even men without slaves are spending their nights with one of the bitches,
taking advantage of the night.

&nbsp;

�Sir, a message from Master Yu Sheng.�

&nbsp;

Tian Lung turned to see the bitch
who spoke. The naked bitch was squatting on the ground with her legs apart; she
put her hands on the ground and looked at the ground. Her long black hair
covered her face. The standard position when a bitch addresses a man in the
temple. �Look up bitch.� The bitch raised her head as Tian Lung commanded. The
bitch was plain. Black eyes on a face that�s neither beautiful nor ugly. Tian
Lung did not recognize her. 

&nbsp;

�Who are you?� 

�My name is Blue. Master Yu Sheng has a message for Monk
Tian Lung, Sir� 

�What is it?�

�Master Yu Sheng asked that Monk Tian Lung meet him at his
fire, Sir.�

�Now?�

�Yes, sir.�

&nbsp;

Tian Lung thought about this. This
meeting is probably about the duke. He was the only one here who had ever met
Duke Hatak. Tian Lung looked at Blue again. No tattoo on her face meant that
she was unclaimed, which was why she is naked. Slaves were
allowed clothes but not bitches. The only way for bitches to keep warm
at night was to spend a night with one of the monks or layman, or sleep and hug
each other for warmth. 

&nbsp;

�Have anyone claim you for the night?� 

�No sir.�

�Stay here and await my return.�

�Yes sir.�

&nbsp;

����������� The bitch
sounded a little too happy but Tian Lung let it go. He has more important thing
to do now. He stood up and walked to the centre of the army. He found Master Yu
Sheng�s fire easily. With his bald head and blue robes, Yu Sheng struck an odd
picture in the camp. He was easily the shortest monk in the temple and was not
known to be a good fighter. His sky blue eyes however had never showed anything
but intelligence and his grasped of tactics was second to none. His 4
slaves/wives were beside him, obeying his every word. The master saw Tian Lung
approaching.

&nbsp;

�Tian Lung�

�Master.� Tian Lung gave a small
bow as he addressed his superior.

�Please sit.� 

Tian Lung sat by the fire. �You wish to speak to me?�

�Yes. You can probably guess why?�

�Duke Hatak?�

The master nodded his head.

�What do you wish to know Master?�

�The Abbot told me he sent you to the duke 6 summers ago.
You met the duke?�

�Several times�

�What kind of man is the duke?�

�Smart, clever, ruthless and very
deceptive. That�s best way to describe him.�

�He is a capable man then?�

�Very. Didn�t think the kingdom create men like that anymore.�

�Do you think the duke will be successful in his rebellion?�

�If he failed, it will not be because of lack of effort or
intelligence.�

�Does the duke have any vices or weakness I should know
about then?�

Tian Lung thought for a moment, and then said, �The duke is
a zealot.�

�Please explain.�

�He firmly believes that men, not women should rule. He
believes in the Prophecy with all his heart and that women will destroy Warron.�

�Being strong in your convictions can be a great strength at
times.�

�At times,� Tian Lung agreed. �Other times, it can and will
lead to problems.�

�What do you mean?�

�The duke follows a teaching that is slightly different from
ours.�

�What do you mean?�

�You have to remember master that the duke grew up in the
Kingdom.�

�So?�

�At the temple, females are not allowed to study. They are
used for their bodies, not their minds. To us, females are nothing but animals.
Cults in the kingdom will not agree with that thinking.�

�I see. Why would they not?�

�Like I said, they grew up in the Kingdom. There, women are
head of the household. To the cults, pulling them down below men is good enough.
Considering them animals? That is something beyond the men of the cults I�m
afraid.�

The master nodded. �I see� is there anything else?�

�In the Prophecy of Bokkan, it is said that 8 women will
destroyed the world. The temple teaches that the first of the woman was the
Orcish seer Eyes-to-Heaven. The teaching the duke follows believed that the 2nd
Doom has already came.�

�WHAT? Who�why would they say that?�

�They believed that Minka Rose was the 2nd Doom.�

�The first Empress! Why?�

�To them, ever since she killed the last Emperor and claimed
herself Empress 150 summers ago, wars after wars had been fought in Warron.� 

�So? Wars have always been fought!�

�Not like this. In fact, they claimed that only in 2 of the
last 150 summers had there not been a war. When Minka Rose claimed the crown of
the kingdom, many factions were very unhappy with her. Too many wars have been
fought since Minka Rose, far more than is usual.� The master can only shake his
head at this. Tian Lung added, �I do not fully agree with them, but this is
their belief. And the duke views anyone who disagrees with this view with great
disdain, though he hid it very well. You will do well to heed to this Master.�

A look of surprise flashes across the master�s face. �And if
I don�t?�

�Then you will have a�harder time convincing him in other
matters.� Tian Lung said. �Like I said, the duke is a zealot and very strong in
his convictions.�

The master gave a small nod of understanding. He did not
look happy. �I understand. I thank you for your advice Tian Lung. You have
given me a lot to think about.�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Blue

����������� Blue was
nervous. Tian Lung told her to wait, but he didn�t tell her to get up. So when
he came back, Tian Lung saw that Blue was still squatting in her respectful
position. Blue was delighted to see the monk.

&nbsp;

�Sir, may I sit.�

�No, you mat not.�

�As you wish sir.� Blue fought to keep her voice neutral. 

�Lie down on my bedroll and open your legs bitch.�

�Yes Sir.� 

&nbsp;

Blue again fought to keep her voice
neutral. She quickly lay down and opened her legs. Blue was a bitch but she
wasn�t a fool. She knew what the monk want, but staying with Tian Lung will
keep her warm tonight, so she had no problem with giving him what he wanted.
She touched herself between her legs and looked suggestively at the monk. He
wasn�t impressed. Blue�s hands then went up her body to her tits. Rubbing them
slowly, she gave a small sound of pleasure. Tian Lung continued to look at her
impassively. Now, Blue was worried. Most men would jump her by now. If the monk
wasn�t going to use her, he would tell her to go. And Blue wants to stay by
that fire.

&nbsp;

Looking at Tian Lung, Blue tried to
remember everything she knew about him. A loner by nature, Tian Lung was one of
the best fighter in the temple, if not the very best. Not only that, with his
long, lean body and his pointed, hawk-like face he was also one of the scariest
looking man in the temple. But Blue cannot remember anything about his sexual
preferences, which is surprising as it was one of the things the bitches loved
to gossip about.

�

�Stand up bitch.� Blue stood up as the monk commanded. 

�Squat� Blue squatted down.

�Lie down� Blue lay down with her legs open.

�Too slow. Stand� Blue stood up in a flash.

�Lie down� Blue lay on the ground.

&nbsp;

����������� On and on
this went. The commands came faster and faster. Blue followed. She was a doll
in the monk�s hand, doing everything he commanded at the speed he wanted. It
was a nighttime workout and soon Blue was sweating. �Lie down.� Blue lay on the
ground�and stayed there. The next command did not come. Not only that, Tian
Lung opened his robe. Blue was relieved. Whatever test this was, she had� Then
she saw his cock. Blue was a bitch and had been used by monks before. She was
always naked and as a bitch could be used by any man that crossed her path. One
of the reasons all bitches wanted to be slaves was the clothes; the other was
that once claimed, only your monk can have intercourse with you. So Blue had
seen a cock before, many cocks before. But nothing liked this! No wonder none
of the bitches gossiped about Tian Lung, no one would believed the size of his
manhood. It was longer and thicker than anything she had ever seen. She was
scared. 

&nbsp;

����������� �Wet me.�
At the monk�s command, Blue went to her knees and sucked. She put her mouth
over the manhood and tried to put as much saliva on it as possible. She did not
want that thing entering her dry. 

&nbsp;

�Lie down.� That was too soon, but
Blue lay on the bedroll as commanded. She steeled herself as the monk entered
her. He thrust, and thrust, and thrust. Blue cried out in pain and pleasure.
�No sound bitch.� Blue ignored him, besides the pain was so great that she
couldn�t keep quiet even if she wanted to. Blue cries out again and�a fist
almost knocked her head off. 

&nbsp;

�I said no sound bitch!� Tian Lung
growled. Blue, her head still spinning from the punch, resolved to keep quiet.
An impossible exercise! He was just too wide! Every time she cried out, Tian
Lung would punch her face. Tian Lung was thrusting violently into her and every
time he heard a sound, Blue�s head should spin. Pain! Tian Lung thrust faster
and faster. The more punches he threw, the better he seem to like it.
Amazingly, Blue felt herself coming to an orgasm. Pain, she was getting off on
the pain. It is coming, coming, coming�AHHHH!

&nbsp;

Tian Lung climaxed into her, and
just at that moment, so did Blue. The biggest, best orgasm ever! She couldn�t
believe it. She could hardly breathe. The monk lay beside her. �Clean me,� he
commanded. Blue, her face back and blue, rise and put the monk�s manhood in her
mouth. Slowly, she licked it clean. But Blue knew she wasn�t cleaning the manhood,
she was worshipping it.��

Part 3- Surprises 

&nbsp;

Yu Sheng

����������� Yu Sheng is
not a happy man. The runner came on the 5th day of the march. Duke
Hatak has attack the province of Tai.
Tai was the province just north of the duke�s and Yu Sheng immediately ordered
a running march. What was to be an easy 8 days march turned into an 8 day dash
over a much longer distance. Now his forces are here in Tai and its� not even
summer yet. Yu Sheng wants answers.

&nbsp;

����������� He entered
the command tent of the tent and laid his eyes on the man for the first time.
Duke Hatak was looking at a map on the table with an aide. The duke heard the
sound of someone entering and looked up. There is a huge smile on his face.

�Master Yu Sheng is it?� he shouted. �Welcome to our
glorious adventure Sir Monk.� With that, the duke flew across the tent with his
giant arms wide opened. He hugs the master with force and picks him up in a
bear hug. Needless to say, it wasn�t what Yu Sheng was expecting.

&nbsp;

�Uh�Duke Hatak?� he asked. 

The duke immediately released his grip. �Of course! Sorry
about that Master. You�re right, introductions first.� The duke stood straight
and gave a formal bow. �Duke Hatak, ruler of the Ren and Tai
 Province.�

Yu Sheng looked at Duke Hatak with a keen eye. A giant of a
man, the duke was a full 2 heads taller than he was. However there wasn�t an
ounce of fat on him. One look at him and you can tell that he was a warrior.
The master gave a bow as well. �Master Yu Sheng, the Temple
of the Fire Sun.�

�I know. I am pleased that you have joined us Sir Monk. We
had just had a great victory.�

�I understand. I understand that you have destroyed the
forces in Tai.�

�Yes. A wondrous victory. The province is ours!�

�In one battle? Are there not other forces in the province?�

The duke looked surprise�then gave a huge belly laugh. �Oh,
I forgot. You have been on the march for the past 8 days. You haven�t heard the
wondrous news have you?�

Now it was Yu Sheng turn to be surprise. �No�what news is
it?�

The duke gave a wink and said, �The Crown Princess Mei Yun
has just rebelled.�

Yu Sheng�s jaws dropped. He must have looked like a landed
fish. �What? The Crown Princess? Where? Why?�

The duke couldn�t stop laughing and Yu Sheng couldn�t blame
him. The timing couldn�t be better. �As you know the Empress is dying. Word is
that she was going to named the Second Princess Mei Yan was her successor, not
the Crown Princess. Needless to say, the Crown Princess took offence. She went
west and called an army. The whole of the western kingdom has joined her in
rebellion.�

Yu Sheng couldn�t help but join in the laughter, �And the
Second Princess called her whole army to fight her sister?�

�Yes! Almost all the army units in the eastern province are
now in the capital of Rosewood.�

�And that�s why you launch your own rebellion early. To take
advantage of the confusion.� Yu Sheng couldn�t help but admire the duke on
this.

�Yes! That army we defeated 2 days ago was the only one here
in Tai. By the darkness, there is a clear path all the way to Rosewood if we
wanted to!�

�I thought you said the Second Princess is in Rosewood?�

�Yes, but she can�t stay there for long. She may be the
better politician but Mei Yun is by far the better general. She has to attack
Mei Yun before the Crown Princess organized her army and start marching.�

�So�a clear path to Rosewood?� An idea came to Yu Sheng.
�That�s what you were discussing isn�t it? Whether to march on Rosewood?�

�Yes.� The duke was solemn in this. �I think it�s a huge
risk but most of my command thinks it can be done.�

�How many can you put on the field?�

�3 fists. All men, no women.� 

Again Yu Sheng was surprise. �15,000 men! How did you can so
many?� 

��News of our victory
has traveled fast and far Sir Monk. Men are joining our forces from all over.
Almost all the fighting men in Ren and Tai are here and more are joining
everyday. Over 6000 men have joined us since I began marching; we had men from
as far as Zen.�

�But you only had your victory 3 days ago. How did they get
their news so fast?�

�Oh�,� the duke gave a small smile at that, �for that you
have to thank this man here.� The duke pointed at the aide behind him. �Monk Yu
Sheng, may I introduce Xiong Fei.� The short roundish man made, or to be more
accurate attempted, a bow. Yu Sheng never heard of him. The duke continued, �He
is my wizard.�

&nbsp;

Xiong Fei

����������� �He is my
wizard.� The duke�s words rang in Xiong Fei�s head. The pride he felt was
unreasonable, but Xiong Fei couldn�t help it. Since the time of Minka Rose,
wizardry was a forbidden art. After all, only men can be wizards and the
female-led Bright Empire did not want such power in the hands of men. For 150 years,
wizards were hunted and killed on sight. So much so, those men who practice
wizardry had to do so in secret. Dark wizards were the monsters in stories to
scare little children, little better than the demons of legend. So to be
called, openly, a wizard was something Xiong Fei was proud of. �We are going
change the world.� The duke said these words to him on their first meeting.
Already, his words are coming true.

&nbsp;

�The monk had taken the news very well all
things considered.� Xiong Fei did not
approve of the duke�s plan to enlist the help of Mount
 Shi. However, after meeting Yu
Sheng, he had quietly accepted that he was wrong. Already the monk had made
several suggestions that are doing wonders for the growing army. One the best
was what to do with female prisoners. Duke Hatak had wanted to kill them,
mainly because he felt he needed to. A mobile army can�t have a train of
prisoners trailing behind them. The monk solved the problems with a simple
solution. The prisoners will be given to the monks and put to work. Of course,
first they had to convince the prisoners of the wisdom of working for their
conquerors. The methods used were�unsettling, but very successful. So much so
that they gave an idea to Xiong Fei and his follow wizards.

&nbsp;

The line of naked prisoners kneeled
quieted before the monk Li Yang. Yu Sheng called Li Yang a �Pain-master�. A
post created in the temple for men who had the job of controlling the females. 

&nbsp;

Pain-master Li Yang began his speech. �You are all prisoners
of a new world. You are now no longer warriors. You are now no longer women.
You are now bitches. You are only fit to serve your men. Sit on your ass and
open your legs bitches.�

�The prisoners looked
at the monk in shock, not one of them moving.

Li Yang looked at one of the layman of the temple and said,
�Bring out that other bitch.�

&nbsp;

The layman hurried away. Soon he
returned with another layman. Between the 2 of them, they dragged a female to
the monk. With no regard for her well-being, the 2 laymen threw the female at
Li Yang�s feet. The female was also naked, only her body was crisscross with
red welts. The meaning was clear to all.��


&nbsp;

�Sit on your ass and open your legs now!� Li Yang shouted.

&nbsp;

This time the prisoners obeyed. Li Yang waited till all the
females got into position and then...he stood there. The females looked at each
other in surprise at first and then slowly, one by one, they looked down at the
ground in shame. Warriors of the Bright Empire now naked with their legs open
and exposed to their most hated enemies. Xiong Fei could just imagine their
shame.

&nbsp;

The pain-master then said, �The bitches will now move one of
their hands to the hole between their legs and rub themselves.�

Color drained from the faces of the prisoners. Almost
inevitably, one of them said, �No!�

Li Yang nodded to the 2 layman. They threw the disagreeing
female on the ground, forcing an arm outward. Li Yang took out a chopper from
somewhere and showed it to the offending female.

�Rub yourself with your hand or I will cut this one off.�

Xiong Fei admired the female�s courage. �No!� she screamed.

She screamed even louder when Li Yang took her hand off with
one swing. Blood gushed out of the wound. Xiong Fei stepped forward, the words
of a spell on his lips. Flames covered his hands. He pressed his hands on the
females� wound and the scream grew in intensity. Mercifully, the female then
pass out from the pain. 

&nbsp;

����������� Li Yang
looked at the other prisoners expectantly. Almost as one, hands went between
their legs but this wasn�t enough. 

&nbsp;

�Anyone who does not rub themselves forcefully will also
have their hands chopped off!� Li Yang growl has the desired effect. The
prisoners rubbing began in earnest. Li Yang continued, �You are now bitches.
Worthless creatures till the day a man claim you as his own. Till then, you
will be in a team. A team will have 4 bitches. You will work in your team but
you will own nothing, not even clothes. If you are caught wearing clothes, you
will die. If you disobey a man, you will die. If you try to kill yourself, you
will wish you were dead. If you are successful in killing yourself, the rest of
your team will wish they�ve joined you.� The threat was clear, look after each
other and make sure they do not do anything foolish or you will join in their
punishment.

&nbsp;

����������� Xiong Fei
ignored Li Yang and the prisoners. He concentrated on the wound. The flame has
cleaned it and the blood has stopped flowing. Yes, the �Fire Hands� spell can
be used as a healing spell for open wounds. Xiong Fei stood and walked back to
his follow wizards to report the good news.

&nbsp;

Blue

����������� The Bright
Empire makes a lot of stupid females. This is something Blue and her sister bitches
totally agreed on. Here was another stupid female who refuse to submit to the
monks. As Blue carefully covered both her hands with bandages, she can�t help
but wonder why they were so stupid. 

&nbsp;

A female don�t really need their
hands. A female greatest use is giving birth, and since when do they need their
hands for that? Even without hands, the monks will just hook the female to a
wagon. A rope will hook around the neck of the female, locking her to the
wagon. A �wagon-bitch�, with no other uses but the pulling of the wagon behind
the army as it marches along. �Hands�on a
female? Not really necessary.���

Part 4- Rout

&nbsp;

Xiong Fei

����������� The battle
came 6 days later. Duke Hatak had deployed scouts all along the route from
Rosewood to Tai. As expected, an army was sent to put down the rebellion. Much
smaller than Yu Sheng expected, the monk immediately proposed meeting them in
battle. The duke agreed. 

&nbsp;

Marching under the cover of
darkness, The Dark Army, as the men has started calling themselves, went out to
meet the Bright army. Xiong Fei could only imagine their surprise when they
woke up to see their enemy right at their doorsteps. Now for the hard part�the
battle.

&nbsp;

Xiong Fei looked across the field
at the Bright army. Both armies were about the same strength, about 10,000 on
each side. Duke Hatak has left the remaining fist to guard the supplies as the
wagons were left behind in the march. To Xiong Fei, it was a mistake to leave
behind so many men but then he heard the monk�s plan. Yu Sheng�s was bold,
daring and unheard of, if somewhat cruel. That�s why Xiong Fei was a wizard,
not a military strategist. He would much prefer to be researching his spells
than in a military campaign.

&nbsp;

�As the 2 army faced up to one another, Xiong
Fei heard the horn. The monk had ordered the release of the bitches. From the
lines of the Dark army, naked women ran across the field towards the lines of
the Bright army. Xiong Fei could see that some of the women were reluctant to
run, fearing that they would be shot down while crossing. If only that was the
case.

&nbsp;

�Xiong Fei knew that these women were the ones
who had given the pain-masters the most problems; all of them were missing both
hands. As the women ran, Xiong Fei could almost hear the gash of shock from the
Bright army. The mental image of their follow comrades running like sacred
rabbits across the field, handless and naked, is not one they will ever forget.
Xiong Fei soon heard shouts of encouragement from the Bright army. As the women
reach the lines, The Bright army gladly opened up. Soon almost all the women
were in the lines. Then as the army tried to close up after them, another horn
was heard. With bile in his mouth, Xiong Fei and his follow wizards raised
their hands to the sky. Explosions rocked the Bright army. Unknown to them,
Xiong Fei and his wizards had put a delay fireball spell on each of the
prisoners earlier in the day. The fireballs blew the prisoners� body
apart�along with anyone in the area. Huge inviting holes soon appeared in the
disciplined lines of the Bright army. The duke wasted no time. Another horn was
heard; the order for the charge. The men of the Dark army crashed into the
Bright army�s lines like a tidal wave. 

&nbsp;

The Bright army had no chance. Soon
the lines were broken. Even to Xiong Fei�s untrained eye, victory was a
certainty. Pockets of resistance were swept up in the wave that was the Dark
army. Xiong Fei smiled sadly, what was to be a battle had turned quickly into a
rout. Xiong Fei saw the standard of the Bright army commanding officer turning.
She was trying to make a run for it but Yu Sheng had already expected that. His
monks had being deployed behind the Bright army to cut off any escape routes.
Xiong Fei almost felt sorry for her.

&nbsp;

Tian Lung

����������� Waiting was
never a problem for Tian Lung. A patient man by nature, waiting was almost
second nature to him. Waiting for battle was also not a problem, waiting for
battle with other people unfortunately was.

&nbsp;

����������� �Tian Lung and his follow monks had sneaked
behind the Bright army in the night. They had already heard the explosions and
the sounds of battle. Now all they could do was wait. If the battle went well,
the Bright army would run and that�s where the monks will come in. They were to
cut off any escape routes the Bright army would used. In theory you would think
that monks would have no problems with waiting, however this was far from the
case. As Tian Lung looked around his section, he could almost feel the nervous
energy coming from the men. But then only Tian Lung, Lim Cheng and Fu Hong were
monks. The rest were laymen and slaves. 

&nbsp;

����������� Tian Lung
looked at the 4 slaves in the section. Both Lim Cheng and Fu Hong had bought
their slaves/wives along for the mission. He has never understood why his
follow monks want to fight with women at their backs but Tian Lung knew that
its� not his place to argue about such matters. However, it�s not the slaves
that gave Tian Lung cause for concern. 6 laymen were in their section as well.
It is them that Tian Lung was worried about. Like all laymen, in fact like all
young men, they were eager for battle. Eager for a chance to prove themselves
in battle and take that all important step towards their goal of monkhood.
Eager men in battle usually mean dead men in battle. 13 men in a section, a
holy number for the temple, Tian Lung hoped that it will be enough.

&nbsp;

����������� Soon
footsteps were heard. Tian Lung silently cursed as their quarry came into view.
A group of Bright soldiers were running for their lives, it seems that the
battle had gone well for the Dark army. However, the group running towards Tian
Lung�s section number around 20. They had the section outnumbered. Tian Lung�s section
will have no choice but to let them go. Then Tian Lung saw the standard. Tian
Lung immediately looked at his follow monks. Both Lim Cheng and Fu Hong saw the
same thing. The commander of the Bright army was in the group, the section
cannot allow such a prize to escape.

&nbsp;

����������� The section spread out and waited in
the bushes as their quarry approaches. Tian Lung took the centre while Lim
Cheng and Fu Hong had the flanks. His follow monks would hold the wings with
their slaves while the laymen would fight with Tian Lung as their centre. Soon
the quarry was upon them. Tian Lung was glad that only women were in the group;
outside the commander he can kill the rest without pity. A feral smile came on
his face.

&nbsp;

����������� The section
burst out of the bushes as one. Their quarries were expecting a chase from
behind, not a battle from the front. As such, they had their best fighters at
the rear and their wounded in front. The wounded tried their best to hold off
the section, hoping to buy time for the rear to move up. But it was a foolish
hope. With speed and surprise on their side, the laymen�s spears took out the
front line of the Bright group in seconds. The laymen went forward without
pause, engaging the defenders. Tian Lung ignored them all. He only had eyes for
one person. Tian Lung have to give the commander credit, she was shouting
orders even now, ordering her soldiers to swing to the left. Then Tian Lung was
upon her.

&nbsp;

����������� The
commander was armed like her soldiers, a small shield in one hand with a short
sword in the other. Tian Lung swung his staff in a high arc. The commander
lifted her shield and took a giant step back as his staff crashed against it.
Like most people, the commander has underestimated Tian Lung�s strength. Tian
Lung didn�t give her time to dwell on that as he pressed the attack. He swung
the staff across and attacked. The commander caught the attack with her shield
and counterattacked. Tian Lung ducked as the sword went across his head. Tian
Lung then dropped his staff and went for a take-down. The commander cried in
shock as Tian Lung wrapped his arms around her legs. Off-balance as she was,
Tian Lung easily dropped her on her face. Trusting that his laymen would
protect his back, Tian Lung mounted her back and delivered an elbow to the
commander�s head. It wasn�t clean, but the next one was. The second elbow
caught the commander as she tried to lift her head. Just like that, it was
over.

&nbsp;

����������� Tian Lung
looked around and saw that the fight was already over. The soldiers has obeyed
their commander and swung to the left. With numbers, they had overwhelmed Fu
Hong and his two slaves. All three of them lay dead on the ground. However,
instead of fighting, the soldiers had run the moment the opening had appeared.
Cowards!

&nbsp;

�Good work� 

�Tian Lung turned and
saw Lim Cheng. �How many are hurt?� he asked.

�None hurt but five of ours are dead including Fu Hong.� 

�Let�s go then. We have our prize.�

�Yu Sheng will glad to have her.� Lim Cheng smiled as he
said.

�I lay claim�

�What?� Lim Cheng smile disappeared as he looked at Tian
Lung in shock.

Tian Lung looked in his follow monk�s eye and repeated
slowly, �I lay claim.� 

&nbsp;

Yu Sheng

The general�s work is never done. Whereas other men who had fought today
were now resting for the night, Duke Hatak has work to do. That meant that his
advisors has work to do as well, like finding out how many soldiers the Second
Princess Mei Yan has left in Rosewood.

&nbsp;

The commanding officer of the Bright officer is called Bei Hui.
Unfortunately, that was all they had been able to get out of her so far. Yu
Sheng know that this will change in time. Already a pain-master was at work
with the female. Most of the time, the pain-master would just cut off a hand or
two, and the female would soon be begging to talk. However Tian Lung had
lay claim on the female, so cutting off limbs was out of the question. But
there are other ways.

&nbsp;

The pain-master has tied the commander firmly to a chair. For interrogation
of female suspects without threatening life or limb, the pain-master has
several techniques that could generally be applied. In this case, the
pain-master has decided on the fingers rack. Six short wooden sticks were
positioned around and between the commanders� fingers and strings connect the
wooden sticks together. Each time the commander refused to testify or confess,
the pain-master woud pull the string, slowly, agonisingly squeezing the fingers
between the sticks. The pain was increbile. Yu Sheng has heard of bones being
crushed by this technique. Monks in the temple weren�t allowed cut off limbs of
a claimed woman even their own, but the breaking of bones was generally
allowed. The female screamed again.

&nbsp;

The pain-master
relaxed the strings and asked in a kind voice, �Dear commander, we know that Mei
Yan has left the capital to the west, she cannot save you now. Please, just
tell us how many soldiers she left
in Rosewood?�

&nbsp;

����������� Yu Sheng could almost smell the fear
from the commander but she stayed silent. The strings tightened. Yu Sheng saw
her face reddened as the scream tore through the tent. Still she stayed silent.
The pain-master bought forward a wooden pail. 

&nbsp;

�Do you know what
this is?� The pain-master asked in that flat kind voice of his. �This is hot
oil. The temple of the Fire Sun believed that females are not equal to males.
Men are bigger, stronger, smarter; men should rule. Females are labour. They
are needed for their bodies, not their looks. If you refused to talk, I will be
forced to put this oil over you. Do not worry, it will not kill you but your
looks, hair, body will be scarred beyond repair. Please, for all our good, call
us what you know. How many soldiers are left in Rosewood?�

&nbsp;

����������� Yu Sheng saw the war on the
commander�s face but it was a useless struggle. She will talk, if not now then
later. No matter what, the answers will come. With that thought, Yu Sheng left
the tent and walked into the night.

Part 5- Summer

&nbsp;

Xiong Fei

The captured commander had given up after just one night with the monks of
the Fire Sun. Very understandable considering the screams coming from the tent.
The information she gave was however better than anyone expected. The Second
Princess, Mei Yan, had marched west with everything she had. The forces
she left behind were only meant to delay Duke Hatak�s rebellion, not stop him.
They weren�t to engage in battle, only delay the men till Mei Yan finish off
her older sister. Too bad the choice was taken away from them.

&nbsp;

So here they are. The procession travelled slowly though the streets of
Rosewood. Taking the capital without a fight was quite anti-climatic for the
men but no one was complaining out loud. Or at least none of the men were
complaining, women were no doubt complaining. If they could!

&nbsp;

Xiong Fei can�t help but laugh at his own little joke as he stood on his
chariot. A four-wheeled human-drawn vehicle used for travel, it was drawn by
men who would pull the vehicle as their mistress whip them to greater effort
from behind. That however was in the past! Xiong Fei crack his whip again at
the two women pulling his chariot. Defeated soldiers from the Bright Army, they
were now used as the ones who would pull their conquerers into the city.� It was a brilliant idea. It was a sign to all
that times have indeed changed. Xiong Fei did not know who gave the duke the
idea, but whoever it was, he should be promoted. A procession of chariots
through the streets of Rosewood, men pulled by the female soldiers they had
just defeated.

&nbsp;

A show for the city and it was a good one! Lining the streets of the road
were the smiling and cheering men of the city. Once word came to the city that
the duke had defeated the army outside Rosewood, the men of the city rose in
rebellion. Without any trained soldiers to quell the disorder, men use their
superior size and strenght to overthrow the women. It was embrassingly easy and
soon it spread like wild fire. Within one day, men were in control of the capital
and the city opened it�s arms for the duke. Laughing out loud, the wizard crack
his whip as he drown in the cheers of the city. 

&nbsp;

Tian Lung

����������� The bamboo cane swish across the
air. The sound it made as it hit the tits of the female was pure music to Tian Lung�s
ears. He had decided to rename the female commander Red after the colour of her
tits. Tian Lung had tied her in place across two length of timber, crossed in
the center. Marks of countless strikes were on the female�s tits. Swoosh! 

&nbsp;

The bamboo cane swish across the air again. Red had long given up
screaming, numb to the pain. Tian Lung knew that he had broken the female days
ago, but it was just too fun to give up these sessions. Swoosh! When he first claimed the female, he did these sessions in the open. After
the third day, the others monks told him to move it indoors. Swoosh! He was too hard and it was
affecting the others females. Swoosh!
Thus, that is why he is in the dungeon right now. Swoosh! What nonsense! They are females! Why should anyone care
what they think? Swoosh! Still, Tian
Lung knew that he has to be careful. Swoosh!
He did not want t kill the female, or at least not yet. Swoosh! And it was very troublesome to clean up the dungeon after
each session. Swoosh! Like most men,
cleaning is not something Tian Lung enjoys. What he need is another slave. Swoosh! 

&nbsp;

Suddenly, Tian Lung remembers the
other slave. What�s her name? Blue! That�s right! Swoosh! If he claims her, she can do the cleaning up. Swoosh! Be the light, the 2 slaves can
even take turns in the dungeon. Giving the other slave at least one day of
rest. Swoosh! Or he could even have
both of them at the same time! The thought of it gave Tian Lung goose bumps. Swoosh! Tian Lung smiled to himself.

&nbsp;

Lu Seng

����������� Yu Sheng showed nothing on his face
but still Lu Seng wasn�t the abbot of the temple for nothing. The
rebellion was successful and Duke Hatak had spread his rule from Rosewood to
the countryside. None of which meant anything to Yu Sheng who is now known
throughout the land as �The Tactician�. The young monk had come back to the
temple angry and Lu Seng knew why.
Better to clear the air now.

&nbsp;

�You disagree
with the duke�s decision to stop at Rosewood, Master Yu?�

�Yes, Abbot� Yu
Sheng hotly agreed. �We had 2 female armies out west who were at each other�s
throats! If we left Rosewood and head west immediately after conquering it, we
could have destroyed whoever is left. Now the duke is safe in Rosewood but Mei
Yan has defeated her sister. Now she is out there licking her wounds but the
duke is struck in Rosewood. Too far away to do anyhing till next spring at the
earliest!� Yu Sheng wasn�t finished. �If the duke had listened to me and went
west immediately, our army would have clear the land of female warriors before
the winter snows set in! Now, we have an enemy who would no doubt rearm and
come back againest us next summer. It is��

�What would
happen if you had won?� The abbot cut the young monk off.

�Success! The
duke would have rule, the land of Warron would be saved, peace would reign as
no��

�You are wrong,
Master Yu.� 

Yu Sheng�s angry
face immediately changed at the abbot�s words. The look of anger transform to
one of puzzlement. To his credit, Yu Sheng recovered well. �I bow to your
superior wisdom, Abbot.�� 

�The problem was
that the Duke�s forces grew too quickly.� Yu Sheng�s look of puzzlement
remained. Lu Seng ccontinued.
�The duke started with 15,000 men. At Rosewood, he had over 25,000. Men flocked
to his banner as they wanted to defeat the Bright Empire. But�if there wasn�t
an empire to fight with�� Lu Seng stopped as understanding dawn on the young
monk.

�Duke Hatak
needed an enemy.� Yu Sheng said. �Without one, he would soon have to fight the
leaders of the men who joined his banner.�

�Yes. With the
princess out west, all the duke will have to do is too remind the other men
that war will begin again in the spring. An enemy who would like nothing less
than to kill all of them. With autumn almost over and winter beginning��

�The others will quietly stay under his banner. Giving the
duke time to built up his powerbase with the other groups� 

�That is correct. The duke has the wizards and us backing
him, so the other leaders know that even if they managed to defeat him, they
will be so weak that the princess will soon come to destroy whoever is left.�
Lu Seng stood up. �Go and prepare Master Yu. Come spring, the temple will march
again for the safety of Warron. This time we will crush the Bright.�

�

����������� The Tactician, Yu Sheng,
smiled and bowed toward the abbot. �As you command, my abbot.�
