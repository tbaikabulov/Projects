 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Part One
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By Razor7826 (Copyright 2008)

  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Why do you hate animals?"

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I love animals, Bill, which is why I've slaved away tirelessly for their freedom," responded Eliza Dogood.&nbsp; She stared directly into the camera with the same manufactured smile that she used in every public appearance.&nbsp; It had worked wonders in her campaign, and she had little doubt it would continue to service her in the future.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I hope you realize that you're the most hated woman in America right now."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Someday people will realize that letting our pets go free is the only ethical choice."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well, thank you for being on our show today.&nbsp; Next up..." The red light on the camera dimmed, signaling the end of the tele-interview.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eliza stood from her stool and stretched.&nbsp; She reached down, picked up the thin gold-rimmed glasses that hung from the collar of white blouse and put them on.&nbsp; The studio around her came back into focus.&nbsp; The cameraman and producer that had managed the national interview had wandered out of sight.

She sighed and smiled in satisfaction, the rush of accomplishing her life goal still fresh in her mind. Through tireless legislation across many states, she achieved the impossible, a federal ban on pets; now, hundreds of millions of enslaved animals across the United States would be set free, and Eliza Dogood proudly took responsibility for her actions.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It had been a busy week.&nbsp; Since the Monday deadline for compliance with the Federal Animal Freedom Act, Eliza had given sixteen interviews: eight with TV shows, five with major magazines, and the rest with newspapers.&nbsp; One more interview and her week of fame would fade into the sunset like that of women&#8217;s suffragists and civil rights activists.&nbsp; Or, so she thought.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After a few moments of looking around the studio, she found the producer.&nbsp; He thanked her for coming in and sent her on the way, with a goodie bag filled with studio propaganda and a check for her appearance.&nbsp; She took the elevator down to the parking garage, got in her car, and left the station.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her final interview was scheduled with a small animal-rights newsletter that Eliza had never heard of, "The Los Evas Animal Salvation House".&nbsp; She followed the directions downloaded online and headed for the coffee shop at which the interview was to take place.&nbsp; However, the destination was not what she had imagined it to be.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The pristine little coffee shop that existed only in photographs took a distinctly different facade first-hand.&nbsp; The vibrant colors that Eliza had imagined from the black and white photograph were replaced with peeling paint and boarded windows.&nbsp; Either the photo was of a long-past era, or an outright fabrication.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She looked back down at her directions and the email that had invited her to the interview.&nbsp; As far as she could tell, the addresses were the same.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Damnit, what a stupid prank," she muttered in frustration.&nbsp; However, she was getting used to it.&nbsp; The months since the act was passed into law were filled with hate mail, crank calls, and, on more than one occasion, death threats.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She turned around to get back in her car, but a woman slightly older than herself stood in the way.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Miss Dogood?" the woman asked.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eliza twitched in shock and nodded in confirmation.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I'm Gwyn, the local reporter that asked you for the interview.&nbsp; Sorry this place was closed.&nbsp; It has been a long time since the last time I visited this place.&nbsp; Kind of sucks that it&#8217;s gone, but anyway, thank you for coming. Do you mind if we go somewhere else for the interview?"&nbsp; The woman had short golden curls of hair and light skin.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eliza had learned to be suspicious during her months in the limelight.&nbsp; This woman's story was not making any sense.&nbsp; "I'm sorry, we really should reschedule for another time."&nbsp; She moved to circumvent the blond, but the woman countered her move and readjusted herself to once again block Eliza&#8217;s path.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Excuse me, miss, but I have other appointments that require my attention."&nbsp; 

Eliza ducked to the side, but Gwyn stuck out her arm to block the activist&#8217;s path.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No, we are going to have a little talk, whether you want to or not," threatened Gwyn.&nbsp; She pushed back against Eliza and pulled a gun from her coat.&nbsp; "Come with silently if you want to live."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eliza glanced down at the gun.&nbsp; She began to sweat.&nbsp; Nothing had prepared for this.&nbsp; "Fine. We can talk."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Good.&nbsp; Turn around and walk.&nbsp; Take a left into the alley."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eliza complied, walking slowly with her arms at her sides.&nbsp; She turned into the alley.&nbsp; There was a parked white van.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gwyn continued, "Good.&nbsp; Now, open the back door."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eliza followed the orders. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Thank you, Miss Dogood.� 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eliza felt a pinch on her neck, and the world around her faded to black.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
----

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eliza Dogood awoke on her back, her muscles aching from whatever the crazed woman had done to her.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good morning, Eliza.&nbsp; It&#8217;s been a long night, hasn&#8217;t it?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eliza looked around the room, still dazed.&nbsp; The d�cor was a sterile white with the only exceptions the cold grey of metallic structures littered about.&nbsp; There were shelves, machines, and a locked medicine cabinet against the wall.&nbsp; She tried to speak, but no voice came out.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You have a lot relearn, Elly.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve taken your ability to speak.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eliza tried to scream, but only a hollow gasp escaped her throat.&nbsp; A wave of panic overtook her, and she struggled to escape.&nbsp; However, her attempts to push herself up off of the padded bench were in vain as she realized her elbows and knees were hinged such that her legs and arms flexed in on themselves.&nbsp; They were bound into the small and painful position by what seemed to be layers upon layers of medical tape.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gwyn laughed at her specimen and reach out, placing her hand across Eliza&#8217;s bare chest.&nbsp; �You&#8217;re probably wondering what I plan on doing to you, don&#8217;t you Elly?�&nbsp; She rubbed her open palm against Eliza&#8217;s chest vigorously.&nbsp; Eliza felt the warmth generated by the friction.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That isn&#8217;t my name, you crazy bitch, she thought to herself.&nbsp; She flexed and strained her muscles, but the bindings stretched only a little&#8212;not nearly enough to come loose or afford her basic freedom.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Before you and your cult got that stupid law passed, I was a veterinarian,� Gwyn said as she motioned with her right arm to the piles of medical equipment.&nbsp; �Not only did they raid my house and take my sweet Nana and Popo,� she paused, �but they took away my license.&nbsp; My love.&nbsp; My livelihood.�&nbsp; She sighed and brought her hands to her face, muffling her speech.&nbsp; �Not like it would do much good, anyways.&nbsp; Not with what you did to the world.�&nbsp; She began to cry long painful sobs into her hands.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re hurt.&nbsp; You dominated animals for a living and deserve to suffer.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gwyn took a moment&#8217;s rest than looked back at Eliza.&nbsp; She raised her voice, now nearly at the point of yelling.&nbsp; �If you think that it&#8217;s cruel to keep animals as pets, would you be willing to do the job for them?&nbsp; I&#8217;ve read your books, and you keep on saying, over and over, how pure and innocent animals are and that they deserve better than the blight of mankind.&nbsp; Well, I guess they will get better.�&nbsp; A boisterous laugh erupted from her belly.&nbsp; You&#8217;re my pet now, me sweet little Elly.�&nbsp; She bent over Eliza and scratched behind her pet&#8217;s ear.&nbsp; �You&#8217;re my pet, forever and ever until the day you die.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eliza flinched away from the scratch violently, swinging her body to the side, tumbling onto the floor.&nbsp; Unable to brace for the fall, she slammed into the floor with her shoulder.&nbsp; She toppled onto her back and winced in pain before returning to her escape attempt.&nbsp; However, o matter how hard she tried to flip over to all fours, nothing worked.&nbsp; 

Gwyn watched with a smile.&nbsp; �Not as agile as a real doggy, are you?�&nbsp; She let loose an uproarious laughter and continued to watch Eliza struggle.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No, no, damnit! I have to get the hell out of here!

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She flopped around for several minutes before resting on her back, exhausted, each of her limbs thrust painfully upwards.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gwyn bent down and rubbed Eliza's belly, still laughing at the futility of Gywn's actions.&nbsp; "Oh, no need to get worked up, little doggy.&nbsp; I'm going to take real good care of you, just you see."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eliza could do nothing but cede to the whims of her captor, but still she looked up with pure contempt.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gwyn taped Eliza on the nose.&nbsp; "Let's go.&nbsp; We have to go get you house broken."&nbsp; She stood and headed for the cabinets.&nbsp; She reached in and removed a leash and collar, then returned to Eliza.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I always told my clients to make sure they obeyed local leash laws."&nbsp; Gwyn encircled the red leather collar around Eliza's Dogood neck and slipped the tail end through the faux-gold buckle, then latched it into place.&nbsp; "There, that&#8217;s a nice fit."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No it isn't.&nbsp; Eliza breathed heavily, panicking from the too-close fit of the collar.&nbsp; She had little tolerance for jewelry around her neck, and a tight leather choker was far worse.&nbsp; However, if that was what Gwyn wanted, Eliza would have to comply; there were no other options.&nbsp; Gwyn reached around Eliza and grasped her with surprising strength for a woman her size and proceeded to flip Eliza over, resting her on her knees and elbows.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eliza would have to play the part of Gwyn's pet if she wanted to survive.&nbsp; She accepted the help of her new owner and took her first feeble step on all fours.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Part Two
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By Razor7826 (Copyright 2008)

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Crawling on her knees and elbows hurt Eliza Dogood more than she could ever imagine.&nbsp; The white medical bandages barely cushioned her joints, producing near unbearable pain with each short step.&nbsp; She attempted to groan in pain, but her vocal chords still failed to produce in sound.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Come on, doggy.&nbsp; You can do it!" encouraged Gwyn, watching over her new companion.&nbsp; She tugged on the leash, forcing Eliza to take a short stumble forward.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eliza let loose a pained gasp and tumbled to the floor, her bandaged limbs scattered to her sides.&nbsp; She tried to stand back up, but collapsed once again.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How the hell does she expect me to live like this?&nbsp; I'm a person, not an animal, for Christ's sake!

Twice more she tried and failed, smashing her bare tits onto the floor painfully.&nbsp; Tears streamed down her face and gasping sobs wisped through her throat.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eliza glared up at her captor with her clouded eyes, hoping for sympathy, but Gwyn just stood there, staring back.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After a minute of silence between the two, Gwyn spoke, an air of command in her voice.&nbsp; "Don't think that I'll go easy on you if you don't try.&nbsp; I know how to get what I want out of women, and I have all the tools I need upstairs."&nbsp; She bent down and stroked Eliza's cheek.&nbsp; "Trust me.&nbsp; As much as I'd love to see you hurt for what you did, you'll be a lot happier if you just do what I ask of you.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Seeing the opportunity, Eliza snapped her head to the side and bit into Gwyn's exposed fingers, drawing blood.&nbsp; Gwyn screamed in pain and quickly kicked Eliza&#8217;s shoulder, forcing the woman&#8217;s mouth open and freeing the hostage digits.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gwyn gasped.&nbsp; She stared at her bloody hands in wide-eyed shock.&nbsp; "You fucking bitch!" she screamed.&nbsp; "I was trying to be nice to you, and this is how you repay me?&nbsp; You dumb cunt.�&nbsp; She pulled on the leash with all her strength, unbalancing Gwyn and forcing her to the floor.&nbsp; �The fiercer the dog, the harsher the training.&nbsp; I warned you, Elly.�&nbsp; She dragged her pet forward with the leash.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eliza struggled to get back onto her feet to escape the strangling pull of the leash.&nbsp; It took her numerous tries, but she regained her balance and crawled as quickly as she could behind the crazed Gwyn.&nbsp; The door from the clinic opened into a hallway, two doors on each side and one near the end.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gwyn fiddled with the knob to unlock the door and entered.&nbsp; Eliza followed, knowing that it was not the time for escape.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was a barren room, with concrete floors and walls.&nbsp; Dog toys, leashes, and harnesses were strewn about the floor, and at first glance, that is all she thought there was.&nbsp; But, as Eliza closed the door behind her, Eliza realized that the floor, while covered with toys, was not only of the type used for pets.&nbsp; The items included sex toys, though many of the items would be far from enjoyable: dildos, clamps, and milking machines.&nbsp; Eliza attempted to cry in protest, but still, no sound came out except the panting rush of air.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Now, Elly, do you understand why you should have obeyed me?&nbsp; I&#8217;ve always liked animals, and I&#8217;ve only ever been harsh when necessary.�&nbsp; She let out a slight a laugh.&nbsp; �You, though� I hate you.&nbsp; I hate you more than I&#8217;ve ever hated another human being, but I guess I shouldn&#8217;t even call you that anymore.�&nbsp; She kneeled in front Eliza Dogood and stroked her cheek.&nbsp; �You aren&#8217;t a human anymore.&nbsp; You wanted animals to be free, but people like me� we want� no, we need the kind of unquestioning companionship that can only come from a loving pet.&nbsp; And if you don&#8217;t want dogs or cats to fill that role, then you will fill it.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eliza cried, wanting to apologize, wanting to beg for freedom, but she had lost the first of many traits that had made her human&#8212;the capability for human speech.&nbsp; She hoped that whatever procedure Gwyn had performed was only temporary, or at least reversible, but she knew that to not be the case; her voice was gone forever.&nbsp; Tears rolled down her cheeks as she forced air out of her lungs, making quiet woofing sounds.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You&#8217;re so adorable, Elly, but it&#8217;s too late for that.&nbsp; Now, roll over.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eliza shook her head.&nbsp; No, no!&nbsp; I&#8217;m not an animal.&nbsp; I won&#8217;t do as you want.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Roll over, Elly!�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No!

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gwyn pushed Eliza&#8217;s side, flopping her onto her back. �When you master gives a command, you must follow orders obediently.&nbsp; Now, stay.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eliza flailed her arms into the air and wriggled her back, trying to distance herself from Gwyn.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Without speaking, Gwyn grabbed one of the dildos and shoved it into Eliza&#8217;s cunt.&nbsp; �Now, stay.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eliza winced in pain but quickly stilled herself.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good girl.�&nbsp; She pulled the plastic penis from Eliza&#8217;s pussy and placed it on the floor.&nbsp; Fluids puddled on the floor near the tip.&nbsp; �Now, are you going to do what I ask?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eliza nodded.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Wise choice, Elly.&nbsp; Now, get up.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eliza rocked too and fro on her back, trying to right herself, but each time landing with a thud on her back.&nbsp; Exhausted, she looked to Gwyn and silently pled for help.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Doggies can&#8217;t speak, Elly, and if you need to learn to do this sort of thing for yourself.&nbsp; Got it?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But, no matter how hard she tried, her heavily bound limbs gave her insufficient leverage to topple herself over.&nbsp; She turned back towards Gwyn and motioned her limbs into the air.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No, I&#8217;m not going to help you.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Damnit, that&#8217;s not what I&#8217;m trying to say.&nbsp; I just want you to redo the bindings.&nbsp; However, no matter how hard she tried to portray that thought without words or writing, she was left clueless.&nbsp; This is hopeless, she thought, as she stopped struggling, hoping that a moment&#8217;s rest would be enough for her to roll upright.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Damnit, Elly!� yelled Gwyn.&nbsp; She fumbled around the floor and picked up a handful of small clamps, which she hastily fastened to Eliza&#8217;s nipples.&nbsp; �Is that better motivation?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fuck, I was just resting, crazy bitch.&nbsp; However, misunderstanding or not, the motivation worked and Eliza Dogood flipped onto her knees and shoulders.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good girl!&nbsp; Now, let&#8217;s go for a little walk.�&nbsp; Gwyn turned and tugged on the leash, and Eliza followed.&nbsp; They exited the torture chamber and entered the hallway, which quickly spilled into the living room. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The d�cor revealed to Eliza the obsessions with dogs that plagued her captor.&nbsp; Paintings of dogs, dog shaped phones, old chew toys strewn all over the floor, all signs of a woman whose life revolved around canines.&nbsp; Seeing the woman&#8217;s obsession and the importance she placed in her pets revealed a simple reality of pet ownership, but it was too late.&nbsp; No matter how much Eliza would grow to understand the life of a pet and owner, she would be stuck in her role.&nbsp; It saddened her, but she did not stop.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The carpeting was a gentle reprieve for Eliza&#8217;s battered knees and elbows.&nbsp; The few minutes in the concrete training room or the tile of the office had caused unbearable pain, and any slight comfort was welcome.&nbsp; Eliza&#8217;s crawled forward, always a few steps behind her new mistress as they crossed the house.&nbsp; Though she knew that the house was not much larger than her own, she couldn&#8217;t help but marvel at how big it all seemed from the floor, a harsh reminder of what it felt to be little again.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That&#8217;s a good girl, Elly.&nbsp; You&#8217;re learning fast, but you&#8217;re still a lot slower than my other trainees.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That&#8217;s because I&#8217;m not a dog, Eliza thought to herself, no moans of protest escaping her lips.&nbsp; She knew little could be gained from fighting, and resigned herself to following her new master.&nbsp; Together, the duo made their way out of the living room, through the dining room, and to the base of a flight of stairs.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Now, up we go.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eliza gasped as she craned her head up the stairs.&nbsp; The flight looked gargantuan from twenty inches above the floor.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You need to learn eventually.&nbsp; Come,� commanded Gwyn as she ascended the flight of stairs.&nbsp; �Keep pace unless you want to get hurt.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Instinctively, Eliza crawled forward, placing her right elbow on the first step, followed by her second as she scuttled her rears closer.&nbsp; Then, her elbows onto the second step, followed by her knees onto the first.&nbsp; Lifting her body weight strained her muscles, but she knew it was necessary. She made progress step by step pushing her body to its limit to keep pace with the sadistic Gwyn.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By the tenth step, however, her muscles were starting to tire.&nbsp; On the twelfth, she collapsed onto the length of her arms.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No! Elly, bad girl.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She tried to straighten herself, to regain her balance, but failed, sliding first down one step, then two, until the only thing preventing her from crashing to the bottom was the leash.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Elly?&nbsp; Elly!&nbsp; No, don&#8217;t go down!� yelled Gwyn, now struggling to simultaneously maintain her balance and Eliza&#8217;s weight.&nbsp; She loomed over the top of the stairs with an expression of panic, as if afraid she too would fall down the stairs.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The leash pulled harshly against Eliza&#8217;s neck, strangling her.&nbsp; She flailed her bound limbs, but they merely slid off of the shallow carpet.&nbsp; As she gasped for air, her vision began to blur.&nbsp; Franticly she struggled, truly believing that Gwyn would rather strangle her then let her fall down to the bottom.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finally, she regained her grip and collapsed onto the stairs, the leash now slack.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Elly, damnit, you have to be more careful.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eliza wanted to yell back at her, but didn&#8217;t, still too exhausted from the struggle.&nbsp; She wanted to rest, but the gentle tugging on her leash signaled the wishes of her master.&nbsp; Rest was not an option.&nbsp; She straightened her stubbed limbs and carried herself up the stairs, step by step, until finally she was on the landing.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good girl.&nbsp; Come on, just a little bit further.�&nbsp; Gwyn continued the unrelenting pace, forcing her new pet to hurry along without a moments rest.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Though completely exhausted and in want of nothing more than collapse and sleep, Eliza Dogood pushed on.&nbsp; Her master&#8217;s wishes had to be followed, no matter how strenuous.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That&#8217;s it, keep going,� eased Gwyn.&nbsp; �In here.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The spacious room contained a huge bed and three dressers.&nbsp; It was the master bedroom.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Now, Elly, up on the bed.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eliza turned her head up and looked into Gwyn&#8217;s eyes, her eyes muscles portraying the impossibility of the demand.&nbsp; That&#8217;s way too high, and you know it.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Up, Elly.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t make me ask again.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But Eliza Dogood did not budge.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The veterinarian looked at her pet and frowned, her face a deep scowl for the first time since they met.&nbsp; �Fine,� she said before turning to the bed and climbing on.&nbsp; She pulled the leash in slowly but firmly.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eliza tried to hold out, but she stumbled forward inch by inch as the collar pulled painfully on her neck until she was at the foot of the bed.&nbsp; Realized she had no choice, she leaped upwards and landed her arms onto the edge of the bed, and, with the extra boost of the leash, pulled herself up.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You&#8217;re learning well, Elly.&nbsp; Now, the best way to train a dog is to reward good behavior, so��&nbsp; She let go of the leash, unbuttoned her pants, and slid them off her legs, revealing her pink silk panties.&nbsp; �� here&#8217;s your treat.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Eliza Dogood knew immediately what would be asked of her.&nbsp; She hesitated for a moment then crawled in.&nbsp; There was no point in resisting anymore.&nbsp; Gwyn would have her way, over and over, until one of them died or she was given an opportunity to escape.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And, until that day, she would be Gwyn&#8217;s pet.&nbsp; She closed her eyes, inched her head forward, and began to lap at the opening with her tongue.&nbsp; It was new and disgusting, but she pressed on.

Gwyn let loose a maniacal laugh as she pulled on the leash, forcing Eliza&#8217;s face deeper into her snatch.&nbsp; �What a wonderful day!&nbsp; You never thought you&#8217;d end up doing this, did you?&nbsp; None of this wouldn&#8217;t have happened if you didn&#8217;t wage a misguided war for animal rights.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t you see, Gwyn?&nbsp; Pets do what they do because they love their owners.�&nbsp; She slackened the leash before continuing, "Someday, you&#8217;ll grow to love me, and I&#8217;ll grow to love you.&nbsp; That's what I always love about pets.&nbsp; They may struggle, they may resist, but in the end, they&#8217;ll always be tamed.�
