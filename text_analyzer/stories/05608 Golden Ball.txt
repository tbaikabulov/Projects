&nbsp;

�Oh, blest are they who beheld these last years and
breathed their autumnal air full of rot and corruption! But twice blest is he
who suffered the touch of their knowing, sinful flesh...

������������ � From a medieval manuscript kept
at the abbey of St. Colomannus.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

1.

&nbsp;

One cold evening in late October, 1785, an open coach
rattled along the dark and narrow Parisian streets, its wheels disturbing the
chilly fog that crept over the flagstones. The sun had already set, and in the
deepening twilight the coach�s passengers appeared from a distance as three
black wraiths, whose hazy silhouettes were almost indistinguishable from the
gloomy background.

&nbsp;

Despite the sinister appearances, the travelers were quite
harmless: they were merely young women who wrapped themselves in heavy cloaks,
as much for the sake of anonymity, as for protection against the freezing mist.
Completing the disguises, their faces were half-hidden by deep hoods.

&nbsp;

The girls kept their heads together, conversing in low
tones.

&nbsp;

&quot;�But Isabelle,&quot; said one of the girls, the
tallest of the trio, &quot;How are we supposed to get inside? Is there a
password?&quot;

&nbsp;

The girl to whom this remark was addressed laughed huskily.
It was amazing how this deep soprano voice could issue from such a compact
body. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Oh, Charlotte, you worry too much. They�ll let us in,
you�ll see. I told you I have connections, and besides, they need someone like
us.&quot;

&nbsp;

Charlotte did not look reassured in the least. 

&nbsp;

Isabelle turned to the third girl, the shortest of the
three, and also the one with the most obviously female figure � even an
oversized man�s cloak could not obscure the shape of her impressive chest.

&nbsp;

&quot;And how about you, Florence? You seem awfully
quiet�&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I am scared,&quot; said the third girl, looking
straight ahead.

&nbsp;

Isabelle smiled indulgently. &quot;Of course you are scared.
I remember when I was in your shoes� ugh!&quot; 

&nbsp;

&quot;Well, I feel nervous, too,&quot; confessed Charlotte.

&nbsp;

&quot;You? Nervous?&quot; exclaimed Isabelle, genuinely
surprised, &quot;But I thought you've done it before!&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Of course I�ve done it before!&quot; replied
Charlotte, inadvertently raising her voice. She immediately looked behind at
the wide back of their driver; there was no way he could�ve heard her above the
thundering hoof beats but it was better to take no chances. &quot;Of course
I�ve done it before,&quot; Charlotte continued quietly, &quot;But not in these
circumstances!&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Believe me, you forget circumstances after the first
five minutes, and then it�s no different than the usual routine. There is no
reason to fear but, on the other hand, do not expect too much, either!&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Thank you, oh the wise one!&quot; scowled Charlotte.
&quot;Is there anything in life that this advice does not apply to?&quot;

&nbsp;

Isabelle smiled. &quot;Still, I hope you�ll find what you
are looking for, Charlotte. And you, Florence, I am sure you�ll lose what you
came to lose...&quot; 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

2.

&nbsp;

Half an hour later the company arrived at its destination,
the town mansion of a certain prominent Comte. Isabelle, who was entertaining
the company with the newest bawdy song about the Queen, stopped in mid-verse
and turned to the driver.

&nbsp;

&quot;You may leave us here, Jacques. We�ll find our own way
home.&quot; 

&nbsp;

The carriage came to a halt near an ornate wrought-iron
fence. The girls filed out, and the carriage rattled away, its rhythmic thumps
slowly receding with distance. Led by Isabelle, the girls approached the gate
and knocked. 

&nbsp;

Not a soul was in sight. The house seemed abandoned by the
inhabitants; it towered above the three small figures like a ghostly hulk,
empty, forbidding, with not a single spark of light visible through the dead
windows. Then something stirred in the garden among wilting autumn flowers and
gray shrubbery: an elderly servant was shuffling slowly toward the entrance. He
stopped on the other side and peered at the visitors through the thick bars.

&nbsp;

&quot;What do you want?&quot; the old man asked in a sharp,
unfriendly voice.

&nbsp;

&quot;We are here for the masquerade,&quot; replied Isabelle
on behalf of everyone.

&nbsp;

&quot;You are mistaken. There is no masquerade today. Now go
back!&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Right,&quot; said Isabelle but did not budge.

&nbsp;

The servant stared at the girls for a long time without
saying anything. At last, he turned back and began to shuffle away. Charlotte
and Florence looked at Isabelle but she was calm and showed no intention to
leave. Just before he was about to disappear again inside the house, the man
stopped and turned around. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Do you understand what kind of masquerade this
is?&quot; he asked, his expression no longer hostile.

&nbsp;

Isabelle only smiled. 

&nbsp;

&quot;In this case, please follow me.&quot;

&nbsp;

The girls were led through the garden toward a side
entrance, then up a staircase, and along a drafty corridor illuminated by smoky
torchlight. The old man stopped just before the corridor made a sharp turn.

&nbsp;

&quot;I am not allowed to pass beyond this point. Go forward
until you reach the end; there will be a red door on your right. It's a powder
room; use it if you need to prepare yourselves. Once you are ready, go out the
second door into the next corridor and find a green door. Farewell.&quot;

&nbsp;

Left without a guide, the girls continued on, meeting no one
on the way. The powder room was empty as well, smelling of dampness but warm
enough to take off the cloaks. The girls looked around, found a large wall
mirror, and, as is custom with women everywhere, immediately planted themselves
in front of it.

&nbsp;

Charlotte brushed her blond hair and twisted it into a long
braid that reached down to her waist. She was tall and slender, an acknowledged
beauty, whose delicate face with big�
blue eyes, was as perfect as a painting. Men dropped what they were
doing and stared at her, stunned and wounded, as she passed them without
notice. She had one flaw though, which, in her mind, almost outweighed her
other charms. Her breasts, in keeping with the rest of her thin figure, were
rather small; they were pretty in a girlish way but, to Charlotte�s eternal
anguish, not womanly. 

&nbsp;

Isabelle wasn't so much grooming herself as striking
sentimental poses. She was a year older than Charlotte and, in theory, not as
beautiful; yet men flocked to Isabelle, attracted to her female magnetism as
bees to honey. She had dark eyes, thin aquiline nose, and large passionate
mouth with full lips perfect for a kiss; her black curls fell freely over her
shoulders. She had dusky skin; it was rumored that Isabelle's real father was a
Spanish don.

&nbsp;

Florence watched her two friends and mentors, trying to
mimic their quick, sure movements. At seventeen, she was the youngest of the
three; baby fat was still evident in her face and all over her body. She was
red-haired and freckled; short but despite her young age, quite well-developed.
Her hips were wide and pleasantly round; but Florence�s most outstanding
attribute was her friends' envy and her own pride � soft, heavy breasts with
pretty pink nipples.

&nbsp;

It took a while, but at last the girls were satisfied with
their looks. They quickly put on their masks, which were simple narrow dominos
� hiding one�s face was not the point of this masquerade. Last look in the
mirror, and the girls were ready for what was waiting for them.

&nbsp;

Next corridor turned out to be an opulent enfilade of rooms
with marble floors and gilded ceilings. Exquisite paintings and Gobelins
decorated the walls. On the opposite side the enfilade terminated in a double
portal, painted clover green; one could hear muted sounds of revelry behind it.
There was no question; this was the green door that the old servant was talking
about. Suddenly shy, the girls slowly crossed the distance to the door and
opened it.

&nbsp;

They found themselves in a grand hall, spacious and brightly
lit, with the windows tightly shuttered. An invisible orchestra, its musicians
hidden behind a curtain, was playing a merry tune. It looked like everyone had
already arrived; the hall was full of people, nearly fifty of them, spread
around the floor either in pairs, or in small groups. There were rather more
men than women but it didn't seem to inconvenience anyone. Majority of the
guests were either lying, or sitting, or standing on their hands and knees;
only a few, mostly men, stood upright. Everyone wore a masque, usually quite
simple but sometimes very elaborate; some of these were real works of art,
imaginative and gorgeous. Other than the masques, no one wore any clothes.

&nbsp;

Charlotte surveyed nude bodies writhing in ecstasy at her
feet. &quot;Well, ladies, I suppose this is our cue to undress.&quot; The girls
removed their dresses, skirts, and corsets and threw them in a heap near the
door; then, keeping together for company, started walking toward the middle of
the floor.

&nbsp;

For Florence, being naked in front of everyone felt awkward,
uncomfortable, and weirdly exciting. She looked at her friends to see if they
shared her feelings but they appeared not to be bothered by their nudity in the
least. Isabelle was watching a large cluster of young men, trying to catch
their eye. She was breathing fast and moistened her lips from time to time; her
nostrils flared as if they caught a scent. A strange, predatory half-smile
flickered on her face. Charlotte, too, wore a predatory expression, but a
different one. She was turning her head from side, scanning the room, looking
at each man in turn; coldly rejecting most, noting a few. &quot;Is she looking
for someone she knows,&quot; wondered Florence, &quot;Or is she simply��?

&nbsp;

Slap! Crash! Next instant, Florence was sitting on the
floor, sparks dancing before her eyes. She winced, more from embarrassment than
from pain; thanks to her inattention, she bumped into one of the revelers.

&nbsp;

&quot;Mademoiselle,&quot; boomed a male voice above her, &quot;Pardon
my expression but � ouch!!!&quot; 

&nbsp;

The stranger wore a bird masque, a remarkable piece of work
complete with feathers and prodigious red beak. Florence had never seen such a
beak on any real bird: it was long and straight, and bright red; its tip terminated
in a knob that was moist and muskily fragrant. Below the mask the man was � oh,
God! � very obviously naked.

&nbsp;

Against her will, Florence's eyes traveled down the
stranger�s body. He was not tall or muscular but his deficiencies were more
than compensated by the extraordinary thing that stood erect under his stomach:
it was so enormous that Florence couldn't help but stare. The thing�s size,
proportion, and color were quite similar to the masque�s beak; its tip, which
was only a foot away from Florence�s face, was also moist and fragrant. 

&nbsp;

Suddenly Florence remembered herself. She blushed and looked
away quickly.

&nbsp;

The man laughed. &quot;It's quite all right to look; in
fact, you flatter me.&quot; He indulgently patted the girl�s on the back.
&quot;I am known as Maurice. And what is your name, oh lovely vision?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Florence,&quot; whispered the girl.

&nbsp;

&quot;What a charming name! I haven�t seen you before; did
you come here alone?&quot;

&nbsp;

Florence turned to her friends but they were no longer near.
Isabelle was a dozen paces ahead, on her knees and in the middle of a circle of
young impatient roosters; she was going at them energetically with her hands
and mouth, giving a part of her attention to every one. Charlotte made her way
to the opposite wall, where, in a semi-private nook partially shielded by
furniture, she was being embraced by an older gentleman.

&nbsp;

&quot;I see that your friends are busy,� noted the stranger.
&quot;But do not be alarmed. You are in good hands.&quot; 

&nbsp;

He bent down and touched the girl�s bare breasts. &quot;Did
I mention that you are very beautiful?&quot; he asked, while his finger was
tracing circles around her nipple. &quot;Now, be a good girl. Lie on you back
and spread your pretty legs.&quot; 

&nbsp;

Florence reddened even more but obeyed. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Just a little more� yes, that�s perfect! &quot;
Maurice looked at the girl who lied wide open before him. His eyes took in her
puffy, pillow-like breasts, her soft stomach, and below it, her secret cave
framed by flaming red hair. He peered closer and whistled in surprise; then,
without looking away, he extended his hand and grabbed a young man who at that
moment was going past the couple. &quot;Hey, Viscount, will you look at
this!&quot;

&nbsp;

Now two strangers were staring at Florence�s open pussy, and
she felt herself blush all over again. 

&nbsp;

The expression on the Viscount�s face was pure astonishment.
&quot;My God,&quot; he sputtered, &quot;can this be true? A real virgin in a
place like this?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes, my friend. I can hardly believe it myself.&quot;

&nbsp;

The men lowered themselves onto their haunches on either
side of the girl. &quot;Do not worry, Mademoiselle,&quot; said Maurice
earnestly; looking Florence straight in the eyes, while his hands had began
their explorations. &quot;I will be extremely gentle�&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

3.

&nbsp;

When the girls met again, it was nearly morning. Some guests
had already left; others, exhausted, lay in heaps around the floor; the party
was almost over, and the girls gathered near one of the entrances to rest and
to compare notes. Isabelle sat on a cushion, her back against the wall, legs
carelessly spread apart. Next to her was Florence, who assumed a more modest
position; Charlotte was sprawling on her side across from them. The girls were
still very much naked; even their masques were now long gone, discarded and
forgotten hours ago.

&nbsp;

&quot;So, how did you like the fucking?&quot; asked
Isabelle.

&nbsp;

&quot; Isabelle!&quot; exclaimed Florence, scandalized.

&nbsp;

&quot;Oh, come on, don�t be a prude. It�s just a word. A
word can�t be worse than the action, can it?&quot; 

&nbsp;

&quot;I suppose so,&quot; said Florence uncertainly.

&nbsp;

&quot;And you were fucking like a pro. In fact�&quot;
Isabelle�s eyes narrowed, &quot;�I wonder if you are as innocent as you
pretend. I was watching you. Five minutes into the room, and you manage to
snare Maurice de Croissac himself, the best phallus in the whole of France! How
did you do that?&quot;

&nbsp;

Florence beamed, pleased with the implied compliment. &quot;You
can say I simply ran into him,&quot; she giggled.

&nbsp;

Isabelle gave Florence a puzzled stare. At length she gave
up and turned to Charlotte. 

&nbsp;

&quot;And how was your hunt?&quot; Isabelle asked the blond
girl. &quot;Whom did you catch there? Was it a Count? A Duke? A Marshal of
France?&quot;

&nbsp;

Charlotte smiled mischievously but said nothing.

&nbsp;

&quot;Ladies, talk to me!&quot; pressed Isabelle. &quot;This
was your first orgy; how did you like it?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Not bad,&quot; answered Charlotte, &quot; Good
selection here; many opportunities. Saves time, too � it would take me forever
to meet these men one by one.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;It was a bit painful and uncomfortable at first,&quot;
said Florence, &quot;But then�&quot; She smiled at the memories.

&nbsp;

&quot;But I noticed something about men,&quot; Florence
continued after a pause. &quot;They are so easily exhausted! And even worse,
once they are done with you, they lose all interest.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Thanks for sharing your discovery,&quot; scoffed
Charlotte.

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes, this is the nature of men.&quot; sagely intoned
Isabelle. &quot;They poke you, then they forget you. This is why you don�t fuck
just one. You need to have many of them � a whole herd, the more the merrier �
so when you exhaust one you immediately go to the next.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;No matter how many of them there are, they all want
the same thing!&quot; lashed out Charlotte, &quot;They want stick their dicks
in you and move them in and out until they spout their disgusting goo! Even the
best of them think of their own satisfaction first.&quot;

&nbsp;

If Isabelle was taken aback by her friend�s unexpected
vehemence she did not show it. She gave Charlotte a mock-compassionate look.
&quot;Disgusting goo, eh? I see. You exalted Count made you drink his cum. You
poor baby. But don't worry, you can get used to the taste. Trust me: I must've
drunk a pint of the stuff today.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes, I saw the chaps lining up next to you,&quot;
nodded Charlotte listlessly.

&nbsp;

Isabelle thought a little. &quot;Well, if you tired of boys
we can make a little trip to the Isle of Lesbos.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Oh, I�ve tried that too.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;And?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;That�s even worse. Why do I need to look someone
else's cunt and boobs if I�ve already got my own set!&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Ladies, please watch your language!&quot; begged
Florence. 

&nbsp;

&quot;I can see you point, Charlotte,&quot; admitted
Isabelle. &quot;I like fucking but it does get... how shall I say it? It does
get repetitive.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;The word you are looking for is boring!&quot; cried
Charlotte. &quot;Boring, boring, boring! And disgusting!&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Good evening, ladies, or shall I say good
morning?&quot; said a new female voice, deep and clear like chiming of bells.

&nbsp;

Startled by an unexpected intrusion, the girls looked up. A
woman stood next to them, a spectacular mature beauty in her early forties. She
was not one of the guests; and she wasn�t nude but wore a lacy, corseted dress
made of rich red fabric and cut low to show off the ample bosom. Her neck was
decorated by a sparkling diamond necklace and her fingers glittered with rubies
and emeralds.

&nbsp;

&quot;Nice to see you again, Isabelle,&quot; the woman said,
&quot;And this, if I am not mistaken, must be Charlotte and young
Florence.&quot;

&nbsp;

Isabelle jumped to her feet. &quot;Oh, Comtesse! I did not
see you approach us until you spoke!&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;That�s quite all right; I meant to do that,&quot;
smiled the woman.

&nbsp;

&quot;This is our hostess,&quot; Isabelle explained to her
friends, who got up as well and gave their regards.

&nbsp;

&quot;Unfortunately, I couldn't join you here today,&quot;
said the Comtesse, &quot;I had urgent business at court. But once I was free I
had to come and see how my guests were doing. Charlotte, Florence, this is your
first orgy, isn�t it? Thank you for taking a chance and attending this little
affair; we are always in need of the new blood�&quot; the Comtesse noticed red
stains on Florence's inner thighs and added smoothly, &quot;�as it were.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;How is the Comte?&quot; asked Isabelle politely.

&nbsp;

&quot;He is upstairs, sound asleep. At his age, he needs his
naps.&quot; The Comtesse made an indefinite gesture. A new thought occurred to
her; she instantly forgot about her husband. She eyed the girls critically.
Yes, they were curious, discontented, and open to new ideas; it could work. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Pardon me, ladies, but I couldn't help but overhear
the last part of your conversation,&quot; she said to them. 

&nbsp;

Isabelle shifted uncomfortably. &quot;Oh, there is no need
to apologize for the coarse words,&quot; the Comtesse said quickly, &quot;I am
no stranger to them myself. It is the substance of your complaints that I find
remarkable.&quot; 

&nbsp;

She paused for effect. &quot;So you are no longer satisfied
with lovemaking? No man is good enough for you? Such shocking cynicism! but
what else can you expect from modern youth? Why, when I was your age I
worshipped man's flesh! and I didn't get that jaded until I was, well let's
see�&quot; she smiled &quot;�about three or four years older than you.&quot;

&nbsp;

The girls, who were bracing for a scolding harangue, visibly
relaxed and returned the smile. 

&nbsp;

&quot;So what did you do then, Madame?&quot; asked Charlotte
eagerly.

&nbsp;

&quot;Please, no 'Madame' between us! Well, the first thing
I did was to marry a rich old man and to acquire resources to pursue other
avenues. For instance, have you found a certain small room adjacent to this
hall?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;You mean the one with whips, chains, and other such
things?&quot; asked Isabelle. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes, that�s the one. It�s a gathering place for the
followers of that mad Marquis, who is now languishing in Bastille for having
the audacity to preach what others practice.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes, we spent time in that room. Not Florence though:
she got scared.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;And how did you like it?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;It was�&quot; started Isabelle.

&nbsp;

&quot;It was interesting,&quot; interrupted her Charlotte.
&quot; They had us hog-tied, then subjected to mildly painful and some
humiliating ordeals�&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I hear a 'but' in your voice�&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes. It got boring after a while. See, Isabelle agrees
with me. It had no real danger, no excitement� All in all, it was just a
game.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;My, you are quick,&quot; marveled the Comtesse,
&quot;It took me a whole year to come to the same conclusion.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;So there is no hope,&quot; said Charlotte glumly.

&nbsp;

The older woman put a hand on the girl�s naked shoulder.
&quot;There is hope,&quot; she told her quietly. &quot;There exists a method
for achieving great satisfaction. It�s not widely known because, though it�s
easy to do, it�s hard to do right; but people had been employing it for
centuries. Listen to this.&quot; 

&nbsp;

She was silent for a spell, collecting her thoughts. The
girls waited patiently. At last, the Comtesse took a deep breath and began to
speak.

&nbsp;

&quot;Two are the vessels of pleasure that any man can see
and touch, &quot; she recited in an eerily hypnotizing, singsong voice.
&quot;These are the goblet of bitter grape and the womb of a beautiful maiden.
Pleasant they are indeed and will serve ye well enough, yet both are but a
bleak shadow of the heavenly libations tasted by the wise ones. Behold the
garden of unearthly delights that are stronger than wine and sweeter than love,
harken to the harps and lutes that play divine music beyond the mortal ken!
Happy is he who had made his way hither for he had found bliss. But beware o
traveler! Many had tried to reach the garden but few succeeded, for the path is
narrow and obscure and its stones sharp. Do not seek the aid of magical
talismans, nor of rare elixirs; they will not avail thee but will lead thee
astray. Yet despair not, for the true road is hidden in plain sight! Whether
thou be man or maiden, rich or poor, saint or sinner, the way is open to all;
indeed, it is the poor sinner who, unwittingly and against his will, makes the
trek most often. Follow me and I shall teach you the way�&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;�And so on, and so forth,&quot; said the Comtesse a
different tone. &quot;I can quote this all day, you know.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Please tell us about this method!&quot; Charlotte
cried impatiently. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes, yes, what is it?&quot; joined her Isabelle.

&nbsp;

&quot;I am dying of curiosity!&quot; added Florence.

&nbsp;

The older woman shook her head. &quot;I'm afraid you will
think me mad.&quot; 

&nbsp;

It took the girls good five minutes to coax the answer out
of the Comtesse. At last, she broke down and gathered them in a tight circle.
She whispered, making swift explanatory gestures, and when she was finished,
the girls just stared at her, wide-eyed and open-mouthed.

&nbsp;

&quot;You are in shock and yet you do not flee. That's a
good sign,&quot; remarked the woman.

&nbsp;

&quot;And I thought I�ve heard everything!&quot; exhaled
Isabelle, who was the first to regain the power of speech.

&nbsp;

&quot;So, to achieve this heavenly bliss of yours, &quot;
slowly said Charlotte, &quot;All you have to do is to hang yourself by the neck
until you pass out?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;That�s a pretty good summary,&quot; agreed the
Comtesse.

&nbsp;

Charlotte thought a little. &quot;Hmm. Makes sense.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;It does? Why do you say that?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;It�s just something I saw once. Two summers ago I was
visiting my native town and saw a quadruple hanging. It was a gang of robbers,
four handsome young men. They hung them in the main square; but before they
strung them up they ripped all their clothes off...&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Just like in the old days, huh,&quot; mused the
Comtesse. &quot;I thought the King forbade naked hanging.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Where I am from they do it anyway,&quot; replied the
girl. She continued. &quot;I was near the gallows and could see everything
clearly; once the boys started to dangle, I saw their rods grow to an enormous
size. They swung back and forth, jerking around and stabbing the air with their
cocks. Before long they were squirting so hard that one of the drops flew all the
way to me and landed on my cheek � a lucky catch, my grandmother said.&quot;

&nbsp;

Florence nodded energetically, &quot;I remember, my Nanny
once told me that hanged men have carnal intercourse with she-devils. I never
understood what she meant, until now. Well, if hanged men make love to
she-devils, then hanged women do it with he-devils,&quot; she added reasonably.

&nbsp;

&quot;Fucking with devils?&quot; chuckled Isabelle,
&quot;That suits me perfectly. I am sure devils are much better lovers than
mere mortals.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Nanny also said,&quot; went on Florence, &quot;that
after the she-devil is done with her man she takes his soul. Now, everyone
knows that when people die the soul flies out of their mouths; but not so with
hanged men. Their throats are closed, so the she-devil has to pull their souls
out of the opposite orifice. I always wondered, what if they hang a girl? Then
the devil has a choice of two holes�&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;If I am ever executed by hanging,&quot; declared
Isabelle, &quot;My soul will go out of my cunt.&quot; She giggled. &quot;That�s
where it resides anyway!&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes, it�s certainly true for a famous slut like
you,&quot; laughed Charlotte. Isabelle gave her a mock-injured look.

&nbsp;

Florence was horrified. &quot;Please don�t blaspheme!&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Oh, you and your silly beliefs,&quot; dismissed her
Isabelle. &quot; Try and read modern philosophers. All this talk about souls
and devils is nothing more than superstition; if people really do enjoy
swinging in the noose it must be due to various body humours and gases.&quot;

&nbsp;

Smiling but saying nothing, the Comtesse listened to the
girls� banter. She had them just where she wanted; now, to give them a little
push�

&nbsp;

&quot;It was great talking to you, ladies,&quot; she said
aloud. &quot;I have to go. A pity I missed the orgy but oh well. As you know, I
have other ways of satisfying myself and that�s what I intend to do now. Have a
wonderful day and even better night.&quot;

&nbsp;

She turned as if to leave. Unexpectedly, it was Florence who
called her first. &quot;Madame, wait! Please wait! I�d like to learn more about
this mysterious garden! Will you show it to me?&quot; 

&nbsp;

&quot;A garden of delights�&quot; said Charlotte wistfully.
She touched a certain spot on her cheek and straightened. &quot;My lady, with
your permission I�d like to join you.&quot;

&nbsp;

Isabelle looked from one of her friends to the other and
shrugged. &quot;I don�t believe in this fairy tale about mystic gardens. But on
the other hand, I tried all other perversions in the world, so why not this
one? Count me in!&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;In this case, follow me,&quot; said Comtesse.

&nbsp;

She reached into her cleavage and pulled out a key, which
she used to unlock an unremarkable side door. She paused on the threshold,
turned, and beckoned. Florence made a move to get the clothes but her friends
pulled her after them.

&nbsp;

&quot;What do you need a dress for? Let�s go!&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

4.

&nbsp;

The four of them descended a circular stairway, so narrow
and tight that it could only be negotiated in a single file. The mistress of
the house led the way, her shoes making rhythmic click-clicks and her long
skirts trailing behind carelessly. In one hand she carried a two-candle
candelabrum that provided feeble and unsteady light. The girls did their best
to follow the older woman. The stone steps were cool on their bare feet but not
uncomfortably so; still they had to tread cautiously, as the stairs were
slippery with tiny drops of dew. Soon, the Comtesse was so far ahead that the girls
had lost the sight of her around several bends; yet they could still see the
light below and hear her voice, which in this small space was loud though
somewhat distorted by stony echoes.

&nbsp;

&quot;You must be wondering how I learned about the erotic
properties of hanging,&quot; the Comtesse was saying. &quot;Well, it started
when my childhood friend joined a convent� Have you heard about the order of
St. Colomannus? No, I am sure you haven�t � it�s small and obscure, fewer than
fifty nuns in the whole Europe. The remarkable thing about this order is that
its members for centuries have been secretly practicing self-asphyxiation. They
called it mortification of flesh, which it was, in a sense. Of course, the
spirit was another matter but the Church hierarchy had never wised up to it.
One evening, ten years ago, my friend came to visit; one thing led to another,
and before I knew it, her hands were around my neck. That night she showed me
the ropes, so to speak. Afterwards, we spent many pleasant hours hanging
together until she was transferred to the Spanish chapter of the order. She
told me that in Madrid the nuns prefer garrotte to the gallows; that�s
something I haven�t tried yet� Anyway, remember that manuscript I was quoting
from? It was written two hundred years ago by a prioress of St. Colomannus as a
guide for novices. Yes, a woman wrote this thing for other women! Never mind
the use of 'he', it�s just a figure of speech. And what a great treatise!
Despite the flowery language it�s very practical and has plenty of good advice
but it explains some basic mysteries, too. I learned a lot from it. For
example, the good prioress tells us that, although erotic effects of
asphyxiation are better visible on a male body, we girls feel them much
stronger. She explains it by the differences in male an female natures: where a
man strives to penetrate, a woman seeks to submit; and what submission could be
more complete than when you give yourself to the loving embrace of a tight
noose� Oh dear, I am chattering� am I boring you? It�s not going to be much
longer because we are almost there.&quot;

&nbsp;

And so they were. The stairway led into cobwebbed cellar
that terminated in a row of rusty iron doors, which looked as though they
haven't been used in decades. The Comtesse took out the same key she used
before, unlocked one of the doors, and pushed it with all her strength. The
door swung back on its corroded hinges with a bone-chilling whine. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Welcome to my grim dungeon!&quot; exclaimed the
Comtesse.

&nbsp;

What she called a dungeon was actually a large underground
chamber, not grim at all but on the contrary, quite comfortable. It was clean,
well lit, dry, and pleasantly warm thanks to a cozy fireplace built into the
opposite wall. There was no furniture but the floor was strewn with layers of
soft rugs, and the Comtesse immediately kicked off her shoes. After the hard
cold stone under their feet the girls, too, were relieved to feel the rich
softness of Persian weave.

&nbsp;

&quot;I love this place!&quot; exclaimed Florence. She made
a step, looked around, and gasped. &quot;Oh my God! Who is that?&quot;

&nbsp;

One corner of the chamber was a cage, closed off with a thin
but sturdy iron latticework. Inside it, on a rickety little stool, sat a
stern-looking old man attired in the traditional painter's garb. Next to him
was an easel with stretched blank canvass; a palette rested on his lap; and on
all sides he was surrounded by arrays of brushes, pots of pigment, charcoal,
and other attributes of his art.

&nbsp;

&quot;Oh, hello, Jean-Honor�&quot; said the Comtesse,
&quot;You are earlier than usual today.&quot;

&nbsp;

The man stood up and bowed. 

&nbsp;

&quot;This is Monsieur Fragonard, a painter of some
renown,&quot; explained the Comtesse, &quot;I employ him to paint the events in
this room. Florence, I like your modesty but you don�t have to hide your charms
from Monsieur Fragonard: being a painter, he is quite used to the sight of
naked girls.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Is he� imprisoned?&quot; asked Charlotte.

&nbsp;

&quot;Of course not! You can�t see it from this angle but
there is a door behind him that leads straight to the garden. He is free to
leave any time. What he cannot do is to come into this part of the room. No
matter what happens, he cannot interfere � hence the cage! Now give him no more
of your attention but please turn around and look over there.&quot;� 

&nbsp;

The girls peered obediently in the direction that the
Comtesse was pointing. There was not much to see there yet: the far side of the
chamber was hidden behind a ceiling-high, wall-to-wall curtain. A few energetic
strides, and the Comtesse stood right next to it. The woman could hardly
contain herself; her face was shining; she almost danced with impatience and
excitement. 

&nbsp;

She grabbed a handful of heavy velvet. &quot;Behold my Bliss
Machine!&quot; she cried and with a dramatic gesture threw the curtain open. 

&nbsp;

Now that the place could be seen in its entirety, it became
clear that in a previous life it was a small private theater. The curtain
revealed a raised wooden stage complete with a prompter�s booth and the remains
of old decorations; once upon a time this stage was used to perform plays; now,
however, it was occupied by a baffling apparatus. 

&nbsp;

This hulking, insane-looking contraption reached halfway to
the distant ceiling, yet it was more wide than it was tall. It was hard to make
out its basic shape, as the thing was a sprawling, unbelievably complicated
jumble of parts � the springs, the gears, the axles, the belts, the water
vessels of various shapes and sizes connected by the glass tubes that joined,
divided, and crossed each other at crazy angles. The machine was topped by six
long, knobby metal rods that extended forward, spreading out fan-like, which
made them look like six digits of an enormous skeletal hand. Each rod carried a
system of pulleys and winches with large reels of fine rope attached at the
tips; the reels were partially unwound, so the rope was hanging freely from the
height, long enough to reach the ground and coil on the floor.

&nbsp;

&quot;You are looking at the one and only device for
controlled asphyxiation, &quot; said the Comtesse. &quot;If you like, you can
call it mechanical gallows. There is only one such machine in the world and I
happened to own it. I wish I could tell more people about it; even though it
accommodates six bodies, most of the time I use it alone. I always try to get
my lovers to join me, but so far only a few took me on my offer� and, believe
it or not, the ladies are much braver in this respect than most men� Anyway,
let me show you how this thing works!&quot; 

&nbsp;

She led her guests onto the stage. The girls carefully
approached the looming machinery, which up close seemed even less
comprehensible than at a distance.

&nbsp;

&quot;The machine is powered by running water, &quot; said
the Comtesse. &quot;Do you see that huge copper cylinder near the top?&quot;
she pointed, &quot;It�s the water barrel, which has to be filled before you
start. For this purpose, one is supposed to use this hydraulic pump over here,
but I just get my servants to haul buckets up a ladder. Once the barrel is
full, the machine is ready to go. You pull a trigger mechanism, the barrel is
unstoppered, and the water starts to flow. On its way down it rotates the drum.&quot;


&nbsp;

The Comtesse tapped on the gleaming metal surface of a
vertically mounted disk. It boomed in response, exactly like a real drum.
&quot;It's hollow inside,&quot; she explained. &quot;Let me show you what it
contains.&quot; 

&nbsp;

She opened a wooden screen and reached deep inside the
mechanism. &quot;Aha! Got it!&quot; She pulled her hand out to show what she
caught. Between her thumb and middle finger she held a white, walnut-sized ball
� a faultless sphere carved out of the hardest African ivory and carefully
polished.

&nbsp;

&quot;There are sixty-six
of these balls in the drum, all perfectly identical&quot; said the Comtesse.
&quot;After the drum makes two or three revolutions,
a hole opens in
its side and six
balls fall through. These balls are guided by
a system of grooves and pipes to six hidden levers,
one for each crane. Now, if a lever is locked, the ball simply rolls past and
eventually returns to the drum; nothing happens. This is why if you intend to
use a crane you unlock its lever first.&quot;

&nbsp;

The Comtesse led the
girls to the rear of the stage and made them stand on all fours. &quot;This is
what a lever looks like,&quot; she pointed. By now, Charlotte's eyes were
glazed over and Florence was barely suppressing a yawn. But Isabelle, who was
mechanicaly inclined, burned with interest.

&nbsp;

&quot;I think I see what happens here!&quot; she exclaimed
excitedly. &quot;A ball lands into a slot on one end of the lever and pushes that end down.
The lever releases this gear over here, which... umm... lifts the noose
somehow?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Very good! Yes, the
released gear, through a system of pulleys, belts, and other gears, causes the
running water to turn the block on top of a crane. The rope is wounded on the
block, and whoever is standing under the crane is lifted into the air! But look
at the other end of the lever. Do you see why it is shaped like a cup?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Not particularly.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Simple. The cup serves as
a counterweight. Right after the
lever switches into
the 'hanging' position the water starts to drip
into the cup until it outweighs the ivory ball. Then
the lever goes back to the horizontal position, the rope is unwound, and the
hanging body is lowered to the floor! You can even choose how long you hang by
regulating the speed of water with this dial.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Amazing,&quot; remarked
Charlotte in a dry, ironic tone.

&nbsp;

&quot;Well, it is an ingenious
machine,&quot; answered the Comtesse levelly. &quot;It was designed by one of
my former lovers, who was a Navy engineer and a man of unusual sexual tastes. I
am sorry to say that he killed himself in one of his mad experiments:
somehow, he made lightning flow through his genitals and it proved too much
even for him. But I see you are getting impatient, so how about a little
demonstration?&quot;

&nbsp;

Florence instantly perked up.
&quot;A demonstration?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes, yes, certainly!&quot;
put in Charlotte.

&nbsp;

The Comtesse hurried back to the
front. She unlocked a lever and made an adjustment to the time dial, then stood
under one of the cranes. Bending gracefully, she picked up an end of the
coiled rope, quickly made a competent noose, and put it on her neck.

&nbsp;

&quot;Oh, how I love the feel of soft rope against my
skin!&quot; she crooned to herself, tightening the knot.

&nbsp;

She seemed to recall the existence of her guests.
&quot;Ladies, do you see that chain?&quot; she asked them. &quot;It�s the
trigger. Now, which one of you will give me a favor of pulling it?&quot;

&nbsp;

No one moved.

&nbsp;

&quot;Fine, I�ll do it myself!&quot;

&nbsp;

There was the sudden rush of water and a loud banging of
balls inside the drums. A few seconds later the banging stopped.

&nbsp;

&quot;Like a clockwork!&quot; exclaimed the Comtesse. &quot;The drum had stopped turning, and
now� did you hear that knock? That was my ball falling into its place. So the
next step is� aha! there goes the rope! But I have to wait before I hang: it
takes time to remove all this slack. Oh how I love this delicious
anticipation; it make me hot already! And now, look closely; I am about to go up.
Sweet suffocation, here I come!&quot;

&nbsp;

The rope tugged at her neck, squeezing and stretching it;
she was forced to stand on her toes for a second or two, then she was hoisted
up in the air. She sluggishly swung back and forth, turned this way and that;
her bare feet dangled just inches above the floor, and the long train of her
skirt swept the floorboards in time with the lazy rhythm of her swaying. The noose made her head tilt sharply to the side messing
up her hair. The Comtesse did not look like she was enjoying the experience:
her eyes were tightly shut, teeth
clenched, mouth frozen in a grimace of pained consternation,
and the veins on her throat bulged blue. She never moved a limb, but her face was getting
progressively redder until it was had assumed a scary, unnatural shade of
scarlet; at one point she tried to take a breath but all it got her was a
convulsion and a slightly more energetic swaying.

&nbsp;

Something clicked inside the apparatus, and the rope started
to pay out. The woman was lowered to the ground. When her
feet touched the floor, the noose was instantly undone and the rope fell
freely next to her body. She staggered but stood on
her own for several heartbeats; then her knees buckled and she collapsed into a
heap. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Oh my God, the Comtesse is
dying!&quot; cried Florence. 

&nbsp;

The girls moved to help.
Florence had laid the seemingly unconscious woman on the back while Isabelle
and Charlotte fumbled with the dress laces. The Comtesse's face was almost as
red as it has been when she was strangling in the noose but now that feverish
redness spread to her chest and shoulders. Her breath was raspy, shallow, and
much too rapid; she opened her mouth as if to say something but the only sound
that came out of her throat was a piteous moan.

&nbsp;

&quot;She is getting worse!&quot; panicked Florence.

&nbsp;

&quot;No, no! I am
alright,&quot; croaked the lying woman without
opening her eyes.

&quot;Don't you see?... I am... coming...&quot;

&nbsp;

She placed her left hand between her legs and began to rub
herself shamelessly. Sweat poured down her temples.
Her moans grew louder, and now the air was full of sharp
feminine odor. She shuddered, arched her back, and made a piercing cry that
echoed from the walls. Then she relaxed with a
content smile.

&nbsp;

&quot;I've seen a woman come before,&quot; muttered
Isabelle, &quot;I should've recognized the signs.&quot;

&nbsp;

Charlotte whistled and gave the Comtesse an incredulous
stare, &quot;All this, after hanging for twenty seconds? I am quite
impressed!&quot; 

&nbsp;

&quot;Oh, this was nothing,&quot; The older woman shrugged
dismissively. &quot;I wasn�t swinging long enough to climax properly, so I had
to finish myself by hand afterwards. But if I remained in the noose for a
minute or more I would have had an orgasm right in the air! Or two orgasms, or
three� I doubt you'd notice that � all you'd see would be a few slight
convulsions of my legs and stomach and perhaps some moisture around the pussy �
but for me the experience would've been a hundred times more enjoyable.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Do you suppose it will be the same for us?&quot; asked
Florence.

&nbsp;

&quot;Certainly, if you do it right.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Then I say let us hang without delay!&quot; declared
the girl. She looked at her friends� faces, &quot;I think I speak for everyone
here.&quot;

&nbsp;

Isabelle nodded vigorously and made the thumb-under-the-chin
noose sign. &quot;Yes, and let us hang ten times as long!&quot; exclaimed
Charlotte with unexpected passion.

&nbsp;

The Comtesse was taken aback. &quot;Ladies, you have to be
careful! Subjecting yourself to this for too long is not safe!&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Safe?&quot; repeated Isabelle contemptuously.
&quot;Ha! Who wants to be safe?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;There has to be danger, or there is no excitement,&quot;
explained Florence, &quot;Take me, for example. I came to the orgy being afraid
of, but hoping for, a gang of rogues who would treat me like a dirty whore. It
made me tingle to imagine the debauchery. But what I saw instead was a
congregation of civil gentlemen who were so courteous that their lovemaking
felt much like a marriage bed�&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;�In other words, boring,&quot; interrupted Charlotte.
&quot;Please Comtesse, this may be our last chance to escape boredom!&quot;

&nbsp;

The woman smiled tolerantly. &quot;Ah, the impetuousness of
youth. I was just like that myself, years ago. Did you know that after I hung
myself the first time it took the nuns a whole night to revive me?&quot;

&nbsp;

The girls begged in unison, &quot;Please, Madame,
please.&quot; 

&nbsp;

&quot;Well, I can see you point,&quot; conceded the
Comtesse, &quot;Still, hanging for too long is not a good idea. It could kill
you; or worse, it could cripple you for life. But, if you really want danger
and excitement, there is another, clean way.&quot;

&nbsp;

The Comtesse opened a hidden compartment in the machine and
produced a small mahogany box. Inside, resting on a black velvet pillow laid a
shiny ball, a twin to the ivory balls inside the drum, except that it was made
of brightly polished, reddish-yellow metal.

&nbsp;

&quot;This is the golden ball,&quot; said Comtesse, &quot;It
is the same size as the other balls, only much, much heavier. If you mix it
with the others, and it happens to fall onto a lever, no amount of water can
outweigh it. Thus, the noose will never be lowered, and the unlucky girl will
remain hanging until she dies. Do you want to do this?&quot;

&nbsp;

The girls� eyes lit up.

&nbsp;

&quot;Ooh, a death lottery! I like it!&quot; said Isabelle.

&nbsp;

&quot;Definitely not boring,&quot; agreed Charlotte.

&nbsp;

Florence hesitated. &quot;I�d love to do it but I would hate
to lose one of you.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;How sweet,&quot; responded Charlotte with only a tiny
trace of sarcasm in her voice.

&nbsp;

&quot;Don�t worry about me,&quot; said Isabelle merrily,
&quot;I plan to end my life on the scaffold anyway. So, are you in?&quot;

&nbsp;

Florence nodded. &quot;We are ready,&quot; said Charlotte
addressing the Comtesse.

&nbsp;

&quot;Very well.&quot; The Comtesse removed an ivory ball
from the drum and tossed it in a corner. Next, she replaced it with the golden
ball and turned to the girls. &quot;I have to say that I haven't used the
golden ball myself: the older you get, the less brave you become. But you had
inspired me; I decided to join you.&quot; She waited for the applause to die
down. &quot;Now, for the final preparations.&quot;

&nbsp;

She picked up a small basket and distributed its contents �
soft leather strips, four inches wide. &quot;Wrap this around your necks before
you hang � I neglected it in my haste; now I have to wear collars to hide this
ugly red imprint.&quot;

&nbsp;

While the girls did that, the Comtesse sat on the floor
tying four nooses. She straightened. &quot;All�s ready. Ladies, come here and
put on these on. Place the knots behind you right ear. Later on you can
experiment with other positions but now you�ll have to listen to me.&quot; 

&nbsp;

She paced in front of the three noosed girls like an officer
in front the troops. &quot;There is something that I have to teach you about
hanging.&quot; She extended her hand and touched
Florence's throat tracing her finger from the chin down to the breastbone.
&quot;Your delicate necks are not used to such stretching,&quot; she
said to her and to the others. &quot;There will be pain but you must ignore it.
It will go away soon. Conserve your strength. Do not try to reach the floor and
do not try to inhale: it is futile and will only cause you to expend your
energy. Do not fight the noose. The noose is your friend and your lover, let it
embrace you gently and hold you tight. And above all, do not panic! Fear chases
away joy and invites misery; so empty your mind and do not be afraid, or you
will not enter the Garden.&quot; 

&nbsp;

The Comtesse looked at the girls, who stared back at her,
eyes wide as saucers. She laughed at their expressions. &quot;Did I scare you?
Trust me, it�s not so bad. Oh, how I envy you! To hang for the first time� to
experience these indescribable sensations for the first time� But enough words.
Let�s swing!&quot;

&nbsp;

She stepped to the vacant spot next to Florence, lifted the
fourth noose from the floor, and put it on. Now they all stood in a row facing
the front of the stage � three nude girls and a sumptuously dressed but
barefoot older woman.

&nbsp;

&quot;One, two, three... Pull!&quot;

&nbsp;

Four winches started to turn. 

&nbsp;

Florence was watching the rope as a rabbit watches an
approaching snake. She was visibly trembling.

&nbsp;

&quot;Got cold feet, little girl?&quot; sneered at her
Isabelle, &quot;It's not too late for you to get out of here and go play with
dolls.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Shut up, Isabelle,&quot; said Charlotte in a quiet but
unsteady voice. &quot;You're just trying to cover your own nervousness.&quot;

&nbsp;

Florence attempted an indignant look but her heart wasn�t in
it. &quot;I am just a bit cold, that's all,&quot; she protested, &quot;It only
looks like I am afr�&quot;

&nbsp;

She was interrupted by the noose. As the shortest of the
four, Florence was lifted off the ground first; an instant later it was
Isabelle�s turn, with the Comtesse quickly following. The tall Charlotte was
the last whose feet were separated from the floor. Four short gulps, one after
another, escaped four closing throats. The only sounds one could hear after
that were merrily tinkling of running water, busy scratching of charcoal on paper, and soft creaking of iron beams burdened with the weight of four
swaying bodies.

&nbsp;

The Comtesse quickly settled into the familiar routine. She
knew what to do now: clench the teeth to prevent yourself from biting your
tongue but let the other muscles relax; let the rope have it way with your
neck; watch the pretty colored spots before your eyes and wait for the glorious
feeling of drunkenness; then climax as hard as you can until you are embraced
by sweet blackness. It was hard to think about anything outside her own body
but she had to see how her charges were doing.

&nbsp;

The woman opened her eyes and moved the pupils to the side.
She no longer had the freedom to turn her head but from a corner of an eye she
could see her gallows mates. It was a pandemonium. The inexperienced girls were
twisting, flailing their limbs, and trying to grab the rope; they swayed
wildly, shaking the whole structure; they often hit or scratched themselves and
each other. Isabelle was the worst of the lot: she applied herself to the
gallows dance with the same manic energy she applied to anything else she did.

&nbsp;

&quot;They move too much,&quot; thought the Comtesse hazily.
&quot;I should've bound their arms and legs.&quot; She closed her eyes and
threw herself into the rising waters of the ocean of joy. Swimming in its dark
waves, drowning in pleasure, she altogether forgot about the girls.

&nbsp;

After a while, everyone quieted down. Isabelle still made
various figures of unspeakable indecency; but Charlotte and Florence only
jerked their legs as though trying to kick their invisible demon lovers. One by
one the girls went limp, and a careful observer could see that their pussies were
now dripping a viscous liquid. The Comtesse, who was adept at keeping herself
aware while strangling, lost consciousness the last.� 

&nbsp;

Four female bodies stood on air in a neat line like soldiers
on parade: arms stretched along the sides, feet slightly apart, heads tilted in
the same exact angle and direction as though they were making some kind of a
bizarre salute. Occasional sudden spasms or tremors did not subtract from the
tranquility of the scene. At last, the time was up. Loud knocks � one, two, three
of them � came from the inside of the machine. Three winches started to turn,
and three nerveless bodies began their slow descent toward land of the living.
The fourth winch, however, did not even budge. Water continued to pour into the
now useless cup until it overflowed, creating little waterfall. 

&nbsp;

The golden ball had claimed its sacrifice.

&nbsp;

The next tableau was immortalized in a well-known, anonymous
painting titled &quot;Bad Luck.&quot; Three pleasure-seekers were spread on the
floor in random yet lasciviously picturesque poses; they were unconscious and
seemingly asleep. Above them floated the body of the fourth, who too seemed to
be sleeping but really was strangled to death � gone beyond all help, never to
breathe again, never to open her eyes. Death smoothed her features almost to
the point of puffiness. Her breasts and stomach were touched by soft light that
made the skin glow with unearthly whiteness; but owning to suffocation, her
face was dark. She simply hung there with neither want nor care, beautiful and
inert at the same time, like a personification of Murdered Innocence; and her
expression reflected both the pain and the satisfaction she experienced while
dying.

&nbsp;

At last, someone stirred. Young Florence was the first who
had come to her senses. When she managed to focus her eyes she gasped: the
first thing she saw were the soles of two bare feet suspended right above her
face. She crawled away from under them and lifted her head to look at the
lifeless form� then gave out an abrupt hysteric shriek followed by a wail of
despair.

&nbsp;

Poor unlucky Charlotte was always complaining about boredom.
Now, swaying peacefully at the end of a noose, she would never be bored again.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

EPILOGUE

&nbsp;

Florence and Isabelle were devastated and they never stopped
mourning their friend. Nevertheless, the very next week they returned to the
Comtesse�s house and once again put on the nooses. They continued to come week
after week and with time, they became quite adept at using the Bliss Machine. 

&nbsp;

And they were no longer quite so alone. The girls had many
acquaintances, some of which were willing to try new thing. Thus, Florence and
Isabelle, together with the Comtesse, became the core of a secret club that was
named, naturally, &quot;Soci�t� de la Boule d'or.&quot; The society was very
democratic: its members counted among themselves nobles and commoners, young
maidens and respectable matrons, and even, just for laughs, a few men.

&nbsp;

They gathered in the same underground theater that housed
the Bliss Machine. The Comtesse, who was always presiding over these meetings,
invariably opened the night by choosing a man, ordering him to strip naked in
front of the whole assembly, and stringing him up by his neck. Watching a man's
cock grow in size immensely while its owner floundered in the air was a
favorite warm-up show for the ladies.

&nbsp;

Next item on the agenda was the pledge ceremony for the new
members. The ceremony was extremely simple: all aspiring members who came
forward were required to repeat the words of the oath while they stood on
chairs with nooses around their necks. At the end of the ceremony the chairs
were removed.

&nbsp;

This done, the company entertained itself by setting up a
grand debate (which, at the time, was considered a fashionable party
amusement.) The Comtesse would choose a relevant topic, like &quot;Who has more
enjoyable time on the gallows, a skinny girl or a heavier, curvaceous
woman?&quot; or &quot;Can a wife use asphyxiation as a way to alleviate her
husband's impotence?&quot; The debaters presented their case and the winners
were decided by a general vote. The punishment for the losers was hanging, and
that was also the reward for the winning side. 

&nbsp;

As time went by, the topics of the debates were becoming
more and more political. This was happening at Isabelle�s instigation. Isabelle
read pamphlets and was full of modern ideas; she participated in each political
debate, and no matter the issue at hand, always delivered an impassioned tirade
against monarchy full of violent threats. After every such diatribe, she would
be &quot;arrested&quot; and mock-tried, the &quot;trials&quot; invariably
ending with her conviction for treason and humiliating hanging.

&nbsp;

After that was over, it was free for all, as the women
waited for their turn on the Bliss Machine. Even though the Society was named
after the Golden Ball the thing itself was not often deployed: it was not easy
to get the Society leaders to allow it, Florence being the most adamant. Yet
there were plenty of volunteers seeking the ultimate excitement, and over time
the golden ball claimed the lives of several members. Some of these were quite
important � a General's wife, a daughter of a foreign Ambassador � but the
Comtesse had connections in places so high that the scandals were suppressed.
The gatherings went on and grew in size, until even six cranes were not enough
to accommodate all who wanted to hang in a single night. A new, bigger Bliss
Machine had been commissioned; it featured long crossbeam with seventeen hooks.
When each of these hooks was occupied by a naked, quivering, pink and purple
body, the scene called to mind the insides of a butcher shop.

&nbsp;

These weekly games continued in their happy innocence, but
then History intervened. The Revolution, which all talked about but no one
truly expected, was suddenly real. The King was overthrown and later beheaded,
and a new, cruel Republic was born. At first, the
regular Society meetings were not much affected, but after a while the members
began to disappear one by one. Without any warning or explanation they simply
stopped coming. In the end only a handful of members would show up for a
meeting, and the club was officially disbanded.

&nbsp;

Two months after that the
Comtesse was arrested. Her connections could not save her now: she was thrown
in jail where she was tortured for two weeks. A Revolutionary tribunal judged
her to the Enemy of the People and sentenced her to death. Next morning the
Comtesse was guillotined on Place de la Concorde. Her headless trunk was thrown
into a ditch together with fifty other corpses of men and women executed that
day. Even then the poor woman's torments did not end: after the fall of
darkness all her clothes were stolen and her still beautiful body unspeakably
violated by a gang of night creeps.

Isabelle welcomed the Revolution with an open heart.
Disguised as a boy, she took part is street battles and often gave fiery
speeches to the crowds, and on one such occasion she was noticed by Marat. She
quickly became his lover, and then the lover of all the important Jacobins, and
although she never sought to promote herself, she was offered a choice of
positions at the service of the Republic. Isabelle refused them all, only
asking permission to perform executions: apparently, it was her dream career
all along. By a sordid stroke of fortune it was Isabelle who was forced to
decapitate the Comtesse. Isabelle hugged her friend and mentor and cried a lot,
but the duty to the Republic was above all personal concerns. After it was over
Isabelle picked up the severed head and, to the consternation of her
assistants, kissed the dead lips.

&nbsp;

Next day, Isabelle resigned her post and demanded to be sent
to the provinces. Her request was granted and she spent the next three months
fighting Vend�e as a common soldier. One moonless night she blundered off the
path, got lost, and was captured by the rebels. To them she looked more like a
frightened young girl than a warrior and they almost let her go, but one of the
rebel commanders, a former Parisian, recognized in her the feared Jacobin
executioner and Marat's lover. Isabelle was beaten severely, raped by dozens of
men, and then, half-dead but still barely conscious, strung up from a nearest
tree. A note was pinned to the pitiful tatters that were the remains of her
clothes; it read, &quot;I hang because I was a Republican whore.&quot;

&nbsp;

Florence had the foresight to flee the country before the
worst of Terror. She spent a year in Austria, then another two years in Poland
and Russia, and ended her travels in Istanbul, where she converted to Islam and
was given a new name, Fatima. She married a rich and important Pasha who loved
her so much that he forgave her lack of virginity. She made their conjugal bed
a very happy place: French woman will always remain French, even when she is a
Mohammedan. 

&nbsp;

Their bliss did not last. One year after the wedding, the
Pasha was accused of a conspiracy to assassinate the Sultan. He and his young
wife were seized and thrown into dungeon. After a quick but painful
interrogation Florence-Fatima was told that she would be executed in the
morning; with tears in her eyes she begged for a civilized manner of death but
all her pleas fell of deaf ears. At the first crack of dawn she was taken to a
closed courtyard. The Sultan and his Viziers were present for the
entertainment, and her husband was forced to watch too, how Fatima was stripped
naked, lifted bodily by two large Janissaries, and slowly impaled on a greased
wooden stake. She lived for hours afterwards and was conscious long enough to
see the Pasha�s other wives share her fate, and then the Pasha himself join
them on his own stake.

&nbsp;

Charlotte was long dead by then. &quot;Bad Luck,&quot; was
the title of the painting that depicted her death, but perhaps bad luck was not
Charlotte�s. Her friends were spared that night only to meet horrible ends
years later; and before they died, they all had time to remember and envy her.
In truth, Charlotte was the luckiest of them all.
