TEMPESTUOUS
TELEMARKETER

&nbsp;Elwyn
sweated as he talked to the prospect on the phone. He could feel Glenda�s eyes
on him. His butt still ached from her earlier interview with him. �Hello? Mr.
Sykes this is� Elwyn Stokes from �Washington Politics magazine. We
noticed you dropped your subscription��

&nbsp;

&nbsp;He looked up at Glenda, who
frowned even more right back at him. Elwyn thought of her nails raking his sensitive spot
beneath his testicles and shivered. �and we want you
to re-subscribe to the magazine at a lower rate. It�s an election year, and we
want you to be constantly aware of the changes�� 

&nbsp;

�Oh, shut up� replied the
prospect. �Your magazine is a piece of shit and I hate telemarketers, and I�m
on the Do Not Call list.� The prospect had hung up, and Glenda was motioning to
Elwyn to come over with her long nail.

&nbsp;

�Let me see your sheet� said the
little blond in the motorcycle jacket.&nbsp; �I�m sorry Glenda, it�s been a bad
day� Elwyn remonstrated, and Glenda snatched the
sales sheet from his hand and reviewed it. �Oh great.�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;She said sarcastically. �Four sales. Thirty-eight rejections and
nineteen answering machines. And what is all this� Glenda pointed a long
crimson nail at a coding. �Oh, that�s for people who told me they can�t
subscribe because they�ve gone blind or died since they were readers�the
magazine is rather old, Glenda, and so are the readers.� Elwyn
hoped she would understand,but
it didn�t look good.

&nbsp;

Elwyn couldn�t imagine what George Glynnis
was thinking letting his teenage daughter run his telemarketing office, but her
parole officer had insisted she find some employment, and it was true that
sales had never been higher. 

&nbsp;

�When the subscriber has died or
gone blind and can�t read the magazine, Glenda, it�s not my fault.� Elwyn said bravely. Elwyn was
sweating. A fat, balding man with a bushy moustache and aviator glasses, he
looked like Teddy Roosevelt after a nervous breakdown.

&nbsp;

Glenda slapped Elwyn across the face. �Moron! You�re a moron!� some of the other callers looked up and
grinned, most quite happy that they were not being skewered by the lovely but
imperious young manageress.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;Since Glenda had taken over
the telemarketing center, she�d done away with all the traditional bonuses, the
dollar bonus per credit card was gone, all the silly games and contests to spur
the callers on. She�d fired all the female callers and any men who seemed
�independent� only keeping those who worshiped her devotedly, of which Elwyn was one.

&nbsp;

Glenda grabbed Elwyn by the ear and dragged him into the office and
slammed the door, removing her leather jacket to show her skin-tight white
t-shirt with sleeves chopped off, and tiny cut-off jeans with nylon stockings
and heels. Glenda�s breasts pulled her shirt above the navel, and her nipples
bore out like bullets. She breathed deeply and Elwyn�s
penis surged against the crotch.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;Glenda reached over and
unzipped Elwyn�s fly and pulled his penis out, and
toyed with it with her firey nails. Glenda motioned
to Elwyn to put his hands behind his back and kept
fondling his penis, watching it grow and swell to purplish proportions in her
tiny fingers.

�It�s not my fault� 

&nbsp;

Glenda mimicked Elwyn softly, as her thumb drew circles on the tip of his
swollen glans. Glenda�s palm pumped Elwyn�s shaft, and a long nail tickled his frenum. �Jeez, nothing is your fault is it?� Glenda used
her other hand to deftly unbuckle Elwyn�s belt, and
she threaded it&nbsp; out of his pant loops. �I can�t
believe you guys.�

&nbsp;

There was a knock on the door,
and Elwyn turned ashamed,but a warning look from Glenda kept his hands locked
behind his back. Elwyn felt completely humiliated.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;�The recession�s the
problem, right? That�s why you can�t get any sales?� Glenda asked as her nails
tickled the sensitive area under Elwyn�s bulging cockhead. �Or the calling list is too old, all the clients
are corpses� Glenda�s soft fingers massaged Elwyn�s
penis to full erection. �It�s all an other excuse.�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;Suddenly Glenda pinched the
tip of Elwyn�s penis painfully �And then the contacts
don�t like the fuckin magaizine.
Or they�� Glenda looped Elwyn�s
belt in her tiny white palm, and motioned Elwyn to
move closer to the desk, positioning his penis right over the mahogany.
&quot;Ma'am please...&quot; Elwyn
muttered.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;�And they can�t afford it
right now� Glenda said even more softly. Elwyn,
knowing the rote, began sweating and whispering �PLEASEDONT DO THIS PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE�

&nbsp;

�Glenda pulled the foreskin gently and raised
her belt. �It�s just a lousy seven dollars and fifty cents a month,you can�t get it out of them
though..pathetic, Elwyn!� Elwyn shook his fat head
sadly WHACK! Glenda�s aim was true. The harsh leather belt slammed Elwyn�s penis against the unforgiving mahogany and as Elwyn�s glans turned bright red
he screamed.

&nbsp;

�WHACK WHACK WHACK Glenda�s arm rose and fell a few more times, and then
she threw down the belt and began slowly massaging the sobbing telemarketers
near limp organ.

Glenda began toying with Elwyn�s wounded penis gently, rubbing the spots that the
belt had so harshly stomped.

&quot;I mean, you don't want me to tell your fiancee, darling Belinda, what a slacker you are, do
you?&quot; asked Glenda patiently. &quot;She's told me several times how pissed
she is with what a crappy provider you are.&quot;

Oh, his beautiful Belinda. It was for his voluptuous fianc�e
that Elwyn was working this second, pathetic evening
phone sales position. His day job at the insurance company could not keep up
with her incessant demands. Belinda was tall, with ash brown hair and
penetrating hazel eyes. 

&nbsp;

Given to wearing miniscule tank tops and miniskirts, it was
easy to get poor Elwyn to empty his 401K and savings
accounts. �You want me to take my panties off, baby? Les� go out and get yer Belinda a nice tennis bracelet at th� Tiffany�s right?�

But lately he�d been unable to supply Belinda�s considerable
demands.

&nbsp;

��Whaddya
mean you can�t pay to re-paint my convertible?� Belinda had hollered the night
before. �My girlfriends are always tellin� me what a
cheapo you are! And Glenda at yer night job says you ain�t even trying to make money there!� Belinda had dragged
Elwyn by the ear into the bedroom, and ordered him to
take off his clothes.

&nbsp;

Elwyn had stripped naked
hurriedly. �C�mere!� Belinda had grabbed Elwyn�s arms and knotted his wrists together with one of
his polka-dotted ties. Then she�d tucked her cashmere sweater in and waved her
full breasts in his face. �You like these, doncha?
You slobber on them enough.� 

&nbsp;

Elwyn had nodded his head. Three
nights before, after he�d given Belinda a new Ipod,
she�d pulled up her sweater boredly and allowed Elwyn to kiss the milky mounds sitting in her bra cups.
�Can�t-can�t you take off your brassiere?� Elwyn had
asked wistfully, and Belinda had snorted. �Look, I don�t have time for all that
crap, lick and drool for five minutes, and then I gotta
go�I got a date�an engagement later.�

&nbsp;

�Elwyn
sure hoped that after they were married, when they were living together, she�d
stop taking off for other �engagements� after their dates were done, but he�d
not been able to say this directly to Belinda. Yes, the other night he�d just
barely been able to kiss the tops of the cleavage, and then she�d hurried
off�and now it looked like she wasn�t even going to take off the sweater at
all!

&nbsp;

Belinda had tucked
her tight cashmere sweater into the belt of her micro mini skirt even further
and breathed heavily, and her swelling chest bounced
with the effort.

Belinda snorted
contemptuously as she spied Elwyn�s cock stiffen
further, as it poked out from between his legs like a pole. 

&nbsp;

�You know, Ellie,
I�ve never let you screw me, in the three years we been engaged, just eat me
out, and occasionally kiss my boobs�it�s even more fun not to let you kiss �em, I taped you the night you cried when I wouldn�t let
you, and I played it for my brother and his friends at Fitzie�s
Pub.� Elwyn�s face had reddened in humiliation. 

&nbsp;

Belinda had then lit
a Lucky Strike and blown the smoke right in the asthmatic Elwyn�s
face, chortling as he coughed and gasped. �I tole youse I din�t put out cause I�m a
virtuous virgin, wanted to wait for the weddin�
night, but that ain�t true, I popped my cherry when I
was ten.�

�

Now Belinda had
pulled her sweater out of her skirt and rolled it slowly until it was just
below her neck and her full breasts, encased in a frilly black bra, were
exposed to Elwyn�s hungry eyes. �Fact is, I let lotsa boys touch me all
over�pork me, corn-hole from the back�but I only let real men do it, men who
matter.�

&nbsp;

Belinda had jiggled
her breasts in Elwyn�s tortured face. Elwyn had felt ridiculous kneeling naked in front of his Belinda,
but his cock had never been harder. 

Belinda reached down and stroked Elwyn's
rock-hard penis gently, her long nails tickling the tip. &quot;You poor baby.
You just can't win, can you?&quot; Elwyn had shaken
his head. Belinda pulled one of her nipples out and waved it at him with her
right hand, still toying with his suffering dick with her left. 

&nbsp;

&quot;You just know you're not man enough to suck
this long, pink, soft sexy nipple, right, Ellie...I call you Ellie for short
because you're like a girlfriend...that's about the level of sexual feeling I
have for you, Elwyn. After all, you let me get away
with stuff no real man ever would.&quot;

This was absolutely
true.

&nbsp;

�Elwyn could not
control Belinda, and she behaved outrageously. When he�d evinced� mild concern once over the massive bills
she�d charge up on his Platinum Visa card at Victoria�s Secret, Belinda had
bashed Elwyn�s skull with a skillet, and when he�d
come to, he was tied up on the back porch without his pants on. She�d tied a
pink ribbon to the end of his prick, and the neighbor girls were laughing at
him over the fence.

&nbsp;

Often Belinda would
make Elwyn take�
her out on the town to various bars and honky-tonks, and have him sit at
one table while she went around flirting with a series of sleazeballs.
Elwyn would weep into his ginger ale as Belinda
danced with a series of truckers, ex-cons and biker types, who�d nuzzle her
massive cleavage while dry-humping her to the drone of �You�ve Lost that Lovin� Feeling.� 

&nbsp;

More than once,
Belinda had sat down with a gang of fellows at a separate table, where they�d
nuzzle and stroke her as he watched depressedly.
She�d always insist that they were �cousins� and that Elwyn
should pay their entire bar bill, which of course meant he could barely pick up
the tab for his lonely ginger ale.

&nbsp;

Although Belinda
always went home with Elwyn at the end of the night,
she never seemed quite as horny when she got there. Sure, she'd neck with Elwyn on the couch for a while, plunging her tongue down
his throat&nbsp; as he touched and fondled her chest beneath the snowy angora
sweater she often wore, but then all of a sudden, she'd turn on him, because
she thought he'd gone too far.

&nbsp;

If Elwyn went too �Far� in Belinda�s opinion, trying to steal
a home run from second base by grabbing her boob through her mesh top, or
squeezing a buttock through her black jeans, Belinda would pull back and jerk Elwyn to his feet. �You goddam
pervert! 

&nbsp;

What about my virtue,
you fuckin� asshole!� Then Belinda would scream,
�Pull your pants down, you worm!� She�d pull Elwyn�s
racquetball racquet from the coffee table and tap her palm menacingly while Elwyn begged her to let him off..for
she didn�t want his pants down for amorous pursuits! �Please please�� but she was implacable, our Belinda!

&nbsp;

Finally, Elwyn would take his pants down. �Undies
too! You want to behave like a child, this is what you get!� Finally, Belinda
would throw Elwyn across her knee, whipping his bare
bottom raw with the racquet until he was hollering and blubbering something
awful.

&nbsp;

�When the poor boy was completely broken,
Belinda would look at him scathingly. �Now you want to try again, to kiss me
like a gentleman?� Belinda would hiss, as Elwyn would
wipe his eyes, and pull up his britches over his still too hard member.

&nbsp;

Then Elwyn would sit gingerly on the couch (oh, it hurt) and
begin kissing Belinda with his mouth closed in a more civilized manner. But
again, she would get so damned exciteable, and Elwyn would feel her long nails surreptitiously stroking
his crotch, stroking her forefinger across his zipper.

&nbsp;

Elwyn knew he should caution Belinda not to
touch him that way, it got him so excited�but he wanted her to! Then of course
he would again plunge his tongue down her throat in the impertinent way he had,
and Belinda would haul off, and whack him, and down came the pants again for
another raquet ball whipping! Sadly, Belinda treated Elwyn worse than any woman he�d ever known!

&nbsp;

Now, Belinda
continued...�But even though you�re a wimp and a pussy, I might let you have
some before the wedding, if you can be a little more generous with your
Belinda�why doncha woik
harder on getting them sales at the telemarketing place? Glenda will keep me up
on your progress�if you don�t get more sales I may have to cut your dick off,
baby.�

Remembering Belinda's threat in Glenda's office now...Elwyn shuddered.

&nbsp;Now Glenda&nbsp; put her
arm around Elwyn�s neck and kissed him on the ear,
still pulling and stroking his penis softly. To Elwyn
she said sweetly, �Babe, I don�t know what gets into you, when you don�t sell
well. I mean, we�re not paying you to hang out, right?�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;Tears coursed down Elwyn�s cheeks as he nodded.&nbsp; Glenda began stroking
harder, and Elwyn�s penis became rock hard. Glenda
encircled his penis with thumb and forefinger and began pulling the skin back and
forth as her breasts grazed his chest.

&nbsp;

Another knock came on the door,
and Glenda called �Come in!� and a huge black man sauntered in, grinning
wildly. 

&nbsp;

�I got twelve sales, Miss
Glenda!� He nodded and smiled at Nadia, who admired the fellow�s pectoral
muscles. Glenda smiled. �Wait, Dunyako, let me finish
with Elwyn first.� 

&nbsp;

She was playing and poking Elwyn�s cock so that he�d now closed his eyes and was in a
trance. Reaching down, Glenda swiftly picked up his belt and raised it over the
erect, purpling penis&nbsp; WHACK WHACK WHACK WHACK Elwyn
screamed and Dunyako laughed. �NOW GET OUT THERE AND
SELL! PUT THAT PATHETIC DICK IN YOUR PANTS AND GET OUT THERE!� Weeping
profusely, Elwyn zipped himself up, and locked his
belt on before rushing out of the office.

�Well, twelve sales, Dunyako.� Glenda smiled and gestured, and the large black
man stripped off his clothes and approached her. Glenda began playing with his
cock and balls,&nbsp; She pumped hard and suddenly loads of cum looped and
squirted out of the black man�s penis. �Sell ten more for me, and I'll make Elwyn suck your balls too, cutie pie!&quot;
