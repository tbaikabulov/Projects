Institute
Kleist

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Madame Greta perused the list of
new admissions. Six this week, an abnormally high number for the time of year,
she thought. Her gaze alighted on number 15; 22 years old, slim, well built but
not bulky, nicely proportioned penis. But it was the handwritten note appended
to his description that interested her. During his examination and appraisal
number 15 had shown quite extreme fetishistic tendencies, displaying a strong
erection throughout. Madame Greta�s staff noted that 15 was
particularly responsive to high heels and leather, as well as illustrations of
male submission.

&nbsp;

As Director of
the Kleist Institute for Male Obedience Training Greta had overall
responsibility for all staff and patients. Her days were generally taken
up with administration and meetings, ensuring that the Institute functioned
smoothly. The day to day work of the Kleist, mainly based on intensive one to
one sessions with patients, was carried out by a large and highly experienced
team of Disciplinary Therapists and nurses. From time to time, however, Greta
liked to work with patients herself. As a highly qualified Therapist Greta
found that there was no better way to keep herself in touch with the work of
the Institute.

&nbsp;

Fortunately the Kleist was a
relatively small operation, giving Greta ample opportunity to practice. Even
when the Institute was full there would be only twenty males undergoing
training at any one time. The average patient would stay for three to four
months, leaving the Institute as a submissive suitable for use as a slave or
servant in a female run household. Most �graduates� of the Kleist found
employment in the home of wealthy ladies, mainly widowed or single, who wished
for male company but entirely on their own terms.

&nbsp;

As for the patients themselves,
they came from all strata of society. Some had fallen
on hard times or were in trouble with the authorities. Others, and Greta was
certain that number 15 fell into this category, were natural submissives
wishing to live the life they dreamed of. A small number were sent by wives or
girlfriends wishing to educate their partners to be more compliant. 

&nbsp;

Set in the middle of a large
agricultural estate and hidden in a dense wood, virtually no one outside a
select circle knew of the Institute�s existence. Staff and patients were
contracted to strict secrecy; the latter�s cooperation being ensured by a
library of compromising video evidence of their training kept in the Kleist�s
extensive vault. Once inside the Kleist a patient effectively ceased to exist.
One great advantage of the Institute�s network of powerful sponsors and friends
was that records could be altered, lost or deemed never to have existed.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Madame Greta informed the staff of
her intention to train 15 personally at that morning�s departmental conference.
Apart from the odd raised eyebrow and a mental note to examine 15�s file more
thoroughly, the announcement provoked little response. Once the meeting had
ended Greta asked Nurse Anna to come to her office. Anna was to assist Greta in
the training.

&nbsp;

Anna arrived promptly and Greta asked
her to study15�s notes. 

&nbsp;

�Unless you have any other
suggestions, Anna, I intend to begin his training with a session with my whip
and boots,� said Greta. �The boy is obviously a confirmed fetishist and I see
no reason not to exploit this. At least we shall see if he is as promising as
his notes suggest.� 

&nbsp;

�Yes Madame,� replied Anna, �he
certainly looks the type to respond well.

&nbsp;

�Very well.
The time is now 10.00 am. Bring him
to Training Room 3 in half an hour. I�d like him clean, naked, collared and
harnessed. Make sure his wrists are cuffed and clipped to his thigh rings. I
shall meet you there.�

&nbsp;

Anna left the room to prepare 15
for his first training session with Madame Greta. Greta herself retired to her
dressing room to change. Greta was a very experienced Discipline Therapist and
knew that the initial impression she made with a new patient was vital. What
happened in the first ten minutes of the first session would often set the
pattern for the weeks and months to follow. She therefore chose her wardrobe
carefully.

&nbsp;

Greta was a mature woman of 46. Her
beautifully styled hair, which she wore quite short, had turned silver grey but
she did not colour it, feeling that her age confirmed rather than diminished
her authority with most submissives. She was of medium height, slim but with a
37 inch bust that, through regular exercise, was still very firm. Greta was,
she admitted herself, not conventionally attractive. Her nose was rather
pointed and her mouth quite large, but she had high, well defined cheekbones
and piercing green eyes that, when in full make up, lent her face a distinct
air of command. Submissives knew immediately they met her that Madame Greta was
not a lady to be trifled with.

&nbsp;

Slipping out of her clinical coat
Greta selected a black leather corset from her wardrobe. The corset emphasized
her large breasts and trim waist. She then selected a pair of fully fashioned
sheer black nylons, attaching them to the corset suspenders. Over these she
decided to wear a pair of high cut black leather panties. Then came the choice of boot. Nothing too obvious she thought.
After a few minutes Greta settled on a pair of plain black leather thigh boots
with a five inch stiletto heel. These were an old favourite, fitted her well
and were still in immaculate condition though almost four years old. To match
her boots Greta chose a pair of soft black leather opera length gloves. And to
wear over her ensemble, for it would not do to expose herself to the patient
too soon, Greta selected a thigh length, long sleeved, black latex housecoat
left open at the front.

&nbsp;

Greta had a large collection of
whips and canes in her dressing room. From the rack she removed a dressage
whip, thirty nine inches long, with an ivory and sliver handle. Greta tried the
whip, swishing it through the air a few times. It made a suitably menacing
sound and felt well balanced in her hand. It wasn�t the most brutal whip she
had in her repertoire by any means but well capable of inflicting the amount of
pain she would need.

&nbsp;

Greta admired herself in the large
mirror on the wall of her dressing room. There was no doubt; she thought to
herself, she still had that indefinable something. They might be younger,
fitter, prettier, but they all lacked her natural elegance and authority.

&nbsp;

After applying one final coat of
deep vermilion lipstick Greta had another look in the mirror. Satisfied, she
removed her leash from the wall, and made her way to Training Room 3.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

*****

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

As she entered the Training Room 15
was waiting patiently with Nurse Anna. As instructed he had been harnessed and
collared, his wrists pinioned to his sides. Anna had ensured 15 was naked and kneeling, head bowed. From his short time at
the Institute he knew sufficient not to move or speak unless given permission
to do so.

&nbsp;

Greta�s stiletto heels clicked
menacingly on the hardwood floor as she entered the room, whip in hand. She
handed her leash to Anna, who quickly clipped it to 15�s collar and held it
awaiting Madame�s instructions. The room was quite small, some fifteen feet by
fifteen and had no windows. Light was provided by a single bulb suspended from
the high ceiling. It had an oak floor and no furniture other than a large, high
backed wicker chair in one corner and a small chest of drawers. Three of the
walls were covered with light grey leather into which were set several eye bolts;
the other was mirror reaching from floor to ceiling.

&nbsp;

�Now 15,� Greta began, �my name is
Madame Greta. You will address me as Madame. I am the Director of the Kleist
Institute and you will have the great privilege of being trained by me
personally. There is only one purpose to your training and that is to teach you
to obey. I shall teach you to obey me. You will learn to obey me instantly and
unquestioningly. Over the coming weeks I will teach you to place obedience at
the centre of your life. When I am in the room you will not think, you will not
speak, you will simply obey.�

&nbsp;

�I have only one method of teaching
obedience 15, and that is through discipline. Everything is very simple, simple
enough for even you to understand. You will notice that I am holding a whip. If
you disobey me I shall whip you. I shall whip you until you learn to obey me. I
hope that is clear. If not you will soon learn.�

&nbsp;

�This morning 15, I am going to
give you your first lesson in obedience by teaching you how to carry out a very
simple but very important task. You will notice that I am wearing a pair of
high heeled boots. Now as befits a lady of my standing my boots are elegant and
nicely polished. However, as any lady will tell you, a pair of boots can never
be clean enough. There is always more that can be done to make them cleaner,
shinier, more beautiful. And that�s where you come in 15. I�m going to teach
you how to clean my boots. Unfortunately we have no polish or brushes in the
room so you will have to use what you have; your lips and your tongue. I�m sure
you understand.�

&nbsp;

Greta moved across to Anna and took
the leash from her. �Come back in�. 50 minutes Anna.� And Anna left the room.

&nbsp;

Greta walked slowly round 15, his
leash in her hand and swishing her whip. Her heels echoed around the room.

&nbsp;

�Kneel up 15 I want to look at
you,� ordered Greta, curtly. 15 lifted himself but
kept his eyes to the floor. Greta placed the tip of her whip under his chin,
raising it. 15 was blond, clean shaven and in good shape. He was lightly tanned
and looked a little younger than 22. It occurred to Greta that he may have lied
about his age, not an uncommon occurrence with applicants to the Kleist.
Although obviously disoriented and frightened 15 had all the signs of the
beginning of an erection, something Greta noticed with great pleasure. And the
file was right, his penis was well formed, circumcised and both longer and
thicker than average.

&nbsp;

�Well 15, I think we should begin,
don�t you? Unfortunately we only have a short time together this morning, so we
shan�t be able to accomplish a great deal. However, training time is precious,
so shouldn�t be wasted. For the purpose of this session you will be allowed to
say two things 15. Those are �Yes Madame� and No Madame�. If you say anything
else I shall whip you, do you understand?�

&nbsp;

�Yes Madame,� came
the somewhat tentative voice at her feet.

&nbsp;

�Good. You learn quickly 15. Very
well boy, you may start to clean my boots.�

&nbsp;

15 hesitated, not sure exactly what
to do. WHIP! WHIP! WHIP! Greta�s
dressage whip struck cruelly on 15�s thigh, leaving three thin, bright red
weals across his skin. 

&nbsp;

�Did I not tell you to start
cleaning my boots boy? Exclaimed Greta angrily. �When I tell you to do
something you will obey without hesitation. Get your nose on the floor boy,
this instant!�

&nbsp;

15 dropped forward on his face,
unable to break his movement with his hands. Greta stood to one side, tapping
his bottom with her whip. �Six strokes for impertinence.�

&nbsp;

WHIP!

WHIP!

WHIP!

WHIP!

WHIP!

WHIP!

&nbsp;

Each stroke of Greta�s whip sliced
through 15�s flesh like a searing hot wire. His bottom quickly became two
crimson globes of pain. He struggled not to make a sound but on the fifth and
sixth strokes was unable to control his muffled shrieks of agony.

&nbsp;

�What�s that 15?! Are you
apologizing to Madame for your insolence, WHIP!
for your disobedience? WHIP! My WHIP! boots WHIP! need WHIP! cleaning!!!!�

&nbsp;

15 thrust his mouth onto Greta�s
boots and began feverishly to lick them. His tongue pressed hard against the
black leather, covering their polished surface with a sheen
of saliva. Greta tugged at his leash and her whip whistled down again. 

&nbsp;

WHIP! 

WHIP! 

WHIP!

&nbsp;

�Madame wants
her boots cleaned not washed, you pathetic creature. WHIP! Lick properly boy! WHIP!
WHIP! Bottom up for Madame. Lick my boots while I
whip you.

&nbsp;

WHIP!

WHIP!

WHIP!

WHIP!

&nbsp;

�A little better
boy, a little more energy. Madame likes her boots to be licked with respect.
WHIP! WHIP! The heel now, lick
Madame�s stiletto heel. WHIP! Get
your tongue WHIP! under
the heel tip boy. Suck the stiletto heel. WHIP!
Take the heel in your mouth. WHIP! WHIP!
WHIP! Deeper boy! Now the sole of Madame�s boot.
Lick harder!! WHIP! WHIP! WHIP! Now
back to the leather boy! WHIP! Too slow. Keep licking while I whip you.�

&nbsp;

WHIP!

WHIP! 

WHIP!

WHIP!

&nbsp;

�Lick harder you miserable boy!�

&nbsp;

WHIP!

WHIP!

&nbsp;

�Kneel up boy!� Greta pulled
roughly on his leash and 15�s neck snapped back violently, almost causing him
to lose balance. His bottom was a quivering red jelly, the flesh criss-crossed
with the lacerations from Greta�s whip. Tears streamed down his reddened face.
However, to Greta�s considerable pleasure, 15�s penis was powerfully erect,
globules of glutinous precum forming on its head.

&nbsp;

�That attempt was, to say the
least, highly unsatisfactory 15. You clearly have a great deal to learn.
Fortunately you have an excellent teacher and we have as much time as we need.
And I will take my time 15. You are going to become very well acquainted with
Madame�s whip and boots.�

&nbsp;

�Look at my boots boy. Would you
call them clean?� 15 looked at Greta�s elegant boots. They were spotless and
gleaming, not a speck of dust or dirt to be seen.

&nbsp;

�No Madame.� 

&nbsp;

�No Madame. Exactly.
After five minutes of licking my boots are still dirty. And that simply is not
good enough. Madame Greta told you to clean her boots properly and you have not
done so. You have been disobedient, and so you need to be disciplined. I�m
going to whip you again and then we shall have another try.� 

&nbsp;

Greta placed her left boot in front
of 15. �Lick my boot while I whip you. Sixteen strokes for disobedience.�

&nbsp;

WHIP!

WHIP!

WHIP!

WHIP! 



15 was
unable to control himself as Greta�s whip bit into his bottom. Each cut was
indescribably painful. He could not help but cry out.

&nbsp;

�Please, please Madame, I will try
to be better. Please stop Madame I beg you.� 15�s voice trailed off into
pathetic silence, punctuated by mewling cries.

&nbsp;

There was a pause. Greta took her
whip and swishes it through the air. �Oh dear. Oh
dear. I had hoped that your disobedience might be confined to your inability to
clean Madame�s boots. But it seems I was mistaken. I distinctly recall
instructing you that the only words to pass your lips this morning would be
�Yes Madame� and �No Madame�. And yet, while I am punishing you, I find you
mumbling something about trying to do better.�

&nbsp;

�I�m afraid it won�t do at all.
Kneel up!� 15 slowly came upright, his body quivering but with his penis still
erect. �I had intended to be lenient with you this morning as it is your first
session. However, your impolite outburst has convinced me that you need to be
disciplined more severely. Madame Greta does not tolerate disobedience. Madame
Greta punishes disobedience. You need to learn from the outset that you are to
obey instructions. Now, Madame Greta is going to punish you by whipping your
penis. Anna, will you come in please.�

&nbsp;

Anna returned to the room and was
instructed to place 15 in a straitjacket and ballgag. Once fitted the jacket
made movement of the boy�s upper body impossible and the gag prevented any
sound. Anna held 15 securely. 

&nbsp;

�Six strokes on the penis for gross
disobedience. Hold him tightly please Anna.�

&nbsp;

WHIP!

&nbsp;

WHIP!

&nbsp;

WHIP!

&nbsp;

�Yes, that�s much better. Taking your punishment without fuss or noise. That�s what
Madame Greta likes to see. And your penis is still nice and hard for the whip.�


&nbsp;

WHIP!

&nbsp;

WHIP!!!

&nbsp;

WHIP!!!

&nbsp;

Six thin lines of red were now
traced across 15�s erect penis. Tiny trickles of blood issued from two of them,
running down onto the dark wood floor. In spite of the punishment it had taken
his penis was as stiff as ever. Greta asked Anna to remove the gag but to keep
15 in his straitjacket. She took the business end of her whip, already covered
in blood from the earlier beating, and touched it to the head of the boy�s
penis, coating it in the sticky fluid that was seeping from it. Greta, smiling,
placed it in 15�s mouth.

&nbsp;

�Clean the whip!� 15 complied,
licking the mixture of his own blood and semen from
the whip.

&nbsp;

Greta jerked 15 back to work. �Boots!�

&nbsp;

15 got to work with a will. His
body was tired, aching and his penis and bottom lacerated from the whip, but
his tongue licked and licked Madame Greta�s boots. The leather uppers and five
inch heels gleamed from his attentions.

&nbsp;

Greta had him lick her boots for the
last twenty minutes of the session, pulling him this way and that with the
leash and every now and again using her whip to keep his tongue working hard.
This one, she thought to herself, showed real promise. Few patients were able
to maintain such a strong erection through a penis whipping. Such
a pleasure to train a true boot fetishist.

&nbsp;

Eventually there was a knock on the
door of the Training Room. Another nurse informed Greta that she was needed in
one of the punishment cells.

&nbsp;

Greta turned to 15. �Tomorrow at ten. I shall continue your training in boot
cleaning. Let us hope I see an improvement. Take him away Anna.� And with that
Madame Greta left the room, whip in hand, her stiletto heels clicking, having
thoroughly enjoyed her time with 15 and looking forward to the next session.
