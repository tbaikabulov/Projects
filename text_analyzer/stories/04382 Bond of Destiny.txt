����������� a(2).� Hikaru (Female)

����������� Female
version of Hikaru has opposite personality then her
twin. She is very calm and shy. Though her power (maybe)
exceed her twin, she rarely use force. Maybe because of that, she is a
submissive type. Even she hates bondage, but when she is in bondage, she enjoys
the condition she is helpless and terrified. Has a phobia of darkness with her,
and opposite to her twin she likes to show the crystal in front of others.

&nbsp;

����������� This
is the ultimate form when Hikaru is in her female
form. When she transformed like this her powers are imbued by the holy
elements. For personality is the same with Hikaru

story too fast)

&nbsp;

����� c. Shinji
-Original-

����� The man with beard and spiky brown hair. He is truly the
perfect guy to protect his friends. His power lies on his strength, so he will
only use knuckles while fighting. He declares himself a demon-hunter, but is
that really like that? Nobody know his motives to
follow Hikaru. Even his foul mouth seemed the same as
the playboy Hikaru, he won't do any sex with anyone if he is not in the mood.
He doesn't enjoy bondage, only pure vanilla will please him.

����� 

NEW�� d. Hysker -Original-

����� The first
demon the heroes encounter. Somehow, he was defeated easily by Hikaru in her Master Form. Seems the

playing. Seemed he is greater than Hysker by that
way.

&nbsp;

the woman the mysterious man played with. She sure likes her bondage, but seems
she was not that helpless in any bondage she endures. Her power is too much for

&nbsp;

PRELUDE

--------------------------------

The fire danced through the burn branches on the
campfire. Three persons sat beside it without noone
talking. From their faces, they seem to be in deep thought. 

&nbsp;

A while later, one of them stood up and walked away
to the upper ground, sitting there. Though in the darkness, he could still see
the vast plains below them. 

&nbsp;

&quot;What is it, Hikaru?&quot;


&nbsp;

Hikaru moves his eyes to
find Hime who was getting near him. She then sat
beside Hikaru.

&nbsp;

&quot;I don't know about this, Hime.&quot;

&nbsp;

Hime gave a deep sigh to Hikaru's saying. Seem she disagreed
his &quot;don't know&quot; thing. She lied to her back, still saying nothing to
Hikaru. Hikaru moved his
head to see her, her mound getting more attractive while she lifted her hands
to her head. 

&nbsp;

&quot;What are you looking at? Pervert!&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;But you like it, huh? Well, my 'other' seems to
like it,&quot; he said smiling.

&nbsp;

&quot;Leaving me behind, eh 'good friend'?&quot; say a
voice from behind.

&nbsp;

&quot;It's not your business, Shinji,&quot; Hikaru replied without seeing him.

&nbsp;

&quot;Now now now, we are already near, what to become eh?&quot; he
continued.

&nbsp;

&quot;Yeah...&quot; Hikaru
gave another sigh.

&nbsp;

He grabed
the crystal from his shirt, looking at it carefully.

&nbsp;

&quot;It began with this crystal huh?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;... that reminds me, Hikaru. What will you become when you finally part with
it?&quot; Hime asked carefully.

&nbsp;

Hikaru locked his mind to
the crystal, then it shimmers with light, engulfing
him. After the light vanished, the boy is no more, there is a girl sitting
replacing Hikaru.

&nbsp;

&quot;I like you better in this form, 'girl,&quot;
said Shinji with a laugh.

&nbsp;

&quot;I don't know... 'we'
haven't talked about this...&quot; the female Hikaru
answered. Her voice is very opposite from her twin. Her voice is so calm and
pretty, not like the voice of the other one which is almost seductive (to girl
only), rude, and strong.

&nbsp;

Then she stood up again, the dawn has come after all.
Hime also woke up, the three of them waiting the
sunrise showing her lights to the entire world.

&nbsp;

&quot;We may not be able to see this scenery
again...&quot; Hikaru whispered.

&nbsp;

Shinji grabed her shoulder,&quot;Don't worry 'girl, we will make it.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I do hope so... for both of 'us'...&quot; she
replied. 

&nbsp;

For her... and her other 'one'.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

CHAPTER 01� BEGINNING

--------------------------------

&nbsp;

One year before...

&nbsp;

The night is long at that time. Or so he thought... Hikaru walked while cursing why he hadn't bought a map of
the region. And so great now he lost in the forest.

&nbsp;

&quot;Shit... is night always this long?&quot;

&nbsp;

He is already tired of walking. Then he rested his
feet, sitting on the big tree behind him. He then remembered the past events...

&nbsp;

After the death of his parents a year ago, he vowed
to himself that he would go away from his home. And so, he trained hard in
swordsmanship alone in the night and working in the daylight to earn some money
for his journey. Sometimes people came and visited the village, and he would
ask them about the world. He was very excited to know the vast world that he
haven't seen and ventured. And so he vowed to be a great adventurer.

&nbsp;

But, he might forget to ask WHAT to do if one is lost
within the forest...

&nbsp;

It's been almost a week after his adventure starts
and he is so excited to see the world outside his village. So many new things
he didn't know before. But for some reason, he surely so feel
lonely at nights.

&nbsp;

&quot;Damn... I don't need those thoughts,&quot; he
angrily tried to forget his thought.

&nbsp;

&quot;Those lucky adventurers said their days are
full of events... why not me?&quot; he once again cursing himself.

&nbsp;

&quot;If only there is....

&nbsp;

HELP! PLLEASEE!

&nbsp;

&quot;Wha...&quot; he
suddenly heard the plea from someone.

&nbsp;

&quot;This voice... a girl?&quot; then he stood up
from his sitting, trying to analyze where the sound came from.

&nbsp;

Hikaru run to the source of
the voice, then the voice becoming more frantic and seemed the girl really got
scared. More Hikaru run nearer, he could hear sobs
coming from the voice. Yet, there were also vivid laugh, from other person.
Seems the girl is being chased by a person.

&nbsp;

After he able to catch up
with the voice, he saw them.

&nbsp;

The girl was lying on the grass, while her captor was
on top of her. She frantically trying to free herself.
The captor seemed overpower her and trying to torn her blouse. When Hikaru saw them, her blouse was torn heavily.

&nbsp;

&quot;Please... help me... don't...&quot; she tried
harder to struggle, her plea seemed woke Hikaru from his daydreaming. Seeing something like this, of
course his manhood got boiled, but then he came to his sense again.

&nbsp;

&quot;Release her at once!&quot; Hikaru
shouted while running toward them. The captor felt annoyed then he swing his leg to Hikaru. Without
able to defend, Hikaru got kicked and fell down. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Being a hero huh? I'll kill you first!&quot;
the captor attacked Hikaru over and over. Hikaru could only defend from the attack even some attacks
hit him. Then a finishing blow got him to the land. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Good bye, 'hero!&quot; The captor took the
knife from his pocket and about to stab Hikaru.

&nbsp;

&quot;Take this!&quot; the girl threw something to Hikaru and he grabed it.

&nbsp;

&quot;A crystal?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Form a sword! Now!&quot;


&nbsp;

&quot;How to...&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Consentrate a sword
and you will have it!&quot;

&nbsp;

A moment after, a sword of light
shimmers on Hikaru's hand. He able to dodge
the attack then slash him away.

&nbsp;

&quot;I'll remember this...&quot; the attacker run away after losing the battle.

&nbsp;

&quot;What's this...&quot; Hikaru about to ask but the girl already fainted. Seemed
she was overly exhausted.

&nbsp;

---------

&nbsp;

Hikaru took some of the
big-sized leaves then cover the girl's upper body. Some of his mind told him to
rape her now that she was asleep. Of course it flashed to mind, when a cute girl in blue hair, having her blouse torn apart lying
unconsiously in front of him. Well, he do caress the
girl's breasts a while, feeling the soft skin after some times haven't seen
girls around.

&nbsp;

But after she about to wake,
he stopped his action then trying to cover her. Waiting until she fully
awakened, he took a glance of the crystal she gave earlier. 

&nbsp;

&quot;A sword... only by consentrating?&quot;
he thought.

&nbsp;

&quot;MMmmm...&quot; seemed
the girl has came around.

&nbsp;

&quot;Good morning, 'girl.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;You are... thank you,&quot; she said after
trying to remember what happened.

&nbsp;

&quot;Anyway, my name is Hikaru.
Who are you?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I am Ami. Mizuno Ami.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;What are you doing here? Oh man I have a bunch
of question...&quot; he sighed again.

&nbsp;

&quot;It seemed you are the right person...&quot; she
whispered.

&nbsp;

&quot;What?&quot; 

&nbsp;

&quot;The cystal responds
to you, right?&quot; 

&nbsp;

&quot;If you talked about the sword earlier,
yes...&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Then, take the crystal,&quot; she told.

&nbsp;

&quot;What? Are you sure?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;From now on, I entrust you with this crystal.
The crystal may gave you difficulties, but you will be
able to overcome it. Hikaru, I came here in search of
person who resonate the crystal. I guess your
kind-hearted responded to the crystal.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Who... are you?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I came from the Moon. There is a secret in this
world yet to be revealed. The whole world's destiny relied on you now. You who
resonating the power of the crystal, are the key to
the secret. Go... go to The End of The World. There you will understand the
secret of the entire world.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I don't understand...&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;My job has finished... now I may have my power
back. Thank you.&quot;

&nbsp;

Ami shimmered in light, then she floated in the
mid-air, while Hikaru confusedly seeing at her.

&nbsp;

&quot;The crytal is a
mystery itself. It may have side-effect for you, but by overcoming it you will
have enough power to do the whole journey. Good bye, Hikaru.
And thank you for everything...&quot; after saying those, she faded into light
then go to the Moon.

&nbsp;

&quot;Is this... dream?&quot;

&nbsp;

He thought again about Ami, then
somehow the crystal shines again. After the glow, Hikaru
confused... he is not anyemore a boy... he is in the
form of a girl...

&nbsp;

&quot;What... am I coming into...&quot; she thought
confusingly.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

CHAPTER 02� PREMONIUM

--------------------------------

&nbsp;

Hikaru felt so differently.
The first thing (now it's she) cannot go yelling around like before. Yes, she
still was the same Hikaru, but she felt her
personality was just too soft, too calm to be Hikaru.
The next thing was how she looks. If the male one was here, he would be happy
to fuck her this instant. Female Hikaru
had a a very cute face, and
with the sailor fuku (uniform) she wore now, she was
surely the replica of Ami before. Not everything though, because her hair was
longer than Ami, even the color seemed the same blue ocean.

&nbsp;

She walked away from the forest, trying to see the
town she will encounter later on. Sometimes she held the crystal, thinking how
will she returned to her former self, but seemed no
avail. After trying so hard, -and she thought she is clever than her other
form- she was able to see the nearby town from distance.

&nbsp;

----------------

Hikaru set her feet at the town, ratherly confused what's
been happening there. There were no people in the entrance gate, so she moved
quietly inside. 

&nbsp;

However, after a while she heard voices from
somewhere. She moved her head to find the source of the voices and able to
locate the commotion near the local tavern. She walked quietly to the tavern
trying to find out what's been happening in the town. But...

&nbsp;

...he..help...
no.. please...

&nbsp;

Even it's so small, she could hear some voices from
the tavern, and so she trying to enter the tavern, opening her path from people
blocking her. If she was in her male form, it won't be hard for her. But now
she was shorter than before, so she got harder to moved
inside.

&nbsp;

Inside she looked a gang of people (maybe bandits she
thought) was raping a red-hair girl. She was shocked and her thought &quot;why
did it happen again soon&quot;? Normally she would burst out and take on the
rapists right away, but now she couldn't.

&nbsp;

She tried to yell at the bandits, but seemed no
voices came from her mouth. Even maybe there was a very slight voice though.

&nbsp;

She could only stand there looking at the helpless
girl frantically struggles. There were about five people doing their way to the
girl. One of them held her right arm, blocking her arm to move, while occupying
himself by fondling her firm breast. SOmetimes he tip her nipples and piched it then sucking on it. Another one
occupying the other breast, playing with her mound with deep laughing.

&nbsp;

Unconsiously, Hikaru touched her own breast, slowly caressing it. It felt
so good, with the view of someone raped in front of her, but another plea from
her woke Hikaru up from her daydreaming.

&nbsp;

&quot;Hey, stop it. Will you only look at them like
that?&quot; Hikaru tried to persuade the other people
there.

&nbsp;

&quot;They are the most fierce
bandit around here. If we disturbed them, they will kill us right away,&quot; thea man fled.

&nbsp;

&quot;Useless...&quot; Hikaru
felt angry but cannot yell.

&nbsp;

&quot;Stop it, already!&quot; she moved forward
nearing the bandits. She felt strange, because she was trembling not like
usually she would move forward with full courage.

&nbsp;

&quot;Oh a new girl again
huh?&quot; Another bandit said laughing hard, He and another one held
the girls' leg, immobilizing her to move her legs. Their
hands turn by turn caressing her pussy. From Hikaru's
view the girl is mor at pain
then feeling the pleasure. Their movements were rough and won't give her
pleasure, only to them. 

&nbsp;

Hikaru tried to talk again,
but her voices cut out... She only could see the girl crying helplessly. Her
clothes were almost torn completely, only some remnants at her leg and her abdoment remains. Hikaru gritted
her teeth, trying harder to yell.

&nbsp;

&quot;STOP IT!&quot; She finally could yell, but then
she panted. 

&nbsp;

&quot;This girl want to join the fun eh?&quot; the
other bandit, maybe the leader said, while holding the girl's head. Sometimes
he licked her face and her neck. Now he moved toward Hikaru.
Hikaru tried to back out, but trembling harder
stopping her movemnets.

&nbsp;

&quot;You want to have fun too huh? Come here!&quot;
he yelled and in seconds held Hikaru's small arm
pulling her toward him.

&nbsp;

&quot;Argh...&quot; Hikaru tried harder to struggle but her trembles causing
her immobilize. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Trembling huh girl? You are tough...&quot; he
whispered to her ear.

&nbsp;

The bandit took the other of Hikaru's
arm then held both her arm in one hand. He was overly bigger than Hikaru. His other hand exploring her
body, starting from her breast. Hikaru felt
shy and her face gone red. The hand grabbing her round mound from her uniform
was sending her to her mind. She panted while surge of feeling came over her.

&nbsp;

&quot;I... don't... wanna....&quot;

&nbsp;

Then the crystal started to glow. Hikaru
opened her eyes, then remember about the crystal. He
became braver then using all her strength, she was able to break free from his
captive.

&nbsp;

She panted, then look at the bandit who angrily
glaring at her.

&nbsp;

&quot;You... little...&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I... must be strong...&quot; she said slowly.

&nbsp;

&quot;Rod!&quot; She said
then a rod of light forming in her hands. she grabbed
it bothhand then focus her eyes to the bandit.

&nbsp;

Slightly trmebling, she bite her lips trying hard to free from her trembling. If she
was a boy, she won'thave these difficulties in
fighting, she thought.

&nbsp;

The bandit stroke Hikaru,
she dodged the attack then counter the attack with her rod. She stroke the bandit with her rod several times until she planted
finishing strike to blow him away.

&nbsp;

&quot;Good... It's better...&quot; she whispered.

&nbsp;

The other four bandits lunged
Hikaru. Hikaru backed off a
little then moved swiftly taking one after another. Even sometimes she got hit
because she haven't mastered her form, she was able to
defeat the four.

&nbsp;

The bandits regrouped with their boss then fled away
from the town.

&nbsp;

Hikaru panted and the rod
of light fading away. The townspeople also run away from the scene, maybe
afraid of Hikaru might scold them by hitting them.

&nbsp;

Hikaru moved to the girl
who still crying on the table, her clothes really torn off almost completely.
The saliva from the guys made her felt dirty. Hikaru
sat beside the table, waiting till her recover from her crying.

&nbsp;

Then the barkeep approach them, Hikaru
stood up again. 

&nbsp;

&quot;No... miss, I want to
apologize,&quot; he said.

&nbsp;

&quot;Why won't you help her?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;We are afraid they might return and destroying
everything...&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;... this girl... is
not one of yours?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes... she just came earlier. By the way, may I
give you place to settle down? You surely looks like
in journey too.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I don't really need it, but this girl needs.
OK, please.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;We are sorry... if just we are as strong as
you...&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;DOn't you see!?? I AM
trembling before!&quot; she yelled in frustation.

&nbsp;

&quot;...&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Anyway, I need some clothes for her too.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;You may have my daughter's pair.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;OK. ... thanks.&quot;

&nbsp;

----------------

After that, Hikaru and the
girl entered the room, after some time she awoke. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Are you all right now?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;...&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I've bathed you. You should be all right and
clean.&quot;

&nbsp;

The girl placed her hand to her breast, then placing
to her lower body. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Thank you... thanks to you they haven't made
further...&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Welcome.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;...&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Anyway, who are you? I'm Hikaru.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I am Asuka... Soryu Asuka Langley.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;What are you doing here? Taking a journey like
that? It's dangerous.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes, I know.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Oh well, things has calmed down a little. Let's
leave together tomorrow.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Okay.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Good night.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Good night.&quot;

&nbsp;

----------------

However, in the deep night.

&nbsp;

&quot;... yea.. this one...&quot;

&nbsp;

'What's this' thought Hikaru.
She somehow heard a faint sound.

She wanted to get up, but seemed she felt so weak,
even she couldn't open her eyes.

&nbsp;

&quot;... you've done
good...&quot;

&nbsp;

'I can't move...' thought Hikaru.
Then, she slumbered again...

&nbsp;

END of CHAPTER 01

&nbsp;

A/N: In this chapter, Hikaru
is a girl. So, what do you think? Her personality is very opposite right?
Firstly, she was afraid in fighting, not like her other one. In my point, I
like her better than her man form. But, they will shift in next chapters all
along until the end of journey.

&nbsp;

Please review this and I'll review yours too. Thank
you in advance.

CHAPTER 03� BOUND
'N HELPLESS

--------------------------------

Finally, Hikaru opened her
eyes. Feeling dizzy after unpleasant slumber, her view was not very good.
However, she guessed positively it was not the room she used to be sleeping in
town.

&nbsp;

When she tried to move her hands, she realized that
she was completely immobilize. After her view getting
better, she tried to see the better view of her. She gasped in terror realizing
what situation she was in.

&nbsp;

picture:
http://fapomatic.com/show.php?loc=16&amp;f=try02.jpg

&nbsp;

Her hands were tied together to the the upper post of the wooden board. Then something struck
her, there were ropes along her body, circling her breasts, her lower body, and
her pussy. Even though her clothes still in one piece (well two pieces if you
see her uniform), she could feel the feeling she felt earlier today when in
captive of the bandit.

&nbsp;

&quot;What... happen to me...&quot; she writhling.

&nbsp;

The room was dark, she could barely see everything.
However, she could see in faint light the room was some kind of dungeon. There
were two cells across her, empty. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Ugh... I couldn't like this...&quot; she
sweated. Though the man form always like to be in charge, seemed she oppositely
enjoyed to be bound and helpless. Of course the former hated it, but even she
still hate being in bondage, she enjoyed the feeling surging over her body.

&nbsp;

She panted, the knots of the
rope sometimes hit her pussy hard, and a jolt coming to her. Even her clothes
was still intact, the ropes were very tight. She could feel the rope
stimulating her, her breast, and her pussy.

&nbsp;

&quot;Where... am I... now...&quot;
she whrites.

&nbsp;

She feel terrified and
alone. Normally people in bondage would feel afraid if there were noone besides. And so does she, she was terriefied
what would happen to her. She was so much vurnarable
as Asuka before now.

&nbsp;

Somehow, she remembered her crystal,
she looked for it on her uniform but couldn't find it. It must be taken by her
captor earlier. She shruged, her only way to save
herself has been cut. She blamed herself to let her guard down earlier. Now she
was completely helpless without no way to escape.

&nbsp;

The door opened, and she gasped when the bandit from
earlier came. It was the same with the one attacked her before. She frantially tried to free herself,
struggling very hard to free like before.

&nbsp;

&quot;No no girl... it
would be impossible,&quot; he said laughing.

&nbsp;

&quot;You... bandit!&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes, I am,&quot; he smiled to the helpless
girl.

&nbsp;

&quot;Where is my crystal?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Oh we took it away, preventing you to use it of
course.&quot;

&nbsp;

The bandit grabbed Hikaru's
breast and squeeze it hard.

&nbsp;

&quot;Agh... Ah...&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;So you really like it huh? This time you won't
get away.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Ah... AAaa...&quot;

&nbsp;

The bandit squeeze both of
the Hikaru's breasts. Hikaru
could do nothing then to squirmed vainly. 

&nbsp;

&quot;No... it...
ah...&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;You are wet already?&quot; the bandit said
after placing his hand to her skirt.

&nbsp;

Hikaru felt ashemed. In fact, she has wet herself when she was first realize her bondage. And now after the bandit did his way to
her freely, she couldn't fight back the stream of pleasure coming to her mind. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Ah... no... I'm... not... that...&quot;

&nbsp;

The bandit withdrew his hand, then Hikaru shocked to see he unsheat
a knife from his pocket.

&nbsp;

&quot;No... what do you
want?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;These uniforms are in the way, right? Let me
help you discharge it,&quot; he said laughing.

&nbsp;

&quot;No... please...&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Hahaha
now you plea to me? It's the first time.&quot;

&nbsp;

Then he sliced her clothes one by one. He sliced her
T-shirt roundly, carefully slice until her breast
showed up.

&nbsp;

&quot;No bra eh naughty girl?&quot;

&nbsp;

Ashemed by that, Hikaru's face got reddened. She was never use a bra,
anyway. She has just transformed from a boy, even she conjused
why her clothes also changed. 

&nbsp;

The bandit stripped away her skirt in a quick motion, Hikaru gasped when looking
the knife nearing her pussy.

&nbsp;

&quot;This will strip your panties. Don't move
please...&quot; he said laughing.

&nbsp;

Hikaru could do nothing, so
she stop struggling so she won't endure pains by the
knife. The bandit cut her panties profesionally and
not a scratch left to her skin.

&nbsp;

&quot;So wet huh?&quot; he laughed then using her
hand taking her dripping juice.

&nbsp;

&quot;Why don't you try a little?&quot; he offered
her juice to her mouth.

&nbsp;

&quot;Ah... ugh...&quot; Hikaru
felt her own juice after the bandit forced it to her mouth. It was sweet and tangie.

&nbsp;

&quot;Ah, about time the boss arrived. She will be
pleased to have this bounty.&quot;

&nbsp;

Then the bandit took more of her juice then enjoyed
it.

&nbsp;

Hikaru felt her orgasm
bulging, but she was very terrified to plea him to continue. She waited in pain
knowing the orgasm would calm down again. 

&nbsp;

The bandit then exited the room, closing it and Hikaru once again left in the darkness.

&nbsp;

-----------------

Moments passed like hours. She was raped against her will, even she thought it was good. He said something about
the boss, so whoever it is will come next. But, she was in fire, the unfinished
orgasm made her tired, but tiredness because of this bondage also unbearable.
She was waiting hoping someone would save her, even
she thought it was impossible. The townspeople won't come and she has no friend
to hope find her here.

&nbsp;

Suddenly, the door opened then the previous bandit
planted a blindfold to her. He also taped her mouth so that she couldn't yell
or scream, but he opened the tape again.

&nbsp;

&quot;It would be good if she screamed,&quot; a voice
said.

&nbsp;

Hikaru couldn't identify
whose voice. It was not the same person who tease her before and discarding her
clothes. But, she felt very helpless. She couldn't do anything anyway.

&nbsp;

Then she felt a hand exploring her breasts, then the
other hand tightening the ropes around her breasts.

&nbsp;

&quot;ARggg..&quot; she panted.

&nbsp;

&quot;Who... are you?&quot;

&nbsp;

Silent, the captor then sucking at
both of her breasts. Then the captor stripped the remnant clothes from
her uniform, making her all the way naked. She was ashemed,
never ever she naked in front of others in this form.

&nbsp;

&quot;I want to ask you question.&quot;

&nbsp;

Hikaru didn't answer. She
was to tired to answer.

&nbsp;

SMACK

&nbsp;

A pain comes to her when a whip smacking her at her
breasts. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Arghh...&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Answer me!&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Wha..
what do you wan..?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Tell me about this crystal, how you could form
weapon at will?&quot;

&nbsp;

Hikaru could feel her
crystal was in front of her, taken by this captor.

&nbsp;

&quot;I will smack you,&quot; the captor said then
leashed another blow.

&nbsp;

&quot;Argg... I... don't
know..&quot;

&nbsp;

The captor placed the hand to her pussy, her juice
dripping freely from her. 

&nbsp;

&quot;You like being bound? You are wetter than
before.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I....&quot;

&nbsp;

The captor leashed several whips again, and Hikaru was writhling. Although it
was painful, she was also got pleasure from that. How is not me, she thought
for herself.

&nbsp;

The captor stopped and Hikaru
panted. Her sweat and her juice flowing drastically. 

&nbsp;

Then the captor put something to her breasts and her
pussy, it was painful like being bitten.

&nbsp;

&quot;Tell me now.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I'm sure I don't know... it's given to
me.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;ARrGGGHHH...&quot;
she screamed hard when a jolt of electricity swarmed her. The pain and pleasure
came together to her mind. Her juice dripped harder.

&nbsp;

&quot;You like that? Such a slut...&quot; 

&nbsp;

&quot;I am not!&quot;

&nbsp;

The captor took her blindfold so Hikaru
could see her captor. It was a woman.

&nbsp;

&quot;I am Quistis. Trepe Quistis. I will return
again to meet you sooner,&quot; she said smiling then withdraw
from her.

&nbsp;

&quot;We will return tomorrow. Now sleep harr harr harr,&quot;
the bandit laughed harder.

&nbsp;

For final moment, the bandit tightened her grip and
the rope. The knots stimulating her more and more. 

&nbsp;

&quot;You won't die just because of this, right brave
girl?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Wait...&quot; Hikaru
was in fire, her orgasm almost came over her.

&nbsp;

&quot;Why you always stop? Why won't you take me
now?&quot; she whispered, even didn't believe her saying.

&nbsp;

&quot;You're at disposal of the boss. She likes you, I'll get another girl at town. I can only do this for
you,&quot; he said while placing the knots deeper to her pussy. By the time,
the stimulation got stronger, then she finally reach
her peak. Her juice spreaded to the floor below then
she fainted, tired.

&nbsp;

&quot;... good night... 'girl...&quot;

&nbsp;

END of CHAPTER 03

&nbsp;

A/N: This chapter is really what my first in mind. At
last I could be able to write it. this part surely
full of sex scene of bondage. Not a continuation of story written here anyway.
Next part the story will progress, next full scene
will take part later okay.

&nbsp;

Please review this and I'll review yours too. Thank
you in advance.

CHAPTER 04� POWER
OF CRYSTAL

--------------------------------

Finally, Hikaru opened her
eyes once again. Yesterday she slumbered unpleasantly within her bondage.
However, though she couldn't remember clearly, she realized she was untied in
middle of her sleep and now she was left inside the jail she had looked
earlier.

&nbsp;

After she was finally awoken, she found a white sheet
beside her and she took it to cover her nakedness as well as warming her in the
cold weather. After a whole day tied in the rope, her
skin gave red marks all over. She hurriedly cover
herself with the sheet to counter the coldness.

&nbsp;

However, not long after, the door opened and a man
stood in front of her cell door.

&nbsp;

&quot;Let's go girl. The boss called upon you,&quot;
he said and two more people came after Hikaru. They
tied her arms together at the back of her, then they cariied
her out from her cell. Hikaru didn't resist because
she knew it would be in vain. She just starting to
wonder what kind of treatment they will do to her.

&nbsp;

They walked a little while then open the door of a
room, inside was dark no lights had been turned on, then they wlaked her to the bed in the middle of the room. Seeing the
bed, Hikaru felt afraid, but she couldn't do
anything. She only saw the bed in front of her that has 4 shackles on the
bedposts. 

&nbsp;

&quot;This will be your place today,
you won't be as weary as yesterday when tied like that.&quot;

&nbsp;

With that, the man threw Hikaru
to the center of the bed, then he untied her arms. He
took her left arm and lifted it to the bedpost, then locking her arm to the
shackles. The other men also took after her other arm then locked it to the
shackles. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Spread, or we'll do
it,&quot; the man said chuckling.

&nbsp;

Hikaru could only do what
told, she spreaded her legs then the men took them to
the bedpost. Finally, they locked her legs to the bedposts, and now she was
spread-eagled on the bed, as helpless as yesterday. Still she didn't feel so vulnareble because they didn't dicard
the white sheet from her body.

&nbsp;

&quot;She is so damn hot. I want to take her,&quot;
one man said while cupping her breast. The sheet was so thin that Hikaru felt the man's hand almost completely.

&nbsp;

&quot;Forget it, or you'll be sorry,&quot; the others
said then they walked away.

&nbsp;

&quot;Why I'm left here... and like these?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;The boss will be here later. We will have you
after she was enough from you. Well, hope you won't be broken easily.&quot; The
men exited the room and left Hikaru alone in the
darkness, spread-eagled to the bed.

&nbsp;

&quot;What would become of me...&quot;
Hikaru sighed. Her body felt so itchy that she
couldn't sleep peacefully. She was also terrified to be left alone in the dark,
let alone in this condition.

&nbsp;

--------------------

Some while after, yet seemed as hours for Hikaru, the door opened again. The boss, Quistis came inside. Hikaru saw
she brought somethin with her and put it on the
table.

&nbsp;

&quot;Let's play again then...&quot; she seductively
whispered.

&nbsp;

&quot;You are insane!&quot; Hikaru
cursed.

&nbsp;

&quot;No need for that... it won't be good for
you,&quot; she replied.

&nbsp;

She walked nearing Hikaru
then lying above her. Her right hand exploring Hikaru's
breast, while the other hand exploring her thigh. Hikaru
squirmed when she felt her hand exploring her.

&nbsp;

&quot;You've already wet? How fast...&quot; she said,
after exploring her pussy below the sheet.

&nbsp;

&quot;Let's take care of this sheet okay?&quot; she
said then she stripped the sheet away from her body slowly. She stripped her
upper body then took care of her lower body. 

&nbsp;

&quot;This is better,&quot; she said while admiring
her work. She stood up to see how the girl finally admitted her defeat. She
didn't struggle like before, only be quiet there waiting for whatever they
would do to her. 

&nbsp;

&quot;If just you could tell me the mechanism of the
crystal...&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I've enoughed. It's
mysterious even to me. You just want excuse to make me in pain right?&quot; 

&nbsp;

&quot;Maybe...&quot; then she played with Hikaru's breast one by one. She writhed, the stream of
pleasure caught her, yet Quistis never gave her
chance to reach her orgasm.

&nbsp;

&quot;Let me cum... please&quot; she said.

&nbsp;

&quot;Okay, with this you will...&quot; she
seductively putting something to her thigh. Hikaru
moved her head to find out what is that. 

&nbsp;

&quot;No... I don't want...&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Too late,&quot; she smiled placing the vibrator
to her wet pussy. The vibrator entered slowly because her pussy hadn't been
invaded before, it was so tight.

&nbsp;

&quot;Ua... a.a aag...&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Let me turn it...&quot; 

&nbsp;

&quot;UUAAAAGGG...&quot; Hikaru
squirmed, vainly struggling to at least making not so painful. But, the
shackles stole away her hope, she couldn't move the object which vibrating
inside her.

&nbsp;

&quot;You love it, right?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Ag...ggaaaa...&quot; Hikaru exploded with her cum. Quistis
turned it off, still planting there. Her juice flowing freely
from her pussy. She grabbed the juice then slurping it clean.

&nbsp;

&quot;I'mm... tired... pl..please.. not..
more...&quot; she panted exhaustedly.

&nbsp;

&quot;I would be glad to...&quot;

&nbsp;

BANG

&nbsp;

Eventually, the door broke then a man could be seen
entering the room.

&nbsp;

&quot;Wow... to think I'm so lucky finding the
girl... like this,&quot; he said.

&nbsp;

Hikaru looked at the man. He
was a bigger guy than her male form and the prominent thing was his beard and
the spiky brown hair. He wore a knuckle on both of his hands. She made sure
never ever see this guy before.

&nbsp;

&quot;who are you? Why are
you here?&quot; Quistis questioned him.

&nbsp;

&quot;Say, I'm some guy who
accidentally enter the town nearby. A girl there asked my assistance to
save her friend here. The townspeople were too chicken to do this, so I came
here. Understand?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Foolish, townspeople won't help you. How could
you enter here?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Looks like this Asuka
able to persuade them. And they are here, fighting all of you. They really want
to put an end to all of you scoundrels.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;What?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;And I thought I'm the one who will find the
girl. Blue hair with sailor uniform... well, even you don't wear sailor uniform
you have blue hair. Are you friend of Asuka?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;... y.. yes... ah...&quot; she barely spoke. She was too tired.

&nbsp;

&quot;That's enough explanation, woman. Now tell me
your 'so-called-Lord' or I'll fight you?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Cross over me first!&quot; she said then grabbing
the whip.

&nbsp;

&quot;It would be more fun if you took part,
girl,&quot; she said smiling.

&nbsp;

&quot;Listen, this girl is so exhausted. I'll turn
the vibrator on, then you must defeat me before she
couldn't take it more, ok?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;...no... I... can't....&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Here goes!&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Agghh.....&quot; Hikaru squirmed hard again when the vibrator turned on
inside her again.

&nbsp;

Quistis attacked the guy
first, only to be parried by him. He moved quietly, studying Quistis' movements. Meanwhile, Hikaru
kept screaming painfully. She must stop the vibrator right away.

&nbsp;

The man advanced forward, he stroke at her only she
dodged away. 

&nbsp;

&quot;You are swift, woman,&quot; he complimented.

&nbsp;

&quot;Take this, big guy!&quot; she stroke her whip again to him. This time he couldn't parry
only blocking with his arm.

&nbsp;

&quot;That's hurt.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;My boys were enjoying it, and so did she,&quot;
she looked the squirmed girl, trying as hard as she could to break free. She
has come to her orgasms some times and it tired her more and more.

&nbsp;

&quot;I can't hold back anymore,&quot; he said then
advancing Quistis again.

&nbsp;

She stroke again her whip, but now he was able to
capture the whip.

&nbsp;

&quot;What?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Argggh!!!&quot;
Hikaru screamed as another orgasm come to her, her
juice spread like fountain.

&nbsp;

&quot;It won't be long!&quot; he said then he drew
the whip, so Quistis also drawn to him. Then he
planted a hit to her, hurling her away to the wall.

&nbsp;

&quot;Ugh.. shit,&quot; her whip has fallen and so she had been
defeated.

&nbsp;

&quot;My Lord will have you,&quot; she hurriedly exit the room.

&nbsp;

&quot;Argghh!&quot;
Hikaru kept screaming hard, even the battle wasn't long, it was very long to her.

&nbsp;

&quot;This will do,&quot; said the man turning off
the vibrator and pulling it from her.

&nbsp;

&quot; *pant *pant&quot; she
panted so exhaustedly.

&nbsp;

&quot;Yo, you are very sexy
girl...&quot; he complimented.

&nbsp;

&quot;Th...thank...&quot; she tried speaking.

&nbsp;

&quot;Let me free you,&quot; then he destroyed the
shackles with his knuckles.

&nbsp;

&quot;I... thought... I... won't... be saved...&quot;
she whispered.

&nbsp;

&quot;Save your thanks to Asuka.
Now, I must take you to her and I'll go to destroy this 'Lord'.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;That...&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;What?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;The crystal on the floor, please bring me that,&quot;
Hikaru pointed the crytal
which seemed fall after her defeat.

&nbsp;

&quot;This,&quot; he gave her.

&nbsp;

&quot;Recover...&quot; she consentrated
at healing ability, and the crystal glowed. She was shimmered with light then
her pain slowly disappeared. Her sore cunt also
seemed has recovered, and so her breasts.

&nbsp;

&quot;That's amazing, girl,&quot; he murmured.

&nbsp;

&quot;Still I'm exhausted. Tee-hee,&quot;
she chuckles. She felt so alive, now that she was free from her bondage. Yeah,
it was exciting but also terrifing. 

&nbsp;

&quot;I'll borrow you my cape then,&quot; he covered
her body with her long black cape, covering her nakedness.

&nbsp;

&quot;Won't you regret not able to see my body?&quot;
she asked playfuly.

&nbsp;

&quot;Maybe... har har,&quot; he laughed.

&nbsp;

&quot;Ok, wait here. The townspeople and Asuka will be here later. I'll go catch that woman and the
'Lord'.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;No, I'll go too. I have score to settle to
her,&quot; she said with determine.

&nbsp;

&quot;Are you sure? You are exhausted right?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Don't worry, as long as I have this crystal,
I'll be okay.&quot; she grabbed the crystal hard.

&nbsp;

&quot;Okay, don't let me down.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;By the way, I am Shinji. Who are you?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I am Hikaru. Pleased to meet you.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Same here.&quot;

&nbsp;

---------------------------

Both of them walked through the bandit's fort to
deeper underground. Sometimes they met the bandit, but Shinji was too much to
take them. They move deeper to the core of the place.

&nbsp;

&quot;Behind this door, I sense great power,&quot; he
said.

&nbsp;

&quot;Strange, it is an evil power... what is this
about?&quot; she asked.

&nbsp;

&quot;Okay, Hikaru. I am a
demon-hunter. Seemed there is a demon here, so I came to investigate. So that's
why I have no objection when asked for help to save you.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I... see.&quot; even though
she was rather confused.

&nbsp;

&quot;Okay, let's go in...&quot;

&nbsp;

Behind the door lies the darkness. Then
the red eyes glowing from inside. Beside it lies Quistis
lying unconsiously naked.

&nbsp;

&quot;You... what have you done?&quot; Hikaru yelled.

&nbsp;

&quot;I don't need her anymore. Now I've met
YOU!&quot; the demon glared.

&nbsp;

&quot;Enough! I'll take you on!&quot; Shinji moved
forward then attacking the demon. The demon faded so Shinji missed, then he got hit by the demon. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Ugh...&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Shinji!&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Strong eh?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I need you... come here...&quot; the demon
moved toward Hikaru.

&nbsp;

&quot;Scram!&quot; Shinji once again attacked the
demon and he hit it hard.

&nbsp;

&quot;Not enough, human!&quot; the demon choked
Shinji then he was lifted upward.

&nbsp;

&quot;Ugghh....&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Shinji!&quot; Hikaru run to them, forming a sword along the way.

&nbsp;

&quot;Useless!&quot; the demon hurled the force
making Hikaru fell down. Her cape was blown also her
crystal. The demon then threw Shinji and moved the hand pointing Hikaru.

&nbsp;

&quot;I... can't move..&quot;
Hikaru's movements was
limited by the force the demon casted to her. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Hikaru....&quot;
Shinji tried to get up.

&nbsp;

&quot;Arrgh...&quot; The
demon lifted Hikaru's limp body with his hand.

&nbsp;

&quot;This girl is surely tasty,&quot; the demon
hissed while observing Hikaru's naked body. Then he
grabbed her breast, playing with it again.

&nbsp;

&quot;Uhhh....&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Hikaru...&quot;
Shinji's energy was nearly drawn out. Then he saw the crystal which has fallen
near her.

&nbsp;

&quot;We'll play first just like that woman
before,&quot; the demon hissed, his free hand exploring her body then thrusting
his finger to Hikaru's clit.

&nbsp;

&quot;Agghhh....&quot; Hikaru was not able to move even an inch. She felt so
heavy.

&nbsp;

&quot;Take this, Hikaru!&quot;
Shinji yelled then he threw the crystal to Hikaru.

&nbsp;

Hikaru used all of her
remaining energy and succesfully grab the crystal.
Somehow, the crystal glowed hard. The shines even drove away the demon from her
body.

&nbsp;

&quot;What...&quot;

&nbsp;

Then, she was floating in the midair. Her whole body
was shimmering with light from the crystal. More the shines
harder, until Hikaru got engulfed by the light.


&nbsp;

After some time, Shinji opened his eyes, beyond him
there was no more the naked girl, but he saw Hikaru
with white clothes shining brightly. A set of wings flapping
behind her. He couldn't believe his eyes. Hikaru
has transformed. 

&nbsp;

&quot;... holy... light....&quot;

&nbsp;

END of CHAPTER 04

&nbsp;

CHAPTER 05� STAR
IN MY HEART (part 1)

--------------------------------

&nbsp;

&quot;holy... light...&quot;

&nbsp;

Hikaru had transformed from
her former self, becoming a somewhat like an angel in white. All her attires
shined brightly, and her hair formed longer than before. She definitely not the
same Hikaru used to be.

&nbsp;

&quot;Die, woman!&quot; the demon
shriek.

&nbsp;

The demon formed a dark ball of lightning then threw
it onto Hikaru. Hikaru
lifted her right arm then the ball dispersed before it was able to attack her.

&nbsp;

&quot;Demon... must be purified...&quot; she
whispered, but her voice could be heard completely across the room.

&nbsp;

She flapped her wings then lunged at the demon, the
demon tried to attack her but she dodged away with swift movements. She planted
some hit to the demon's head, abdomen and his chest then she withdrew.

&nbsp;

&quot;By the power of holyness...
SEAL!&quot; she spreaded her
arms above her head then shrieks of pain of the demon heard. A massive bright
of light came from his head, chest, and his abdomen. The light shined brighter,
and Hikaru crossed her arms forming the glowing light
targetting the demon.

&nbsp;

&quot;PURIFY!&quot; She exclamated
then a beam of light materialized from her hands destroying the demon,
dispersing him completely to the air.

&nbsp;

&quot;... the deos... shall
... victorious...&quot; his voices then dispersed along with his body.

&nbsp;

Hikaru was once again
engulfed with the bright light. However, after the glow disappeared, there was
no longer a girl with angel look or rather an innocent girl Hikaru
used to be, but only a boy...

&nbsp;

----------------

Meanwhile, somewhere within the dark chamber...

&nbsp;

&quot;uh... agh...&quot; someone's pants heard along the chamber.

&nbsp;

&quot;Do me... now...&quot; called a seductive voice.

&nbsp;

&quot;Will be... soon...&quot; a heavy sound replied
the voice, then more pants heard.

&nbsp;

Within the darkness, a faint light showed the scene.
A very beautiful woman was bound heavily by iron chains. Her arms were lifted
above her head and chained to the opposite sides. Her legs were chained onto
the spreader bar, spreading her legs wide, showing her inviting cunt. 

&nbsp;

She was stood there in bound, as vulnareble
to any her assailant want her to be. Her long hair fell to her back, and her
breasts swaying left and right, the nipples were clamped by some nipple clamps.
Her pussy was dripping for her love juice to the floor.

&nbsp;

In the darkness, a form of a man moved his hand to
her navel, then trailed to her inviting pussy. He
inserted the fingers to her clitoris, exploring the depth of her.

&nbsp;

&quot;Damn woman... you're so wet... his heavy voice
emerged.

&nbsp;

&quot;Then.. do me...&quot; she hissed painfully.

&nbsp;

&quot;Okay... sweetie...&quot; 

&nbsp;

However, a knock came from the door, and the man
glared to the door.

&nbsp;

&quot;What's up? Why did you disturb us?&quot; he
shouted.

&nbsp;

&quot;My deep apology, my Lord.
But Lord Hysker has been destroyed a while
ago...&quot; the sound replied him.

&nbsp;

&quot;Ok... sweetheart, let's continue later...
then,&quot; the woman whispered.

&nbsp;

&quot;Damn... all right, give me the full
report!&quot; 

&nbsp;

&quot;Go now, I still longing to this... play,&quot;
she whispered seductively.

&nbsp;

&quot;Okay, just be sure to unclamp your nipples when
it got sore,&quot; he said then moved away from her.

&nbsp;

He opened the door then closed again. Within the dark
chamber lied the woman alone chained tightly in her bondage. But, she was not
looked scared, rather she smiled seemed she really liked her situation like
that. Somehow, she declared her deep laugh, which echoing the chamber.

&nbsp;

And then, the nipple clamps fell down immediately...

&nbsp;

--------------

&quot;Woah... what just
happened? I don't get it!&quot; Shinji asked Hikaru.
He was confused, there wasn't the girl Hikaru used to
be, but before him only lied a boy sitting to the
floor.

&nbsp;

Hikaru stood up and
reorganizing his jacket. &quot;Ah... fell good to return to this state...&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;It's because of this crystal. This damn... oh
well somehow I like it, crystal has such a mysterious power... Seemed I've
transformed in three different forms till now...&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;So... you are a boy or girl?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I AM a man! This crystal formed me!&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I like the girl's attitude better...&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;So hell with it...&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Anyway, let's go out. I'm sick of this
place.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Hei, you are going
like that? What could Asuka think?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;... okay. I'll do
farewell to her then return as me again,&quot; he said then he was glowing,
reverting him to a girl. The naked girl she used to be before.

&nbsp;

&quot;I... am.. too tired.. in this...&quot; she
panted.

&nbsp;

Shinji covered her with his cape, then
he took the unconsious Quistis,&quot;Let's
back then.&quot;

&nbsp;

------------------

After they got out from the place, they reunited with
the townspeople. The bandits were all captured and brought to the town. Asuka was overjoy
to see Hikaru back safely. Then they return to the
town.

&nbsp;

------------------

&quot;I'm glad you are okay,&quot; Asuka said.

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes...&quot; Hikaru
answered.

&nbsp;

They were sitting beside a pond. Asuka
had offered her a new set of suit, then she wore it,
using the crystal's power to revert it to her sailor uniform. She told her she
was more comfortable with her sailor suit. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Hikaru... I'm sorry.
You must have a rough time...&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Well, it may. But, it's over already. And now
the town is free from bandit, right?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes... anyway, what do you think of
Shinji?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;He is a fine man to befriend with. He said to
me earlier he will be going with me in my journey.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Somehow, I thought I've heard his name
before... deep within mine.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;From your past?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes... seems I've ever like this so-called-baka-Shinji... well it definitely not him.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Remnants from your past
huh?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I've forgotten my past, my last memory was
until I awoken earlier. I don't remember anything.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Hm...&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Anyway, it will be great if we could find our
own Star in our heart... I think.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Maybe... yes.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I wonder,... maybe if
you are a man, you wil become the star in my heart, Hikaru.&quot;

&nbsp;

--------------------

&quot;So, what's your answer?&quot; Shinji asked me. 

&nbsp;

We have gone from the town yesterday, Hikaru thought. He was once again in his boy form. He told
him he must revert from the girl form a while because she was depleting her
energy too much in her captive.

&nbsp;

They were at their journey. Shinji followed Hikaru,
he said it would be the same road for them anyway. They were going to the next
town, Ikarus the biiger
town then before. Maybe he would get more information about The End of The
World he was about to go to.

&nbsp;

&quot;Well... We are friends, and I don't want more
than that.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;She is cute, and you don't wanna?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Snap out of it, big guy. I'm in journey.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I've said... I like the girl's attitude
better.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Suit yourself...&quot;

&nbsp;

More in they journey would they
encounter far greater events. More powerful enemies will be run onto, but that
will leave next time. 

&nbsp;

END of CHAPTER 05

&nbsp;

A/N: This concludes Asuka-Quistis
story. Asuka in this story is Asuka
after her death, then somehow rebirth in this world. Well, next time it will be
the time the star in Hikaru's heart
appear.

CHAPTER 06� STAR
IN MY HEART (part 2)

--------------------------------

&nbsp;

&quot;Why the hell you become a demon hunter,
Shinji?&quot; Hikaru asked when they rested for a while.

&nbsp;

&quot;Hahaha, that's none
of your concern. Anyway, I just want a reason for taking a journey,&quot; he
replied with laughter.

&nbsp;

&quot;Reason?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;This world is vast, Hikaru.
I want to see them with my own eyes, every bit of its wonder.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Nonesense...&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Honestly though, you are no different, what
with searching The End of The World.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Sometimes I thought as much...&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Well, tomorrow we'll reach Ikarus.
Even I don't think we'll find some information about your place.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;We'll see.. good night.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Yeah.. yeah...&quot;

&nbsp;

----------------------

Meanwhile, in the dark chamber...

&nbsp;

A man sat on the dark-glowing chair. Somehow, the
door opened and the previous woman entering the wide room. Seemed it was the
audition chamber.

&nbsp;

The woman was tied in shibari
ropeart, naked without anything but rope crossing
over her body. However, there was no restrain to her movements, the rope only
making her more sexy.

&nbsp;

&quot;So, what's the word?&quot; she approached the
man.

&nbsp;

&quot;Seemed Hysker
got defeated by a human with undescribeable power.
There was no demon's presence left in Hysker's
chamber. He must have been eliminated completely.&quot;

&nbsp;

She trailed her hand at the man's face, then she kissed him, taking one of his hand exploring her
tightly tied breast, prominently jutting inviting.

&nbsp;

&quot;So... what will gonna
do?&quot;

&nbsp;

The man squeezing the woman's
breast, her pants echoing within the chamber. 

&nbsp;

&quot;I'll send Lysker. And
you may meet them as well. Just... don't disturb them.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Tee-hee...
that's good, sweetheart.&quot;

&nbsp;

----------------

Hikaru and Shinji was walking toward the town. About a hundred metres more and they saw a gate of the town in front of
them.

&nbsp;

However, when they got near the gate...

&nbsp;

&quot;Halt!&quot; An arrow hindered Hikaru's way ahead. Then he trailed his eyes searching for
the attacker. But, he was lost in thought when he found the attacker.

&nbsp;

In front of them above the gate, a very pretty girl
stood up with a crossbow at her hand.

&nbsp;

&quot;Who are you two?&quot; she exclamated.

&nbsp;

&quot;Hey, 'girl. We are not
some monsters or else ya see?&quot; Shinji replied
her.

&nbsp;

&quot;I thought so, I'm sorry,&quot; she appologized then she leap to the ground, standing before Hikaru. Hikaru was still standing
there like a stone pillar.

&nbsp;

&quot;I'm sorry for that. We are in fighting with
some demons, so I thought you were...&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;That was okay. Anyway, I'm Shinji. What's your
name, 'girl?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;My name is Hime.
Pleased to meet er...&quot;

&nbsp;

picture:
http://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j266/YamiNoHikari/Bond%20of%20Destiny/Hime.jpg

&nbsp;

&quot;Hikaru, snap
out!&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;er..
ah.. I am Hikaru. Pleased to
meet you,&quot; he said. He could feel his face got redden.

&nbsp;

&quot;Pleased to meet both of you
too. Okay, let's get inside the town.&quot;

&nbsp;

----------------

Three of them entered the town of Ikarus. Hime
showed them the inn, then she left. Before Hikaru could say more, she was already away from him.

&nbsp;

&quot;Hey, 'boy. I thought
you ARE a playboy. I can't believe...&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Shut it... Damn... what's gotten into me...&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Anyway, let's enter.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Okay...&quot;

&nbsp;

Shinji moved entering the inn and reserved a room for
them. Hikaru was still lost in his deep thought. He
couldn't sway the image of Hime from his thought. How
her beautiful face, her short hair with white headband, everything about her is
perfect. 

&nbsp;

Somehow, he remembered Asuka's
saying,&quot; It would be great if we find the star in our heart...&quot;

&nbsp;

----------------

After resting a while, Hikaru
and Shinji went to the tavern, searching the information about the demons and
The End of The World. The barkeep told them sometimes the demons came to the
town, but before they could enter they got destroyed by Hime.

&nbsp;

Hikaru used this
opportunity to ask about Hime's whereabout.
The barkeep told them if they search for her, she may be found near small river outside the west gate. Shinji said he would
rather back to the inn while Hikaru searched for Hime with wink of his eyes. And so, Hikaru
went to the west gate to find Hime.

&nbsp;

----------------

Between the sparkling water crossing the land, Hime sat peacefully. After a while, Hikaru
could spot his star in the heart. He was looking at her, his face bacame red.

&nbsp;

&quot;Hikaru?&quot; she
said after spotting Hikaru looking at her.

&nbsp;

&quot;Er... yeah...&quot;
he mumbled, then moved nearing at Hime.

&nbsp;

&quot;May I... sit here?&quot; he politely asked her.

&nbsp;

&quot;Yeah, sure...&quot;

&nbsp;

He sat beside her. He was keeping himself occupied.
His reputation as so-called-playboy is at stake. He used to take it easy when
talking to girls before, but now he couldn't say anything to the girl beside
her.

&nbsp;

&quot;Is anything wrong? You sure look
troubled,&quot; her pretty voice taking Hikaru back
to reality.

&nbsp;

&quot;No... not really...
don't mention it.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Ei, Hikaru. Why are you traveling?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Huh? Oh well...&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I always hope someday I will be able to travel,
because I want to see the beauty of this world. But I have not enough
courage...&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Is that so?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;How 'bout you?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I'm going to The End of The World. I must do
something there, or so I thought.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;The End of The
World?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes... have you ever heard of it?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Little... some said it is the place next to
Eden, the Paradise of Sinner.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Eden?
Paradise of
Sinner?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Well, I don't really know myself. It's only a
rumor after all.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Hime...&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Hikaru, is it
exciting to travel?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Sort of... there are so much
of trouble too.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;But it must be far more interesting than stay
here...&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Then...&quot; he hesitated for a moment,&quot;
why don't travel with me?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Eh...&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Er... I...&quot;

&nbsp;

Somehow they came to silence. Hikaru
swayed his head away from Hime, unable to see her
face. He could feel his head burned and so red. 

&nbsp;

Then, he stood up immediately, realizing a powerfull force appeared from nowhere. 

&nbsp;

&quot;So, the hero really could feel my
presence...&quot; said a voice, then from the trees in
front of them a man appeared.

&nbsp;

The man has golden hair cut short,
he was tall and so calm. However, Hikaru could sense
the terrible demon power emanating from him.

&nbsp;

&quot;Let me introduce myself. I am Lysker, one of the -deos-. I'm
searching the hero who has defeated my fellow Hysker.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;So, you are friend with that demon?&quot; Hikaru shouted.

&nbsp;

&quot;I feel the same force as yours in Hysker's chamber. So it was you after all.&quot; he
chuckled.

&nbsp;

Then, in a glimpse of eyes, Lysker
moved toward them, and he was an inch in front of Hikaru.

&nbsp;

&quot;What...&quot;

&nbsp;

Lysker pushed his palm to Hikaru's chest and his hand shined, lunging Hikaru away.

&nbsp;

&quot;Hikaru!&quot;
Hime ran toward him, but Lysker
grabbed her hand.

&nbsp;

&quot;Don't you dare touch Hime!! SWORD!&quot; he concentrated his mind and after the glow
of the crystal, a sword of light materialized on his hand.

&nbsp;

Hikaru swung the sword
several times, but Lysker was too fast. He kept
dodging every attack Hikaru gave with all his might. 

&nbsp;

&quot;So weak... I can't believe Hysker
got defeated by this fool,&quot; he shouted, then he
moved so fast to strike Hikaru hard. Hikaru got hit without any moment to defend, and fell down,
his consciousness almost fading.

&nbsp;

&quot;... dam.n.. don't you... touch Hime....&quot; he insisted.

&nbsp;

Lysker stroke Hime and she fell unconsious. He
took her at his back and flating in midair.

&nbsp;

&quot;I'll take her for a play. If you want her back,
try find me... and defeat me, hero...&quot; he laughed hard. Hikaru couldn't get up. His conscious was fading.

&nbsp;

The demon fled with laughter. At the nearby tree, a
woman was standing. A wicked smile formed in her face...

&nbsp;

CHAPTER 07� IN
SEARCH OF THE STAR

--------------------------------

&nbsp;

&quot;Are you okay? How's your feeling?&quot; Shinji
asked Hikaru. Slowly he recovered, he saw his surroundings. He was in the inn, lying on the bed. 

&nbsp;

&quot;You've injured severly...&quot;
he continued.

&nbsp;

Hikaru looked at himself.
He got several wounds and had been covered by bandages. Somehow he recalled to
the past event.

&nbsp;

&quot;Hime!&quot; he jumped
from bed.

&nbsp;

&quot;What's with you?&quot; Shinji
clamed him.

&nbsp;

&quot;I've got no time. Hime
is in danger!&quot; he yelled.

&nbsp;

&quot;... okay, let's find some info. Think
carefully, though. You won't find anythin in
panic.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;... all right.&quot;

&nbsp;

------------------

Meanwhile, Hime opened her
eyes slowly. She felt very weak because of the hit before. Her
eyes scanning her surroundings.

&nbsp;

She was in a wide chamber, surrounding by darkness.
Some old and broken furnitures
were scattered on the side. Seemed the place had been deserted for a long time.
She slowly stood up, trying to find something usefull.

&nbsp;

&quot;So, the princess has awoken...&quot; a voice
from her back through her.

&nbsp;

She reversed to see the one behind her. The man with
golden hair was looking at her, and she backed a little. He didn't do anything,
just stood there looking at her calmly.

&nbsp;

&quot;What are you doing?&quot; 

&nbsp;

&quot;Patience, princess. I
don't do anything... yet...&quot; he replied with cold voice.

&nbsp;

&quot;Let me go from here!&quot; she shouted at him.

&nbsp;

He smiled, then he threw her
crossbow and some arrows to her. She received her belongings then she readied
her crossbow pointing at him.

&nbsp;

&quot;Hit me and I'll free you. Otherwise, I'll do
something I like with you...&quot; he smiled.

&nbsp;

&quot;You... monster!&quot; she shouted then she
detached the first arrow at him. 

&nbsp;

He moved just a milisecond
before the arrow hit him, then he lunged at her very fast, stripping some of
her shirt with him.

&nbsp;

&quot;You...&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;It's decided then. Hit me, and you're free.
Otherwise, I'll strip you. Hahahaha....&quot;

&nbsp;

------------------

Hikaru and Shinji hit the
bar in their searching for clues. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Is there any place they will take her into you
know?&quot; Hikaru asked without patience.

&nbsp;

&quot;I don't know, I can't think a place,&quot; the
barkeep answered.

&nbsp;

&quot;I must find her. She is in danger!&quot; he
shouted.

&nbsp;

&quot;Cool down, Hikaru. We
are trying,&quot; Shinji calmed him.

&nbsp;

&quot;I... can't. I just cannot.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;So, Sir. Don't you
know something... even a little do fine,&quot; Shinji asked again.

&nbsp;

&quot;I... don't know. Really...&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;How in the world...&quot;

&nbsp;

Behind them, a woman seeping
through her drink. She smiled faintly.

&nbsp;

------------------

Another arrow shot, but Lysker
is too fast. He lunged at her, grabbing almost her top completely. Her bra showing
from within, and she clutched her shirt.

&nbsp;

&quot;Pervert demon!&quot; 

&nbsp;

&quot;come on... it's just a
play...&quot; he hissed.

&nbsp;

Hime attached another arrow
to her crossbow, then she ducked. She waited and
carefully planned her next move.

&nbsp;

------------------

&quot;Do you search for a girl?&quot; the woman moved
toward Shinji and Hikaru.

&nbsp;

&quot;What? You know?&quot; Hikaru exclamated.

&nbsp;

&quot;Maybe... I've seen something fly through the
sky before with a girl or so...&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Where is it? Tell us, please,&quot; Hikaru asked patiencelessly.

&nbsp;

&quot;Okay, follow me. I'll take you,&quot; she said
then she moved away.

&nbsp;

Hikaru immediately followed
her, but Shinji held his shoulder,&quot;She is...
weird. Don't you think it's a trap?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I don't care. That's the only clue!&quot; he
threw Shinji's hand, then quickly follow her. Shinji
said good bye to the barkeep then he also followed Hikaru.

&nbsp;

------------------

&quot;Take this!&quot; Hime
shouted, but Lysker grabbed the arrow then stroke at
her, discarding her skirt away. Now her panties also show up.

&nbsp;

&quot;You're running of clothes you know...&quot; he
hissed.

&nbsp;

She once again readied to detached
another arrow, then released it. But before she released it away, she changed
the direction. Lysker was a little surprised of her skillfullness. But he was also changing his facing then
dodging the arrow. He lunged at her and grabbing her bra with her.

&nbsp;

Hime shutted
her revealing mounds from his gaze. Her face got redden
because of her ashemed. She readied last arrows to
the crossbow. Anyway, her only cloth was her panties...

&nbsp;

------------------

&quot;Before we go on, I must test you. Why do you
want to find her?&quot; the woman asked Hikaru in
their middle journey.

&nbsp;

&quot;She... she is special to me. I...&quot; he
stopped.

&nbsp;

&quot;You've just barely met right? Why do you want
to risk your life?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I... she... Just because she is special to
me!&quot; he replied.

&nbsp;

&quot;For that? What if she
rejects you? Your struggle would be in vain,&quot; she smiled.

&nbsp;

&quot;....&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;You've known already. Enemy you will find is
not an easy one. You still wanna continue?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;... yes.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I don't care what she thinks of me. She is the
star of my heart, and that's enough!&quot; he clutched his hands, he has
determined his decision.

&nbsp;

&quot;Okay... then I'll show you... the path given to
you.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Wait for me, Hime.
Please...&quot;

&nbsp;

----------------

She released the arrow after she ran to his side.
But, he was too powerfull to be taken by that only.
He smiled then he moved facing Hime. Just as he baout to lunge at her, she shot another arrow to him. 

&nbsp;

The arrow this time almost hit him, at the final
moment he swayed an inch from the arrow. He grabbed her panties this time,
discarding all her clothes completely.

&nbsp;

&quot;The game is over!&quot; he laughted
then he lunged at Hime, this time he charged her,
fell to the floor. He put his hands at her arms, lifting them above her head.

&nbsp;

His legs held Hime's legs
tightly. She was unable to move anymore, Lysker was
at top of her. She glared at him in fear. There she was now, unable to resist
even to move, naked completely with Lysker held her
on top.

&nbsp;

&quot;Hahahaha, I've got
you now, princess!&quot; he laughted, echoing across
the whole chamber.

&nbsp;

&quot;Hikaru... help
me...&quot; her last words faded, and he got unconsious,
her tears forming thorugh her pretty eyes.

&nbsp;
