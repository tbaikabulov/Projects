Synopsis:    Tracey story, she is sent to an African country where slavery has been legalised to write a story for her newspaper.






Tracey looked out of the air plane window and wondered what awaited her on the ground below.

They were approaching the imaginatively named Zonga International Airport, in the capital city of Zonga in the country of Zonga. Why choose different names when one will do thought Tracey wryly.

Not that many people had heard of Zonga up until two years ago, with good reason, it was a backward little country on the eastern side of Africa with one capital city which was also it's only port, and not much else. Chief legal export was bananas and chief illegal export was cocaine, with not much distinction between the two being made by the country's rulers and police force.

The country was a dry hell hole according to some of the more unrestrained guide books and probably would of stayed totally unremarkable if it wasn't for the fact that two years earlier they had passed a new female slavery law. The law stated that any female in the country could legally be classed as a slave, complete with a legal owner who could do with her as he pleased.

Once she was officially classed as a slave she lost all of her human status and rights and could be bought and sold and trader by whoever owned her. Her owner was then permitted to use her literally as a slave, working the land almost as an animal, working as a house slave or as a sex slave. There simply were no restrictions on what you could do with your slave, after all she was a slave!

Now although this was a slip back in the race for modernity for most African countries it barely registered on the international news desks. For a start Zonga was not a tourist hot spot, the number of white women visiting the country was very low and they nearly all tended to be professional women with males accompanying them so the chances of an opportunistic new slave trader acquiring nubile white slave girls was few and far between!

There was also the fact that to a large degree the native female population was almost living under slavery in the first place. The women's role in life was very much too serve their menfolk and women certainly had no place in politics or any form of authority. The typical Zongan women was very downtrodden and only one place above a slave anyway and so the new slavery law had little or no impact for the first few months after it was made law.

That all changed though a few months later, and all down to a drunk coach driver! A French female volleyball team had agreed to play a series of matches against African teams and the last match of the tour was against the Zonga national team. The French had won the match earlier and unknown to them their Zongan coach driver had been enjoying the local alcoholic beverages during the match and once all the girls had climbed aboard the coach after the game they quickly became aware that driver was drunk from the alarming way the coach was swerving all over the road!

Unfortunately the coach had knocked an old woman from her bicycle and although she wasn't badly injured the police were called and turned up in number with the upshot being all ten French girls were arrested and thrown into the local police cells for the night while the coach driver was allowed to go with no charges, where's the justice in that eh?

The next morning the police chief had suddenly come to the realisation that his country had made the buying and selling of slave girls legal and he coincidentally had his cells full of prime French pussy! With no hanging around he declared that as punishment for allowing themselves to be driven by a drunk driver the girls would be declared as slaves and put up for auction the same day with some of the proceeds going to the old woman as compensation.

Everybody was happy, the policy chief and the old woman would make some money out of it and the local men would get the chance to see ten lovely white European girls being auctioned, and even better, the rumour going round was that the girls would be auctioned naked! Of course the French girls were not so happy but the law was the law, after all they were in Zonga and Zonga legally allowed slavery so no problem!

So at two pm that afternoon all ten girls were led naked and shackled and ashamed to a make shift stage in the baking hot afternoon sun in the town square surrounded by practically the entire male population of the town. The girls were scared half to death, most had no idea of what was going on, the Zongan's did not speak French and the girls certainly did not speak Zongan and all the could understand was the embarrassment of being naked in front of all the laughing and leering men.

Now most of the Zongan population is very poor and the police chief was quick to realise that he was not going to make a fortune selling the girls but he managed to raise the price to the equivalent of $20 US dollars for each of the first five girls. That appeared to be where most of the men's money started to run dry though and the last two girls were sold for $2 each! The paperwork was all done, the girls were given to their new owners to start their new lives of slavery and the police chief gave the old woman $10 and as I said, everyone was happy. Well maybe the French girls were not happy but they were now legally slaves, who listened to them any more, they would have to do as their masters told them from now on or face the consequences, they certainly would not be playing any more volleyball!

The selling of the ten girls did reach the international news desks, mainly due to the fact that someone in the crowd had filmed part of the auction and uploaded it you Youtube. The picture was grainy and jumpy and the man filming had been jostled and pushed as he filmed but for 2 minutes 34 seconds you clearly saw ten completely naked girls up on the auction stage being bidded for like a live cattle auction! It was a huge hit on Youtube and suddenly everybody was talking about Zonga and their new law. 

The feminists in the west were obviously up in arms about it whereas a lot of the male population of the western world treated it all with amusement and mutterings of what a good idea it was. For a while there was threats coming from Paris that it wouldn;t tolerate it's citizens being treated like that but they soon died down, especially as all ten girls had effectively now vanished, their new owners keeping them well hidden!

What nobody could of foreseen was what happened next.&nbsp; Although the feminists were loudly denouncing Zonga for it's backwards attitude to women, the normal women of the west seemed to find the idea of being legally sold into slavery strangely appealing.

Until last year Zonga had a grand total of one tourist spot, a small resort on the coast which to be honest was pretty lame compared to most. Once the French girls had been sold though and the news filtered though to the west the resort saw it's bookings quadruple overnight. What;s more, five other resorts quickly opened up, most barely habitable but in each case bookings were flowing in faster than they could almost cope with.

Although a fair proportion of these bookings were from men eager to find out what was possible about this exciting idea of owning a slave girl it quickly became apparently that a lot of the new tourists were women intrigued by the idea of actually becoming a slave girl and a lot of them got their wish!

The local males quickly caught on that there was now an almost unlimited amount of fresh western pussy flying into the country and they quickly started to take advantage. Practically every man who came to the country with a desirable wife or girlfriend was constantly harassed by the local men asking if he wanted to sell her. It was almost like begging but in reverse, instead of asking for money they were offering money, to buy your women. The definition of a desirable woman to the Zongan men was practically any women under 30 who was not overweight and if she was blonde even better!

Not surprisingly faced with the almost constant stream of requests a lot of men did indeed sell their woman to the slavers, quite often without much complaint from the woman herself.

If you were a woman on holiday in the country without a man to accompany you your chances of slavery were a lot higher as unaccompanied western women were often just literally snatched off the street and made slaves, no questions asked.

It was estimated that in the six months since the French girls were sold around 75% of all the western women visiting Zonga never came back. They were either sold into slavery by the male they went with or they simply disappeared off the street if they had no male with them. And yet despite this the tourist numbers were still increasing.

There were some extreme stories circulating, for example apparently a whole class of English schoolgirls had disappeared after having an unscheduled stop over at the airport on their way home from South Africa for example but there was no large international outcry, the feeling quickly became one of tolerance, if the Zongan government allowed female slavery and you were a female and went to Zonga what did you expect!

There was one problem with the increasing number of women available though, money. Zonga was a poor country in the first place, the average population existing on a pittance and in reality they could not afford to pay much for a slave girl, no matter how blonde and pretty she was. This was creating problems for the slave traders, what was the point of buying a slave if you practically had to give her away as nobody would pay good money for her.

One of the first English newspapers to run a story on the situation in Zonga had published a picture of two gorgeous and completely naked and shackled blonde twins with the heading that you could buy them for the total cost of $1, or 50 cents each!

This was great if you wanted to go to Zonga and buy them and play around with them for a while before flying back home but it was no good to the slave traders. They solution was obvious, export.

If there was no money at home to buy the girls then why not sell them abroad to people who did have money. Quite quickly ads started appearing in the western press for legal Zongan slaves available for purchase, free shipping thrown in! Apparently even if your own country did not allow slavery the fact that these girls were legally slaves in Zonga meant that you could legally buy them and have them transported to you and they would be your property the same as if you were in Zonga.

Needless to say this caught on big time, the slavers loved it as they could earn a lot more money from selling the girls and the buyers loved it because you could buy and own a slave girl legally for the first time. All of a sudden a young English girl could go to Zonga on holiday, end up as a slave there and then be shipped to the USA to her now legal owner.

And still the tourist numbers increased!

Against this background Tracey's editor had called her into his office one bright morning and suggested to her that flying to Zonga and writing a report on the ever increasing tourist trade and how it was linked to slavery would make a great story.

Now Tracey was a normal young woman, she had read previous reports of what was going on in Zonga with a degree of interest, and she would be lying to herself if she denied that the more lurid reports and pictures hadn't sent a small tingle of excitement down her body. She knew that deep down every girl at some time fantasied about being a slave girl, somebody's property with no rights or decision making, somebody's plaything to be used how and when they wanted. Tracey was also a realist though and she knew that some of these women flocking to Zonga were probably less than thrilled at how life as a slave girl actually was in reality!

So she found herself agreeing to her bosses request and within the week she was on the place to Zonga accompanied by the young photographer from the paper John Chambers. Tracey had not been over thrilled with the news that John would be going with her. For a start he was young, even younger than Tracey and she was a young reporter! There were rumours though that Johns father was close friends with the editor at the paper and had pulled a few strings to get his son on this job.

Apart from him being young Tracey was not keen on his attitude, from what little dealings she'd had with him before now he had come across as a cocky sexist pig! When they had had their last meeting with the editor at the office before leaving for the airport the editor had stressed to John that he wanted lot's of slave girl photo's from him,

�Plenty of slave girl flesh.� he had laughed and John had joined in making it plain that he intended to take as many pictures of naked girls as he could!

And then just as they were about to leave the editor had slapped John on the shoulders and winked at him before loudly saying,

�And if this one gives you any trouble just sell her, just make sure she's finished writing her story first.� he laughed jovially slapping John on the back.

�Is that an order Sir?� John had laughed.

�Sure why not, just make sure you get a good price for her, I'm sure I can find a replacement for her easily enough.� the editor had replied before they both burst out laughing again like two schoolboys telling a dirty joke, a joke Tracey didn't find funny at all!

Tracey had been fuming when they finally left the office, after all she had at least 4 years seniority on the papers over John but those two had been talking about her like she was some throw away pussy!

To make matters worse when they had checked in at the airport and the check in girl found out they were flying to Zonga she had giggled and said to John,

�Oh I'm surprised you've got her a return ticket Sir, it would be much cheaper to buy a single if you are planning to leave her there like most gentlemen do nowdays.�

John had just shot her a nonplussed look and she had carried on,

�I can still change it for you if you like?�

Probably more as a joke than anything John had asked her how much cheaper it would be for a single and when the check in girl confirmed a 40% saving John had laughed and given her the go ahead to reissue the ticket!

Tracey had started to complain at that point but John had turned to her and half smiled,

�Come on Tracey don't take it seriously, it's just a joke.� just as the check in girl heard him and said,

�Oh I've reissued it as a single now Sir, I can't reissue it twice I'm afraid.�

�Dam� John said but Tracey was sure he was not terribly put out!, �Okay no problem we can always buy you a single home from Zonga.�

�If you need one,� the check in girl giggled again, �I'm sure a pretty girl like her will soon be snapped up out there.�

And so Tracey had found herself seated on the air plane on her way to a well known slave trading country with the ringing endorsements to John to sell her by her boss and the aircraft check in girl!

She should have been annoyed, she should have been angry, after all she was now going to have to buy a single ticket home again, but instead she knew she was sopping wet!

The eight hour flight had been fairly uneventful until around midday local time they had arrived in the sweltering heat of Zonga. Once off the plane and bags collected they made their way through to customs and immigration where Tracey couldn't help but feel intimated by the large black men in uniforms and guns seemed to be in abundance.

Somehow Tracey had found herself in a separate lane to John who sailed through the customs checks but Tracey was delayed while she was casually questioned by a official who ended the conversation by asking her if she wanted to be given over to a slaver now rather than face being harassed outside! Tracey had politely declined the offer and quickly caught up with John and together they went through the large glass doors from the air conditioned airport to the unbearable heat of the Zongan noon sun.

The place seemed to be alive with noise and colour and sound and Tracey who had hardly set foot outside her home town before was almost overwhelmed. For the first time since the trip had been arranged she was glad that John was with her, especially so when thirty seconds later a young teenage boy had approached them and smiled at John and asked him in broken English if he wanted to sell his pussy!

Tracey had almost laughed at the scenario but giving the boys question some credence was the fact that attached to a length of rope he was casually holding in his hand were four completely naked blonde girls!

Tracey could see that each girl was very pretty, slender and full breasted and each had her hands tied tightly behind her back at the wrists, and she couldn't help but notice that two of the girls looked to be scared to death whereas the other two had an excited look in their eyes.

Once John had said no the boy the boy just shrugged and said,

�You buy pussy then, very cheap pussy for you, plenty of cheap deals.�

He prodded the tied girls forward so that John had the best view of their naked bodies and John did indeed have a good look at the merchandise before shaking his head at the boy who wandered off looking for the next potential customer pulling his little train of slaves behind him.

This same scene happened twice more before they managed to hail a taxi and even though Tracey had read all about what was going on in Zonga and had seen the pictures and videos seeing it in the flesh almost blew her mind. The dozen or so slave girls she had seen so far were all pretty white girls, all completely naked and tied, some had looked petrified and some had looked as if all their dreams had come true.

The three groups of slaves she had seen being paraded around outside the airport had been lead by what appeared to Tracey to be boys, none of them could have been older than 16 or 17 in her eyes. All three of them seemed to treat their older and naked female slaves as nothing more than pets to be lead around on a rope, seemingly oblivious to their nakedness, the only people really noticing that were the new arrivals straight off the plane and Tracey had seen more than a few men looking at all the naked girls with bug eyes.

Their taxi screeched to a halt as John raised his hand and the native driver jumped out and smiled at John and motioned at the rear of the car as the trunk lid popped open. Tracey assumed that was where the luggage was going and went to raise her bag from the airport trolley into the car when the driver angrily gestured at her to stop.

�Girl go in trunk mister, no girls in car allowed.� as if John should know this.

Tracey stared at him in amazement, surely he was joking, the idea of getting into the trunk was absurd, apart from the sheer ridiculousness of it the car was pretty old and dirty and the trunk appeared to be something of a black hole staring up at her.

'No it's okay,� John smiled a the driver,�this girl is no slave girl.� he said pointing at Tracey.

�No girl allowed in car,� the driver replied angrily,�no matter if not slave�

John shot Tracey an apologetic look and almost a shrug of the shoulders but there was no way Tracey was going to climb into the dirty trunk just like that!

�Look I'm a British citizen and I've come to your country to write a story for my newspaper, I am most certainly not a slave girl and never will be and I demand that you take me to our hotel right this instance!�

Despite her best annoyed British accent and tone the cab driver barely registered Tracey's complaint and instead looking straight at John repeated his mantra about girls not being allowed into the cab.

�Perhaps it would be easier if you just got into the trunk, I don't think it's far to the hotel and it would save us making a scene here.� John looked at Tracey.

�No way!� Tracey retorted almost stamping her foot.

�Look there's a queue behind us and we need to get to the hotel and get settled in, let's just get there shall we.� John said trying to make getting into the trunk perfectly natural.

Tracey looked behind herself and she saw that there was indeed a queue forming at the taxi rank, not a very happy queue either and with another look at the taxi driver who was making no signs or relenting she sighed and said to John,

�Okay but this is the one and only time.� and she started to raise her foot towards the trunk of the car when the cab driver once again stepped forward and almost shouted at her.

�No, no, must be naked.�

Tracey just stood there, her foot slightly off the ground as she look at him in horror, surely he couldn't mean what he'd just said but he went on, 

'Girl not allowed clothes in trunk.�

Stamping her foot squarely back down on the ground she looked at John and as sternly as she could said,

'If you think I'm going to get into that dirty trunk with no clothes on right here in broad daylight you've got another think coming!�

The cab driver was looking at John with an exparasted look on his face as if it was John's fault that he did not know how to control his women.

�Tracey please, come on just do as he says, let's get to the hotel and we can get this trip started properly, �It's not as if there aren't lot's of naked girls around here anyway.� he said sweeping his hand around the airport concourse.

That was one fact that Tracey couldn't dispute, there were indeed around a dozen naked girls being led around the concourse within sight as John swept his arm around the view but surely he couldn't really be suggesting that she undress right there in front of him and the cab driver! 

Certainly the cab driver was expecting just that as he moved closer to Tracey and held his hand out as if to collect her clothes.

With a final glare of pure venom at John she started to undress and hand her clothes to the driver who now seemed to have a smile on his face! For a few seconds when she was down to her underwear she thought he might relent but with a beckoning finger she knew she had to hand him her last vestiges of cover as well and she was quickly completely naked.

She'd dared not look at John as she was undressing but she risked a glance now and noted with dismay the grin on his face and the look of lust in his eyes as he looked his work colleague up and down.

Quickly Tracey climbed into the trunk which was surprisingly deep and as she gingerly settled down into it's depths she was sure she saw the driver casually drop her clothes into a rubbish bin before the trunk was unceremoniously shut plunging her into darkness.

Well John might not thought it was too far to the hotel but to Tracey the trip seemed to take an eternity! The ride was bumpy as hell in the old car and even though she was out of the sun the trunk was stiffening hot inside. She couldn't believe that was was laying there completely naked listening to John and the drivers muffled voices from up ahead chatting casually as if they were both used to driving around with a naked girl in the trunk! Maybe the cab driver was used to it but Tracey hadn;t liked the look on John's face when he'd seen her undress and climb into the boot of the car, she was going to have a hard time exerting any authority over him from this starting position!

Finally after what seemed to be at least thirty minitues the car stopped and she heard the doors opening before the trunk lid was popped and bright sunlight flooded onto her making her squint her eyes as she looked up at John's smiling face.

�Come on Princess, this is meant to be a working trip, we can't have you laying around all day.� he laughed offering her his hand.

Tracey could quite easily of punched him right there and then but instead she took the offered hand and climbed out of the car trunk acutely conscious of her nakedness as she stood at the entrance of their hotel.

As John paid the driver she looked around in vain for any sign of her clothes but not seeing any she pulled one of her cases towards her from where it had been deposited on the pavement with the intention of opening it and getting something to cover her nakedness with but instead John suddenly snatched the case from her hand.

�Better not, let's get booked in first, you never know the hotel may have similar rules about girls wearing clothes as the taxi's do and we don't want to cause another scene do we.�

Cause another scene! That was easy for him to say, he wasn't the one standing naked on the pavement with people walking by!

�John, I need to put something on.� she said as sternly as she could although even she noted the slightly pleading tone in her voice.

�Of course sweet heart, let's get booked in first and then we can sort you out, see what the cab driver gave me for you?� he smiled holding up his hand in which rested a small leather collar,�he said if I put this on you I wouldn't get pestered to sell you so often because people will think your a slave girl already, wasn't that good of him?�

Tracey stood in stunned silence as John fastened the collar around her neck, pulling it tight before fastening it with some clasp at the back.

�There's a good girl, now let's get check in.� he smiled and with a pat on her bottom they walked towards the door of the hotel.

The interior of the hotel was cool which was a relief, it was also quite sumptuous which made Tracey even more aware of her nakedness as John strode purposefully towards the check in desk which made her scamper along behind him to keep up.

The only thing that made Tracey accept her state of undress slightly easier was the fact that the three check in girls were all completely naked like her! All three were white, blonde, and beautiful, not to mention big breasted, a fact that hadn't escaped John's eyes! In fact Tracey thought with a wry thought, if the worst came to the worst she could probably work here, she would fit right in!

John handled the checking in and a porter and the only unusual thing was that Tracey was asked to hand over her passport to the check in girl, apparently it was another rule for girls and not men as John wasn't asked for his. She did notice that the girl had rather casually thrown Tracey's passport into a cardboard tray tray which was already overflowing with other passports, indeed Tracey's passport had fallen on to the floor from the tray and the girl had just bent over and picked it up before pushing it down onto the overflowing tray again and Tracey wondered how may of those girls actually reclaimed their passports from that tray! A porter was summoned to carry their bags up to their rooms which were adjoining on the second floor. Two minutes later finally alone and in her room Tracey could relax and as she fell onto the bed she couldn;t believe the last hour. Her nakedness, the casual nakedness of other girls around her, the young boys leading groups of slave girls behind them, the ride in the trunk of the taxi, the fact that John had seen her naked and even fastened a leather collar around her neck, a collar she couldn't undo, she'd tried, all of it was so embarrassing, so humiliating, and god dam it, so exciting!

Hitting the shower and luxuriating in the warm water she couldn't stop her fingers moving towards her pussy and before she knew it she was bringing herself to an intense orgasm. Half of her hated herself for feeling this way, after all although she wasn't a raging feminist she at least thought women were the equal of men, but to see women so dominated so much and to seemingly accept it so willingly shook her to her core, part repelled, part so turned on!

After the shower she laid on her bed and let the excitement and lengthy air flight catch up on her and before she knew it she was asleep, absently mindedly tugging at the tight leather collar around her neck.

When she finally woke she saw with a start that the room was dark and looking at the beside clock it told her she had been asleep for 6 hours! Rising quickly she wondered for a moment what she should wear, despite it now being evening the heat was still oppressive and she cursed herself for not putting the air conditioning on when she'd first entered the room. She finally decided on a thong and&nbsp; light summer dress. Not wearing a bra made her feel slightly naughty but then she thought that a few hours earlier she had been walking through the hotel completely naked so going braless under her dress was quite the height of modesty in comparison!

Knocking lightly and then more heavily on John's door she soon realised that he was not in and so slightly fearfully she ventured down to the hotel lobby by herself. She was slightly fearful because for the first time since landing she was unaccompanied and she knew full well what that could mean here. On the other hand she was in a civilised hotel and she did have her slave collar on so she should be safe.

Approaching the desk she asked one of the naked receptionists if there was a message for her and when hearing the answer no she cursed John under her breath and smiling at the receptionist she took a seat against the wall hoping that John had merely gone out for a quick walk and would be back soon, it was one thing to walk around a western style hotel on your own, quite another to start walking the streets!

Twenty minutes went by and Tracey was becoming inpatient, not to mention hungry with still no sign of John when a swarthy man of middle eastern appearance suddenly sat beside her. For a minute he didn't say a word but Tracey could feel his eyes travelling up and down her body creeping her out and making her wish she had worn a bra after all. Finally he said something to her in a language she didn't understand or even recognise. She had shaken her head and muttered that she did not understand him when he smiled and said in perfect English,

�Are you for sale lovely lady?�

Looking as indignant as she possible could Tracey almost snarled at the man,

�No I am not.�

With his smile not flickering at all the man said,

�You have a slave collar on my lovely, of course you are for sale, now why don't you stand up and let me assess you.�

She was seriously weighing up whether slapping him would be a good idea when she suddenly heard John's voice say,

�Stand up for the gentleman Tracey, how else will he decide on a price for you.�

For a split second she was relieved to hear his voice but then she realised what he had said and she shot a look behind her to reproach him.

John too had a stupid grin on his face but he was also looking at her expectantly, waiting for her to stand up. Tracey looked him in the eye meaning to tell him exactly what she thought of him but in a millisecond she caught a slight wink, or at least she thought she did, and she thought, sod it, if he wants to play a silly little game I'll show him how to play!

Not quite believing what she was doing Tracey slowly stood up and turned to face her potential buyer. She knew this was a game, she was sure it was just a game, but she couldn;t stop the tingling between her legs as she lowered her head and gazed at her feet suddenly feeling terribly submissive, hating herself for feeling that way but also loving the feeling as well!

�She's a very pretty girl, how much did you want for her?� 

�Oh I don't know, I'm new to all this, why don;t you make me an offer.� Tracey heard John chuckle beside her.

�Well she has a pretty face but I need to see her body.� the man smiled.

�Of course,� John replied and turning slightly to Tracey he said, �remove your dress.�

Slightly panicked Tracey looked up at him, he was still lightly smiling but he was obviously expecting her to do as she was told. He was only playing a game with her she told herself, wasn't he? She quickly looked around the hotel lobby, there were a few people dotted around but nobody was paying any attention to her little group, after all there were three completely naked receptionists a few feet away. Well if he was playing with her and testing how far she would go she was prepared to play along, at least for the minute and so taking hold of the hems of her dress she lifted up up past her waist and off over her head in one swift movement before dropping it on the chair she had been sitting in less than a minute earlier.

She could suddenly feel the chill of the air-conditioning on her almost totally exposed body, her only covering her thin white thong, and she couldn't believe she was standing there like that, exposing her nakedness to a work colleague and even worse, to a total stranger who wanted to buy her! All of a sudden her years of education and her high powered job was wiped away, all she was was a pretty blonde girl up for sale to the highest bidder, she may as well be a prize cow!

�Humph, very nice, I love these English girls, they have such heavy looking breasts.� the man laughed and as Tracey stood there he raised himself up from the chair and approached her before casually cupping her right breast in his hand and hefting it as if he was weighing it.

For the next minute or two the man ran his hands over every part of Tracey's naked body, this included pulling her thong down to her ankles and her stepping out of it so that she was completely naked. The man poked and prodded, squeezed, pinched, stroked and caressed all he could and for the whole time Tracey was fighting against orgasm. She couldn't begin to describe how damn horny she was at being treated this way, all around her people were checking in and out and nobody was paying any attention as she was inspected like she was a piece of livestock. What was annoying was the fact that every time she stole a glance at John she could see from the smile on his face that he knew exactly how turned on she was by the whole experience!

�Yes she is certainly a beautiful girl, I will offer you $10 for her.� the man said to John stepping back from Tracey.

Tracey almost exclaimed her disgust at such a paltry offer for her herself but she caught herself before she could say anything and to her relief John seemed to think the mans offer was just as laughable.

�Oh come on I think you can do better than that, after all you said she was a beautiful girl yourself.� John laughed gently.

�Indeed I did,� the man replied smiling,�but there are lots of beautiful girls like her for sale and they are cheap, pussy is a cheap commodity now.�

Commodity, it sent a shiver down Tracey's spine as she thought of herself as a commodity!

�Well you may well be right,� she heard John laugh and his next words shook her to her core,�okay I think I can agree to $10 for her.�

Hold on, this was a game wasn't it? John was playing with her, testing her, surely he wasn't going to really sell her to this man? And if he was selling her what did the man have planned for her. Even more puzzling was the fact that she was so wet her juices were openly running down her legs!

She barely heard John and the man continue to talk, all she could think about was the fact that she was being sold as a slave for a tiny amount of money, apparently all that a pussy like her was worth.

She was bought back to her senses by John throwing her dress at her which she just caught as she caught sight of the man walking away apparently angrily.

�What did you say to him?� she asked warily as she pulled her dress back on, her panties seemingly disappeared she noticed.

�I just told him I'd changed my mind,� John laughed,�don't worry I was never really going to sell you to him, I just wanted to give you a taste of what it would feel like to be sold, I kinda got the impression you were quite enjoying the experience.� he winked at her and not for the first time his arrogance annoyed the hell out of her, or was it the fact that he was right!

�I'd be silly to sell you now anyway,� he laughed, �you haven't written your story yet and I don't fancy going back to the boss with just pictures and no story, don't worry though your time will come Tracey, specially as I know how easy it is to sell you now.� he laughed and Tracey was in two minds whether to hit him or hug him!

The next three days passed in a bit of a blur to Tracey. Although she was writing her story as they went the whole thing seemed surreal to Tracey. Everywhere they went there were naked girls, naked girls working in bars and restaurants, shops, even the local hospital Tracey noticed. There was also naked girls on practically every street corner, usually tied or chained together and usually in the custody of a young boy who was happily trying to sell them to anyone who wanted one. Most of the girls were white and western and it seemed to Tracey that half seemed to be living their dream or living their new life as a slave girl, the other half did not seem to be enjoying the experience so much, probably when they full reality of their new position in life hit them.

The annoying thing was though Tracey couldn't get to speak to any of the girls, either they simply did not want to talk to her or their �masters� would not allow it. In the end Tracey's story was consisting of her own observations but no real first hand experiences or feelings.
Beside her all the way was John, mostly happily snapping as many pictures of naked slave girls as he could, usually making light banter with the slave owners and generally behaving in a most chauvinistic and sexist way.

On the second night they had ended up in a bar where John had got talking to a couple of middle aged fat American men who had expressed an interest in buying Tracey and once again Tracey had found herself having to strip naked to be assessed while John toyed with the idea of selling her, and once again Tracey had been so annoyed with herself for allowing John to do this to her and also annoyed with herself for being so turned on by the experience!

There had been added element of danger as John had been more than a little drunk and for a minute or two it seemed that he had forgotten this was just a game and Tracey was sure that she was indeed about to be sold for real when John had managed to redeem the situation.

Finally on the morning on the fourth day she was woken by a sharp knock on her bedroom door and John entered looking flustered.

�We've got to get back to England today Tracey,� he said as he pulled her suitcase from out under the bed and dropped it down in front of her,�the boss has called and said he needs me back to cover some riots or something in London so we've got to get to the airport.�

In some ways she wasn't too unhappy at a speedy exit, being in Zonga had been sexually intoxicating but she knew it was also dangerous for a girl like her. Apart from John pretending to sell her those two times she was aware that men had constantly been looking at her as they had walked around and she knew that without John by her side she would not be a free woman for long!

Getting out of bed and not bothering to hide her nakedness from John she jumped into the shower for a few minutes and quickly dried herself off and pulled on a light dress, no underwear, she had learnt that it was not an essential part of her wardrobe. John had gone back to his room to finish packing and so Tracey quickly did the same and then joined John outside his room.

�Ready?� he asked and on her nod he said, �Good, taxi is already here let's go.�

She quickly followed John down the stairs and through the hotel lobby straight out the front door to where a taxi was waiting. She assumed John had settled the bill as they did not go near the reception desk and as they placed their bags on the ground beside the taxi she hard the driver say,

�Girl get in trunk.�

Four days in Zonga had obviously acclimatised Tracey as she didn't even argue, just rolled here eyes as she slipped the dress up over her head before handing it to John and climbing into the cars trunk naked.

The journey to the airport seemed just as long, hot and bumpy though and by the time they stopped and the driver opened the trunk Tracey was laying in a pool of her own sweat. As she clambered out of the trunk she saw John already striding towards to airport entrance and she hurried to catch up with him fully aware of her nakedness as she ran past lots of people milling about.

Finally catching up near the check in desk she saw with dismay that he was not holding her dress as she'd hoped and as he turned to her he scowled at her,

�Did you pick up your passport from the hotel reception?�

Tracey's heart sank, no she hadn't, she hadn't had time as they'd left in such a hurry, the haste making her forget all about it to be honest.

With a shake of her head John knew the answer and he scowled again,

�Well looks like your in trouble then Tracey, you have no passport, no ticket out of her and no clothes, you can guess what's going to happen to you!�

She looked at him shocked, yes they had played the game of him selling her before, and yes she knew that he knew the idea excited her, but it was a fantasy, a fantasy she wasn't sure she wanted to make a reality.

�Don't be silly John, you can't do that.� she squealed desperately but he sudden grabbed her arm and started dragging her towards a young boy who was standing beside a pillar casually holding the ropes attached to two naked slave girls.

�I don;t have any choice Tracey, I have to leave on the next plane and you have no passport or ticket, what else am I supposed to do, you have finished the story haven't you?�

�Well yes it's in my bag,� Tracey squealed and then realised what she'd just said when a smile crossed Johns lips and as they approached the boy she saw him look at them and smile.

�Hi, how much will you give me for this one,?�

She saw the boys eyes darting up and down her naked body and shuddered at the humiliation, she knew this time that it wasn't a game, the boy was assessing her life!

�Five dollars.� the boy grinned and she saw John nod before laughing,� Okay that should get me a beer on the plane back home, it's a deal.�

Quick as a flash the boy threaded a rope through the ring on her collar and she was pulled in against the other two leased girls as she saw him hand the $5 to John who with a final smile to her said,

�Don't worry Tracey, I'll make sure your story gets published, enjoy your new life here.� and with that he was gone.

As Tracey stood there while the boy deftly tied her wrists together behind her back she wondered if she would ever get the chance to write a new story, �My life as a slave� perhaps!
