A Pointless Existence [ a short story ] by andy28_rl@yahoo.co.uk

Thought I would try a short story for a change �occasionally, I scare and amaze myself when I read back what my fiendish mind has written:&nbsp; let me know your reaction to the story !

Why me ?&nbsp; It&#8217;s a question I have asked myself often.&nbsp; I have nothing else to do other than ask questions now.&nbsp; But still I can&#8217;t understand why fate has placed me here.&nbsp; Why any other human being would want to do this to a fellow human being.&nbsp; I have come to understand and accept my fate.&nbsp; That my life as a human being is over, and that my fate is sealed.&nbsp; But I can never accept it.&nbsp; It is all so unfair.&nbsp; A promising life is over.&nbsp; God damn it, more than that.&nbsp; My life is over.&nbsp; My life as a normal man has been taken away from me at the whim of someone else, and I am completely powerless to do anything about it.

I could almost understand it &#8211; no, I will never understand it &#8211;if I had done something wrong.&nbsp; If I had deserved my fate, then maybe I could in some way accept it.&nbsp; But he told me &#8211; the one time that I saw him and spoke to him &#8211; that I should understand I had done nothing wrong.&nbsp; That he just wanted to own another man, and keep him forever in bondage.&nbsp; To waste his life in total isolation and helpless suffering.&nbsp; He told me that he had watched me at the swimming pool, had watched me shower afterwards.&nbsp; That he liked my body and my face and that he wanted me as his victim.

I was Tom.&nbsp; I was a 22 year old athlete.&nbsp; District Swimming Champion.&nbsp; I had just finished my studies to become an architect and just proposed to my girlfriend.&nbsp; Life was good.&nbsp; I had a lot to look forward to.&nbsp; It can only have been months ago, but it seems another world now.&nbsp; Another life.

Are they still looking for me after all this time ?&nbsp; I often wonder if I am still a part of their lives &#8211; my friends, my girlfriend &#8211; or if they don&#8217;t think about me any more.&nbsp; In time my memory will fade completely.&nbsp; It will be accepted that I am gone forever.&nbsp; And yet I live on, helplessly imprisoned.&nbsp; Their lives will go on.&nbsp; They will see the sunshine, taste the fine foods and enjoy the niceties of life.&nbsp; Sure, they will be tinged with a sense of loss at my disappearance.&nbsp; But their lives will be lived.&nbsp; Not like mine.

It was one evening when I left the pool, dark outside, that my life changed forever.&nbsp; I was returning to my car, parked in the back street, when I felt a prick through my jeans and into my arse.&nbsp; I turned around and crumpled to the ground.&nbsp; I was aware of what was happening, but my body would not respond.&nbsp; I watched through my still, glassy eyes as he dragged me to a nearby van and heaved me into the back.

My brain was in turmoil.&nbsp; What was happening ?&nbsp; Where was I going ?&nbsp; Who had done this ? Why would anyone do this to me ?&nbsp; I had no enemies.

We drove for only minutes.&nbsp; My current location is near to my old life.&nbsp; I could no doubt jog from where I am now to my family and friends.&nbsp; To freedom.&nbsp; I feel sure that, were I to be set free, I would know the location on sight.&nbsp; He carried me from the van over his shoulder and into a small terraced house.&nbsp; Unremarkable.&nbsp; Normal.&nbsp; My glazed eyes noticed the tidy garden and I heard the attention seeking cry of a cat as I entered his kitchen through the rear door.&nbsp; He appeared to be a normal guy, a model citizen.

We paused in the hallway as he opened the cupboard under the stairs.&nbsp; I noticed the heaviness of the door, clearly metal.&nbsp; �Soundproofed,� he stated, in a matter-of-fact voice.&nbsp; The first word he had uttered.&nbsp; A bare bulb illuminated a set of steps and we moved down them, me dribbling spit down his shoulder as I watched the world disappear above me.

We entered a cellar, illuminated by a single bare bulb.&nbsp; The cellar was dusty, unused.&nbsp; A bare room without windows, whitewashed and stark.&nbsp; He lifted me off his shoulder and sat me down on a red plastic chair.&nbsp; Turning his back to me, he walked away into the corner and I watched his large frame as he disappeared from my field of vision.&nbsp; Still I could not move, though my brain screamed at my muscles to escape.

He reappeared in front of me and I realised that he was behind a pane of glass.&nbsp; As my eyes attempted to focus, I could see that he was stood in front of me inside a large metal container, with a glass window, that occupied the centre of the room.&nbsp; He knocked on the glass and waved at me, taunting my inability to move, before disappearing again.

Now he came directly before me again and sat on a chair facing me.&nbsp; I looked at his face for the first time.&nbsp; I had no idea who he was.&nbsp; Just a normal man.&nbsp; In his early thirties, a small beard and a heavy frame.&nbsp; Unremarkable.&nbsp; I could have passed him in the street many times.&nbsp; His eyes bored into mine.&nbsp; I knew that my life was in his hands.

�I want you to know that I have chosen you carefully.&nbsp; I have looked for my boy for a long time, and I chose you because I liked your body and your face.&nbsp; It doesn&#8217;t really matter, but I thought I would choose someone who I found attractive to be my boy.�
I stared into his eyes, trying to move my unresponding muscles with no success and struggling to understand the words spoken with such calm and sincerity.
�This is the only time you will ever see me, but I wanted you to know who has done this to you.&nbsp; I want you to remember my face and know that it was me who took away your life boy.&nbsp; You have done nothing wrong, nothing to deserve this.&nbsp; I just want to own another man.&nbsp; I want to keep you as my prisoner for the rest of your life.&nbsp; Just because I can.�

I could not comprehend what he was saying.&nbsp; I wanted to scream.&nbsp; I forced out a grunt and a sigh, and he laughed.&nbsp; Looking back, I wonder now what I would have said.&nbsp;&nbsp; What questions I would have asked.&nbsp; If I would have begged for my freedom.

�Time for you to go home now.&nbsp; Time for my boy to meet his new world.&nbsp; The place where you will live for the rest of your life.�

He picked me up again and carried me over to the metal container.&nbsp; Pulling back the heavy entrance, he carried me inside and laid me on the floor.&nbsp; I rolled my eyes around in fright at the dull metal inside of the container, and then back again at my captor.

Wordlessly, he removed my boots and then my socks.&nbsp; Without a pause, he pulled up my tshirt, over my arms and then over my head.&nbsp; Breathing heavily, with excitement it seemed to me, he undid my belt and pulled down my jeans.&nbsp; I shivered in fear and disbelief as he grabbed at my briefs and pulled them off to leave me sprawled naked before him.&nbsp; With a grunt, he picked up my clothes and tossed them out of the door before turning back to me and pushing me onto my back.&nbsp; I laid there naked before him, and felt the shame and humiliation of my total helplessness.&nbsp; Exposed naked on the floor.

He took a minute to run his eyes over my naked body, before he turned behind him and grabbed something from the floor.&nbsp; �Time to get you dressed boy.&nbsp; The clothes I give you now will be all you get to wear for the rest of your life.�&nbsp; He grinned at me, before sitting astride my chest.&nbsp; I saw the glint of steel and felt the cold of something around my neck.&nbsp; He was placing a thick metal collar around my neck.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wordlessly, he pushed me onto my side and my eyes watered at the flashes of a soldering iron.&nbsp; I felt a burning heat at the back of my neck, and the collar was soldered in place for life.

Next he lifted my right leg in the air, and I watched as a thick steel band was placed around my ankle.&nbsp; Like my neck, it was locked shut for life and I watched as he attached some iron chain to my manacle.&nbsp; I felt my leg being placed somewhere and more soldering, but at that stage did not understand the significance.

�Only one more item of clothing for you boy I&#8217;m afraid.�

I could only lie there, my face towards the ceiling of my metal prison as it was pushed upwards by my collar.&nbsp; Lie there as I felt him place a thick metal band around my waist.&nbsp; I felt my penis being pushed downwards into a tube and felt it pushed between my legs before another soldering action locked the belt in place.

�Just in case you are wondering boy, that&#8217;s a very heavy metal chastity belt locked on.&nbsp; You will never feel your cock again, it&#8217;s locked between your legs.&nbsp; Hope you had a wank today boy, as you will never ever have another.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t want you enjoying your new life in any way I&#8217;m afraid.�

I lay there in disbelief as he tidied away his tools, exiting the container.&nbsp; Could this be for real ?&nbsp; How could this possibly be happening to me ?&nbsp; I was in a state of shock and I could not comprehend the enormity of what was happening to me.&nbsp; Why was he speaking in such gentle tones and yet sentencing me to a life of constant nakedness and imprisonment ?

Finally, he re-entered the container and stood above me, his body towering over my chest.&nbsp; �Well, I guess it&#8217;s goodbye boy.&nbsp; I will be watching you and feeding you and cleaning you, but you will never see me again.&nbsp; Just know that I own you completely boy, and you will never ever taste freedom again.� He smiled viciously at me, turned his back and exited the container.

I watched in amazement as the door was slammed shut behind him, hearing the heavy duty locking devices slide into place before I heard the sound of the soldering iron welding me into my prison.

It was several hours before I could move enough to sit up.&nbsp; Enough to run my fingers around the tight metal collar around my neck, that keeps my head facing forwards.&nbsp; Enough to find the heavy metal chain that binds my ankle to a sturdy metal ring in the centre of the container and allows me only a metre circle of freedom in which to move.&nbsp; Enough to explore my chastity device and realise the cruelty of a device that has my penis encased in heavy steel between my legs, forever.&nbsp; Enough to explore the heavy metal container intimately and discover that there is absolutely no hope of escape ever.&nbsp; The pure metal surrounds me, apart from a metre square window made of frosted glass, through which an opaque dim light casts some light into my dark and dismal world.

That was months ago.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know exactly how long ago.&nbsp; It didn&#8217;t seem to serve any purpose in counting the days after a while.&nbsp; Maybe a year ago.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know.&nbsp; A year of my life wasted, living naked in chains in a metal box.&nbsp; Never released.&nbsp; Never seeing my captor.&nbsp; Never hearing any noise, or seeing anything except for my dull prison.&nbsp; Never having any form of contact, any form of mental relief from my constant imprisonment.&nbsp; Always aware of my pointless existence as owned property, locked away for the amusement of my owner.

I have come to accept that I rely on him completely.&nbsp; Once a day, he drops a large cube of ice through a hinged opening near the roof.&nbsp; Ice that forms my drink and an iced cube of mush &#8211; my food.&nbsp; I suck on the ice cube for my life, and eat the mushy food when it thaws.&nbsp; Eat it from my hands so that it does not land on the filthy floor.&nbsp; I think it is dog food.&nbsp; It never changes.

I piss and shit in my cell.&nbsp; On the floor like an animal.&nbsp; I have no toilet.&nbsp; I can never be released for cleaning, and so I learn to live, to eat and sleep in my own waste.&nbsp; To lie in my own shit and feel it caked on my body, and between my filthy toes.&nbsp; I come to relish the day every so often when the cell is flushed out with cold water through an opening for the jet washer.&nbsp; When I can watch my shit drain away below me and I have a briefly clean world.

I stink of piss and shit.&nbsp; My matted hair and full beard are filthy, as is my naked body.&nbsp; My mouth is never clean of the dog food, my taste buds never used to taste real food or drink anything but a block of ice.&nbsp; I have never seen anything outside of my cell, the frosted toughened glass give me no glimpse of the outside.&nbsp;&nbsp; I sometimes see shadows at the window.&nbsp; I know that he can see inside through the one way mirror of the glass.&nbsp; He can watch my misery and total isolation.&nbsp; He watches my life waste away for no reason, and I am sure it gives him great pleasure.&nbsp; No doubt he enjoys a good wank, watching me.

I wonder how long I can survive like this.&nbsp; Total boredom.&nbsp; No reason to think.&nbsp; Nothing but memories to think about, but memories that cause me pain as I remember what it was like to be a man.&nbsp; Why me ?&nbsp; It is so, so unfair.&nbsp; My cock tries to erect in its tight chastity tube but I can never have the freedom of ejaculation, of feeling my cock.&nbsp; That would be freedom.&nbsp; I am not allowed any form of freedom, I have come to realise.&nbsp; My future will forever be a wasted life, locked naked in chains inside a metal prison of a can for no reason.

As I lie here naked in misery, I dream of one day being discovered.&nbsp; Of someone entering the cellar, seeing this filthy piece of flesh and realising I am a man and not an animal.&nbsp; Not a piece of meat to watch through a window.&nbsp; I dream of one day being free again.&nbsp; Maybe it will happen.&nbsp; There is a chance.&nbsp; Maybe you will find me.&nbsp; Maybe I am living in the cellar next door to you.&nbsp; Please come and find me.&nbsp; Please, I beg you.&nbsp; Please let me free.
