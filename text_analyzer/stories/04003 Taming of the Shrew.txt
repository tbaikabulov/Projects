Taming of the Shrew
By Brabazon

Part 1

It was 10 o&#8217;clock on Saturday morning in the north London suburbs.&nbsp; The front door of the house slammed shut and, from his study, Bill watched his second wife, Maria, jogging down the drive in her tennis kit and jumping into her silver convertible Merc before speeding off to her tennis club.&nbsp; Cute bum, nice body, athletic, half Italian, beautiful, age 32, looked a bit like Eva Longoria, and independently wealthy as well through an inheritance.&nbsp; God, though, she was a pain in the arse, he thought.&nbsp; Nag, nag, nag, lazy around the house, spendthrift, bad-tempered, giving him sex about once a month, if that.&nbsp; After a couple of years of marriage it was pretty clear to him that Maria had been looking for money and social position and, now that she had them, had little further interest in her husband.&nbsp; Not for the first time, Bill wondered about divorce but his wife was not only cute-looking but also smart enough to hire a lawyer who would take him to the cleaners in any settlement.&nbsp; He was also pretty damn sure that she was having affairs with both her tennis coach and personal trainer.

With a sigh, Bill returned to his reading, a correspondence course in hypnotism, called �Total Mind Control &#8211; Guaranteed Results or Your Money Back�.&nbsp; After three months, he was on the final instalment of the course, and ready to give it a try. Maria returned at 2 pm, looking very pleased with herself and Bill was more certain than ever that she had been shagging her tennis instructor.&nbsp; Bill joined her as she was getting a coffee and tried out the hypnotism routine.&nbsp; The idea was that you used a key word to start and finish each session and that the subject would follow implanted suggestions without remembering them.&nbsp; It sounded too good to be true, thought Bill gloomily, but he was willing to give it a go.&nbsp; �Bootsie�, he thought, would be a nice key word for Marcia, given her collection of dozens of expensive shoes.

To Bill&#8217;s surprise, the technique appeared to work.&nbsp; Maria took on a slightly glazed expression and sat there quietly when he asked her to stop talking and listen to him.&nbsp; As an experiment, he told her to wear a black tee-shirt, jeans and cowboy boots when she got changed out of her tennis kit, and he then ended the session.&nbsp; Sure enough, when Maria came back down after a shower she was wearing a black tee-shirt, jeans and cowboy boots.&nbsp; Bill smiled.&nbsp; A bit more practice and he could see some real improvements happening.

The next day, over breakfast, Bill again put Maria into a trance. 

�You think that we ought to have a live in maid,� he told her.&nbsp; �It will be your idea and it will be the most important thing in your head until it is arranged.&nbsp; You will want me to fix it up for you as soon as possible.&nbsp; You will accept my choice of maid.&nbsp; Okay, Bootsie, you can wake up now.�

Within half an hour, Maria had started nagging Bill to hire a maid to help her around the house.&nbsp; On and on and on she went, and eventually Bill gave in and agreed to sort it out.&nbsp; He found that there were plenty of internet employment agency sites which listed candidates and eventually found one who sounded promising.&nbsp; Erika was aged 19, a Hungarian who had recently arrived in the UK, and who was described as hard working and good-natured.&nbsp; She hoped to improve her English while in the country.&nbsp; Bill saw in her photos a very attractive, demure-looking girl who seemed to have an almost identical size and build to that of his wife.&nbsp; A quick call to the agency, and an interview was arranged for next day.

When Erika arrived, Bill chatted to her for a while and explained what her household duties would be and offered her twice the going rate.&nbsp; Erika accepted on the spot and it was agreed that she would move in that evening from her hostel.&nbsp; She arrived carrying a single, small suitcase, which contained all her possessions, and Bill introduced her to Maria.&nbsp; All that evening, his wife&#8217;s face was like thunder &#8211; Erika was much too young and much too attractive.&nbsp; Maria wanted to send her back to the agency but somehow she couldn&#8217;t find the words to countermand Bill&#8217;s choice.&nbsp; Still, she rationalised to herself as she went to bed that night, it would be easy enough to find an excuse to sack her and get a more suitable replacement.

Before leaving for work the next morning, Bill had another quick session with Maria.&nbsp; He explained that she was to be very nice, and as helpful as possible, to Erika and to do anything that Erika asked her to do.&nbsp; The most important thing in her life right now was that she should please Erika and make her happy.

That day, Maria was like a puppy.&nbsp; She followed Erika around the house, made her cups of coffee, bought her a nice lunch in a local restaurant, and listened attentively to her fractured English.&nbsp; Maria, who never normally touched housework, probably did most of the work that day, helping Erika to clean, wash and iron.&nbsp; She even cancelled her tennis lesson because she knew that it was so important to help Erika and to get off on the right foot with her new maid.&nbsp; After lunch, Maria asked Erika if she was feeling tired and when she said that she was Maria insisted that she have a rest on the sofa and watch TV while Maria did the hovering.

Over dinner, Bill asked Maria how she had found Erika and, in stark contrast to the previous day, his wife was gushing in her enthusiasm for her new servant.&nbsp; Bill decided to tighten the screw a bit and told his wife that she now had an overpowering sexual longing for Erika.&nbsp; She would be submissive in Erika&#8217;s presence and agree with everything that she said.&nbsp; It would be a nice idea, he added, if she could lend Erika some of her clothes, since they were the same build.&nbsp; That night, as he pretended to be asleep, he heard Maria making herself come and moaning Erika&#8217;s name.

The next day, Maria&#8217;s puppy-like behaviour around Erika continued, and Erika soon discovered that Maria would do anything that she asked her to do.&nbsp; Erika asked for an advance on her first month&#8217;s wages and borrowed Maria&#8217;s car to go out shopping while Maria herself stayed in to finish the laundry and polish the silver.&nbsp; Maria took care to do a really good job on the silver, which took her hours, because she wanted so much to please Erika.&nbsp; Later that day, she invited Erika into her bedroom to look through her clothes and jewellery and meekly suggested that if Erika wanted to borrow anything she was to do so without even asking.&nbsp; All of Maria&#8217;s clothing was expensive and Erika, who came from a poor family, had never seen anything like it.&nbsp; She happily spent the next few hours trying on dresses, underwear and expensive jewellery while Maria put on some old jeans and a tee-shirt and dusted the bookshelves in the house.&nbsp; Occasionally, Erika would ask Maria what she thought of a particular outfit and Maria was always gushing in her praise.&nbsp; She also asked Erika if she would like to use her make-up and perfumes.&nbsp; All the time Maria was sneaking glances of longing and Erika and was constantly aroused in her presence.

Erika especially liked a little black Versace evening dress and Maria insisted that she have it for herself and wear it that evening, with some pricey high-heeled shoes and a diamond necklace which had cost thousands.&nbsp; Maria told her that she looked so lovely that she wanted her to have dinner with her and her husband.&nbsp; When Bill came home late he found Erika sitting down and drinking a cocktail which Maria had made for her and looking stunningly attractive in her new clothes.&nbsp; Maria had been so busy shopping for food and cooking dinner that she had had no time to wash or change and was still wearing her dirty jeans and tee-shirt when Bill returned.&nbsp; He quickly put her under and told her that what she really wanted was for him and Erika to have a lovely dinner together and get to know each other and that she would serve them in the dining room and just have a quick sandwich by herself in the kitchen.&nbsp; He also told her to change out of her dirty clothes and to wear Erika&#8217;s maid&#8217;s uniform while she was serving dinner.&nbsp; 

A few minutes later, Maria decided that she would give Bill and Erika a lovely dinner together and that she would stay out of their way so that they could get to know each other.&nbsp; Suddenly she realised that she should change out of her dirty jeans and wear something sensible while doing the serving and the washing up.&nbsp; 

�Please, Erika,� she asked,&nbsp; �Would it be okay with you if I borrowed your work outfit while I get dinner ready for you?�&nbsp; 

Erika told her that that would be fine.&nbsp; The maid&#8217;s outfit was horrible, Maria thought, as she went up to Erika&#8217;s small bedroom in the attic to get it.&nbsp; It was made from cheap, brown polyester, with knee length skirt and a lumpy sort of jacket.&nbsp; She looked at herself in the mirror and knew that she looked terrible in the awful uniform.&nbsp; Her main thought was that Erika would not find her attractive in it and she miserably blinked away a tear.&nbsp; She decided that she would just get on with the evening and ensure that it was a success for Erika and Bill.

Maria was so nervous about doing everything perfectly that evening that at one point she spilled some wine while pouring it out for Bill to taste but apart from that she did a good job as cook and waitress and stayed out of the dining room except when she was needed to serve and clear away plates.&nbsp; At the end, she brought in some port and brandy and asked if everything had been okay.

�Thank you, Maria,� said Erika, �You did so well.&nbsp; That was a beautiful meal.&nbsp; You can go now.�&nbsp; 

Maria blushed at the compliment and felt her cunt getting wet from the knowledge that she had made Erika happy.&nbsp; She went back to the kitchen and finished the dishes and then, exhausted went to bed, where she fingered herself until she came, thinking all the time of Erika.

Bill and Erika sat long over the port and coffee which Maria had left, and got on very well.&nbsp; There was a strong mutual attraction between them and, after a while, Erika was emboldened to ask Bill a question which had been concerning her for a few days. 

�Bill,� she said, �Maria is really helpful to me but sometimes I wonder whether she might be bi-sexual.&nbsp; Sometimes I think that she fancies me.�&nbsp; 

Bill agreed that he had wondered the same thing about his wife and told Erika that she was to deal with Maria as firmly as she wished and to let him know if she had any problems with her behaviour. 

�You poor man,� said Erika sympathetically, �It must be so difficult for you having a wife who maybe does not love you.&nbsp; It is such a pity that things are not different because you are so lovely.�&nbsp; 

She gently stroked Bill&#8217;s hand and, later, as they said good night, they embraced tightly and kissed each other for a few minutes.

In the morning, Erika was a bit tired from the night before, so Maria suggested that she go back to bed while she herself made breakfast.&nbsp; Bill again put Maria under and told her that she would be sexually aroused by being given orders by Erika and that the more humiliating the instruction the more aroused she would be.&nbsp; He also told her that she was to make herself attractive and available to Erika.&nbsp; Then he went off to work.

When Erika came down, she was looking stunning.&nbsp; She had spent an hour or two doing her hair, nails and make up, and was wearing a beautiful short dress in which looked both sexy and classy.&nbsp; Maria had spent the morning hovering and was again wearing an old pair of jeans and a worn-out, ripped tee-shirt.&nbsp; Knowing how busy she would be to get the house looking nice for Erika, she had not had put on any make up apart from some quickly-applied lipstick.&nbsp; But Maria still wanted to look good for Erika, so she was wearing her tightest jeans and her tee-shirt was too small.&nbsp; She had great tits and decided that Erika would notice them more if she did not wear a bra.&nbsp; In her tight tee-shirt, her breasts were indeed very noticeable and her nipples were all too obviously aroused and protruding through the thin cotton when she said good morning to Erika and brought her coffee.&nbsp; 

�You look so lovely today, Erika,� Maria said, �And you must tell me what I can do to make you happy.&nbsp; I would do anything to make you happy.�&nbsp; 

�Anything?� asked Erika, smiling.&nbsp; �Okay, I think that you want me.&nbsp; Is that right?�

�Oh God,� replied Maria, �I want you so much.&nbsp; I think about you all the time, I dream about you, I love you so much.&nbsp; You are so beautiful.�

�So you are a lesbian,� said Erika.&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t like lesbians.&nbsp; I think that you are not a nice girl.&nbsp; What would your nice husband say if he knew?�

Maria flushed with humiliation that her secret was out and could only stammer again how all that she wanted was to make Erika happy.&nbsp; The odd thing about her humiliation was that it seemed to be arousing her.&nbsp; She could feel her cunt getting wet and her nipples were rock hard and protruding half an inch through her tee-shirt.&nbsp; Then she started to cry and apologised to Erika for what she had said.

�It is not so bad,� said Erika, �Stop crying like a silly little girl or I will give you something to cry about.&nbsp; You know you are not so young &#8211; 32 is really old, isn&#8217;t it?&nbsp; I bet that you wish that you could be young and look like me?&nbsp; You know, I think that your husband really wants me as well.&nbsp; He does not want you because you are a bad-tempered cow.&nbsp; As well as being really old.&nbsp; Also you are really stupid.&nbsp; I get so bored listening to you.&nbsp; From now on, you will only speak to me when you are spoken to.&nbsp; Do you understand?�

Maria nodded miserably and said nothing.

�I will tell you what, though,� said Erika.&nbsp; �I have not had any sex since I came here, so maybe you can be useful, even though you are a stupid, lesbian slut. Okay, tell me what you are?�

�I am a stupid, lesbian slut,� said Maria, hoping slavishly for approval from the object of her adoration, and getting even wetter.

�Okay,� said Erika, �As a special treat for you, you can lick me, but I want you to do it properly.�

Erika lay back on the sofa and spread her legs.&nbsp; Maria could not believe how lucky she was, and gently stroked Erika&#8217;s legs before unzipping her skirt and going down on her.&nbsp; She had never before tongued a woman but somehow it felt wonderful to be doing this for Erika.&nbsp; She followed Erika&#8217;s instructions and after half an hour had made her come twice.&nbsp; Maria herself was overcome with lust throughout.&nbsp; At the end of it, Erika lay on the sofa looking contented and Maria was happier than she had ever been.&nbsp; She started to rub her own crotch through her jeans which were now visibly wet.

�Who said that you could do that?� said Erika sharply.&nbsp; �Your job is to make me happy, not to waste time on yourself.&nbsp; God, you are so stupid and lazy.&nbsp; There are lots of things to do.&nbsp; You can go out now and do the food shopping.&nbsp; But don&#8217;t take the car because I need that myself to go out and have lunch.&nbsp; Anyway, the exercise will do you good. I think that it will be best if you do not come, ever, unless I give you permission, otherwise you will waste all your time. Have you anything to say?�

�Please�, whimpered Maria, �I need to come so much.&nbsp; I love you.&nbsp; It will only take me a minute to come.&nbsp; I am begging you.&nbsp; And can I get changed before I go out shopping &#8211; I can&#8217;t go out dressed like this and with wet jeans.�

�Okay,� said Erika, �Because I am feeling nice, you can make yourself come, but first I want you to go down on your knees and beg me properly.&nbsp; You must call me Mistress when we are alone together, of course, and you can call yourself Slut.&nbsp; But you have no time to change your clothes.&nbsp; I am amazed that even a stupid, lesbian slut like you should even suggest such a thing.&nbsp; In future, you will have no more ideas.&nbsp; You are not clever enough to think of any ideas.&nbsp; It is better for you that you just do what you are told.&nbsp; That will make you happier than trying to think of things for yourself.�

Maria felt a surge of happiness run through her.&nbsp; She got down on her knees and pitifully begged her mistress for permission to come, which Erika gave contemptuously.&nbsp; Still kneeling, Maria then frantically rubbed her clit through the crotch of her jeans and climaxed within a few seconds.&nbsp; It was the best orgasm that she had ever had and she was still trembling as she walked down the drive to the shops.

It was a thirty minute walk to the shops and on the way there, and back, laden with heavy shopping bags, Maria was conscious that her wet jeans and smudged lipstick were drawing stares of surprise and contempt.&nbsp; The awful thing was that this just made her feel even wetter and hornier, and she wandered around the shops in a daydream, thinking of Erika and how much she loved her.&nbsp; She did not even object when one of the young shop assistants patted her bottom and was pathetically grateful for the attention, because she knew that she was old and ugly and stupid.&nbsp; How could she expect someone as young and beautiful as Erika to want her?&nbsp; 

Later that day, Erika was watching TV and Maria was polishing the woodwork when Erika told Maria to come and kneel in front of her.

�Yes, mistress,� said Maria, her eyes glinting with pleasure at this attention.

�You know,� said Erika, �It is not so cheap living in this country.&nbsp; It is much more expensive than Hungary and I cannot live on my wages from you.&nbsp; It is important that we change this.&nbsp; I think that it will be best if you transfer all your money into my account and I will look after it for you.&nbsp; That will stop you wasting money on stupid things.&nbsp; Also, I want you to cut up all your credit cards.&nbsp; In future, I will give you an allowance and look after your needs.�

Maria agreed with her mistress that this would be the right thing to do.&nbsp; A few minutes on the PC was enough to transfer all her savings to her mistress.&nbsp; Then she cut up her credit cards and put them in the bin.&nbsp; She felt so happy knowing that her mistress would look after her and do what was best with her money.

When Maria had done this, Erika told her to kneel down in front of her again.

�That is a nice ring you have,� said Erika.&nbsp; �No, not that one, you stupid slut,� she added as Maria touched her wedding ring.&nbsp; �I mean the other one, but give them both to me anyway.�

Maria silently pulled off both her gold wedding ring and also her engagement ring, which was platinum with big diamonds, and handed them to Maria.

�I think that these will get dirty when you are working,� said Erika.&nbsp; �It is better if I look after them.�

Then Erika put the rings in her bag.

That evening, Maria again made and served dinner to Erika and Bill, again dressed in the horrible polyester maid&#8217;s uniform, and again had a sandwich by herself in the kitchen.&nbsp; When she had been told that she could go she went to bed and tried to make herself come.&nbsp; To her frustration she found that she could not bring herself to a climax and it was only after what seemed like hours that she remembered what Erika had said about being unable to come without permission.&nbsp; Miserably, she cried herself to sleep.

Downstairs, Bill and Erika were lying entwined together on the sofa.&nbsp; After a while, Erika unzipped Bill&#8217;s trousers and gave him the most incredible blowjob.&nbsp; While Bill was still gasping, Erika told him that she had something important to say.

�You know, I have spoken to Maria.&nbsp; She is a lesbian and she has given me these rings.&nbsp; She says that they are not so important to her.&nbsp; This one I think is not so nice.�

Saying this, Erika dropped the wedding ring in the wastepaper basket.

�But I like this other one.&nbsp; Will you give it to me?�

When Bill nodded, Erika smiled and put the diamond engagement ring on her finger, admiring the way that it shone in the dim light of the sitting room.

�Now,� she said, �That is good and you have made me feel so special.�

Erika skilfully played with Bill&#8217;s cock until he was hard again and this time she let him fuck her.

A routine was established in the morning whereby Erika slept in until 11 am and Maria got up at 5 am to make breakfast and do the housework.&nbsp; There was so much to do, and Maria was pathetically happy if anything she did was praised by Erika; thrown into despondency if anything was criticised.&nbsp; If Maria was especially diligent, Erika would sometimes allow her to beg to lick her cunt, and sometimes actually allowed her to do so.&nbsp; These were the most wonderful moments of Maria&#8217;s life.&nbsp; But although she was constantly aroused and horny, her mistress had not yet allowed her to come again herself.&nbsp; So Maria went about her work in a constant state of frustration and near climax, her cunt dripping and her nipples hard, yet unable to get any relief.

One morning, Erika was reading the newspaper and called Maria over to her.

�Kneel down, slut,� said Erika, and Maria did so.

�What do you think of that look?� asked Erika, showing a photo in the paper to Maria.

It was a photo of Jessica Simpson, looking remarkably slutty and stupid in cut-off jeans and a cheap shirt.

�I don&#8217;t know, mistress,� said Maria, �You always look so special.&nbsp; Are you sure that you really want to look like that?�

�It is not a look for me, you idiot,� said Erika, not unkindly, �It is a look for you, I think.�

Maria was so overcome with gratitude to her mistress for taking this interest in her appearance that she whimpered with pleasure.

�Please,� she said, �Your slut wants to look like that if that will please you.�

Later that morning, Erika allowed Maria to make herself come while watching a music video of Jessica Simpson, telling her that it was important to try and model her appearance on that of the airhead actress.

That afternoon, Erika took Maria shopping.&nbsp; Erika told Maria that it would not be right to waste much money on her, so they went to cheap shops used mainly by teenagers.&nbsp; Maria cringed in embarrassment in these places.&nbsp; She was 32, and all the other customers looked about 17.&nbsp; But they found the clothes that Erika had in mind and she bought the tight tops, cut-off jeans, cheap high-heeled shoes, and cheap, showy costume jewellery which would complete the look, as well as some cheap but flashy make up and perfume.

Erika told Maria to put on one especially slutty looking outfit, and then took her to a hairdressers.&nbsp; Erika explained to the assistant what was needed while Maria meekly sat there in silence.&nbsp; When Erika returned to collect Maria there had been an impressive transformation.&nbsp; Maria now had blonde hair, but it was a blonde colour of trashy obviousness, which anyone could tell was a dye job, and it was styled as a teenager would wear it.&nbsp; Maria had also had additional piercings made in her ears &#8211; she could now wear three earrings in each ear, and Erika told her to do so.&nbsp; On the way back, Maria was getting stares from people but she did not care.&nbsp; She was starting to look the way that her mistress wanted her to look and she had a warm glow inside in looking more like a cheap, teenage slut that a 32 year old.
