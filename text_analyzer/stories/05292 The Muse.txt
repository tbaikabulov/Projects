The Muse

By Darqside

&nbsp;

Perhaps it can be said that the pen is mightier than the
sword, but the way I see it, the pen is also mightier than the man or woman.

&nbsp;

It all started at the local arts and supply store I go to a
few blocks down the street from where I live.

&nbsp;

It was a rather unusual shop, full of things you wouldn�t
normally find in an art store, fortune telling baubles, dice, board games,
magic trick supplies, Halloween decorations, you name it, really�but the sign
outside still insisted upon calling itself Art and Supply Depot.

&nbsp;

I�m not what you�d call an orthodox writer; I�m very old
fashioned in my sense of taste when it comes to writing.� So when it came time to purchase more paper
and a new set of pens for writing I decided I would get a very traditional set
of pens and even special ink just for my work.�


&nbsp;

Now I know what you�re thinking, in the age of computers it
makes no sense to write on paper.� Well
at some point in my life I took calligraphy, so in some ways my writing is also
a form of artwork to me.� Of course I do
use the computer now and again.

&nbsp;

That day was different however, it was special to me, mainly
because I had just recently moved into a new apartment nearby and was itching
to get started writing out my new story.�
It would be a passionate love story about the most beautiful woman
ever�or so I had in mind.� I just knew I
had to write with a traditional ink pen.

&nbsp;

When I walked into the store for the first time, I was
amazed at all the unique things they had in the store, a bronze statue of a
dragon, various glass sculpted brush holders, a life-like mannequin, and some
of the most unique quality of paper I had ever seen�probably finer than rice
paper or papyrus!� The owner and keeper
of the shop was an elderly woman who seemed to have her eye on me the moment I
walked in the door.

&nbsp;

I took a few rolls of the very interesting paper and then
walked up to the front counter for my purchase.

&nbsp;

�Ah, I see you take a fancy to my enchanted paper.� She
smiled gently.

&nbsp;

�Yes, it�s very nice; I hope to use it to write an epic
story!� I beamed.

&nbsp;

�What would that story be about, young man?� she queried
with somewhat of a sly look on her face, although she was very modest about it.

&nbsp;

�It�s about this man who falls in love with the most
beautiful woman completely by accident, and she becomes obsessed with him.� It basically is their life story.� I haven�t decided on the details yet.�

&nbsp;

�Hmm,� she put a thoughtful finger to her chin, �perhaps it
would be wise to pick the perfect pen for such a story, would it not?� She
smiled.

&nbsp;

�Well, yes, but I wouldn�t know where to begin, there are
just so many fine ink pens in this shop.�
I was kind of hoping you could help me.�

&nbsp;

�Well if the story is about love�then I think I have the
perfect pen for you, just a moment.�

&nbsp;

She went into the back storeroom and hummed what sounded
like an ancient Japanese Lullaby although I couldn�t make out the tune it
sounded very beautiful.

&nbsp;

�Ah!� Here it is!� she
said at last.

&nbsp;

When she came back to the counter, she produced a wooden box
with a special golden hasp lock on it that slid open.

&nbsp;

Opening up the box I found what appeared to be a metal pen
shaft attached to a semi-long bamboo stalk.�
The stalk was painted a deep crimson in color and the shaft was also
very unique, as well as sharp for small point markings.

&nbsp;

�This pen is called the �Fude no ai� or Pen of Love.�
It is a special pen that only true lovers can wield.� As you can see, the blade of the pen has a
heart shape engraved upon its tip, so that the ink will always flow through the
heart of the pen.�

&nbsp;

�Wow, it�s very elegant.�

&nbsp;

�I shall warn you however, this pen has been passed down
through many generations of my family and many a maiden�s blood has flowed
through its shaft.�

&nbsp;

�Maiden�s blood?� Are
you serious?� I was a little shocked actually.

&nbsp;

�Legend has it that the bamboo shaft of this pen is stained
in the virgin blood of the most beautiful of maidens and should they prick
their finger upon the blade of the pen, they will fall eternally in love with
the man who writes with it.� The blood
flows through the shaft and onto the paper, making the heart of the man and
woman bond forever, just as ink bonds to paper.�

&nbsp;

�I�I�m somewhat curious as to why you would suggest I use
this pen.� I have to admit, I am a little superstitious about such things.

&nbsp;

�Because, you are a man who needs love in his life.� I have seen it.� This pen will make it happen.�

&nbsp;

�Er�um�� I gulped.� I wasn�t about to stab the next pretty girl I
walked past with it, that�s for sure.�
�I�I�m sure it�ll inspire me.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, most certainly!� she bowed as I gave her my money.� Strangely enough when I produced the money to
purchase the pen, she refused.

&nbsp;

�I told you, this pen is for you.� A good pen and a good writer need each other,
just as a good man and a good woman need one another.� This pen chose you.�

&nbsp;

�If you say so�� I sighed, gave my thanks and left.

&nbsp;

I wasn�t too far from my house when I saw a young woman
unloading a set of boxes next door to my apartment complex.� She seemed to be straining heavily against
the large boxes, so I decided to stop and help.

&nbsp;

�You could use some help moving in I take it?� I offered.

&nbsp;

�Wow, you�re a real life saver.� She said looking up.

&nbsp;

The woman was a bombshell in every classic sense of the
word, a very busty redhead with long curls that came down along the base of her
back and extremely curvaceous hips.� She
was wearing a very light dress that didn�t seem appropriate for moving but most
certainly accommodated the two large D-cup breasts she had.

&nbsp;

I set my parcels down on the sidewalk nearby and began
helping her with her boxes.� They weren�t
all that heavy, but she didn�t seem to be the type of girl where heavy lifting
was her specialty either.� Humorously I
considered the idea that she did plenty of heavy lifting already just by walking,
of course I never told her that.

&nbsp;

When all her boxes were neatly placed in her house, she
offered me a soda from the fridge.� I
accepted and brought my parcel in her house.

&nbsp;

�You really helped me out back there, and I really
appreciate it.� I just moved in and I
really don�t know anyone around here.�

&nbsp;

�Well you do now.� I smiled, �My name is Rodger Hollings and
I live next door.�

&nbsp;

�Well Roger,� she said, in a mock-toast with her can of
soda, �Here�s to you and your neighborly hospitality.�

&nbsp;

�Cheers,� I said with a smirk.

&nbsp;

�I suppose I should introduce myself,� she replied, �I�m
Rachel Mooring.� Seeing as I just moved
in, there isn�t much to tell about me, except that maybe I�m trying to find
someone important I can live the rest of my life with someday.�

&nbsp;

�I suppose in many ways I am also looking for that certain
special someone.� I said somberly, �Another toast,� I said, �to Love and the
possibilities it brings.�

&nbsp;

�Here-here.� She toasted back, and then laughed.

&nbsp;

�What�s so funny?� I asked with a smile.

&nbsp;

�Just that I can�t believe on the first day I move in and
some interesting guy is already in my life.�
How�d that happen so fast?�

&nbsp;

�I don�t know, how did it happen so fast?�

&nbsp;

�Don�t take this the wrong way, but I�m not such a
nymphomaniac that I�d do the first man I�ve seen after just moving in.�

&nbsp;

�You most certainly have your dignity to consider.� I said
with a smile.

&nbsp;

�Most certainly,� she teased.

&nbsp;

�Well, I know when I�ve worn out my welcome; I�ll leave you
to unpacking your things then, neighbor.�
I�ll see you later then.� With a wave I left, taking my parcel with me.

&nbsp;

She was a very interesting woman, the kind of woman I felt
somewhat attracted to, and very classy.�
I liked that.

&nbsp;

It was getting late, so I decided to set my package on the
table and go to bed.

&nbsp;

The next morning I woke with a start as the doorbell was
ringing.� Running downstairs I ran to get
the door.� Rachel was standing there,
with a somewhat embarrassed look on her face.

&nbsp;

�You forgot your pen.� She said, somewhat peeved, �You left
it on my table before you left.�

&nbsp;

�Oops.� I said abashedly, �I didn�t mean to forget it.� I guess I must have dropped it when carrying
my paper rolls.�

&nbsp;

�It�s okay, but wow that thing is sharp!� she showed me her
index finger was bandaged.

&nbsp;

�You cut yourself?� I asked.

&nbsp;

�I was curious, that pen looks so elegant I had to check it
out, it�s the real deal alright.� You
must really love writing.�

&nbsp;

�I really do.� I said, �And I really don�t know what I
would�ve done without that pen, thanks a bunch.�

&nbsp;

�No problem, we�re neighbors.� She smiled.� �Well, I have to go, got to finish settling
in.�

&nbsp;

It never occurred to me until after she left that she
pricked her finger on the pen, just as the old woman had said might happen.

&nbsp;

I shook my head in disbelief, �What is it gonna do, turn her
into sleeping beauty?�

&nbsp;

Well, I thought, I might as well try it out.

&nbsp;

I took my new pen in its box and the large rolls of paper I
had bought and brought them upstairs to my specially designed spool.� Taking the tube of the spool out, I put the
first roll over the spool and tore a sheet of the fine quality paper out.

&nbsp;

Taking my new pen out of its wooden case and a bottle of
India ink I set them side by side on my desk nearby.� I decided before I was going to start writing
I would first take a good look at my pen, to make sure everything was in good
condition.

&nbsp;

It was strange at first, as the underside of the pen seemed
to have a large old clot of red ink underneath, it certainly smelled of
ink.� Well the old woman did say it had
been passed from generation to generation.�
I just couldn�t believe that anyone in their right minds would write a
story in blood for ink. 

&nbsp;

Dipping the edge of the pen into the Inkwell I began writing
out my story.� 

&nbsp;

It started out simple: a young man at the prime of his life
trying to make it in the big city.� But
as he finally finds work at a local bar, he comes across the most beautiful
woman.� She apparently serves as a
waitress there while he�s on bartender shift.�
He starts out simply admiring her looks as she�s quite attractive.� But then they begin to talk and grow to be
very fond of one another.� Her name is
Jessica and his is James and the two begin to fall madly in love.� But there�s just one problem.

&nbsp;

�Oh darn it!� I wracked my brains out just thinking up the
premise of the story, but I never thought of a plot device.� And now I had a severe case of writers block!

&nbsp;

I decided to tear off a small sheet of paper from the roll
and write out a list of plot devices I could use:

&nbsp;

The man�s already married�nah over done.� The woman�s married�seen that too many times
on soaps.� The guy�s gay?� Forget that.�
The girl�s a nymphomaniac?� That
might work.

&nbsp;

�Lessee here�� I muttered, writing out a list of
�nymphomaniac� ideas.

&nbsp;

BDSM� too broad and too clich�, needs to be more
specific.� Into latex?� Maybe.�
Likes hot weird sex and likes the whole slave/master thing?� That could work.� Breath play?�
Nah, gasmasks hide a girl�s face, not something I want a reader to
picture�bed bondage?� Too complex I
think.� A girl so addicted to rubber she
wants to become it?� Ooh that sounds
hot�but it needs something�something�special.

&nbsp;

I took a nearby Skin Two catalogue and paged through
it.� I scanned through a number of
tantalizing models with the most bizarre of fashions.� Of the many pictures I came across, none more
appealed to me than the rubber ballerina girl and the latex gothic bride.� Next to the picture I read an article review
of an online internet website called Gromet�s Plaza
which featured several fiction stories of women and men in the most interesting
situations of bondage and fetish clothing.�
It made me curious, so I fired up the computer and entered the web
address.� Sure enough the 18+ or older
question came up and I happily clicked ENTER.

&nbsp;

Now, I don�t normally look at other people�s writing for
inspiration, but in the case of this fiction, I just had to.� It just seemed to titillating to pass
up�emphasis on tit�heh.

&nbsp;

My libido kicked into overdrive as I read the stories found
on the website.� Numerous works, both sexually
arousing and downright bizarre filled my eyes.�
Of course, I wasn�t about to simply write your everyday porno
fanfiction.� I was writing an epic here,
and looking for inspiration.� I came
across the story by an unknown author named Layered Text by the title of
�Eternal Latex Virgin� that sparked a peculiarly sadistic spark in my
imagination.

&nbsp;

The story itself seemed like something out of Silence of the
Lambs, but also appeared to be extremely provocative.� The title alone made me ponder the magnitude of
such a situation for a beautiful woman to be bound in eternal latex
virginity.� Of course, there was a
problem with that.

&nbsp;

I hate body piercing, just a pet peeve of mine really.� It detracts from the body as a work of art as
far as I�m concerned.� This was, of
course, the means through which the author of that inspiring story came up with
the woman in question�s eternal virginity.�
But I wasn�t about to do something like that.� I wanted something darker, perhaps more
fantastic although not as sadistic.

&nbsp;

An eternal latex virgin in every sense of the word, meaning
her virginity would be based on latex and defined by it.� The very essence of the hymen being bound in
her rubber sex member.

&nbsp;

The ideas began to trickle at first, and then to flow.

&nbsp;

The woman in my story, Jessica, had an obsessive adoration
for all clothing made of rubber, PVC, and latex.� The very smell of the stuff would arouse
her.� And James, well, he was a simple man
with even simpler tastes.

&nbsp;

As the ideas began to form in my mind, I felt a hint of
fatigue as my mind began to wander from the events of the day.� I was getting tired and distracted.� So I decided I was going to go for a walk.

&nbsp;

Placing my new ink pen in a special drying quill, I capped
the bottle of ink, grabbed my house keys and took a stroll down to the park.

&nbsp;

There was some daylight out left, and plenty of people were
out going for strolls or shopping now, so I had plenty of time to go for a
stroll and head back before dark.

&nbsp;

The cool afternoon air was soothing and felt really nice on
my back.� I stretched my legs a bit and
was about to head back when I heard a familiar voice call behind me.

&nbsp;

�Roger!� Fancy meeting
you here!� How�s the writing coming
along?�

&nbsp;

�Oh, Rachel, it�s you�� I said, rather surprised to find her
here.� She seemed taller somehow I�d
noticed, but couldn�t figure out what it was.

&nbsp;

�I just got back from a strange little store downtown, they
sell the most peculiar outfits, and I just had to get a little something.�

&nbsp;

�You bought something?�
But you don�t look like you�re carrying anything besides your purse.� I
commented.

&nbsp;

�I�m wearing them; silly�you really need to be more
observant of girls� looks you know.�� She
smiled.� She tilted her legs and pulled
up her dress a bit to reveal the sexiest pair of heels I had ever seen.

&nbsp;

�They�re ballet boot heels, for some reason I got them on
discount and they fit me perfectly!� she had the brightest smile on her face,
as though she adored the boots from the moment she saw them.

&nbsp;

�Don�t they hurt?� I asked, knowing all too well that most
women can barely walk in them, let alone stand on full weight with them on, let
alone walk a few blocks in them, at least, not without extensive training, but
near as I could tell, she had only just began wearing them today, and she
walked in them naturally and gracefully.

&nbsp;

�You would think they�d hurt, but the moment I put them on
and stood up in them, it just felt natural, like my feet were designed
specifically for these boots.� All the
girls at the shop said I was crazy for wearing these things without some foot
training, but they feel so comfortable to me, almost like I never want to take
them off!�

&nbsp;

To prove her point, she did a fake pirouette and kicked one
of her legs high in the air.� Her dark
skirt flared a bit as she did so, revealing the sexiest pair of red panties I�d
ever glanced at.� The color was a deep
red that matched her hair.

&nbsp;

�So what do you think?� she giggled, �I don�t think I�ve
ever had this much poise and confidence before in my life�and I feel sexy.� Her
eyes looked into mine deeply.� It was
such an incredible moment.

&nbsp;

�Er�um��

&nbsp;

She laughed, �I can tell you�re speechless, Roger, it�s nice
to know you like how I look�someone has to appreciate my hard effort at looking
beautiful.�� With that she strolled in
long pin-point strides toward her house, leaving me, dumbfounded.

&nbsp;

She might as well have knocked me over with her radiance, as
I was left standing there for a few minutes just wondering how I knew such an
attractive young woman.� The ballet boot
heels were especially sensually pleasing to me, that much I knew for certain.

&nbsp;

Shaking my head of all the lecherous thoughts I kept having,
I decided to head back to do some more writing.�
Just this encounter alone might influence my epic love story a bit, or
so I thought.

&nbsp;

I came back to my desk, paper, and ink pen.� I grasped the red handle in inspired
anticipation, all too eager to write, but noticed something.

&nbsp;

Was it just me?� Or
was the handle of the bamboo shaft of the pen a deeper shade of red?� I must�ve been seeing things.

&nbsp;

Taking ink to pen and pen to paper I picked up where I left
off.

&nbsp;

James most certainly was a man of simple tastes, but he
wasn�t about to inhibit himself on the most beautiful woman he�d ever met,
despite her addictions and vices.� She
was a woman of great passion, and her sexual desire deepened with every meeting
she had with James, whether it be while working at the bar, or simply
encountering him on the street.� Whenever
her eyes met his, she had determined she would belong to him and only him, and become
his love slave by any means necessary.

&nbsp;

Of course, James was what you�d call a sensible man and had
no knowledge of things involving sex bondage, fetishes, or the like.� He was simply a man who believed in love and
its powerful grip.

&nbsp;

One day in particular Jessica�s desire for him got the
better of her, and she decided she could take it no longer.� Waiting quietly for him to leave the bar, she
followed him home secretly stalking him.

&nbsp;

It wasn�t the first time she�d followed him home, and on
numerous occasions she�d learned that he secretly hid an extra key to his
apartment underneath a panel in his mailbox just in case he got locked out.

&nbsp;

Gently sneaking in, she quietly snuck into his bathroom and
shut the door.� She had brought a duffel
bag of all the things she planned to wear for her first �serious� encounter
with him.� Stuffing the cracks in the
door so as not to let any light through and reveal herself to him while he
slept, she turned on the light.

&nbsp;

Taking off her waitress uniform, she then proceeded to put
on the most luscious single-piece red rubber skirt on.� It fit so tight against her body and shined
in the bathroom light.� It was tight
around her breasts but had a thin layer of latex over the top that revealed the
shape of her cleavage perfectly.� She
then slipped on a special pair of red rubber ballet boot heels to match her
dress as well as deep red opera gloves, both of which matched her deep maroon
hair.

&nbsp;

Taking out a two-piece rubber mask and then proceeding to
twist her hair into a tight ponytail at the top, she squeezed the tail through
the top of the lacing and tightened the rubber mask around her face.� To add to her appearance, she undid her long
red hair�s tie so that it fell naturally along the contours of her head as
though the mask were a part of her face.�
She added a special latex lipstick compound to her lips so that they
were shiny and rubbery in texture like the rest of her body now was.

&nbsp;

To finish this ensemble off, she undid a special zipper at
her crotch that opened up a special round hole just over her vulva.� The dress remained taught around the curves
of her body while the opening gave just enough leeway for her to be seriously
fucked.� At this point she didn�t care if
she got pregnant, as this man was only for her and she was his sex toy, now and
forever�he just didn�t know it yet.

&nbsp;

James at the time was asleep, and while he slept, she
quietly crept up into his bed, gently sliding underneath the covers and taking
off his underwear.� It was all she could
do not to go crazy with lust over his member.�
He continued to sleep and she began to stroke and lick him.

&nbsp;

It didn�t take much for James to be aroused, but he
certainly was a deep sleeper.� She
stroked him till he came in big gobs which she greedily drank down her sexy throat.� She felt herself about ready to cum but
restrained herself�she would save that for her master�someday, when he was
ready.

&nbsp;

The next morning James awoke with a strange sensation.� He felt like he�d been fucked raw in his
sleep!� But there were no signs of anyone
in the room.� He threw back the covers to
find--!

&nbsp;

Nothing.� Not a trace
of anyone besides himself in the room.�
He checked his underwear, most definitely on and most definitely dry�so
no wet dream to speak of.� Yet his penis
felt like it had gone through a vacuum cleaner and looked a deeper pink as a
result.� Despite the sensitive feelings
he had, he actually felt pretty good, like his life was somehow fulfilled.

&nbsp;

He strolled into the bathroom to find nothing unusual in
particular.� It did smell of talcum
powder in there though�he wasn�t sure but maybe the talcum fell in the night
due to something.

&nbsp;

No, that wasn�t it; the talcum was shut safely away in the
bathroom cabinet.� So why did he have
this distinct feeling someone was there and someone was watching him.� He decided to take his mind off it by
brushing his teeth.

&nbsp;

I decided it was time to take a break.� Any long story needs a break now and again,
and now seemed like a good time to do so.�
I walked over to the kitchen for a soda and poured myself a glass.� It felt cool down my throat as my thoughts
began to reform for the next leg of my story.

&nbsp;

Does she continue to secretly have her way with him?� Will he find out?� Will he reject her desire because of how she
goes about doing this to him?� What about
that Latex Virgin idea I was working with?�
How would I put that in my story?�
I just wasn�t sure.

&nbsp;

I was jerked from my thoughts when I heard a loud thump
outside my apartment in the hallway.�
What was going on out there?� Were
they Burglars? Maybe neighbors coming in late?

&nbsp;

Walking up to my apartment doorway I peeped out through the
peephole.� Nothing unusual seemed to be
out in the hallway�just a dimly lit hall.�
That is until a dark shape moved out of the corner of my vision through
the peephole.

&nbsp;

I could hear a series of thumps run down the hallway and fade
down the steps.� Maybe it was a burglar,
but something or someone must have spooked them, so I thought.� I didn�t dare go out to see who it might�ve
been�mostly out of the idea that I just didn�t want to get involved or as I
convinced myself, that it was just some homeless person looking for a place to
sleep.� As a safety precaution I made
sure the door was locked before I went to sleep.

&nbsp;

The next morning I stretched and found I hadn�t slept that
well in ages.� I felt rejuvenated
somehow, as though some sort of miracle had happened in the night.� Going into the bathroom I took a look in the
mirror to clean up.

&nbsp;

�What the--?� I gasped in surprise and shock.

&nbsp;

The wrinkles under my eyes were gone!� The rings that proved my lack of sleep in
college also appeared to be disappearing.�
My skin appeared younger and fuller in tone�I just couldn�t explain it.

&nbsp;

My tongue was pink and my eyes were blue, and my hair was
the same color it always was.� I was
just�younger.� It was an incredible
feeling really.� I felt like I should go
for another long walk again, the fresh morning air seemed so inviting!

&nbsp;

The park was definitely brighter to me than usual, fresher,
and full of life, or was it just me?� I
chuckled at the thought.

&nbsp;

�We really have to stop meeting like this�� a familiar yet
sexy laugh rang in my ears.

&nbsp;

It was Rachel again, as bright and as chipper as ever.� Her hips were curvaceous and more pronounced
than ever, and due to the ballet boots her breasts jutted forward in the most
perfect slope.� But even more than that,
she was wearing something different from yesterday.

&nbsp;

Instead of the very reserved black nylon skirt she wore
yesterday, she was now sporting a tight black rubber hobble skirt with mermaid
skirt flairs about the sides, her black ballet heels accommodating her rolling
hips nicely.� Her long red hair swept
down towards the lower portions of her back while her midsection was encased in
a deep crimson corset.� This was
complimented by black opera gloves with red gloved hands.� The dress itself lipped tightly up to her
neck in a single piece of non-existent seams of latex.

&nbsp;

Once again I was smitten by her beauty and lustful eyes.

&nbsp;

�I�I�� I couldn�t say anything�anything at all.

&nbsp;

�You want me don�t you�� she said, her red voluptuous lips
invading my mind.

&nbsp;

�Well�that is�� I fumbled�she was just too hot for my voice
to describe.

&nbsp;

�It just so happens I want you, Roger Hollings.� She said in
a deep sexy voice.� Taking me by the hand
she whispered in my ear.

&nbsp;

�Let�s go to my place.�

&nbsp;

My eyes went wide in shock to hear her say this�it just
didn�t seem like her.� It was uncanny�and
the idea she seemed to know exactly what I wanted?� Inconceivable!

&nbsp;

We walked back to the apartments she and I lived in, me
mesmerized by her rolling hips all the while.�
She glanced back in my direction while tossing her deep red hair to the
side in sexy fashion.

&nbsp;

�You like the way I look?� she asked me.

&nbsp;

�I do!� I do!� I just
couldn�t help myself�I may as well have been drooling at that point, but I just
didn�t care.

&nbsp;

She opened up the door and strode in her ballet point heels
through her apartment.� I followed
somewhat timidly but at the same time equally horny and eager.

&nbsp;

�Ever since I met you when I moved in, I�ve had this feeling
that you and I would be together�but I never though I would become this�� she
said as she moaned in her rubber dress.�
She stroked her body up and down with her fingers, feeling every sensual
shape and taking them into herself like some kind of hungry animal.

&nbsp;

�Everything seems to make sense when I�m around you�like
you�re killing me softly with some kind of poetry or song.� And my body is becoming more than I can
handle�like I�m going to overflow.�� From
the looks of things she was about to have an orgasm.

&nbsp;

�I�I want you too, Rachel�� I gulped, this didn�t seem like
something I was prepared for�and most definitely something I hadn�t expected.

&nbsp;

She took a gloved hand to my face and stroked it sensually.

&nbsp;

�Sex me, Roger.� She said with fierce abandon.

&nbsp;

Before I knew it we were in her bedroom�but the bed sheets
were made of rubber!� It was a strange
sensation really.

&nbsp;

She leaned back in that tight hobble dress of hers and began
to slowly stretch her legs apart.� They
stretched and stretched ever so slowly.�
The Dress seemed to be incredibly flexible at this point as it opened
wide while still keeping her legs in a sharp 90 degree angle.� By now I was able to get a good look at her.

&nbsp;

The ballet boots were something I had never seen before�they
were fully attached to the rubber fabric that ran up her legs and past her
crotch under the dress, almost like the legs were molded to the boots and her
own body.

&nbsp;

At the center of her crotch was a single zipper�she kissed
her fingers and grasped the zipper�s hasp and slowly unzipped her crotch.

&nbsp;

The crotch area seemed to be wrapped so tight around her
vulva that the pressure of the rubber of her split legs seemed to be pulling
the vagina�s lips apart as she unzipped it.�
By the time it was fully unzipped, the vulva�s lips spread wide and
virtually popped out of the hole it was inside previously.

&nbsp;

�Oh god�fuck me, Roger!� she begged.

&nbsp;

A realization hit me�she wanted me to have open unprotected
sex with her�something was wrong.

&nbsp;

�No rubber?� I asked.

&nbsp;

�Unh�.no�just do it�before I go mad.� I want to become rubber�for you, Roger�� her
voice was more pleading than ever.

&nbsp;

Maybe a part of me was still a coward, but I didn�t want to
take any chances�I undressed and placed my cock inside of her as she writhed in
happiness�sweat dripping in rivulets across her forehead.� I managed to pull myself out in time for the
big cum�but before I could release elsewhere, she greedily bit hard around my
scrotum.

&nbsp;

�Huh?� I jumped�a little nervous that she�d clamped on me so
easily.� She quickly and languidly sucked
my penis dry of all cum it had released, as though she didn�t want to spill a
single drop of that precious fluid.

&nbsp;

�I told you�� she said between heavy breaths, �I want to
become your rubber, Roger�I�ll be your condom from now on�your condom slut.�� It was then I noticed something I hadn�t
realized before�

&nbsp;

Her lips and inside of her mouth seemed to be coated with a
red rubber substance; even her tongue had an abnormal sheen to it.� I watched as her lips began to stretch and
wrap tightly over my cock like a sheath of their own accord�swallowing my
testicles whole.

&nbsp;

Her eyes glared like fire into mine as she greedily sucked
at my genitals�stroking and licking them with her rubber tongue.� I could feel saliva coating over them, but it
felt like warm liquid latex was being drenched over them.

&nbsp;

In fear and shock I pulled myself out from her lips with a
wet pop.� She looked at me pleadingly
wanting more of me inside of her.� She
started to beg for more.

&nbsp;

�Please Roger�you have to let me take you inside me�I won�t
be complete otherwise.�

&nbsp;

It was then I noticed that her teeth and jaw line were
beginning to fade and stretch.� I watched
in horror as her teeth and gums dissolved into big rubber lips�her rubber
tongue disappeared into the crevice of her mouth which formed a long shaft
rubber tube as her lips formed an O.

&nbsp;

Her mouth closed for a moment, just like her regular
lips�but reopened even further, begging to capture me in her maw.� She reached out to me with a rubber hand at
which I withdrew.

&nbsp;

She then sat down on the bed, downcast, with sad green eyes
that wanted to cry but could not�for they had hardened into a painted rubber
form.

&nbsp;

Surprisingly she was able to speak through that large tube
of a mouth of hers.

&nbsp;

�Why are you doing this?�
You wanted me to be like this, didn�t you?�

&nbsp;

�I�I don�t know what I want!� I yelled.

&nbsp;

I ran as fast as I could back to my house�back to where
things made sense.

&nbsp;

I stood in my room, suddenly transfixed by something I
hadn�t expected to see.� The red bamboo
pen I had been given for my writing was glowing!� It was glowing a deep red crimson and
appeared to be pulsing with life!� My
eyes fixated on the mysterious pen as it pulsed its strange light.� It was then I noticed the writing I had
written on paper was also glowing.� It
bore a strange crimson hew�like some sort of life energy had been imbued inside
of it.

&nbsp;

My memories of the day I had purchased the pen �Fude no ai� all came flooding
back to me.� The legend�the story of
maidens whose blood was bound to the stroke of the pen�it had all come to
life.� The woman known as Rachel Mooring
had now become the subject of my writing, as her blood was now bound to the
strokes of my pen.

&nbsp;

My mind was bombarded with thoughts that boiled to the
surface or broiled to nothing.� I simply
sat and watched the pen pulse with its ever brilliant life as the letters
written in Rachel�s blood beat a slow heartbeat.

&nbsp;

A knock came to my door.�
I was afraid to answer it�but did so anyway.

&nbsp;

It was Rachel�but she did not look at me.� Her rubber painted eyes were downcast and her
O shaped lips were pursed shut with sadness.

&nbsp;

�Please�� she asked me, �Please let me be your rubber slut.�

&nbsp;

My face must�ve been red with anger because her face
somewhat shuddered as I glanced upwards at her.

&nbsp;

I took her hand ever so gently and led her to my room.

&nbsp;

�This is your life.� I said, sadly.

&nbsp;

I proceeded to tell her of the legend I�d heard so much
about, and how she had incidentally pricked her finger on the enchanted pen and
thus began to become something beyond reality�beyond reason.

&nbsp;

Rachel took the facts well, considering her situation.� At first she appeared to be sad, but then in
a brief moment she was bright and happy once again.

&nbsp;

�I don�t understand�?� I asked.

&nbsp;

�I never thought my life would be like this, but I seem to
have become your muse.� To become
anything you write about�make it real�and make it inspire you to do even
greater things.�

&nbsp;

�You really are amazing, Rachel�� I marveled.

&nbsp;

�You really think so?� she said, with a satisfied smile on
her face.

&nbsp;

�I was afraid at first�I was afraid something was happening
that I had no control over�that I might lose you because you were
changing.� It�s why I ran away�I didn�t
know what was going on.�

&nbsp;

She gently walked up to the pen and paper, read the text I
had written, all the ideas I had written down on the side, and then proceeded
to write her own entry.

&nbsp;

Jessica was heartbroken that she wasn�t able to confess her
love to James the way she planned.� She
had secretly sucked him off, but that was about all she had managed to get away
with.� It was her great wish to always be
with him, despite his fears and despite any insecurities he might have.

&nbsp;

She decided she was going to confess her love to him that
very afternoon.� Normally he would be
working behind the bar, but that day he seemed to have taken the day off.� This might have thrown a wrench in any other
woman�s plans, but not Jessica.� She knew
exactly where he would be as he had a habit of hanging out in the same spots
whenever he was lonely or whenever he felt he needed some down time.

&nbsp;

Jessica finally encountered James on a nearby park bench,
who, despite being what appeared to be a poor excuse for sexual arousal, had
been sulking.

&nbsp;

Jessica decided she was going to meet up with him in her
Waitress Uniform�but she threw in something special�something he would have to
discover for himself.

&nbsp;

�Jessica?� James finally looked up and saw her glancing at
him inquisitively.� �Why are you here?�

&nbsp;

�I came to tell you I�m sorry.� She said, �I�m sorry I never
told you how I feel and who I really am�and because of that I�m going to tell
you now.�

&nbsp;

�You mean�?� he glanced up at her.

&nbsp;

�First and foremost I love you, James, you�ve been my
inspiration and guidance for as long as I�ve known you.� Second, I love rubber just as much as you�and
even if it�s not something you�re into very much, I still want to be with you.� I just wish I could be your rubber girl.�

&nbsp;

She kicked up her heels a bit to reveal her ballet boots
that she strolled in so naturally.� Her
hips rolled close to his face and she tenderly kissed while making her deepest
wish.

&nbsp;

Just as she had made her wish, a shooting star passed
overhead, confirming it.� And as the two
gazed at one another in love and contentment, Jessica�s body began to glow a
deep red.

&nbsp;

�What�s going on?� James yelped in bewilderment.

&nbsp;

�I�m becoming�rubber!� Jessica moaned as a powerful wave of
lust washed over her.

&nbsp;

In a flash her entire body underneath the waitress uniform
was encased in a ruby red rubber skin.�
Her breasts were pert and solid and her hips were as wide and shiny as
ever.� Her lips were a deep crimson that
matched her rubber face perfectly.� Her
long hair was also a deep stretchy rubber texture�making her extremely
beautiful.

&nbsp;

In a moment of quick thinking, she stripped herself of her
waitress uniform to find that her body was now a thick stretchy rubber, even
her nibbles had a bounciness to them.�
The tall ballet heel boots had fused with her feet and now her toes
glowed a deep shiny red in the sunset.�
Her pussy was now open wide and fused in a free O shape so that she no
longer had to worry about opening up the lips just to get sexed.� Her rubber skin felt so sensitive to the
touch she felt her breasts were about to explode.

&nbsp;

As she continued to feel herself her body stiffened
somewhat, as though it was now becoming firm and toned, not to mention even
more sensitive.� Her fingers felt as
sensitive as the tips of her breasts had been�even the toes in her heels, it
felt like an orgasm every time she took a step.

&nbsp;

James was now supremely surprised by this change that had
transformed her�a miracle by some means he thought.� But no explanation was needed�he was, after
all, a simple man with simple tastes�and he knew she would taste good.

&nbsp;

On a whim, James grabbed Jessica�s rubber hand and led her
through the park back to the bar.� She
was of course completely naked, but her red rubber skin and heels accommodated
her perfectly.� She was now an exhibitionist,
and she adored it!

&nbsp;

When Jessica entered the room, covered in latex, she got
quite a large amount of stares, but these turned to cheers as she took a pool
stick nearby and stood on top of the bar and began to bend and flex herself
around the stick wildly as money was thrown her way.

&nbsp;

By the end of the night, she had at least 5000 dollars, and
in a kind gesture, gave the owner at least 2000 of the cut.� The owner was both dumbfounded and sexually
excited by her performance, not to mention eagerly staring at the money.

&nbsp;

�You two go home, you deserve the rest of the night off.�
The owner smiled to Jessica and James.

&nbsp;

Before leaving, James was pulled aside by the bar owner,
�You keep her and never let her go, understand.� He smiled.

&nbsp;

�Yes sir!� James beamed.

&nbsp;

That night they experience the grandest sex they had ever
experienced, and, strange as it may sound, each and every time James entered
into Jessica, a wet popping sound could be heard.

&nbsp;

He looked inside her vulva to find that the hymen�a ruby red
rubber was quickly reforming itself every time he penetrated her being.� She was becoming a virgin!� Just this excitement alone was beyond his
reckoning to handle.� He would pound her
with his hips and then wait with baited breath as the red tissue reformed
itself.

&nbsp;

That night they began to play games to see what things they
could do with this new discovery.� James
on a whim decided to stick his hand inside her reforming hymen.� He could feel the rubber skin tighten and
wrap itself tight around his wrist.� He
waited for a few moments for the tissue to settle and proceeded to push and pull
with his wrist, stretching the hymen enough so as not to break it, but enough
so that Jessica could feel every push and pull from it.

&nbsp;

She was rocked with an orgasm as the substance inside her
stretched and pulled like rubber taffy.�
She confessed to him she loved this sensation and begged him to try and
stretch her hymen as much as possible.�
It caused no pain apparently, and so he was able pull the hymen out of
her vulva as far as 2 inches.� He rolled
his hand as it stretched and twisted the rubber flesh around it, and then in a
moment of lust and satisfaction, pulled the hymen out with a wet pop with his
wrist, effectively penetrating her from the inside-out.

&nbsp;

She screamed with delight as he continued to toy with her
stretchable insides.� At one point he
only let the hymen grow around his ten fingers and let them wriggle and squirm
in tingly bits around her ever growing flesh.

&nbsp;

She had now become his eternal latex virgin, and she was
also his rubber slut, now and forever.�
She felt both trapped and released now�as she was now with the man she
loved.

&nbsp;

But of course, their story was only just beginning.

&nbsp;

By the time Rachel put the enchanted pen down; the
transformation to her body was complete.

&nbsp;

She had in fact become exactly like the woman in the story,
replete with regenerating hymen.� She
squealed with delight as she played with her body just as if it was a sex toy.

&nbsp;

�Are you satisfied with how your life has become?� I asked,
somewhat reserved and somber.� I wanted
to play with her just as much as she did, but I wanted to also know if what we
were doing was right.

&nbsp;

�You miss the point entirely,� she smiled, and with a wet
pop penetrated her innards.� �I�m your
muse now�I can become anything you want me to be�just write it down and I�ll
become your everything now!�

&nbsp;

�If you�re my muse�� I said to her, �Then you�re going to
have to be something special to me!�

&nbsp;

�Oh really?� Rachel grinned, her wet pussy growing wetter by
the second.

&nbsp;

I ran with gusto over to the glowing red pen and began
scribbling something at the end of that story.

&nbsp;

James was now extremely happy with Jessica, but his dream
was still out there, and their wishes still needed to come true, even though
most of them had come true.� They still
had a big life ahead of them.

&nbsp;

Glancing out in the night sky, James made a wish of his own.

&nbsp;

�I wish Jessica was my Muse and my Angel, to fly with me
wherever the wind and sky take us!�

&nbsp;

Incidentally yet another shooting star came by the confirm
it, and soon enough Jessica had a pair of crimson rubber wings with which to
fly with�and fly they did, across the night sky of the city, across the bright
lights and brilliant evening moon�off to their dreams and inspirations.

&nbsp;

�Well�it�s not quite a love epic�� I muttered.

&nbsp;

Rachel replied with red wings wide open in the night air,
�The story doesn�t have to be an epic for the love to be of epic
proportions�let�s go Lover!�

&nbsp;

I don�t recall ever being any happier than with my
muse.� And she�s always here to inspire
me.� She can be anything I want her to be
and all I have to do is write it down.�
She is the things I create, and she becomes a part of what I write�as
well as a part of me.

&nbsp;

Maybe someday you�ll find your muse and be happy�just as I
did.

&nbsp;

The End?
