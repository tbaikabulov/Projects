The Witch�s Curse                                                                                                               1

     Cassy  McSmith sat quietly on the front porch swing, as the wind blew softly onto her 

rosy-red cheeks.  The sun felt crisp against her skin, as it brought out the  pigments of her 

fair, milky-white complexion.  Cassy was a young, beautiful, teenage girl, of 17 years of 

age.  

     Through out her childhood, she had had a lot of up�s and down�s, but this was by-far; 

the worst, she thought, as she swung, while rain-droplets  began to drizzle off from the 

roof top above.

     Cassy�s younger brother, Chad, strolled merrily outside and instantly hopped beside of 

Cassy, on the porch swing.  Chad, only being the small and tender age of 6, said, �I love 

to play in the rain!�  �Don�t you?� 

     Smiling, Cassy commented, �Sure.�  �But I�m going to get out of this small town, 

someday!�  �You and me, both!�  Giggling, Chad replied, �How come?�

     Cassy just laughed out loud, as she noticed Chad jumping into a mud puddle.  �Chad, 

you know that I will turn 18 next week, right?� �When I do, I�m leaving!� �Do ya want to 

come with me?�  

     Curious, Chad said, �Why, where ya going, Cassy?�  Glancing back at Chad, Cassy 

said, �I�m going to run-away, to somewhere far, far away from this pitiful thing we call a 

home.� 

     Chad and Cassy had been orphans since Chad was only about 6 months of age.  For 

many years, their foster parents wanted desperately to conceive an infant, but they 

The Witch�s Curse                                                                                                               2

couldn�t produce at all, any blood children of their own. 

     So, when they heard about Chad, which was in an orphanage; they were ecstatic.  The 

foster parents took over Chad and Cassy, the only thing was; that they only had their eyes 

on Chad, not Cassy!  Cassy just came along with the package, whether they wanted her, 

or not!  The orphanage would not allow separations between siblings.  

     Shutting her eyes, Cassy remembered the trauma she had endured and witnessed, when 

she was Chad�s age.  The terrifying accident involving her parents, the night of the train 

wreck.

     Tonight, was the night, from 12 years ago; when the horrible nightmare had actually 

came to pass and came true.  Every year; once a year, the horrid ordeal haunted her.

     Cassy, Chad, and their parents were on their way, traveling in a Amtrak train.  

Vacationing to London, for a family get-away trip.  Without any kind of warning, 

suddenly, the Amtrak train�s brakes skidded and squealed, as sparks of fire flew from 

underneath the train tracks rails.

     Maybe it was some sort-of flook or horrid coincidence, but the Amtrak train, 

somehow, collided with another locomotive passing in the opposite direction!  More than 

120  passengers died instantly in the crash; that night around 6:00 p.m., including her 

parents.  Only a handful of people survived, with minimum cuts and bruises.  Chad and 

Cassy were two of them, among the few surviving parties.

     Sometimes fate steps in and takes a long, twisted turn, Cassy thought, as the rain
The Witch�s Curse                                                                                                               3

began to pour and pound heavily against the gravel, narrow driveway.  

     Chad never knew his parents, or at the least; didn�t really recall them in any of the 

slightest details.  But his foster parents spoiled him, terribly, which was no big surprise; 

since he came to them when he was only a mere baby.

     Chad�s shaggy, bright orange hair became drenched, as he skipped over mud puddles 

and stuck out his tongue to catch a taste of the raindrops, that oozed down his throat.  

Nightfall was approaching, while Cassy swung on the swing to watch her little brother 

play in the rain.

     Cassy and Chad�s foster parents, The Brown�s; treated Chad really well, in fact, they 

 loved him as one of their own, Cassy, on the other hand; was mistreated something 

awful!  The Brown�s never really wanted her or for that matter, didn�t even deserve her,  

especially since they already had another daughter, by the name of Destiny!       

     Mr. and Mrs. Brown adopted Destiny when she was only a little tike of 2 years old.  

Now days, Destiny was a young adult, at the age of 19, and certainly, full of herself!  She 

still lived with them and gave a new meaning to the word spoilt, with a capitol �S�!  

     Destiny was striking to look at, with long, flowing lockets of golden blonde hair.  She 

was their little angel, and she could do no-wrong, in their eyes!  Destiny was completely 

wicked  and down-right naughty, just like her foster parents.  Sometimes Cassy wondered 

if Destiny was some kind of blood relation to her foster parents!

     Cassy returned from her thoughts, when Chad said, �Yes, I�ll go!�  Snickering, Cassy 
The Witch�s Curse                                                                                                               4

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
replied, �Great, we will leave this time, next week!�  �Ok?�  Smiling, Chad said, �Oky-

Doky.�  

     And with that, Cassy and Chad began holding hands and planning for the �Big� run-

away.  Cassy figured she would be officially an adult next week, and she was determined 

to find a way to support her brother and herself, one way or the other.

     Just then, Mrs. Brown stormed outside onto the front porch, scooped Chad up into her 

arms and cuddled him.  Without warning, she screamed at Cassy, �Dinner is ready, go 

serve my family, now!�  Cassy�s smile emerged into a saddened frown and then said,  

�After next week, I won�t be anyone�s maid-servant!� Cassy replied. 

     With an arnery look of hatred in her devilish eyes, Mrs. Brown snarled, �Oh yes you 

will!�  �You will, or I will take a switch and beat the living day-lights out of you, until 

your vanes pop-out and pour blood!�  �You  know your place, and  will continue to be our 

slave for as long as Mr. Brown and I wish.�  �Does that compute?�  she snapped.  

     Drooping her head  down towards the floor, Cassy said, �Yes, mamm.�  Whispering to 

herself, at least she treats my brother good, that�s the only  thing good about the Brown�s, 

she thought.  

     �After you eat; wash the dishes, clean the toilet, and mop the floors, and then when 

you�re done; you can go straight to bed!�  Mrs. Brown reminded her of her nightly chores.        

     Mrs. And Mr. Brown, and Destiny sat on their lazy tumps in their comfy chairs, with 

their eyes glued to the television.  As Cassy served dinner, Mr. Brown stuck his smelly, 
The Witch�s Curse                                                                                                               5

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
encrusted foot in Cassy�s face.  �Here, massage my foot before you go get me another 

beverage!� he snickered.  As Cassy began rubbing Mr. Brown�s foot, Destiny threw a 

glass of milk at Cassy. The glass cracked, as it hit Cassy�s forehead, and blood quickly 

streamed down onto Cassy�s freckles. Destiny, and Mrs. and Mr. Brown began to burst 

out into hysteric laughter, at poor Cassy�s expense! Chad had already eaten and was 

nestled in his bed.  �Thank goodness!�, Cassy thought.

     A seconds later, Cassy raced to the bathroom and saw blood oozing from her head.  

Suddenly, tears flooded her face. She cried, as she splashed water on her face, then, Cassy 

began her task of on-going chores, for she knew Mrs. Brown would be on her case if she 

didn�t do them.

     After finishing the other chores, she began mopping the floor.  Cassy appeared  

amazingly stunning, even dressed  in her old, tathered and torn flower dress and bare 

feet.  Her long, silky bright-red hair, flung past her buttocks, as she mopped up the 

bathroom floor.  Cassy had a youthful, but sexy look about her.

     The Brown�s gave Cassy a roof over her head, a small portion of food daily, and a 

place to lay her weary head, but that was all they gave her!  There was no love, no 

compassion, nor were there security or comfort!  The only thing that kept her alive and 

her heart pumping, was her younger brother.  Her parents were gone, she knew nothing of 

any other living relative.  The only one she cared for, was Chad. 

     Chad was all she had left, now!  But she was obviously grateful to have him!  After 
The Witch�s Curse                                                                                                               6

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
finishing up all of her chores, she went down stairs, and entered the basement.  This is 

where the Brown�s made her sleep.  

     Jumping onto the cot, she was exhausted and soon started to doze off.  Shortly 

afterwards, she began to dream about a handsome prince, who came and took her and 

Chad away, to a far away place, and lived happily ever after.

    At the same time Cassy slept in California;  London, England was 

waking up with the morning sun.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Two years earlier���.
 
 In another country, on a small island, off from the English Channel, at one time, lived a 

Prince. The real-life, handsome prince was  debonair and desirable.  The prince would 

soon be air to the throne in the coming year, as his father, the King, would retire, shortly.  

     Prince Eric was a dashing, and daring sight.  He knew that he was good-looking and 

pleasing to the eyes.  This made him extremely conceded, inconsiderate, and arrogant, 

without a doubt.

     Having all the traits: fame, fortune, gorgeous, and all of the above.  All of the women 

in the land, fell for him and flocked to him. They catered to all his needs and wants.  

     Eric was born  into royalty and was raised up to know of only high social traits of 

the finer things in life.  Being of noble and royal blood, Eric was quite a sight for sore 

eyes, as all the fair ladies in the land would try to win him over, mostly; just interested in 

his air to the family fortunes.  But a few women actually fell for him strictly because of 

his enticing good looks and his incredibly sense of witty charm.
     
     It was hard to resist him, as he gazed into their eyes with his big brown, teddy-brown 

eyes and his  cute baby-face features, and of course; everyone stopped to catch a glimce  

of  his little,  tight, perfectly-round butt-cheeks when he started to strut his stuff.  Even 

some of the gentlemen stopped in their tracks to stare at Eric, which made him nauseous 

in the pit of his stomach.

     He never knew poverty.  The year before last, Eric turned 20 years old.  This year,  
The Witch�s Curse                                                                                                               8

he was 22,  after  having an extravagate Birthday Ball in his honor; he snuck out to 

celebrate for an exciting night on the town, disguised as a guard.  

     As he had done, for months now.  Passing the guards, crawling over the galvanized,  

Imperial, 10 foot tall gates, slipping away into the night, leaving no trace. He was free to 

explore, for the night, anyway.

     He had little time for himself,  always in the public eye and looking over his shoulders.  

Eric also had no private life, and longed for a  normal life of partying, laughter, 

adventure, and absolutely no royal engagements to attend to.  Often, someone would 

catch him out in his nightlife outside the palace gates and as usual, he would  have to 

tend to  some kind of embarrassing after effects.  The outcome was never pretty!  

The King and Queen, his parents; would comment that he was disgracing them and 

would remind him several times, of his noble duties of being the royal prince of the 

English Channels.  Eric despised the word, �Responsibilities�, which he often heard, come 

out of his father and mother�s lips, frequently.  He loved being a prince, but at times, it 

could be rather unbearable and a royal  pain in the butt, most of the time.

     Eric was thankful if he didn�t get caught while sneaking past the guards or being 

actually lucky that no-one spotted him in town, who knew who he was!  God forbid, if the 

tabloids noticed him, for he would certainly be dead, end of story!  

     Although  loving and embracing the nightlife,  Eric never really found true-love, or for 

that matter; probably really never knew what real love was, or even felt like.
The Witch�s Curse                                                                                                               9

&nbsp;
     He just went out with a few women, every couple of weeks and bought them 

expensive jewelry, wined and dined them, and bought them plenty of drinks.  Every so 

often, the ladies he met were exotic and he actually presumed to get the ladies plastered 

off of their feet and quickly wasted no time, to take advantage of them, literally!  It was 

an awful thing to do, he thought, at times, but  most of the women he came in 

contact with, did him the same way, too.  

    Most of the ladies just dated him for his money, which was sad.  The fair ladies who 

knew him as Prince Eric Nottingworth, became infatuated with him, not letting him 

alone, and he became disgusted at the mere sight of them fawning over him.  

     Eric had on a fake, black beard and mustache attached to his face and wore dark-green 

colored contacts to hide his true identity.  Although, his eyes were actually a deep, hazel-

nut brown, he worn many different disguises so none of his lady friends could know his 

true identity.

     Eric looked sexy, as he waltzed into his normal, usual dance club, wearing an over-

sized beige trench coach, to match his silky, colored sandy-blonde hair.  As he walked 

through the door, the heavy-metal rock music played, as the disco strobe lights from 

above; swayed fast among the crowd.  While the colorful lights and loud music filled 

the room, the club was hopping.  The small tavern club was not known to many through 

out the land, but plenty of faces through out all walks of life, seemed to flock to this fast 

paced club.
The Witch�s Curse                                                                                                             10

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
     Sitting at the bar, a dark-haired, �strange�  women, glanced in the direction of Eric.  

Smiling, she motioned him to come and have a seat beside of her.  Grinning and flashing 

his perfectly, pearly-white teeth, quickly; he strolled over and joined her.  Giggling, she 

said,  �Do you come here a lot?�  

     �Yes, I sure do!�  �Do you?�  �I haven�t seen you around here before?�  he said, 

smiling.   �Actually, I�ve never been here before, this is my first time.� she giggled again.  

�What�s your name, by the way?�  she asked casually.  She was taken in by his boyish, 

good-looks and emaculate charm.  He appeared enticing to her, like a domestic cat about 

to attack cat-nip.  

     �Eric.�  �May I ask yours?�  he replied.   �Just call me Erika!�  she smirked.  �Are you 

serious?�  he said, looking puzzled.   �Yes.�  she returned.  �That is ironic that our names 

are so similar, don�t you think?�  he said, peering amazed at the thought.

     �Just a big coincidence, I guess.�  �We�ve only been talking for a few minutes and 

already, we have something in common, our names!� she said, as she giggled again.  

Erika was kind of cute, in her own way; with a deep-dark olive complexion, having 

bright, green eyes; almost neon.  Her eyes were strange and unusual, as they seemed to be 

glowing!   �How weird�, he thought, as he stared into her eyes.  Erika wore rich-red lips, 

the color of blood, but was cute and somewhat pretty; in an odd sort of way.  She looked 

demonic, dressed in black, gothic clothing, from head to toe.  Eric knew she was 

different, some how.  He felt something weird, odd, and peculiar about her, deep-down in 
The Witch�s Curse                                                                                                             11

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
the pit of his stomach, but he couldn�t figure out why?  She was obviously different, but 

also, extremely nice, as well as fun to talk to.  Eric enjoyed her company, as she did his.  

�Can I buy you a drink or two?�  he asked.  �Sure.� she said, �Two bloody-marry�s with a 

twist of lemon, please.�  she snapped her fingers at the waiter behind the counter.

     The time passed by quick, and they forgot the hours they had left behind, as they were

involved in each others company.  After conversing with one-another, Erika invited Eric 

to a night-cap, at her place.  

     �You don�t waste much time, do you.�  Eric said, jokingly.  �Nope, but don�t get the 

wrong idea of me.�  she replied.   �I�m not inviting you in to have a fling, it�s just a few 

innocent drinks, that�s it!�  she said, and then, they both laughed out loud.  �I find you 

very interesting.�  she admitted.  Chuckling, Eric blushed and then said,  �I promise to 

behave and be a good little boy, ok?�  �Alright.� she said, with a grin.  

     Erika found Eric too irresistible, she had talked to him for the past six hours, and felt 

they had connected.   Maybe it was meant to be?  she thought.  Just by watching him 

walk, she felt a sudden urge to rip off his jeans, to see what was underneath; but she 

reframed from saying anything to him.  

     As Eric paid for the round of drinks, he tipped the bartender, handsomely. He thought 

she seemed alittle pushy and forward, which was odd; but he still valued her opinion and 

thought she was wonderful and fun to be around.   

     Eric was used to women coming on to him, but usually not this quick!  �Maybe she is 
The Witch�s Curse                                                                                                             12

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
lonely?   He pondered at the thought, as he walked her to her car door and then 

afterwards, grabbed the passenger seat beside her.

     Speeding off,   minutes later; they drove up to an old mansion not too far from the 

tavern.  As they drove up into the driveway, it was already a quarter past midnight.   Eric 

and Erika pulled up to what looked like a lonely, old, mysterious mansion with four 

pillars, residing along the front of the porch.  �Whose house is this?� Eric said with a 

shaky voice. The mansion appeared abandoned and quite creepy.  �Mine, silly, of 

course!� Erika replied, as she winked at him.

     Climbing rose vines and black-berry bushes covered the outer walls of the two-story 

mansion.  The house seemed dark, dreary and run-down, as if no-one had lived in it years 

ages.  Erika parked the car, when Eric asked, �Do you live here, all alone?�  wondering 

why she would inhabit such an eerie, cold, old house.  �Yep.� she replied.  

     And within minutes, she was at the door and waving to Eric to come inside.  Lightning 

began to strike, suddenly, as rain poured down hard, while the big, iron-cast door 

Slammed from behind him fast.  

     As he entered the doorway, he wondered why he had actually come and what he had 

actually gotten himself into, this time!  This women was nice, but also very strange and 

weird, he thought, as he plopped onto the lazy-boy recliner.   Peering around the corner, 

Eric noticed humungous spider webs hanging from the rafters and about 15 black cats 

were nestled around the fire-place, which was blazing hot from 5 or 6 logs.  Glancing at 
The Witch�s Curse                                                                                                             13

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Erika, Eric commented,  �How did you get the fire-place going so quickly?�  �I didn�t see 

you light it?�  �I don�t know, maybe it�s magic!�  she chuckled with a shrill, hideous 

laugh.  Eric thought,  the whole situation was something out of the ordinary, maybe 

even in the twilight zone!  He was alittle  skiddish, as Erika poured him a drink from her 

licquire cabinet.  �Do you like Early times whiskey?�  she grinned.  �It�s imported from 

the States.�  �Sure.�  Eric replied.  He was somewhat uneasy being in such a strange 

surrounding.

     As they drunk a few shots, Erika and Eric become alittle tipsy and began to get a buzz.  

Peering at his watch, Eric said, �I�d better be getting home soon, I�ve got some important 

meetings in the morning, to attend to.�  

      �Don�t worry, relax, If you get tired you can sleep on the sofa and I�ll take you home 

in a few hours, ok?�  she sounded sincere.  �I guess I can stay, a little while longer.�  Eric 

smiled, as he began to relax.  Staggering over to the small, love seat; Eric pulled off his 

trench coat and took off his beige designer hat.  Erika brought in a bottle of imported 

wine, and soon Eric was intoxicated with drunkenness.  Plastered, Eric soon became tired 

and spratled out on the loveseat, and quickly was passed out, from all the whiskey and 

wine.  

     Erika was so infatuated at the mere sight of Eric and literally wanted to ravage his 

inner being.  She wanted to tear off his clothing, curious to see what lye beneath this 

gorgeous stud.  She was trying to hold back, when she eased her way and sat closely 
The Witch�s Curse                                                                                                             14

beside of him, on the love seat.  He looked like a helpless child, as she drew near.  As she 

stroked his beard, his fake hair fell off and she noticed he had worn some kind of a 

disguise.  She wondered why, as he quickly awoke.  Half asleep and still drunk, Eric and 

Erika looked at each other and then, Eric gave Erika a small peck on the cheek.  A minute 

later, Eric ran his strong but delicate fingers through out Erika�s dark-blackened hair.  

     As he did, he thought, she looked somewhat gothic, to the touch.  Erika just couldn�t 

stand it or control her urges anymore.  Suddenly, she let out a enormous burst of energy 

and pounced upon Eric, like a hungry, savage beast.  

     Eric was somewhat out of it, being drunk from the vast amounts of drinks he had  that 

night, but was still amazed and at aw, with Erika.  With out any warning, she took her 

teeth and ripped the buttons off from his shirt, to reveal a somewhat hairy, muscular 

chest.  With in a millisecond, she stripped nude and had his jeans pulled down and 

unzipped.  He was well equipped, she thought, as she  French-kissed him sloppily on 

the lips.  

     Erika had been extremely lonesome for some time, now; and hadn�t been with a real 

man in over 50 years!   But of course, Eric didn�t know this or have the slightest clue as 

to who she really was.  He was just drunk off his butt, at the time.  She didn�t seem to 

care who he was or if he wanted to, she was hungry for sex and had been lusting after his 

body, ever since she had noticed him in the bar, that night.

     Even though Eric didn�t know her at all, there was one thing he did figure out, she

was obliviously, very lonely!  And he felt sorry for her, somewhat.  Another thing he 

didn�t know, was that Erika was in-fact over 200 years old, which to him, she seemed to 

be in her early 30�s.  If he only knew the truth! 

     As he layed there, he didn�t stop her but he wondered what he had gotten himself into, 

this time!  Erika connected with Eric and had sex, over and over again. It was like, she 

couldn�t get enough of Eric, being inside of her.   Finally, Erika stopped and they were 

both sweating and worn-out, completely.  Both being exhausted from the fast paced 

thrusts of motion.  Lying there and glancing at this unique and very strange lady, Eric felt 

violated, disgusted and kind of dirty.  He had never had sex like that before, and it some 

how, didn�t feel right.

     He realized that Erika had gotten him drunk and had tooken advantage of him.  He felt 

ashamed because that�s what he had often done to women.  Now he knew how they felt.  

He had gotten a taste of his own medicine.  Even so, Eric was not the only one to blame, a 

lot of women used him too, mostly for his money, though.  He sat and pondered, as they 

both drifted off to sleep, until the next morning light.

     Apparrently, I�m not going to make my appointments, he thought to himself, as Erika 

brought him a hot, cup of coffee.  With a bursting, throbbing headache; Eric sat up and 

glanced around but nothing looked familiar.  With a hang-over pounding in his head, it 

didn�t register in his brain until he glanced to look at Erika, holding a cup of tea in her 

hand.  �Good morning, sleepy-head.� �How are you feeling?� She giggled, with wide-

eyes.  �Awful!�  Eric frowned, drowsily.  Handing him his fake beard and faulty contact 

lens, she said, �Why are you wearing these disguises, Eric?�  she snapped.  �Who are you, 

really?�  �After last night, I demand an explanation!�  �Are you running from the law, or 

something?�  She snapped, again.

     �Not exactly!�  Eric said, sadly and then sighed.  �You don�t recognize me?�  he 

asked, curiously.  �No, should I?� she said.  �I guess I don�t get out much, but I do 

deserve an answer.� she repeated again.  �Listen, you don�t know who I am, or what I�m 

capable of and you really don�t want to make me angry, ok!  She warned.

     �Calm down, Erika, I�m Prince Eric Nottingworth, air to the England throne; one day; 

which I dread!�  he confessed, remorsefully.  �The tabloids, press and papporitze would 

have a field day, if they caught me out at a night-club, again!�  he replied.

     �Sometimes, I just want to be normal and of no royal blood or noble birth!� he was 

disgusted at the mere thought of it, because he had no private life, at all!  Erika was 

obviously, over-reacting, she assumed he was hiding something, but she was right.  But 

the truth is out now, even though, he didn�t owe her any explanation. 

     Eric pleaded with her, �Please don�t say anything, pretend that we never met, and you 

and I can go on with our own lives, again, ok?�  he grinned.  �I mean, if the word got out 

that I was sneaking out of the palace gates, drinking wine and parting; well, needless to 

say, my father would never forgive me.�      

�What!�  Erika said, she was furious.  �You mean to tell me, you got me drunk, took

&nbsp;
advantage of me, and you don�t want to see me anymore?�  �Well, I don�t think so, Mr.!�  

�It don�t work that way, you know!�  she yelled.  Apoligetically, Eric said, I�m so sorry, I 

don�t mean to hurt you, we can still be friends, can�t we?�  �I didn�t mean for it to come 

to this, you know what I mean?�  �I think you are a wonderful women and wild in bed, 

what I do remember of it, since I was in-fact drunk.�  Eric commented.  

     �I�ve had other women, but they never complained like you are.�  �Do you want to 

date?�  �We can still see each other, but we have to keep it under wraps, ok?� Eric said, 

being alittle jittery.

     Wrapping his arms around her, he tried to comfort and make her feel better.  As he did 

so, she couldn�t resist him, even if she was enraged for what he said, moments before.  

     �Ok, it�s a date!� she smiled.  �Good, after I get dressed and dignified, you can drop 

me off at the local convenient store on the corner, and I can catch a cab from there.� he 

commented as he grinned.  Eric felt sorry for her and comforted her, but he thought she 

was overbearing, and odd, and also had no respect for herself.  And he wanted to just get 

out of this horrible situation, he had made an awful mistake and longed to leave this 

creepy house and rid himself of her, all together.  (of course, he didn�t tell her that.)

     Showing his pearly-whites, Eric said, �I�m glad you understand.�  �Ok, I guess.�  she 

smirked.  After getting dress, Prince Eric had Erika drop him off, and with in a matter of 

seconds, he was back in the presence of the palace, dressed in his royal attire suite; 

awaiting morning duties.  
The Witch�s Curse                                                                                                             18
     

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
     After dropping Eric off, Erika went shopping at a small grocery store, only a few 

blocks from her home.  As she strolled into the store, she began brouseing for the perfect 

ingridence to brew in her caldron, at home.  She wondered through out the store, and 

suddenly stumbled upon a small tabloid on the front page of a newspaper, sitting on the 

small newstand.

     The headline read in big, bold letters: �Prince Eric�, Quite the ladies man or is he?  

The article caught her attention, so she threw it in her basket, along with the other items.  

Hurrying through the checkout line, she jumped in the car and rushed home.  She began 

to brew up an enormous amount of chicken broth soup, as she become involved at what 

the article had to say.  

     The article had commented that Eric had too much to drink and was seen leaving a 

club with some young, strange woman; last night and disappeared until the next coming 

dawn.  She thought, �the tabloids sure do work fast.�  �Someone must had been spying on 

Prince Eric?�  she said.  As she read the page, Erika knew they were talking about her.  

But who was following them?  she wondered, as she turned to the next page.  Reading 

further into the second page, the passage said, �Just another notch in Eric�s belt!    �It 

went on describing the lady as �the poor sap, taken in and done in by the best of them!�   

Erika began to get ticked off, as she read to find out what Eric was really was, a women-

nizer, plain and simple, as that.  After remembering the aurgument the two of them had 

shared earlier this morning, the paper described Eric to a  �T�!   Frustrated and annoyed, 
The Witch�s Curse                                                                                                             19

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Erika yelled,  �That inconsiderate jerk!�  

     Finally, the article made one more remark, that absolutely drove her over the edge.  It 

went on to comment that Eric was a two-bit, sleaze who used women for his playthings 

and left the women holding the bag and carrying the babies, and  weaseled out of any

responsibilities.  He had supposedly, got two different women pregnant this past year and 

wouldn�t support or own-up to his responsibilities or actions, probably due to not wanting 

to  ruin his �rep�  of being of noble blood.  

     She sat and fuided with herself for inviting him in her home for a night cap and then 

sleeping with him, but he was so irresistible to the naked eye, she just couldn�t help 

herself.  After reading the article, she ate a quick bite of dinner and then decided to dial 

the operator and tried to find the palace�s phone number, but there was nothing listed.  

Even though she had heard the bad reports about Eric,  she knew the tabloids sometimes 

lied and she didn�t want to believe them.  Besides, the fact that she couldn�t control her 

sexual- impulses, she had to have him all to herself, by all means!  

     I guess you could say, she was in-fact; infatuated with him.  After glancing back at the 

article in the paper, she saw in small print the address where the castle resided.  Jumping 

in the car, she decided that she had to see him again, tonight!

     Driving up to the gate, the t.v. intercom came on to say, �Who are you?�  �And what is 

your engagements with the Nottingworth�s?�  She could see the buttler, who was 

speaking on the small, t.v. monitor.  �I�m Erika Crow and I�m looking for Prince Eric!� 
The Witch�s Curse                                                                                                             20

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
she said firmly.  A few minutes later, Eric showed his face on the t.v. intercom monitor, 

as his father, waltzed into the room.  �Who are you talking to, son?�  Alexander, his 

father; said as he looked concerned.  Peering into the camera at Erika, Eric replied; �No-

one, father.�  �I don�t know this women!�  �Go-away, who ever you are!�  Eric yelled 

and then turned off the intercom.  

     Apparrently, that was the wrong words to say to Erika!  Obviously, Eric didn�t know 

what he had gotten himself into, or who he was actually dealing with!  

Erika was steaming hot, as she sped back home and made her way to the front door of her 

home.  She slammed the front door shut and plopped down onto the love seat, where only 

the night before; Eric and her had made love or was it?  

     I guess it was just a one-night stand, she thought.  Suddenly, she glanced over to the 

linen pillow beside of her and noticed a couple of silky, blonde strands of hair, which was 

Eric�s.  Her eyes glowed a bright- florescent green and her body suddenly became 

consumed by blazing fire.  And her true identity formed from beneath the diguise she had 

worn to trick Eric.  Erika�s body transformed into an evil, hideous witch, while her 

fingernails grew longer, instantly.  Erika had been a demonic witch, all along; she just hid 

her true self from Eric,  to intice him into her web of deception.  She had invited him into 

her home, took advantage of him, without his consent, and then was furious when he 

refused her, today.     

    If he hadn�t turned her away, she most likely, would have been kinder.  Erika calmed 
The Witch�s Curse                                                                                                             21

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
down a bit, and the flames that blazed on her body, drendled, not hurting her, one bit.   

Contemplating a plan, she said; �If I can�t have him, no-body will!�   �He�ll never be able 

to use any-one, ever again!� she giggled with a strange, naughty,  high pitched-shrill

voice, that rang out into the air.   Her pet black cats, hissed as Erika snickered with an 

evil, devilish laugh, that frightened them.   Erika formed into a disgusting creature with 

decrepit wrinkles and ugly, hideous  blemishes and worts.  Eric screwed with the wrong 

woman, this time!   

     Erika opened the door to her basement and walked through to a secret, passage door, 

to reveal all of her private stash of potions.  She had wall to wall ingredients, including  

liquids of odd concoctions, like eye of noot, bat wings, spider legs, and even some human 

body parts, preserved in jars. 

     �You will pay, dearly, my darling Eric!� she had a eerie witch�s laugh, as she 

chuckled.   Erika  swore to herself,  as she began ravaging through her potions.
