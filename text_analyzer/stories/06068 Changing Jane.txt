Changing Jane


I: The End Of The Same

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The sun blared light through the small bedroom window. Jane had been woken up this way for the past seven days, ever since she decided to get away from the hustle and bustle of city life for a break, a little time alone to reflect on herself and where she was heading. As the light poured in through the window, Jane rubbed the sleep from her eyes, and roused herself awake. She looked at the small clock on the bedside table and saw small red numbers looking back at her. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"10:28?" she thought to herself as she sat up, still in her nightie. Jane thought of herself as a particularly savvy, modern, organised woman. She had been working for a large computer firm since she left education, back in 2002, and in five rapid years she had climbed the ranks from a postgraduate office girl on a fairly pitiful wage, to manager of a small collection of geeks and nerds, gaining respect from her superiors and those she worked with. Most people who observed her for the first time always thought of Jane as a professional, cold woman with little sense of fun and too much sense of work. Jane was the one always flicking through the ovetime book, increasing the efficiency of her team, impressing her bosses and wearing clean cut, classy suits.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Because of this, Jane had little time for anyone else in her life. Independent, and single since she graduated, Jane had gained the life she had for herself. This often proved difficult when potential relationship situations came by, stayed a short while and left due to Jane missing dinners, anniversaries, family occasions, and many other countless events where the only thing that could fill the void for Jane was work and self-enhancement. On the very rare office party that Jane would go to, her colleagues would often remark on how beautiful she really was; when she made the effort. Standing at 5'5 and about 120 pounds, many of her male colleagues would concur, behind her back of course, that she was "one fine piece of ass" along with other such lewd comments. If Jane happened to interrupt such discussions, often a look from her pretty blue eyes would silence them. These men wanted to fuck her, but they knew of her standing within the company, and most certainly didn't want to get fucked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All of this was far away in the back of Jane's mind now though, since the company had decided she deserved a vacation for her dedication. As she got out of bed, her white nightie hanging down to her shins, she looked around. The small room she was renting contained little but a small bed, a bedside table and a modest wardrobe with broken handles for her to hang her clothes in. As she looked in the mirror on the door, her dark brown hair resting in waves across her shoulders, she realised she should have done this a long time ago.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No suits, no pervs, no rain, no work. Just me, the sun and the trees," she mumbled to herself as she took off her nightie, throwing it to the bed. Her nipples were still stiff from her slumber and she brushed her hands across them gently, the gentle yet pleasurable wave of feeling gone as soon as it came, snapping her hands away.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No time, I must get ready," she said to herself. Jane had a habit of talking to herself. She said it helped her focus on her goals, but in truth it may have had underlying reasons with the fact that not many people talked with her. Most people found her too aloof, and so simply communicated if and when necessary. Yet really she just thought of herself as simply misunderstood.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I know how to have fun when I want to, what do they know?" she justified to herself. "Just because I don't dress up like a slut and get fucked every weekend by a different guy." She put a dark yellow t-shirt over her toned body. There was one other thing Jane enjoyed doing, besides work. She spent a lot of time at the gym. She believed firmly in keeping herself in shape, being healthy, keeping herself strong. And it showed, even underneath her plain unwomanly suits. Under a thin t-shirt, it glowed. Jane put on some panties, threw on some walking trousers, and black socks. None of these were anything special, but it wasn't her attire she was thinking about. Today, she was going to begin her hike. Jane had spent the past seven days travelling around, meeting some new people, generally being lazy and enjoying her time. The island, which was a far cry from the busy city filled with cars, lights and office complexes she came from, had a warm climate which reminded her of a holiday to Australia she went on as a child. But she had decided, after no gym and no work, that she needed some focus and decided to go to a small village in the middle of nowhere, near woodland with miles of forest and countryside. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Plenty of places and plenty of time to walk them in," she said to herself as she left her room and went outside, feeling the warm air breeze through her hair. She always liked to sit on the steps outside before she went about her day, to soak up her surroundings. Today she could only see a few random people dotted about. Talking, doing what needed to be done. This village was very quaint, and small compared even with the places she had previously visited. Jane thought to herself that in a few years, this place would probably be a tourist hotspot, with many opportunities for people to walk out, go hiking, camp, even enjoy the peace. Jane was glad that hadn't happened yet. She liked the peace as it was, she had just done her research thoroughly before choosing. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Definitely a lucky find," she said as she walked back to her room, grabbing her rucksack. She had already packed it for today the previous evening with plenty of water, a spare t-shirt, and a light salad. The day was hot and would be long, she deduced that if all went to plan, she could return by 20:30, just as dusk would begin to set in, and continue her exploration the following day. She put the rucksack straps over her shoulders, and walked out again. As she walked through the village, a tall, well built black man approached her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Hey Jane!" the man exclaimed. He came closer to her and smiled warmly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Hi Calvin!" Jane replied excitedly. He had been the first person Jane had spoken to when she arrived, his warm face had instantly made her feel welcome. They'd had a long conversation the previous evening, about life and their views on a myriad of issues. They had 'clicked.' Jane, for once, actually enjoyed having the company and most certainly intended to spend more time with him. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Off for a walk are you? Lovely day for it," said Calvin.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I sure am, I want to get out and see some of the surroundings here. It's so beautiful here, I'm glad that it's not overrun with tourists," Jane said happily.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I feel much the same, even though I consider you an exception," Calvin grinned. "Would you like some company? I'm not much of a tour guide, but I'd be a friendly person to walk alongside." 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Thanks for the offer Calvin, I'm sorry but not today," Jane said hesitantly. She really liked him. She just wanted a day to herself. "I just want to get a feel for it for myself, but I'll be back this evening, if you like we could have a drink and I could tell you all about the things I've seen. And if you like, you can accompany me tomorrow?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Sure, I understand," said Calvin in a friendly tone. "You'd better get going though, if you want to make a day of it! Knock for me when you return, and we'll catch up."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Absolutely! We'll speak soon!" Jane smiled.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Take care Jane, enjoy your walk," Calvin said warmly, and walked away. Jane smiled to herself. She couldn't remember the last time she had had such rappor with someone, especially a man, and giggled a little to herself. No one ever opened her up in such a way, and she had come all the way here and found exactly that. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Wonderful," she said to herself as she looked behind her to see Calvin taking an axe from the wall and placing a piece of log onto a block, ready to chop it, and grinned. "I'll be seeing you tonight."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As she turned back and walked out of the village, her rucksack clunking on her back, Calvin stared at her from across the village.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What are the chances that I really like someone who came from so far away?" he mused to himself, and in the short few seconds as he pondered and looked back up to see her confident, yet graceful steps and beautifully curved bottom a final time, she had already gone.

II: The Beginning

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jane looked at her watch. It had been three hours or so since she left Calvin back at the village, and she'd covered some ground since then. She'd climbed the top of a hill, and decided to have some water and a little break. As her eyes panned the land below, she could just about see the village in the distance, a tiny dot amongst a scene of green fields, trees and mounds. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Such a beautiful view!" Jane gasped to herself as she sipped from a bottle of water. It really was. The sun was high in the sky, and it beamed down onto the landscape, making everything shine warmly. Jane stood up, brushed the dirt from her bottom, and put on her rucksack. She was enjoying some time to herself, and wanted to travel for more hours yet. As Jane started to walk down the hill, she began daydreaming. She thought about her work, about her tidy, well furnished apartment, and about Calvin. She went over in her mind about his warm, friendly voice. Jane's mind continued to wander as she thought about his face, his body, about how his strong arms could hold her while they spoke that night, and she wouldn't put up any resistance whatsoever. As her mind raced around the thoughts of his kiss, she found herself tumbling to the floor. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Ahh fuck!" Jane exclaimed as she sat up, getting onto her knees. "How did I manage that!" Jane gently stood on one foot, seeing if she had sprained it in the fall, and stood up. As she looked around, she realised that she had no idea where she was. She saw herself surrounded by trees in a small, quiet glade. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"How did I end up here?" Jane wondered cautiously. As she settled herself up and thought about going back home, she heard a rustling noise. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Hello? Is someone there?" Jane shouted into the distance. The noise stopped, and silence responded. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Hmm. Must have been something in the trees. It's about time I walked home." Jane mused to herself. As she turned around and started walking back the way she came, the rustling began once again. Before she had time to turn around, she heard a loud thwapping sound rising above her head, and the last thing she remembered was her face hitting the ground below her.

III: How It Feels To Really Wake Up

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jane awoke with a start. She had been dreaming, one of those strange dreams on the brink of falling asleep or waking up where she found herself falling from a high building, and waking up just before she hit the ground. She sat up, and realised that she didn't recognise her surroundings. The room she found herself in was dark, with dim candles on the floor nearby providing a small amount of light into the room. As she stood up, her hands went to her head. It ached like she had been hit with a sledgehammer, and she stumbled clumsily towards the entrance. As she walked out, she could see a large fire not too far away in the distance. It was surrounded by people, who were cheering at something she could not see. Jane's heart started to race as she worried about what had happened to her. As she cautiously walked towards the fire, she could start to make out who surrounded the fire. Large men, wearing cloth, were staring entranced by the scene before them. Each man had a lead in their hands, and as Jane studied, she could see that each man had a woman at his feet, sitting silently with their heads bowed. They were wearing very little, just enough cloth to cover their breasts and pussies, and as Jane walked closer she could see what the men were cheering. A woman, completely naked, was dancing on the other side of the fire. The men in the front row were hitting her legs, and breasts. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Dance whore!" "Yeah, you belong to us now!" "You dirty slut, show us those tits!" The men were making many such comments, and Jane found herself gasping. The crowd fell silent, and the men turned around to face her. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well it looks like someone's woken up then, doesn't it?" one man jeered at her. As the men grinned and jeered at her loudly, she fainted.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Jane awoke, she found that the sun had risen. She looked down at herself and saw that she was no longer dressed in the clothes that she had been wearing when she had set out the day before. She was wearing a thin piece of white, dirty cloth which covered her private parts, and nothing else. Before she had time to stand up, a man walked in. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Hello. Tell me your name." The man said calmly yet sternly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"My...my name is Jane, why am I here?" Jane said hesitantly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"From now on, you will not be referred to as Jane. You will answer only when addressed, and only to whatever derogatory name we wish to refer to you as. You now belong here, and when the time is right, you will be given to someone who you will belong to from that time onward. But since you're new, you need to learn our ways," the man stated. It sounded as if he had spoken these words many times before. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What are you talking about, I'm leaving! Who the hell do you think you are?!" Jane protested. As she stood up, the man walked towards her swiftly and raised his hand, slapping her square across the face. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Shut up," the man said calmly. "You're not going anywhere but where I tell you. Now, you're going to have to have to wear this, until you've been adapted." The man took her neck in his hand, and put a bold black collar around her neck with a hook attached to it. As he locked it into place, he stepped back and smiled. "Get on your knees."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Fuck you," Jane swore at him. "I'm not doing one damn thing you tell me to do." 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh, I think you'll change your mind soon enough," the man grinned at her. He looked at Jane's legs, smiled, and brought his foot up, kicking the back of her knee and causing her to fall to her knees. He leaned in to her neck and attached a long leather cord to her collar, running his hand down her face. "Now, I've got much to teach you, so follow me. My name is Johnson, but you'll refer to me as Master, or Sir." 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jane kneeled there, dumbfounded. Her mind raced. Where was she? Were they going to kill her? What was going to happen to her? Jane felt a tug at her neck, and the man pulled her along towards the door. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"We're leaving, now," Johnson said, and walked out of the door. "It'll be easier if you just crawl with me, or your pretty face'll end up in the dirt." As he continued walking outside, Jane found herself with little choice but to crawl alongside him in order to not fall down.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Keep up, bitch! I have things to do!" Johnson barked at her as he slapped her backside hard. "Don't make this more difficult for yourself." As she crawled faster, staying at his pace, he led her to the centre where the fire had been lit the night before. As she crawled, she looked around. She could see that she'd been taken to what looked like a tiny community. There were small wooden huts around the area, much like the one she had been in not ten minutes ago. As she looked to her left, she could see another tall, strong man herding something on a lead behind him. As she looked more closely, she could see it was a woman dutifully crawling at his feet. Her head was bowed and her dirty blonde hair led on her shoulders. Her hands and feet were dirty from crawling in the dirt, and Jane realised that she was not the only one. In the distance she could see a couple of other men, with women in tow. As she was taking all this in, not quite believing it, she heard Johnson's voice speaking down to her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Haha, now you're getting an idea of how things work around here, aren't you?" he chuckled at her. "I think you're going to settle in nicely. King! Come over here for a minute will ya?" A man in the distance looked up, and walked over to them. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Hey Johnson, I see the new girl's looking good!" King grinned. He was massively tall, Jane deduced he looked about 6'4, with a bearded face. Jane looked at the figure on the floor across from her, and saw that it was the woman she had seen earlier. She lifted her blonde head from the floor for a second, looked at Jane with piercing green eyes, and looked back to the floor.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Hey what's going on here?" Jane whispered to the girl, before she felt a smack against her ribs.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What did I tell you about not talking unless referred to, hm?" Johnson said to her. "King, this one's certainly got plenty to learn, but I think she'll fit in well here once she's adapted, don't you?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I agree, I think that she'll make her Master very proud once she's learned." King said. He turned down to the girl he had on his lead, and petted her hair gently. "This one's been here three years now, she was so young when she arrived, only nineteen, but she's perfect now." He took what looked like a sweet biscuit into his hand, and held it into his palm, putting it down to the woman at his feet. Jane watched her eagerly jump up to King's hand, and nibble it appreciatively. She looked at the mark on the woman's arm, which looked like a flower with cruedly etched petals. She wondered to herself why the flower only had four petals around it, which made the flower look only a quarter complete. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I see you're admiring Daisy's mark." Johnson grinned. "One of the first things that takes place are the slaves get marked with an empty flower. No petals. This is a sign that they have been newly initiated. As they prove themselves to their Master, He may decide to add more petals to her mark as a sign that she has been a good slave. Daisy has four petals, out of a possible twelve. For the amount of time she's been here, she's done very well for herself. Her Master has given her the name "Daisy" which is used only when He feels necessary. However if He feels she would be better addressed as 'slut' or 'whore' He may do so."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Damn right Johnson. I still think you're too patient with explaining to these little whores what is expected of them," King laughed. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"It must be clear, so that they do not let their Masters down once they have been placed. I doubt They would be very satisfied with my methods of training them if I didn't explain, now would they?" Johnson smiled.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jane's mind raced over the things being said. Didn't they say three years that 'Daisy' had been here? They didn't consider that very long? Are they going to brand me? As the two men conversed, she prayed that she would be safe, and that this was just a bad dream and she'd wake up in Calvin's arms, safe and well. But Calvin was long gone.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Anyway King, I must get going, I have to show this little bitch what's next," Johnson said. "She's got a long day ahead of her." 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I bet she does," King grinned. "Go and give her a pretty flower, see how she likes it." As King walked away, leading Daisy alongside him, Jane wondered what King meant by that. She thought that she probably wasn't going to like it, but could put up little resistance as her tired, aching knees and hands were forced to walk alongside Johnson's steady pace again as he led her inside a dim looking hut. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"And here we are, it's time for your induction." Johnson smiled. Jane's heart pounded inside her chest, and she sighed, waiting for the unknown to surface.
