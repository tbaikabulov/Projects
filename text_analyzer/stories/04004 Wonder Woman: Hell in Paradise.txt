Hell in Paradise

Chapter I

�So, at last we have the fabled champion of Paradise Island, and her sisters,&#8217; came a voice form one of the monitors.&nbsp; All around the hall the invading troops, strongly built men in dark blue uniforms, arms folded across their chests and faces obscured by black masks with eye slits with reflective lenses.&nbsp; All the captured women had seen the fighting prowess of these men, skill and strength to match even the greatest of the Amazons of Themyscria.&nbsp; 

Diana looked up, her voice calm but her eyes shining dangerously.&nbsp; &#8216;Who are you,&#8217; she asked.&nbsp; Her voice was melodious, but with an edge of steel.&nbsp; &#8216;Why have you loosed these creatures upon us.&#8217;

The monitor remained blank, but the voice spoke again.&nbsp; Diana strained futilely to place it through the masking distortion.&nbsp; &#8216;We have released much more than our shock troops, Princess Diana,&#8217; it intoned.

Into the hall strode another group of costumed individuals.&nbsp; They were led by a tall man in black and bronze armour, and a mask that had only one eye-hole.&nbsp; A sword was slung over his back, and a heavy pistol holstered at his hip.&nbsp; Beside him walked another man who was dressed in a simple but well tailored business suit, with dark hair and a well groomed moustache and heard.&nbsp; Under the ordinary clothes his body was clearly hard and powerful, and his brown eyes glinted with a fierce, hungry light. &#8216;Deathstroke the Terminator,&#8217; Donna snarled from her place around the hall, looking at the masked man. &#8216;,and Vandal Savage.&#8217;

&#8216;At your service, Ms Troy,&#8217; nodded Deathstroke.&nbsp; He gestured a gloved hand to those behind himself and Savage.&nbsp; &#8216;You will know my associates from the Fearsome Five, of course, though not all could be present.&nbsp; &#8216;Only Psimon,&#8217; he waved to a tall gaunt figure clad in a simple cloak, with pale mauve skin and beady eyes set in a large hairless head that seemed to pulse slightly; &#8216;Gizmo,&#8217; indicating a short man in a green jumpsuit covered with tools and pouches, a red beard and a hood that come down almost to his yellow goggles; &#8216;and Mammoth,&#8217; he concluded, pointing to a huge man, eight feet tall and seemingly almost as wide, with long red hair and a thick bushy beard.&nbsp; 

&#8216;What is your business here, mercenary,&#8217; Diana said to Deathstroke.

&#8216;Allow me to answer,&#8217; said Savage, stepping forward to within a few feet of the chained Amazon.&nbsp; &#8216;Certain parties have interests in the resources your island provides,&#8217; he said.&nbsp; His voice was cultured, yet somehow every syllable dripped with primitive menace.&nbsp; &#8216;The ones behind those monitors and ourselves have an agreement for sharing those resources.&nbsp; Most especially, your human resources,&#8217; he added with a mirthless grin.

Diana&#8217;s eyes narrowed.&nbsp; &#8216;None of us will cooperate with your plans,&#8217; she said, and she felt waves of encouragement coming to her from her friends around the hall.&nbsp; They were all equally resolved.&nbsp; &#8216;Your time here will be wasted.&#8217;

&#8216;Hardly,&#8217; came the voice from the monitor.&nbsp; &#8216;The cooperation of you and your sisters and associates is not required, in any case, though those wise enough to do so will find the experience a good deal less uncomfortable.&#8217;&nbsp; The other women&#8217;s eyes flared, but Diana remained steely calm.&nbsp; &#8216;You would do well to advise them to make things easy on themselves, Wonder Woman.&#8217;

Diana scanned the hall, seeking the eyes of those other chained with her.&nbsp; In each she saw the same thing.&nbsp; &#8216;I&#8217;m afraid we will have to disappoint you,&#8217; she replied.

&#8216;Not at all,&#8217; the monitor replied.&nbsp; Mammoth and Gizmo chuckled, and Psimon smiled like a ghoul.&nbsp; Savage raised a hand and pressed a finger to a control.&nbsp; Diana felt her bonds unclasp behind her back.

From around the hall the other heroines saw Diana move her hands around the front.&nbsp; Her gleaming silver bracelets had been replaced by the same electronic ones that they all wore.&nbsp; As she brought them forward, Savage spoke softly, so that his words carried only to the Amazon princess.&nbsp; Diana&#8217;s eyes went wider, then her face became stern and grim as the supposedly immortal villain leaned back, smiling at the dark haired woman in front of him.

&#8216;And now,&#8217; the monitor spoke again, &#8216;I believe we would all like a demonstration of Amazon hospitality.&#8217;

Savage smiled even wider.&nbsp; &#8216;Strip, princess,&#8217; he sneered.

Donna and the other captives waited for Diana&#8217;s savage reply and the unleashing of her legendary battle skills.&nbsp; But instead, her sister blinked once, then closed her eyes and reached around for the clasp on her golden belt.

&#8216;Diana, no!&#8217; Donna shouted.&nbsp; Black Canary strained forward as well, calling out, &#8216;Diana, even if they&#8217;re threatening us, you don&#8217;t have to�&#8217; But Diana held up her hand.

&#8216;Donna, Canary, it&#8217;s alright. It is,&#8217; she paused, looking at the men leering at her, &#8216;a small thing, to amuse small minds.&nbsp; Out time will come soon enough.&#8217;

Diana turned back to savage.&nbsp; Every male eye in the room was fixed on the ravishing heroine.

She reached around, and undid the belt from around her slender waist.&nbsp; She held it out to Savage, and he took it, waiting.

Diana kept her eyes on his chest, and put her hands behind her.&nbsp; Deftly she released the catch on her torso armour.&nbsp; It loosened, still clinging to up-curves of the planets most perfect breasts.&nbsp; Diana shrugged her wide shoulders, letting it fall forward away from her.&nbsp; She took it in her hands and passed it to Savage, who stood with the other men gazing at her.

They were treated to a sight such as no man there had ever seen; a flat stomach, taught and toned without being losing any feminine beauty, sculpted as if from smooth alabaster and decorated with a delicate navel.&nbsp; Above her abdomen the princess&#8217; ribs were only just visible by the muscles coating them, and above them, sitting as high and firm as if they e supported by the sexiest bra in the world, two round and exquisite breasts, each a perfect c-cup dome of flesh and tipped with round dark pink nipples the size of quarters.&nbsp; The light gleamed from the smooth curves, and left shadows between the defined cleavage as Diana stood still and said nothing as the invaders of her home ogled her body.

Savage held the armour with mock reverence, staring at the unveiled wonders before him along with the rest.&nbsp; He placed the bodice in one hand, then extended the other, waiting patiently.&nbsp; Several of the men around the wall shifted listlessly, and the members of the fearsome five strained visibly for a better view.

Diana took a steadying breath that made the males watching tremble with lust, and moved her hands to her star-spangled briefs, pushing her thumbs through the sides were they came up sharply over her hips. Bending her knees, she pushed the pants quickly down past her knees, stepping out of them and rising to hand them to Savage.

He took them, then turned his eyes on the back to raven haired woman in front of him, naked now but for her tiara and high red boots.&nbsp; Her lower body was every bit as exquisite as the rest of her, long athletic legs rising smoothly up to supple hips and a flat tummy and framing a tight young pelvis and crotch.&nbsp; Nestled there with her taught thighs either side, a neatly trimmed line of black thatch ran in a narrow band down to a sweet, unspoiled cleft in that creamy skin, the lips of that Wonder Woman-hood puckering softly in a promise of divine rapture.&nbsp; 

Diana kept her expression neutral as her captors, even the coldly mercenary Deathstroke, stood and stared in vulgar awe at the unveiling of her secret self.&nbsp; The other women though watched with looks ranging from shock to sadness to simmering anger.&nbsp; Black Canary ground her teeth with frustrated rage, Starfire&#8217;s eyes narrowed as she watched the male filth staring with eyes she remembered all to well from her time as a slave of the alien Citadel Empire; Powergirl&#8217;s chains clinked audibly as she and Artemis both whispered curses that the roughest dockyard worker would have blinked at.&nbsp; Donna closed her eyes, brow furrowed with grief and outrage for her beautiful sister.&nbsp; All of these heroic women felt equally repulsed by what they were seeing.&nbsp; All of them would rather die than undergo such humiliation themselves, but it was a testament to their love and respect for Diana that any of them would have taken her place to spare her this degradation.&nbsp; No matter what happened next, no matter how they eventually triumphed over these craven scum, they would always have this victory &#8211; that they had reduced the bravest, purest, most noble champion of justice to their naked sex-object.&nbsp; The thought was too sickening to bear.

Diana looked Savage square in the eye, showing only courage and pride.&nbsp; &#8216;Please take care of those,&#8217; she said quietly, but with a cold air of menace.&nbsp; &#8216;I&#8217;ll be wanting them back soon.&#8217;

Savage chuckled, but Diana ignored the taunt, ignored the crude laughs of the fearsome five, ignored even the victorious glint in the eye of Deathstoke. Renowned on Earth and beyond for her mercy and compassion, the Amazon Princess was still fundamentally human, and the emotions roiling inside her were like a gathering storm.&nbsp; As the voice from the monitor spoke again, only the light in her clear blue eyes spoke of the determination that these men would pay a high price for their debased entertainment.

&#8216;Very good,&#8217; the voice smirked, &#8216;I believe we are ready to begin.&#8217;









Chapter II

In the centre of a large, machine felled chamber on a raised metal platform, the seal on a heavy metal chamber cracked with a slight hiss and whirred as the front section lifted upwards.&nbsp; Vandal Savage stood a few feet in front of the rising panel and inspected the devices sole occupant.

Princess Diana was secured into the machine by thick metal bands, some holding her arms back against the sides on the internal mechanisms, shoulders square and elbows bent about 45 degrees.&nbsp; Others did the same with her long legs, bent somewhat at the knees and spreading her still booted feet shoulder width apart and.&nbsp; A strip of metal passed across her throat and kept her head raised, and her tiara gleamed above her blue eyes, but those eyes showed signs of fatigue, and above the gold band the rich mane of black hair was sweat stained.&nbsp; Her earrings, the tiara and the boots were the only items her captors had permitted her to wear inside the machine.

Savage inspected the full form of the heroine, noting with satisfaction that she still showed signs of great strength and endurance. Her muscles bunched defiantly as she met his gaze, hands that could gouge holes in steel plates flexing with frustrated passion as she looked at his vulnerable throat.&nbsp; 

Savage was a unique individual.&nbsp; A criminal genius without question, he had already lived more than 10 000 years, thanks to being exposed to the radiation of a fallen meteorite that had rendered him apparently immortal.&nbsp; Tall and well muscled, with a cruel but handsome face framed by a brown hair and a neatly trimmed bear, he stood with the erect carriage that testified to his being one of the most confident and self assured men on Earth, a appearance backed by his exploits of violence and conquest that spanned not decades but millennia.

Smiling he looked down the length of her splendid form, again basking in the sight of an athletic frame, feminine hips and waist, tapering legs, smooth belly, full impossibly firm breasts and the neatly trimmed patch of midnight down above the perfect slit of Amazon mons.&nbsp; As gorgeous as these features had looked when her first saw them, their marvellous beauty seemed only enhanced by the many marks left behind by the working of the chamber.&nbsp; Scratches, cuts, burns and welts covered the magnificent female form on display &#8211; minor contusions oozed blood and the whole was covered in a gleaming film of perspiration.&nbsp; As the prisoner shook off the effects of the devices attentions, her incredible breasts swelled and subsided deliciously, a fact subtly noted by the other technicians in the room who had earned the privilege of helping to monitor the interrogation process.

&#8216;Hello Wonder Woman,&#8217; Savage smiled.&nbsp; &#8216;I trust that your time in the Pacifier is proving relaxing.&#8217;

Diana blinked, showing no emotion or embarrassment at her nudity.&nbsp; &#8216;Yes, thank you,&#8217; she said casually.&nbsp; &#8216;If you like I&#8217;d be happy to let you try it.&#8217;

Savage laughed and moved around beside her, inspecting the various cutting tools and needle tipped appendages now at rest in the raised front piece.&nbsp; &#8216;Thank you, Princess, but I wouldn&#8217;t want to disappoint our technicians.&nbsp; They have become quite fascinated by your endurance.&nbsp; Almost fourteen hours in the machine so far, and not even a scream.&nbsp; Very impressive, I must admit.&#8217;

Diana blinked and took in the information.&nbsp; Fourteen hours.&nbsp; There had bee times when it has seemed like days since the men had secured her into the evil mechanism.&nbsp; The sufferings inflicted by the &#8216;pacifier&#8217; were continuous and diabolically ingenious, and no part of her body had been spared its attentions.&nbsp; She had decided she would not scream whatever they did to her, focussed on that thought, and used it to counteract the pain of the torture machine.&nbsp; Diana&#8217;s will was second to none, and as an Amazon she was trained to accept pain and go beyond it.

But that did not mean she liked it.

Savage smiled again.&nbsp; &#8216;As a reward for your stoicism, allow me to share some information with you regarding some of your fellow captives.&nbsp; Specifically, you sister.&#8217;

A screen behind Savage flickered to life, displaying Donna Troy in some sort of metal chair, arms held behind her and legs spread wide.&nbsp; Strikingly similar in appearance to Diana, the younger Amazon was somewhat shorter at 5&#8217; 8�, but proportionally perfect, with exquisitely long legs, a magnificent athletic figure, sumptuous full breasts and a gorgeous face with its own long mane of black flowing hair.&nbsp; Usually she sported a red body suit that hugged her figure and displayed a generous but not immodest view of her cleavage, but that was gone. Her black boots and arm bracelets remained on, but the rest of her uniform looked to have been torn away, and she sat naked and completely exposed.&nbsp; Her full breasts and supple things looked red and raw, as if they had been burned, and her face showed signs of pain.&nbsp; Diana started in shock at the sight, mouth twisting in fury, but before she could hurl a sulphurous oath at Savage a man stepped into the frame, reaching for Donna&#8217;s reddened breast with one hand as the other fumbled with the fastenings of his pants.

Diana&#8217;s expression of anger gave way to horror, and then as the man moved forward towards her sister with his jutting member in hand turned back to fury.&nbsp; &#8216;You scum!&#8217; she screamed.&nbsp; &#8216;Stop it!&nbsp; Let her alone, damn you!&#8217;

Savage smiled.&nbsp; &#8216;Oh I&#8217;m sorry, your highness, but this extract from the whole footage is already several hours old.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t worry though &#8211; I&#8217;ve taken the liberty of having the entire sequence restarted from the beginning and played continuously on screens inside the pacifier as your continue your &#8216;therapy.&#8217;

&#8216;Savage!&#8217; screamed Diana, muscles straining.&nbsp; &#8216;You inhuman monster!&#8217;&nbsp; The front section rolled down again.&nbsp; &#8216;I&#8217;LL KILL YOU FOR THIS, YOU BASTARDS!&nbsp; YOUR DEAD, YOU STINKING PIECE OF��

The rest of her words were cut off as the metal chamber sealed itself with a soft clang.











Chapter III

Inside the pacifier, monitor screens filled the claustrophobic interior with harsh, electronic light, and the tinny echo of recorded sound filled Diana&#8217;s ears.&nbsp; She felt the blades and torches moving into position, gears hauling at her limbs to move her joints to the pint of maximum stress before the real torments began.

But the Amazon princess knew the physical pain would be a pale comparison to what she would endure as those screens flickered and began their tale of horror.

***

Several hours earlier�

The alien heroine Starfire and Donna Troy would found themselves in a white room with monitors of them, and small hatches in the floor and walls. They were clad in the ragged remains of their uniforms, and a pair each of heavy metal bracelets humming with electronics and binding their arms behind their backs by beams of energy.&nbsp; The restraint pulled their shoulders back and both twenty-two year old women were aware of how it accentuated their full, frontal curves.

Starfire, or Princess Koriand&#8217;r of Tamaran, stood in beautiful contrast to the raven haired Amazon Titan.&nbsp; Her skin a wondrous golden tan, her hair was a fiery auburn mane that rumbled wildly down to the small of her back and framed a face that any man would be rendered breathless by.&nbsp; Less angular than Donna&#8217;s Mediterranean appearance, she had full sensuous lips and eyes that were all green without pupil or iris, and which glowed faintly when her feeling ran high, which was often.&nbsp; Her body was an exercise in sexuality, lithe legs and strong arms, narrow hips and flaring waist offsetting a flat stomach with nicely defined abdominal muscles, and breasts that rivalled even Wonder Woman&#8217;s for allure.&nbsp; Those twin ripe round melons of soft golden flesh were only just restrained by Kori&#8217;s skimpy purple armour that held her breasts behind two vertical bands that plunged down either side of her exposed navel to a wickedly sheer bottom piece that showed off her tight round backside and cupped the sweet space between her smooth thighs.&nbsp; Knee-high armoured boots and armbands completed the alien girl&#8217;s appearance, making her look like a schoolboy fantasy of an exotic sci-fi warrior woman.

A voice spoke; male, gloating.

&#8216;Ladies, thank you for joining us.&nbsp; This room is going to be used to test you. We want to explore the limits of your endurance, both physically and psychologically.&#8217;

&#8216;First, let me explain about your bracelets,&#8217; the voice went on. &#8216;Their primary purpose is to ensure you remain our guests&#8217; he said, even as Donna and Kori were subtly looking around for a way of escape. &#8216;If, at any time, you use your powers to try and leave the room or do violence to any of our people, the cuffs will send a signal activating a small bomb in the bracelets of one of Wondergirl&#8217;s Amazon sisters. The result would be...messy. The lives of your sisters are totally in your hands - the program selects a victim at random - it could be...anyone.&#8217;

&#8216;You bastards,� Donna hissed, as Kori looked dumbstruck by the cruelty of what she just heard.&nbsp; &#8216;Why are you doing this?&#8217;
 
&#8216;As I said, to test you.&nbsp; Or rather, to help you test each other.&#8217;&nbsp; Kori looked at Donna with a worried expression in those luminous green eyes, and Donna felt a tremor of fear.&nbsp; But she steeled herself, showing no outward sign.&nbsp; Diana had not trembled before them, and nothing mattered more to Donna than making her older sister proud. And, she knew, that showing fear was the first step at giving up...and giving in to whoever is behind their capture.&nbsp; Diana would be looking for a way to get out of this and somehow rescue her Amazon sisters, and Donna knew she could do no less.

&#8216;What do you want us to do?&#8217; Koriand&#8217;r asked, voice full of venom, clearly expecting nothing good.

&#8216;First...strip,&#8217; was the reply. The girls look at each other in disgust, but no real surprise.

&#8216;You filthy degenerate&#8217;, Koriand&#8217;r spat.

&#8216;Do I take it you refuse?&#8217; asked the voice, heavy with threat.

&#8216;No,&#8217; Donna said quickly, looking at Koriand&#8217;r meaningfully, and the alien pursed her full lips and nodded.&nbsp; Both of the young women look repulsed and outraged, but knew that for now they had choice.&nbsp; Kori held Donna's gaze, and the raven-haired girl knew what this must be costing the proud Tamaranian.&nbsp; She tried to let her expression show her gratitude as Koriand&#8217;r reached up to the clasp on her armour.

&#8216;No,&#8217; says the voice. &#8216;Undress each other!&#8217;

Both girls briefly close their eyes, then Donna opened hers again and approached Koriand&#8217;r.&nbsp; The alien princess showed her trust in her friend by restraining herself from backing away.

Donna reached up, feeling for the clasp, reaching around behind the foaming mane of fiery hair and releasing it the catch.&nbsp; Koriand&#8217;r shuddered but standing still and letting it happen as the twin armour bands falling forward away from Kori's incredible breasts. The images on the monitors shift to the twin globes, examining every detail
Koriand&#8217;r instinctively covered her breasts with her arms but Donna gently moved her arms away, knowing without the protest from the bodiless voice that the meaning was for them to be exposed in their nakedness. 

Kori shuddered, but remained calm. Before finding her way to Earth, she had been a slave of the planer spanning Citadel Empire, which ruled most of the planets of the Vegan stat system with brutality and merciless, wanton cruelty.&nbsp; Taken as a hostage for her worlds continued survival when she was barely in her teens, the lovely girl had been subjected to debasements and horrors that would have destroyed the soul of other women, and which she had survived only by virtue of her warrior training and a will tempered by hardship into a nigh unbreakable force.&nbsp; She had known Donna ever since her escape, fought and laughed and bled beside her, and now she was trusting her friend with everything she was, willing to do this for her even as memories of slavery and torture among the Citadel before her flight to Earth threatened to bring a tear to the warrior vixen&#8217;s eye.

Donna took the chest piece and set it aside, looking Kori in the eyes as she moved her hands down to the crotch piece. The clasp here was near the hip, forcing her to step closer. Wondergirl reached around, releasing the bottom armour and pulling it away to show her friend&#8217;s lower abdomen under her washboard abs.&nbsp; A tight hairless slit lay sitting between her long golden legs. The picture on the monitors was busy switching from Koriand&#8217;r&#8217;s full, magnificent chest and her exposed alien womanhood and perfect ass.

&#8216;Excellent, I think we can leave the boots,&#8217; said the voice. &#8216;And now for Wondergirl.&nbsp; Please, Starfire, feel free to take a more energetic approach with that flimsy red uniform.&#8217;

Koriand&#8217;r looked at Donna with a tight expression, then grabbed for her teammates uniforms front, taking the red shoulder straps between her fingers. 

Donna clenched her jaw.

Partly to give the menacing voice no reason to harm the hostages, partly because she wanted to do this quickly in order to shorten the degradation for her friend, the Tamaranian tore the front of Wonder Girl&#8217;s costume open and let the young Amazon&#8217;s lush breasts spilling forth.&nbsp; Not so large as her own, but still exquisitely round and firm, pink nipples tight in the chill air, just as were Koriand&#8217;r&#8217;s non-humanly deep-orange tit peaks.

Donna swallowed and balled her fists, her eyes telling Kori to keep going, to get it done. Her own hands shaking with subdued rage, Koriand&#8217;r reached for Wondergirl&#8217;s thin gold belt and opened it.&nbsp; Donna's breasts rose and fell quickly as she waited for the moment, then she felt and heard the ripping of the front of her leggings open all the way down to her high black boots, taking the panties with them.&nbsp; She felt the cool wash of air over her exposed sex and a well-trimmed bush of dark, pubic hair appeared on the monitors, subtly highlighting the pink-lipped slit underneath.

Koriand&#8217;r deftly ripped the rest of Donna&#8217;s uniform free of her boots, each mighty heroine now clad only in their knee-high footgear.&nbsp; The girls let their arms hang slackly down their sides, their chins raised in defiance against the voice giving the orders.

&#8216;Very good ladies,&#8217; the voice announced, one monitor switching to show a reading of their respiration, pulse and ECG for the pair.&nbsp; All were agitated, but the girls maintained their composure, looking up to the roof in response to theS disembodied message.

A hatch opened behind Kori, and a set of metal binders on two gleaming poles rose up to waist height.&nbsp; Both women looking at the binders with equal discomfort.

&#8216;I believe we will start with the alien first - please step over and fix the binders to the shackles already around your wrists, my dear.&#8217;

Kori looks at Donna, seeming less afraid than her human friend.&nbsp; Donna was not nearly as worried about what might happen to her as she was desperate to prevent Kori suffering unnecessarily. &#8216;Why her first?&#8217; she said hurriedly into the room.&nbsp; &#8216;Paradise Island is an Amazon stronghold.&nbsp; I know more about it than Starfire.&#8217;

Patience,&#8217; came the reply.&nbsp; &#8216;In time we will indeed question you thoroughly about all your people&#8217;s secrets, Donna Troy.&nbsp; And you will both be involved in this little exercise, we promise.&#8217;

We&#8217; thought Donna.

&#8216;It's alright Donna,&#8217; said Koriand&#8217;r, stepping to the manacles.&nbsp; &#8216;They cannot truly injure me.&#8217;&nbsp; As she placed her hand near the shackles, they moved, attaching to the neuro-bands. At the same time, other small cuffs came up from the floor, pinning her ankles shoulder width apart.&nbsp; Donna watched in rising horror... this will get very unpleasant, she thought, furious that there seemed no way to spare Kori this ordeal. Onscreen her readouts climbing as her fear for her friend grew.

&#8216;Now, Miss Troy, we are almost ready,&#8217; the voice hummed. &#8216;We wish to test the Princess Koriand'r's endurance, but also your willpower and resolve. So at our command�you will hit Starfire.&#8217;&nbsp; There was a pause even through her shock Donna could visualise her opponents sick smile.&nbsp; &#8216;Hard!&#8217;










Part IV

Donna blinked and stood mouth open. &#8216;What?!&#8217; she gasped finally.

&#8216;You will strike the princess,&#8217; the enemy repeated, &#8216;targeting areas indicated by a laser pointer on her body. The bands on your arms will measure the force of your blows. Should you try to 'go easy' on your friend, the Amazons in our care will suffer.&#8217;

Donna looked horrified and felt tears of outrage burning in her eyes. &#8216;I�I can&#8217;t do that,&#8217; she said, voice thick with passion.&nbsp; &#8216;You can&#8217;t ask me to.&#8217;

&#8216;But we are, Donna Troy.&nbsp; Refuse, and Amazons will die until you comply.&#8217;

Kori looked at her friend. &#8216;Donna, you must,&#8217; she said evenly, her green eyes filmed with moisture, as well. Not for herself, but for the pain she knew this inflict on her best friend.&nbsp; Her gaze never wavered, but Wondergirl could see the slight tremor as she stood naked in the shackles, legs spread slightly and arms pulled back from her body, leaving every point of her amazing form open and vulnerable.&nbsp; Kori was far more resilient than any normal earth woman, but both of them knew how strong Donna was, and what it could do to even Starfire&#8217;s beautiful body if she struck her at full strength with the alien unable to defend herself.

For her part, Starfire called on her deep inner strength, but also on her bitter experiences as a slave of the alien Citadel Empire.&nbsp; Many times while in their custody she had faced torture, either at the hands of her owners or her own traitorous sister Kormand&#8217;r.&nbsp; On the planet Okkara both she and her sister had trained as warriors, and as such how to endure pain.&nbsp; That training mixed with her own vast courage were the reason why Kori had survived the ordeals of six hellish years.&nbsp; She remembered how she had prepared herself each time they had come for her to hurt her again &#8211; the agony table, heat lances, pain probes, torture drones with arms tipped with blades and hooks and things far, far worse to inflict torment on the most tender parts of her teenage body for the amusement of her captors.&nbsp; There were days when they would torture her for hours, cutting, burning and shocking her prominent chest so that blood flowed down over breast.&nbsp; Stretching&nbsp; and legs and thighs and her womanly body twisted and heaved as she screamed in pain; and then would remove her, apply medical care to her injuries and then begin again, laughing and playing with themselves in front of her as they exercised their vile lusts on her helpless, shapely person again and again.

And so now Kori found that centre again &#8211; the belief that whatever happened she would endure, she would survive.&nbsp; And one day, when she was no longer in these chains, and her enemies were standing before her�

&#8216;You time has begun,&#8217; says the voice, and a dot appeared on Kori's midriff. &#8216;You may use any part to strike her - fists, shoulders, knees, feet. Be creative,&#8217; the voice laughed evilly.

Donna blinked back tears, knotting her fist as the clock ticked down. Koriand&#8217;r steeled herself against the first of who knew how many blows.

Face filled with grief Donna struck, the blow to the midriff slamming hard into alien muscle, making Kori wince and stagger.&nbsp; Her muscles tightened against Donna&#8217;s fist, her abdomen sculpted like golden marble.

'You can do better, Wondergirl, don&#8217;t try our patience,&#8217; said the speaker, the dot still over Kori's stomach. 

Another voice filled the room, lighter but in no way gentler than the previous one. "The alien should not be allowed to tighten the muscles in her stomach. Would you be so kind and order her to relax and take the punch fully!"

&#8216;You heard the command,&#8217; came the first voice.

Donna shuddered, knowing they were ordering Kori to increase her own pain, and that the beautiful alien would comply to save lives. She gave Kori a slight nod to let her know what was coming, then let fly, the blow landing like the sound of wood breaking and the clenched fist sinking deep into Koriandr�s belly-pit.&nbsp; The alien had indeed relaxed, and he impact drove the air out of her in a cry of gut-wrenching agony.&nbsp; Starfire doubled in pain until the cuffs pull her up short, breasts dancing as she gasped noisily for air.&nbsp; Laughter filled the room, and then the dot shifted to her shoulder, near the collarbone.

Donna swallowed hard...then hit her friend on the marked spot so that Kori grunted in pain, flinging her hair back while the target shifted to her ribs. Donna followed, fighting tears, landing a jab that jarred bone and made Kori give a soft 'AAAAA!'.&nbsp; There was a feel of bone fracturing under the force of the blow and as Donna moved back Kori was standing favouring her uninjured side, her breathing more painful.

 Then the dot was gone.

Donna wondered if the ordeal is over until she saw the flicker of light behind her friend, as Kori gasped and softly sobbed in pain. &#8216;Behind, my back,&#8217; she hissed.

Donna blinked, understanding, moving like Hermes to get behind the battered Starfire where the dot lit her lower back. Heart filled with misery, Donna rammed her fist right into Starfire�s kidneys.&nbsp; Kori pitched forward, back arching as she gave a tight lipped scream.&nbsp; Her belly stretched flat as her ribs were thrust out by her arcing back, the force grinding those bones already damaged by the earlier blow so that if felt like someone had thrust a hot iron against Kori&#8217;s flesh beneath one rounded teat.&nbsp; With her navel stretched tight and incredible breasts pointing towards the ceiling, her legs shook in their cuffs and her arms were taught as she tried to tear herself free of the restraints.

The dot flickered to her upper leg so that Donna has to use her knee to ram into the smooth limb, making the muscle spasm agonizingly.&nbsp; Kori almost collapsed as her leg gave.&nbsp; 'Yes, use your legs,' ordered the first voice, not trying to hide its sick delight. The dot moved to the shoulder blade, so Donna had to move back for elevation, sobbing with every blow, her battle shouts full of anger as they made her beat her gorgeous friend bloody. Her black booted foot crashed into Kori&#8217;s scapula, breaking the skin with the heel and causing the alien to shriek as her shoulder was almost dislocated.

"The alien is a tough one!" the second voice said . "I�d like to see if the rest of her body is as resilient as her back and midriff!"

The dot shifted, dancing over one of Kori's impossibly firm breasts. Donna closed her eyes in horror. 'Kori, I cant,&#8217; she wept.

Starfire&#8217;s eyes blazed.&nbsp; She was hurting, but her voice was resolute. 'You must Donna.&nbsp; Do it.&#8217;&nbsp; Still Wondergirl hesitated.&nbsp; &#8216;For X'hals sake, hit me!&#8217;

Donna clenched her fist so hard a drop of blood appeared round her fingers, but merely stood looking anguished.&nbsp; Her own naked body was covered in sweat, breasts heaving as she breathed hard and small beads of moisture running down her stomach and thighs and the patch between her long legs.&nbsp; Her buttocks tensed&nbsp; magnificently as she steadied herself for the blow she was loathe to give.&nbsp; She flicked her head to clear the long black hair from her grief-filled blue eyes.

'Hit me,&#8217; Kori shouted at her, her golden body equally shining with sweat but also trembling in pain.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her tone became harsh, angry.&nbsp; 'Hit me Donna, you weak bitch.&#8217;&nbsp; She pulled herself straighter, ignoring the pain of her battered body.&nbsp; &#8216;Hit me and make it count.&nbsp; HIT ME!'

The stiletto-heeled kick smashed into yielding flesh, pummelling the tit and making the alien&#8217;s mouth fling wide in soundless agony. Her body was hurled back so hard that her damaged shoulder was wrenched out of place, the pain helping her find her voice in a short, high pitched shriek.&nbsp; As she hung there he dot shifted from one tit to the other, and Donna could only follow, smashing her boots into her best friends fabulous chest, making her scream in pain. Her breast flesh shuddered horribly with each strike, the amazing mounds of pleasure distorted and snapping back into shape over and over, so covered in bruises that oozed blood down over the full roundness and the tight golden nipples.&nbsp; 

And it just wouldn&#8217;t stop...the dot switched from tit to tit relentlessly, as Donna followed with heart-shattering kicks to her friends breasts, tears streaming down her face.&nbsp; The Titan kicked again and again, striking the tits from above the side and making them stretch across Kori&#8217;s body, from below so that they were flung up so hard Starfire though they would tear loose from her chest before they fell bouncing back down.&nbsp; The dot traced around the firm nipple, and Donna listened to her friends scream as hard boot ground the stiff sensitive buds deep into Kori&#8217;s ample tits, making them ooze blood as they were left purple and swollen with pain. Koriandr was also sobbing brokenly, full of pain, bones grinding together from the punishing blows as she twisted in her bondage, but still refusing to beg, knowing that Donna had no choice but to continue.

KRACK!&nbsp; 

'AAAHHHHH!" 
 
SWACK!!

'ARRRGHHHH!!! X&#8217;hal, the pain...'&nbsp; 

SMASH !!! 

'ARRRRRR!!!!!"

&#8216;Great, now her face,&#8217; they called, the voices, besides themselves with despicable glee.&nbsp; &#8216;Use your fist!&nbsp; Bust her lip!&#8217;

Donna was weeping openly, but forced herself not to think as she punched Kori in the jaw, snapping back her head, then hit her again, splitting her lip and drawing blood, the ichor coating her knuckles as red stained spittle sprayed the floor. Kori gasped with each hit, almost passing out, and that seemed to anger the monsters watching. She was in so much pain now she was barely aware of what was happening.&nbsp; She knew only that she was hit over and over, her body a mass of agony filled meat as she was held in the shackles and pummelled senseless.

&#8216;The cunt!,&#8217; the freaks in charge howled.&nbsp; The dot materialized in the mound between Sarfire&#8217;s legs, the golden lips moist with both sweat and the blood running down Kori&#8217;s body.&nbsp; Donna screamed in primal rage but didn&#8217;t hesitate, the voices shrieking with mirth and their cries echoed by both women as Donna lashed out with her booted foot, Koris' pelvis almost shattering, soft tissue being pummelled mercilessly.

Her sex bleeding, the courageous alien tried to stay upright, not wanting her friend to know how much she was hurting her as Donna was forced to strike her face yet again.&nbsp; Kori&#8217;s&nbsp; nose bled, cuts on her face stinging with tears, her screams growing shriller as another series of lighting fast punches against her full chest left&nbsp; the golden skin purpling with bruises, fists sinking into the warrior princess&#8217; mammal meat, crushing nerve-endings and glands 

The dot reappeared again over the hairless mound between the aliens legs. Barely discernable amid the bloodstains.

&#8216;Nooooo!&#8217; Donna wailed, but already taking aim despite her rage.
 
"The knee!" the second voice ordered, filled with evil delight. "Use your knee!"
 
Donna sobbed with fury and rammed her knee with all of her might right into Koriand&#8217;r�s defenceless pussy, the blow lifting the golden-skinned beauty off her feet.
The sickening sound of hard bones mashing tender, female pubic lips filled the room...followed by a shrill cry of animalistic pain by the gorgeous gold alien as her sweet centre exploded with pain.&nbsp; 

Her sex filled only with terrible pain that wiped away every conscious thought and made her body convulse massively, Kori&#8217;s mane of hair flew back and blood flew from her broken lips as she threw back her head and screamed her lungs out.&nbsp; Breasts shaking with the force of her howls and her nether lips were smashed one, twice, three times�she could feel herself being torn inside by the force of the blows, the nerve clusters in that soft tissue exploding like a supernova with every hammering blow.&nbsp; Donna struck again, and Kori coughed blood as the knee rammed upwards, thrusting her supple thighs apart as it lunged between them, crushing the faintly exposed lips of that sacred space and squashing it cruelly.&nbsp; Her clitoris was screaming messages of nightmarish pain as it was bludgeoned awfully and the meat of her woman hood was ground like raw meat between her friends&#8217; knee and her own pelvic bone.&nbsp; Wondergirl could feel the damage she was doing, could feel the gentle softness of Starfire&#8217;s sexual being smashed and destroyed by her, praying that Kori could forgive her and wondering could she ever forgive herself as she drowned in the horror of it.

&#8216;ENOUGH,&#8217; called the fist voice!

The dot mercifully disappeared.&nbsp; Koriand&#8217;r sank down, as much as her shackles permitted, coughing and moaning, sobbing like a broken thing.&nbsp; Donna stopped, sucking in air, as she rushed to cradle the battered Tamaranean, Kori bleeding and panting, beaten almost unconscious.

&#8216;Time for stage 2.&#8217; said the voice.

A needle rose from the floor, piercing Starfire's calf. She gasped, but stiffened in Donna&#8217;s arms, becoming alert, but in no less pain.&nbsp; Kori cried out in surprise and suffering, spitting up blood over Wondergirl&#8217;s breasts and legs.

&#8216;Now,&#8217; announced the voice, &#8216;you turn, Donna Troy,&#8217; 











�Now, you turn, Donna Troy,� announced the voice

PART�
V

&nbsp;

Donna Troy and Starfire

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

�Now, you turn, Donna Troy,� announced the
voice.

&nbsp;

The manacles released Kori and she
staggered forward, bleeding and stunned from the blows she had taken.� Donna rushed to grab her, casting an arm
around her waist and lowering the golden alien gently to the floor.

&nbsp;

�Omigod,� she whispered, tears running down
her face, �oh god Kori, what have I done?�

&nbsp;

�No,� Koriand�r�s panted, eyes gleaming as
she put her hand on Donna�s.� �Not�you.� Them.� Don�t
you�dare�blame yourself. �Any more than�I�blame you.�

&nbsp;

�Ladies,� says the monitor, �if you�ve
finished this touching scene, our next test awaits.�

&nbsp;

Across the room and floor panel opened and
a metal chair rises smoothly upwards.�
Its seat is hard and rectangular, with a low back fitted with the same
kind of restraints just used on Starfire.�
There were no arms, and only one support at the back.� At the front there were two long frames
flaring apart at a 90 degree angle, with more shackles fixed to near the base
about where a persons ankles would lie.

&nbsp;

�Your chair, Miss Troy,� the speaker
announced.

&nbsp;

�Starfire is hurt, she needs help
immediately,� Donna barked back angrily.

&nbsp;

�And she will get it,� was the reply.� �Since this test concerns her too.�

&nbsp;

Kori put aside Donna�s arm and rose shakily, the voluptuous young Amazon standing close to
support her if need be.

&nbsp;

�This test is simple, this time measuring
Wondergirl�s endurance, and Starfire�s control.�
Ms Troy will sit in the chair.�
Starfire will be made to process solar energy, and release it in the
form of her Starbolts.�� 

&nbsp;

�Against Donna,� Kori finished coldly,
shaking her head to clear it.

&nbsp;

�Correct.�

&nbsp;

Kori blinked, thinking back to a similar
experiment aboard a Psion ship, that had resulted in
her gaining her starbolt powers.� She
looked over at Donna, naked but for her boots and bracelets, face
a steely mask as she stepped forward.�
But Kori put out a hand.

&nbsp;

�No,� she said quietly, but firmly.

&nbsp;

�Excuse me?� the monitor queried.

&nbsp;

�Kori, we have no choice,� says Donna,
facing her friend.� �You have to,
please.�

&nbsp;

�No, Donna,� Kori says again, and her voice
is hard as iron.� �You think I don�t
remember the Citadel torture brothels; that I don�t know what these perverse
scum intend for you.� You know what my
starbolt powers can do, and I�m not going to use them on you like that.�

&nbsp;

�I suggest you persuade your team-mate,
Wondergirl,� came the voice, cold and pitiless,
�before I grow bored and blow up some Amazons to pass the time.�

&nbsp;

Donna takes Kori�s shoulders.� �You have to do this, Koriand�r, she pleaded,
full chest pillowed together between her arms as she held Starfire�s hands in
hers.� �For my sisters, you can�t
refuse.� I beg you��

&nbsp;

But Kori interrupted, pushing away the
hands and taking lovely Donna�s face in her golden palms. �Donna, I know you
love your sisters,� she whispered, �but I don�t know them, and I don�t love
them the way I love you.� Even if you
never forgive me, even if you hate me forever, I would sacrifice them all to
save you from this.�

&nbsp;

Donna stared back stunned, blue eyes wide
and staring into Starfire�s green ones, seeing the resolve there, and the
love.� And even in that room of horror,
she smiled sadly. She couldn�t hate Kori, not for this.

&nbsp;

But she couldn�t let anyone die for either.

&nbsp;

�Well, let�s blow up some hostages and see
if that changes anything� came the voice

&nbsp;

�Wait,� Donna cried out desperately.� �That�s not what you want here.� You want something else.�� Donna�s stomach twisted, knowing what that
was.� �We just need a compromise.�

&nbsp;

�Compromise,� came
the retort, sounding like a sneer.� �This
isn�t an Amazon philosophy lesson!�

&nbsp;

�Please, listen,� Donna called, mind
racing.� Her eyes lit.� �A time limit,� she called.� �We establish it first � when it expires,
Kori stops.� And you will have gotten
what you want.�

&nbsp;

There is a pause.� At last the monitor says, �Agreed.� Shall we say, twenty minutes?�

&nbsp;

�Five
minutes,� called Starfire immediately, eyes on her naked friend, thinking of
the touch of super-hot plasma on bare smooth flesh.

&nbsp;

�Please,� scoffs the voice.� �Fifteen.�

&nbsp;

�Five.� Kori said evenly. She stood away
from Donna�s protective arms, knowing the lie of it � neither of them could
save the other.� Not yet anyway.� But she summoned up her will and all her
training, making herself stand without aid, steady despite injuries that should
have hospitalized her.

&nbsp;

�Don�t push us alien,� the voice
warned.� �We have hundreds of
captives.� I could kill a dozen right now
and still have more than enough to ensure obedience.�

&nbsp;

Kori looks at Donna and saw the resolve in
her friend, and the courage.� Her large
bruised breasts rose as she took a deep breath.�
�Ten then,� the alien said, despair clawing her inside.

&nbsp;

�Done.� The voice announces.� �Lets begin.�

&nbsp;

�Donna walked over to the torture chair and sat
down, shuddering at the touch of the cool metal on her ass, her heart beating
against her rips. She put her arms behind the back of the chair, feeling for
the restraints and twitching as they snapped closed around her forearms,
pinning her there. A terrible feeling of defencelessness gnawed at her belly.
Hesitantly she lifted her black booted foot towards one of the ankle cuffs

&nbsp;

Kori watched, hating every second.� If she could have taken another battering to spared Donna this, she would have done so in a heartbeat.

&nbsp;

The cuff snapped around the young
brunette�s ankle. �And now the other, Miss Troy' came the voice of evil

�

Kori closed her eyes in despair.

&nbsp;

Donna complied fearlessly, having to strain
a little with her thighs to reach.� The
act pushed her pelvis forward, and the trimmed slit of her pubis puckered
softly between her splayed legs.

&nbsp;

SNAP!

&nbsp;

Outwardly Donna continued to look brave,
but she could feel the fear clawing at her. This was not like battle, where an
Amazon warrior accepted pain as the price for victory. Here she must simply
accept pain as best she could, with no power to control it.

�

Kori looked at Donna, feeling pity welling
up inside her. she knew exactly what her friend was feeling right now, having
felt it hundreds of times as a slave for the Citadels sadistic rulers, and
again in this room only minutes before.

&nbsp;

As Donna fought to steady herself another
chair rose behind the battered young alien. Kori demurely ignored the little
pink slit between Donna�s spread legs, turning instead to look at the device,
very similar to Wondergirl�s, but the hand restraints were just behind the
head-rest.

&nbsp;

'Please, princess, sit down. Your friend is
no doubt eager to begin.�

&nbsp;

Kori swallowed,
her mouth suddenly dry. &quot;Pigs&quot; she whispered and slowly sat down on
the chair. She looked at Donna, holding her eye and sending a message - don't let them break you, Donna; we will
survive this !Donna
looking back into the eyes of her friend saw a sad wisdom in there beyond the
alien�s years. Experience in these atrocities that Donna hadn�t had to endure
ever before in her life.

&nbsp;

Kori lifted her hands, bending her elbows
back beside her head to reach the manacles.

&nbsp;

SNAPSNAP � the bands closed around her
wrists. &quot;Good girl&quot; the second bodiless voice chuckled. Her arms were
now pulled back, and Starfire�s chest pushed out as a result, large firm
breasts still bruised and battered from Donna�s fists. That meant only the
ankle cuffs await her long legs. She lifted one foot slowly,� sickened by the invisible eyes undoubtedly
locked on her swelling breasts and that delicate cleft of hers that she was
about to expose.� She put her
purple-booted foot in the restraint, not moving as it snapped closed, her large green eyes fixed on Donna's, face stony.

&nbsp;

&quot;Don�t let us wait too long,
alien&quot; the second voice demanded wickedly. In reply she lifted her other
booted foot as her ass cheeks moved on the steel seat, deliberately taking her
time to show she was not afraid or embarrassed, drawing the inevitable out as
long as she could, without stopping the movement of her leg.� Then her ankle touched the steel jaws and it
snapped closed around her foot. And Princess Koriand�r shuddered briefly with
the well-known sinking feeling of being bound defenceless and her most tender
body parts being vulnerably exposed.

�

Suddenly Donna saw Kori stiffen, and the
golden alien felt tiny sharp needless piercing her wrists and the tips of her
fingers.� They dug in until they grated
bone

and the almost naked Amazon saw her companion clench her teeth against
the pain.

&nbsp;

There was a soft hum. The chairs slid
forward until the two super-heroines were only two feet apart, spread knees
almost touching.

&nbsp;

�'Now, we are almost ready to begin.' came the first voice. �The probes in Starfire�s hand will
serve as a channel for her starbolts.� As he spoke, mechanical arms dropped
down from the ceiling, tipped with some sort of energy emitters. Like
electronic serpents they positioned themselves over Wondergirl�s rounded
breasts, the emitters aimed at the stiffened nubbin of each swelling Amazon
teat and so close that a deep inhale by Donna would push her nipples against
the pitiless mechanisms.

&nbsp;

�Bastards!&quot; Donna hissed, as she watched the mechanical abomination positioning
itself, hovering insidiously at her pert nipples. Another set of smaller
devices rose from under the chair, positioning themselves either side of her
black tufted womanhood,� while with a
soft hum the chair legs pulled backwards slightly, spreading her wider, opening
her female cleft to show more of the vulnerable pinkness.

&nbsp;

Kori watches in appalled horror, as the
tiny energy emitters were probing their way into her friends wide-open cunt
while the larger probes above made eased even closer to make contact with
Donna�s hard tit-nubs. Donna closed her eyes, ashamed and enraged, just
grateful Diana was not here to see this happening to her.� As she trembled at the cold inhuman touch of
the energy rods on her breasts, the evil little machines pull apart her labia
with deceptive gentleness, their touch alien and horrible for all their care.
The twenty year-old Amazon felt her breathing quickening, as her most
vulnerable and tender spot was probed and violated without the slightest hint
of respect or regard.� The pressure made
her move her hips and her nipples pushed harder against the probes at her
chest.

&nbsp;

'Good,' said the voice, �and now for
Starfire.�

&nbsp;

Another evil hum and a long thick metal
cylinder rose between the two girls, both watching it in rapt disgust. Its
metal sides were chrome bright, eight inches long and the width of almost three
fingers, tipped with foul electronics. Donna flexed her hands in anger and
Kori�s muscular stomach tightened as the cylinder moves against her own,
wide-open pussy.� Her green eyes fitfully
peered down her flat, well-toned abdomen at her red-haired cunt as the metal
thing moving closer and closer to the centre of her crotch.� 

&nbsp;

Donna watched too, sick for her friend,
until her horror made her close her eyes.

�You scum,� she heard Starfire hiss, amid
the sound of her struggling hopelessly against her restraints as more soft
humming announced the probe moving inevitably into contact with Kori's orange
pussy mound.

&nbsp;

Koriand�r bit down on her lower lips as she
felt the metal slowly, ever so slowly, push her outer folds apart and begins
its intrusion inside her body. Her vagina still hurting from the blows of
Donna's knee, Kori gasped softly as she felt it twist slightly, then push
deeper, the electronics now fully inside, tickling her inner sex.

&nbsp;

Her eyes open and saw Donnas face wet with
tears, the raven-haired heroine knowing that her punishing blows to the pussy
were making this hell for her friend. Starfire set her face, not wanting to
know how much it hurts, wanting to spare her team-mate that pain at least, just
as she declined to betray her pain to her tormentors; refusing them as much of
their sadistic pleasure as possible.

&nbsp;

The probe moved with mechanical
mercilessness. Twist, push, twist push.� Little by little forcing
deeper. Starfire grunted as the cylinder worked its way up her woman-shaft.
Perversely, her sounds were not unlike those female uttered when being made
love to.

&nbsp;

Four inches inside.

&nbsp;

Five.

�

Her tunnel was being stretched now, her
breasts jiggling and swaying slightly, as the invader twisted further inside
her. No lover had ever filled her like this, though several alien rapists
had.� She forced herself not to linger on
the bubbling memories of those experiences.

&nbsp;

Six inches, and it hurt bad now.� She tried to relax her muscles, breathing
with her diaphragm. Six inches inside her and still pulsing and twisting its
way up her shaft while despite all her efforts images were filling her
thoughts;� tortures and rapes she thought
she would never have to endure again. And in the back of her mind, Kori
wondered, if they wanted to impale her with this thing, making it go right
through her belly and up back out through her spine.

&nbsp;

Seven inches and still it pushed into her.
Donna was able to see the pain on her friends face. 'Stop it, you'll kill her,'
she shouted, struggling herself though she knew it was useless, the bindings
easily able to handle the strength levels of Powergirl or even Diana herself.
�Can't you see she's hurt inside!� she spat at the ceiling as Kori moaned
pitifully.

&nbsp;

�Yes you did a wonderful job, Ms Troy,'
came the pitiless reply.

&nbsp;

�Kori�s jaw clenched as she pushed down her
fear, as the probes tip pushed against her cervix. Twist push. Twist push. She
was a princess of Tamaran � they would not have the pleasure of seeing her
squirm.� 

&nbsp;

�X�hal, please make it stop` she pleaded in
the sanctuary of her mind.� She could
feel her cervix being crushed...pushed deeper inside as she was sobbing.

&nbsp;

�Kori,� shouted Donna in desperation,
squirming herself like a mad beast to try and escape and help her friend.� The golden titan didn�t answer; just groaned
loudly as her womb felt like it was being distorted...pushed up, into her upper
belly.�� She gasped in pain, quivering
head to toe. It just couldn�t go any farther, but it did, deeper and deeper, a
relentless invasion of her body! Cold sweat glistened on her curves as she felt
another little push and heard herself screaming, Donna joining her, the metal
stretching her until she was about to split her sex flesh in two.

&nbsp;

It stopped.

&nbsp;

Trembling and shaking in her bonds, Starfire
couldn�t help making a constant whining sound. Hating herself for it...but the
pain was just too great.

&nbsp;

&quot;Aaaaauuuwwww.....auuuuuuuuwwww...!&quot;

&nbsp;

She sat, panting and sweating, then she cried out in new pain. The tiny, electric probes
along the cylinders began to slide out, poking into her up and down her elastic
cuntal wall, forcing the expandsion of her poor pussy even more. Stretching,
pushing.� 

&nbsp;

�Guuuu�uuuhhhhhh��nnnnnnneeeuurrrrrrr�.!�

&nbsp;

In the other chair Donna could no longer
bear to watch what they were doing to her beloved friends sexuality, her eyes
closed and tears wetting her cheeks as she muttered curses that would have
shocked any of her friends to hear from her lips.� The young raven haired Amazon tensed her
muscles for the tenth time, and for the tenth time achieved nothing more than
defining the wondrous lines of her super-toned smooth body until fatigue forced
her to relax. She took deep breaths that made her perfect breasts rise and fall
against the energy emitters poised to hurt her.

�

�And now ladies,�
came to voice over the sounds of Kori�s discomfort, �let us explain how this
will work. The probe inside Starfire will deliver a charge of solar energy,
which her body is able to process for flight and her starbolts. I believe,
however, there is a limit to how much energy her lovely body can store.� Kori
lay panting, remembering the Psion bombarding her with energy until she
screamed for mercy. �The only way Starfire can release that energy will be into
her hand restraints, which will then channel it to the probes attached to
Wonder Girl.�

&nbsp;

Kori trembled with rage as well as with
pain. At least the Psions did not force her to pass the agony along to someone
else.

&nbsp;

�The faster Starfire releases energy, the
less painful it will be for her. But of course, that will make it more painful
for you, Miss Troy.�

&nbsp;

Donna looked over at Kori, the alien
already seeming exhausted by the beating and the insertion of the torture
probe. How much more could the feisty Tamaranean endure. &quot;Don�t hold it
back, Kori!&quot; she urged. �I can take it...it�s only for ten minutes!� Kori
couldn�t even speak, but she nodded wearily.

&nbsp;

The second voice joined in. &quot;Starfire
is not allowed to release the solar energy BEFORE the point of overloading! She
can feel free to hold it back as long as she wants AFTERWARDS, but not BEFORE!
When she releases her solar energy, if is� before our readings indicate 100%
assimilation of energy, a dozen amazons will be punished!&quot;

&nbsp;

Donna looked up, blue eyes blazing. �If she
does that, she could explode!�

&nbsp;

&quot;So?&quot;

�

�You filthy, inhuman,
pigs.�
You'll pay for all of this!� Donna vowed, no sign of the photographer or
wife or lover in her beautiful face � only the Amazon warrior remained as she
glared death at the ceiling and her invisible tormentors.

&nbsp;

Kori shuddered, feeling strength returning.
If she overloaded, the explosion would kill not only her, but Donna as well.
No, she wouldn�t let it happen. Somehow she would find the will to endure it.

&nbsp;

�You can both rest assured, however, that
the room will safely contain the explosion. You won�t harm anybody else but the
two of you if you blow up, Starfire!&quot;

�

�Don't...worry...,� Kori sneered.� She looked at the gorgeous creamy skinned
woman facing her.� �I'll be fine, Donna;
we both will be, I promise.�

&nbsp;

�Like hell!� Donna muttered in impotent
rage.

&nbsp;

�Lets begin shall we,� said the first
voice.

&nbsp;

There was a buzzing hum, and Starfire felt a sudden tingling warmth between her legs. She looked at
Wondergirl, seeing the defeat growing in those beautiful blue eyes

�Don't give in Donna,� she whispers.� Don't let them beat you. We WILL be alright,
but you have to believe it.�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Watching from her torture chamber, Diana
struggled against the pain of the lazer torches scorching her belly and breasts
and felt more helpless than she had eve been.�
Silently she offered thanks to her gods for Starfire�s courage, for the
love she had for Donna to help her sister survive this horror.� As metal claws began to slowly flay the skin
from her back she bit her lip and prayed that her sister would survive, and
that she would soon stand free before the filthy who
were making Donna and Starfire suffer, so that she could teach them what pain
truly was.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Donna nodded, tears filling her eyes, yet
she managed not to shed them.

�

The tingling in her belly increased. �Say
it for me,� Donna, Starfire pleaded.

�

&quot;We will be alright!&quot; Donna
whispered.

&nbsp;

Kori winced, the warmth getting
uncomfortable in her stretched sex, but she raised her head and looked at Donna
with steely determination.

�

�Kori,� said the Amazon, full of concern.

&nbsp;

'Not bad,' Kori responded, face pinched.
The tickling inside her cunt was becoming a warmth....then
it started turning into a flare of heat.�
Her hips shifted, making her wince as the probe needles pierced her
anew.

&nbsp;

'A little faster, I think,' says the
voice.� 'Wondergirl looks bored.' 

&nbsp;

Kori grunted with pain, the burning now
starting to scorch her inside, even as she felt the flood of energy helping to
regenerate her injuries. 'You see,' said the voice, 'the alien is using the
charge to recover from the beating, as I predicted.' On the outward, Starfire�s
breasts swelled as her body ignited with renewed vigour, eyes glowing brightly.

&nbsp;

Donna saw her friend getting stronger,
hoping she would be strong enough, as her mouth formed an� �o�, those full lips trembling.

&nbsp;

'Interesting' said the monitor, 'A most
curious reaction.� Very...stimulating.'

&nbsp;

Kori shuddered, the flush of power filling
her with a strange euphoria, a tingling pleasure moving out from her pussy. She
arched her back in helpless bliss, as the energy of the sun filled her luscious
body and made her into a trembling form of buzzing power.� It continued, the rapture lighting her within
and transforming her into an erotic vision.�
Bound facing her even Donna was moved, though her feelings were mixed
with the sick loathing of knowing that this display was all being done against
Kori�s will, with no more regard for her rights and feelings as a woman than
was held for a lab animal. She panted with quick shallow breaths like a woman
in the throws of some wonderful passion, struggling to hold onto the excitement
building in the centre of her womanliness and radiating through her very skin.
Then the power reaches the limits of her body�s ability to absorb...

&nbsp;

�and the pain began.

&nbsp;

�'There are going to be a lot of people who will want to see these recording,' one of the
voices noted, and the other chuckled.

&nbsp;

Too much power feeding into her � her
breathing grew even quicker her, tits quivering like jelly. Her skin felt hot,
like he was standing to close to a bonfire.�
Every inch of her stung, energy prickling her painfully and getting
steadily worse.

&nbsp;

�101% Starfire - you may discharge now, if
you feel like it.�

&nbsp;

Kori began� to moan in pain.....relentless,
merciless pain. Too much power was being forced into her.� It throbbed in her veins and her head
pounded.

&nbsp;

�Kori, let it go,� Donna yelled, but the
alien princess made no reponse, her face twitching with suffering as muscles
became rigid cables under her shining skin. &quot;Kori!&quot;
Donna screamed, panic for her friend building.

&nbsp;

�Hurts..so much...
Donna,� the alien sobbed, her eyes closed.

&nbsp;

�I'll be alright - just do
it!' Donna snapped.

&nbsp;

Kori didn't want to,
she wanted to hold it, to spare her friend.�
She felt the power starting to roast her from within and imagined anew
her starbolts stripping the flesh from Donna�s creamy body while her friend
shrieked and writhed. But if she overloaded and detonated�

&nbsp;

��103%.�

�

Starfire�s groan turned into a scream that got� louder and louder,
breasts expanding as she sucked in air and howled to vent the suffering.� Her diaphragm flattened as she pushed air up
out of her lungs in a long wailing cry of pain.�
The torment from the probe jammed into her pussy washed out through her
nervous system like a horrific tide, making her contort violently, her
curvaceous body gripped in a torture-induced seizure that threatened to rupture
her internally as she twisted and strained in agony.

�

�Kori, let it go!� Donna shouted again.�
�Do you hear me!� I'm not going to let you kill yourself!! Let
it go, or I swear I'll let them do whatever they want to me.�

&nbsp;

Kori said nothing, but her green eyes
opened and she looked at Donna, courage fighting the inevitability of what was
going to happed.�
She shook her head fractionally, then gave
another scream as her pussy lips felt as if they had been set aflame, her
tremors making it look like she was fucking up and down on the torture probe
jammed up between her splayed legs.

&nbsp;

�I'll let them torture me to death!� Donna wailed,
making her voice angry. �I�ll let them tie me into their sick machines and tear
my body to pieces while they laugh.��
Starfire�s eyes closed again, tears and sweat running down over her
lovely, pain wracked face.� � KORI!!!�

�

&quot;Xhaaaal!&quot; Koriand�r screamed, and released the terrible power into the
machine.

&nbsp;

Donna had braced herself, but the energy
wave slammed into her through the emitters instantly sent her into spasming
convulsions, the power flashing from Kori�s hands into the receptacles and conduits
channelling it into her friend. Without any preamble her perfect tits were
suddenly on fire, as if they were been plunged into raging flames. The energy
needles crackled with blistering energy, scorching round smooth amazon boobs
with solar fire. And at the same time the emitters penetrating her love mound
also roared horribly to life. Wondergirl felt her breasts and cunt assaulted by
massive bursts of pure, undulated energy that could melt steel as easily as
mortal flesh.

�

�AAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!�

&nbsp;

The pain was so terrible she almost passed
out.� She trashed naked in her bonds, her
sexy athletes body out of control, bucking and trying to pull itself apart. Her
head snapped back, throat taught and models face a rictus of pain while her
mesmerising chest was glowing with fiery heat and her mons and belly glowed
with blistering starbolt energy. Blood began to ooze from broken skin around
her wrists as she tried instinctively to escape the source of this nightmare,
while only her high leather boots kept the shrieking princess from shattering
her ankles. She pushed with all the power of her incredible legs and thighs,
trying to pull her suffering pussy away from the metal rods burning her pink
sex.

&nbsp;

Even as Donna�s torture began, Kori felt
the pressure easing within her, ass grinding on the steel seat as she tried to
relax her aching form. Two feet away Donna's even more powerful legs continued
to be bunched with muscles as her midnight crested slit was filled
with awful burning power.� The probe
inside her vagina force-fed her body with a ceaseless stream of torture in the
heart of her being.

&nbsp;

�ARRRRRRRRRRRR�OH GODS, NO, NOOOOOOOO!!!�.

&nbsp;

�Donna,� Kori gasped, the release of power
clearing her head a little so that she tried to reign in the flow,� and knowing she was successful as she felt
the pressure build again�

&nbsp;

�Nnnnnnnnn, is the amazons only reply, back arched.� As the first wave ebbed, Donna blinked away
tears of pain, her head falling forward with her midnight mane half
covering her gorgeous features as Starfire again cried out.

&nbsp;

�

�

�Kori
hunched forward in her bondage as Donna still felt the aftermath of the power
charge, her naked ass grinding on the metal seat of the chair, sweat covering
her entire trembling body. The power inside the alien luscious body was
building up again rapidly; far too rapidly.�
Already it was all she could do to contain the force of her starbolts,
prevent them surging through the connections into the body of her friend.

�

�D- Donna, I'm so sorry,� gasped Koriand�r.
Her body stiffened in the chair again....eyes wide open in horror. �I can't, I
can't hold...it!� Her�
eye-popping chest rising and falling, teeth gritted. Donna
watched her teammates suffering with compassion and outrage, as she anticipated
the next wave of agony. Tears leaked from her big blue eyes and she clenched
her fists.

&nbsp;

'Put the flow on continuous' came one of
the voices.� 'I want to see how they
handle it when there is no relief.'

&nbsp;

NO!&quot; shouted Donna. At the same time,
Kori made to� cryout in anger herself,
only to have her shout turn to an �Arrggggg!!!� of pain as power raced from her
fingertips.

&nbsp;

Donna endured the energy washing over her
young tits again, blistering them as the solar fury raged within her tight
pussy lips, surging inside her as the probes held her side open and
defenceless. The power went sluicing up her love tunnel like liquid fire, so
that she was soaked in sweat from her suffering,� body tense with pain. She screamed and
screamed as hot, white agony ripped through her lush feminine anatomy and
pussy. And even through her own screams, she could hear Koriand�r�ss cries of
pain and despair.

&nbsp;

'Rhea...oh goddess have mercy,' Donna
pleaded, desperate for the torture to end, the pain battering at her
resolve.� She hurt so much. Kori tried to
reign in the power, to help her friend, but only succeeding in adding to her
won misery. &quot;Xhal! Xhal, make it STOP!!&quot;
Starfire screamed, immediately ablaze with greater pain as the power increased
even more, so that her skinned glowed with the heat trying to burn its way out
of her body from within.

&nbsp;

�Perhaps we will,� said the voice, �if you
will give us information about Princess Diana.�

&nbsp;

It is almost a miracle, that the two women
can make the voice out, let alone capture the meaning of his words. Both were
twisting and trashing and trembling in their bonds, their bodies impaled
through their soft sex lips and punished relentlessly in a circuit of
devastating power.

&nbsp;

�Di...Diana...?� came Donna's anguished sob.

&nbsp;

�Yes, Wondergirl, you will answer our
questions about your lovely sister, and your pain can stop.� Otherwise...�

&nbsp;

There is a surge and Kori howled again, her
arms almost pulling from their sockets as she pushed out her massive globed chest,
screaming horribly. Her scream then followed by Donna�s, as the additional
charge of power was channelled to her own cunt and tits.

&nbsp;

�Donna,� shouted Kori through her tears of
agony, �tell them nothing!�

&nbsp;

�Yes&quot; the second voice speaks up.
&quot;Don�t tell us, since this gives us a reason to increase the power just a
bit more, doesn�t it?&quot;

&nbsp;

�YeeeaaAAAAHHHHH!' �the golden princess screamed,
mouth so wide it feels as if it well tear apart while the torture probe in her
cunt glowed with terrible heat and she could feel her soft womanly tissue being
reduced to blackened, charred meat.

&nbsp;

&quot;Stop it!&quot; Donna shouts through
the storm of pain howling inside her own body and mind. �Stop it!� Donna shrieked
again.� Her pride was being burned away
by the heat in her nipples, roasting her alive, incinerating her womanhood as
the densely clustered nerves sent her brain messages of such anguish it made
her wish for death.

&nbsp;

�Information,� came
the reply.

&nbsp;

��I CANT!!!� Donna cried out, wailing like an infant.

� 

��Tell us, slut! Or you two will watch each
other fucking die!�

&nbsp;

Both beautiful girls heaved in their chairs,
their screams ringing in each others ears. Two incredible
bodies spasmed in unison, being torn apart by the energy surging through them
as they rode the torture probes spearing up into their pussies.

&nbsp;

�Ten minutes,� announced the second voice
gleefully. �Cut the connection to the Amazon...let�s see how much the alien can
take without being able to channel the energy!�

&nbsp;

Instantly Donna slumped
forward, sweat running down from her lank black hair. While Kori screamed
become even more frenzied as she convulsed, tits jumping and thighs clamped
around the pain probe in her cunt. The auburn haired warrior woman� jumped in her bonds like a live wire,
screaming and sputtering at the brink of pain-wretched madness

&nbsp;

�NOOOOO!&quot; Donna screamed in misery, still spasming from the charges in her
body herself. ��STOP IT. YOU�RE KILLING
HER!�

&nbsp;

�Yes,� said the second voice, �and now that
your ten minute are up, you will watch as she dies in
agony!�

&nbsp;

Donna fought like a wild animal to free
herself, straining every muscle beneath her creamy skin to get to Kori and
throwing her naked body from side to side, but her strength was even less of a
match for the manacles after the torture.

&nbsp;

Kori had stopped screaming, was beyond
screaming. Her young full body was in more pain than she had ever felt. Her face
was wet with molten tears as she burned like a small star, ,
but somehow the Tamaranean hissed out words for Donna to hear.

&nbsp;

�'Tell.....nothing......' she whined, the probe
in her pussy pulsing almost white hot, so that Starfire�s words dissolved into
a long, undulating shriek of mindless agony. The skin on her rounded tits
started to split, little rivers of blood boiling though her flesh as crackling
arcs of energetic plasma flickered around her sex lips and burned her sweet
young cleft, burned her sex while she could feel the flames flaying her from
inside as well, burning her alive!

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The video stopped, leaving Diana gazing in
complete horror as the nerve probes stabbed into her own labia, making her gasp
in pain.

&nbsp;

They screens flickered and again she was
watching Donna pummel Starfire�s smooth sex mound, her knee strikes almost
shattering the golden Titan�s pelvis. They liked to do this, play the images
out of order, jumble them and leave her wondering what had happened, who were the men she had seen putting their hands on he naked
sister.

&nbsp;

Diana tired again to ignore the images and
sounds of theo tow young heroines being degeraded, but
in her current circumstances the only way to do that was to focus on her pain. �As her captors no doubt intended.

&nbsp;

Time crawled� by in the pacifier, and whatever she
tried, all Diana could do was suffer and weep.

Part VI

&nbsp;

Diana

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

For the second time in as many days the
Pacifier stood open, it dark haired occupant breathing the cool filtered air of
the spacious white concrete room as she gathered her strength during the
respite.� The only sound now was the
faint steady rhythm of her breathing, but in her mind Diana could still hear
Starfire and Donna�s screams as they were tortured, and then raped.� 

&nbsp;

They had raped her sister.

&nbsp;

Not only that, they had made her watch the
act while she herself was strapped virtually naked into their obscene device
and tortured continuously. Her body cut, torn, shocked, twisted and burned
while the men outside had observed every depraved moment of her ordeal, and in
turn forced her to bear witness to her sister�s sexual degradation. Not once,
but over and over.� As the probes had
sliced her skin, scorched her belly and thighs, sent searing surges of energy
into her breasts and nipples, and probed the nerve clusters between her amazing
legs with pain inducing needles, she had seen Donna being mounted by the
anonymous mercenary and the man rut in her womanhood. In slow motion, rewound
and shown from multiple angles, paused and the image zoomed in - she had been
inundated with the sight of his stiffened member pushing Donna�s sweet young lips
apart as his foul emissions coated the entry of her female
temple.� Hours of listening to her
sister�s curses and sobs, the laughter of the men and the sickening slap of
flesh against flesh as the rapists pumped their engorged members in and out of
their courageous, helpless victims. Until, at last, their seed spurted loose to
soak the captive�s battered loins and the view had been reset to begin the
awful spectacle again.

&nbsp;

She wet her lips, felt the tears stinging
the corners of her eyes and forced them away.�
She was a Justice Leaguer, she was a Princess
of the Amazons.� She was Wonder Woman.

&nbsp;

They had raped her sister.

&nbsp;

Diana raised her head slowly and saw Savage
standing in front of her, smiling like a foreign diplomat as he once again
looked over her battered body without the slightest compassion or remorse.

&nbsp;

�Still feeling witty, your highness?� the
dark bearded immortal said, smile unwavering.

&nbsp;

Diana said nothing; she simply spat a heft
gobbet of fluid onto his immaculately shined riding boots.

&nbsp;

Savage looked down at the offending
material and sighed.� �I suppose I�m
going to have to have one of your amazons lick those clean again,� she
said.� �Perhaps your sister��

&nbsp;

Diana reacted instinctively, hurling her
full power against the restraints keeping her from Savage�s throat.� Despite being rated at resisting thousands of
tons per square inch the Pacifier rocked with a thunderous clang.� The technicians about the room jumped in fear
as the manacles barely succeeded in holding the gorgeous super heroine captive.

&nbsp;

Savage , however, did not move, merely
viewing the struggling Amazon impassively as she strained with all her power to
escape, face tight with effort and her fingers twitching with passion.� The muscles of her incredible physique moved
sinuously beneath her bruised and battered skin, goddess breasts heaving as she
glared at him with a look that made the description homicidal seem tame.

&nbsp;

Fearlessly Savage took a step closer,
standing only a foot from Diana�s sweat streaked face as her lips parted in
snarl.� �Well,� he smiled, reaching down
to carefully caress the array of metal skewers positioned level with the
heroine�s neatly trimmed womanhood, �it would seem these aren�t the only things
to have struck a nerve today.�

&nbsp;

Diana finally found the composure she
needed to be able to speak with this animal. �Your immortality is done,
monster.� I swear by the dark eyes of
Hades you will not leave this Island breathing.�

&nbsp;

Savage laughed lightly.� �You�re wrong Princess, or perhaps simply
naive.� For example, you might be under
the impression that the wider world and its heroes will come to the aid of you
and your friends and sisters.� Rest
assured, steps have been taken to ensure that they are
completely unaware of what is transpiring here.�
By the time Superman, Batman, and the rest of the planet learns of what
we have done, you and your companions will be long past caring.�

&nbsp;

Diana took another steadying breath � as
always Savage was the epitome of composure, his confidence buoyed by millennia
of experience. �The Themyscrian
forced herself to remember the first time she had met him in person, when the
enchantress Morgan Le Fay had captured them both and several others, in order
to torture them for the extraction of their immortal essence.� It was only after Diana had freed herself and
defeated the ancient witch that it was revealed that Savage could have himself
escaped at any time, allowing his own capture and torture simply to alleviate
his boredom.

&nbsp;

Diana hated this creature in front of her
as she had never hated anyone before, but her training and discipline kept
those feelings in check.� Savage was
evil, but also crafty, resourceful, even courageous in his fashion.� Allowing her disgust to blind herself to
those realities would not help her or her friends.

&nbsp;

�What do you want here, Savage,� Diana said
in a coldly calm voice.� �You and Deathstroke and the others; you didn�t go to all this
trouble and risk just for our
benefit.�

&nbsp;

Savage sniffed and reached out to stroked her shoulder.�
It took all her control not to flinch away from the touch.� �So humble,� he said, and his fingers ran
down from her collarbone to the top of one curving breast. Diana didn�t let
herself watch his hand, blinking slowly.�
�And so wise, though I�m sure you underestimate your value in some
quarters of the so called �villainous� community. There are a great many men
who would risk much more for the chance to see,� he paused and his fingers
travelled down the steep curve of her breast, and then flicked over one
perfectly round nipple, teasing it to semi erectness while Diana swallowed, �
and to touch what I do right now.�

&nbsp;

His hand cupped her breast, aggravating the
pain from the burns and lacerations that blemished the otherwise perfect
flesh.� Diana ignored the hurt as she
ignored the humiliation of her captor�s intimate fondling of her female
globes.� �But of course you are correct,
my dear Wonder Woman.� Neither
your friends, or even you, are our primary reason for being here.� Though you are an integral
part of our plan.�

&nbsp;

�Is that so?� Diana said in a neutral
voice.� Keeping her voice even and
talking to this filth was probably the hardest thing she had ever done.

&nbsp;

�While I personally do not feel the need,
there are many parties both on Earth and beyond who you have offended with your
heroic efforts.�� Savage�s hand left her
breast and his fingers traced the hard plain of her abdomen. Diana felt as if
slime fron a cesspit were oozing over her. �It was
not difficult to find partners for our venture here in return for the
opportunity to exact a very�,� he smiled again, as if he were revealing some
small secret, ��personal level of
revenge on your lovely self.�

&nbsp;

Diana glanced around at the instruments of
pain poised inside the pacifier shell to resume their nightmarish work on
her.� She had though she recognized some
of the machinery, though the last time she had viewed them she had been
semi-conscious.� �White Martians,� she
said quietly.

&nbsp;

Savage smiled wider, and his hand massaged
her belly just below the navel.� �Very
good highness,� she said with a mock nod.�
�Yes, the few of their number that survived their encounters with the
League provided some of the technology used in the pacifier from their so
called Flower of Pain.�� His hand dipped,
his fingers moving to slide along the soft crease of her feminine centre.� �I trust the machines ministrations have not
left you permanently debilitated?�

&nbsp;

Diana felt a sharp discomfort as his digits
applied pressure to her sensitive quim, still
smarting from the needle probes that had pierced her over and over until she
had though she would go mad with the effort to suppress her screams. She looked
down at where he was rubbing between her legs and then back up at Savage.� �Take you hand off,� she said in a quiet but
deadly voice.

&nbsp;

Savage made no move to comply, but instead
rubbed more firmly, Diana feeling the pressure behind her labia on the inside
of her sex. He used one finger to part her lips just a little.� �Do you feel helpless, Princess.�

&nbsp;

Murderous was more like it, but Diana kept
her calm.� �Remove your hand from my
person � now!�

&nbsp;

Again Savage continued as if she had not
spoken.� He looked down at where his
finger was now resting between the folds of soft smooth flesh.� The woman was dry, but that hardly mattered.� He pushed his finger in knuckle down, a
shallow jab between her nether lips so the top of his finger was enclosed in a
soft wrapping of pussy. Diana remained perfectly still, Savage admiring her
control.� He was keen to test just how
good that control was. �Do you suppose this is how your sister felt, just
before our man raped her?�

&nbsp;

Diana�s nostrils flared as she drew in a
breath.� Her lovely face twitched with
barely concealed fury, her muscles bunching so that the villain could feel it
where his finger was diddling her unwilling love breach.

&nbsp;

�Helpless, abandoned,
totally alone.��
He pushed deeper, able to discern the moist folds inside the captive
heroine as he wiggled his finger, questing up into her. �Afraid.� Ashamed.� His second knuckle had reached her
pussy cleft now, and he let his hand move back and forth, penetrating her
gently but firmly while he watched her mouth grow tight and her breasts quiver
with her outrage. He moved his finger so it applied soft pressure to the bump
at the top of her opening. �How do you
feel, Princess?�

&nbsp;

With the vile beast�s finger on her
clitoris, Diana�s throat was so tight she could not reply for a moment.� Her eyes held the cold fury of an artic
storm.� �Glad I�m not you,� she said, the
words heavy with contempt and menace.

&nbsp;

Savage stepped so close that his chest
brushed against her outthrust breasts. He pushed his hand up, getting his
greedy finger all the way inside her and pressing her pussy with the palm of
his hand.� He rubbed her gently,
stimulating the small kaleidoscope of nerves under its hood of skin so that she
felt sick at his mockery of tenderness.

&nbsp;

�While at this moment, I would not be
anyone else,� he whispered.� He thrust
his finger once, twice, pushing up into the very heart of her, suing his vast
experience at how to touch a woman to humiliate her while she held herself
motionless and her stomach roiled with nausea.

&nbsp;

Suddenly she felt a sharp pain in her
neck.� Glancing across she saw Savage�s
other hand holding a syringe to her and pushing its contents firmly down the
needle and into her bloodstream.

&nbsp;

�Goodnight,� sweet Princess, she said
softly, as Diana blinked and swooned.�
The last thing she saw was Savage smiling like a benevolent patron as
she felt his finger still sliding in and out of her womanhood.

&nbsp;

In a room not far away, two shadowed
figures sat poised in front of their monitors, both tense with anticipation of
what would happen next.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;














PART VIII

DIANA


Diana hung slack from her bonds, her body drenched in sweat. Her hair was damp with moisture and hung straight down her back and over her shoulders, some of the lank black strands clinging to the full curve of her perfect C-cup breasts.

She breathed slowly. Her muscles ached from where she had twisted for hours under the agony of the villains&#8217; tortures. She felt pummelled and sore. Her eyes were bloodshot from fatigue and tears she could not prevent.

Up in the booths, she could hear the men raping three of her Amazon sisters. Savage had taken great pleasure in telling her how the scum could only stand so much excitement from making her suffer. Every so often they would stop, and then Deathstroke&#8217;s mercenaries would bring in a trio of bound Amazon women, stripped naked. The monsters would then slake their lust on the bodies of the Diana&#8217;s helpless sisters.

A woman&#8217;s scream of pain came from the booths, followed by Electrocutioner&#8217;s coarse laughter. They liked to hurt the prisoners as they violated them. She could hear male grunts as they rutted inside women Diana had known all her life as friends and sisters. The women rarely made a sound, except when pain ripped it form them.

&#8216;They certainly seem virile,&#8217; Savage observed as he stood in front of the hanging Princess, staring up at the booths. He was wearing his tailored suit, hands behind his back. There was a flare of red light from heatwave&#8217;s part of the booth and another female scream. Savage turned and stared up at the suspended Diana. &#8216;You clearly get them quite excited.&#8217;

Diana looked at him with loathing. &#8216;I can take more, Savage,&#8217; she said. Her voice was soft but still clear. She flexed her muscles, ignoring the pain shooting through her arms and long legs. &#8216;Come on, you know you want to see me suffer.&#8217; She pushed out her chest, her breasts swelling proudly. &#8216;Show me what you have in store.&#8217;

Savage looked at her, a glimmer of lust passing across his bearded face. But then he shook his head. &#8216;You astound me, Amazon, truly. Any other woman would be so broken by her torture that she would relish the through of her best friend being raped to death if it gave her a moments escape from the pain, but you?&#8217; He chuckled. &#8216;You actually hold out that goddess body of yours for more abuse.&#8217; 

Diana pressed her red lips together, trying to think of a way to get these animals to focus on her instead of her sister Amazons. Another wail came from the booths overhead, followed by a man whooping in delight. It was only a matter of time before one of the prisoners delivered for rape was killed, either by accident or deliberately. 

&#8216;It does make me wonder though, what lengths would you go to give your sisters some respite?&#8217;

Diana looked down at him as his eyes wandered over her naked torso. They lingered on her spread thighs and the pouting pink cleft between them. She knew what he wanted to hear from her. The Princess fought the fatigue fuzzing her thoughts, trying to fine a way out of this trap. All she could think of was a way to buy more time, perhaps gives others a chance to come to their aid. Some of the most intelligent and powerful heroes on the planet were on the Island. She just had to keep her friends and family alive til their chance came. &#8216;What do you want me to do, Vandal?&#8217; she asked huskily.

&#8216;Ho-HO!&#8217; the immortal villain laughed. &#8216;I knew that you could play the temptress if properly motivated, Amazon.&#8217; He smiled appreciatively, then walked over to a console and pressed a button. There was a whine of machinery and Diana&#8217;s bonds moved, keeping her spreadeagled but lowering her towards the floor until she hung with her toes just off the surface, directly in front of her captor. She looked him in the eyes, fists clenching slightly as his own gaze wandered to her breasts. Off to one side Desaad continued to monitor her, smiling rapturously as he felt her sense of anger and dread. 

&#8216;Right now I could do anything to you, couldn&#8217;t I Diana,&#8217; he said. His smile was genial and full of evil. &#8216;Say it.&#8217;

&#8216;You could do anything to me,&#8217; she said levelly.

He stepped closer, and reached out his hand, letting it hover just over her right breast. &#8216;Do you think this is how it was for your mother?&#8217; he asked her. At the mention of her mother Diana&#8217;s face flushed with anger. &#8216;When the armies of Heracles were raping every one of your sisters just like this, do you think Hippolyta knelt before the demi-god and begged him to fuck her if he would spare her subjects?&#8217;

Diana grit her teeth, muscles moving under her fair skin. One of women in the darkness upstairs cried out and sobbed in agony.

Savage&#8217;s hand was still an inch from her flesh. &#8216;What can I do to you, Amazon?&#8217;

She kept her voice level and eyes steady. &#8216;Anything.&#8217;

His hand cupped her breast.

Diana felt his hand on her skin, on her tit, rubbing it gently. She wanted to scream, to curse. She wanted to tear free of the bands holding her and rip Savage&#8217;s arm from its socket. But she kept still, instead feeling the rage and shame bubbling up like bile from the pit of her stomach as he played with her soft womanly orb. He pressed his palm against her, forcing her nipple to push up against his hand. Diana breathed out loudly through her nose but otherwise made no sound.

&#8216;It feels glorious, Amazon,&#8217; he told her, smiling. Diana said nothing.

Savage release her breast, but stepped around behind her. Diana swallowed, aware of the shadows moving in the space above the, aware of the sound of bodies pressing together in a forced, unequal rhythm. She heard him collecting something, then he stepped up close to her, pushing her hair out of the way as his face hovered just over her right shoulder. His hands moved around in front of her and looking down she could see what he had collected.

It was a harness, set with two metal cups made of thin bronze coloured bands. The cups were narrower at the base, wider at the top, so that they ballooned outwards. Around he inside at the base the bands were studded with thin, sharp barbs, while at the apex of each was a screw that jutted out to a wing-grip almost six inches from where the twisting metal shaft protruded from the cup. The end of the screw was a flat circle a half-inch in diameter, though Diana could see that the outer edge of that circle was a sharp line of metal. There seemed to be some mechanism at the point where the screw passed in through the bands.

&#8216;This will not be mental torture that you can shield yourself from, Amazon,&#8217; Savage told her, fitting a set of straps behind her back and pulling them together through a buckle. Another set went over her shoulders. The bands settled around her breasts, tighter at the bottom so that her breasts were made to bulge upwards and outwards, filling the space. Diana could feel the barbs pricking her, threatening to pierce her skin. Except she knew it was no threat, it was a promise. &#8216;You wont be able to tell yourself this isn&#8217;t really happening.&#8217;

Diana tried to breath steadily. She looked over her shoulder at him, swallowing. &#8216;You&#8217;ll stop them,&#8217; she said. Her eyes flicked up to where her sisters had the villains cocks rutting in them.

Savage pulled on the straps, securing the vile mechanism in place. Diana knew it was no coincidence he would choose a device specifically designed to inflict pain on the anatomy of a woman. As he tugged it tighter she felt the sharpened barbs inside the bands puncture her breasts at half a dozen points, with just enough force to draw blood. She snorted softly, a slight arching of her toes all the indication of the stinging pain. 

&#8216;Yes, I will stop them, but first you must give me something.&#8217; He brushed a strand of hair from Diana&#8217;s cheek. &#8216;Tell me what I can do to you, Wonder Woman.&#8217;

Diana wet her lips, concentrating on her sisters and helping them. &#8216;You can do anything to me, Savage.&#8217; She turned and looked him in the eye. &#8216;Anything you want to do, you can do.&#8217;

&#8216;Hurt you?&#8217;

&#8216;Yes.&#8217;

&#8216;Rape you?&#8217;

Diana clenched her jaw. It doesn&#8217;t matter, she told herself. Saving lives matters. Nothing else. &#8216;Yes.&#8217;

Desaad groaned in pleasure.

Savage smiled and put his hands around her waist, sliding them across her flat belly. Diana fought the feeling of helplessness. She would find a way out of this, for all of them.

&#8216;I&#8217;m not going to rape you, Amazon,&#8217; he told her. &#8216;In the end you will beg for my cock. Not for others, but for yourself. I want to hear that surrender. I will leave just enough of you to remember what you were and to hate what you have become.&#8217; He kissed her shoulder. &#8216;But until that sweet moment, I can give you pain, Princess.&#8217;

Diana breathed gently, not wanting to push her breasts against the spikes cupping them. Her sisters were suffering and nothing else mattered at that moment.

&#8216;Do you remember what the demons did to you, Amazon,&#8217; Savage asked. &#8216;The feel of demon prick sliding into between these tits as they were crushed in a vice?&#8217;

He paused, and she realised he expected an answer. &#8216;Yes.&#8217;

Flesh slapped hard against flesh upstairs. A woman wept in shame. Her sisters. &#8216;Would you like that to happen again?&#8217;

Diana knew what he wanted. &#8216;No,&#8217; she said. 

Savage stroked the line where her breasts bulged slightly against her chest. &#8216;This pain will be different.&#8217; He touched the screws. &#8216;As these are turned, they will crush against your nipples. The tighter they are turned, the more your tits will hurt.&#8217; Diana ignored his use of vulgarity, knowing it was deliberate to humiliate her further. &#8216;The metal is hardened Prometheum alloy. Your Amazon is skin is resilient, but this will be able to twist it, tear it.&#8217; He kissed her shoulder.

Diana could hear the men grunting as they moved inside her friends. The sound of a fist slamming against flesh came from one of the booths, and the soft hiss of pain from the woman being beaten.&nbsp; She thought about what it was like for the Amazons lying there, helpless, feeling their bodies desecrated by the men&#8217;s lust-hard members moving in and out of them. She felt sick.

Suddenly she felt something pushed into her hand. It was a set of small controls, like a plastic grip four inches long with a set of buttons on the side. Instinctively she held onto them as Savage came back around in front of her.

&#8216;What can I do to you, Wonder Woman?&#8217;

&#8216;Anything,&#8217; she told him again, looking him in the eye.

&#8216;Yes,&#8217; Savage smiled through his black beard. &#8216;But I&#8217;m not going to.&#8217; He tilted his head forward. &#8216;You are.&#8217;

Diana breathed in and out. Sick. He was sick. But her sisters were depending on her.

&#8216;When you press the button at the top of the grip, the screws will turn, pushing in. You are in control of your pain &#8211; the tighter they get, the more you will hurt.&#8217; He held up a small data pad. &#8216;This will measure the signals being transmitted along your nervous system. It will tell me how much pain you are in. The other buttons add extra features to the torture.&#8217; There was a blast of electrical light and one of the women being raped screamed as her friends cried out in support. &#8216;In order to access them, you much reach a certain level of suffering.&#8217;

Diana glanced over at the grip in her right hand. She could have crushed it with a thought. Instead she looked back at Savage. &#8216;Fine. Let them go.&#8217;

Savage shook his head slightly as a flush of anger heated Diana&#8217;s face. &#8216;Not so easy as that, Princess. I will release on Amazon each time you achieve a new level of suffering. In order to do that, you must press the buttons when the unit issues a beep. That way you will know you can increase your pain.&#8217;

Diana looked at him, her lips pressed tight. There was no use arguing with him, or begging. This was his game. There was no use doing anything at all, except starting.

She pressed the top button.

At once the screws on each side began to twist, turning and moving inwards. They moved slowly, giving Diana a few seconds to think about what was going to happen before they reached her breast.

The metal heads found her nipples, and continued to turn. For a moment they were no more than a tickle against the pink buds on her chest, but then they began to press down hard. Friction between the turning metal and her nubbins turned the tickle to discomfort, and then to pain.

The screw kept turning, slower now that it had met resistance. It pushed against her breast and burrowed inwards, depressing the pale creamy globe as it did so. Forced down, Diana&#8217;s tits bulged outwards as well, pushing against the metal bands at the base of the harness. And the barbs.

The beautiful spread-eagled Amazon shuddered, feeling her breasts pushed hard onto the spikes. By then the pain in her nipples was already making her blink and inhale sharply, but now it had added to it her breast being pierced by the metal points. The screw was turning so slowly now that it rotated only once every couple of seconds, but it was enough &#8211; gods it was enough! Her aureole had been pushed almost an inch back into the round meat it perched on while the first points stabbed harder into her skin.

&#8216;Ah!&#8217;

Diana kept her eyes straight ahead but she saw Savage glance down, and felt the slight tickle of warmth across her sternum. She knew he was looking at her blood trickling down over her skin.&nbsp; 

The screws stopped. 

Diana took a shallow breath, feeling the screw heads crushing her nipples back into her breasts. The pain was similar to the agony of the demons tit-press, but different. Somehow the grotesque shape the harness forced her breasts into made it even more humiliating. That and of course that she was doing this to herself. Her mammaries throbbed painfully while her nipples felt like they were being ripped from her body. She wondered if they were bleeding yet. She wondered if Savage would mutilate her permanently.

&#8216;You said you&#8217;d let then go,&#8217; she said in a steady voice.

&#8216;I said I would let one go, when you reached the first level of pain,&#8217; he corrected. &#8216;You are not there yet, Amazon.&#8217;

The grip in her hand beeped.

&#8216;You may continue now,&#8217; he said pleasantly.

Her breasts hurt. Pressing the button would make them hurt more. Would make the pain more. A woman screamed nearby.

She pressed he button.

This time the screws didn&#8217;t both move at the same time. One twisted a quarter turn, and then stopped. After a few seconds the other followed suit. Twist and pause, twist and pause. The metal dug into her flesh and crushed her tit-nubs. The nerve ends at the tips of her breasts sent signals to her brain, letting her know she was tearing at her own body. 

Diana felt blood running down her belly. Her breasts pushed out cruelly against the metal imprisoning them. The barbs pushed through the skin and into the soft fatty tissue behind it, slicing and ripping as they went. 

&#8216;�aaaaa�nnn�&#8217;

Savage stepped so close she could make out the individual whiskers of his beard. &#8216;Such a martyr. Do you like the pain, Amazon? Do you like feeling like this, bound and helpless and suffering for me?&#8217;

The screws turned and Diana pressed her lips together. &#8216;No!&#8217; she finally panted.

&#8216;Will you stop?&#8217;

As if on cue one of the men howled in release. Diana imagined his seed gushing up into the belly of one of her sisters, or spurting across her abdomen or face. Almost at one the sound of a flame crackling and a female screaming came from the same space. Having sated his lust for sex Heatwave has happily torturing the woman he had just raped.

&#8216;No, I won&#8217;t stop,&#8217; Diana told Savage. Her breasts were screaming at her, calling her a fool. At any moment the screws would rip through her nipples and grind against her rib cage, shredding her tits from within. If she breathed deep enough the barbs all around them would cut them apart, cut them off her body like sacks of bloody meat.

A tear slid down one of her cheeks as Savage watched her pain.

&#8216;I won&#8217;t stop.&#8217;

But the screws did. They stopped, leaving her feeling impaled. She was shaking slightly, sweat and blood over her lower body. The sweat on her breasts burned into the wounds made by the barbs. Her legs where taught as her whole body hung tense. The sweat trickled down and dampened the small patch of soft dark fuzz over her sex, making the pouting lips glisten. A diamond bead formed on the opening and then dripped down, splashing on the floor as her perfect nude body shivered.

&#8216;So what do you want?&#8217; Savage asked her in whisper. Looking past the long black hair that fell partly across her eyes, she could see he was aroused. Diana had rarely seen Savage excited. It was a terrible thing to recognize. But she knew what he wanted to hear.

&#8216;I want more pain,&#8217; she told him.

The grip beeped again.

&#8216;Show me how much pain you want,&#8217; he told her.

Diana clenched her teeth as the women sobbed and screamed. Then she pressed the button.
















PART VIII

DIANA


Diana hung slack from her bonds, her body drenched in sweat. Her hair was damp with moisture and hung straight down her back and over her shoulders, some of the lank black strands clinging to the full curve of her perfect C-cup breasts.

She breathed slowly. Her muscles ached from where she had twisted for hours under the agony of the villains&#8217; tortures. She felt pummelled and sore. Her eyes were bloodshot from fatigue and tears she could not prevent.

Up in the booths, she could hear the men raping three of her Amazon sisters. Savage had taken great pleasure in telling her how the scum could only stand so much excitement from making her suffer. Every so often they would stop, and then Deathstroke&#8217;s mercenaries would bring in a trio of bound Amazon women, stripped naked. The monsters would then slake their lust on the bodies of the Diana&#8217;s helpless sisters.

A woman&#8217;s scream of pain came from the booths, followed by Electrocutioner&#8217;s coarse laughter. They liked to hurt the prisoners as they violated them. She could hear male grunts as they rutted inside women Diana had known all her life as friends and sisters. The women rarely made a sound, except when pain ripped it form them.

&#8216;They certainly seem virile,&#8217; Savage observed as he stood in front of the hanging Princess, staring up at the booths. He was wearing his tailored suit, hands behind his back. There was a flare of red light from heatwave&#8217;s part of the booth and another female scream. Savage turned and stared up at the suspended Diana. &#8216;You clearly get them quite excited.&#8217;

Diana looked at him with loathing. &#8216;I can take more, Savage,&#8217; she said. Her voice was soft but still clear. She flexed her muscles, ignoring the pain shooting through her arms and long legs. &#8216;Come on, you know you want to see me suffer.&#8217; She pushed out her chest, her breasts swelling proudly. &#8216;Show me what you have in store.&#8217;

Savage looked at her, a glimmer of lust passing across his bearded face. But then he shook his head. &#8216;You astound me, Amazon, truly. Any other woman would be so broken by her torture that she would relish the through of her best friend being raped to death if it gave her a moments escape from the pain, but you?&#8217; He chuckled. &#8216;You actually hold out that goddess body of yours for more abuse.&#8217; 

Diana pressed her red lips together, trying to think of a way to get these animals to focus on her instead of her sister Amazons. Another wail came from the booths overhead, followed by a man whooping in delight. It was only a matter of time before one of the prisoners delivered for rape was killed, either by accident or deliberately. 

&#8216;It does make me wonder though, what lengths would you go to give your sisters some respite?&#8217;

Diana looked down at him as his eyes wandered over her naked torso. They lingered on her spread thighs and the pouting pink cleft between them. She knew what he wanted to hear from her. The Princess fought the fatigue fuzzing her thoughts, trying to fine a way out of this trap. All she could think of was a way to buy more time, perhaps gives others a chance to come to their aid. Some of the most intelligent and powerful heroes on the planet were on the Island. She just had to keep her friends and family alive til their chance came. &#8216;What do you want me to do, Vandal?&#8217; she asked huskily.

&#8216;Ho-HO!&#8217; the immortal villain laughed. &#8216;I knew that you could play the temptress if properly motivated, Amazon.&#8217; He smiled appreciatively, then walked over to a console and pressed a button. There was a whine of machinery and Diana&#8217;s bonds moved, keeping her spreadeagled but lowering her towards the floor until she hung with her toes just off the surface, directly in front of her captor. She looked him in the eyes, fists clenching slightly as his own gaze wandered to her breasts. Off to one side Desaad continued to monitor her, smiling rapturously as he felt her sense of anger and dread. 

&#8216;Right now I could do anything to you, couldn&#8217;t I Diana,&#8217; he said. His smile was genial and full of evil. &#8216;Say it.&#8217;

&#8216;You could do anything to me,&#8217; she said levelly.

He stepped closer, and reached out his hand, letting it hover just over her right breast. &#8216;Do you think this is how it was for your mother?&#8217; he asked her. At the mention of her mother Diana&#8217;s face flushed with anger. &#8216;When the armies of Heracles were raping every one of your sisters just like this, do you think Hippolyta knelt before the demi-god and begged him to fuck her if he would spare her subjects?&#8217;

Diana grit her teeth, muscles moving under her fair skin. One of women in the darkness upstairs cried out and sobbed in agony.

Savage&#8217;s hand was still an inch from her flesh. &#8216;What can I do to you, Amazon?&#8217;

She kept her voice level and eyes steady. &#8216;Anything.&#8217;

His hand cupped her breast.

Diana felt his hand on her skin, on her tit, rubbing it gently. She wanted to scream, to curse. She wanted to tear free of the bands holding her and rip Savage&#8217;s arm from its socket. But she kept still, instead feeling the rage and shame bubbling up like bile from the pit of her stomach as he played with her soft womanly orb. He pressed his palm against her, forcing her nipple to push up against his hand. Diana breathed out loudly through her nose but otherwise made no sound.

&#8216;It feels glorious, Amazon,&#8217; he told her, smiling. Diana said nothing.

Savage release her breast, but stepped around behind her. Diana swallowed, aware of the shadows moving in the space above the, aware of the sound of bodies pressing together in a forced, unequal rhythm. She heard him collecting something, then he stepped up close to her, pushing her hair out of the way as his face hovered just over her right shoulder. His hands moved around in front of her and looking down she could see what he had collected.

It was a harness, set with two metal cups made of thin bronze coloured bands. The cups were narrower at the base, wider at the top, so that they ballooned outwards. Around he inside at the base the bands were studded with thin, sharp barbs, while at the apex of each was a screw that jutted out to a wing-grip almost six inches from where the twisting metal shaft protruded from the cup. The end of the screw was a flat circle a half-inch in diameter, though Diana could see that the outer edge of that circle was a sharp line of metal. There seemed to be some mechanism at the point where the screw passed in through the bands.

&#8216;This will not be mental torture that you can shield yourself from, Amazon,&#8217; Savage told her, fitting a set of straps behind her back and pulling them together through a buckle. Another set went over her shoulders. The bands settled around her breasts, tighter at the bottom so that her breasts were made to bulge upwards and outwards, filling the space. Diana could feel the barbs pricking her, threatening to pierce her skin. Except she knew it was no threat, it was a promise. &#8216;You wont be able to tell yourself this isn&#8217;t really happening.&#8217;

Diana tried to breath steadily. She looked over her shoulder at him, swallowing. &#8216;You&#8217;ll stop them,&#8217; she said. Her eyes flicked up to where her sisters had the villains cocks rutting in them.

Savage pulled on the straps, securing the vile mechanism in place. Diana knew it was no coincidence he would choose a device specifically designed to inflict pain on the anatomy of a woman. As he tugged it tighter she felt the sharpened barbs inside the bands puncture her breasts at half a dozen points, with just enough force to draw blood. She snorted softly, a slight arching of her toes all the indication of the stinging pain. 

&#8216;Yes, I will stop them, but first you must give me something.&#8217; He brushed a strand of hair from Diana&#8217;s cheek. &#8216;Tell me what I can do to you, Wonder Woman.&#8217;

Diana wet her lips, concentrating on her sisters and helping them. &#8216;You can do anything to me, Savage.&#8217; She turned and looked him in the eye. &#8216;Anything you want to do, you can do.&#8217;

&#8216;Hurt you?&#8217;

&#8216;Yes.&#8217;

&#8216;Rape you?&#8217;

Diana clenched her jaw. It doesn&#8217;t matter, she told herself. Saving lives matters. Nothing else. &#8216;Yes.&#8217;

Desaad groaned in pleasure.

Savage smiled and put his hands around her waist, sliding them across her flat belly. Diana fought the feeling of helplessness. She would find a way out of this, for all of them.

&#8216;I&#8217;m not going to rape you, Amazon,&#8217; he told her. &#8216;In the end you will beg for my cock. Not for others, but for yourself. I want to hear that surrender. I will leave just enough of you to remember what you were and to hate what you have become.&#8217; He kissed her shoulder. &#8216;But until that sweet moment, I can give you pain, Princess.&#8217;

Diana breathed gently, not wanting to push her breasts against the spikes cupping them. Her sisters were suffering and nothing else mattered at that moment.

&#8216;Do you remember what the demons did to you, Amazon,&#8217; Savage asked. &#8216;The feel of demon prick sliding into between these tits as they were crushed in a vice?&#8217;

He paused, and she realised he expected an answer. &#8216;Yes.&#8217;

Flesh slapped hard against flesh upstairs. A woman wept in shame. Her sisters. &#8216;Would you like that to happen again?&#8217;

Diana knew what he wanted. &#8216;No,&#8217; she said. 

Savage stroked the line where her breasts bulged slightly against her chest. &#8216;This pain will be different.&#8217; He touched the screws. &#8216;As these are turned, they will crush against your nipples. The tighter they are turned, the more your tits will hurt.&#8217; Diana ignored his use of vulgarity, knowing it was deliberate to humiliate her further. &#8216;The metal is hardened Prometheum alloy. Your Amazon is skin is resilient, but this will be able to twist it, tear it.&#8217; He kissed her shoulder.

Diana could hear the men grunting as they moved inside her friends. The sound of a fist slamming against flesh came from one of the booths, and the soft hiss of pain from the woman being beaten.&nbsp; She thought about what it was like for the Amazons lying there, helpless, feeling their bodies desecrated by the men&#8217;s lust-hard members moving in and out of them. She felt sick.

Suddenly she felt something pushed into her hand. It was a set of small controls, like a plastic grip four inches long with a set of buttons on the side. Instinctively she held onto them as Savage came back around in front of her.

&#8216;What can I do to you, Wonder Woman?&#8217;

&#8216;Anything,&#8217; she told him again, looking him in the eye.

&#8216;Yes,&#8217; Savage smiled through his black beard. &#8216;But I&#8217;m not going to.&#8217; He tilted his head forward. &#8216;You are.&#8217;

Diana breathed in and out. Sick. He was sick. But her sisters were depending on her.

&#8216;When you press the button at the top of the grip, the screws will turn, pushing in. You are in control of your pain &#8211; the tighter they get, the more you will hurt.&#8217; He held up a small data pad. &#8216;This will measure the signals being transmitted along your nervous system. It will tell me how much pain you are in. The other buttons add extra features to the torture.&#8217; There was a blast of electrical light and one of the women being raped screamed as her friends cried out in support. &#8216;In order to access them, you much reach a certain level of suffering.&#8217;

&#8216;I said I would let one go, when you reached the first level of pain,&#8217; he corrected. &#8216;You are not there yet, Amazon.&#8217;

The grip in her hand beeped.

&#8216;You may continue now,&#8217; he said pleasantly.

Her breasts hurt. Pressing the button would make them hurt more. Would make the pain more. A woman screamed nearby.

She pressed he button.

This time the screws didn&#8217;t both move at the same time. One twisted a quarter turn, and then stopped. After a few seconds the other followed suit. Twist and pause, twist and pause. The metal dug into her flesh and crushed her tit-nubs. The nerve ends at the tips of her breasts sent signals to her brain, letting her know she was tearing at her own body. 

Diana felt blood running down her belly. Her breasts pushed out cruelly against the metal imprisoning them. The barbs pushed through the skin and into the soft fatty tissue behind it, slicing and ripping as they went. 

&#8216;�aaaaa�nnn�&#8217;

Savage stepped so close she could make out the individual whiskers of his beard. &#8216;Such a martyr. Do you like the pain, Amazon? Do you like feeling like this, bound and helpless and suffering for me?&#8217;

The screws turned and Diana pressed her lips together. &#8216;No!&#8217; she finally panted.

&#8216;Will you stop?&#8217;

As if on cue one of the men howled in release. Diana imagined his seed gushing up into the belly of one of her sisters, or spurting across her abdomen or face. Almost at one the sound of a flame crackling and a female screaming came from the same space. Having sated his lust for sex Heatwave has happily torturing the woman he had just raped.

&#8216;No, I won&#8217;t stop,&#8217; Diana told Savage. Her breasts were screaming at her, calling her a fool. At any moment the screws would rip through her nipples and grind against her rib cage, shredding her tits from within. If she breathed deep enough the barbs all around them would cut them apart, cut them off her body like sacks of bloody meat.

A tear slid down one of her cheeks as Savage watched her pain.

&#8216;I won&#8217;t stop.&#8217;

But the screws did. They stopped, leaving her feeling impaled. She was shaking slightly, sweat and blood over her lower body. The sweat on her breasts burned into the wounds made by the barbs. Her legs where taught as her whole body hung tense. The sweat trickled down and dampened the small patch of soft dark fuzz over her sex, making the pouting lips glisten. A diamond bead formed on the opening and then dripped down, splashing on the floor as her perfect nude body shivered.

&#8216;So what do you want?&#8217; Savage asked her in whisper. Looking past the long black hair that fell partly across her eyes, she could see he was aroused. Diana had rarely seen Savage excited. It was a terrible thing to recognize. But she knew what he wanted to hear.

&#8216;I want more pain,&#8217; she told him.

The grip beeped again.

&#8216;Show me how much pain you want,&#8217; he told her.

Diana clenched her teeth as the women sobbed and screamed. Then she pressed the button.















Part IX

Big Barda

Barda blinked, feeling the fingers touching between her legs, pushing into the folds of her sex. She knew the feeling, remembering it from as long back as she could remember. Before her training as one of the Female Furies, as one of Darksied&#8217;s elite, she had been just another of the lowlies peopling Apokolips. To them degradation and pain were ways of life, as ever-present as air.

And then when she had been selected for training, her suffering had increased. She was strong, physically powerful. She was a match for any three of the males she had been thrown among. It had taken eight of them to subdue her the first time she had been raped in the barracks, and even then three of them had not lived to brag about the experience. They would have beaten her to death that first time, except for Granny&#8217;s rules forbidding it. Only she decided when a trainee would be allowed to die for Darksied&#8217;s glorious name.

The rapes and beatings were part of Barda&#8217;s training. That she endured them served to winnow her from the weaker members. And as she grew stronger, more skilled in combat, more willing to meet out pain than to endure it, her suffering became less. 

She was still tortured. Sometimes Granny would have even her strongest warriors brought to Desaad&#8217;s pain chambers. The agony Barda was subjected to there prevented her from growing soft, and she helped strap her companions into the torture machines as freely as she was locked into them herself.

Which was why she didn&#8217;t panic now. She was bound to a heavy metal frame, arms straight out beside her and legs spread wide. She was naked, her armour lying off to the side as a way to taunt her. They had left her with her helmet, its black alloy covering sweeping up and around her hair like an ancient Pharonic headdress and the gold side-plates framing her stern, beautiful features.

Barda watched the men taking in the sight of her body as she was violated. At seven feet tall she would have towered over many of them. Killer Croc, the huge reptilian villain, watched her with a lust at odds with his cold-blooded nature. 

Nearby, the Crime Doctor was watching proceedings with a far more clinical appraisal. True he could appreciate the pleasing aesthetics of the prisoner. The alien woman, or goddess depending on ones philosophical outlook, was a magnificent physical specimen. Taller and more muscular than any of the other female heroes, with a form that was the perfect blend of body builder and sex star. No doubt she could have made millions posing as a fitness model or working as a professional wrestler. Her breasts were firm but full enough to warrant inspection, and the outline of her abdominal muscles just pronounced enough to be arousing without intimidating, exactly the same as the muscles in her arms and wonderfully long legs. If Wonder Woman was the perfect Amazon warrior, then Barda was the very personification of a Goddess of War, beautiful and deadly.

But even that recognition was a clinical one. The Doctor was not one given to poetry or sexual passions, but he prided himself a keen study of human nature. He understood what a woman such as this was to the less enlightened men, and more what she expected of those men surrounding her. She was as strong emotionally and psychologically as she was physically. AND she had been raised on a world that had tested her with torture that was perfected as both science and art.

Which begged the question &#8211; how to cause true suffering a being whose whole existence was a testament to her being indomitable? How did break a woman who had been tortured by supposedly the most ingenious pain givers in the entire universe?

But the Crime Doctor was no stranger to sadism either, and especially the most fundamental rule, and sadly overlooked by amateurs. That torture, real torture, occurred in the mind of the victim. The body was merely a convenient path to that goal in most cases, but there were other ways besides simple physical pain to get what one needed.

The surgically-masked villain came to stand by Barda&#8217;s face, holding up a data pad with information displayed in bright yellow and blue. &#8216;You know, we thought we had accounted for all the super-heroine types on the Island when we took over, but somehow you, Supergirl, and the others in your little group went undetected.&#8217; He looked up from the pad to the beautiful prisoner. &#8216;I don&#8217;t suppose you&#8217;d like to spare yourself needless unpleasantness and just tell me how that happened?&#8217;

Barda smiled, looking straight into the star framed sunglasses that hid his eyes. &#8216;Little man, do you think this performance is going to impress me?&#8217; She chuckled. &#8216;You and your friends here can do whatever your pathetic worst is. I have survived Apokalips. When this is done, I will pick my teeth with your ribs.&#8217;

The other villains growled; some angrily, some appreciatively. All had a sense of anticipation about them. 

&#8216;Dear lady, believe me I have nothing but the utmost respect for the work of your home planet in the arena of interrogation,&#8217; the Doctor said, smiling behind his mask. &#8216;That is why we are taking a different route.&#8217;

The fingers between Barda&#8217;s legs pulled at her pussy lips spreading them wider. She didn&#8217;t even blink. &#8216;Rape, you mean?&#8217; she said, scoffingly. &#8216;Even if these scum you&#8217;ve collected counted as males, the barracks training of Granny Goodness would designate this as rest time.&#8217;

Killer Croc growled, and she looked over at him. &#8216;Did I hurt your feelings, lizard boy?&#8217; Barda chuckled, and shifted her eyes to between his legs. &#8216;I guess your kind really do get sluggish in the cold.&#8217;

The scaled murderer took a step forward, all eight feet of him bristling danger. &#8216;Let me at this bitch,&#8217; he spat, smiling a mouth full of fangs. &#8216;We&#8217;ll see if she&#8217;s clever while I&#8217;m eating her tongue.&#8217;

&#8216;Now, now, Mr Jones,&#8217; the Doctor said, referring Killer Croc by his family name, &#8216;there are others here besides yourself eager to savour Mrs Free&#8217;s company.&#8217; He looked down at Barda. &#8216;You are the wife of Scott Free, yes?&#8217;

The fingers inside her pulled her outer lips back as far as they would stretch, and Barda felt the cool air of the room wafting across her exposed sex. She looked up at the bespectacled man and said nothing.

&#8216;I wonder how well he knows you,&#8217; the Crime Doctor said. &#8216;Let&#8217;s find out.&#8217;

Something touched her clitoris, and Barda braced herself mentally for the pain to begin. Of course these men would start there. Pathetic. She almost felt a little disappointed. She had heard rumours of this man&#8217;s reputation and had expected him to begin with something less obvious. The thing touching her nerve cluster wrapped around it and Barda wondered if it was a claw. It felt soft, even organic. There was a slight tickle.

The men watching blinked in surprise as the naked giantess suddenly went rigid, every muscles in her body spasming. Her eyes went wide and her mouth opened in a silent scream as she shook on the table, panting heavily as her incredibly body trembled in its bonds.

&#8216;What you&#8217;re feeling,&#8217; the Doctor said to her amiably, &#8216;is one of these.&#8217; He held up the small purple starfish in front of her face as she made noises somewhere between choking and retching. Her blue eyes looked at it without blinking. &#8216;It&#8217;s a form of the Starro lifeform &#8211; I think you are probably aware of its mind control abilities. It does so by direct access to an organism&#8217;s nervous system. Usually the brain, but as you&#8217;re discovering it can attach itself to any part of the network of nerves running through the body.&#8217; 

Barda heaved up, hands clawing at the air as her breasts shook. Her head twisted to one side. A deep groan came from her mouth as she closed her eyes tight. 

&#8216;Right now the little Starro is extending its tiny feelers into the clitoral nerve cluster inside your vagina. It can stimulate the cluster with any type of sensation, but for our purposes there is one specific kind that we want.&#8217;

Barda trembled, biting her lip. The men watching smiled as the muscles in her legs and thighs quivered, tight as steel bands. She grit her teeth as her sex hovered above the table. The warrior goddess clenched her hands tight. The buds of her nipples were upraised and diamond hard. Between her legs the lips of her pussy were flushed and swollen. 

&#8216;Pleasure, Ms Barda,&#8217; the Crime Doctor was telling her. He reached out a rubber-gloved hand and played with one of her nipples. Barda groaned in response. &#8216;The Starro is flooding your nervous system with signals designed to stimulate your pleasure centres. Your &#8211; sexual responses.&#8217; Barda opened her eyes and looked at him with disgust but also some fear. &#8216;What do you think it would feel like for me to hold you just short of orgasm for an hour. Then for a day.&#8217; He leaned closer. &#8216;Am I impressing you yet?&#8217;

Barda sucked in a breath, making her breasts rise. Aside from the Crime Doctor every man in the room was painfully aroused, but not so much as the black-haired beauty on the table. She could feel her sex muscles clenching against her will, desperate for release of the fire burning through her loins and washing outwards through her body. &#8216;Never�tell you anything,&#8217; she panted.

&#8216;We&#8217;ll see,&#8217; he said, patting her arm. &#8216;Role the cameras,&#8217; she said aloud. &#8216;We don&#8217;t want to miss any of this. I&#8217;m sure her husband is going to be fascinated by it.&#8217;

Barda gave a savage growl and slammed her helmeted head back against the metal table, heaving in her bonds. Her arms turned into twisting knots of incredible strength but she couldn&#8217;t escape. She tried unsuccessfully to control her breathing as Killer Croc stepped up between her legs. In height he would have loomed over even Barda&#8217;s seven-foot frame, were she standing. Every inch of him was rippling muscle under shimmering green hide, with not an ounce of fat. The massive coils of his arms moved like serpents under his skin as he flexed, powerful chest expanding as he smiled with a teeth full of razor sharp fangs. Like the other men his cock was hard, a shaft of tiny interlocking scales nine inches long and as thick as a normal man&#8217;s wrist.

&#8216;Yeah, you&#8217;re gonna like this bitch,&#8217; Croc said with a vindictive sneer. The bulbous green head of his shaft rubbed against Barda&#8217;s pussy lips and she shuddered. Her eyes fixed on the roof above her, trying to focus past the terrible feelings of lust that were coursing through her. Croc kept his cock dick pressed against her, rubbing it over the outside of her sex. The warrior woman closed her eyes and bit her lip. 

&#8216;You want him, don&#8217;t you Barda?&#8217; the Crime Doctor purred. &#8216;I can see the physiological responses now &#8211; the swelling in the breasts, the way you aureoles are tightening.&#8217; Croc smiled and leaned over, his forked tongue flicking out over Barda&#8217;s erect nipples. A tiny gasp came from her lips. &#8216;Can you feel yourself getting wet yet, Barda? Is your vagina thinking about what it will be like when Croc her pushes himself inside you.&#8217;

&#8216;Damn you,&#8217; Barda whispered.

&#8216;I wonder if you&#8217;ll be able to stop yourself from fucking him like a low born whore in heat?&#8217;

&#8216;DAMN YOU!&#8217; she shouted at him, turning her eyes on the little man next to her. The blue orbs blazed with volcanic fury. 

&#8216;I think she must be talking to you, Mr Jones,&#8217; the Doctor smiled. &#8216;Don&#8217;t keep a lady waiting.&#8217;

Croc laughed, moving back his hips and pushing forward.

The hate in Barda&#8217;s eyes was almost a physical presence in the room as the reptilian villain&#8217;s phallus pushed past the lips of the prisoners&#8217; sex and slid deep inside her. Clear moisture leaked from the base of Barda&#8217;s sex as he pulled out and pushed in again, even deeper, and began a steady rhythmic fucking.

&#8216;Why yes, you are wet,&#8217; the Doctor chuckled. &#8216;I guess our little friend on your clitoris is working quite well. Or is it just that Croc is so much better than your husband.&#8217;

On the table Barda groaned, her eyes shut tight. Her body was rigid as her tits moved to the time of Croc&#8217;s penis sliding smoothly in and out of her cunt.&nbsp; &#8216;Oh, she is tight!&#8217; the villain snarled. His hands on her hips dug in, the claws drawing blood. &#8216;Bitch can squeeze like a vice! Yeah, do it, slut.&#8217; He slammed into her hard and drew a groan from his victim that was both pleasure and horror. &#8216;Show me what you got, baby!&#8217;

She twisted, trying to get leverage to break the bands. The attempt failed and her movements only rubbed her pussy harder against his invading shaft and filled her with feelings of wonderful disgust. He was raping her, taking her against her will, but the pounding ecstasy in her sex was unbearably sweet. As his serpent cock slammed brutally in and out of her part her yearned to wrap her legs around him and fuck him wildly. Barda hated it, hated herself for feeling it, but the desire was like claws tearing at her flesh, shredding her resolve. She tried to think of her hate, and that did nothing to stop the need between her legs. She tried to think of Scott, her husband that she loved, and that was worse than useless.

Croc leaned over her, pushing his dick fully inside her and giving little thrusts with his hips. His penis was massive &#8211; a normal woman would have been screaming in agony as its girth tore her apart from inside. The foul smell of snake washed over her. The alien thing on her clitoris sent its wild pulses through her, making her pant. When the villains hard muscled body rubbed against her own her sweat made them slide against each other.

&#8216;That&#8217;s it, meat,&#8217; Croc whispered. &#8216;Give it up!&#8217;

&#8216;I&#8217;ll kill you,&#8217; she hissed at him. Her hands were clenched so hard her palms bled from her own nails. He twisted his hips, grinding in her and smiling as she clenched her teeth as well. Reaching up her grabbed one of her full breasts and pulled it up to his mouth. His teeth closed around it, slicing into her flesh. Blood sprang up around the wounds and he pressed his mouth to her skin, sucking hard. There was pain where he bit her and she loved it. Her breast was throbbing and burning as her hips jerked against her will, and the spasms in her sex came faster and harder.

&#8216;What a whore,&#8217; one of the men watching said. 

&#8216;Get this part,&#8217; the Crime Doctor said happily to the camera operators. &#8216;I&#8217;ve never seen a goddess orgasm before.&#8217;

Barda wanted to scream in hate but the sound coming from her throat was different entirely, throaty and gasping. Tears spilled from eyes that had never known them. NO NO she thought, but it was no good. Croc&#8217;s thrusts turned wild as his climax built, and with all her strength she lifted her hips. It was all she could do not to push herself onto his cock to make herself cum, but somehow she held herself steady, except for the way her body moved to his thrusts.&nbsp; Croc&#8217;s hips pushed deep one, then twice�

On the third thrust he let go of her tit and roared as he came. Barda felt her cunt turn molten as he spurted his seed into her, and her own climax exploded out from where he was raping her. She felt her pussy muscles clamp around his shaft so tight he screamed again, feeling her cunt grasping at him, milking him of his seed. Barda&#8217;s lip bled as she bit down on it to keep her own cry of vile ecstasy inside. But her body arched, her nipples riding her heaving breasts as she shook under him. Sweat ran off her body in rivers and the climax went on and on.

Finally she relaxed, and he pulled out of her. &#8216;Damn!&#8217; Croc laughed. &#8216;That is one awesome fuck!&#8217;

&#8216;And even while holding something back,&#8217; the surgical masked sadist next to the table observed. &#8216;I wonder what she&#8217;ll rut like when her control breaks completely?&#8217;

The stink of reptile and semen was all over her, but almost immediately Barda felt again the deep throbbing on her clitoris. The starro was still stimulating her, pushing her back towards desire. As the hairy giant called Mammoth stepped forward she felt the need for his battering ram cock to get inside her and fill her.

&#8216;Me next,&#8217; he said in a deep voice. &#8216;I don&#8217;t wanna miss what they&#8217;re doing to Starfire.&#8217;

&#8216;A man after my own heart,&#8217; the Crime Doctor said. &#8216;And I&#8217;m sure Barda appreciates your eagerness to get started.&#8217; He looked at her. &#8216;Isn&#8217;t that right?&#8217; he asked.

Barda said nothing. Her entire mind was on murder, and the feeling of fire racing across her skin, and the unbearable need to cum again.
