    By Sailor 861   
Chapter 1: The Beginning   
Moira MacPeak's sex life with her husband, Graham, needed some spark.&nbsp;After
  15 years of marriage, the electricity of intimacy had dimmed and Moira was
  determined to fix it.  
She loved Graham -- they were married just after grammar school in their
  small town in western Scotland -- but sex in recent years had become a strictly
  so-so, Saturday night routine, devoid of excitement, adventure, experimentation
  and, most important, lust.  
But the day she saw her best friend and next-door neighbour, Isabel Metcalfe,
  answer the door in blouse, skirt and ankle chains, Moira, a trim, 33-year-old
  Scotswoman and mother of two teenagers, knew that bondage would someday play
  an important part in her sexuality and her marriage.  
Two days after Isabel Metcalfe, 35, and mother of two boys, had ankle chains
  mysteriously welded on during a drive home, June 11, 1975, Moira, who also
  had two sons, now in the RN, visited her to find out why she had phoned in
  sick at the mill the day before.&nbsp;After the initial shock of seeing her
  best friend in chains, she recovered sufficiently to listen as Isabel explained
  her strange encounter on a local county road that night.&nbsp;Moira could scarcely
  believe her ears. Shocked at first, her surprise turned to sexual energy and
  curiosity when Isabel told her plainly that, while the chains were initially
  scary in their steel-grey appearance and implacability, they did add new intensity
  to her lovemaking with her boyfriend, Peter, who would soon be her husband.  
Two days later, when Isabel was just as mysteriously kidnapped and taken,
  bound, chained and gagged, to East Africa then returned miraculously to Scotland
  relatively unscathed a few days later, Moira put any further discussion about
  bondage and chains on the &quot;back burner&quot; until Isabel had recovered
  sufficiently from her ordeal and things in the Metcalfe household were relatively
  back to normal.  
After a couple of weeks, Moira and Graham were delighted to be asked by Isabel
  and Peter to be matron of honour and best man at their civic marriage ceremony
  at the town hall a month later.&nbsp;Moira was mildly shocked when Isabel told
  her she was going to wear a knee-length bridal dress that would put her 18-in.
  steel ankle restraints in full public view for the first time -- and at the
  town hall.  
A full-length front-page photo of Isabel and Peter appeared the next day
  in the town's daily, under the headline Local Woman Ties the Knot
  -- In Chains  , and the picture and accompanying page 1 article
  indicated to Moira -- and the entire town -- that Isabel was not a woman to
  be trifled with.&nbsp;&quot;If I choose to wear these ankle chains in public
  and, quite possibly, for the rest of my life, so be it,&quot; Isabel was quoted
  as saying in the article.&nbsp;&quot;They were put on me mysteriously, it's
  still a mystery how they might come off -- I just don't know -- and so I am
  resolved to make the most of my life with these on me.&nbsp; 
"They really don't stop me from doing anything, except horseback riding or
  bicycling, but I have neither a horse nor a bicycle, so I am not particularly
  worried.&quot;&nbsp;Townsfolk and news media audiences throughout Scotland
  and the UK had read, or watched and listened to electronic reports of Isabel's
  experiences as the victim of a daring, yet brutal transcontinental kidnapping
  plot and her subsequent escape -- in chains, no less --&nbsp;from a group of
  mad scientists in the East African desert.  
Moira was proud of her friend's feats of bravery and determination in the
  face of such incredible odds; indeed, Moira glowed with pride when Isabel informed
  her following the wedding that the University of Edinburgh had offered her
  employment as a lab assistant/consultant in the engineering faculty's metallurgy
  division and that she was being considered for nomination by the university
  to a British order of bravery to recognize her &quot;native Scottish determination,
  resolve and resourcefulness&quot; in helping engineer her own escape, in the
  face of incredible odds, and for assisting Scotland Yard and Interpol in bringing
  the key operatives of the Centre of Excellence for Genetic Engineering to justice.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
(It was later reported that Amina, the genetics engineer, received 25 years;
  Sheikh, the doctor,10 years, and Omar, the economist, five years in an East
  African maximum security institution.&nbsp;Read Through Night to
  Light  for more details).  
At home, Moira was devastated by the news of her friend's kidnap; even more
  so when details of her African desert ordeal came to light later -- in Isabel's
  own words -- that were uttered in strict confidence to Moira only.  
Isabel had arrived home in rural western Scotland during the third week of
  June, 1975, from East Africa via the airports at Tangier, Morocco; Heathrow,
  London; and Prestwick, Scotland, barefoot, chained and dressed only in dusty
  blouse and skirt. Her short, 18-in. strides, enforced by her chains, and her
  chafed neck, elbows, wrists and knees were the visible evidences of her recent,
  harsh bondage.&nbsp;Clearly, she could not give her friend time for the needed
  consolations and confidences each woman needed so badly after the harrowing
  incidents.&nbsp; 
Isabel had a series of medical appointments, interviews at the University
  of Edinburgh, statements to the police, media interviews and, finally, arrangements
  for the civic marriage ceremony, the wedding itself, and a brief honeymoon
  before she would start work at the university.  
In fact, it was not until August 12, 1975, before Moira finally got the opportunity
  to talk to Isabel, woman-to-woman, about her experiences in the desert, her
  long, enforced bondages and, especially, the effect Isabel's shackles were
  having on her love life.  
&quot;Isabel?&nbsp;It's me, Moira,&quot; she said into the telephone in her
  pin-neat kitchen on a Saturday morning.&nbsp;&quot;Can you spare me a couple
  of minutes from your busy schedule?&nbsp;I know you've been busy with the university,
  the news media, Peter and . . .&quot;  
&quot;Moira, you come right over,&quot; Isabel replied.&nbsp;&quot;It's been
  so long since we had a cuppa and a chat.&nbsp;Please, Mo, come over now.&nbsp;I've
  wanted to talk to you so long.&quot;  
Moira got dressed in her casual weekend wear -- jeans, blouse and sweater
  --&nbsp;and walked, to gather her thoughts, down the quarter-mile to Isabel's
  and Peter's house while her husband, Graham, was at work in town.&nbsp; 
Her thoughts collected from the short walk, Moira bounded up the front steps
  of Isabel's and Peter's bungalow, rang the bell and Isabel answered, smiling,
  wearing a light, knee-length summer skirt, sandals and her ever-present ankle
  chains.&nbsp;Little did she realize at the time that, after a sexy vacation
  in northern Scotland, she would have to give up bounding up the stairs for
  a long, long time.  
Moira could not help but notice Isabel's chains instantly and made a mental
  note about the ease in which her friend moved about with 18-inch steps and
  the silvery clink of metal on the polished hardwood floors.&nbsp;Isabel gave
  her pal a warm hug and invited her into the kitchen.  
The abrasions and ligature marks on her friend's neck, elbows, wrists, knees
  and ankles had all but disappeared, Moira noted, and she began.&nbsp;&quot;Isabel,
  you told me already about the night of June 11, but very little of the events
  that occurred afterward and that can wait,&quot; Moira said over tea and fresh-baked
  scones at Isabel's kitchen table.&nbsp;&quot;But can I be frank?&nbsp;I have
  to tell you, honestly, I've been thinking of getting a pair of chains like
  yours to put a bit of spark in our 'you-know-what'.&nbsp;When I first saw you
  in your chains that afternoon in June, the day before I took your letter of
  resignation to the mill, it made me feel a little 'goosey' all over and I think
  I would like to try the experience.&nbsp;Just once, anyway...&nbsp;So can you
  tell me a little bit about what it's like to wear them?&nbsp;You don't have
  to be really explicit; just give me a bit of inside info, you know, that I
  might be able to use with Graham.&quot;&nbsp;Moira carefully avoided mention
  of the kidnapping and terrifying experiences in the East African desert, waiting
  for her friend to initiate discussion about those times.  
Isabel was only too pleased to tell her friend about what it's like to walk
  about all day with chained ankles -- &quot;like wearing a tight, straight skirt
  all the time&quot; -- and going in public in chains is no longer the gut-wrenching
  embarrassment it used to be -- &quot;let 'em look, and admire; that's all I
  can say.&nbsp;If women are afraid, appalled or embarrassed at seeing me chained
  up, that's their problem.&nbsp; 
"I know I've been getting some admiring glances from the younger men and
  some older women in town but that's as far as it goes.  
&quot;Moira, that night, June 11,&quot; Isabel continued, &quot;something
  strange happened to me and my sexuality.&nbsp;Ever since then, the chains have
  made me extremely 'sexed-up', you know, whenever I'm with Peter.&nbsp;And what's
  more, Dr. Hall, my family physician, told me since I've come back from Africa
  I've developed muscle tone 'down there' -- something he calls the pelvic-floor
  muscle group -- that would make a 20-year-old woman envious.&nbsp;And I've
  had two boys, too, don't forget!  
&quot;I don't know what happened to me that night but someone or something,
  somewhere, improved the way I am able to have sex and, unquestionably the chains
  have been a part of it; and these too,&quot; Isabel said, pointing to her ripe
  breasts.  
&quot;Not only were my ankles shackled but my nipples were pierced, too;
  by some process even Dr. Hall couldn't identify, although he did say something
  about laser cautery or something like that.&nbsp; 
"Anyway, the rings in my nippies are there to stay, just as these are,&quot; Isabel
  said, shaking her ankles under the kitchen table with a light clatter of links
  on the vinyl flooring.  
&quot;And you know what?&nbsp;&nbsp;I haven't worn a bra since that night.&nbsp;It
  feels great and I don't care if I ever put one on again.&nbsp;And I'll tell
  you, when my boobs are shaking too much when I'm doing physical activity, I
  just tie 'em together with a locket chain through the rings in my nips.&nbsp;And
  when the strenuous activity is over, I just unlock them and go back to the
  way I was.&quot;  
Moira was all eyes and ears as Isabel related more -- but not all -- details
  about her kidnapping, her six hours in an extremely tight hogtie, the adventures
  in the desert and her miraculous escape.&nbsp;It sounded to Moira like a story
  from 1001 Arabian Nights  and she wanted to feel part
  of the adventure for herself.  
&quot;My God, Isabel, I would not want to be bound they way you were,&quot; Moira
  exclaimed. &quot;How did you manage?&nbsp;But your chains -- where could I
  get some like that, anyway?&nbsp;I'd like to start experimenting with Graham,
  you know, and...&quot;  
&quot;I don't know where you could find a pair like these, Moira, but you
  and I could go down to MacEwan's hardware store today and buy you a chain and
  a pair of locks to get you started.&nbsp;As for my hogtie on the plane, let
  me tell you it was painful but I had something inside me to keep me company.&nbsp;It
  was more than my Scottish upbringing could handle and, well, that's all I'll
  say about that for the time being.&quot;  
Moira nodded and agreed without hesitation to make the trip in town with
  her chained companion.&nbsp;They finished their tea and scones, chattering
  excitedly about their upcoming shopping excursion.&nbsp;Peter was also at work
  but Moira said she had the car and would walk home, return for Isabel in a
  few moments for the big trip to the hardware store -- and her entry into the
  new world of bondage.  
Isabel was waiting for Moira to drive up 15 minutes later and, soon, the
  best friends were on their way into town, past the spot where, unknown to all,
  Isabel had been &quot;intercepted, restrained, examined, treated and released&quot; by
  members of the crew of a spacecraft from the planet Venusias, which had ventured
  off an interplanetary course over western Scotland two months previously. Craft
  DDE224-A was never heard from again, either over Scotland or at Blintz, its
  homeport at Venusias, 200 light-years from Earth.  
&quot;There's the spot, right there, where I saw a bright light that lifted
  me right out of the car, took me somewhere and put me back, I don't know how
  long after, with these on my ankles and the rings in my tits,&quot; Isabel
  said, gesturing to the roadside as they drove south into town.&nbsp;Isabel
  slowed down, the two women looked out the windows and saw only the road, gravel
  shoulders and green fields beyond -- nothing else of note -- and they continued
  to MacEwan's hardware store in the town's commercial section. Isabel's enigma
  was as insoluble as ever.  
&quot;Golly, Isabel, I hope there's not too many people in the store today;
  I don't want everybody to know I'm buying chains for myself, you know.&quot;  
&quot;Worry wart,&quot; Isabel replied with a smile and nod to her pal.&nbsp;&quot;Who's
  going to know -- unless you tell them?&nbsp;It could be a bicycle lock you're
  buying.&nbsp;And besides, look at me; I'm chained all the time and it hardly
  bothers me at all now.&nbsp; 
The chains seem to bother other people, particularly the young guys and some
  women, but not me.&nbsp;They look at my ankles, then my breasts and back down
  again.&nbsp;I doubt some of those jerks even know what I look like from the
  shoulders up,&quot; Isabel said with a shrug.  
Isabel and Moira found the little hardware store, Moira parked her little
  white Ford Escort in the adjoining parking lot and the two got out to walk
  the short distance into the brightly-lit interior of the hardware store.&nbsp;Moira
  noticed she had to slow down to accommodate her friend's chained, clinking
  progress  
Isabel's &quot;plight,&quot; as the news media called it, was well known
  to the townsfolk and she was treated with a mix of curiosity, deference and
  sympathy by most people who came in contact with her.&nbsp;Inside the store,
  Isabel went up to the proprietor and said:&nbsp;&quot;Angus, where do you keep
  your chain?&quot;&nbsp; 
Angus MacEwan, 36, a married father of two teenaged girls,&nbsp;looked at
  Isabel and Moira, then back at Isabel with a slight smile,&nbsp;and pointed
  to the left, saying &quot;Aisle 2, near the end on the left; six reels, ladies.&nbsp;There's
  galvanized, stainless steel, zinc-plated and regular, hardened steel; three
  different sizes and weights.&nbsp;What're you using it for, Isabel?&quot;  
&quot;Bicycle lock,&quot; Isabel replied quickly and easily as Moira looked
  down, suddenly red-faced.&nbsp;Angus didn't believe her.&nbsp;&quot;Bicycle
  locks are over here, on the right,&quot; he said.  
Isabel insisted on visiting the chain display although Moira was ready to
  dig herself a hole and hide as Angus took the two women down the aisle to explain
  each type of chain, its potential uses, safe working loads (SWL), diameter,
  weight, link shape, corrosion resistance and other properties.  
It was all too much for Moira and she nearly ran out of the store.&nbsp;Isabel
  held her hand as they walked down the aisle, Angus leading, and Isabel whispered:  
&quot;Don't you chicken out, now, Moira.&nbsp;We'll get the chain, the locks
  and we'll be out of here faster'n you can say Jack Spratt.&quot;  
Moira groaned in embarrassment and put her hand to her face but kept going
  down the aisle.&nbsp;The three stopped in front of the chain reels and Moira
  looked away, red-faced.&nbsp;Isabel piped up: &quot;How much is that one, Angus?&quot;  
&quot;Aye, that's the NeveRust   1/8th-in. galvanized
  steel, SWL one ton,&quot; he replied.&nbsp;&quot;Fifty pence for three feet.&quot;  
&quot;We'll take it!&quot; Moira blurted, thinking only of the bargain price..&nbsp;Angus
  reached for the cutters and snipped off a length for the attractive brunette
  with her shackled companion.&nbsp;&quot;Anything else, ladies?&quot; the shopkeeper
  asked, handing the small bundle of links to Moira who accepted it shakily.&nbsp;Angus
  smiled in tacit recognition of her discomfort.  
&quot;Two locks, please, Angus, &quot; Isabel said quietly.&nbsp;Angus' smile
  broadened slightly as he handed Isabel two brass-bodied, stainless-steel-shackle
  padlocks from a shelf near the reels of chain.  
&nbsp;&quot;These are the best of the lot,&quot; Angus said.&nbsp;&quot;One
  pound each and they'll last a lifetime.&nbsp;Rustproof, too.&quot;  
Moira was mortified as Isabel handed her the sturdy, little locks and the
  three went to the cash to pay for their purchases, which came to two pounds,
  50p -- a fair price for ankle chains, Isabel thought -- a good buy which accorded
  well with to the women's Scottish perspicacity.  
Moira was literally panting with anxiety while Isabel was all smiles as the
  two walked out of the hardware store, around the corner into the parking lot
  and to the car, Isabel's ankle chains clinking loudly on the concrete sidewalk.&nbsp;Pedestrians
  passed and slowed to watch Isabel make her slow, chained progress into the
  parking lot.&nbsp;Isabel did not notice but Moira was upset.  
&quot;Now that wasn't all that bad, was it, Mo.?&quot; Isabel asked her friend
  solicitously, as Moira, frowning, shifted into reverse to back out of the parking
  lot.&nbsp;&quot;Not too hard for you, no, Isabel Metcalfe.&nbsp;I was embarrassed
  stiff; this is only my first time with chains, you know; here, you've had loads
  of practice and I'm just starting out.&quot;  
&quot;Starting out, aye,&quot; Isabel agreed, patting her friend on the shoulder.&nbsp;&quot;You'll
  be just fine, you wait and see.&nbsp;Imagine what Graham's going to say in
  bed tonight!&nbsp;Hee-hee!&quot;  
Moira turned beet-red at the thought of her clinking her way into their bedroom
  tonight, her trim, tanned ankles chained for the first time.&nbsp; 
She wondered what Graham would say.&nbsp;She wondered how it was going to
  feel.&nbsp;She also wondered what it might be like to be chained for life --
  like her friend.  
The two friends left the little brown paper bag of chain and locks on the
  seat as they continued a bit more shopping in town, during which time Moira
  picked out a beautiful, semi-sheer ankle-length nightgown she was certain was
  bound to please.  
Isabel agreed it was nice and was about to broach the topic of a suitable
  loincloth, such as the one she was currently wearing, but decided this would
  not be the proper time.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;After shopping, it was time for a bit of lunch and Isabel thought back
  to her first trip into a pub, months ago in Edinburgh, in chains with Peter...
  and that cretin two tables away.&nbsp;She frowned at the recall but put it
  out of her mind easily as the two attractive, casually well-dressed women found
  a table at a downtown steakhouse.&nbsp;Isabel slid in with her customary clink
  and Moira joined her at the table for two.  
&quot;I can't get over how natural you walk around and do things in chains,
  Is.,&quot; Moira said to her friend as she sipped at her water.&nbsp;&quot;Are
  you sure you weren't born to be in chains?&quot;  
Isabel chuckled and commented that while she was not meant to be shackled,
  she was determined they would not interrupt her life, or her new career, or
  her marriage.&nbsp;&quot;I'll make do and make out,&quot; Isabel said softly.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
After a small lunch of ground steak, chips, cole slaw and tea, Isabel was
  anxious to get home to finish the Saturday housework.&nbsp;She found it took
  a little longer now than before.&nbsp; 
Moira had done hers already but she was equally anxious to get to her house
  to try on her latest acquisitions -- a sexy, long nightgown and ankle chains
  -- and practise walking like her best friend to see what sort of effects it
  would have on her and her husband's libidos.  
She wasn't long finding out.  
Chapter 2: Moira's Introduction to Chains   
Moira MacPeak dropped off Isabel at her front door, gave her a hug goodbye
  until Monday and continued home a short distance away.&nbsp; Driving in, she
  put the car in park, turned off the engine, picked up her packages and walked
  into the house straight to the master bedroom.  
She dropped the little bag of chain on the bed, unfolded her new nightgown
  and sat on the bed looking at herself in the dressing table mirror.&nbsp; &quot;What
  the heck, I've come this far so I may as well put 'em on and see what I look
  like,&quot; Moira said, running her hands through her medium-brown hair, then
  pushing up her 36-C breasts to see how they looked in exaggerated fashion.  
&quot;Na-aw, that's not me,&quot; she said, dropping her breasts.&nbsp; &quot;Is.
  doesn't wear a bra; maybe I'll try going like that, too.&nbsp; It's August,
  after all, and some women in town are going without so it shouldn't be a great
  surprise to anyone,&quot; she said, suddenly self-conscious.  
Moira looked at her 33-year-old body critically as she undressed slowly to
  put on the nightgown to check for fit, appearance and sex appeal.  
Naked in a late afternoon for the first time in many years, she looked at
  her 5-ft. 4-in., 118-lb. body, noting the flat stomach, slightly pendulous
  breasts, long, light-brown nipples with medium-sized aureoles and her long,
  muscular legs and athletic body she had acquired from years of grammar-school
  girl's rugby.&nbsp;  
She turned toward the bed, stood and pulled the long, sandy-coloured nightgown
  over her head and smoothed it over her hips, picking at the skinny shoulder
  straps as she turned to examine her profile in the mirror.  
&quot;Hm-m, not too bad at all, especially after two children and 15 years
  of marriage,&quot; Moira said to no one in particular.&nbsp; She caressed her
  breasts through the smooth silky bodice and noticed her half-inch-long nipples
  grow suddenly erect, with a noticeable tingle in her bosom.  
&quot;Ah-h, that's the ticket,&quot; Moira said, as she sat on the bed, feeling
  her breasts bounce slightly as she reached for the little pile of grey-silver,
  galvanized-steel links. &quot;Now, just how do these go on?&quot;&nbsp;  
She draped one end round her left ankle and held the end link and another,
  six-in. away, between her two fingers.&nbsp; She had the lock in her right
  hand and easily passed the shackle through the two links, closing the lock
  with a soft snap.&nbsp; She looped another short length of chain about her
  right ankle, closed two links with the remaining padlock and stood up for the
  first time ever in chains.  
She hobbled, clumsily at first, over to the full-length bedroom mirror and
  gave herself another critical look, noticing first the 24-in. span of links
  between her ankles.&nbsp; But the short walk caused the coarse, granular surface
  of the galvanized links to rub and lightly abrade the skin above her ankle
  bones and she knew she would have to get another, smooth type of chain.&nbsp;  
She sat on the bed, unlocked the galvanized chain from her ankles, took off
  the nightgown, folded it and put it on her side of the bed, got dressed in
  slacks and pullover sweater only -- no bra -- and headed back into town.&nbsp;  
She was only slightly less nervous the second time in the hardware store
  but she knew Angus wanted to close early -- it was getting close to 5 p.m.
  Saturday and he had other things to do than to tend a fidgety woman who was
  nervous, of all things, about buying a piece of chain.  
&quot;Mr. MacEwan,&quot; Moira began nervously, &quot;I need to substitute
  this, er, ah, chain, for another.&nbsp; Can you help, please?&quot;&nbsp; She
  felt her long nipples grow hard again, this time with anxiety and excitement,
  against the prickly wool pullover.  
&quot;This way, Mrs. MacPeak,&quot; Angus said, stealing a quick glance at
  her lovely, braless breasts that swayed and bounced lightly with Moira's movements,
  the nipples poking through indiscreetly.  
The two walked to the chain display and Angus, trying to be helpful, asked
  Moira again what the chain was going to be used for.  
Moira stammered and said she was going to try and secure her picnic table
  to prevent vandals from taking it like they did to her two years ago.  
&quot;Aye, I see,&quot; Angus said, not believing her.&nbsp; &quot;Then the
  galvanized chain you have should do the job.&quot; Oh, no, thought Moira, the
  jig's up.&nbsp; She thought for a few seconds, Angus thought it was some kind
  of weird women's delay tactic, and suddenly shouted: &quot;The stainless steel
  one; that won't rust, will it?&quot;  
&quot;No, Mrs. MacPeak, stainless steel will not rust.&nbsp; Will you take
  three feet of it?&nbsp; I'll make it the same price as the galvanized.&quot;  
&quot;Yes, yes; the stainless chain, please,&quot; Moira stammered, turning
  beet-red again as her Scottish intuition told her Mr. MacEwan must by now know
  what she was up to.&nbsp; Angus cut her the requisite length, said &quot;No
  charge, Mrs. MacPeak; even trade,&quot; and escorted her to the door.  
&quot;Good afternoon, Mrs. MacPeak,&quot; Angus said.&nbsp; &quot;Have a
  lovely weekend.&quot;  
&quot;You too, Mr. MacEwan; thank you for your assistance.&quot;  
Moira literally ran to her car with her soon-to-be ankle restraints -- a
  three-ft. length of 3/16ths, oblong, stainless-steel chain -- and drove carefully
  home.&nbsp; In the master bedroom 15 minutes later, she undressed, put on the
  long nightgown, sat on the bed and, for the second time in less than an hour
  locked her ankles, this time in smooth-finished stainless steel.&nbsp; She
  again looked at herself in the mirror -- unaware her husband had been seated
  in the living room with her padlocks' keys in his pocket -- and tried to imagine
  what Graham would say and do when he saw her.  
&quot;Moira, you look superb,&quot; Graham said quietly, standing in the
  bedroom doorway.  
&quot;Ohmigod, Graham; you scared the daylights out of me,&quot; Moira gasped,
  hand to her breast, as she turned to face him, nearly tripping over the 24-in.
  chain.&nbsp; &quot;How long have you been standing there?&nbsp; I didn't hear
  you come in.&quot;  
&quot;Moira, I've been home 15 minutes; you came rushing in and didn't even
  notice me sitting there.&nbsp; Now, to change the topic, when did you get the
  notion that I wanted to see you in chains?&nbsp; I've wanted to see you like
  this since before we were married but...&quot;  
&quot;Oh, Graham,&quot; Moira sighed, as she shuffled toward him to throw
  her suntanned arms around his neck.&nbsp; The young couple walked together,
  hand in hand, to the bed and Graham, a powerfully-built Scots-born bricklayer,
  lowered his lovely lass to the bed and quickly undressed to lie beside her.&nbsp; His
  member was rock-hard as began his customary session of foreplay that brought
  Moira MacPeak to sexual frenzy in minutes.&nbsp;  
He always seemed to target her long nipples with his lips and teeth, she
  knew, and this afternoon it would be no different.&nbsp; Nipples, clit, lips,
  neck; then back again, she said to herself.&nbsp; Same old...  
But, to her great surprise and pleasure, in just five minutes she was in
  sexual splendour, moaning deeply, her chest rising and falling rhythmically,
  as she spread her legs to the full 24-in. span her links allowed her.  
&quot;Crawl underneath 'em, Graham,&quot; Moira instructed, taking her cue
  from Isabel's explanation of how turned on she got when she and Peter enjoyed
  sex in chains.  
Graham finished his attentions to Moira's erect, sensitive nipples and slithered
  down between her legs, got her ankle chains easily over his neck and partway
  down his back and wriggled his way up further as Moira spread her knees wide
  at his hips to accommodate him.&nbsp; His manhood slipped inside Moira with
  customary ease but the new sensation of Moira's chained ankles at the base
  of his spine did wonders for both of them.&nbsp; Moira's legs were widespread,
  immobile, her knees immobile at his hips, and Graham could feel her chained
  ankles tugging expectantly at his back as he began slow, deep thrusts into
  her.  
Ten minutes later, both were near mutual orgasm and Graham was the first
  to climax after a series of pounding &quot;vinegar strokes&quot; as Moira called
  them.&nbsp; (&quot;Look at your face after you take a drink of vinegar, Graham,&quot; she
  said once).  
&quot;A-aaag-ggg-hhh, Moira; here, take it,&quot; he said softly, as he pounded
  his woman with his hard bricklayer's body, shooting his cum deep inside her.&nbsp; Moira
  lifted her hips and widespread thighs legs to meet her man's powerful thrusts
  and she reached her first of three climaxes that wracked her body as though
  voltage current was being passed through her.  
&quot;Mmmm-mmm-yyyyyyy God, I'm coming; hang onto me,&quot; Moira gasped
  as she thrust her hips against Graham's loins passionately.&nbsp; She clutched
  at his broad, powerful back with her hands and ankles as tight as she could
  as the next two orgasms spasmed her over and over for 30 seconds.&nbsp;  
Both fell back against the soft mattress, exhausted, but quietly enthused
  that such a piece of utilitarian stainless steel could provide them sexual
  stimulation and reward.  
Moira and Graham lay quietly in each other's arms, looking into each others
  eyes, then away.&nbsp; Graham spoke first.&nbsp; &quot;Moira, who told you
  about wearing chains?&nbsp; Isabel?&nbsp; You know, I've wanted to see you
  like this, and do you like this, for so long.&nbsp; Let's keep the chains on
  you overnight and see what happens.&nbsp; Tomorrow's Sunday, too, don't forget,
  and we don't have to be anywhere, so let's experiment a bit.&quot; Moira was
  only too happy to agree and the chains were not bothering her as much as she
  thought they would.&nbsp;  
Half an hour later, Graham's vigour restored, the MacPeak bedroom was alive
  with groans, creaks and the soft clink of Moira's ankle chains as sexual ecstasy
  gripped the couple once again.  
At 2 a.m., Sunday, the couple collapsed, sexually exhausted, into each other's
  arms, concluding a marathon, eight-hour session of intense lovemaking neither
  had experienced heretofore -- thanks to the fitting of a piece of chain on
  Moira MacPeak's ankles and some information and advice from a woman who had
  already been there.&nbsp; Graham's and Moira's experiments and adventures in
  bondage were about to begin.  
Chapter 3: The Vacation   
Moira and Graham opened their eyes together as their alarm clattered metallically
  on the nightstand at 8 a.m. Sunday.&nbsp; Graham was, as always, the first
  out of bed and went to the bathroom to shower, shave and get ready for a day
  of rest with his &quot;supercharged bride&quot; of 15 years, Moira Edna MacPeak,
  33, mother of two teenaged boys recently enlisted in the Royal Navy.  
&quot;Graham, do you have the keys to these?&quot; Moira called out to her
  husband in the bath.&nbsp; &quot;Can't hear you, Mo,&quot; came the reply.&nbsp; Moira
  swung her chained ankles out of bed with an unaccustomed tinkle of stainless-steel
  links on the carpet and shuffled/staggered into the bathroom to join her husband.&nbsp; Graham
  was shaving when Moira crept in behind him, put her hands and arms around his
  chest and snuggled against his back.  
Graham's manhood grew as he felt Moira's soft, 36-C breasts flatten against
  his muscular back and her turned around and kissed her passionately on both
  cheeks, leaving little traces of SuperShave on her cheeks.  
&quot;Keep those chains on for breakfast, Moira, and let's see how you, or
  rather, we react to them.&nbsp; It's so far, so good, 'init?&quot;  
Moira agreed; after all, they had not hindered their lovemaking; if anything,
  it made sex much more intense, just as Isabel said had happened to her, and
  she was just as content to keep her ankles chained Sunday morning -- maybe
  the afternoon, too.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
Moira finished in the bathroom and shuffled back into the bedroom to get
  her dressing gown and clinked out into the kitchen to make their breakfast
  -- juice, bacon, tomatoes, toast, cheese and marmalade and coffee -- while
  Graham scanned the Glasgow and Edinburgh Sunday papers for news, stocks, bonds
  and mutual funds quotes and the classifieds.  
Graham sipped his coffee and munched on toast as he turned the pages of the
  Edinburgh weekender, then set it down and turned to the Glasgow Sunday classifieds
  for entertainment.&nbsp;  
His eyes soon fell on 061 - Personals  and he glanced
  down at the display ads for companions, dog sitters, plant waterers and assorted
  other requests.  
The ad he was hoping to read was near the end of the three columns of display
  text.&nbsp; His eyes widened as he read:

  weekend in chains?&nbsp; If so, read on: My wife and I have

  Sheila and Michael.   
&quot;Moira, read this,&quot; he said as he sat the classified section down
  in front of her.&nbsp; Moira set down her coffee cup and looked at the ad.&nbsp; She
  read it the second time.&nbsp; And a third.  
Finally, she said: &quot;Well, that's very interesting, Graham.&nbsp; But
  who on earth would refer us?&nbsp; This isn't Playland, you know.&nbsp; We
  would have to know what we are getting into before we would decide on anything.&nbsp; You
  know I like to be informed about everything before we make any plans.&quot;  
&quot;Well, first of all, Moira, I'm just curious whether you would consider
  participating in such a fantasy weekend in the first place.&nbsp; If you choose
  not to, well, we'll just forget we ever saw the ad.&nbsp; But do you think
  you would like to spend a weekend, chained in a dungeon, with me, for a weekend?&nbsp; It
  sounds kinda sexy and exciting for me.&quot;  
&quot;Mmm, I don't know,&quot; Moira replied.&nbsp; &quot;I've only worn
  this chain overnight and I don't know if I'm ready for a weekend in chains
  or not.&nbsp; Let me think about it.&quot;  
&quot;OK,&quot; Graham replied.&nbsp; And he let the matter stand.  
Moira stood up with an unaccustomed little rustle of her ankle chain to clear
  away the breakfast dishes, put them in the sink and turned to go to the bedroom
  to get dressed.&nbsp; Graham held her by the hand as she moved past the table
  and said: &quot;I hope you decide in the positive, Moira; I think it would
  be a fun way to spend a weekend.&quot;  
&quot;Mmm, I'll let you know what I think,&quot; Moira said as she leaned
  forward to give her husband a peck on the cheek, affording him a quick, cock-hardening
  glance down the delicious, deep cleavage the new nightgown gave her, before
  continuing to the bedroom to dress.  
She was about to sit on the bed to unlock the padlocks securing the chain
  to her ankles when the thought occurred to her:&nbsp; Isabel Metcalfe has full-time
  experience in chains and would likely be as good a reference as any, if she
  consented.&nbsp; Moira unlocked the two brass locks, put the chain and locks
  neatly under her pillow and pulled the wrinkled nightgown over her head.&nbsp; She
  chose a tight T-shirt, jeans and sandals to wear today and decided she would
  go braless, for the first time ever, all day.&nbsp; And the rest of her life.  
Dressed, well almost, she thought, she went back into the kitchen to join
  Graham, her breasts bobbing &quot;like two puppies under a blanket,&quot; as
  Graham would say, under her light shirt.&nbsp;  
Her nipples poked enticingly through the thin material of her white 'T' and
  Moira was pleased with the way her body was responding in a youthful way.&nbsp; Graham
  put the paper down to watch her walk in and she knew she had his attention
  as she sat down at the kitchen table.  
&quot;Let's do it,&quot; she announced.&nbsp; &quot;I ought really to talk
  to Isabel and ask if she could supply us with references.&nbsp; She has bondage
  experience, she probably is well-known to the bondage community by now, even
  thought she may not realize it, and she is something of a resource person for
  me.  
&quot;Why don't you give them a call tomorrow, Monday, and get some more
  information and I'll talk to Isabel.&nbsp; Maybe she and Peter might like to
  come along, too.&nbsp; What do you think?&quot;  
Graham thought it was a wonderful idea and said he would call the number
  in the ad first thing Monday. The rest of Sunday passed uneventfully for Graham
  and Moira: Moira did some housework, Graham mowed the lawns and both watched
  some afternoon TV before Moira started getting supper ready.&nbsp; Monday was
  a national holiday and the two looked forward to a luxurious day of rest at
  home.  
At bedtime, Moira undressed as Graham watched her from the bed.&nbsp; Both
  were again turned on as Moira slipped the nightgown over her head, sat on her
  side of the bed and locked her ankle chain on her trim ankles once again.&nbsp; And
  their passionate embraces resumed unabated. Passionate sex two nights in row
  was doing wonders for their relationship.  
Next day, Moira's ankles were slightly chafed and tender from the overnight
  clutch of chains but she didn't care.&nbsp; She sat at the kitchen table and
  listened while Graham made the call to the Ball-More-All fantasy hotel/dungeon
  in northern Scotland.&nbsp;  
Depending on the results of his conversation, she would call Isabel and get
  her feedback and recommendation.  
&quot;Hello?&nbsp; Hello?&quot; Graham began.&nbsp; &quot;My name is Graham
  MacPeak and I'm calling with regards your advert. in the Sunday newspaper.  
&quot;Yes.&nbsp; Yes.  
&quot;I'm 35 and she's 33; married; no, we don't do drugs; happily married
  for 15 years and just starting to experiment well, you know, with eh, ah, bondage.  
&quot;No.&nbsp; Yes.  
&quot;I am sure we can provide references and your rate of 75 pounds for
  the weekend, all inclusive, sounds quite reasonable.&nbsp; Let me discuss these
  details with my wife, Moira, and we will get back to you.&nbsp; Is it possible
  another couple could join us?&nbsp; You have adjoining dungeon cells?&nbsp; Well!  
&quot;Yes?&nbsp; You would like the women to be chained on arrival?&nbsp; Oh,
  my.  
&quot;Let me call you first thing tomorrow.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Moira and Graham
  MacPeak.  
&quot;Thank you; we'll get back to you.&nbsp; Goodbye.&quot;  
Moira leaned over the kitchen table, allowing her nightgown to fall away
  from her bosom slightly, as Graham hung up and looked intently at his wife.  
Graham gave Moira the details of his conversation with the proprietors of
  the hotel/dungeon on the north coast of Scotland: it was a 100-year-old hotel
  done over to suit the B/D crowd; it had eight small chambers done over as dungeon
  cells, complete with chains, cots and shackles galore; all cells were centrally
  heated; upstairs was a suite of deluxe hotel rooms with adjoining full-service
  restaurant/bar and lounge for pre- and post-&quot;dungeon time.&quot;&nbsp; Guests
  had to be referred by someone active in the bondage scene and who was known
  to the Scottish B/D scene; the price was 75 pounds/couple for a weekend, which
  included 24-hour access to the cells, deluxe accommodation upstairs and introduction
  to the hotel's extensive, expensive array of bondage gear which comprised mainly
  shackles and chains for the bodies and limbs of women of all ages (20 - 75).&nbsp;  
There were even provisions for chains to be fitted on clients -- male or
  female -- for periods of up to one year, provided medical and legal waivers
  and release forms were signed, Graham told Moira, but Moira was too busy thinking
  what she was going to ask Isabel later today.  
After supper, Moira slipped out of the kitchen, got undressed and locked
  her ankles again in the 24-in. chain as she had the previous evening.&nbsp;  
She put her dressing gown over her chained nudity and joined Graham in the
  living room.&nbsp; Graham was delighted to see his wife again in chained ankles
  and wasted no time in getting her in the mood again.&nbsp; Soon, the pair were
  mock-wrestling like teenagers on the living room couch, smothering each other
  alternately with weakly-applied half-nelsons, interspersed with passionate,
  deep kisses, until Moira could take it no longer.&nbsp; Moira's chain snubbed
  her legs at virtually every move but she was growing to enjoy the hindrances
  they placed on her movements.  
&quot;To bed,&quot; she ordered jokingly.&nbsp; &quot;Yes, ma'am,&quot; Graham
  replied.&nbsp; And the pair moved their action into the bedroom where, once
  again, the chains proved to be a powerful stimulant for renewed sexual energy.  
This night, Moira got on top of her husband and proved she was still the
  capable lover she was 16 years ago when they first experimented with different
  sexual positions.&nbsp; Moira loved the way Graham's manhood slipped so gently
  into her warm, tender vagina and she took the initiative tonight by using pelvic-thrusting
  technique to bring him to a shuddering orgasm in just 10 minutes.&nbsp; Her
  own climax followed moments after, with Graham gripping her breasts firmly
  in both hands,&nbsp; and they continued to clutch each other fervently bathing
  in the warming, soothing effects of sexual afterglow .  
They were soon asleep with Moira still on top, impaled by her husband's semi-rigid
  cock.  
On Tuesday, Moira made her big phone call to Isabel to ask if she would write
  or phone Ball-More-All, the bondage &quot;entertainment centre&quot; Graham
  had contacted,&nbsp; to supply a character reference for them.&nbsp; Isabel
  was at first surprised but soon agreed to recommend them unreservedly to the
  proprietors.&nbsp;  
She told her friend she would say that Graham and Moira MacPeak are of sterling
  Scottish character; that Moira has a growing interest in safe, sane, consensual
  bondage; and that the couple had consented to engage in bondage activity in
  an informed, mature way provided it would be conducted in a private, safe and
  comfortable environment.&nbsp;  
Moira was delighted to hear the wholehearted endorsement Isabel had agreed
  to provide and offered that she and Peter might care to come along as well
  on a fantasy weekend.  
&quot;Could you discuss this with Graham?&quot; Isabel asked Moira carefully.  
&quot;Certainly, Isabel, and I am sure Graham will agree. I think it would
  be lovely if you two were to come along with us.&nbsp; I understand that the
  hotel would like us women -- er, that means me -- to be in chains before our
  arrival. Maybe you could help me prepare, provided we are accepted?&quot;  
Isabel said she was confident the hotel would accept them as guests for the
  weekend and told Moira to press on with her plans.  
Moira's next step was to inform Graham, when he got back from work that day,
  that Isabel would provide character references to the hotel and that she had
  invited Isabel and Peter to come, too.  
When Graham called to confirm the arrangements with the hotel next day, he
  was delighted o hear that Isabel had, indeed, telephoned character references
  that were accepted fully and that Isabel had taken the initiative in requesting
  reservations for four -- for herself and Peter and the MacPeaks -- and that
  she was going to &quot;pay the lot&quot; from an advance of pay she recently
  received from the University of Edinburgh.  
Michael and Sheila, the hotel proprietors, had read all the news reports
  of Isabel's recent kidnapping and desert exploits in bondage and considered
  her to be a welcome guest -- and resource -- to their enterprise.&nbsp; When
  Isabel asked about how she should be bound prior to arrival at the hotel, the
  owners informed her that her present shackles would be more than adequate and
  that, perhaps, Mrs. MacPeak could be similarly attired?&nbsp; Isabel said she
  would pass on that little detail and Moira reluctantly accepted to be bound
  in chains for the trip to northern Scotland at the end of August -- three weeks
  hence.  
Chapter 4: The Road Trip   
The following three weeks passed quickly -- Moira and Isabel were counting
  the days -- until Aug. 31, 1975, Road Trip day.&nbsp; The two women had packed
  their best eveningwear, their favourite nightgowns, casual daywear and the
  usual feminine essentials.&nbsp; Moira had confided in Isabel she had not worn
  a bra since the reservations were made and she loved the freedom it gave her.&nbsp; They
  agreed they would take the MacPeak's Ford Escort, which was just a little roomier
  than Isabel's and Peter's Austin Mini Minor, and, soon, the four were ready
  and packed for the road and a weekend in bondage for the two women. Moira and
  Graham had arrived and were standing on Isabel's and Peter's front porch when
  Isabel invited them in for a cuppa before hitting the road.&nbsp; In the kitchen,
  Isabel handed Moira a small package, saying &quot;Here, Moira, open it up and
  tell us what you think.&quot;  
&lt; easy quick, a in ankles both on snapped them had and her of front down
  bent quickly friend startled from away chain the took Isabel nightwear.?&nbsp; comfortable

  I two, you about ?Now Graham.&nbsp; told us,? registering difficulty any have
  shouldn't hotel so identically up chained We're go.&nbsp; to ready we're now&gt;  
Isabel handed the keys to Moira's chains to Graham and they were in fine
  spirits as they headed out to the car, the girls following behind, with Moira
  having to shorten her pace slightly to Isabel's 18-in. pace.&nbsp;  
Both women wore skirts, blouses and jackets with sensible shoes and their
  chains made a metallic clatter on the driveway as first Moira squeezed into
  the back seat, to be followed by Isabel, and Peter joined Graham in the front.  
Three hours later, the foggy, forbidding north coast of Scotland loomed into
  view and they followed the road signs to the Balmoral Hotel (there was a different
  sign on the property) near the cold, dark and damp, granite-shrouded Cape Wrath,
  on the Atlantic seacoast.  
&quot;Well, we're here,&quot; Graham said, as he drove into the gravel driveway
  leading to a Georgian-style, three-story brick and stone building overlooking
  the seacoast.&nbsp; &quot;It certainly looks well made.&nbsp; Let's hope it's
  warm inside -- it's certainly clammy out here,&quot; Peter said to the two
  goose-bumped women huddling to keep warm in the backseat as an Atlantic fogbank
  moved in across the dim northern moor.  
Graham parked the little white Ford outside the imposing oaken front door
  and the four got out to stretch their legs and look at the property before
  heading in.&nbsp; Isabel and Moira walked tentatively onto the front lawn and
  looked questioningly at some hiking paths that led down and away from the property
  before deciding to turn back toward the hotel, their chained feet making odd
  patterns on the moist, thick lawn.  
&quot;I need to warm up, Isabel, I'm not used to this northern weather just
  yet.&nbsp; Let's hope our cells are as warm and comfortable and they say they
  are.&quot;&nbsp; Isabel nodded and pulled her jacket a little closer around
  her neck as she took Moira's hand and the two women made their way up the four
  broad steps into the foyer of the spacious, old hotel.  
Sheila and Michael, the proprietors, met the two couples in the foyer with
  warm handshakes all round and they were off to a good start.&nbsp; Sheila,
  a curvy, 36-year-old woman from Somerset, England, aka &quot;Somerset Mom,&quot; and
  her husband, 35, from Portsmouth, England, gave them a brief verbal description
  of the layout, the amenities and services, registered them, gave them an armload
  of pamphlets and showed them to their adjoining rooms on the first floor, just
  above the dungeon suite.&nbsp; They, too, had two sons in the RN.  
The women's chains clacked and clashed loudly on the hardwood floor -- to
  their embarrassment and to the delight of their husbands, and to Sheila, who
  smiled enigmatically -- and, soon, the two couples were in their rooms, unpacking
  and getting ready for their sexy weekend.  
&quot;I think I'd like to be chained as I was in the desert,&quot; Isabel
  said to Peter as she looked through her suitcase.&nbsp; Maybe we could inquire
  if they have the sort of chains that were put on me; I kinda grew to like them
  on me, you know, Peter.  
&quot;I'll check, Isabel; but first let's have a drink and settle in; it
  was a three-hour car trip, after all, and it's only 3 p.m. so we've still got
  lots of time for supper.&nbsp; Maybe we could try the dungeon cells tonight
  after supper if you're keen.&quot;  
&quot;Oh, yes; I'm keen,&quot; Isabel said.&nbsp; &quot;Now, you come here,&quot; she
  said, as she pulled him toward the bed smothering him in wet kisses as she
  struggled to get at his belt and zipper.&nbsp; He gently pushed her onto the
  wide, soft double bed and kissed and caressed her. Isabel felt her sexual energy
  beginning to climb as she squirmed out of her skirt so that she was wearing
  just her loincloth and plain white blouse.&nbsp; Her breasts flattened toward
  the sides of her chest as she lay on the bed, arms widespread, as Peter began
  a torrid session of foreplay.&nbsp; Isabel gently pushed him to one side as
  she straightened up to take off her blouse, giving Peter a full view of her
  ripe, ringed breasts as she straddled him to begin another session of lovemaking
  that had become so intense in recent weeks.  
Isabel sat forcefully on Peter's cock and Peter obliged by thrusting deeper
  inside her.&nbsp; Isabel groaned loudly as she felt the deep penetration but
  she did not notice Peter reach beside her for a two-foot length of hemp twine.  
&quot;Put your arms behind your back, honey,&quot; Peter said softly, and
  Isabel complied.&nbsp; He then bound her wrists securely behind her back and
  began thrusting inside her with renewed vigour.&nbsp; Isabel leaned back, putting
  her bound hands on his thighs, and opened her thighs wider to give herself
  as much wanton pleasure as she could.  
&nbsp;Their lovemaking continued for an hour until Peter exploded deep inside
  her, causing Isabel to writhe in pleasure and slight pain from her pinioned
  wrists.&nbsp;  
They rolled over onto their sides and Peter hugged and caressed his wife
  tenderly as the afterglow of their lovemaking sedated them.  
Across the hall a different story was unfolding.&nbsp; Moira wanted to check
  out the prison cells downstairs and asked Graham to take her below.&nbsp; The
  couple wandered down the hallway to the staircase leading to the stone-floored
  prison-cell suite and Moira looked into the first one on her right.&nbsp; The
  doors consisted of a barred grill on the front and a thick oak door, with a
  small hatch at eye level.&nbsp;  
Forced-air heating kept the 8 X 10 cell at a comfortable 75 degrees F. although
  the walls were made of stone, the floor was carpeted and the cot, just three-ft.
  wide, had a soft mattress and silk sheets.&nbsp; Chains and ringbolts decorated
  the walls, floor and stone ceiling and there was a small washbasin, table with
  mirrors and a chest filled with bondage equipment for the inmates' use and
  delights.&nbsp; Moira sat on the small bed and looked at the chest questioningly.  
&quot;Open it, Graham, I want to see what's inside,&quot; she said.&nbsp; Graham
  went to the chest near the wash stand and lifted the lid.&nbsp; His eyes widened
  as he looked at the assorted chains and shackles that it held -- the diameters
  of the cuffs suitable for the female form only, he assumed. Graham pulled out
  two pairs of cuffs and laid them on the cot beside Moira.&nbsp; He bent down
  to unlock her ankle cuffs and replaced them with a set from the chest.&nbsp;  
&quot;Hold out your hands, Moira,&quot; he said, as he clasped a pair of
  handcuffs around her slender wrists.&nbsp; When he was done, Moira's ankles
  were joined with an 18-in. chain and her wrists by 12-in. shackles.&nbsp; Moira
  stood up and examined her wrists and ankles carefully and sat down with a rustle
  of links.&nbsp; She put her chained arms around her husband and pulled him
  down on top of her on the little cot with a creak of springs and rustle of
  chain.&nbsp; Their afternoon sexual delight was about to begin.  
Meanwhile, Isabel and Peter continued to snuggle in their luxurious double
  bed upstairs.&nbsp; An hour later, after dozing in each other's arms, Peter
  reached behind his wife and untied the four bights of thin cord that pinned
  her crossed wrists at the small of her back.&nbsp;  
Isabel immediately brought her arms around in front and rubbed the four red
  indentations left by the cord. &quot;Oh my, these will show at suppertime,
  Peter,&quot; she said mildly.  
&quot;Maybe we should just use chains on my wrists for a while?&nbsp; I have
  a nice evening gown I want to wear for the dinner tonight and I don't want
  my wrists or elbows or my neck marked up any more than necessary, OK?&quot;  
Peter agreed and after a while they decided to get up and start to get dressed
  for drinks in the bar before supper.&nbsp;  
They enjoyed a luxurious shower together &quot;to conserve water&quot; and
  Peter dried Isabel off carefully afterward, paying careful attention to patting
  dry her ankle chains and, particularly, the skin underneath the cuffs.&nbsp; Peter
  even sprinkled a little talcum powder between the cuffs and her ankles to prevent
  chafing and skin irritation and dusted the excess off the smooth metal.&nbsp; Isabel
  finished with her hair and makeup and soon was poking around inside her suitcase
  for her evening gown, a black, floor-length affair that clung to her body and
  draped over her hips to fall in A-fashion to her ankles.&nbsp; The neckline
  plunged low to her waist and the deep cleavage of her mature breasts was on
  full, magnificent display.&nbsp; Peter was pleased as Isabel got dressed in
  front of him and Isabel looked critically at herself in a full-length mirror.  
&quot;Do you like this dress I bought last year?&quot; she asked him.&nbsp;  
&quot;Oh, yes, it's stunning,&quot; Peter replied, as he continued to get
  dressed in blazer, slacks and tie.&nbsp; He casually walked over to his woman
  and put his powerful arms around her waist, lifting his hands to cup her pendulous
  breasts.&nbsp;  
&quot;Mmmm, just wait 'til after supper,&quot; Isabel replied, as she turned
  around to face him making her ankle chains clink slightly.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her
  husband had a small surprise for her.&nbsp; In his right hand was a gold locket,
  on an 18-in. fine, gold chain, he had given her months ago for her birthday.&nbsp; The
  locket contained pictures of both of them with an inscription, &quot;My Isabel,
  My Love,&quot; engraved on the inside.&nbsp;  
He reached inside the front of her dress and passed the slender, sinuous
  chain through her left nipple ring, then threaded the other end through her
  right ring, closing the little clasp between her breasts.&nbsp; The little
  gold locket hung decorously between her breasts and the thin gold chain, weighted
  by the small locket, tugged lightly at her nipples as she moved.  
Isabel enjoyed the sensuous feel of the suggestive, little tugs on her shiny-ringed
  nipples and they were instantly erect, much to her delight and Peter's admiration.&nbsp; Soon,
  Peter and Isabel were ready for drinks and supper.&nbsp; Peter opened the door
  for his formally-attired wife, whose ankle chains chinked indiscreetly underneath
  her gown, and the couple made their way to the bar at the far end of the hotel.&nbsp;  
The little locket bobbed gently between Isabel's swaying breasts, reminding
  her constantly of the sexy placement of the little piece of jewellery. They
  entered the bar and found a table near a window to wait for their friends.  
Downstairs, Moira and Graham had been exploring the contents of the chest
  of bondage gear in their cell and Moira was now wearing a locked steel collar
  in addition to her handcuffs and leg chains. &nbsp;&nbsp;After more discoveries
  and reading the pamphlet about long-term bondage, they, too, decided to go
  upstairs and get ready for supper -- with Moira wearing her new bondage accoutrements.&nbsp; Moira
  clinked and clattered her way, on her husband's arm, back to their room where
  they, too, began to dress for supper.&nbsp; Graham unlocked Moira's 12-in.
  handcuffs and left her leg chains on while Moira looked for her favourite little
  black dress, a spaghetti-strap, mid-thigh-length number that clung to her like
  cloth, showing off her sexy 36-C breasts, long nipples (the dress could only
  be worn braless) and her long, tanned, shapely legs.&nbsp; She quickly slipped
  it over her head and smoothed it down over her hips, tidied her shoulder-length
  hair which fell around her collar,&nbsp; turned to Graham for his approval
  and checked her appearance in the nearby full-length mirror.  
&quot;I am satisfied that I look sexy enough to kill, gr-r-r,&quot; Moira
  told Graham in the sultriest voice she could manage.&nbsp;  
Sex appeal did not come naturally to either Moira or Graham but each was
  trying to outdo each other and, if they turned on their best friends in the
  process, all the better.&nbsp; &quot;Indeed you do,&quot; Graham replied.&nbsp; &quot;Here
  let me snap these back on your wrists and we will leave the collar on for our
  'grand entrance' in the dining room.&nbsp; I believe Isabel and Peter are already
  there.&nbsp; Here, Moira, give me your hands.&quot;  
Moira held out her wrists to accept the 1 &frac12;-inch wide steel bands
  and 12-inch connecting chain that Graham lovingly placed around each wrists;
  pushing each cuff snugly home into its self-locking mechanism.&nbsp; (Graham
  had two sets of keys in his jacket pocket -- one for her left and right ankle
  cuffs and a single key that opened her wrist cuffs.)&nbsp;  
He caressed Moira's wrists lovingly and patted his breast pocket to make
  sure the keys were still there and out of reach from Moira's prying fingers
  should she suddenly desire to be free from her bondage -- which he doubted.&nbsp; Moira
  saw the gesture and shrugged it off with an admission to herself that Graham
  would unlock her as soon as she wished.  
&quot;Moira, you look absolutely ravishing,&quot; Graham said earnestly.&nbsp; &quot;I've
  never seen you in chains and wearing your black dress before.&nbsp; Sure, you're
  bound to turn heads when we appear in the dining room tonight.&nbsp; I wonder
  how many other couples are there in chains like you and Isabel.&quot;  
&quot;I don't know, Graham; let's go down now and find out,&quot; Moira replied,
  turning with a swish of her ankle chain to go out the door.&nbsp; Moira and
  Graham tried to walk hand-in- hand down the hall but Moira's wrist chains did
  not permit her to grasp her husband's hand easily.&nbsp; Instead, Graham looped
  his left arm through his wife's right, causing Moira's arms to he held in front
  of her,&nbsp; and the two walked arm-in-arm to the dining room about 50 yards
  way, down the hall, across the lobby and through the first set of double doors
  on the right.&nbsp;  
The combined restaurant-bar was a well-appointed, brightly-lit and expensively-appointed
  facility: there were about a dozen intimate tables lining ceiling-high, Georgian-style
  windows that overlooked the front yard and its commanding view of the Atlantic
  seacoast; they immediately saw Isabel and Peter at a corner table set for four.&nbsp; Moira
  blushed when she saw that Isabel was not wearing handcuffs as she was and was
  only mildly shocked when she saw the lines of four red indentures on her wrists,
  left by her recent bondage.&nbsp;&nbsp; She knew her ankles were still chained
  underneath her long, low-cut dress and she quietly clinked her way over, with
  Graham at her side, to join their friends for a romantic supper.  
Dining in chains in a semi-formal setting was a first for the two women and
  they almost forgot their chains as their fantasies and imaginations took flight:
  here they were, in semi-formal attire, both chained like common criminals,
  but with their husbands at their side, in a sumptuous restaurant overlooking
  the rugged north Scotland terrain.&nbsp;  
Moira felt her nipples harden even more, poking out firmly through the stretchy
  wool fabric of her dress, as she sat down with a rustle of chain beside her
  pal, Isabel.  
&quot;Hi, Is., what's new?&quot; Moira said lightly.&nbsp; &quot;How do you
  like my new bracelets?&nbsp; Graham just put them on me a few moments ago.&quot; Moira
  held up her chained wrists and crossed her legs sexily.&nbsp; &quot;I hope
  they don't interfere with supper; I'm half-starved.&nbsp; We were in the cells
  for a while and, well, you know they don't have meal service down there.&quot;  
Isabel smiled and commented that her wrist shackles looked very nice on her,
  the chrome setting off her black dress, silver ear-rings and modest eye makeup
  and lip gloss effectively.&nbsp; &quot;They suit you wonderfully, Moira,&quot; Isabel
  enthused.&nbsp; &quot;I wore a pair somewhat like those during my kidnapping,
  although mine were attached to my ankle chains so I could only lift my arms
  so high,&quot; she said, motioning with her free arms.&nbsp; Moira looked and
  thought to herself it must have been difficult to be chained in that manner
  for days on end and not knowing when, or if, release would ever come.  
Soon a formally-attired young waiter appeared and the two couples ordered
  vodka martinis to be followed by shrimp cocktails, a vintage Chardonnay  roast
  beef au jus  with Yorkshire pudding, oven-roast potatoes
  and buttered vegetable medley, closing with cr&egrave;me de menthe  parfaits,
  coffee and Glayva  , the fiery Scottish liqueur they preferred.  
The meal took two hours -- from the usual starting time of 7 p.m. -- and
  by 9 Moira, Graham, Isabel and Peter were ready for more recreational pursuits
  after hours of small talk which explored the women's introductions to the world
  of steel bondage.  
Isabel informed her companions that she had become accustomed to wearing
  ankle chains -- possibly for the rest of her life -- and that people, herself
  included, would have to accept this little collection of metal and chain that
  adorned her trim ankles.&nbsp;  
 Insofar as mobility was concerned, she informed them that it was no different
  than walking in a long, snug- straight skirt except that the chain would occasionally
  get caught on things -- a chair leg, a step, a tree-root or her one of her
  feet -- but she was getting used to the small inconvenience of having to stop
  and free herself.&nbsp;  
Other everyday manoeuvres, such as climbing into the town's double-decker
  bus, bowling or having to take an occasional long step to traverse mud puddles
  or rainwater in the gutters, were challenges &quot;that will be dealt with
  over time,&quot; Isabel said confidently.  
Moira listened attentively as Isabel described in more detail the experiences
  and bondages of her kidnap and escape. Her imagination caught fire as she put
  herself, between the meal's courses, in Isabel's place (with Graham at her
  side, of course), instead of that coarse kidnapper.&nbsp; &quot;I'm glad he
  was shot and killed, Isabel; your kidnappers did one good thing anyway,&quot; Moira
  interjected, when Isabel described the landing in the East African desert.&nbsp; (See Through
  Night to Light  for details of Isabel's desert adventures). &quot;And
  anyway those moronic London toughs have it coming to them; any way they get
  it is fine with me.&nbsp; Two slugs in the back of the head? Too right!&quot;  
Moira felt her wrist cuffs with the opposite hands and reached&nbsp; to her
  steel collar with her joined hands to emphasize her point and remind herself
  of Isabel's situation.&nbsp;  
Graham placed his left hand on Moira's right solicitously and the four looked
  out the crystal-clean, huge window into the black Scottish night.&nbsp; Each
  was suddenly alone in their own thoughts.  
Moira thought she would like to be chained for the night in cells in the
  same manner that Isabel was during her African adventure; Isabel thought she
  would like to be bound with cord again, ring-gagged as she was in Africa in
  front of her captors; while Graham's and Peter's libido-fired imaginations
  flashed pictures of their mates in chains beside them in bed.  
The four were aroused and adventurous and by the time the waiter appeared
  for the last time with their second round of liqueurs, they had made up their
  minds what the night's activities would comprise.&nbsp; It was to be bondage
  all-round for the women and hot sex, they way they had always dreamed, for
  their menfolk.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
As they were about to leave, the proprietors, Sheila and Michael, appeared
  at their table.&nbsp; There was no one else in the dining room and the owners
  had gone to extremes to ensure their four guests were comfortable and well-accommodated.&nbsp; Michael
  was smartly dressed in blazer, white shirt, regimental tie and grey slacks
  and Sheila was gowned in a floor-length, off-white evening dress, and her short
  steps suggesting her ankles, too, were probably chained.  
&quot;How was everything tonight?&quot; Sheila inquired.&nbsp; &quot;Was
  the meal and service satisfactory?&quot;  
The two couples all nodded in agreement and Sheila informed them they were
  free to choose between deluxe bedroom accommodation or the more spartan prison-cells
  in the dungeon suite downstairs and that all facilities were entirely ready
  for them.  
Peter, Isabel, Graham and Moira rose as one and the two men hastened to assist
  their ladies to get clear of the table in their chained conditions.&nbsp; The
  two women rose effortlessly from the chairs.  
Isabel whispered in Sheila's ear: &quot;Sheila, are your ankles chained,
  too?&quot;  
&quot;Oh, yes, every night; in fact, I'm planning on having them welded on
  by a tradesman as soon as I get Michael to agree to contact him.&nbsp; In fact,
  I'm the one who has to ask him to put me  in bondage --
  quite the opposite situation for you, in' it?&quot;  
&quot;Yes, it is; believe me, after the initial shock of being chained all
  the time, there's really nothing to it.&nbsp; People think that it must be
  painful, humiliating and embarrassing to be this way but, you know, it's really
  not all that bad.&quot;  
Sheila nodded her understanding and she, too, looked forward to a romantic
  night in her lover's arms with her ankles in chains.&nbsp; With Isabel's attention,
  she began to wonder deeply what it would be like to have chains welded on permanently.&nbsp;  
She had followed closely the news stories of Isabel's so-called &quot;plight&quot; and
  when Isabel's chained condition was described, she thought that she, too, would
  someday like to be bound as she was.&nbsp; Sheila was absolutely delighted
  when Isabel phoned in the character references for the MacPeaks and informed
  she and her husband would also like to attend.&nbsp; She had wanted this chat
  for so long.  
&quot;Isabel, may I have a word?&quot; Sheila asked.  
&quot;Why yes, of course; take all the time you want,&quot; Isabel replied,
  as he watched her husband wander away toward the bar while Graham and Moira
  turned to wave goodnight en route to their hotel suite.  
&quot;I am a combined history and psychology major at the University of Edinburgh
  and I know, from the newspaper reports, you will be starting work in the metallurgy
  division of the engineering faculty so I want you to know we have something
  in common.&quot;  
&quot;Go on,&quot; Isabel said, sitting down at the table again with a little
  rustle of chain.&nbsp; Sheila took the cue and sat across from her, in the
  chair just occupied by Peter, and began:  
&quot;My studies have led me to some observations about the conditions of
  women in chains down the centuries and I would like your comments.&nbsp; I'll
  begin.&quot;  
Isabel's imagination was immediately captivated.  
&quot;Through the centuries, women have either delighted in -- or have been
  condemned -- in chains or other bondages.&nbsp; I prefer to think that you
  and I fit into the former category.&nbsp; But let us look back for a moment.&nbsp; Cleopatra
  of Egypt had herself bound and rolled into a carpet to be presented as a gift
  to Antony, emperor of the Roman Empire, when Rome was at its pinnacle of power
  and prestige.&nbsp;  
&quot;But did you know that centuries before that, in Persia, a woman by
  the name of Schehrazade, of 1001 Arabian Nights  fame,
  became a chained thrall who told her captor, the monarch, a different story
  every night, for more than three years, so that he would spare her life.&nbsp; And
  she was successful although she was never released from bondage, or so the
  story goes.  
&quot;White women, for centuries, were captured for, or coerced into, harems
  of countless Middle Eastern men of influence and wealth and many were held,
  in chains, against their will, sometimes for the rest of their lives or until
  they were rescued, freed by other means or died in thrall.&nbsp; In fact, Mozart
  and Rossini composed operas, respectively Abduction from the Seraglio  and Italian
  Girl in Algiers  , about these women's perilous fates.  
&quot;Indeed, records in some Middle Eastern countries have come to light
  that show white women were the harems' prized members -- the sultan's favourite,
  so to speak --&nbsp; and some were kept in silver and bejewelled chains for
  up to 20 years or more.&quot;&nbsp; Sheila lit a cigarette, took a puff and
  continued. &quot;There also is the darker side to woman's experience in steel
  bondage throughout history.&nbsp; Joan of Arc was kept chained in a secular
  military prison for months while she was on trial and was still chained when
  burned at the stake in 1431.&nbsp; Five-hundred and 10 years later, the terrible
  Gestapo kept female members of the Resistance handcuffed and shackled in kneeling
  positions months at a time to break their spirit and convey their ruthlessness
  to the unfortunates' colleagues.&nbsp; More recently, some U.S. prisons are
  known to keep hardened female convicts in chains for days, weeks, months on
  end, and when they appear in the mass media they are always shackled and chained
  most effectively.  
&quot;It is my understanding, from my psychology studies, that some women
  -- not all -- actually prefer the clutch and clatter of chain as a prelude
  to lovemaking.&nbsp; You and I have taken this preference a step further, from
  a sexual overture to a fact of every day life, and, I will be quite frank,
  there is something in my psychological makeup that makes me want to be chained,
  to be bound, to be restrained somehow, as long as it is with someone I love.&nbsp; Call
  it 'loving bondage', call it what you will, but I am making my choice, with
  free will, to have my ankles chained permanently.&nbsp;  
&quot;In your case, Isabel, as I understand it, the situation did not involve
  free will at all; that your chains were placed on you with neither awareness
  nor consent.&nbsp; Further, that your chains, according to the media, are of
  unknown construction and metal that defies definition.  
&quot;I expect I will be making my decision to have my chains welded very
  soon,&quot; Sheila said, poking her left leg out from under the table to show
  Isabel her elegant, shiny steel cuffs and a 16-in. connecting chain. &quot;I
  just wanted to get your comments about what it's like to live in chains year-round;
  to live with the reality that they were put on without agreement, and that
  they may be on forever.&nbsp; I just need your input before I ask Michael to
  call in the local welder. Please?&quot;  
Isabel began as her listener butted her cigarette.&nbsp; &quot;Well, Sheila,
  I'm most impressed with that slice of history.&nbsp; I had no idea so many
  women before had such experiences.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would think the prospect of
  permanent bondage likely made them scared, anxious or, quite possibly, excited,
  at first. But as time went on, they probably forced themselves to became accustomed
  to their bondage.  
&quot;Enjoyment of bondage is purely subjective.&nbsp; In my situation, I
  am relatively fortunate in that my bondage is painless and, thus, enjoyable.&nbsp; It
  has to be.&nbsp; I could not endure it otherwise.&nbsp; I mean, a little discomfort
  here and there is tolerable but if you are thinking of long-term, or lifelong
  bondage, as in my case, there has to be a wide comfort zone.  
&quot;History will never tell us how comfortable, or uncomfortable, Cleo,
  Schehrazade or the countless others were in their bondage and I can only speak
  for myself.  
&quot;I've worn these chains now every day for just over three months and
  the realities of my situation are sinking in.&nbsp; For example, my friend,
  Professor Michael Ledstone, the metallurgist, has informed me recently that
  further spectroscopies have indicated the metal of my chains have tensile strength
  and density tens of thousands of times more than the most-refined tungsten-steel
  alloy -- and, therefore, cannot be removed by conventional means.&nbsp; He
  advises even the most-advanced, diamond-bitted cutting tools would not make
  a scratch in them.&nbsp; They were applied with extreme heat, apparently, but
  I was not injured.&nbsp; There are no seams, rivets, bolts or hinges anywhere
  so they are on for good, as far as I know.&nbsp; They weigh about 14 ounces,
  I understand, so their weight is not a problem.  
&quot;I've checked them as closely as I can and the interior surfaces are
  mirror-smooth which ensures my ankles will never be chafed unless, of course,
  I try to run the 800-metre dash.&quot;  
The two women giggled as they fished their cigarettes out of their purses
  and lit up.  
&quot;Michael, could you please get us a couple of Glayvas  for
  us; like a pet, please?&quot; Sheila asked.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yes, dear,&quot; he
  said from the nearby sideboard where he had been listening inattentively.&nbsp; He
  and Sheila had gone over the bondage issue many times before.  
&quot;Michael is such a pet and so understanding,&quot; Sheila butted in.&nbsp; &quot;We
  are in a dom/sub relationship and I'm the dom -- and in chains -- and he loves
  it when I try to wrestle him into bed with my ankles tied.&nbsp; It's a scream
  because he has the obvious advantage!&quot;  
Both women laughed aloud as Michael placed their liqueurs in front of them
  and retired to the bar to let them continue in confidence.  
&quot;Well, anyway, where was I?&quot; Isabel said.&nbsp; &quot;Oh, yes.&nbsp; The
  night I was taken aboard this spacecraft; oh, it was so mysterious, so powerful,
  and yet I can't remember a damn thing.&nbsp; I just remember a brilliant light
  that suffused the car I was in and then an indeterminable time later, I awoke
  in the car with chains in my ankles and rings in my nipples.&nbsp;  
&quot;Right here,&quot; Isabel said, pointing to her pendulous breasts connected
  by the locket that bounced sexily in her cleavage as she spoke and smoked. &nbsp;&quot;This
  little locket chain connects 'em so I'm chained in two places, really, hee-hee.&quot; &nbsp;She
  took a drag on her cigarette and continued.  
&quot;You are quite correct that my entry into bondage was done without consent
  and the devices are unremovable.&nbsp; But those realities don't really bother
  me, three months after the fact.&nbsp; A Canadian author, Sailor
  861,  has written about my kidnap, bondage, forced sex and my escape,
  in a short story called Through Night to Light  , so I
  won't go into detail about that; suffice that it taught be a bit more about
  non-consensual bondage.&nbsp; It was a difficult time, to be sure, but I've
  been able to put it behind me.&nbsp;  
I have recently married, I am starting a new job at the University of Edinburgh,
  where they plan to study the chains in more detail, and my sons have fully
  accepted my bondage without question.&nbsp; So, I have a lot to live for --
  and I am enjoying my new life.&nbsp; If I was fated to be in chains to enjoy
  this new life, so be it.&nbsp; We're Scottish women, you and me; we're strong,
  resilient and resourceful.&nbsp; These are the characteristics that helped
  me get through my African ordeal and those same qualities are at work right
  now.  
&quot;Now, in your situation, your bondage is consensual, or it appears to
  be that way, and that's good.&nbsp; In my situation, I have grown to accept
  bondage as part of my body and have had to incorporate it into my psychological
  makeup; they're on me, they're on me for good, so I'm not going to fight them.&nbsp; So
  my situation, although of non-consensual origin, has devolved into one of acceptance.  
&quot;My word of advice to you, Sheila, is to ensure your comfort zones --
  physical and psychological -- are assured and in place.&nbsp; Be sure you are
  comfortable in chains and that you have looked into your heart of hearts to
  see if this is the lifestyle for you.&nbsp; Life in permanent restraint will
  be different for you, no doubt, but I've found that women can adjust to nearly
  any thing or any situation that is thrown at them.&nbsp; You say you are making
  your decision with free will.&nbsp; Bravo, lady, take the decision and bonny
  good luck be with you.  
&quot;On a personal note Peter and I love the way they look and feel.&nbsp; Walking
  about is no big deal; I keep saying it's just like walking in a straight skirt
  all the time. By the way, my chain's 18-inches long. &nbsp;How long's yours?&quot;  
&quot;Sixteen.&quot;  
&quot;Well, girlfriend, you'll be looking at making 16-in. paces from now
  on, won't ye?&quot;  
&quot;Yes and I've been practising.&nbsp; It's really not all that bad; makes
  the hips sway and boobs bounce a bit more than I would like but I think that's
  part of the sexual allure, right?&quot;  
&quot;Right,&quot; Isabel replied.  
&quot;You said your sons have accepted your new, chained status unreservedly,&quot; Sheila
  said.&nbsp; &quot;I am still wrestling with how I am going to tell my boys.&nbsp;  
"They're 18 and 19, in the RN and their  situations
  might be made more difficult when they and their shipmates discover I am chained
  up.&nbsp; How should I tell them, Isabel?&quot;  
&quot;I don't know, my dear, and I wish I could tell you how,&quot; Isabel
  replied.&nbsp; &quot;But let's face it: you're their mother; you've decided,
  with free will, that this is how you want to be; you're not hurting anyone
  and I doubt very much you will be held up to public ridicule considering this
  lifestyle of yours so, if I were you, I would be open and candid with them.&nbsp; If
  there is fallout, let the pieces land where they may.&nbsp; I'm sure they will
  find a way to accept this little feature in their mother in the times ahead,
  Sheila.&nbsp; In fact, I think my friend, Moira, may have to come to grips
  with this same issue.&nbsp; But that's all I can say to that.&quot;  
The women smiled knowingly at each other and sipped delicately at their fiery,
  strong Scottish liqueurs.&nbsp; A friendship seemed to be blossoming.  
&quot;Do you mind if I give Michael a precis  of our
  conversation, Isabel?&quot; Sheila asked.&nbsp; &quot;After all, he's an important
  part in the decision-making process.&nbsp; He's my husband.&quot;  
&quot;Please do.&nbsp; I encourage it, Sheila.&nbsp; Communication's the
  key to the success of any relationship and I would tell Peter the same if I
  were you.&quot;  
&quot;Isabel, I'm just delighted you found the time to spend a few moments
  with me on this subject,&quot; Sheila said, reaching for her purse. &quot;I
  don't want to keep you away from Peter any longer and Michael and I have some
  work to do in the kitchen before bed.&nbsp; May I leave you now?&quot;  
&quot;Good night, Sheila, it's been my pleasure.&nbsp; And good luck with
  your decision.&nbsp; I hope you will be happy with the results and that the
  boys will accept.&nbsp; Let me know, OK?&quot;  
The two women parted with a heartfelt hug and both clinked off, hips swaying
  and bosoms bouncing decorously, to look for their husbands and a start to their
  nightly sexual rituals.  
&quot;Well, that was a nice long chat, Isabel,&quot; Peter said, when Isabel
  came into the hotel room, plopping on the bedside beside him.&nbsp; &quot;Yes,
  it was very nice.&nbsp; And I'll tell you a bit about it someday.&nbsp;  
 But right now,&quot; Isabel said, slipping out of her long gown, &quot;I
  want some action from you.&nbsp; I want us to spend the night in the cells
  below and you can chain me up the way I was in Africa.&nbsp; I will tell you
  which chain goes where and how the ring-gag goes in.&nbsp; That's how I want
  to spend my first night here with you, my love.&quot;  
Peter was smiling like the Cheshire cat as Isabel purred to herself, slipping
  into her sexy, long blue nightgown that showed her still-chained breasts to
  such startling effect. She swung her chained legs off the bed, her chain-connected
  breasts swaying, nicely tugging on Isabel's nipples, as she took Peter by the
  hand toward the door and down the empty hall toward the basement luxury cellblock.  
&nbsp;They took the last of four heavy oaken doors on the left side of the
  dim hallway and Peter opened the door with a creak.&nbsp; Stepping inside,
  they found an 8- X 10-foot stonewalled prisoner's cell complete with cot, small
  barred window, sturdy ringbolts on all walls, the floor and ceiling, a large
  chest on the side opposite the couch, a nightstand, telephone and bidet.  
Everything they could ever want for a sexy night in steel bondage, Isabel
  thought, as she threw her arms around Peter and gave him a deep kiss, grinding
  her breasts and hips into his chest and loins.&nbsp;  
The embrace went on for 15 minutes and they were entirely ready for sex-in-bondage
  by the time they released one another in a gasp of pent-up excitement and emotion.  
Isabel suddenly sniffed back a tear as a flashback sent her mind to her comfortable
  East African prison cell for a moment.&nbsp; She quickly recovered, thinking
  this time would be entirely different.&nbsp; This time it would be consensual,
  just like Sheila's upcoming decision, and she looked forward to the weight
  of chains that would soon adorn her limbs, neck and waist.  
Isabel was in charge.&nbsp; &quot;Peter, get a long chain from the chest
  and lock it securely round my waist.&quot;&nbsp; That was done and Isabel felt
  the cool snugness of the 3/16ths-inch oblong-linked waist chain.  
&quot;Now, get a ring shackle and fasten it on the centre link of my ankle
  chain.&quot;&nbsp; That was done, with a solid snap.  
&quot;Run the long part of the waist chain down through the centre link and
  attach it to a pair of handcuffs and lock the cuffs on me.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then
  I want a steel collar and a 30-foot chain that should be attached to that ringbolt
  above the cot; then I'll show you how to put in the ring gag.&quot;  
Peter did as instructed and in one minute, 10 seconds, Mrs. Isabel Metcalfe
  was Peter's chained slavegirl in a prison cell in the far reaches of Northern
  Scotland.&nbsp; And she loved it.  
Isabel sat on the edge of the bed, arranged her chains and pulled her nightgown
  up over the waist chain and smoothing it back down again so the long chain
  was against her loins and legs -- the way she wanted it.  
&quot;Peter, the ring gag goes in behind my upper and lower teeth. My mouth
  will be propped open and you can lock the two chains behind my neck, just above
  the collar, right here, see?&quot;&nbsp; She gestured to the back of her neck
  with her chained hands that pulled the ankle-connecting chain taut against
  her front with a smooth rustle of chain as it passed through the centre link
  of her ankle chain..  
Peter retrieved the gag from the bottom of the chest, turned it around to
  see how it would go in and put it beside Isabel to give her the deepest, sexiest
  kiss of their relationship.&nbsp;  
Isabel, moaning in ecstasy, panted out: &quot;Put it in now, love.&quot;  
Peter kneeled in front of his bride,&nbsp; placed the 3&frac12;-in.-diameter
  steel ring in Isabel's wide-open mouth and stood up to run the small chains
  behind her head , snapping the little brass lock in place to join the two ends
  just above the lock of her steel slave collar.&nbsp; Peter had used six sturdy,
  small, brass padlocks -- at the wall ringbolt, collar, gag, wristcuffs and
  waist chain -- to secure his wife to herself, and to the wall, for the night.  
The slender silver chains were snug against Isabel's cheeks.  
&quot;Aawwwfff,&quot; Isabel moaned, looking at her husband straight in the
  eye as he moved away to undress.&nbsp; &quot;Aa-oov-ooo-eee-naow&quot; (make
  love to me now).&nbsp;  
She drew her legs up onto the little cot, arranged her chains and spread
  her legs as wide as her 18-inch chain would allow, lifting her hem up to her
  waist.&nbsp; The waist chain ran down the side of her left leg and back up
  to her 12-inch handcuffs which she kept at her waist. Her neck chain was in
  an untidy, little pile on the thick pillow beside her right ear and her mouth
  gaped open lasciviously.&nbsp;  
Isabel tried to smile as Peter sat beside his chained wife and caressed her
  face, tracing the gag's chains where they ran from the sides of the gag indenting
  her cheeks to the back of her neck, tickling her delightfully.  
&quot;Aah-icks&quot; (that tickles).&nbsp; &quot;Ock&quot; (stop).&nbsp; She
  glared at him in a mock-menacing way.&nbsp; What could she do, anyway, bound
  as she was.  
&quot;All righty, dear, be with you in a moment.&quot;&nbsp; Peter was undressed
  in a flash and seconds later was pummelling Isabel's chained loins rhythmically
  with a creak of bedsprings and clink-chink of chains that turned into a symphony
  of percussive sexual energy.  
Isabel's chest, with the locket still jammed between her pancaked, chained
  breasts, heaved in gaspy breaths though her O-shaped mouth, propped to its
  widest by the stainless-steel ring gag.&nbsp; Peter's sweat dripped onto her
  face and into her mouth.&nbsp; He subdued the growing signs of his approaching
  climax by driving his manhood deep into his woman's warm, moist recesses and
  stayed there momentarily until the sexual surge subsided.  
Five minutes later, he kissed her on her open mouth and Isabel tried to return
  the gesture, thwarted instantly by the implacable gag, succeeding only in flattening
  her lips even more around her propped-open gums.&nbsp;  
&quot;Ah-ant-iffuu&quot; (I can't kiss you), she gasped.&nbsp; Peter responded
  with another, deeper kiss and Isabel started to moan with her first orgasm,
  her husband's cock deep inside her.  
&lt; fall not would they ensure bed side onto hang core shook orgasms five
  series moaned writhed She explode.&nbsp; going was she thought thrusts.&nbsp; powerful
  his counterpoint loins Peter's against forcefully hips bucked sobs choked,
  coming breath cried, coming) I'm (Oh, ah-cnnggg,?)  
When the last, big, bright-blue flash faded from her eyes, Isabel gasped
  finally, &quot;Ooaa, e-ohop-ow.&nbsp; Aah-inif-ooff.&quot; (OK, I'm on top
  now. I'll finish you off.)&nbsp; Peter slipped out of her with a wet plop and
  Isabel awkwardly squirmed in her tangle of chains out from underneath him.&nbsp; Peter
  assumed Isabel's position in the damp cot and Isabel was astride his hips quickly
  and easily, her ankle chains across Peter's shins.&nbsp;  
Isabel's neck chain descended gracefully to its mooring on the ringbolt just
  above the bed and she held her wrist chains at waist level, looping her thumbs
  into her waist chain for support. She leaned forward slightly as Peter slid
  his steel-hard cock inside effortlessly and the two began their chained tango
  again. Slowly and rhythmically, Peter made love to his wife, stopping from
  time to time to brush a lock of hair away from her gag, then resuming the steady,
  thrust-per-second pace they loved.&nbsp; Five minutes of thrust and counterpoint
  and Isabel felt herself being carried away by her second &quot;pop.&quot;&nbsp;  
Peter stopped suddenly. She ground her pelvis deep down, ramming his cock
  deep into the neck of her cervix.  
&quot;Waffock?&quot; (Why stop) Isabel asked, her orgasm fading slightly
  for a moment.&nbsp;  
&quot;Minor technical adjustment; please stand by,&quot; Peter announced.&nbsp; Isabel
  rolled her eyes and gulped with difficulty as Peter reached up to slide down
  her nightgown's slender shoulder strings to her elbows.&nbsp; Isabel shrugged
  her shoulders cooperatively and the bodice of her beautiful, blue nightgown
  slipped off her ripe, pendulous breasts, exposing her ringed and chained tits
  for Peter's attentions. &nbsp;Peter reached for the locket chain that connected
  her nipples and placed it between his teeth, gently pulling Isabel towards
  him.&nbsp; Her breasts fell forward gracefully and Isabel felt the gentle tug
  on her nipples as they began thrusting and counterpointing again.  
Isabel was gasping through her wide-open mouth as Peter let go the locket
  chain and found the tiny clasp with his hands.&nbsp; He fumbled with the tiny,
  little lock, opened it and pulled the chain gently through her nipples.&nbsp;  
&quot;Mmm-ooo, ee-ih-innn&quot; (No, leave it in) Isabel moaned.&nbsp; Peter
  pulled the chain through her nipple rings and dropped the chain on the night
  strand.&nbsp;  
 Isabel's perfect 38-C breasts were free for the first time in many hours
  and they both looked at, and felt, their jostling motion as Isabel pounded
  her hips in frenzy against Peter's loins.&nbsp; Up-down, up-down, they flopped,
  making slapping sounds as they jostled against each other in time with Peter's
  thrusts.&nbsp; Se ran her breasts over Peter's face then straightened up and
  grabbed her nipple rings with both chained hands, pulling on them for the added
  sensations for both of them.&nbsp; She pulled her breasts almost straight out
  from her chest and sighed softly.  
Isabel dropped her breasts as Peter suddenly pounded her hard,15 times in
  15 seconds, gritted his teeth and slammed his eyes shut to spurt a gigantic
  load of semen deep into her cervix.&nbsp; Isabel's eyes widened over the gag
  as she felt him hit bottom, deep inside her, and she gasped in ecstasy again
  as another, brilliant-blue orgasm swept over her at the same time as Peter's.  
The two collapsed in each other's arms, utterly spent, and did not stir until
  morning.&nbsp; When they awoke, at 8 a.m. next day, Saturday, they were in
  the same position as the night before: Peter's semi-rigid cock deeply imbedded
  in Isabel and her chains tangled every which way, her arms around Peter's head,
  her knees bent double and their chests together in a sexy swath of sweaty flesh,
  silk and shackles.  
Isabel stirred first.&nbsp;  
&quot;Ooaahheef&quot; (Oh, my knees), she said, as she tried to straighten
  her legs from their doubled-up position that resembled her hogtie of weeks
  ago.&nbsp; &quot;Eee-faaa-gggh?&quot; (please, the gag), she asked, motioning
  with her chained wrists to her mouth that had been propped wide nearly eight
  hours.&nbsp; &quot;IFF-burr-ff&quot; (it hurts).&nbsp; Isabel brushed her hair
  from her face, dragging the chains across her body, and pulled her nightgown
  back up her still-damp bosom.&nbsp; Peter got the key to her gag which he strategically
  placed on the nightstand hours before.&nbsp; Soon the saliva-coated gag slipped
  out of Isabel's mouth and they embraced again.  
Isabel slipped down beside her husband on the narrow cot and they hugged,
  sharing each other's warmth, and Isabel reached up to place her chained wrists
  over Peter's neck, resting her hands on his shoulder blades.  
&quot;Isabel, it's always a pleasure with you.&nbsp; Always.&nbsp; I hope
  our sex life continues like this until we are 95,&quot; Peter said.&nbsp;  
Isabel reached up over his head again and placed her chained hands on his
  chest to say, &quot;It's always great for me, too.&nbsp; The chains now are
  just incidental.&nbsp; I enjoy the sheer animal nature of our lust and the
  chains just seem to be a small, but important, part of our sex life now, don't
  they?&quot;  
They lay in each other's arms, quietly avoiding the knock from Sheila on
  the cell door for breakfast.&nbsp; Peter estimated nearly five pounds of 3/16ths,
  oblong-linked, zinc-plated chain had held his wife captive for eight hours,
  in addition to her permanent restraints.  
&quot;Five pounds of these on you last night and this morning, Is.,&quot; Peter
  said, pointing to her links.&nbsp; &quot;Did it seem to be that heavy to you?&nbsp; I
  hope they weren't too uncomfortable.&quot;  
Isabel rolled over with a rattle of her chains.&nbsp; &quot;My chains in
  Africa weighed about five pounds, maybe more,&quot; Isabel said.&nbsp; &quot;They
  were riveted on and these are locked.&nbsp; The only thing about last night
  that was uncomfortable was the gag. It woke me up about 4 a.m. but I fell back
  to sleep.&nbsp; Other than that I had a wonderful night.&nbsp; And you?&quot;  
&quot;Tee-riff.&quot;  
It was nearly noon when they decided, reluctantly, to unlock Isabel's chains,
  but they had a luncheon engagement with Moira and Graham who had an equally
  torrid night in bed with Moira shackled and gagged, through prior agreement,
  the same way as her friend.  
In the bright, airy dining room again, Moira was wearing a straight, grey
  skirt and a snug, beige turtleneck sweater which showed her braless figure
  to outstanding effect.&nbsp; Her ankle chains were snugly attached above her
  comfortable loafers and her wrists, cheeks and neck bore the fading, red marks
  of a particularly chafing night from her shackles and gag.&nbsp; Her nipples
  tingled from Graham's long attention last night and this morning.&nbsp;  
Isabel, whose ringed nipples were also sensitive against the silk blouse,
  wore her best skirt and jacket which she wore for the trip up.&nbsp;  
All four were smiling as they sat down to enjoy a Saturday brunch of Scottish
  ham and eggs, gallons of coffee and huge oatmeal cookies to end.  
As planned, Sheila appeared with a sheaf of papers for Moira to sign: release
  forms, agreements and pro forma  notarised statements
  attesting to the agreement between Hotel Balmoral and Moira and Graham MacPeak
  that the parties had arranged that Mrs. MacPeak's ankles would be chained by
  shackles, to be chosen by her, for an indeterminate period, at least one year,
  for 20 pounds sterling -- the cost only of the restraints -- and that at the
  one-year anniversary, Mrs. MacPeak could decide whether to have them removed
  or kept in place.  
Moira signed the forms with a flourish and passed the sheaf of paper to Graham
  which he signed with a serious look.&nbsp; Moira looked at him and winked over
  her coffee and Graham cracked a big smile.  
&quot;My ankles are still chained from the night before,&quot; Isabel,&quot; Sheila
  offered.&nbsp; &quot;No problem at all last night.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
She turned and walked away, hips swaying and breasts bobbing underneath her
  cardigan as Moira leaned over to Isabel to whisper, &quot;She told me a local
  metalworker is to come in about 15 minutes to rivet this really beautiful pair
  of ankle chains that were in our room on my legs.&nbsp; Riveted. Isabel!&nbsp; What
  do you think?&quot;  
&quot;Ach, rivets,&quot; Isabel replied.&nbsp; &quot;They can always be hammered
  out.&nbsp; Get yourself a pair like mine.&nbsp; On forever.&quot;  
The two chained women looked at their men and out at hotel's sunny front
  yard with the grey seacoast as a forbidding, fogbound backdrop.&nbsp; Moira's
  nipples grew erect as they watched a little black van drive up with &quot;Ned's
  metalworks and fabrication Welds and riveting work our specialties Tobermory.&nbsp; (Tel.
  022-555-2345)&quot; painted in four-in. letters on the sides.  
Moira's entry into permanent bondage had just begun.&nbsp; Sheila, too, was
  making preparations for Ned's work on her ankles.
