The door flew open and I felt the air against my cheek. They
pushed me out and I struggled to keep up. It was raining. The manacles pulled
against my legs and I slipped. I felt my knee hit the wet ground and I yelped.
Someone yelled in my ear and pulled me to my feet roughly. He slapped me in the
face and I screamed again. 

&nbsp;

Inside it was cold and damp. I wished I was still outside.
The sound of rattling chains and stomping boots resonated weirdly. I heard a
door creaked open. They stopped moving, and stood me up. Someone pulled on my
hands for a few seconds. I pulled back, and with a click I was able to pull my
hands in front of me. He ripped the rag off my eyes, and pushed me forward. The
door slammed.

&nbsp;

I staggered forward, reeling from the push, and fell onto my
knees again. My legs were still manacled. I sat down on the floor and rubbed my
wrists. I was in a dimly lit, bare room. I reached down to my feet and tried to
loosen the cuffs. Pulling on the chain only made noise, and I gave up. 

&nbsp;

Three men walked into the room, throwing the door open so
violently it banged against the wall. I crawled away from them. They were
talking amongst themselves in a foreign language. At least two of them were.
The one in front, clearly the leader, said something to me in a different
language. The two behind him immediately stopped talking. 

&nbsp;

It was quiet for a few seconds. I looked up at them from the
floor, and my lip started trembling. I sniffed and wiped my eye. I didn't know
what to do. My heart was beating a million times a second, and everything was
almost surreal. 

&nbsp;

On a signal from the leader, the two behind walked towards
me. I shrank back, and when one of them reached for me I screamed. Holding me
by my arms, they forced me into a standing position. Struggling hopelessly, I
looked at the third guy through blurry eyes. He looked back at me, straight
into my eyes, and I literally saw stars. 

&nbsp;

The pain was so intense I could hear myself screaming as if
I was across the room. I couldn't really tell what part of me hurt, just that
it was so intense I could barely see. Supported by the two guys, I closed my
eyes and screamed silently. I took deep breaths, tears trickling out of my
closed eyes. My head cleared, and my chest started hurting. I tried to stand up
on my own, but the two guys were still holding my arms on both sides. My hands
shook as I did my best to pull away, but they didn't even budge. 

&nbsp;

�Let her go,� someone said in a slight accent. 

&nbsp;

Both hands disappeared and I struggled for a second to stand
on my own. Leaning against the back wall, I wiped my eyes with one hand and
looked at the leader guy. He had the same expressionless look on his face. 

&nbsp;

�Strip.�

&nbsp;

The word echoed in my head. On some level I was expecting
it, and at the same time praying they would never... shivering, I hugged myself
tightly. The leader's eyes darted to the right and I saw the other two come at
me again. 

&nbsp;

Screaming, I turned to one side and came face to face with
one of the guards. I pushed against him, my arms flailing, and he tried to
force me back with both hands. This time I saw him reach into his pocket and
pull out a little phone sized device with two prongs sticking out one side. I
felt the other guys hand reach around my neck and pull me back. I screamed
hysterically, tears pouring down my chin. 

&nbsp;

�I'll do it! I'll do it!� I screamed, finding my voice. The
guy in front of me paused and looked at the leader. I looked at him too,
pleading with my eyes. He didn't move, still staring into my eyes. The room was
suddenly so quiet I could hear my heart beat. 

&nbsp;

The leader's face changed subtly. The corner of his mouth
curled � was he smiling? I felt the arm around my neck tighten again and I
screamed. The guard in front of me grabbed my blouse and pulled down. It hurt
already. I felt something cold against my bare chest and struggled harder. They
whispered to each other and the guy behind me let go. Everything blanked out
for a second. 

&nbsp;

I felt the cold, damp floor against my skin and whimpered.
It was worse then the first time. The pain seemed to get worse, and I closed my
eyes opening my mouth to scream. My hand clutched at the floor for something to
hold on to. I felt like I was falling even though I was lying on the ground. 

&nbsp;

I felt a boot prodding me in the back. Twisting on the
ground, I looked up and saw one of the guards looking down at me. 

&nbsp;

�Stupid bitch.� 

&nbsp;

Someone grabbed me by the thighs and turned me onto my back.
Another pair of hands grabbed my blouse and pulled. My hurt so bad I honestly
didn't care what they were doing. I felt something cold against my chest again
� and it was like waking up. I sat up screaming, my hands pushing wildly. 

&nbsp;

�Please... don't... no...� my voice faded as they
aggressively forced me back down. Someone laughed. It didn't feel like two
prongs, it was more smooth and long. Lifting my head painfully, I couldn't see
a thing and gave up. The metal moved down my stomach, making me shiver. It
wasn't the prong, it was a pair of scissors. 

&nbsp;

From both ends, I felt hands ripping my clothes off. I was
exhausted. They tried to pull my hand through the sleeve, but gave up half way
and just cut it off. The other guy undid the cuffs on my legs and pulled off my
shoes. I was wearing stockings under my skirt, so he reached up under the skirt
and pulled down my stockings. 

&nbsp;

I squirmed as the guy finished cutting off my bra. He put a
hand on my breasts and squeezed lightly. I started crying again, tears running
down the side of my face. Both started pulling my skirt down, talking to
themselves. I tried to close my thighs, but one of the guys was kneeling
between my legs. They cut the skirt lengthwise and just pulled it out from
under me. 

&nbsp;

With nothing left on me but panties, they paused for a
second� as if to relish their victory.
I'd love to say that at this point I didn't care. I felt his hand close over my
pussy, feeling it through the sheer material. I closed my eyes, making a fist
with my right hand. They slowly, gently, cut the panties twice. The leader said
something sharply and they finished in an instant. 

&nbsp;

I curled up into the fetal position, holding myself and
shivering. Stripped naked, the room felt colder. I felt every draft in the
room. I cried softly, my mind completely numb. 

&nbsp;

The leader said something I couldn't understand. I didn't
even know what language it was.

&nbsp;

�Kelly,� one of the guards answered. I looked up at the
leader. He was smiling crudely. 

&nbsp;

The guards bent down and pulled me up again. I tried to
cover myself, but they held my hands by my sides. The leader opened the door
and they followed, dragging me with them. I kept my head down and stared at my
feet. A tear slid down my nose and I sniffed. 

&nbsp;

One of the guards giggled to himself� and reached between my legs. I opened my
mouth to scream, but the other guard put a hand over my mouth. The leader was
walking directly in front of me. I moaned, trying to get his attention, but I
could barely hear myself. Relentlessly pushing forward as they molested me, he
stuck a finger up into my pussy. I rubbed against each time I took a step. 

&nbsp;

I tried to stop, but they kept dragging me. With his hand
between my legs like that, his face was right on level with mine as we walked.
I looked at him and he reached forward to kiss me. I turned away, crying. 

&nbsp;

We neared the end of a corridor. Just as quickly as they started,
they stopped. I whimpered quietly as soon as he took his hand off my face. The
leader stopped near a door at the end of the corridor and looked back at me.
His eyes narrowed, but he didn't say anything. He turned the handle and threw
the door open.

&nbsp;

The guards dragged me past the leader and into the room.
There was a rug on the floor, and a large bed filled at least half the room. It
reminded me of a hotel. Someone was sprawled on the bed, but the guys on either
side of me blocked my view. The leader swore under his breath.

&nbsp;

�Owen. Owen!� He clapped his hands loudly and I flinched. It
was quiet for a few seconds, then there was a loud slamming noise. I closed my
eyes and tried to stop crying. 

&nbsp;

�Here.� I heard a tinkle and one of the guards let go of my
arm. I hugged it to my body and opened my eyes. The guy wasn't blocking my view
anymore, and for a few seconds I could see the room clearly. The leader was
standing to one side of the bed, looking at the guy on the bed � Owen, I guess.


&nbsp;

Owen's eyes were almost fully closed. His head slowly bobbed
up and down, like he was nodding continuously. He had a black hoodie on, and
one of the sleeves was rolled up. 

&nbsp;

They pulled my wrists behind my back. I felt the cuffs
tighten, then something clicked. One of them shoved me in the back. I wasn't
expecting it, and I fell onto the floor. I sat up awkwardly and drew my knees
up against my chest. The cuffs were uncomfortably tight. 

&nbsp;

Both of the guards were standing in the doorway, just
outside the room. The leader leaned back against the wall and lit a cigarette.

&nbsp;

�We got like 15 minutes until this bum comes down,� he said,
motioning at Owen and flicking ash onto the dresser. He shrugged and sucked on
his cigarette. I couldn't place his accent. 

&nbsp;

�My names Trent... I forget what those two are called...�
The 'conversation' soured, and he smoked for a few minutes in silence. My mind
was in utter denial. This couldn't be happening to me. But it was. I just...
I...

&nbsp;

�Your eyes are red.� 

&nbsp;

I looked back up at Trent. He tossed his cigarette on the
floor and stepped on it, walking towards me. I was already as far against the
wall as possible, but I still tried to get even further away from him. 

&nbsp;

He squatted in front of me and looked into my eyes. I looked
away. He grabbed my chin and forced me to look at him. I whimpered. Trent
rolled his eyes and stood up again. 

&nbsp;

�I've been doing this for a long time, and I still don't get
it.� He flicked his lighter open again and lit another cigarette. �Ok, you're
scared, we just kidnapped you, bla bla bla whatever. I get that. Why the fuck
aren't you fighting back?� He looked right at me again, blowing smoke through
his nose.

&nbsp;

�That guy's the one you should be afraid of,� he said
pointing at Owen. �I'm just the messenger.� I didn't say anything. 

&nbsp;

�Look, I won't hurt you... If I was in your place I'd fight
until I bled to death. Just fucking answer me!� He squatted down in front of me
again.

&nbsp;

�Huh? Say something.� He slapped me in the cheek a few time
lightly. I started crying, trying to hide my face from him. He grabbed me by
the neck, pulling my head towards his. I started gagging.

&nbsp;

�C'mon, why don't you fight back?� Trent whispered, his face
inches from mine. 

&nbsp;

�You'll... hurt me,� I whispered in between sobs. Trent let
go of me and stood up. I buried my head in my knees, crying harder. 

&nbsp;

�Hey, at least you're telling the truth. The last one was a
goddamn liar,� Trent said thoughtfully. A second ago he was so worked up I
thought he was going to strangle me or something. �I hate liars...�

&nbsp;

�I kinda like liars,� someone said slowly.

&nbsp;

�Owen! Welcome back.� 

&nbsp;

�Do you do that 'fight back' line on everyone?� Owen
sounded totally relaxed, slurring his words slightly. 

&nbsp;

�Yeah, whatever. Where's the money.� 

&nbsp;

�There's a box under the bed. Yeah, that side. Take a couple
hundred grand... eh. Just take it all. We're cool.�

&nbsp;

Trent rummaged under the bed for a second and pulled out a
suitcase. He opened it, and just stared at it. 

&nbsp;

�What's her name?�

&nbsp;

�Kelly,� Trent muttered under his breath, never taking his
eyes off the money. Owen sat up on the bed and looked at me.

&nbsp;

�That guy is pro,� he said in a half whisper, clearly to me.
�He counts money without touching it. Does it every time.� He raised his
eyebrows and glanced at Trent, then back at me. He seemed... friendly. 

&nbsp;

�Alright.� Trent closed the suitcase with a snap. �You know
how to reach me.� He tipped his head in a mini bow, and turned to leave.

&nbsp;

�Oh � Trent. Could you do me a big favor? Kill the other
two; they know too much.� 

&nbsp;

Trent paused for a second, then continued out. He closed the
door behind him carefully. It was quiet for a second. 

&nbsp;

�It's just us now,� Owen said cheerfully. He got off the bed
and stretched, yawning. He looked to be in his thirties, tall, skinny, angular
face. He smiled at me, his entire face beaming. I sniffed quietly. 

&nbsp;

�Trent always forgets this,� he said to himself, shaking his
head and chuckling. I could see a black piece of cloth in his hand. Walking
towards me, he wrapped the piece of cloth around his hand, still smiling
broadly. I was scared, but it didn't fit. This guy was... harmless. 

&nbsp;

Owen kneeled in front of me, bringing his face on level with
mine. His pupils were tiny. Placing one hand behind my head, I suddenly figured
out what he was doing and jerked my head away. He pulled the cloth over my eyes
and tightened it painfully over my eyes. I shook my head, trying to get the
blind off. 

&nbsp;

�Shh... nice and snug... there.� Owen gently pulled some of
my hair out of the blind. Something touched my nipple and I screamed. There are
no words to describe how vulnerable I felt. He let go quickly. I sobbed, my
blind becoming wet. My wrists felt numb.

&nbsp;

Out of the blue, I felt something pushing under my armpits.
I screamed, flailing with my legs. Owen chuckled, and after a dizzying moment I
landed on something soft. I squirmed, trying to roll off the bed, but he held
me down by my thighs. 

&nbsp;

�I'm curious about you Kelly,� Owen whispered softly,
spreading my thighs. Something touched my crotch, right above my pussy. I
whined, unable to fight back. I heard a muffled bang in the background. 

&nbsp;

�Oh, there goes one of his buddies,� Owen said sadly.
�Moment of silence for the random muscle guy Trent hired -� there was another,
similar bang in the distance. �Make that two moments of silence.� I held my
breath, waiting for something to happen.

&nbsp;

�Alright, fuck silence.� My eyes widened in pain and I
screamed.
