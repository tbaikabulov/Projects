Synopsis:  Maria is broken on the wheel while the townspeople look on.






A small dusty town on the edge of nowhere. The afternoon sun bakes the small courthouse. Maria's trial is brief: nobody was interested in defending her, and she neither could nor wanted to speak up for herself. Not that there could have been much to say. The simple fact that I am here before you condemns me, she thought. The Judge licked his lips and looked at the tall, slim blonde girl standing in front of him, arms to her sides, her lovely body hidden by the rough brown sacking of her prison dress. He told her he would sentence her... in a few days time. Till then, back into the cages.

"They're going to break you on the wheel" said one of the older women in her cage. "There's going to be a show at the end of the month and they always want capital cases for it... the prettier the better."

The looks the other women gave her ranged from the jealous to the sympathetic. Maria curled up in the corner, holding onto herself. The wheel! She had always known it would be her fate. She had heard much about it in the past. An execution like that, you could only be a spectator if you had a lot of money. Not like a simple hanging or a decap. She trembled to herself, swaddled in her rough dress with no underwear beneath. Yes, she was going to be a capital case, she knew it, she had always known it. And she knew about the show...

The following day, she could hardly eat the prison bread and sipped water only. Her friend tried to encourage her, saying she'd get so thin she'd be like a bundle of sticks if she didn't eat. Maria had always prided herself on her long and slender arms and legs and smiled sadly.
"Is it really awful... the wheel, I mean?"
"I don't know Maria. Please don't think about it so... you know those old women are just jealous of us, and you never know, the Judge might be lenient. You're still almost a child."
Maria shook her head and shivered. She knew well what the Judge was like with children. What is more, she knew he would be there at the show in his rightful place at the front.

Three days later, she was brought up again to the court house. The Judge looked at her a long time as she stood quiet, head slightly bowed, arms at her sides. The shapeless rough sdress ended at her elbows and knees, and she was barefoot on the cool stone flags.

"You. What am I going to do with you?" The Judge looked round at the other men in the court some of whom sniggered. "You think?" he asked them. "Prisoner!"
"Yes Judge?" Her heart beat so fast she was sure she would pass out.
"We are a decent society here on the edge. And we protect our privacy, to do what we like in private. But you... You are not protected by us any longer and you have lost all your rights to belonging. From now on, you are an animal and will be treated as one. Show us your legs."

Maria's head reeled. She had expected it? The hearing is always worse than the expecting, she knew that. And now he wanted her to... in front of all these men...

"Hurry up, raise your dress, show the court your legs!"
"Y..yes Judge" she gathered the material in her hands and pulled it up, above her knees, to the top of her slender thighs.
"Higher!"
They wanted her to expose herself! She gasped and convulsively pulled the dress up, exposing her vagina and the start of her tummy.
"Keep it there, animal."
They were looking at her legs, she realised. They made her turn round and were not satisfied because the cheeks of her bottom were hidden. She raised her&nbsp; dress higher still, face burning.
"All right. Let it go, turn round."

His face... was like a beast, she decided. Red, his eyes were sunk deep into his face and he licked his lips frequently. She had not seen him as beastly before even when she had lain next to him, her lithe body wrapped around his squat fat one. Sometimes he would appear almost bored, not wishing to be there, mechanically pumping into her and as mechanically releasing.

"You will be broken on the wheel for a paying audience on the last day of this month." His words came out slowly, deliberately. "Because young female animals in your position sometimes try to cheat us of the value they represent, you will be kept naked in solitary confinement until then. Officers of the court may visit you. Do you understand, animal?"

Maria simply stared at him in unbelievable fascination, unable to utter a word.

"Oh strip her completely, let's all have a preview" he growled after several moments of silence. "Go on, do it."

Her wrists were held as she felt her dress pulled off her, and then she was standing naked in the centre of the court, arms pressed tight to her sides, head bowed, trying not to sob her tears. It was no use. The men watched as her body finally shook with one sob, a tear ran down her nose, and then another, splashing on her breast. Then she was weeping freely, unwilling to move or meet their faces. Especially not that man who sat in front of her and had passed judgement on her. It was... the culmination of all the things that had happened to her in her short life. She was now reduced to an animal who had no rights, naked and in their power.

"Take her away, the bitch!"
She felt a harsh slap on her bottom, and then the guards held her, each by a wrist, and pulled her away, out of the courtroom into the blinding sunlight which she felt on her bare back, through the dusty courtyard, and into the coolness of the prison. Her cell was tiny. It was barely wide enough for her to sit down and her head touched the ceiling if she stood upright. There was a small stone step on which she could perch her bottom. The door was double: in front of her, steel bars, then a heavy wooden thing with a peephole at eye level. There was a small shelf on which plates of food could be left, she noticed, miserably. And there was a hole in one corner of the cell from which a cool dusty wind blew up her bare legs. She knew what that was for.

She huddled her arms around herself and tried to compose herself to waiting. The end of the month.... how many days was that? Would she still be sane by then?

The Judge of course visited her. He banged the doors open and advanced right into the cell on her as she shrank back against the wall from him. He stroked her face roughly with his hand.
"Pretty bitch" he sneered, and his hand grasped her breast, squeezing it hard. "Such nice titties on you, too. Spread your legs. Do you masturbate yourself in this shithole?"
She shook her head, dumbly.
"You should do. Passes the time of day." He stroked her hips, feeling the hip bone with his thumb. "Nice and thin, marked you out as soon as set eyes on you all those years ago. You'll make a lovely show. You were a wheeliegirl from the start, know that?" He pushed his lips on hers and gave her a resounding kiss.

"My wheelygirl. I'm going to have a front seat, as well, mark my words. Here, I want you to do something for me."
"Mmm... me?"
"Yes. I'm going to be sitting in the front, I'm going to watch how you get all broken up. You'll be screaming your pretty little head off all the time then. But later on, when they hoist you back up... I want you to do something for me then."
"Ohh!!!" She could hardly find words in her terror. "Is it so bad then?"
"Oh yes" he said in a thick voice. "It will be unimaginably bad. You know all about it, but you have to experience it for yourself to know just how awful it's going to be. The public humiliation, the breaking of your arms and legs... But the wheeliegirls I've seen, they get quiet after they've been hoisted back up for while, and everyone'll be busy watching the others. That's when I want you to do it."
"Do..."
"Look at me. Blow me a kiss. Smile at me. Flirt with your eyes, you know how, you're a pretty girl. Give me a come-on."
"Could I..."
"You will. Look, I always promised I was going to do something for you as well, and I will, but only if you do this thing for me."

"What.... my god.... the raven?" She burst into tears and he grabbed her slender wrists and forced them away from her face.
"Yes, the raven. I'll make sure he comes to you. A few pecks from his beak and you'll be in another world like I always promised you. There'll be a lot of ravens and crows and other vermin besides... the smell of raw flesh brings them. But you will know the one I send."
"Your... raven...."
"Yes, my raven, pretty girl. So. What say you, Maria? A deal? You'll be sweet to me when you're hoisted?"
She was going to tell him something, anything to hurt him and to deny him what he saw as pleasure, but habits of obedience held her back. She nodded her head gravely. She didn't know what it would be like - she had no idea of knowing - but she had dimly understood all her life that the bite of a raven would bring her to a long-desired close. She could not afford to let that slim chance go. She nodded her head, heart thudding.

He patted her cheek. "You're a nice girl, Maria. I have fucked you, taken you from your family, used you every way I wanted. In other circumstances, you could have been my wife. But I condemned you. And this is what we in our heart of hearts have always wanted, isn't it? No other."

He gave her a kiss that was almost tender, and then the doors slammed behind his retreating back. Maria bent against the cold bars and sobbed hysterically, pressing her face against the cold iron. That evening, as well as the usual bread there were a few dried plums and the cup was half wine half water. She tried to steel herself not to take it, but her hunger and her weak will got the better of her. The plums were delicious. The wine... she savoured every last drop, remembering other times when they had drunk lovely wine and laughed in the sunshine. Sweet, memories like flowing water. Uh... That was it. No more left in the wooden cup. It clattered to the floor.

Her time was spent half asleep, half awake. The nights were bad, because they were still chilly out there on the edge. The days were warm, and she revived. Her heart beat faster when she heard people outside, but nobody ever came in to speak to her. She wanted the Judge again, but he did not come.

Then suddenly the door did open once more, and a thickset, muscular man appeared. He swung the bars open, and advanced on her. He grabbed her upper arm and pulled her upright.
"Tomorrow."
"Ohhh!!!! Tomorrow?"
"Yes. Your last night." He was feeling her upper arm. "Long and slender. Nice. Judge was right." He felt her forearm and she winced at the pressure of his fingers.
"You think that hurts?" She realised she was talking to her executioner and nodded, dumbly.
He slapped her breasts. "Going to have to keep those held up somehow, otherwise they'll just sag when you're on your back. Hairy little cunt for your age, isn't it. Ummmm..." he grasped the top of her thigh and squeezed hard. "Nice fine bones. You ever danced much in your life?"
"Yy... yess.... some..."
"Too bad. I'm going to try and break your bones in two places above your knee, once below, and then smash up those pretty ankles a bit." He glanced up to see how she was taking it. Her face was a white mask.

"You know what's going to happen, don't you, little wheeliegirl?"

Maria nodded her head. She had cried so much she was dry of tears, and she had been so afraid she thought she no longer had the ability to feel fear. She just shook her head at the man kneeling in front of her, handling her bare legs.
"You're going to be broken on a wheel" he told her, looking up. "A big one, for a big girl like you. Your arms and legs will be broken and wrapped round the wheel spokes. I'm very careful as I break you, I rarely ever break the skin on the limb, although the audience love a squirt of blood." He grinned at her. "The damage happens when you get hoisted upright again. That's when the bones I've broken start to tear through your flesh and your skin, but I'm going to make sure you're well tied up so it won't happen too fast."
Maria's brain stopped registering, she simply stared at the man who would end her life in a sickening brutal way. She suddenly saw him as what he was: a craftsman, someone who knew how to break girls on the wheel, the instrument of the Judge.

"When the audience get tired and leave, we'll put all your wheels up on the platform for the birds. You'll most probably live the night, maybe the day after. If you survive the second day you'll also live the following night." He shrugged. "But after that, in the heat? You'll most probably die of blood-poisoning. Or dehydration. Wheeliegirls are always quiet after the first night. Some last for three days. I think they most probably drift into a quiet death so it's difficult to say without poking at them. Whatever. Good night, I know, your name is Maria."

He closed the iron bars and looked at her.
"Whatever you do, whatever you say, scream, or shout... remember, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter a tiny eensy little bit. From the moment the Judge first saw you till the moment you croak it up on the wheel, nothing mattered any more. Remember that. You're really nothing, have been nothing. Not even worth fucking any more." He spat on her, his spittle landing on her tummy and dribbling down to her pussy. "Did the Judge tell you that rubbish about his magic raven?"

She gasped and nodded.
"Grow up will you?"
He slammed the outer door and she heard him walk away.

She found that night that she had taken comfort all along from the Judge's words. A comfort that suddenly had been pulled away from her... or... had it? Was there a small chance, an outside? A very very small chance? She realised that she had decided that she would try to flirt and coquette with the Judge after her ordeal anyway. She would show him gratitude. She would be remembered for the way she did it.

As if on cue, her supper was delivered. This time there was so much! Lovely juicy cakes, fresh fruit, two wooden cups, with thick milk flavoured with brandy. She chewed and munched in a frenzy. Oh yes! This was the Judge's way of reinforcing his promise to her! He had known that awful man, that... murderer would come, he had sent him of course, but he had also allowed her to be remembered of his kindness to her. She stuffed herself till she felt her tummy bulging, and drank and stuffed herself more.... until... oh my... all that feast... and she had scoffed the lot!

She leaned back on the ledge and tried to get comfortable in some way, her naked bottom and back against the stones, her long legs spread out in front of her, bare arms scraping the corner of the cell.

The promise of the raven held a strong allure for her. She imagined herself, flat on her back at the end of the day, her wheel against the darkening sky, the trail of black specks in the sky getting larger as the carrion birds circled down. What would he look like, her raven? Would he land between her breasts and peck at them with his savage beak? More and more bold as she tried hard not to shoo him away by moving her mangled body? Each time his beak would dip into the smooth flesh of her breast, the poison, entering her veins? Oh god, please let it be so... she muttered to herself... when you're at the end, there's nothing, nothing else except a promise, a legend. Would it sustain her? Would she greet every bird that landed on her body and her mangled limbs with joy, hoping this would be the one? Would she know the one?

The heavy wooden door banged open. Maria woke with a start.

"Come on, animal!" A guard unlocked the iron bars and pulled her out by the wrist, nearly puling her arm off with the violence of his thrust. That would never do, she giggled to herself hysterically. He pulled her into the hallway, where another guard joined them. One held her by the arms, shoulders back, while the other held her breasts and weighed them in his hands.
"She's pretty, though...."
"Come on.... these wheeliegirls are all pretty, you know that. Judge has taste. Smells a bit from here, though."
"Yeah..." his hand passed down her tummy to her vagina. He pulled at her pubic hair. "Blonde... so I guess some blondes don't cheat?"
"Come on, I'll get you a nice blondie girl tonight, you'll have fun with her, I promise."
"Yeah." He straightened up and looked at Maria again.
"Still, it's a pity really."
She looked back at him, matching his pity in her eyes.

They marched her slowly down the corridor, a defenceless naked girl between two uniformed men holding on to her wrists and arms on either side, not saying anything more. Were they.... normal decent young men, like her... she wondered.... she wished. She looked at the one who'd stroked her breasts and smiled a little at him. Oh god, yes! She didn't know whether to laugh or cry. He smiled back at her and looked away, embarrassed.

The yard was empty. It had high walls around it, sand on the ground. The far side ended in large stone steps that led up to a platform at roof level. That's where she'd end up, she realised. There was a rake of benches on one of the yard, three... four seats high. A few more comfortable chairs up in front. One of those would be the Judge's she knew. There were four enormous cartwheels lying flat in a semicircle. Her heart gripped as she saw them. Coils of rope between them, odd wooden spars. She was led to one side where there was a long bar against the wall. Two women... girls... completely naked, were already tethered to the bar each by a single wrist. Her wrist was lashed to the bar, expertly. She could turn around and see the other two, but they were so far apart only the tips of their fingers would touch. She gulped, turned, and nodded at them. They nodded back.

They were both tall and slender girls, late teens, early 20s. One was shivering uncontrollably; the other gazed vacantly into space in front of her after she had greeted Maria. Their bodies were well proportioned for their slenderness; Maria's breasts were the largest by far. A fourth girl was being marched in. Her body was pale and she had long black hair down her back. Like them all, she had lovely long legs and arms.

"We might as well tie this one down right now" said one of the men, in charge of the group. "Sit down on the centre hub, wheeliegirl."

The girl sat down heavily, her legs between the spokes, bottom on the hub. Maria could only see her back. One of the men gathered up her long black hair, pulled it, and tied it in a crude knot. The girl made a small "aw" sound as the men laughed.

They spread her legs out and lashed her ankles to the rim, and then two of them took her arms and forced her back down, tying her slender wrists to the other side of the rim, so she was spreadeagled in an X posture. Joking and laughing softly among themselves, the men then tied her body securely by her crotch, waist, and above her breasts to the wheel. She cried out a little as the ropes bit, and Maria saw that her body was secured very tightly. Finally, the men heaved her wheel up, and propped it up behind with two beams, so she was upright, facing the seats.

It was Maria's turn. Two men, two young men, she saw, they were all young, came and untied her wrist and led her carefully as one might escort a sister to her wheel. The older man in charge looked at her.
"You're the one with the big tits."
She looked down in shame, saw her breasts quivering. Her nipples had retreated in with fear, and she realised she hadn't peed that morning. Her bowels felt full. Rich food will do that, she understood.
"Well, let's see what we can do. Raise your arms behind your back... good little wheeliegirl..."
Her breasts pulled up like that, he passed a rope around her, underneath them, pulling a little firmly, then curled each end around her breasts in a U. 
"Okay, arms down now, wheeliegirl." She lowered her arms and he swept the hair away from the nape of her neck and did the two ends up behind her. His touch was firm, but not cruel. He led the ropes down her back, and knotted them over the small of her back again, then brought them round, and tied each end to the ropes passed round her breasts at the level of her nipples. She saw her breasts would be presented, pressed together, nipples slightly pointing out, but not distorted too much. The man walked round in front of her and pulled her breasts out, over the ropes.

"Nice. That'll do, I think. Right wheeliegirl, you saw how your friend was tied? Just sit down on the centre bit... that's right..." The wood was hard against her bottom. "Now, lie down, legs and arms well apart... don't be shy." Her back was positioned over a broad spoke and she felt the men move her legs wider apart, so her pussy was wide open. Should she feel shame any more? Her heart was beating hard again. She felt like a piece of meat as her ankles were lashed down. A few turns, a simple knot. Same with her wrists, spread out on either side. She leaned up and saw her breasts pushing out in front of her, turned her head to either side, down the length of her arms, saw the ropes around her wrists.

"Looks quite nice, tits all tied up like that."
"Thanks. You saw how it's done? A bit of an art in it..."
�You sure got it. Right.�

"Now, wheeliegirl, we're going to tie you down quite tight over your body, so you don't fall down... this may be a little sore" he murmured to her, like re-assuring an animal about to be slaughtered. AAAGGHHH! The rope around her crotch split her vagina as he pulled it tight.... very tight. She squealed.
"Good, that's right... try not to cry out until it's very tight, all right?" He pulled the rope harder, and then tied it up around her tummy, pulling it in, lashing it to the spoke she rested on, several turns... she groaned as it bit into her. She saw he was sweating with the effort. There was a bulge in his trousers she saw with disgust. Another rope, this time below her breasts. AACKK! It was so hard she could barely breathe! Finally, her shoulders were fastened down, above the shoulder joints, leaving her arms free. She lay there, looking up at the blue sky, her mind a blank as he fussed around the ropes holding her body down.

"Okay men, raise her up, gently does it.... don't let her fall over on her front..." she felt the wheel raised, and the beams put in place behind her. She was in full view of the empty seats. One of the chairs was near her. That would be the Judge, she realised. The ropes around her body bit into her, holding her tight, especially the rope around her crotch. She felt herself wanting to release pee and perhaps the man saw it. He shook his head.

"No, wheeliegirl" he murmured. "Try to hold it in as long as you can. Wait until the show begins, at least, or longer... if the executioner sees you stained, he's only going to be harder on you. You don't know what hard means? Let me tell you, little wheeliegirl, you'll be wanting every piece of mercy he will give you. So keep it in, don't disgrace yourself."

He wiped her face which had become sweaty already. She felt the humiliation of it - she had got to the state where she was unable to do even the most basic things for herself any more.

Behind her, she heard a shrieking. Oh god... it was the trembly girl! She heard a scuffle and looked round to see her being pulled down on the wheel, four sweating men holding her down at each limb as she screamed and writhed and spat and groaned. Her legs were fastened.... then her wrists.... all the time she shrieked. The ropes being put around her body quietened her a little, but as she was raised, Maria saw a small trickle of vomit leave her mouth and flow down her breasts and tummy.

The man in charge wiped his sweaty face and then with the same rag, wiped the vomit off her. She was still crying, begging. He finally stuffed the rag into her mouth, deep, and fastened it with a rope around her head.

"Scream all you want to later, wheeliegirl" he smiled mirthlessly at her. "Don't fret... I'll take that off when it's your turn. You're all going to be screaming anyway, but the audience prefer it one at a time."

The last girl had seen it all, and was determined to behave with dignity. She laid herself on her wheel without being asked, and spread herself out wide, legs very wide. Her pussy hair was sparse, and her vagina gleamed. Maria heard her little "ughs" and "aahs" as her body was fastened, and then her low groan as her wheel was raised and the crotch ropes bit deep into her femininity.

The men tidied up around them, then went to the side where they sat down in the dust. The man in charge went off. The four girls looked at the empty stands, at each other. Maria realised how she must look - just like the other three. The gagged one was still sobbing quietly. God, the ropes hurt! She kept herself held in so as not to pee. She wanted to, badly, but she was determined not to allow it to happen. How long would they wait? There was an eternity of silence. Four naked women - girls, really - prepared for a grisly lingering death. The sun began to peep over the high wall at their faces, warm. It would be very hot later.

A fly buzzed past her face, landed on her cheek. She would have cried too at her helplessness had it not been for the example of the gagged one. The fly crawled around her face around her nose, and finally left. Did it go into her hair? She shuddered. Little crawly feelings over her body... ahhh!!! a sting! At the side of her breast! Horseflies. She should have known. Their sweat evaporating in the heat was attracting them.

More time passed, another sting against her neck, and then finally the gate opened. A motley collection of men... ugh... and some women... and oh ... a child... another! They all wandered in self-consciously and settled in the benches, watching the girls spread out on their wheels. The children were quiet, huddling near their mothers, but watching the victims, curiously. Some of the men and women embraced each other. In public - they had no shame here! Or was it the excitement of what was to come, did that make them loose control? This was a special place, Maria realised. One in which private dreams became a reality.

A young boy took his erect willy out of his trousers and started to play with it. His father shook his head and motioned him to stop. He whispered something to the boy, patting his own crotch. The boy grinned, put his willy back. One little girl was sitting astride her father, who had raised her skirt - Maria saw she had no panties on and her father was stroking her bare pussy at the same time as he was caressing his wife's ample breasts over her white blouse.

A commotion at the gate. Maria saw the Judge walk in, heading the line of worthies who settled on the comfortable chairs at the front. Lastly, the executioner.

Maria's bowels froze. He was dressed in a black bodysuit which showed off his hairy muscular torso. In his hand, he held a long stick... a stick... a black bar of iron, as fat as his wrist. The judge rose, and faced the assembly.

"Today, we've all been privileged to witness the death of four lovely wheeliegirls. They're going to die for our pleasure, as well as, of course, for their own. Here, in this arena, my friends, as you know, normal laws and rules do not apply. We're all going to have a real blast! Keep the children under control please, sometimes they can get a bit weepy, I know. It's going to be a day for them all to remember. We all have our special favourites among the wheeliegirls, and I know I can't wait to see the action start on mine! But be patient. Their turn will come, and they'll be all the more terrified for what they see happen to their fellow victims. I know each one of them has been loved by one or more of you adults, and I can assure you that I have personally selected, loved, and judged my special one I present to you today. Have they done wrong? Perhaps. So have we all. But they have been selected and now they must entertain us. So, a round of applause please, for our gallant executioner." 

He turned to the man in black and led the clapping, sitting down in his chair. He motioned to the benches and a pretty young girl came out, shyly, and raising her skirt to show her bare and hairless pussy, sat down crosswise on his knee. His hands went round her small breasts, still in her cotton frock.

There was a tense silence. Even the Judge's hand stopped moving. Maria suddenly felt the whole scene was frozen. She would stay like this forever, the way she had been till then. Forever in anticipation, never the reality of it.

"Begin" the judge said, in a quiet voice that carried throughout the hushed yard, and kissed the girl on her cheek.

The last girl, the one who had behaved with an attempt of dignity, was approached by three of the men. They took away the supports, and dragged her wheel to a place directly in front of the audience. A small platform above the upper part of her wheel presented her tethered body at an angle to the assembly. Nothing would be missed.

The executioner approached her, watching her face intently, slapping his large metal stick against his thigh.

"Rebecca. Wheeliegirl number one" he addressed her. "You will now be broken."
"OOOOOOHHHHHHHHH!" her composture finally broke and Maria watched as she started to cry, big tears, mouth wide open. She banged her head against the wheel behind her. The executioner watched her a moment, and then picked up a large triangular spar, pushed it behind the girl's knees, resting it on the spokes of the wheel. Her ankles were now tight, and her knees were raised at least a foot in the air. He positioned himself to her side, raised the bar, and brought it down hard over her thigh, half way between her hips and her knee.

There was a dull splat and a thud, and the girl screamed with all her might, her body twisting despite her ropes. He raised it and brought it down again, in the same place. And again. Maria heard a dull crack and the girl's thigh looked pushed down, bent at an impossible angle. The executioner leaned over, and put his hand over where he had hit her. The girl screamed again, even louder, as he worked her thigh up and down. He muttered something to himself, and stood up and hit her in the same place again. Her screaming became hoarse and Maria saw her stiffen. Had she wet herself? He leaned down again and put his hand over her thigh, purple from the blows, and this time there was a lot of give where there should not have been.

He moved down a little, raised his bar, and hit her hard over her shin. This time there was an immediate crack! And another blow. Her knee was a small inverted v over the spar, her leg twitching as she lay and screamed.

Slowly, he went to the other side of her body. She was watching him, watching as the bar came down on her other thigh. Once! Twice! There was a cracking sound as her bone broke. He moved down and broke her shin with one blow. Her agony was excruciating to watch. The executioner wiped the sweat off his face, and dropped the bar. He pulled the triangular beam away, and her once-pretty legs fell between the spokes of her wheel, sagging like shapeless limp sausages.

First one ankle was undone, gently, then the other. The girl had no more use of her legs, and her heels dropped uselessly to the ground underneath them. Maria watched with horror as the executioner pulled her knee under the spoke, and led her broken leg out from the other side. He wrapped it around the top of the wheel again, dropped the rest of her leg, and then wound her shin round pulling her ankle out to the top, where he fastened it against the spoke with the rope. Now her leg was so wrapped round, it came to well before the rim of the wheel. This time, he fastened it hard, and finally, gave her toes a hard blow with the bar.

He repeated the performance with her other leg. Maria saw that there was not a single drop of blood, but that pieces of shattered bone could be seen under the purpled skin, poking out ominously. They would work out as soon as she was raised. He stood back, to allow the audience to see, and took a bow as they applauded. Rebecca was groaning through clenched teeth, head back on the wheel. Maria saw the little girl on the judge's lap was now quite naked, and the judge's fat hands were playing with her little nipples. The girl did not seem to be excited at all. She sat on his lap, allowing him to do what he liked. He whispered something into her ear, and she quickly turned to him, put her naked arms around his neck and gave him a kiss. His finger pushed into her pussy.

Rebecca's arms were easier to break. She looked wildly from side to side as they were broken, flinching as the metal bar descended on her, time after time. When her limbs had been twisted round the spokes, he gave the men a nod, and they came forward, raising the wheel. Rebecca screamed an animal cry as the shards of white bone ripped through her legs and arms, spurting blood. The men pulled the wheel back into place, and propped it upright again. Rebecca was still moaning, Maria saw blood over her limbs... the ripping of her flesh made her limbs into long glistening tentacles, wrapped cruelly round the spokes.

The audience sat and watched as Rebecca twisted in agony for them, her chest rising and lowering, her head tossing from side to side. There was no escape for the girl. Her limbs had been mangled beyond all recognition. Finally, the executioner nodded to one of the men, and he came forward and stuffed a rag roughly into her groaning mouth, fastened it with a rope around her head. There was a silence in which her small cries could still be faintly heard. Her breasts heaved for air.

Maria found she had wet herself as well. Her bowels had burst in terror, and she could smell her shit and feel her piss down her legs. She also suddenly realised first the Judge looking at her, then the rest of the crowd. The little naked girl got off the Judge's lap, and approached Maria spread out on her wheel. Maria looked down on her, and the girl looked back at the Judge, who nodded, and then she darted forwards and slapped Maria on the thigh. The audience applauded, the little girl ran back to the Judge, her little naked bottom wiggling as she ran.

The terror of it! Three men came forward, walking casually, as if this was a normal thing to do today. They went behind her. Maria felt the men undo the supports, and then saw the sky as she was turned on her back to be carried forward to the place of execution. She cried.... she cried for god to send her the raven, please god... and now she was half raised and she could see the audience, looking at her. Her breasts heaved with deep, panic-laden breaths as the executioner strolled lazily towards her, slapping his bar against his leg.

�Maria. Wheeliegirl number two, the Judge's favourite.� That was her, she realised, her mouth dry. This was now going to be her.

She felt him raise her knee and slip the awful triangular beam under one... then the other. She lay open to the audience, as if she was about to take a cock between her wide spread legs in the classic knee bent position. Then another behind her elbows, raising her arms against the edge of the triangle. She looked like a parody of the waiting lover. The audience watched her. They saw her laid out for them. Each one was fucking her, in their minds.

The executioner stood against the sun on her left side. She squinted up and watched him, heart beating fast again. She was still intact, she was still intact....
"NOOOOOOOO!!!" she screamed as the executioner raised the bar and brought it down crashing on her lovely pale thigh, just above the knee. The pain was intense, a dull blow that resounded through her body. Before she realised it, there it was, again!
She felt her bone crack and her leg jerked in agony. She could see everything. Her leg bruised and darkening already from the ruptured blood vessels beneath her pale skin.

He leaned down and held her leg by thumb and forefinger, where he had hit her, shaking it to test the amount of give. She screamed in agony as the bone creaked under his pressing. He straightened and grunted, lifting the bar high again.

The way the next blow landed she finally felt the agony of her bone splintering inside her. She was screaming without cease her lungs filling and emptying with sound that came from low in her chest. 

The executioner went round to her right. Panting, she watched the sun shine over him as he brought the metal rod down hard over her uninjured leg above her knee. God! It was unbelievable as the heavy metal smacked against her and pressed her leg back against the edge of the support. Another blow! And another... she felt a creak in her knee, and then a grinding of bone as her bones broke apart with the next blow.

He now shifted the beam under her legs. It was agony as he slowly pulled it up, past the break in her bones. Her legs were rapidly turning purple and then he hit her again, just below her thigh. The wrenching of it! She knew her bones were strong there and she just screamed and screamed as the heavy bar came down over her leg, sometimes on top, sometimes on the outside. She felt things break, her pelvis creak. Ugh! The unbearable misery of bones grinding against each other!

Her shin broke with one blow, her calf cushioning the impact against the spoke beneath it. She hated them all for what they were doing to her, her mind a red blaze of pain and anger. She closed her eyes and rested her head back as the dull thuds broke over her other shin, cracking it almost instantly. It took a second blow before the bone really splintered. It was impossible, she realised. It was foul. Her lovely legs... she could hardly feel them, just the smash of metal on bone.

The business of wrapping her legs around the spokes brought back all the pain and the anguish. He pulled out the cross-beams, carefully, but not carefully enough for her! She looked on horrified, screaming incoherently as he took her leg against her will and wrapped it round the spoke. When her ankles had finally been tethered, the executioner raised his bar and smashed the upper of her foot... once, twice... her toes flopped, covered in blood and then she felt yet more pain as he tied her foot tight to the beam, her small bones crushed under the rope.

She was panting hard, her body covered in sweat, she had lost the ability to make a sound. Her executioner moved around her, pushing her body here and there with the end of the metal rod. She followed him with her eyes. There he was, outlined against the sun!

The first blow landed over her fingers, dulling them to instant numbness. She could see blood running down her wrists as she looked from one to the other. The whole one and the injured one. Her upper arm, which the Judge had once held tenderly as he had kissed her shoulder, cracked instantly. Her forearm took at least three blows before she saw him untie her wrist and pull her arm up, holding it up high, and waving it, flopping it around to show the audience her smashed bones and her complete inability to move it herself. He let it down almost gently, letting it flop nervelessly below her.

Was she still screaming, she did not know as her other arm was broken. He removed the crossbeam first and this time, he untied her arm while it was still whole and held it in his grasp easily. She could not have fought him anyway. He simply broke it against the side of the wheel's spoke, twisting it round as he did, braiding it round the spoke and smashing it down when bone did not bend until finally, he crushed her wrist with one last brutal blow.

He knew how much pain she could take, they were like lovers together by now. She knew how much pain she could receive from him. He was almost gentle as he lashed her right arm down. God.... surely now... she could die... but... she felt her body insanely trying to keep her alive. Not too bad, she thought.... many people have lost their limbs and still survived... the thought of herself as a basket case frightened her immensely. Would they really let her die?

The girl left the Judge's knee and whispered something to the executioner. He looked at her, then the Judge, who nodded, calling the girl back to him. Oh what! Maria shrieked, not knowing if she could any longer be heard. He came close to her, and touched her breasts with his bloodstained rod.

Oh my god no please no don't please for mercy please... The dull thud hit her breasts hard, knocking the air out of her. She was winded, she could hardly breathe as another dull thud landed splat over her lovely breasts, so invitingly pushed up by the ropes. Blood flew into the air. He must have split them like ripe fruit, she thought, she felt the blood over her chest and tummy. She saw the black rod raised in the sky and was unable to make a sound as it crashed over her ribs. She felt a splintering inside her body, she knew her ribs had cracked, and then the rod hit the sharp top of her hip bone, and she passed out.

Blackness. Mixed with awful pain. Her body was being shaken. She struggled her eyes open as the men raised her wheel. Nothing felt right inside her. She could feel blood in her mouth and spat it out. She groaned weakly. The ropes bit into her, supporting her torso. Her ruined limbs, her breasts, bloodied and torn. She looked down and saw the skin had ruptured over her nipples. What was it she had to remember.... She closed her eyes and tried to breathe. It hurt like deep needles inside her every time she tried to draw air. She didn't even have the breath to whimper.

There was the Judge. He was withdrawing his cock from the little girl's asshole. She was the one doing the crying. He let her fall on the ground at his feet, and she started to crawl back to her mother on the bench. The Judge looked at Maria. She remembered how he had spoken to her, she remembered the pleasure he had given her with... whatever it was... the wine, she remembered, no it was blood in her mouth... she tried to swallow it down. What did she have to do? She felt a panic grip her as her mind refused to function. She had to do something. She smiled at the Judge, so sadly. He'd allowed this to happen to her but he was still important for her. She looked at him again, and pursed her lips in a kiss through the air. Yes, that was it... she smiled again, and licked her tongue over her swollen lips at him, inviting him to take her... to kiss her, make love to her again even in her bottom if that's what he wanted.

There was a shrieking in the air as the next wheeliegirl was being tortured. Maria saw the heavy metal bar rise and fall hard over the pale body stretched out in front of the audience. The Judge was looking at her again. She caught his eye and grimaced in pain. Sorry Judge.... I hurt... her breathing cost her immense amounts, her breasts were throbbing awfully, she could sometimes feel flashes of pain from her limbs. She tried to smile at him, and she caught his smile back. Oh! Precious! She tried it again, mouthing "I love you" to him, kissing at him again. He was stroking his cock, talking to her with his eyes over the distance. A woman came out in front, completely naked, knelt in front of him and started to suck his cock. Maria saw her slender back as she moved her head up and down on his shaft. She looked on in hopeless love at the Judge, smiling and making mouths at him.

Where did the time go? She was fading in and out. Each time she closed her eyes, graceful darkness claimed her. She would open them again to see that she was still alive, horribly hung over the wheel. Her wheel. The wheel the Judge had given her. The pain he had allowed her to experience.

All four wheeliegirls had now been executed and raised. The gagged one had been ungagged, but she wasn't making much noise any more. Their heads all lolled down, as if inspecting their mutilated legs. The Judge... was standing in front of her, holding the naked little girl by the hand. They were both looking up at her, only a foot or so of difference, but Maria was elevated, she felt special in her position. She felt her pussy warm at the sight of the two of them. Her breasts panged with sudden grief.

"Maria?" he was saying gently. "Are you still with us, Maria?"
"Yes, Judge" she breathed, whispering because her throat hurt so much.
"You have no idea how beautiful you look, with your legs and arms mangled and wrapped around the wheel, and the look of love over your face when you see me."
"Ohh, Judge..." she tried to smile again and made a kiss of her lips.
"Yes, Maria. And I've brought you though all this. I selected you out of many beautiful girls to have your loveliness enhanced, your lovely breasts burst open, and your life ebbing away. Are you grateful, Maria?"
"Ohh yesss Judge... oh god, yesss...."
"You want to die for us, don't you?"
"Please Judge..."
"And you will. My lovely wheeliegirl. Wasn't this the most exquisite ending you always wanted?"
"Uhhhhh....." she felt herself blacking out again, but when she opened her eyes again they were still standing in front of her.

"I was telling this little girl how wonderful you must feel. She said she wanted to be a wheeliegirl when she grew up."
The little girl smiled up at Maria, who smiled back at her.
"Tell her, Maria. And tell her about the raven. Remember the raven, Maria?"
"The raven?" Did she feel his dark wings fluttering around her face already? The raven? Ah yesss.... the promise...
"The raven will come little girl" she groaned. "He'll come and take us away, you and I."
"Will you be waiting for me, Maria?" she asked in that slow speech of young children.
Maria looked at the Judge. What she really wanted to say was, fly, child, go and live a life. This is the edge. There must be life elsewhere... find it! The Judge looked at her. He knew what she was thinking.
"The raven, Maria."
"Yes, I will honey. I feel..." she coughed and spat blood out of her mouth "I feel at peace honey. You will too."
"You were screaming" she said.
"Yes honey, that's part of it."

The Judge slapped the girl's bottom playfully. "Go and get fucked by someone, honey. I want to speak to Maria. Oh, say bye bye till you meet again."
"Bye bye Maria. Wait for me okay?"
"I will honey. Remember always do what the Judge tells you. He's a powerful man."
"Aww... right..." she walked away, not so lively now, Maria saw. She wondered how many times the child had been raped that day.

There was just herself and the Judge now. They looked at each other.

"I love it when I bring a slut to this disgusting end" he said in a low voice she could barely hear. "Flaunting your lovely silky bodies, teasing me, always saying yes but meaning no. Now look at you. Your legs are completely trashed, broken to pieces. Your fine tits are ruptured like rotten fruit. I took you into my power and made you into something that looks like a creature with slimy tentacles that nobody in their right mind would ever want to come near. And you smell of shit and piss and everything else. You'll never put those arms around me again, whether you feel real pleasure of just pretend please. Now if I took you off that wheel and laid you on the ground to fuck you, you'd be disgusting. I could wrap your arms and legs around me and fuck you as you screamed in pain. Or put you on your front and I could still wrap your arms and legs around me as I fucked your bum... the way I fucked that stupid little cunt. She'll become a wheeliegirl and now you said all those stupid fairy stories to her, she'll actually want it. How does that make you feel, Maria? With your dying breath you told the usual horrid lies."

If Maria could have wept, she would have. The throbbing in her body was intense.

"You'll stay like this when we put you up to the sky for days. Slowly loosing blood, moisture... the birds will come and peck at you, that usually gets a few screams. I'll hear you screaming every evening. When they pick out your eyeballs, you'll be blind but you'll know... and... when we put you out flat, your cunt will be untied, open again. Ravens like that tender floppy meat in there. You might even cum when they pick at your clit. Goodbye Maria. I hope you rot in hell."

She saw him walk away, slowly, to the others, who, passion spent, were staggering drunkenly out of the yard. She blacked out again, her soul a pit of deep despair.

The movement of her wheel as they lowered her again woke her up. The men unbound her pussy, and she felt herself being raised up... up, to the darkening sky. Her pussy was wide open to whatever chose to feast on it... they would peck at her torn breasts, and come close to her face. She saw the black specks wheeling in the sky as she had imagined them. To her right and left, the other three girls were raised on the platform, groaning from time to time, moving fitfully.

She felt light bird claws on her breast. The bird had a dark, hooded beak, and he suddenly dipped it into the wound at her nipples. Ahhh!!! That stab of pain! Was it the magic raven after all? He pecked into her breasts and she saw a shred of her flesh fly out as he buried his head deeper into her. Yes, raven, she thought.... however long I'm here, now I'm yours. I can't do anything to stop you, and you can tear at my breasts and pussy however much you like... just... bring me an end, take me with you, will you?

She knew she was condemned to lie there for days still, falling in and out of consciousness. Was it the magic raven, spreading death through her? Many birds had landed on the bodies of the wheelygirls and there was a chattering and a crying and fights would break out between them. She felt her pussy torn open between her unresisting thighs. Night. Darkness. Her small vessel of consciousness, loosing it, tossed on a stormy sea...

***

The Judge is lying in his bed with the little girl next to him, the one he loves to torment and play mind-games with. She will grow into her death, he thought. One day, I'll have her come to my court of her own free will to be condemned.
And at the end, she'll know the truth just like that one... what was her name? They grow up so quickly and they die. Maria. Yes, Maria.

"Will I really be a wheeliegirl one day, Judge?" she asks, stroking his chest.
"Yes darling. I promise you, you will."
"And will you do the whole thing, condemn me, talk to me, feed me nice things and then when I'm broken, you'll tell me how lovely I look?"
"Yes darling. You know that until a girl is broken, she's not really very attractive to anyone."
"And when I'm lying on my wheel will you send me your raven?"
He turns her quietly round and presses his cock into her distended bottom. She cries in pain as he enters her. She's been fucked so many times today already.
"The raven, darling? That's just a fairy story. You're going to die slowly, in pain like all of them."

He feels himself close to another orgasm, and pushes deeper. She squeals loudly and starts to masturbate herself as he cums inside her
"Oh! That's just so wonderfully scary, Judge! Will it really happen?"
