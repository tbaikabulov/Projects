Synopsis: 






�Are you nervous?�&nbsp; He asked.&nbsp; His voice sounded calming, reassuring.&nbsp; 
�No.�&nbsp; 
�No?�
�No.�
I could feel Him move, though I couldn&#8217;t see Him.&nbsp; In the same way you feel a red light change to green when you&#8217;re waiting at a light.&nbsp; You don&#8217;t even have to be looking at it to know that it&#8217;s green.&nbsp; It just is.&nbsp; You can just�feel it.&nbsp; 

His voice was behind me now, as I knew it would be.&nbsp; �You&#8217;re not nervous.�&nbsp; It was a statement.&nbsp; �Are you cold?�

�No.�

�You&#8217;re trembling.�&nbsp; He noted, sliding His index finger down my spine from the nape of my neck slowly down, barely touching my skin, lower and lower, excruciatingly slow, all the way to the crack of my ass.&nbsp; My breath caught in my throat and goose bumps rose up all over my naked body.&nbsp; My nipples hardened and tingled.&nbsp; �Why are you trembling, then?�

�I don&#8217;t know.�&nbsp; I answered honestly.&nbsp; �Mmm Hmmm.�&nbsp; He said softly near my ear, so that I could feel His breath.

�Why did you come here?�&nbsp; He asked me.&nbsp; 

�I�wanted to see You.�

He chuckled.&nbsp; �Can you see Me?�&nbsp; 

�No.�&nbsp; I can&#8217;t.&nbsp; I involuntarily blinked behind the bandana tied tightly around my head, covering my eyes.&nbsp; I giggled a bit, shifting my hands and wiggling my fingers behind my back.&nbsp; The rope binding my wrists together was tight.&nbsp; Digging into my skin.&nbsp; Numbing my fingers a bit.&nbsp; 

�Ok.&nbsp; Sooo�you obviously didn&#8217;t come here to see Me.�&nbsp; I felt Him move in front of me.&nbsp; He felt like static electricity and heat.&nbsp; �Why did you come here then?� 

I knew why I was here.&nbsp; He knew why I was here.&nbsp; But I didn&#8217;t know what to say or how to say it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I shuffled my bare feet slightly, testing the ropes that bound them to the legs of the stool, beginning to feel excessively vulnerable.&nbsp; The rope is tight.&nbsp; Tight Tight..&nbsp; I shook my head, bit my lip.&nbsp; I stuttered.&nbsp; �I-I-I��&nbsp; then breathed out.&nbsp; The breath came out shaky.&nbsp; �I�don&#8217;t know.�

He slapped me, across my right cheek with His open left hand.&nbsp; I hadn&#8217;t been expecting it.&nbsp; It threw my head to the left, I was unable to reach up and rub my cheek.&nbsp; It stung intensely. It had been so unexpected, it made me angry.&nbsp; I yanked hard at the ropes, two hard yanks, but they didn&#8217;t give.&nbsp; I could tell they wouldn&#8217;t.&nbsp; I forced myself to stop struggling &amp; be still.&nbsp; I ground my teeth together to keep from crying out in either anger or pain.&nbsp; His voice was calm.&nbsp; As if He hadn&#8217;t just slapped me.&nbsp; I concentrated on my breathing.&nbsp; 

Slow. Slow.&nbsp; In, pause, out, pause, in, pause, out.&nbsp; Slower.&nbsp; Just breathe.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t panic.

�You do know.�&nbsp; He said quietly.&nbsp; �Don&#8217;t lie to me.�&nbsp; I involuntarily flinched.&nbsp; �Now.&nbsp; Tell me why you are here.�&nbsp; 

Why?&nbsp; 

So simple.&nbsp; 

Why are you here?&nbsp; 

It was quite simple.&nbsp; 

My mind reeled.&nbsp; Why am I here?&nbsp; 

Say it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

But I didn&#8217;t�couldn&#8217;t�and the seconds ticked by.&nbsp; 

I knew he would hit me again.&nbsp; I wanted to answer.&nbsp; I turned my head blindly right and then left, as if seeking�something.&nbsp; I had to answer.&nbsp; More quickly.&nbsp; 

My mind screamed.&nbsp; Say SOMETHING!&nbsp; Anything!&nbsp; 

�I&#8217;m here because I��&nbsp; my lips moved for a moment, but no sound came out.&nbsp; ��because�I want�I want��

Too late.&nbsp; 

He slapped me again, this time on the other cheek.&nbsp; This time, harder. He said something, but I didn&#8217;t hear it all.&nbsp; what I heard was&nbsp; ��just can&#8217;t figure it out.�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Tears sprang to my eyes beneath my blindfold.&nbsp; �Fuck!�&nbsp; I screamed through my clenched teeth.&nbsp; 

Mother Fucker!&nbsp; 

I was infuriated and desperately tried to break free, struggling in futility against the ropes, which only served to dig them deeper into my flesh.&nbsp; A thin layer of sweat broke out on my skin and I muttered curses as I struggled.&nbsp; 

If these ropes come loose, I&#8217;m going to scratch His goddamn eyes out.&nbsp; 

He said my name calmly, quietly.&nbsp; Again, I didn&#8217;t hear Him.&nbsp; He said it louder.&nbsp; �Stay with Me, here��&nbsp; He condescended, as if I were an&nbsp; idiot who couldn&#8217;t understand, which did result in me turning my face in the general direction his voice came from, struggling less fiercely as I listened to His words..&nbsp; �Are you frightened?�&nbsp; He asked me.&nbsp; I shook my head no.&nbsp; 

Fuck You.&nbsp; NO.&nbsp; And, Fuck You.
&nbsp; 
�You&#8217;re not afraid?�&nbsp; He asked again.&nbsp; 
�NO!�&nbsp; I screamed�.resuming my struggle in earnest.&nbsp; 

He grabbed the stool on which I was tied and flung it rapidly backward, controlling the speed of the fall &amp; the force with which I landed on my back so that I hit the ground just hard enough to knock the breath out of me, then He reached out with one hand &amp; pressed it against my throat, cutting off my air.&nbsp; I struggled to draw a deep breath and although there was a lot of noise as I attempted to breath in, very little oxygen made it through my obstructed windpipe.&nbsp; He used His other hand to yank the blindfold from my eyes.&nbsp; 

Our eyes met, His face only inches from mine.&nbsp; �You should be frightened.&nbsp; You don&#8217;t even know me.�&nbsp; He spoke matter-of-factly &amp; smiled.&nbsp; It was a disarmingly charming smile and went perfectly with the casual conversational tone he was using.&nbsp; �What&#8217;s My name?&nbsp; Tell Me My name.�&nbsp; 

I looked off to the side, seeking a full name, a complete &amp; real name,&nbsp; in the depths of my mind that I knew I wouldn&#8217;t find.&nbsp; His grip loosened slightly and I drew a loud breath, then He tightened His grip again�and in doing so brought my eyes back to His.&nbsp; 

�Oh�and�how many people�actually�know that you&#8217;re here?�&nbsp; He inquired.&nbsp; My mind spun like a slot machine�then landed on a number.&nbsp; 

Zero.&nbsp; 

He winked at me.

Uh-Oh.

I knew He could feel the already racing pulse in my throat increase exponentially under his palm.&nbsp; He let go of my throat seconds before I would&#8217;ve lost consciousness had He not.

�Yeah, you wish.�&nbsp; He whispered.&nbsp; �I want you conscious for this.�&nbsp; His eyes slowly traced the line of my body, still tied to the stool,&nbsp; as I gasped for air, coughing and trying to regain control of my racing thoughts.&nbsp; 

�Now, that I have your undivided attention�I&#8217;ll ask you again.�&nbsp; He said.&nbsp; �Are you frightened?�

Yes.&nbsp; 

But I just nodded my head slowly, my eyes brimming with tears.&nbsp; He nodded back.&nbsp; It was an understanding gesture.&nbsp; 

�Think carefully before you answer My next question.�&nbsp; He paused and placed one hand on either side of my head, pinning my long hair beneath them as it fanned out on the floor around my head.&nbsp; He enunciated each word as if it were a sentence all to itself.&nbsp; �Why.&nbsp; Are.&nbsp; You.&nbsp; Here?�&nbsp; 

I was naked.&nbsp; Supine.&nbsp; Bound.&nbsp; Alone.&nbsp; Terrified.&nbsp; Stripped of every defense at my disposal.&nbsp; There was no reason to lie, to Him or myself.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sugar-coating the obvious would only piss Him off.&nbsp; 

I am.&nbsp; (thought God)

I am here.&nbsp; (thought the mortal)

I am here because�&nbsp; (thought the slut)

I closed my eyes and whispered.

�I am here because I am�your�fuck toy.�

My eyes were closed, but I heard His smile.

�And, as if it matters, what does My little fuck toy want?�

Your cock.&nbsp; *gasp*&nbsp;&nbsp; You want it.&nbsp; Now say it.

�I want Your cock.�&nbsp; I felt a rush of heat between my legs as I spoke the words.

�You don&#8217;t deserve it.�&nbsp; He whispered.

I know.&nbsp; 

He reached behind my back &amp; untied my wrists.&nbsp; My arms ached as blood returned to them.&nbsp; Then He moved down to where my ankles were tied and released them as well.&nbsp; I came free from the stool and landed with a small thump on the carpet beside the stool.&nbsp; 

A few things were certain.&nbsp; I had come here of my own free will.&nbsp; Took off my clothes and let a perfect stranger tie me up.&nbsp; What&#8217;s wrong with me?&nbsp; 

You&#8217;re a sex addict.&nbsp; 
You were thinking with your pussy.&nbsp; 
You&#8217;ve really done it this time.
You don&#8217;t really know him.
No one knows you&#8217;re here.
He could be very dangerous. 

My mind reeled with my predicament, my body finally caught up.&nbsp; 

Flight!&nbsp; 

I rolled onto my stomach pushed myself up onto my hands &amp; knees and attempted to scramble to my feet but due to my still partially numb limbs, I only made it a few awkward feet.&nbsp; My hands never even left the floor before He caught me by the ankle.&nbsp; He may&#8217;ve been anticipating it, or maybe He was just faster than I expected.&nbsp; 

He yanked my ankle hard which sent me sprawling onto the carpet on my tummy.&nbsp;&nbsp; My nipples scraped roughly against the carpet as I landed and I let out an involuntary yelp.&nbsp; I shifted my body and rolled onto my back as He dragged me several feet backwards on the carpet.&nbsp; 

Fight!&nbsp; 

My fists and feet were striking out viciously, which seemed to have little effect other than to make him appear frustrated.&nbsp; At this point He was simply attempting to subdue me, which intensified my efforts.&nbsp; My sharp nails caught him across the neck, drawing blood, causing him to release me for a brief second, giving me another chance to attempt escape.&nbsp; 

I rolled over and squirmed away, I attempted to push myself up again, but his hand in the middle of my back pushed me roughly to the ground again.&nbsp; This time I could tell He was angry and His weight kept me down.&nbsp; He pressed His weight against my lower body as He slid His body up mine.&nbsp; Finally stopping my kicks by pinning my legs beneath him.&nbsp; Then he grabbed one of my wildly flailing arms and pressed it behind my back, pinning it between his chest and my back, while He grabbed the other then He used one hand to pin both of my wrists together tight behind my back.

I shook my shoulders right and left, and attempted to buck my hips upward, shouting at him to &#8216;let go&#8217; and &#8216;get off&#8217; as I struggled.&nbsp;&nbsp; He pulled my arms back sharply.&nbsp; The pain causing me to immediately stop struggling, forcing me to arch my back until my breasts lifted off the carpet.&nbsp; The pain was intense enough to make me stop shouting.&nbsp; The struggle had left me exhausted and out of breath.&nbsp; For what seemed like an eternity, the only sound in the room was our heavy breathing and my occasional whimper when he&#8217;d tug at my wrists.

I turned my head to the left, my hair falling across my face, blowing forward and back with each breath, getting caught in my mouth.&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t see His face from this angle but&nbsp;&nbsp; with the sudden stillness &amp; quiet I could feel every inch of his hard body against mine.&nbsp; Could feel his weight, pressing on my back, He shifted slightly so that he could move my arms and pressed them to the floor above my head. 

He&#8217;s had enough of your shit, already�where exactly did you think you were going to run to anyway? 

My breasts were now pressed painfully flat beneath me and I could no longer draw deep breaths due to his weight.&nbsp; His body slid further up my back and I felt His cock, hot, smooth and hard on my inner thigh, His hands pressed mine flat against the carpet a few inches from where my cheek rested on the carpet.&nbsp; I looked at his hands through my hair.&nbsp; They were big, completely covering mine.&nbsp; He was strong.&nbsp; I tried to move my arms but couldn&#8217;t.&nbsp; His cock probed between my legs, now.&nbsp; He used his legs to push mine apart.&nbsp; I was making all the movements one would make if struggling intensely, which was extremely exhausting and completely ineffective, as I couldn&#8217;t move at all under him.&nbsp; 

�Change your mind?�&nbsp; He asked me.&nbsp; His cock was pressing against the entrance to my pussy.&nbsp; �DON&#8217;T.�&nbsp; I said, attempting to make it sound like a warning.&nbsp; He ignored me.&nbsp; Blood from the gash on his neck was dripping onto my back.&nbsp; �Luckily, I&#8217;m here to help you follow through��&nbsp; He shifted his weight and pushed just the head of his cock inside my pussy, stretching me open. His cock was big, so hard.&nbsp; My pussy was wet.&nbsp; Wet, wet.&nbsp;&nbsp; He made a growling sound.&nbsp; �You&#8217;re body is telling me��&nbsp; he paused and pushed in further, another fraction of an inch&nbsp; ��that you&#8217;re still onboard.�&nbsp; 

Shit. 

�Don&#8217;t��&nbsp; I whispered again as he began pushing just the head of his cock in and out, slowly and rhythmically.&nbsp; I felt the muscles of my tight pussy squeeze the head of his cock, attempting to pull him inside me. 

He pulled his cock out completely, moments passed�then he pushed it back inside, a little deeper.&nbsp; I gasped.&nbsp; My toes digging into the carpet.&nbsp; 

He withdrew very slowly.&nbsp; Out again.&nbsp; I could feel the head, teasing my hole.&nbsp; Right there.&nbsp; But not inside.&nbsp; I groaned.&nbsp; Then slowly and a little deeper still, he pushed himself inside me again.&nbsp; He was breathing in my ear, his lips pressed against my hair.&nbsp; His breath changed pace every time he pushed his cock inside me.

And just one more feeble attempt on my part,&nbsp; �Don&#8217;t��&nbsp; I said out loud.

�stop.&nbsp;&nbsp; My mind completed the sentence without my permission.&nbsp; FUCK!

Don&#8217;t stop. 

Mmmmmm...God.&nbsp; 

Don&#8217;t..don&#8217;t�don&#8217;t stop.

And then.&nbsp; 

There was nothing for it.&nbsp; 

I knew he could feel me attempting to grind my ass against him.&nbsp; To force him inside me completely. His hands stayed on top of mine, but he stopped pushing them down with any amount of force.&nbsp; He lifted some of his weight off of me, allowing me my first deep breath in several minutes.&nbsp; My clit was throbbing.&nbsp; His cock continued to tease me.&nbsp; I was feeling�desperate.&nbsp; 

Fuck me.

He can&#8217;t hear that. 

Fuck me.&nbsp; Hard.

You have to say it.&nbsp; You want it.&nbsp; Beg him.

�Fuck me.� 

Ask nicely.

�Please��

With sugar on top�

Without warning he rammed the entire length of his cock deep inside of me, hurting me, filling me with delicious pain as the head of his cock bumped my cervix.&nbsp; Light flashed behind my eyelids and I couldn&#8217;t breath.&nbsp; My fingers splayed wide beneath his and dug into the carpet.&nbsp; I made a sound like an animal�pain &amp; pleasure overwhelming me.&nbsp; 

�FUCK�YESSSS.�&nbsp; I drove my hips upwards to meet his thrusts.&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t think, couldn&#8217;t think�clearly.

You don&#8217;t have to think. 

�Oh��&nbsp;&nbsp; Fuck.

�My��&nbsp; God, God, God...

�God��&nbsp; Fuck, yeah.

My words escaping with each thrust.&nbsp; He was fucking me hard, so hard.&nbsp; 

You&#8217;re cock feels soooo good�

His hand in my hair, tangled in my hair.&nbsp; Pulling.&nbsp; His hands still covering mine.&nbsp; My pussy throbbing.&nbsp; His thrusts brutal.

Soooo big�

�You dirty fucking slut.�&nbsp; between gritted teeth.

Yes. I&#8217;m a slut� your slut.

�..ahh..god...YESSS!&nbsp; Fuck this slut&#8217;s pussy��

Hard.&nbsp; Like that.&nbsp; Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

�You&#8217;re gonna pay for this blood on my neck, you fuckin&#8217; whore.�

Mmmmm�make this whore pay�

�Yes�anything�anything you want��

I&#8217;m� gonna�come.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t stop�that&#8217;s just�ohhh�fuck�don&#8217;t stop�

�Don&#8217;t you even think about coming, without my permission.�

He gave me several slow hard strokes then one deep push then�just paused�buried deep inside me.&nbsp; My pussy gripping him.&nbsp; My ass grinding against him.&nbsp; Several slow hard strokes�one deep push then�pause.

Please.

�Don&#8217;t do it.&nbsp; Good for nothing slut��

�Please��

Please, please, please�

I couldn&#8217;t help it, couldn&#8217;t stop it.&nbsp; My pussy began to spasm violently, as I came, my entire body following suit.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

�FUCK!�&nbsp; I moaned and pressed my ass hard against him��YES!�GOD!�&nbsp;&nbsp; God is here.&nbsp; My fingers and toes had gone numb.&nbsp; My entire body felt weak, the shaking wouldn&#8217;t stop.&nbsp; My pussy was squeezing his cock hard.&nbsp;&nbsp; It seemed to grow inside me. He groaned as he fucked me hard,&nbsp; slamming my body into the carpet as he pumped my still-throbbing pussy full of his hot cum.&nbsp; I continued to moan and writhe beneath him long after he came, his cock still inside me, his cum oozing from my pussy &amp; dripping onto the carpet. 

Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; 

We both lay there for a long time�breathing hard�covered in sweat�spent.&nbsp; I began to dose off.&nbsp; 

I was jerked awake as he yanked me off of the floor by my hair and dragged me, disoriented, kicking &amp; screaming into the bathroom.&nbsp; I blinked rapidly against the light in there, it was bright, it hurt my eyes.&nbsp; 

He snapped handcuffs onto my wrists and shoved me stumbling into the shower stall, hooking the cuffs to the shower head above my head.&nbsp; Then he turned the shower on and cold water rushed from the head drenching me, bringing a whole new sincerity to my screams.&nbsp; 

�Have a shower��&nbsp; he shouted over me.&nbsp; �We&#8217;ve got some stuff to work out when you&#8217;re done��&nbsp;&nbsp; My screams died down.&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t hear him when I was screaming.&nbsp; �Stuff like�coming without permission�and��&nbsp; he put his hand up to the gash with the dried blood on his neck� �and my�injury��&nbsp; he snapped off the bathroom light and pulled the shower curtain shut.&nbsp; �By the way��&nbsp; he said&nbsp; �the longer you shout the longer this shower will be��&nbsp; I heard the door shut behind him.&nbsp; Cold water streamed relentlessly from the faucet above my head, icy water dripped from the ends of my hair and from my nose.&nbsp; I blew water noisily from my lips and with no desire to prolong the shower, clamped my mouth shut and waited for him to return.&nbsp; I was covered in goosebumps.&nbsp; My nipples were hard as pebbles.&nbsp; I shivered uncontrollably and my teeth began to chatter.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

This is not what I wanted.

Really?&nbsp; Wouldn&#8217;t know it by the way this cold water just can&#8217;t seem to cool that hot pussy�

I began to get the feeling that this was going to be a very long night.

With any luck�
