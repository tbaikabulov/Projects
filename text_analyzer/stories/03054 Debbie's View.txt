Synopsis: This is what happens when a gynocentric group of public figures dismisses and humiliates one of their own. Hell hath no furry.Debbie's View  
We pulled her station wagon into the alleyway between the two buildings. &quot;How
  did you ever find this place? I wanted to know. Deb tossed her head, her blonde
  hair going everywhere. &quot;I know a guy into the rave scene.&quot; That was
  enough. The ravers are always one step ahead of the police. &quot;Well, you
  see one warehouse, you've seen them all.&quot;  
We crunched our way up to the stark building, its unremarkable metal door
  rusting at the hinges.  
&quot;OK, let's go in, and do one final checklist. I'm ready,&quot;  
And she was. Debbie Matenopoulos was wired, confident, strong, and boy oh
  boy! Excited. &quot;Hey, hey hey,&quot; I reminded her. &quot;Careful now,
  we can't get too sure of ourselves, I don't want any mistakes. Not with this,
  this is big.&quot; I let her know. &quot;Oh, Mark,&quot; she chided, &quot;You
  think I haven't stayed awake every night for a month, not paying attention
  to details?&quot; I was sure she had. &quot;Ahem, sweetie, and I'm not calling
  you that as a downer. You've got more going for you than a certain three of
  our little party. Its just ...I don't want to see the delightful Miss M getting
  snuffed herself, courtesy of the state of New York. Just take it steady.&quot; She
  gave me that &quot;its my party&quot; look and a pout of her lips. Oh, well.
  Let's get this snuff show on the road.  
My mouth dropped open in surprise.  
The added curtains were one thing, but the game-show wheel! Impressive. &quot;I
  like it,&quot; &quot;I knew you would, one of the studio grunts got it for
  us. You like the drapes?&quot; &quot;Sure do, but why?&quot; Debbie dropped
  her stringing out of extension cords. She walked over to me and patted my shoulder. &quot;Honey,
  if it were YOUR last night on Earth, wouldn't you want to be looking at curtains,
  instead of these grey walls?&quot; &quot;Maybe,&quot; I sighed. &quot;But I
  don't think that I would, or they will, be entertaining thoughts of the surrounding
  decor, do you? The vanity troupe is going to have other things on their minds.&quot; &quot;Whatever,&quot; Oh,
  that phrase. The ultimate, minimalists dream of a dismissal. How brief. How
  trifling. How aloof. And you know what? It fit the night perfectly. &quot;Yeah,&quot; I
  agreed. &quot;Whatever.&quot;  
 Debbie's station wagon was soon joined by a small van.  
A tall brown-haired dude looking to be in his early thirties came trudging
  over. &quot;Well,&quot; looking our building up and down, &quot;we got them
  all. Bud is about ten minutes behind me. Damn SJ put up a kicking brawl, but
  the chloroform got her in the end.&quot; Debbie made a face. &quot;Jim, what
  about the others? Any trouble?&quot; &quot;Nah. Barbara fell asleep first,
  Lisa was the last,&quot; &quot;Yeah, probably because she's the youngest of
  the bunch.&quot; I came over to the two of them. &quot;Younger, I bet means
  plenty of entertainment, eh Jimmy?&quot; Jimmy turned a little red, then adjusted
  himself, trying to be discrete, and not entirely succeeding. &quot;Ah, yeah,
  I've had unholy thoughts over her, man.&quot; I thought as much. &quot;Ok,
  Ok,&quot; Debbie crowed. &quot;Let's get the equipment in here.&quot; I had
  temporarily forgotten about the equipment. Damn, that would take at least--then
  I heard the other vehicle arrive. &quot;Yeah, here we go, its happening!&quot; Jim
  was just about jumping up and down, and Deb was right with him. &quot;Now that
  Bud's here, it'll be a helluva lot easier.&quot;  
Whereas Jimmy was your typical J Crew-wearing tall mezomorph, his companion
  Bud, well, Bud was quite a different story. Bud was one of those walking refrigerator-shaped
  guys who never asked how heavy an object was. If it needed moving, all Bud
  would ask was, &quot;where ya want it?&quot; Bud was two inches smaller than
  Jim, but I'd say double his weight? Yeah, double. And not an ounce of it was
  soft. So, we brought out and stowed a large oven, some really nifty photographer's
  lights, a chest freezer, and plenty of binding cords and tethers. Before the
  clocks in the town struck midnight, we'd be needing it all.  
We all straightened from our efforts in those various ways--we brushed off,
  smoothed wrinkles in clothing, rubbed hands, shuffled our feet; anything to
  put off the main event. And yet, we knew we couldn't, not for much longer. &quot;Oh,
  God,&quot; Jimmy wailed. &quot;You guys ready?&quot; Bud inquired. &quot;This
  is it,&quot; Deb flatly stated. For her, that was serious. I shook my head. &quot;Let's
  get to it, that stuff won't last. And we all had better be real good with our
  boy scout sheep-shanks and half-hitches.&quot; I felt a lump in my throat--as
  I knew the others did. &quot;One, two, three, let's go,&quot; I turned and
  made for the door. &quot;You did bring the hospital gurnies? I hope?&quot; Debbie
  half-asked half recited. &quot;Yup,&quot; I said. &quot;They fold up, like
  lawn chairs, these models are neat.&quot; &quot;Good, I want to touch them,
  ah, ... as little as I have to.&quot; &quot;Me too,&quot; Jim answered.  
We brought in, one by one comatose woman, after woman.  
&quot;Its incredible,&quot; Jim commented.  
He'd never seen people posed and manipulated, while still asleep. We bound
  them all into chairs, one rope across the chest to keep them supported, then
  each leg and each arm got tied very securely. &quot;Now, let's set up the table,
  and after that ... it begins. Bud was setting up the lights. &quot;How is it
  that this place has gas and electric, no one's using it.&quot; he wondered.
  Jim gave him a sideways glance and said rather guiltily, &quot;Oh, I turned
  on the utilities from out there in the alley. All the buildings around here
  have exposed meters. It was easy.&quot;  
Debbie was positioning the table, a nice imposing one--in full command of
  the still unconcious women. &quot;There we go, looks real homey,&quot; she
  smiled.  
It was an evil smile.  
&quot;Home was never like this.&quot; I scolded.  
Jim was curious. &quot;I wonder what their first words will be when they
  wake up?&quot; &quot;I hope not Where Am I? Maybe something more unhinged.&quot; I
  was thinking the same thing. &quot;It'll be different for each one, I bet.&quot; Bud
  asked, &quot;how we gonna wake them up, anyway?&quot; Debbie was ready for
  the answer to that one. &quot;I gotta nice big bottle of amonia cleaner, right
  here.&quot; she proclaimed loudly, &quot;and I'm gonna use it right now!&quot;  
Before I could guess her action, let alone stop it, she stood upon a chair
  and yelled for all the building to hear; &quot;I christen thee Debbie's View!&quot; CRASH!
  She hurled the bottle against the back wall of the room. Of course, it shattered
  in a million pieces, sending liquid everywhere. &quot;What have you done?&quot; I
  shouted. &quot;We'll never clear that amonia out of here!&quot; Jim yelped. &quot;Oh,
  relax, that was spring water. I said I was gonna use the amonia, I never said
  that that was it.&quot; She reached under the table, and brought out the name-brand
  standby for the kitchen floor. &quot;Now, this--&quot; she waved it ominously
  at the droopy focus of our evening, &quot;this is it.&quot;  
&quot;What, what's going on?&quot; a sleepy Meredith Vieira mumbled. After
  Debbie delivered a snootful to Joy Behar there was heard a &quot;why am, is
  this, I'm sitting up?&quot; Not even a complete sentence, damn! &quot;Oh, my
  what is this?&quot; That was Lisa Ling. &quot;I feel funny, who's there? Well,
  better. That was Barbara. &quot;What the fucks goin' on, who tied me up?&quot; Ah,
  that was Star Jones. And she, like her fellow lecturers to the housewife set,
  was not happy.  
I elbowed Debbie in the ribs to hide from their sight until the surprise
  of their situation hit them all. Reluctantly, she did as I asked. &quot;Hello,
  ladies.&quot; I began; &quot;This is your captain speaking. Or more precisely,
  your judge, jury and umm hmmm, executioner.&quot; Star perked up at that. &quot;who
  the hell are you?&quot; &quot;Very nice, Star, succinct, direct, authoratative.
  I like that.&quot; She glared at me, testing the bonds that held her fast. &quot;I'm
  a lawyer, and---&quot; I cut her off with a finger. She knew the gesture very
  well. &quot;And Meredith, the moderator of our little group. Such a haughty
  little jap,&quot; I flicked a few drops more of the amonia in her general direction. &quot;You're
  anti-semitic!&quot; she crowed. &quot;Oh, please, that tired old thing? Truth
  is anti-semitic. Hardly, I can think of twenty women I'd like to acquaint with
  the sweet kiss of the axe--and only two are of your persuasion. No, dear. Its
  your excuse for a talkshow; that's why you're all here.&quot; I moved on to
  Barbara Walters, who maintained a neutral expression. &quot;Well, Barbara,
  care to interview me?&quot; She was stone silent, wow! I couldn't believe this.
  Just then Joy spoke up. &quot;This isn't funny. All right, this has gone far
  enough! Release us, this minute!&quot; I was diverted from Barbara for a moment. &quot;You're
  absolutely right, this isn't the least bit funny.&quot; I eyed Star, who couldn't
  resist spitting at me. I gave her a venomous look as a reply. &quot;But, you're
  absolutely wrong on your other point. This hasn't gone anywhere near, far enough.&quot;  
Lisa Ling was really dealing with this well--keeping a mask of Asian composure.
  I was gratified, knowing full well that this would be a truly exotic little
  nut to crack.  
And so, I began, as the other two guys kept well back in the shadows. &quot;For
  your crimes of male-bashing, homophobic rantings, incessant preaching and analysis
  of fluff topics, the lowering of TV standards for a show---. America's gag
  reflex will never be the same. Oh, and that stunt of not merely firing one
  of your own, but worse! You turned it into a public humiliation. Anything to
  say now?&quot; I waited for a response. There was a flurry of yipping and swearing
  and snuffling. Then, amid the hen-fest, Barbara spoke up. &quot;We all know
  people in very high places. You will be up for kidnapping, assault, and ...
  and you'll never get away with this.&quot; I expected more of that tripe from
  Star Jones. I wasn't disappointed. The Gynosaurus spoke. ... &quot;I'm a New
  York lawyer, and you'll be held accountable, and anyone with you will be brought
  up on charges.&quot; That was better. I waved to Debbie, still hiding, and
  getting antsy. &quot;This isn't my personal vendetta, oh no! May I present--
  Ladies, This Is Your Life!&quot; Out popped Debbie, teeth bared. &quot;More
  like; This is your funeral, all of you!&quot; Meredith began to sob. Barbara
  began to cry. Star's heavy coat of makeup was falling apart. &quot;You!&quot; yelled
  Barbara. &quot;Yeah, me.&quot; Debbie shot back. &quot;I've been planning this
  since last year.&quot; Lisa Ling's face fell, at last. She knew that Debbie
  held her in real disfavour, being her replacement. &quot;And you,&quot; turning
  to her; &quot;you can't even shine my shoes. I don't care how many awards Cosmo
  gives you, you sucked in that Old Navy commercial. Cargo pants are worse than
  Dockers, so there!&quot; Debbie turned to me, her features vibrating with anticipation. &quot;Let's
  get this little picnic going, huh?&quot; I nodded in agreement. All five captive
  women fell silent--a real first.  
Debbie was at my side now. Jim and Bud were really itching to go. We told
  them they weren't involved, but we'd make sure they got some great pics of
  what was to come. With that, they rocketed away, within two minutes the sounds
  of burning tires could be heard. &quot;OK, let me explain this. Barbara, you'll
  appreciate this one, being a real TV veteran and all. This is the &quot;WHEEL
  OF MISFORTUNE,&quot; and Debbie is more than happy to turn the letters for
  me. Now, here's what she's worked her little heart out to accomplish.&quot; I
  bent and planted a nice one on her left cheek. She smiled. &quot;You're very
  appreciated, and it can only get better.&quot; &quot;Yeah, I've been fantasizing
  almost every night, just what and how its going to happen to each of them.&quot; I
  drew the bound women's attention to the wheel. &quot;Now, there are all sorts
  of letters and numbers on the wheel. Each one matches exactly, the numbers
  and letters on this list. This list is a compilation of all the popular snuff
  techniques taken from the web's snuff community. We have everything here--from
  being nailed to a cross, to drowning, gutting, raping, the death of a thousand
  cuts.&quot; I gazed around at the five celebs, letting my words sink in. I
  was looking for weakness. I tried some little taunts--just to make the dam
  bust wide open. Hey, Joy. &quot;Don't you ever wear dresses? What, were you
  born in J.C. Penney pants suits? Yuck.&quot; She growled obscenities at me.
  It was going well. I turned to Star, who was really doing a slow burn. &quot;Did
  anyone ever tell you girl, you look like Al Sharpton in drag.&quot; She screamed
  cracker curses to the ceiling. Barbara gave her a stern look. &quot;Hey, don't
  start that crap,&quot; I left them to jeer at Meredith Vieira. &quot;Hmm, don't
  you believe in underwear? Ever?&quot; Joy Behar wasn't taking any of Star's
  shit. &quot;You yeast-ridden bitch! Shut up. And you kinda do look like--&quot; &quot;Yeah,
  well at least I don't look like a cheap Bette Midler retread!&quot; Now four
  out of five girls were all bitching and trying to work loose from their ropes. &quot;Oh,
  cat fight,&quot; called Debbie, she was snapping pics. &quot;Yeah, and there's
  so many great ways to skin a kitty.&quot; Lisa Ling wasn't participating in
  the verbal abuse. She was confining herself to crying and shaking violently.  
&quot;OK, Miss Matenopoulos you may decide the fate of prisoner number one.&quot; I
  stepped from in front of the wheel. Debbie could barely contain herself. She
  manhandled the wheel, and sent it whirling. Tick tick tick. &quot;Hmmm, Meredith,
  remind you of sixty minutes?&quot; As the wheel ground slowly to a stop, a
  number crawled into visibility. Number two, Meredith Vieira. Its you!&quot; Debbie
  chortled. Meredith turned white. Now I took up the wheel and gave it a roll,
  to determine Meredith's style of execution. A letter D appeared. &quot;Oh no!&quot; I
  exclaimed. &quot;We have ta roll again.&quot; The letter D is for duelling. &quot;You
  mean, she gets a partner?&quot; I sighed. &quot;Looks like, and we both agreed
  that it was to be pure chance, the decision of the wheel is final.  
&quot;Oh, nuts, that's one less good snuff, if we have to use two together.&quot; Meanwhile
  the women were turning paler with each passing minute. With a nudge, I sent
  the wheel out once more on its journey. Up came a three. &quot;OO, that's Joy
  Behar.&quot; Debbie was elated. It was just as well, I pointed out to all of
  them. Both of you are close in age. Now, we must contrive a compound snuff
  for this. I didn't think we'd need swords. Hmmm. I was thinking. &quot;We have
  to use stuff already here,&quot; Debbie reminded me. I had an idea. &quot;What
  are you doing?&quot; I spun the wheel of misfortune, and a 4 came up--that
  was Star Jones. &quot;Well my little chocolate minx,&quot; I purred in her
  ear. Let's see in what form the grim reaper comes for you.&quot; &quot;You
  piece o'shit. You'll pay for this.&quot; She was losing her temper. I spun
  the wheel, paying attention this time, to its letters. I wrung my hands with
  glee. &quot;Ah, look Deb. An R!&quot; &quot;What's sat, what's sat?&quot; Star
  bellowed. I crept over to the frantic forty-year old. &quot;Hmm, you've just
  turned the big 4-0 this past March, right? Well, you're to be roasted. Aha,
  a nice, plump, Perdue oven-stuffer.&quot; I spied the makeup at that point.
  I gave Deb a look. &quot;We'd better start her first, we'll have to marinate
  and scrub that foundation and crud off her. &quot;I can do that,&quot; Debbie
  announced, &quot;you decide and prep the other two. Then the three of them
  will die together--and Lisa and Barb can watch.&quot; There was a gurgling
  hiccup from Star Jones, she must've been envisioning her fate. &quot;Sounds
  like a plan,&quot; I agreed.  
Lisa Ling was screaming now.  
&quot;No, you're serious?&quot;  
What had she been thinking all this time? &quot;Hey darling, this ain't Channel
  One anymore.&quot; I sternly admonished her. &quot;No, and after I put together
  something for these two--you're gonna be next.&quot;  
That shut her up--or at least I thought it did.  
Lisa decided upon a horrendous scream campaign, to hopefully summon help,
  or at the very least, distract us. Debbie began going at her with major slappage
  to the face. Still she kept howling. Oh, what lungs. &quot;I don't know if
  this will help, but--&quot; I grabbed a large utility knife, and Lisa froze
  when she saw the blade glinting. &quot;Oh, no!&quot; &quot;Oh, shut up, it
  isn't for you, just your clothes.&quot; I had the idea that if I relieved Lisa
  of all her clothes, she'd be so mortified and indignant that's she'd crumble.
  As I began shredding her blouse, I saw it. She had a belly ring. &quot;So,
  you like piercing, eh?&quot; Debbie was almost drooling now, eyeing me.  
&quot;You're not gonna--!&quot;  
Yes I was, I thought.  
I reached for the ring, and ripped.  
Oh no! This reactivated an entire new repertoir of ululations, very high
  bird-like keening was now coming from Lisa Ling's throat.  
&quot;Oh, shit, Debbie, please start on Star there.  
Once you've cut her panty shields off, cram them down Lisa's throat till
  I can get to her. Thank you.&quot;  
I went to the adjoining rooms of the abandoned warehouse, and tried to make
  sense of what was there. I had to create something, mutually degrading and
  fatal. There was a huge bale of razor wire. Nice start! Boat-rope metal shelf
  braces, bolsters for footons or some kind of foam furniture. Yipes, I saw two
  huge fluorescent tubes--they had to be four feet long. An old tricycle, where
  the hell did that come from? Mortar, plaster, all sorts of goodies. A plan
  was slowly beginning to take shape.  
Debbie kept swinging a cinderblock at Star Jones, but the lucky bitch was
  veering and weaving. Even when the cement block hit home, she still didn't
  go to sleep. With having had just about enough of that, she remembered the
  chloroform. Grabbing a piece of Lisa's cut-up blouse, she held her breath,
  and uncorked it. She soaked the cloth, closed the bottle, and ran over to the
  tied woman. &quot;Nighty night you brown cow,&quot; she exhaled. and slapped
  the soaked cloth over Star's face. Ferocious to the last, she tried to bite
  her through it. Then she drooped. &quot;Well, finally.&quot;  
Barbara Walters was horror-struck.  
She looked on, as Debbie untied Jones, and let her fall heavily and noisily
  to the floor. &quot;Now, where to begin.&quot; Debbie hoisted the load of dead
  weight onto one of the gurnies they'd wheeled their charges in on. She trundled
  down the hall to a room they'd set up as a kitchen. She just KNEW it would
  come in handy. Deb cut off every ounce of clothing from the snoring Star. Then
  she began scrubbing all the makeup off. Now, the fun part. Not having much
  skill with one, Debbie picked up a razor--and began shaving the larger woman.
  She didn't worry too much about the hair on Star's head--actually, she needen't
  have, for it was just one of many of Star's tackie wigs. . Concentrating on
  the lower body, she did the pits and pussy. &quot;Oh boy, somebody's gonna
  get lucky tonight with a thick muscular cunt steak.&quot; she stated softly.
  She wondered how one would taste.  
&quot;Hey, Mark! I could use a little help here.&quot;  
I finished my apparatus and scurried off to see what was happening. I poked
  my head into the make-shift kitchen, and was greeted by two women. One was
  standing, smiling at her work. The other was her work. &quot;whew, all nice
  and oven-ready, great job.&quot; &quot;Thanks. I need help trussing her up.
  If she got out now, she'd be a big fat piece of evidence against us.&quot; I
  didn't need to mull over that one. &quot;Well then, let us prepare to roast
  an atourrney.&quot;  
We'd raided two stores on the way over--that was why we chose the station
  wagon. I brought out my trusty Gin-Su, and began slicing into the still form
  of Star Jones. I was really new at this, but I did manage to identify her liver,
  intestines, and a bunch of other junk I knew she would no longer need. &quot;Oh,
  don't ask me to sew that mess shut,&quot; Debbie quailed. &quot;Nah, why bother.
  We're not presenting her to Julia Child or anything.&quot; I located an office
  stapler, and began cachunk, cachunk, cachunking Star's body closed. &quot;Its
  crude, but hey, it works,&quot; I winked at her. At this point, the massive
  internal assault I had just staged began cutting through her chloro-haze. Pain
  was shooting through her, and she was rising back to a waking state. &quot;Great,
  let's gag and tie her good.&quot; I commanded. We had to hurry. We crossed
  her legs, duct taped and bound her ankles. Like a roasting game bird, we pinned
  the doomed woman's arms behind her back. That should do it.  
So, together, one on each side, we wheeled the prepped gyno-meat out into
  full view of the four waiting soon-to-be snuffees. We were greeted with howls
  and shrieks. Meredith started throwing up. Joy began chewing at her ropes.
  Very nice entertainment. &quot;Well, everyone, what do you think. Within, I'd
  say, two hours, you're going to smell something unique. Pork roast, that isn't
  quite pork roast. We're a-cooking up a New York lawyer barbecue.  
Debbie began gagging the four.  
&quot;They're giving me a headache, and I wanna enjoy every minute of this,&quot; She
  began stuffing ripped clothing into their mouths. &quot;Just make sure you
  don't shove too much, too far down. We want them still breathing.&quot; &quot;I
  know, I've read up on this real good,&quot; She raised her eyebrows &quot;do
  you know how many groups, clubs and websites are devoted to this?&quot; &quot;A
  whole lot, I can't even begin to guess.&quot; With that accomplished, Debbie
  followed me into the other room. &quot;What have you--? Oh, my God, it looks
  like a huge swingset, its so big!&quot; &quot;It has to be. It must support
  two struggling women. Speaking of which, let's go get them now.  
We dragged both Joy Behar and Meredith Vieira, chairs and all, down the hall
  and into their final residence.  
&quot;Oo, oo, so go ahead, do the announcer thing,&quot; Deb was rubbing
  her pussy now, growing wet with hot anticipation. &quot;Woa girl, I knew you
  wanted revenge, but oh, I never dreamed--!&quot; &quot;Shut up, just explain
  it, and turn it on, or whatever, I ... I need this!&quot; &quot;Your wish is
  my command. I don't want to be responsible for a desperately dripping debbie.
  hahaha!&quot; She punched out at me for that one, I stuck out my tongue at
  her--then addressed the contraption; along with its hapless victims.  
&quot;OK, what this looks like is a huge swingset. That's more true than
  you know.&quot; I had an idea. &quot;Be right back.&quot; After much scraping
  and grunting, Debbie saw me return with Lisa Ling and Barbara Walters, chairbound.
  I had dragged them down the hall. &quot;You don't wanna have them miss this,
  do you?&quot; Oh, Star's oven is preheated now. Shall we?&quot; &quot;Let's!&quot;  
So, we left four women, and a ghastly machination, alone in that room while
  we both attended to Star's culinary debut into the world. &quot;Oven door open.&quot; I
  began cramming the writhing form into the oven's open maw. Oh, the heat was
  excruciating. &quot;Nothing compared to the heat she's about to feel.&quot; I
  took one look back, &quot;um, we could still stop this. They'd all be traumatized,
  but--&quot; &quot;Damn it, they fucked me over! Publicly, remember? No dice!
  That's final.&quot; Shoving me aside, Debbie Matenopoulos kicked the open door,
  slamming it closed with a resounding metallic CACHUNK! Then she hotly marched
  out of the room, ready for more carnage. I smiled. So was I.  
&quot;OK, now, where were we?&quot;  
She poked my ass with her fist.  
I wasn't about to argue with that Greek temper.  
&quot;Hey, OK, here it is.  
A lot of this mess is hanging from beams and the ceiling fan, I didn't exactly
  have an industrial welder to use. On the left here, are two steel cables. Each
  one is quite capable of supporting the weight of our ex-View celebs here.  
Now, first off, we hang both of them up to dry, Marquis-style by these cables.&quot; Debbie
  looked around at all the other components to the asortment. &quot;What's this
  giant hollow thing? Looks like a tunnel, made like a huge slinky.&quot; &quot;You
  got it, that stuff's the sharpest razor wire you've ever seen. I mean, they
  must have wanted to keep everything and everyone imaginable out of here. So,
  once the women are hung up, we fit them with all of this nice foam rubber stuff,
  used for furniture. Then the surprise begins. Its all in the design. &quot;And
  these swinging metal things? Ick! Looks like a nightmare demon's toy mobile.&quot; &quot;Oh,
  its a nightmare, for sure. But no toy you'd want around. You'll see it work,
  very soon.&quot;  
So, after a small snoot of chloroform, both Meredith Vieira and Joy Behar
  were securely cuccooned in nice, cuddley apulstery innards. This was for a
  reason. Then, together, we hoisted them up, and into, one mad set of cable
  and lethal wire. At once, both women began to gently swing and spin. &quot;Oh,
  it works! Its beautiful!&quot; cried Debbie.  
&quot;OK, now that that's done, let's finish doling out our last two snuff
  sentences.&quot; I sniffed, what, already? &quot;I do believe I smell the beginning,
  er, I mean, the end of one Nubian loudmouth.&quot;  
&quot;Yeah, me to.&quot;  
We filed back to the room occupied by the wheel of misfortune. I spun, and
  got Barbara. Debbie spun, and got, who else? Lisa. Now came the letters. Neither
  one of us knew what the branded victims would receive. That was half the fun.
  Twice, the wheel spun. Twice, the wheel marked the final destiny of a woman,
  very familiar to the television public. The public had no way of knowing, however,
  the hideous, fate doled out to both of them. Such knowledge could freeze the
  soul.  
As Star, surrounded by both heat and steel, quietly sizzled, Joy and Meredith
  slowly crept back, for one brief, final time, into the world of the living.
  This felt funny, Joy was disoriented. She was drifting, floating? Hanging?
  Something was really odd--Meredith was laying or sprawled, or something; uphill?
  This wasn't a hammock, what w--ow!&quot; she bolted into awareness. Something
  stung her. As her body was startled it sent an answering shriek of pain into
  Joy's body. Now both women were awake--and oh yes! Their gags had been removed.
  But why? Why would they--? Meredith reached out, or tried to, and felt hot,
  fire! Then she smelled it! &quot;Help, fire, I'm .. we're on fire! A female
  voice, oo that bitch Debbie--. No, you're not, only that foam rubber you're
  wearing.&quot; She laughed.  
It was true, it was burning!  
That awful smell!  
Why was, oh, her hair was gonna burn too!  
She shrieked to Joy. &quot;We're on fire, its this stuff all over us!&quot; Joy
  was feeling achey, all rotten from being knocked out, now this, what was ...?
  Then she felt the flames. It was burning now, shriveling on their skin--melting
  and dripping hot torture from hell itself! Oh, God, stop this, we're--oof!
  A big molten chunk of burning furniture-stuffing settled onto her open mouth
  as she tried to scream. She tried to blow it out, she couldn't breathe right.
  They had confined her in ... something. She didn't have time to guess what.
  She groaned, spat! She hurled the noxious liquifying ember away with her tongue,
  and yes! actually succeeded! It was gone; but then the shock of realization
  hit her like a sledgehammer! She began to cry. Sobs wracked her entire body--for
  her tongue had been seared beyond repair! Her tastebuds, her media voice--all
  gone. Gone forever! As the remainder of the stuffing burned on, she just didn't
  care. Let it happen, let her body shut down. It was over. Joy's gut-renching
  cries of prayer went unanswered, for it was not over yet. Not nearly so.  
Meredith was having similar problems, the devil's very heat was scarring
  her for life--she was sure of it. She wasn't too far off. Smoking mad hot polymer
  was burning allright, and its course was taking it down, down into whatever
  was holding her fast. It kept burning, and as it did so, it began searing her
  naked breasts underneath! Now, Meredith Vieira began to scream. She let loose
  real throat-rippers that could have shattered the most expensive crystal. Of
  course, there was no crystal. There was no help--no rescue from this, this
  ...Oh God! Now what have they done?&quot; Meredith began feeling something
  else! What more was there? Soon, the shrieking pain of her second-degree burned
  breasts was interrupted by a sharp, biting something! Inhaling deeply, she
  nearly gagged on the fumes still lingering. However, small mercy--the stuffing
  had all burned away. Small mercy? Very small; for that nice, comfy insulation,
  enshrouding both women, had been put there for a reason.  
For now, on top of relentless, demonic burning, there came a digging, knifing
  invasion! What was it? Craning her neck, Meredith glanced over to see Joy crying
  and screaming as well. They were both ensnared, entangled in some kind of metal--!
  Then she knew! She met Joy's eyes, she couldn't use her hands to show her.
  Joy followed the look, and was struck dumbfounded! She had a lump in her throat,
  that threatened to expand into her very heart and lungs. That insulation was
  the only thing protecting them from the Satanic, ripping razor-wire. It was
  coiled around them both--in series. If they moved, tried to touch one another,
  or shook, it would cut them apart. Joy and Meredith both frantically looked
  about. They both soon wished they hadn't. For, there were Debbie and myself,
  smiling, waiting, watching the hitherto unnoticed blood, just beginning to
  puddle upon the filthy floor under them.  
&quot;Hello,&quot; I called to Joy.  
&quot;Congratulations! You've survived the burning.&quot;  
Debbie turned to Meredith.  
Would you like some water? Just come and get it.&quot;  
Both women roared, forgetting themselves and their predicament for the moment.
  It didn't last--as they fought to furiously get at us, tiny violations erupted
  on both their skins from a hundred places. &quot;Mark, could you please pass
  the salt?&quot; She kissed me. &quot;You read my mind.&quot; Debbie was as
  hard and as brutal as I. It was so incredibly stimulating. As her manecured
  hand flung the first volley of salt at Joy, she began humming the theme to
  The View. Then her voice was drowned out by the horrific shrieks. Meredith,
  fearing the worst, yet unable to imagine just what could possibly be worse
  than her present situation, didn't have long to ponder the question. Like scatheing
  lightning, more intense than the burning napam of the liquifying foam rubber--this
  ... whatever-it-was! sent bone-crushing pain messages from a hundred parts
  of her body! Her brain lit up like the Fourth of July, threatening to overload
  from the incoming pain signals! It was, it ... was, salt! &quot;You bastards!&quot; They
  were salting her and Joy, every time the razor wire punctured and ripped them
  up, salt was there. Each time the sticky ooze of her bleeding tried to carry
  it away, salt was there! Too much salt! The now-thousand myriad bleeding cuts
  couldn't even begin to dilute the mind-scorching assault! The blood soon realized,
  as did the two doomed women, that SALT DISSOLVES! And so, suspended some five
  feet above the floor, a floor fast pooling with their own blood, two women
  descended into the innermost regions of Hell. The razor wire cut, and cut;
  deeper. Gravity was pulling the women down, the women's own mass was sending
  this monsterous metal invasion; this abrading, tearing intrusion inward--and
  downward.  
As Debbie and I watched, sipping Pepsi together, the women descended, lower,
  lower, and lower; a true monument to the torturous combination of hanging and
  cutting. Joy and Meredith payed a terrible price for slowly, finally, having
  their feet touch the ground, for there is no God in Snuffland.  
The slack which each woman had achieved was given to them when all that razor-wire
  pierced them through and through. For a time, their vital organs were spared;
  but the odds of the cosmos can not be beaten indefinitely. The spectacular
  result of this now lay on the bloody floor, in front of the wild eyes of Barbara
  Walters and Lisa Ling. They knew, with deadly earnest, that they would soon
  be next. For there, within three feet of them, lay two quivering, roughly humanoid-looking
  red, seeping lumps. For all intents and purposes, the two fine women; friends,
  co-workers, were dead. Mentally, both their brains had received too much pain--too
  many messages. It was as if a burning heart of a blazing sun, a sun which only
  they could see, a sun meant to power their own shared private Hell, had seared
  through their nervous systems, much like the salt and wire had done to their
  exteriors. As a slow end, their minds unraveled into white noise. Their bodies
  drained into lifelessness as well. Within two minutes, or perhaps an eternity,
  even the quivering stopped.  
Oblivious to this twin horror outside, Star was having a panic attack--and
  a few other real problems as well. She awoke to intense heat, and her body
  sizzling all around her. Her first thought was &quot;I'm in a car trunk, or
  a coffin. Those white pickle-dicks have buried me alive. She felt around, and
  upon severely burning her fingers realized where she was. She began kicking
  wildly. She tried to get her knees up, for one great gorilla kick when ...
  what the f..! Her right knee went through her tummy. No, not through, into.
  Where was all of her---her insides. She found the somewhat, relatively speaking,
  cooler regions for her burned hands, she clasped her stomach and chest. Then
  she found a new horror to pile upon the already mounting terror, threatening
  to claw her mind apart. Her midsection felt ... different! She knew her own
  figure, of course she did! And this? this was wrong, somehow! They'd shoved
  her into an oven or furnace. OK, that was a given. Now, be logical, what would
  they have done to ...? What would feel like this? She probed around, and felt
  staples. At that moment, hissing steam and wetness whistled out from within
  her hollowed gut. Staples flew, pinging and bouncing off of the oven walls.
  Her sliced skin, with no constraint, flopped open like a badly-made stuffed
  tortilla! As the oven grew hotter around her, her very flesh beginning to seriously
  cook, Star knew what they had done. They'd gutted her like a fish! In reaction
  to this revelation, she howled. She kicked. She was gonna punish that oven,
  rip it apart. Star was taking in monumental gulps of air--very hot air. This
  meant that now, along with her body, the moist tissue of her lungs began to
  saute, as well. She knew then, as her screams were robbed of their amunition,
  that this was it. The bastards had won. They probably were ruining her four
  friends at this very moment. She gave in to the relentless onslaught of the
  inferno. As she began to close in around herself, the searing pain actually
  began to diminish! She thought, this must be almost like freezing to death--they
  always say you feel warmer toward the end.  
She laughed.  
Her heart was in the right place.  
She loved working with her friends.  
She wished them a speedy end.  
She wished.  
She smiled.  
Stunned beyond comprehension, the two remaining live women of The View waited
  like zombies--like the condemned souls of the damned, they sat, petrified,
  unmoving. I motioned to Debbie, to prepare for the dispatching of the final
  two. She slowly nodded, looking toward the pile of items remaining. She wondered
  what I could come up with from all that. &quot;We have a little conflict here,&quot; I
  said. The letters that came up on the wheel stood for rape and cannibalism.
  Now, here's the rub. I myself, want nothing to do with chopping, cooking or
  eating that 71-year-old grandma there. OK, so, if rape is for Lisa Ling, then
  the edibilia is for Barbara, right? I don't want a tough stewing hen--forget
  it. &quot;Well, you can't rape Barbara just to make food out of Lisa.&quot; By
  this time, I was confused. &quot;Great, we can't do this. The one we wanna
  eat leaves us with one we do not want to rape. And if the one we want as food
  is given the fatal rape card, then we are denied decent girl-meat. Oh shit!
  Now what?&quot; I thought of going right in there, and spinning the wheel two
  more times. &quot;already did that, while you were disposing of the two carcasses.
  Up came drowning and another for cannibalism. The gods are angry.&quot; I wasn't
  ready to give up. Then the unexpected intervened. &quot;Debbie, get over here,
  I can help you.&quot; Wonder of wonders. Debbie frowned, what did this bitch
  hope to gain?&quot; Barbara Wawa was trying to cop a deal. Who wouldn't? Now,
  I was curious. We wheeled Barbara's chair, with her still tied in it, down
  the hall, away from Lisa Ling. &quot;What's the big idea? What could you possibly--?&quot; Barbara
  was full of strength now--completely composed. &quot;Now wait just a minute.
  Its bad enough you want to off my young colleague in there, but not me. I don't
  care what happens, its not going to be me. I khnow things, and can get things.&quot; &quot;What
  can you possibly offer as a bargaining chip, Barbara?&quot; I asked her.  
&quot;Oh, please, I know the media inside and out. I know who runs the country,
  the banks. I can also get you somebody the world wants to see snuffed--has
  for a long time. More than me, really.&quot; Debbie and I exchanged looks,
  we weren't sure. &quot;We're um, kinda in trouble if we let you go, you know?
  We just shredded Vieira, sliced and diced Behar, and cooked Jones to a crisp.
  We can't let you go now. It would have to be something so big--!&quot; She
  was right. I began to turn my back and walk out when I heard... &quot;Stop! &quot;For
  openers, I don't even know where this place is. Next, I'll prove myself, I'll
  do in that youngster in there for you! Listen, finally , I'll give over to
  you the decade's best snuff prize ever. Think about it!&quot; I stopped, dead
  in my tracks. Why was this happening? It would have been so easy. Debbie was
  having second thoughts as well--along with third and fourth. &quot;A, you mean
  you'll do Lisa in, for us?&quot; This was the ultimate--if Barbara did that,
  she'd be as guilty as we were. Debbie put it to me. &quot;Do we trust her?
  I wanna know who's the snuff of the decade? Who does the world hate so much
  that...?&quot; &quot;One thing. I won't let her suffer, I'll snuff Lisa, then
  give you my mystery victim. And I go free, that's all I want. We will never
  cross paths again. And I'm sorry about the View firing you, Debbie.&quot; Wow!
  We were both struck with surprise. We slowly agreed. I located my good old
  Gin-su and freed Barbara. &quot;Now, who is the unlucky guy, if it is a guy?&quot; &quot;Good
  guess. I'll give you, delivered to a place of your own choosing---Geraldo Rivera!
  Or as we insiders know him &quot;Jerry Rivers&quot;. With that, she walked
  into the next room.  
We watched from just outside the door.  
&quot;I've bargained and won. We're getting dressed and out of here.&quot;  
&quot;What did you promise them?&quot;  
&quot;I'm gonna give them Geraldo!, isn't that a kick?&quot;  
&quot;But they're monsters, they killed three of us, you can't--&quot; Lisa
  Ling was talking fast now, hastily talking through her shock and dread. Barbara
  was faster. She punched the young girl's temples out with the very same cinderblock
  Debbie had tried to subdue Star with, earlier. This time, it worked. Never
  knowing what hit her, Lisa went down--and never rose again.  
We stood there, stunned.  
&quot;You did it!&quot; we both said in unison.  
&quot;Hey, you may not like me much, but I always keep my word. Except maybe
  to Susanne Sawyer and maybe to Larry King, that dried up old turd. Now, let's
  get some stovetop action going.&quot;  
Still in a state of utter speechlessness, we both moved numbly, from room
  to room. We gathered up the various items Barbara requested. Within ten minutes,
  a huge institutional-size grill was firing up. &quot;OK, kids,&quot; yeah,
  I guess at 71, she had the right to call us that. Let's consider the fences
  mended, huh?&quot; She made the first slice, drawing the sharp blade silently
  down the girl's abdomen. &quot;We call it even. I walk out of here, you get
  Geraldo, and we all three of us, are about to make Bennihana here.&quot; She
  smiled, quite authentic really. &quot;How appropriate, that's good, Bennihana.&quot; &quot;Yeah,
  it fits,&quot; She began over a large sink-sized tub. &quot;All the bad stuff,
  we just throw out.&quot; She looked over her shoulder at us while she worked
  over the still-warm body. &quot;I just wanted to spare her the rape--she didn't
  deserve that. This is quicker.&quot; Wow, she had Lisa gutted in six minutes
  flat. We could smell the olive oil heating. Debbie chopped garlic and ginger.
  Barbara sliced, paper-thin Lisa medallions. &quot;Pity we can't do tempura,
  she's so fresh, she'd be a natural!&quot;  
&quot;Barbara, pardon me, but, I can't help but think; I mean wonder,&quot; I
  studdered over my words. &quot;Uh huh, that, like, maybe I've done this before?
  Now, whatever gave you that idea?&quot; With that, Barbara flipped her former
  colleague over, and began assessing the plump little butt. &quot;Ah, tenderloin,
  sirloin, steak, chops, and if you two are really good, and give me a ride back
  to New York city, I'll braise you a pussy steak, better than anything you can
  saute here tonight. Its really delicious with white wine and a touch of cilantro.
  Believe me, I know!&quot;  
Now remember,&quot; Barbara called, as she exited the station wagon; call
  meon my cell number,&quot; We were both groaning, we were so stuffed--girl
  meat is so rich. I kissed Debbie's nose, and she chomped on my ear. &quot;Will
  do,&quot; I yelled, over the car engine. Barbara Walters winked, as a small
  group of people came into view. &quot;Don't forget now! I've got this fantastic
  ' steak, I'll keep it frozen for a special occasion! And if &quot;Jerry&quot; makes
  an appearance, as I'm sure he will, that should be special enough! With his
  latest work about to end, the poor thing's desperate. Let's the three of us,
  help him out!&quot; She waved bye bye, and was gone. I smiled, then grinned,
  then roared. Debbie looked at me strangely. &quot;What?&quot; &quot;Oh, nothing,
  really.&quot; She tore at my hair. &quot;Hey, alright! I was just thinking
  of something Barbara said back there, before we left--a little thing. That
  is what clenched it--I knew then we could trust her,&quot; Now Deb was really
  curious.  
&quot;And what was the little thing that made such a big difference?&quot; I
  composed myself, feeling the heat rise to my ears. At last, I told her. &quot;When
  you were hunting up that Igloo container we gave her, for you-know-who's cunt
  steak, she pointed to that pile of stuff I had rummaged through to build the
  ... a, the wire thing. There against the wall were two four-foot long fluorescent
  light tubes, remember? Well, she pointed right at them, and snorted; &quot;Rivera,
  you're about to be royally fucked. I'm finally gonna be rid of you!&quot; Deb
  laughed. I joined her. &quot;Barbara wasn't a tender chicken, but she was cool.&quot; I
  patted my full tummy. &quot;Yeah,&quot; Deb replied with a sigh, &quot;Those
  tough old birds are kinda special, I guess. God love 'em.  
We drove on, both wondering just where the adventure would take us next.
