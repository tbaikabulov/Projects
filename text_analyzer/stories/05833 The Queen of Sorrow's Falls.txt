The Queen of Sorrow's Falls
By Razor 7826

Chapter One: The Trusted

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From an article in the Serenity Falls Bee:

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Local businessman Timothy Von Houten and his wife, Mary Baines Von Houten, passed away early yesterday morning after being involved in a single-car accident.&nbsp; Businesses owned and operated by Mr. Von Houten include Houten Insurance and Houten Automotive.&nbsp; The two are solely survived by their daughter, Michelle.&nbsp; No service is planned at this time.&nbsp; Instead, the family requests that donations be made to United Way in the name of the Von Houten family.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle read the obituary and sighed.&nbsp; She never got along with her parents, despite being a successful student and cheerleader, but she never wanted to see them die.&nbsp; She was just three weeks out of High School, single, extremely wealthy, and anxious to move on with her life.&nbsp; According to her father&#8217;s accountants, the millions of dollars now invested in various companies and mutual funds would ensure her well being until the day she died.&nbsp; Michelle always had plans to backpack across Europe once High School was over, with or without her parent&#8217;s support.&nbsp; Despite their objections, it now apparent they would be supporting her after all.&nbsp; Michelle meagerly smiled at the irony, only slightly ashamed she was entertained by horrible thoughts.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now that the funeral was over and all of the financial issues were taken care of, Michelle would spend her last few weeks in the United States at her auntie and uncle&#8217;s place. Auntie Jane and Uncle Eric lived next door to Michelle&#8217;s mother since they were children. Growing up, Auntie Jane and Uncle Eric were part of the family.&nbsp; She had even been talked into giving them power of attorney to manage her affairs and dividends while she was out of the country.&nbsp; If she could trust anyone, it was Auntie Jane and Uncle Eric.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The only other person of significance was her High School sweet-heart, Eric, but Michelle had dumped his creepy ass three months ago.&nbsp; After two years of pressure, she finally caved in and slept with him.&nbsp; It was unimaginably fun to have him inside of her, but after a few months of regular sex, Eric started pressuring her to let him handcuff her, tie her up, restrain her, and just let him take total control over Michelle's body.&nbsp; That was enough; Michelle would never subject herself to his disgusting sexual fetishes.&nbsp; She unceremoniously dumped him and had gotten on with her life.&nbsp; Now, she only looked forward to Europe, and the infinite potential that it held for her life.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle parked her car outside her auntie and uncle&#8217;s house and began unloading her luggage.&nbsp; While she technically owned her parent&#8217;s house still, she agreed that it wouldn&#8217;t be a good idea to be left all alone while dealing with the loss of her family.&nbsp; Eric walked out towards the car while his wheel-chair bound wife watched him. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m glad you decided to stay with us, Michelle.&nbsp; Your parents would be proud about how strong you&#8217;ve been over the last few days.�&nbsp; As usual, Eric was his stern and cheerful self.&nbsp; He had held up pretty well three years ago after his wife&#8217;s accident.&nbsp; The couple was about thirty-five years old and had no children, and as far back as Michelle could remember, they were a happy and model family.&nbsp; The accident had come as a huge blow to both families.&nbsp; Now, Aunt Jane was stuck in a wheel-chair, paralyzed from the waist down.&nbsp; She was still a remarkably attractive woman, though, with nice breasts, fair skin, and long black hair.&nbsp; It would have been a bit of waste if she had stayed a nun, Michelle thought to herself.&nbsp; Jane and Eric had met while training to be a nun and a priest, but their passion for each other superseded their oath of celibacy.&nbsp; Rather than live a lie, they quit their training to marry each other.&nbsp; That sort of romantic love story made Michelle smile, since it gave a glimmer of hope that she would someday have her own storybook romance.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Within a few hours, Michelle was set up in the guest bedroom of the Tolsin&#8217;s ranch-style house.&nbsp; To Michelle, the house felt like a second home, a result of spending so much time there whenever her parents needed a baby sitter.&nbsp; She always enjoyed herself when she was in the Tolsin home, and she had no reason to expect her final stay there to be any different, unaware of the lurking corruption that would twist her soul into a hollowed image of its former self.

During her first week there, she noticed a few suspicious glances from Uncle Eric.&nbsp; None lasted particularly long, and none were overtly strange, but Michelle nonetheless felt a bit uncomfortable with the glances.

During the second week, Aunt Jane began to act strange as well.&nbsp; Everything she did around Michelle was done with small hesitation, and more than once she was about to say something but decided not to.&nbsp; Michelle would have brought up her concerns, but she was a too timid to confront the friends that had helped her during such a difficult time.

------------------------------------

The day of Michelle&#8217;s departure came.&nbsp; The itinerary was simple- get a ride to the bus station, take a Greyhound to the city, and fly to London from there.&nbsp; The paperwork for Uncle Eric&#8217;s power of attorney had come through, so Eric would cash all of her dividend checks into an account Michelle could access anywhere.&nbsp; The three of them were eating a final breakfast together before Michelle left the United States for very, very, long time.

�So what time was your bus, again?� asked Uncle Eric.

�Not for another three hours.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t worry, no rush,� responded Michelle.&nbsp; �Can you grab me some more orange juice, Uncle Eric?�

�Sure thing, Michelle,� responded Uncle Eric, but what he brought to Michelle was far more than orange juice.&nbsp; Before she finished her plateful of pancakes, Michelle was starting to feel a little bit dizzy.

�Aunt Jane� I&#8217;m not feeling too good.�

�Oh, why don&#8217;t you lie down, honey?� suggested Aunt Jane.&nbsp; But, as Michelle stood up from the table, her legs gave way. The world tilted slightly, then faster, and as it finally came to a halt on its side, the world around Michelle went black..&nbsp; Her two trusted family friends then went to work, ending the worldly life of freedom that Michelle had planned on living.

She dreamt of a life free of obligations, but awoke to a life free of obligations in the worst way possible.

She was laying on the bed in the guest bedroom, the nice comforter pulled up to her neck.&nbsp; Since earlier that morning, Jane and Eric had put large wooden boards over the window, making the room almost completely dark.

When she tried to get up, she found her wrists to be encircled with leather wrist cuffs and tethered to the bedposts by several feet of chain.

�What the hell?� screamed Michelle, revealing to her captors that she was awake.&nbsp; 

Outside her door, Jane and Eric hesitated.&nbsp; �Are we absolutely certain we want to be doing this?�&nbsp; asked the man.

Jane looked her husband in the eye.&nbsp; �You know full well that it is too late to turn back.&nbsp; Everything we know and care about is at stake.&nbsp; Our home, our health, and our marriage.&nbsp; The only price that needs to be paid is the freedom of one selfish young woman.&nbsp; I know you care about her as much as I do, Eric, but now that we&#8217;ve gone this far and we are intent on carrying it through, we might as well have some fun with her.�

Eric didn&#8217;t take all that much convincing in that regard.&nbsp; He hadn&#8217;t had sex since the night before his wife&#8217;s accident, and more than once he had discussed separating from his wife over their inability to have sex.&nbsp; Even if divorce went directly against the church&#8217;s orders, sex was still one of the main reasons he left the clergy. Jane had given great head from her wheel-chair, but man cannot survive on blowjobs alone.&nbsp; Knowing that the marriage was on the verge of collapse, Jane had agreed to let him use a third party.&nbsp; They were struggling to think of a solution to their problems when their life long friends died in a car accident, leaving their one and only daughter alone and defenseless.&nbsp; The fact that Michelle could be their outlet didn&#8217;t even dawn on them until Jane had innocently invited her to spend some time at their house.&nbsp; While Michelle was passed out, Eric drove to the bus station and gave Michelle&#8217;s ticket to a homeless woman.&nbsp; As far as the official record was concerned, Michelle had boarded the bus and left Serenity Falls.

Both had serious objections to the twisted scheme, but their worsening financial situation, the accumulating medical bills, and Eric&#8217;s growing sexual unrest all pushed the couple over the edge, fulfilling their long-time BDSM fascination. The couple knew what they were going to do to their friend&#8217;s daughter, but both accepted the sin as the necessary price to continuing to live life as they wanted.&nbsp; Together, they walked through the door to confront their captive.

Inside the bedroom, Michelle Von Houten thrashed in her bindings, the comforter shirked to the side, revealing her naked body.&nbsp; The door cracked open, spraying light onto her bound body.&nbsp; Michelle recognized the silhouettes of Jane and Eric in the doorway.&nbsp; �Aunt Jane, Uncle Eric� what is going on?&nbsp; Help me out of these things!�

Jane rolled up to the side of the bed and looked Michelle in the eye as she began to explain the necessity of the actions.&nbsp; �We&#8217;re sorry for what we have to do, but this truly is the best option.&nbsp; In order for us to continue living our lives as they are today, we need both your body and your money.&nbsp; Michelle... I can no longer fulfill my husband's sexual needs, and together we are unable to meet the crushing financial burden of my condition.&nbsp; So, please, don&#8217;t hate us for what we will do to you.�&nbsp; Michelle could see that Jane had some remorse for her actions, but the intentions were still not clear.&nbsp; She got a much better idea of what was happening when Eric began to remove his clothes.&nbsp; Jane then crawled onto the bed and straddled Elizabeth with her limp legs.&nbsp; As Eric mounted his erect cock into Michelle&#8217;s pussy, Jane began fondling and sucking the girl&#8217;s nipples.

�Why are you doing this to me?�&nbsp; Michelle began to cry.&nbsp; How could they do this to her?&nbsp; For almost her entire life, she trusted the Tolsin's in a way that she trusted nobody else, and she had turned to them and only them where her parents passed away.&nbsp; Now this?&nbsp; Raped by family friends?&nbsp; Things were not making sense.

�Oh, we almost forgot,� uttered Jane, as she reached into her pants pocket and pulled out a bottle of pills.&nbsp; She tapped one out of the bottle and shoved it into Michelle&#8217;s mouth with her fingers.&nbsp; �Birth control.&nbsp; So you don&#8217;t get pregnant.�&nbsp; Michelle actually felt a little bit relieved at their foresight, even if it implied that this would be a long-term nightmare

Even when against her will, Jane&#8217;s pleasant sucking and kneading of Michelle&#8217;s tits was pleasurable, despite the fiery pain below her waist.&nbsp; Michelle never really noticed how well built Eric Tolsin, at least until he was stripped down in front of her and forcing his thick penis into her lovebox.&nbsp; While Jane was gentle with the captive woman, Eric was most certainly not, showing no concern for her feelings as he squeezed her legs and pounded her pussy.

Finally, Eric began to grunt as he came inside of Michelle.&nbsp; He then pulled his cock out and jerked the rest of his cum off onto Michelle&#8217;s lower belly.&nbsp; Through her tears, Michelle could recognize that Eric was elated at what he had done, and things began to click in her mind.&nbsp; Michelle knew that, because of Jane&#8217;s condition, the couple had been unable to have sex.&nbsp; This was probably the first time Eric Tolsin had fucked anyone in the last three years.&nbsp; Michelle felt a slight bit of sympathy for him, but that quickly changed to hatred and contempt.

�What the hell is wrong with you two? I&#8217;ve known you my whole life, and now you rape me?�&nbsp; Michelle finally broke down and began crying and sobbing incomprehensibly.&nbsp; The only thing Jane and Eric could make out were �why� why� Why��&nbsp; The Tolsins left Michelle chained to the bed as they went on with the rest of their day. 

While Michelle cried herself to sleep, Jane and Eric went about their life as they had everyday, with just a small part of their conscious devoted to the horrible sin they had committed to guard their lifestyle.&nbsp; Over the weeks and months, that part of their mind grew smaller and smaller, until the woman downstairs was no longer little Michelle Von Houten.&nbsp; Now, she was just a dark little secret, the cornerstone of their life.&nbsp; The dividends from her stocks turned out to be much more than expected- enough such that Eric could quit his job and still manage Jane&#8217;s medical bills.

As the couple&#8217;s finances stabilized, they began to accept the horrors unleashed upon Michelle as just part of life.&nbsp; Rarely a day went by that Michelle was not used and abused, be it Eric&#8217;s drunken rapes, Jane&#8217;s forced breast feeding, or sadistic games the two played in tandem.&nbsp; Michelle&#8217;s existence knew no joy, no freedom, no fresh air, nor sunlight, confined to a small sound-and-light-proof room.

One night, long after Michelle stopped counting how long she had been imprisoned, Jane wheeled into the room.&nbsp; In the dim light, Michelle noticed that the woman was decorated in an excess with which she had never seen her wear before. Jane Tolsin was adorned with golden earrings, a pearl necklace, and a sleek red dress.&nbsp; Michelle stared at her mistress with the usual fear and loathing.

�You&#8217;ve been here a year now, and� I want to say that I still feel bad about the things that we&#8217;ve done to you.&nbsp; But, please, forgive us.� Jane looked over Michelle with sympathy.&nbsp; �I� there� there wasn&#8217;t any other way for us.&nbsp; I know that to be true.�

For a brief moment, Michelle&#8217;s veil of fear dimmed, and a formerly unseen level of coldness emanated from her as she spoke to her captor, her eyes piercing Jane&#8217;s with a mental clarity that had been absent the past year of her lfie.

�I grew up admiring you and your husband, Jane.&nbsp; You were there for me the whenever my parents worth, and sometimes, I wished you were my mother.&nbsp; But now, you and husband have shown what monsters you truly are.�&nbsp; Jane stared back at Michelle as the words hit their mark.

�If you truly believe that you had no choice in this, I pity you.&nbsp; Both you and Eric defined your lives by choice- your decision to leave the church, to abandon everything you thought you knew about life- after all that, how could you possibly feel that doing this to me was the only way?

�No, the truth is that both of you a lazy.&nbsp; Using me as your own personal cum-filled piggy bank was the easy way out, and everything that you tell yourself about needing the money for medical bills is a lie.&nbsp; Look at you!&nbsp; The Jane Tolsin that helped raise me was a modest woman, always living well below her means.&nbsp; Gold jewelry? Pearls? A fancy dress?&nbsp; You aren&#8217;t just using my money just to get by; you are living the life of lavish that your husband could never supply you with.�&nbsp; Jane sat in her wheel chair in silence as every single word dug up suppressed truths.&nbsp; 

�The truth is, Jane, that you are a waste of a human being. You and your husband have committed unthinkable sins fueled by nothing but greed and lust.&nbsp; Worst of all, you are a helpless cripple.&nbsp; Why don&#8217;t you just kill yourself, you filthy, useless cunt?�&nbsp; 

Jane broke eye contact with Michelle.&nbsp; The captive girl could see tears starting to well up in Jane&#8217;s eyes, and she could her sobs as the wheel-chair bound woman rolled out the Michelle's room.

I&#8217;m glad I hurt her so badly.&nbsp; It� felt pretty fucking good.&nbsp; Michelle laid in the darkness with a smirk; the small act of revenge pleased her. No longer would she be submissive to those monsters; they would have to fight for all that they took from her.

The fight soon came.

Eric burst into the room, enraged, nearly tearing the door from its hinges.&nbsp; The large white man pounced on top of Michelle's bound body, his face contorted with fury.&nbsp; He fiercely grabbed Michelle's arms and began screaming in her face.

"You worthless fucking cunt! What makes you think that you can talk to my wife like that?"&nbsp; Eric shook Michelle wildly as he yelled, but she just smiled in return, fully aware that her words could hurt far more than Eric's fists.&nbsp; Her smile held as Eric slapped her face.&nbsp; "Answer me, you ignorant child!"

"I find it rather hilarious that you had to kidnap a girl to replace your cripple of a wife.&nbsp; What, couldn't find anyone to fuck your middle-aged ass?&nbsp; You've really let yourself go, Eric; I don't think Jane would fuck you even if she could."&nbsp; Michelle was on a roll, and thrilled to be inflicting sharp jabs of emotional damage at her captors.

Eric tried to respond with words, but words failed him in his rage.&nbsp; He balled his hand up into a fist and punched her cheek.&nbsp; Pain tore through Michelle's mind, but she continued to laugh.&nbsp; Eric intensified his beating, but the only bondage that held Michelle was the physical.&nbsp; Her mind was free, and would never again be subservient to anyone.

Tired of the incessant laughs, Eric filled Michelle's mouth with a ball gag and left.&nbsp; For the rest of her time as a prisoner of the Tolsin's, she would never speak another word, both of her sadistic captors fearful of her scathing tongue.&nbsp; Her sustenance was forced into her mouth through a tube.&nbsp; Michelle swallowed the food without resistance, wanting to live only so she could get a brutal and deadly revenge against the friends that had wronged her so badly.

Years passed, but Michelle no longer knew how many.&nbsp; Eric and Jane used her body many times each day, without fail, and Michelle never failed to resist, more than once bruising and repelling the rapists with stray knees and elbows.&nbsp; As time went on they bound her more and more, only rarely letting her up for walks.&nbsp; Leather straps criss-crossed every part of her bruised body.&nbsp; Her arms and hands could barely move, but she took every opportunity to flex and test her muscles, hoping and praying that she would someday get an opportunity for escape� and revenge.

The meager diet the Tolsin&#8217;s sustained her on took a toll on her body. Michelle's slowly decreasing weight made the straps looser and looser, until one night, hours after the Tolsin's had finished with her, she was able to slip her hands free from the leather cuffs that had encased her wrists.&nbsp; With her hands free, the rest was easy, and within minutes she was taking her first wobbly steps in years.&nbsp; She ignored the cum that caked her body and solidified her hair and made her way up a small flight of stairs into the kitchen.&nbsp; She reached for the butcher knife, but paused.

For years, all she wanted was violent and painful revenge, even if it involved dying in the process, but with all the options present, Michelle took the route that would let her live.&nbsp; She took another look around the kitchen.&nbsp; What she saw on the key rack was surprising; it was her old, Mickey Mouse key chain, still with all of the original keys.

Did they not sell my house?&nbsp; No... they couldn't, or else it would give away that I was never to return.&nbsp; Michelle grinned.&nbsp; Things were finally falling into place.

She grabbed Jane's thick fur coat from out of the front closet and listened.&nbsp; The Tolsin's were still asleep, snoring loudly.&nbsp; Before leaving the house that had been her own hell for years, she snuffed out the oven's pilot light.&nbsp; She could smell gas filling the kitchen.&nbsp; At that moment, the success of her plan became inevitable.&nbsp; Finally, she set the timer on the coffee pot for five A.M. with no hesitation for the action would kill Auntie Jane and Uncle Eric.

Quietly, Michelle exited the backdoor.&nbsp; It was winter, and the cold ground hurt her bare feet.

Only a mile to my house... I can make it.&nbsp; She did, and, due to the late hour, she did so unseen.&nbsp; As far as the world was concerned, she was still backpacking Europe, her family's substantial wealth still sitting in stocks and bank accounts.

Her mansion was exactly as she left it after her parent's death, only with a thick layer of dust encasing every surface.&nbsp; The blinds were still closed, and the lawn was overgrown, though the secluded estate in the woods ensured that nobody would complain about the disrepair, nor would anyone see Michelle's unexpected return to Serenity Falls.&nbsp; She headed straight for the shower and washed herself of her rapists' filth, the soap, shampoo, and washcloth feeling fantastic against her body.&nbsp; She dried herself off with a fluffy towel, then caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror.

The woman she saw reflected shocked her.&nbsp; Not only was she noticeable older, but face betrayed her hardened spirit.&nbsp; Gone was the innocent girl that wanted to escape to Europe, and in her place stood an unknown monster.&nbsp; She felt was still overjoyed at her newfound freedom, unaware of the permanent damage that had been inflicted upon her sprit, morals, and lust.

She powered on the computer in her parent's den, and saw that is was Dec 18th, four and a half years after the death of her parents.&nbsp; The festivities were about to begin, and she slowly made her way up to the third floor.&nbsp; From the window of the master bedroom, Michelle could see the subdivision in which the Tolsin's lived.&nbsp; At exactly five in the morning on December 15th, the skies of Serenity Falls lit up, and the lives of two lifelong natives were snuffed out in an instant.

----------------------

The community mourned their deaths, unaware of their secret life.&nbsp; The day after their untimely but fully deserved demise, Michelle received an e-mail from an old friend, bringing news of their loss, and justification for Michelle's reappearance in town after all these years.&nbsp; She played the role of mourning family friend perfectly, but she was happy to see that the blazing death forced a closed casket ceremony.&nbsp; However, as the days went on, Michelle became increasingly restless, unaware of what was happening to her body, until finally, the floodgates broke.

Michelle sat up in the master bedroom, watching the late night feed of cable news.&nbsp; None of the stories were particularly interesting, until the young female announcer turned to the stories of a serial rapist on the loose.&nbsp; As the woman shared the story of women bound and raped, Michelle envisioned the same happening to the red-headed reporter. Michelle vigorously fingered herself as the story continued, and Michelle climaxed of her own free will for the first time in years.

For a brief moment, Michelle felt guilt that she could derive pleasure from unspeakable horrors that were once committed to her, but the guilt gave way to satisfaction as the damns of restraint in Michelle's mind shattered into millions of pieces.&nbsp; Her sadistic lust for power, now sparked, would never subside, and men and women all over the world would soon learn the painful wrath of the Bondage Queen of Serenity Falls.

The Queen of Sorrow's Falls
Chapter Two:&nbsp; The First

Barely three weeks after escaping from life as a sex slave, Michelle Von Houten was gaining a rudimentary grasp on the damage she had received over the past four-and-a-half years, tainted by the new experiences and seemingly eternal punishment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A world she never new existed now sprawled in front of her, the internet acting as both learning tool and outlet.&nbsp; However, a simple computer would not keep her satisfied forever, and already her sexual fantasies were spilling out of her private life and into her every thought. As she strolled through the streets of Serenity Falls, night after night, alone in the world, unshakeable fantasies of domination muddling her perceptions.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle watched as a Policewoman ticketed a car for an expired meter, and fantasized about her screaming from inside a dog cage, a leash signaling that she no longer held any power over her own life.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle sized up a man in a business suit yelling into his cell phone over a business deal gone bad, and envisioned him dangling from the ceiling by his wrists, naked, welts covering his back.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle spied on a mother with her grown daughter dining at a streetside caf�, and smirked as thoughts of tear filled incest flood her mind.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Two things that once repulsed Michelle now dominated her thoughts.&nbsp; The years of bondage and bisexualism were the closest thing to hell on Earth she had ever experienced, but those experiences had seared and twisted her mind.&nbsp; The horrors consumed her soul, but instead of fleeing the nightmares, she embraced them.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her former nightmares would soon become the nightmares of her victims.&nbsp; All that was needed was one final spark to flare Michelle's lust beyond her ability or desire to keep it restrained...

---------------------------------------------------------

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Months dragged on, and day by day Michelle secluded herself into her role as a reclusive millionaire.&nbsp; Things had changed in the last five years, both in Michelle and in the world around her.&nbsp; The few friends she had in High School had long since embarked across the country, and Michelle was in no way compelled to see the few acquaintances that remained.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Instead, Michelle sat at her computer, right next to her bed, completely enthralled by the world of BDSM.&nbsp;&nbsp; With no financial limits binding her actions, Michelle recklessly fulfilled her impulses.&nbsp; Her collection of videos and mail-order toys grew by the hour, but masturbation was losing its flair, and Michelle thought she would need more if her desires were to ever be sated.&nbsp; Unfortunately, satiation was not a possibility for Michelle, already condemned to a broken life of chasing a moving target.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The internet did not offer Michelle the opportunities that she wanted.&nbsp; The few partners she discovered through BDSM sites were scared by Michelle's serious wish for permanent slave, and none returned her follow-up offers.&nbsp; Jilted, Michelle retreated back into her life of wealthy isolation as Serenity Fall&#8217;s richest resident.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Speculation around town grew rampant about the return of Von Houten heiress, as the Von Houten name still adorned many local businesses, her parents still remembered by many of the townsfolk.&nbsp; Michelle's sporadic forays off of her estate and into town drew long glares that did not go unnoticed, but she went along with her business and returned home, never making substantial contact with the townsfolk.
 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle wanted it that way.&nbsp; She had already decided she would rather live in her fantasy land of BDSM rather than spend time building emotional connections with friends and lovers.&nbsp; Unfortunately, no woman is an island, and Michelle would soon be dragged out of the isolated life she clung to with the last remnants of her soul.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-------------

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In late April, Michelle received a phone call, her first one in weeks.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Hello, Miss Von Houten?&nbsp; I'm a reporter with Serenity High School Junior Bee, and I'm working on a piece about the wealthiest people in Serenity Falls.&nbsp; Would you be free for an interview?"

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle sat in silence for a moment, wondering if she wanted to put up with a High School girl.&nbsp; Michelle hated High School students.&nbsp; Memories of SHS still pissed off Michelle, but she also feared that too much isolation would just draw more attention.&nbsp; She agreed to the interview.&nbsp; Jodie Klint would be at Michelle's home Saturday morning at eleven for the interview.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Saturday came, and Jodie was punctual.&nbsp; Michelle looked over the 5&#8217;4� girl and thought she might like be likeable, as she lacked most of the usual indicators of High School level insipidness.&nbsp; Everything about her was nice, but not the type of perfection that was often fueled by the insecurities and condescendence that dominated most teenage girls&#8217; thoughts. Her red hair was curly, but naturally so.&nbsp; Her clothing was clean, but obviously hand-me-downs, the tight sweatshirt showing a band that had been popular when Michelle was a student.&nbsp; She wore tight jeans, faded naturally from age.&nbsp;&nbsp; Michelle led Jodie to the front room, where Michelle had made sure was clean absolutely clean of the sex toys that had been used in every corner and crevice of the house.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"So, Miss Klint, what do you want to know about me?"&nbsp; Michelle asked, trying to sound as calm and sane as possible.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"According to my parents, you left the country five years ago after the death of your parents, and only returned for the funeral of Jane and Eric Tolsin, yet you never left afterwards.&nbsp; Why is that?"&nbsp; Michelle closed her eyes and tried to suppress the painful memories of her time as the Tolsin's sex slave.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I saw all that I needed to see.&nbsp; All I want now is to live a peaceful life alone."&nbsp; It was a half truth.&nbsp; She wanted a peaceful life, surrounded by her own slaves to fuck and torture.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"But why Serenity Falls, if you are just going to shut yourself in?"&nbsp; A good question.&nbsp; It made Michelle expect that this girl wasn't nearly as naive as she looked.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I rather like this home.&nbsp; There is a lot to love here, being the place I grew up.�&nbsp; She refrained from mentioning the quickly expanding sub-basement dungeon.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The interview continued with Jodie continuing to make slightly prying questions, Michelle answering each in the most flat and innocuous way imaginable.&nbsp; Two hours later, they parted, Michelle satisfied that she had sated public curiosity into her life.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It came as much of a surprise the following week when a copy of Jodie&#8217;s school newspaper appeared in Michelle&#8217;s mailbox.&nbsp; She looked through it and found, rather than the interview, a rather scathing piece entitled The Decadent Wealth of Serenity Falls.&nbsp; Line after line, Michelle&#8217;s jaw dropped at the callous way in which she was depicted.&nbsp;&nbsp; Jodie had pulled no punches in scoring cheap points against the town&#8217;s wealthiest heiress. Michelle had little idea what would motivate her to be so aggressive, but the more she thought about it, the less it mattered; she would have revenge.&nbsp; Where most women in their mid-twenties would shirk off the passing insults of an overambitious teenage, Michelle was different, for she was still the same teenage cheerleader that disappeared as a sex slave five years ago, but corrupted by the betrayal and torment.&nbsp; Now, she burned only with hatred for the maliciously offensive reporter, much like the hatred that consumed her soul for the last people to betray her.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The hatred turned to glee when Michelle realized that the young Jodie Klint would make a great starter slave.&nbsp; None of Michelle&#8217;s other leads turned to fruition, but for the first time since escaping the Tolsin&#8217;s grasp, Michelle had the target and means to truly own another human life.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle began to prepare the dungeon immediately for its first occupant.&nbsp; She tested the bars, eyebolts, leashes, chains, and locks that decorated the hidden sub-basement, and organized them for the imminent use.&nbsp; After a few days of preparation, Michelle was ready for the capture.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finding an opportunity for the abduction proved easier that Michelle could imagine.&nbsp; While Jodie&#8217;s mother granted her use of their cars for work purposes, they still forced her to walk to school, a journey that took her through the woods, across genuine wilderness and an infrequently used trail.&nbsp; Michelle scouted the girl&#8217;s route for two weeks, observing her through high-power binoculars from a forest preserve parking lot, before she determined the exact means of capturing her first slave.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The plan was simple.&nbsp; Hold the girl at gunpoint, inject her with sedatives, throw her in the backseat of the car, and drive two miles to her mansion.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The execution went as well as any first-time kidnapper could hope.&nbsp; Michelle stepped out from behind the tree and faced the backpacked Jodie Klint and pointed her pistol straight at the girl&#8217;s chest.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Mm� Miss Von Houten?&nbsp; What are you doing?�&nbsp; The girl stood perfectly still, save for the fearful trembles that shook her body.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You shouldn&#8217;t have crossed me, you stupid little girl.&nbsp; What would possibly compel you to write such a nasty piece about me?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I� it was just grandstanding.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t mean anything by it.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Now you say that.&nbsp; Come with me.&nbsp; Run and I shoot.�&nbsp; Michelle stepped to the side of the trail and pointed Jodie along the way.&nbsp; The girl walked along the trail at a slow, methodical pace.&nbsp; Michelle followed.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When they neared the preserve&#8217;s parking lot, Michelle jabbed Jodie in the neck with a needle and squeezed the plunger, injecting her with a sedative cocktail.&nbsp; Within seconds she collapsed to the ground.&nbsp; Michelle threw one of the girl&#8217;s arms across her neck and dragged her victim to the car, opened the door, and threw her in.&nbsp; She dug through the backpack, found the girl&#8217;s pink cellphone, opened it up, and moved the battery into her pocket, disabling any potential GPS in the phone.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle was thankful that she passed no cars or stoplights on her way to or from the preserve; there would be very little evidence for the police to follow, even if they could deduce the place of her abduction, or if she was abducted at all.&nbsp; Michelle knew that teenagers frequently went missing of their own accord, and that stat-obsessed police were more than willing to label such as runaways rather than abductees.&nbsp; Either way, she was confident that she would not be caught.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle parked in the middle of her three-car garage and dragged the still-unconscious victim down into the dungeon and hastily stripped and redressed both herself and the girl.&nbsp; On Jodie, Michelle placed a braless black leather corset, a thick black double arm sleeve, a black dog collar, and two thigh high black boots, which she linked together with a short chain.&nbsp; On herself, she out on a similar red corset, except with some bra support which still left her nipples exposed.&nbsp; Likewise, she wore thigh-high red leather boots, and sleek red gloves that extended to her upper arm.&nbsp; Lastly, she dumped onto the floor a box, filled with just some of the toys she had accumulated over the last five months.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The picture was complete, and Michelle was filled with a sense of satisfaction for a brief moment as she looked over her prey.&nbsp; The sense of satisfaction soon dissipated, however, leaving Michelle with nothing but her insatiable need for domination.&nbsp; She walked over to the captive reporter and pressed her heel against the woman&#8217;s clit.&nbsp; The girl stirred awake.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Wake up, Jodie,� commanded Michelle.&nbsp; �You have to start working off your sins.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The girl sighed and wriggled on the floor.&nbsp; Michelle pressed in harder, and Jodie&#8217;s body contorted on the floor.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The captive looked around frantically, realizing that her arms and legs were bound together.&nbsp; �Wh� what do you want from me?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I said you have to start paying me back for that insipid little article you wrote.&nbsp; Now, get on your knees, my pet.� Michelle reached down and grabbed Jodie&#8217;s hair.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Owww!� yelled Jodie, as she struggled against her captor.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle pulled harder.&nbsp; �You will learn to do as I ask, girl.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Let go of me!� 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�This is your last warning.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Help!&nbsp;&nbsp; Somebody, help me!�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle sighed and let go of the girl&#8217;s hair, allowing her to fall back down to the concrete floor with a thud.&nbsp; �Fine, if you ask for it.�&nbsp; Michelle turned the girl onto her back and sat on her chest, with one knee to each side.&nbsp; She could feel the smooth leather of the slave&#8217;s corset against her shaved pussy. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I told you things would be easier if you just did what I asked,� said Michelle while she picked up toys from the dungeon floor.&nbsp; �You&#8217;ll pay me back for your crime, willing or not.�&nbsp; She attached weighted clamps to the girl&#8217;s nipples, making them sway to her sides.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Ahhhhh!�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Haha, please, scream all you want.&nbsp; There is nobody to hear you.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Please, I&#8217;m sorry for what I did, just let me go and I&#8217;ll write an apology, I swear!�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It is too late for that.�&nbsp; Michelle continued to abuse the girl by grabbing a slim pink dildo and ramming it into the girl&#8217;s cunt, tearing through her hymen and producing blood.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jodie&#8217;s body jerked in pain, but her body stayed in place due to Michelle&#8217;s weight.&nbsp; �No.. not like this, please, stop.�&nbsp; For the first time since her capture, Jodie Klint cried.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle ignored the tears and continued to slide the dildo in and out of her slave&#8217;s body, turned on by the girl&#8217;s wails of misery.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Are you willing to do what I ask?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Ye� yes.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good.�&nbsp; Michelle reached and grabbed a leash from the floor and fastened it to Jodie&#8217;s collar.&nbsp; �Come, girl.�&nbsp; She pulled Jodie up onto her knees and led her across the dungeon to the far wall.&nbsp; There rested a high-backed chair with leather cushions on the seat, back, and armrests.&nbsp; She sat and turned toward her slave, who was making slow progress sliding along on her knees.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Now, my pet, lick me,� commanded Michelle.&nbsp; She tugged on the leash.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jodie did not have a choice.&nbsp; Fearing even worse retribution than was visited on her earlier, she leaned in, on her knees, and lapped at Michelle&#8217;s shaved pussy.&nbsp; She was The Queen&#8217;s first subject, but she would be far from the last.

The Queen of Sorrow&#8217;s Falls
Chapter Three
The Manipulator
By Razor7826 (Copyright 2008)

Michelle von Houten reclined on her red leather couch in a state of bliss as she flipped through channels with her remote control.&nbsp; Between her legs crouched Jodie Klint, dutifully licking at her Mistress&#8217; pussy.&nbsp; The slave stopped for a moment to catch her breath, but Michelle dragged her closer with a tug on the leash.&nbsp; Jodie had no choice but continue her work.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The concept of completely owning another human life was still new to Michelle, but she enjoyed it in a way unlike anything else she had experienced in life.&nbsp; In her still short life, she had only ever taken two roles; that of a reluctantly submissive daughter to overbearing parents, and that of a slave, betrayed by those she trusted most.&nbsp; Now she took a more dominant role, and she loved it.&nbsp; Not only could she use Jodie&#8217;s body for her own perverse pleasures, but she owned more than the girl&#8217;s flesh.&nbsp; She owned her mind, and above that, owned the teenager&#8217;s warmth.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;During those dark years inside the Tolsin home, Michelle knew only cold, her perverts using her holes while ignoring the rest of her flesh except to induce pain.&nbsp; Many days and nights she yearned for the embrace of her boyfriend or of her parents, wishing to regain the comfort of another person close to her.&nbsp; She had now found that source of warmth, to be hers forever. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Temporarily sated by her servicing, Michelle grinned in pride at the efficacy of her training regiment.&nbsp; For weeks, Jodie had been unable and unwilling to perform even the most basic of the sexual tasks that her new life required of her, but focused abuse had eliminated nearly all vestiges of resistance.&nbsp; Now, Michelle could count on Jodie to do what nearly all that was asked of her, but she made a mental note to do her best to eliminate these brief moments of hesitancy.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A blur of motion in Michelle&#8217;s peripheral vision startled her.&nbsp; She jerked backwards and flung her head to the side and stared at the closed curtains.&nbsp; She thought she had seen a shadow on the other side, but she convinced herself that is nothing of significance.&nbsp; She slouched back in the couch and tugged on the leash, resuming her decline into blissful hedonism.

-------------------------

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The truth behind the shadow became apparent the following night.&nbsp; Michelle was working in her basement dungeon, preparing Jodie for a night on a wooden horse in retribution for a spat of disobedience, tears, and complaints.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You know you deserve this, right?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Please, Michelle, I� I want to see my Mom,� she cried, tears streaming down her flush face.&nbsp; Her body twitched uncontrollably as she sat, spread and bound to the wooden horse.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her arms and shoulders pulled together behind her back, locked together into an arm sleeve.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle reared her hand back and slapped Jodie&#8217;s left breast.&nbsp; �I told you to stop crying about your family.&nbsp; All it does is anger me.�&nbsp; Michelle pinched the girl&#8217;s nipple and felt a rush of sadistic glee.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Ahhh!�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Hopefully spending the night like this will teach you a lesson.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A deep voice came from behind Michlle, near the base of the stairs.&nbsp; �There are lessons that you need to learn, too.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle froze for a brief moment in absolute terror before turning around to face the intruder.&nbsp; He walked out of the shadow and into the light of the overhead lamps.&nbsp; He carried a gun, pointed directly at Michelle.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�We have a lot to discuss, Miss Von Houten.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle instinctively closed her nightgown, too modest to show just anyone her naked body.&nbsp; �Who� who are you?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You don&#8217;t recognize me?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Sorry, I&#8217;ve been out of town for a few years.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m Joseph Phillips, the Sherriff of Serenity Falls.&nbsp; It looks like my deputy was correct in her observance; you really do have the Klint girl here.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jodie, realizing she was being spoken of, began pleading between her sobs, �Help me��

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�How much help you get is up to Michelle.&nbsp; Like I said, we have a lot to talk about.&nbsp; Why don&#8217;t we head upstairs and find a nice place to discuss our options?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle felt as if her world was once again falling apart.&nbsp; Her former friends had taken everything from her, and now, after not even a single year of freedom, she was caught.&nbsp; She would be a prisoner once again.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Are you going to come or not?&nbsp; I could just shoot you right here.�&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle mind returned from astray and she walked up the stairs slowly, the sheriff following her closely, his gun aimed at her back.&nbsp; Even at the top step, she could hear Jodie&#8217;s screams for help.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Turn right.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s discuss things in the den.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Knowing that she had no choice, she complied and took two consecutive rights, pulling open the thick oak door and stopping just inside.

�Sit down over there.�

Michelle turned on the lights and made her way towards the coach, where she sat and turned towards the intruder.&nbsp; He followed her, and sat in the high-backed leather chair.

�I won&#8217;t even bother having you explain yourself.&nbsp; Your basement and the girl told me everything.�

Michelle responded quietly, her voice quivering in fear, �Are you going to arrest me?�

�No, none of the options tonight end in your arrest.&nbsp; In fact, you&#8217;ll still get to be a mostly free woman if you do as I ask.�

�What� is it that you want?�

�You see, me and my friends have a little club that partakes in the hobby you perform downstairs.&nbsp; We&#8217;re always on the lookout for new members, especially those that can support us financially.

�You want me to join your club?�

�Yes, basically.&nbsp; However, your entry fee is going to be a bit high.�

Michelle remained quiet.&nbsp; His offer amounted to little more than extortion, but she didn&#8217;t have a choice.&nbsp; �I&#8217;ll do it.�

�Thank you, Michelle, for being so reasonable.&nbsp; I would have hated to had to kill both you and the girl in self-defense,� he said, sarcasm evident in his voice.&nbsp; 

She couldn&#8217;t help but look at Joseph with contempt.&nbsp; He was a few decades older than her, and his attitude towards her made her think that he had extorted many residents during his time as Sheriff.&nbsp; 

�Let me call my friends; we have an additional problem to deal with, thanks to your carelessness.�&nbsp; He reached into his pocket and pulled out a cell phone, a contraption that Michelle was still not used to seeing.

�What did I do?� she asked, her eyes fixated on the bulk of plastic he held to his face.

�You let yourself be seen.�&nbsp; He turned away for a moment and spoke into the phone, �Yes, you know where it is.&nbsp; Bring Suri.&nbsp; No, don&#8217;t make her if she doesn&#8217;t want to.�&nbsp; He turned back towards Michelle.&nbsp; �You know, your father was well-liked in town.�

�So I hear,� she responded.&nbsp; While widely revered around Serenity Falls, Timothy von Houten wasn&#8217;t the most understanding of parents.&nbsp; His death never bothered Michelle much, even less now that it felt like a lifetime ago.&nbsp; She looked up at Joseph, and asked �What exactly do you need of me?�

�Your money, basically, and probably use of that fantastic dungeon you have downstairs.&nbsp; You&#8217;re still new to the business, it seems, but let me tell you that it isn&#8217;t cheap, or easy.�

�What do you mean?�&nbsp; Michelle thought she knew what he was getting at, but she knew that prying him for information would be helpful.

�You can&#8217;t just keep that poor girl in your basement forever.�

�Why not?�

�What happens if she gets sick?&nbsp; Are you going to let her die?&nbsp; If not, how are you going to get medical care?&nbsp; Are you going to keep her until she dies of old age?�

Michelle looked to the floor in silence.

�Perhaps the reason why my deputy found you is because you didn&#8217;t think things through.&nbsp; You let your lust get the better of your judgment.�

�That isn&#8217;t true.&nbsp; I planned things out.&nbsp; How do you explain the dungeon?�

Joseph laughed.&nbsp; �That&#8217;s the fantasy part about owning a slave, not the reality.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why people like us need to organize, so we at least have a network of assistance to get through these tough patches.�

Michelle felt like a little kid, once again being taught by her elders how to do things right.&nbsp; For all her planning and twisted dreams, she failed to account for the inevitable.&nbsp; �How many people do you know like this?�

�Countless, but in terms of our specific group, just a few.&nbsp; Two of them are on their way.&nbsp; We have a bit of work to do tonight.�

�Like what?�

�Well, we need to cover up your little mistake.�

�How do we do that?&nbsp; You said it was your deputy, can&#8217;t you just tell her it was nothing?�

�It isn&#8217;t nearly that simple.&nbsp; That girl you have downstairs, her mother insists that she was abducted, and not a runaway like I had initially decided.&nbsp; Liza, my deputy, actually believes the woman, and she insisted to me that she saw Jodie.

�So� are you going to kill her?�

Joseph laughed loudly, and yelled, �Are you really that dense, girl?&nbsp; We&#8217;ll just make her disappear.&nbsp; Any one of my friends can take her and hide her, or---� the doorbell interrupted his sentence.&nbsp; �Those would be my friends.&nbsp; Come along.&nbsp; I want you to meet them.�

They returned to the foyer, where Joseph unlocked the door and let in his cohorts.&nbsp; First came a well-groomed white man around six feet tall, wearing a tight short sleeved blue shirt.&nbsp; Michelle recognized him as a lawyer that advertised on local television, specializing in family law.

Behind him followed an Indian woman in a tight green sweater.&nbsp; Her eyes darted around nervously as she stood half a step behind the lawyer.

�Keith, Suri, nice to see you again.�

�Same to you, Joe,� replied Keith.&nbsp; �So this is the Von Houten girl?�

Joe nodded his head, �Yup.&nbsp; She&#8217;s agreed to be our new financier.�

Keith grunted.&nbsp; �It would have been a lot nicer if you hadn&#8217;t fucked up the last one.�

�That wasn&#8217;t my fault.�

�Whatever.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s not talk about that now.�

�Agreed.&nbsp; We have work to do.�

The two men discussed the plan while Michelle and Suri stood, listening, both silent in the presence of the men.&nbsp; More than once, Michelle caught Suri looking at her, but when she returned the glance, Suri looked down at the floor.&nbsp; Something about her demeanor made her seem unhappy, as if she did not want to be here with Frank and Joseph.

Michelle didn&#8217;t want to be there, either, scared of what Joseph had in store for her.&nbsp; But, she knew that she would have to follow his orders, at least for now.

After several minutes of discussion, the men agreed on a plan, which Joe repeated to the group. �Suri, you can stay here with Michelle.&nbsp; Frank will come with me, and we&#8217;ll get Liza.&nbsp; We should be back in a little over an hour, assuming Liza is as alone as she ever is.&nbsp; Prep the basement.�

�Yes, sir,� said Suri.

Frank laughed and followed Joe outside.&nbsp; Once they were gone, Suri&#8217;s demeanor changed.&nbsp; �Thank god they&#8217;re gone.�&nbsp; She turned to Michelle and put out her hand.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m Suri.&nbsp; Nice to meet you.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The sudden friendliness startled Michelle, who put out her own hand and shook Suri&#8217;s.&nbsp; �Pleasure to meet you.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Sorry for being so unfriendly a while ago.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not very comfortable around those two.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well, neither am I,� replied Michelle, her involvement in their group still not completely clear.&nbsp; �If you&#8217;re uncomfortable around them, why do you work with them?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Suri looked down at the floor.&nbsp; �Sorry, I don&#8217;t want to talk about it.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle had no idea how to respond, so she resumed the task that Joe set out for her and headed for the basement.&nbsp; Suri followed.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jodie still sat spread on the horse.&nbsp; �Please�� she whispered.&nbsp; It didn&#8217;t even seem as if she noticed the presence of Michelle and Suri.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Suri&#8217;s eyes lit up as she saw the eighteen year old girl.&nbsp; �Oooh, she&#8217;s cute!� she yelled with newfound enthusiasm.&nbsp; She hastily ran towards Jodie in her high heels and began fondling the captive&#8217;s body.&nbsp; �Where did you get her?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The sudden change in demeanor threw Michelle off-guard.&nbsp; �I� I got her on her way to school.&nbsp; She wrote mean things about me in her school newspaper.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That&#8217;s awfully cold of you.&nbsp; How long have you had her?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�A little over a month, I think.&nbsp; She&#8217;s still defying me, so she&#8217;s being punished right now.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Wow, that long and she still isn&#8217;t broken?&nbsp; I had mine mentally destroyed within a week, though she offered herself to me on her own accord. I think there&#8217;s a lot of skill involved in it, really.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle was starting to like the woman.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;---------------------------------------------------------

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The men were over an hour late.&nbsp; It was just after midnight when they stumbled down the basement stairs, Joseph&#8217;s deputy in Keith&#8217;s arms, unconscious.&nbsp; Michelle could tell that the men jumped the gun in defiling her; she wore no clothes except the shredded remains of a light T-shirt and her bra.&nbsp; Blood and cum caked her inner thighs.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Sorry we&#8217;re late,� said Joseph.&nbsp; �We got a little sidetracked.&nbsp; She wouldn&#8217;t stop mouthing of, so we stopped at Keith&#8217;s house to demoralize her.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I can see that,� chimed Suri.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Keith interjected, �Shut up, woman.&nbsp; If you keep giving lip like that, you&#8217;ll end up like your girlfriend.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Suri silenced herself, but glared at Keith with contempt.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�So which cell is going to be hers?� Keith asked

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle answered quickly, �The second one, I guess.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Keith dumped the unconscious deputy in the cell and locked the door.&nbsp; He turned back towards Michelle and asked, �Are you sure the cell will hold?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�How the hell would I know?� she yelled back in response, �I&#8217;ve never tested these things out, you know.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Joseph snuck up behind Michelle and wrapped his arms around her waist.&nbsp; �No need to get angry, Michelle.&nbsp; You have a lot to learn about work with us.�&nbsp; He leaned in and kissed Michelle&#8217;s neck.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She tried to shake herself free, but Joseph held tight.&nbsp; �Let me go,� she said, struggling against his grip.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He squeezed tighter and whispered into her ear.&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t think you quite understand the details of our new arrangement.&nbsp; You are a coworker, but you are most certainly not equal.&nbsp; You may pay us and help us so I don&#8217;t arrest or kill you, but make no mistake, we still own you.&nbsp; Got it?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A chill ran down Michelle&#8217;s spine.&nbsp; She could merely nod her head in compliance.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good girl.&nbsp; Now, I think you need a bit of job training.�&nbsp; He backed away and spoke to his friends, �Keith, Suri, grab some of those toys and lets head upstairs.&nbsp; We need to officially welcome Michelle into our group.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�But sir�� trailed Suri.&nbsp; She reached her right arm out in front of her, trying to get Joseph&#8217;s attention.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Keith turned and slapped her across the face.&nbsp; �Don&#8217;t start with that again, Suri.�&nbsp; He bent down and grabbed a strap-on dildo that was still-glistening with Jodie&#8217;s juices from a few hour ago and handed it to Suri.&nbsp; �Here, you&#8217;ll be needing this.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She grabbed the dildo, shut up, and complied with her masters&#8217; orders.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle led the way upstairs, all the while knowing what was coming.&nbsp; She wanted to reach for a pot and smash Joseph&#8217;s brains in, but she knew that it would be futile; she had to comply with his orders if she wanted to stay free, no matter how much of a lie that freedom was.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her three new friends shed their clothing as they followed, their clothes falling randomly in a trail of fabric from dungeon to bedroom.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Inside the master bedroom that once belonged to Michelle&#8217;s parents, Joseph helped remove her nigthgown,. Before reclining back onto the bed.&nbsp; He pulled Michelle on top of him and firmly grabbed her wrists.&nbsp; �Let&#8217;s get this done quickly, okay.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She tried to get in the mood, but memories of those hellish years as a sex slave raced through her mind.&nbsp; Her breathing quickened.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Keith kneeled behind her on the bed and grabbed her waist.&nbsp; �Are you going to do it or will I have to make you?�&nbsp; She knew what he was talking about.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She lowered herself onto Joseph&#8217;s cock.&nbsp; Moments later, Keith rammed his into her ass, and she yelped in pain.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Keith yelled to Suri, �Get that thing on and shut her up, bitch.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Suri slid the dildo on around her waist and kneeled in front of Michelle, her crotch dangling in Joseph&#8217;s face.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle looked up into Suri&#8217;s eyes and pleaded, �No, Suri, don&#8217;t��

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m sorry,� The Indian woman mouthed. She turned away and slowly slid the dildo into Michelle&#8217;s mouth.&nbsp; Slowly and rhythmically she pulled in and pushed out, while the other two men vigorously pumped at Michelle&#8217;s cunt and asshole.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For the first time since her release from the Tolsin&#8217;s abuse, she cried.&nbsp; Pain tore through her body as the trio abused her body far beyond anything the Tolsin&#8217;s had subjected her to.&nbsp; She cringed as she felt the men&#8217;s warmth spreading inside of her, but she accepted it; there was nothing she could in the moment do but go along with her new captors.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After the pile had dispersed, Joseph and Keith left the manor.&nbsp; On her parent&#8217;s bed, Michelle von Houten curled up on top of the bedsheets and sobbed uncontrollably, fearing that everything was again falling apart.&nbsp; She had regained her freedome for mere months, but it was all slipping away.&nbsp; Once again, she was property, albeit with some vestiges of freedom.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Suri returned ten minutes later, still naked, though clenching something in her closed hand.&nbsp; �Are you okay?� she asked.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Leave me alone,� replied Michelle.&nbsp; �I&#8217;ve had enough of you monsters for today.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I�� slurred Suri.&nbsp; Tears rolled down her cheeks.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m sorry!&nbsp;&nbsp; Please, I didn&#8217;t have a choice.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Just go away.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Let me help you.�&nbsp; Suri grabbed the comforter and threw it over Michelle, then crawled in underneath.&nbsp; �Take this.�&nbsp; She reached around and shoved a pill inside of Michelle&#8217;s mouth.&nbsp; �Birth control.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle swallowed the pill, appreciating Suri&#8217;s caring and foresight.&nbsp; �Thank you.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Suri pulled Michelle closer until her 36C breasts spread against Michelle&#8217;s back.&nbsp; �I didn&#8217;t want to hurt you Michelle.&nbsp; Please, trust me on that.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t have a choice.�&nbsp; She reached around with her left arm and caressed it gently across Michelle&#8217;s abdomen.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle smiled, Suri&#8217;s warmth blending with her own.&nbsp; Together, they slept.

The Queen of Sorrow&#8217;s Fall
Part Four
The Friend

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Michelle awoke, Suri was gone.&nbsp; She took a long hot shower and cleaned herself thoroughly, purging every trace of her new friends&#8217; filth from inside and outside her body.&nbsp; Even after the foul spunk was drained and scrapped from her body, she still felt dirty and defiled.&nbsp; Exhausted, she leaned against the wall of the shower, letting the hot water spray against the back of her head as she reflected on the previous&#8217; nights experiences.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was her own fault, and she knew. She had allowed somebody to discover the truth, and Michelle&#8217;s dream of living a quiet life alone but for her slaves was once again pulled from her grasped.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, while free in appearance, she was owned by the sheriff and his friends.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She turned the shower off, dried herself, and picked up the red bathrobe from the floor.&nbsp; It was almost noon and her stomach was growling; it had been sixteen hours since her last meal.&nbsp; As she descended the central stairs, she could hear the hum of the microwave coming from the kitchen.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Suri was waiting aside the kitchen counter, cooking breakfast and wearing one of Michelle&#8217;s extra bathrobes.&nbsp; She turned to face Michelle and smiled.&nbsp; �Nice to see that you&#8217;re up.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217;ve fed the slaves and put the girl in her cell. Hopefully you don&#8217;t mind.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; �Oh, thank you.&nbsp; I appreciate it.�&nbsp; It took a brief moment for her to remember the second slave acquired the previous night.&nbsp; �How is the deputy doing?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�She didn&#8217;t wake you up at all?&nbsp; Her screaming was the only thing that got me out of bed before noon.&nbsp; I gagged her and replaced her handcuffs with some of the extra bondage cuffs you had lying around.&nbsp; You don&#8217;t want her to damage her wrists.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Ah, of course not.�&nbsp; Michelle had seen the warnings about handcuffs several months ago, and promptly ordered several sets and various lengths of chain.&nbsp; Even if she never intended on wearing the cuffs herself, the well being of her slaves was still important.&nbsp; �Is� she still bleeding?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No, that is only a temporary thing.&nbsp; She was actually just a virgin, but the rape didn&#8217;t help with it at all.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What are we going to do with her?� asked Michelle.&nbsp; She never intended on obtaining more than a single slave, though her dungeon was large enough for many more.&nbsp; The furnished basement in which her family held so many parties proved to be a very effective dungeon, once the carpet and walls were stripped bare.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Who knows.&nbsp; It depends what she&#8217;s good at.&nbsp; If Keith and Joe like her, they&#8217;ll keep her, but I think she&#8217;ll get sold at the next convention.&nbsp; The dumb bastards wasted her virginity, unfortunately, so we won&#8217;t get top dollar.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Convention?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh, right.&nbsp; The Convention is a mostly annual event where people like us bring our slaves to show off and sell.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve never been to one myself; I had to stay at Keith&#8217;s to guard two of the woman that they didn&#8217;t intend on bringing or selling, though both were squandered a few weeks ago.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle&#8217;s attention drifted off while Suri relayed details of the nameless BDSM convention.&nbsp; The thought of thousands of men and woman sold and traded at a market Michelle smile.&nbsp; For a brief moment, she was happy to have been introduced into their group, but she quickly remembered the downside- bankrolling their activities would be easy, though the other responsibilities would be a lot more painful.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She turned back towards Suri, who was removing some bacon from the microwave.&nbsp; �You don&#8217;t seem comfortable around the men, and they treat you like shit.&nbsp; Why do you follow them around?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Suri went silent.&nbsp; Ten seconds later, she responded, �They&#8217;re doing to me like they&#8217;re doing to you.&nbsp; I have something that they want that they want but can&#8217;t get if I&#8217;m dead or disappeared, though with you around, they probably won&#8217;t need me anymore.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What do you have?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Like you, I have money, but more importantly, I had connections.&nbsp; A lot of my friends and relatives are in their business, but I didn&#8217;t know it until Keith and Joseph caught me.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What did they catch you doing?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Keith broke into my house, hoping to find something of use in a civil suit against me, and he found my girlfriend in a cage.&nbsp; He�� she tried to continue, but collapsed to the floor and burst into tears.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Suri?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She turned towards me and yelled, �They took her from me! We were just playing.&nbsp;&nbsp; She was a sub, and I was treating exactly like she wanted to be treated, but they� they sold her.&nbsp;&nbsp; They sold her as property, but I loved her.� 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Why did they let you go free?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sure sighed before continuing. �This isn&#8217;t freedom, but regardless, they let me go because of my money.&nbsp; They can&#8217;t access my dividends and trust funds without raising flags, and like I said, I have connections.&nbsp; A lot of people would be asking questions in the community if I suddenly disappeared.�&nbsp; She stood back up and wiped the tears from her eyes.&nbsp; �Besides, now that they have you, they don&#8217;t need my money anymore.&nbsp; I&#8217;m probably doomed.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle rose from her chair and spoke with a newfound determination in her voice,&nbsp; �Suri, that won&#8217;t happen.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Why not?&nbsp; They have all the power.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Do they?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well��

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You know they&#8217;re afraid of what will happen if they do something to you, but why can&#8217;t you hurt them?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;ve thought about it, but none of my plans would work.&nbsp; I&#8217;d either get killed by the other or caught by the cops, or, even worse, caught by some of their associates.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�We can handle them.&nbsp; They&#8217;re nothing to worry about.&nbsp; However, do a lot of people know that you work with them?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Suri paused to think before responding, �No, not really, except some of my friends, as I mentioned before.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Would they mind if we eliminated Keith and Joe?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Hard to tell.&nbsp; I&#8217;d assume not.&nbsp; I know of at least one that would actually help us if given the chance.&nbsp; He&#8217;s a vet that&#8217;s helped us out with medical care a few times, but Keith and Joe treat him like shit.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�So, why don&#8217;t we do it?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You mean� kill them?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I don&#8217;t know if I could bring myself to do it.�

Michelle thought about when she believed murder was impossible, back when she was in High School, and how quickly it had eroded under the Tolsin&#8217;s care.&nbsp; She looked Suri directly in the eyes and proclaimed, �I killed the last two people that raped me, and I&#8217;ll do it again.&nbsp; All you have to do is help me, and I&#8217;ll do everything else.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I� I don&#8217;t know.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Suri, think about what they did to your girlfriend?&nbsp; Don&#8217;t you want revenge?&nbsp; Don&#8217;t you want to be free again?&nbsp; As long as they live, you&#8217;ll never be free.&nbsp; Neither will I.&nbsp; They have to go, and you know that.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Suri closed her eyes while Michelle waited for an answer.&nbsp; �Okay.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll do it.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good.&nbsp; I have a plan, but we have to do it soon.�









The Queen of Sorrow&#8217;s Falls
Part Five
The Usurper
By Razor7826

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Deputy Eliza dangled from the ceiling, screaming into her ballgag as Suri whipped at her back, punishment for refusing to sit still in her cell.&nbsp; In the corner, Michelle reclined on a couch which she brought down from upstairs, skimming through the newest issue of Time.&nbsp; Her finger stopped on at an article about another ethnic conflict in Africa.&nbsp; She paused briefly before moving on to more interesting articles.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eliza moaned loudly, drawing Michelle&#8217;s attention from the magazine.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Don&#8217;t you think she&#8217;s had enough?� asked Michelle.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Suri lashed one more time then paused.&nbsp; �You have to be brutal from the get go.&nbsp; It will save you a lot of time in the long run, trust me.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle stared at the darkening marks on the deputy&#8217;s back and wondered how long they would take to heal, and more importantly, whether they would leave a scar.&nbsp; Her thoughts jumped from memory to memory as she tried to remember the last time she had received any significant injuries.&nbsp; She thought of the bruises suffered at the hands of the Tolsin&#8217;s, but, while many, the wounds were minor.&nbsp; After a few minutes of thinking, she remembered the time she was badly injured- a broken arm suffered during cheerleading practice while she was still a student at Serenity Falls High School, the same school that Jodie Klint attended.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The whip cracked again, and Michelle&#8217;s attention again fixated on the captive deputy.&nbsp; Her wounds were bleeding.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The doorbell rang, signaling the arrival of Michelle&#8217;s friends.&nbsp; Suri turned to Michelle and grinned.&nbsp; She returned the smile, knowing that the unwelcome friends would soon be purged from her life by the end of the day.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;ll let them in.&nbsp; The syringes are in the box underneath the cushions.�&nbsp; Michelle ascended the stairs and opened the front door.&nbsp; Joseph, but no Keith.&nbsp; He wasn&#8217;t wearing his sheriff&#8217;s uniform.&nbsp; 

Joseph opened the storm door and walked in.&nbsp; �Keith&#8217;s going to be late.&nbsp; One of his clients is faking another spinal injury, and he needs to be there to harass the doctors.�

�Suri is downstairs already.&nbsp; Your deputy still isn&#8217;t cooperating with us.�

�Ah, yes, get ready for a bit of a media interest in the town.&nbsp; She was supposed to be on duty today.&nbsp; When I show up at work tonight to find that she hasn&#8217;t been in, I&#8217;ll file a missing person&#8217;s report with the county.&nbsp; They&#8217;ll probably be looking all over Serenity Falls for here, so make sure there&#8217;s nothing suspicious out and about.�

Michelle spent a brief moment pondering the implications of her still unknown disappearance and smiled.&nbsp; Things would be easier than she anticipated.&nbsp; She asked Joseph, �When is Keith going to get here?�

�Within a half-an-hour, he thinks.&nbsp; He&#8217;s leaving Williams Memorial right now, but there&#8217;s never any traffic this time on a weekend.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t worry, we have a few things to go over before he gets here.�

Michelle&#8217;s stomach dropped; she remembered the last time he wanted to discuss their arrangement with her, and the abuse that ensued.&nbsp; It was just three days ago that deputy Eliza Mishkin, on a tip from Jodie Klint&#8217;s mother, spied the missing girl in Michelle&#8217;s house, starting the spiral of events that ended in Michelle&#8217;s rape.

�Jillian Klint keeps calling the station.&nbsp; It doesn&#8217;t seem like Eliza told her anything before filling me in, but I&#8217;ve made sure to trash her reports.�&nbsp; He reached out and pinched Michelle&#8217;s cheek.&nbsp; �Don&#8217;t want anything getting to you, now do we?�

Michelle smiled back meagerly.

�We need to go over your bank records so I can determine the price of your freedom.&nbsp; Go on upstairs and get everything.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll be downstairs with Eliza,� He descended into the basement.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Though Michelle hoped that the documents would not prove to be necessary, she understood the need to patronize his interest.&nbsp; She grabbed the folder out of her lockbox with her bank statements, locked it shut again, and headed for the basement.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle stepped down the stairs just in time to see Joseph collapse to the floor.&nbsp; Suri stood over his body, a needle held in her hand.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Suri?&nbsp; What did you do?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I� I had to do it.&nbsp; He ungagged Eliza and she told him we were planning something.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You&#8217;re going to kill him, aren&#8217;t you?� asked Eliza, her arms still cuffed above her head.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle snapped back quickly, �What do you care?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Don&#8217;t you dare touch him!� she yelled.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Jesus, what&#8217;s your problem?&nbsp; Didn&#8217;t he rape you?� asked Suri.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Don&#8217;t touch him!�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle commanded �Just gag her.&nbsp; Her opinion doesn&#8217;t&#8212;�the doorbell interrupter her speech.&nbsp; �Shit.&nbsp; Yeah, gag her.&nbsp; Where is the other syringe?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�On the couch.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Right.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll get him as soon as he turns his back.�&nbsp; Michelle pulled out the small wooden box and removed one of the remaining syringes placed it in her pocket, and rushed upstairs while Suri took care of Eliza.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Keith stood at the door, his hands in his suit pockets.&nbsp; �I really need to get a key to this place.�&nbsp; He entered the foyer.&nbsp; �Where&#8217;s Joe?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Downstairs,� answered Michelle, letting Keith lead the way.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He took four steps before Michelle stabbed the syringe into his neck and injecting the cocktail in one continuous motion.&nbsp; Michelle watched him stumble two steps forward and one to the side before collapsing to the floor, then yelled for Suri&#8217;s help.&nbsp; Once his arms were handcuffed behind his back, she ran into the kitchen and dialed for the vet.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;---------------------------------------------

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Three hours later, the two women and the veterinarian stood on the cliffs overlooking the eponymous Serenity Falls.&nbsp; The sound of rushing and crashing water drowned out the screams of the two caged men, each hunched over on their knees inside large portable kennels.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Suri fiddled with the hem of her sweater and watched her two companions slide one of the cages towards the cliff.&nbsp; �Are you sure we can get away with this?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes, Suri, we&#8217;ve been over this,� answered the doctor with a sigh.&nbsp; �This part of the falls is very deep.&nbsp; It will be years before anyone discovers their bodies, and there&#8217;s nothing officially linking them to any of us.&nbsp; They&#8217;ve kept both of us on the down low in case they ever had to take care of us.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I don&#8217;t know,� mumbled Suri.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The vet reached out and rubbed Suri&#8217;s shoulder, drawing a slight smile.&nbsp; �It&#8217;s gonna be alright, Suri.&nbsp; You know they deserve this.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She responded with a giant hug.&nbsp; �You&#8217;re right, Toby.&nbsp; Thank you.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle Von Houten coughed to reclaim her friends&#8217; attention.&nbsp; �We still have work to do.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Keith shook violently in his cage and screamed into his gag.&nbsp; Michelle kneeled in the dirt before the cage and looked into Keith&#8217;s eyes.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�This isn&#8217;t any worse than you&#8217;ve treated countless men and women, boys.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve had this coming for a long time.�&nbsp; Michelle stood and turned to her friends.&nbsp; �Shall we?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The first to fall was Keith.&nbsp; Though neither Michelle nor Toby was particularly strong, together they had the muscle to lift his cage and throw it unceremoniously into churning depths beneath the falls.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Joseph, seeing his friend plummet to a violent death, went berserk, thrashing about in his cage, throwing his weight from side to side, pivoting the kennel onto its edges.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I don&#8217;t think we can safely carry him,� commented Michelle, completely unfazed by the murder she just committed.&nbsp; �We&#8217;ll need to push him off the cliff.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Toby helped her with unquestioning focus on the task.&nbsp; They let go just as the kennel teetered on the edge.&nbsp; With one swift kick, Michelle gave the cage the nudge that sent it toppling end over end down the face of the cliff and into roiling lake beneath the falls.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That dagger dangling over Michelle&#8217;s head was no more.&nbsp; She had stolen the throne of leadership from what would eventually be known as the Sorrow&#8217;s Falls BDSM Club.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For the first time in many years, Michelle von Houten was truly happy.&nbsp; With a sadistic grin, she gave her first command as Queen.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Jodie keeps crying for her mother.&nbsp; I think we should grant her wish.�

The Megalomaniac

A white van sped through the lonely country road as endless fields of grain and corn swept by.&nbsp; The destination, though new to both driver and passengers, would someday play a monumental role in each of their lives.

&nbsp; Michelle von Houten clenched the steering wheel with unnecessary strength.&nbsp; �This ride is infuriatingly boring,� she said through her gritted teeth.&nbsp; �I&#8217;ve never hated the Midwest so damn much.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Suri stared out the passenger window out across the endless fields of greens and yellows.&nbsp; Without turning away, she muttered, �Long drives are boring no matter where you live.&nbsp; Trust me.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�If you say so.&nbsp; How much further is it again?

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Still not even halfway there.&nbsp; I told you it wasn&#8217;t close.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle sighed while continuing to stare down the deserted highway.&nbsp; They continued in silence before twenty minutes before she asked, �Do you really think we should pick up someone along the way?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�We don&#8217;t have to, but it&#8217;s a quick and easy way to make some money.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Seems like it would be difficult,� quipped Michelle, �to decide what to take just passing them on the street.�

�Haha,� laughed Suri.&nbsp; �This must be the worst weekend in the world to be a hitchhiker.&nbsp; Sometimes, it feels like every single one of them in the country manages to go missing, considering how crowded the convention is.�

�Isn&#8217;t it a bit conspicuous?�

�You&#8217;d think that, but hitchhikers go missing every single day, and state and local authorities tend not to be very collaborative with their efforts and knowledge.�

�Hmm�� murmured Michelle as her thoughts returned to herself and the road ahead.

--------

Just after midnight, Suri asleep by her side and her slave caged in the back, Michelle spotted a small car pulled along the side of the road.&nbsp; The van&#8217;s headlights illuminated a sole woman, waving her hands madly in the air to signal her distress.

A woman in need, completely unaware of the drastic turn her life could take at Michelle&#8217;s whim like Suri had foreseen.&nbsp; Her life lingered in Michelle&#8217;s hand, just as many others had been before.&nbsp; She slowed the van, made brief eye contact with the woman, and sped up again, sparing the girl from whatever horrors her owners could dream.

In the side mirror, the unknown girl raised her middle finger at the speeding van.&nbsp; Michelle smiled at the irony.&nbsp; 

--------------

They turned onto the private gravel drive of the motel just after sunrise.&nbsp; Inset several hundred feet from the road, the nameless motel hid out of sight from random passersby, allowing its owners and patrons to flaunt a lifestyle unknown to the outside world..&nbsp; The front parking lot was full and spilled onto the surrounding terrain.

�Damn, this is more crowded than Joe and Keith made it seem,� said Suri, startling Michelle.

�Do you have any idea what we&#8217;re supposed to do?

�Just head to the office, I&#8217;ll talk to them.�&nbsp; She hopped out of the car as it came to a stop and entered the front office, returning three minutes later.&nbsp; �Pull around back.&nbsp; Room 181.�

�So what do we do know?�

�Well, the auction doesn&#8217;t start until midnight, but we need to get her registered and check out the other goods a few hours before hand.&nbsp; We can rest until then.�

---------------------------------

The sun had set before they reemerged from their room, Eliza behind them, leashed gagged, her body covered with a short bathrobe.&nbsp; Lingering outside the other rooms were men and women, dommes and subs, all openly flaunting their illicit lifestyles and hobbies.&nbsp; They passed their competitors and entered the lobby.&nbsp; A door led to a straight stairway, which widened and descended many steps into a basement room inconceivably large from outside the motel.&nbsp; The heightened ceiling and wide walls gave the impression of a convention hall, and the more Michelle observed the guests, the more she realized that is exactly what it was&#8212;vendors from across the country coming and displaying their unwilling goods, hoping to generate interest and profits.

Beside her, Suri&#8217;s eyes darted from woman to woman, inspecting each person briefly.&nbsp; �There are so many,� she said.&nbsp; �The jackasses never made it seem this awesome.�

�Where do we have to register?�

�No idea.&nbsp; Just ask around.&nbsp; Oh, and take off the girl&#8217;s robe.&nbsp; Let them see what they&#8217;re bidding on.�

Michelle pulled the robe off of Eliza&#8217;s shoulders, exposing her tits.&nbsp; Her body was criss-crossed in a loose harness which extended down to her thighs and up to her collar.&nbsp; �Come on, Eliza.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t be shy.�

The former deputy protested mutely into her gag, but stumbled forward in her high heels.&nbsp; She had learned&#8212;but not completely accepted--her new place in life during her short time under Michelle&#8217;s care, an accomplishment that Michelle took great pride in.

The young domme had no love for the property thrust onto her the impulses of Keith and Joe, but it did not prevent her from doing her job.&nbsp; Michelle smiled as she accepted that is what it was&#8212;a job, the first one she ever held in her short life.&nbsp; Or, at least the first job she had ever enjoyed or willingly accepted.

The trip continued through the crowd, looking for a registration desk that another guest had mentioned.&nbsp; However, her pursuit was interrupted by a familiar face out of the corner of her eye.&nbsp; A man kneeled beside a young blond woman, his hands behind his back, his penis locked in a chastity cage.&nbsp; It took a moment for Michelle to place his boyish face.

�Mr. Smith?� she asked as she moved in for closer a look.

�Michelle!� yelled Suri, her hand reaching out to restrain her friend but barely missing. 

It was him, she was certain; her twelfth grade math teacher, a lanky white man by the name of Brian Smith.&nbsp; �Mr. Smith!&nbsp; Oh my God.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His mistress quickly stepped between the student and her teacher.&nbsp; �Can I help you, miss?� she said, with condescension in her voice despite her diminutive height.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That&#8217;s an old teacher of mine.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Suri rushed to her side and whispered, �Michelle��

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The blond woman&#8217;s attention perked up.&nbsp; �Oh, you were a student at Serenity Falls?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well, if you care about this man, bid on him.&nbsp; He is of no use to me anymore� Michelle was it?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Come on!� yelled Suri, grabbing Michelle&#8217;s arm and pulling her away.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The chain of Suri, Michelle, and Eliza disappeared back into the crowd, cutting and weaving through the pack of domination enthusiasts and victims until they were far away from the mysterious blond woman.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What were you thinking, Michelle?� asked Suri.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Huh?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Confronting that woman.&nbsp; Why did you do that?�

�That slave was a teacher of mine.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That&#8217;s no excuse to confront the owner. If you care, buy him.&nbsp; There are no other options.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That seems a bit callous.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Callous?&nbsp; The last thing anybody here wants to know is that somebody may have an interest in notifying the police.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�But��

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�But keep it to yourself, okay?&nbsp; Those are the rules of the game.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle nodded&nbsp;&nbsp; The lesson made sense, in a truly fundamental way.&nbsp; Rules are rules, after all, and there exist penalties for those that break them.&nbsp; Just as a mistress chastises disobedient slaves, any group of people will take it upon themselves to punish those that forget their place.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her eyes scanned the crowd, paying attention to the subtle interactions between groups.&nbsp; Each pocket of people had a hierarchy of power, which mirrored itself in the greater mob.&nbsp; Slaves bowing to their owners, owners ceding to the directions of the organizers, and organizers doing everything within their power to skirt law enforcement--&nbsp; a perfectly functional society existing parasitically off of the 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At that moment, she realized the beauty of it all.&nbsp; The entire world kept in the balance by punishment, or, more frequently, the mere threat of it.&nbsp; That was how such an underground society worked; follow the rules and keep quiet, or, suffer.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle grabbed Eliza&#8217;s leash.&nbsp; The slave&#8217;s attention snapped to her mistress immediately.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Nice reflex time, Eliza.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her response came only with her eyes.&nbsp; A cutting glare, signifying that for all her abuse there still lingered a keen intellect.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Stop staring at me like that.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t you want me to have pleasant memories of you when you&#8217;re gone?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The stare remained.&nbsp; Michelle turned back towards the crowd and walked, Suri following at her side and Eliza to her rear.&nbsp; Together, the scoured the convention hall until they entered the center clearing.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A tiny booth sat dead center, facing a field of fold-out chairs and manned by a plump woman in her fifties.&nbsp; &#8216;Registration&#8217; read a simple sign hanging beneath the center. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The bespectacled lady stood to greet them as the approached.&nbsp; �Good evening!&nbsp; I was just about to close up, but it looks like we have one more item for the block.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That is correct,� replied Michelle.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good, good,� the lady responded with enthusiasm.&nbsp; She sat back down to scrawl something illegible in a notebook, then handed Suri a lanyard.&nbsp; �Prep begins in an hour. Just make sure she&#8217;s backstage to the left wearing that, and leave her with one of our associates.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle and Suri looked at the badge.&nbsp; It merely listed a number in two-inch-tall black letters&#8212;327.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Thank you, miss,� said Michelle.&nbsp; She and her companions left the booth.&nbsp; As they walked, Michelle asked Suri, �Is that high?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I have no idea about.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve never been her before, remember?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well you seem to know what&#8217;s going on.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That&#8217;s because the jackasses only took me to smaller events out in Podunk.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They continued to peruse the convention floor, watching in amazement at the perverse defilements visited upon unwilling flesh.&nbsp; Though female slaves easily outnumbered men, there were still enough to notice.&nbsp; On one of the avenues off the central stadium, Mr. Smith hanged from his wrists as a group of women tortured his naked body.&nbsp; Clips and clamps pinched nearly every inch of his body while a raven-haired woman wearing rimless glasses and gray pantsuits drilled him from behind.&nbsp; He screamed into his gag, eliciting cheers from the spectators.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Something about his plight saddened Michelle.&nbsp; He was an awkward, timid little man when he was her teacher, but he deserved better than that.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Maybe I&#8217;ll bid on him,� whispered Michelle to Suri.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Are you serious?&nbsp; You can get better off the street.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�He doesn&#8217;t deserve that.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�So, what are you going to do?&nbsp; Free him?&nbsp; That isn&#8217;t allowed.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�We&#8217;ll see.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They returned to the central stadium and handed Eliza to remarkably normal looking stage crew, making sure to place numbered lanyard around her neck so that her number dangled just above her bare tits.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As the deputy disappeared into the mob of unwanted property, Michelle couldn&#8217;t help but stare at her body.&nbsp; Well-muscled, smooth skin, perfect handful sized breasts; it was a shame that she was so difficult to manage.&nbsp; Though more obedient than weeks earlier, she wasn&#8217;t worth the trouble.&nbsp; Besides, she was a police officer, and would certainly be worth something on the open market.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They took seats near the front and watched the opening of the auction.&nbsp; Michelle was completely shocked, not just by the exorbitant prices for prime specimens, but the quality of the stock.&nbsp; Her expectation of single items of varying qualities was completely shattered by the three headlining items.&nbsp; 

First, a full set of missionaries thought to be on their way to god knows where when their plane was diverted.&nbsp; Three women, two men, all young, healthy, and scared.&nbsp; Though Michelle thought the mixed gender blend would be less than optimal, the package fetched over four-hundred thousand dollars.

The second lot was quadruplets in two sets of female identical twins, one pair blond, the other brunette, each gagged and naked.&nbsp; Though their bodies were smooth and toned, they defied expectations for the beautiful and had each obtained degrees in the sciences.&nbsp; The total price?&nbsp; Upwards of one-and-a-half million dollars.

The last of the headliner lots was the twenty-seven year-old daughter of a well-known politician who had disappeared weeks ago while boating.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many had expected her to follow her father&#8217;s footsteps, and it probably would have happened had she not been abducted.&nbsp; Michelle couldn&#8217;t help but wonder why the girl was kidnapped, whether it was out of greed, lust, or hatred of her father, but the bottom line was a nearly two-million dollar payout.

At that moment, she realized that her family&#8217;s wealth, envied by all in Serenity Falls, was nothing but a pittance to the scale of the game she had become part of.&nbsp; Decades of her father&#8217;s work were almost met by a single well-timed and well-executed abduction.&nbsp; 

The cash her and Suri had shoved into a suitcase would not be enough for anything but the most unwanted creatures to be put on the block.&nbsp; Mr. Smith tempted her briefly, but a pair of fem-dommes bid the price past her twenty-thousand dollar limit right out of the gate. She had no choice but to watch the rest of the auction in feckless silence, through hundreds of appealing items of all ages and shapes, until even Eliza, the second to last lot, came and went.

�Damnit, how could she not have sold?� yelled Michelle as her and Suri headed backstage.&nbsp; �Why didn&#8217;t they go any lower?�

�Michelle�� 

�No, I&#8217;m serious.&nbsp; Somebody must want her.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�And somebody does want her, but the auctioneers won&#8217;t drop below the reserve price offered by them,� Suri revealed.&nbsp; She pointed her finger to a large black tent adjacent to the staging areal.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Who are they?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Nobody knows, but they&#8217;ll offer a flat fee of five-thousand dollars for women and two for men, regardless of their condition, no questions asked.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What do they use them for?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�They won&#8217;t say, but Keith and Joe tossed out a few ideas.&nbsp; They said the people would be used for� parts.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle shuddered at the idea.&nbsp; �That&#8217;s terrible.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That&#8217;s just a rumor, though.&nbsp; I think five-thousand dollars is just the value of a warm hole that can be shipped to any filthy bar or brothel in the world.&nbsp; At least that&#8217;s what I hope.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�So that&#8217;s what Eliza&#8217;s future holds?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A voice came from the entrance of the tent. �You can have her back for a one-hundred dollar handling fee.&nbsp; You know, to cover the cost of holding her for auction.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle turned to Suri, but the Indian woman merely closed her eyes, shook her head, and shrugged her shoulders.&nbsp; It was Michelle&#8217;s decision to make as their de facto leader.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The decision came surprisingly easily.&nbsp; �You can keep her.&nbsp; She&#8217;s not worth the trouble.� 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;----------------------------------------

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They spent the night together in a motel room, sharing each other&#8217;s warmth in a lovers&#8217; embrace.&nbsp; The van ride home was uneventful, with nothing but small talk to be made until they could digest the weekend&#8217;s events.&nbsp; And, in the stretches of silence, Michelle pondered the future.&nbsp; The convention had fueled the flames of her lust, but it had also awakened deeper fantasies of power and control.&nbsp; The queen&#8217;s realm would soon extend far beyond her basement dungeon. 










The Queen of Sorrow&#8217;s Falls
Part Seven
The Rival
By Razor7826 (Copyright 2008)

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle Von Houten sat a table in the corner of the foodcourt and observed the world as it was.&nbsp; Growing up, she had never thought people watching would become a hobby of hers, but there she was, silently taking notes on the oblivious crowd around her.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She looked at the time on her cell phone and made a mark on the header of a new journal page.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;12:07 PM, XX/XX/XXXX&nbsp;&nbsp; Morning observations revealed few potential suspects beyond the average young women that can be found anywhere.&nbsp; So far, none have nearly the potential for profit necessary for our operation.&nbsp; However, there is the poss�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Like hell that will work!� yelled a dirty young man seated two tables from Michelle.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His Asian companion leaned forward and placed a hand on his shoulder.&nbsp; �Calm down Frank.&nbsp; This isn&#8217;t the sort of place to make a scene.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He grumbled, but sat back down, continuing their conservation quietly.&nbsp; Though their argument was heated, the way they looked directly into each others eyes betrayed a deep connection. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle looked them over closer.&nbsp; The man looked to be around thirty years old, unshaven, with dirty brown hair that spilled from beneath his white and red trucker&#8217;s cap.&nbsp; He wore a wife-beater, but didn&#8217;t have the muscle mass or the tan to make him look like anything other than a hick.&nbsp; His woman, on the other hand, was an Asian woman in her early twenties with straight and shiny black hair, well-utilized makeup and fashionable clothing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Something about their relationship and pairing seemed off, but their hushed tones revealed no information.&nbsp; She scrawled a note about them and continued to scan the crowd, this time focusing on a crowd of thirty-something women that laughed together over lunch.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Again, she was interrupted.&nbsp; Her cellphone rang the first few bars of Ode to Joy, signifying an incoming call from Suri.&nbsp; �Hello?� she answered.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�She&#8217;s fucking pregnant,� yelled the woman on the other side.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Pregnant?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yeah, Toby knocked her up.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Isn&#8217;t she too old for that?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Apparently not.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Damnit!&nbsp; How could he let that happen?&nbsp; Didn&#8217;t anyone think to force feed her some pills like we did to the bitch&#8217;s daughter?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�He says he did.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That&#8217;s crap.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�They aren&#8217;t fool proof, Michelle.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her rage spiked briefly, but she breathed deeply and calmed herself.&nbsp; It was nothing to worry about.&nbsp; There were outlets for pregnant women.&nbsp; She would be taken care of well� at least she thought, though it wasn&#8217;t much of her concern.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Tell the daddy to keep his focus on the campaign.&nbsp; This baby issue isn&#8217;t anything worth losing focusing on.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It isn&#8217;t sitting very well with him.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I guess it shouldn&#8217;t.&nbsp; How&#8217;s Jody doing?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Very well.&nbsp; The wounds are healing nicely, and she&#8217;s been rather agreeable.&nbsp; Played with her for an hour or two, and she didn&#8217;t resist at all.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good to here I&#8217;m not alone in thinking she&#8217;s finally accepting it all.&nbsp; It took nearly six months, but we&#8217;ll talk more about it when I get back tonight.&nbsp; I really want to get some good leads before I leave today.&nbsp;&nbsp; �

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You won&#8217;t find much of value at Rivers,� she said.&nbsp; �You have to head a little bit further to the South-East, towards Hamptons.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�We&#8217;ll see.&nbsp; Talk to you later, Suri.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Later.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She hung up the phone, shoved it into her purse, and left the food court.&nbsp; Three hours of waiting had gotten her nothing of value but a smoothie and a small fry.&nbsp; If there were women to be found, it wouldn&#8217;t be in there.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The mall was unusually crowded for mid-October, though Michelle hadn&#8217;t had a chance to visit in recent years.&nbsp; While the men and women of the surrounding cities were as attractive as anywhere else, nothing piqued Michelle&#8217;s interest.&nbsp; Now that she had seen the quality of lots at the convention, she knew what it would require to be profitable.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There were many groups of high school students, but few were pretty and most were clearly too young.&nbsp; Though the bondage community was filled with violent and sadistic fiends, she had learned that even they had no tolerance for child abuse.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A few young couples sparked Michelle&#8217;s lust, but there was nothing to hint they would be worth more than parts.&nbsp;&nbsp; Same for the groups of mature women&#8212;nice eye candy, great bodies, but nothing worth taking by force.&nbsp; Michelle continued through the mall, her eyes scanning each and every passerby.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was nice, relaxing day, alone from the continual presence of her friends or slaves.&nbsp; However, her moments of peace came to an end just as she crossed the entrance to Victoria&#8217;s Secret.&nbsp; Exiting the store just as Michelle walked by was the nameless short blond woman that had kidnapped and sold her math teacher, Mr. Smith.&nbsp; Michelle recognized the sly bitch immediately and jerked her head away, not wanting to make eye contact, but even from the corner of her eye she felt the woman&#8217;s cold stare.&nbsp; She kept walking until she reached the anchor store and when she turned to look, the woman was nowhere to be seen.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Something about the little blond woman chilled Michelle&#8217;s blood.&nbsp; Though they shared a similar love for power and domination, their brief interaction at the convention had chilled Michelle in an unfamiliar way.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Certain the woman was gone, Michelle took a seat on a bench and began once again scanning the crowd for potential assets.&nbsp; The demographics skewed older and wealthier than at the food court, the anchor store undoubtedly serving as a target for more mature tastes.&nbsp; However, the true honey pot was the bridal store.&nbsp; Michelle&#8217;s seat offered a great view of a dressing area near the middle of the store.&nbsp; Though the first few patrons were nothing spectacular, the fourth appointment drew Michelle&#8217;s attention like the shine of a gold ingot.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They appeared to be identical twins, both flawless beauties with smooth white skin, light freckles, and shiny black hair that curled just below the chins.&nbsp; She estimated them to be roughly the same age as herself, though they were fundamentally different; the thought of marriage, or the emotions that could ever lead to a blissful union, were completely foreign to her.&nbsp; However, her unfamiliarity with love did not hinder her ability to appreciate idea of two young women both finding love before so early in life.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Their mother stood between them, straightening skirts and hems as the twins tried on many dresses.&nbsp; She looked much like her daughters, though about twenty years older.&nbsp; Together, they looked like a picturesque and happy family, a mother planning the weddings of her two grown children.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle stood and entered the bridal shop.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Hi, I&#8217;d like to make an appointment.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The clerk asked in a snippy tone, �You a bridesmaid?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Maid of honor.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Let me see.�&nbsp; He pulled up a menu on the computer and began scrolling through the schedule.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While the clerk was preoccupied, Michelle drew closer to the sisters.&nbsp; The associate that was helping brought in two dresses.&nbsp; He handed them to the mother and said, �Here you go, Miss Michaels,� completely unaware that his simple identification had sealed the fate of the family.&nbsp; She pulled out her notebook and wrote �Michaels� in the middle of the page; it would be enough to discern their full names and addresses.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�We have a�� started the associate at the front desk, but Michelle just waved him off, apologizing for the confusion.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her job for the day was accomplished.&nbsp; Now, it was time to enjoy herself. It was time to shop.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It had been years since she experienced the simple pleasure of a shopping spree.&nbsp; No longer inhibited by her parent&#8217;s paltry allowance, she could buy whatever she well pleased, though she kept it limited to only several bags full.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Throughout her errands, she saw not a trace of the short blond woman.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Two smoothies and three hours later, Michelle was ready to burst.&nbsp; It was after dark, and foot traffic at the mall was beginning to wane.&nbsp; She rushed into the deserted bathroom and headed for the furthest stall.&nbsp; Michelle opened the door to enter, but was pushed in from behind.&nbsp; �Wha�� she began to yell before a hand clamped over her mouth.&nbsp; She turned and her eyes met the cold stare of her rival.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Hello, Michelle von Houten.&nbsp; Remember me?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle tried to shake her mouth free, but the woman had a surprisingly strong grip.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Silence, Michelle,� she whispered.&nbsp; �Wouldn&#8217;t want any of the other guests knowing what we&#8217;re doing in here.&nbsp; We&#8217;d both be pressed with public obscenity charges.�&nbsp; She pulled her hand away, allowing Michelle to speak.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�How did you know my name?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Once I learned you were on of Brian&#8217;s students, all it took was a glimpse through the yearbook.&nbsp; Michelle von Houten, only child, heir to a sizeable fortune and complete recluse.&nbsp; There was a story about you in the school newspaper last year.&nbsp; Wasn&#8217;t very positive, but the girl that wrote it was a shameless little cunt.&nbsp; I could have taught her a lot about life if she didn&#8217;t run away.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle noted the irony but kept her face emotionless, not wanting to reveal any more information to her stalker.&nbsp; �What do you want?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The woman placed her index finger to her lips and whispered �Shhhh�� she reached into her purse and pulled out thick, pink dildo, two inches in diameter and covered in tiny, pointed bumps.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What the�� yelled Michelle, but she silenced herself as the restroom door opened, allowing several pairs of footsteps to enter.&nbsp; The woman was right; speaking out would likely result in obscenity charges for the both of them.&nbsp; Though she thought of screaming out for help, she knew that her hobby had placed her outside of the law&#8217;s help.&nbsp; Once they chose to enter the community, they had to stay in it for good, foregoing any right to protection from the law. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The blond woman placed her hand on the back of Michelle&#8217;s head and turned her to the wall, then pushed her forward with a quick shove, forcing Michelle to support herself with her hands against the wall. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle took it silently as the woman slid the dildo up her leg, inside her red dress, and straight into her unready and unclothed cunt-- as usual, she wore no panties.&nbsp; She bit her lip as the woman shoved the dildo in and out, deeper and faster as other women came and went inside the bathroom.&nbsp; If anyone suspected the silent rape in the far stall, they did nothing to stop it.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The assault continued, and it took Michelle more and more willpower to keep herself quiet, the feelings straddling the border between pain and pleasure.&nbsp; Finally, as she neared her climax and the bathroom emptied, she let out a long, deep, moan of pleasure.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Are you okay in there?� asked an elderly sounding voice from a stall on the far end of restroom.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The bathroom was not as empty as Michelle thought it was.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t know how to respond.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Whatever.&nbsp; I&#8217;m too old for this crap,� replied the elderly voice. 

A few minutes later, the restroom truly emptied.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She pulled down Michelle&#8217;s skirt and grabbed a handful of it, which she used to wipe the blood and juices from her dildo.&nbsp; �Thank you, Miss von Houten.&nbsp; I hope we can do this again sometime.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle returned a hateful glare.



 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-------------

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle walked through the front door of her home and ignored the calls from the basement.&nbsp; Though there was business to take care of, she had to know one thing, and one thing only.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She sat at her computer, logged online, and searched for the homepage of Serenity Falls High School.&nbsp; A quick browse at the faculty pages revealed precisely what she needed.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gertrude Reynolds
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Age 24
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Chair of the Math Department
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Advisor for the Math Club

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And, as Michelle now knew, an evil, sadistic, cunt.&nbsp; A true and worthy rival for The Queen of Sorrow&#8217;s Falls.









The Queen of Sorrow&#8217;s Falls
Part Eight
The Election
By Razor 7826 (Copyright 2008)
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�We&#8217;re going to have to do something with the mother,� said Michelle von Houten as she stared at her pair of prisoners. Despite being in separate cells, the mother and daughter of the Klint family hugged each other in protective embrace.&nbsp; Their pale skin melded together in the artificial light of The Queen&#8217;s basement dungeon, their skin having barely touched by sunlight since their captivity months ago.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They often slept like that, clinging to each other through the spaced bars separating the cells and foregoing the slightly more comfortable cots.&nbsp; Though the mother&#8217;s vain attempts at protection would never succeed&#8212;it never did before&#8212;their affection for each other gave Michelle a slight tinge of remorse for her own family.&nbsp; Though decades apart in age, the family members looked remarkably the same.&nbsp; Both had large breasts on tiny frames, accentuated by their carefully controlled diets and sexual exercise that dominated their new lives.&nbsp; The younger had short, curly red hair, and the mother&#8217;s, despite having the same color, was long and straight.&nbsp; The signs of her pregnancy were only starting to show, her belly slightly bulging in a way inexplicable by normal weight gain.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Michelle turned to her friends, Suri and Toby, who flanked her sides.&nbsp; �This is going to be a lot more complicated than it should be, Toby.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Toby rubbed his hand through his short brown hair and grunted in frustration.&nbsp; �Please, Michelle.&nbsp; You know this wasn&#8217;t an easy decision.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle rubbed his shoulder.&nbsp; �Sorry, Tobe.&nbsp; You&#8217;re doing the right thing.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Thanks.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t worry, it&#8217;s only a few more months.&nbsp; We really should come up with a better arrangement for her.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�We can chain her up in the quest bedroom,� offered Michelle.&nbsp; �She&#8217;ll be happy to get out of the dungeon for a while.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Toby shook his head.&nbsp; �No, that would be a pain to monitor her.&nbsp; We should just bring down a bed and put it in one of the larger cells.&nbsp; Bring some blankets and the such.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Suri chimed in, her voice crackling with enthusiasm.&nbsp; �That reminds me.&nbsp; I dug my mom&#8217;s maternity clothes out of the attic last week, thinking she could use some.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle looked back at Suri with the intent of shooting the idea down, but stopped.&nbsp; The Indian woman looked so cheerful, and she was right.&nbsp; For all the abuse visited upon Julia Klint, she was pregnant; they needed to take better care of her, and that included keeping her appropriately clothed.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It did not take long to ready a new cell for the pregnant woman.&nbsp; Not caring about appearance, the three masters took only the mattress, linings, and pillows from the guest bedroom and dragged them into the largest of the basement cells.&nbsp; Though there were seven distinct cells in the basement, each with their own amenities and gates, only three had ever seen use.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now, the fourth and largest contained a bare mattress and a clump of pillows and comforters.&nbsp; In the other corner rested the maternity clothes, folded into a nice pile.&nbsp; They saw no need to make them cell neat for its now occupant, for if she cared about neatness she would do it herself.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Thank you,� sighed the mother as she was led into the cell by her leash.&nbsp; She collapsed onto the bed and drew the comforters clothing; it was the first time in over half a year that she had touched any fabric other than the tiny cot of her cell or the clothes of her masters.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle was surprised at how happy the woman seemed, but quickly remembered her own experiences.&nbsp; In the days after her own escape from slavery, there was limitless joy to be found in even the most mundane actions and comforts.&nbsp; �Perfect,� she announced as she gazed over her subjects.&nbsp; �Now, Toby, I believe we have other business to take care of.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�We sure do.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Do you think it is necessary?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m up in the polls, buts it&#8217;s too close to tell.&nbsp; So, I think that means &#8216;yes&#8217;.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Fantastic.&nbsp; It&#8217;s about time that we solve the problem with law enforcement.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-----

Hours later, the trio parked Michelle&#8217;s van on a wooded side street near the newly purchased home of attorney Mary Gates.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I can&#8217;t believe she bought a home just so she could run for office here,� commented Suri from the back of the van.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m even more surprised that some of the people here are dumb enough to look past that,� answered Toby, his voice filled with disappointment in his townsfolk.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle shook her head and smiled, her glare still staring down the deserted street.&nbsp; �Well, you don&#8217;t really have any relevant experience, Toby.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It&#8217;s always been a small department.&nbsp; There hasn&#8217;t been a reported murder in years, let alone any petty vandalism.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle smiled at his description.&nbsp; Most of the crime in the past year had been her own doing, but none of it&#8212;not the murders, not the arson, and not the kidnappings&#8212;had been publicly attributed to her.&nbsp; However, she knew, that such luck would could not last forever.&nbsp; �Do you think the Interim Sheriff will stick around if the cunt drops out of the race?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Toby laughed.&nbsp; �Gary?&nbsp; Not a chance.&nbsp; His wife is waiting for him at their retirement home.&nbsp; He was in construction, not law enforcement.&nbsp; Hell, even I&#8217;m more qualified for the job then he is.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good.&nbsp; We can&#8217;t�� started Michelle before cutting herself off. Around the corner, a red beamer pulled into the house&#8217;s driveway and into the garage.&nbsp; �She&#8217;s here.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s go.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Suri stayed behind as Michelle and Toby walked across the street and across her lawn.&nbsp; They nodded to each other silently and each took their positions: Toby at the front door, Michelle just off to the side and hidden from view.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They nodded again.&nbsp; Toby rang the doorbell and slid both of his hands into his coat pocket and clenched his hidden weapon.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle could hear the door open from her stalking point, but could not see the owner.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Tobias?&nbsp; What are you doing here?� asked the unseen woman.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I came to talk to you about Tuesday&#8217;s election.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh, come in.&nbsp; I just got home a few minutes ago.&nbsp; You really should have called first.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Don&#8217;t worry.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have much to say.�

Toby followed with a smile on his face.&nbsp; Seven seconds later, the house shook with the sound of a human body collapsing to the floor.

�It&#8217;s done, Michelle.�

------------

The reached the dungeon thirty minutes later.&nbsp; Suri held the basement door open as Toby stumbled down the steps.

Across his shoulders he carried Mary Gates, the six-foot-four lawyer and only challenger in Toby&#8217;s campaign for Sheriff.&nbsp; She still wore her campaign suit&#8212;a grey pinstriped two piece jacket and skirt.&nbsp; Her short blonde hair still bounced in their impeccable curled locks.&nbsp; She moaned gently under her breath, the repeated shocks from Michelle&#8217;s stungun having drained what little resistance she had.&nbsp; Toby dropped her to the floor and stretched his back.&nbsp; �Damn, she might be a twig, but that doesn&#8217;t make carrying her around easy.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle looked around the dungeon.&nbsp; Julia was asleep on her bed, just as Michelle had expected; she knew that a true bed felt like heaven after months of sleeping on the floor.&nbsp; However, she was disappointed to see that the daughter had been given one of the many blankets they had placed in her mother&#8217;s cell.&nbsp; Jodie was curled into a ball, sleeping inside a thick red comforter atop her tiny floor mat. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Damnit, Jodie,� yelled Michelle as she grabbed the keychain from her pocket and headed towards the cell door.&nbsp; However, she stopped midway. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; �No, she can be comfortable, for now,� she muttered to herself.&nbsp; �It will just make it all the more painful for her later.�&nbsp; Besides, there was another source of sorrow to bleed.&nbsp; She turned her attention towards the captured lawyer.

Mary Gates rested in the middle of the circle, groggy from the shocks and unaware of the predicament she had been forced into.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Where am I,� she asked as she tried to raise herself onto her knees but failed.&nbsp; Her arms jerked wildly behind her as she struggled push off the ground, still unaware that her wrists were bound together with thick leather cuffs and a short metal chain.&nbsp; Her squinted eyes scanned the room, failing to focus on the threats around her.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You&#8217;re home, Mary.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle, Suri, and Toby stood around their prey, each holding a stungun.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Why don&#8217;t you try escaping, carpet bagger?� taunted Michelle.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With a pained heave of her body, the lawyer swung herself up and onto her knees.&nbsp; Her short skit slid up her legs and revealed her nylon tinted legs.&nbsp; She looked back and forth from each of her three captors, her face slowly shifting from confusion to pure terror.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Tobias?� she asked, her voice cracking with uncharacteristic uncertainty.&nbsp; �What are you planning?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Toby stepped forward, kneeled in front of her, and held up to her face.&nbsp; �Tell me, Mary.&nbsp; What made you choose Serenity Falls?&nbsp; Why did you choose this town for the starting point of your selfish ambition?

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I asked you a question first, Tobias,� retorted the lawyer with a wry smirk.&nbsp; �Answer mine, and I&#8217;ll answer yours.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Without hesitation, Toby shoved the stungun against her neck and pulled the trigger.&nbsp; Her body jerked and twitched from the voltage and she fell back onto the ground.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Gyaaaaah!� she screamed as she writhed on her side, her fingers and arms flexing as if she had a chance of freeing herself.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Answer now, you filthy whore.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mary closed her eyes and breathed heavily before responding.&nbsp; The words escaped from her mouth slowly and clearly.&nbsp; �You know as well as I it was just resume building.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�But why here?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She straightened herself onto her knees.&nbsp; �I only moved after hearing about the potentially uncontested election.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t expect such competition from a� veterinarian.&nbsp; I still can&#8217;t understand how these hicks would vote for you.&nbsp; I mean, I have an undergraduate degree in law enforcement.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Your education doesn&#8217;t matter anymore, sweetie,� laughed Toby.&nbsp; He bent down and stroked the smooth skin of her cheek.&nbsp; �Not at all��

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mary jerked away.&nbsp; �Let me go, you fucking freaks.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Not a chance in hell.�&nbsp; He grabbed the collar of her suit and pulled, tearing both her jacket and blouse in one swift jerk and revealing her black push-up bra.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She screamed and hunched her body over, as if to protect her cleavage from the gazes of her captors. �They&#8217;ll know you did this,� she said, turning her eyes up to meet Toby&#8217;s.&nbsp; �You&#8217;ll pay for this.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once again, Toby laughed.&nbsp; �Really?&nbsp; Who will make us pay?&nbsp; By the time anyone genuinely gets worried about, I&#8217;ll be elected sheriff and placed in charge of the investigation.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The color ran from Mary&#8217;s face.&nbsp; �No��

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Toby merely grinned in complete triumph.&nbsp; He stood back onto his feet and encircled the lawyer, until he was behind her back.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Time for you to start earning your keep, Mary.�&nbsp; He grabbed her shoulders and shoved her to the ground, where she landed with a thud, unable to support herself.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her skirt was already curling up her thighs, so he finished the job, exposing her black lace panties.&nbsp; He rolled her pantyhose down her legs and quickly tore the side of her panties, causing them to fall down to her right knee. �Are you ready?� he asked, but didn&#8217;t care.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No, please,� she cried.&nbsp; �I&#8217;ll do anything.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Toby ignored her as unbuttoned his jeans and pulled out his engorged cock.&nbsp; It slid into her cunt in one swift motion.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She screamed for help, but Michelle and Suri interpreted her pleas differently.&nbsp; Instead of helping the captive woman, they assisted their friend in the defilement of the enemy.&nbsp; Michelle hiked up her red dress and slid on a thick strap on dildo, which she used to violate the lawyer&#8217;s mouth.&nbsp; 

Suri, however, took a more submissive role.&nbsp; She crawled beneath Mary&#8217;s chest and pushed up the bra, revealing the 36C tits.&nbsp; Suri grabbed one with both her hands, leaned forward and began suckling.&nbsp; 

Mary cried throughout the night as their assault continued, taking turns, violating each of her holes in as many ways they could think of.&nbsp; Much like the Tolsin&#8217;s, the Klint&#8217;s, and the former sheriff&#8217;s department, Mary would pay the price for crossing the Queen of Serenity Falls.&nbsp;&nbsp; She was a piece of meat, as far as Michelle was concerned, an outlet of sorrow and punishment.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They continued into the early morning, hours after her cries were replaced with stunned silence.&nbsp; Cum dribbled from her lips and dildos filled her cunt and ass, but she made no attempt to clean or free herself.&nbsp; She was defeated; the election had been lost before the first ballot was cast.&nbsp; The limitless ambition that had led her to the small Midwest city would no longer be of use to her.

Standing atop their prey, Michelle reached out and shook Toby&#8217;s hand.&nbsp; �Congratulations, Toby.&nbsp; You just won the election for Sheriff of Serenity Falls.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Toby reared his foot back and kicked the dildo deeper into the lawyer&#8217;s cunt.&nbsp; �If everything goes as planned, this town will be anything but &#8216;serene&#8217;.









The Queen of Sorrow&#8217;s Falls
Part Nine
The Sheriff
By Razor7826 (Copyright 2008)


 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle von Houten stood outside the small sheriff&#8217;s station on the outskirts of Serenity Falls.&nbsp; It was a late may afternoon and the first perfect day of the year: seventy degrees, and not a cloud in the sky.&nbsp; However, she still wore a long sleeved black winter coat.&nbsp; In front of her she held the plastic baby carrier she and her friends had ordered online; inside, the unnamed newborn.&nbsp; He cooed softly.

Michelle instinctively checked on the baby to see if he was okay.&nbsp; Still alive, still curlled in his blankets.&nbsp; The home birth had gone perfectly, and there were no signs of problems.&nbsp; With her free hand, she opened the door.

The sheriff looked up then stood from his desk.&nbsp; �Michelle, you&#8217;re finally here.� He walked over and checked on his son.

�Yes, everything&#8217;s fine, Toby.&nbsp; You don&#8217;t have to worry so much.

�Sorry, but that&#8217;s how I am.&nbsp; Did anybody see you come in?�

�How would I know?� she asked.&nbsp; �It&#8217;s broad daylight, I wasn&#8217;t worry worrying about that.�

�Right, right.�

Michelle placed the carrier down onto the desk.&nbsp; �So how are things going, sheriff?� she asked.

�They&#8217;re going pretty good.&nbsp; There hasn&#8217;t been any crime of note since I started, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s easy.&nbsp; The paperwork is getting a bit backlogged; it seems that my two predecessors were sitting on a bunch of applications.�

�Huh?�

�Serenity Falls needs more than two officers.&nbsp; While there aren&#8217;t even a thousand residents, the high school is just barely over township lines, making it our jurisdiction.&nbsp; Me and Deputy Mehta aren&#8217;t going to be enough.�

�Damnit, that kind of defeats the purpose of electing you if we can&#8217;t stock it with our people.

�Not necessarily.&nbsp; We can do outside recruiting.�

Michelle tilted her head and looked at Toby in confusion before realizing what he meant.&nbsp; �Toby, that&#8217;s brilliant!�

�Thank you.&nbsp; I&#8217;m certain that there are plenty of people out there willing to relocate if it means having a sham job and immunity from the law for our� hobbies�

In an instant, Michelle mentally accepted and embraced the conclusion of such a plan.&nbsp; While before, all she had hoped for was a peaceful life in charge of her own slaves, the new reality took shape before her very eyes.&nbsp; Not just her home, but the entire town a haven for masters and mistresses like Suri, Toby, and herself.&nbsp; Though the truth of the town could never be revealed, there was nothing to prevent Michelle from being the de facto queen.

Serenity Falls?&nbsp; Hardly.&nbsp;&nbsp; It would become a city of limitless sorrow and misery for those that end up on the bottom, but a city of dreams and lust for those on top.&nbsp; It would be�

Sorrow&#8217;s Falls.&nbsp; She liked that.

�This is going to be brilliant, Toby.�

�No, no, I owe it all to you.&nbsp; This was your idea.&nbsp; I never would have ran unless you pushed me.�

She knew that it was, and it thrilled her for her mental prowess to be stroked by a man she respected.

That elation did not last long, though, as the nameless baby began to cry.&nbsp; They both looked at the wailing infant.

�Are you sure you want to do this?� asked Michelle.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Toby laughed meagerly.&nbsp; �Kind of a bit late to be second guessing ourselves, isn&#8217;t it?&nbsp; Don&#8217;t worry, I know that my brother and wife will accept.&nbsp; They&#8217;ve been trying to have a child for years, but it doesn&#8217;t look like that will be happening.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Are you ever going to tell him?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Toby paused and looked at his son.&nbsp; �No, you know I can&#8217;t do that.&nbsp; It would raise too many questions about his mother, and I&#8217;m not going to risk your privacy, or mine.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle grabbed Toby in a long hug.&nbsp; �You&#8217;re doing the right thing, Tobe.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He wrapped his arms around her and pulled her in closer, as if in need of unsolicited comfort.&nbsp; �Thank you.�&nbsp; They held the embrace for several minutes.

�Now, let&#8217;s make it official.&nbsp; Just head outside, put the carrier on the step, and ring the bell.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Michelle picked up the carrier off the desk and exited the station.&nbsp; She placed it and the baby down on the step and took one last look; it would probably be her last chance to ever see the child.

Satisfied that she had done all that she could for newborn, she rang the doorbell and hurried down the street towards her car.&nbsp; She turned around when she was a block away to see Toby open the door and take in the baby, fulfilling his role in the charade.

Michelle von Houten smiled, deeply satisfied that she and Toby had done the right thing.&nbsp; However, the child&#8217;s mother and sister would not be so lucky.&nbsp; It had been a long while since either had received the attention that they deserved.

She looked forward to indulging her desires.









The Queen of Sorrow&#8217;s Falls
Chapter Ten
The Brides to Never Be
By Razor7826 (Copyright 2008)

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You sure they&#8217;re heading this way?�&nbsp; Michelle nodded to Toby as she listened intently to the cellphone.&nbsp; �Twenty minutes?&nbsp; We&#8217;ll be waiting.�&nbsp; She hung up the phone.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�So?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Exactly as we predicted.&nbsp; The aunt is with them to, so this might get a little bit more complicated.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No, don&#8217;t worry.&nbsp; They&#8217;ll be too scared to suspect a thing, even with all of them crammed into the backseat of the squad car.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Think they&#8217;ll fit?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Toby laughed.&nbsp; �Does it matter?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle chuckled at the mental image of the four skinny white women piling in to back seat.&nbsp; �Well, let&#8217;s do this.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yup.�&nbsp; Toby turned the key in the ignition and pulled a U-turn on the country road.&nbsp; Just as any weekday night, there was not a car in sight.&nbsp; That is, until they came across the dark green SUV filled with the four unsuspecting women.&nbsp; Just as planned, Michelle and Toby drove for another minute to make sure the coast was clear.&nbsp; No cars, and none on the horizon.&nbsp; With another quick U-turn and a flip of a switch, they were roaring down the highway after their prey.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The women did not begin to slow until Toby pulled up behind them and blared his siren a few times.&nbsp; Their car waivered back and forth, as if startled, before slowing down along the shoulder.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Get ready,� commanded Toby as he slowed his car to a halt thirty feet behind the SUV.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I already am.�&nbsp; There wasn&#8217;t much for her to do, except shock any of the women that dare resist arrest.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t foresee any problems, as there was no sign that the traffic stop was anything more than routine.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But it was.&nbsp; 

Months ago they were marked for collection and investigated endlessly until the perfect plan could be devised.&nbsp; And perfect it was; unless they ended up with eye witnesses.&nbsp; Even then, they had fall back plans.&nbsp; The squad car, was improperly marked and effectively untraceable.&nbsp; If any witnesses came forward after hearing news of the missing brides, the investigation would lead nowhere.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was all moot, anyhow.&nbsp; The trap had been sprung and the coast was clear.&nbsp; Michelle stared through the windshield from the safety of the passenger&#8217;s seat and watched a master at work.&nbsp; Though she could hear nothing, she knew Toby&#8217;s performance was perfect: the arch of his brow, the firm poise of his hand, the gesture and back step to lead them out of the car.&nbsp; Michelle could tell his actions were all rehearsed.&nbsp; The women had no idea what was coming.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They lined up behind the SUV and placed their hands against the trunk.&nbsp; Even through the darkness, Michelle could identify the two sets of twins by their shapes alone.&nbsp; All black haired and fair skinned, their heights and figures told all.

The brides-to-never-be, five-foot-nine, black-haired and not an ounce over 120, their asses perfectly shaped by tight denim with no belt.&nbsp; The older generation dressed more conservatively, both undoubtedly heavier but still in shape.&nbsp; Michelle couldn&#8217;t tell which was which, but did it matter?&nbsp; They&#8217;d be gagged at the convention, so any mistake would remain hidden until the deal was sealed.

One of the older women turned to yell at Toby, though her words were unclear.&nbsp; The sheriff quickly responded by pulling his night stick and brandishing it at her face.&nbsp; She spoke a few words and turned back towards the trunk.

One-by-one, Toby handcuffed their wrists together.&nbsp; Once all were bound, Michelle opened the passenger door and stood up �Are they ready?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Ready for what?� asked one of the twins, her voice strained with worry.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Nothing.&nbsp; Just going to have to take you down to the station.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The other daughter looked to her mother in confusion.&nbsp; �All of this over a problem with our license plate?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Toby reared back his nightstick and smacked the girl on her ass.&nbsp; She yelped in pain, but continued walking forward towards the waiting squad car.&nbsp; They filed in, one by one, not-quite fitting but forced in by the locked door.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�The keys are still in the ignition,� said Toby, �and from the looks of it, they all left their purses and crap inside.&nbsp; The gifts looked pretty nice, too, though I don&#8217;t think we should sell those.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Nice.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll meet you back at the mansion.�

They nodded to each other with grins on their face before parting ways.&nbsp; Toby pulled ahead while Michelle dug through the women&#8217;s purses, finding each of their cellphones and removing their batteries.&nbsp; Once she knew they were untraceable, Michelle turned the ignition and followed.&nbsp; Never closer than one-hundred feet, they drove the fifteen miles through the nighttime field and forest until they reached the outskirts of Serenity Falls and the secluded mansion of Michelle Von Houten.&nbsp; Toby entered the pass code besides the front gate and entered the estate, Michelle following shortly behind.

At the end of the driveway, just outside the garage, was the pride and joy of Michelle&#8217;s ambition&#8212;a charter bus she had bought two months earlier.&nbsp; However, like the modifications she had made to her parents&#8217; basement, so too had she gutted the interior of the bus and replaced it with tools of her own perverse dreams.

The front half of the bus remained unchanged except for several a thick, soundproof security door separating the driver&#8217;s compartment and door from the rest of the bus. Four rows of four comfortable grey upholstered chairs with an aisle down the middle.&nbsp; Luggage bins lined the roof, though their cargo was from standard touring luggage.

 The back half, however, was heavily customized.&nbsp; It was a prison on wheels, thoroughly sound proofed and impeccably tinted.&nbsp;&nbsp; Curtains further subdivided the interior, to ensure that nobody could catch a glimpse of its illicit cargo through an open door.&nbsp; Small bolts and chains littered the floor and ceilings, to assist in the bindings of her prey.&nbsp; The seats and luggage bins were stripped, to allow more room for activities. Behind the play pen, beside the restroom, was a tiny bed. Though it would be years before she would conceivably need the copious space afforded by the heavy modifications, she knew it would eventually be useful.

She had big plans for her empire, and this family was just the beginning.

�Chain them up,� commanded Michelle as Toby led the line of slaves into the bus.

�Where are you taking us?� asked one of the daughters, her voice distorted in fear.

�We don&#8217;t have enough room at the station, so you&#8217;re going to have to stay here overnight,� he responded, his stern and humorless delivery almost convincing Michelle.

The women verbally protested, but did not resist as Toby and Michelle replaced their handcuffs with more permanent leather bondage cuffs and chained them to the ceiling&#8217;s eyebolts.

�Are they secure?� asked Michelle.&nbsp; She stood at the front of the bus, in the doorway separating the driver&#8217;s compartment from the portable dungeon.

�Yup.�

�Good, that should be enough for the evening.�

�You&#8217;re going to leave us here all night?� asked the mother.

�Of course.�

�All of this over a parking ticket?�

�Oh my Lord,� laughed Michelle.&nbsp; �You still think it is over that?�

�Well then what did we do wrong?� asked the aunt.

Michelle merely smirked and led Toby from the bus.&nbsp; The door closed and the screams of the women muffled, quieting to be barely audible over the slight breeze in the summer wind.&nbsp; Michelle was certain their protests would be inaudible above the roar of the diesel engine, and with nearly a mile between them and the full perimeter fence around the estate, nobody would come to their rescue.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Michelle and Suri boarded the bus ten hours later with luggage in tow, they found the women already on the edge of breaking.&nbsp; Michelle was glad she was selling them; all four were pampered and pompous and unable to deal with the hardships of their new lives. Their makeup streaked the path of tears and their arms and wrists were red from putting too much strain on the overhead shackles.&nbsp; She tried to decide who was in worst shape, but it was too close to tell.&nbsp; Both generations were completely unable to cope with the slightest torment.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Look at them, Suri.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve never seen anything so worthless and weak as they are.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No, probably not, though the lawyer sometimes seems catatonic.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well, yeah, but that at least took a few days of� you know.&nbsp; Who is going to�� She was interrupted by the hoarse whisper of one of the older women.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle walked closer, unable to discern the new slave&#8217;s words.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Let my nieces go�� she plead.&nbsp; �Let my nieces go.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle leaned in closer to the forty year old woman and grinned.&nbsp; She moved her hand closer and shook the woman&#8217;s cheek vigorously.&nbsp; �Now why would I do that?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;ll do anything, please��

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Anything?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes!� yelled the woman as her attention perked.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Hmmm, we shall see.�&nbsp; Michelle turned to the driver&#8217;s compartment of the bus and asked, �Mind giving me a hand with the collars?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Suri bent down, unlatched her luggage, and pulled four one-inch thick collars, alongside a set of two tiny control boxes.&nbsp; The collars, though unusually wide and rigid, had an elastic inner rim to ensure constant contact.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Together, the two mistresses encircled the collars around the slaves&#8217; necks and fastened them shut with tiny key locks.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Perfect.&nbsp; Why don&#8217;t we hit the road, Suri?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Indian woman nodded and returned to the front part of the bus, closing the security door behind her.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now alone with four women, Michelle unfastened the chain that kept the aunt dangling from the ceiling.&nbsp; For the first time, she saw the woman&#8217;s face; though her makeup had run with tears throughout the night spent imprisoned in the bus, Michelle could tell that she took good care of her skin.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Now, come with me,� commanded Michelle as she grabbed the woman&#8217;s leash and led her to one of the seats, which was turned to face the rear of the bus&nbsp; She sat down and spread her legs, allowing the cold morning air to cool her unclothed snatch.&nbsp; �Now, lick it.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Excuse me?� asked the aunt.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle tugged harder on the least.&nbsp; �You heard me.� 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No� I can&#8217;t.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle returned a brief smirk, then reached to her side and fiddled with the remote control.&nbsp; All four of the prisoners screamed in pain as random jolts of electricity burned their necks.&nbsp; �Are you going to do what I ask, or not?� taunted Michelle.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The aunt complied.&nbsp; She stuck her head up Michelle&#8217;s long red dress and gently tapped the cunt with her tongue, first lightly then fiercer as she buried herself deeper inside.

�Wow, you&#8217;re good at this.&nbsp; You have experience, don&#8217;t you?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The aunt continued to lick, suck, and explore Michelle&#8217;s cunt.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The queen grabbed a handful of the slave&#8217;s hair and pulled.&nbsp; �I asked you a question.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes!� she yelled.&nbsp; Gasps escaped from her sister and nieces.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�So you never even told your family you were a lesbian?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No��&nbsp; Tears flowed down her cheeks.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It&#8217;s nothing to be ashamed of.&nbsp; Why don&#8217;t you show your family what it is like?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle pushed the slave away from her, stood, and tugged on the leash, leading the aunt on all four towards her waiting family.&nbsp; �Here.&nbsp; Show your sister what you&#8217;ve been keeping from her all these years.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I� I don&#8217;t know what you mean.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle tugged harder on the leash.&nbsp; �Her pussy, you dumb cunt.&nbsp; Lick it like you did mine.�&nbsp; She let go of the leash to free her hands.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Moments later, the mother&#8217;s pants and panties rested around her ankles.&nbsp; �Do it.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The aunt squirmed, a look of disgust and shame contorting her tear flushed face.&nbsp; �I, I can&#8217;t!� she cried.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle returned to her seat and received the remote.&nbsp; She pressed buttons one, two, and three, at the same time.&nbsp; The aunt&#8217;s relatives screamed in pain as electric shocks tore through their body.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Stop!�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle did not, and instead spoke over the brides&#8217; and mothers&#8217; anguished yelps.&nbsp; �Not until you start licking your sister.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The aunt continued to cry, but crawled closer and buried her face inside her sister&#8217;s cunt.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That&#8217;s better,� cheered Michelle.

She watched the show with sadistic glee until the aunt could continue no longer.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Tired, already?&nbsp; Well, then, who&#8217;s next?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
---

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They reached the isolated notel the following morning.&nbsp; Though Michelle and Suri rented a motel room for themselves, they left the cargo inside the bus.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All four of the new slaves were exhausted after a full day of abuse at the hands of their owners.&nbsp; No orifice was spared except for the virgin pussies of the younger twins.&nbsp; Michelle understood the increased market value of chaste twin brides, and it was enough for her to quell her own lust.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Suri and Michelle slept in each others naked embrace until late afternoon.&nbsp; There was no need to flaunt their goods for long before the show; the upcoming spectacle would be enough to garner all the attention necessary.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One-by-one, Michelle and Suri took the slaves from the bus.&nbsp;&nbsp; They put them through a shower and deep cleaning and forced them into specially made bridal wear. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The daughters wore matching white wedding dresses that were more push-up corset and gartered stockings than anything else.&nbsp; Both wore matching white panties that barely covered their nether regions and allowed for a fantastic view of their upper thighs.&nbsp; Atop their heads they wore opaque veils to hide their faces.&nbsp; Despite their beauty, an air mystery would better serve their marketing.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The older generation required a different approach.&nbsp; While the twin brides presented an obvious choice of attire, Michelle had been faced with the far more difficult task of dressing two middle-aged women in a way that portrayed their motherly and guiding nature, but also accentuated their attractive bodies.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After planning many days on the project, Michelle chose professional black business coats, paired with long-black skirts many sizes too small.&nbsp; It looked better on the mother and aunt than Michelle had imagined.&nbsp; Together with the young brides, the complete set would draw a small fortune.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With all four slaves dressed, Michelle and Suri led them by their leashes into the basement convention hall.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was every bit as busy and bizarre as the previous year&#8217;s convention.&nbsp; Cruel acts of eroticism and sadism surrounded them on every side.&nbsp; Every possible combination of men and women performed in live sex shows, either for rote pleasure or as a more blatant form of advertising.&nbsp; The decadence brought new meaning to the phrase &#8216;Sex Sells&#8217;.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Immediately, the bridal party drew attention from the crowd.&nbsp; Men and women alike offered vast quantities of cash, either for purchase or for a test drive, but Michelle held her resolve, answering each offer with a confident �If you want them, place a bid.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All seemed to be going perfectly, thought something slight bothered Michelle. More than once, she noted the presence of a twenty-something Asian woman staring at her through the crowd.&nbsp; She pretended to be oblivious to the glares but continued her business with caution.

---

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They had made two laps around the hall when Suri froze in her spot.

�Oh my god.�

�What is it, Suri?�

�It&#8217;s her.� She answered, her voice trailing off as she spring through the crowd. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle hesitated for a moment before sprinting after her friend.&nbsp; Three blocks away she caught up to find Suri hugging a gagged and naked slave girl.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Milly! Milly, I thought I&#8217;d never see you again.&nbsp; Oh my god I&#8217;m so glad you&#8217;re safe.�&nbsp; Suri embraced the meaty red-head in a fierce bear hug, but the woman did not respond, only continuing to stare forward with a blank look on her face.&nbsp; �Milly��

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What is the meaning of this?� yelled the man at the other end of Milly&#8217;s leash.&nbsp; �Who do you think you are to touch what does not belong to you?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle grabbed Suri&#8217;s upper-arm and pulled, struggling at first but eventually breaking her hold on the slave girl.&nbsp; �Suri, what&#8217;s gotten in to you?� 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That&#8217;s her, Michelle.&nbsp; That&#8217;s my Milly.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In an instant, Michelle remembered the many tales Suri had told; of her first true love, of their fetish play, of the interdiction by the former sheriff, and of Mildred&#8217;s sale on the black market.&nbsp; It had been two years since her sale, and Michelle could tell that time (and her owner) had taken their toll on her body.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her pale and lush white skin showed marks of torture; indentations from clips left in place too long, burns on her nipples and clit where electric play had been used, and small scars along her thighs, from either a grip too hard or outright cutting.&nbsp; Her expression, too, bore the signs of abuse.&nbsp; Drool dribbled down her cheek and her eyes betrayed no signs of thought, as if what little remained of her mind sat hidden in the depths of her subconscious.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle felt pity for the girl and for Suri&#8217;s distress, but she also found the scene to be hot.&nbsp; Her thoughts turned back towards her own redheaded slave, the formerly perky Jodie Klint, and imagined the tortures that could eventually lead her to such a destroyed and submissive state.&nbsp; Michelle rubbed her thighs together as she began to wet.

�So this is the desirable Suri, is it?� asked the owner.&nbsp; He was a middle-aged black man in a well-tailored suit.

�How do you know my name?�

�She cries out for you all the time, you know.&nbsp; Granted, she doesn&#8217;t talk much anymore, but &#8216;Suri&#8217; is one of the few words she speaks in my presence.�

Suri snapped towards her love&#8217;s owner and grabbed his collar.&nbsp; Vigorously shaking him, she pled, �How much do you want for her?&nbsp; We&#8217;ll pay anything, right Michelle?�

Michelle stood silently, confused at the offer.&nbsp; However, Milly&#8217;s owner countered.

�How much do I want?&nbsp; You have it backwards.&nbsp; You&#8217;re the one whose price needs to be negotiated.�&nbsp; He grabbed Suri in a hug and grabbed her ass.&nbsp; �Ah, pretty nice.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll give you two million dollars for her.�

�What?� asked Michelle.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Two million dollars.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll pay you two million dollars for your Indian friend her.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Suri pushed against the man&#8217;s chest and escaped his grasp.&nbsp; �I am nobody&#8217;s property!�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The man laughed.&nbsp; �Not yet, but you will be.&nbsp; I&#8217;d love to complete the set, even though I normally don&#8217;t go for your kind.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�She&#8217;s not mine to sell.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh, so do you mind if I take her?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Something about his offer struck Michelle off guard and she snapped.&nbsp; She raised her right hand above her head and slashed downwards, slicing his right cheek with her crimson nails.&nbsp; �No!�&nbsp; she yelled.&nbsp; �Nobody else can have her.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Gyah!&nbsp; You crazy bitch.�&nbsp; The man collapse to his knees and covered his cheek to stem the flow of blood.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle grasped Suri&#8217;s hand firmly in her own and ran.&nbsp; Together, they hurried down the aisle, Michelle leading the way as she firmly pulled Suri&#8217;s wrist.&nbsp; Once they were well away, Michelle turned towards the black slave owner to see if he was giving chase.

He was not following.&nbsp; Instead being helped up to his feet by the unforgettable figure of a tiny blond woman in thick glasses.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was Gertrude Reynolds, the only true rival to the Queen of Sorrow&#8217;s Falls.

----

�For our first lot, a pair of pairs.&nbsp; A set of twenty-one year old identical twins taken just weeks before their wedding.&nbsp; Five-foot-nine, one-hundred-and-fifteen pounds, raven-haired and lightly freckled.&nbsp; While these prime subjects would count as a collector&#8217;s item alone, we also have a bonus gift.&nbsp; Their mother, along with her own  identical twin.&nbsp; Black-hair, blue eyes, five-foot-seven, and one hundred and forty pounds, these 40-year old women can count as reassurance that their young will stay pretty as they age.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle smiled with pride from her sixth row seat.&nbsp; Suri, too, smiled in triumph, but Michelle knew that their joys were different.&nbsp; Something deep and fundamental differed between the two women, but neither could tell exactly what it was.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She glanced out of the corner of her eye.&nbsp; The Asian woman still stared back.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For the rest of the auction, Michelle pretended to pay no attention to her stalker.&nbsp; However, she kept the girl in the corner of her eye, waiting for the moment to strike.

-----

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After the auction, Michelle sprinted ahead and caught up with the stalker.&nbsp; �Why have you been staring at me?� she demanded.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The short Asian girl took a moment to gather her thoughts.&nbsp; �I recognize you, I think.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh?� asked Michelle, eager to hear what made the girl so interested.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�We went to high school together, to Serenity&#8217;s.&nbsp; Your name is Michelle, right?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m sorry, miss, but I don&#8217;t recall any Asian women in my classes��

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No, no, I was only a freshman when you were a senior, but you were pretty famous back then.&nbsp; Well, everybody knows who the rich girl is, right?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I guess,� answered Michelle.&nbsp; It had been years since Michelle thought of her life during high school.&nbsp; None of her friends or family remained, leaving little reason to even acknowledge the existence of the chaste and arrogant cheerleader that once was.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�We should exchange phone numbers.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What?� asked Michelle, shocked by the girl&#8217;s brazen attitude.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You know, always good to have contacts in the industry, right?&nbsp; That&#8217;s what Frank says.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It&#8217;s a good idea,� spoke Suri, startling Michelle.&nbsp; �Like I&#8217;ve always said, it&#8217;s a good idea to have contacts, in case you need things done.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Is it really necessary, though?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle turned and stared at Suri.&nbsp; �I really don&#8217;t think��

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Trust me, Michelle.&nbsp; The more the merrier.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle smirked.&nbsp; She remembered the associates they had murdered over a year and a half ago and imagined the same fate befalling the next group of friends that should cross her.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The queen sighed and Suri enthusiastically began chatting it up with the new friend.&nbsp; Though she disliked the endless web of necessitated relationships, she understood their purpose.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At the best, they would be aides for the queens&#8217; ascension.&nbsp; At the worst, they would become her subjects.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle glanced over the tight body of the twenty-something Asian and smiled.&nbsp; She sincerely hoped it would be the latter.









The Queen of Sorrow&#8217;s Falls
Part Eleven
The Average Work Day

By Razor7826 (Copyright 2008)


 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle von Houten awoke just after eleven A. M.&nbsp; Sunlight filtered across her half-covered body and half-empty bed.&nbsp; She tilted her head and saw that Suri was already gone.&nbsp; The sheriff&#8217;s department was still short-handed, but not as badly as it was at Toby&#8217;s election.&nbsp; One deputy had been hired, and another was undergoing training.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She showered away the sweat from the previous night&#8217;s events, then slipped into an old pair of animal print pajama bottoms and a pink tank top.&nbsp; She had grown only a little since High School, but the clothes still fit well.&nbsp; She was in her mid-twenties by now, the prime of her health, and she felt it.&nbsp; She had strength, beauty, wealth, love, and a prison full of slaves to use, abuse, and destroy as she saw fit.&nbsp; It was heaven.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She descended the stairs in her bare feet to her kitchen and poured herself a cup of coffee.&nbsp; Suri had left some warming, as usual, as well as a few extra slices of bacon in the microwave.&nbsp; It was a perfect morning.&nbsp; Good food, comfortable clothes, and blue skies in every direction.&nbsp; She finished the meal, and then descended another flight of stairs to her private dungeon.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Both Jodie and her mother knelt at the gates to their cells, obviously having taken their positions after hearing Michelle&#8217;s footsteps down the flight of stairs.&nbsp; However, the blond twenty-something lawyer stood and pounded her fist against the bars.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Are you going to feed us or what?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was her insolence that had cost the trio their dinner.&nbsp; However, the others had known their place.&nbsp;&nbsp; After a year-and-a-half of captivity, the Klint family women had at least learned rudimentary lessons on how to address their master.&nbsp; Their new companion had not, and it would be the day&#8217;s first task to teach her that lesson.&nbsp; Michelle grabbed the catch pole and tested the trigger. It worked perfectly.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good morning, everybody.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The girl and her mother responded in unison, �Good morning, Queen Michelle.�&nbsp; 

But Mary Gates remained silent.&nbsp; She only stared at Michelle with her light blue eyes and face of pure contempt.&nbsp; Her spirit had not been broken like the other two, and Michelle honestly didn&#8217;t know if the time would ever come; each time she appeared to be defeated, she recovered, bouncing back the following day with renewed venom and spite.

�No love for your Queen, Mary?�

Mary stared directly into Michelle&#8217;s eyes, and Michelle stared back. The lawyer&#8217;s body was no longer the blemish-free beauty it was at the time of her abduction; it bore numerous scars from her unending and feckless rebellion to her new life of sexual servitude.&nbsp; Her wrists, ankles, and thighs were dimpled and discolored from extreme bondage left on far too long.&nbsp; Her areolas were discolored from unending nights of the clamps and fingernails that explored and pinched the most fair and sensitive parts of her body.

Her face, too, bore the signs of her sorrowful life.&nbsp; Though ten months ago she was a seductively slim twenty-something lawyer, her face betrayed the emaciation that wrecked her body.&nbsp;&nbsp; Though her prison mates were both fed as properly as fuck slaves could expect, Mary Gates had been starved countless times in revenge for slight or gross violations of Michelle&#8217;s decrees..&nbsp; Still blond, still thin, still the same perfect light blue eyes, but she was battle worn and a mere glance could reveal that she was unhealthy.

But still, for all her ailments and deficiencies, she continued to rebel.

�Something, wrong, Mary?�

�I&#8217;m going to kill you, you know.�

�Oh?&nbsp; Is that right?�

�You can&#8217;t keep your guard up forever.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What makes you think you&#8217;ll be around long enough?�&nbsp; Michelle moved closer brandished the pole.&nbsp; She loosened the slack on the rope.&nbsp; �Come on, you dumb cunt.&nbsp; Time for another lesson.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No!� she screamed.&nbsp; She ran to the opposite corner of the cell, her back part against the concrete wall, the rest squeezed between two of the steel bars.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Why do you even bother, Mary?&nbsp; Has this shit ever worked?�&nbsp; Michelle laughed and inched closer to the cell, the pole extended in front.&nbsp; She centered herself in front of the gate and slid the tool between the middlemost bars, just like she had done dozens of times before.&nbsp; After the first few tries against the Klint family and the formerly pesky deputy, subduing resistive slaves was a breeze.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;First, get the bulk of the pole through the bars in a position that allows maneuverability and leverage.&nbsp; Then, if necessary, use it to knock them down.&nbsp; Once an opening presents itself, grab the slave&#8217;s neck within the rope and tighten its grip.&nbsp; At very least, they are restrained without any hope of escape, and at the worst, they can be strangled into submission.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mary always required the later.&nbsp; The rope was around her neck and Michelle squeezed tighter and tighter.&nbsp; She could imagine it breaking, once and for all, but she knew that wouldn&#8217;t happen.&nbsp; The piece of meat would go limp long before Michelle could ever muster the strength.&nbsp; The slave struggled back and forth, forcing the pole to clank back and forth against the steel bars, but Michelle&#8217;s grip held.&nbsp; It was a simple matter of muscle mass; the slaves&#8217; diets were far too controlled to ever allow a successful rebellion.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Please�� whispered Mary, the rope squeezing away her last gasps.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle loosened her grip.&nbsp; She had zoned out.&nbsp; Realizing the slave was down, she slid the pole through the bars, unlocked the cage, and grabbed the grip of the pole.&nbsp; Once in the open, there was no difficulty in managing the slave&#8217;s movements.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Michelle had learned in high school, fear of strangulation and suffocation was enough to get a person to do virtually anything.&nbsp; She led Mary to the center of the prison.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Raise your arms into the shackles and lock them.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mary hesitated, then raised her hands above her head and locked them into place in turn.&nbsp; Without being asked, she shook her wrists to show they were tightly bound.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good work, Mary.&nbsp; Now, we have a lot to discuss today.�&nbsp; She slackened the rope and removed it from Mary&#8217;s neck.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Such as?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What we are going to do with you.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Let me go.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle laughed, first softly, then loud and maniacal.&nbsp; She walked to Mary&#8217;s rear and reached around to grab her tits.&nbsp; �Let you go?&nbsp; Now that isn&#8217;t an option.&nbsp; You just have such a wonderful body that there&#8217;s absolutely no way I&#8217;m going to leave you to your own whims.�&nbsp; She leaned her head against Mary&#8217;s shoulder.&nbsp; �Stupid, rebellious women like yourself have no place in this world other than as meat slaves.&nbsp; No, the question is not whether I should set you free, but whether I should keep you all to myself, and in what capacity.�&nbsp; Michelle slid her right hand down Mary&#8217;s smooth chest to her shaven pussy and slipped her middle finger inside the closed slit.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mary shivered in a response Michelle had seen hundreds of times before in her slaves. Sensual touches always brought back memories, and for those that had been victimized endlessly, those memories would undoubtedly be painful.&nbsp; She wondered what Mary was remembering: was it the night she was tied up out in the cold as a dildo buzzed away her cunt?&nbsp; Of the entire week she was used as the cum dumpster for all the men in their BDSM club?&nbsp; Or the dehumanizing walks through the woods on all fours?

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle pushed her finger in deeper.&nbsp; �I could sell you, you know.&nbsp; Your new owners would probably be far crueler than I am; you&#8217;ve never been to the convention.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve never seen the unending streams of modified and enhanced women.&nbsp; I&#8217;m perfectly happy with what you have now,� said Michelle as she squeezed Mary&#8217;s left tit for emphasis, �there are plenty of owners that would see you as a fixer-upper.&nbsp; Bigger tits, wider ass, fatter lips, hell, I&#8217;ve even seen some artificial racial hybrids.&nbsp; Did you ever wonder what it would feel like to be an Asian woman?�&nbsp; Michelle could feel Mary&#8217;s skin turn cold in terror.&nbsp; Never before had Michelle been so blunt with the options for her slave&#8217;s futures, but so far she adored the response.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That doesn&#8217;t even begin to describe the horrors that the flesh can undergo once an owner has them fixed to their liking.&nbsp; You may think Julie and Jodie are as broken as a human soul can get, but you&#8217;d be dead wrong.&nbsp; No, they can still think.&nbsp; They do as I ask.&nbsp; They answer my questions.&nbsp; They show signs of dislike for what I do to them, but they both know better than to defy me.&nbsp; That is what keeps them compliant.&nbsp; But these other women, they are dead on the inside.&nbsp; Pieces of meat that have had every last vestige of humanity and free thought tortured and raped out of them.&nbsp; And you know what?&nbsp; I think it&#8217;s hot.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve never told any of my slaves this before, and I want all of you to listen; that includes you, Jodie, and Julia.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I was a sex slave once.&nbsp; I was abducted by family friends after my parents died and kept locked in a room, raped endlessly by a sadist and paraplegic.&nbsp; It was all about power and money, just as it is now.&nbsp;&nbsp; But, knowing the living hell that it is to be a slave changed me.&nbsp; I know how terrible my actions against you are, but that is what makes it so erotic.&nbsp; The only way I can live in heaven is by forcing hell unto others.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�But, no, this erotic torture chamber isn&#8217;t nearly the worst you can suffer.&nbsp; Not all flesh is worth its weight.&nbsp; Hundreds of women get bought at the convention by packers.&nbsp; Nobody knows exactly what they use these women for, but there are rumors.�&nbsp; She traced shapes on Mary&#8217;s belly with her nails.&nbsp; �Parts.&nbsp; Even the most worthless of human beings have parts that are useful.&nbsp;&nbsp; How much do you think you&#8217;re worth, Mary?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The slave remained silent.&nbsp; Her lower lip quivered.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�So, I ask you, Mary Gates, what do you want me to do?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mary turned her head away, tears forming in her eyes.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Jodie, Julia.&nbsp; I have a question to ask you, too, and I want you to answer openly.&nbsp; I won&#8217;t punish you for speaking your true minds.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The women barely blinked, as if taking Michelle at her word instantly.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�This woman� this filthy piece of trash has defied me at every turn, and her defiance has led to punishments upon all three of you.&nbsp; Do you resent her for her sins?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jodie responded �Yup,� while her mother answered, �Yes,� both answers followed with Michelle&#8217;s title.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Do you want revenge against her?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Both responded &#8216;yes&#8217; without hesitation, their voices seemingly fueled by true hatred.&nbsp; Michelle paused to ponder their wishes before determining a solution.&nbsp; She turned her attention back towards Mary Gate, who still dangled from the ceiling by her wrists, and began Mary&#8217;s transformation

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When all was done, Mary Gates was curled and bound into a fetal position.&nbsp; Her arms and legs lacked any freedom, but her mouth, ass, and cunt were all neatly exposed.&nbsp; Her skin was bare except for the small patches of bondage; she would be in that position for a long time, and any unnecessary bindings could result in complications.&nbsp; She mumbled something incoherently, but Michelle did not care to interpret the worthless noises.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle slipped four fingers beneath the collar and pulled.&nbsp; She opened the cell in the far corner where the two rows of cells intersected and dragged Mary inside.&nbsp; In turn, she let out Jodie and Julie into the same cell and locked it shut.&nbsp; It still had the guest bedroom mattress and linings that were used during Julie&#8217;s accidental pregnancy.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Queen of Sorrow&#8217;s Falls leaned against the bars and gazed upon her three subjects before making her decree.&nbsp; �Rape her.&nbsp; Ravish her.&nbsp; Destroy her.&nbsp; Leave her body alive but destroy her soul, for there is nothing any of us can do while she survives as she is.&nbsp; As long as you do your job, you will be rewarded.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her misery, her hell, will be your heaven.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle returned to the supply chest near the stairs and pulled handfuls of random toys.&nbsp; Everything that looked like it could be used would be used.&nbsp; �Here you go,� she said as she dumped the toys just inside the prison cage that all three now shared.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jodie and Julia both took minutes to stare at their newfound feast.&nbsp; Michelle watched, then prompted them with a simple warning.&nbsp; �Remember this; your survival depends on your ferocity.&nbsp; Rape her or starve to death.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The final ultimatum set the pieces into motion, much to Michelle&#8217;s surprise.&nbsp; Both slaves went directly for the strap-on dildos that had been used against them hundreds of times and slid them on like panties.&nbsp; And then, their assault began.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While Julia attacked her prey with a slow, meticulous approach, Michelle was completely shocked by Jodie&#8217;s aggression.&nbsp; She pounced on the lawyer without hesitation and reamed all three of her holes in turn, with a wild malice that Michelle had never before seen in the short woman of only twenty years old.&nbsp; She pulled out and jammed in to the extremes, to ensure that Mary felt ever bump of the ridged dildos, and the maximum pain as their flesh slapped together.&nbsp; 

As the hours passed, and long after Julia had collapsed in exhaustion, Jodie&#8217;s normal expression of stunned submission faded into one of pure glee.&nbsp; Though there was little physical pleasure to derive from using a strap-on, Michelle had never seen Jodie to be so happy.&nbsp; Perhaps it was a result from her only sexual experiences being Michelle&#8217;s sadism, or perhaps she always had it.&nbsp; Regardless, there was something there.&nbsp; Something that kept Michelle captivated for hours as she fingered herself to Mary&#8217;s destruction.&nbsp; Jodie had it, a pure-blooded malice befitting of a true bondage mistress.&nbsp;&nbsp; There were big things in the girl&#8217;s future.





 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(�The Bus to Slavery�, in which Michelle debuted, takes place between this chapter and the next&nbsp; The following Chapter of this story will resume after those events.)











The Queen of Sorrow&#8217;s Falls
Part Twelve
Suri&#8217;s Last Dance

By Razor7826 (copyright 2008) --&nbsp;&nbsp; The events portrayed in this story in no way represent the views of the author.&nbsp; It is for the entertainment purposes of adults only.


=
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle and Suri lurked in the nighttime woods, waiting for the perfect moment to snatch an unsuspecting prize.&nbsp;&nbsp; Though each had their preferences, any of the dozen women partying in the lake cottage would be worthwhile.&nbsp; High school seniors on the verge of graduation, the prom goers were perfect in their presentation. Fluffy dresses, layers of makeup, and intricate hair were still the common fashion, nearly a decade after Michelle&#8217;s release.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Do you really think we&#8217;ll get a chance?� asked Suri, turning away from the cottage to address her companion.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Of course,� Michelle responded, her eyes continually glancing back at the cottage.&nbsp; �They&#8217;re young and drunk and have absolutely no reason to fear the darkness.&nbsp; Just wait for the balcony to thin out, lurk to the corner, and steal one into the night.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Suri smiled.&nbsp; Michelle knew the plan was sound, even if it did hinge too heavily on luck.&nbsp; They were sufficiently armed and the environment was to their advantage&#8212;even if their prey managed to escape, or they were seen too early, they could just disappear into the forest, their black clothes and generic shoes guaranteed to not leave the slightest useful trace of their presence.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One more couple fled the balcony, the girl leading her date with a grin, followed by another, leaving but a single pair.&nbsp; The man had his girl leaned back against the railing in a gentle embrace, their mouths interlocked.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Something about the sight upset Michelle, but she quickly dismissed the thought.&nbsp; They might not get a second chance, and it was important that she pay attention.&nbsp; And, soon, that attentiveness paid off.&nbsp; The boyfriend retreated back inside, leaving his girlfriend alone, smoking on a cigarette.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Now, this is it,� whispered Michelle.&nbsp; The stealthily moved closer to the cottage, just beyond the cone of light that emanated from the inside party.&nbsp; �Help me,� she said, her voice twisted in faked pain.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The prom girl turned her head towards the sound.&nbsp; �Huh?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Help, please,� said Michelle, doing her best to strain her voice.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The girl dropped her cigarette onto the wooden patio and descended the nearby stairs until twigs crunched under her feet.&nbsp; �Who&#8217;s out there?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m hurt, please��

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Suri and Michelle hid behind two trees, waiting for their prey to reach them.&nbsp; They pounced the moment the clueless girl wandered within grasp.&nbsp; She let out a brief scream before Michelle&#8217;s hand clapped over her mouth, silencing her protests before anyone of her classmates could hear the pained yelp.&nbsp; 

Suri&#8217;s stun gun found a meaty spot just above the girl&#8217;s breast and triggered.&nbsp; A few more shocks ensured her silence by the time they reached the parked van.&nbsp; They tossed her in back, bound her wrists, and gagged her mouth; it was their most efficient capture yet, a satisfying sign of their developing expertise.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Few words passed between the lovers as they made the hour drive back to Serenity Falls.&nbsp; Suri drove, and Michelle spent the time shocking the helpless girl into repeated submission, her eyes staring at the girl&#8217;s face.&nbsp; It was one of youthful beauty, and Michelle could tell that even without the makeup the girl would be a stunner.

The other five slaves only stirred in their cells as lights came on in the basement dungeon, but they quickly returned to their slumbers, the screams and moans of a new prisoner no longer new or special enough to justify the loss of sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Ooooh, I just love that shade of pink!� exclaimed Suri as their new slave&#8217;s dress lit up in the basement lights.&nbsp; �Do we have anything that matches?�&nbsp; Together, they scoured the floor and bins for replacement material that better matched the fluffy pink dress.&nbsp; �Does this look good?� she asked as she held a set of fuzzy pink wrist cuffs, a pink dog collar, and pink ball gag.&nbsp; 

The newest addition to the queen&#8217;s dungeon thrashed and screamed as Suri and Michelle forced her into the new bondage gear.&nbsp; Her arms bent painfully behind her back and pulled tightly by a chain linked to the ceiling.&nbsp; When everything was locked on place, she could only kneel on the basement floor, hunched over with her bottom fully exposed.

�Now, let&#8217;s see,� taunted Michelle as she rolled up the dress&#8217;s bottom.&nbsp; �A garter?&nbsp;&nbsp; Was that for your boyfriend?�

The girl did her best to turn around and meet Michelle&#8217;s eyes with her own before nodding.

�Well, I think I&#8217;ll be taking the honor.�&nbsp; Michelle slid it off of the slave&#8217;s right thigh and slid it up her own.&nbsp; It had been years since she had worn such a frivolity, and it felt strange to have any kind of restriction against her thighs.&nbsp; A brief flash of memory reminded her of those years spent as a slave, so thoroughly entwined in bondage that she could barely move an inch.

�And these stockings?&nbsp; Pretty cute, whatever your name is.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pink panties, even.&nbsp; You really like the color pink, don&#8217;t you?�

The girl nodded again.

Suri laughed and slapped the girl&#8217;s ass, eliciting a sharp yelp.&nbsp; �She has great taste.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle kneeled beside her friend and smiled in return.&nbsp; �Her taste doesn&#8217;t really matter much anymore,� she said as she ran her hand across the shiny pink fabric that comprised the prom dress.&nbsp; Though the bottom was wide and fluffy, the rest of the dress was simple. Shoulder less and strapless, it was completely defined by the curves of the girl&#8217;s body.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What was the slave&#8217;s name?&nbsp; Michelle didn&#8217;t know, but didn&#8217;t particularly care.&nbsp; �Now, let&#8217;s see what else she has.�&nbsp; She slid one hand beneath the right cup off the dress and popped her breast out of place.&nbsp; It was young and perky, barely held into place by the material. �Very nice.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Suri Mehta and Michelle von Houten continued the rest of the girl&#8217;s induction to slavery without exchanging any words, their meanings and intent completely portrayed by the subtleties of their actions.&nbsp; They were completely in tune with each other; having attacked the unwilling flesh of their slaves in tandem hundreds of times in the past.&nbsp; It had been nearly three years since they had met each other; how many women had they disgraced and broken together?&nbsp; She began to recall their last three years together.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jodie Klint, the red-headed high school reporter, was taken and dominated months before Suri had entered the picture, but the rest of the residents of Michelle&#8217;s basement dungeon were introduced by both mistresses.

Deputy Eliza Mishkin, an officer of the law that threatened to bust open the entire culture of slavery. 

Julia Klint, the mother of Jodie, an incessant nag that had to be silenced.&nbsp; 

Attorney Mary Gates, taken and destroyed so Michelle and her friends could tighten their grip on Serenity Falls.&nbsp; 

Lucy and Amy Song, former allies that grew too careless.&nbsp; 

Sister Mary Gambon, a woman of the cloth purchased at auction so Michelle could vent her unresolved anger.

Rachel DeSoto, a wealthy and pampered forty-year old millionaire that stumbled into the BDSM convention with her husband.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All of the women that entered the care of Michelle and Suri were destroyed, fast, efficiently, and cruelly.&nbsp; Through degradation, violence, and bondage, each of those women were forced into submission.&nbsp; Now none of them dare defy their Queen&#8217;s command.&nbsp; They were loyal subjects to their very core.&nbsp; It only took a single look at the newest captive for Michelle to know she would grow to be a loyal slave, just like her predecessors.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle huddled close to the slave and grabbed both of her tits, kneading and toying them with practiced expertise. The girl squealed into her ball gag with the exact tone Michelle loved so very much.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From behind, Suri pierced the girl with a double-dildo strap-on.&nbsp; The pink panties stretched between her pink stockings, and her ass cheeks rippled with each forceful impact.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle looked to Suri, who grinned with satisfaction as she deflowered both of the young girl&#8217;s holes.&nbsp; Then she turned to look at the captive.&nbsp; Tears formed in her eyes and slid down her cheeks as she stared forward at her fellow slaves, all lined up in their own cells.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Captivated by the slave&#8217;s expressions, Michelle pulled away and watched for hours.&nbsp; As Suri pierced her holes over and over with dildos of varying shapes and sizes, her face slowly lost its life.&nbsp; Her teeth unclenched against the ball gag, her tears stopped, and her eyes no longer darted from side to side.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was breaking, and fast.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hours passed, and Michelle was long since exhausted.&nbsp; She reclined on the red leather couch and gazed at the ongoing defilement with pride.&nbsp; Another young slave added to the stables, stolen into the night without a trace.&nbsp; Everything was executed perfectly, as usual.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The pet hung limply by her wrists as Suri knelt behind her wearing a strap on dildo, ramming the girl&#8217;s ass.&nbsp; The new pet no longer cried, too shocked to display any real emotional response.&nbsp; The flesh of her bottom rippled with each slap of Suri&#8217;s thighs.&nbsp; The pink dog collar pulled tight against her neck as Suri pulled her closer for each thrust, the adjoining leash taught with tension.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Suri&#8217;s stamina never ceased to amaze Michelle.&nbsp; It was only one of the many reasons why she loved her.&nbsp; Her humor, cheerfulness, and gorgeous toned body had Michelle from that first tearful apology three years ago.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Neither of them understood how little time remained for their love. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The sun was beginning to rise by the time Michelle and Suri let their slave have her first moments of rest.&nbsp; Even sleeping and sprawled on the floor, her arms and legs pulled close to her body in a position of defense, as if she were capable of fending off demands of her new owners.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Suri gathered her clothes, strewn across the floor from the previous night&#8217;s foreplay.&nbsp; �She&#8217;s bleeding pretty badly.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll need more medical supplies.�&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michelle looked at the slave again, and noticed the pool of lubricant and blood that spilled from her bottom.&nbsp; She grabbed Suri&#8217;s hand and pulled her closer.&nbsp; �A kiss for the road?�&nbsp; They embraced in a brief moment before Suri&#8217;s hand slipped away from her own.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Indian woman wandered up the stairs, leaving Michelle to pass out on the couch&#8212;a deserved rest after a job well done.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Suri Mehta never returned from that simple errand. Just after noon on that mid-May Sunday, Toby spotted her light green coupe, pulled over onto the shoulder of a lonely forest route on the outskirts of town, nowhere near the store they normally bought supplies at.&nbsp; Her keys were still in the ignition and her purse rested unperturbed in the passenger&#8217;s seat.&nbsp; There were no signs of a struggle.

The searches turned up nothing-- not a shoeprint or broken twig to be found anywhere near her car, only a set of tire tracks in the mud just in front of her car.&nbsp; As the circumstances of Suri&#8217;s disappearance came in, Michelle&#8217;s stomach sunk with dread.&nbsp; It was exactly like the story of the countless women that disappear each year without a trace, plucked from their daily lives and consumed by the underground world of sexual slavery.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No� it can&#8217;t be,� muttered Michelle as she clenched Suri&#8217;s favorite bathrobe against her chest, wishing for the warm embrace of her first true love.&nbsp; �No��

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Somewhere in the world, Suri Mehta was beginning a new life of suffering and servitude, an unfortunate fate for a woman so full of life and vigor.&nbsp; The mere thought of such horrors devastated Michelle
