Synopsis: Ethan is accepted at a prestigious riding stable. A ponyboy storyTea Biscuit 
Ethan stood anxiously beside his mother while the older doctor went over her
  clipboard with the younger doctor. The younger doctor or whatever she was wasn't
  more than a year or two older than Ethan's eighteen years. Ethan was a strapping
  young male. At two meters tall, he was a head taller than any of the women
  in the room and topping a hundred kilos likely weighed more than any two of
  them together. His large, muscular frame didn't carry an ounce of fat. Though
  he may have towered physically over everyone else in the room, he certainly
  didn't feel very dominant over anyone. He wanted this so desperately and for
  so long. Now he was so close. 
His mother looked at him and smiled warmly. She had waited so long for this
  day and wasn't very good at hiding her apprehension. She had chosen her sperm
  donor carefully. She had carried his pregnancy, under her heart as they say,
  and given birth to this marvelous specimen of manhood. Her fingers were crossed
  tightly for luck. Involuntarily, her hands tapped fretfully on her thighs.
  This was her son's big chance. This was her big chance. She had always been
  a fan. She had envied those tiny jockeys so. Her home was arrayed with racing
  paraphernalia. She had encouraged Ethan for as long as he could walk. Maybe
  she had encouraged him before he could walk when she got him his first Pony
  haircut. Most who applied never even got this far. Whether chosen or not, she
  was so proud of him. 
The air was cold on Ethan's bare skin. Some of the tests had been rather strenuous,
  even for a healthy young man in Ethan's excellent condition. Standing in a
  room now with fully dressed women, he felt odd wearing only his skivvies. Once
  upon a time, Ethan had learned, an ordinary-sized man might intimidate a dozen
  adult women simply by threatening to expose his male parts. Ethan thought himself
  very unlikely to overawe anyone, despite his unique size and strength. He wanted
  so desperately to be chosen. 
�Great,� said Dr. Ponsonby, the older doctor, tapping her knuckles solidly
  on the clipboard. �This wonderful letter from your friend Beth is very compelling.� 
Beth had been Ethan's jockey for his two years in the saddle division of the
  racing program at Cady-Stanton High. 
�Ethan, please come with me,� the doctor continued. She gestured for Ms. Everest,
  Ethan's mother, to remain behind. 
Ethan entered the small examination room. The only furniture was a bare examining
  table. The neatly framed picture on the wall showed the photo finish of famous
  Arlington Stakes, saddle division, from two years past. Ethan had watched the
  race on TV himself. No one remembered the names of the jockeys, but everyone
  knew that Hailey's Comet had beaten Wind Song by a nose. Hailey's Comet represented
  Rothesay Stables and Wind Song represented Highgate Stables, whose rivalry
  went back for decades. Everyone said that Hailey's Comet was getting old. Wind
  Song won the following year after Comet retired. Ethan himself was fully large
  enough for the saddle division and still growing. He would be proud to wear
  the colors of either stable. 
�Ethan?� said Dr. Ponsonby, when the younger doctor entered and closed the
  door, �you'll have to remove your shorts.� 
Ethan's face twisted into a wry grin. He blushed and wearing only his skivvies,
  the blush colored his entire body. 
�Ethan, don't be embarrassed,� said the younger doctor. �I've worked on a
  ranch and on a ranch, none of the Ponies wear any clothes. All the Ponies who
  ran at Arlington, ran naked. Their bodies were decorated in stable colors� 
She was right, of course. In his high school meets, Ethan had always worn
  shorts. Now things would be different. If he were somehow accepted at the Bar
  None Ranch, he would receive the best Pony training in the world but he would
  have to follow the rules. If he did well, he might be accepted at one of the
  stables after a couple of years, maybe even Highgate or Rothesay Stables. He
  peeled off his shorts and stepped out of them awkwardly. 
�Turn and face me,� the young doctor said. 
Ethan turned to face her and saw the nametag on her white coat, �Hannah Olivera,
  assistant trainer,� not �doctor.� 
She approached him then stopped abruptly as if intimidated by his size in
  the small examining room. She smiled wryly at her edginess. �Okay, big fellow,
  put your hands on your head � and just keep them there.� She quickly regained
  her usual authority. 
Ethan complied. Hannah pulled on an examination glove and Ethan knew what
  was coming. He tried staring at the ceiling and then tried to calm his growing
  anxiety by closing his eyes. He couldn't see Hannah, but her perfume filled
  his head. Her thick, soft dark hair brushed across his belly, just before she
  took his penis in her hand. Ethan needed all of his willpower not to pull away. 
�Not clipped and not a problem,� Hannah noted. Ponies were always circumcised
  in the stable in order to facilitate good hygiene. She cupped his scrotum gently,
  then examined each testicle. �Cough� 
Ethan coughed. 
�Again. Okay, no hernia. Now turn around and put your hands on the table.� 
Ethan complied. He heard what sounded like a rude noise. Hannah placed the
  three-quarters empty tube of lubricant on the table. Next, Ethan felt her bare
  warm hand on his bare ass. He turned a bit and saw the darker complexion of
  her hand against his paler skin. He looked away and then he felt something
  very cold. 
�Just try to relax,� Hannah said. 
How could a guy relax, when he had a chance to be accepted at the Bar None
  Ranch and his whole future lay gleaming before him. 
II
�Congratulations!� Beth offered with honest enthusiasm. Her open smiled illuminated
  her attractive features. Ethan was a natural. She had been his jockey through
  his second two years in high school. They had won League together twice and
  placed well in the District and in the Sectionals, proudly carrying Cady Stanton
  High School colors. Cady Stanton had a great racing program in both the sulky
  and saddle divisions and a proud tradition. Once upon a time, the most athletic
  boys vied to participate in a barbaric activity � a �game� called �football,� not
  even a sport. Now that violent game was outlawed and best young males channeled
  their athletic proclivities in other directions. Ethan had wanted this for
  as long as she could remember. He had always worn a Pony haircut. 
Others were too often playacting poseurs, whatever their physical gifts. A
  jockey placed herself in almost intimate contact with her Pony. Up in the saddle,
  her thighs straddling his neck and her private parts pressed up against him,
  she could do little to protect herself. Too often boys �played� Pony, maneuvering
  artfully to cop a feel from an unsuspecting girl. Away from the track where
  she was better able to protect herself, she would find his molestations beyond
  repulsive. 
By far, Ethan was the best of the Ponies she had ridden. He had the large
  frame and ample strength to carry her with ease. With no reservations, he placed
  that strength totally in her service, trusting her completely and holding back
  nothing. On the track, he was simply her Pony, with no double entendres or
  hidden agendas. He had the great heart to match his great physical strength
  and endurance. 
Ethan's house was filled with racing mementos and souvenirs. His mother was
  a dedicated fan. Pictures of history's greatest Ponies hung on every wall.
  All were totally naked as required in the Open Division and their casual display
  of male apparatus evoked no special notice. Typically, the ring that pierced
  the glans of their penises was attached to a navel ring, lifting their member
  out form between their muscular thighs and exposing their ball sacs underneath.
  Often their genitals were brightly painted to show off their stables' colors.
  Only a few books were evident and all dealt with racing themes. Racing magazines
  were everywhere. 
�Hey, Ethan, congratulations!� Amy, Beth's girlfriend, was quite a contrast
  to her smaller friend. Beth was petite. Amy was tall and long legged. She had
  done quite well for herself and their school on the women's track and basketball
  teams. Everyone called tall Amy and petite Beth the odd couple. 
�I can't believe it! I've been accepted at the Bar None. They have the greatest
  trainers and facilities and the highest percentage of graduates who go on to
  the major Pony stables.� 
�They only take the best � like my big bro',� added Ashley, Ethan's younger
  sister, with obvious pride. She was the same age as Beth. �You know other little
  boys want to be a fireman or a cowboy. Ethan has always wanted to be a Pony.� 
�Maybe because mom gave me a saddle for my seventh birthday and I gave you
  Pony rides around the neighborhood.� 
Beth was very happy for her much larger cohort. He had placed his great strength
  and great heart totally in her service and had given her whatever she had asked
  of him. He had carried her to some thrilling wins and breathtaking finishes,
  win, lose, or draw. Beth firmly believed that it wasn't whether you won or
  lost, the triumph was in the struggle with yourself. Victory over others was
  merely an added treat. In reality, her Ethan was still a growing boy. He had
  yet to come into his full strength. 
She inspected the untarnished joy on his smiling face for some sign of doubt,
  of reservation. Did he really know what he was getting himself into? He wasn't
  a high school boy anymore. She had ridden him with a bridle but no reining
  rods. The Bar None would introduce him to the whole nasty kit, dowels placed
  securely in his ear canals. She had ridden with no more than unknotted length
  of rope for a quirt and no spurs. In the open division, jockeys used spurs
  and leather riding crops. Did he know that once he signed the papers, carefully
  drafted by the best legal consultants, he gave over full legal rights? They
  would snip his vocal cords and brand him. They would give him a new name. That
  was routine. He would be bought and sold, like livestock. Hell, he would be
  livestock. They could cut off his damned balls, if they chose, and even euthanize
  him, just as they saw fit. Sometimes, she thought that these practices were
  cruel and inhumane. However, these practices were customary and nothing unusual.
  She knew that Ponies signed up voluntarily and the supply was plentiful. No
  one was coerced, and she knew that their families received substantial checks. 
You always see the glorious champions on TV and in the newspapers, but what
  happens to the also-rans? Would her poor Ethan spend his life giving little
  girls rides around the track in an amusement park or posing for birthday party
  pictures? 
�You should see the signing bonus old Ethan earned,� Ashley boasted. �And
  that's just the first installment. If old Ethan does well, we get another big
  check when he graduates and gets his first placement. 
A good jockey does more than climb up on her Pony's back and urge him to run
  faster. A good jockey knows exactly what her mount can do and can't do. She
  knows just how fast he can run and for how long. A good jockey earns her Pony's
  complete and total trust. Her challenge is to take him to his very limit, beyond
  his doubts and fears. Beth searched Ethan's beaming face and said nothing. 
�Hey,� Ashley smiled. �I bet you guys have never seen old Ethan in all his
  Pony glory. 
�Sis, what'da you mean?� Ethan asked, puzzled. 
III 
Ethan and his mother packed a modest bag and returned to the Dr. Posonby's
  office. Dr. Posonby and Hannah were waiting. 
Ms. Everest was gushing with happiness. �You did it! You did it, Ethan! Thank
  you so very, very much, Dr. Ponsonby. Thank you, Hannah! Everyone said that
  I shouldn't bother with a son. Well, I bothered all right � for eighteen years,
  I bothered. Wait till I tell his sister! He's my Ethan.� 
Dr. Ponsonby smiled. She could only wait for Ms. Everest to tire. It was an
  occasion to celebrate. Many applied but only a few were chosen. She only examined
  the few who got this far. Most got no further. Ethan was an outstanding specimen.
  Dealing with Ms. Everest's exuberance was much more pleasant than comforting
  a rejection. �We still need a few signatures. You know, of course, all Ponies
  require minor surgery. Ethan here requires a circumcision. There are a few
  more things.� 
All males in the stable were circumcised to facilitate hygiene. Their nasal
  septa were pierced and ringed. That much was obvious to any who followed racing
  at the track or on TV. Only true enthusiasts knew that their vocal cords were
  routinely snipped. Males had no reason to talk; Ponies only need listen. 
Ms. Everest looked at Ethan. �Are you certain you want this, dear?� 
Ethan nodded, yes. 
�Okay, where do I sign? She signed once where Hannah showed her and then once
  more. �You won't castrate  him?� she whispered and looked at her son
  with sudden real concern. � Will you? � 
Ethan was startled by his mother's sudden change in mood. He was never much
  good at big words and he hated when people used words he didn't understand. 
�Oh, my goodness, no,� the doctor answered. Everyone knew that intact males
  were innately lazy and prone to violence and most mounts ended up gelded before
  they were retired. However, the important decision to geld a Pony or leave
  him intact was usually made once one could better define his potential. 
Ms. Everest signed. 
Dr. Ponsonby held up the bonus check where Ms. Everest and Ethan might see
  it. 
�Okay now,� she said, �Ethan dear, you signed here and here.� 
Ethan took the pen and signed with a flourish. �Now sis has her money for
  college!� 
�May Ashley, his little sister, and I visit our Ethan at the Bar None Ranch?
  I've heard it's beautiful.� 
�No, no � not for six full months. We can't allow any distractions from Ethan's
  training. We all want him to be a champion. Don't we?� 
�Okay, let's get this show on the road,� said Hannah reaching for her car
  keys. �Ethan, come with me.� 
Ethan hugged his mother one more time and started to follow Hannah. He stopped
  abruptly. �Hey! I forgot my bag in Mom's car. Let me go back and get it.� 
Hannah shook her head. �You really needn't bother. We'll give you everything
  you need on the ranch.� 
Ethan shrugged his shoulders. He clutched Beth's box of tea biscuits and followed
  Hannah to her car. 
�We're going to stop at the infirmary first.� 
Hannah opened the right rear passenger door. Ethan thought this bit of reverse
  gallantry odd, but slipped the back seat. She slammed it behind him. The car
  pulled smoothly away form the curb. He looked in the front seat and saw a tangle
  of chains on the floor. �What's that,� he asked Hannah. 
�Oh that,' she answered, �shackles. Takes some pretty strong shackles to restrain
  a big fellow like yourself.� 
Ethan shook his head doubtfully. Eager to begin his new life, he never considered
  that this would be his last opportunity to sit clothed in an automobile. 
IV 
At first, Ethan saw little of the Bar None Ranch. They passed through the
  gate and headed right to the infirmary. The buildings were freshly painted
  and the grounds neatly manicured. Ethan looked to the left and right and tried
  to catch sight of other Ponies. He saw none. 
Ethan met Josh, Mike, and Tyler at the infirmary. They were new Ponies too.
  A girl, who seemed to be in charge, told them to try to get a good night's
  rest and put them to bed. They would have their little �procedures� in the
  morning and should have nothing to eat or drink after midnight. She made a
  quick inspection and found Ethan's stash of tea biscuits. Indulgently, she
  allowed the boys to share them, but cautioned them to eat or drink nothing
  after midnight. 
They stayed up all night talking. Each was proud to have been chosen for the
  Bar None Ranch. They were the best of the best. They swapped stories and found
  that they had run against each other. Boys had few opportunities to fraternize
  at the races and little chance to share experiences. Ethan tried to tally up
  his wins and losses. In the end, he estimated that he had won more than he
  lost. 
�Hey, do you guys know what they're going to do to us?� Josh asked. 
�They're going to make me into a champion Pony!� answered Tyler. 
�I don't want to break your hearts, ass wipes, but they're going to make me
  a champion. You guys are future dog meat!� quipped Mike. 
�Well, I heard they're going to cut the ends off our cocks,� offered Josh. 
�You pecker challenged fuckers'll have to pee like girls, sitting down. I
  have cock enough to spare,� said Tyler. 
�Not true!� said Josh, with more hope than authority. �Say, is it too late
  to change my mind?� 
�I heard they're going to remove our voice boxes.� contributed Ethan. �This
  might be our last chance to talk in our entire lives!� He wanted so desperately
  to be a champion that he considered any price a bargain. 
Josh's anxiety only increased. �I think I want to change my mind, really.
  It may be just fine for you guys, but I want to call this thing off.� He was
  talking louder and louder. 
The door cracked open and the girl returned. �Hey, seems like a racket in
  here.� 
�Yeah! That asshole can't stop gibbering,� said Tyler. He pointed to Josh. 
�When they snip his vocal cords, he'll stop talking soon enough,� Ethan offered. 
�Sorry,� apologized Josh. �I've been thinking about things and I really want
  to leave. Can I call my Mom? 
�You're chickening out?� the girl asked. �Really? Do you know how many guy
  competed for your spot? You're absolutely sure? 
Josh looked at Mike, Tyler, and Ethan, searching for support. They stared
  back and said nothing. Their faces were blank. Josh swallowed once hard. �Yep,
  I guess. I just want to go home.� 
�Well, come with me. Right now. Anybody else?� Tyler, Mike, and Ethan all
  shook their heads and watched Josh just get up and follow her from the room. 
�So long suckers!� he sneered as he left. The door clicked shut behind him. 
At dawn, another girl hustled Ethan from bed. He must have finally fallen
  asleep. Tyler and Mike were still sleeping. He looked for Josh, but then remembered
  that Josh had left. 
Ethan had thought that she was a nurse although she didn't wear a starchy
  white uniform. She wore a tee shirt and low hung jeans over leather boots.
  She ushered him into a bathroom and told him to use the facilities. Ethan waited
  for her to leave, but she just stood there. 
�Okay, big fellow, just do your business. You don't look exactly like a shy
  and blushing maiden.� 
�Can you give a guy some privacy?� Ethan asked, then remembered to add a �please.� He
  was usually very polite. 
�Don't mind me.� She touched a curious rod-like device at her belt. �Think
  of me as your mother.� 
Ethan's mother hadn't watched him use the facilities for some years. Ethan
  shrugged his shoulders and hunched around the urinal, trying to preserve what
  privacy he could, and pee'd. 
She led him from there to the shower. A guy had to take off his clothes to
  take a shower. Again, she supervised the procedure, reminding him to wash everywhere.
  When he stepped from the shower, she handed him a warm, fluffy towel. 
Once dry, she got him up a gurney and strapped him in. Ethan watched a parade
  of fluorescent lights and ceiling tiles and the gurney rattled quickly down
  the hall. An automatic door opened and the gurney came to rest next to a curtain. 
�Ethan � you're Ethan, right?� asked another female in surgical scrubs. She
  seemed a few years older. 
Ethan nodded. 
�Well, hold out your hand and I'm going to give you a little shot.� 
�Just a little one?� Ethan asked, his smile betraying his anxiety. He hated
  shots. 
�Just a little one. Here, it's not too bad.� The needle slipped into his vein. �Now
  count backwards from twenty � slowly � twenty � nineteen.� She infused some
  medicine slowly 
Ethan was always eager to please and he tried his best. Math really wasn't
  his best subject. He felt so very warm and safe. 
Then he woke up. He was groggy and his headache pounded. His throat burned.
  Try as he might, the world still stubbornly refused to come into focus. The
  light in the room was dim except fro a red flashing �Exit� sign that flashed
  almost painfully. He tried to fit his roiling memories into a cohesive whole. 
Where was he now? He remembered the Bar None Ranch. He remembered the clinic.
  Where were Josh, Tyler, and Mike? Josh, he remembered, had chickened out and
  gone home. He was on some sort of hospital gurney in an antiseptic-smelling
  hospital-like room. He tried to raise his arms and discovered that he was strapped
  down. His head hurt and his nose hurt too. What the fuck had happened to him?
  He tried to lift his head from the thin foam mattress. Something cold pressed
  against his upper lip. A metal ring passed through his nose � like the ring
  worn by champion Ponies! 
Thoughts and images raced around his brain and never stopped. He tried to
  hold onto the more pleasant ones. Memories and fantasies appeared and disappeared
  - all seemed equally real or unreal. Mercifully, he just fell back to sleep. 
He woke again and the light was blinding. He was still strapped to the gurney
  but his mind was clearer. He was still naked and shivering. His throat burned
  dully. His upper lip was sore. He felt a scab when he touched it with his tongue.
  His penis burned too. He had to pee terribly. He lifted his head a few inches
  and saw that his penis was circumcised and ringed. The ring matched his nose. 
Suddenly, a female figure appeared beside him � an attractive girl about his
  age, wearing blue jeans and a tank top. She looked athletic; her belly was
  flat. She was a blonde and she looked athletic. �My prince awakes!� she said,
  sounding mostly bored. �Do you have to pee?� 
Ethan opened his mouth to answer, but he could only make a braying sound.
  Something was wrong with his throat and then he remembered. A Pony needed to
  listen but he needn't talk. Many complained of male chatter. 
The girl pressed firmly on his belly, just above his pubic bone. His distress
  increased and he brayed again in desperation. 
She laughed. �I'll take that for a yes.� She didn't seem at all nonplussed
  by his nudity. Mischievously, she ran her finger down the inside of his thigh.
  She lifted his cock gently and pointed him into a fat-necked bottle. �Two choices.
  You can pee in the bottle or I can cath you. It's up to you,� she concluded
  matter of fact. 
Ethan did nothing until she showed him the catheter. Humiliated, Ethan peed
  into the proffered bottle and the red color startled him. 
�Don't worry, the girl chuckled, seeing his concern. �That's just pyridium � pain
  medicine - so it doesn't burn.� She let him finish and shook off the last drops. �Time
  to get off that stretcher.� Her amused tone hadn't changed. 
Ethan tried to speak again, but did no better this time. 
�I really don't want any trouble.� She clipped a lead to his nose ring and
  undid the belt across his middle, freeing his arms. �Now sit up.� Ethan swung
  his legs over the side and slowly sat up. �Take it slow. Easy now.� 
Ethan felt light-headed. She led him down the hallway and through double doors
  from the infirmary to the stable. She steadied him gently. She noticed that
  he accepted her help readily. This was always the first step. They stopped
  in front of a full-length mirror. Ethan looked himself over. He towered over
  the smaller woman. Shoulder to shoulder he was twice as broad as she. His nose
  and penis were ringed. With his Pony haircut, he looked just like a champion
  Pony. 
�Look at this.� She lifted Ethan's upper lip and showed him where a registration
  number had been tattooed on its underside. 
Wow, Ethan thought. I'm a real Pony now! He tried to speak but this throat
  only burned. He was unable to make any intelligible sound. 
She ushered him into a stall and showed him a thin mattress where he might
  lie down. She nodded her approval. This one had the makings of a great Pony.
  In the morning, his poor cock would be swollen and sore. She closed the door
  as she left. 
Alone and locked in his stall, Ethan fell asleep again. When he awoke, his
  penis burned. His throat hurt and he could not talk. He was hungry and thirsty.
  He could not remember when he last had eaten or drunk. The stalls' door could
  not be opened from the inside. He stared through the small window into the
  dim stable and tried to find some sign of Mike or Tyler. He wondered what Josh
  might be doing now. Maybe he was at home laughing at them. 
V 
Ethan was roused at dawn and led to the yard outside. He saw Mike and Tyler.
  Each sported a Pony haircut like his. Each had had his nose and penis pierced
  and ringed. Unable to speak, they waved their greeting. Today they were real
  Ponies. 
Unexpectedly, Josh appeared. A girl dragged him from the stable by a lead
  fastened to his nose ring. He fought her step by step. Then he tried to grab
  the lead with his hands. She jabbed him sharply with that rod-like device the
  women all seemed to carry. His body seemed to raise clear of the ground and
  then fall in a heap of twitching arms and legs. 
She gave him thirty seconds to recover. Moaning, he rose shakily to his hands
  and knees. She yanked on his lead. He regained his feet unsteadily and followed
  her much more docilely. 
Ethan, Mike, and Tyler looked at each other. Ethan tried to speak, but his
  throat burned and no intelligible sound emerged from his mouth. He promised
  himself to do what he could to avoid the rod. 
The days had a certain routine. In the morning, Ethan was taken to the squatter
  toilets with the other Ponies. He had quickly gotten used to being naked. All
  the Ponies were naked on the ranch. Attending to his private business in plain
  sight of the trainers, grooms and exercise girls was a greater test. However,
  they watched the Ponies and chatted among themselves and no one seemed really
  to care. Weights were recorded daily and the new Ponies ran for an hour before
  their morning meal. 
Often, several of the exercise girls accompanied them on the more seasoned
  Ponies. Ethan envied the Ponies their duty. He looked forward to his opportunity
  to carry a rider. 
The Ponies ran for two hour's twice a day and worked on upper body strength
  for two hours a day. Eating and grooming consumed an hour a day. Seventeen
  hours a day, Ethan was locked in his stall. The Ponies weren't encouraged to
  fraternize. Ethan might have been bored or lonely, if he hadn't been constantly
  on the edge of exhaustion. Ethan, always exhausted from his workout, slept
  soundly. He saw Mike, Josh, and Tyler around but none of them could speak.
  Ethan was always hungry and ate the bland but nourishing stable diet heartily. 
The Ponies were groomed each night before sleep. The Ponies might have done
  more for their own grooming, but the trainers felt that the grooming accustomed
  the sometimes skittish Ponies to being touched by others. The grooms teased
  and chattered as two grooms worked on two Ponies. At first, Ethan forgot himself
  and tried to speak. His altered throat was unable to produce an intelligible
  sound. The grooms found his efforts comical or simply ignored him. Soon he
  stopped even trying and accommodated himself to his new life. 
This part is just like high school, Ethan thought as he rounded the practice
  yard, but more so. He, Mike, Josh, and Tyler ran in a circle. Meaghan, their
  trainer stood in the center and watched them run. She monitored their pace.
  Every minute or so, she blasted her whistle and the Pony trailing the pack
  raced to the front. 
Some parts were quite different than high school. The Ponies were stark naked
  except for their gear. When Meaghan thought a Pony was slacking, she wielded
  her lungeing whip with precise accuracy and substantial power. The whip's first
  bite startled Ethan and he lurched forward out his daydream. He quickly learned
  to respect the whip and the hand that wielded it. 
He had likely been on the ranch a month before a trainer and an exercise girl
  took him aside. Keeping track of time on the ranch was difficult. No one thought
  it important for the Ponies to know the day and time. She carried a bridle
  and saddle. Ethan was happy to hear the command, �Mount!� that Beth had used
  it so often. He had begun to doubt that he would ever hear it again. He dropped
  his left knee to the ground. This was why he had chosen to be a Pony. 
The exercise girl deftly saddled and bridled him, much as Beth had done. However,
  she didn't step up on his muscular right thigh and straddle his thick neck.
  The trainer grasped his bridle in both hands and looked him right in the eye. 
�Steady now boy,� she said, �steady.� 
The other woman adjusted his bridle slightly and then inserted dowels, first
  in one ear and then one in the other ear. She secured the rods carefully. The
  trainer released his bridle and stepped back, hands on hips. The exercise girl
  grabbed his bridle and stepped up on his right thigh only then. She swung her
  left leg over Ethan's thick neck and settled herself in the saddle. Once she
  had planted her feet in the stirrups, she ordered the male, �Up!� 
Ethan stood smartly. He had been waiting for this moment for weeks or perhaps
  for his entire life. Then he felt something different. His rider's heels brushed
  his flanks. Her heels boasted stubby blunted spurs. Beth had never ridden him
  with spurs. High school allowed only leather heals. Ethan's enthusiasm was
  now tinged with a hint of fear. 
�G'dy-up!� 
Ethan went forward at a walk. He was a spirited, but well-behaved mount. His
  awareness of the spurs made him even more responsive to his rider's wishes.
  He felt her spurs and picked up his pace. Running, he felt more comfortable.
  She touched him with his spurs again and he increased his pace. He maintained
  a rapid pace with ease. 
�Run boy, run!� she urged, hunched over in the saddle. He had done quite well
  and took pride in his strength. 
He felt her warm breath on his neck and heard her soft words of encouragement.
  Her approval was exhilarating. He ran joyfully. His rider was no burden to
  his welling strength. Her breath was warm on his neck. Hunched over, her soft
  breast pressed once or twice against the back of his head. Her perfume filled
  his head. He knew that he had been born for this! 
�Whoa!� she said unexpectedly. He felt a subtle pressure on his reining rods.
  Drunk with motion and arrogant of his strength, he ignored the command and
  ran. �Whoa, now!� Still he ran. He was in no mood to stop now. 
Abruptly, pain exploded in his head as she pulled firmly on the reining rods
  resting in is sensitive ear canals. Ethan grimaced and twisted his head trying
  to relieve the pressure but his rider kept her hands steady on the rods. Frightened
  and breathless, he came quickly to a stop. 
She stroked his face gently. �Just pay attention, big fella, � it doesn't
  have to be so bad.� 
Ethan learned quickly. Carrying a rider, he was alert to the slightest pressure
  on the rods as well as to the touch of her spurs. He followed direction smartly
  and basked in sincere and generous praise. He had strength and heart enough
  for any rider. 
One day, the girl who had first greeted him at the infirmary took him out
  for a ride. �I was looking for you,� she told him as she put on his saddle
  and tack. �I've brought you a special treat.� 
Ethan watched her hand dip into her pocket. After the bland stable diet, anything
  sweet or spicy was a treat. Her hand emerged with a packet of tea biscuits. �Only
  one now,� she laughed. He ate it greedily from her hand as she took care to
  avoid his teeth. She had found them among his things that he left back at the
  infirmary. 
On the trail, he gave her all she asked. He answered her spurs and ran until
  she was giddy with exhilaration. She was breathless with excitement when she
  finally brought him back to the stable. He responded smartly to the subtlest
  pressure on the control rods. 
On signal, he knelt so that she might dismount. Kneeling, he was still as
  tall she. �Thanks for a great ride!� She rubbed his neck fondly. She reached
  into her pocket and retrieved a second tea biscuit. 
�Hey Alyssa, what are you feeding that Pony?� Meaghan asked. 
�Tea biscuits.� Alyssa answered. 
�Tea biscuits? Well, did he give you a good ride?� 
�The best!� 
�You know � he needs still needs a name. We've got four new one who need names.
  Three have their Pony names, Tippecanoe, Iron Mike, and that difficult one,
  Mister Fletcher. Let's call this guy, Tea Biscuit!� 
VI 
The stables at Steinham College impressed Beth. Gifts from wealthy alumnae
  had kept the coffers full and anyone could see that the money had been well
  spent. 
Beth's resume impressed Ms. Emily Norton, the riding mistress greatly. Emily
  seemed to know everything about Ponies 
Her profuse praise made Beth blush. �I've always had an outstanding mount,
  Ms. Norton. They say that it's ninety-five percent Pony and five percent jockey.� 
�Give yourself a bit of credit. Your Pony was lucky to have you.� 
Beth thought about Ethan. She wondered how he had done at the Bar None Ranch.
  He had been growing still and adding muscle. He had yet to reach his prime. 
�We do more trail riding than racing here but I really could use someone with
  your experience here,� she added on a more serious note. �However, all our
  riders have their own mounts. Half of them haven't the foggiest idea how to
  care for them. I've hired a couple of girls with some experience to help out
  as grooms. Sometime it seems the only way a woman from a middle class family
  can get a quality mount is give birth to him herself! Hey, I can hook you up
  through the Steinham work-study program. We'll call you an assistant trainer.� She
  looked again at Beth's long list of trophies and ribbons. �Say,� she smiled; �we'll
  call you an associate trainer. Pay's the same, unfortunately.� 
Beth met Caitlin O'Connor, the chief trainer and took an immediate liking
  to the young woman. Laurie Norwich and Alyssa Westfold were the hired grooms.
  The stable housed about 30 mounts in individual stalls. The students took turns
  attending to morning chores. Ten girls cared for three mounts each in two shifts.
  Three mounts might be brought to the feeding trough together. 
The mounts got along well enough as most of them had been gelded. Intact males
  were usually fed individually to avoid conflict. Intact males were notorious
  for their impulsivity, laziness and alacrity for violence. Intact males were
  jealous and quarrelsome as they competed frantically and even violently for
  their rider's attention and favor. Elite riders found intact males more spirited
  and treasured the special bond a woman might forge with her mount. Many chose
  to put up with their drawbacks. For the rest, a gelding served adequately with
  less trouble. 
Most girls came to ride after school, to attend to their evening chores, and
  finally to bed the beasts down for the night. 
Stalled individually in clean stalls, the mount appeared well cared groomed,
  if not a bit under-worked or over-fed. The school kept only a beaten up gelding
  named Lucky, and a stallion named Mississippi Gambler or Gambler for short.
  The rest of the mounts belonged to the individual students. 
Beginning student were allowed to ride with control rods but no spurs or quirt.
  Intermediate rides added stubby blunted spurs. Advanced riders added a leather
  riding quirt. 
As an elite rider, Beth wore rowelled spurs that jingled as walked. The merest
  touch on her mount's flanks communicated her urgent demand for speed with no
  ambiguity. She loved the way they looked on her heels. She wished that she
  might afford better boots. 
In general, Beth liked the other girls. None had had the benefit of as solid
  a program as she. They were good-hearted bunch and eager to learn. They didn't
  hold their large difference in wealth against her. 
Daphne de Winter was a singular exception. She considered herself an elite
  rider and she certainly looked the part in her expensive designer outfits.
  Her Pony, a gelding called Noblesse Oblige, was a well-constructed and loyal
  beast. Her gear was the best. She lacked only the special empathy required
  of a great rider and any perception of her deficiency. An elite rider knows
  her mount completely. She takes him to his limit and no further. In his passionate
  yearning to please, a Pony will exert himself beyond the abilities of his body
  to sustain him. He will rip sinew and splinter bone. He will run beyond his
  heart and lung's capacity to supply oxygen to his straining muscles. Clumsy
  riders have damaged valuable Ponies. Ponies have collapsed dead when driven
  too hard. Daphne de Winter resented anyone who had what she lacked. 
�Race around the oval!� Julia challenged, riding her gelding Bigfoot. Before
  Daphne could answer, Julia had jabbed her mount with her heels and the big
  gelding was flying down the track. 
For an instant, Daphne thought about protesting the whole thing as unfair.
  Julia had hardly given her a chance, but she knew that her mount was far superior
  and she might teach the upstart girl a lesson. Julia was the best student in
  French and that was one more reason to hate her. She set off in pursuit on
  the half-mile track. A crowd gathered to watch and cheer on their favorite. 
Noblesse Oblige gained steadily. Daphne went to her lash very early in the
  backstretch. She used it sparingly, though, just so her mount wouldn't lose
  focus. She gained steadily as they came into the far turn, about three hundred
  yards from the finish, but then panicked. She applied the lash for all she
  was worth and Noblesse Oblige surged under her. He gave all that she asked,
  all that he could. 
Julia kept her nerve and held Bigfoot to his fast but steady pace. About one
  hundred yards from the finish, Noblesse Oblige pulled even and then pulled
  a bit ahead. Now Julia went to her lash and Bigfoot' found some yet untapped
  reservoir of strength in his great heart and sprinted down the home stretch. 
Daphne tried to answer but despite his desire to serve, her mount was exhausted.
  His arms and legs pumped ferociously but he seemed to move in slow motion.
  He crossed the finish line a body's length behind Bigfoot and collapsed. 
Daphne's leaped clear and landed on the hard packed cinders, abrading her
  hands. She tore her white jodhpurs but was otherwise unhurt. Julia continued
  down the track, unaware of what had happened. People gathered to see to Daphne
  and once assured she was all right, saw to her mount. 
Noblesse Oblige writhed on the ground and moaned. Dirt stuck to his sweat
  covered skin and caked on the oozing streaks left by Daphne's lash. His moaning
  and thrashing stopped for an instant and then abruptly started again. 
Beth ran onto the track with first aid kit. Wary of his size and strength,
  she approached the male warily. She shuddered to see the splintered end of
  his tibia protruding through his torn skin. He didn't even move when she poked
  him with the morphine syringe. 
Caitlin came out to the track. She saw briefly to Daphne, who just stood in
  a daze. 
Julia Michaels dismounted and walked back with her Bigfoot. �Daphne, I'm so
  sorry!� she said, holding back tears. 
After the morphine, Noblesse Oblige quieted. Caitlin took one look at his
  injury and retrieved the keys from her belt. �Beth, go get my revolver. The
  bullets are in the drawer on the right.� There wasn't much to be done. 
Beth set off at a run. Not much had changed when she returned, except the
  crowd had grown. People talked quietly among themselves. Daphne stared at her
  mount and picked the grass and dirt from her hair. 
Caitlin loaded the pistol. �Daphne, you do the honors. He's your mount.� 
�I really don't know how,� Daphne protested. �You know, it wasn't my fault.� All
  eyes were on her and her torn and soiled outfit. 
�I never said it was your fault,� Caitlin answered safely. �Just flick off
  the safety and pull the trigger.� Caitlin deftly loaded the empty pistol. 
�I can't!� Daphne insisted. 
Caitlin shook her head and looked to Beth. �You, up for the dirty job?� 
Beth nodded and took the pistol. She needed three tries at the safety. She
  had never done this before. She shrugged her shoulders and sighed. There's
  a first time for everything, she thought. The creature needn't suffer any more. 
Caitlin squatted by the male's head and stroked his face gently. 
Beth knelt with one knee to the ground and held the pistol about a foot from
  the back of the male's head. She took a deep breath and squeezed the trigger. 
The pistol barked and Noblesse Oblige lay quiet. Beth stood unsteadily. She
  set the safety and returned the pistol to Caitlin who carefully removed the
  unused cartridges. 
�My mother's going to buy me a new and even better Pony. I'll just have to
  pass my French midterm.� Daphne bragged. �This one was really no good for anything.� 
�I'm so sorry about your Pony,� Julia Michaels commiserated. Julia was in
  Dapne's French class. �I'll do anything I can to help.� 
VII
�Hey, do you think we can find a quiet corner someplace any place?� pleaded
  Allie in a hushed whisper. �Vickie, I want you so bad.� The crowded dormitories
  of the Steinham campus offered few opportunities for privacy. 
�This is a stable and a stable has stalls,� answered Vickie. �Last time I
  was here that stall over there was empty.� The stable was dark except for the
  dim red light of the emergency exit signs. 
�This one?� Allie asked and swung open the door. 
The stall was not empty. In the dim red light of the exit signs, a human figure
  could vaguely be seen. The form of a young woman knelt on hands and knees on
  a low table, her bottom facing the door. 
�Who is she? What is she?� Vickie asked. She touched her life-like skin. 
�A mannequin. Look she's naked and you can see her girl parts,' said Allie
  in wonder. �What's she doing in a stable?� Allie thought to probe her gaping
  hole, but then thought better of it. �Her hair's so life-like too. 
�You don't think?� asked Vickie, her imagination racing. �Let's try another
  stall. I can't believe it� 
�Try that one,� Allie suggested 
�You mean the one with �Tea Biscuit' on the name plate?� 
Vickie undid the latch and the door swung open revealing the massive shape
  of a large male, sleeping on his side.� 
�Uh-oh! Now what do we do?� asked Allie uncertainly. 
�Just find me a lead somewhere. There's one hanging on a peg on the wall � over
  there.� Vickie knelt beside the sleeping male. Allie handed her the lead and
  she deftly clipped one end to his nose ring. Gripping the lead firmly in one
  hand, she pressed her other hand against the male's shoulder. �Up � up � big
  fella!� she urged. Given the disparity in their sizes, she hardly moved the
  creature at all. 
Neither of the women felt the least unsettled by their close proximity to
  a large powerful male, His naked body and blatantly apparent male parts posed
  no mystery and evoked no fear. Neither doubted her mastery over the male. Rousing
  a stable attendant was more of a threat than the male. 
Tea Biscuit, once known as Ethan, stirred and gradually awoke in the dim light.
  He felt a small warm hand on his broad shoulder and heard the soft but insistent
  female voice urging him to stand. He smelled the perfumed scents. He awoke
  confused and, but fundamental to his training was his need to obey. He scrambled
  clumsily to his feet. 
Vickie gave him room to stand but kept her firm grip on is lead. She led him
  to the back of the stall. He followed passively without resistance. She looped
  the lead through the stay set high on wall, pulled it tight until his nose
  was a few centimeters from the wall and secured it. �There, big fella, that'll
  keep you.� She turned her attention to Allie. 
Allie sat on the thin mat, still warm from Tea Biscuit's large body. She looked
  up and smiled. She had waited so long and waiting was difficult. She had already
  pulled off her top. �Hey, come and join me; the mattress is still warm. 
Leaning on Tea Biscuit's large frame, Vickie slipped off her shoes and peeled
  down her tight jeans. �Do you think Tea Biscuit did anything disgusting on
  the mattress? 
Tea Biscuit heard the sounds of their lovemaking. He tried to turn his head
  but the lead gave him no slack. He could see nothing. The two women, involved
  with her partner's pleasure and her own, spared him no attention. Tea Biscuit
  could feel their arousal. He could taste their arousal. He pressed himself
  against the rough cinder block wall and moaned his desire. 
�We'd better get out of here,� Allie offered reluctantly, quite a while later.
  The predawn light had burst into a brilliant dawn. She began to search for
  her clothes. �Did you see my shoes?� 
Vickie straightened her disheveled hair, took a great deep breath, and joined
  the search. �Look at that!� She said and stood naked as the male. She pointed
  at the sizable male apparatus standing erect between his thick muscular thighs. �Did
  you ever wonder what he might feel like?� She shaped her hand to cup his fat
  ball sac but then hesitated. 
Allie saw the proud Rothesay stable brand displayed on his brawny bare buttock.
  She peered between his powerfully built thighs. She saw the coarse hairs on
  his bulging ball sac. The skin of her palm itched just to look at him. �No,
  not really,� She wrinkled her nose with obvious distaste. 
Vickie pulled back her hand. �Some people have intimate relations with these
  creatures,� she marveled. 
VIII
�You won't believe Daphne's new Pony!� Caitlin told Beth. �A really beauty � a
  stallion named Tea Biscuit.� The name was odd. Intact males were rare in the
  stable also. 
�Daphne must have passed her French midterm. Julia sure worked hard with her.� Beth
  answered before she remembered that she once knew someone who loved tea biscuits. 
Beth passed two girls sneaking out of the stable. They gave her a big, too
  cheerful greeting. Beth saw their disheveled clothes and hair. �Young love,� she
  muttered to herself and rolled her eyes. Steinham College did offer few opportunities
  for privacy. 
She saw the new name on the plaque, �Tea Biscuit.� She opened the stall door
  and saw the large well-built male standing up against the back wall. He was
  about her Ethan's height but appeared even bulkier. His sturdy thighs, buttocks,
  back and shoulders appeared even more powerful. Muscle hung in thick plates
  on his large frame. She gave him a cheerful �Good morning!� 
Tea Biscuit heard her voice and recognized her immediately. Two years had
  passed and much had changed. The male had even begun to think of himself as
  Tea Biscuit and now his deeply suppressed Ethan-identity had erupted to the
  surface. He sniffed the air and recognized Beth's favorite perfume. He pulled
  violently against the lead. He tried to turn his head but the tether had no
  slack. He tried to speak and only braying noises emerged. 
Beth sensed the Pony's mounting agitation. His arms flailed. His powerful
  legs stomped and kicked. �Easy, now. Easy, boy.� She approached him warily
  but sensed that physical contact might ease his disquiet. She placed her hand
  softly on his shoulder. �Easy, now. Easy, boy. Hi, Ethan. Son of a pig, long
  time, no see!� She marveled at the utter serendipity. 
He quieted immediately at her touch. He tried to press back against her hand
  to increase his contact. 
Beth ran her fingers over the well-healed script �R� brand of Rothesay Stables. 
Momentarily unsure of her control of the beast, Beth took a deep breath and
  unfastened his lead. She looked up at the familiar features under his nose
  ring. �Mount,� she directed. Her Ethan dropped promptly to one knee. Now their
  heights were about the same. She studied him briefly. She had inspected many
  Ponies and he was as fine a specimen as any she had seen. She put a hand on
  either side of his head and studied his eyes. He stared back intently. �Just
  wait �til I tell Amy!� 
Ethan looked at Beth. Her smile hadn't changed. Her voice hadn't changed but
  he saw the quirt hanging at her belt. He saw the rowelled spurs at the heels
  of her well-worn boots. 
�Hey Beth, �said Daphne, �like my new Pony? Mommy bought him for me.� 
�This here Tea Biscuit is an old friend of mine,� answered Beth. �He was my
  Pony in high school. He carried me in some great races.� 
�Well, Mom said he cost a pretty penny. A handful of pennies, really.� 
�I'm certain he'll be worth it. Let me take him for a ride?� 
Daphne had changed after the tragedy with Noblesse Oblige. She and Beth bridled
  and saddled him. Beth swung into the saddle and urged him, �Up!� 
Beth's burden was nothing compared to Ethan's size and strength. His conditioning
  had been thorough and arduous. He stood excited and nearly out of control. 
Beth sensed his impatience and growing agitation. She was eager too. She dragged
  her spurs lightly over his flanks and quickly reminded him who was in command. 
She set him down the track at an easy pace. She remembered their great races
  together. 
Ethan thought about his past too. His mind wandered. Beth's hand touched the
  control rod and brought him very quickly to the present. 
Beth felt him respond to her lightest touch and laughed. She nudged him with
  her spurs and he surged powerfully forward. Just wait �til I tell Amy, she
  thought and grinned broadly. 
IX
Amy looked up uncertainly. She saw Beth already mounted on Lucky. She saw
  Daphne de Winter mounted on Caligula and Julia Michaels mounted on her Big
  Foot. All stared her right back at her. �I'm not certain that this is a good
  idea. In fact, I'm very certain that this isn't a good idea.� Amy had no love
  of riding. She was larger than most of the girls who rode and not all Ponies
  could carry her comfortably. She had only agreed to come along because Beth
  loved so much to ride and all agreed that she could ride Ethan or Tea biscuit
  as he was now called. 
Saddled and bridled, Tea Biscuit waited for her to step up on his thigh and
  swing into the saddle. 
Julia Michaels shook her head sadly. The poorest rider had demanded the best
  Pony of the four. 
Beth sat quite comfortably in her saddle and implored Amy with her eyes. 
Amy saw Beth and rallied her flagging spirits. She simply had little love
  for the male creatures except perhaps for Beth's Tea Biscuit. She stepped up
  on Tea Biscuit's thick thigh and swung her left leg over his muscular neck.
  She settled herself awkwardly in the saddle and set her long legs in the stirrups.
  She grasped his control rods firmly. Amy took a great deep breath. �Up!� she
  commanded. 
Noting happened for a full second. Amy began to doubt her ability to command
  the large male. Then Tea Biscuit rose quickly to his full height. Amy hung
  on for dear life. She scrambled to regain her balance. Beth, Julia, and Daphne
  were heading up the trail toward the Red Lake Reservoir. 
Julia spurred her mount and he surged forward. Daphne followed close behind.
  Life had changed for Daphne since the tragedy with Noblesse Oblige and changed
  for the better. She conquered French with Julia's help. Somehow or other, she
  had learned how to listen. Daphne had friends and was finally doing well in
  school. Three years zipped by and everyone wondered where the time had gone.
  Soon, Amy and Beth were off to the city. Daphne would be going to graduate
  school. Julia juggled two job offers. 
Amy still sat there, perched in Tea Biscuit's saddle. Beth waited for Amy.
  Lucky, her mount seemed much more patient than she. 
�Go, Tea Biscuit. Go!� she urged, sounding a bit frantic. Tea Biscuit just
  stood there. The reigning rods made hearing difficult. Tea Biscuit did not
  move. Intact males tended to be lazy, impulsive, and prone to violence. Amy's
  frustration mounted. �Tea Biscuit, please!� she pleaded. �Pretty please.� 
Beth sighed and shook her head. �Kick him, Amy. Just kick him. Don't argue
  with him.� 
Amy kicked him but tentatively. Her rubber heels carried no spurs and Tea
  Biscuit barely felt them. 
�Kick him, Amy. Hard!� Beth called. Amy kicked him harder and her mount ambled
  ahead. Amy struggled to keep her balance in the high saddle. 
The women talked and laughed on the steep trail up to the Reservoir. Julia
  rode in front on Big Foot and Daphne followed her on Caligula. Amy followed
  on Tea Biscuit and Beth brought up the rear on Lucky and kept a close eye on
  Amy and Tea Biscuit. 
Tea Biscuit envied Lucky for his precious burden. He wanted to carry Beth
  on his shoulders, just like in the old days. Although he was Daphne's Pony,
  he had had many opportunities to carry Beth and sometimes, it was just like
  in the old days. He delighted in every flash of her smile and every touch of
  her hand, no matter how inadvertent. He relished every sound she uttered and
  the mere sound of her voice. 
Tea Biscuit kept looking back at Beth whenever Amy gave him enough slack on
  his reining rods. He slowed down, trying to get closer to her, trying to catch
  some whiff of her perfume. Amy was too tentative a rider to keep him strictly
  to task. 
He felt the pressure of Amy's thighs on his strong shoulders through her coarse
  jeans. Her weight was nothing to him despite the challenging grade of the steep
  trail. He felt the warmth of her body and her warm breath. He inhaled the scent
  of her perfume. 
Tea Biscuit envied Amy for her relationship with Beth. He had been totally
  oblivious in high school when Beth was his jockey. He had had years now to
  think about things in the long quiet nights in his stall. Loss of the ability
  to speak had not deprived him of his ability to think. He had been alone while
  Amy was with Beth. Today, they would lock him in his stall and Amy would go
  home with Beth. 
The women dismounted. Saddles and bridles were stripped from the Ponies. Beth
  removed Tea Biscuit's gear and Tea Biscuit was grateful for the attention.
  The Ponies were given water and hobbled in the shade. 
Julia and Daphne spread out the picnic. Beth and Amy stripped to their undies
  and swam out to the raft. 
Tea Biscuit pulled against his lead and tried to watch Beth disrobe. He may
  have become accustomed to being naked himself. His nudity now evoked no comment
  and little interest. Ponies were always naked. Once upon a time, a woman's
  female parts were called her �shame.� Now a woman's female part were celebrated
  as the source of pleasure and the origin of life, but not so casually flaunted. 
Beth was fond of Tea Biscuit. She certainly had no sexual interest in the
  male. Her preferences were known and unambiguous. 
Tea Biscuit may have been unable to put a name on his powerful feelings. He
  was endlessly thrilled by the soft curve of a female breast, the full ripeness
  of a female ass, or the secret place between two shapely thighs. His frustrated
  urges bordered on the desperate. Unable to speak, he moaned his desperate longing.
  No one paid him any attention. 
Julia looked out at Beth and Amy cavorting on the raft. She pointed. �Yuck!� she
  said. �I hate public displays of affection.� 

Daphne looked at the couple and smiled, a little bit embarrassed herself.
  The day had been wonderful. Daphne was filled with gratitude for her good friends. �Julia,
  thank you for all the help in French. And Beth, thank you too. Thank you for
  your help that terrible day. Thank you for your trust and encouragement in
  the difficult time that followed. Thank you for Tea Biscuit. I wish I knew
  how to make this up to you,� she told them later after they had returned the
  Ponies to the stable. 
X 
Caitlin supervised. Beth and Daphne groomed Tea Biscuit with even more care
  than usual. Tea Biscuit was confused when Beth removed the ring that pierced
  the glans of his penis. Amy just watched. 
The dummy, named Marianne, looked utterly ridiculous to Beth, a plastic life-sized
  female on her hands and knees with her round female butt high in the air and
  her female parts blatantly exposed. However, her skin and hair felt real enough
  and the electric blanket had made her feel life warm and life-like. Emily slipped
  the sterile plastic sleeve into her always-welcoming plastic vagina and splashed
  her with a musky scent. 
Beth looked at the dummy and then at Amy. Amy's anxious expression reflected
  Beth's ambiguity. Beth snorted. �Don't worry, Amy. As cute as Marianne is,
  you're still my girl.� 
�Did someone bring her soiled panties?� Caitlin asked. 
Amy looked at Beth. Beth looked at Daphne and Daphne looked at Amy. 
Beth shrugged her shoulders. �I can help,� she volunteered and disappeared
  into the rest room. She returned a few moments later, panties in hand. 
Tea Biscuit was even more confused when Daphne slipped a hood over his head
  and cuffed his wrists. He didn't recall that he had done anything wrong. No
  one seemed at all angry with him and their dreaded cattle prods hung untouched
  at their belts. 
Daphne held the lead attached to his nose ring. Amy held his right arm and
  Beth held his left arm. Caitlin trailed as they led him stumbling to the rarely
  used stall. 

�Tea Biscuit, meet Marianne,� announced Caitlin. �She's a real stag-hag slut.� �Stag-hag� was
  demeaning jargon for a female who preferred sex with males. 
Tea Biscuit couldn't see anything. He felt Marianne's warm buttocks against
  his naked thighs. He leaned forward and nuzzled her hair and inhaled her scent.
  Something stirred inside him. 
�Fuck her, Tea Biscuit fuck her good,� Daphne urged. 
Tea Biscuit felt a warm hand rest softly on his flank. 
�She wants you,� Beth whispered in his ear. �She really wants you - so bad.� 
Caitlin pressed the warm panties against Tea Biscuit's face. 
The scent filled Tea Biscuit's head. He wanted Beth and she was so close.
  In his imagination, he saw her naked at the Reservoir. Beth whispered something
  unintelligible and her warm breath seared his face. He wanted her so desperately.
  He pictured the soft curve of her breasts and her tight sassy female ass. He
  imagined the warm, wet place hidden between her thighs. He wanted her so. In
  his fervid mind, she wanted him too. He was rampant. Without volition, he thrust
  against Marianne's always accepting body. He slid right into her vaginal opening.
  He thrust again and again, the intense sensations erupting from his sex driving
  his rhythmic thrusting. 
Caitlin pulled on a latex glove. She reached between his thighs and gently
  cupped his balls. �That's it, fuck her good,� she implored. His breaths came
  in gasps and grunts. 
�Fuck her good. Oh, she wants it so bad,� Amy pleaded. Perspiration made Tea
  Biscuit's naked body gleam in the soft light. His strong thighs pounded Marianne's
  firm plastic ass. With his powerful assault, Marianne shook on her sturdy anchors. 
Caitlin slid her index finger forward and pressed against the under side of
  Tea Biscuit's cock. He groaned as if in pain and erupted. Gobs of sperm gushed
  into the waiting receptacle. Tea Biscuit threw himself forward onto Marianne's
  back. He rested and gasped to catch his breath. Exhausted, every muscle was
  limp. 
Caitlin wasn't quite finished yet. She jammed two fingers up his muscular
  ass, plunging past his anal sphincter. Tea Biscuit groaned and tried weakly
  to twist away. Undeterred, Caitlin found his prostate gland and massaged it
  vigorously � forcing a second orgasm and a third, emptying him of sperm. He
  was totally spent. His fourth orgasm was totally dry and unproductive, leaving
  him with a dull ache in his balls. 
Beth rubbed the back of Tea Bsicuit's neck. His skin was hot and sweaty to
  her touch. �Do you think he's in love with little Marianne?� she quipped brightly. 
Tea Biscuit was crying when they pried him off Marianne and led him stumbling
  back to his stall. 
�Good night, baby,� Beth comforted him before locking the door of the stall
  behind her. �I'll bring you a biscuit tomorrow. 
XI 
Beth and Amy had the best seats in the house, if they had only sat down. They
  stood in the Owners' Box three rows back, right at the starting line when Abby,
  Beth's daughter, coaxed her nervous mount into the gate. Amy's Pride loved
  to run, but the noise and tumult of race day always evoked considerable anxiety.
  While Beth had been Abby's birth mother, the two women had raised her together
  and she called them each �Mom.� Their daughter's accomplishments filled them
  both with pride. The petite Beth had been a jockey too in her younger years.
  She remembered her races up on Ethan, her favorite mount. She guessed that
  in the bad old days she and Ethan might even have been sweethearts, given the
  crushing social pressures. He might have been the dashing captain of the football
  team, now banned, and she a preppie cheerleader. She still thought of him fondly,
  though the thought of intimate relations with a male made her queasy like some
  perverted fantasy of the patriarchal age. 
Abby looked great up on Amy's Pride in her red in gold silks. Her hair was
  tied back in a neat ponytail under her racing helmet. Amy's Pride was a magnificent
  creature, saddled and bridled like all the Ponies. Like all the Ponies, the
  ring at the end of his sex was attached to his navel ring, lifting his penis
  from between his muscular thighs and exposing his fat scrotum underneath. His
  left side of his penis and scrotum were painted a deep red and the right side
  a brilliant gold, showing proudly the stable colors. 
Neither had taken a seat when the gate fell and Abby guided her mount skillfully
  through the crowded field. They grabbed each other's hands, when their daughter
  saw a sliver of daylight and spurred her mount forward. He answered her challenge
  with all of his considerable strength and burst ahead of the talented field.
  His long legs reached out forcefully and devoured the distance. Going into
  the first turn of the half-mile oval, he was already in the lead by a head.
  Abby hunched over in her saddle and urge him on. His powerful strides pounded
  the hard packed track. Abby had trained him mercilessly and his arduous conditioning
  served him well in the backstretch. 
Abby had known she wanted to be a jockey like her birth mother since Mommy
  Amy had given her piggyback rides as a toddler. She had hounded her brother
  for rides relentlessly and good-natured fellow that he is, he had usually indulged
  her. 
A hot sun beat down on the track. The crowd roared. Amy's Pride felt the warmth
  of Abby's breath on his neck. Her hands rested gently but firmly on his control
  rods, reminding him who commanded and who obeyed, despite their easy camaraderie.
  Sweat poured from his body. The sun beat down strongly. Exertion had transmuted
  her usual subtly perfumed scent into something magical. He felt her fierce
  desire to win. Her competitive spirit was steadfast and unyielding. He knew
  her as thoroughly as she knew him. He desperately wanted to please her. 
However, Amy's Pride was not the only talented Pony in the field. Wing Song
  II matched him stride for stride. The Pony and his jockey carried the blue
  and silver of High Gate stables. His male parts were painted in blue and white
  stripes to match his jockey's colors. He too was a marvelous specimen, thoroughly
  trained and skillfully ridden. He too had a courageous spirit and a huge desire
  to win. He was a champion and the son of champions. Amy's Pride heard Wind
  Song II's pounding stride and heard his heaving breaths. 
Wind Song II was also suffused with a competitive spirit. His jockey went
  to her lash, coming out of the final turn and Abby answered ferociously. Victory
  was within her reach and she would not lose it now. 
Amy and Beth held hands and watched breathlessly. Their grips on each other's
  hand became almost painful. Their eyes were fixed on the track. 
Amy's Pride rose to the challenge and tapped some previously unknown reservoir
  of strength and will. He was a magnificent creature. The other Ponies were
  also outstanding physical specimens. He had trained hard. Abby had worked him
  diligently, showing him that yet more strength always remained if the spirit
  was willing, no matter how his lungs and body screamed in protest. The other
  Ponies had trained hard also. However, none shared the life-long bond he shared
  with his jockey. Wind Song pulled even for an instant coming out of the last
  turn into the home stretch but Amy's Pride surged ahead at the finish. 
The crowd cheered. Arms raised in triumph, Abby guided her mount on his victory
  lap. Towering over the shorter Beth, Amy bent down and embraced her lover.
  They kissed. Their kiss and the contact of their bodies reverberated with all
  the love and pleasure they had shared in their long years together. Frustrated
  with awkwardness of their posture, Beth stepped up on a chair and for once
  looked down on Amy and they kissed again. 
Madison raced down from the stands to congratulate her girlfriend Abby. Abby
  and her mount had already taken their hard-won place in the Winner's Circle.
  Amy's Pride knelt in the dismount position. Reporters and photographers mobbed
  Abby, leaving Madison alone with the male. He stared at the ground. His powerful
  chest heaved while he tried to catch his breath. His depilated skin was streaked
  and torn with the evidence of Abby's quirt. 
Abby's love of racing had always puzzled Madison. Abby doted so on her mount
  that sometimes Madison found herself jealous of the silly beast. His ass bore
  Abby's mark indelibly. Abby had branded him herself. She had shown Madison
  the brand and told her how nervous she had been. Her hand was shaking but her
  mothers had insisted that she brand the creature herself. There's a special
  bond, they told her, between a Pony and the girl who brands him. Somewhere,
  she had found the strength to calm her trembling and place a clean brand. 
Madison found his physical size intimidating though she knew that he had been
  thoroughly trained. Any violence against women would not be tolerated. A dangerous
  male would not be re-trained; rather he would be put down. Kneeling, he was
  still almost as tall as she. She viewed the creature ambiguously. He made Abby
  so happy but Madison found him at best hygienically challenged. Dripping as
  he was now with perspiration, he reeked of a distinctly unpleasant musky aroma.
  His bathroom habits were at best suspect. She found his blatant display of
  his grotesque male paraphernalia repellent. Images of him forcing himself into
  the hidden places of a woman's body made her physically ill. However, she took
  a certain pride in her paint job. 
Still, he had made Abby so obviously happy, she couldn't help but feel a modicum
  of compassion. �Hey, Pride,� she smiled, �great run!� She tussled his hair
  fondly. 
Abby saw Madison and broke away from the crowd. �Madison, we did it!� she
  crowed exuberantly. She and Madison embraced joyfully. Madison loved to make
  Abby orgasm. Abby threw her arm around Pride's thick muscular neck. �We did
  it!� She planted a quick messy kiss on the side of his face. Pride turned his
  head toward her, but she was already hugging and kissing Madison again. 
Madison wasn't certain that she wanted to kiss Abby after Abby had kissed
  the male. However, she surrendered to the moment and kissed her friend warmly.
  Abby looked so hot in her racing silks. She was so vital in her triumph. The
  hot pressure of their bodies and the mixing of the fragrances of their scents
  were too thrilling for fastidiousness to prevail for long. 
�Did you bring it?� Abby asked. 
Madison reached in her pocket and found the apple. She handed it to Abby. 
The apple immediately gained Pride's attention, despite his fatigue. He loved
  anything sweet after the bland diet in the stable. The apple was so red and
  shiny and fragrant. 
The apple looked great to Abby too. She almost took a first bite but remembered
  her manners. She offered the apple to Madison who took a great bite. The sweet
  aromatic juices ran over her lips and chin. Next, Abby took her bite. Arm and
  arm, Abby and Madison fed Pride the remainder, careful to avoid his eager teeth.
  He ate greedily, consuming even the seeds and core. 
Still hand in hand, Amy and Beth reached the Winner's Circle. Hugs and kisses
  around, they congratulated their daughter and shared their joy with her dear
  friend, Madison. Beth grabbed Pride's bridle in both hands and kissed him warmly
  on the forehead. �Great run, Pride!� she said and studied his face. 
Prides' vocal cords had been altered and he was unable to answer her with
  words. He answered her with his eyes. Amy had been his birth mother and Amy
  and Beth had raised him together with his younger sister Abby. When he had
  still been able to speak, he had called them both �Mommy.� Happiness illuminated
  Beth's face and gave him great joy. A tear rolled down his cheek. 
Gently, Beth brushed away his tear. She was so proud of him. Amy had been
  his birth mother. Beth had charted the temperatures and wielded the turkey-baster
  with her own hands. Beth herself had coaxed the sperm from Ethan, his sire.
  Amy had just stood there and watched. She and Amy were so proud of both their
  children. Suddenly, she remembered she had brought him a special treat, a tea
  biscuit like Ethan loved.
