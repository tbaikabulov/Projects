�������� &quot;Penny's Cage.&quot; 

&nbsp;

�In the warm, stuffy darkness of the Shed,
Penny stirred on her bed of straw, drowsily feeling its familiar prickly
scratchiness against her bare skin. She reluctantly opened her eyes to see the
first, faint hints of dawn turn the skylights far above her a dim grey. She had
enjoyed another of the occasional long and death-like sleeps which came upon
her at regular intervals. Sitting up, she raised a front paw and swept back
from her face the curtain of tangled, matted hair which had fallen over her
eyes. For a moment she wondered when one of her 'Keepers', as she now mentally
referred to them, would notice the length of her hair and cut it short as they
had once before; or at least tie it back in a pony-tail for her.

&nbsp;

�By now there was enough light for her to make
her way on all-fours to the corner where her shallow litter-box lay to squat
and empty her bladder, and, after relieving herself, she walked, still on
all-fours, the tiny distance over to the curved steel trough in which lay the
usual inch of murky water.

&nbsp;

�Penny lowered her head and drank neatly and
efficiently, remembering as she did so her first days in this place. Then she
had quenched her thirst by dipping one of her maimed and shapeless hands into
the water and licking it off. Since then she had learnt to lap like a dog, aided by a tongue which seemed
somehow to be longer and thinner than it had been before she was Taken. She
frowned at the thought; she couldn't remember, but surely she hadn't always
been able to lick out her nostrils with her tongue? Raising her head, she shook
the water from the long hair which had fallen into the trough as she drank.

&nbsp;

�Slaking her thirst had its usual effect of
increasing her hunger. She glanced up at the nearest skylight and saw that it
would be several hours before she was fed her only meal of the day. But Penny
was by now used to the hunger which crept upon her only two hours after she'd
eaten and which increased steadily until she was fed again. Anyway, she thought
hopefully, the Keepers would be passing in and out of the Shed shortly, and
some of them might bring her scraps from their morning meals.

&nbsp;

�Penny rose to her feet and stood upright for
the first time that morning to walk the few feet to the bars of her cage.
Pressing her body against the hard, cool steel, she stared out into the dim
interior of the Shed as the light steadily grew, her mind going over yet again
the circumstances of her Taking, and their subsequence. 

&nbsp;

�Her abduction had been simple, swift and
unnoticed. Penny had been walking down a familiar deserted suburban street in
her native town when the car had pulled up silently and smoothly alongside her.
Glancing down, Penny saw the worried, smiling face of a motherly-looking
middle-aged woman looking up at her, a street-map in her hand. Penny remembered
stooping to examine the proffered map, then she'd heard a faint hiss as if of
escaping gas, and then nothing until she'd woken up in the cage where she'd
been kept ever since. Absently she wondered how long she had been here. With no
way of recording the passage of each day, Penny had no knowledge how much time
had passed. But her hair, which had been fashionably short when she was Taken,
had once grown so long that one of the Keepers had shorn it, and now it was as long again. 

&nbsp;

�Penny thought back to her awakening on that
first day, of her surprise and outrage at finding herself naked in a cage, then
of her horror and despair on seeing her maimed hands. People, both male and
female, some in farm-workers' clothing and some in the white coats of
scientists and technicians, were walking past her cage on all sides. The cage
stood in the centre of the floor of a large
building, and Penny had crouched sobbing in the middle of the cage as the men
and woman passed by on either side at random, occasionally sparing her an
indifferent glance as if she was a caged animal. 

&nbsp;

�It took only a few days for Penny to realise dully that a caged animal was exactly what the people
of this place thought of her as; she even discovered that they'd put a collar
around her neck. Exploring it as best she could with her now useless hands,
she'd decided that she wore an ordinary leather dog-collar � it even had a
name-disc dangling from its 'D' ring � and it was fastened by a simple buckle
and tongue in the traditional manner; a simple method of securing it that she
was no more able to circumvent than could the dog it was meant for. She had
never seen her collar, of course, but she'd become so used it that she was able
to forget she was wearing for long periods.

&nbsp;

�Even the door of her cage � a door which was
usually only opened when her litter-box was emptied and refilled � was fastened
by a simple arrangement of sliding bolts. In the early days Penny had spent
long hours fumbling with them, sobbing with frustration at the sheer
uselessness of the blunt, thick-skinned, insensitive clubs of flesh that the
Keepers had made of her hands.

&nbsp;

�In those early days she'd tried to plead with
her captors, discovering in the process that the only sounds she could now make
were soft and breathy whines and whimpers. But the people outside would either
ignore her anguish, or, worse, they would stop and stare at her with
indifference. But now Penny no longer tried to open the door of her cage, nor
to make hopeless appeals for release. It had become only too apparent that the
people outside really did consider her a caged animal. They certainly treated
her like an animal in a Zoo, caring for her simple needs with an insultingly
casual indifference. There was no need to give her water � somehow they'd
arranged that her trough held a constant and unvarying inch of lukewarm liquid
� but they fed her from a bucket on scraps and leftovers, tipping them into her
trough and walking away. And what food! At first she'd had to force herself to
eat the mess jumbled together in her trough; the remains of apple pies mixed
with baked beans and bacon rinds, gritty potato peelings and carrot scrapings,
stale bread crusts and soured milk, so much resembling the pig-swill to which
she'd contributed the remains of her own meals at school. But now Penny gobbled
it down eagerly to� satisfy the aching
void in her stomach.

&nbsp;

�And yet they weren't cruel to her, they didn't
mock her helplessness or stare at her nakedness; in fact, Penny could find no
reason whatever why she been abducted and kept here. She had come to believe
that this place was some sort of farm where scientific work of some kind was
carried out, but, as far as she knew, no experiments of any kind had been
carried out on her, and although sometimes she was aware upon waking that she'd
enjoyed a sleep of infinite deepness �like the one she'd just woken from
--� she could have no way of knowing
whether or not she'd been removed from her cage, experimented upon, and returned.� She remained healthy, her shapely young body,
with its firm little breasts and taut buttocks, retained its tone, and her
periods came and went with undiminished regularity; the skin of her face and
body, despite being unwashed and unbathed since she'd been caged, was soft and
smooth under its eternal coating of dirt and by now she'd become accustomed to
the sour, pungent reek of her body, even when she sweated during her endless pacing back and forth behind the
bars. 

&nbsp;

�Penny turned her thoughts to the people who
visited the Shed, some to fetch and replace various items of agricultural and
scientific purpose, and some to work at the keyboards and monitors scattered
about on various work-benches along the walls. She had come to know many of
them by sight, and she had her favourites
amongst them, those who brought her scraps or stayed for a moment to talk
softly to her in their incomprehensible language. One of these people was a
young woman of Penny's own age to whom Penny had, for some obscure reason,
allotted the name 'Lorna'. She would nearly always bring Penny scraps from her
breakfast; toast crusts,� fruit peel and
cores, and the like, and she always took a mid-morning snack of a sandwich and
an apple and throw the apple core to Penny and feed her the tattered crusts of
the sandwich on the palm of her hand.

&nbsp;

�At first Penny had been deeply embarrassed,
and she had writhed inwardly at the humiliating spectacle she presented
vis-a-vis the other young woman, the one upright and clothed, her scented skin
gleaming with cleanliness, on one side of the bars, and Penny herself, naked
and dirty, with a dog-collar around her neck, eating from the clean
outstretched palm on all-fours like a dog. But Penny's hunger could never be
denied,and she even went so far, in a mood of defiance, to adopt the stance of
a begging dog, balancing on the balls of her feet with her legs folded beneath
her and her upper body and head raised with her mutilated hands dangling down
from her wrists held at the height of her breasts. In this manner she obtained
the attention of the passers-by, although it came to possess the drawback that
many of them wouldn't feed her at all unless she begged them first.

&nbsp;

�Penny turned around and rested her back on the
bars to look around at her familiar surroundings. Her cage was quite large (she
was not to know that it was the minimum area for an animal of her size,
although it totally lacked any area providing the privacy Zoo-keepers now deem
necessary for a higher primate like herself) at seven feet wide and high, and
eleven feet long. Its stained concrete floor was covered with an inch of chaff,
and the heap of straw which was her bed was piled in one corner. Diagonally
opposite was her four feet long, two feet wide litter tray, unfortunately sited
on the same side as her trough and only three feet from where she must eat and
drink. At the far end of the cage, in the corner not occupied by her bed, a
chain about a foot long had been welded to the thick corner post some six
inches from the floor. The free end of the chain held a simple spring securing
clip, of the type used to attach the leashes of dogs to their collars, and it
by this that Penny was tethered, as helpless as any chained dog, before her
cage door was opened. And she hated the experience. In training her to come and
be tethered, the first and only pain had been inflicted upon her and now she
obeyed the curt gesture to come to the person standing outside her cage at that
corner instantly, dropping to all-fours and holding up her chin at the bars for
the chain to be clipped to her collar. That pain, at her first and only
refusal, had been the most agonising and
intense that she'd ever known, and Penny no longer dared to entertain the least
notion of disobedience. Unfortunately for Penny, once she was safely secured
and the door opened for her litter-box to cleaned, she was often forgotten by
the person who'd tethered her, and she could spend hours on that cruelly short
chain until her frantic whimpers attracted someone's attention. But far worse
was that her Keepers took this opportunity to examine her skin, possibly for
signs of disease owing to her unwashed condition. Then they would run their
hands over her body with such an insulting indifference to her sex and
nakedness � as if she was a 'real' animal � that would make Penny sob with
humiliation and rage. 

&nbsp;

�Penny's attention was caught by the sound of a
tractor engine starting in the yard beyond the shed, then by the sounds of
approaching footsteps. Eagerly she turned and hugged the bars, staring at the
outline of the enormous sliding doors of the Shed, now about to open.

&nbsp;

�A flood of sunlight and an inrush of pure,
clean air accompanied the opening of the doors and the lights of the shed came
on, dazzlingly bright to Penny's eyes. Some forty people of varying sex and
ages entered to go about their errands, passing on either side of Penny's cage,
mostly ignoring her as she clung to the bars. Some of them were still chewing
on fruit, and bread rolls with various fillings, and Penny looked at them in
supplication. Two elderly men in white coats stopped by the bars and regarded
her with detachment. Penny dropped into a begging position and one of the men,
after addressing a brief phrase to his companion, tossed the end of his roll to
her. As usual, Penny tried to catch it in her mouth like a dog; as usual, she
failed dismally and the thrown morsel struck her upon her left shoulder and
fell to the floor. Instantly she went down on her elbows and grubbed about in
the straw with her mouth to pick up the scrap of bread and swallow it in a
single gulp. The core of the apple the other man had been eating followed, and
the two men walked away together.

&nbsp;

�People were coming and going all the time now,
and Penny stood up and hooked her forearms through the bars to help her step up
on to the the lower of the two flat horizontal bars which linked the vertical
ones of the cage eighteen inches from the floor and the same distance from the
roof. There she looked out into what she could see of the wide yard outside in
search of Lorna, completely regardless of the spectacle she presented to the
mildly curious gazes of the people walking by her cage.

&nbsp;

�Lorna came hurrying across the yard. She was a
little late this morning, and the fingers of one hand were fumbling with the
buttons of the clean white coat she wore over her short, summery dress while
she took huge bites out of the thick sandwich she held in her other hand. A
man, evidently superior to her in position, spoke to Lorna irritably as they
crossed paths in the wide doorway, and she made some sort of conciliatory
reply. Then she was striding past Penny's cage while Penny made little mewing
noises to attract her attention and kept pace with her to the end of the cage.
At the last moment, Lorna turned and threw the remains of her sandwich into the
cage. It separated into two pieces, both of which landed on the dirty floor.
Penny pounced on them at once, gobbling them down one after the other and
spitting out the tiny pieces of chaff which had stuck to them.

&nbsp;

�After swallowing the last fragments, Penny sat
up on her haunches like a dog, a position she could now keep for hours without
discomfort, and looked about her, licking her nose and chin with her long,
sinuous tongue. Though people continued to pass her cage on all sides, as they
would do all day long, none of them was eating. With no prospect of begging a
further snack, Penny came to all-fours and went to her trough to drink, fully
aware of the casual glances being cast on her and ignoring them as she'd trained
herself to do. Then she walked, still on all-fours, to the middle of the cage
and lay down full-length on her stomach on the prickly chaff. Propping her head
on her ruined hands, she stared out into the sunlit yard and waited patiently
to be fed.

&nbsp;

�Penny's mind went back in time to the early
days of her imprisonment. Then she'd spent most of her time curled into a
defensive ball on the floor of her cage, and when she was forced to move she
did so on all-fours, instinctively seeking to protect the most intimate parts
of her naked body from the eyes on any onlookers. Whether knowingly or not, her
captors had struck a deep and continuing blow against her morale as a woman by
not permitting her the least privacy. Isolated in her cage in the centre of the huge Shed, Penny could never be sure that some
of the many people present weren't watching her. The function of the
litter-tray was obvious, but using it in the full view of the outsiders had
been torture. But she had to use it, and she would squat over it wretchedly,
her whole body flushed with shame and embarrassment. But now, after so many
days in her cage, Penny emptied her bowels and bladder in their view without
the slightest hesitation, even with a certain defiance as though she really was
the animal they took her for. She was spared embarrassment to some extent by
the obvious lack of sexual interest in her displayed by the men who stared at
her, and she even found herself harbouring a
slight resentment at their indifference to her as a woman. Sometimes she even
wondered if her body had been altered in some grotesque way without her
knowledge, but a brief examination would always confirm that she still
possessed the same trim and attractive figure she'd attained in her late
'teens, some four years ago. And then there was the expression in their eyes
when they looked at her. She had seen it before, this expression, and she'd
even worn it herself, and she knew where she'd noticed it for the first time.
Her thoughts went back to that day at the Zoo when she'd been standing amongst
a small crowd of people staring at some animal in its cage. She'd raised her
eyes for some reason, and she'd seen in the eyes of the other human beings that
same expression with which she was now regarded, a mixture of mild curiosity
and the unconscious superiority of human beings towards a caged beast.

&nbsp;

�Penny stirred restlessly. Coming to a sudden
decision, she stood up and walked to the bars nearest her where she climbed on
to the lower transverse bar and began to walk upon it, moving each hooked
fore-arm around the bars in turnas she made her way around her cage.

&nbsp;

�Exercising her body, either by this method or
by pacing back and forth, was now for Penny, just as for any other caged
animal, virtually her sole diversion. (Although she did have a soft toy, a
stuffed rabbit someone had given her, and which she kept hidden under the straw
of her bed. Occasionally she would disinter it and play with it, batting it
from one front 'paw' to the other, or taking it in her teeth and throwing it up
in the air with a practiced flick of her head and neck.) 

&nbsp;

�Clambering around her cage in this fashion
attracted much more attention to her; people would watch her for minutes at a
time, smiling almost tenderly, pleased that their captive animal was enjoying
itself, as Penny often thought with a certain bitterness.

&nbsp;

�Finally, the muscles of her arms and thighs
aching with exhaustion, Penny stepped down onto the floor where she found she
had ended her exercise at the same time as the mid-morning break.

&nbsp;

�All around her cage, the denizens of the Shed
were leaving their keyboards and workbenches and streaming past her to stand in
the sunlight outside in the yard where a large tea-urn on wheels had appeared.
Penny watched them enviously; she hadn't felt sunlight on her face all the time
she'd been kept here, and she was given nothing but water to drink. Lorna came
by; she had her little snack with her, and she fetched a mug of tea and pulled
up a stool to eat and drink by Penny's cage.

&nbsp;

�Two feet away on the other side of the bars,
Penny sat like a dog in the straw and watched the other young woman at her
meal. First, after a gulp of tea, Lorna took a small pocket-knife and pared her
apple neatly, succeeding in detaching the peel in one long spiral. She smiled
in self-congratulation, and Penny shifted eagerly. Lorna tossed the apple peel
through the bars, and Penny fell on it.

&nbsp;

�The core of the apple followed in due course,
and Penny took it from the floor in her mouth and crunched it down before
taking up her sitting position and watching Lorna eat her sandwich.

&nbsp;

�Lorna smiled into the wistfully pleading eyes
of the caged woman. Tearing a scrap from her sandwich, she leaned forward and
proffered it on the palm of her hand. The caged woman came to all-fours and
lowered her head to take the morsel in her mouth neatly and without touching
the clean, pink flesh with her lips.

&nbsp;

�The process was repeated until the sandwich
was eaten. Lorna stood and showed the other woman her empty hands before
extending a hand through the bars and patting her on the crown of her head. Taking
her stool she walked off to her work-station, followed by the creature on the
far side of the bars until she was prevented from going any further.

&nbsp;

�Penny sat again and licked her lips, still
enjoying the taste of the sandwich filling. Then she sent to squat over her
litter-box, ignoring the glances of the people now streaming back into the Shed
to resume their work.

&nbsp;

�Afterwards she lapped some water, than went to
sit in the corner of her cage nearest the door. There she gazed across the yard
at the far wall where the big waste food bins stood, willing the appearance of
the farm-workers who would take them away and return later to feed her.

&nbsp;

�Penny had not long to wait before a tractor
and trailer pulled up by the bins, and the two men riding upon the trailer
jumped down and wrestled the swill-bins up on to the load bed. They re-mounted
the trailer, the young girl driver revved the engine, and the combination
rumbled away out of Penny's sight.

&nbsp;

�It wouldn't be long before she was fed now,
and hunger raged in her stomach. The few scraps she'd begged or been given had
done nothing to assuage it; on the contrary, they'd tended to increase it. She
found her mouth watering, saliva drooling from her slightly-parted lips. 

&nbsp;

�Penny waited patiently, picturing in her mind
the pig-sties where the tractor now stood, the bins on its trailer being
emptied into their troughs. She had no idea if this was indeed the case, or if
the pigs really existed. But this place was, after all, a farm, and she fancied
she'd heard the sounds of squealing pigs and lowing cattle in the past, even
though the only animals she'd yet seen were dogs and the occasional cat.

Her food would be brought
to her in a bucket when the imaginary pigs had been fed, and she thought that
it would be composed of the scraps remaining the bins, judging by its usual
variety. But Penny didn't care about that; she would eat the mixture, whatever
it was. She continued to sit, her eyes fixed on the yard, until a figure
carrying a bucket came into view.

&nbsp;

�Penny came to all-fours in anticipation. The
slight figure of the young girl-driver walked briskly around the cage, the
bucket dangling from her hand, and Penny followed on the other side of the bars
to her trough where she sat and looked down at it, licking the saliva from her
lips and chin.

&nbsp;

�The bucket clanged against the bars, and the
mess inside it slithered between them into the trough. Penny's head was already
lowered even as the last scraps fell into the trough, and she gobbled down the
food hastily, ignoring the long, heavy curtain of her hair which fell from
either side of her head and draped itself over the contents of her trough.

&nbsp;

�She ignored, too, the glances of the people
around her cage, whose attention had been caught by the clang on the bucket on
the bars, and even the stares of the three people � two men and a woman, for
she could see their feet just beyond the bars whenever she lifted her head to
choke down another mouthful of food � who had stopped to watch her eat.

&nbsp;

�Penny, once the edge of her appetite had been
blunted, ate more slowly. Now she had the time and the inclination to see what
she'd been fed, though it would make little difference. The people had eaten a
salad last night, she thought, for there was lettuce dressed with vinegar and oil,
and cucumber, and sliced tomatoes. There had chocolate cake too, and the rinds
of cheese; and then some of the remains of their breakfast, for there were
bacon rinds and half-eaten sausage, and sticky baked beans, and segments of
fried tomato, soft and greasy. Porridge had been served too, she noted, as it
usually was, and there was milk-sodden breakfast cereal mixed in. She ate
everything, irrespective of what it was, as she'd learned to do, and when she
raised her head for the last time she belched noisily, walked off to her bed
and snuggled down into the straw.

&nbsp;

�This had become a familiar routine; after
eating, she would take a brief nap to help digest her heavy meal. And then,
when she woke, she would empty her bowels in her litter-box.

&nbsp;

�All around her the work of the establishment
went on; people passed her cage on all sides, many glancing down at Penny where
she sprawled in her straw, but she slept on regardless.

&nbsp;

�Lunchtime came, and most people left the Shed
for the refectory, but a group of Bridge addicts, disdaining mere food, dragged
up chairs and a table to the doorway and began a rubber.

&nbsp;

�Penny stirred on her bed. She rose to
all-fours, took a few paces towards the middle of her cage, then stretched and
yawned. She shook her head violently, send her long, tangled, matted hair
swirling about her shoulders and feeling her collar sliding around her throat.
The increasing pressure in her colon sent her to the litter-box where she
squatted and relieved herself noisily. She took a drink from the trough, then
walked on all-fours over to the bars to sit and watch the card-players.

&nbsp;

�Time passed; the work resumed, and Penny
watched absently. She was about to get to her feet and take some exercise when
there came a diversion, followed quickly by another.

&nbsp;

�Penny didn't notice the arrival of the dog, a
large and handsome Red Setter, until it sat down next to the bars and looked at
her with mild interest. She had seen it often before, and she came to all-fours
and walked over to it, hoping to be able to stretch an arm through the bars and
pet it. But it was just out of her reach, and she sat and looked at it, staring
into its deep brown eyes with her own blue ones.

&nbsp;

�It was at these times that Penny would make
depressing comparisons between her own condition and that of the dogs. Like
them she wore nothing but a collar around her neck; unlike them she was penned
in the few square feet of her cage. She envied them their freedom; limited as
it undoubtedly was, to move around the place at will. She wondered where they
were kept, imagining the row of kennels to which hey were chained at nights,
and she envied that too. The dog grew bored, and walked slowly away, out of the
shed and into the yard, followed by Penny's wistful gaze.

&nbsp;

�Hearing a sharp, short phrase of command,
Penny turned her head to see the girl who had fed her standing by the corner
bar to which the short tether chain was attached. Resignedly, Penny trotted
over to the corner and lifted her head. The girl stooped, picked up the free
end of the chain, and clipped it to her collar before moving away.

&nbsp;

�Penny stood patiently in her cramped position,
her head almost wedged into the corner making it impossible for her to turn it
more than a few inches to either side. Behind her she heard the click of bolts
on the cage door being slid back, and then the slither of leather boots through
straw. Penny's collar was grasped firmly at the nape of her neck, and she saw
the girl's check-shirted fore-arm and the large pair of scissors in her hand.
Then her hair was cut short, raggedly and unevenly, the dirty tresses falling
to the floor about her hands, Finally she felt the girl stroke her back
reassuringly and then heard her departure. But she didn't hear the cage door
being closed, and she continued to stand where she was tethered, waiting for
whatever came next.

&nbsp;

�The brief but thorough examination of her skin
began. Although she'd often endured it, she could never bring herself to get
used to the impersonal way she was handled, at best like an animal, at worst
like some inanimate object. The capable male fingers, sheathed in thin plastic
gloves, roamed over her body, concentrating on her back and buttocks, and the
backs of her thighs. Penny concealed her anger and revulsion as her thighs were
gently parted and the fingers probed the tender flesh just below her vagina,
searching for signs of irritation of her skin. This was of the very few
remaining occasions in which she was still capable of feeling humiliated, a
humiliation made deeper by the insulting lack of sexual interest in her body
shown by her young male examiner. Finally the inspection ended, and Penny was
left to herself. But the door remained open, and she wondered dully if some new
humiliation was about to be inflicted upon her.

&nbsp;

�Still she stood there, hopelessly trapped by
her short chain, until her attention was diverted by the appearance of a dog, a
different dog from the previous one, but a dog she'd seen often before.

&nbsp;

�The big black Labrador looked at her for a few
moments, then extended its narrow muzzle through the bars and licked her face.
Then it trotted out of her sight. And then, to Penny's horrified disbelief, she
heard the quick scuffle of its feet crossing her cage towards her.

&nbsp;

�The dog, obviously intrigued by the rich smell
of her unwashed body, probed her armpit with its cool, damp nose. It licked her
right breast, then turned its attention to the cleft of her buttocks. Penny
could feel the dog's hot breath on her skin, but she was too afraid of its
sharp teeth to lash out with her legs and feet to try to shoo it away. Its nose
probed between her thighs, high up where they joined her body, and Penny
groaned softly with disgust and humiliation.

&nbsp;

�Then, to her immense relief, she heard quick
footsteps from behind and a curt command. The dog withdrew; seconds later she
saw it run past her and out into the yard. Then the unseen person behind her
slapped her painfully hard on the rump, partially disguising the sharp sting of
the needle entering her flesh.

&nbsp;

�A few moments passed, and Penny became aware
of a growing lassitude and euphoria. She hardly felt the coldness of the
antiseptic being rubbed on the skin at the rear of her left thigh, nor the
prick of the needle inserted into a vein. A few minutes later the needle was
withdrawn, the person left the cage, and the door was bolted shut. Penny's
chain was detached; too sleepy to move far away, she lay down and fell into a
drugged sleep.

&nbsp;

�The mid-afternoon tea break was long over when
Penny woke. Feeling remarkably alert and full of energy, she took a drink then
climbed up on to the transverse bar and began clambering around her cage,
ignoring the amused glances from the various people around her.

&nbsp;

�Even when her arms and thighs were aching
under the strain, Penny was not content. The working day was over, and people
were streaming out of the Shed when she began to pace restlessly back and forth
in her cage.

&nbsp;

�The Shed gradually entered until only Lorna
was left. After an interval, the young woman leaned back in her chair and
stretched. Then she checked her monitor before saving her work. Putting her
computer on 'Stand By', she rose to her feet and walked towards the wide doors
of the Shed, eager for a cup of tea and a shower. The woman in the cage stopped
her endless pacing and fell to all fours to butt her newly-shorn head softly against the bars in a bid to attract
Lorna's attention.

&nbsp;

�Lorna stopped by the bars and looked down at
the other woman's bare, dirty back, an odd expression of tenderness mixed with
pity on her face. Stooping, she began to scratch the other woman behind her
ears and at the the hair-line just above her leather collar, wrinkling her nose
at the rank smell of her body.

&nbsp;

��� �Poor thing!� she said to the
uncomprehending ears. �Perhaps it was a good idea they insisted we trained
ourselves to think of you as an animal. We wouldn't have been able to treat you
like this, nor to do what we've done to you, if we hadn't. I wonder when you'll
find out we made you pregnant a fortnight ago?�

&nbsp;

�Lorna continued to pet the other woman, now
wriggling like a dog in ecstasy under her fingers. With pity in her voice, she
went on speaking.

&nbsp;

���� �You'll have the best of medical care, of
course; and the labour and delivery will be quick
and easy. The heads of the creatures you are carrying will be smaller and more
streamlined than the heads of fully human babies; I wonder what you will make
of your offspring, half with your own genes, and half with the genes of the
male donor of another species?�

&nbsp;

�She fell silent again, trying to imagine her
own reactions on giving birth to two such creatures as she knew were in the
early stages of development in the other woman's womb. Lorna shuddered, then
continued her soliloquy.

&nbsp;

��� �Your children will be healthy, for you are
a young and healthy animal, and they will grow much more quickly than purely
human babies. The Prof. is confident that you will suckle them; he relies upon
the deep maternal instinct of mammals. And I expect you will, too. He already
speaks of breeding from you every eighteen months or so, and expects to be able
to do so for another twenty years or more. You will become a very valuable
animal to him, and to Medical Research in general. If all goes well, you shall
help to save the lives of thousands of people, all over the world.�

&nbsp;

�Lorna gave a final sigh. She patted the
woman's back high up between her shoulder blades and withdrew. Her last sight
of the caged woman was of her sitting in the corner of her cage, staring up
through the bars at her in entreaty. Then Lorna turned off the lights and slid
shut the Shed doors, securing them behind her.

&nbsp;

�Left alone in her cage in the evening dimness
of the great Shed, Penny sat and looked at the closed doors for a long time.
She went to urinate, and continued her pacing up and down until it was quite
dark.Then she dropped to all-fours and walked to the heap of straw in the
corner. She lay down and fell swiftly into a deep sleep.

&nbsp;

�And so passed another of the long days for
Penny in her cage; the cage which had become her whole world, and which her
subconscious mind had already concluded that she would never leave.

&nbsp;

PENNY'S CAGE 

������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
TWENTY YEARS LATER

&nbsp;

�Penny gently disengaged the pup from her right
breast and laid it in the straw. The big Spaniel bitch who was suckling the
third of Penny's latest litter along with the�
sole survivor of her own looked across at her lazily before closing her
eyes again. Rising to all-fours, Penny walked the few feet to where her strayed
male offspring was standing unsteadily on its tiny legs, mewing plaintively for
rescue. Lowering her head, Penny picked it up in her teeth by the flap of loose
skin at the back of its neck and carried back to where she'd been lying. The
pup she'd been feeding had now joined its sister in suckling from the bitch,
and Penny put down the pup she carried and lay down upon her left side.
Crooking an arm around the mewing little thing, she dragged it gently to her
full left breast. She felt its toothless, slimy, little gums fasten upon her
nipple, and she made a soft little sound of pleasure and physical relief as the
pressure in her swollen udder was gradually eased.

&nbsp;

�Finally the gorged pup loosened its grasp on
her teat, and Penny pushed it gently away to join its sisters and the bitch's
own pup, now curled up asleep together in the protective curve of the Spaniel's
furry belly. Penny stretched herself on the straw in sheer animal contentment. She'd
been vaguely aware she'd been watched for some time by a man and two woman
standing just beyond the bars, and she mewed with pleasure as one of the women
crouched and put her hand through the bars to fondle her head. She rolled
lazily on to her back, her knees drawn up and her elbows planted on the floor
on either side of her chest, her fore-arms upright and her shapeless hands
dangling from her wrists. The woman began to scratch Penny's belly with her
gentle, slender fingers, and Penny made a repetitive, deep, contented noise in
the back of her throat, rather like the purring of a big cat. 

&nbsp;

�But the 'Gods', as Penny increasingly thought
of them, finally walked away from her cage as they always did. Penny rolled
over and came to all-fours, yawning as she looked down at her pups, now safely
corralled by the long fore-leg of the big bitch. She padded over to the
litter-box and eased herself before going to the trough and lapping up its
water thirstily. Life was much better when her pregnancies were advanced and
when she was feeding her pups; then she was fed more often, usually two or
three times a day instead of once. And, on this occasion, when she'd given
birth to three pups instead of her more usual two, a large lactating dog was
put in her cage to help her feed them, sometimes with a pup of its own,
sometimes not.

&nbsp;

�Penny drank all the water in the trough, too
fast for its automatic mechanism to replace it. She and the bitch were
perpetually thirsty, striving to replace the liquid lost by their bodies to
their insatiable offspring. Then she sat in front of the trough, staring
absently out into the familiar Shed, always with one eye out for a 'God' who
might stop and pet her.

&nbsp;

�For Penny loved being petted. She loved being
scratched behind her ears and at the back of her neck just above her collar
through her thick mane of dirty hair, and she loved being stroked by the warm,
clean-smelling hands of the 'Gods' and 'Goddesses' outside her cage, knowing
they were proud of her, and of the pups she produced so easily and so often.

&nbsp;

�She thought about her pups for a long time.
She couldn't remember bearing her first ever litter of two, nor her own
reactions to the unusual shapes of their bodies; shapes which now seemed
entirely normal to her. And nor could she remember how many litters she'd
borne. It seemed to her sometimes that she'd spent her entire life either
pregnant or satifying the needs of an endless sucession of greedy little
mouths. But the continual swelling and emptying
of her udders, and the feeling of mindless happiness when she was lying on the
straw with her pups at her breasts were so enjoyable!

&nbsp;

�Penny's mind was unusually lively today, and
she pondered again for a moment on the antecedents of the male donors of DNA in
the genetic make-up of her pups. Sheep, she'd decided long ago, thinking of the
short, blunt, muzzles and the mild eyes. Their tiny bodies grew immensely fast;
in less than three months time they would be eighteen inches high at the
shoulder, and she would have to stand on all-fours to suckle them, and in six
they would be fully grown animals, as big and heavy as herself. But Penny had
rarely seen one of her adult offspring; taken from her at three months of age,
they grew up somewhere else on the premises. She had not the slightest idea of
what became of them once they were taken away from her, or for what purpose
they'd been bred. Perhaps they were used for Medical Research, she thought
hazily, or even sold as unusual pets. They would make good pets, Penny thought;
easy-tempered, docile and intelligent, bred without front teeth or claws. She
had seen several of them over the years, led past her her cage on leashes. Or,
perhaps, it was the same animal each time, for she couldn't tell them apart once
they'd passed a certain age. Like her they were hairless of body apart from a
thick thatch on their heads and between their hind-legs, though their's were
hind-legs were very different from hers; short and muscular, the same length as
their fore-legs. She might have been able to identify them by the serial
numbers tattooed in blue ink on the rear of their left upper thighs if she saw
them often enough, but she seldom had the opportunity.

&nbsp;

�Thinking of their identification tattoos
reminded Penny of the time she'd had her own number imprinted under her skin, a
long, long time ago. Two 'Gods' had stood in front of her cage, one carrying a
broad wooden cylinder studded with tiny needles and smeared with thick blue ink
along with a large, flat box holding a thick, ink-saturated pad. Penny had been
called to the corner and tethered by the short chain, then they'd entered her
cage. They'd walked straight over to her; one had seized her by her collar and
forced down her head while the other, after a few seconds, had struck her
violently from behind on the rear of her left thigh. The initial pain of the
blow had mostly hidden that of the needles entering her skin, but afterwards
she'd itched unbearably, and her flesh where she'd been hit swelled up
painfully. The irritation had subsided, and the swelling too, and she might
never have known what had been done to her until she saw one of her pups being
tattooed in the same crude manner. She no idea of her own number; try as she
might she couldn't twist her head and body far enough to see it.

&nbsp;

�She yawned. The water in the trough had now
reached its usual depth of an inch, and Penny bent her head and lapped again.
Then she returned to the pups where the bitch was waiting for her, wide-awake
and ready for Penny to take over the task of protecting their pups.

&nbsp;

�Penny lay down on her left side, close to and
facing the dog. The bitch rose carefully, and Penny extended both her arms to
surround the four little bodies. The dog walked away, and Penny closed her eyes
and dozed off only to be woken by the insistent pressure of a tiny muzzle
pressing against her left breast, blindly searching for her nipple. She looked
down at it. The Spaniel puppy mewed piteously, and Penny gently pushed
sidewards an inch or so, guiding it to her breast. The sharp, pointed, little
jaws closed over her nipple and it began to suck sleepily. Sighing with
contentment, Penny closed her eyes again. 

&nbsp;

The dog woke Penny from her light doze by poking its
leng nose into the protective arc from by Penny's left arm and beginning to
lick their pups, both the short, downy fur of her own and the little hairless
bodies of Penny's. Penny withdrew her arm and rolled onto her back, then upon
her right side. She stood, thirsty once more, and walked over to the trough. After
drinking, her first thought were, as always, for her pups and she glanced
anxiously across the cage. She relaxed, seeing the big dog lying facing her,
all four of their pups suckling at its teats.

&nbsp;

�Penny strolled
slowly over the bars nearest the big open doors, walking easily and naturally
on all-fours, perfectly used to this means of locomotion by now, so used to it
that she never stood upright any more and her calf muscles had grown thin and
wasted. She sat in that dog-like stance she now found so comfortable and stared
through the bars into the yard.

&nbsp;

�The sun was
out, and an occasional gust of warm air blew upon her. She ondered idly what it
felt like to feel the sun on her skin; she couldn't remember ever doing so, but
surely she must have done when she'd been as free as the 'Gods', all those
years ago. Like them, she'd worn clothing, and she'd walked where she would, as
free as the air. Penny could vaguely remember the feeling of silken cloth on
her skin, but, try as she might, she couldn't imagine ever seeing the outside
world except through the bars of her cage. The thought brought her to speculate
idly on just how many years she'd been here, and how old she was now. It was
summer outside; how many summers had she seen in this cage? She had no real
idea, except that she knew she'd just turned twenty-one when she'd been Taken. 

&nbsp;

She dismissed her thoughts, yawned, and try to estimate from her degree of hunger
when she'd be fed. Then, coming to all-fours, she lowered her head a trifle to
enjoy the touch of the silky smooth leather of her collar sliding forward on
her neck before lifting her head again to make it slide back again to encircle
the base of her throat, something she would occasionally spent hours doing. She
found herself wondering idly just how many years she'd worn her collar � she
didn't even remember it first being put around her neck � and what it looked
like. Penny suspected that it was a normal leather dog collar, plain leather,
not studded, but whether it was the usual buff colour, or perhaps black, she
didn't know. Its colour would almost black by now, anyway, particularly on the
inside where it would have collected, over the long years, a fine patina of
dirt and the oils from the skin of her neck. Anyway, it was now as much a part
of her body as one of her limbs and she no longer resented this indicator of
her true status.

&nbsp;

�So unusually active was her mind that Penny
even began to ponder her future, something she rarely did. Sooner or later, she
knew, she would become too old to carry further litters of chidren; what would
the 'Gods' do with her then? She tried to recall what fate awaited old and
useless animals in the world she'd left so long ago, and failed. Probably, she
thought hazily, nothing would really change. She would grow old, and, in the
usual course of events, she would die, here in the cage where she'd spent
nearly all her adult life.

&nbsp;

�Penny went and squatted over her litter-box,
then returned to her pups. Her breasts were beginning to swell with milk again.

&nbsp;
