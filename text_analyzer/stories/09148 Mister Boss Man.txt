Chapter One
- Boss, are you listening? Hello-o-o!
Finger snaps appeared before his face. Light shimmered in his pupils. He grimaced exasperated. Couldn&#8217;t people leave him alone to his thoughts just for a few second? It took him a few moments to focus his sight completely. Adam Rich owner of Hot Spot graced him with a look, towards the irritated bartender standing with one foot on the rail on the lower part of the counter, tapping his foot, looking expectant upon him. What?! He wanted to scream the four-letter word. He let his eyes fall back on the goddess they were on a few moments ago. People always suspected he had all the answers. Which he usually did, but tonight, not so much and he was well aware and it was pissing him off. He made an agitated grunt. Something, or maybe he should call it, someone, was disturbing his focal point on business and he was all about business. It was his livelihood after all and his life as it was right now� 
- What? 
He replied without taking his eyes off the gorgeous voluptuous woman on the dance floor. Long cinnamon curls were swishing against the lower of her back. What he wouldn&#8217;t give to fist it and wrap it tightly around his wrist while he devoured her lush mouth. 
- Can I skip out early tonight?
Adams brows furrowed in momentary confusion. He knew he&#8217;d just given the punk off a week and he needed someone to tend the bar tonight. Saturday was their busiest day of the week. Jake knew this. He was the damn best bartender on staff he had. He was a regular Tom Cruise in Cocktail. Rarely, there was a pair of dry panties by the bar, whenever he was working his magic. A smirk kicked up the curb of his lips. Mojo &#8211; as Jake often referred to it as. Like that super geeky spy Austin Powers. Although Jake didn&#8217;t look much geeky to Adam, so he would never associate him with Mike Myers. The tousled sandy brown hair looked like something straight out of the fashion magazines. That is, opposed to his slightly curly mop of chocolate brown swirls. Usually he cut his curls very short to tame them, but somehow his hair always curled by his temples and on his nape. If he didn&#8217;t love his mom so damn much, he would have cursed the woman a mile, long time ago for her obnoxious genes. 
- Jake, I just gave you last week off for personal reasons and we have a full house tonight. So get your ass back to work. 
Adam looked down the bar and caught a glimpse of his newly hired bartender Terry. He sighed and shook his head. He was still a bit unsure if he&#8217;d made the right choice about her. Terry had no coordination and fumbled most of the times. A loud crash sounded and violently snapped him out off his thoughts. He started down towards her and his temper caught up with him. 
- Terry, that&#8217;s a 300 hundred-dollar bottle Whiskey. Damn it!
- Sorry boss. 
The girl looked down intimidated, like he was going to strike her mistake or maybe fire her. He&#8217;d rather cut his hand off then strike a person I violence. He was no brute, he only brooded and he did that to an A-plus. Well the last he might. But the girl had only been there for a few weeks and there was something about the girl that spoke to his soft heart. When he&#8217;d hired her, she&#8217;d looked almost ready to blow over from exhaustion and hunger. She&#8217;d looked like she needed a place to get her bearings together, so he&#8217;d offered her the job in his bar. Maybe he should rethink that? Or just give her a different spot on his floor. 
- Yeah, I know, but have you seriously checked out that honey on the dance floor. Wouldn&#8217;t mind giving it to her tonight... 
A low wolf-whistle sounded. He&#8217;d completely forgotten about Jake. He snatched the metal clipboard under his arm and looked at his watch. He had a meeting with a supplier in 15 minutes. The �club� needed some new playthings� 
After a deep breath to try and restore some of his famous patience, Adam followed the road of sight Jake&#8217;s eyes were on. Unaware, his fists automatically clenched and he had to restrain himself from grabbing the pup by his shirt collar. Jake was a notorious womanizer and Adam wasn&#8217;t letting him anywhere near his woman. Yeah that&#8217;s right. She&#8217;s mine! An insistent voice sounded in his head. His gaze slid down the swaying hair flowing to the beat of the rhythm, surpassing the waist and straight to her ass. His cock responded instantly. That was some ass he wouldn&#8217;t mind to paddle after hours. He&#8217;d love to see those luscious globes turn pink by his 3x7 inch custom-made paddle. 
A paddle he hadn&#8217;t used on any woman before, but somehow he wanted to brand this woman with it. He&#8217;d had it made a few years back, when he was engaged to his ex. Well - not as a particular gift for her per se, but as a basic need to brand his woman, once he&#8217;d gotten married. He would probably have introduced her to it, but she chose to walk out on him a few weeks before their wedding, by hooking up with his best friend and best man. Nice feeling getting stood up, he thought sarcastically. Bitch, he muttered under his breath. He new that Brett and Nicola &#8211; Nic &#8211; was expecting their first child together and happily married now. He shook his head to try and distract the train of thought he was on. 
What was it about this particular woman that made him, want to bend her over and spank her, just to see the intricate patterns and his initials decorate the fine shapes of her delicious bum? Because it would mark her as yours stupid, a little voice told him. Hey! Cut out the insults! He drew an exhausted sigh. Yeah, he knew all this. He was a Dom and his inner dominant was definitely rattling the cages in his mind and body. He might as well just succumb to the damned need and just pull her away by the hair, like the caveman he felt like right at this minute. 
- Get back to work, twerp. He slapped Jake in the back of his head and stepped away from the twenty-something punk. He glances down at his clipboard again. Yeah, these things he ha to be here for. He stepped around third of his bartenders. The counter was about 18 feet long and made out of walnut tree, which meant that every bartender had about 6 feet to cover per person. He shook his head. He would definitely have to find another bartender and reassign Terry to a different spot. His head automatically lowered and his shoulders hiked up, when he heard a second crash. 
- Sorry boss. 
Damn it. He exhaled a deep breath and felt rather lightheaded. Maybe he was coming down with something. Nah. It was just Terry that was bad for business. When tonight was over, he was reassigning her and come Monday, he would start hiring new people. Meanwhile he might as well tend bar, after the meeting with the suppliers. He pushed up the hatch by the end of the counter and noiselessly put it down again. Pushing people aside, he stepped through the throng of people glued to his counter, just to get a new shot or round. 
A bit father down by the wall he pushed against the black door that said &#8211; VIP&#8217;s only. On the inside, Bear was standing. 
- Hi Boss. Busy eve?
- You know it, Bear. 
Adam smiled to the huge bearlike guard guarding the second entry to his club. Strangers to his club might think, why did he need a second guard and why did the door say &#8211; VIP&#8217;s only. Well, disguise was his life, he thought ironically to himself. Hot Spot wasn&#8217;t any typical club. It housed the biggest Underground Club in New York. Underground Club was a synonym for Sex Club. Pretty much so. He opened the door by the end of the narrow hallway. The door let him to so downhill stairs, which he took two at a time. He looked down at his watch again. Three more minutes to go. Supplier&#8217;s really hated waiting and he didn&#8217;t want these guys to just disappear without dropping his products off. 
Electrical torches were decorating the stony walls. Made it look ancient and dungeon like. Just the look he&#8217;d gone for, when he built this secret passage to his baby. The passage led to a second door about twenty feet away. He pushed the door up and was surrounded with the familiar scent of sex, vanilla from the air fresheners and leather. 
- Hey Adam. Good to see you again. 
- You too, Lucy. New sub? He nodded towards the guy on the floor by his Mistress&#8217;s feet with his eyes pinned to the wooden floor below his knees. Somehow he&#8217;d always wondered if some of the poses a sub was required to present him or herself in didn&#8217;t hurt like a bitch. He quickly disparaged himself of the thought. Man, he&#8217;d been away from the scene to long, if he started thinking those kinds of thoughts. A quick glance at the sub, made him notice the red marks painting his back. Familiar warmth ignited in the pit of his stomach and spread through his whole system like a bonfire. Realizing, he hadn&#8217;t had a sub in so long and the woman upstairs was really playing a number on him. 
- Nah, well� She nodded and continued. &#8211; Yeah, kinda. I&#8217;m training him for a friend of mine. 
- Okay. Sounds strange, but whatever. I trust you know what you&#8217;re doing. He smiled and kissed her cheek. &#8211; I&#8217;ll have to catch up with you later, hun. Suppliers are waiting for me. 
Another kiss and he was off. He was on a schedule. The lounge slash lobby of his club was the shape of a big dome. A
