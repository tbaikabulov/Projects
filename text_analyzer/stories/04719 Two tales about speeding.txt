Synopsis: This is a
fictive story about juridical punishment of speeding in Denmark. Partially based on a proposal by the Danish
politician Overgaard, it takes place in year 2016 where the city center of
several cities had banned cars from entering them resulting in a need for an
alternative method of transportation because the roads in most of the city
centers in Denmark are too narrow to accommodate bus-service.

&nbsp;

Here are two stories
about different people experiences in this kind of punishment system. 

A) The shameful speed hog

1.
 A bad day
in the traffic

&nbsp;

Oh � No. He knew it
before he opened the letters from the police. Several of nice pictures showed
him in his car behind the driving wheel speeding well above the limit.

&nbsp;

It came to a total of 90 kilometers. Every 10 kilometers above the limit meant community service for 5
hours. The service had to be served very locally and usually on Sundays. It
consisted of cleaning up in ditches along the Danish highways. It was
considered a very suitable punishment for people, which drove their vehicle too
fast.

&nbsp;

But 9 Sundays! How
could he explain his wife this. In addition, they had so many parties to attend
in the next months.

&nbsp;

Because the pickup for
the community service always was at the local town hall, he was also at risk of
being seen by his neighbors. It would be very shameful if they saw him in the
community service boiler suit.

&nbsp;

Then he saw it. An
alternative method could be chosen. He could serve in the rickshaw service in Copenhagen. If he did, he could do his punishment in just
3 days. The rickshaw service was an experiment made by the Danish government,
because it had become difficult to find task for all the offenders, which were
caught speeding. Because the task was regarded as harsh compared to cleaning
the ditches the total number of hours of community service was less, if the
offender chose this method of punishment.

&nbsp;

A training day would
cut 10 kilometers and two days in the weekend as pony service
would take care of the last 40 kilometers. It meant he could use one weekday on the
training day, which meant that he could cut 10 kilometers off. He had many flexible hours to spend. It
would not be a problem. Then a weekend in service would deal with the rest of
his punishment.

�

It could secure his
anonymity because the ponies were hooded with a leather hood, which disguised
their faces.

&nbsp;

He signed up for the
rickshaw service.

&nbsp;

He told his wife that
he had to work in the weekend because his company had a chance to get a huge
order.




2. Training day

&nbsp;

One Friday he entered
the ranch, where the ponies were trained. Exactly where the ranch was located
was a secret as a service to the ponies. He had told his wife that she could
not reach me at his job because he would attend a meeting with a costumer.

&nbsp;

Once he had checked
into the facility, he was followed a man wearing a heavy rubber apron and
gloves to a dressing room and told to undress. He should carry only his running
shoes along.

&nbsp;

Then they came to a
bathroom. �Please, lie down on this bench on your stomach.� He did as told.
They cuffed him at his wrist and feet. Also a leather strap went over his body
and finally he could a collar around his neck so his head could not be moved.
It felt like being putted in a pillory.

&nbsp;

�We have to clean you
before we put the tail into you�

&nbsp;

�Tail?� He was just
about to ask what it meant when they inserted a gag-ball in his mouth.

&nbsp;

�Just relax. It would
hurt only a little but when we insert this nozzle into you. We have lubricated
it very well. It is only 2 liters.�

&nbsp;

As told, they inserted
it and he felt the water running into his stomach. First, it was not so
unpleasant but then he felt the pressure of the water, which made him sweat.

&nbsp;

After a while, the
water had run into him. Then the nozzle was removed and replaced by a butt-plug,
which was inflated. �You have to hold it for 15 minutes or it would not be
effective.� Then the officer left him alone.

&nbsp;

His stomach began to
cramp and it became worse every minutes. He moaned and groaned in the gag. Then
his body began to shake out of control.

&nbsp;

Just as he was about
to lose consciousness the man returned. He was released from his restraints and
followed to a toilet. �I am now going to remove the plug. Relief your self and
when you are finished please take a bath. You can remove the gag also.�

&nbsp;

When he was finished,
they followed him to the stable.

&nbsp;

First, they put a kind
of leather corset on him. Leather cuffs were placed on his upper arms and his
wrists. The cuffs at his wrists were a kind of leather mitten, which removed
his use of his hands.

&nbsp;

They asked him to bow
and they mounted a piece of leather at his crotch, which covered his genitals.
There was a strap, which went between his legs. In the strap, there was a hole.
He felt something entering his anus. It was a tail mounted on a butt-plug. It
hurt a little but the staff where experts and it went in fast. The tail was
hold in place by the leather strap.

&nbsp;

�Now for the hood: It
is very important. I think that the prospect of being anonymous is why you have
chosen this harsh method of serving your punishment. Normally we only get those
people, which have caused personal damage. They have not a choice like you
had.�

&nbsp;

They pulled the
leather hood over his head. There were small opening at the eyes consisting of
small metal rings and a large opening at his mouth. They also put a posture
collar on, which forced his head up. He did feel like looking down in shame,
but it was not a possibility now.

&nbsp;

�Let�s go outside
where you cart waits for you. Because you are only going to serve for two days,
it is a two-person cart you have to pull on your own. We only team people up,
when it comes to longer sentences.�

&nbsp;

The cart was connected
to some D-rings at his corset and they also put a head-harness on with a
bit-gag, where the reins were attached. Finally, they mounted a harness so the
weight of the cart was spread out over his body.

&nbsp;

�Let�s start the
training.� 

&nbsp;

For the next couple of
hours we were command around the field by the instructor. Because it was a
secret, which people that, did the community service as pony, it was not
allowed to use a whip on the pony. It could leave marks on the ponies, which
could reveal their identity.� The control
had to be made by the use of the reins only. It meant a lot of training because
he had to work in the crowded and often narrow streets in the center of Copenhagen.

&nbsp;

A couple of time they
stopped at a drinking post. It was a device, which looked very similar to
something he had seen in the children�s rabbit cage. Finally, after some 3-4
hours the instructor was satisfied.

&nbsp;

He was lead back to
the stable where he got a shower to wash the dirt of and went to get his orders
by an officer after he had dressed into his own clothes.

&nbsp;

�You have to report
out here on Saturday at 7�am. You have to change into the pony gear, before we
drive you to Copenhagen in order to avoid being recognized. You are on
duty 3 hours, then you have a lunch break and finally you have about 4 hours
more of services, before we take you back here. You will of course be cleaned,
but if you need to pee, just do it. You are properly aware that people
convicted of white-collar crimes do clean the streets and they also have a duty
to put sawdust where you do what you have to.�

&nbsp;

He left and drove home
very nervous about what was about to happen to him.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;




3. Saturday

&nbsp;

After the painful
process of dressing (He could not adjust to the enema.), he was lead outside
the stable where more than thirty ponies waited for the transportation to Copenhagen. The officers did not like talking among the
ponies, so they were all gagged with huge gag-balls. All sizes of people were
present, even some woman.

&nbsp;

They were ordered on a
bus. Once arrived in Copenhagen, everyone was connected to his or her carts. Every pony had to start at
separate places. He was ordered to �HoejBro Plads.�

&nbsp;

His first costumer was
a businessman, which he had to transport across the town. The price of using
the rickshaw service was only about 2 euro regardless of the route and
distance. Nevertheless, it was only allowed to use the service in the city
center. It was a cheap method of transportation and very popular among
tourists.

&nbsp;

Just as the
businessman left, two young girls hired him. They went around the city center
on a random route. They giggled and made comments about his body. They also
took him to the one of the drinking posts and serviced him. Finally, they
ordered him to the town hall where they left him.

&nbsp;

Only 1 hour left
before lunch break. However, first two Japanese tourists hired him for a ride
to the other end of the city center called �Kongens Nytorv.� Well arrived he
went for the pony stand, where one of the officers took his bit-gag off and
pulled a nosebag over his head. The food consisted of flakes of oatmeal. It was
difficult to eat like this. Luckily, the service was well known around the
world. It was very popular to have once photo taken beside the pony, and one of
the tourists helped him so he could get something to eat. The tourist also
helped him to something to drink.

&nbsp;

Once the lunch break
was over and his bit inserted a young couple hired him for a drive to the
church, where the Danish crown prince was married. They had a little difficult
to find the right direction and had to ask a police officer for help because
they could not communicate properly with the pony.

&nbsp;

The rest of the day
went by transporting businessmen from one office to another. Finally, his first
day of service was over. Released from the cart he was followed on the bus once
again gagged with a gag-ball. However, he was to tired that he would not talked
to any of the ponies if he had been able to.

&nbsp;

After the shower, he
went for his car. He did not feel like talking with any of the other ponies and
they were equaled shameful about their community service, so it did not take
long before all had driven off in their cars.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

4. Sunday

&nbsp;

After having been
transported into town and hooked onto the cart, he stood waiting for the first
customer. His behind was very sore and his legs were neither doing well.
Luckily, the harness was made so that the tenderness in his upper body was
bearable.

&nbsp;

When he had been
standing there for 15 minutes, he heard some familiar voices. It was Ann and
John from his office. They were obvious out on some date. Normally he would be
one of the first to spread such kind of new gossip in the office. However, the
situation prevented him of course to do so, because he could not reveal
himself. Their secret was safe with him.

&nbsp;

�What are we going to
eat today? Chinese?�

&nbsp;

�No, they have a lunch
offer at a Greek restaurant down in Fiolstraede. But lets take a roundtrip in
the city center first.�

&nbsp;

It sounded like they
were kissing back there, but of course he could turn around to see for himself.
After a while, they started to small talk.

&nbsp;

�Had you heard that
James had been collecting 3 fines for speeding at the same day? Which one of
the ditches do you think he is working in?�

&nbsp;

�Actually we don�t
know. We have tried to get one of the colleagues to drive around in order to
take some photos even if it is illegal to do so. It could be fun to have those
at the Christmas party. But we have not found out where he serves his
punishment.�

&nbsp;

�Do you think that he
would try to avoid his punishment by choosing to do time instead?�

&nbsp;

�No, James is a man
supporting the law. He would take his punishment. Even if it is correct that he
would have to serve entire 9 Sundays as the rumors goes.�

&nbsp;

�9 Sundays. That is a
lot of punishment. Nevertheless, he knew the risk. A lot of time of the highway
means a greater risk of being caught.�

&nbsp;

Finally, they arrived
at their destination. Thank God for the leather hood. They had not recognized
him. Leaving the cart Ann gave him a firm padding on his behind commenting:
�Firm butt.� Then they left.

&nbsp;

When it came to his
lunchtime there was many tourists around him. He even got hand feed by one of
them. It was more pleasant than eating from the nosebag. He was grateful.

&nbsp;

Sometime during the
afternoon, he stood and waited at the town hall, when he suddenly saw his wife
and two children approaching the cart. Had they recognized him? His wife said
to the children: �Lets take the cart to Kongens Nytorv. Then we can use the
underground train from there.�

&nbsp;

�Could father not pick
us up? My feet are tired.� One of the children started to complain.

&nbsp;

�But he is working
right now.� 

They went onboard and
he went slowly up trough the main pedestrian street. When they arrived his wife
stopped and looked closely on him for a couple of minutes before the children
distracted her. Then she padded him on his behind and left for the train.

&nbsp;

Did she recognize him?
It did not look like it, but did she touch strange men like this? He was
confused.

&nbsp;

Later he together with
a female pony was hired to drive four tourists to the other end of the city
center. He had to admit that he like the sight of the female body of the pony
in front of him as they did the trip.

&nbsp;

When he had about a
half hour left, he had to pee. He had no choice. Shameful he did it in the
middle of the street. It ran down his leg and some ended up in his shoes. He
was hardly done before a man in a yellow punishing boiler suit came and put
some sawdust down on the spot where he peed.

&nbsp;

Finally the day was
over and his punishment was over. Once he had been transported back to the
ranch and stood in his own clothes, he got a chance to ask one of the officers
how they managed to handle the cold whether.

&nbsp;

�This kind of
community service does only exist from April to September. When the
temperatures get below 15 degrees centigrade, the ponies also wear a tight
latex suit. The suits becomes very quickly. Did you learn anything from your
experience by the way?�

&nbsp;

�I properly would stay
below the speed limits in the future. This kind of punishment is simply to hard
to cope with in the long run.�

&nbsp;

�Then the message our
government would like to tell people like you had gotten trough. Good luck in
the future.�

&nbsp;




5. Epilogue

&nbsp;

When he reached his
home, the children and his wife was already home. �Did you have a hard day at
work? Did you get the order?� his wife asked.

&nbsp;

He nodded. He was too
tired.

&nbsp;

�We have been in Copenhagen. We have been on a canal tour boat.� one of
the kids said. �Yes, and we also took a pony cart.� the other one added.

&nbsp;

He did not like to
talk about this subject further and hurried to ask what they would have to eat
at dinner. �I have not been able to get any well-tasting food for lunch.�

&nbsp;

When his wife went to
get the children to sleep, he hurried out in the bathroom and washed the
running shoes so they would not smell so bad. Once they were cleaned, he
managed to smuggle them out in the shed where they could dry without anyone
asking questions of why he had cleaned them.

&nbsp;

When he finally sat in
his bed and adjusted the clock, his wife turned toward him.

&nbsp;

With naughty
expression in her face, she said. �Do you know that you have a firm butt, when
you are exercise? How about I am giving you a ride for a change?�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;




B) Domestic peace restored.

1. As it used to be

&nbsp;

�Now you have done it
once more. You have not the DVD�s sorted by the name of the production company.
It cannot be THAT hard. You are so messy! Yesterday you had put your underwear
in the wrong laundry basket and you had forgotten to close one of the cupboard
doors in the Kitchen.�

&nbsp;

John did not listen.
She complained all the time. Moaning, Moaning etc. It had been so for more than
3 years.

&nbsp;

He had even stopped
going anywhere in a car together with her, when it was possible to avoid it.
�Look at the road. You are going too fast. Mind the pedestrian.� He could not
take it. He considered a divorce.

&nbsp;

He had meat Ann some
10 years ago. She was a beautiful young woman with a well-proportioned body.
She had long hair with a mix of brown and red. In the start, he was very
skeptical about her interest in him. He was a grown man living in the northern
suburb of Copenhagen called Hellerup. He did not know whether it
was the prospect of living in his town that made her having an interest towards
him or it was he as a person, which she fell for.

&nbsp;

When he had her home,
she threw herself at him and they had wonderful sex. After 2 years, they married
and they both got jobs at once.

&nbsp;

He worked as assistant
in a firm of contractors, but Ann�s career skyrocketed. After 5 years, she
became a manager and soon her income became the basis for their way of living.

&nbsp;

When they had their
children, he stayed at home when the first 14 days had passed.

&nbsp;

When the kid got
older, the daily routine always stayed the same. They dropped of the children
in daycare. Then he drove her to her job. She did not like to drive herself. He
had changed his working hours and now he worked only part-time. After work, he
collected the children and went to collect Ann. During this time, she was all
over him, telling him how to drive.

&nbsp;

When they got home,
she started working once more and he would make dinner. After they had eaten, he
would see to that the children would get into bed. Sometimes Ann would take a
break from her work and join him kissing them goodnight. However, they had to
behave or she could loose her temper.

&nbsp;

Still he loved her and
now he had taken an extra job because he wanted her to have a special gift when
she turned 35 the next month.




2. The course 

&nbsp;

Then one afternoon,
when they approach their home Ann told John, that she had to go to a course.
What John did not know, was that she had arrange for her lover Stephen from the
work to join her at the hotel a few hours before the course started.

&nbsp;

On the day of her
departure, she was late. She had to take Stephen in her car at his place,
because his car was at service. Therefore, she rushed over to his place at
little irritated about all the roadwork on the highway.

&nbsp;

Nevertheless, she made
it and they had a very good sex followed by an exciting course. When she
returned home on Monday even John noticed that she was in a very seldom-good
spirit.

&nbsp;

However, it all
changed the next Friday, when she opened her mail.

&nbsp;

It was a photo from
the police showing her speeding with more than 30 kilometers above the limit. It was a catastrophe. The
photo showed her at the wheel and a blanked out person at her side. If John
became aware about this fine, their marriage would be over. There should not
have been anybody at her side. She would have been alone. The stretch of road
where the photo was taken was not even close the route to she was supposed to
have taken.

&nbsp;

How could she explain
to John that she had to do community service for the next three Sundays? The
new government had abandoned fines as a method to regulate the laws about
speeding. Every 10 kilometers meant community service for 5 hours. The
service had to be served very locally and on Sundays. It consisted of cleaning
up in ditches along the Danish highways. It was considered a very suitable
punishment for people, which drove their vehicle too fast.

&nbsp;

In addition, her
position in the local society was in danger. She had always been a front figure
when it came to volunteer work for the church. Because the pickup for the
community service always was at the local town hall, she was also at risk of
being seen by her neighbors. It would be very shameful if they saw him in the
community service boiler suit. Her � the manager at one of Denmark�s largest firms doing community service in a
filthy boiler suit, it could not happen!

&nbsp;

For a moment, she was
in despair. Then she saw the alternative offer. She could serve in the rickshaw
service in Copenhagen. If she did, she could do his punishment in
just 2 days. The rickshaw service was an experiment made by the Danish
government, because it had become difficult to find task for all the offenders,
which were caught speeding. Because the task was regarded as harsh compare to
the task of cleaning the ditches, the total number of hours of community
service was less, if the offender chose this method of punishment. A training
day would cut 10 kilometers and a full weekday of pony service would take
care of the last 20 kilometers. She could take two days of because she had
plenty of flexible hours to spend. John would not have to know.

&nbsp;

She was so pleased
that she did not notice that her offence had been categorized having been done
under aggravating circumstances because it was done along a roadwork, which
meant that she had endangered the lives of the road workers.




3. Preparing and fitting the pony
gear

&nbsp;

�Darling. I am taking
the bus today. There is no need for you to drive al the way to my firm just to
drop me off. Remember that I cannot be reached by phone because I have serious
meeting regarding a merger all day. I even think that those meetings would
continue tomorrow.� 

&nbsp;

First John was
surprised but he always was a somewhat relieved.

&nbsp;

Ann steeped on the bus
and changed several time in order to secure that she was not followed by anyone
from her local community. Then she reached the ranch, where the ponies were
trained. Exactly where the ranch was placed was a secret as a service to the
ponies.

&nbsp;

Once she had checked
into the facility, she was followed a huge matron wearing a heavy rubber apron
and gloves to a dressing room and told her to undress. She should carry only
his running shoes along.

&nbsp;

Then they came to a
bathroom. �Please, lie down on this bench on your stomach.� She did as she was
told. The matron cuffed her at her wrist and feet. In addition, a leather strap
went over her body and finally she got a collar around his neck so her head
could not be moved. It felt like being put in a pillory.

&nbsp;

�We have to clean you
before we put the tail into you�

&nbsp;

�Tail? What tail� She
started to protest, but the matron quickly shoveled a huge gag-ball into her
mouth shutting her effective off.

&nbsp;

�Just relax. It would
hurt only a little but when we insert this nozzle into you. We have lubricated
it very well. It is only 2 liters.�

&nbsp;

As told, it was
inserted with a little pain and she felt the cold water running into her
stomach. First, it was not too unpleasant but then he felt the pressure of the
water, which made her sweat. After a while the water had run into her. Then the
nozzle was removed and replaced by a butt-plug, which was inflated. �You have
to hold it for 15 minutes or it would not be effective.� Then the matron left
her alone.

&nbsp;

Her stomach began to
cramp and it became worse every minute. She moaned and groaned in the gag. Then
her body began to shake out of control. At the end, she screamed muffled
screams into her gag. The matron returned and told her to calm down. It would
soon be over. She was released from her restraints and because her feet would
not support her, she was dragged a toilet. �I am now going to remove the plug.
Relief your self and when you are finished please take a bath. You can remove
the gag also.�

&nbsp;

When she stepped out
of the bath, she felt her behind very sore. She had newer had anything inserted
in her rear hole. When she was finished, he was followed to the stable.

&nbsp;

First she became a
kind of leather corset to put on. It had leather cuffs at her upper arms and
her wrists. As they tightened the corset, she always felt it as if she was
going to be cut in half. The cuffs at his wrists were a kind of leather mitten,
which removed his use of her hands.

&nbsp;

They asked her to bow
and they mounted a piece of leather at his crotch, which covered her genitals.
There was a strap, which went between her legs. In the strap, there was a hole.
She felt something entering her anus. It was a tail mounted on a butt-plug. She
screamed out when they started to press plug into her. �Be quiet. You have
volunteered. You could have chosen normal community service, if you knew that
you could not take it.� Soon they had gotten the widest part into her fanny and
she made a sigh of relief, when it was fully inserted.

&nbsp;

�Now for the hood. It
is very important. I think that the prospect of being anonymous is why you have
chosen this harsh method of serving your punishment. Especially, as we can see
from your reaction from the tail that you are ready to endure a lot of pain.�

&nbsp;

They pulled the
leather hood over her head. There were small opening at the eyes consisting of
small metal rings and a large opening at his mouth. They also put a posture
collar on, which forced her head up. She did feel like looking down in shame,
but it was not a possibility now.

&nbsp;

�Lets go outside where
you cart waits for you. Because you are only going to serve for one day, it is
a two-person cart you have to pull on your own. We only team people up, when it
comes to longer sentences.�

&nbsp;

The cart was connected
to some D-rings at her corset. They mounted a head-harness on her with a
bit-gag, where the reins were attached. Finally, they mounted a harness so the
weight of the cart was spread out over her body.

&nbsp;

�Let�s start the
training. I have to call the instructor. Oh. There he is.�

&nbsp;

As Ann turned her
head, she got a shock. It was John.




4. The training

&nbsp;

Then she got hold of
her self. There was no way he could recognize her. And they did not use names
on the ranch at all. They only referred to the ponies by the case number.

&nbsp;

For the next couple of
hours the instructor commanded her around the field. Because it was a secret,
which people that did the community service as pony, it was not allowed to use
a whip on the pony. It could leave marks on the ponies, which could reveal
their identity.� The control had to be
made by the use of the reins only. It meant a lot of training because she had
to work in the crowded and often narrow streets in the center of Copenhagen. A couple of time they stopped at a drinking
post. It was a device, which looked very similar to something she had seen in
the children�s rabbit cage. Finally after some 3-4 hours the instructor � her
husband was satisfied.

&nbsp;

�Now you can maneuver
the cart in a satisfactory manor. It is nice to see a person able to take a
command whenever given and just executing it without second thoughts.� Then he
told her to return to the stable before he started the training of the next
pony.

&nbsp;

She was lead back to
the stable where she got a shower to wash the dirt of and went to get her
orders by an officer after she had dressed into her own clothes.

&nbsp;

�You have to report
out here on Saturday at 7�am. You have to change into the pony gear, before we
drive you to Copenhagen in order to avoid being recognized. You are on
duty 3 hours, then you have a lunch break and finally you have about 4 hours
more of services, before we take you back here. You will of course be cleaned,
but if you need to pee, just do it. You are properly aware that people
convicted of white-collar crimes do clean the streets and they also have a duty
to put sawdust where you do what you have to.�

&nbsp;

She left for the bus
stop. Her mind was a mess. Had her husband recognized her? What other surprises
did the pony job have in store for her?

&nbsp;




5. Working day

&nbsp;

After the painful
process of dressing (She could not adjust to the enema.) she was lead outside
the stable where more than thirty ponies waited for the transportation to Copenhagen. The officers did not like talking among the
ponies, so they were all gagged with huge gag-balls.

&nbsp;

They were ordered onto
a bus. Once arrived in Copenhagen, everyone was connected to his or her carts. Every pony had to start at
separate places. She was ordered to the plaza in front of the city hall.

&nbsp;

Her first costumers
were two youngsters. They went around the city center on a random route. They
made fun of her hour shaped body. They also took her to the one of the drinking
posts and serviced her. They squeezed her buttocks bringing her to sob in
humiliation. Suddenly one of the workers from the department approached them.
He grabbed the youngster. �You have just won 2 days of pony service. It is
against the law to do actions, which would be judged as sexual harassment
against any pony. You have also broken the law that forbids disturbing
interference of public transportation.�

&nbsp;

The two youngsters
broke down in tear, but there was no mercy. A police officer on a bicycle came
by. The two offenders were cuffed to the bike by a chain and they had to run
behind the bicycle as the police officer slowly biked down to town hall.

&nbsp;

The officer comforted
Ann. �I am truly sorry for their annoying behavior. That is why we are around
to key an eye on things. However, you still have to finish your punishment. The
question is whether you can cope it today or we should arrange to do it another
day. Nod if you wish to continue it today.�

&nbsp;

Ann nodded. If she
chooses another day, it meant another day with enema and dressing up in pony.
She could just go ahead and get it over with. Therefore, she continued her
services.

&nbsp;

One after another, she
took businessmen to difference locations around the city center. She had often
used the rickshaw service herself, when she had meetings in the city center. It
was the fastest way of getting around if one had a heave briefcase with papers
and was dressed up in a nice suit. There was no reason to spoil once hairdo
with a bike helmet, which has been mandatory in Denmark for years.

&nbsp;

She recognized some of
her clients and was grateful for her hood. Because she did her service on a weekday,
there were not so many tourists around. It was a setback, when it became
lunchtime. It was very difficult for her to eat out of a nosebag. Then she
heard familiar voices. It was John and her children. �Lets us help the ponies
with their feeding process.� He took the nosebag off and handfed her. The
children also held their hands up with flakes of oatmeal and she saw their
surprised big blue eyes when she ate. Theirs ran down from her eye but because
of the hood, they could not see it.

&nbsp;

�Father. Why are they
dressed up like this?�

&nbsp;

�It is because they
have broken the law. If you break the law, you must pay the punishment. In the
old day�s only two types of punishment existed: Prison or fines. Now almost
every offence is punished with some kind of community service, because people
cannot continue to work and pay taxes when they are in prison. We should in
some way be proud of those people who take responsibility for their actions and
repay their debt to society by hard work.�

&nbsp;

John also held a
bottle of water up to her mouth and she drank it all gratefully. Then her
lunchtime was over.

&nbsp;

�We want a ride� It
was one of her children. John and her kids sat down in the cart and they began
to go slowly down the main pedestrian street. When they reached the end, John
came to the front and said with a low voice close to her head; �You are doing
fine. I am proud of you. I recognized you in training because of the birthmark
on your left buttock. I took the kids out of school today in order to have an
excuse to see you in action. Relax, I have not told the children about your
community service. Your secret would be safe with me.� Ann started to cry with
relief. John left with the children.

&nbsp;

The next clients were
all businessmen. Then another familiar voice reached her. It was Stephen in
company with a blond girl. What was he doing here? At this time, he was
supposed to be driving to a client several kilometers from here.

&nbsp;

As she began to run
down the street, she heard them talking in the back. �How is Ann for the time
being? I know that you were together with her at your company course. When are
you going to tell her that you are together with me now?�

&nbsp;

�Later. It is good for
my career to be with her. She does not control my timesheet. I just write a
visit some client on it and we can be together instead. If I did not endure
serving her untrimmed body, we could not spend so much time with each other.
Does that meaningless sex bother you at all?�

&nbsp;

�Well in way it does.
But I also want to be with you and it means that you have to stuff that fat
goose, it have to be like this.�

&nbsp;

Ann became angry when
she heard their conversation. She wanted to stop right there at kick his ass
forth teen days into next week. However, she had no choice to continue. Finally,
they came to the restaurant where Stephen and his girlfriend were going. 

&nbsp;

Ann continued her work.
At last, the day ended and after she had returned to the city hall, she was
disconnected from her cart and led into the bus.

&nbsp;

It had been a very
hard day. Her husband had discovered her most shameful secret. Her lover had
been making a fool out of her. She cried on the way back to the ranch.
Thankfully they were gagged so not even the pony next to her discovered it.




6. Surprise punishment and lacing
loose ends.

&nbsp;

After her bath, she
went to the officer in charge to confirm that her punishment was over. He had a
surprise for her. �Due to the fact that the offence has been done under
aggravating circumstances, you are in for an extra punishment. You have
endangered the lives of the road workers and it is not acceptable. But relax;
there is no more rickshaw service in store for you. The extra punishment is
that you have to perform at one of our dressage shows.�

&nbsp;

�As you know, we have
those shows from one time to another in order to raise money for the school
crossing guards all over Denmark. It means two-three extra days depending how
fast you learn the steps. It is not so hard as pulling carts is but one have to
concentrate.�

&nbsp;

Ann was in shock but
at least she had not to care about a lie to John, because he knew her secret.

&nbsp;

As she left the ranch,
she saw John waiting for her in the car. �I have sent the children over to your
parents. We have to talk.� They drove home in silence.

&nbsp;

At the dinner table, John
took the word. �I do not know where you were caught speeding and what the
reason was not to tell me. I have not seen the picture. I have my suspicion
about your reason but I do not care. Or I would rephrase it: I would not want
to know it. I think we should concentrate about the future.�

&nbsp;

�I know that I have
been a bitch for sometime. I felt it as I was raised above the crowd and
behaved accordingly. I did not appreciate our relationship and I have behaved
poorly toward you and the children. I can see it now and I want to change.
Please accept my apology.�

&nbsp;

�I accept it. Past is
past. You are forgiven and we have two children to think about. What about we
take some days off in a weeks and stay at a hotel without children just making
love for the entire weekend?�

&nbsp;

�I agree. I would talk
to my parents so they can take the children for a weekend. But I have also one
more request. It seems that my punishment also include participation in a
dressage show. Could you train me?�

&nbsp;

�I have to speak with
my superior because we are related, but I would think that is all right.�




7. Next day in office

&nbsp;

�Stephen: I want to
see you in my office right now�

&nbsp;

Stephen was a little
surprised. She sounded angry. He went to her office with a charming smile on
his face. Whatever her reason, he would twist her around his finger in a few
minutes. He had this kind of power over women. Glowing with self-confidence, he
went into her office.

&nbsp;

�Close the door!�

&nbsp;

�I have a serious
matter to discuss with you. I saw you with a woman yesterday. I heard you
talking about my untrimmed body and certainly dislike being referred to as a
goose. What have you to say for your self?�

&nbsp;

�But� I �. How???� 

&nbsp;

Ann made a horse
sound. Stephen dropped his jaw.

&nbsp;

�You!! You - You were
pulling us.�

&nbsp;

For a moment he looked
as he had seen a ghost. Then he started to laugh. �I had to admit that I have
been fooling around, but you cannot do anything about it without relieving to
everyone that you have done pony-service. I would destroy your reputation.�

&nbsp;

Then they heard a
knock on the door. The president of the corporation entered.

&nbsp;

�I have informed my
superior about my punishment as it is company policy to do.�

&nbsp;

The president
continued. �Yes that is correct and we find that her punishment would not have
influence on her position at our company. You however have falsified
timesheets, which is a crime. You know that the punishment would be community
service in the city center emptying garbage cans and sweeping the streets.
However, we would give you a choice. If you resign on your own with a clause
about total secrecy, we would not press charges. You have to decide now and you
are going to be outside the firm in an hour. Here is the contract. What is your
choice?�

&nbsp;

Stephen signed without
a word and left the office slamming the door.

&nbsp;

�Thank you� Ann took a
breath of relief.

&nbsp;

�It is all right. I
did community service just 6 months ago for speeding. It was hard cleaning the
ditches for a full Sunday, but I am admiring your choice to do pony service. It
must be so harsh. However, try to avoid business and personal life in the
future. It was no secret in the company what you had going with Stephen. It had
bothered us for some time and if it had continued we would have been forced to
react.�

&nbsp;

�There would be no
repetition. I have learned my lesson.�

&nbsp;




8. Preparing for dressage training

&nbsp;

Ann and John arrived
together to the ranch.

&nbsp;

The matron took care
of the cleaning process. Prepared and experienced from the previous cleaning
process, she took the painful enema process more relaxed. When she entered the
fitting room John was waiting for her with a couple of other staff members.

&nbsp;

�You have to wear
another outfit, than the one you have previous warn. First the black PVC
jumpsuit.� As Ann had put it on, she noticed there were openings at the bottom.
Then they put a red leather corset on her and laced her very tight, which made
her gasp for air during the lacing process.

&nbsp;

Then they mounted a
red leather strap on the back of the corset, which was supposed to go between
her legs. They told her to bend over and clenched her teeth. She knew the tail
was supposed to get in and she was not disappointed. It even hurt a little
more. 

&nbsp;

�We are using a larger
plug during dressage training. It makes you more aware about your movement.�

&nbsp;

After the fitting of
the tail, they connected the leather piece in front, so her genital were
covered.

&nbsp;

�Now for your hood:
You would notice and it is a special latex hood with a artificial mane in the
top. Because you only have to perform one show, we would not require a special
haircut.� When Ann got it on, she discovered that her face was not covered.
�But now people can recognize me.� 

&nbsp;

�Not exactly. You
would be wearing blinkers during the show. It would be difficult to recognize
you because people can only see you at distance. If the show is broadcasted on
television, it is not allowed to zoom in on your face.�

&nbsp;

�Now for your posture
collar. You have to keep your head up during the show. This collar would force
you maintain your head in the same position.� They closed the collar. Ann could
neither lower her head nor turn it. A ball gag was inserted in her mouth.

&nbsp;

�We have to do
something about your posture. You have this tendency to walk stooping. Your
back has to straight.�

&nbsp;

They produced an arm
binder and laced it tight. At the bottom of the binder, there was a hook, which
they connected to a similar hook at the strap, which went between her legs
forcing her to straighten her body up.

&nbsp;

�It seems OK. Your
husband has told you what size of shoes you use. Please support her while I put
her new shoes on.� It was an odd kind of shoes. She had not seen like it
before. It felt like a normal pair of high heels but they looked so odd. �When
you train, you will notice that the shoes leave marks formed like horseshoes
instead of a normal footprint. It is just a part of the illusion. Now you are
ready for your training. Take her to the walker.�




9. Dressage training

&nbsp;

John led her trough
the building. It was difficult to walk in these bizarre shoes and she almost
fell several times. Then they arrived to a large room where a strange form of
exercise ring was placed. It had six metal bars going out in the top. From each
bar, chains were hanging down. Two other ponies were already going slowly
pulled by the slow movement of exercise ring.

&nbsp;

John pressed a control
button at the wall, which made the exercise ring stop. He took her to the ring
where she was placed just below one of the bars. He then hooked two of chains,
which were hanging down to some D-rings at the top of her arm binder. He
returned to the controls and pressed the button, so the ring started again.

&nbsp;

He had a long
horsewhip, which he used to correct their pace. �Raise your legs high when you
walk.� He just indicated how high she had to raise her leg by putting the tip
of the whip under her knees. If was very difficult to do because she could not
look down due to the posture collar.

&nbsp;

Around and around they
went for 30 minutes. Then he stopped the exercise ring and disconnected her. As
she stood watching the other ponies as they continued their walk, she noticed
that it was two males. They had a Mohawk haircut. John could see the question
in her eye and told her why it had been done to them.

&nbsp;

�These two men had
been convicted of dangerous driving causing the death of another person. They
were sentence to 6 month of prison including a confrontation with the relatives
where they have to sit gagged and restraint for the most of an hour while the
relatives tell the stories of the deceased just so they can understand that
they caused the death of real persons.�

&nbsp;

�After their prison
time, they spend 3 days per week doing rickshaw service and 2 days out here
cleaning the place and 1 day practicing for the dressage shows and finally one
day of if there is no show in that weekend. They have their hair done like you
see because they have to stay here doing their punishment for a whole year per
person they have killed. Their presence is mandatory at every show unless our
doctor tells it otherwise.�

&nbsp;

�After they have done
their time at this place, they can cut all their hair of and start to grow a
normal haircut. They can take an ordinary job but have to do community service
1 day per week cleaning ditches along the highways for 6 month up to a year
depending of their ability to show genuine remorse before the parole board.�

&nbsp;

�But enough of this
now. Let�s go outside. We have to go trough your program.� He led her to a
training ground. He showed her a diagram of the program she was supposed to do.
Then they started to practice.

&nbsp;

�Now walking pace!
That is good! Raise your legs a little further when you walk. Your knees have
to almost touch your breasts. That is good!�

&nbsp;

�Run as fast as you
can. Stop! Stand on one leg. Higher up with the knee. Try to hop on one foot
and turn your body at the same time. No. You have to take care about not moving
around. The turn must take place on exactly the same spot.�

&nbsp;

Ann was sweating and
panting. It was hard. They took a break and she got something to drink. �You
are improving, but there is still a lot to learn. Let�s continue.�

&nbsp;

He continued to coach
her all afternoon and finally she could do the program. 

&nbsp;

As she left the shower
and waited for her husband at the entrance, she saw one of the youngsters,
which had bullied her. He sat and cried on a chair obvious shocked by his
experience of being trained to be a pony. For a minute she felt a little
sympathy with the young man, but then she remembered his insulting behavior and
though that he should had though a second time before he had chosen to bully
her. If once does a crime, once have to take his punishment.

&nbsp;

Later back at home in
bed when the children had gone to sleep, John asked her to bend over. She was a
little surprised when he entered her rear hole. �I have always dreamt about it
and it have certainly been cleaned and prepared for me today.�

&nbsp;

First, she did not
find it very pleasant. It hurt a little but after a while of hard pumping she
began to enjoy it and when he finally came, she also got an orgasm.




10. Dressage show

&nbsp;

Sunday they arrived to
the ranch. After she had been dressed, she was lead to a bus along with all the
other show ponies.

&nbsp;

Soon they were on
their way, but she became quite nervous when the bus stopped at their local
town hall. She had forgotten al about the civic festival. John was aware of her
risk of being recognized and soon took precautions against it. He closed her
blinkers until it was her turn to perform at led her to a chair.

&nbsp;

While she sat there,
she could here the crowd cheering and applauding whenever some of the
participants had done their program.

&nbsp;

Then it was her turn.
John took her by her arm and led her toward the arena. Then he opened her
blinkers and she saw the arena for the first time. There must have been at
least about 100 people attending the show.

&nbsp;

John led her to the
center of the ring. Then they started on her program. First she was very
nervous but then she concentrated on doing her program. It was not until she
was almost finished that she discovered that her parent had brought her
children over to see the show. Thank good for the hood and the blinkers. They
seemed to enjoy the show and her children did only once in a while waive at
their father.

&nbsp;

Her show soon ended
and after receiving a standing applaud John led her out back again and closed
the blinkers. He gave her something to drink. While they were waiting for the
rest of the show, she heard her mother speaking to her husband.

&nbsp;

�Where is Ann? Are
there still problems with the merger? The children had told us that she has
been so nice and relaxed lately. I thought the problems have been solved.�

&nbsp;

�The merger is quiet
in order. She is just in the firm putting the last pieces together. She would
be joining us to dinner tonight.�

&nbsp;

�What about your
surprise gift to her?�

&nbsp;

�Let�s talk about it
tonight. I have to get finished here.�

&nbsp;

�Of course. See you
later.� Then her mother left.




11. Happily living forever.

&nbsp;

In the evening, the
arrived at her parents house.

&nbsp;

�You seem to have lost
a lost of weight. Have you been working out?�

&nbsp;

Ann nodded. They soon
changed to other subject and started on the dinner. They were just getting
ready to leave the table, when John asked for the word.

&nbsp;

�As you know, Ann is
now 35. Lately we have found together in our marriage with renewed spirit. I
have for some time had a second job and had earned additional money, so I now would
present you with a 7 days vacation in London just for the two of us. I have arranged with
your parents and the president at your company that we would leave on Monday.�

&nbsp;

Ann began to cry out
of joy. She stood up and kissed her husband. �Thank you. I love you.�

&nbsp;

They had a wonderful
holiday. During their stay, they discussed her experience. Also how she had
changed as a person during the process were discussed.

&nbsp;

After they returned
from their holiday, a noticeable change in their daily life seems to have taken
place. Ann would share her part of the workload in the household. 

&nbsp;

Some years later a new
pony was let out in front of the stable preparing to be trained in order to do
rickshaw service. The matron looked around searching for the instructor. �Oh.
There she is. Ann: Come here!!�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
