Synopsis: When Erika wakes up, she is trapped. All because of an innocent looking packet containing a wedding gown she received...Not so usual disclaimer 
At last back to work� It has been over a year since I last posted a story.
  I would like to thank all my readers and particularly those who took the time
  to send a mail. 
This story is not strictly speaking a Lydia von Sklaverei's story. She is
  mentioned but not present. Maybe she will make an appearance in a later part
  of that story; I do not know it myself. This story has a theme which struck
  my fancy some time ago. A capture using the most delightful of all feminine
  garments, the wedding gown. I must give credit to Myriam Grey for some of the
  elements in the following story. She has written a wonderful story called Instant
  Bride. It has a TG theme, so be warned. 
I am trying to create a �coherent' world (or as coherent as a world based
  on fetishism can be�). No element is innocent. I will detail some of the features
  of this world in the next installments of that story. Do not worry; it will
  not take another year. If you want to write spin-offs, parallel histories or
  re-use some of my characters in other histories, go on. I do not mind if my
  creations live without my knowledge. However if you post a story, do it on
  a free site, please and drop me a line. I will not interfere, but I like to
  know where my characters are heading to avoid inconsistencies. 
Feedback is valued. Whatever you have to say, send it. Ideas are also welcome. 
Legal boring stuff, I have to say this, so I will try to make it a bit entertaining. 
This is a work of friction. It means you can rub it wherever you want. Errr� No,
  in fact I meant this is a work of fiction� Any similarity to any person, dead
  or alive would be generally coincidental and quite amazing. If there is any
  person called Lydia von Sklaverei out there, I am really sorry, that name was
  not in the phone book, so I thought it was safe to use it. 
Any similarity to events, past, present or future would be quite astonishing.
  If it is however the case, drop me a line, I will come to join the fun right
  away. 
I used a few names, well known to the readers of a famous American author.
  If she ever reads this, let it be known I used those names due to my admiration
  for her works and I hope she will not be offended. 
If any minor is reading this, well kid, do not read any further. This is not
  for you! I know this sounds pissing off and enticing at the same time, but
  this is grown-ups' stuff. Do not pollute your mind just yet with those thoughts,
  even if I suspect you have seen enough porn movies to give you a much degraded
  conception of love in general and sex in particular. If you are parents, just
  make sure your kids do not stumble on these texts� 
I own the copyright for this work, but I do not intend to make use of it as
  long as none is making profit from it. This is intended as a free entertainment. 
And now let's get to the goods! 
The Madam Moriarty Club: Satin 1 � Bridal Capture 
She did not know when things had gone awry. Well, she knew when she had got
  that packet, which had started her downfall, but she did not know what had
  caused its delivery to her in the first place. 
There she was, in a white satin teddy which would have been qualified as gorgeous,
  were it not for the fact the sleeves were fashioned after a straitjacket and
  her arms where thus crossed under her bosom, with no chance of moving them
  and no chance of removing that accursed garment. She had tried to slip it over
  her head, but it was of no use: each time she had tried, she had felt the garter
  belt around her waist move a bit and then effectively stop any further attempt.
  It seemed the teddy and the garter belt were fixed together. 
For perhaps the hundredth time, she looked around and studied her prison.
  She was in a beautiful room, elegantly and femininely furnished. The bed, on
  which she was lying, was at the center of this room. A monstrous king-sized
  four-poster affair of a bed. The sheets were satin like her teddy. When she
  had tried to get up from this bed, she had discovered that her feet were chained
  to the board at the end of the bed. This somehow did not surprise her. What
  was the point of putting her in a sexy but inescapable teddy prison if it was
  to let her wander at will. 
She laid down on the bed, looking upwards. A mirror was fixed to the ceiling,
  allowing her to see her whole body. She was trapped in that peculiar teddy.
  Her legs were in clad in sheer stockings. She could discern the cuffs around
  her ankles. However, the chain holding her feet was nowhere to be seen. And
  yet, as she shifted her legs on the bed, she felt the tug of a fetter. 
She gave up her useless attempts and went back to the moment when everything
  had gone out of hand. 
She had been alone in her small suburban house. She was looking forward to
  that day of inactivity. As a secretary in a lawyer's office, she did not have
  much time for herself. She was always ushering clients into her boss' office
  and preparing his appointments. Even during week-ends, she had to work to prepare
  those blasted files for her boss. And it was not the satisfaction of having
  her own desk with her name plate reading �Erika Mayfair' that could compensate
  that. 
Some clients were quite shady. She remembered that lady surgeon, Doctor Lydia
  von Something. She was, according to the files she saw, a top-notch surgeon,
  who had invented revolutionary techniques in plastic surgery. She had been
  fired from her former hospital because she was accused of stepping over the
  boundaries of ethics. What this meant, Erika could not even begin to guess� Her
  thoughts were drifting between embezzling money from the hospital to gruesome
  experiments on helpless patients. The lady herself was supremely impressive.
  A regal and haughty bearing, a strong jaw, blue eyes, blond hair coiled in
  a severe bun, she was a vision of strength all packed up in a specially tailored
  business suit. She was not walking through the office; she was simply entering
  a conquered domain. A cold voice, which sent shivers down Erika's spine, as
  if the lady was somehow not entirely subjected to human feelings but nonetheless
  tried to counterfeit them for normality's sake. 
And there was that other one. She was not as frightening as the doctor, but
  somehow even more disturbing. She was a new client. Her name was Vanessa Whateley.
  When she had walked into the office, Erika barely stifled a gasp. That woman
  was gorgeous. A tall redhead with sparkling green eyes, delicate features;
  Erika could not help but feel a sudden pang of jealousy. And the fact she was
  obviously filthy rich did not help ease that feeling. When she had addressed
  Erika, it had been in a low and sultry voice which literally oozed seduction. 
�Would you please warn Mister O'Neill, that Vanessa Whateley has arrived?� 
Erika had stared for a couple of seconds and then had stammered: �Of course,
  But did you have a meeting arranged with him?� 
Again the same low voice� �No, my dear. But I am pretty sure he will be able
  to find a few minutes to take care of my problems. It is of no importance if
  he cannot meet me right away. Waiting for him in your company will surely not
  prove a torture�� Taken aback, Erika had called on the internal phone. When
  she had said the name, she had been sure she had heard an excited squeal at
  the other end of the line. Two seconds later, the door to her boss' office
  had violently opened, her boss looking as if he had tried to wrench that door
  open in his haste to see his new client. The hinges had even given a faint
  creaking sound which bid no good� 
As Erika was thinking about those past times, her eyes drifted once again
  to the mirror. There she was, a brunette with green eyes and delicate features,
  an inheritance of both her deceased parents. Her mother had been a Japanese
  beauty her father had one day brought back from one of his numerous trips.
  He was an Irish man, raised in Saint-Louis . He gave her a famous family name
  in Louisiana . He told her he had had no contact with the main branch of the
  Mayfairs since decades, mainly because the old guardian of the main branch
  Carlotta Mayfair was an old bigoted crazy foul who did not care for the offspring
  Oncle Julien had left in the Irish parts of the City. So, rejected by his family,
  he had built his own affair independently� Her mother was a silent woman. However,
  a smile was always on her face which emphasized her extraordinary beauty� They
  had passed away in an airplane accident, on one of the trips her father insisted
  on doing �to keep an eye on the ever-changing world' as he said. 
And then her tricky mind drifted to that fateful Saturday morning when she
  had been abducted. By whom and for what purpose, she had no idea, even if she
  had suspicions on the latter considering her present outfit� 
It had come as an innocent-looking packet. She had been awakened by her door-ring.
  Groaning, she had turned on her bed, refusing to get up. And then, the ringing
  had gone on. Whoever had the nerve to wake her up on a Saturday morning at
  barely 9 sure wanted to see her. She got up wearily, put her night robe on
  and went down to her door. The ringing had not stopped, even becoming in the
  meantime more insistent. 
�All right, all right, I'm coming!� 
She fumbled with her keys and finally opened her door. On her door step was
  standing a tall raven-haired woman in an immaculate suit with a small equally
  immaculate suitcase at her feet. 
�Hello!� proclaimed the intruder �I trust you are Miss Erika Mayfair? You
  have been chosen to test our brand-new wedding kit! If you will just sign her�� 
She had thrust a clipboard into Erika's hands along with a pen and indicated
  an empty box in which to sign. Erika was totally baffled. 
�But I am not getting married! What is the meaning of this?� 
The delivery woman looked at her and then laughed good-naturedly. �But you
  are Miss Erika Mayfair? Then you are the winner of one of our special wedding
  kit. If you try it, I am convinced you will never see a wedding gown the same
  way!� 
Erika sighed, aware that this woman would never leave her alone if she did
  not accept all her conditions right away. 
�Okay, okay, I am taking it. Just put it in my living room.� 
�Very well, Miss!� 
One minute later, the white suitcase was sitting in the middle of her living
  room, the formulary handed by the delivery woman signed and the delivery woman
  herself was led to the door by an annoyed Erika. Before being ushered out of
  the house, the delivery woman piped in a last time �This kit will truly change
  your perception on wedding gowns!� �I'm sure it will.� grunted Erika. �Have
  a nice day!� declared cheerfully the delivery woman just before Erika's door
  slammed in her face. Her smile then faltered to be replaced with a wicked grin. �It
  will certainly change your perception on weddings in general and on wedding
  gowns in particular, Miss Stuck-up. And it will most certainly be a nice day.
  For one of us, that is.� She then left Erika's doorstep and went back to her
  van. All she had to do now was to wait. 
Erika was sprawled on her couch in her living-room. She was eyeing the suitcase
  with a mixture of scorn (mainly caused by its early appearance), curiosity
  and trepidation. She was not exactly a romantic, but she had to admit, the
  thought of a wedding gown was something she always found� stimulating. It was
  the epitome of femininity and she did not know a woman who could resist it.
  Getting up, she marched to the suitcase. Opening the top, she first discovered
  an array of beauty products which would make the joy of a professional beautician.
  There was among them some bathing products made specifically or at least so
  the label claimed �for the delicate skin of the bride to be.� Alongside it
  was a, as the label proclaimed, �special shampoo for the bride's hair, joy
  and marvel of the brides.� Giggling, Erika picked up both tubes and went to
  her bathroom. She filled her tub and poured some of the content of the first
  tube in her bath, before getting into it and using the rest to wash herself.
  The smell was intensely feminine, flowery and soft. Erika had no trouble imagining
  a bride on the morning of her wedding using those products. Unconsciously,
  her hands, which were busy washing her body, drifted downwards to her crotch
  and while she fantasized about her handsome imaginary husband began to frantically
  work on her clitoris and pussy. She was soon panting and not long afterwards,
  she let out a guttural groan, indicating she had achieved release. Pulling
  herself together, Erika giggled, thinking it was quite appropriate to get herself
  all wet in her bath. While reclining in her tub, her gaze wandered, before
  falling on the shampoo sitting on a tablet beside her tub. �Well,� she thought �if
  the bath products have so intense an effect, I can't begin to imagine what
  the shampoo will do.� She reached for the shampoo tub, poured some into her
  palm and began working on her scalp. �Whatever that product is, it certainly
  has a devastating effect� thought Erika when her head began to tingle. She
  was soon pouring some more shampoo into her palm and massaging her scalp. When
  the tube was empty, she washed her hair. Incredulously, after she had gotten
  out of her tub and dried her normally mousy hair, she remarked it was now shiny
  and healthy looking, like never before. �Wow, I should try and get some of
  the same brand, it sure is effective�� 
Getting back downstairs, refreshed and now considerably more good-humored,
  she lifted the panel on which the rest of the beauty products was and dived
  further into the box. She retrieved a gorgeous white satin wedding gown. She
  hung it carefully, admiring the gorgeous matter as it settled into its natural
  folds. It was truly a work of art. Even before being worn, one could see the
  woman wearing it would have all her curves emphasized and highlighted. It was
  a promise of a hot and sex-filled night in itself and yet with enough retinue
  to hint towards a mutinous virginity� Under where the gown had been, Erika
  found the other garments a bride would wear, all in white satin, all gorgeous,
  all irresistibly sexy. And in the middle of it, a white box with the words �Honeymoon
  preparation� etched in red letters on it. Reaching for it, she pulled it out
  of the box. Inside was a strange device, lying on a white satin bed. It looked
  like a scorpion without the pincers and with a ball instead of a spike at the
  end of its tail. There was a note, reading: �this is the ultimate device to
  prepare the bride in anticipation of the honeymoon. Place the vaginal stimulator
  on your opening, the caudal ball against your anus and let the device guide
  you to the altar�� Erika watched the device closely. There was some kind of
  tiny dildo on the part designed to go into her vagina. And the ball looked
  quite harmless. Shrugging, she shed the towel she had worn after her bath and
  put the device to her opening and guided the ball to her anus. At first she
  felt nothing. And then just as she was preparing to remove it, disappointed,
  she felt a tingling in her groin. The device suddenly began to provoke waves
  of pleasure in her body. And yet, it also seemed to prevent an excess of stimulation.
  It was making her hot but did not allow an orgasm. After a few minutes, Erika
  decided it was indeed a very good way to prepare a bride for her honeymoon,
  since it would make her so horny, she would do anything to get some release.
  The sensations then seemed to recede a little. Erika decided it was time to
  go on with her dressing. 
She put on a pair of trimmed satin panties, buckled the garter belt around
  her waist and rolled the stockings up her legs. She enjoyed the feeling of
  dragging that sheer material along her legs, savoring the caress. She clipped
  the top of the stockings to the six garters dangling from the belt. She then
  put on the strapless bra provided in the box. It emphasized her breasts, making
  them look bigger than usual and extremely inviting. 
She then went back to her bathroom to apply the make-up which was in the box.
  It was a very discreet make-up, just some eye shadow, a bit of mascara on a
  light colored foundation. After applying the soft lipstick, she looked into
  her mirror and decided she had not looked that good since years if ever. 
Getting back downstairs, she picked up the gloves from the box and slipped
  them on. Like the rest of the garments, they were made of white satin, but
  most interesting, they fitted her perfectly. The rest of the garments also
  did, but somehow, she had dismissed it as a coincidence. Now she was beginning
  to wonder how they could have gotten her measures. Shrugging she went back
  to the task at hand. She contemplated the gown. It was a gorgeous model with
  several layers of petticoats, a small d&eacute;collet&eacute; with some almost
  transparent matter stretched on it. It zipped up in the back. At the base of
  her spine, just before the curve of the petticoats, a big wide satin bow was
  nestled. Before putting the gown on, Erika searched once again in the box.
  She retrieved a pair of knee-high white high-heeled leather boots. The heels
  were in fact quite high, but she guessed, the bride would look all the more
  impressive in those boots. The funniest on their boots were however the two
  bows fixed at calf height above the heels. 
She laid the boots aside and picked up a box lying at the bottom of the box.
  The red words etched to the surface read: �Jewels for the bride.� Chuckling,
  Erika opened the box and discovered a choker and a tiara. There were clips
  on the tiara to affix the veil Erika then fished out of the box. 
Erika got up and opening the back of the gown, put it on the floor like a
  white satin circle. She stepped into that circle and bending over worked the
  gown up her body. The long sleeves puffed around her shoulders before becoming
  narrower and enveloping snugly her wrists. Zipping the gown should have proved
  a challenge, but once again, its creators had been extremely clever and had
  attached a string to the zip in the back. It allowed her to zip the gown shut
  without all sorts of unseemly contortions. She then arranged her petticoats
  around her as she sat down and put the boots on. They fit her snugly but comfortably.
  Once again, Erika wondered how they had got hold of her measurements but dismissed
  that thought for later treatment. 
Remained only the choker, the tiara and the veil. Erika examined the choker.
  It was a white leather choker, a bit wide but nonetheless pretty. There was
  a small metal rose etched to the front of the choker. Erika put it on. It was
  comfortable, even if a bit unusual. She then picked up the tiara, perched it
  on top of her head and took the veil. She went to the full-length mirror which
  was in a corner of her living room and attached the veil, completing the image
  of the bride. She was simply gorgeous. She looked at herself up and down, detailing
  everything and she had to admit, she found nothing to reproach. She was perfect. 
And then as her hands had brushed against the sides of the gown, the big bow
  in her back uncoiled itself and like two twin snakes, the two ends stroke.
  They coiled themselves around her wrists and brought them back to the small
  of her back where they affixed them solidly. Stunned by the attack, Erika stumbled
  a few steps backward. She fell on her couch. Just then the bows on her boots
  uncoiled too and, encircling the opposite ankle, deprived her of the use of
  her legs too. Too shocked to react, Erika laid on her couch, unable to think.
  She did not hear her door open. She did not hear the footsteps approaching.
  Only did she realize she was not alone when a hand lifted her veil. She opened
  her mouth to ask for help� and bit down on a rubber ball as a white ball-gag
  was forced between her teeth and buckled tight. She was then propped up against
  the cushions of her couch. The veil was replaced, but not before she caught
  a glimpse of the sneering face of the delivery woman who had brought her that
  box� 
�So� Did you enjoy your wedding kit? Well, now that you're correctly packaged,
  it is time to bring you to your spouse� But we would not want you to spoil
  the moment by struggling� So I am afraid I will have to put you to sleep� Pleasant
  dreams, sweetheart�� The woman had taken a small gas-mask from a pocket and,
  slipping it underneath her veil, had applied it to her nose and mouth. After
  a few reluctant but necessary breaths, Erika had felt like the room was spinning
  around her� Her last vision before falling asleep had been a white veil, the
  veil of her wedding gown� 
And now, as she was waiting for her abductor, on that bed, in those clothes,
  she could not help but wonder who had gone to those extents to abduct her.
  And what was with all that satin� As Erika was reflecting on those grim subjects,
  she heard a rummaging in the lock. She was about to know who had done this
  to her and even more importantly, who was, to imitate that delivery woman,
  her spouse? 
To be continued off course� 
What is next to come? Well, Erika will come a lot but we will also discover
  who her abductor is. And Erika is caught in a very large web� What is the Madam
  Moriarty Club? That must be explained since it is part of the title� Well� A
  bit of patience, please dear readers� See you soon, same bat-time, same bat-site! 
Second instalment of that series. It took me less than a month to write it. It
  is much more graphic than the precedent instalment. I hope I was accurate enough� 
There are more instalments to come. They will be more fetish-oriented than
  this part. Suggestions, comments, wishes from readers are welcome. Don't be
  shy! I try to answer the best I can. 
I hope you enjoy that part! 
The Madam Moriarty Club 
Satin 2 � Playing with the cat 
As the impressive oak door to the room opened, Erika tried to raise herself
  a bit to see who was entering. With her arms bound beneath her bosom, it proved
  however impossible� She heard the nearing steps. They were obviously made by
  high heels� Her mind raced. Her abductor, a woman? And then, her captor appeared� She
  knew that face� It was the same woman she had seen at her boss' office! Vanessa
  Whateley! 
Her expression seemed to reflect her amazement, because Vanessa let out a
  chuckle when she saw her face� 
�You certainly seemed surprised to see me, my dear� Why, I guess you did not
  even begin to suspect I might have had a hand in that little affair� Well.
  Now you know and I am sure you have many questions.' 
�But' she continued imperiously as Erika opened her mouth to say a word, �I
  will answer these questions as I see fit. So, shush, or I will have to gag
  you. Understood, my dear?' 
Completely dumbstruck by Vanessa's words, Erika feebly nodded. 
�Good girl.' She then sat on the bed beside Erika, who awakening from her
  stupor examined her captor. Vanessa was sporting a gorgeous long green satin
  gown with long sleeves. The cuffs were elaborately decorated with lace, but
  were still tasteful. The d&eacute;collet&eacute; was not exaggerated, but still
  showed a generous amount of cleavage. Vanessa's breasts were flawless. They
  were relatively ample for her frame but did not sag. Neither did they seem
  to be anything but natural. 
Vanessa registered her gaze. 
�You like what you see? Believe me, before long you will have an even better
  knowledge of that body�' 
She then laid alongside her prisoner, her hands roaming on Erika's body, gently
  tweaking her nipple and exploring the area between her legs. Her prey shifted
  uncomfortably but she continued nonetheless her rummaging in Erika's crotch
  area. Soon, one of her hand was tickling the folds of her sex, while the other
  was playing with a nipple through its satin prison. Erika moaned but said nothing.
  She was captivated by her abductor's gaze, which was fixed on hers. She was
  like a bird in front of a snake; she could not avert her eyes from Vanessa's. 
Silence fell between them. After a few moments, Vanessa got up and went to
  a cupboard sitting in a corner of the room. She opened a drawer, retrieved
  an object and came back to the bed, hiding it behind her back. She once again
  sat beside Erika. 
�If you want to ask me something, you may open your mouth, little one.' 
Erika indeed opened her mouth to ask her why she had done that. But in one
  deft move, Vanessa shoved a ball-gag between her teeth before lifting Erika's
  head from the pillow to affix the strap behind it. Dumbstruck by that move,
  Erika could only stare, her eyes full of hurt. 
Vanessa grinned. 
�I said you had the right to open your mouth. Not to speak. Do not worry,
  your questions will find answers, all in due time. But for now, I have waited
  long enough for your company. And I am going to enjoy it, like it or not. In
  fact I think you will like it. To a certain extent, that is.' 
After those words, she leant toward Erika's face and planted a wet kiss on
  her forehead. 
�Well, my little one. Mignonne, allons voir si la rose Qui ce matin avait
    d&eacute;close� And your rosebud will get all the attention I can give�' 
After those words, she shifted on the bed and went to kneel between Erika's
  thighs. She leant and lifted the hem of Erika's teddy. She then kissed the
  hairy little triangle just above Erika's sex, eliciting a gasp from her captive.
  Her hands began to trace circles around Erika's sex, never entering the truly
  sensitive part of Erika's crotch, but still coming maddeningly close to it.
  The caress was in fact almost worse than a direct contact. Almost. Erika was
  not prepared when she felt the tip of a fingernail skimming her nether lips.
  She gasped. She fought her bonds. She tried to pull away from that disturbing
  touch. But the sleeves on her straitjacket did not budge. The cuffs on her
  ankles subdued any struggle. She was totally exposed to that woman. And the
  assault on her senses went on. 
The fingernails came back, lightly touching the skin of her folds. The effect
  was an unbearable tickling sensation. Unwillingly, Erika was becoming aroused.
  Her mind told her it was utterly wrong, her body told her it felt good. She
  lifted her head from the pillow on which it was resting. She gazed down her
  body. And she encountered Vanessa's gaze who was intently watching her reaction,
  a devilish grin on her lips. 
�So, my little one. I see you react to the appetizers� Let's see how you handle
  the main course�' 
Vanessa bowed her head, gently blowing on Erika's sex. The weak wind combined
  to the light touch of fingernails was sapping Erika's resistance. Exhausted,
  her mind in turmoil, she leant back into the pillow and waited for whatever
  came her way. 
The cycle of skimming and blowing continued for a few minutes. Just as Erika
  was getting accustomed to it, she felt a new sensation. The fingers were gone.
  But something had taken their place. Something warm, soft, wet and a bit rough
  was gently grazing her love lips. At the same time, the small air current she
  felt shifted. It was warmer and directed a bit higher than before. She assimilated
  those tidbits of information after a few seconds. Vanessa had gone through
  her legs with her head� She was licking her. She could feel the tongue circling
  her lips. She could feel it gently easing itself in her snatch. The sensation
  was even more maddening than those before. She felt herself getting wetter.
  Her clitoris was poking its head out of its hood. But Vanessa was decidedly
  avoiding it. She was concentrating on her now engorged lips. She was very slightly
  easing the tip of her tongue between her lips. Erika moaned. She wanted that
  sensual torture to stop, but her body thought otherwise. Her carnal urges were
  getting more and more intense. She whimpered. The sensations were enough to
  trigger a strong arousal, but would never allow her to reach the climax that
  she now wanted, that she now craved. She was bucking her hips, trying to direct
  the tongue onto her clitoris. But Vanessa was wickedly anticipating her moves
  and she continued to taunt Erika's now sopping sex. She wanted Erika totally
  vulnerable, totally open to her. And Erika responded. She was now panting behind
  her ball-gag. She was bucking her hips, trying to grind them on Vanessa's tongue.
  She wanted that climax she had been denied. 
Vanessa was circling her clit, avoiding direct contact. Its tip was protruding
  from under its hood, now fully erect. She decided her captive now deserved
  that orgasm. She kissed Vanessa's clitoris. She then played with it using the
  tip of her tongue. She flicked her tongue across it. It was now so sensitive
  Erika felt that touch like an electric shock. And the licking resumed, only
  this time, her clit was included in the ministrations. She could feel it building.
  She was now powerless to prevent the orgasm she wanted but despised at the
  same time. She could feel Vanessa's tongue starting at the underside of her
  pussy, making its way upward to her clit and then flicking over it, gently
  playing with it. At the same time, she felt Vanessa's fingernails gently caressing
  the sensitive area between her pussy and her anus. It provoked contractions
  in her belly, pleasant jolts of excitement coursing through her. 
Vanessa concentrated her tongue's attentions on Erika's clitoris. She slipped
  one of her slender finger into the welcoming wet and hungry hole, probing for
  Erika's G-spot. She was soon massaging a place inside her vagina, while her
  other hand was still busy caressing the underside of her pussy. 
Erika's orgasm happened suddenly, unexpectedly and violently. She bucked her
  hips and screamed into her gag. Her release was one of the most debilitating
  she had ever known. She was spent! It had only lasted for a few minutes but
  she felt as exhausted as a marathon runner. While she settled into the afterglow,
  she became aware that Vanessa had not stopped to play with her. Soon, her arousal
  was once again mounting. The stimulation of her clitoris and G-spot forced
  a second orgasm out of her after a very short time. Vanessa then stopped her
  ministrations, her face glowing with Erika's juices but presenting a mischievous
  grin that promised more fun to come� 
Erika's straitjacket-teddy was now soaked. The room was not very warm, but
  her exertions had caused her to build up a considerable sweat. 
�Well, my little one. You seemed to enjoy it, didn't you? After such exercises,
  I think a shower is in order. I will take it with you. Why waste water? And
  why waste such a good time to play? I am going to free you from your straitjacket.
  But do not do anything rash. If I cannot control you my guards will. And believe
  me, you do not want to learn what they can do to control you� Now be a good
  girl and stay still.' 
She went to the cupboard from which she had taken the ball-gag and came back
  with a leather choker and a leash. After affixing the collar around Erika's
  neck, she clasped the leash to a ring at the front of the collar. She then
  went to Erika's ankles and undid her shackles. She helped her to her feet and
  guided her to a small door leading to a well furnished bathroom. 
She placed Erika in the centre of the room and detailed her appearance. 
�My, my, my� You are even more beautiful than I remember� And you have a very
  nice pussy to play with� I like the pet variety of pussies, but yours is even
  more fun to play with�' 
She went behind Erika and undid the clasps holding the sleeves in place. Erika
  unfolded her arms and massaged them, savouring the sensation of returning feeling
  to her limbs. Behind her, Vanessa was still busy. She was undoing the laces
  closing the straitjacket. Soon, Erika was free from its confines. The leather
  collar was next, but the gag remained in place. 
�Well, time for shower!' proclaimed Vanessa, pushing her into a spacious shower-cabin.
  She let her gown slip from her frame and followed her captive into the shower.
  Once inside, she directed Erika to the middle of the cabin and instructed her
  to put her feet into two depressions in the floor. Exhausted by her reluctant
  exercises in the bedroom, she complied slowly. Once her feet were in those
  depressions, she felt them sinking deeper, while two metal pieces encircled
  their upper side, thus preventing any movement. Vanessa then took a pair of
  handcuffs sitting on a stand carved in the wall and clasped them around Erika's
  wrists. 
�Good� Let's get busy, my dear�' 
Vanessa took the shower nozzle and began to spray water all around her own
  body. She then came to her prisoner and clang to her, spraying water on both
  of them. Once they were both wet, she took a bottle of liquid soap and poured
  some in her hands before coming back to her now wide-eyed shower-companion. 
�Since your hands are a bit tied up right now, I guess I will have to wash
  you myself� Not that I mind� In fact I would dare say you are the one minding�' 
She went behind Erika and began to caress her body with her soap-filled hands.
  Her ministrations were gentle, but she seemed to longer more than reasonably
  around Erika's groin. Her fingers were parting her nether lips, playing with
  the little bud, which was rapidly becoming once again erect. Erika moaned into
  her gag. But before she could achieve an orgasm, Vanessa stopped and, taking
  the nozzle, sprayed her with water, washing the soap away. She then applied
  soap to her own body, before rinsing. 
Once she was done, she stepped out of the shower, leaving Erika alone for
  a few minutes, before returning, clad in a delicate pink satin nightgown. She
  pressed a button on the wall and Erika's feet were freed from their confinement. 
She took a towel and dried Erika before leading her back into the bedroom,
  still handcuffed and still naked. She helped her captive settle down on the
  bed, before joining her on it. 
Reclining against the pillows, she began to talk. 
�I am sure you have a great many questions to ask. I will explain a few things
  which should coincide with the main interrogations you should have. 
I had you abducted because from the moment I saw you I became obsessed by
  you. I studied you; I gathered intelligence about you, hoping to discover a
  fault in you. But I found none. I find you exquisitely beautiful, and everything
  I could find about you confirmed you were intelligent, sensitive and sensible. 
I will leave you a choice. I want you to decide if you want to remain at my
  side. I know this sounds funny, but I had to have you, if only for a day� 
If you refuse to stay with me, you will receive a treatment that will erase
  your memories and you will go on with your life as if nothing happened. However,
  if you decide to stay� I will give you everything you could ever wish. There
  are things I want to share with you. Things I want you to see� Perhaps in due
  time will you forgive me for what I did� It was simply infatuation�' 
Erika was watching her intently, trying to decide if she was completely barking
  mad or if, maybe, she was sincere in that declaration. And as she was observing
  her, she could see tears forming in the eyes facing her. She was sincere. All
  that had been caused by Vanessa's passion. She had not done it because of meanness
  but because of passion. As Erika was reflecting on it, something became clear.
  She could always refuse her later. That woman was only preoccupied by her welfare.
  True, she had had her abducted, but it was out of desire for her. She couldn't
  simply ignore that fact. She was brought back to her senses, when she felt
  Vanessa's hands undoing the straps holding her gag in place. She stretched
  her jaws a bit, enjoying the returning sensation. Vanessa's face was level
  with hers, her eyes watery and full of fear. 
�What do you decide?' 
Erika did not utter a word. She just leaned towards Vanessa's face and kissed
  her lightly, gently. That woman had wanted her. She had not hurt her in any
  way. In fact she had even given her pleasure, demanding nothing in exchange
  except her presence. It was something that could not be ignored. She broke
  the kiss. 
�I will stay with you. I cannot promise I will stay with you forever, but
  I will stay with you for the time being�' 
Vanessa straightened up, her face the picture of joy. 
�Very well� I could not have asked any more. I will have to explain you a
  few things though� Like for example how I could capture you� In fact it is
  all due to a group I am part of� The Madam Moriarty Club�' 
What is exactly that club? What awaits Erika in Vanessa's company? Is everything
  so idyllic? Or is there something sinister going on? 
You want to find out dear reader. Well I hope you do. Because I am not finished
  with our two beauties. That part was a soft one. The coming parts will not
  be as gentle. And they will be much kinkier! 
See you soon! As always, appreciation, comments, suggestions are welcome!
