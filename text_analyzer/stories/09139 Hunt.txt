&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Erin stood out in their backyard, her skin flushed red from embarrassment. She was dressed in the skimpiest �bunny� costume she had ever seen; a white, fishnet teddy with a white bunny ears headband, white nylon stockings and an uncomfortable fluffy little cottontail.&nbsp; But the costume was the least of her worries.&nbsp; Also part of her costume was a pair of white leather cuffs around her ankles, another pair of cuffs holding her wrists behind her back, a white leather collar and a neon pink ballgag fastened tightly in her mouth.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It wasn�t that Erin didn�t look stunning in her costume.&nbsp; She did.&nbsp; She kept her five foot frame trim by working out every week at the gym with her husband Kyle. She had a nice pair of C-cup breasts and a well rounded ass.&nbsp; Her auburn hair was kept in a cute pageboy cute and her blue-green cat-like eyes made her look almost pixie-like.&nbsp; She didn�t mind turning heads, just not like this. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her husband Kyle stood on the porch and waved at her.&nbsp; He was holding the remote that would activate the small egg vibrator inside her.&nbsp; He was still dressed in his flannel drawers and red plaid robe.&nbsp; He wasn�t much taller than Erin was, but he was a bit stockier in build.&nbsp; His blondish hair was still in spiky mess from last night and his brown eyes almost sparkled with mischief. He sipped casually at his mug of morning coffee and grinned.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The game was simple.&nbsp; It was a version of �hotter-colder�.&nbsp; The closer she got to where a colored egg was hidden, the lower her vibe would hum.&nbsp; He had told her that there were more than three dozen plastic Easter eggs hidden in their fenced-in back yard.&nbsp; Only one would fit the lock that would open the back garage door and let her inside.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The egg vibrator inside her roared on and caused a rush of pleasure to gush through her.&nbsp; The game was on.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Oh, by the way honey,� Kyle said as Erin looked around to spot some spot of color, �If you happen to cum while back here, you�re spending the rest of the day in back like you are.�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Erin moaned her protests but she knew they fell on deaf ears.&nbsp; She focused her attentions on finding the eggs.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were a few eggs she spotted right away in their tulip beds and she hopped the best she could over to them.&nbsp; Kyle at least had the decency to let her wear her sneakers.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As she jumped, Erin�s tail was becoming erotically uncomfortable. She didn�t know where he had got it, but the little ball of fluff on her ass was attached to a slender plug in her ass.&nbsp; With every hop, she could feel both the vibrator and the anal plug moving inside her, causing more ripples of bliss.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The vibrator slowed and then stopped as she reached the raised bed where the tulips had already started to bud and blossom.&nbsp; She sat herself down on the bed�s brick wall, making she her tail wasn�t going to impale her some more, and reached around and picked up the egg, shaking it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Honey,� Kyle called, �You might want to open it just to make sure.�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Erin grunted and rolled her eyes upward.&nbsp; She struggled to open the egg and finally when it was opened, she saw the reason why.&nbsp; Her husband had suspended in some gelatin a penny inside.&nbsp; He had first filled half the egg, put the coin in, drilled a small hole in the top of the egg and after it was fastened together, he filled the rest of the egg with the same gelatin. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Damn him.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She scooted down a little further to a blue egg and again, found a penny floating in the clear gelatin.&nbsp; She found two other eggs in the bed before her vibrator started to buzz vigorously again.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Erin got up to hop towards the lilacs planted along their tall wooden fence, she thought back to last night and how this started so innocently.&nbsp; Kyle had said that he had a surprise for her this Easter and if she wanted it, she would have to do as he said.&nbsp; Erin reluctantly agreed, knowing that it would probably involve some sort of bondage.&nbsp; They had been into it even before they got married and their fascination with leather and rope never went away.&nbsp; In fact, they both came up with new ways in which to play their games.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A wave of rapture flooded through Erin and she had to stop.&nbsp; She was sure that Kyle had heard her, if not the neighbors next door.&nbsp; It was still very early in the morning and she hoped to find the key before it became too late.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few more hops along the blossoming lilacs, the vibrator slowed.&nbsp; Erin thanked God, since she didn�t know if she could have staved off an orgasm.&nbsp; As it was, it continued to tease her, keeping her kettle warm.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She saw the purple egg and her humming companion stopped.&nbsp; Awkwardly, she squatted down a retrieved the egg, only to find another penny.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Kyle watched his wife hopping around the yard searching, his morning boner continued to ache.&nbsp; It had never gone away.&nbsp; From the moment he got out of bed and presented his wife with her �Easter Best� to when she came out of the bathroom wearing it to watching her struggling to find the key before she gave in to her passion, his erection never fully went away.&nbsp; All he really wanted to do is carry her inside and make love to her.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, he didn�t dare do it.&nbsp; That was the deliciousness of their games.&nbsp; The Waiting and wanting made the ending that much more intense.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His wife hopped away from the lilacs and he cranked the vibrator on high.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Erin stopped, swooning as another billow of bliss ballooned within her.&nbsp; The pleasure swelled and stormed as she bit into her gag hard as she moaned.&nbsp; Like a head of steam, her passion continued to build and threatened to engulf her and she knew it would if she didn�t get hopping.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ebb and flow of the vibrators ministrations continued to keep Erin on edge as she searched.&nbsp; To her dismay, she found the some of the eggs were camouflaged and blended in with the lawn and foliage.&nbsp; She had meant to keep track of the eggs she found but she soon gave up.&nbsp; Her ever growing need clouded her thinking.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was hopping out in the middle of the lawn when she kicked an egg and the vibrator stopped.&nbsp; She knelt again and opened he green mottled egg.&nbsp; In there was the key.&nbsp; Quickly she rubbed the gel off, smiling around her gag.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just then he turned the vibrator on high.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The blistering-hot ecstasy exploded with in her and she collapsed on the grass and writhed as the pleasure completely engulfed her.&nbsp; She bucked and screamed and contorted herself as her rapture tormented her again and again until she was too weak to do much else than drool and moan.&nbsp; When her vibrator stopped, she opened her eyes to find her husband standing over her.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Now that you have the key, honey, I�ll be waiting for you inside. There is another treat that I need to put in your basket and it can�t wait too much longer.�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Erin watched her husband walk back to the house, open the sliding glass door and locking it after him.&nbsp; Weakly she uncoiled herself and with difficulty, got back on her feet.&nbsp; Still holding the key, she hopped towards the garage.&nbsp; This was one treat she really didn�t want to miss.
