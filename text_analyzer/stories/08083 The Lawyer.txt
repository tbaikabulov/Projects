The Lawyer





It was Friday afternoon, and Mike was working on

some cost estimates when he looked up from his

office desk in the corner of the barn where he stored

construction materials and equipment.&nbsp; The clothes

were like a man's, dark pinstripe jacket with

shoulder pads and lapels, trousers, white shirt and

striped tie.&nbsp; The contents were distinctly female,

wide hips, crimson lipstick, a delicately boned face

with shortish, wavy black hair, black pumps with

inch-high heels.&nbsp; He guessed she was in her thirties,

probably twenty pounds heavier than she had been in

high school but still slender and fit for her age.&nbsp; She

wore no rings.&nbsp; "I'm Cera Carlin," she said, "your

wife's divorce lawyer."



He stood, and noted she was almost as tall as he

was.&nbsp; "Please take a seat.&nbsp; I'll be with you in a

moment."



"Mr. Cowley, I charge by the hour, and you are

going to end up paying my bills.&nbsp; Perhaps you should

speak to me now."



"Speak."



"I'm here to go over your books for the last three

years, prior to the formal discovery process to

establish the worth of your assets."



Mike pressed a button to summon Brenda-Sue, his

secretary and book keeper.&nbsp; "I've agreed to alimony

and child support, even for the one which isn't mine. 

What does she care about Cowley Construction

Company?"



"Mr. Cowley, last year you were offered nearly 4

million dollars for your company by Prestige

Development, and you laughed them off.&nbsp; You must

value your company at more than 4 million.&nbsp; This is

a community property state, so your wife is entitled

to half of the marital assets.&nbsp; You will owe her at

least 2 million dollars, maybe more, depending on

what I find in your financial records."



"I don't have that sort of money."



"The court will order the business sold, and half the

proceeds will go to your wife."



"That's stupid.&nbsp; If you destroy the business I've

spent fifteen years building, I won't have an income,

so how can I pay alimony and child support?&nbsp; What

about my 47 workers?&nbsp; They'll be out of work, and

since they are non-union, Prestige won't hire them. 

They just want me gone, to eliminate competition."



"That's not my concern, Mr. Cowley."



"Maybe it should be," said Brenda-Sue, who had

moved up behind Cera Carlin.&nbsp; "You know the

difference between a rooster and a lawyer?&nbsp; The

rooster clucks defiance!&nbsp; You want to screw my

boss and the rest of us who work here.&nbsp; You know

what my motto is?&nbsp; Do unto others as they would do

unto you, and do it to them first."&nbsp; Brenda-Sue was

half Black and half Hispanic, and she weighted about

260 pounds.&nbsp; She grabbed the lawyer's arms from

behind in a vice-like grip and easily lifted her a few

inches off the floor.



"Good idea, Brenda-Sue."&nbsp; Mike stepped up to the

frightened lawyer and calmly removed her tie.&nbsp; Then

he unbuttoned&nbsp; the collar and the rest of the buttons

down the front of the shirt.&nbsp; With a yank, he peeled

the shirt back to expose Cera's expensive bra. 

Another yank left the bra up around Cera's neck. 

Her breasts hung free, not bad but not the perky tits

of a teen-age chick nor the firm melons of an 

augmented bust.&nbsp; "I think law schools exist to

provide conscience-ectomies.&nbsp; How else can you

explain this bitch's disregard for other people?&nbsp; She

needs a lesson in humility."



"I'm only representing my client the best I can,"

protested Cera, who could not believe this man had

the audacity to bare her breasts like that.



"Do unto others," said Brenda-Sue.&nbsp; She put Cera

back on her feet but twisted her arm around behind

her and walked the slender lawyer across the dirty

floor to a work bench upon which was mounted a

huge wooden vice.&nbsp; It was holding a door to be

planed, but Mike saw what Brenda-Sue had in mind,

and he cranked open the jaws of the vice and

removed the door.&nbsp; Brenda-Sue lifted the twisted

arm until Cera Carlin was bent over at the waist,

with her breasts hanging down between the jaws of

the vice.&nbsp; Mike turned the screw and compressed the

lawyer's tits in the vice.&nbsp; "Ow!&nbsp; You're hurting me!" 

Mike cranked a couple more turns, to make sure

Cera was firmly secured.&nbsp; Brenda-Sue released the

arm and began to pull the jacket back and off Cera's

shoulders.&nbsp; The lawyer, less than half Brenda-Sue's

size, couldn't resist, as the book keeper methodically

undressed her.&nbsp; The jacket came off, and the shirt,

and the bra.&nbsp; Then Brenda-Sue slid the pants down,

revealing cotton panties and knee-high stockings. 

She took the panties and left the lawyer her

stockings and shoes.



Cera Carlin pounded her fists on the work bench and

lashed out with her feet, trying to kick someone. 

Brenda-Sue simply used duct tape to fasten the legal

ankles far apart, taped to the lower rail of the table. 

That left her victim with her bottom uppermost and

thrust out behind, as her feet were now forward of

her center of gravity.&nbsp; Cera had to hold onto the vice

and pull or the tendency to fall backward would

almost tear her tits off.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pleased with her work,

Brenda-Sue left a pink hand print on each upraised

buttock.



"Page some of the guys," said Mike.&nbsp; "If she's going

to screw them, it's only fair..."&nbsp; He undid his belt

and freed his erect penis, ready for action and 8

inches long.&nbsp; The lawyer wasn't prepared to find the

tip of his tool sliding up and down her exposed

vulva, bumping her clitoris with every stroke. 

"That's it, Ms. Carlin, loosen up a bit and get wet. 

You might as well enjoy what's coming to you."



"You can't get away with this.&nbsp; I'll see the bunch of

you in jail!"



"Just watch," said Mike, as he eased the bulbous

head of his penis into the yielding pinkness of Cera's

cunt.&nbsp; She was no virgin, but she hadn't had a date

in more than two years, and she'd never had it from

behind.&nbsp; She gasped as Mike's member thrust into

her, and he bounced on his toes, stretching her

vagina and pounding on a G-spot she never knew

she had.&nbsp; His belly mashed her buttocks as his huge

organ filled and stretched her as she'd never been

filled before.&nbsp; He was relentless, and soon she was

gasping and grasping at the rough wood of the work

bench and groaning and moving her hips as if to

accentuate the pounding penetration of Mike's

penis.&nbsp; "Uuuungh!" she moaned, and her vaginal

walls clamped down on Mike's meat.&nbsp; He shot his

semen deep inside her and pulled out.



George and Harry were standing by.&nbsp; George went

first, sliding easily into the well lubricated sheath and

going slap, slap, slap against her ass until he shot his

wad too.&nbsp; Harry was right behind him, and then John

Smithson, the carpenter, and John Jenkins, his new

apprentice.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cera Carlin forgot the pain in her

breasts, even as they were crushed by the vice and

stretched by her writhing motions as she was raped

over and over again.&nbsp; Sixteen construction workers

had their way with her, and then half a dozen more

came in, to get their pay checks, and they stayed to

get their rocks off at Ms. Carlin's expense.&nbsp; A

sizeable puddle of semen accumulated on the floor,

and more was spread over her back and buns and

inner thighs.&nbsp; Cera Carlin was wasted, hardly able to

support herself, but forced to, lest her tits be pulled

off.&nbsp; "Now, it's my turn," said Brenda-Sue.&nbsp; "Don't

forget to wash her out well," said Mike.&nbsp; "We don't

want any DNA evidence left inside her."



It was nearly an hour later when Mike looked up

from his desk and saw Cera Carlin standing there

again.&nbsp; She was dressed in the pumps and pin-stripe

trousers and jacket, just as before, but her shirt was

unbuttoned almost to the waist, and her bra was

missing.&nbsp; "Mr. Cowley," she said, "I'm sure we can

work out some way for you to keep your company. 

It can't be in my client's best interest to bankrupt

you."&nbsp; He smiled and said, "I'm glad to see you have

changed your views."&nbsp; She smiled back and said,

"Same time next week?"



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [end]&nbsp;&nbsp;
