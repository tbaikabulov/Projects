Escape from the Dungeons &#8211; 8/12/08

It took three strong men to hold her still, despite her being chained hand and foot. She had been brought to the Regent&#8217;s study, but within minutes she had kicked one man so hard that he had been sent to the infirmary. So more guards were summoned and while three held her down she was tied harshly with rope so that she could not move. She was hauled up again, and a guard hit her hard in the stomach.
�Is she ready for judgement, Sergeant?� the Regent asked. He was a thin, pale and vicious looking man.
�Yes, sir! Little hellcat was caught by our army. They had to put her in a cage the whole way!�
�I see. Do you have anything to say, woman?�
She looked back disdainfully. �I have nothing to say to something like you.�
The Regent&#8217;s eyes narrowed. �You don&#8217;t seem to grasp the seriousness of your situation. Being a rebel is treason, and I could have you executed for that.�
The rebel stayed silent.
�Impudent Amazon! Take her to the dungeons and hurt her. Do not destroy her beauty or stop her ability to make love�I will gladly make this one my personal slave. Move!�
The Amazon, tall, strong and brave, was dragged away. She fought, but the mass of ropes and chains held her as the men carried her away.

The dungeon was an underground chamber of sinister appearance. When the guards dragged the prisoner in she saw she was not alone. A pretty blonde girl of extraordinary appearance was fastened to a lethal chair which was bolted to the floor. She had been gagged, but her eyes followed the prisoner as she was dragged in.
�Put her on the rack,� the leader said.
It was easier said than done, for the Amazon was waiting for any chance to fight back. So to prevent this the men took turns at hitting her while she was helpless. Blow after blow hit her until even the proud warrior was only standing with the support of her captors.
�Quickly!�
They grabbed her and pushed her onto the rack, the huge slab of stone laying at a forty-five degree angle. Before the Amazon was fully recovered the four men held her down with all their strength and forced her hands into the shackles. She tried to fight, but with four against one she soon had her ankles and wrists securely fastened and taut against the stone. She was in an X shape, wrists and ankles fastened to the four corners.
�Take the gag off that one. Let&#8217;s go get the torturer.�
The gag was removed from her fellow prisoner, and the two women were left helplessly alone, and both totally naked.

�I&#8217;m Chesna�who are you?� the girl in the chair asked.
�Melisande, but call me Mel. Have they hurt you much yet?�
�No. They said they were waiting for a special occasion,� Chesna replied unhappily. She struggled a little, but made no impact on the leather straps and chains that bound her.
�I&#8217;m sorry if I am that special occasion.� She peered closer. �Are you an elf?�
�Technically yes,� Chesna replied. �You wouldn&#8217;t believe the truth.�
�Try me�I&#8217;ve got nothing better to do,� Mel said grimly.
�Well, I&#8217;m actually a demi-goddess who has no believers. Or rather, my mother was a deity, I was her daughter, but she died. So I&#8217;m sort of left alive as an oddity.�
�I don&#8217;t suppose you have any celestial firestorms to get us out of here?�
Chesna tried to shake her head, but it was quite impossible. �Afraid not. The only thing I got was a few minor abilities left over &#8211; none of them can break solid steel though.�
�Have they�taken�you yet?� Mel asked. �How long have you been in this place?�
�Yes, they have &#8216;taken&#8217; me, if you mean have they raped me,� Chesna said. She shrugged as much as she could. �Fortunately, I have a special immunity there to whatever nastiness might result from it. How long have I been here? It&#8217;s hard to tell when you don&#8217;t see light, but I think about a month.
�And they haven&#8217;t tortured you?� Mel asked suspiciously.
�Why would they? I&#8217;m obedient and am good at what I do. I fear they&#8217;ll save it up for you�or me as emotional blackmail.�
�Meaning?� Mel asked.
�Meaning that they&#8217;ll hurt me to try and make you talk. They were mentioning some of the wonderful features of this chair.�
Mel jerked on her chains. �I�I can&#8217;t talk.� She saw Chesna&#8217;s anxious face. �But I can&#8217;t see you get hurt either.� She wondered if Chesna was actually a spy. It was possible.

And further discussion was cut short as the cell door opened and a tall, weaselly man entered alone. He looked at his two captives and licked his lips. �This is more like it. No more old grannies and crippled men. This is the real stuff. Please excuse me, I&#8217;m just going to light my braziers.
As he busied himself with lighting the coals and stoking up some very nasty looking metal tools, the captives shared a glance. Mel yanked at her chains, tried to slip her wrists out, tried everything.
�Eager to start, are we?� the torturer asked. �I am Carlos�and we&#8217;ll get to know each other very well,� he said, running a hand up Mel&#8217;s body. She shuddered and tried to pull away. �Feisty one�but there&#8217;s no escape, slave. You can be a good girl like the bitch in the chair, or you can be a defiant slut and get hurt. I&#8217;ve been ordered not to maim you or stop you performing for his Lordship. So I&#8217;ll just have to be careful.�
�What do you want?� Mel asked.
His hand gently stroked her muscled torso. �Well, his Lordship wants information from you. You Amazons are irritating him like bugs. And like bugs we will squash you when we catch you. Now, you can tell us�or you can choose not to. In that case I will hurt you and let him deal with you. He always gives up on his playthings after a few days and sends them down here again. The second time there&#8217;s no escape. So be easy on yourself�tell me, and you&#8217;ll survive like the other one there.�
Mel looked from one to the other.
�The clock is ticking. Here&#8217;s a reminder.� Carlos went to the side of the rack and turned a crank. 
Instantly, Mel felt herself being stretched. At first it was painless, and then it began to hurt. Then it got worse, and she stifled a cry. She felt very literally as if her body was being torn apart. The pressure relaxed.
�See how easy it is for me to hurt you? Tell me what I want to know or else.�
Mel&#8217;s conscience burned her. She stayed silent. The pressure came again, worse this time.
�There are consequences for your actions, slut. But you think that you&#8217;re safe from the real stuff so long as you&#8217;re wanted by the boss. But will your conscience be clear if I torture your friend here?�
Carlos walked casually over to Chesna&#8217;s chair. �This chair is quite a triumph�I can do so many things to her and you can&#8217;t stop me.�
Mel, with the rack still stretching her, started to cry.
�That&#8217;s right�shed a tear as I do this.� Carlos said. He wandered over to his brazier and selected a glowing piece of iron and advanced on Chesna. �Tell me or I use this on her.�
Chesna struggled helplessly as the brand got closer and closer.
�Stop! I&#8217;ll tell you what you want. Don&#8217;t hurt her,� Mel called.
�Such a shame�I&#8217;d hoped I could make her scream a bit first. But do continue.� As he spoke he slowly unbuttoned his pants.
�What are you�no!� Mel said, looking at her naked captor. The rack still had her stretched, and she could do nothing as he walked triumphantly towards her. 
�All this flesh makes me quite desirous of a little comfort�.� He relaxed the rack&#8217;s tension�maybe to make his fun that little more exciting from her struggles.
Mel shuddered as he climbed onto the winch at the bottom of the rack and aimed himself at her pussy. She felt revolted and angry�so angry that she felt she&#8217;d scream!
Carlos looked totally unworried, and gently placed his penis inside her, in preparation for a little fun.
�No!� Mel screamed and yanked with all her might.
It was then that something extremely unexpected happened. For decades the unfortunate had been taken to these cells and put on the same terrible devices and hurt. Some things moved with the time, but others did not. Chain virtually lasted forever, but there was one weak link. Just one out of hundreds that secured Melisande to her torment. Over the years the continued stretching, changes in temperature and rubbing against the granite slab had critically weakened a single link. When Mel gave that enraged, futile yank it finally snapped and her right hand was free!
With the speed of a hungry snake Mel&#8217;s hand caught the torturer around the throat and closed sickeningly on his windpipe.
Mel had not thought once during the exchange, but now she lessened her grip just enough to keep her captor alive�for now. �Be quiet�don&#8217;t struggle, or I&#8217;ll crush your throat.�
�What�want?� Carlos said, trying to breathe.
�Where are the keys? Answer�I will not hesitate to kill you, no matter what happens next.�
Carlos reached for his belt, but instead drew out a baton which he intended to beat her with.
Mel saw it and jerked the torturer forward so that his head impacted the stone table with a crack. The nightstick fell from his hand and he slumped. Mel hauled him up one handed and looked frantically at his belt.
�The keys are on the table, Mel,� Chesna said quietly.
�What? No!� Mel said, letting the man slump. In desperation she yanked with both hands at her bound wrist, but eventually relaxed. �I&#8217;ll not let them capture me again!� Mel said, looking around for some weapon, or anything sharp with which she could kill herself. She realised that if she was caught again they would not hesitate to torture her to death for her temerity.

�Mel, I want you to look at me,� Chesna said.
Mel, her bravado gone, and now trembling, did so.
�Mel, I need you to remain calm. Do not say a word. We are going to escape, but I need your help. Do not move or speak�I need to concentrate like I have never had to.�
With that Chesna closed her eyes. Mel wandered what she was doing, and went back to jerking on her wrist so that soon the skin around it was chafed and raw. She turned back and saw a miracle. The heavy iron key-ring was lifting into the air and floating slowly towards Chesna&#8217;s hand. Her face was locked in concentration, and she was sweating with the strain.
Finally, she took them in her hand. �Got it! Are you ready, Mel?�
�Ready?�
�I can&#8217;t reach the locks on my wrists. My telekinesis isn&#8217;t good enough to do such a fiddly job. You must catch this when I throw it. If you don&#8217;t, then it&#8217;s over�not wanting to pressure you!�
There was a groan from the torturer, but he didn&#8217;t wake.
�I&#8217;m ready,� Mel said.
With limited room to move, Chesna carefully measured the distance and threw. It was hard, as she had to throw them without being able to aim properly.
Even so, they sailed across the room, and Mel managed to catch a handful of keys and clench them tightly.
�See the shiny key with the three engraved circles on it? I think that is the one he used.�
Mel tried it and to her utter relief she found that the key turned and her other arm was free! Swiftly she leant down and managed, after a few uncomfortable moments, to get both her ankles free.
That done, Mel hurried over to Chesna and undid the tight straps while looking for the keys to the metal bands that held her wrists and ankles to the chair. She finally found them and undid them.
Chesna jumped up and hugged the taller, stronger Amazon. �Good job. What about him though?� she asked.
Mel walked over to the shelves and pulled out a long knife.
�That&#8217;s not what I meant. I don&#8217;t want him killed.� Chesna saw that her new friend clearly intended to regardless of the moralism. �Leaving him alive will be more punishment, as they&#8217;ll deal with him.�
Mel hesitated, knife poised, and then nodded. �Help me get him into the chair.�
This was done quickly, and Mel dropped the key to the chair&#8217;s locks into a brazier and pushed it to the core with an iron.

�What now? The guards will come looking soon.�
�Fortunately, I can help there. Do you trust me, Mel?� Chesna asked.
�After what you did today, I&#8217;d trust you with my life.�
�Let&#8217;s hope it doesn&#8217;t come to this. I have an ability that allows me to teleport�to cross the planar bounds. Unfortunately, I can&#8217;t control it &#8211; we might never come back to this world again.�
�I do not understand your words. Is it magic?�
�Yes. I&#8217;m a demi-goddess, remember? Though, that&#8217;s not the reason I have it, to be honest. More of a reward from the god Aurelius. But anyway, I have to be free to use it, unless I wanted to be torn apart in the vortex!�
�I don&#8217;t understand what you mean.� There was the sounds of footsteps and the key turning in the lock. �But we must do it!�
�Take my hand then!� Chesna cried. The two naked prisoners clasped hands as the guards rushed in�and vanished from the dungeons, the castle and the very planet where they had been. Chesna and Melisande were off on an adventure that would take them from heaven to hell and many lands in between. All in search of a way home, and a port of safety.

Carlos came to, and found he couldn&#8217;t move. He couldn&#8217;t speak or see either, and he realised with horror that he was locked in the very chair that he had imprisoned.
The blindfold came off and he found himself staring at his employer, the Regent.
�Pathetic,� the Regent said. �I give you two chained, helpless slaves and they escape without a trace and trounce you! I wanted that Amazon�and the other slave was an obedient immortal which I can tell you is not common! And they beat you.�
Carlos tried to speak, but the leather pad and straps around his mouth stopped him.
�Well, your replacement needs practice�so goodbye. I won&#8217;t say it&#8217;s been a pleasure.� With that the Regent turned and left with his guards.
Into the dungeon walked a pretty young girl who looked barely more than twenty. She smiled at Carlos and drew a very sharp knife.
�Time to play�.�
