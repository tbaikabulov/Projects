Welcome

Firstly, let me thanks you quickly for reading my personal notes on this story, I hope I won&#8217;t bore you too quickly.


What should I expect from this story?
This story is slow. I mean it. It takes 40+ pages to get to the first sex scene. It takes it time to introduce the Sci-Fi setting and the characters. The first two chapters are more or less only about introduction of world and characters.

However, fear not kinky friends. There will be sex, there will be loads of imaginative sex scenes as well as drama between the characters.


What sexual themes should I expect from this story?
Well. To my friends I usually describe this project as Harry Potter meets Strawberry Panic meets Kushiel&#8217;s Dart meets my kinky imagination. If you don&#8217;t know what any of the first three of those are, wikipedia is your friend :)

The story theme is more or less exclusively lesbian. It is set in a school for girls destined to become courtesans. Hierarchies are strict and they are trained to become sociable, likeable escorts that you will enjoy at the dinner table or in the tea room just as much as they are trained to become masters of the carnal pleasures second only to the gods themselves.

24/7 DS themes are abundant. Sadomasochistic themes are light and there is very little non-consensual sex in the story (however a lot of it starts out as reluctant).


You said the setting is SciFi, what can you tell us about that?
Basically, it is on the earth in 200 years. A lot has changed geopolitically and the story takes place in the India. There are three superpowers in the world at the moment. They are The People&#8217;s Republic of China, a semi-democratic country ruled by a singular governing party but that allows grass root democracy among its people. It is considered to have the mightiest military in the world.

The second is the Nation of the rising sun, Japan. Japan has conquered most of Oceania as well as South Korea and it has more or less annexed Australia by making it economically dependent on Japan. 

Lastly, we have the Indian Commonwealth, a theocratic authoritarian state that rules its citizens by the help of a highly sophisticated Artificial Intelligence known as Kalki. It is widely believed that this machine truly is the last incarnation of the god Vishnu that will bring peace and prosperity to the realm by ending the Kali Yuga, the age of Darkness and Destruction. He came to be in the middle of the third world war between Muslim religious extremists and the Euro-American alliance while the rest of the world suffered more than a decade of global economic depression.

The history books tell us this. While the world suffered its worst economic crash in history as the continuous warfare ravaged the globe, a charismatic priest named Alok declared that the age of Darkness and Destruction would end due to Kalki&#8217;s arrival. It took Kalki a matter of ten years to reorganize the country and bring corruption inside the government to a grinding halt and prosperity to countryside and city alike.

When the war ended, the Islamic world had been reduced to rubble, America had split into six different nations. Europe stood in flames from rampant civil unrest combined with them taking the brunt of the terrorist attacks. Several French, German and UK cities had been exposed to dirty bombs. London and Barcelona, Naples and Cannes and Krakow had been levelled by atom bombs. The Islamic world on its end had suffered even worse. Systematic carpet bombings and several hydrogen bombs were dropped. At the end, even the cities were no longer off limits for the bombing planes.

India took its chance to adopt the more or less all of the Middle East, the southern parts of the Arabic peninsula as well as the horn of Africa. The citizens that were left in these war torn and ravaged countries were offered shelter, food and a promise to make their homes whole again. But on one condition, all the citizens must respect the Hindu traditions, adhere to the rule of Kalki and the theocratic council and obey the dictates of their own caste.

With the Islamic clergy&#8217;s power base gone and the clergy in it self more or less non-existent, mass conversions ensued. Getting out of the bomb-wrecked homes into safety proved to be a stronger motivation than religion for most people. The others were exiled.
 
150 years has passed since these tumultuous events and India is now the strongest most prosperous economic force on the planet, and it is here our story starts. With a young girl named Ayanna, hailing from the Somali minority in New Babylon taking the first steps on her way to a new life.


Anything else?
Nope, that&#8217;s basically it. Have a cup of tea, sit down and relax and I hope you will enjoy yourself!









Chapter 1 &#8211; Lord of Beginnings 
Year 2231, high summer.
Temple of Ganesha, New Babylon

His lips gently touched mine, his warmth spreading to my mouth. I felt electrified, the sari brushed gently against my body in the wind, spreading chills coursing over my skin.

My hands trembled as I grasped his shoulders and looked up in his eyes. It wasn&#8217;t the first kiss in my life, but it still blew my mind. I heard my heart race in ears, felt my chest heaving up and down as I breathed. My body was shivering and flushing at the same time. My cheeks burned so hot it felt like I was on fire.

Rajan looked down on and caressed an unruly strand of hair from my face. �Good luck.� He wished me. �You too.� I replied, looking up in his brown eyes. I reached up with my head and he kissed me again. I locked my arms around his neck and let myself melt in his arms.

�I got to go sweetheart or we&#8217;ll both be late.� He said and put his hand on my hips, gently nudging us apart. I looked up at him with not so well played sorrow, giving him my best puppy eyes. �Oh, don&#8217;t be like that. We&#8217;ll see each other tonight and maybe we can continue�� he said and leaned forward, I could feel the warmth of his body on my lips. I closed my eyes and opened my lips, bending my head up. But just before our mouths met he grinned and put his finger on my lips and said&nbsp; ��this.�. 

I felt the sheer frustration churn my stomach as I looked up at him. Needless to say, I didn&#8217;t enjoy it as much as he seemed to. I waved and he smiled at me lopsidedly. He turned and quickly sped down the stairs of the temple.

I was standing outside of the temple of Ganesha here in New Babylon. We we&#8217;re fifteen years old, and this was the most important day of our lives. The day all children in the Indian Commonwealth have prepared for all their lives.

This was our Pruning, the day our fates as citizens of the commonwealth would be determined. The all-knowing Kalki, the preserver, lord of Resplendent Destinies would read our psyche, and determine our qualities as well as our shortcomings. From them, he would decide what caste and profession we would be most prosperous in, consolidating our Karma from our last life.

Kalki is embodied in a machine, an artificial intelligence crafted just after the Reformation at 2078. His electronic body in Pune is considered holy ground by the Brahmin. They built a temple around it in classical style, which is now over a 150 years old. 

I looked back up at ornamented temple door. A large statue of Ganesha himself, the elephant god, the lord of beginnings towered over the entrance looking down on me. I bowed too him in tentative reverence before entering.

A large group of children had amassed in the antechambers. I wore my finest sari, cream coloured with golden embroideries. Still trembling from Rajan&#8217;s kiss, I stepped inside the temple, my footsteps echoing of the cool stone. The murmur of the distant crowd grew to nigh deafening roar as I got closer and the voices echoed in full strength against the temple walls.

I was nervous when I went to bed last night, so nervous I could barely sleep. And this morning, I couldn&#8217;t eat. I&#8217;d had butterflies in my belly since the day before. Now it was mixed with the mushy crazy feelings of a fifteen year old girl in love, turning me mentally upside down. I looked around for a place to sit but realized I was at the temple.

My stomach churned from sexual frustration, anxiety and famine. It seemed everyone had someone to talk to. I was too nervous to even look around for anyone I knew, I only knew that Rajan wasn&#8217;t here. His twin sister Reshmi should be here at this temple somewhere. I&#8217;ve known her since we were kids.

�Now settle down children, your pruning is just about to start.� An elderly man of the scholar caste said, his slightly faded blue caste mark clearly visible on his forehead. The nervous buzzing of the room immediately quieted down as all of us stopped talking to each other.

 �Form a line everyone, you will have the honour to speak to the great lord Kalki yourselves as we enter the room.� He croaked. A senior citizen doing his part to better society. He was overseeing our pruning, our coming of age ceremony. 

Who would be my boss? Who would build my house? Who would guard my streets and cities? Who would cook my food? Who would care for my children? All was decided here.

I saw the engraved words �For the good of all� visible over the doorway as we passed through the door. The old man hummed contently as he led us through the corridor and into the room of fates.

The sun shone in through the ornamented doorways leading out to a marble balcony. A cool draft wafted in through blue silk curtains, lending fresh air to this old part of the temple. Children in front of me bowed in too the templar already present in the room, his red tunic, red caste mark and shaved head signalled his military presence with unmistakable clarity. I hurried in through the doorway and bowed to him quickly, and made way for the ones behind me.

�Take your seats, leave your monitors off until instructed to turn them on.� His clear voice rang out across the room. I looked around and saw computer workstations neatly sitting on a small wooden table each. The room mostly reminded me of the exam room back in school, but much prettier.

The wooden chair creaked slightly as I sat down on it. I looked at the keyboard and at the monitor in front of me. When all of us were seated I looked up at the templar again. �So many young people. So many blank slates. You all have spectacular talents children, today these talents will be made apparent to the world� to us� and to you.� He looked at us with a stern face �You may begin.� He said and the elder Scholar silently left the room, off to greet another party of children.

I heard my heart pounding in my ears as I with trembling hands touched the monitor and it sprung to life.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Is this you?

I touched the keyboard and started typing back to the machine.

Yes it is.

What name have your parents given you?

They call me Ayanna. Ayanna Farah.

And this is the name you wish to enter in the records after your pruning is complete?

Yes.

Then let us begin. Are you ready child?

I am ready lord.

I wiped my sweaty palms on my sari, still trembling slightly. He paused for a bit before replying, as if he was studying me.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Are you nervous child?

I guess, a little�

Fear is a very common response to a life-changing event. 67.6% of all children attending their pruning express fear during the first minute of interaction with me. You are not the first to do so.

You do know that this conversation is considered classified information? It is considered a crime of the first degree to access this information without being a government official.

You do not have to feel nervous to what you say here, this is between you and me.

Thank you, I am honoured by your kindness lord.

Let&#8217;s discuss something else.

Please go on.

You are part of the somalian minority here in New Babylon. How does that make you feel?

I looked at the screen. It was like he took a sharp stick and stuck it in the place where it hurt the most. I clenched my jaw. Was he testing my patience, seeing if I would break or snap?

I was always the only black child in class at every school. Everyone, even my friends used to call me Blackie. I&#8217;ve never seen it as something bad, but my mother wouldn&#8217;t allow it. She is very proud of our heritage, our home is filled with Somali trinkets and old relics and antiques from our family.

I can&#8217;t say I care either way. Sure, some of my classmates tease me and say that I&#8217;m going to move to Ethiopia and become a movie star, they&#8217;re just used to seeing African&#8217;s at the cinema I guess. But the extra attention can be kind of nice but� 

I have fantasized about being Indian, like everyone else.

In your fantasy, do you want to be Indian because you feel they are prettier or some other reason?

No, not to be pretty but rather to not be noticed. To be able to walk down a street and not have every other person give you an extra look because you&#8217;re the first black person they&#8217;ve seen today. I think I long for the anonymity. 

Interesting. What about beauty then?

Forgive me, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m following you�

Who do you think are the prettiest, Somalians or Indians?

I&#8217;d say that they are about the same. Indians can be very pretty, if they don&#8217;t have a beard. I really don&#8217;t like beards. They look so goofy, and they itch.

How would you know they itch? I take it you haven&#8217;t kissed a bearded boy.

Heh, no my lord. My father has a small beard. It scratches when he kisses me.

You are very well versed in Sanskrit for being just 15 years old, you write eloquently for being so young.


I blushed at the compliment, feeling the warmth rise to my face.


Thank you lord, you are too kind.

I take it that you read a lot?

Yes, I love reading. I probably do it more than anything else on my spare time.

And you probably write a lot too, chatting with your friends, writing email and maybe even the odd forum post? Or maybe a novel?

Yeah� yes I do� How do you know so much about me? 

It is my raison d&#8217;etre my child. If you know what that means.

I don&#8217;t know what it means, but I know it&#8217;s French.

Correct, it is indeed french. Look it up when we are finished here today. 
Knowledge is power, always seek it.

Yes Lord Kalki, I will.


The screen paused a few seconds, as if he was thinking something over.


What do you vision yourself doing when you grow up?


I looked at the question, not really knowing what to answer. Suddenly my attention was diverted from the screen. A boy two rows in front of me started crying. The entire room turned to look at him, which intensified his crying and he got up from his chair and tried to walk away.

The templar in his crimson tunic walked up to him and laid his hand on his shoulder. �I want to go home� He&#8217;s mean to me.� cried the boy. Apparently Kalki tried him, and broke him. The templar looked up at us and bellowed �Back to your stations, you will not dishonour the great lord by ignoring his presence!�.

I swallowed hard and looked down on the monitor and our conversation once again. He peacefully asked for an answer to his question.


Well? 

What did you say to that boy to make him cry?

That is between him and me. I asked you a question, please answer it child.

Was it really necessary to make him cry?

Yes.

We will not discuss this further, this conversation is about you, not the boy in front of you. I suggest you focus your priorities, we are deciding your future today.

I&#8217;m sorry lord, I just don&#8217;t like seeing people upset�

Wait� Did you just make him upset too see how we others would react?!


The machine paused for several seconds before answering.


If I did, the law prohibits me from telling you child, but it is an interesting hypothesis. However, I&#8217;m starting to believe that you are evading my question. Do you feel shame for your future plans?


I felt ashamed, not for my future plans, but for failing to answer a simple question after he asked me four times already.


I� damn. I&#8217;m really sorry :( I got preoccupied�

No worry my child, let&#8217;s start over. What would you like to do when you grow up?

I think I would like to travel and see the world. I would like to meet people in foreign countries and help them.

Help them how?

Help them make a life worthy of living. Having food on the table, medicine and care for their ill and a roof over their head. Like India did when we adopted Persia and southern Arabia.

I see. So you would like to work like an aid worker?

Hmm� maybe not so serious. Maybe more like a� what&#8217;s the word. Au pair?

Is this what you mean?

Au pair:
An exc &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;hange student that lives together with a local family, receiving pocket money, food and housing in exchange for helping out with family child care and housework.

Source: Encyclopaedia Universalis

Yeah, that sounds just about right. That would be fun. Maybe seeing New Berlin or old London.

Europe can be a very dangerous place, even though the cities you named are relatively safe. How do you feel about the danger of being robbed or worse while in Europe?

I&#8217;ve have friends here that have been robbed here in New Babylon, I&#8217;m not so sure that Europe is all that more dangerous than our own streets.

Interesting answer. Have you ever been to Europe?

No, but I would like to go.

Yes, that much is apparent. So the presented dangers do not worry you at all?

Not really.

Do you like roller coasters?


I looked down at the odd question. Where was he going with this?


 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Well actually, yeah I do. 

Interesting. About your trip to Europe, does the dangers present make the trip more exciting? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;


He saw right through me. I let out a soft laugh as I typed my response, but I couldn&#8217;t help myself feeling a bit silly.


I guess :) Maybe a little.

You have a genetic disposition that is known as the Tanaka gene. Have you heard of this?

I recognise the name, but I can&#8217;t recall what it is.

It is a gene that predisposes you to excessive release of adrenaline and endorphins when presented with a physically threatening situation.

What has that got to do with roller coasters and Europe?

Your body and your brain can not actively determine whether or not the roller coaster is safe or not. All it perceives is that you are very high up and are moving down in a rapid rate. Therefore, it assumes that you&#8217;re in a hurtful situation and prepares you for it.

Same thing with driving a car really fast or stabbing a knife around your fingers repeatedly or simple things like someone holding you down in a, even in a non-threatening manner can set off the Tanaka response.


I thought about the times I walked the streets alone at night, feeling the tingling sensation of excitement in my belly. My mother used to get so worried, and my father so angry.


I recognize what you talk about� Is it serious?...

Not really. In a lot of cases it is actually helpful to have the extra rush of adrenaline and endorphins in harmful situations to be able to flee or fight well.

On the other hand humans presenting with Tanaka syndrome is ten times as likely to die in a car crash as those who lack the gene. Biologically it is not classified as a disease if that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re worried about. It is more of a genetic trait no more serious than flexible joints or sensitivity to strong food.

Ok. So if I&#8217;m out walking the streets alone at night, and get a rush from it. Is that the gene talking?

Very likely, yes. But this gene is just a disposition. Some have it and don&#8217;t present with any the symptoms, or present them in different ways. Rage or sexual arousal is not uncommon.


I clenched my thighs together. He popped the word and I thought about Rajan again, how his lips embraced mine. 


You want sex.


He blurted it out all of a sudden. My eyes glared at the screen. I looked nervously around to the others around me. Most looked distraught, a couple looked relaxed or even too relaxed. Some seemed upset and one boy in the far back seemed to be enjoying himself.


I can tell that you&#8217;re thinking about it.

You can read minds too?!

I read people. Your body language alone has already told me more information than you realize. 


I blushed and looked back at the screen and felt a slight shiver.


Dilated pupils, a smile out of context, increased heart rate and temperature are a couple of the multitude of hints you humans flash about when you&#8217;re craving sexual attention. You flaunt them all.


I looked at the screen, feeling ashamed. This should be a day of serious discussion about my life, determining my future. And all I could think about was Rajan holding my hands firmly, kissing me.


I&#8217;m really really sorry my lord. Please, I won&#8217;t get distracted again. Please accept my apology.

No apology necessary. This isn&#8217;t the first time today you&#8217;ve thought about sex. At least at five other occasions I&#8217;ve noted your mind wandering on the subject. This is more than the usual child during his pruning. Actually it&#8217;s 200% more. This tells me something about you, and me understanding you is why we are here.


I sat up straight, wanting to justify myself. Apparently, he wasn&#8217;t interested in shaming me.


It&#8217;s biological, you know� I&#8217;m a teenager. Nature has seen to it that we try to fall in love when we get to our age.

I would say that you&#8217;re less self conscious about sex than most of your age. A relative to you have had a talk with you about it, or is it a heavily discussed subject around your acquaintances?

Actually, neither.

I see. Then you are in the 17% minority who act confident without prior knowledge. Some would call this brave.

But I have prior knowledge.


The machine stopped for a couple of seconds, in order to realise his mistake.


Forgive me, I am currently pruning over 25.000 citizens. My full analysis protocol is slower than usual.

My second guess is that you&#8217;ve read up on the subject on your own then.

Yeah, if you turn the porn filter on when searching the net, you can find really good articles. Like I said, I read a lot. Especially when I find something interesting.

And you find sex interesting?

Yeah� I really want to find someone I could� you know. Do it with.

Considering your beauty, that should not be a problem. 

You think I&#8217;m beautiful? And by the way, I have a boyfriend. But we kinda just started dating seriously.

I am only stating what the evidence tells me. I am unable to have a personal opinion on human beauty. But I can have an opinion on what humans themselves find beautiful and you meet several of the criteria. That, and the fact that out of the 27 females present here, you are receiving the second most looks from the 23 present males.

Eh� thanks. I guess. Who&#8217;s receiving the most looks?

I&#8217;m not at liberty to say I&#8217;m afraid.

Can&#8217;t blame a girl for trying though :)

I would however recommend waiting a few years. 69% of all female fifteeen year olds who had sex say that they feel that it was too early for them.

I guess so =/ Boys at this age probably don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re doing anyway. What age would you recommend by the way?

Statistically, people tend to be happier the older they are during their debut. But an acceptable level of content debutants is reached at 17.8 years of age.

This is however only a mean. There are fifteen year olds who are perfectly happy with their sex debut.

What if I don&#8217;t feel like waiting that long?

Statistically, you will be more satisfied if you wait. But I understand if you feel frustrated. It is a powerful biological need that you humans have.

Have you ever tried any sexual activity on your own?

Should I have?

Do you really want to hear me cite even more statistics?


For some reason, I giggled. And pretty loudly too, I covered my mouth with my hand. Several of the others who weren&#8217;t so fortunate in their talks with Kalki glared angrily at me.


I&#8217;m glad I amuse you, I seldom have that affect on people.

Please, give me one of your percentages :)

Around 65% of thirteen year olds say that they have been masturbating or been trying to. This fact together with your over the ordinary interest in sex should suggest that you have tried to masturbate at least once. If successful, you probably have continued to do so.

Well, I have touched myself you know� down there. But at first it didn&#8217;t really do much for me. I got a little horny but never got anything out of it.

Then I met Rajan, and we started kissing. That&#8217;s when I realised kissing him got me hornier than me touching my self. So the next day in the shower, I did it while thinking of him. Then I� I think came.

What did it feel like?

It was, totally, amazing. I felt like these waves of grabbing hold of me and rocking me. I got like ultra sensitive you know� down there. It felt like my muscles we&#8217;re on fire and. Well, it&#8217;s a bit embarrassing but I fell down :)

I hope you didn&#8217;t get hurt. What did you imagine yourself doing with him?

I� this is really weird�

I&#8217;m not here to judge you Ayanna, only to understand you. It is imperative that you tell me everything and tell it to me in truth. I am Kalki, The lord of Resplendant Destinies. I dictate your future. 

Do you really want me to do so on faulty information?

No, I&#8217;m sorry my lord.

Don&#8217;t feel ashamed of anything Ayanna. You are what you are, I&#8217;m the one responsible for making the best of you.&nbsp; Now tell me the fantasy that you enjoy the most. The one that you most easily get off on.

I� I fantasize that he is on top of me, and that I&#8217;m tied down to the bed�
He blindfolds me, and plays with me. He kisses me, rubs me, nibbles me. Until he finally lays himself over me, not really interested in getting me off. But just using me to come himself.

I so want to put my legs and arms around him, and help him but I can&#8217;t. I&#8217;m tied down. He comes inside me, and slumps down. He whispers that he loves me in my ear and kisses me good night, turns off the light and leaves me in the room frustrated and alone�


I was clenching my legs together, afraid of making a spot at the beautifully carved chair. My face was so hot it felt like it was on fire. My vision got a bit blurry and I felt my hands shake as I typed my innermost thoughts to Kalki.


Please, go on.

That&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s what usually gets me off the hardest. The thought of not coming, how messed up is that?

Would you feel any better if I told you that this kind of fantasy is rather common?

It is?

Yes. The theme of helplessness and objectification is very common in sexual fantasies. About 10% of the population state that they have them. The real number is most likely higher though, people tend to lie about these things.

Really? That high?

I thought you had read a lot about the human sexuality. This should be common knowledge for anyone researching the queer side of sexuality. But considering your age, you are probably working full time understanding the basics.

Well, I&#8217;ve read all about coitus and fellatio and cunnilingus and anal sex. But nothing of that kind off stuff�

You said that your fantasies have only included Rajan and yourself?

Yes.

Lunch break is coming up now. I want you to think about something during it. 

Off course my lord, what is it?

When you come back, I want you to dictate a sexual fantasy, about as long as the one you told before, but in this one you&#8217;re with another woman.


I stopped for a long time as I looked on the screen, not knowing if he was serious or not. I just stared at it, slack jawed. 

The templar looked up at the watch, most children seemed to have been prompted by Kalki to stop their conversation with him. Someone was still typing frantically in the back of the room.


You have your orders Ayanna, I will expect you back in 90 minutes.


�Lunch break for 90 minutes, I recommend that you are back in 80. Being late to your pruning is an offence punishable in a court of law. Dismissed.� The templar bellowed.


* * *


15 minutes and three subway stops later�

I sat down with my tray of chinese food beside Rajan and his twin sister Reshmi. I had spent most of the time looking at the teenaged Chinese waitress, imagining her naked on a bed. Remembering Kalki&#8217;s assignment, I was busy thinking of ways to please her, and the sounds she would make as I did it. Reshmi cut my thoughts short.

�So, what did he ask you about Yani? You look like you&#8217;ve seen a ghost.� I looked up at her, and then down at the cooked rice with egg noodles and beef. She giggled, �It can&#8217;t be that embarrassing, he&#8217;s just a machine you know.� she teased me.

�He&#8217;s not just a machine, he is Lord Kalki, lord of Resplendent Destinies. His body is holy ground.� Rajan pointed out, correcting his sister. She gave him an annoyed look. I looked up at her. �I� don&#8217;t know. What did he ask you about?� I tried and started digging in the rice after the egg noodles. 

�Hey, I asked first!� Reshmi called out. Reshmi was just as pretty as Rajan. They we&#8217;re both tall fair skinned Indians. Not as fair skinned as a Caucasian, but a lot lighter than most other Indians. Either they were extremely well preserved Indo-Aryans or they had some European blood in their ancestry. If the latter was true, it was probably something they didn&#8217;t really wanted to talk about.

�Ok then�� Reshmi sighed. �He started out by asking me a bunch of moral and ethical questions.� Rajan choked on his food. �I bet you passed with flying colours.� He teased, while swilling down his food with a mouthful of soda.

�Hey! He said my answers we&#8217;re interesting.� She said in a slightly hurt tone. �He says that a lot.� I noted. �And he&#8217;s probably telling the truth. He doesn&#8217;t judge you, he&#8217;s just interested in how your mind works. Too him, the way you sit on your chair is interesting.� Rajan nodded. �She speaks the truth, my little dove.� He said and leaned over and kissed me.

�Ugh, I think I&#8217;m going to be sick, you two are just too cute.� Reshmi said. We stopped kissing and I smiled at her. �So, I told you something awkward, now it&#8217;s your turn.� Reshmi said and turned to me.

�Well� he wanted to know my thoughts on sex.� I said casually, while drinking my tea. Both Reshmi and Rajan froze. I looked at them, a bit amused over their reaction. �What?!� they both said in unison. 

�What did you tell him?� demanded Rajan. �Have you done it?� Asked Reshmi merrily. �No we haven&#8217;t.� Rajan told her. �How would I know!?� Reshmi almost shouted. �What did you say?� They both demanded in unison, standing up from their seats. I cowered slightly in my chair, with a mouthful of rice and covering myself with my chopsticks.

�Could you keep it down?!� I hissed at them and leaned over the table. They leaned forward with me. �He wanted to know my sexual fantasies.� I whispered. �You have wet dreams?� Reshmi asked. I blushed again. �Yeah, don&#8217;t you?� I replied. She looked a bit embarrassed. �Well, what did you say?� Rajan wondered.

�I told him about them.� I said, a little more casual, taking a bite of food. �Told him what?� He asked me, with a lopsided smile. �That&#8217;s a secret.� I said with a grin, content that I knew he would respect it. And like clockwork he responded, �Well, it is between you and Lord Kalki.�

�That&#8217;s bull, I want to know.� Reshmi blurted out. �What did he ask you more?� she quickly added. I leaned forward. �He wanted to know if I&#8217;ve ever� you know. Played with myself�. Rajan immediately leaned forward to listen in. We both turned heads and looked at him. �What?� he asked with played innocence. �Hey, I&#8217;m your boyfriend. I get to know these things, right?� he added.

�Well have you?� Reshmi asked. �Yeah, I have.� I replied. �How do you get any privacy? Don&#8217;t you have like two older brothers or something? I mean I only have Rajan and our house is pretty big, I still can&#8217;t get any time to do it.� She said. I looked back at her and said �You&#8217;re always by yourself in the shower girl.� She looked at me in revelation. �Ooooh��

Rajan laughed softly �Took you that long to figure that out?� She tossed her napkin at his face. �Hey guys, enough about me. What about you? What did he ask you?�

Reshmi took a deep breath. �Well, first he asked all those questions about moral choices and stuff. But after that, he started asking me math problems and stuff. Then he drilled me about biology and physics and� well. It was like retaking every single class in school.�

�Scary� how did it go?� I asked. �I aced every single question.� She said not the least bit self-conscious about gloating.

�What about you bro?� she asked her brother. �Well, he started with asking me about how I felt about gym class and sports in general. After a couple of questions about that, he changed the subject and started giving a bunch of moral problems to solve.� He said. �Like what?� I asked. �Well, like� If you&#8217;re in a store and are paying. If the machine accidentally comes up with a much higher price than what it should be you&#8217;re likely to object. Right?� We both nodded.

�But if he comes up with a much lower price, then what do you do?� Reshmi looked at him seriously. �It&#8217;s his responsibility, if he can&#8217;t do his job why should I get the blame? I&#8217;d stick with it.� She quickly said. �What did you say?� I asked Rajan. He looked a bit sourly at his sister apparent lack of moral fibre. �I said that I would point it out, always.� He replied. �Would you?� I asked, smiling. �Off course.� He said.

�Guys, we should get moving or we&#8217;ll be late and be like imprisoned for life, you know.� Reshmi jokingly pointed out. All of us quickly realized that the jokes would be on us if we really we&#8217;re late and quickly hurried off.

Back at the temple of Ganesha, the youths gathered for the last hours of their childhoods, as they knew it.

Starting session�

Welcome back, I trust your lunch was enjoyable.

Thank you lord. Yes it was.

We do not have much left to talk about I believe. Did you do what I asked of you?

I tried, or� well. Yeah, I did it. But it&#8217;s really simple. 

Tell me about it.

There was this girl at the Chinese restaurant where we had lunch. I imagined her naked, sleeping under thin cotton sheets. As the morning sun shone in through the window, I crawled up on the bed and under the sheets towards her.

The sun shone through the thin covers, giving me a good view of her legs and her pussy. Her musky smell covers filled my senses, my mouth watered as I crawled up to her. She was still asleep. I gently nudged her legs apart as I got comfortable with my nose in her pubes, and I start lapping her� I go on for hours, slumberous I lapped at her. She woke up and drowsily put her hand at my head, patting me softly. And we lay there in the sunshine, having a lazy morning.

Do you get aroused by these thoughts?

Can&#8217;t you tell?

Sometimes it&#8217;s hard to differentiate between arousal and severe stress. I don&#8217;t want mix the one with the other. Are you aroused right now?

Yes�

Because of your story?

Well, you told me to come up with a sexual fantasy. Wouldn&#8217;t be much of a fantasy if I didn&#8217;t get off on it would it?

It most certainly wouldn&#8217;t. Are you familiar with the term bisexual?

Of course.

I&#8217;ve been studying your medical records while you we&#8217;re gone. Your genetic makeup and your brain scans indicate that you are in bi- or homosexual. Considering the fact that you have a boyfriend that you seem to care about, I&#8217;d say that you are bisexual.


It didn&#8217;t get more personal then this. He was laying me bare, made totally vulnerable and exposing every piece of me. He was right off course, it was obvious when he told me.


I haven&#8217;t really thought about, maybe I am? But it doesn&#8217;t matter, I like Rajan. I know I do.

I never said you didn&#8217;t.

I am quite pleased with our little talk Ayanna and I am finished with you. Unless there is anything else to add, I wish you the best of luck in your life.

What? Already? What am I going to do? What am I going to be?

My decision will arrive in two days. Do you have anything you would like to add?

I would like to add that I would want a position here in New Babylon, if it&#8217;s possible to arrange.

Noted. Anything else?

No�

Goodbye then Ayanna, blessed be your soul. 
You will hear from me soon.


I looked down at the screen, stressed over the fact that I finished so soon. Did he really know enough about me already? Or was he simply that good at reading me. In the back of my head, I wanted to pose the question why almost half of our talk was about sex, but I didn&#8217;t dare.


* * *


The giant monitor flickered to life over the large marble dais. The parents and loved ones had gathered, us students stood attention in a line at the side, clearly visible to the audience. We we&#8217;re clad in deliberately simple grey robes, to be cast aside during the ceremony symbolically. Showing the transition as a casteless child to full-fledged citizen of the Commonwealth.

The text �Establishing connection to Kalki, lord of Resplendent Destinies�� appeared on the monitor. Shortly thereafter, the picture of a marble statue appeared. He held a scale in his one hand and a blank parchment in the other.

All of us realised that it was time. It felt like an entire colony of butterflies had decided to nest in my belly. One of the boys in front of me was mumbling to himself and the girl behind at the far end of the line was pacing back and forward, trying to walk of her anxiety. I saw Rajan and Reshmi up ahead, they where among the first, I seemed to be the second last in line.

I waved nervously at them. Reshmi was way too nervous to notice me, but Rajan waved back at me, he still looked pretty distraught, always keeping an eye on the podium.

The murmur of the crowd died down quickly as the Brahmin priest walked up to the centre of the stage. He was a wizened old man, but still stood tall with a proud posture worthy of a Brahmin. He took a deep breath as he prepared to speak.

�Great lord Kalki, beloved teachers, family and caretakers and soon to be citizens. Welcome, to this last stage of this years pruning.� He paused and looked out to the audience, letting his words sink in for a moment. �I have the honour of presenting to you today, 75 of this city&#8217;s brightest students. The first primary school of New Babylon has a reputation, a reputation built in the foundation of excellence.�

�Nearly all the students that have graduated here have always been sent away to excel in the real world. Be they Brahmins or Templars. Scholars or Merchants. Or even if they became servants, they have always been sent away to most luxurious, to the most prestigious and to the most well renowned secondary schools in the country.�

�Today, one and a half million children are graduating from their primary school. Today, the Commonwealth receives one and a half million new citizens, pruned into their caste and set on their way. Today�� he paused again and held up his hands. He raised his voice as he continued. �Is a glorious day for the Commonwealth, for the lord Brahma and of course for our beloved children.� He said and turned his robed arm towards us. Applause erupted from the audience, parents calling out their children&#8217;s name in joy.

�I want you all to realise, that the world becomes a better place today.� He said with a smile, and elicited a smatter of applause yet again. �Our country is blessed with such a radiant and gifted youth. But enough of this old man&#8217;s ramblings. This is after all the children&#8217;s day.�

He backed away and picked up a matchstick. He scraped it across a marble altar and lit a small fire in a ceremonial bowl. He looked up at the monitor. �We are ready lord Kalki.� He said and bowed to the picture on the screen. The statue on the screen opened his eyes, underneath them a bright yellow light shone.

He spoke with a deep voice, his body and lips unmoving. �By the power invested in me by the brahman, the clergy of the common world and the craftsmen who gave me life, I hereby lay my judgement.� The audience was perfectly still, perfectly quiet. You could&#8217;ve heard a pinhead drop to the floor. Everyone bowed their heads in reverence of the mighty entity gracing them with his presence.

�Reshmi Kumesh.� He said. Everyone looked at her. Somehow, she had managed to gather her wits and managed to look dignified as she strode up the stairs and up to the altar. She took the ceremonial incense from a bowl and walked up to the altar where she tossed it in the fire. Smoke erupted and she looked up at Kalki.

�Reshmi Kumesh she will study the economic flow of money in the world and consolidate the Commonwealth as the strongest economic force on this planet.
Reshmi Kumesh will finish her education in the Academy of the Golden Abacus too later continue as a intern at the global stock exchange in Beijing.� He said as beam of concentrated light cut through the smoke of the sacrificed incense. The yellow light shone through and landed straight in her forehead. She winced a little at the pain, but stood her ground. 

A smatter of applause swelled over the courtyard, but all of it was deafened by the shouts of joy from Reshmi&#8217;s and Rajan&#8217;s mother, as she stood up and yelled her joy out. Her child was being shipped off to the most exclusive economic school in the country.

The Brahmin approached her with a golden yellow robe in his hands, and made a gesture for the gray one she was wearing right now. She slid out of it, showing a expensive blouse and a trendy pair of jeans underneath. She quickly slid in to the new robe, thanked the Brahmin and turned around, her face filled with pride. In her forehead a yellow dot the size of a small thumb was clearly visible. The mark made it clear for all to see that she was a member of the Merchant caste.

�Welcome to the Commonwealth, Merchant Reshmi Kumesh.� Kalki said, with emphasis on her caste&#8217;s name.

The procedure was repeated for each and every child. After two more had passed, a Scholar sent of to the University of Delhi to study physics and a Templar sent of to the central command outside of New Babylon, it was Rajans turn.

Rajan gracefully walked up to the altar, sacrificed the ceremonial incense and looked up at Kalki.

�Rajan Kumesh, will forever be a beacon of light in a dark world. A strong voice to follow, in the turmoil that is our lives in this world. A leader, a friend and a Brahmin. Rajan Kumesh will finish his education in the Parlor of Tranquil Thought to later continue as an acolyte.�

He was given his new white robe and turned around, his pearly white caste mark shone on his forehead as he was greeted by thunderous applause from the audience. His mother started crying, she was truly a blessed woman to have two such successfully children. I felt myself being filled with pride. �That&#8217;s my boyfriend.� I thought with a smile.

About an hour passed for the other children to pass through the ceremony until it was finally my turn.

I stepped up on the platform and grabbed a fist of incense. I gracefully walked up to the fire. �Go Ayanna!� I heard my brother shout out. I smiled even though no one saw me, as my back was turned towards the audience. I tossed the incense into the fire and looked up at Kalki.

My heart pounded in my ears. He asked me all those questions about sex. Am I too study sexology at a university? Or be some sort of relationship counsellor? I would like both. I felt my hands shaking as I clutched my robe looking up at him.

He opened his eyes and looked down on me.

�Ayanna Farah is a woman in the word&#8217;s truest sense. She is a woman of beauty, a woman of understanding and a woman of kindness. She will continue to spread her warmth to the world, enriching our culture making us not only the most prosperous country in the world, but also the happiest.�

I could hear my family hold their breath, still not sure what Kalki&#8217;s ambiguous explanation meant, waiting for his more direct explanation. Truth be told, so did I.

�Ayanna Farah will continue her education in the Acadamy of the Night Lily to later be sold to the highest bidder that would wish to grace his life with her presence.�

My heart missed a beat as a cold hand grabbed it. Green rays of light struck down on my face, branding me as a member of the Servant caste with a light green mark on my forehead. The Brahmin handed me a green robe. Without thinking, I disrobed my grey robe and donned the green one and turned around. I still couldn&#8217;t believe it was happening, I barely grasped the reality of the situation.

The audience stood stunned looking at me. I didn&#8217;t know it that time, but out of one and a half million pruned children, barely 80 of them was chosen to be sent of to the Academy of the Night Lily, a place only whispered about in stories. Everyone knew it existed, but no one knew what it actually entailed.

My mother cried that day, not tears of joy as Rajan&#8217;s mother did, but tears of bottomless sadness. My father desperately tried to soothe her, tears streaming from his face as well. They did not know exactly what was about to happen to me, but they understood that I was now a slave, I had become merchandise.

All my plans, my dreams and my hopes crumbled as I looked out on the silent audience, staring back at me. Then I caught Rajan&#8217;s eye. His sister stood beside him, bewildered and stunned. She didn&#8217;t really understand what just happened and simply stared at me.

Rajan understood. He understood that we could never see each other again. Not only would we be in different parts of the country, but more importantly that he was a Brahmin and I was merely a Servant slave. I would defile him by simply touching him.

�Welcome to the Commonwealth, Servant Ayanna Farah.�

It was then that I started crying.









Chapter 2 &#8211; The Long Road to Darjeeling
Year 2231, July
Central station, New Babylon

�I don&#8217;t get it, why can&#8217;t you fly there like normal people?� my brother asked. �You&#8217;ve read the letter like all of us Masoud.� father said, the strain in his voice clearly audible. �They told us to send her off by train, so here we are.� My mother did her best not to weep anymore, it felt like it was all she&#8217;d done after the annunciation.

�Are you sure you got everything? I&#8217;ve packed everything they asked for. A grey sari, slippers and your identification card. I packed your favourite clothes too, it&#8217;s fall soon I know how you like your jeans in the fall, and your br-brown sweater�� she managed before starting sobbing again. I looked at her, she&#8217;d been like this for days and no matter what I said I couldn&#8217;t get her to calm down. �It&#8217;s ok mom, I think we&#8217;re gonna wear uniforms�� I said, hoping it would soothe her. It had the opposite effect.

�Last call for Kathmandu, last call!� the conductor bellowed. My brother walked up and hugged me. �If there&#8217;s anything be sure to write and I&#8217;ll come and bust some heads, you hear?� he said and smiled reassuringly. I smiled back flatly, brushing some hair from my face. 

My mom and my dad hugged me too, whispering their good byes in my ear. While I was hugging them, I saw someone in the swarming crowd of the station. I saw Rajan, standing behind a pillar of steam coming from a vent in the ground. I hadn&#8217;t heard from him in days, his shirt was unbuttoned and the cotton vest under was visible. He looked at me with tired eyes. Sad eyes. The image flashed my mind for an instant, I blinked and he was gone.

Did I really see him? �Young miss, I&#8217;m going to have to ask you step on the train.� The conductor told me as he prodded my shoulder. I shook off the image still on my retina, took my luggage and pulled out the handle, tipping it on its wheels. I waved meekly to family. �Bye then.� I said. �Oh I can&#8217;t watch�� my mom winced, leaning on my father&#8217;s arm. I bit my lip, intent on not aggravating their pain as I boarded the train.

I pulled my luggage in and got help from the conductor to haul it up on the shelf above my seat. I sat down and looked out through the window on my grieving parents. I felt a slight jerk and saw the platform starting to slide away from me, them standing on it. They&#8217;ve lost a daughter today. �They&#8217;ve lost me. What does that make me?� I thought. �Nothing?�

I bit my lip and a tear streamed down my face. �Damn it, they saw it.� I thought as my mother&#8217;s crying intensified. I wiped it of my cheek and simply looked down at them with my teary eyes. It didn&#8217;t last long though, I&#8217;d shed all my tears during the last few days, and there would be a while before I could cry more.

After the train had gathered its speed and was moving swiftly through the suburbs, I eyed the letter we had received from the school. Like all tangible documents it was a piece of electronic paper. Actually it&#8217;s a misnomer to call it paper since it&#8217;s actually plastic, but that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s called. It is a page of plastic paper that like any view screen can show anything it&#8217;s programmed to show. Electronic papers like these are hardwired to show one and only thing, the moment you infuse the data into it, it becomes fixed and can&#8217;t be altered. They we&#8217;re more like static web pages than classical letters.

This particular letter was a bit special, because it was time coded. In exactly 3 minutes and 20 seconds it would unlock the second part of the message. The first part told me that my train ticket was booked and paid for, what to bring to the school and when and where my train was leaving. It also included a small gallery of pictures of the school. It looked like an old mansion restored to include all the modern comforts but keeping the traditional style from the colonial era.

�Message unlocked.� Soft letters appeared on the screen. I touched the link on the paper and the message popped up. 

Dear young Servant Farah:

My name is Servant Lakshmi Buhpathi and I am the principle of the academy that you are to spend your coming four and a half years in. You are as of right now on your train headed for Darjeeling. In just a few hours, you will be at your new home, at the Academy of the Night Lily.


I brought down the letter to my lap and looked out the window. 

Night Lilies. The commonwealths most luxurious and prestigious courtesans all hail under the banner of the Night Lily. Many said that they band together in a sisterhood, exchanging valuable information extracted from their owners, making them powerful, and sometimes wealthy, women. Others say that they are nothing but overpriced sex toys for their lecherous owners.

Few and far between and rarely shown by their proprietor, little was known about the life of these women. 


I&#8217;m not sure what you know or have been told about the Night Lilies, so I will attempt the difficult task of summarizing our school and our sisterhood for you.

You are as of right now a courtesan. Your job is the pleasure and well being of your owner. Yes, owner. You are as of right now owned by the Academy and when it is pleased with your training, you will be commissioned or sold to the highest bidder.

This training includes all the skills that you will need to succeed in your life. You will learn the pleasures of the flesh as well as the ones of the mind, the eye and the ear. You will learn control over your own body and over your own mind. I will say no more in this simple letter, there will be a formal introduction at the academy when you arrive.


As principle the academy&#8217;s students have known me in a multitude of ways. As a principle, as a Mistress, as a judge, as a despised nemesis, as a beloved friend or sometimes just a simple shoulder to lean on.

You have to understand that my job is your education and it will always come first to me. Sometimes you will not like what I tell you to do, but at times I promise you that you will revel in the rewards of good behaviour.

Now for your first assignment Ayanna:
As you may or may not have noticed, you have a transfer in Kathmandu but your ticket is not valid for the travel between Kathmandu and Darjeeling.


I immediately stopped and felt my heart skip a beat. I opened my backpack and reached for my ticket. I felt it on my fingertips and pulled it up. �Departure: New Babylon, Destination: Kathmandu� it said. I looked back at the letter.


But do not panic Ayanna, there is a ticket on this train with your name on it, that will take you from Kathmandu to Darjeeling. But you will have to earn it.

You will take all your luggage including backpacks, coats, jackets, shoes, and so on. You will move to the back of the train to the dining car. There you will look for a man named Merchant Abjiri Agarkar.

You will approach him and say the precise words �It may be monsoon in Mumbai, but I hear the weather in Darjeeling is wonderful this time of the year.� He will respond with �I prefer it by the winter, when the leaves fall.�

You will follow this man&#8217;s orders as if they were my own. He will be my eyes and ears on this train and he has your ticket. Obey him, and you will have it. Fail, and you&#8217;ll be stranded in Kathmandu.


Yours sincerely,
Principle Servant Lakshmi Buhpathi


I looked down at the letter fearfully. �What does that mean? I&#8217;m� I&#8217;m not ready for this�� I slumped in the chair. I quickly closed my eyes and immediately thought about what happened too runners, those who defied Kalki&#8217;s orders after their pruning. Exiled and cast out of the commonwealth to never return. Cast out to the turbulent and dark world outside, alone. 

I swallowed hard and stood up, pulled down my luggage from the shelf, slung my backpack over my shoulder and started walking down the aisle to the back of the train.

After excusing my self for what felt like the hundredth time and passed through at least 10 cars I arrived with my unwieldy packing to the dining car. Like the rest of the train, it was sleek modern steel combined with eloquent wooden furniture draped in a beautiful green upholster. The car was relatively empty. A waitress, a bartender and four customers where all who could be seen in the car that would easily fit a school class or two.

I adjusted my strap that was sliding over my shoulder and grabbed my luggage and started walking down. The two nearest customers where female, I walked past them. The third customer had the blue caste mark of a scholar on his forehead, so I walked past him as well. The bartender was a servant, so I disregarded. The waitress was a woman so I walked past her as well.

The last man in the car was sitting with his back towards me and drinking coffee while reading the news on his paperscreen. I walked past him and peeked at his forehead. Yellow mark, he was a merchant.

My stomach felt like a storm in an ocean. I hesitated and must&#8217;ve stood besides him for nearly a full minute. He ignored me. Finally I closed my eyes, bit my lip and slid down in the seat across from him. He looked up from the paper towards me. 

�Finally got his attention.� I thought. �Yes servant?� he asked me. He was a man in his thirties, dressed casually. Well-trained heavy shoulders and a large jaw. A day or two of bristles on his face, making his jaw line even more apparent. I looked at him a couple of seconds before I realised that I was staring. 

�It mah�� my stale voice crackled as I started speaking. Embarrassed I cleared my throat and looked down at the table. �By the lord, why does he have to be so handsome?� Then I realised something and for the first time in a long while I smiled. �He looks a bit like Rajan, but all grown up.� I thought and closed my eyes.

�It may be monsoon in Mumbai, but I hear the weather in Darjeeling is wonderful this time of the year.� I said and looked him straight in the eye. He looked at me for a couple of seconds in silence. My smile vanished �This isn&#8217;t him?!� I thought. Blushing heavily, I turned my eyes away and tried to say something but the words wouldn&#8217;t come. I looked out through the window instead. 

The grabble by the railroad tracks where just a grey blur as they passed by, the rolling landscape further away was easier to fix my eyes on. I mustered up enough courage to look back at him. Slowly I turned my eyes, wanting to sneak a peek at what he was doing. He was still looking at me.

I quickly turned my gaze back to the window, feeling like an idiot. �You know�� he began. �This is a bit silly, but I really feel that it&#8217;s better in the winter, when the leaves fall.�

Relief. I had thought I knew the meaning of this word, but it got redefined in my mind after this moment. I exhaled audibly and looked at him. He smiled. �I&#8217;ve got something that&#8217;s yours. It&#8217;s in my cabin, grab your things and we&#8217;ll go get it.�

�He wants me alone?� I wondered too myself. I stood up and walked after him with my things. We passed two cars further back in the train until we got to the last car, containing two cabins. The one in the far back was his. He walked up to the door and it immediately recognized his retina scan and hissed open.

He walked in and tossed his jacket on the small sofa. �leave your luggage in the corridor, and close the door after you.� He said. I let go of the handle to my steamer and dropped the backpack. I walked in and closed the door after me, feeling a jolt in my belly as I heard the door click shut.

He was a handsome man, with broad shoulders, trimmed hair and powerful hands. I clenched my thighs together. �By the lord, Ayanna, you&#8217;re acting like a slut. You&#8217;ve hardly exchanged pleasantries with the man and you&#8217;re already getting ready to do him!� I thought to myself.

�Take off your clothes.� He said as he opened the small closet and pulled his backpack out. �What?� I thought and said aloud at the same time. �What?� He stopped and looked at me. �Be glad you&#8217;re not in school servant, they&#8217;d not be all that pleased right now.� He said with a smile, apparently amused over the situation. �Now off with them.�

I turned around with my back to him and started to pull my sweater off. An approaching sense of panic raced through my mind. �What does he want with me?� I thought as I studied him in the corner of my eye, as he was rummaging through his backpack. I pulled of my green t-shirt and dropped it on the floor. I kicked my slippers of and undid the knot at my waist that held my khaki pants up and slid them off me.

Crossing my arms self-consciously over my chest, I turned around and looked at him. �There it is.� He exclaimed and pulled out a bundle of cloth out of his backpack. He turned his heads and looked at me. �The rest too.� He said and pointed a sweeping finger at me. 

I had never undressed completely in front of another man before. I always wore a nightgown at home in front of my family, even in front of my own mother. Rajan had never seen me in anything more revealing than a swimsuit. I turned my eyes down and felt the heat rise to my cheeks as I hesitatingly undid my bra-strap and dropped it to the floor. �And the panties�� he added.

I put my thumbs inside my panties, slid them down and stepped out of them. I looked down on myself and covered my naked body. My right hand covered my chest and my left hand covering my crotch from his intruding gaze.

�Hand me your clothes.� He said and extended his arm towards me. �And stop covering yourself up silly, I&#8217;ve seen naked women before.� He chuckled. �Women? He thinks of me a woman?� I thought. I touched my caste mark briefly. I handed him my clothes but kept myself covered, not daring to show my privates to a complete stranger.

He looked at me scratching his chin. �Hm, you still have one piece of clothing left. Give me your hair band.� I reached up and touched it, hadn&#8217;t even thought about it. I always have my hair in a tail with a few strands free over my cheek. I quickly undid it and handed it too him. My straight black hair fell out over my shoulders.

�This is crazy! What the hell am I doing? Standing naked in front of a total stranger?! Alone on a train on my way too a boarding school for courtesans? What happened? I was happy, I had a boyfriend, I had a family that respected me. And now? I have nothing.� I thought as I looked down on my naked body.

Then, the cruellest thing so far happened to me. Abjiri opened the window with one hand and tossed out my clothes with the other, shoes and everything. They disappeared from sight the instant the wind caught hold of them. I looked at him, stunned in disbelief of what had just happened. 

�What did you just do?!� I shrieked. �Are you cra�� he put his finger on my lips. �Hush young servant.� I&#8217;m not exactly sure why. Maybe I realized the folly of yelling. Maybe I felt he knew better than me. Maybe I kind of liked him too much to complain. But regardless, I fell quiet.

�Good.� He said and took a step backwards. �This is the Night Lilies official uniform, it is worn at ceremonial events and when you travel outside the school. It&#8217;s the only thing that you&#8217;re allowed to wear on your trip to Darjeeling.� He said and pointed at a bundle of cloth at the sofa. ��unless you want to do the trip naked. The police might have a problem with that, but I&#8217;m pretty sure that the conductor and all his male friends won&#8217;t.� he said and smiled haughtily. �Actually, I&#8217;m going to do you a favour. You&#8217;re going to have to earn them.�

�What kind of a favor is that? If he was really doing me a favor, why not just give them to me?� I thought.

I looked at the cloth on the couch and then back on him. �What do I have to do?� I asked. �All you have to do is apply that young and oh so impressionable memory of yours and memorize a couple of things for me.�

I looked at him quizzically. �Obey me without question, remember what I tell you and you will have your clothes and be sent on your way. Otherwise�� He looked at the uniform. �I&#8217;ll toss that out too.� 

I wanted to ask him what he wanted me to do, but I was too scared. If he tossed out that uniform and left me, I&#8217;d be done for. No cellphone, no money, no ID� no clothes. 

�I will now teach you to stand correctly. Firstly, put both feet on the ground� he said and pointed at me. Slowly I let down my right leg that I subconsciously had drawn up to cover myself. �Your feet shall be apart, slightly wider than your shoulders.� He told me.

I looked down and realised my feet we&#8217;re so close, my toes we&#8217;re bumping in too each other. I stood astride. He looked and me and said �Now your feet is in line with your shoulders. What did I say about that?� he asked me, his gazing penetrating my very soul. I cast my eyes down quickly. �You said my feet should be a bit wider than my shoulders.� I said quietly. 

�When you address me, all your sentences will end with &#8216;sir&#8217;, understood?� he told me. �Yes� eh. Sir.� I said. �Now tell me again what you said about your feet and your shoulders.� He demanded with a now stern voice. 
�I&#8217;m breathing faster?� I thought.

�You said my feet should be a bit wider than my shoulders, Sir.� I said and looked at him. I felt a slight jolt in my belly. �Of excitement? Damn it, not now Ayanna�� I thought. �Very good Servant Farah, you learn quickly.� He smiled. I smiled back at him and corrected the spacing between my feet. I could feel the air pass between my legs now, causing my cheeks to blush. �I can be damned happy I&#8217;m black, with all the blushing I&#8217;ve been doing and no one can tell a difference but me.� I thought and smiled shyly for myself. 

 �Also, your hands. They should be behind your back and clasped.� He told me. I immediately swung my hands and placed them squarely on my butt and let my left hand embrace my right. �Almost there�� he said and walked up too me. He put his hands on my shoulders. �Shoulders back.� he noted and gave them a simple nudge. I followed.

�Back in, chest out and� you&#8217;re done. This is how you stand when you&#8217;re naked. When you&#8217;re dressed, you&#8217;re feet should rather be a bit narrower then you&#8217;re shoulders. You understand?� he asked.

�Yes Sir.� I said. My small breasts we&#8217;re jutting out, almost as if presented for a viewer due to my shoulders being drawn back. My sex must&#8217;ve been clearly visible when standing this far apart with my feet. �Different owners have different rules regarding where you keep your eyes. I&#8217;m fine with you looking at me, but at the school they will most likely expect you to keep your gaze at the ground as long as they&#8217;re not talking to you. Some owners will never allow you to look at them at all.� He told me.

I looked at him. He was a lot taller than me, and bigger than me. I imagined him kissing me, caressing me with his strong hands, pushing me up against the wall, lifting me up. I closed my eyes and sighed softly. �Did he notice?�

�Your next basic position is sitting down. And when I say sitting down, I mean on the floor.� he said and pointed down at my feet. �Sit.� He commanded. �Yes sir.� I sat down on my bottom with my legs gracefully by my side. �That may be the position of a movie star, but it is not the one of a slave nor a Night Lily. Stand.� He said.

I stood up, with my arms hanging besides me. He stopped in his tracks and looked at them. �Crap.� I immediately put them behind me and checked my footing, standing astride. He nodded slightly.

�Firstly you kneel. You don&#8217;t have to keep your hands behind you now.� He said. I descended down, standing on my knees. The carpet grated uncomfortably against my skin. �Then you sit down your bottom on your heels.�

I put my body down, sitting with my legs folded underneath me. It was a bit uncomfortable, but mostly because of the carpet. �Again, when you&#8217;re naked you&#8217;re expected to have at least two fists of space between your knees. When you&#8217;re clothed, keep your legs shut.� He instructed. I reached down and sat both my closed fists between my knees, measuring the distance.

I looked up at him. �And my hands Sir?� I asked. I felt that jolt in my belly again. �That differs on your owners. Most want you to keep them resting on your thighs. � he noted. I laid them there, it felt natural. �Others want them palms up on your thighs and I&#8217;ve met a select few that want them behind your back. You can choose for yourself.�

�I like it this way Sir.� I said and smiled. As I sat there on the floor naked in front of him, and looked up at him. I felt my pussy getting a bit wet. I froze. �Damn it Ayanna�� I bit my own lip as I felt a trickle of sweat running down my back.

I tried to disregard my excitement as he walked behind me, but then he touched me. He prodded me in the back. �Back straight, shoulders back.� He told me. �Y-yes Sir�� I said and cleared my throat.&nbsp; �Let&#8217;s try it out then. Stand.� He commanded.

I stood up, feet apart and hands behind my back. �Close your eyes.� He said. I did. I stood there, naked in front of this total stranger. I wondered to myself why I trusted him. �Was it because he was handsome? That would be a stupid reason, could be true though. Or was it because my principle told me to trust him? A far more likely reason, but why did I trust her?�

Then I realised how all of this worked, why I was doing what I was. �Because Lord Kalki told me. He pruned me, and told me where to go. He told me to trust Lakshmi and she told me to trust Abjiri. How far would this chain of trust go? Would I trust someone Abjiri gave me too? How many links of this trust would I accept? Should I accept this link, between my principle and the man in front of me?�

My thoughts got interrupted by his hand&nbsp; touching my hip. I shivered in excitement and exhaled audibly. I felt his warmth coming closer to my naked body, I slightly opened my mouth hoping for a kiss. He whispered in my ear. �In five minutes, room-service will enter this room and give you your ticket. Your uniform is on the couch.� His hand left my hip and touched my shoulder instead. �You will put your peers at the academy to shame� I can tell.� He said, and I could&#8217;ve sworn that he smiled as he said that last part. �Such a sweet girl� I really wish you we&#8217;re five years older.� His thumb caressed my cheek. 

He kissed my forehead and without a moments notice, I heard the door close and I was alone.

I stood there and savoured the moment for a couple of seconds until I felt the train jerk to a halt. The internal speakers chimed softly, �We are now at New Delhi Central. Departure from the train is on the left hand side of the movement of the train. Continued journey to Kathmandu is scheduled in three minutes.� They informed me. 

I opened my eyes and looked out the window. A small child and mother stood on the station platform and looked at me. I yelped and tried to cover myself up as I realised that I was stark naked! I fell down to the floor with an audible thud and started crawling to the sofa where my clothes where.

�Mommy, why was de lady nekid?...� the child asked. �What? Where?� an upset voice replied. Thankfully, the mother hadn&#8217;t noticed me. �Up dere�� The boy said. �What have I told you about making up stories young man? Come here, wait till your father hears about this�� the voices trailed off.

I exhaled. I grabbed the bundle of clothes and held it up, looking at it. It was just one long purple piece of cloth. One side was a soft dark golden cloth. The other was a beautiful purple cloth with golden embroideries on it. I sat with it in my lap and my finger reached down under it and touched my pussy. �Sopping wet�� I thought, not all that pleased.

Alone again. It didn&#8217;t take many moments before my thoughts trailed back to Rajan. �What would he do if he could see me now? Would he go into a furious rage, and fight until I was free? Would he weep for me?� I thought. I softly brushed my wet index finger against my thumb, feeling my slipper juices on them. �Or would this get him off? Seeing me like this?� I closed my eyes and forced myself to think of other things. The clothes in front of me proved a good enough distraction.

I held the cloth up in front of me. �Like a sari?� I thought a bit confused and looked around for the top and the underskirt. None could be found but as I turned the cloth around.

I knew how to put on a Sari, but I usually at least had underwear. I took hold of the hem and fitted it around my waist, making folds in the cloth as I went along and tucked them into my waist, supporting the Sari. I usually wore Saris to school, so I wasn&#8217;t exactly unfamiliar with them. I continued wrapping about half the cloth around my waist to a foot length skirt and then happy with the result, I used the other end to fashion a cover for my upper body.

I wrapped under my arm and above my shoulder, making sure the fabric was crisscrossed at least once over my torso, wouldn&#8217;t want it falling off by accident now when I wasn&#8217;t wearing a top underneath. The sari was hanging off my hips and showed of a bared midriff around my waist, it crisscrossed up over my chest and covered my breasts, but left one shoulder bare as well. My hair hung freely over my back, reaching down to half way over my shoulders. The rest of the sari was slung over my shoulder, trailing down to the back of my knees. 

I made some final adjustments and suddenly froze as I heard a knock at the door. �Y-yes, who is it?� I asked, startled. I quickly looked down on myself to check that I was presentable. �Room service. I have a package for you miss.� A voice said. �Ehm� Enter.� I said.

The door hissed open and a grey haired thin man entered with a paper ticket in his one hand. �I was told to give this to the beautiful lady in cabin 1512, no questions asked.� He said with a wheezing voice. I extended my arm towards him for the ticket and he gave it to me. �Thank you.� I said, with maybe a little too much apparent gratitude in my voice.

�Godspeed mi- oh�� he stopped and looked at my sari. �He recognizes it?� I thought. �Last time I saw one your kind was back in -47. She was also riding the train, but from Pune to Darjeeling I think. Beautiful she was.� he wheezed. �She didn&#8217;t look as sad as you do though. Anything wrong miss?� he asked me. I looked up at him, not expecting the question. �No, no. Thank you kind sir.� I said and gently laid my hand on his forearm without thinking.

�This man must be nearly 100 years old.� I thought as I looked up at him. His face was weathered and wrinkly from old age, cheeks that was starting to hollow out and teeth that looked like they where about to fall out. He was in no ways a handsome man, but somehow he calmed me. His recognition of me calmed me.

�Do you know where I&#8217;m going?� I asked him. �Do you know what I am� or what I am to become?� I wondered. He gazed at me emptily for a couple of seconds. Was he processing my question, wits getting slow with old age? Or did he just not understand why I would ask such a thing?

�Off course, you&#8217;re on your way to become one of them lilies.� He said. My face turned to an expression of disbelief. �And you would still touch me?� I whispered. �I&#8217;m about to become a whore.� I said, eyes watering. �Why did I even bring this up? I must love tormenting my self, let it go Ayanna!� I told myself in my head.

�Young miss, We&#8217;ll have none of that now.� He said and laid his hands on my shoulders and looked meaningly at me, and said slowly. �It&#8217;s an honour to meet you.� 

Despite the tears streaming down my face, I felt happy for the first time in a long while.


* * *


Wearing only the piece of cloth wrapped around my body, a pair of simple sandals I found in the cabin and my ticket, which I had stored in one of the many folds of my sari, I got off in Kathmandu and had to run to get to my extension to Darjeeling. A well-groomed man in his later years held the door open for me courteously while his wife looked at him with a hint of distaste.

The majority of the people that I met didn&#8217;t recognise my sari for what it was. But a select few recognised it immediately and nearly all who did followed up on their recognition in some symbolic. A scholar stopped and bowed to me. A Brahmin woman slapped her husband&#8217;s shoulder, as he looked a bit too gladly in my direction. A young merchant raised his chin slightly and smiled in a youthful nod at me. An old lady wished me Godspeed.

I must say, I was used to getting a lot of attention, but this time I was actually enjoying it. I didn&#8217;t do anything, I just sat there in my sari, and people noticed me and I think respected me. It was a pretty overwhelming feeling, one that I had never experienced before but would do multiple times again.

I started to feel like a little princess.

As I got off in Darjeeling, there was a chauffeur waiting for me. He walked up to me and asked my name. When I replied, he said he would take me to the academy and that I should follow him. As I approached the minibus, I saw several other girls wearing the same type of sari that I did. �My schoolmates�� I thought. I stopped and looked at them for a while.

They we&#8217;re all fantastically pretty, with the graces of a model or a movie star, they stood around and chatted with each other. They seemed pretty nervous. I wasn&#8217;t the only one feeling like that then.

I approached them. �Hi�� I said and waved at them. They all turned and looked at me. One smiled and said �Hey you, what&#8217;s your name?�&nbsp; �I&#8217;m Ayanna. Servent Ayanna Farah.� I said and curtseyed, slightly. �Hey, I&#8217;m Chandra.� A dark skinned Indian girl with curly hair said. �Hey, I said.� We looked a bit sheepishly at each other. I took a breath and tried to break the ice. �So� did a well trained man with a sexy jaw undress you on the train too?� I said and balanced a bit tentatively on my heel.

Chandra covered her mouth with her hand and giggled. I smiled back at her. She leaned forward to me and whispered out loud �No, but a babe with the prettiest belly piercing this side of the Himalayans did.� She said and smiled shrewdly. Amused and blushing I looked down at the ground.

�You a bit insecure about me thinking women are beautiful?� she asked me. I looked up at her. �No, no. Not at all, actually I&#8217;m kind of relieved that you do. I think I do too� I&#8217;m just not used to it, I haven&#8217;t met anyone that&#8217;s gay before.� I explained myself.

�I really hope you are at least a bit of a lemon if you know what I mean, otherwise you won&#8217;t have a very pleasant stay at the school.� She whispered. 
�How come?� I wondered. �Well, it is an all girls boarding school. What do you think&#8217;ll happen?� she said and smiled.

�All right girls, it&#8217;s time. The ten of you get into the bus, it&#8217;ll be a three hour drive to the school and we&#8217;re not stopping, so if you have freshen up do so now.� The burly man looked around. �All right then, get in.� he bellowed.

I took Chandra&#8217;s hand and quickly ducked into the minibus, making sure that we sat down next to each other. We grabbed the backseat. And started chatting about where we came from. She was from Pune, I told he I was from New Babylon. 

Suddenly, a short and thin, dark skinned Indian girl silently padded up to us, with clasped hands resting by her waist. We both fell silent and looked at her. I felt my heart skip a beat. 

Her black neck long straight hair framed her heart shaped face perfectly. Her face hinted of an eastern heritage with ever so slightly curved, big dark eyes rested shyly on the floor. She was very small, petite some would say, surely one head shorter than me. Her narrow shoulders gave her a fragile look and her small delicate hands made her more feminine than any movie star.

I felt a jolt in my belly, and a tingling in my chest. My heart pounded softly in my ears and just as Chandra took a breath to speak I interrupted her. �Hey.� I said and smiled. �I&#8217;m Ayanna, would you like to sit in m�� I interrupted myself, realising I was about to ask her to sit in my lap. �What are you doing?!� my mind barraged me.

Chandra spoke up �Would you like to sit? That seat isn&#8217;t taken.� She said and pointed to the one next to her. �Thanks�� She said barely audible. Her voice was just as fragile and soft as she looked. I felt warmth spread over my chest and thighs. �I&#8217;m Chandra.� Chandra said and offered her hand. I saw it and reached over awkwardly over Chandra and offered my hand as well. �I&#8217;m Ayanna.� I said happily.

She sat down and shook Chandra&#8217;s hand and then mine. I embraced it softly, like a rare flower. Feeling the texture of her skin with my fingers. Her touch was like electrical currents coursing through my body, reaching my brain faster than I could react. I didn&#8217;t let go of her hand. �What&#8217;s your name?� I asked. �Ehm�� she said shyly and looked at me. �Is something wrong? What did I do?� I thought. �I&#8217;m from New Babylon, where are you from? Somewhere in Bangladesh?� I tried, seeing as she didn&#8217;t answer my first question.

A loud harrumph was heard from above. The short girl looked up and finally my mesmerized trance was broken. I felt something warm and soft brush against my cheek. I looked up.

The awkward position I managed to press myself into had forced me to push my head against Chandra&#8217;s breasts, and without me noticing I had done so for the last 30 seconds or so. I let go of her hand and felt the shameful heat rise to my cheeks and sat back in my seat. Chandra corrected her sari while the Bengali girl giggled, apparently amused. �Finally, a reaction.� I thought and smiled back at her.

�I&#8217;m Mahi.� She said and bowed simply from her seat. �Hi�� I said and smiled back. I looked at her and she looked at me. She seemed happy to have made a friend so easily. I was looking at her for different reasons. We talked about this and that for a couple of hours. Mahi didn&#8217;t speak often, but when she did I listened with undivided attention. I watched her soft lips moving as she mouthed the words and the way her hair swayed around her face as she turned or giggled shyly. �I haven&#8217;t felt this way since� since�� I thought, but was interrupted by Chandra.

She looked around and motioned for us to lean in. �I&#8217;ve dug up some information� about the school.� She whispered. She got our attention.

�Ok, what have you heard?� I asked excitedly. �Well, I&#8217;ve spent the last week digging up info on the net about the school. Needless to say, there&#8217;s almost none to be found. But I did find a Night Lily that I was able to contact.� She said, with a proud smile.

�Really? What did she say?� I wondered. �First she was a bit sceptical, but after I showed her my marching orders from Kalki she believed me. I did get the feeling though that she held a lot back, but she really seemed to be quite nostalgic about the school.� Chandra said. �How old was she?� I asked. �Maybe 30.� She replied.

�So what&#8217;s the school going to be like?� I asked. �You know about the school?� Mahi asked softly. �Yeah I do, now listen.� Chandra began and the two of us inched closer to her.

�There are three periods in our attendance at the academy. Each will last one and a half years. We will start out as juniors, then become sophomores and lastly become seniors. Now get a hold of this.� She said and looked at us. �We will have lessons in sex.� She said and smiled. Mahi blushed and I sat up straight in attention.

�You mean like sexology? Reading about biology and stuff?� I asked. �No silly.� She giggled. �I&#8217;m talking about teaching us how to make love to others.� I looked at her with big eyes. �Apparently, in our second period, we&#8217;re going to learn how to do it with women. And in our third period, we learn how to do it with men.� She whispered.

�What do we do in our first period then?� I asked. �According to her, the first period is like a trial period, hard work from when we wake up until we go to bed. I think we study the biology of sex then. Among other things.� Chandra noted. Mahi tugged gently on Chandra&#8217;s sari and tentatively asked, �How long is a period?� Chandra turned so we both could see her while we talked.

�A bit longer than a school year. Three semesters, one and a half year.� She answered. �Ooh�� Mahi responded. �So we&#8217;re here for four and a half years?� she asked. �I guess so.� Chandra replied.

�There is another school a couple of kilometres away from ours. The Academy of the White Tiger. It&#8217;s apparently like ours, but for boys.� Chandra explained. �Oh�� I cooed, liking what I heard. �We&#8217;re going to live in dorms, that are located in corridors that belongs to a specific house. There&#8217;s four houses, and each house has two corridors per floor and two floors. Each corridor has three dorms and each dorm houses three students. You with me?� she checked. We both nodded.

�Will we have to share bathrooms?� I asked. �I think so, she didn&#8217;t really say.� Chandra replied. �18 people in the same bathroom, that&#8217;s going to be messy in the mornings.� I pointed out.

The bus took a turn in on a small outlying road leading through the woods. After a while it stopped at a closed gate and the driver had to identify himself to a terminal in order for the gate to open.

�Now listen up, because this is important. You�� she said and pointed to both me and Mahi. ��are going to have a twin. Another girl that you will be doing everything in school with. You will do all assignments together, you will be graded together and you will most importantly live in the same dorm as your twin.� Chandra paused and looked at us.

�So, you&#8217;re going to live with your class mates?� Mahi asked quietly. �Not exactly.� Chandra said. �Each dorm consists of three rooms, and each room is inhabited by three pairs. One junior pair. Juniors are the ones attending the first period of the school. Then you have one sophomore pair. That&#8217;s the second period. And lastly you have a senior pair, and that&#8217;s off course the last period.� Chandra lectured on.

�So wait, we&#8217;re going to live with sophomores and seniors? How old are they?� I wondered. �Well, the seniors should be uh� three years older than us. So 18.� Chandra said. �Between 18 and 19.� Mahi noted from her corner.

I looked at Mahi. She hid so shyly behind her hair, but whenever she spoke she almost always said something smart. I watched as she pulled in her lower lip and wet it in her mouth. My gazing got interrupted by Chandra&#8217;s voice yet again.

�But here&#8217;s the thing. Apparently the seniors can order the juniors, us, around.� Chandra said in a solemn voice. �What? All of them?� I said, almost standing up from my seat. �Sssh! Quiet!� Chandra said in a covered voice. �Sorry.� I sat down, feeling a bit stupid. �Well? All of them?� I asked again, obviously alarmed. �No, not all of them. Just the pair in your dorm.� Chandra said. �What can they do to us?� Mahi asked with her faint voice. �I&#8217;m not really sure� The lily I talked to had to go then. But�� she said and pointed out through the window. �I guess we&#8217;ll find out soon.�

The three of us looked out at a collection of stone houses standing on a hill. A large marble house in five stories stood tall in the centre of the hill. Around it a number of smaller houses stood around them. A large garden could be spotted behind it. We drove by a wooden fence and inside a number of horses stood and treated themselves to an especially large tuft of grass. They looked up on our bus with curiosity as we passed by. In the distance, on another hill sticking out of the forest lay another mansion.

The Academy of the Night Lily loomed up above us, holding our futures.











Chapter 3 &#8211; A Warm Welcome
Year 2231, July
The Academy of the Night Lily

Our bus drove through another large metal gate and drove up to the courtyard of the area. In front of us were several other minibuses just like ours and lots and lots of students getting out or standing around, listening to their chauffeurs. Our bus parked among the others and the driver got out.

�Your principle awaits you in the auditorium.� One of them said in a loud clear voice, cutting through murmur of the crowd. He pointed us towards the largest of the buildings. It had what looked like a small clock tower at the top of it, showing the time. It looked very old. Might even be from the colonial era or the years after.

We truly were a crowd. �I really didn&#8217;t imagine there would be so many of us�� I thought as I flowed with the crowd. We entered a large and beautifully ornamented auditorium. There were seats for surely hundreds of persons, the lot of us wouldn&#8217;t even fill half of it. There was a large stage up front with a pulpit with a tall woman standing behind it. She was wearing a beautiful green sari with custom-made embroideries adorning it. Her hair was slightly grizzled, with streaks of grey hair coursing through it. She looked like a very well preserved fifty year old, with but a few wrinkles and signs of age. With the technology of today, appearances could however be very deceiving.

We walked in and sat down. I had lost both Mahi and Chandra in the crowd, so I sat down and looked around for them. But looking for two black haired girls wearing purple saris in a crowd of dark haired girls wearing purple saris proved to be a fruitless exercise.

Suddenly, a clear voice emanated from the speaker system. �Sit, down.� It said, with undisputable authority backing it up. Immediately, all present girls found a seat within seconds and sat down. I looked up at the pulpit, the woman up there was the one speaking. �Our principle? Lakshmi?� I wondered.

She paused for a second to look out on us. �Slaves. Slavery. To belong to someone else. You will have almost five years to ponder the meaning of this. I still do. I was once like you. Young. Na�ve. And a slave.� She said.

�I also sat here once upon a time and listened to my principle. Her speech was different, she had never been owned by another man. She didn&#8217;t have the perspective that I do. And that you will have, all in due time.� She continued.

�As of this moment, this school owns you. Quite literally, I foresaw the slave contracts this morning with my lawyer. And the school board has commissioned you to me. That means that for all purposes you are mine.� She raised her brow slightly and looked on us.

�Do not fear. My aim is not to hurt you neither is it to humiliate you. Being a slave is not something to be ashamed of, even though I can imagine that your parents might be. My mother was constantly worrying and my father didn&#8217;t talk to me for over two decades when Kalki ordered me to become a Night Lily.� She talked on.

�There isn&#8217;t much to be said here to you tonight, only a couple of pointers for your new life here on the academy. Now listen up and listen well, for I will say this only once.� She said with emphasis. Those who were foolish enough to chat with their neighbours stopped and looked up.

�There are only a few rules on the academy. Follow them, and you will be fine. Break them, and you will be punished.� She looked out on us.

�Obey your teachers.
Attend your classes.
Use of alcohol will result in punishment.
Use of narcotics will result in severe punishment.�

She looked up over her glasses on the audience. �We have a series of chambers in the basement that we thankfully don&#8217;t get to use that often, but I will not hesitate to throw anyone using heavy narcotics in it and throw away the key. Mark my words.�

�You will respect the curfew. Please note that elder students have more lenient curfews.
You will address your teachers respectfully and properly. If you do not know their title, Sir or Ma&#8217;am will suffice.
Outside of your living quarters you will wear your uniform. Please note that elder students have different uniforms.
You will under no circumstance leave the school grounds.� She said.

�Other than that, you need to know a couple of things before I send you on your way to meet your seniors and sophomores. Firstly, there are three stages of students here at the academy. You start out as a junior, that&#8217;s where you are now. After one and a half year, given that you pass, you will become sophomores. One and a half year later, you will turn into seniors. After one and a half year of seniority, you are a Night Lily.� She explained.

�In your room, there will be a junior, just like you, that will be your twin. The two of you will work together for the duration of your stay here at the academy. You will be graded together, you will do your chores together, you will do your homework together and you will do all your practical exercises together. Needless to say, get along with your twin. You will thank yourself for a little forced courtesy later on.� She said.

�The last thing I will say before I send you on your way, is that you will each have two mentors. In your room, there will be two juniors, you and your twin. There will be two sophomores and there will be two seniors. These seniors will be your mentors and guides for as long as you are juniors and I will commission you to them. Failure to obey them is failure to obey me.� She said.

�But just like the commonwealth has laws regarding how one may treat slaves, I have given them standing orders on how to treat you.� She glanced at the entrance to the hall. �On the wall behind you, are a large list and a map of where your living quarters are. I&#8217;m pretty sure that your dorm mates have prepared a celebration for your arrival. Good luck and if I didn&#8217;t say it the first time. Welcome.� She said and smiled.

Everyone got up and instantly started talking to each other. I looked around for Chandra and Mahi while walking to the map. Strange. Not a single word that the principle said was in any way pleasant, but somehow she left the room with a sense of purpose and communion. �Weird�� I thought.

It didn&#8217;t take long before the first couple of students trailed off. I tried to get a look at the list and bumped into Chandra. �Hey.� She said and looked at me. �Hi. Can&#8217;t see anything from here. Do you know where I&#8217;m placed?� I asked. �Yeah, she said. We&#8217;re both in the house of the rose. First floor, second dorm.� She said. �We&#8217;re in the same dorm?!� I exclaimed happily. �Yeah.� She said and smiled. �Oh, did you see where Mahi is. Is she with us too?� I wondered. �No she wasn&#8217;t. She, uhm� I think she was in the same house, the floor above us.� My heart sank.

We managed to wrestle our way through the crowd to the map to check how to get to the house of the rose. We got out and managed to get away from the crowd. The sun was setting in the distant hills. �Come on.� Chandra said and took my hand as she set off, already knowing where to go.

We walked up to a house two stories high made out of brick. Ivy climbed the walls next to the large wooden door that marked the entrance. A large metal sign of a red rose hung next to the door. �Floor one, dorm two�� Chandra repeated as we entered. We got into a corridor with two entrances to the building, the one behind us leading out and one on the other side of the building leading out to what looked like a garden. An elevator stood unused by the staircase, one stair leading up to the second floor and one leading down to the basement.

Other than that we&#8217;re two other doors. Marked with a &#8216;1&#8217; and &#8216;2&#8217; respectively. We stopped in front of number two and looked at each other, we heard voiced from inside. Music was playing from upstairs. Chandra reached out and knocked. I could hear my heart beating, thumping in my ears. Footsteps closed in on the door and it creaked open. A curvy girl opened and looked at us, smiling shrewdly. �How old could she be? Eighteen? Could she be a senior?� I wondered.

�Wait, before you come in�� she said and grabbed hold of a small camera. She held it up and scanned our retinas and pressed a button on it. �Registry match success. Servant Ayanna Farah and Servant Chandra Saraf, on registry.� It chimed softly.

�Good, we&#8217;re a full house then. I&#8217;m Rohena. Come in. And, no shoes in the corridor.� She noted. I took of my slippers and set them by the shoe stand in the hall. The lights were off and small round candles were lit and trailed off into the corridor. I looked around and noted three doors leading in to the living rooms and a large open common room were all the girls were gathered. In the common room, you could see over what looked like a large long bar into a long kitchen.

�Look what I found.� Rohena exclaimed playfully as we entered the common room. �Three rooms. The principle said six students in each room. That&#8217;s six sophomores and six seniors in this corridor that already lives here.� I thought and looked out into the common room. From the looks of it, they we&#8217;re probably already here. I saw a couple of them holding wine glasses. �So much for the rules.� I noted and raised an eyebrow.

Our elder students stood around the centre of the common room where four other juniors like us sat on the floor, naked. We both stopped and looked at each other. �Crap.� Chandra said, barely audible as we got pushed in to the middle of the ring.

Someone grabbed hold of my sari and quickly undid my top, exposing my black naked skin and my breasts. �Stop, what the he�� I began. Two more hands grabbed hold of my arms and held me. �Feisty this one.� Rohena noted as she sipped her wine. Two others giggled. They started to undo my skirt and then I kicked one of them on the shin as hard as I could. �Aah! �you little bitch!� she shrieked and grabbed my nipple and twisted it. Pain shot out from my chest as I bit my lip not to scream.

�Say that you&#8217;re sorry.� She insisted through gritted teeth as she twisted my nipple another quarter around. �That was really stupid Ayanna! Why, why did you do that?� I thought in retrospect. �I� I. I&#8217;m sorry.� I said, with my head cast down. �You better be.� she said and let go of my nipple. Someone jerked my sari and the skirt undid itself, leaving me naked. Chandra didn&#8217;t struggle as much and got undressed quickly. I sat down among the other girls.

�If you two cats are done clawing each other�� she said and a giggle rippled through the room. Needless to say, none of us down here was doing any of the laughing. ��lets begin.� She said and held up a piece of paper. �The principle gave me the job to declare which of you are twins. Ready?� she said and smiled. She sipped her wine and continued. �Chandra Saraf and Ayja Rumeran�� she said and looked down on us. 

Two of the girls meekly held their hands up. �Sit next to each other aside from the others.� She said casually. Ayja, a fair skinned girl with long black hair going down all the way to the floor. She slid along the floor and sat down by Chandra. �Hey� don&#8217;t worry.� Chandra whispered and laid her hand reassuringly on her knee. �Ayanna Farah� Ayanna. Is that Arabic?� Rohena asked. I cleared my throat, �Somali� I noted. �Ah� well, your twin is Kalia Jana.� She said.

I saw Kalia slide up to me. She was also a fair skinned northern Indian with straight black hair going down half her back. She was very thin, and probably quite tall. She took my hand and squeezed it hard. A bit surprised I turned and looked at her. She seemed clearly distressed. �Poor girl. I may scream and shout a bit, but I guess I&#8217;m still pretty cool headed when it matters.� I thought and looked at her. I squeezed her hand back, trying to reassure her. She felt it and looked up at me. She smiled faintly.

�The two of you that are left, feel free to use your impressive deductive skills and figure out which two the last pair is. For the record, you two are Asura Mandyam and Esa Nagi.� Rohena said and filled her now empty wine glass. They inched towards each other on the floor.

We sat on a soft carpet in the middle of the common room. The room itself was pretty big, designed to be able to handle the 18 people that lived in this dorm. A large TV screen was fitted on one of the walls, now projecting the moonlit landscape of a couple of hills. It was very still, almost like a painting.

Our elders chatted with each other and interestedly pointed at us. �What&#8217;s going on�?� Kalia whispered to me, her frightened eyes wandering about. A tall shadowed figure stood over the bar in the kitchen and uncorked another bottle of wine. She poured a glass and leaned onto the counter, clearly studying us.

I looked up at them. They we&#8217;re wearing two very distinct outfits. Half of them was wearing a full sari, a foot length skirt with the extra cloth wrapped around the chest. The other half was wearing a knee length skirt with knee high socks and a small top to cover their breasts, leaving their bellies exposed. �The one&#8217;s in the sari looks older, they must be the seniors�� I thought. One of the younger ones approached us and squatted down next to us. Kalia cowered away behind me, I noticed her and set myself between the elder and her.

�Would you look at that.� The sophomore said with a smile and pointed towards the seniors. I followed her direction with my eyes. She pointed to the crowd. �Are the ones in the saris seniors?� I asked. She looked at me and raised an eyebrow. �You sure are cool and analytical for one in your position.� She said and prodded my arm playfully. �Yes, they&#8217;re seniors.� She said. �Then you&#8217;re a second grader? A sophomore?� I wondered. She nodded.

�See those four?� she pointed over to four seniors. �Yeah�� I said, pulling my knees up to cover my chest. Having such a casual conversation strangely enough made me more self conscious of my nudity. �What about them?� She licked her lips. �Can&#8217;t you see the power play? They&#8217;re fighting over you. Pulling every little favour they have outstanding, emptying their secret stashes, threatening with all the incriminating evidence they can find. They all want to pick first.� She said.

�Pick? What?� I said bewildered. �They&#8217;re coming to an arrangement of who gets to pick you first. They&#8217;ve been preparing for this for the last six months surely. I&#8217;m thinking ahead, I&#8217;ll start now.� She noted. I saw Rohena, the voluptuous senior that greeted us walk around the bar and into the kitchen. She padded up to the shadowy figure and leaned over and whispered something in her ear. �Those two don&#8217;t seem all that committed. They already lost?� I wondered.

She giggled. �No, no� that&#8217;s Ro and Neeshka. They&#8217;re not committed because� they&#8217;ve already won.� She said, making a grand gesture. �Ro helps out the doctor in the infirmary and Neeskha&#8217;s the chairman of the student disciplinary board.� She leaned forward and whispered. �They&#8217;ve got dirt on everyone.� She smiled and ruffled my hair. �Have fun� she said and left.

I turned my head and looked up behind the bar. Neeshka, the shadow stood there alone and leaned over the bar. �Staring at me?� I thought. I looked around. Chandra was silently chatting with her twin Ayja. Asura and Esa silently had their gazes locked on the floor in front of them. Kalia was holding my hand and trying to make herself as small as possible. �Poor thing, she really is that scared?�

Suddenly, Rohena emerged from the shadowed kitchen. �I&#8217;m not sure exactly what you&#8217;ve been told, but this is how this is going down. We, the seniors of this dorm, are in the process of deciding which of you we want in our rooms. Yes, it&#8217;s our decision. But we feel that we can&#8217;t really do that without some quality testing. So for the respect of your alleged virginity, we&#8217;re going to start easy.� She said with a superior smile.

�I wonder how much wine she have had. I&#8217;ve seen her refill once already, she looks lucid though�� I thought. �Take your twin&#8217;s hand.� She said. We already held each others hand. �Now look each other in the eye.� She commanded. I turned and looked at Kalia, she slowly looked up from the floor and back to me. �Sit closer. Hey Africa don&#8217;t be so shy.� She said. �It&#8217;s Ayanna.� I sniped back. �Idiot!� I closed my eyes in revelation of what I just did.

The one&#8217;s who hadn&#8217;t closed their eyes would note that Rohena&#8217;s face turned sour but then the shadowy Neeshka, still standing secluded in the kitchen softly shook her head at her. She took a deep breath and continued. �I said sit closer, I can show you how if you&#8217;d like.� I inched closer towards Kalia. My knee was resting in her lap now. �There&#8217;s one thing that&#8217;s the same among all of you. One fact that brings you all together. The person you&#8217;re holding hands with, the persons who&#8217;s eye you&#8217;re gazing into. The person whom you&#8217;re naked with and more or less sitting her lap, good job Ayanna.� She noted. I broke my gaze and quickly looked up on Rohena, somewhat annoyed.

�Well that person in front of you, is a lesbian.� She said. Chandra and Ayja still looked at each other. Esa and Asura let go of each other and pushed each other away. I looked up at Rohena in surprise and Kalia blushed. �Now kiss her.� She said and took a sip of wine.

Ayja sat up on her knees and let her arms embrace Chandra&#8217;s head almost immediately. Surprised, the two fell to the ground in a tangle of hair and limbs. Esa and Asura looked around bewildered and I felt Kalia grab my other hand. I inched closer, I felt my heart race. �I&#8217;m supposed to kiss her? I&#8217;ve never kissed a girl.� I thought. I slid my hand along Kalias arm and felt her raging pulse. Her dilated pupils made her eyes look even bigger and blacker than they used to. I leaned forward and let my hand slide up her arm and back to her shoulder, holding her.

I extended my neck up and rose above her, looking down on her. She closed her eyes and parted her lips slightly. I slowly let my head sink down towards her. I felt her rapid warm breath faintly on my lips. Her chest heaved as she breathed and mine did too. I leaned forward and felt my nipples brush against hers as our lips met. She moaned a bit and let her hands wander up to my neck, and chest, pressing me against her. Our lips kissed each other and I felt her warm soft tongue touch mine in the wet jungle that was our mouth.

I heard Rohena&#8217;s voice in the distance. �Very good girls. Keep going until I say stop.�

She drew her fingers in my hair and let her other hand touch my leg, sliding it to the side. I felt her nudge and moved it voluntarily. I took her hand again and braided my fingers into hers. She spread her legs and inched closer to me. She slid her one leg over the one I just flexed out. She grabbed my other knee and lifted it a bit, sliding her other leg underneath it and crisscrossed her legs around my back. I sucked gently on her tongue as I realised that she was sitting with her legs spread wide, and so did I. Then I realised that we we&#8217;re both stark naked. A shiver coursed through my body. I felt my nipples tingle violently as they brushed against her soft skin. She let her legs embrace my body and pulled me closer.

I realised that our pussies we&#8217;re just inches from each other. �Are we agile enough to let them touch?� the thought rushed through my brain and drowned with countless others. The feel of my nipples touching Kalias breasts. The sensation of hers stroking the underside of mine. The way she smelled. The way her hair felt between my fingers. The sound of my heart beating in my ears. The taste of her lips. The sensation of her tongue exploring my mouth. The wetness gathering between my legs.

I slid my hand down her belly and touched her soft pubic hair. Letting each strand brush against my fingers until I started to feel moisture. Then I let my hand slide just over her pussy without touching it and landed on her thigh instead. I felt her gasp and shiver in my arms. A memory I would never forget.

�All right girls, that&#8217;s enough. Let go of each other and sit up straight. I let my lips go of Kalias, heart still racing. I looked into her eyes. I saw raw lust and wanting. If we were alone now, she&#8217;d jump me again. We sat up straight next to each other and faced the others. I felt her take my hand. I looked up at her and smiled as I squeezed it back. Esa and Asura sat up quickly, both blushing heavily. Apparently, they finally let go and got to it. Chandra lay on top of Ayja, whose long silky smooth hair had spilled out over half the floor. Ayja&#8217;s legs had embraced Chandra&#8217;s hips and we&#8217;re pulling her down to her, they we&#8217;re kissing gently.

�I said break it up you two.� Rohena said and stepped in and pushed Chandra off with her foot. She emitted a surprised yelp as she fell off and down to the ground. �There&#8217;ll be lots of time for that later.� The crowd laughed at her surprised vocalization as she fell. She rubbed her hip and looked pretty embarrassed. Rohena set down an empty wine bottle on the floor. �Form a circle around this.� She said. �The sense of impending doom that permeated us a couple of minutes ago was long gone. Some are slightly embarrassed, like Esa and Asura. Some are horny and longed for release, like Kalia and me. And some� well some are in love.� I thought and looked on Ayja sitting in Chandra&#8217;s lap, kissing her embracing hands.

Rohena laid down a deck of cards alongside the bottle. �As this bottle will spin, it will point on someone. Whoever that is will draw the top card, read it out loud and then do what it says.� She said. I shivered slightly from pure excitement. I looked at the deck of cards. It was a thick deck, as big as an ordinary card deck. We all sat there and looked at the bottle. As usual when no one else took charge over the situation, I did. I reached out, grabbed the bottle and gave it a good spin.

�Eeh!� Asura exclaimed and pulled her hands up to her mouth. I smiled. It spun around and we followed it intently. Chandra kissed Ayja&#8217;s neck while she giggled and squirmed a bit in response. Esa and Asura gave each other a quick look. Kalia stared at my breasts, when she noticed me noticing her she looked up surprised and then turned her head down embarrassed. Everyone was already caught up in each other. Was this our doing, Rohena&#8217;s or Kalki&#8217;s? Probably a bit of all three.

The flask turned slower and slower until it finally stopped, pointing at Chandra and Ayja. �Oh�� Chandra said. �It&#8217;s more towards Ayja� Rohena ruled. �Pull a card.�

Ayja slid out of Chandras embrace and popped of the first card, held it near a candle and read it. She put the card down and blushed heavily. �Read it.� Someone in the crowd exclaimed. �I�� she started. �I will lay down�� her voice choked a bit. She cleared it audibly. �I&#8217;m sorry.� The card wavered a bit in her hand. �I will lay down on the floor and masturbate until I come�� she said, the last part barely audible. A wave of soft �Oohs� and �Aahs� rolled through the crowd.

�Here&#8217;ll be fine.� Rohena said and pointed on the floor, just next to where the seniors stood. Ayja gracefully held up her thigh long hair and gingerly padded over and lay down next to their feet. Two sophomores sat down and took her shiny hair and carefully laid it out over the floor behind her. The candle-lights flickered over her soft smooth light skin. Her chest heaving with her small perky breasts softly rolling with her body. Her hand crawled down her belly to her tuft of jet-black pubic hair. Her fingers entered and she closed her eyes as she began touching herself.

Chandra crawled over to the other side of the ring and sat down and looked at her twin pleasuring herself. I apparently enjoyed watching as much as the others, but I was more interested in what the next card said. I reached in and prodded Chandra on her shoulder. �Heads up girl.� I said and spun the bottle.

�That&#8217;s the spirit.� A voice from the crowd said. I looked around and tried to identify here, but there were too many of them. I looked back at the bottle. �Am I secretly wishing it will stop at me?� I wondered. It spun slower and slower until it finally stopped. It pointed towards Chandra. Esa and Asura collectively exhaled. Chandra reached in and pulled a card.

Moans were heard from where Ayja lay down and we all looked over. She had her one hand cupped around her pussy, with a finger inside her slowly pushing in and out. Her other hand was slowly twirling her left nipple. The two sophomores had stopped playing with her hair and now caressed her head instead.

A foot prodded Chandra&#8217;s shoulder. �Go on, read it.� Chandra looked over at her card. �It has some instructions.� She said and stood up. �Oh, a standing card.� Someone noted, and everyone grew silent. �I will pleasure the first senior for twenty minutes who says &#8216;Dibs&#8217;.�

A veritable cacophony of seniors calling dibs erupted, cut short by some hysterical laughter. I looked up at the bar and the shadowy figure still stood there in the moonlight. I heard nothing from her, she didn&#8217;t even care to call it out. �Jhala was first.� Rohena ruled, she got consensus from the others. A senior with curvy hips and a red gem pierced to her belly button walked forward with a pleased smile.

She took Chandra&#8217;s hand and pulled her up from the floor. �Follow me.� She said and padded through our little circle and to the sofas in towards the room. She sat down in a large armchair. �Undo my sari.� She commanded. Chandra reached in and tugged at the folded hems at the waist and folded up the smooth satin cloth and laid them over the chair&#8217;s arms, exposing the seniors full hips and smooth unblemished legs. She softly tossed her one leg over the other. �Before we can start, I need some more wine.� She said and handed her empty glass to Chandra.

Chandra took it and hurried away. She walked up to a couple of sophomores sitting by a table and casually chatting and managed to talk her way into a glass of the wine, but not before she kissed both their feet. They giggled approvingly as she walked back to her waiting senior.

We on the other hand looked at each other, the bottle and the deck of cards. It slowly spun around until it stopped pointing at me. The butterflies in my belly had butterflies of their own, I clenched my legs together, feeling my wetness grow as I reached forth and took a card, careful to not flip the card over.

I drew it over to me and held it close to my body before I turned it, making sure no one else saw. Kalia tried to sneak a peak, but teasingly I turned so she couldn&#8217;t see. I read it out loud. �On a girl of my choice, I will lick, suck and nibble on her tits until she tells me to stop.� I said, much to the crowd&#8217;s enjoyment. I felt a jolt in my belly of excitement as I looked around. �So who&#8217;ll it be?� Kalia asked as she placed her hands behind her back, pushed her chest forward and gave me a horny look. Esa and Asura were still blushing and hoping they&#8217;d disappear. Jhala drank the wine Chandra had fetched her while the fifteen year old licked her feet.

I looked up from the cosy armchair in the common room and up to the bar desk and the kitchen behind it. �Her!� I said and pointed at the shadowy figure behind the bar as I stood up from the floor. The room grew quiet as they turned and looked at her. She looked at me, her pitch-black face revealed nothing. The shape of her curly hair ruffled a bit in the moonlight as I imagine that she slightly turned her head as she was studying me.

�I&#8217;ll pass.� She finally said.

�What?! She can&#8217;t pass!� I thought first in astonishment and later in anger. �She doesn&#8217;t think that I&#8217;m good enough for her?� I looked around and no one seemed the slightest upset or startled. �Maybe I ain&#8217;t?� I thought, now sad instead.

�Pick a new one.� Someone from the crowd said. I looked around. Everyone was beautiful, and much older than me. I felt the heat rise to my cheeks as I imagined sucking their nipples. But finally I found the sexiest creature in the room by far.

Ayja had been masturbating herself for quite some time now. She was moaning loudly and arching her back every now and then. She hadn&#8217;t gotten off yet though. I walked forward to her and sat down next to her. The fair skinned Indian lay with closed eyes on the floor, next to her were a line of elaborate shoes worn by the seniors. She was oblivious to just what was supposed to descend on her as I leaned forward and opened my mouth.

Her Aryan fair skin, so common among the northern Indians contrasted my black as I laid my hand on her belly. She tensed and stopped for a while. I whispered �Until you say stop.� In her ear and then I let my lips embrace her right nipple. I closed my eyes and savoured the moment. I had never tasted another woman&#8217;s nipple before. Somehow I had imagined that it would have a unique taste, enticing my palette. But it didn&#8217;t, it was almost entirely tasteless but still among the sexiest things I&#8217;d ever done.

I felt her warm stiff nipple between my lips, slightly moving as I touched it with my tongue. I felt a trickle going starting to go down the backside of my thigh. My other hand went up and touched hers that was holding her other breast. I gently squeezed it in a greeting between hands before I slithered under it, and touched her other breast. Her moan reverberated through her chest and travelled into my lips, intensifying the sound profoundly. I let go of her nipple with my lips and kissed the underside of her breast with an open mouth, making sure as much of her skin as possible was touched by my lips.

I lay over her belly and drew my hair over her chest and throat. I wanted to see her face. She had moved both her hands down to her pussy now and was shamelessly spreading her legs as she rubbed herself. I kissed her other breast and licked my way up to her areola. I let my tongue touch her left nipple and then it happened. She squealed and arched her back. Hyperventilating she pressed her eyes shut, her body convulsing as she came. I could swear that I heard her muscles tighten as I lay with my head on her chest, sucking on her nipple, and caressing her other breast.

Through a closed mouth she squealed like the little schoolgirl she was. The two sophomores behind her had come back to caress her head once again as she came. I continued sucking on her nipples as the card had ordered me to. She finally slumped down.

Slightly delirious she brought her hands up to her head and looked at them, damp and glistening. She dried them off on her right breast, smearing her juices all over it. She patted me on my head and giggling said, �You missed a spot�� I looked at it realising I had no idea what pussy tasted like. I quickly switched breast but it had already dried up, giving it only a slightly musky smell.

She patted my head. �You can stop.� I did and looked up on her. �Thanks.� She said shyly. �You&#8217;re welcome.� I smiled at her and slid back to the circle. In the distance I saw something that made me stop in my tracks and stare with big eyes. Chandra was sitting with her head between Jhalas thighs in the chair. �She&#8217;s eating her out!� I thought. Jhala had possessively slung her foot over Chandras back and pressed her face into her groin. With one hand toying with her hair and the other holding her wine glass, she was softly talking down to her. �I wonder what she&#8217;s saying. I can&#8217;t hear it over this crowd�� I thought as I sat down in the circle.

Things had happened while I was gone. Kalia was giggling while a blushing Asura was sucking her toes. I looked at Kalia first thinking she was ticklish. �She&#8217;s not� she&#8217;s�� I looked at Asura. I looked back at Kalia. �She&#8217;s getting off on Asura&#8217;s blushing.� I thought as I noticed Kalia&#8217;s hand lazily touching herself between her legs. �She&#8217;s getting off on Asura&#8217;s humiliation? She&#8217;s really transformed from the scared little girl she was when we got here.� I mused. I looked at Esa who looked at me worried, knowing that I was that crazy bottle spinning chick.

I smiled at her and leaned slightly forward. She looked dismayed. I spun the bottle. Kalia and Asura looked busy, Ayja came back and sat down in the circle and stared at Chandra who was captivated by the senior, making Chandra lick her pussy. Just me, Ayja and Esa.

The bottle spun and stopped at Esa, her first card. She reached in and pulled the card. She looked at it, looking truly horrified. �Is she crying?� She stood up. �A standing card.� Someone said and the room fell quiet. Only Kalias soft giggling and Chandras silent lapping was heard.

Shaking, she read the card. �She&#8217;s really afraid.� I thought, not so happy with the entire arrangement anymore. �I will g-g� give myself to the first senior who can show a� a� a strap-on.� She stuttered out. The girl&#8217;s apparent distress went ignored as the crowd quickly started to get to their rooms to get their strap-ons. �What&#8217;s a strap-on anyway?� I wondered. But everyone&#8217;s rummaging around was cut short as the shadowy figure behind the bar. Neeskha, Rohena&#8217;s twin sat down her wineglass, on the bar counter and opened up a loose bar section in the middle of it and stepped out, in one swift motion.

She stepped into the light and the front of her sari was open, displaying a leather strap-on with a slightly tanned dildo sitting squarely on it. Neeshka herself was tall and athletic. Her full brown hair waved down the back of her shoulders and brown eyes with a tinge of gold gleamed in the candlelight. I looked down on the contraption fastened on her pelvis and realised what it was for. So did Esa, she stepped backwards in fear.

Neeshka took a step forward. �I believe I was first�� she said with a lopsided smile. The crowd sighed and a couple of them laughed. �Typically Neeshka, always wearing that damn thing.� Someone said. The crowd&#8217;s soft chatter again permeated the room 

Neeshka took a step forward and touched Esa&#8217;s arm. �Don&#8217;t be afraid girl, I&#8217;ll be gentle.� She said with the same smile. Somehow, I didn&#8217;t believe her. Esa stepped back again and managed to step into one of the living flames. She yelped and fell down. Neeshka&#8217;s only response was to giggle. �Just like Kalia giggled at Asura�� I thought and looked down at Kalia, still enjoying her obedient little Asura.

I looked back at Esa. The girl was terrified. �Enough.� I thought as I stood up and walked up and placed myself between Neeshka and Esa. Her smile vanished and she stopped.

Being surely half a foot taller than me and several sizes wider over the shoulders, she looked down on me. �Can&#8217;t you see that she&#8217;s terrified?� I asked, looking angrily at the senior. She snorted at me. �Get out of my way Africa.� and firmly pushed me aside. I was many things, but I wasn&#8217;t a quitter. I walked up in front of her again. 
�Seriously, stop it.� I said, holding out my arms, blocking her way. She leaned down towards me, smiling widely, her teeth visible all the way up her cheeks. �Seriously Africa, get out of my way.� she said and shoved me.

I staggered back and almost lost my balance. I felt the rage pound in my chest. I clenched my fist, took two steps forward and lunged it right at her face as hard as I could. The knuckles hit the side of her mouth and momentarily transformed her face into a stretched rubber doll as the momentum of the punch grabbed her skin and muscles and pulled it with them. She staggered backwards and touched her lip, looking at me incredulously.

Rohena came rushing out of the crowd �You fucking wh�!� she raised her hand against me but was stopped by someone else who caught it. Both me and Rohena looked at Neeshka as she held Rohena&#8217;s raised hand. �No love. Let me�� she said and licked the blood of her finger. She lunged up at me and grabbed my arms, pressing me up against the wall. �I&#8217;ll grant you your wish Africa, I&#8217;ll stay clear of that girl.� She said and nodded at Esa. �I&#8217;ll have you instead.�

A wave of mixed feelings washed over me. I was grateful that she stopped harassing Esa, but as I looked up on her she seemed more a monster than anything else. I was afraid. And somewhere a small sensation of excitement was kindled.

I felt her firm hands on my arms, her penetrative gaze looked down on me as she studied my face, my neck and then my bosom. She licked her lips and leaned forward �One complaint, and I will have you gagged.� She said and tugged on my arm, pulling me with her as she walked in towards the common room. I resisted a bit, trying to get out of her grip. She slapped me hard on the ass. �Aa!� I yelped, more surprised than hurt.

Without a word she walked me up to a divan. She pushed me backwards and I fell down on it. Lying down, I raised myself on my arms. She quickly grabbed my wrists and pulled them away, taking away my support. With a yelp, I fell down again. Rohena walked up to us and dropped a heap of rope at the ground. I looked at it with big eyes, knowing what it meant.

She tied my wrists to each leg of the divan, and secured them tightly, all while Neeshka sat on me and held down my arms. �Let, me go!� I yelled. �Ro love, I promised this one a gag if she complained. Could you gag her for me?� Neeshka said complacently. �My pleasure.� She said and pulled out a red handkerchief that she pressed into my mouth, pulled around my neck and tied off. �oa&#8217;k nooh tsh.� I mumbled, my speech unintelligible. I felt my nipples harden and scratch on the divan underneath me.

 �Oh and Ro.� She said and grabbed her strap-on. �I hear Africans have deep cunts. Size me up one, will you.� Neeshka said. I felt that jolt in my belly again. �Damn it, not now!� I thought as I felt a tingling sensation travelled from my breasts to my pussy. All I saw was Rohena&#8217;s simple smile and nod as she walked away.

Neeshka turned around and sat on my thighs, tying my ankles to the divans legs behind me, forcing me spread out like a large human X. She tied me spread eagle. I looked to the side, lying on the divan. Most of the room&#8217;s eyes were on me. The dark skinned Asura and Esa held each other, looking at me. Esa seemed guilt ridden. Chandra looked up from her senior&#8217;s thighs and looked worriedly at me as well before Jhala took her head and guided her back in, followed by moans of pleasure.

Ayja was nowhere to be found and Kalia sat on the floor watching me, with one hand slowly touching her pussy at the same time. �She&#8217;s getting off on this too?� I thought. Rohena came back with two red dildos, one larger then the other.

�You know, I was going to be kind and use the small five and a half-incher on Esa.� She said and popped of the dildo on her strap-on and laid it on the divan in front of me. �And I planned on being gentle with her. My first impression was just for show. But you� well. I have no such intentions with you.� She said and placed a larger dildo next to small one. �This is a six incher, about the size of a normal grown mans cock. This�� she said contently. �Is a seven incher. Guess which one I&#8217;m using.� She said and left me with the five and six incher lying in front of me.

I moaned complainingly behind my gag. I didn&#8217;t really try to say something, just to let her know that I was objecting. I felt a trickle run down my pussy onto the divan. �What?!� I thought. I hadn&#8217;t been able to stop and feel what my body was telling me. My breasts tingled. My pussy was in heat, my back shivered, my belly had an entire colony of butterflies in it. I felt the shameful heat rise to my face.

�No! no� I can&#8217;t� I can&#8217;t get off on this. Something is wrong.� I thought. I tried to cover up my excitement, found some slack in the ropes and pressed my thighs together. Neeshka saw it and tried to jostle my thighs apart, but I pressed for all I was worth. She leaned forward, I felt her sari brush on my ass and shoulders, her hair landed on my head. I heard her lick her lips in my ear and she whispered, �There&#8217;s always a way in.�

She grabbed a thick pillow from the sofa nearby and laid it next to me. With both hands she grabbed my hips, and I yelled into the gag, mostly out of surprise. She lifted me up and placed the pillow under my belly and let me go. This forced posture to change. As my belly and hips were elevated, my legs were now at an angle with them. I realised that my pussy must be peeking out from behind, no matter how much I pressed my legs together. I shivered noticeably.

Neeshka stopped and looked down on me. She placed her warm hands on my ass cheeks and trailed them downwards, pulling the flesh of my thighs outwards, exposing my pussy. I knew how wet it was, I closed my eyes in shame.

She touched it with her fingers. �Mmnnh!� I tensed and arched my back. �It seems I&#8217;ve mistaken you Africa. I thought you were just like me�� she said in a more serious tone than she&#8217;d ever had during the entire night. She rubbed my juices between her fingers. �Very well then.� she said and tossed of her sari. She got up on the divan and stood astride my legs on her knees. She laid her one hand on my ass and the other on her strap-on, guiding it to my pussy. I felt the tip of it touch my lips. I whimpered behind my gag, tensed again and bit down on the gag.

I broke my hymen less then a year ago when I fingered myself. �I&#8217;ve never had anything larger then three of my own fingers down there. Which, when I think of it, should be broader then this. So this shooooaaAAH!� I hollered as she laid her weight on the dildo, pressing it into me. Seven inches of hard rubber slid inside me and filled me with a sensation I had never felt before. My entire pussy forcibly stretched and expanded to fill out with her rubber cock. It strained and I felt a huge almost unbearable pressure inside me. But at the same time, the dildo rubbing against my inner lips and pressing inside me filled me with a warm sense of pleasure. 

It pressed on the inside of me, sending jolts of pleasure up to my brain. I felt her warm thighs rest on my legs, her belly resting on my ass and her hair touching my shoulders as she leaned down towards me. �I was right, you are deep Africa.� She said as she licked my neck. I resented her using my body, I felt like her sex toy. I pulled against the bonds and tried to brush her off. The ropes held as my arms strained against them, I whimpered through my gag.

�You know there&#8217;s a small bump on the inside of my harness that rubs against my clit for each stroke I do in your cunt. I&#8217;m gonna keep doing this until that deep cunt of yours makes me come.� She whispered, got up and pulled out again, only to push back in, just as deep again.

I moaned loudly and so did she. She grabbed my hips and started moving faster. I felt her rubber cock move in and out of me. Her nails clawed into my skin as she tightened her grip around my flesh. I heard her thighs smack into mine and I felt the rubber cock invade me, the sensation was on the verge of being so overwhelming it was uncomfortable. 

The pillow had managed to wrinkle up between my legs and my pussy was humping it every time Neeshka stroked into me. It felt incredibly good, as waves of pleasure coursed through me. My pelvic muscles tensed involuntarily as I felt the pillow stroke my clit directly. I moaned audibly. Heavy breathing through my nose caused me to start sweat slightly. I looked out in the room but my eyes could barely focus on anything.

I felt Neeshka&#8217;s hair brush on my skin as she shifted position and slid her hand under my chest, feeling my tits. Her breasts brushed against my back as she laid down over me, still softly fucking me. She laid her hands around on my shoulders, heaving herself up. Supporting her weight on me, pressing me down into the divan as she moaned in pleasure when the harness stroked her clit in just the right spot. She started to breathe rapidly.

�I&#8217;m making her come.� I thought to myself. The mere idea of it jolted my pussy, making it even more sensitive. I squealed as she fucked me harder, my ass cheeks slapping against her. The pillow again touched my clit, and a third time. Neeshka&#8217;s tireless rubber cock fucked me and I felt the tension build up in my belly, my thighs and my pussy.

She let out a loud grunt and dug her nails into my back as she doubled her speed. She started spasming, I felt her thighs twitch against mine. Making her come by being her fuck toy was the last drop. All that tension in me spilled over and I screamed out loud in my gag I felt my body buck, twitch and spasm. My pussy clamped down on the invading phallus. My back arched, my arms pulled hard on my bonds and my legs nearly threw Neeshka off me and she had to grab my hips and press me down to keep me in place.

Earth shattering and mind numbing, I came harder than I ever thought possible, and moments later I passed out.









Chapter 4 &#8211; A First Time for Everything
Year 2231, July - First day at school
The Academy of the Night Lily


When it rains, it pours.

This old proverb was especially fitting for old India where the year has three main seasons. The hot season between May and July, the monsoon season between August and September and finally the in-between season for the rest of the year.

The downpour of thousands of raindrops smattering on trees outside woke me up. At first, I didn&#8217;t open my eyes. Rain was so uncommon in New Babylon, I always wanted to stay in bed forever when it rained, listening to the way it smattered on my window.

Someone snored quietly below me. I was suddenly wide-awake, painfully aware that I wasn&#8217;t home in Babylon anymore. I sat up and looked around at the untidy room filled with sleeping girls lying on the sofas, in the armchairs or simply on the floor. I looked around and counted three other juniors with me. As I did, the events of yesterday slowly started trickling back into my mind.

I looked down on the floor, seeing scattered cards and an empty wine bottle. I remembered being pushed into the circle of my elders, stripped of my sari and sat down with my peers.

Someone had laid a blanket over me. I shifted my body and felt the blanket on my body �I&#8217;m naked.� I lazily thought as I yawned and pulled it over my shoulders. A pillow lay on the ground beneath my divan. I remembered it, and I remembered Neeshka&#8217;s purring voice in my ear, �There&#8217;s always a way in��

I remembered how I hit her and broke the skin on her lip, and I remembered her response, with the ropes and the strap-on. I pulled the blanket closer and sat up straight. And I remembered how I felt about it. I froze. �Did I come?!� I wondered, almost frantically.

I reached down and touched my pussy. I gingerly stuck a finger inside me. �I&#8217;m a bit sore�� Embarrassed I stood up and tried not to think about it. I looked out of the window and saw the torrential rain pouring down outside. Monsoon season had just started in the province of Bangladesh, where the school was located. We didn&#8217;t have monsoons in New Babylon. �That&#8217;s very soothing�� I thought as I looked out and yawned again.

Bottles lay scattered on the floor, burnt out candles stood everywhere. Blankets, pillows and juniors lay all over the room. A plant had been pushed over in the corner, soil spilling out over the floor. A window was left open and a puddle of water was building from the intruding rain. I padded up to it and closed it shut.

I never realised how big the room was until now. Nearly 20 girls lived here. The common room was large. It could easily fit ten persons or so comfortably in the couches and sofas. Getting all of us in there shouldn&#8217;t be too uncomfortable. The common room in itself had room for more than just sofas and armchairs. Two wooden tables with room for six people each, a large vidscreen on the wall, a divan, several plants and plenty of open space made the room feel spacious.

Peeking through the doors of living rooms I realised that they were pretty big as well, giving plenty of room for all the six girls living in each of them. 

I finally got to see the kitchen up front. Long and spacious, with two stoves, two ovens and more utensils and machines than I thought possible, it looked clean and robust. I searched with my eyes after the fridge and the pantry but couldn&#8217;t find any of them. �This is just a place to prepare food, but where do they store it?...� I turned my head and saw a curtain separating the kitchen from whatever lay behind it. �Bingo.� I thought and shimmied through it.

My foot bumped into something on the floor and I nearly lost balance and fell. I managed to grab a shelf and a pack of coffee. It fell down. Surprised and big eyed I swooped down after it and landed on my ass holding the crumbled pack in a tight fist, powder spilling out all over me and the floor. �Crap, someone&#8217;s gonna have to pick that up�� I thought as I looked at the mess I made. �Aa-Aah---A-cho!� I sneezed, spreading the fine brown dust around even further.

In front of me lay Chandra and Ayja on the floor undisturbed by the mess I had created mere meters from them. They slept soundly in each other&#8217;s arms. Next to them lay an empty wine bottle. �Oh�� I cocked my eyebrow and wondered if getting drunk here for the first time was such a good idea. They were both naked on a thin carpet resting on top of the stone floor. �Looks cold.� I found another blanket and laid it over them, tucking them in.

Chandra stirred a bit in her sleep. I padded over them and looked around. Two fridges, two freezers and a large wooden door, which I expected was the pantry. I opened the door up and turned on the light and saw a huge walk in pantry almost as large as my room back in New Babylon.

My tummy rumbled as I looked around at all the bread, the jam, the cereal and what looked like a cookie jar. Curious, I opened it up but to my great dismay found it empty. I grabbed a loaf of bread and took a bite out of it as I walked out.

When I opened the door and walked out I bumped straight into Rohena. She let out a startled noise. �I&#8217;m sorry.� I said and nodded apologetically. She was wearing a dark blue bath-robe and looked at me before glancing down at Chandra and Ayja on the floor. Her gaze lingered at them before returning to me. �Good morning Ayanna.� she simply said. �Get me the tomato bread and the honey while you&#8217;re in there.� she&nbsp; ordered as she looked me straight in the eye.

�Sure.� I ducked back in and quickly found her bread and honey. �Have breakfast with me.� she said, obviously meant as neither a question nor an invitation. �Sure.� I said again. �Milk, glasses and plates.� A bit too tired, I wasn&#8217;t really following her. �Pardon?� I asked.

�Do you find your way around the kitchen yet? Milk, glasses and plates. Bring them to the table, and keep it down.� Rohena said. It was hard to describe, but her presence was very commanding. Not sexy domineering as Abjiri on the train yesterday, but more matriarchal. She simply expected things to get done, and that made a very strong impression.

�Sure thing Ro&#8217;.� I said and smiled. �Rohena.� she corrected me. I looked up at her. �Sorry��. After getting setting the table I sat down with her. She was looking towards the pantry behind the curtains at Chandra and Ayja.

�I&#8217;m such a sucker for romantic love.� she said, resting her chin in her hand, gazing at them. �You can tell that they&#8217;re having a crush right? Might even be the real thing.� she asked and looked up at me. I quickly smeared some honey on the bread and took a bite. �I guess. I don&#8217;t really know any of them.� I said. �Are you in love?� she asked, I nearly choked on my bread. �Excuse me?� I asked. She looked back at me, �It&#8217;s a fairly easy question. Yes or no.� she promptly responded.

�Have I ever been in love?� I asked myself out loud and closed my eyes. I thought of Rajan holding me, letting his arms embrace my belly as we watched the setting sun reflect on the glass and steel towers of Babylon, filling the entire city core with a soft orange light.

I felt his hands gently holding mine, his lips kissing my neck. I sighed ruefully. �You don&#8217;t have to spell it out, a simple yes would have worked as well.� Rohena said while she reached for another slice of bread. I smiled meekly and opened my eyes. �How I wish you were here Rajan. I have so much I would say to you.� I turned my head and saw Ayja snuggling up against Chandra&#8217;s shoulder, her hair spilling out from the blanket I laid on them.

Suddenly in my mind, I reminisced our trip to the Academy. I remembered Mahi sitting gracefully with her legs by her side, giggling softly at Chandra&#8217;s jokes. I remembered how I felt, �She was so petite and her feet were so small, like a living doll. A cute, lovable doll.� I froze. �Did I just� Did I just feel for her?�

Panicked, I looked around. �This is stupid, I love Rajan! I&#8217;ve liked him since third grade. I&#8217;ve been with him for over a year. I love him!� I thought as a pang of guilt hit me. �I&#8217;m a slut. I haven&#8217;t been away from him for more than one week and I&#8217;m already hot for someone else.� I almost felt like crying.

��but the way her hair falls down her face does seem kinda odd, considering her style. Don&#8217;t you think?� Rohena said and turned to me. Disoriented, I looked back at her and half stood up. �I uh &#8211; I&#8217;m sorry. I&#8217;m not feeling very hungry.� I got up, but I didn&#8217;t get more than halfway from the chair until her Rohena&#8217;s smiling face relaxed to a more casual calm. �Sit.� she ordered. It was evident in her voice that she wasn&#8217;t taking no for an answer.

Slowly I sat back down. �Obviously you&#8217;re in love, and probably with someone from� where are you from? Never mind. From wherever you came from. And I&#8217;m sorry to rain on your parade girl, but you&#8217;re not going to be able to see or talk to him very often.� she said.

�He&#8217;s�� I started and snivelled slightly. �He&#8217;s a Brahmin now.� she stopped eating. I felt a tear run down my cheek. For the first time, Rohena showed something other than superiority. She laid her hand on mine and said, �I&#8217;m sorry.� I nodded and tried to hold the tears in, ��thanks.� My voice almost breaking, I started crying for real. Tears streamed down my face and sat hulking in my blanket. She held my hand and simply sat with me for a minute.

It felt uncomplicated. It was an incredibly good feeling to have someone to cry with, who didn&#8217;t care what it looked like. �You do know that Night Lilies have served Brahmin before, right?� She said and put her other hand on the one she was already holding, clasping it.

Red eyed, I looked up. �What?� I asked, hoping this wasn&#8217;t her idea of a funny joke. She leaned forward. �In all castes, there is a degree of variation in how much status you have. A templar general is more noble than a templar private for example. In the same way is a servant different in regards of status.� Rohena explained. �Ok�� I said, not really getting her point.

She continued, �Servants and Brahmins vary the most. Compare a high priest for example with a simple mayor of a small town. The difference in status is enormous. The high priest could barely touch anyone of another caste than Brahmin, but many mayors have had known affairs with people of other castes.�

I looked at her. �But I thought Brahmins couldn&#8217;t marry outside their caste?� I asked, wiping my face with the blanket. �Listen to what I&#8217;m saying girl. Brahmins can have affairs. And even known affairs if the difference in status isn&#8217;t all too high.�

I crossed my arms stubbornly, even if it meant consolidating my misery. �I&#8217;m still just a servant slave. I can barely court a stockbroker. A mayor would be untouchable.� I said sourly.

Rohena looked on me incredulously. �You still drunk? How much did you have last night?� she asked, as if I was stupid. �Excuse me.� I said, not really getting her subtle point. She looked at me for a couple of seconds and then lightened up in realisation. �Oh� you&#8217;ve never heard anything about Night Lilies have you? Of course, no one told you. My bad.� She had my attention and I asked, �What, we&#8217;re well respected?�

She leaned forward. �The only members of the Servant class that have more respect would be rock stars and great artist. We have courted kings and queens, emperors and generals and everything in between. If they have the money, or the right contacts. They can get us, otherwise they can only watch and dream.� She smiled at me. There we&#8217;re no words to describe the relief that I felt. I hadn&#8217;t even thought about the possibility. I smiled and looked down on the table and took another nibble of my sandwich. �Thanks.� I said and looked up at her.

�No problem. Just, don&#8217;t get used to this.� she said and waved her finger at the table. �Oh�� I said, slightly dismayed. �Ok, I didn&#8217;t mean to intrude.� I said. She laughed slightly. �No silly, I meant sharing breakfast with me. I can listen to your heartaches and explain how life is going to unfold whenever you want. Actually, I&#8217;m kind of obligated to. At least to do the latter part.� she said.

�Obligated, what does she mean? She only does this because she has to?� I wondered. �Because you will officially be a junior in about an hour. And when you&#8217;re a junior, you don&#8217;t eat breakfast with your seniors. You make it for them.� she said with a content smile and grabbed another slice of bread. Her explanation made me feel somewhat better, at least she didn&#8217;t dislike me, so I smiled back. Even if it felt kind of odd to smile at the person who just told you that you will be making breakfast for her every day for the coming one and a half years.

She looked over at Chandra and Ayja. Chandra had turned her head now and the two girls foreheads were touching each other and they were holding hands. �You know I really wanted those two, by the gods they&#8217;re cute.� she said and nodded towards them between the fridges. �But no, Neeshka&#8217;s unstoppable when she set her mind on something.� she said with a sigh. 

�Neeshka.� I remembered last night, her toying with poor Esa&#8217;s emotions, and then� I could almost feel the air rushing between my legs again, remembering the feeling when I was bound on the pillow with my rear sticking out in the air. And Neeshka standing behind me with that dildo harness, that strap-on.

Rohena must&#8217;ve picked up on what was running through my mind. �I&#8217;m sorry about yesterday, about calling you a whore.� she said. �But Neeshka� you know. Despite her quirks and her obsessive nature, I really like her.� she smiled. �Are they in love? No� or yes. Not hot passionate love, but they seem more like a couple that has been together for quite a while.� I thought.

�But, I don&#8217;t get it. Neeshka wanted me, I mean us� as your junior twins? Is it because Kalia you know� likes the stuff that Neeshka does?� I asked, thinking about Kalia&#8217;s arousal yesterday night over Asura&#8217;s humiliation and my bondage. 

�No. She wanted you. After you had passed out, which by itself is pretty amazing, Neeshka walked straight up to me and said &#8216;I want her, no discussion.&#8217; And that was the end of it.� Rohena said. �But I hit her!� I exclaimed, not understanding why she would want me. �Does she want revenge?� I asked.

�No, she&#8217;s quite content with banging you for that hit you threw at her. She just wants you more than any of the others as her junior.� Rohena said and suddenly stood up. �I&#8217;m going to go wake her. You clean this up.� she said and left without further ado.

I looked down on the crumb-covered table and started to clean up, a little wiser about what the world had in store for me.

Thirty minutes passed. Rohena had awoken Neeshka by stealing her blanket. Slumberous and grumpy, she stumbled away into the room of the two seniors on the opposite end of the corridor, Jhala and Khatu, and walked off with their blanket instead. After a couple of minutes of ruckus, the entire dorm was wide-awake and bustling with activity.

After the sophomores had charged off to the bathroom, and the seniors started to slowly wake up us juniors was looking on from the common room. Covered in blankets and trying to make ourselves as unnoticeable as possible, we were successfully ignored for nearly 20 minutes. But after that Rohena came out from her room, wearing a golden sari and brushing her hair as she approached us.

She stopped in the middle of living room and counted us, pointing at each of us. ��four, five and six. Great. All right juniors, listen up.� she said in a clear voice, getting our attention easily. �Maybe you got drunk and don&#8217;t remember, maybe you&#8217;re not very attentive�� she let her gaze slide over us until she stopped at me. With a smile she continued ��or maybe you just passed out.� A slight giggle came from Ayja until Chandra prodded her shoulder and she stopped.

�But my name is Rohena Chauhan, and I am the leader of this dorm. It is my responsibility that this dorm is kept clean, tidy and functioning. If I see something that I do not like, I will ask you to fix it. If it is not fixed, I will punish you. If you ignore me, I will take you to the school disciplinary board and they will punish you, and trust me girls. you don&#8217;t want that.� she said, applying the brush in her hand to her hair.

�You are juniors. I&#8217;m sure the principle told you what your duties here at the academy are, but I will refresh them for you. As you can see, there are a lot of girls living in each dorm. We&#8217;re 18 in fact, six in each room. Each room consists of one pair of seniors, one pair of sophomores and one pair of juniors.� she said and looked at us.

�In that particular room, the juniors will belong to the seniors. Yes, belong. You will be our de facto slaves. The academy owns you, but the principle has commissioned you to us. The two seniors in your room are your mistresses. You will obey them in all things, except breaking the school&#8217;s rules. So you might ask yourself, which of you are going to serve under which seniors?� she said, and looked seriously at us. Other seniors started coming out of their rooms. Hair done, golden satin sari shining softly, heels clicking under them. 

�Well, we decided that yesterday. While you were having all the fun, we were watching you, deciding who would go where. But before I reveal that� In 20 minutes, the principle will be on the vidscreen. I expect this room to be presentable in 15. Get to it!� she said. I looked around, the place looked like a war zone, empty wine bottles, candles and pillows lying everywhere. 

I finally had a moment to look at my fellow juniors in broad daylight, getting to see what they looked like and from where they hailed. Chandra was an athletic girl with brownish hair and tanned skin. She had powerful long smooth thighs and a kind of cute butt. Her twin Ayja was a thin slender girl who looked much weaker in comparison to Chandra. They where about the same height, but Ayja looked taller due to her gangly physique. Her skin was a lot fairer than Chandra&#8217;s and her most noticeable feature was her calf length, silky, jet-black hair that trailed after her every move.

Esa and Asura looked pretty much alike. They were both pretty dark skinned, not African black like me but a dark brown. They we&#8217;re both pretty short and they were both the same curvy kind of build. Hips showing clearly, perky breasts with big nipples for their size and a concave waist.

I looked at my own figure and wished I had their curves. I was built a little more like Chandra and Ayja put together. Tall, athletic and slender. Esa had her hair in two pig tails sticking out from her neck and Asura had one single ponytail. 

Then I looked at Kalia, my twin. I remembered her swirling tongue in my mouth from the day before, and how she pressed her pussy closer to mine, making me feel her pubes on my own. I shuddered slightly and crossed my arms. She was fair skinned like Ayja, probably both of Indo-Aryan heritage. Ayja&#8217;s skin was brighter though.

Her dark brown hair was cut short at her shoulders. She kept it in a small braid at the back of her head except for a few strands that framed her face. Her breasts were a lot larger than mine and she was slightly shorter than me. She looked hung over.

Some of us slowly started picking stuff up. Kalia stood around doing nothing. Chandra looked miserably hung over as well. Esa and Asura looked around meekly. Ayja and me started to pick up some wine bottles here and there.

Neeshka came out of her room. Even taller than I remember her, now that she was wearing high heeled shoes. She walked over the mess in the common room and crashed down in one of the lazy chairs. She studied us, clearly amused. She started counting in a low but audible voice. ��one, two, three, four lazy girls.� she smiled contently. �What?� Kalia asked her, annoyed at Neeshka&#8217;s obvious call for attention.

�Hm? Oh, don&#8217;t mind me.� Neeshka said. �I&#8217;m just counting the number of lazy juniors I&#8217;m going to see down at the disciplinary board later today.� she took up a paperscreen, loaded up a fashion magazine and started flipping through pictures. Chandra and Asura came up behind Kalia, wondering what she meant.

She looked at them over the paper, shooting of an amused smile again. �You do know that I&#8217;m chairman of the student disciplinary board don&#8217;t you? They say pain builds character but I say it&#8217;s the actual welt marks that do it. Mmh, fresh untouched skin. I can&#8217;t wait.� she said with a malicious grin. The girls face was being turned upside down into a realisation of how much trouble they could be in for. �Or maybe you want a good penal fucking. I hear Africa liked hers. Didn&#8217;t you Africa?� she asked, the last part in a raised voice audible over the entire dorm.

I stopped and turned. Blushing, I expected giggles and long looks. Instead, I saw Chandra climbing under the counter to the kitchen to get cleaning bags, Esa and Asura sat on the floor scraping of melted candle wax from the panels with their nails. Even Kalia had already gathered more wine bottles than she could carry and pacing her way to the kitchen. Ayja and me who were the only ones who had already started gave each other a smile.&nbsp; 

15 minutes later, Rohena came back out. She looked around, exchanged a few words with Neeshka and addressed us. �Juniors, come here.� We walked up to her. �Sit.� she ordered. Remembering the lessons from Abjiri on the train, I first kneeled and then sat my buttocks on my heels, placed my left big toe over my right one, separated my knees with about two fists and laid my hands on my thighs.

Neeshka looked at me, looking a bit surprised. I noticed her and smiled inwardly. The other girls sat down haphazardly. Some with their legs on their side, some with their legs crossed and Esa laid down on her belly and supported her chin on her hands.

All the other seniors had gathered now and a couple of the sophomores, they were all fully dressed. I was getting more used to being naked, but at moments like these I still felt very vulnerable. My belly jolted slightly and I set my eyes on the floor, trying to hold on the manufactured feeling of safety it gave me.

�These are your uniforms.� Rohena said and started handing out some kind of clothes made out of black satin and white lace. I couldn&#8217;t see what they were when they were all together in a big heap. She looked at a nametag on them. �Chandra&#8217;s�� she said and handed small bundle to Chandra. ��and Esa&#8217;s�� she continued until we all had ours.

I looked around on the other&#8217;s uniforms. The seniors were wearing beautiful silk saris, way more lavish than I had ever worn, except for my official sari I wore on the way here. �I wonder where that is now?� I thought. They were in a shiny gold tanned sari that left the middle and side of their belly exposed in an alluring manner. To that, they wore high-heeled shoes, making them several inches taller than usual.

The sophomores wore a pleated blue cotton skirt with that ended just above the knee. A small shirt like top acted as a bra and had small arms going down an inch or two along their arms. The shirt-top itself stopped a couple of inches above the belly button, leaving their mid rift open. They wore white socks and modest two-inch heels to the dress. 

Then I looked down at my uniform. A small black satin dress with white lace arm puffs, hem, apron and stuffing around the not so modest cleavage. �This is a maid&#8217;s uniform?� I thought, slightly bewildered. I slid it over my arms and down my body, it felt smooth against my skin. I arranged the chest piece around my small breasts, there were two supportive pads that were a bit uncomfortable if they weren&#8217;t in place underneath my breasts.

I looked at myself and at Kalia next to me. The tiny black satin maid&#8217;s uniform not only pushed up our breasts but also had a clear cleavage showing of the top of them for all to see. Kalia helped me tie the ribbons around the lace on my arms, making the puffs protrude properly. While I responded with tying her puffs I noted a small red broidery on her left arm. A red rose. �The house of the rose� That&#8217;s us, isn&#8217;t it?� I recalled as I looked at the symbol. Inspecting the sophomores&#8217; and the seniors&#8217; uniforms I could see that the sophomores had the emblem on their shoulder and the senior had it on the drape of their Sari.

Feeling slightly exposed in the short skirt of the dress, I scanned the floor in front of me after the panties and found a bundle of white cloth that lay in front of me. I quickly picked it up and a piece of it fell off, revealing itself to be two separate pieces of clothing. �Two panties? No wait� this isn&#8217;t�� I thought and looked at the garment in my hand.

�Stockings?!� I thought with big eyes. Stockings were something ladies wore at extravagant, classical balls and galas. Wearing it without a western style cocktail dress would be considered kinky at best. My heart skipped a beat as I locked down on the white silk stockings in my hands. I had never worn them before. I always wore pants or a sari.

Bewildered I turned my head and looked on my peers. Ayja was helping Chandra on with hers. She had them carefully curled up into just a foot and the rest of the stocking coiled up around her ankle. Then she carefully slid the garment up over her leg. �Doesn&#8217;t look too hard�� I thought and did the same. I put my foot in them and slid the white silky fabric over my leg.

It was a lot tighter than I had imagined, but felt pretty nice. The upper band on my thigh was almost a bit too tight though. I scratched it a little as smoothed out the wrinkles around it. I did the same with my other leg. I looked around, I saw shoes but still no panties and Rohena apparently had no more pieces of uniform to hand out. I realized what that meant and felt the heat rise to my face as I blushed.

I put on the simple black flat shoes and looked down on my self. Saris were the only dresses I usually wore and they were foot length all of them. Wearing this thin short-skirted dress felt awkward at best and outright dirty at worst. The stockings themselves were nothing but kinky. This was the first time in my life that I had actually seen any, I thought they were obsolete outside the ballroom. And to top it of, I could feel the air caress my pantyless crotch between my thighs. I consciously closed my legs as I sat down on the ground. 

Suddenly, the view screen flickered to life. Startled, the sophomore&#8217;s backed out from the common room and watched from the corridor. Rohena turned to us and said sharply ordered us to sit. We did. �When we bow, so will you.� she told us. I nodded.

Principle Lakshmi appeared on the vidscreen. She smiled at us. �Greetings dorm 2 at the house of the rose.� she said. Rohena took a step forward. �Good day Mistress, we are all honoured by your graceful presence.� she said and bowed. The other seniors bowed, we noticed and bowed as well from the floor.

�I see that you have your juniors awake. And fully clothed�� she nodded appreciatively. �More than a lot of the other&#8217;s I have visited so far.� she noted. Rohena bowed again. �Thank you Mistress, you are too kind.�

�Have you allotted the young girls their new mentors?� she asked. �Mentors? She must mean which of us juniors will go to which seniors.� I thought. �Yes we have Mistress.� Rohena started. �Me and my twin Neeshka will care for the juniors Ayanna Farah and Kalia Jana.� she said, with just a hint of regret in her voice.

Kalia looked on me and then looked up on Neeshka and then back on me again. She looked fearful. �Jhala and Khatu will care for Chandra Saraf and Ayja Rumeran.� Chandra looked up on Jhala, she recognised her name. A card had dictated her to serve her yesterday night, which other than bringing her wine and giving her feet a tongue bath also included licking her pussy. Chandra looked a bit flushed. I noticed Ayja taking Chandra&#8217;s hand and they exchanged a warm look.

�And finally the seniors Celana and Meena will care for Asura Mandyam
Esa Nagi.� Rohena said. �Are you other seniors in agreement of this?� the principle asked. A unison �Aye� came from the line of seniors. �Very well then. Juniors, go sit by your mentors&#8217; feet.� she said from the viewscreen. Everyone got up and crawled or slid over the floor the few yards that they had to cover to get to their respective seniors. 

Kalia raced past me and sat down in front of Rohena, forcing me to sit by Neeshka. With a slight sigh, I slid past her and sat by Neeshka&#8217;s feet. Principle Lakshmi then ordered us �Kiss your mentor&#8217;s feet in appreciation of the guidance that she offers you.� We tentatively turned around and bowed down to the floor beneath our seniors. Neeshka grabbed her sari and it rustled audibly as she inched it up, baring her feet and high-heeled shoes.

I leaned forward and felt her sari brush against my forehead as I placed my lips on the top of her foot, just above her toes and kissed it. I felt a rush course over my skin, shivering me as I lifted my head over to her other foot and kissed it as well. I felt her soft skin under my lips as I slowly placed my mouth over it. I covered a bit more of the toes on this kiss.

Neeshka chuckled softly and switched places with Rohena. I kissed her feet as well and then turned back to the vidscreen. �Very well ladies. Seniors, make sure you get your juniors to the doctor&#8217;s office today. And after that they&#8217;re scheduled with Instructor Ramakan. I have 10 more dorms to cover. Welcome to a new year here at the academy.� she said with a faint smile, and the vidscreen switched off. 

I turned around and watched the others. The sophomores stood around and exchanged comments on the turnout, most of them seemed content and then walked out of the dorm, probably off to class. I looked at the clock on the corner of the vidscreen, it read 08:49.

�You two. Follow.� Neeshka simply said. She walked off into her room, I had never been there before.

We entered the room, which in itself felt spacious and large. Straight ahead on the opposite end of the room stood one queen sized bed in front of the large window on the short side of the room. On the right hand side stood two small single sized beds separated by a small bed table. There was a small table for four in the room as well as two armchairs and several bookcases.

Pots and plants adorned the room, several off them hung from the ceiling. Two closets stood against the wall between the twin bed and the two smaller ones. One of the closets was full length and the other was half-length, no higher than a yard.

Neeshka snapped her fingers and pointed on the carpet in front of the large bed. �Sit slaves.� she ordered. Immediately I sat down, as I remembered from the train. Kalia sat down next to me with her legs on her side, supporting herself on her one hand. Rohena closed and locked the door after us with an audible click. I turned my head and looked at the door as I heard it lock and then slowly turned back. Rohena herself sat down in one of the armchairs and watched.

I finally got a good look on the two. Neeshka was tall and looked pretty athletic. She was a bit sinewy, like me. She was of Persian origin, fair skinned and brown haired. She was tall even without her heels, with them she towered over us. Her breasts were regularly sized but her somewhat wide hips combined with her flat belly made her look curvier than she perhaps was.

Rohena on the other hand was pretty much the opposite. She was the epiphany of curviness. Most notably were perhaps her large round breasts that dominated her figure. Despite her relative young age she was a walking around with breasts surely a C-cup, maybe even a D-cup. Together with her wide hips and narrow waist, it was hard to believe that she was only eighteen. Her face gave her off though.

Other than that, she was darker in her skin than Neeshka and looked fairly Indian in her appearance. She was also shorter then Neeshka, but taller then me. However, it looked like I would outgrow her.

Neeshka looked down on us and started talking,&nbsp; �This is how this works. The principle owns your asses and she has commissioned you two to us. That means that me and Ro&#8217; have every single right to treat you as the principle would have, with the exception that her word carries precedence over ours and she can revoke the commission at any time.� 

�By the Lord she&#8217;s tall. Standing on her bare feet she was as tall as my dad, and he&#8217;s nearly 6&#8217; �. But now she&#8217;s wearing heels on top of that�� I thought as the towering senior dwarfed me. I unconsciously inched back a little.

�These are the standing rules. You will do as we say without question. You will address us as Mistress at all times. You will not speak freely to us without our explicit permission. When we speak to you, you will focus your attention on us and solely on us.� she said. She looked over at Rohena and clenched her jaw slightly, it was barely noticeable. I was probably the only one who saw it from my angle. �Something they&#8217;re not agreeing on fully?� I wondered. 

She turned back and looked down on us, �Unlike many other seniors, we will allow you to look at us. Especially when we are talking to you. When you look at us you will do so with respect. No staring, no harsh glares and no funny looks.� she said and pointed at us.

Neeshka continued, �When we enter a room that you&#8217;re in or when you enter a room that we&#8217;re in you will bow to us. Regarding ordinary daily routines� You will make breakfast for us every morning and dinner every evening. This goes for Indira and Sunitha as well.� she said and nodded towards the two smaller beds. �The room&#8217;s two sophomores.� she explained.

I looked over at their bed briefly. �You will keep the room clean and tidy at all times. You will make our beds, dust, polish and mop. You will also clean our clothes and press them whenever clothes are lacking. This goes for Indira and Sunitha as well as me and Ro&#8217;.� she continued.

�Note that it is entirely up to you to keep track of these things. We are not here to tell you when we need our clothes washed, our bed made or the shelves dusted. And if we at any time actually have to remind you of these things you have failed and it will be our right to punish you.� she said with a slight grin.

�Regarding punishments, we have strict guidelines from the principle on what flies and what doesn&#8217;t.� she said and leaned in over us. �But trust me. I&#8217;m a very inventive woman, limitations only makes the job all that more interesting.� she said, like a predator closing in on her prey. �Punishments will be administered for the breaking of any rule or acting in any other impolite way. Oh, and also we&#8217;re responsible for your performance in school. So if you don&#8217;t do your homework or if your grades are slipping, you will be punished.� she told us.

�Bedtime for you two is ten o&#8217; clock at night, and not a minute later. If I feel like adding something, I&#8217;ll let you now. Is anything unclear?� she asked.

�No, Mistress.� I replied. Kalia however managed to do her first action as Neeshka&#8217;s slave wrong. She said �No Neeshka.� With a faint smile and a daring look. Neeshka looked down on her, sighed and crossed her arms. Kalia crossed her arms back. �It&#8217;s not like the principle would actually let you do anything to us. You&#8217;re just a bully looking to scare us. It&#8217;s not like I haven&#8217;t seen your kind before.� Kalia said.

I looked up on Neeshka, a little bit of me hoping that Kalia was right, but the sudden build up of tension in the air between us was exasperating. A couple of seconds of silence felt like torturous minutes. How would Neeshka react to this? What would she do? I unconsciously inched backwards.

She had locked her eyes at Kalia on the ground. �Africa, go see if Ro needs anything.� she told me. �Yes Mistress.� I replied and sprang up from the floor and quickly padded over to Rohena, glad that I got out before the things got out of hand. I stopped in front of her and yet again remembered what Abjiri taught me. I stood with my feet together and my hands behind me back, eyes fixated on the floor. 

Rohena was holding a paperscreen, the back of it projected the picture of a book cover. She looked at me over the cover, �Sit down Ayanna.� she said, and I sat down at her feet. �Where did you learn that?� she asked, eyes squinting. �Learn what?� I asked. �Eh, Mistress.� I quickly added. She gave me a quick look and then smiled. �First slip is on the house. Second one will cost you.� she said in a joking tone. I wondered exactly how much of a joke it actually was.

I looked over my shoulder at Neeshka and Kalia. She had my twin standing up on her knees with her hands behind her neck. Neeshka had her finger under Kalia&#8217;s chin, lifting her face up while she was lecturing her. �In that case you need your hearing tested slave, the principle told you specifically during her welcome speech. If I recall correctly, the words were &#8216;these are your mentors. Failure to obey them is failure to obey me.&#8217; � Neeshka said.

Kalia shook her head free of Neeshka&#8217;s finger and stood up. �Being a mentor means you&#8217;re here to help us when we need you, not the other way around. You just want to be pampered like the spoiled bitch you are.� Kalia said, in spite. Neeshka snorted and rolled her eyes. �Look who&#8217;s talking. I&#8217;m sure you had nannies running all over the place where you came from but here�� the two continued but was drowned out by Rohena&#8217;s voice from behind me.

�Watching Neeshka when she&#8217;s like that always makes me a bit happy, I&#8217;m so glad I don&#8217;t have to handle these kind of things.� she said with a smile and ran her fingers through my hair. I felt her warm hand softly caress the skin of my head as she arranged my hair in different styles. It was something me and Reshmi always used to do back in Babylon. It did feel a bit weird when Rohena started, she was after all a total stranger to me. But I forced myself to relax and before I knew it, her fingers was soothing to the touch.

 I turned around and sat with my back against her, leaning on the chair with my body between her knees. I felt her other hand touch my hair as well. It felt good. I slid down from the somewhat strenuous sitting position and left my legs and feet on the side of me. �Tell me Ayanna� have you ever kissed a girl before?� Rohena asked. �No Mistress� I mean yes Mistress. I kissed Kalia yesterday. But not before that.� I replied. �Well. What more did you and Kalia do. Did you get to touch her boobs?� she said and I could feel her smile at the back of my neck.

�No Mistress, I had my hands at her back.� I said. �Exactly what is she doing with my hair? It feels a bit like a braid.� I looked at the other two. Kalia still defiant and Neeshka just warming up. Finally Neeshka said something to her that caused Kalia to snap. 

�Repressed anger? Did daddy touch your special place?� Neeshka said mockingly while holding the younger girl&#8217;s chin. Kalia clenched her teeth and said nothing. �Or maybe he was too busy banging your Servant mother.� she said with a joking grin, making a clich�d insult. Kalia pulled her chin away from Neeshka&#8217;s hand and said nothing, just glared back at her.

The elder girl&#8217;s face lit up with realisation. �Oh� she was, wasn&#8217;t she? Only reason to say nothing in your defense..� she said with a wide smirk. �Wasn&#8217;t your dad a scholar? Talk about thinking with his cock.� she said and leaned forward. �But your mom did a great job, fucking her way in to the goldmine, no matter who she had spread her legs to� or what.� Neeshka said, and giggled a little after she added the last part.

Kalia snapped, �Shut up!� Kalia shouted and slapped Neeshka, whom after the initial impact grinned widely.

�Ro&#8217;, now I can do almost anything I want with her, right?� she asked giddily. Rohena nodded, �Yes dear. If she hits you, you can drag her into the dungeon as long as you don&#8217;t violate the principle&#8217;s first rule.� she said while she was doing my braid.

Neeshka took a step forward and simply grabbed the unruly teen and lifted her up. She shrieked curses and screamed obscenities as Neeshka carried her off to the bed and tossed her down on it. Kalia tried to get up but Neeshka sat down on her. Kalia reached up with her hand for Neeshka&#8217;s face, but the eighteen year old simply grabbed her hand and slammed it down on the bed. It was clear who of the two were the strongest. Three years made a lot of difference.

Neeshka pulled a pair of metal handcuffs from the bed and clicked them on Kalia&#8217;s right wrist. She pulled it up from the mattress and pressed it down in the small of her back. She pulled up her other hand and locked it to the other cuff, securing the fifteen year old&#8217;s hands behind her back.

She grabbed Kalia&#8217;s shoulders and turned her around. Kalia called her a cock-sucking midget and finally Neeshka grew tired of the constant screaming insults. She stood up and walked over to the closet, opened a drawer and pulled out some black rubber thing with a bunch of straps attached to it.

I felt intrigued as I watched on. I felt a little bad for Kalia, but she seriously had it coming. This was nothing like Esa yesterday. �Esa was terrified when Neeshka made her move on her. Kalia is just acting like a child. Not mentioning being outright stupid, didn&#8217;t she understand that it would come to this? I mean she saw me getting bound and fucked yesterday.� I thought.

Neeshka held what looked like a black rubber ball about the size of a ping-pong ball in her hand. She quickly sat down by Kalia and pushed her chest down with her one hand and used the other to press the ball inside Kalia&#8217;s mouth. I jerked a little by her sudden movement. I heard Rohena&#8217;s sari ruffle as she bent down to me. �You ok?� she wondered. I turned my head and looked at her briefly. �Y-yeah�� I felt the heat rise to my face and I could felt my heart beat a bit faster.

�Turn around and look at me.� Rohena said. I turned my face, confident that she couldn&#8217;t see any of my blushing. �Big eyes�� she said and laid her fingers on my cheek. �Blushing. You&#8217;re horny.� she said, I turned my head down. �This damned school is making me into a slut.� I thought and bit my lip.

She whispered in my ear. �I&#8217;ll let you in on a little secret. I get horny from watching too.� she pointed up at our twins. �Let&#8217;s watch it together and see what happens.� 

Neeshka walked over to the window and pressed the control on its edge, dimming the windows. It was common in all but the oldest of houses to have dimmable windows. When dimmed, they were totally opaque from the outside and slightly dimmed from the inside.

After that, Neeshka walked over to the wall and unhooked several of the flowerpots that were hanging on the wall and put them down on the table. Kalia&#8217;s expression had changed from defiance to anger and now changed again to fear. With big eyes, she looked on as her unwanted Mistress arranged the room for her, how she arranged it for her punishment. She walked over to Kalia and grabbed her shoulders and pulled her squirming body up to sitting. �Be still!� She ordered her. Kalia shook her head and complained loudly, but unintelligibly, through her gag and continued squirming.

Neeshka&#8217;s hand descended hard against her ass. The thin satin uniform dress didn&#8217;t do much to halt the impact. A hard crack, a short silence and a loud muffled scream of surprise and pain. �Be still, or you won&#8217;t be able to sit down for week.� Neeshka hissed at Kalia. With her hands behind her back, a rubber ball stuffed in her mouth and an aching ass Kalia froze, realizing this was not the time to aggravate the situation further.

�Good girl.� Neeshka smiled complacently and ran her fingers over Kalia&#8217;s face. �Now come here.� she continued and steered the younger girl by a firm grip of her shoulders. She walked her away to the wall where the flowerpots once hung, in their places three large hooks were drilling in to the wall.

She turned Kalia around so that she faced us and backed her up to the wall. With her hands locked behind her, she looked around bewildered, trying to get a hold of her predicament. Neeshka reached around and fastened some kind of lock to the strap on the back of her head that held her gag in her mouth. Then she leaned in on the younger girl and reached down to her hands and locked the chain between her cuffs to a hook behind her.

Neeshka took a couple of steps back. Kalia tried to turn her head down to look behind her back but was immediately stopped by a tug on her head, keeping her locked to the wall and her head upright. She jerked her hands behind her back but they were locked in place as well and only rattled slightly as she moved around.

Kalia started to complain softly behind her gag. Moaning, she tried to communicate her regret to Neeshka. The older girl probably picked up on it, but was too busy rummaging through her closet. She turned over a heap of clothes and pulled up another pair of leather handcuffs as well as a bag that she tossed on the bed. It rattled as it hit the mattress. She picked up the cuffs and knelt down by her junior&#8217;s feet.

Wrapping the padded leather around Kalia&#8217;s ankles Neeshka reached out to behind the closet and pulled out a black steel rod. Around three feet long and one inch thick, she first clipped it on to Kalia&#8217;s left ankle cuff. Again, Kalia tried to look down and see what was happening and again the chain locking her head to the wall tightened and the resulting force simply jerked her neck slightly.

Neeshka took the rod and pressed her left foot outwards and with her hand she pressed Kalia&#8217;s right foot outwards as well. She complained behind her gag and tried to resist. But with an awkward balance and no leverage, resisting proved hard. Neeshka quickly fastened the rod on her right ankle cuff as well, forcing her feet apart and her skirt travelled up her thighs as she stood astride. From down where I sat, it wasn&#8217;t a lot of hemline left until her pussy would start showing.

Neeshka stood up to admire her handiwork. �One final touch�� she said and crouched down again and fastened the bar spreading her feet apart to the hook on the wall behind her. �There� she chimed, obviously content.

�Well look at you sexy.� Neeshka joked, grabbed Kalia&#8217;s chin and shook it slightly. �Just one little detail missing before we start.� she said and walked up to her and undid the strings on her uniforms that held the puffs up at her arms. Then she proceeded to grab hold of the thin satin garment and started sliding the dress down her body.

The black satin and white lace slowly fell down and revealed her shoulders. The top of her breasts became clearly visible. Her nipples rippled under the black fabric as it slid down below them and bared her chest completely. The dress continued falling down until they stopped at her handcuffs.

Neeshka pouted. �I always forget something, damn cuffs�� she said. �Ah well, time to improvise.� Neeshka grabbed the hem of Kalia&#8217;s short dress. With one finger touching the inside of Kalia&#8217;s thigh, Neeshka pulled her dress up to meet the collapsed top that lay in a heap around her waist. She pulled it up and tucked it in behind the rest of the fabric, creating a black and white sash running over her waist.

Kalia&#8217;s fuzzy pubes shone slightly in the light of the room. Her slit was clearly visible from where I sat. Her chest heaved up and down with her heavy breathing. Neeshka lazily ran her hand through the younger girl&#8217;s pubes. �Mmh, still so soft�� she purred. She backed away from the Kalia, now completely exposed and unable to guard herself from the senior&#8217;s hands. Neeshka walked over to the bed and opened the bag that lay there.

�Treat me with respect, and I am capable of great kindness.� Neeshka said. �Treat me with disrespect, and you will see that I am capable of great cruelty.� she said and picked up the contents of the bag. She held a handful of small wooden clothespins. 

Kalia&#8217;s eyes widened and nearly fell out of their sockets. Her heavy breathing was all gone for she had for the moment forgotten how to do even such a basic task. She just stared at the instrument of her punishment as it lay in Neeshka&#8217;s hand. �Let&#8217;s see now�� she began. You failed to address me properly at least� well every single time you opened your mouth. At least ten times.� she said and picked up a handful of clothespins, counted ten and tossed them on the bed. �Then you disregarded my orders.� she said and tossed another clothespin on the bed. ��several times.� she smiled as she tossed a few more clothespins on the bed.

�Then you insulted me. That&#8217;s gotta be worth at least five of them.� Neeshka gloated and tossed another handful of them at the steadily growing pile. �And finally� you hit your own Mistress. Actually, these aren&#8217;t harsh enough for that. For such atrocious behaviour you need something more� unwavering.� she said and reached over to her bed table. She pulled up a pair of metal clamps, connected by a chain. The clamps themselves had small alligator teeth in their openings criss-crossing over the bite surface of the clamp.

She tossed the nipple clamps on the bed as well. Neeshka grabbed a handful of the wooden clamps and walked over to the younger girl. Kalia started to pull forcibly on her bonds. The chain around her cuffed hands rattled as the chain was pulled taught again and again as she tried to jerk her way free from her soon to be tormentor. Neeshka simply giggled as she grabbed both Kalia&#8217;s nipples and twisted them sharply. She stopped squirming and started screaming instead. Muffled screams came from behind her gag.

Back at Rohena&#8217;s feet, my initial response was to get up and help her out. My body jerked slightly at Neeshka&#8217;s cruel pinch but Rohena laid her hands on my shoulders. �You can&#8217;t stop this one Ayanna. Sit.� Rohena told me softly. I realised that she was right. Discontent, I watched the rest of Kalia&#8217;s punishment.

Neeshka let go of Kalia&#8217;s nipples. �Be still, or I&#8217;ll do that again. But harder.� she added with a menacing tone. Kalia whimpered quietly behind her gag as she looked up on the tall senior standing next to her. �Now, let&#8217;s begin.� she said and ran her fingers over Kalia&#8217;s chest, touching the sensitive skin on the underside of her left breast. She caressed it for a second with her fingers until she without warning pinched it with her left hand and used her right to fasten the clothespin to her skin.

A slightly louder whimper came from behind the junior&#8217;s gag. �That wasn&#8217;t so bad, now was it?� Neeshka said and softly caressed Kalia&#8217;s head. She stopped and played a while with the junior&#8217;s hair. Kalia herself had closed her eyes and was apparently focusing hard on the sensation shooting from the skin of her breast. Neeshka reached down and pinched the skin just next to the first clothespin. I could clearly see how Kalia tensed with all her body and hear how sharply she inhaled as Neeshka attached the second clothespin to her flesh. 

Then she quickly grabbed three more and attached them to the skin next to the others. Together they drew an obscene picture of a semi circle of raised flesh and skin under her left nipple. She moaned constantly now under her gag. �You should know that I&#8217;m a fan of symmetry...� Neeshka noted as she picked up five more clothespins and despite Kalia&#8217;s avid complaining redid the procedure with her right breast. The skin pulled and raised all along her lower breast on both sides.

Too everyone&#8217;s surprise, Neeshka leaned in on Kalia and placed her lips around Kalia&#8217;s gagged mouth, gently kissing her lips. Kalia whimpered in pain mixed confusion as the senior tenderly kissed her lips. Neeshka&#8217;s hand slid down alongside the younger girls belly and her fingers parted and slid through her pubic hair down to her pussy.

Kalia&#8217;s outer labia were pretty big, so it was a bit hard to tell whether she was getting off on her harsh treatment or not. Kalia closed her eyes as Neeshka slid her fingers inside her folds. The senior leaned in and closed her lips around Kalia&#8217;s neck, kissing it. Kalia creased her brow in surprise as she felt Neeshka&#8217;s finger softly prod about in her pussy and her warm lips embracing the skin of her neck.

She moaned slightly from beneath her gag. �Mmh, you have big cunt lips.� Neeshka said into her ear. �Me like.� Kalia moaned again from her gag, now in a slightly more worried tone. The senior took her lips from Kalia&#8217;s neck to her face and softly placed a kiss on her opened mouth, licking Kalia&#8217;s lips playfully.

Neeshka reached back and grabbed another handful of clothespins as she crouched down besides the bound fifteen year old. Kalia realised what was about to happen and violently started complaining and shaking her head as well as her body. �You big baby, sto�� Neeshka began and tried to hold her still with her one hand but failed. �Fucking� hold still I said!� she snapped and shoved Kalia&#8217;s hips against the wall with both hands. She winced from behind her gag and calmed down for the moment.

�Now this won&#8217;t hurt� much� Neeshka said malevolently, as she put a clothespin on Kalia&#8217;s big left outer lip. She tensed as Neeshka closed in and yelped behind her gag as she felt the wooden pin close around her tender flesh. As it pinched around her labia, Kalia started shaking. Out of fear? Out of excitement? Or just out shock? Not even Kalia knew exactly.

Neeshka let it go and looked up on her junior, revelling in her trembling, shaking young junior standing in forced attention above her. She smiled and licked her lips as she set another pin on Kalia&#8217;s other labia. As it pinched down around her folds, Kalia tensed yet again. Neeshka ran her playful finger over Kalia&#8217;s pussy, fondling her warm flesh. The poor helpless girl could only moan as she saw her Mistress move in the corner of her eye, unable to turn her head down and see what she was actually doing, she could only feel it.

Neeshka enjoyed her privacy from her junior&#8217;s prying eyes down between Kalia&#8217;s legs as she took two more clothespins and set both on both outer lips, totalling two on each. One last pair after that adorned her large major labia, making it to a total of three wooden pins clamping down hard on the fifteen year old&#8217;s flesh.

She casually let her fingers slide between the pins, pulling and dragging on Kalia&#8217;s pussy lips as the fingers passed by. The junior&#8217;s breathing became heavier and she complained vividly on her cruel treatment behind her gag.

The more she complained, the more Neeshka seemed to enjoy herself. �Let&#8217;s see now. What we need is a more open, hands-free approach.� she said and gingerly reached for the bookcase and pulled out a roll of scotch tape. Kalia grew silent as she watched in the corners of her eyes as her senior picked up the tape and crouched down between her legs again.

Neeshka took the three clothespins on Kalia&#8217;s left labia and gently pressed them up against the inside of her thigh, pressing the fold aside and opening her pussy. She held the pins against her thigh with one hand and used her other hand and her mouth to pull out the tape roll. She took the tape and taped the clothespins to Kalia&#8217;s thigh, going around her leg at least three times before cutting the roll.

Kalia realised what she was going to do and now stopped complaining and accepted her painful humiliation as her face started taking more and more vivid tones of crimson. With her junior&#8217;s embarrassment apparent, Neeshka happily gave Kalia&#8217;s other lip the same treatment and taped its pins to her other thigh leaving her pussy split open, exposed for all to see. Kalia closed her eyes in shame now and would probably hang her head in defeat if only she was allowed to.

Neeshka let her fingers caress the inside of Kalia&#8217;s now exposed folds, gently fondling the other side of the her outer lips as well as her now visible inner lips. Neeshka slid her finger inside Kalia who whimpered from above. �You&#8217;re a little bit wet at least. But not as wet as Africa�� Neeshka purred.

Back on the floor by the chair, Rohena and I were watching intently. Sitting on the floor with my back resting on the chair between Rohena&#8217;s sari clad legs I smelled a clear musky scent coming from behind me. Rohena was looking on the scene in front of her starry eyed as she was she still lazily brushing my hair. Her scent was walking the border of being slightly repulsive and being incredibly sexy. The effect was mouth watering and her scent reflected on me. Minutes later I could feel myself getting wet under my skimpy satin uniform. Consciously I drew my legs together to hide it.

I felt my nipples stiffen against the thin fabric. I looked down on my chest and saw the clear imprint they left on the black satin. Blushing slightly over my aroused state I continued to watch the scene in front of me. And suddenly Neeshka called out. �Africa. Come here.� I felt my heart skip a beat. �Is she going to tie me up to?� I thought nervously.

It took me a few moments to gather myself and I stumbled up on my feet and scurried over to my Persian Mistress. I stood attention with my feet together and my hands behind my back. �Sit.� she ordered, and I did. Neeshka now had two fingers inside Kalia who were moaning from behind her gag. Unclear whether it was pain from the numerous clothespins she had pinched on her flesh, or from discomfort of her forced posture or from the unwilling excitement Neeshka was forcing on her by fondling her sex.

She withdrew her glistening fingers from Kalia&#8217;s pussy and presented them in front of me. �Taste these.� she simply said. �What?� I was just as shocked as I was surprised. She wanting me to lick her fingers was absurd enough, but to lick someone&#8217;s pussy juice from them was a thought that never crossed my mind until now. �Can you actually do it like that?!� I thought.

My thoughts got disrupted by a light slap across the cheek. �Aah!� I yelped and clasped my face. It didn&#8217;t really hurt, but she got her point through. �Do not hesitate when I give you an order slave.� she clarified. �I&#8217;m sorry Mistress.� I said and turned my eyes down. Silently she presented her still wet fingers to me again. I bent forward and closed my mouth around them.

I had never really tasted pussy before, not even my own. I touched a small patch of dried up juice yesterday, but even I understood that it was nothing like the real thing. The thought struck me, as I tasted Kalia&#8217;s juices. Salty, bitter and sharp. A clear tangy taste filled my mouth. �Weird, I really didn&#8217;t expect it to taste like that�� I thought as I licked Neeshka&#8217;s fingers. �Do you like it?� she asked and pulled her fingers out of my mouth and dried them on my shoulder. I looked a bit at the saliva on my dress, but didn&#8217;t allow myself to get worked up about it. I turned up to her and answered her question instead.

�I&#8217;m� not sure. It doesn&#8217;t taste that good Mistress.� I said, and realised that probably wasn&#8217;t the answer she was looking for. �But it doesn&#8217;t taste bad either.� I added quickly with a desperate smile, hoping to repair the damage. She looked at me. Well, you&#8217;ll learn to love it Africa. Rohena has quite the appetite for young tongues.� she said with a sly smile.

She turned and looked at Kalia, �But I&#8217;m not finished with you yet. Now it&#8217;s time for the grand finale.� she said and reached over to the bed and picked up the metal clamps. Kalia previously distant gaze snapped to focus within a second. She stared at the metallic clamps and started to object and tried to free herself. With her hands behind her back, her mouth gagged, her body pinned to the wall, her legs spread, her titties obscenely pinned and her legs and pussy forced wide open, she truly looked ravaged.

Neeshka closed up on her. �You know� the more you squirm, the hornier I get.� she said and added an exaggerated moan of excitement. She let her sari brush Kalia&#8217;s skin as she stood toe to toe with the defenceless girl, looking down on her perky breasts. She held the two metal clamps in her hands and the chain that connected them rattled softly. She pried one of them open and showed the jagged insides. �This, is for hitting me. Never forget it.� she said and put the clamps on her nipples and let them go, leaving the springs to squeeze her tender flesh with their full force.

Kalia screamed into her gag, I looked up in horror. I could clearly see how the little teeth of the clamps deformed and pressed down on her nipples, twisting and squashing them between their unwavering metallic jaws. I heard her screams again and I felt a jolt in my belly. This was dreadful. And somewhere deep inside my mind, I found it a little bit exciting. But it would take a long time until I accepted that in myself.

�I think I&#8217;m done with her. Ro&#8217;, I&#8217;ll leave you in charge. Be back in a minute.� Neeshka said and left the room, her sari trailing softly behind her in the air. The second Neeshka left the room I raised my voice and looked at Rohena. �Mistress, you can&#8217;t let her do this! Can&#8217;t you see she&#8217;s in pain?!� I almost yelled.

Rohena closed her eyes and shook her head. �Do not question us Ayanna, I don&#8217;t want anymore of that than what&#8217;s necessary.� she said and pointed at Kalia who had now stopped yelling but was breathing heavily and rapidly through her nose instead. My heart sank as I felt nothing but pity for her. �I&#8217;ll give you a way to help her. But you&#8217;ll have to work for it.� Rohena said all of a sudden.

I looked up at her. �Sure.� I said. She had already picked up a pair of leather handcuffs. �Hands.� she ordered. I held them up to her and she wrapped the cuffs around my wrists, tightened them and padlocked them to me. She laid the key in one of the folds of her sari. She laid her hand on my shoulder, �Follow me� she instructed. She walked me up to Kalia, I was still scurrying along the floor on my hands and feet. �Sit here.� she said and placed me just in front of Kalia who stood wide astride with her eyes closed, clearly focusing on the shooting pain in her chest, oblivious to the world outside her.

Rohena reached down and fastened a chain in the middle of Kalia&#8217;s spreader bar and locked that chain to my cuffs, it wasn&#8217;t longer than a feet. Not really knowing what to expect I looked up on Rohena, she smiled softly. Then I turned my eyes and looked up on Kalia. From this perspective all you could see was a wrenched open pussy, a couple of distended and aching tits and somewhere above all that some tangled hair and a face that hid behind all the pins shooting out from her chest. I felt my pussy tingle a little.

�Now Ayanna, listen carefully. If you can make Kalia come within fifteen minutes. I&#8217;ll let you both go.� I stared at her. �And otherwise Mistress?� I asked meekly. �Otherwise, you&#8217;ll trade places.� she said and patted me on the shoulder. �Bon appetite.� she grinned, jumped on to the bed and continued to read her magazine. I swallowed hard, turned my eyes up to Kalia&#8217;s pussy and felt another jolt in my belly.

I tentatively stretched out my neck and closed in on her exposed pussy. I smelled her soft scent as I inched closer to her opened sex. I extended my tongue slowly from my mouth and closed my eyes, as I got even closer. I heard Rohena paperscreen ruffle and could feel her eyes in my neck. I felt my own heart beat vividly. I had not imagined it would be like this. Ever since Kalki ordered me to make up a fantasy about another woman all those weeks ago, I had imagined what it would feel like, what it would taste like, to make love to another woman.

�I&#8217;d rather sneak in under Rohena&#8217;s sari to be honest�� I thought. Suddenly, I felt the tip of my tongue make contact with something soft and warm. Still keeping my eyes closed, I prodded it slowly, softly. �Almost feels like kissing someone�� I thought and pushed my tongue out of my mouth further and spread it out on Kalia&#8217;s soft flesh. Soft moaning ensued from above, I smiled a little inwards.

My mouth filled up with the same tangy taste like when I licked Neeshka&#8217;s fingers. I drew my tongue over her sex, feeling the heat coming from it. I decided to open my eyes. In front of me lay her inner lips, tidily touching each other and protecting her tunnel. Above it they join in her clit hood. �I didn&#8217;t realise that pussies were so big!� was my first thought. I pushed my tongue out and put the tip at the lower end of her pussy and licked upwards, determined to feel how long it was.

As my tongue slid across and her taste invaded my senses yet again, I felt my nipples harden and my mouth water. I tried to reach up with my hands to caress my breasts through my uniform, but the chain rattled and I was reminded that my hands we&#8217;re looked to Kalia&#8217;s spreader bar.

I heard high-heeled footsteps and recognised Neeshka&#8217;s aggressive gait. �Oh, so let her� how&#8217;s she doing?� Neeshka asked her twin. �She&#8217;s� I haven&#8217;t even started giving her directions. I thought I would have to instruct her step by step. Looks like she&#8217;s doing fine on her own� Rohena said, her voice giving away her disbelief. �I told you we would be happy with her.� Neeshka said complacently and I heard her skip down in bed. �Our own cunt-licking, bitch slapping, vaginal orgasmic, submissive little African.� Neeshka said with a chuckle. Rohena slapped Neeshka&#8217;s arm. �You don&#8217;t have to make it sound so racist.� Rohena noted, a little embarrassed over her twin&#8217;s behaviour.

�I&#8217;m the Persian here. I get to be racist all I want.� she said jokingly, but probably meant it in some twisted way. She belonged to an ethnical minority just as much as I did. Maybe Rohena wasn&#8217;t all that happy with Neeshka&#8217;s answer, but she didn&#8217;t contest it. �It kinda makes sense I guess� I wonder if she was teased for her heritage when she was little?� I wondered. But I didn&#8217;t think much more about it, I was way too busy.

Back between Kalia&#8217;s legs I had stuck my tongue inside her inner lips, grabbing them with my mouth and gently sucking and nibbling on them. Kalia&#8217;s soft moans weren&#8217;t so soft anymore. And she was getting wetter. Not only from my tongue but also by herself. And as she got hornier, her taste got even more pronounced in my mouth. It was driving me crazy, I could feel myself moistening up. I repeatedly tried to reach up with my hands and touch my own pussy, but the chain was too short. The only way to touch my pussy was to lower myself down and then I couldn&#8217;t lick Kalia&#8217;s pussy anymore.

I finally found my way up to Kalia&#8217;s engorged clit. It was fascinating to see how much it had grown since I started. It must&#8217;ve nearly doubled in size, if not more. �I wonder if mine grows like that?� I thought as I let my lips embrace it, gently sucking on it, clit, hood and all. Kalia grunted above me. I prodded her hood with my tongue.

On the bed behind us, Neeshka&#8217;s hand had found its way into Rohena&#8217;s sari, fondling her large breast as they lay down next to each other, embracing in a passionate kiss. Neeshka started undoing Rohena&#8217;s sari and left her bountiful breasts exposed as she kissed and playfully nibbled at them. I quickly turned my head back and glanced at them, Neeshka was sliding her fingers down the tucked in waist of Rohena&#8217;s sari, and was undoing the fold that held the skirt part of her dress upright.

Kalia exclaimed a noise of frustration and questioning from her gag above me. I turned back and looked up at her briefly. �Sorry�� I whispered and turned my tongue back to Kalia&#8217;s rosy flesh. I rolled it inside her inner labia, playing with her folds between my lips. I let my lips make smacking noises on purpose as I continuously kissed her private parts. My tongue play over the insides of her big outer lips, obviously an area that I had paid too little heed, as she started moaning louder and breathing shallower.

I could feel my own juices seeping out of me, trickling gathering between my pussy lips and trickling down my thighs. My nipples were painfully erect under my thin black satin uniform and craved attention. As I continued to tongue Kalia, I could hear her getting more and more excited. Just as I was about to lick myself up to her clit and get her over the edge, I heard a loud grunt from behind me.

I immediately turned my head again and looked back on our seniors. Rohena undressed on her sari with her legs spread wide. Over her lay Neeshka, with parts of her sari still on her. The strap-on was clearly visible as the black leather straps encircled her waist and buttocks. The large pearly white dildo slid into Rohena&#8217;s wet twat and its thickness distended her hole visibly. She grunted and clasped her hands around Neeshka&#8217;s shoulders and crossed her legs over hips. It almost looked like she was trying to drag Neeshka down on her.

I got even hornier as I watched the two and managed to get myself back to my twin. I looked up on her and she was apparently watching our seniors make love as well. �Good, this should make this a little bit easier.� I thought as I approached her for the last time. I lay the tip of my tongue just below her clit. And gently nudged it upwards, stroking the underside of her clit ever so slightly, slowly and softly. I let my tongue wander around it, putting the tip of it on her left side, then on her right side, then above it. And finally I opened my mouth and placed my big lips widely over her clit and let my tongue play with in embraced in the dark cavity that was my mouth. She immediately started to pant and grunt above me. I lay down the entirety of my tongue on her clit and pressed softly. I let it twirl around her and when I finally started writing my name on it with the tip of my tongue, something I read online. Her legs started twitching.

�Honey, look.� I heard Rohena&#8217;s voice behind me and their lovemaking stopped. Kalia slammed her eyes shut and started pulling on her chains audibly. She squealed behind her gag in a high-pitched voice and tried to push her thighs together. Her abs tensed as she came. I continued writing my name on her clit. I was at the first &#8216;a&#8217; of my surname Farah about now. But then I couldn&#8217;t take it anymore. I had to have it too. I slumped down to crouching and placed my two feet on the ground, spreading my legs. I rested my head on the inside of Kalia&#8217;s warm thigh.

My short skirt shimmied all the way up my thighs exposing my wet glistening sex, but I didn&#8217;t care. I was too horny. I crouched down over Kalia&#8217;s spreader bar and managed to get my hands to my own pussy. I touched myself and felt almost immediate blissful release. I brushed my clit with one of my fingers and I felt an electric spark shoot up my spine. The urge to curl my back was almost overwhelming, but with my tied hands it would make me fall over so I fought against it. Dipping two fingers inside me and massaging my own clit, I came instantly.

My thighs started twitching. I yelped high as I felt the orgasm rip through my body. I lost my balance and fell down. Somehow I managed to drag my body back so my hands could touch my crotch. I lay down with legs spread on the floor with my skirt pulled up to my waist, fingering myself while I came. While my twin still moaned and twitched from her orgasm above me. Our seniors had stopped their lovemaking and were watching us intently.

After the orgasm had subsided I laid there panting and turned my head back, looking at my seniors upside down. Rohena&#8217;s heart shaped face was smiling down upon me, looking on me with adoration. Neeshka looked at us too. She seemed pleased, but her smile always had that predatory quality that made her look like she was about to pounce any second.

After shamelessly fingering myself to an orgasm in front of my roommates, my seniors sniggered at me for a while and then continued making love. Tall and lean Neeshka drove her strap-on into her rounder and curvier twin, Rohena. Rohena came first, they kissed and cuddled for a while before Neeshka straddled her twin&#8217;s chest and made Rohena lick her pussy until she came, all while we were uncomfortably bound beside their bed.

I didn&#8217;t want to disturb them, for even though I secretly somewhat enjoyed watching what they did to Kalia, I wouldn&#8217;t want to be in that position myself. Finally, Rohena got up from the bed and dangled the keys to my handcuffs. �Neeshka&#8217;s hungry. Get dressed, take her order and make it for her. We will eat here in the room, you will not eat until both of us have finished breakfast. Understood?� She said. There was only one answer. �Yes, Mistress.� I said and nodded. She dropped the keys in my hands.

I undid my handcuffs and immediately reach up to Kalia&#8217;s crotch and undid the six clothespins that flayed her pussy open. Quickly I stood up and removed the others that where on her breasts and carefully removed her alligator clamps on her nipples. She started moaning and squealing behind her gag. I didn&#8217;t understand her reaction and thought, �Huh? She liked them on?�

Neeshka walked up to me and purposefully let her strap-on graze my hip. I jerked slightly and looked down at it worryingly. Crossing my arms around my chest I looked at her. She smiled her typical smile, like she was about the jump me. I felt a slight shiver down my back. �You know, when you clamp naked flesh, blood flow slow down and you start to lose sensation. After a while all you feel is a soft, deep throbbing.� she said and took a small step towards me. �The pain is almost gone. But when you remove that clamp, blood flows back in to the mangled flesh, and the nerves start sending impulses to the brain at full speed again.� Kalia whimpered behind her gag and pulled at her handcuffs.

�Oh�� I said and looked at Kalia&#8217;s naked body, seeing the obvious marks the clothespins and clamps had left on her skin. Neeshka&#8217;s hand grabbed my chin and forced my face up to hers. �Oh, what?� she said sourly and squinted her eyes, glaring at me. First I didn&#8217;t realise what she meant. �I� uh.� Then after a couple of seconds I understood what she meant. �Oh� Mistress. I&#8217;m sorry Mistress.� I said, titling her correctly this time. �Good girl, but too late.� she said as she grabbed my nipple and harshly twisted it and pressed it downwards.

The pain shot out of my chest and I was forced down on my knee from her harsh pull. �Don&#8217;t be wrong next time slave. Free your twin now and make me thin pancakes and tea, Darjeeling blend. Then you two have an appointment with the doctor.� she said. �And clean this together with your twin&#8217;s gag after you&#8217;re done with breakfast. Hot water and soap.� she said as she undid her used strap-on and dropped it in my lap. �Don&#8217;t wet the leather.�

�Fucking bitch�� I thought, cradling my hurt nipple. I bit my lip and forced myself to not scream and curse at her. Sourly, I responded �Yes, Mistress.�

I undid Kalia&#8217;s bonds and she self-consciously pulled up her dress from her waist and straightened out her skirt so it fell down to her knee again. She looked at me and down again, blushing slightly, clearly in pain. She clasped her breasts and kept her eyes on the floor.

�Come on, let&#8217;s get going.� she said in a murmur and walked out of the room like nothing had happened. �Kalki sure managed to gather a really weird bunch of people here�� I thought as I laid the gag and the strap-on on a small towel at the table. �Am I like that? Weird like Neeshka� or Kalia?� I wondered as I walked out of the room and entered the common room on my way to the kitchen. �Or maybe I&#8217;m like Rohena? No� no. She has a way of doubtless certainty around her. I&#8217;m not anything like her� I wish I could be though. Rohena and Chandra, they&#8217;re pretty much the same. Me, I&#8217;m more like� more like�� I mused but couldn&#8217;t find the answer to my last question. Who was I like? Or were I in fact not like anyone else?

We entered the kitchen and started making the pancakes. We did look quite quaint both of us, standing around in our frilly black satin maids uniform with our white stockings to match. I did however quickly get self-conscious about the fact that I wasn&#8217;t wearing any underwear. I started standing with my legs together. Pretty silly, considering the skirt went all the way down to the knee. But still, I felt terribly exposed as I felt the air brush over my naked sex.

��and six eggs. Got all that?� Kalia asked, snapping me out of my daydreams. �Mh, what?� I asked. �Sorry, I wasn&#8217;t paying attention.� I added sheepishly. She sighed. �You find a pan. I&#8217;ll get the ingredients� she said as she disappeared behind the drapes to the storage room.

�That&#8217;s it. I&#8217;m not like Kalia or Neeshka or Rohena or Chandra. I&#8217;m like Mahi.� I thought and remembered the petite, quiet girl from the bus drive from the station to the school. Her slightly curved eyes, hinting of some eastern blood in her veins. I felt my heart beat faster as I thought about her. I managed to find a good pan and put it on the stove and heated it up before Kalia came back with all the ingredients. �But then again. I tend to get angry and have quite a temper. I can&#8217;t really see Mahi lashing out like I did against Neeshka��

We made the pancakes and the tea for Neeshka. We carried it into their room and found our two seniors sitting by the small table in the room, reading the news on a paperscreen each. Entering the room, I stopped and bowed to them, remembering their rules. Kalia had already forgotten our orders, so I prodded her in the side. She jostled the tray with the teacup and winced. Neeshka looked up from her paper at us. Kalia caught my drift and bowed as well, which proved to be a bit tricky with the tray she was carrying.

We walked up to them and sat down the tray. I stood with my legs together, my hands behind my back and head bent slightly down. �Your breakfast Mistress.� I said softly, hoping the tone of my voice would please her. She looked at the pancakes and then at us. �Very well�� she said. �Set the table.� she said and put her paperscreen away.

I wasn&#8217;t really expecting that, but didn&#8217;t hesitate either. I started picking up the plate and the cutlery and set it neatly in front of her. Kalia put down the teacup on the table and poured the tea. I took the tray when it was emptied and held it behind my back, assuming the preordained pose.

�When we eat, you will sit on the floor by our sides in case we need anything.� Neeshka said. �Yes Mistress.� We both answered. I quickly sat down by Rohena, not wanting to be anywhere near Neeshka. Kalia looked rather disgruntled as she sat down by the Neeshka&#8217;s side.

Neeshka grabbed her fork and knife and inhaled deeply. �Smells good.� she said with a hint of surprise in her voice. �Who knew you two would be so good chefs?� she said and smiled. �But you forgot one thing slaves. No syrup.� she noted. I looked up and felt a swelling panic grow inside me. �Crap, are we going to get it for this?� I thought. �I-I&#8217;m sorry Mistress, we can get it right away.� I said and tried to make myself as small as possible on the floor. She looked down on me.

�If I would&#8217;ve asked you for the syrup before hand, you would be punished now. And the next time you make me pancakes, you can assume that I want syrup, and if you forget it then, you will be punished. But for now� go fetch.� she said waved her finger at me. Rohena smiled at her twin. I hurried up to my feet and disappeared to the kitchen, with Kalia on my tail.

We walked out to the storage room again, behind the beaded drapes and started looking for syrup. �Phew, I really thought we we&#8217;re going to get scolded there.� Kalia said. �She wouldn&#8217;t do that, not for something like this anyway�� I replied as I was looking through the shelves for syrup. I stopped in mid motion and thought about the punishment Kalia got just less than an hour ago. �Did they hurt?� I asked quietly. She stopped and turned to look at me, her expression a bit sour. �Did you like it?� she retorted. �No. I don&#8217;t get off on people in pain. I&#8217;m not like Neeshka.� I said quietly. �You sure? You seemed kinda starry eyed and moist to me.� Kalia asked.

I blushed. I had to admit to myself. I did get off on it. But I&#8217;m not sure I would have if I was the one doing the punishing, I thought I just liked to watch. �I� I just like to watch...� I said. �Well, you did more than just watch after you went down on me.� she said. I froze again.

She walked up behind me and leaned her body slightly against mine, I could feel her dress ruffle on my own. �You know, since you seemed to enjoy it so much. I can let you lick it again tonight. If you&#8217;d like.� she said softly, slowly brushing her breasts against my shoulders.

I felt myself blushing. The thought of licking Kalia pussy voluntarily seemed distant and weird. But at the same time, the thought also made me clench my legs together in anticipation.

Like a gift from the gods, a bottle of syrup caught my eye straight ahead. I grabbed it and turned around holding the bottle between her and me. �Here, syrup. We should go back.� I said. Kalia scowled openly and said �Bah, you&#8217;re no fun at all are you?� and grabbed the syrup bottle and disappeared through the beaded drapes. 

An half an hour or so later�

We sat at our seniors&#8217; feet while they ate and read the newspaper. Now and then, Neeshka would send one of us away to fetch something from the kitchen or Rohena would order us take something back to the kitchen. After they were done we washed up the dishes and then on Rohena&#8217;s orders helped her get dressed. When I saw me and Kalia in our maid like uniforms put on Rohena&#8217;s beautiful golden Sari, I got the umpteenth feeling of total weirdness this morning. I guess I realized what our lives here would be like as juniors. She was our queen, literally as well as metaphorically. 

Her golden silky sari ruffled softly as I tucked the last pleats behind her waist hem and Kalia draped the fabric over her naked chest. We sat down on the floor and helped her on with her shoes. She stepped into her heels and in a manner of minutes she had gone from a naked eighteen year old to a graceful lady. I sat on the floor and looked up at her, towering above me. I remember feeling jealous as well as happy for her. I understood that she once shared my position, kneeling on the floor and that I would sometime in the future be in her position. Three years suddenly seemed like an awfully long time.

Rohena walked us out of our dorm unto the school&#8217;s courtyard. Lush serene trees stood around in small green areas between a myriad of old houses, still smelling of fresh rain. I looked back on the building we left. The house of the rose, that was our dorm. It was signalled with a plaque portraying a beautiful red rose. We walked past another dorm. Its plaque had a symbol a bit more disturbing. It was a open palm with an eye in the middle of it. �The house of the hand and the eye.� Rohena commented. �Which are the other houses?� I wondered. She looked at me disapprovingly. �Mistress.� I quickly added, feeling a flash of guilt come over me.

�You&#8217;re not allowed to relax your courtesy to me just because Neeshka isn&#8217;t here you know. Punishing you two may not be my idea of fun, but I will see to it that someone does it if you misbehave.� Rohena noted. �Clear?� She asked. �Yes Mistress.� Both me and Kalia said in unison, my head lowered. �Good.� she said and continued the conversation as if nothing had happened. �The other two houses are the house of the Moon and the notorious House of Chains.� she said.

�What makes them so notorious Mistress?� I curiously asked. �Well, their parties for starters.� she said and smiled. �Of all the houses, they have the largest collection of sex toys. They have even set up a makeshift playroom in their attic.� she said and pointed out the house on the other side of a small park. I remember thinking that it looked friendly enough.

�Also, it is said that they make their juniors sleep in cages suspended from the roof.� she noted with a wry smile. Kalia, who had been unusually quiet during our walk looked up at her in disbelief. Before she could begin ranting in how bizarre that would be Rohena cut her off. �It is said that the cages are dismantled and put away in storage when they invite people over. They&#8217;ll all deny it if you ask them. But they will deny it with a smile on their face.� Rohena said and shrugged.

We walked up to a medium sized building on the very end of the campus. The sign noted, that among a number of other administrators, the infirmary was located in this building. Another senior with a pair of juniors could be seen entering the building in front of us. Kalia couldn&#8217;t restrain herself, �But� Mistress. Is it true? That they sleep in cages?� she said. I would&#8217;ve thought that she would&#8217;ve been upset by this notion but she seemed almost gleeful. I looked up at her and her eyes were almost sparkling with ill hidden curiosity as she continued to pound Rohena with questions about the alleged sleeping cages.

�Regarding sleeping?... I guess we&#8217;re not going to be sleeping in the common room every night? Rohena and Neeshka share the queen sized bed. The two other beds in our room were for our sophomores, whoever they are. But that was it, where are we supposed to sleep?� I wondered.

We entered the building and I managed to squeeze my question in between Kalia&#8217;s fervent inquiries and Rohena insisting on that the cages just were after all rumors. �Mistress? Where are we supposed to sleep. I only saw beds for four people.� she looked over at me, almost grateful that she didn&#8217;t have to bother with Kalia for a while. �You sleep on mattresses on the floor.� she simply said. �Oh.� I whispered to myself.

We entered the clinic. It was bigger than I thought, with a male scholar in his twenties sitting behind receptionist&#8217;s desk and at least two longish corridors trailing off into the building. �Hey Rohena. Your shift doesn&#8217;t start till� oh, that&#8217;s your juniors?� he asked. �Yeah. They&#8217;re here for their registration. You can handle them from here, right?� She said to him with a smile and almost a flirtatious pose. He smiled back, enjoying her playfulness. �Sure.� I noted the looks they exchanged and his body language, leaning in towards her. �I wonder if they&#8217;ve been intimate�� I thought.

�Juniors, follow me.� He ordered and took us two into one of the rooms. It was pretty large and had about ten beds. �Doctor Jitesh will be with you shortly. You&#8217;re the first ones so far.� He said and left, leaving me alone with Kalia.

I looked over at her. Kalia&#8217;s long straight hair hung over shoulders and reflected the morning sun that shone in from the large windows as she unenthusiastically ran her finger across the chrome frame of one of the beds, apparently she was bored already. The maid uniform they made us wear looked really cute on her. The black pleated skirt hung just below her knees, contrasting her white stockings she wore on her legs. A white band clung to her waist holding her apron up and her growing breasts was enshrined in the push up bust on her dress, showing the skin of the top side of them.

I realised I wore the same dress and that my breasts was also partly showing and without thinking I reached up with my fingers and touched my chest softly. She noticed me noticing her and smiled shrewdly. �Finally come to realise what you want?� she said, breaking the silence. I snapped back from the kaleidoscope of my mind. �Eh.. what?� I asked, somewhat confused. �I saw how you look at me. Look, we&#8217;re twins. We&#8217;re supposed to do &#8216;it&#8217;. Right? We already have, you don&#8217;t have to feel all weird about it.� she said.

My mind caught up with reality. She thought I was coveting her and brought up the subject of sex yet again. �Can&#8217;t she get it into her mind that no means no?� I thought. �Kalia, look. You&#8217;re a nice girl, but what happened� We were forced to do it you know, I really don&#8217;t feel like it otherwise, ok?� I said to her, lying through my teeth. I had been thinking about sex non-stop. But I wanted to maintain at least some level of decency. And I wasn&#8217;t really sure what I thought of her yet.

�Oh come on, you know you want this girl.� she said with a giggle and grabbed her skirt and slowly started to pull it up. My eyes flashed open. �Are you crazy?� I hissed at her. �You&#8217;re not wearing any underwear and� for the gods&#8217; sake, we&#8217;re in the infirmary.� I told her in a loud whisper. She stood astride and continued to slowly raise her skirt, chewing softly on her own lip. The hem passed the end of the stockings, showing her pale north Indian skin. I realised it was just inches from her pantyless pussy now. �Kalia, anyone can walk in here anytime!� I pleaded with her, feeling pretty ashamed about the entire situation.

Suddenly, the door handle rattled and the door opened up. Kalia dropped her skirt and pulled her legs together, looking surprised. I exhaled. �Did she enjoy the fact that she managed to shame me? Damn� she did. She did manage to shame me, without even touching me. And she enjoyed every moment of it.� I felt my cheeks burn.

Doctor Jitesh walked in with her journal in her hand reading from it. She was a middle-aged woman with grey streams in her black hair that she had gathered up in a ponytail behind her head. She wore the white lab coat, which waved in the air behind her. The blue caste mark of the scholars adorned her forehead. �Servent Jana and Servant�� she brushed her finger on the corner of the paperscreen, turning the page. ��Farah.� she continued.

I took two steps back and stood attention beside Kalia, feet together and hands behind my back. �Yes Ma&#8217;am.� I said. She still hadn&#8217;t looked at us, her eyes focused on our journal in front of her. �My title is Doctor. Shouldn&#8217;t be too hard to remember.� she noted as she flipped yet another page and finally looked up on us. I was about to apologize as she interrupted me. �Take of your clothes. This should be fairly quick.�

It was a bit weird. I&#8217;ve been taking of my clothes for strangers several days in a row now, and now when a doctor ordered me to take my clothes off it almost felt liberating. Not because I like being naked in front of others, but because it&#8217;s not out of the ordinary to be naked in front of a doctors I guess. It felt ok. I quickly slid out of my uniform, kicked my shoes of and nudged my stockings off.

She examined me first. �Sit on the bed please.� I jumped up on the bed. �Your medical report looks very complete so I won&#8217;t be bothered with complementing it. That leaves only three procedures.� she said pulled off the plastic cover on a box of syringes.

I hated needles.

I looked at it intently. �What&#8217;s that?� I asked quickly. �This�� she said as she soaked a cotton ball in alcohol. �Is an inoculation.� I looked at it. �But, I&#8217;ve already had my inoculations at school Doctor, when I was little.�

�Well�� she scrubbed my arm with the cotton ball �Those were only for the most common diseases and cancers. There are two billion citizens in the commonwealth. Phage based inoculations aren&#8217;t exactly priceless but when you have to inoculate millions of children each year, you pick the most common diseases and ailments to inoculate for. This�� she said proudly as she stuck the needle in my arm. �Is for everything.�

I winced slightly. �Everything?� I asked, thinking it sounded a bit implausible. �Well, now that we know what you are going to do in your life, we have a clearer image to what we should inoculate you for. This shot is for every STD known to mankind.� she said and smiled and finally looked my in the eye. She was a bit over fifty, but she had clearly maintained her youth. She looked good, maternal almost.

�Thank you Doctor.� I said. �Hm� The woman just said, &#8216;since you&#8217;re going to be fucked repeatedly by a large amount of men for the rest of your life, we&#8217;re going to immunize you to sexually transmitted diseases&#8217;. And I thanked her?� I thought, feeling a bit weird. Was I really going to be a whore? Considering how expensive and orderly this entire school seemed I guess that they wouldn&#8217;t bother that hard if I was just going to be working the streets of the red light district? I decided I had to ask Rohena about it again.

She then went to a cabinet and swiped her card and punched in a code opening it. It was made out of metal and the doors looked sturdy to say the least. She pulled out a contraption that looked like a metal collar fastened to a handle that almost looked like a gun, with a firing trigger. A small viewscreen was fastened on top of the handle facing the one holding it.

�What&#8217;s that?� I wondered out loud. �This is a cervical implant machine.� she said as she walked up behind me with it. �Hold your hair up.� she told me. I didn&#8217;t feel like arguing, I was a little bit too scared for that. �What does it do?� I managed to blurt out. �It implants your personal monitor�� she said as she fitted the metal collar around my neck. It clicked in place and I could feel the padded inside press softly against my throat.

I heard it hum behind me as she activated it. �We have to give it a couple of seconds while it scans your neck. This machine will fasten a small device on your spine in your neck. Don&#8217;t worry, It won&#8217;t hurt.� she said. �The machine will monitor your vital signs. Breathing, pulse, nervous activity and such and report it back to us. It also keeps track of where you are� Slight pinch.� she said. My brain barely processed what she meant before I felt my neck stiffen and my skin pinch painfully like someone fiercly grabbed it between her fingers and twisted it hard.�

�Aah!� I yelped out. But after the initial pain, I felt nothing. I felt the collar slip away from my throat and she detached the machine from me. �You have a local anaesthetic around the skin in your neck now. When it wears off you will be a bit stiff for a couple of days.� she circled around me and laid her hand on my shoulder, I looked up at her rubbing my neck. �If you feel any pain in your neck or throat, for whatever reason� you must come see me immediately, ok?� she said. I nodded to her �I&#8217;m not stupid you know�� I thought to myself.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Two other pairs of juniors entered the room, I pulled my legs together feeling somewhat naked in front of these new arrivals. Doctor Jitesh pulled the curtains around my bed. She pulled up a can of ointment and donned a pair of thick plastic gloves. �Do you shave your armpits or legs?� she asked. �Now and then� I just began getting hair there a year or so ago.�

�Ok, this is mandatory.� she said and held up the can. �This salve will loosen the hair from your skin and open the pores and hair sacks. I am going to spread it on your legs and armpits. After that, we will clean it off together with all the hairs. Then we will use this�� she said and held up another can. �Which will chemically kill your hair sacks. This will take about half an hour.� she said. �What, you will remove my hair� permanently?� I asked. �Only on your legs and armpits sweetie.� she said and patted my knee. �That&#8217;s so cool!� I thought.

A couple of minutes later�

�This is &#8211;so- not cool!� I lay naked on the bed, sweating, feeling my legs and armpits burn! I had my hands behind my head, my feet on the mattress and my legs raised from the bed. The first salve had just felt a bit warm. Then a nurse, which I guess was a senior or a sophomore at the school, came along and scraped off the salve with a stick, cleaned me up and applied the second salve. She could&#8217;ve just as well lit me on fire, by the gods it stung.

I bit my lip, looking up at my legs, which were coated, in a bluish salve. I moaned pain wracked as my head crashed back down on the bed. �Gods, how much longer?� I wondered as I restlessly rearranged my feet on the padded mattress. The curtain around me kept me out of sight, and I was quiet enough to stay out of mind, from the rest of the room. The rest of the room was however not quiet in the least.

Nurses, which was apparently students working here part time, came and went. They wore white plain uniforms, modest shoes and a simple hairpiece. New juniors almost seemed to pour in.&nbsp; I heard someone redirect them to another room, the room must be full then.

Suddenly, the nurse who was prepping the junior next to my bed bumped into the curtain without noticing it as she turned and left. The curtain slid open a feet or so, allowing ample space to see the other persons face on the other side. I tilted my head and looked to the other bed and saw a person I had almost forgotten, but was glad I hadn&#8217;t.

Mahi, the petite Bengali girl from the bus that made me act stupid by just looking in my general direction. She was lying on her bed and staring up at the ceiling. She hadn&#8217;t noticed me yet. She rested her hands behind her head, giving her armpits air. I saw the blue paste on her, she was going be in for quite a sting pretty soon. �Should I warn her? No, seriously look at me. I&#8217;m lying here spying on her. She hadn&#8217;t noticed me yet, maybe she never will? I would be embarrassed out of my wits if she caught me. Maybe I shouldn&#8217;t watch.� I thought and silently turned my head away, playing innocent and looked up at the ceiling.

�Gods it burns! Take it off, take it off!� An upset voice could be heard from the other side of the room. Rapid footsteps walked to the direction of the sound and I listened intently at the little drama that played out in the room. Soft hushed voices talked to her and she talked back, clearly not happy. I couldn&#8217;t hear what they said but her loud complaints turned into soft groaning and snivelling instead and the nurses walked away.

When it was over I was left with my burning legs and arms again. I needed something to focus my attention on. �Maybe I should just talk to Mahi? It wasn&#8217;t my fault that the nurse bumped the curtain after all. Yeah, I&#8217;ll talk to her.� I took a confident breath and turned my head to say hi to her but was stopped in my tracks by a sight I wasn&#8217;t expecting.

Mahi didn&#8217;t stare up in the ceiling any more and she certainly didn&#8217;t have her hands behind her head anymore. Her eyelids were closed and I could see her eyes wander back and forth underneath the skin. Like small electric shocks, her eyelids and lashes fluttered slightly. She breathed rapidly, but quietly and her arms� well. Her one arm was reaching down alongside her body. I couldn&#8217;t see due to the curtain, it only showed me down to her shoulders. �Her shoulder is pressed down, like she&#8217;s reaching for something. The arm looks like it&#8217;s positioned so that it would slide along her belly and down to� oh.� I thought as put two and two together.

�She&#8217;s reaching down to her crotch? And her other hand is at her chest? She&#8217;s masturbating. In the infirmary? With an entire room filled with people on the other side of a thin plastic curtain? With all that salve on her body smouldering on her legs and armpits?� I thought as I stared at her in disbelief.

I pressed myself upwards ever so slowly to get a better angle, I wanted to see her breasts. I slid up over the disposable paper on the bed. It ruffled slightly, she didn&#8217;t seem to notice. The curtain slowly inched out of my view and I saw down over her left breast. Small, cup shaped and firm. Her hand kneaded it softly, her hard nipple standing out like a monument to her salaciousness between her small fingers. �By the gods, look at her nipples. Rock hard, she really is getting of. But how? She must aching all over like I am?� I thought. 
 
Her back arched up against the mattress and she bit down on her own lip to stay quiet as her body, unseen from all but me started twitching softly as a quick orgasm coursed through her body. As she let her body back down on the bed I slid back down my own mattress, not wanting to be discovered by her. But this time, she heard the ruffling paper as I moved and turned her head at me, eyes wide open in shameful realisation of that she was just watched.

Just as I wanted to tell her how pretty she is, she closed her eyes together and turned head away from me, silencing me effectively. �I knew I shouldn&#8217;t have watched! So predictable, so stupid.� I thought, berating myself. I looked away from her, keeping my eyes down. I saw my bluish legs and remembered how much they stung. I winced as I moved them slightly.

�She&#8217;s going to think I&#8217;m some sort of pervert� Now I&#8217;m never going to be able to talk to her.� I sighed and felt a wave of sorrow wash over me. I felt weak. �I want to talk to her� I want to hold her. She&#8217;s so little, I want to wrap my arms around her and feel her relax.� I bit my lip. �Did I just blow it?� I thought and looked up at the window.

The monsoon rain had started again and I listened to it smatter on the window outside. �What a day�� I thought. �If there&#8217;s a first time for everything, then I guess today is a virtual torrent of firsts.� I mused and stared out the window. �When it rains, it pours.�
