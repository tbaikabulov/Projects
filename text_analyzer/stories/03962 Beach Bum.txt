Synopsis: A Master brings his lover to the beach to watch the sun rise






Beach Bum
By Mad Lews ï¿½

Sandy always looks so innocent when she's asleep. She'd snuggle down under the sheet, naked, but for her collar, a sweet smile on her lips. I almost hated to disturb her, but the sun would be up shortly.

 I flipped on the light and pulled the sheet away, revealing her in all her delightfully naked glory.

"Oh god, what time is it?" she mumbled, yawning and rubbing her sleep filled eyes.

"Get up, hands behind your back. Now!" I snapped not wishing to discuss my plans with her.

Sandy's well trained and hurried to obey, never one to upset her Master. She stood with her feet apart and hands crossed behind the small of her back.

I do so love the way she strives to please, but I also like to keep her on her toes. Still, who would begrudge me a little kiss followed by a lick and a nibble on those delightfully displayed nipples? After I was done nibbling, we got on with the business of properly dressing my sweet sub.

I turned her about so she faced away and pressed her hands together, palms outward. I prefer to use nylon rope, three-strands with five-sixteenths inch thickness, works well for intricate knotting. Three loops around the wrists, then I cinched them and knotted the rope in place. The next loops, half way up the forearm, were cinched and knotted. I quickly worked my way up her arms pulling her elbows tightly together then working higher still.

When I was satisfied her shoulders were forced back and her breasts prominently thrust forward, I tied the rope off in a knot that I could easily release but of course she could not reach. I lifted her bound arms off her back and Sandy moaned as she was forced to bend forward. I released my grip and she straightened, her bound hands coming to rest atop the graceful curve of her ass.

"It's four thirty, the sun will be up soon. We're going to the beach to watch the sun rise," I cheerfully told my love.

She probably wanted to complain about this harebrained idea,.  She definitely would have preferred sleeping in, but what can a poor girl do when her Master calls?&nbsp; Even if it is before the crack of dawn.

I rummaged through our dresser drawers and found a skirt. It was a dark, gauzy, cotton skirt; a bit longer than I approve of, but it had an elastic waist so it fit my needs of the moment. My sub couldn't dress herself with her arms bound behind her, so I held the skirt open in front of her and she daintily stepped into it. I pulled it up over her hips then gave her a playful swat on the tush through the thin fabric. I just love to hear that sexy little yelp of hers.

At the doorway we stopped to clip the ten-foot walking leash to her collar. I slipped my left hand through the leash's handle, a mere formality, but one I do enjoy.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
We stepped out into the predawn darkness; it was a bit cool and a breeze was coming in off the ocean. Even from this distance, you could hear the surf pounding. Our condo was right on the boardwalk a hundred yards from the ocean and at this hour we were assured a little privacy. Sandy was shivering so I wrapped my right arm around her naked shoulder pulling her closer, more for comfort than warmth. From a distance in the darkness we were the most common of sights. Two lovers headed for the beach, only a closer inspection would reveal that my beauty was topless, bound and wore a collar and leash.

"Master, I need to go." She whispered in my ear, though there was no one around to hear her.

I sighed; we were only fifty yards from the end of the boardwalk, sand and saw grass were on either side of the path. With a nod, I led her off onto the sand. She squatted down as the wind tugged at her skirt. 

I hoped she wouldn't wet it.

"Come on little one, we don't want to be late."

We'd become a different common sight; a man out walking his leashed pet, waiting impatiently for her to finish her business. I looked about but there was no one nearby; out along the beach I could see lights from a few scattered night fishermen still casting into the surf. She finished, rose, and was transformed, once more becoming a lover at my side on a stroll to the beach.

We reached the end of the boardwalk where a wooden stairway descended down onto the beach itself. The tide was coming in and the surf roared as it crashed into the sand. The sky to the east was lightening, though the sun was still a few minutes away. Sandy stepped toward the stairway but the leash pulled her up short.

"Halt!" I ordered, relishing the authority. "Down girl."

 I had her become my bitch pup again. 

Sandy squatted down on her haunches at the top of the stairway. A gust of wind blew her skirt out behind her, revealing her lovely pear shaped bottom and I immediately knew what I wanted. I wrapped her leash around the wooden railing and squatted down beside her. As she turned her head toward me, her trussed arms were forced off to the right. Her expression was filled with curiosity and need. She wanted to know what I required of her. She awaited my orders.

At times like this I know why I'm in love.

My left hand gripped her shoulder, pressing it downward while my right hand dipped between her legs, pushing her bottom upward while I stroked her hairless mons. She whined pitifully and rocked forward onto her knees as her forehead came to rest on the boardwalk. She was shaking as she bent to my whim, her delicious little ass wavering in the air as she kowtowed before the roaring ocean.

I drew the skirt up over her back, exposing her. She turned her head toward me, her lips forming a kiss. My hand slid higher between her legs exploring her moist folds. She was wet, but not nearly enough for what I had in mind.

I expressed my disappointment with a sharp slap across her left buttock. She squealed in shock, her body jerking with a start. I applied a second swat to her right cheek just because symmetry is important. This time when my hand delved into her inner folds, she wept moisture with abandon. 

She whimpered softly as I moistened my fingers within her. She gave another startled cry as my hand withdrew and rose higher, a finger gently circling the puckered ring of flesh that was my true destination. She sobbed, no doubt preferring I use her in any other way but that. My finger pressed forward, insistent. Slowly she opened to the invading digit, which sank deeper and then unhurriedly withdrew. A second moistened finger joined the first, gently stretching, probing and plunging forward with restrained enthusiasm. By now Sandy had begun to warm to the idea, moaning as her hips rotated in counterpoint to my invading fingers. She was almost ready and the sun was nearly upon us.

I reluctantly pulled my fingers out but her greedy little bottom wanted more, swaying and pushing back as it tried to follow the retreating digits. I rose over my prostrate? lover and used her cinched arms to raise her up onto her knees, then I stood before her loosening the drawstring of my shorts and tugging them down. Her eyes widened as I sprang free, bobbing before her.&nbsp; She needed no instructions now, eagerly engulfing me with her lips. I slid deeper toward the back of her throat, my hands on her shoulders steadying her.

"You'll want to moisten that real well, woman."&nbsp; I growl impatiently and of course her only answer was a sputtering noise as she gulped.

I thrust in and out a few times, stretching her lips while she drooled and slathered me as best she could. The sky was brightening and the sun was almost ready. I reluctantly pulled away from Sandy's loving mouth and took my position behind her.

My knees nudged her legs further apart as I slid forward, pulling her hips toward me and sinking into her sopping pussy. She sighed contentedly. Perhaps she thought I'd changed my mind, but then I spat into my hand and rubbed the saliva between her cheeks. Eagerly smearing this final bit of lubricant while my fingers worked anew to loosen and relax her tighter entrance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

I rocked back slowly, sliding out of her dripping pussy while at the same time cupping her breasts and pulling her up until her back pressed against my chest, her bound arms forced off to the side. My knees slid forward beneath her, forcing her legs further apart, lifting her up off her own knees until she was forced up onto her feet and was squatting over my lap.

"Such a cute little ass," I gloated, my impatient cock sliding along the crevice of her butt.

 I released her breasts, but only so I could support her bottom and raise her hips a little bit higher.

It was nearly time.

My thumbs pulled her cheeks open; I throbbed in anticipation, positioning myself against her puckered opening.

A bright line of orange crested the eastern horizon as I release her hips.

With a sharp squeal she slowly slid down my full length.

It was such an exquisite feeling as I slipped through that tight portal on my way toward ecstasy. I wanted to hold her there forever, buried in her snug embrace, but after just a few taut seconds I could not be restrained. I thrust with abandon while she bounced up and down on my lap with equal enthusiasm. My hands returned to her breasts, squeezing her nipples between thumbs and forefingers.

She cried out in excruciating delight and bounced harder and faster. Soon she was sobbing wildly and calling my name. All thought had abandoned both of us as we rejoiced in pure feeling. She begged and pleaded, but what she was begging for I'm not sure that even she could say. My right hand abandoned her breast to slide down across her belly coming to rest just above her throbbing nub.

The last bit of that fiery orange ball lifted above the horizon.

 I whispered in her ear, "Cum for me Sandy," as my fingers strummed across her throbbing clit.

She screeched and jerked about on my lap as I spurted deep inside her. It seemed to go on forever.

I wrapped my arms around her, hugging her tight, as we both tried to regain our breath.&nbsp; 

I barely recovered in time to see that three curious surf casters had picked up their gear and were headed toward our stairway. I pulled up my shorts then pulled Sandy's skirt up over her breasts. It was long enough to still cover her as long as she kept her knees together.&nbsp; We sat together at the top of the stairway with my arm around her shoulder to obscure the fact that her arms were bound behind her. The three fisherman&#8217;s eyes were riveted on my love as they climbed the stairs. That was natural, as she is a delightful sight even when clothed. She blushed prettily under their leering eyes. After they were past us, all three began to chatter excitedly, though the wind off the ocean took their words away. Still there was no mistaking the sound of three men chuckling, and no doubt at Sandy's expense. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
It wasn't until we rose to leave that I realized she was still tethered to the railing. They had been staring at her leash and collar, no wonder they were laughing as the left. I unhitched the leash and held her to me. 

"Do you think they were jealous Master?" Sandy asked coyly.

Of course they were and with good reason, but she already knew that.
