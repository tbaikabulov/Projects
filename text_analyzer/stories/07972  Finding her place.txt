Synopsis: Story of a woman who meets a man with very sadistic intentions. He treats her as he wants, and she tries to come to terms with wanting him anyway (the story is mainly nc)






She had met him through work. And it had been so predictable and conventional, that it had surprised her. He had been there as part of a presentation. She had found him attractive from the first moment she put her eyes on him. His slightly stern, bossy way, spiced with a touch of irony. And the way he seemed serious in a profound way. Like he took life and himself seriously. And still there was that touch of irony, humor. He never broke eye contact, when she spoke to him the first time. It was like she had been seen for the first time, since she entered that company.� 
Her name was Anne, and she had, at the age of 25, just finished university. She had studied psychology, and the job at the prison was her very first. She had applied for just about everything, but this was the only reply she had received. It was a rather boring, mainly office based job, only rarely had she met any inmates. The more experienced, and not to mention male psychologists worked with all the interesting subjects. She was however eager to please, and to do her job right. Most of the day, she was just lonely, though. 
Typing in journal entries and filling registrations. Sometimes the job involved lectures and presentations from other areas of research and work. Those where the highlights of her week. The day she met Jack, it had been a presentation on a new strategy of prevention through early intervention military style. 
Everyone, including herself, had mocked them before they arrived. The military was not seen as anything but a bunch of brainless brutes, thinking that criminal prevention could be achieved through even more violence. Or so she had thought. She was determined to be entertained, and to feel superior, even before they arrived. When the had entered, three men in rather plain shirts and pants, muscular, but not overly so, and Jack, the founder of the project, and obvious leader of the team, her prejudges had died down some what. They had been standing around in the meeting room, her colleagues embarrassingly, had been boisterous and condescending. She had felt nothing but shame at their behavior, and embarrassingly presumptuous questions. In an apologetic tone, she had asked a meek question with absolutely no aggression, and with her eyes flickering towards the floor. Jack had answered her, and looked into her eyes, with such an honest and intense expression, like he was not only answering her question, but seeing her most inner workings.� 
She really didn't understand what made her so fluttered, when she was around him. But she had only been able to thank him for his reply in something close to a stutter. Now, she wasn't the most loud and bossy type, especially not at work, where all her colleagues where very keen to keep her in her place, but she was certainly not a little submissive excuse for herself either. Only whenever he was near. In the remission, of what turned out to be a very good and professional lecture, he had turned to her, and told her "I'd like a cup of tea, lemon, no sugar". She was not a secretary, and though she was not a senior yet, she was, at least on paper, on the level of everybody there. At least none of her colleagues had asked her to act like a waitress. 
She got up, and went to the kitchen in a daze. Why did she play go fetch with this guy? It was the look in his eyes. So commanding, so serious. But not in the disgusting way her colleagues used to piss of their territory with each other, and with her. There was no power play, no insecurity. Just a command, and a response. In front of everybody. She brought him the tea, lemon on the side, and sat down blushing madly and hopelessly. He had talked to her, as if he hadn't just ordered her to cater to him, in an interested and keen way. Asking her about her master thesis, her work. She had replied, and even dared asking him about his work. Somehow, the balance was all skewed, though. He turned out to be well read, to have a really thorough insight in the field he was working in, and there was unfortunately nothing she could dislike him for � 
She told herself she was crazy, that nobody else saw the energy that seemed to stream from him. And that he was in fact absolutely charming. He possessed what she valued most in both men and women. Insight, knowledge, yet a certain naturalness. There was nothing stuck up about him. 
After the presentation was over, he gently pulled her aside, and asked her out. Just another romance that started at the office. Except he had not really asked her out, he had "told" her out. She had simply obeyed, or so she felt. Not that she wasn't eager to see him again. She was. But she was also worried at her own reaction. 
He took her to an Vietnamese restaurant, he ordered for both of them, but otherwise the date seemed relatively normal. They had had a lot to talk about, working in similar fields, and sharing, it turned out, some of the same interest. He was incredibly sharp, and forced her to cut down to the essentials, and to reveal more of her thoughts and feelings, than she wanted to. But there wasn't anything obvious. And she did enjoy herself. Every minute she spend with him was a tense one. And she couldn't quite figure out why. After the meal, they had walked around the city, talking and then he had simply followed her home. At her door, she had suddenly felt very nervous, almost scared. Scared he'd kiss, scared he wouldn't. She felt like a teenager and her first crush. She had lowered her eyes to the sidewalk, and muttered something rather incomprehensible about the weather. He hadn't said anything, but stepped up to her, and lifted her face with his finger. She felt like a dear trapped in the headlights of a car. But he had simply lowered his head to her eyes, and said "I'll pick you up at 6 tomorrow. I want you to wear a small skirt, and something with a cleavage". Then he turned and left. 
She had been left standing with her mouth open, completely unsure how to react. 
He had picked her up at her apartment the next day. But only after telling her to change, as he didn't think the skirt was short enough. And she had shocked herself by simply obeying. The atmosphere at dinner had been tense, almost charged with something that never really got to the surface. She had carefully avoided mentioning anything to do with clothing, and mainly, she spend the evening, trying to look modest in her way to short skirt. The cleavage had been easier, since she actually wore tops that showed of her big breasts, and she actually liked the attention she got from wearing clothes like that. But she always wore medium long skirts, since it seemed to slutish show of both legs and tits at the same time. She had bought some rather tiny skirts, though. She had worn them when she was a teenager, and eager to be noticed. Besides, back then her tiny a-cups just hadn't done the trick. Now that she was a generous E, that was the part of her anatomy she liked to set in scene. Her round butt had also increased somewhat in size, reaching a somewhat more round and meaty stage, though not fat.� 
In spite of the tension, the evening still went by incredibly fast. And soon they where in front of her door again. This time he told her, plain, and to her face, that he expected to pick her up the upcoming Thursday. He added that he was sure she could find something shorter than that skirt, and then he kissed her. He didn't wait for her to respond, he simply bent down and kissed her. Hard, demanding. When she felt the tip of his tongue on her lips, it felt like her knees would give. Soon he was kissing her deeply, almost raping her mouth, making her entire body scream with the intensity of it. She couldn't remember ever having been so turned on, or have felt such utter helplessness. After a short while, he broke it of, said goodnight with the most irritating of smiles, and left.� 
She felt positively dizzy. She couldn't even bring herself to masturbate, everything would just seem like a pale shadow after that kiss. The intensity of just being near him. She tried to shake herself. At least she would have a few days to compose herself, think things over, and decide what to do. But the battle had already been lost, somehow. Her days seemed to stretch on forever, it was as if she had had a glimpse of the world in color, and now had to live it in black and white. 
She met with her friends, and she tried to explain to them what was happening. She had to tone down his domineering style a little, or they would have thought she was crazy for staying with him.� 
They all told her the same, and that with conviction. She would have to step up now, not allow him to boss her around, or the relationship would always be skewed and the power all on his side. She would be one of those awful little women, who was never seen, just used as a piece of decoration or servant, then ignored. It was thoughts she had had herself, so it had only confirmed her in her resolution. She could not give up this man. She was too intrigued. But she had to say stop. 
The next Thursday she wore a very decent A-shaped skirt, that stopped at her knees, and a top that only showed skin, no real cleavage. She decided to top it of with stay-ups with a nice lace edge (hoping that it might actually be seen), and black, lacy underwear. She wore very high heeled shoes to go with it all. It was time to take back control. She made sure she looked the best she could, taking extra care with her makeup and hair. She was satisfied that most men would find her classy and sexy at the same time.� 
Exactly on time, the door bell rang. She took a deep breath, and decided she would be able to weather his displeasure, should he be displeased. She opened the door with a determined smile on her face. His stern gaze looked up and down her body in a second. 
"You look lovely, dear. But this is NOT what i told you to wear. Go change NOW, and I will forget this little infraction" He said in a stern, yet calm voice. She could feel her body twitching, as if she was already halfway to her bedroom to change. She had prepared a little speech on how she would wear what ever she damn well pleased, and how it was none of his concern. But all words got stuck in her throat. All she managed was to shake her head, and look at the ground, in what looked more like a meek little girl posture, than the self assured independent woman one she had planned.� 
In one very determined motion, he took her arm, and let her into the her hallway, and closed the door behind them. She looked at him with questioningly, and not a little terrified. He simple led her into the bedroom of her small apartment. The only thing she could think of was that she wished she'd tidied up all the skirt and blouses still hung everywhere from when she tried to make her choice. Her tinniest skirt and most low cut blouse was also way to visible in the selection pile.� 
"Please, I really do think I can wear what I want" she said, in a pathetic attempt to regain some of her determination. He twisted her rather harshly, so she was facing him. Making her cringe in discomfort from the strong hold he still had on her upper arm. 
"You are, by far, the most naturally submissive person I've met. You obviously WANT to obey me, and yet you don't. Why?" He asked, making it sound like a scolding.� 
She looked up at him in surprise, but quickly lowered her eyes to the floor again. Unable to meet those stern eyes.� 
"I'm not submissive, I don't want to.. ", she said in what was, even to her, a very submissive voice. She simply couldn't bring herself to say "obey", feeling that the word wasn't safe, somehow. She was blushing furiously, and she cursed herself for her lack of resolve.� 
"Well, THAT is obvious" he said, and she could hear the smile in his voice. "If you won't obey me, then I'll simply have to teach you the consequences of that" he said, matter of factly.� 
He pulled her with him to the bed, sat down, and placed her belly down across his knees. Somehow she hadn't thought of resisting him up to that point, and it wasn't until he started lifting her skirt, that it finally dawned on her what was happening. 
"No, stop, please!" she whimpered, and finally tried to get up, and away from the situation. He simply pushed her down with one hand, and continued with the other. She started resisting in earnest, all the while begging him to stop. "Be quiet, and lie still" he commanded. For some reason, she actually obeyed for a short while, enough time for him to lift up her skirt completely of her bottom. 
"Nononononono!" She exclaimed, and fought back as much as she could. It was hopeless. He was so much stronger than her, and he had pinned her hands securely in the small of her back with one of his.� 
He then continued to remove her tiny and lovely knickers. She could feel herself blush, like she'd never blushed before. So deeply ashamed and embarrassed, that she felt more like crying, than fighting.� 
He jerked the panties down to the middle of her thighs, then he cupped and stroked her bottom.� 
"This is going to hurt. I want you to tell me, when you've decided to behave, then I'll can decide how much more you'll need to remember this in the future" 
She was positively terrified at that, at she almost forgot to beg and struggle for a second. Then he started spanking her. He hit her bottom with what felt like all the strength he could muster, really laying it on her defenseless behind, making her buttocks bounce. The sting and the pain where incredible, she completely lost what ever composure she had left howled in pain. He didn't leave her time to collect herself, but slapped her again and again, covering her entire butt in angry red handmarks. It took at least 20 heavy swats, and a very red and swollen ass, before she was coherent enough to howl out "please, I'll do whatever you wan't, pleeeeeeeeaasse! I'll obey, I'll wear what you want!". He stopped.� 
"I'm happy to hear that. Still, you disobeyed me, you are even still struggling and screaming, though I've told you to be quiet. I don't think we're even near done here". He reached down, and tore her panties of her thighs, breaking them, and giving her two red marks on her thighs. He then folded them into a ball, and holding her viciously by her hair, he pulled her head back, and stuffed them in her mouth. "Don't you dare spit them out" he growled. She started crying at this. He was so brutal, so completely void of any compassion, and it seemed, there was no limit to how nasty he would be to her. She lay limply over his knees, not daring to fight. He picked up something from the floor, something she later found out to be her pantyhose, and tied her hands together tightly. Then he pushed her legs to the floor, and lay his own across hers. Then he took of his belt. His very thick and heavy leather belt. With one hand he held her upper body, with the other, he now wielded the doubled up belt. Letting it crack across her cheeks on top of the hand marks. Her whole world was just her bottom and the belt. The next stroke, and how much it would hurt. She cried and wriggled over his knee, but she dared not spit out the panties. He was her entire universe, there was only him, his intentions, his will. And there was only room for pain and obedience in her mind. It seemed to go on forever. Angry red welts covered her bottom from the top of her cheeks, down to her thighs. Whack, whack, whack, filling her body and soul, defining her every thought. 
When he was certain there was no uncovered spot, not one place where she would not be marked or feel his punishment on her bottom, he finally stopped. She had stopped fighting, and had only jerked in response to �his strokes, crying and whimpering into the panties.� 
He let her lie there, broken and hurting over his knee for a little. Resting his big hand on her throbbing, burning butt. Then he lifted her up by her arm and gathered her up on his lap. He moved back to sit against her the wall, letting her hide her face at his chest, and he pulled out her soaking wet panties from her mouth.� 
She sobbed into his shirt while he held her in his strong arms. To broken and hurt to reflect deeply on the matter, she just savored, on an almost unconscious level, the feeling of safety it gave her to simply rest against him. It felt like tears she had build up for months, or even years, had finally been allowed to be let out. Soon it wasn't the throbbing, aching bottom, but just tears and sobbing being let out. After a while, she stopped. She felt oddly relieved and light headed, and her thoughts began to spin around how she could possibly see him anymore, after this. He stroked her hair, then lifted her face.� 

"Is there something you want to say to me?" 
He said in a stern, demanding tone, that surprised her. And to her horror, she knew what he wanted to hear. He wanted her to surrender completely, humiliate herself. She had no fight left in her, still she found it harder to say than she had ever imagined.� 
"I'm sorry I didn't do as you told me" she almost whispered, looking at his chest. 
"Louder, and with more conviction" he told her 
"I'm sorry I didn't obey you" she said, feeling tears threaten to fall again, but in a louder voice. 
"Good. Now, I want you to go out wash your face, and put on some makeup. Then come back here" He said. She looked at him completely taken a back. Surely, he wouldn't continue the date as if nothing had happened? She didn't dare ask, nor wait to see what else might come, she simply scuffled to the bathroom, and poured cold water on her face. She was taken aback by the woman looking back at her in the mirror. Her makeup had run, and her eyes where red from crying. But she was glowing. She looked positively beautiful, her eyes and skin seemed to radiate.. something. She washed of, combed her hair, and applied a little makeup. The she returned. She was still wearing her skirt and top. He was standing, and he had been smoothing out his black shirt with his hands. She stopped in the middle of the room, and looked at the floor. Not knowing what to do.� 
He looked her up and down, then he pointed to the bed. He had laid out a VERY slutty top, meant to be worn with something underneath it, and her tinniest black skirt. It would just cover her butt, and only as long as she didn't move to much. And it would look like her tits where trying to escape that tight top. "Put them on". He said simply, then turned his back on the bed, and continued removing the traces of her tears from his shirt.� 
She wasn't about to argue now, and she simply changed as fast as she could. She didn't dare ask him to leave the room, which also seemed like a useless thing to do, after what he had just done to her.� 
When she pulled down the skirt as long as it would go, it just covered the lowest part of the angry welts created by the belt. When she had finished dressing, she looked like a whore. An expensive one, with a very demure look on her face, but a slut none the less. Her high heels, and the black stay ups didn't help either. She looked down on the floor, and waited. Then she asked in her smallest voice, hoping it would sound really polite "can I have a pair of panties" He was standing in front of the drawer.� 
"No" He said. "you'll find that obeying me the first time around, will mean you have a lot more choices. Now you can go as you are, and if you behave, I'll let you sit with your legs closed". She looked at him terrified, but then bowed her head in submission. He had won, there was no battle. Maybe there never had been. At that, he let her out. She was terrified the wind might blow up her skirt at any time, and she was certain everyone was starring at her. Somehow, her arm in his gave her some courage and comfort.� 
He led her to a middle priced place, with a dance floor. She had to admit she was starving. He ordered for her again, something she barely noticed now. And when the waiter left, she suddenly felt like their lack of conversation was a strain.� 
"You look fantastic" he said, startling her a little. She blushed, and thanked him in a whisper.� 
"After tonight, I want you to decide what it is you want. If you wish to stop when I'm done with you today, you may do so. If you do not choose to stop, there are some things we should get out of the way".� 
She looked at him, simply allowing herself to be confused and not to make any decision. To simply sit there, her butt stinging, afraid, confused but also happy, for some odd reason. 
"Obviously, I am not interested in a normal little girlfriend. And obviously, I will expect you to be mine, for you to obey me and dress and act as I tell you. I think you will have gathered this much by yourself by now?" She felt awkward. She should of course have known this, also before he had punished her so cruelly. It was fairly obvious. She nodded, and looked at the table again.� 
"I think it is only fair that you should know, that I will not allow you to continue in the life you have led so far. After tonight I will pick your wardrobe, I will tell you what to eat, and generally I'll structure your life as I please. In the long run, and after a certain trial period, you will quit your job, and be my full time slave. I will do with you as I please, you will, in a very very real sense, belong to me, body and soul. After the trial period I will mark you, and you will be mine with absolutely no rights. I'll use you when and how I want to, and your main purpose will be to please me.� 
That said, I will promise to take good care of you. I will not cause you any permanent harm, other than the mark you'll receive, and I'll keep you fed, warm, occupied and, I think, overall more satisfied and truly happy than you can be in your current condition. I want you to submit to me, even if you do not understand this yet, and I will not let you escape. Once you've agreed to the trial period, you're mine until it runs out. If you decide to stay after that, all your choices will be taken from you. I think it is only fair to tell you this now. You will not be able to claim not to have known it, and maybe you can be more honest to yourself." 
It was a long speech, and she had not expected it, as she had not expected anything that evening. At first she was completely taken aback by this. Then she felt a panic start to spread in her stomach. A panic from the mere thought of a life without him.� 
"I really don't know" she said. "I'm just feeling confused right now.. I wish you would just be.. Let me do what I wanted. I don't think it means we can't see each other" She stuttered. � 
He smiled at her, warm and completely patronizing. "There will be no compromise. Either you'll be mine, or you wont see me after tonight. But down decide now. I'll give you until Friday. Take your time, this is not an easy decision. I have to say I'm happy to hear you are still enthusiastic about seeing me, in spite of you being so completely un-submissive" He smiled at her teasingly. And to her dismay, she couldn't help to smile back.� 
It was the oddest thing that had happened all night. Here she sat, her butt one big burning, throbbing mess, almost not clothes on, all because of this bastard.. And she enjoyed his little patronizing joke about her claim of independence. But it had already been a long night, and she simply didn't have the energy to reflect. She just let go. Then the food came, and they ate mainly in silence, her still not daring to look him directly into his eyes, and him clearly enjoying the very full view of her breasts.� 
He had ordered her a salad, and when she had finished, he got up, and pulled her out unto the dance floor. The music was slow and sensual, and he held her close, leading her gently to the rhythm.� 
She let herself enjoy the feeling of his arms around her, and just sucked up his scent, the warmth of his body, and the way he controlled her movements. He danced with her for almost an hour. He then paid their meal, and the went out into the cool night air. She tucked her arm in his, almost a reflex now. And they walked out quietly. She felt her head buzz from the music, the dancing, and disturbingly, her bottom still throb and ache with each step she took. The cool air on her skin reminded her of her lack of underwear, but it was dark now, and she cared very little.� 
It wasn't until they had walked quiet far, that she noticed they weren't walking towards her apartment. She looked at him questioningly, but when he just met her eyes, in that calm, steady way, she simply blushed, and looked away. Not for her to decide or to know. After another 10 minutes of walking, they had reached the somewhat upper scale part of town, and he led her into a lobby, and up an elevator. She still hadn't said a word. Nor had he. In the elevator, he turned her to him, and kissed her. She could feel her knees give, even stronger than the first time, and she could feel her nervous tension run through ever part of her body along with excitement. Somehow, the fact that he had spanked her made this even more intense and overwhelming.� 
The last steps up to his apartment seemed to float by on a haze. She felt happy, light, excited and open. He lead her through a the hallway, a big open room and down a corridor. His apartment was open spaced, tasteful and maybe a tad minimalistic. It seemed to be almost to tidy and clean. He let her in a doorway and into a big bedroom. A large king size bed bed stood up against one wall, it was wooden, and rather unpretentious, but the bed posters where large and connected on either side. There was a very large wooden closet, and a comfy chair and a puff. Otherwise the room was empty. The bedsheets where plain white, as were the curtains. 
As she stood there, alone with him in the room, and he looked her up and down, it also started to dawn on her, that she was alone with the man who had so recently beaten her savagely.� 
He took a step back, leaving her standing alone. "Show me your tits" he barked. She was taken aback, her head having been set on romance, the dizzy, excited feeling she got when he kissed, started to wear of. She looked at him in horror, frozen. Anger came back to his eyes, and he quickly stepped up to her, holding her arms back with one hand, he tore down her blouse with the other, and ripped of her bra, exposing her large, natural breasts. For just a second, she worried more about whether he would like her breasts, than about what he was doing.� 
He looked at her tits like a predator, the he started squeezing and pinching them. She was terrified, but the rough touch also sent a spark of pure lust straight down between her legs. 
"You still haven't learned to obey me, have you?" He breathed while pinching her nipple, looking her straight in the eyes 
"I'm sorry, please.. I'll.." She said with tears in her eyes. Afraid now, what he might do to her. 
"I'll have to repeat my lesson, then" He hissed. Then he let go of her. 
"Put your hands over your head, and grab your elbows with both hands" He snapped. She starred at him, but quickly complied, suddenly remembering who he had been that very evening, when she had not obeyed.� 
Then he started slapping her tits. Hard and painfully. Making them wobble and shake. She almost lost it, and was about to cover them, when she remembered the strapping she had received earlier. Instead, she stood there, taking slap after slap on how very soon very sore tits. �All she could do, was to howl out in pain, and beg him to stop, as he continued to mistreat her ample bosom. She couldn't help but squirm a little, and soon she started crying again, begging him to stop between sobs. Both her tits where red and swollen, when he stopped. 
"You're learning. And since you've actually behaved, I'll let you have a little favor". �He said, then he went to his closet, and came back with a roll of rope and a relatively small leather strap.� 
With no hesitation, he dragged her over to the left bedpost, and tied her up with expert movements. quickly she had her arms tied over her head to post. She was sobbing, terrified, and begging him to stop, her face a mess from the tears and mascara running down her face. It didn't seem to move him even a little. He grabbed the strap, and with no more preliminaries, he started to punish her breasts in earnest. Her sobs soon became screams of pain, as he trashed her front, covering her in red stripes. Especially when he caught her nipple, did she howl in agony.� 
It seemed to go on forever, and she was an incoherent and exhausted mess, when he finally stopped. 
"Now, I'll teach you a little manners, since this is only your second punishment. But since I have had the good grace to teach you the error of your ways, I would like to hear a sincere apology, and a thank you". 
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry.. ! THank you!" she eagerly cried, not wanting to risk any further torment. 
"why are you sorry" 
"She looked down, tears in her eyes, trying to formulate the most embarrassing sentence of her life, and that before he'd grow impatient. "I'm sorry for not showing you my .. breasts". He caressed her breasts with one hand, making her wince in pain, still holding the strap in the other hand. 
"why are you sorry about that?" 
She tried to think.. why? She wasn't sure why she should be.. "because.. I.. You wanted to? I should obey you?" 
He stepped closer to her, lifting her face to his, as he held her face in a firm grip. "You should indeed obey me. You are mine to take, and to do with as I please, when I please. Do NOT forget that" 
"I won't please, I'm sorry" she sniffled.� 
In one quick move he released her hands, and she breathed a sigh of relief at finally getting her arms down, hoping it was over.� 
"Take of your clothes" he said, turning away to place the strap and the rope on the bed. She immediately complied, and soon she stood naked, shivering of fear. Her tits positively glowing red, and he ass still red, but mainly blue and black.� 
"on your knees" he demanded, and turned to her. She dropped to her knees in front of him. Somehow, this felt significant, though she couldn't figure out why. 
He opened his belt and pants, and took out a really fat, mean looking cock. 
"Open your mouth, and try to do you best" he said, and with no further foreplay, he showed his dig in her mouth. She had to open really wide, to get the fat head in. She was in a turmoil. This was certainly better than the strap, but she had never been good at, nor enjoyed oral sex. It seemed degrading and perverted. But she did feel a certain unwilling arousal from this, though she was also terrified. It was as if he was just made of something else, whenever he touched her, it was like a special connection to some very submissive part of her. Most of her just screamed for it to be over, though 
He started moving towards her, showing his dick further into her mouth. She backed, trying to avoid it from going further, not wanting it deeper. He grabbed her hair, and started moving in and out rhythmically, pushing it in further with each thrust.� 
It was awful! It made her choke and gag on his cock, making her eyes water and her jaws ache. He didn't seem to care, but simply pushed harder and harder. Forcing more and more cock down her unwilling throat. She had raised her hands and tried to push him away, horrified at the feeling. He didn't seem to notice. And not until she really thought another second would be impossible without gagging, he pushed in deep, then pulled out. She coughed and sputtered. He simply stood there, his giant rod hanging over her head.� 
When she had regained her composure somewhat, he told her to get up, and lie on the bed on her back. 
She did so, but not without looking at him pleadingly, and letting out a sob. That cock was enormous, and she really wasn't sure she could take it. �Of course, that was completely hopeless. "Spread your legs wide, and bend your knees" he said, disrobing himself as he ordered her.� 
She blushed. No body, except her doctor, had ever seen her so exposed. Her small pink pussy on display for him, as she lay there trembling. Soon he had thrown all his clothes in a pile, and he climbed onto the bed. He was muscular and well proportioned. His chest almost naked, except for a little hair right on the middle of chest. It was dark, like the short hair on his head. But she could barely take her eyes of his cock. It loomed in front of him, so big and hard, it made her shiver.� 
Soon he had positioned himself between her soft thighs, and he placed the head of his cock at her entrance, then he used his hand to grab and squeeze her sore breasts a little, making her wince. He smiled down at her.� 
"brace yourself, this is going to hurt" he said, and then he started pushing forward. It felt like he was trying to fit a building up there, she almost immediately forgot all about obedience, and tried to close her legs, and push him away. 
"Please no, aaah! It hurts, stop, take it out, please" She screamed a new. He simply smiled viciously at her 
"that's not even the head, yet" he said, and holding her ass with his hands, he started pushing in with renewed vigor. He moaned in pleasure, as he felt her give, her soft cunt stretching to give way. She was screaming now, writhing beneath him, as he impaled her deeper and deeper. She could not believe how much it hurt, her insides burning and throbbing. Half way in, he started pumping, pulling almost all the way out, then showing himself all the way back in. Not only did he gain a little depth, he also added to her pain, and the brutality of the rape. After the third shove, he was to his balls. Groaning in pleasure, he started fucking her mercilessly. Using long, hard strokes, he smashed his balls against her ass with each thrust. She was covered in sweat, and she was still fighting against him as much as she could, but she was growing tired, and her voice was softer, her throat sore from the blowjob and the long time of screaming. 
The rape seemed to go on, and on. Smashing into her, stretching and abusing her poor pussy. Finally he started to fuck her even faster and harder, bringing the rhythmic "slap, slap" of his balls on her ass up to a frantic crescendo, making her howl out again. He moaned loudly in pleasure, and pressed her up against him, as he lifted her up to get as deep inside of her as he could, for his climax. He savored the feeling of her tight, moist pussy around his cock, as he relaxed on top of her sobbing body.� 
When he had regained his composure, he lifted himself of her, grabbed the robe, and tied her arms behind her back. Then he cuddled her up in his arms, and pulled the covers over them.� 
She knew she should hate him forever for what he just did, but when she felt his strong arms around her, all she felt was relief, a strange sense of safety, and very, very tired. She fell asleep almost immediately.� 
She didn't know what time it was, but she woke up from her tits being mauled again, and when she opened her eyes, she looked straight into his hungry eyes.� 
"Turn over" he said, his voice hoarse with desire. She turned onto her stomach, fear fresh on her mind again. He climbed on top of her, and soon she felt his cock pressing against her from the back. Her cunt was so sore from the rape, just the touch of the cock made her grind her teeths in pain. With the added lubricant of his sperm, he quickly forced himself inside her, fucking her hard again. She sobbed helplessly into the pillow, not having the energy, nor the leverage to fight him. Then he grabbed one of her tits with one hand, pinching and mauling it, with the other, he found her clit, and started rubbing against it.� 
Between the clouds of pain, she started to feel the lust and the pleasure build. The pain was still strong, but she almost craved it now, lustful and half dizzy with desire, the tension build and build as he thrust into her brutally. When she finally came, she almost fainted from the intensity of it. He mouth emitted sounds she never heard before, as wave after wave rolled over her. Her pussys violent spasms on his dick sent him over the edge, and he came hard up deep in her pussy, again riding her extra hard and deep for his orgasm. Only this time it merely intensified her own climax. 
he held her close, and stroked her hair, as she shook and gasped in the aftermath, soon falling asleep, wrapped up in his arms again. 
He woke her several times during the night, making her howl with pain from her increasingly raw pussy, and then scream in pleasure, as he made her cum again and again. She lost all sense of time and place, when she finally woke by herself. The bed was empty, and her hands had been freed. 
"Jack?" she called out in a soft, hoarse voice, that surprised her. There was no reply, so she scrambled out of bed, wincing at the soreness from her tits, ass and especially her pussy. She walked into the hall, and the first door turned out to be the bathroom. It was nice and clean, white, with white towels laid out on a little stool.� 
She used the bathroom, and stared at herself in the mirror. Her eyes where puffy from crying, and her makeup had been smeared, and was mostly gone, but her eyes glowed, as did her skin. She looked better than she had ever seen herself. Her tits where bruised, though not as badly as she had thought they wood. They where a a little pink in places, but otherwise they looked fine. Her ass was still covered in bruises and welts, but they too had faded, and no longer looked as horrifying. Her hair was standing out in a million directions, and she felt sticky with her own juices and Jacks sperm. She decided to take a shower, and relished the feeling of the warm water, though at first it had burned her sore skin. She used his shampoo and shower gel, saying a little prayer, that he would not be upset about that.� 
When she got out, she felt like a new person, as if she was clean and rested for the first time in her life.� 
She wrapped a big fluffy towel around her, and decided to look around to see if she could find him.� 
She walked gingerly around the apartment, but soon she could follow the scent of breakfast to the kitchen.� 
He was dressed, and was fixing himself some toast, it seemed, as she entered.� 
"Kneel" was all he said, and she immediately dropped to the floor where she was standing. 
He sat at the round table in the kitchen, with a cup of tea, looking at her for a while. 
She didn't dare say anything, but found herself blushing and feeling nervous again, bowing her head, and looking at the floor. 
"I have called a cap for you. It will arrive in ten minutes. I will not contact you again, if you wish to become mine, then you must call me. You have till Friday to decide. You have seen a little of what I expect of you, only should you choose to be mine, it will obviously include more of you, your whole day and doing. I've left my card in your purse. If you have not called me by Friday, you will not see me again. Is that understood?" 
"ahm.. Yes.. " she said meekly. Somehow, she had expected him to be more .. warm after the horrible and fantastic night they had spend. She didn't move, but knelled there, her head bowed. Waiting. It was another five minutes before he spoke again. 
"Go get dressed. Your clothes are in the bedroom along with your purse. The taxi will be waiting at the front door. Go there immediately after" 
For some reason her eyes watered a little, she could not explain to herself why she felt so lonely all of a sudden. She got to her feet in a hurry, and went to put on her deep cut top and her skimpy skirt. Her bra was gone, so she just put on her high heels, snapped her purse, and walked briskly out, not daring to look for him again. The cap was there, and had obviously been given directions to her place, as it started as soon as she got in. The cap driver ogled her a little, but seemed to accept her silence. The only visible marks of the night, where to pale rope marks �on her wrists.� 
The whole night had been like a nightmare. She had dreamed of being let go through most of it. But now she was out, all she felt was a sense of loss. She wasn't even sure what it was she felt she lost. Herself? or his presence. Friday was a long time away.
