Chapter 1- Reminders

&nbsp;

Gwen woke up with a start. The last thing she remembered was
leaving the company gym and heading toward her car. What she didn�t remember
was ever reaching it. As she laid in the bed, she felt
strange-this didn�t feel like her bed. She reached up toward the headboard and
found that her hands were cuffed together.

����������� As Gwen
began to panic, she tried to open her eyes and found that she could see
nothing. Her breathing quickened as she took a mental stock of her
surroundings. She was blindfolded and her wrists bound. She could also feel
that she was naked under the sheet covering her and her ankles were bound
together. As she started to struggle, she could hear someone opening a door.
She went rigidly still, hoping they would not notice she was awake. 

����������� �You must
be wondering where you are by now,� said a distorted, deep voice. It sounded
like it came through some kind of speaker, maybe even a voice-changer. Gwen
continued to lie still, hoping the voice would go away. �That�s okay, I don�t need
you to talk, just listen. Your days of freedom are over. From now on you�ll
serve me and do what you�re told. I�ve missed you.� He let that sink in for a
moment. �Any questions?�

����������� Gwen
hesitated. Clearly this man already knew she was awake, but she was still
scared to say anything. Her heart pounded in her ears as she began to speak.
�But who are you?�

����������� The voice
entered the room and brought her racing mind to a halt. The distortion was gone
and the voice was all too clear now. �It�s been too long, Gwen. It�s going to
be nice to have you back.� Gwen began to shake as she realized who belonged to
that haunting voice: her former boyfriend and Master, Saul. 

����������� Gwen hadn�t
heard that voice in over ten years. He was the only Master she had ever truly
had. He had ruled her every move when he wanted to and she had welcomed his
authority. She had often missed those days, but she had moved on long ago after
they had broken up. She had left Saul for a new love interest that she was
still with now. What Gwen couldn�t understand was why Saul was doing this. Why
now? What made him want to kidnap her and bring her here, wherever here might
be? �Saul?� Gwen�s voice quavered as she started her question. �Why?�

����������� Saul
answered her with a smack across her blindfolded face. �It�s bad enough that
you can�t figure it out on your own. Now you�re forgetting the rules, too. No speaking without permission, slave.� With that, he ripped
her blindfold off with a jerk.

����������� Gwen tried
to open her eyes, but the lights were so bright they hurt. She squinted and
tried to look around the room and get her bearings. Another smack greeted her
check. �On your knees, slut! Assume the position. I
presume you can at least remember that
much.� 

Gwen scrambled to get down off the
bed and onto the floor. Disentangling herself from the sheet was a challenge
with her hands and ankles bound, but she moved as fast as she was able. Her
cheek still stung as she frantically tried to get down on her knees, head on
the floor at his feet and ass in the air. If there was anything Gwen did
remember it was her former boyfriend�s fondness for punishment. The last thing
she wanted to do was incur his wrath for moving too slow. 

�Better. I expect to see that kind
of enthusiasm in everything you do here, Gwen. The next time you hesitate,
there will be painful consequences.� A sharp slap to her ass reminded her of
another of his rules. 

�Yes, Sir,� she replied quickly,
but weakly. Gwen�s thoughts were still swirling around in her head. She
couldn�t understand how she came to be here. What was Saul playing at? Sure, he
was her master before, but it was a part time game they played, nothing like
what he was trying to enforce here. 

�I can�t hear you, slave. Where is
that enthusiasm?� Saul punctuated his response with another, stinging slap to
her ass. 

�Yes, Sir,� she replied louder. Her
voice still shook, but she hoped she made up for it with volume and sounded
enthusiastic.

�Getting better,� replied her
Master. �Unfortunately, it sounds like you are still a little confused. Let me
lay it out clear for you, dear. I�ve decided to formalize our relationship at
long last. You are mine now. Don�t worry about your old life-it�s
over now. Your boyfriend has received your Dear John letter, your boss
terminated you by letter after finding child pornography on your computer, and
your family and friends believes you are on an extended vacation in South America. So, as you can see, no one will be looking
for you any time soon.�

Gwen was in a daze. How could these
things be? She hadn�t done any of those things, but clearly he had. �Still with
me?� his voice interrupted her thoughts. �Good. Let�s keep going then. What we
had before was only a taste of what you are going to experience now. You are my
slave. You will do as you are told at all times. You will speak only when
spoken to. You will keep your eyes down at all times and will not dare to look
me or any of your masters in the eye. You are a slave. You will wear clothing
only if expressly told to do so. Otherwise, you will be naked at all times. You
will be bound at all times until I believe you can be trusted not to try and
run away. Running away will get you nowhere. Trust me when I say this-there is
nowhere to go. You will service me sexually and anyone else I designate and you
will do it with enthusiasm. If you displease me, you will be punished severely.
To make sure you understand this, you will begin your service here with your
first punishment. Let�s go.�

Saul grasped her upper arm roughly
and hauled her to her feet. �Come on, Slave. It�s time for your initiation.�

Chapter 2- The Initiation

Saul hauled Gwen�s slight 5�3�
frame roughly down the stairs past what looked like a living room. He opened a
door and shoved her into a dark stairway. �Down you go, slut. Try not to fall.�
Gwen tried to hold the railing with her cuffed hands, but she still felt
unbalanced. Her long golden hair was falling in her face as she struggled in
the dark. She stumbled as she reached the solid floor of what felt like a
finished basement. The lights were dim in the open room, but Gwen was horrified
by what she could make out.

The room was filled with all kinds
of restraints. A St Andrew�s cross stood in one corner;
it�s large X shape ominous in the vague lighting. Near it was a set of manacles
in the wall. She also saw several chains hanging down from the ceiling,
manacles set in the floor, tables with cuffs attached, and a standing wooden
framework with more restraints attached than she could identify. Along several
walls were more whips than she could count. She saw riding crops, a cat of nine
tails, leather straps, paddles, braided leather lashes and many more that she
couldn�t name. Gwen felt her face get wet with tears as her situation began to
dawn on her. She could hear Saul�s footsteps behind her.

�Keep moving, slave. Right over
there,� Saul said, pointing at the wooden framework. Gwen crossed the room and
walked toward the frightening framework with dread. She had seen these devices
before, but she and her former master had never used them. Sure, he had tied
her to the four poster bed as well as contorting her into hogties, but never
anything like this.

�Saul, I don�t understand,� she
began to turn toward Saul, the tears in her eyes clearly evident. Smack! The
sting on her cheek reminded her that she wasn�t supposed to speak without permission.


�I don�t remember inviting you to
speak, slave. And get one thing straight-you will call me Master from now on.
My name is not to be uttered by your unworthy tongue. Do you understand?�

�Yes, Sir,� Gwen responded weakly.
She didn�t understand, but knew better than to say that. She understood her
instruction, but not what was happening to her. She just couldn�t accept what
he was telling her and she certainly wasn�t ready to call him Master again so
soon. She resolved to fight this any way she could.

Smack! This time he didn�t smack
her face again. He smacked her right breast. Her 36DD breasts had an impressive
jiggle that was only helped by the smack. Gwen stumbled at the force of his
blow. �Yes, what?� Saul asked.

�Yes, SIR,� Gwen replied, putting more
force behind the Sir, trying to resist him. 

Smack! Her other breast felt the
sting of his blow. Gwen didn�t even have time to react before he gave her a
forceful shove toward the wooden framework. �Fine, slave. If you want to waste
your energy resisting, I�ll definitely accept that challenge. Let me show you
what happens when you don�t follow orders.�

With that, he yanked her hands
toward the top of the frame and cuffed her left hand to it. He then removed the
old cuffs and then cuffed her right hand to the other side of the frame. Her
arms were now stretched out in a Y shape and her feet were pulled slightly off
the floor. She could feel the tension in her arms already. Now that her arms
were secured in the framework, he uncuffed her ankles and attached them to the
lower corners of the frame. She was now spread eagle, her breasts, ass, and
pussy all wide open to his inspection. Gwen whimpered as Saul went about his
work, tightening the cuffs until she was pulled as tight as he could make it.
She had no room to move at all and even felt herself straining slightly to
breathe.

As Gwen watched, Saul walked over
to a wooden rack that displayed a variety of whips. He picked up several before
he settled on a substantial leather paddle. Saul walked around the frame
several times, admiring Gwen�s pleasing body, almost as if he was deciding
where to strike first. He ran his hands down her back seductively. Gwen
couldn�t help but feel a tingle as his hands moved down her spine and continued
down to her ass. He squeezed both her ass cheeks, gently pulling them apart to
expose her little rosebud. 

As Gwen tensed from his touch, she
could hear the wind as his first strike was aimed directly at her ass. SMACK!
He was not holding back at all and Gwen cried out at the sting. Saul followed
it up immediately with another strike to the other ass cheek. The first was
already turning red. Even as she cried out, Gwen was reminded of how much this
used to turn her on. A fire was starting deep inside as she could feel her body
betraying her. As Saul continued to paddle her ass thoroughly, her pussy began
juicing, betraying her lust. Her breath came in quick spurts and her tears
flowed freely now.

Saul stopped long enough to admire
the welts being raised on Gwen�s perfectly shaped ass. �I always did like that
shade of red. It looks good on you,� Saul laughed as he moved around in front
of Gwen. Her eyes were on the floor and her tear-stained face was puffy and
red. Saul lifted her chin to get a better look at the tears. Gwen squeezed her
eyes shut to avoid looking at him. Looking at him would�ve meant accepting what
was happening. �That�s right, slave. Keep your eyes down. Now learn the rest of
it.� 

Master Saul walked away, back
toward the wooden rack and exchanged the paddle for a braided leather lash. As
he returned, he grabbed her right nipple and twisted it. He took it in his
mouth and sucked on it until it became hard. He repeated the task with her
other nipple until they looked like a match pair, sticking out in the cold air
of the dungeon room. Saul pulled back his lash at that moment and struck her
tit sharply. An angry red line appeared on her breast where the lash had
fallen. Gwen cried out again and again as Saul cross-crossed her breasts with
strokes from the braided lash.

The lash left a trail of raised
welts even before Saul made sure to strike her nipples with the lash. Gwen
screamed in agony, �Please! Please stop! You can�t do this to me!� Gwen�s tears
were so thick she couldn�t see anything. She struggled desperately to move, to
get away, but the tightness of her bonds kept her almost motionless. �Please
stop Saul!�

�Not good enough, Slave.� 

The lashing continued on her
breasts, spreading to her arms and thighs. The pain just seemed to radiate from
her breasts outward to the rest of her body. The lash landed on her thighs, so
close to her pussy that she screamed again out of fear. She had welts on at
least 50% of her body now and he was going back over them with the lash,
causing even worse pain. She had never endured this level of punishment before.
She couldn�t take it-this wasn�t resisting, this was torture. 

�Please stop!� she begged between
screams, but the lashing continued. Saul worked around to her ass again,
covering the tender welts with new trails of pain. She was sure she must be
bleeding by now. �Please, Sir! Please stop!� As Saul paused long enough to
exchange the braided lash for a riding crop, Gwen began to realize that only
one thing was going to stop this lashing. 

The riding crop had a sharp tip.
Saul swung it in front of her a few times before bring it up between her legs,
striking her stimulated pussy with a sharp crack. �Aeiii! Please stop!� she
screamed again. �Please, Master!� Almost like a code word, the lashing stopped.


�Very good, slave,� Master Saul
looked at her beautifully abused body. �You finally figured out how to please
me. I expect you to remember it from now on. Make no mistake; if you step out
of line again you�ll get more of the same.� 

Gwen continued to cry, knowing that
he had won. She knew now that he was no longer the same man she knew before. He
took far more pleasure in causing her pain. He could clearly dish out far more
than she could take. In her mind, she resigned herself to the fate he had
selected for her, at least until she found a way to escape.

As Gwen tried to catch her breath
and order her thoughts, Saul began running his hands over her now bruised, red
body. His fingers traced the lines of pain left behind by the lashing. Gwen�s
cries increased again as the pain increased at his touch. His fingers continued
despite her cries, moving lower from her breasts down to her sex. His fingers
invaded her dripping pussy. �You still love it and you know it,� remarked
Master Saul. �This is the life you were meant for, slave. You might not want to
accept it, but this is what you were born to do, and you will fulfill that
destiny here with me. The sooner you accept that, the sooner you can enjoy it
like you should.�
