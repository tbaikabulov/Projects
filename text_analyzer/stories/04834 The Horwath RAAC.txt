The Horwath RAAC

(The Remedial Attitude Adjustment Center)

&nbsp;

Preface

&nbsp;

Arnold Meyer walked down the
hall to collect his newest subjects. Having been a trainer for the last ten
years, first at Bierdorf prison, and recently at Horwath, he had a tremendous amount of experience turning
the vilest female vermin into quality products. He had been given the worst of
the bunch, the ones that were labeled as incorrigible. His reputation for
breaking intractable female flesh to his will was well known. As such he was often
given the most difficult cases.

The Horwath Center had
been in operation for nearly five years before Meyer had arrived. In that time
they had processed many women, turning them into beasts of burden as well as
pets. The process of collection changed when Meyer arrived though. His
suggestions improved output so much that the Foreign Ministry actually began
exporting stock to neighboring countries. Wetting the appetite of the wealthy
aristocrats across the border caused a surge in demand. As the word spread,
more and more of the wealthy aristocrats demanded Horwath�s
services. As such, production had to be increased dramatically.

Meyer was an expert in his
field. He knew what made a woman tick. His skills were so great that he was
often filmed, his techniques being shown to prospective trainers. He was
awarded a Masters Degree for his thesis on the female psyche, which gave a
multi-path roadmap to the conversion process.

It was Meyer�s idea to create
a separate section for the most difficult cases. Instead of a simple training
facility, he actually enlisted surveillance teams. Their job was to comb the
streets for female lowlife. Young females who resided in the slums were their
primary targets. They would monitor their speech, their posture, and their activities.
The more aggressive the individual, the more likely they would need special
training.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The History of the World (circa 2034)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The United Nations was
established in the mid-twentieth century to bring countries closer together.
One crisis after another, from the Cuban Missile Crisis, to the many troubles
in the mid-east had been dealt with in a judicious manner. Countries worked
together to avoid the human tragedy of a world wide war. And most of the time,
it worked!

In the year 2009 the balance
of power changed, and not for the better. With continued endorsement from the
United Nations and assistance from French and Russian governments, Iran, who
had been arguing that her nuclear power plants were for peaceful use, began
secretly purifying plutonium into weapons grade material. The manufacturing
scale was quite small, perhaps only a few pounds a month. But within a year,
with imports from Korea, they
now had nearly a ton of weapons grade material. And this was not a good thing.

The plan was called Holy
Vengeance. It was frighteningly simple. Simply put, small lead cased packages
would be slipped into the United
  States, Canada, and Great
  Britain. Teams would store the items
in nondescript apartments and await the shipment of other materials. The shipments
would be done slowly, patiently. Eventually, Ten U.S. Cities including Washington D.C., New
  York, Los
  Angeles, Detroit, and Chicago had
at least one and perhaps as many as four ten kiloton bombs in place. Some bombs
were made substantially larger because of the target they were meant for. Where
possible the bombs were assembled in high rise buildings to increase the effect
of the blast.

On November 25, 2011 the
plan was ready for execution. The Iranian president, is the ultimate act of treachery
and martyrdom, went to the United Nations to address the assembly personally.
He even invited the President of the United
  States to attend as an offering of
friendship between two nations who had found themselves at odds with each other
for the last 40 years. However the president refused, saying that he could not
meet with him for to do so was to offer his endorsement of the human injustice
that Islamic Fundamentalism imposed on the Iranian people.

On the afternoon of that day,
one day prior to the start of the busy Christmas shopping season, the Iranian
president spoke.

�People of the world hear me!�
he said in his native tongue as countless interpreters began converting not
only his words but his mood into words that their dignitaries could understand.

�People of the world. For
years the Iranian people have been placed under the thumbs of the western
cultures of the world. We have been threatened by the existence of the Zionist regime
and we have endured. That will not continue beyond this glorious day.

�As I speak your cities burn.
As I speak your capitals crumble. Allah be praised for all of Islam for we
shall never be your slaves again!�

Around the world men watched
CNN and other satellite stations, waiting for the words that would tell them to
start the explosive sequence. First New
  York, with four of the larger fifty kiloton
bombs, followed by Washington, Dallas, and Chicago were nearly obliterated by
these horrendous blasts. London, Paris, and Berlin
ceased to exist. And as the Israelis watched Tel Aviv disappeared under a
mushroom cloud.

The president and several high
level members of Congress watched CNN in stunned silence as nearly half a
billion people simply vanished, as ten million New Yorkers died instantly, as
the world�s commerce and energy pipelines were ravaged and destroyed.

The response was swift. It was
known as operation blanket approach. It took nearly two weeks to put all the
pieces into place. There would be no silly announcements or speeches. It would
simply be done. Simply put, it would be genocide. The president ordered a full
scale nuclear strike against every population center in Syria, Iran, and North
  Korea. And while the Iranian bombs
were crude and inefficient, there was nothing crude or inefficient about the
weapons of the U.S.
military.

Fighting continues for several
years while the world suffered. As strange as it may sound the energy crisis
that one would have expected to develop never did. After the purge of Iran, the
remaining Arab countries wanted no part in anything that might upset the
American or European governments. In fact, the president stated quite clearly
that any attempt to reduce oil production would be considered an act of war and
would be dealt with swiftly and decisively. And with the lack of large cities
to use up resources, the demand was reduced. It stayed that way for a few years
until the world recovered. 

Yet terrorism did invade the United
  States and Europe.
Retaliations on a much smaller scale continued. Small bombs were detonated
inside wedding chapels in Las Vegas.
Convention centers exploded in Tampa. College
dorms were reduced to rubble. And the fight went on.

By the end of 2012 the world
had recovered in one form or another enough to function. However the United
  States was not doing well. The
European economy hadn�t suffered as much as the US
because their ports were not subject to the attacks that the US�s
ports were. The blow of losing New
  York as a port as well as Los
  Angeles, hit hard. There were
shortages of clothing, food, and countless other necessities. 

People began to immigrate to
the Mideast.
Before long Iran and Syria were defacto provinces of the United States simply because the
majority of the population was now American. Europe was
the recipient of nearly ten million immigrants. And that was when the anti-Euro-American
movement started.

As more and more people moved
from the ravaged US to Europe,
cities and town grew at an alarming pace. By the end of 2013 towns and villages
meant for ten thousand had grown to ten times that size. The simple shops and
stores disappeared as the American shopping centers took over. Walmart had invaded Europe.

This and other changes were
looked on with disfavor by the European communities. Americans were controlling
the town councils. Americans were teaching in their schools. Americans were
running their lives. There had to be a way to either send them home or at least
get them out of their hair.

Nowhere was the resentment as
great as in the Baltic States. With
so many Americans living in the area it was impossible for these small towns to
maintain their identity. Shop owners had to learn English. The fear existed
that soon their own cherished dialects would be nothing more than forgotten
memories.

Borders blurred as Americans
removed border crossings, turning Eastern Europe into
a single country with governors heading the provinces rather than traditional
monarchs and presidents. There were only a few holdouts, but they were
dwindling. Most ceded to the new European Conglomeration of States, or ECS. But
some resisted.

One of note was Horwathia, a province approximately two hundred miles
square. Its population, mostly of Hungarian and Yugoslavian ancestry, numbered
fifteen million. When the Americans moved in that population doubled. 

The government would have
ceded to the ECS if it were not for the efforts of Adolfo Horwath,
The Grand Duke of Horwathia. Having led the revolt
that allowed his country to split from the masses he used his political
connections to keep his country free of the yoke of the ECS. 

As a generation passed there
grew a movement within certain circles to kick out the invaders. They feared
that Americans would corrupt their cherished bloodlines, their heritage.
Adolfo�s successor, Sigmund Horwath was very much in
favor of some sort of plan to purge the vermin from their land. However, a
certain Horwathian gentleman who had spent much time
in America and
studied their culture suggested a somewhat different approach. Their country
was now suffering from the worldwide energy crisis. Transportation was now
either by bicycle, boat, or mass transit. Many clamored for some other means.
Horses were considered but most of Europe was already
using them to supplement their own mass transit systems. With their high demand
the cost of these animals skyrocketed into the tens of thousands. And the
narrow streets of the major cities simply wouldn�t work well with the stubborn
beasts anyway.

Arnold Meyer offered a
solution that was both ingenious and devious. The population would be sorted
out into Europeans and Euro-Americans. The government would arrest American
females and retrain them for domestic service or transportation. When he
mentioned transportation to the Prime Minister and described his perceived
ideas to save energy the minister seemed intrigued. The idea of harnessing
beautiful women and making them pull carriages was interesting.

The Prime Minister noted a
problem. �There are too many women for this to depopulate the Americans. What
else can you think of?� he asked.

�I already have it worked out.
Pets!� he replied.

�Pets?�

�Yes. We turn the remainder
into pets for our populace. We�ll train them for oral sex. It might even be
possible to export them and make a handsome profit from them. We�ll have to
discuss that with the bordering countries. Their population is just as anxious
for a solution to the problem as we are.�

�Then you are my new
architect. You will manage the development of the training facilities. You will
bring in the appropriate people.�

�As you wish, sir.�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;








Chapter 1

&nbsp;

Welcome
to the RAAC

&nbsp;

Meyer
entered the main office at the RAAC at 5 a.m. His six foot, ten inch frame towered above the secretary�s desk. His
white pants and black shirt made him look all that much more handsome. And, of
course, like all trainers in the RAAC, he wore an expensive Stetson.

Kerry
Meyer, his slightly plump sister, managed his schedule. She beamed when he
walked into the room. �You�re early,� she said.

�I
wanted to get an early start. We just shipped out the last two girls yesterday.
Did you arrange for another group yet?� he asked.

�I
have two blondes coming in this morning.�

�I�ll
take them myself. What did the team find out?�

�Subject
1, Cleo Palmer, tall, stubborn as a mule. Psych profile says she�ll require max
care.

�Subject
2, Dina Lohan, short girl, only five feet tall. Psych
profile says she�s stubborn but will break easily with isolation treatment.�

�Put
them in the black rooms. We�ll start the stewing process right away so they�ll
be more amenable in a day or two. I�ll handle the training personally.�

�I�ll
take care of the details,� Kerry said.

&nbsp;

Cleo Palmer:

&nbsp;

�Let
me go, you assholes!� I screamed as they pulled me into the van in handcuffs
and leg irons. �You can�t do this. I didn�t do anything to deserve this!� I
cried.

But
my efforts were futile. Two goons put me into a waiting seat in the back of the
van and strapped me in. I got a little satisfaction though, kicking one of them
in the balls and sending him to the ground. I expected retaliation but none
came. They just finished their work and hauled me away.

A
half hour later another girl, who looked even more frightened than me, was put
into the opposite seat. The men said not one word. They just left us bound and
hauled us away.

�What�s
going on?� she asked, her voice trembling.

�I
don�t know. They just told me I was under arrest for treason. Before I knew it
I was handcuffed and hobbled.�

�They
did the same thing with me. What�s going to happen to us?�

�I
don�t know but I won�t go down without a fight. Nobody screws with Cleo
Palmer!� I said boldly.

�Is
that your name? Mine�s Dina, Dina Lohan.�

�Can
you think of anything you�ve done to deserve this?�

�No,
you?�

�Well,
I protested the war last year. It was a three day rally so I decided to run
down to the capitol and see what the fuss was about. I never really got
involved though. Too many nuts complaining about the �Secret Police�. I should
have listened to them!�

�You
don�t think they saw you in the crowd and decided to target you, do you?�

�The
rally was over eight months ago. If the state didn�t like what I was doing, why
would they wait? No, this is something else.�

�I�m
scared!�

�You
have to be tough. Stand up to these bastards. Otherwise you�ll lose yourself to
them. Don�t let them break you!�

�You�re
right,� Dina said boldly. �But I�m still scared.

&nbsp;

The
drive lasted six hours. During that time we endured endless bumps and turns.
Our butts bounced on the hard seats and we groaned and grunted more as the
daylight faded. A small skylight was our only source of light. When day faded
to night we were essentially in complete darkness. That�s when Dina got really
scared.

�Are
you still there?� she cried from across the container.

�Where
would I go? You�re not afraid of the dark, are you?� I joked, knowing full well
I was just as frightened as her.

�I
don�t like this!�

�Me
neither. I don�t think anything bad will happen to us. They�re probably just
taking us to a remote location for questioning. Anyway, we can�t do anything
about it while we�re bound in these cuffs.�

�Yea,
I guess you�re right. I don�t think they�ll bother us until the truck stops,�
Dina said, her fear obvious in her voice.

�Just
relax. Just do what they say but don�t let them turn you into a lump of flesh.�

�OK,�
she replied.

&nbsp;

As
we were talking, the truck stopped. I heard men and women conversing. We backed
up and hit something, probably a dock. The light from the opening door blinded
us. In the entrance stood a plump woman dressed in jeans and a white tee-shirt.
She even wore a black cowboy hat! With her hands on her hips her silhouette
looked like something out of a Western movie. For a second I almost believed
the cavalry had arrived. But she wasn�t here to rescue us. Unfortunately she
had something else in mind.

Two
teams of three males attended each of us. The men were tall and muscular. They
said not one word as they released us from the seats. As we exited the van I
noticed that we were being taken down a cement walled corridor. On each side
were heavy iron doors. We walked for nearly fifty yards before coming to our
rooms where we were separated and put in rooms across from each other. Dina
called out my name as she was pushed through the door. I turned my head and
watched the door close behind her. Two goons prodded me through my own door and
closed it behind me.

�Look
you idiots,� I said. �This is all a mistake!�

�Don�t
call my men idiots,� the woman said.

�The
bitch speaks!� I mocked.

�Perhaps
a little attitude adjustment might be in order,� she said.

�You
could use it!�

�I�m
going to enjoy this immensely,� she replied smiling.

�Do
your worst!� I yelled at her.

�I surely
will. I always do. Now, I�ll leave you to my faithful attendants. Try not to
hurt them too much,� she said sardonically. 

I
had only met her a few minutes ago and already I was thinking of ways to kill
her slowly. Slow roasting over hot coals seemed like a good idea. Then I
thought, �If I can think of it, so can they. Maybe I�d better play along.�

The
tallest one spoke. �I�m going to remove your bonds. If you fight us you�ll only
get hurt. The door behind us is locked and the room is only six feet square.
You can�t get away. Understand?�

�Yes,�
I replied. �I�m getting tired of this jewelry. Have anything in gold or
platinum?� I joked.

The
bonds were removed and I was shoved into the next room. Its door was made of
six inches of iron. Huge rivets lined the rim of the door and there was no
handle on the inside. �You don�t expect me to go in there?� I asked.

�In,�
he said sternly. His tone frightened me so much that I was completely cowed. I
walked into the dark room and watched the thin sliver of light on the wall
disappear. �Hey, someone forgot to turn on the light,� I yelled. But no one
answered. �Come on, guys!� I yelled. �I can�t see where I�m going!�

I
knew the size of the room was roughly twenty feet square. I had seen a glimpse
of the room before the door closed. I also knew that there was a small pad of
carpet somewhere in front of me. I slowly inched my way toward it. I misjudged
the distance and tripped on the edge. �Well, I found it.� I said out loud.

�Is
someone going to tell me why I�m here? Hey, you idiots! Say something!� I
screamed at the top of my lungs. But there was nothing. Not a sound was heard.
Not a photon of light was visible. I was completely in the dark.

&nbsp;

Dina:

&nbsp;

I
was so scared! They took off the bonds and shoved me into the room. When the
door closed I just froze. I wrapped my arms around myself and shook like a
leaf, crying. �Please,� I whimpered.

&nbsp;

Meyer:

&nbsp;

�Profile
on this one was way off,� I said to my sister. �She�s not the tough type at
all, is she?�

�Maybe
they thought she�d resist if she were sent through the standard training. The
psych team is pretty good about these things.�

�I
suppose. They did warn me about that pony last year. What was her name?�

�The
tall redhead?�

�Yea,�
I replied.

�Doris, or something like that. You sent her to the other side and she stepped
out of bounds three times before they sent her back here. She spent three
months total on her knees as a puppy. If I remember correctly that�s the third
time you tried to second guess them. You�re too soft.�

�You�re
a good sister,� I said. �I should listen to you more.�

Kerry
patted me on the shoulder as she peered at the monitor. The low light camera
showed the new girl crawling toward the carpet. 

�Do
you want me to handle her? You can take care of little Miss Bigmouth. I got
emotional with her.�

�Sure,�
I said. �I like challenges.�

�Don�t
we all!�

&nbsp;

Kerry:

&nbsp;

�Honey,
can you hear me?� I asked softly.

�Who�s
there?� she said. �I can�t see anything.�

�Let
me put on the light,� I said. I flipped a switch and a small red light came on
in the middle of the carpet. �Stay on the carpet unless I tell you otherwise.
OK?�

�OK,�
she replied. I had done this many times before and she was responding very
well. I usually had to let them stew for a couple hours before they�d be
cooperative. This one would train quickly.

�Do
you need to use the bathroom?� I asked.

�Yes,
please.�

I
flipped another switch and a light in the corner came on. �See the toilet? It�s
in the cage. Climb in the cage and close the door. You can�t lift the lid of
the toilet unless the door is closed. When you�re done, close the lid to unlock
the cage. Understand?�

�Yes.
Why did you put the toilet in a cage?� she asked.

�I
don�t know,� I replied. �The room was built before I started working here. You
better hurry. We don�t have all day.�

The
girl crawled over to the cage and climbed in. �Watch your head,� I warned. The
roof of the wire cage was only 4 feet high. �You�ll have to slam the door shut
with authority.�

The
seat of the toilet was intentionally low to force her to spread her knees when
she sat. Even though she was in the dark, the cameras showed her body as if it
were daylight. She was quite small and very pretty. She�d make a very nice pet
for someone.

She
finished her business and closed the lid. �Sit on the lid to lock it,� I told
her. When she did so the door sprung open. �Head back to the carpet.�

&nbsp;

Meyer:

&nbsp;

The
light over the cage was out now and the only light in the room glowed through
the small lens in the center of the carpet. �Feel better?� I asked.

�Go
to Hell!�

�Yes
ma�am, I�m on my way. Want to share the ride?�

�That�s
all I need, a comedian torturer! So what do you want me to do now?�

�Nothing.�

�Huh?�

�What
I want isn�t important now. It�s what you want that is important.�

�Are
you trying to play some sort of game?�

�Yes,
as a matter of fact, I am.�

�Well,
I�m not playing,� she said as she plopped herself on the carpet right in front
of the red bulb. �I think I�ll just sit here and contemplate my navel.�

�Suit
yourself. Just yell if you need anything.� And suddenly she found herself in
complete darkness again.

&nbsp;

Cleo;

&nbsp;

It
could have been ten minutes or ten hours. I had no way to tell in the inky
blackness of the room. He was trying to break me. I knew it. I knew psychology.
I had studied the subject in high school. I saw the ancient study at Stanford
in the U.S. I even looked up the Stockholm syndrome on the
internet. I swore to myself that I wouldn�t break. But somehow I knew I would.

Anyway,
after several moments I became fidgety. I missed the dim glow of the red light.
I could feel around the carpet. I could feel the center where the lens was. It
was on fast. I felt small holes where the screws were. I didn�t think I could
do anything with it anyway so I left it alone. I didn�t have any tools to get
at the screws anyway.

After
a while I started yelling at them. �Can I have some water?� I asked. My voice
betrayed my fear. �Please?�

There
was no answer for a number of minutes. Then I noticed a red glow in the room.
The light was coming from the wall behind me. There was an open panel under the
light. The back side of it was rounded and it rotated under my touch. I walked
over to it pushed it around a few times. �It�s empty!�

�Then
fill it,� the man�s voice came from the darkness.

�With
what?�

�Anything.�

�I
don�t have anything! What do you expect me to put in it?�

But
he didn�t answer. The light suddenly went out. I crawled back to the carpet. �Dammit!� I yelled.

&nbsp;

Dina:

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

She
told me that I should call her when I needed anything. She put me in darkness
again and I started crying. I just sat on the carpet and cried. �Why are you
doing this to me?� I cried. But nobody ever answered that question. They didn�t
want me to know.

I
was suddenly hungry and thirsty. I hadn�t eaten in six hours by my best
estimate. �Can I have something to eat?� I asked loudly.

A
few minutes later a red light came on. �See the turntable, Honey?� the woman
asked.

�Yes,�
I replied.

�Put
something in there and we�ll give you some food.�

�I
don�t have anything. You took it all away from me.�

�Think
of something. When you do, just call out. We�ll turn the light on again when
you�re ready.�

�But
I don�t have anything!� I cried.

I
sat down on the carpet and kicked off my shoes. That�s when the brainstorm hit
me. I�ll give you my shoes!� I yelled. �Will that work?�

The
red light over the niche came on. �Well,� I said to myself. 

I
walked over and inserted my shoes into the turntable. �Turn the unit clockwise
until it won�t turn any further,� the woman said. Once I had done so another
light came on next to the first. A sliding door opened and revealed a paper
plate with a cheese sandwich and a cup of water. I practically swallowed the
sandwich whole. The water was not nearly enough to satisfy me though. �Can I
have more water?� I asked.

At
that point the red light came on over the turntable and I saw it had rotated
back, revealing a now empty shelf. Now I knew the game. �So you want me to
strip.�

&nbsp;

A
pair of earrings earned me another glass of water. I was satisfied for the
moment and went back to the carpet to sit and wait. �What happens when I run
out of clothes?� I wondered. Well, at least they left the little light on this
time. It was little comfort but it was something. I just couldn�t figure out
what they wanted from me.

Hours
passed. I assumed hours passed but I had no way of telling. I crawled over to
the area where the toilet was but the door wouldn�t lock. �It�s broke,� I
yelled. �I need to use the can!�

�You
need to ask first,� the woman said. �Next time ask before trying.�

�Yes,
ma�am. I�m sorry. May I please use the bathroom?�

�Certainly,�
she replied. 

The
light came on over the cage and I repeated my little animal act.

&nbsp;

Meyer:

&nbsp;

We
had her down to her underwear now. She kept asking for food. I kept sending foods
that wouldn�t fill her up but would be tempting. I sent her low fiber, high
fat, items such as cheese cake, �clairs, and doughnuts. She thought it was
great. But the empty feeling in her belly returned quickly because the food
wasn�t filling. The high sugar content made her thirsty. So she wanted water.
No problem, one more piece of clothing ended up in the coffer. Now she only had
her panties and her bra.

The
sugar gave her a high and kept her active and awake. That played on her mind
too. She wanted to do something but she couldn�t. She became anxious,
especially when I put her in total darkness. 

It
had been only thirty minutes since her last request, a glass of water. �I can�t
keep doing this,� she said.

�Then
don�t. Just sit there. You�ve eaten quite a bit over the past hour.�

�OK.
Why are you doing this?� she asked.

�I
honestly don�t know! It�s an addiction I suppose.�

�Getting
women to strip for you with these kinky games?�

�Do
you think it�s kinky? Interesting. If I were in your shoes I wouldn�t have used
that adjective. I�d call it sick or possibly depraved. I�d never use the work
kinky. It almost sounds as if you enjoy this little game.�

�Go
to Hell!�

�We�ve
had that discussion before.�

The
light went out as I flipped the switch. She needed to stew a while longer. The
last two pieces were always the toughest to remove.

&nbsp;

Kerry:

&nbsp;

She
was naked. �Finally,� I said to myself as I watched her lick her fingers. She
had traded her bra for two �clairs. Her bra went in the bin for a large glass
of water. I guess she figured she was going to eventually be naked anyway so
she should enjoy the experience. �May I use the bathroom?� she asked.

I
turned the light over the cage on and let her do her thing. When she came out
she suddenly realized that she didn�t have anything more to trade. �OK, now I�m
naked. How do I get food? Is the game over?�

�Hardly
dear. Get some sleep. We�ll talk in the morning.�

&nbsp;

I
turned out the light and observed her sleeping on the carpet. She slept on her
side, or at least tried to. Most girls had problems sleeping on a flat carpet.
There wasn�t much padding under the rug either. It made for a very hard
sleeping surface. I�m sure she hated it.

I
left a technician to monitor her activities through the night while I walked
over to my brother�s control station and compared notes. His girl had finally
stripped as well and was lying in the dark trying to get some rest. I was
surprised of his account of her session. She had some rough edges but he had
handled them expertly. He had her under perfect control. He�d have her prepared
for pony duty in no time at all.

Chapter 2

The Heeling Begins

Meyer:

&nbsp;

The following morning I compared
notes with Kerry. Both girls were at roughly the same stage of their training.
My subject needed a little time to adjust her attitude. I had detected a lot of
rage in her tone of voice. Two days in darkness usually quelled this behavior.
I�d let one of my assistants keep her company and make sure her needs were met.

Kerry�s girl seemed to be quite
docile. She was actually ready to move on to her dressed stage. I hadn�t done a
puppy in three months so I convinced my sister to step aside and let me handle
things for the day. She�d have fun later with her, I was sure.

&nbsp;

�Dina? Are you awake yet?� I
asked.

�Yes,� she replied. �Who are
you?�

�I�m just another trainer. Are
you hungry? Do you need a drink?�

�I don�t have anything left to
trade,� she said.

�That�s OK. This meal is on the
house. Go to the cubicle. There are two egg sandwiches and a cup of orange
juice. Take your time. There�s no need to rush,� I said in a calm and relaxed
voice.

I allowed her to eat her meal.
She ate quickly but I didn�t protest. She finished the meal quickly then
returned to the carpet as if it were her security blanket. Her walk was awkward
due to the darkness but she was no longer covering herself. She must be getting
used to the nudity for she surely knew we were watching her.

I turned on the light over the
cage and let her use the toilet. She obviously was used to the routine by now.
When she was done she expertly plopped her butt on the lid and slammed it
closed. Automatically the door opened. She again returned to the center of the
room.

�How do you feel?� I asked.

�I�m really scared,� she replied
with a trembling voice. �Please don�t hurt me.�

�Dina, understand that there
will be some things we�ll do to you that are going to hurt a little. But we�re
not going to do anything to you that would cause you to scream or suffer for
long periods of time. Most of your discomfort will be due to confinement.�

�What do you mean by that? What
sort of confinement?�

�We�ll cross that bridge in a
little while.�

�So what happens now?�

�Would you like to get out of
that room?�

�Yes, Sir. I really don�t like
the dark.�

�I can understand that. Being in
a dark room for as long as you have must be horrible. I�ll tell you what I�ll
do. I�ll send in some clothes. Once you�re fully dressed I�ll let you out.
Sound like a deal?�

�OK.�

�There�s one catch though. You
have to put on everything I send in to you.�

�What�s so horrible about that?
Are you going to make me dress like a hooker or something like that?�

�No, but some of the items I�m
going to make you wear will frighten you.�

�How?� she asked with anxiety
plainly showing in her voice.

�I�m going to make you wear a collar
and a leather mask. Do you think you could wear them?�

�You mean like a bandit�s mask?
Like the Lone Ranger?�

�No. This is a full hood that
will enclose your head.�

�Why do you want me to wear
that?�

�We make all our girls wear
them. It makes training go faster.�

�I don�t understand.�

�You will in time, Dear. If you
want to be taken out of the room you�ll have to wear it.�

She stared at the ceiling for a
moment trying to decide if it were better to have her head enclosed in leather
or stay naked in the darkness. �OK. I�ll do whatever you say.�

I pressed a button on the
console and brought up the lights. I kept the illumination low because she had
been in darkness for at least sixteen hours. I didn�t want her to be
uncomfortable. Another button allowed a bench to extend from the wall. �Look at
the wall to the right of the bench,� I directed her. There�s a niche there with
some items for you to wear. Take everything out and lay it on the floor near
the bench. OK?�

�Yes sir,� she replied.

I watched as she took each item
out of the recess in the wall. There was quite an assortment. The items
included boots, a leather bodice, gloves, a collar, a leather hood, and a
rubber ball. She looked strangely at the rubber ball, not knowing what it was
for.

Once everything was out of the
cubicle I told her to put on the bodice. It was essentially a front-buckle
corset with shoulder straps. She didn�t have much problem wrapping it around
her waist and settling it on her abdomen. She was obviously disturbed that her
nipples would not slip under the cups. I was impressed how well her breasts sat
up though. The item fit reasonably well. It wasn�t a custom corset though. We�d
have to wait a few weeks for that to arrive.

�OK, very nice. Now put on the
collar. The buckle goes in the back. Be careful with your hair. Don�t get it
caught.�

She must have become a little
more comfortable since she put on the corset because she didn�t have any
problem with the collar. It fit tight against her throat, just like it was
supposed to. The red leather against her pale skin was amazing to look at.

�Use the bench to put the boots
on. The zippers go on the inseam. Watch your step when you put them on. They
have pointed toes and eight inch heels. If you want to try and stand in them,
please be careful.�

�How am I supposed to walk in
these?� she said loudly.

�You aren�t. You�re expected to
crawl.�

Her eyes opened wide for a
moment. Then she shrugged her shoulders and put the kinky footwear on. She did
stand up. �My God!� she said before nearly losing her balance. She decided it was
better to get on her knees. �I�ve never worn heels like this.�

�Few women have. OK. The only
things left are the hood and the gloves. The hood is next. Whenever you�re
ready��

She looked at the supple
leather. It looked small for her head. I thought she was going to protest but
instead she put it on her head and adjusted it so she could see out the eye
holes. �Pull the zipper down all the way. The back edges are elastic so it will
fit nice and tight to your skin.�

As I watched her face seemed to to emerge from the black leather. First her nose and then
her cheeks formed. Finally her chin and jaw formed out of the black patent
leather. �That wasn�t so bad. Was it?� I offered.

�I don�t� like it,� she said.
�Can I please take it off?�

�I�m afraid not. But you�re
almost done. Let me help you with the gloves. I�ll be right in.�

I brought the lights up full and
unlocked the iron door. I found her kneeling next to the remaining items. She
silently faced me, the zipper across her lips shining in the florescent lights.
�Are you OK?� I asked as I dropped to one knee.

She nodded silently. �I�m OK.
What happens now?�

�I need to put these gloves on
you.�

�I can put them on,� she said as
she grabbed one and looked at the leather tube carefully. �These don�t have any
fingers,� she said suddenly. �They�re mittens!�

�I know. Let�s get them on.�

�Whatever,� she said resignedly
as she held out her right arm.

The glove went well past her
elbow. The fingers slipped into padded slots inside the mitten. This allowed
her some movement in her fingers but prevented them from being used otherwise.
She just sat on her heels as I pulled the zipper up to her shoulder. She didn�t
resist as I put the other glove on her. Now she was helpless.

�Put your hands on the floor in
front of you,� I ordered.

When she did as I asked she
looked like a sitting dog. �Good girl,� I said. �Now hold still. Let me check
everything.�

I slid over to her right and
grabbed the red ball. The hood�s zipper wasn�t all the way down. I gave it a
little tug and the last bit of slack was pulled out of the hood. She grunted.
The boots and the corset looked good. She had buckled the corset tight and the
zippers on both boots were at their limits. 

�Are you OK?� I asked.

�Please don�t hurt me,� she
cried.

�I�m not going to hurt you. OK?
I just need to do one more thing,� I said as I grabbed the zipper running
across her mouth. With the zipper open I brought the red ball to her lips.

�What�s that for?� she asked.

�It goes in your mouth.�

�What?�

�I can�t let you speak to the
other girls. It�s not allowed. I have to put this in your mouth. Now open
wide.�

�No, please!� she cried.

�You want to leave the room,
right?�

�Yes. But you don�t need to do
that. I�ll be quiet. I won�t say a word. I promise.�

�I know you won�t. But I don�t
have any choice. You have to hold the ball in your mouth. I�m sorry. Now come
on. You promised to do as you were told.�

�Oh,� she whimpered as she
opened her mouth wide.

The ball slipped between her
teeth with some difficulty. It was shiny but somewhat soft. It would fill her
mouth cavity but compress with a fair amount of pressure. She wouldn�t have any
problem closing her mouth. I ordered her to close her mouth firmly and bite
down. When she did I closed the zipper. The hood held her jaw almost fully
closed at that point. She was incapable of speech.

I next took out a leash. This
wasn�t your ordinary leash. It had an electrical cable attached to it. Once I
clipped it to the back of her collar I had an effective shocking device which I
was certain she would need. The incentive of the shock collar was needed for
the most difficult girls. I thought that while she was cooperative at this time
that later she�d freeze due to gross fear. The collar would get her moving
again.

I demonstrated the collar on
her. �Mmmmpphhh!� she screamed through her gag.

�I want you to obey me now. If
you don�t, that will be your reward. Now, get on all fours and follow me behind
my left foot. When we stop, sit on your butt and keep your hands on the floor.�
I jabbed the shock button again and heard her moan once more.

�Heel!� I commanded of our
newest puppy. I think she suddenly realized her new role because I heard her
whimpering as we started to walk out of the room. It was all part of the
process so I let her cry. As long as she learned to obey it didn�t matter
whether she cried, laughed, or barked like a dog. As long as she followed my
orders she would progress as expected.

�I ran into Kerry in the hall. �She�s adorable.
Are you taking her down to the kennel right away or did you get lucky with the
prep room guys?�

�I couldn�t get an appointment
till this afternoon. She�ll have to sit in her cage till then. Shouldn�t be a
problem,� I said as I noticed her still on all fours. I punched the button to
give her a quick jolt. �Sit!� I said sternly. She immediately dropped to her
haunches.

�The crew�s been busy. I heard
that the B-team brought in four bitches yesterday too. C, D, and E teams
brought in six each. The staff is getting overwhelmed.�

�I know. We�re getting ten new
trainers tomorrow. The export business is booming from what I heard. I�m glad
they�re giving us the personnel. We�ve been asking for them for months. Anyway,
I want to check on the pony. Would you get her checked in?�

�Sure,� Kerry said as she took
the leash. �Heel!� she commanded. I watched them walk away. She would make an
excellent puppy for someone.

�

Dina:

&nbsp;

What were they going to do with
me? They were treating me like a dog! My God! Now that woman had my leash. I
have a leash. I trusted that guy. He said he wasn�t going to hurt me. Instead
he connected the leash to my collar and sent a horrible shock into my neck. It
hurt! Please, why did this happen to me?

�Heel,� she said, jabbing me
with a short shock. She really was going to treat me like a dog. I had no
alternative except to obey. I got off my butt and got behind her left foot. She
led me down the hall until we reached a glass partition. As I watched from
below the woman showed an ID card and was allowed to pass, dragging me along.

�You have to learn to sit when
we stop,� she said without looking at me. I had no ability to reply with my
mouth stuffed with this rubber ball. I was grateful that the ball wasn�t firm.
It squashed easily in my mouth. But it was big and filled the entire cavity. I
had absolutely no ability to make legible sounds. All I could do was grunt.

We walked down another corridor
and finally came to one last security station. When we stopped, I sat like a
dog. I hated it. �Good girl,� she said as she presented her security pass to
the guard. When the door opened we found ourselves outside in a grassy area.
�This way,� she said.

The sight I beheld in front of
me was something I could never imagine in my wildest nightmares. For as far as
the eye could see there were women marching along concrete paths. Each girl had
her arms bound behind her. They all wore high heeled boots and kinky outfit.
They all looked like horses. They even had tails and bridles. 

I watched the girls trot slowly
around the paths. They lifted their knees high. What stunned me was the fact
that there wasn�t anyone around them. It was as if they were doing it of their
own volition. But I knew that wasn�t the case. Something just told me that they
were not doing this voluntarily.

We eventually made it to the
other side of the compound. We began running into other crawling girls. They
too crawled behind their trainer. Some girls crawled without a leash attached,
obediently following the person in obvious control of them. It made me wonder
why they would do so willingly. I guessed they were so cowed from being
tortured that they had given up hope. The outfits didn�t lend themselves to
moving very quickly either.

It suddenly realized that the
crawling girls were all wearing tails. It dawned on me that since they had me
in a similar outfit that they�d make me wear one soon too. I figured they had
some sort of ass plug with hair on it. But then I noticed something strange
about their tails. Some were actually wagging them. No, it wasn�t from the
motion of their asses. The movement was independent of the rest of their body.
They actually had grown tails! And soon I�d have one just like it. I was going
to become a dog!

&nbsp;








Chapter 3

A Bit of Leather

&nbsp;

Kerry:

&nbsp;

Our newest pony had been stewing for two days now. We gave
her simple cheese sandwiches, some bread pudding, and water. After two days in
complete darkness and total nudity she was softening. I�m sure she was tiring
of our game.

I supervised her training during the next two days. Arnie
had some business at the Capitol so he left me in charge. He�d be back today. 

I kept him up to date by phone while he was away. Our new
pet was safely in her cage. �The original
visit had to be cancelled due to the large influx of bitches. The backlog at
the vet�s office was exceptionally long. It was very tough to get her an
appointment but I did get her scheduled for early tomorrow. In the meantime she
was going to be fed and put in a dog run to let her stretch her legs and get
used to the idea of crawling around. She was pretty scared but I had seen many
girls pass through the same process before. She wasn�t exhibiting any behavior
that we�d consider unusual.

She was a very cute puppy. I had worked the kennel for two
years before moving to the HAAC. I had a good friend there who happened to be a
supervisor. Joan Alder gave me permission to take on some of her training
personally. I was looking forward to it.

I took a more careful look at the puppy�s records, her
pedigree as we called it. She had lived in the poorest section of town working
various small shops and restaurants. She never had a job making very much
money. She had no children. She had a boyfriend. The surveillance reports
indicated that they argued a lot. According to the reports she often initiated
the arguments. That could indicate trouble down the road once she became
accustomed to her new role. That attitude problem might emerge then. Well, it�s
not like I haven�t see that before.

&nbsp;

Checking in on our pony she was sitting on the carpet this
morning waiting for her next meal. We had the little carpet light on. She
seemed to be getting comfortable with the darkness. Well, I didn�t want her to
be comfortable. So I dropped the temperature to 68 degrees. In an hour or two
she�d be complaining about the cold. It would give her incentive to put on our
special outfit.

It didn�t take long before she started complaining. �Hey,
it�s cold. Did someone turn off the heat?� she asked as she curled up into a
fetal position. �Please! I�m naked. It�s cold!� she yelled.

I let her sit without an answer. �Let her shiver a while,�
I thought. She would be better prepared when my brother took over. He�d be the
one to get her into her outfit. I liked to watch him work. He had this
wonderful voice that seemed to cajole the most resistant minds to do as he
pleased.

I went out for lunch leaving a technician to watch her
vital signs. I left specific orders not to respond to her needs. She was not
allowed to do anything other than go to the bathroom. I also ordered him to
taint the water with a fast acting but tasteless laxative. Once that was
consumed he was to provide her with full access to the toilet. We didn�t want
our carpet soiled!

An hour later I returned to find our pony sitting on the
toilet shivering. She had made four trips to the toilet. In addition she had
consumed four untainted glasses of water. The laxative was formulated in such a
way to enhance her desire for water. This was needed to flush out the remaining
material and keep her from becoming dehydrated. She was past the worst of it.
In another hour she�d be ready for dressing.

But I wanted to give her a little something to think
about. �Honey, how are you doing?� I asked as she emerged from the dimly lit
toilet cage.

�About fucking time!� she yelled. �It�s cold!�

�I�m sorry. We had a problem with the heat. I�ll tell you
what. I ordered some nice clothes for you. They should be here in a little
while. Maybe we can get you out of that room. Would you like that?�

�You�re going to let me out? I�ll do anything. Please!�

�OK. Now there�s a catch,� I said.

�I�m listening,� she said as if expecting it.

�The clothes were going to have you wear are a little
restrictive.�

�How restrictive?�

�If I told you now I�d spoil the surprise. I�ll see if I
can do anything about the heat. I�ll see you in a little while,� I said before
turning off the sound and dropping the temperature to 55 degrees Fahrenheit. I
watched the monitor as she began screaming in the dark expletives I�d best not
describe.

&nbsp;

I called Arnold and told him that she�d be ready
in half an hour. With the temperature so low I didn�t think we should wait much
longer than that before we got her dressed. We wanted her just strong enough to
comply. Balancing our objectives was a difficult operation. But I had years of
practice in the area.

My brother appeared promptly a half hour later. �How�s she
doing?� he asked.

�Soft and pliable,� I replied. �I think she�d wear a suit
of barbed wire to get out of that room.�

Arnold ignored me and went immediately
to the console. He checked the monitor and found her huddled in the fetal
position shivering silently. Checking the thermal imaging camera he found her
skin temperature was near the critical stage. �Warm her up. You better turn on
the blowers too. She�s a little colder than I�m comfortable with.�

�Consider it done. I didn�t take into account that she was
quite so susceptible.�

�Cleo? Can you hear me?� he asked.

�Yes,� the girl replied through chattering teeth.

�We�re going to pump some warm air into there. Just stay
on the carpet. We just got the heater fixed.�

�Can�t you just let me out?�

�Not yet. We�ll do that after you�re dressed.�

�OK,� she replied. She was indeed softened.

As the warm air blew down on her body she became more
responsive. She sat upright and tried to garner some heat out of the small red
light at the center of the carpet. That was fruitless since the light was an
LED.

�Cleo,� he then asked. �My sister says you agreed to dress
in the clothes we have. Is that true?�

�Yes, Sir. Anything to get out of this room. I don�t care
anymore. I�m tired and scared. Please, just tell me what you want.�

�It�s not going to be that bad, Honey. Shade your eyes.
We�re going to turn the lights on.�

As she covered her eyes I increased the lighting to 75%.
The room was fairly bright but she would adapt to the intensity quickly. �Is
that OK?� he asked.

�It�s a little bright,� she said.

�Give yourself some time to get used to it. The lights
will help warm the room.�

She blinked a little for a minute or two then pulled her
hands away from her face. �OK?� he asked.

�Yes, Sir,� she responded.

�I�m turning on the toilet light. Go over and empty
yourself as best as you can. You won�t have an opportunity to go to the
bathroom for the next four hours.�

She went to the toilet and locked herself in as she had done
several times before over the past few days. She only needed to empty her
bladder. Her other issues were taken care of by the laxative. When she emerged
she stood and stared at the ceiling, noticing the darkened globes that held the
low light cameras.

I pressed a button and a large door opened in the wall.
Her complete outfit was in there. Arnold gave her instructions: �Go to the
cubicle and pull everything out. Put it all on the floor. Don�t be afraid of
the items. Nothing you�ll wear will hurt you.�

She immediately noticed that everything was made of red
leather. All the gear looked kinky. It was obvious to her that she wouldn�t be
wearing normal street clothes. This was going to be a very unusual dressing
session.

She began by grabbing the long boots, looking at them
curiously. She noted the six inch heels, staring at them with open mouth. �Lay
them on the floor,� he reminded her.

She took out some leather gloves, a thick collar, a
corset, a belt, several sealed black plastic bags of differing sizes, and a
leather mask. She didn�t waste time staring at them. She just did as she was
told. We knew from previous studies that she knew she was in for some
frightening bondage but she felt that being in bondage was better than the
isolation treatment she had been going through.

�Cleo, we�re going to start with the toughest part of the
ordeal. After you get past that you�ll be able to handle the rest of the
apparel much easier. OK?� he asked.

�OK.�

�Do you see the small plastic bag? Open it. You�ll find a
thick black rubber band. Use it to form your hair into a ponytail. Make sure
the ponytail goes high on your head.�

I watched as she complied. This part wasn�t difficult. It
was the next part that was going to cause her problems.

�OK,� she said as she finished.

�Very good, Cleo. Now comes the difficult part. You have
to put the mask on your head. Have you ever worn a leather mask before?�

�No.� she replied.

�It�s not that bad, really. Just make sure your hair goes
through the hole in the top. Then just pull the zipper down. Go ahead. It�s not
that bad.�

She took the mask in her hand, holding it like it was
radioactive. �Why do I have to wear this?� she asked.

�It will make it easier to control you,� he explained.

�Control me?� she said, struggling to get the words out.

�Yes,� he replied. �You agreed to wear whatever we give
you.�

Her face turned into a frown. She was obviously on the
verge of tears. She turned the mask over and looked at the inside. She brought
it up to her face and froze for a second. I could see tears run down her cheeks
just before she pressed the mask to her face. I saw her pull her hair through
the top hole. �Good girl,� he praised. �Now, just pull down the zipper.�

Her exercise in self bondage seemed to be an initial
success. Her head was now encased in leather; I could see her sad eyes from a
close-up from one of the cameras. Her mouth was free for the moment as there
was no zipper in the mouth of hood. We kept the opening clear to accommodate
the bit.

�Are you OK?� he asked.

�I guess so. It�s tight.�

�It�s supposed to be. There�s an elastic strip along the
back of the hood. If it were loose it would be uncomfortable. Is it lined up
with your eyes OK?�

�Yes.�

�Can you breathe through your nose?�

She sniffed a bit. �Yes,� she responded.

�It�s not really that bad, is it?� he asked.

�I guess not.�

�OK. Put the corset on next. It buckles in front.�

We watched her struggle with the outfit. It was a
temporary rig. Once we had her subdued we�d dress her properly with a true
leather corset with back lacing. This outfit was designed to be put on without
assistance. It was adequate and looked pretty good. As she finished buckling
the last of the six straps I was immediately impressed by the lay of her
breasts. The corset�s cups lifted them proudly. I watched her try to tuck her
nipples under the fabric. I knew that a few bounces would pop them right out so
we didn�t bother with it.

�The bra is too small. I�ll pop out,� she said.

�We know,� he replied.

�Somehow I knew that you did. OK, what�s next?� Her confidence
level was rising. She no longer seemed to fear the outfit. That was both good
and bad. We wanted to keep a certain level of fear in her to maintain control.
But cooperation was needed too. I thought things were going quite well.

�Put on the boots,� he said. I pressed a button that
extended a small bench for her to sit on. �Use the bench. Be careful when you
stand up. The heels take a little getting used to.�

As we watched she slipped the boots on. They extended to
the top of her inseam. As with the leather hood the zipper was lined with
elastic fabric to pull the leather tight. There were open eyelets along the
front of each boot. 

�Take the blue bag,� he said. �Tear it open and put on the
laces.�

It was hard to kneel in the boots. The leather was new and
stiff. But she manages to get to her knees and retrieve the blue bag. Inside was
a pair of gold nylon laces. She toppled over as she tried to stand up and
instead crawled over to the bench and used it to help herself back to her seat.
The laces didn�t give her any trouble.

�You�re doing great,� he said. �Almost done. Put the belt
on. Then take the collar and the gloves over to the carpet. Go ahead and put
the collar on. Make sure it sits correctly and is comfortable. The edges are
all coped so it shouldn�t bite.�

We watched as she put the belt on first. It buckled over
the corset. We then watched her struggle somewhat as she wrapped the collar
around her own neck. There were three buckles. With all the restrictive
clothing, especially the collar, it was hard to reach the tangs on the buckles.
The first one was the hardest. When the leather slipped into the hasp I knew
she would not have much trouble finishing.

�The last step for you is the gloves. Go ahead and put
them on. Be careful of the Velcro,� he warned her.

Unlike the other items the gloves were made of heavy
nylon. On each palm was Velcro. Arnold ordered her to kneel, facing away
from the door. �Put your hands behind your back and press your palms together.�

Once she had done that we had her. We opened the door and
as we had done countless times before retrieved the last two bags. One bag was
quite large. Arnold ripped it open to reveal a red
leather armbinder. �You did very well,� he said to her as she knelt with her
back to him. She didn�t even resist as he slipped it on her. Once it was slid
all the way up her arms, he crossed the straps in front of her. Now she was
truly helpless. 

I held the last accoutrement. �Open your mouth,� I said as
I easily slid the spoon bit in place. She didn�t put up even the slightest fuss
when I began buckling the bridle about her head. She was ready for the stables.

�Don�t worry, Honey,� I said to her. �Just go along with
it. It�s just a costume.�

She couldn�t talk but I heard her whimpering behind the
bit. �A wide brass wedge protruded from
her lips while their corners were pulled back sharply by the tension of the
bridle. I knew it was rough for her. I also knew that her psychological profile
told us that she adapted well to situations and she�d eventually be troublesome.
I had already briefed the stable crew. Of course, she wore a red outfit to
designate her as a HAAC resident. So that in itself was a clue to her attitude.

Arnold helped her to her feet and
attached a leash to her collar. �Just follow us,� he said. �Kerry will help you
get used to the heels. Try and keep your weight on the soles. The boots are
designed that way. Stay off your heels or you�ll fall.� I watched her nod as I
put my arm around her and helped Arnie lead her toward the door.

�Take her to Charlie,� I told him. �I got the prep guys to
squeeze her in.�

�Now?�

�Yes. I called him and asked if there was anything
available. Told me that one of his appointments caused some problems and
couldn�t make it.�

�No need to look a gift horse in the mouth.�

�You trying to be funny?� I said with a smile on my face.
It was a dumb joke!

Tails of Woe

&nbsp;

Dina:

&nbsp;

Why were they doing this to me?
I just couldn�t understand why they were trying to make me behave like a dog.
What did I do to deserve this? I was so frustrated by all this that I started
thinking of every last detail of my life for the last two years. Did I piss
someone off? Did I make someone jealous? I couldn�t think of anyone that I had.

After they took me to the
kennels they started addressing me as �puppy.� That was humiliating! Let me
tell you. What really upset me though was the sight of all the other girls.
There must have been over fifty being treated the same way. That�s when I
realized that this really was a government operation. We were being mass
produced. It was a clue. I just couldn�t figure out why we were all being
treated this way.

The day had been pretty
traumatic so they were gentle with me. They told me that they wouldn�t start
the real training until the next morning. So they put me in a cage that was
only three feet high. The cage had soft bedding on the bottom and a screened
top with iron bars over them. 

The trainer identified herself
as Harmony. �Are you thirsty?� she asked before she put me in the cage. I
nodded. No, you need to bark. I�ll let it pass this time but you have to act
the part. Otherwise I�ll have to use the collar.

So, I barked. I really hated
this. This wasn�t play acting. It was just a degrading, horrible experience.
They didn�t expect me to act like an animal. They expected me to become an
animal.

�Don�t talk when I pull the gag
out. Otherwise I�ll put it right back in. Clear?� she asked. 

�Arf!�
I barked.

My cage was a padded cubicle
roughly eight feet long and four feet on each side. It was lit by inset lights
along each side. The rear of the cage was too far back to see clearly. The
front had iron bars on the gate and an easy to open latch. Of course, with my
hands in these mittens I didn�t have any chance of opening the gate. I assumed
that was part of the plan.

Harmony smiled and told me to
crawl to the back of the cage. There was a rubber tube that I was going to have
to suck on for water and food,� she explained. When I crawled into the cage she
closed the door behind me. That�s when I saw the tube. It was in the form of a
human cock! �They�re going to make me do oral sex?� I asked myself silently.

It was an act I had never
performed. I considered it as degrading as anal sex. It was nothing more than a
male�s way of debasing a woman, dominating her. Now it was obvious that they
were going to make me learn to do the one sexual act that I hated more than
anything. I just wouldn�t do it!

So I sat there in my bondage. My
mouth was free but I feared yelling out. My last order was to remain silent. If
I did speak in my cage I feared the consequences. I didn�t want that ball to be
placed back into my mouth. So I lay down and sulked. But I was thirsty and a
bit hungry. The cock beckoned. I looked over my shoulder and saw Harmony
stooping to get a good view. �Go ahead. It won�t hurt you,� she said in a
falsetto voice. I turned back towards the protrusion then back again at
Harmony. �Go ahead,� she repeated.

�I hate this,� I thought as I
slipped my lips over the tube.

�Grip the base with you lips.
Don�t use your teeth or your collar will shock you,� she instructed.

I had to insert the phallus
almost to the back of my throat before I could reach the collar with my lips. I
twisted the device and was shocked. I pulled back from the device and laid
there panting from the pain. �Don�t use your teeth! It can detect that. Use
only your lips to grip it.�

I tried again. She had told me
to twist the collar then pull back part way. Otherwise the jet of water would
shoot down my throat. I did as she instructed. I must have done it correctly
because I got my drink. I repeated the act three more times. I got the hang of
it pretty quickly. So I tried my luck at the food. I twisted clockwise and was
rewarded with a sweet oatmeal paste. It wasn�t bad. 

�I�ll be back in an hour. Try
and get comfortable with your new outfit. Eat and drink all you want.�

So this was how I was going to
live from now on. I was going to crawl like a dog and satisfy men with my
mouth. If I had the chance I�d slit my wrists! I just laid down and cried. I
just couldn�t understand why this was happening to me.

&nbsp;

An hour later Harmony returned.
I had eaten my fill and was resting in my cubicle. The cubicle was too small to
turn around but I could twist my head somewhat to see who was staring into the
cage. As I watched Harmony opened the gate and let me back out.

�Open,� she said, holding the
red ball in front of me. �Get used to it. We don�t let puppies walk around
without something in their mouths. Come on,� she said. My eyes when immediately
to the end of the leash. The red button on the control caught my eye so I
opened my mouth as wide as possible. With the ball inserted I bit down on the
ball as instructed while the zipper was closed.

�Heel!�

I followed on her lead as I had
done before. All I had to do was watch her left heel. That�s all that mattered.
We passed through two security gates and arrived outside to find the same
assortment of depravity. I didn�t� have time to sightsee though. Harmony was
leading me at a brisk pace toward another gated area, this one being outdoors.
Behind the gates we came to a long series of four foot high gates. As I passed
them I noticed that they were dog runs. The dogs were human females of course.
Soon I knew I�d occupy one as well.

We arrived at a small building
set in the center of the wide path that ran in front of the gates. A tall woman
leaned out of the window and looked at me. �New puppy?� she asked.

�Yes,� Harmony explained.

�She�s not finished with her
outfitting,� the administrator noted.

�There�s a backlog. She�ll have
to endure for a day or two. Can we get her on a track?�

�Do you have her number? She�s
not marked yet.�

�66223�

�Thank you. Let me check.� The
woman disappeared into the shack. A few moments later she came back. Put her in
Track 23.�

�Thanks.�

�Brenda!� the woman yelled. 

A short female in black latex
arrived. She was hooded and gagged. Her heels were six inches high. When she
approached I noticed that her hands were completely free but she didn�t try to
escape or remove any of her bondage. 

�Track 23,� the administrator
said.

Brenda took my leash and led me
down the long row of gates until we reached one with the number 23 on it. In I
went. 

Once I was inside I could see
that the run was very long, perhaps one hundred feet in length. The top of the
run was sealed off with a wire fencing. A long square rod ran the length of the
corridor just under the ceiling. It reminded me of a garage door opener. My
guess wasn�t far off. Brenda took a short hanging leash that happened to be
hanging from the track and attached it to my collar. Then she disconnected the
other leash and climbed out of the dog run, closing the gate behind her.

�Just follow the lead. I�ll be
back in a little while,� Harmony said.

A moment later the track moved
forward and stopped. I could see that the leash was now ahead of me. I moved
forward a little and waited. Then it suddenly started moving. I had to follow.

As I moved down the path I
noticed that some areas of the corridor had fenced in openings. I could see
other girls being forced to crawl as well. Both girls adjacent to me were
dressed in black though. I didn�t know why.

When the track reached the end
it stopped for a moment. Then it moved back toward me. Fortunately the corridor
was fairly wide. I correctly guessed that it was going to start heading back. I
turned around and waited. A moment later I was crawling back toward the
starting point. This was horrible!

&nbsp;

I spent two sessions each day in
the dog run. If I was taken out of the cage I was immediately gagged with the
rubber ball. I really hated that. But I didn�t resist. The collar�s control was
absolute. 

In addition I had to bark often
to answer Harmony�s questions. I wasn�t allowed the luxury of human speech. I
had to understand orders but the only way to answer was with one or two barks. �I was learning the routine well.

On the third day I had an
additional visitor. Harmony came to my cage with a man. It was the man whom I
had seen on the first day. 

�How�s she doing?� I heard him
ask from behind me as I knelt on all fours in my cage.

�Pretty well, if you ask me. See
for yourself,� Harmony replied.

I heard the door open. Harmony
beckoned and I crawled out of the cage.

I immediately noticed the man
holding the rubber ball in front of my lips. I was well trained now and opened
my mouth wide to accept it. But instead of closing the zipper across my lips he
left it open. �Let�s see if she holds it voluntarily.�

As I sat there on all fours they
talked about the weather and the massive influx of females that had been
brought to the complex. As I eavesdropped I heard them talk about these
kidnappings as a sort of business. They kept talking about filling orders and
meeting demand. It was then I realized that I had done nothing to deserve this
fate. I was in this role because they needed a female to sell. I was being
treated as property!

�You bastards!� I yelled as I
spat the ball out of my mouth. �What gives you the right? I�m human! I�m not a
dumb animal!� 

At that point all I could do was
scream. I wasn�t screaming because I was mad. I was screaming because Harmony
was holding down the button. I was in absolute pain. The man grabbed the red
ball and inserted it into my wide open mouth. I was in such horrid pain that I
couldn�t resist. Only after the zipper was closed did she release the button.

�I�m sorry,� Harmony said
apologetically.

�It�s only her third day.
There�s no reason to apologize. I like my puppies better like this anyway.�

Harmony checked her watch. �We�d
better get going or she�ll miss her appointment.�

�I�m coming with you.�

�After seeing what she�s capable
of that�s probably a good idea.�

�Not a problem.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Cleo,
the newest ponygirl:

&nbsp;

I can�t even begin to describe
this nightmare! I was forced to put all this bondage gear on and now I couldn�t
resist them. What where they going to do with me? This gag was horrible. It was
heavy. It had these two wedges connected at the center. One wedge was in my
mouth and the other stuck out past my lips. There was also a metal bar running
across my mouth like a horse�s bit. I couldn�t talk and I couldn�t spit the
damn thing out. My head was encased in a leather hood too. The gag thing was
held in place by a bunch of straps that wrapped around my head. It was as if
they wanted to treat me like some sort of animal. Why were they doing this?

The woman had other business so
the man (I think his name was Arnie) connected a leash to the collar and led me
forward. I had to follow. The heels were ridiculous. I towered above him by
almost a foot. But he seemed to know I could walk in them. He took his time but
didn�t stop even when I started to stumble. He just put out a hand and steadied
me.

We eventually arrived at a pair
of steel doors. When we entered a man in a white smock was waiting for us. 

�About time,� he said.

�She just got acclimated,� Arnie
said. I guess that�s what they called this phase of the bondage game. 

�Well, let�s get going. I have
four puppies and three other horses to do.�

�Horse?� I asked myself as I was
led to a low metal frame. The bit now made sense. They were going to make me
into a horse. They were going to saddle me or make me pull their carts around.
That�s when I realized that I didn�t want to have any part of this scene. I
began to fight them.

�Whoa,� Arnie yelled. �Behave!�

But I didn�t. Suddenly my entire
head lit up in pain as he pressed a button on a small remote. The collar sent
shocks into my neck making me freeze in my tracks. �Don�t resist!� Arnie
instructed. �You can�t avoid this. Just go with it.� With that he hit the
button again as I was just getting the urge to fight them again. I screamed and
almost went to my knees. Arnie caught me. �Relax,� he said as he gently led me
to the rack.

The guy in the smock pushed me
against the waist-high frame, urging me to bend over as well as spread my legs.
My legs were spread about two feet apart and secured at several locations.
Below my breast hung pendulously. My neck fit into a steel brace, which clamped
around the wide collar. Just to further secure me they put three nylon straps
over my pinioned arms. I couldn�t move a muscle.

�I�d like to start with the
rings. Is that OK, Charlie?� Arnie asked.

�Fine by me,� he replied.
�Better patch her.�

Arnie came toward my head and
placed two black plastic patches on my eyes. They didn�t need any adhesive or
Velcro. Instead they seemed to stick naturally to the leather, sort of like the
static cling plastic they put on car windows. I was now effectively blind.

&nbsp;

Arnie:

&nbsp;

At this point we didn�t want her
to panic any more than necessary. We used hand signals as we had practiced
countless times before. I donned a pair of latex gloves as did Doctor
Charlie.� He took a lighted dental mirror
and looked up her nose. Then, taking a special gauge he measured the distance
from the base of her nose to the ideal location of the grommet. He found this to
be 9 mm from the end. The pop grommet calipers were set to 9 mm. He carefully
inserted the pliers-like tool into her nostrils and closed the jaws. Cleo
screamed as a loud pop and sizzle could be heard. The metal grommet was punched
through her septum and welded shut. Now she had a permanent small hole between
her nostrils. 

�Great job Doc,� I complimented,
breaking the forced silence.

A similar routine took place on
the blind pony as we pierced first her left breast, then her right. The
grommets used in her breasts were slightly different. The tubes of each grommet
were slightly longer than usual. This allowed them to be inserted into the
nipple without crushing it. Small metal disks squeezed the sides of each tender
bud when Charlie was done. As a loud snap was heard with the installation of
each grommet the girl screamed loudly. It was unavoidable. 

We inserted one inch gold rings
as temporary ornaments.

Finally we repeated the
procedure on her little clit. We did this from the rear. Her bent over form allowed
us to access the area quite easily. The procedure required us to massage the
little bud to bring it to arousal and make it extend as far out as possible.
She must have understood what was going to happen because she really started
straining at the straps. She couldn�t move however so we simply ignored her.
Her scream was as loud as I�ve ever heard a woman scream, gagged or not! She
had quite a set of lungs on her.

�Let me get a DNA sample and
we�ll get her tailed,� Charlie said.

He took a small razor and began
running it along the base of her backbone. When he was satisfied he took the
entire tool and inserted it into a holder inside a special machine. �Standard
mare?� he asked?

�Yes,� I replied, referring to
an upswept tail to match her natural hair.

It took nearly four minutes,
which was exceptionally long for the process. �Took a while,� I noted.

As Charlie retrieved the plastic
wrapped tail he told me that the DNA database was under heavy use with the
exceptionally large number of orders. He said he thought that they�d be
upgrading the systems before too long.

The tail looked like something
from a rat! I had seen them before. They were hairless brown cores that were
the sources of huge bushy ponygirl tails. Shorter
tails were used for our dogs. No girl liked the installation of such an item.
It was a penultimate indicator of their sub-human status!.

Charlie took a careful
measurement and marked the area where the tail should preside. Then he used a
coarse sterile sandpaper to abrade the area. The pony seemed to still be
groaning and crying from the previous tortures. When the doctor placed the tail
on her spine her head rose up and she screamed loudly. I heard it was painful
for some and of no consequence for others. Obviously this one didn�t take her
tail well.

�She�ll need to rest for some
time. Let�s get her plugged. I�ll call some orderlies to take her to her stall.
She�s too weak to march.�

&nbsp;

Dina:

&nbsp;

�Two visits in one day,� the man
in the white lab coat said. I was confused.

�What can I say? I like to watch
you work,� Arnie stated. He must have been here earlier.

�So, how�s she doing?�

�I�d say she�s progressing
fairly well. She sits without being told and will take a ball without
argument.�

�Good. She�s pretty tiny. Put
her up on the table. Let�s have a good look at her,� the doctor said.

Arnie bent down and picked me up
by putting one hand across my belly and another between my legs. Effortlessly
he set me on the examining table on all fours. �Better lock her down,� Arnie
said. �She was a little feisty earlier.�

�You corrected that, right?� the
doctor asked.

�Of course,� Harmony cut in.

�Well, we�d better do it anyway
just to keep her from hurting herself,� the doctor replied.

�Hold still, Honey. This won�t
hurt,� Arnie offered as he and the doctor began swinging metal manacles up from
the sides of the table. I had resisted enough and been punished sufficiently to
know better than resist. Still I was frightened. It took every ounce of self
control to keep from fighting them. But I just cooperated. Twin manacles were
attached to rods that swung on hinges from the sides of each table. They locked
my arms in their grip forcing me to remain on all fours. Similar, but much
larger, clamps swung up to grab my thighs. Small ones were placed on my calves.


The doctor opened the zipper and
held his hand in front of my face. �Go ahead. Spit it out,� he said. With some
difficulty I pushed the ball out of my mouth with my tongue. �Good girl,� she
replied.

�Was she measured?� the doctor
asked.

�No. We usually don�t have the
opportunity when we�re working with RACC stock.�

�We ought to do that now. I
don�t really have the time but it needs to be done. I thought she was partially
prepped. This is going to take a lot longer than I thought.�

�I told you she was coming from
RACC, Charlie. You should know we don�t do any of that there. Our stock is too
raw,� Arnie stated.

�I�m sorry. It�s my fault. I�ve
been working sixteen hour days trying to keep up. I should have known better,�
he said.

�Things should change in a week
or so.�

�Yea, I hope. Let me call the
gang and get her measured. I�ll have to push the next appointment till later
tonight.�

�I�m sorry, Chuck,� Arnie said.

�It�s OK. Things are tight right
now. Let�s do this right.�

I watched the doctor walk over
to the wall phone and call someone. �I need two girls for a measurement and
puppy prep in room six,� Charlie said. �Oh and push my next appointment back to
tonight, would you?� he continued. After a short pause he added, �I know it�s
late notice. Just do it and offer my apologies.�

�The girls should be here in a
few minutes. Let me get a kit,� Charlie said.

�I�ll pull off her hood and
collar,� Harmony said.

They all seemed to be preparing
to do something complicated to me. I was really afraid. I looked around the room
and saw all sorts of machines and instruments. It was like being in a mad
doctor�s laboratory. �Please!� I said. �Don�t hurt me!�

�Put a brace on her head,�
Charlie said, ignoring my pleas.

�No, please stop!� I pleaded.

Harmony walked over to me and
took my head in her hands. �Don�t be upset. It�s all going to turn out OK.�

�Please don�t do this. I don�t
want to be a dog!�

�But you�ll make a fantastic
little dog,� Arnie said.

�No I wouldn�t. I�m not a dog.
I�m human,� I argued with tears running down my cheeks. Arnie approached me and
petted my hair. Then he put his fingers under my chin. �Of course you�re human.
But soon you�ll be a puppy. That�s your destiny.�

�Why?� I cried.

�Because that�s the role that
the State has decided for you. There are too many females in the country and
our PM has decided that some of our girls will make good exports.�

�But why did they pick me?�

�You fit the profile. We had an
order for a short female puppy. And there you were!�

�I�m not going to win this
argument, am I?�

�No,� Arnie replied sternly. �So
just go with the flow or suffer the consequences.�

I was bound to this table and
didn�t have many options available to me. �OK,� I replied resignedly. 

Harmony removed the collar and
hood. My face felt like it was bathed in a cold breeze as the air hit my sweat
soaked cheeks. My hair was all matted and Harmony noticed it immediately.

�Her hair�s a mess,� she noted.

�That happens with RACC
puppies,� Charlie said as he continued to gather items from the drawers and
place them on a metal tray.

�I know,� Harmony replied. �Trim
and treat?� she asked.

�Let the crew do it. They�re
trained,� Charlie replied. �Just put the head brace on.�

As I watched, Harmony went to a
large white cabinet and pulled out a metal brace that resembled a halo ring for
paralysis patients. It consisted of two long bars that were topped by a metal
ring. All around the ring metal rods protruded like spines on a porcupine.
Harmony slipped the device into two holes on the table. Then she lowered the
metal ring until it surrounded my head just above my eyebrows. Once she had the
clamps tightened my head was completely immobile.

�Won�t this thing get in the way
of the wash?� Arnie asked.

�Yes, but the girls know how to
work around it. They�ve been trained. We don�t want to cut her hair. She�s a
puppy,� Charlie replied.

�Does anyone know who�s she
going to?� Harmony asked.

�Yes,� Arnie replied.

�Who?� Charlie asked.

Arnie just smiled.

�Where�d you come up with enough
money to afford a puppy?�

�I got a bonus from our illustrious
leader. He likes my work. So does our new ally, the President of Grumm.�

�It�s nice to have friends in
high places,� Harmony noted.

�Yes, well, I�m going to be
spending time there to set up their HAAC. Once that�s done I�ll get a pick of
the litter, pony or puppy.�

�You keeping this one then?�
Harmony asked. �She�d go for a lot on the market. She�s a very nice size for a
puppy.�

I felt humiliated again as they
talked about me as a commodity to be sold or traded. �I was Arnie�s
dog?� I thought. This keeps getting more and more bizarre!

�She�s too cute to trade. We�ll
see how she works out.�

Just then two girls dressed in
black latex arrived. I noticed their heads were covered in tight hoods.
Protruding from their mouths were the front halves of red rubber balls. Well,
nothing looked weird any more.

�Wash her hair and take a full
set of measurements,� Charlie ordered. Both girls nodded and bowed.

They started by going to a
cabinet and taking a spray can of soap. It looked like shaving cream. But they
squirted it on my head. Two pairs of hands began working it into my hair. The
scalp massage felt really good. Soon my head was all lathered and covered in
white foam. One of the girls took a metal basin and laid it on the table under
my head. Another wrapped a towel around my shoulders. I expected them to rinse
my hair but instead the stuff started dripping off my hair all by itself. Using
their gloves they began to squeegee the stuff out of my hair, depositing it in
the basin. My hair was wet but clean. One of them took a hair dryer and a comb
to pull the last bits of moisture out of my hair. Considering the halo it was
hard to do. But eventually my hair was clean and dry.

The next thing they did was just
so humiliating that I can hardly describe it. They inserted a large hose into
my anus and injected me with water. After a few seconds the flow was reversed
and I was sucked dry. The process was repeated twice more. It was a process
that had been done to me several times over the past couple days. I hated it.
Once my ass was cleaned they did my vagina. With my arms and legs bound as they
were I had no ability to resist, although my body sure tried to get out of
their grasp.

With my body cleaned, the
measurements began. They measured my bite. One girl took a thin block of wood
and put it between my teeth. The other had a digital camera ready. She took
three shots from above and below my head. The board was discarded and the
camera was given to the doctor.

The next step was to take the
other measurements. They were wide, varied, and strange. They took measurements
of my jaw, my nose, and my ears. My neck was measured as were my breasts, my
crotch, and my legs. Finally the spread my anus and sex and checked their
diameters.

Once all the measurements were
finished the doctor gave them a couple more orders which I couldn�t hear. They
left us at that point. I wasn�t sure what was going to happen next.

Everyone quietly waited. I
wasn�t sure what they were waiting for but Arnie kept checking his watch.
�Shouldn�t take too long for the stuff to process,� he said.

I heard the doctor doing
something to the console behind me. �Almost done,� he said.

I heard a series of beeps. �Here
we go,� Charlie stated.




&nbsp;

Arnie:

&nbsp;

The processing unit had finished
manufacturing the puppy gear for Dina. Now it was time to get her prepped. We�d
start with the crotch ring. We would use that to help hold her steady while we
pierced her nipples.

�What are you doing?� she yelled
as Harmony started massaging her clit. Harmony ignored her. �Stop it!� she
continued. �Don�t do that!�

But Harmony knew her business
and continued to work the little nub until it was fully engorged. Once she was
satisfied Charlie stepped up, slipped the tool over the nub and pressed the
trigger. The scream was exceptionally loud. It hurt so much that the girl
almost fainted. She coughed and struggled. A two inch ring was inserted into
the hole and a strap was connected from it forward to an anchor point on the
table. Her body suddenly became motionless.

�Wha�
What did you do to me?� she cried. �You promised not to hurt me!�

�I know,� Charlie responded.
�But that was before I knew you weren�t prepped. We only have to do this once.
It won�t take too long.�

�Please don�t hurt me anymore.�

�That can�t be helped, I�m
afraid.�

Charlie took a tool and measured
her nose for a center grommet. �Ten millimeters,� he said. Dina saw the pliers
in his hand as he made some adjustments to it. Two grommet halves were inserted
into the device.

�What are you going to do with
that?� she asked.

�Hold still,� he said as he
pushed the jaws up her nostrils.

�NO!� she cried as the loud pop
was heard again.

�OW! No more, please!�

�Just your breasts and we�re
done with the rings,� Charlie explained.

�My breasts?� Her eyes went
suddenly wide. �No, you can�t! Please don�t pierce my breasts. I don�t� want
them pierced.�

�Harmony, would you do the
honors,� Charlie asked, totally ignoring the plaintive girl.

�Sure,� she replied as she
walked over to her. Very slowly she began massaging the girl�s left nipple.

�Oh No!� she cried. When Harmony
stopped the girl knew what was coming. Charlie placed the pliers on her breast
and inserted the little silver tubes. Even before she had stopped screaming
Harmony had started massaging the other nipple.

�Well, we�re done with the
rings. Let�s get her plugged. These are new devices,� Charlie said holding up
the two silver phalluses. �They�re both flexible and have excellent internal
contact. Their range was improved to almost a half mile. They have GPS for
locating her if she runs off, Bluetooth for communicating with the other items,
and wireless Ethernet for communicating with central command.�

�Wow!� Harmony said.

�There�s more! The anal probe
has a pressure sensor. It gives off a beep and lights up when she needs to be
cleaned out. That info can also be transmitted to central command.�

�So we don�t have to guess,�
Harmony said.

�Correct. Let�s get them
installed. We�re running late.�

�You forgot the tube,� I
reminded the doc. �Gotta give her an outlet.

�Sorry, you�re right.�

The doctor took a plastic bag
and ripped it open. Inside was a special catheter with a one way valve. He
applied the sterile grease and inserted it. �Oh no!� she cried.

�Now we�ll insert the plugs,� he
said.

Each device was inserted using a
light lube that the doctor had available. He used so much of it he had it in a
large pressurized tank. The girl yelped a bit when the plugs were inserted but
otherwise didn�t complain. A wide red leather belt was buckled over her
abdomen. A wide flap was positioned down her crack and pulled up to her crotch.
A short matching flap came down from the front and met at her clit. The
catheter was plugged into a fitting near the end of the dildo. Charlie took the
wide ring and threaded it through both flaps, securing it with a globe shaped
lock that featured a little bell inside. �One day we�ll have to come up with a
way to hold those little buggers in without using a strap,� he mumbled to us.

�That�s new,� I mentioned.

�Yea,� he said. Notice how the
end of the dildo pokes out just a tiny bit? That�s how she pees. Of course you
have to open the valve to let her go.�

�What?� she asked. We just
ignored her.

Now all that was left were the
hood and the gag. The machine had created a nice tight hood for her. Unlike the
previous one there was a hole for her hair in this one. We removed the halo
from her head and put it back in the closet. She didn�t resist when we pulled
the hood over her head. It fit tight but it did fit. Every facial feature was
visible.

Her lips awaited the gag that the
machine had custom built for her. I watched as Harmony applied a bright red
lipstick to them. Since this hood didn�t have a zippered opening it was much
easier to work around the mouth.

The gag was actually something
we called the spoon. It was essentially a brass levered device that fit part
way into the mouth, the other half sticking out in front of her lips. It
incorporated a full mouthpiece to seal the oral cavity and a feeding tube for
water and mashed nutrients. She didn�t like it one bit when I put it in her
mouth!

�Your teeth fit into the
grooves,� Harmony said as she pushed the contraption into Dina�s mouth. �Just
bite down while I tighten the straps. You�re doing fine.�

I could see tears welling in the
girl�s eyes again. It was pitiful. Harmony took a long time with the straps,
tightening some while loosening others. She checked the tension of every bit of
black leather. She also checked for movement in the jaw. It was important that
she had as little movement as possible in her mouth. We didn�t want her teeth
to become dislodged from the gag.

As Harmony finished her task I
grabbed the remote. �This is different,� I said to Charlie.

�Yes,� he replied. The design
team has integrated all the elements of the outfit into a single system. Let me
show you.�

Charlie took the device which
resembled a TV�s remote control and started going through the menu. �You start
by acquiring the subject. You have to point the device at the barcode on her
collar.� As he did this I heard an audible beep. The device can store up to
fifty girls. Now, each element of her outfit can be programmed. The collar has
a voice monitor as it always has had. But new to its features is a query sensor
as well as a head shaking suppressor.�

�Come again?� I asked.

�The collar will detect if a
question has been asked. If it detects that someone has asked a question it
will sense if the girl has nodded or shaken her head. Of course we want them to
bark so it shocks them in the ass if they don�t. We can set various tolerances
for how long it�s willing to wait, how loud the bark should be, and whether
there should be a warning before the shock.�

�Interesting. Before, we had to
do that manually.�

�Correct. Now it�s automatic.
Here, I�ll enable the device and set the shock to level 3. Now, ask her a
question.�

�Did you understand all that?� I
asked the bound girl. She must have been listening because she barked. Suddenly
she screamed loudly. �What did she do wrong?� I asked the doctor.

�Nothing. I just happened to set
her bark threshold at 20 decibels. She can�t make that level of sound when
gagged by the device. The head shake sensor works in a similar manner. I�ll set
the tolerance to something fairly comfortable for her. Let�s say we�ll set the
tolerance to a mild four and set the punishment to level two. She�s still
learning so let�s not be too cruel.� 

At that point Charlie grabbed
the girl�s ponytail and shook her head up and down three times. The girl
screamed. Then he twisted her head side to side. Again she screamed.

�How does that detect the
movement?� I asked.

�The coping has all sorts of
sensors built in.�

�That�s great work, Doc!� I
praised.

�There�s more,� he said. �The
spoon now has a sensor in it.�

�For what?� I asked.

�Well, we thought that having a
tongue wagging around inside the oral cavity was a bit too much freedom for our
girls. So we came up with a little system to keep their tongues occupied. I�ll
show you.�

He walked over to the girl and
smiled at her. �OK Honey, just one or two more torments for you. Then we�ll be
done. OK?�

She involuntarily nodded her
head. Within a second of doing this she screamed. The sensors had detected it.
�You have to bark,� he said. When she did nothing happened. �Good girl,� he
said as he patted her head.

Looking at the girl he took the
metal wedge sticking out of her mouth in his fingers. �See this?� he asked.
This time she barked loudly. �This is a counterweight. You can feel the other
piece inside your mouth. Between your teeth is a little hole. When the weight
is horizontal or higher the hole opens. I want you to push on the hole with
your tongue. Flipping your head backwards while you�re doing it will help.�

We watched as she flipped her
head backwards. When she had done so, the weight was still at a downward angle.
�Try again,� Charlie said. After the second time the weight was sticking
straight out of her mouth. �Good girl,� he said as he punched a few buttons on
the controller.

�If you pull your tongue out of
the hole you�ll have five seconds to put it back. As a warning you�ll feel a
thumping in your vagina. On the fifth thump you�ll get a level three shock.
Understand?� he asked.

The girl barked but the sound
was so feeble that it set off the sensor. She screamed. �When your tongue is
pinioned you�ll have to put quite a bit of effort into barking,� he said. �Do
you understand?� he asked again.

�Arf!�
she said loudly. But in doing so she had pulled her tongue out of the hole. The
weight dropped and I saw her eyes widen.

�Get your tongue back in the
hole,� Charlie said. As we watched she flipped her head back. When it came down
she had missed again. She screamed. �Not fast enough. Get your tongue back in
the hole or you�ll get another shock.� This time she did it. �You�ll have to
get used to that. When you get back to your cage I suggest you practice.�

�Can I see that?� I asked.

�Sure,� Charlie said. 

�How long ago did you get
these?�

�Yesterday. We mentioned it at
the last two board meetings.�

�Well, I was in the States at
the time.�

�I know. I�ve been meaning to
brief you on the new features. Also, supplies are pretty limited. I only have
six units so far. We�re expecting more tomorrow.�

�Did you install all six yet?�

�I have one set left. Do you
have a subject in mind?�

�I was thinking that our new
girl Cleo could use some tighter discipline. I�m expecting her to be somewhat
troublesome. Any objections?�

�No, but I don�t have the time
to do it myself. You don�t need me to install this stuff. I had my secretary
put the manual online. I�ll have her send you the link. You can install the
spoon and the collar. There�s nothing out of the ordinary about that.�

�True. I�ll take a look at it.
Hey, let�s get her tail installed so we can get out of here,� I said.

�You�re right. I have a lot of
other girls to process. Let�s get this over with.�

As I had seen him do earlier he
took a razor-like item and scraped her skin in the vicinity of her lower back.
After he was satisfied he placed the DNA sample into the machine. After the
sample was read he asked me for the breed.

�Cocker Spaniel,� I said. �Let�s
try something bushy.�

The tail he retrieved didn�t
look much different than the core of the horse tail that Cleo had been fitted
with. This one was just as thin. It was a bit shorter, being only eight inches
long. �Hard to believe that it will look completely different in a few hours,�
Harmony said.

�The miracles of science, will
they never cease?� I said profoundly.

Charlie ignored both of us. He
took a sterile tray over to the table and donned a pair of latex gloves. As
before, he abraded the area where the tail would be attached. �Let�s see how
she responds to this?� he said as he pressed the fleshy pad at the base of the
tail to her spine. Her reaction was immediate. She arched her back and
screamed. Then she tried to wiggle her ass. Since we still had her clit ring
attached to the table she couldn�t move very much. She screamed several times,
first from the pain of the tail being attached, then from the fact that she had
pulled her tongue out of the hole. It all lasted twenty seconds at most. But
for her it was a horror that must have felt like it had lasted hours. When all
the pain had passed she was back to her pose, staring straight ahead on all
fours, the brass weight sticking straight out of her mouth. The only difference
was that now she had a rat-like tail sticking up from her ass.

But she was done.

Chapter 5

&nbsp;

Long Boring Walks

&nbsp;

Cleo,
the newest pony:

&nbsp;

While some would call this place
a stable, I had a simpler name for it, Hell! My life was now nothing more than
that of a beast of burden. I had no control over anything. I couldn�t even pass
gas without permission. I couldn�t talk, walk, eat, or even sit on the ground?

At the moment I was in a
concrete walled room that happened to feature a carpeted floor and so many
cabinets that I couldn�t even begin to describe them. The outer wall had a huge
glass window. By the strange refraction of the light I had to assume it was
exceptionally thick. The inner wall was completely made of glass.

My chances of escape, which I
couldn�t help but think about, were nonexistent. My arms were kept in a leather
sleeve and I was forced to wear these weird boots with six inch heels. They had
complete control over me.

My punishment for disobedience
was a simple shock in the ass. The devices in my ass and vagina were capable of
causing me unbearable torture. Arnie, my trainer, told me that the batteries in
the plugs were designed to recharge themselves from my own body heat! If they
weren�t such evil torture devices I�d have complimented the designer on his
ingenuity.

At the moment I was standing in
the middle of the room, supported by a pair of nylon straps that were clipped
to my collar. My legs were hobbled with an eighteen inch chain that was locked
to rings mounted to the insides of my boots. With my mouth filled with this strange
gag I couldn�t even complain about my situation. All I could do was stand there
and wait.

I observed a number of people
walking past. Several girls were walking in the nude, each chained in some
manner. They occasionally looked my way but continued on with their own
business. A couple men walked past as well. In the relatively thin procession
of people walking past my room I also noticed a number of women bound in latex.
I had seen these girls earlier on several occasions. In fact they rigged me to
the harness hanging from the ceiling.

It was nearly half an hour
before someone entered my room. The tall man looked me over silently and
smiled. �I suppose you�d like to be taken out of this outfit,� he said.

I nodded.

�You�ll have to whinny if you
want to communicate,� he said.

I already knew about the shock
gadget so I did as he asked. I whinnied, �Nee-hee-hee-hee.�
God I hated these people.

�Good. We�ll wait for the
domestics to arrive before we get you out of that outfit. OK with you?� he
asked sardonically.

We waited for several minutes.
He checked his watch often and seemed impatient. �I�m Jules. I�ll be your
trainer for the next six weeks. You�ll find me fairly strict. I don�t take no
shit. If you want trouble, just act stupid. Get the picture?�

I whinnied as expected. 

I tried to get a feel for his
quirks. From his short statement I knew I was not going to get away with
anything when under his care. I was going to have to be careful not to piss him
off. He looked impatient. I knew he�d train me with a similar lack of tolerance
for mistakes. This was not going to be fun.

Two latex clad girls arrived a
short time later. Under Jules� instructions they removed my gag, hood, and
corset. The collar, boots and armbinder were left on me. The twin plugs between
my legs and the belt holding them in place were left on too.

�The girls are going to free
your hands in a moment. I need your word that you won�t resist. You can�t
escape. You saw all the security gates.�

�I won�t try anything,� I
promised. He was right. There wasn�t any use trying to get away. The place was
too secure to even consider trying.

�They�re going to chain your
hands and legs together. You�ll have plenty of slack to move though. I don�t
want any crap from you, OK?�

�I said I would do whatever you
wanted. I won�t resist,� I offered.

�Good. Go ahead,� he said to the
two girls.

They started by replacing the
belt with a new one. I was told to hold the dildos in my ass and crotch. The
buckle for the new belt was in the back and a single large loop was in front. As
before a strap ran through my legs and was locked onto my clit with a large
round bell. A chain ran through the loop which ended in two pairs of handcuffs.
Obviously one pair was intended for my ankles while the other set were to end
up on my wrists.

The girls removed my boots first
and hobbled me. The chain was only a foot wide between my legs. Once the
armbinder was removed the gloves were taken off and my wrists were slipped into
the waiting cuffs. The last thing they did was remove the collar and replace it
with a thinner version. I appreciated the comfort.

�OK, this is the RAAC,� he said.
�For your information, that means Remedial Attitude Adjustment Center. In the
simplest terms, you�re here to have your attitude adjusted. More specifically
we�re going to turn you into a beast of burden. The official reason is due to
the high cost of fuel. The real reason is because our Prime Minister likes to
put women in submissive roles.�

�That�s just wrong,� I said.

�This isn�t really a democracy.
What the public thinks, what you think, doesn�t really matter.�

�So you�re just doing as you�re
told?�

�Absolutely, just as you�re
going to do as you�re told. The only
difference is that I�m going to enjoy my role in this. I seriously doubt you�ll
feel the same way about what�s going to happen to you.�

I looked at him speechless. It
was futile to argue with him. �So what do I have to do now?� I asked holding up
my bound hands.

�Well, it�s too late to get any
training done so I�ve pulled you out of your gear. We�ll put you back in your
outfit tomorrow morning and get you started on training. It�s not much more
than exercise. It�s not too bad.

�But I wanted to go over a few
rules. First and foremost: Do not try to escape. If you think being a pony is
bad, consider what it would be like to be a dog for a month or two. That�s the
punishment for escape. We set traps for girls who are looking for a way out.
That way you never know if the opening is real or just a ruse. You don�t want
any part of that sort of punishment. Clear?

I nodded. �I understand,� I said
timidly.

�Why don�t you go sit on the bed?
You look like you�re beat,� he offered.

I had been standing naked in
front of him without even covering up my breasts. I was so distracted by all
that was happening around me that my nudity didn�t even register. Now I tried
to put my hands on my breasts and suddenly realized that my hands wouldn�t
reach that far up. The bastards!

I accepted Jules offer and sat
on the cot that was situated on the left wall. It had a four inch mattress so
it would probably be somewhat comfortable. The mattress lay over a piece of
canvas suspended between the long rails. It was something akin to a camping
cot.

�How are you feeling?� he asked.

His latest questions and his
demeanor seemed to make me feel more at ease. Perhaps he wasn�t as mean as I
had thought. I told him I was feeling well. My feet hurt.

�OK, let�s give you the rest of
the rules. I already told you about escaping. Let�s go over some other stuff.
First, don�t remove your bondage gear without permission. Don�t help anyone
else get out of their bondage stuff either. Doing so will earn you real pain.
We mark our girls with a riding crop if they do anything of the sort. It�s the
only infraction that we physically mark our girls for. You don�t want that,
trust me.

�Next, don�t resist being
restrained or dressed. We have a team of trained attendants who specialize in
subduing and securing our ponies. If you resist I can have someone here in
minutes. If needed, we can use a stun rod on you to knock you senseless until
you�re restrained.

�Clear so far?� he asked.

�Yes sir.�

�We�re not going to get into
this silliness about casting eyes downward or calling us Master or Mistress, or
Sir, or Ma�am. We�re making you into a pony. If you make it out of the stables
your owners can determine what they want you to call them. For now, just call
us by the name on our tags. You may call me Jules.

�OK,� I said. Things were going
better than I had expected. I was almost curious as to what was going to happen
next.

�The plugs in your ass and sex
will be replaced each morning. You�ll sleep with them each night. They have
enough power to last two weeks. They can partially recharge themselves from
your own body heat. But we replace them daily for sanitary purposes.

�You will not be allowed clothes
while out of harness. Under normal circumstances we�d allow you a robe if you
were in the standard pony training center. But you are in the RAAC and by
definition we assume you are going to be difficult to control. Thus the reason
for the chains. With chains on there�s no feasible way to let you wear a robe.
So you�ll remain naked.

Every girl here is kept this way
and abides by these rules. There are twenty-four girls in this section. We
bring them in every two weeks in groups of four. I encourage you to make
friends. But be aware that your friendships will be short-lived. Once you leave
here you�ll probably never see these girls again. Any questions?�

�Is there any way out of this?�

�I think you know the answer to
that. The state doesn�t change its mind. The answer is a definitive no.�

�What happens if I sprain an
ankle or break a leg?�

�Well, we don�t shoot horses, if
that�s what you�re wonder. We have full medical facilities to treat any problem
that arises. In addition the outfits we�ll be putting you in are specially
designed to prevent injuries to your ankles, knees, and especially your back.
The chance of injury is almost nil, even considering the heels and all the
other stuff you�ll wear. In fact I don�t think we�ve had an injury of any
consequence in almost two years. Our biggest medical problem is viruses. Due to
the close quarters our girls live in colds spread pretty quickly through the
teams.

�I see,� I said.

�Yes, I�m sure you do. I bet
you�re thinking that you�re coming down with something right this very moment.
Well, feel free to do so. The only problem with that is your treatment would be
isolation. Our form of isolation isn�t exactly fun, if you catch my drift.

�You mean you�ll put me in a
dark room like they did when I first got here?�

�No. We�ll put you in a tight
little cage. Of course we�ll bring you all you need until you�re healthy. But
it�s a lousy way to live. It�s the best way to keep you from spreading the
infection to anyone else.�

�It keeps getting better,� I
said.

�We�ve been doing this for
twenty years. We have all the angles figured out. We�ve either thought of or
experienced every situation you could possibly think of. We know exactly what
you�re going to try and where you�re likely to screw up. You�re not our first
pony and you won�t be our last. So just do as you�re told.

�I don�t think I�m going to like
this life,� I mumbled to myself.

�Go get something to eat down
the corridor. The other girls will help you. Don�t trip on your chains.�

�I can leave my room?� I said
surprised.

�Yes, but don�t try to get past
the guards at the end of the hall. They don�t have much of a sense of humor.�

�Well, I can�t think of anything
else,� I said.

�Be careful of your tail,� he
suddenly said as he was getting up. �It will take some getting used to.�

�I know.�

�Did anyone tell you to use the
toilet backwards?� he asked.

�Backwards?� I asked. Then it
hit me. �Oh, now I get it. If I sit on it the normal way my tail would go in
the water.�

�Our toilets are designed with
an up-sloping front and a slot for your tail. Just be careful when you get up.
Hurting your tail would be as painful as breaking a leg.�

�How do I go if I have this belt
locked on me?�

�Just come back to your room and
ask for an assistant. Someone will remove the gear, let you relieve yourself, and
then put it back on you. Parts one and two are usually no problem. It�s part
three that can get you in trouble. You�re not going to resist having the plugs
reinserted, right?�

�No sir! I�ll cooperate.�

After he left I decided to look
out the window. It was late and I didn�t see much. Most of the areas were dark
with a few spotlights scanning the distant grounds. I was correct about the
glass. It was unbelievably thick, perhaps six inches. There was no way I was
going to break it.

Walking with this short chain
between my legs was a struggle. I nearly fell as I inched my way toward the
door. When I stepped outside I wanted to find someone to talk to. I was new
here and could have used some assistance. The first girl was named Melanie. She
was fairly tall, perhaps six feet or so, blond, and fairly thin.

�Hi,� I said. �I�m Cleo�

�You�re new?� she asked without
giving her name. She seemed upset.

�Yes. What�s your name?�

�Melanie.�

�Been here long?� I asked.

�Two weeks.�

�Are you OK? You seem upset,� I
said with a concerned voice.

�You trying to be funny?� she
asked angrily.

�No, of course��

�We�re all doomed. They�re
turning us into animals. Jesus Christ! Why did this happen to me?� She started
crying. We were both chained so we couldn�t really hug. 

�These damn chains!� I said.

�What was your name again?� she
asked me.

&nbsp;

We made our way to the cafeteria.
The trip down to the glass enclosed area was no treat. We had to hobble all the
way down with tiny steps due to the short ankle chains. The sides of the
corridor featured railings that Melanie encouraged me to use.

When we arrived I was surprised
at how ordinary the place looked. There were four tables arranged in two rows.
Along the back wall was a counter filled with fruits, raw veggies, and some
other assorted items. There were paper dishes but no utensils.

The tables themselves were
somewhat unusual and designed specifically for us. The tables were round and
could seat eight girls. There were no chairs. Instead they all featured a set
of eight pipes, each six inches in diameter that happened to be well padded.
Under the pipe was a foot stand. I noticed all the girls that were seated
straddled the pipes and then put their feet on the padded bar underneath. The
reason was obvious. It was the only way to get enough slack in the chain to
eat.

�Have a seat,� one of the girls
said. �I�m Jo.�

Jo was another tall blonde with
large boobs. She seemed to be pretty calm considering the situation we were in.
�Just get in?� she asked.

�Brand new,� I said.

�This is Elaine. This is Angie.
And the one sitting next to you is Megan. She just came in today too.�

�Hi,� I said.

�You�ll have to excuse Megan.
She�s a little upset. New girls usually get that way,� Elaine said. She was
seated on the other side of Megan. Nobody could hug her because of our bonds. I
felt the frustration too.

Megan was exceptionally thin and
pretty. And she was very young. Her hair was ash blonde and dropped down to her
shoulders. Here eyes were red. All she did was cry and look around like a
scared rabbit. �Hi, I said. �Are you OK?�

�Fuck off!� she said suddenly.

�Oh Kay!� I said slowly.

�She�s having her anger streak
early,� The dark haired Angie said. �Melanie waited almost a week and a half
before she got pissed.�

�You seem to know a lot about
this stuff,� I said to the three girls who had been seated at the table when we
first arrived.

�Can�t help it. I�m a
psychologist,� Angie said. �Elaine was a fashion model. I forget, what did you
do, Melanie?�

�Horse trainer,� she said.

We all laughed. Even Megan
looked up with her eyes wide. �You�re kidding?� she said, breaking out of her
stupor.

�Would I lie?�

�How about you Cleo? What did
you do before you got here?�� Angie
asked. She seemed to be the most intelligent of the group.

�I ran a women�s clothing shop, Poliska�s of Horwath. Maybe
you�ve heard of it?� I said.

�I used to go there all the
time. Great store!� Melanie said.

�I worked in the back. I
specialized in the high priced clientele. I have a feeling it put me on
someone�s shopping list.�

�Well, the way I�ve heard you�re
probably not far off for the truth. I�d bet we were all chosen because some
asshole thought we�d make a good horse in their stable,� Elaine said.

The center of the table had
water, fruit drink, and coffee dispensers. Paper cups and all the fixings for
the coffee were readily available in the center of each table. Elaine poured me
a cup of coffee.

�Thanks, but it�s late,� I said.

�It�s decaf,� she said. �There�s
no caffeine in any of the food.�

�Oh, well then, thanks,� I said.

As I was accepting the cup a
tall redhead walked into the room. She seemed a little frightened, clinging
onto the rail to keep her from falling. �Over here, Honey,� Elaine said.

�You can always tell the new
girls by the tail. It hasn�t filled out yet.�

Elaine introduced all of us. The
new girl was named Bonnie. Bonnie seemed out of sorts. After seeing Megan and
her reaction to all this, I understood Bonnie�s state
of mind. She nervously sat and looked fearfully at each of us.

�Relax, Honey. We�re all in the
same boat. Put your feet up on the rests so you can get some slack in the
chain,� Elaine said.

�Just get here?� I asked.

�Yes,� she said whimpering.

�Me too. Are you OK?�

�Yea. I guess so. They put a
tail on me! They want me to be a horse!� she cried.

Elaine took the new girl�s hands
in hers. �We�re all being treated the same way. You�re not alone.�

�You�re all being turned into
horses?� she asked.

�Notice the tails on each of us?
What do you think?� Angie asked.

�My God!� she said.

�Grab some coffee,� Elaine said.
�It will help. Megan, would you like anything?�

�I�ll take some bug juice,� she
said.

�You feeling any better,� I
asked after watching her sip at the grape juice.

�I suppose. Who are you again?�
she asked.

�Cleo.�

She smiled. �I�m sorry I snapped
at you.�

�I completely understand.�

�It was just so horrible, the
way they treated me.�

�I know.�

�You�re taking it pretty well
for a new girl,� Angie said.

�What�s the point of resisting?
They have all the angles covered. Why make things more painful?� I asked.

�That�s what we all learned.
It�s just that we never learned these facts quite so quickly.�

�I guess I�m a quick learner,� I
joked.

From a distance we heard
marching. We could hear multiple sets of heels coming down the hallway. After a
moment or two they marched past the glass partition that separated the
cafeteria from the hallway. What we saw was incredible!

�Carrie and Brenda,� Elaine
said.

The first thing we saw were a
pair of girls being led by a tall, older woman. She was dressed in black
leather pants, knee high boots with six inch heels, and a white silk blouse.

�That�s Anne. Don�t mess with
her!� Elaine warned.

Behind her, two girls crawled on
hands and knees. Each was hooded and wore corsets. They wore leather gloves
that went up to their armpits, pointed boots, and high leather collars. One
girl was wearing red leather and the other was wearing black.

�I don�t envy them, the poor
bitches,� Angie said.

�Huh?� I asked.

�They�re being trained as
puppies. That�s a permanent role for them. They�re going to be on their knees
for at least ten years. I can�t imagine what that�s going to be like for them.�

�My God!� Megan said.

�They use it as a threat. If we
don�t make good ponies, they�ll turn us into puppies,� Elaine informed us.
�You�ll see the video this weekend. They show it every other week just to pound
it into our heads.�

I looked at each of the girls at
the table with wide open eyes. Elaine pointed to the hallway and suddenly I got
a good look at both the puppies and the girls behind them. The puppies were
holding leather rods in their mouths. Reins ran up from the rods to the mouths
of a pair of red clad ponygirls. They were being led by the girls in front,
high stepping down the hallway.

�They�re in their last two
weeks,� Elaine said. �They�ll be out of here at the end of next week.�

�And we�re going to follow the
same path?� Megan asked.

�Yes,� Angie replied. 

�Jesus,� she said.

The procession passed slowly
past the glass partition. �You can�t let it get to you. It�s just a costume,�
Elaine said.

�It�s a nightmare,� Bonnie said.

�It�s not that bad. We�ll have a
much better life than those dogs. At least we don�t have to satisfy anyone with
our mouths,� Elaine said. Angie nodded in agreement when she said that.

�That�s disgusting,� Bonnie
said.

�Yea, I know,� Angie said. �I
was a dog for two weeks. You don�t want any part of that!�

�You were a dog?� I asked.

�About six weeks ago I was
sentenced to two weeks in the kennels. If you think this is a nightmare, you
should try that! They teach you how to do tricks, fetch balls and sticks, and
even roll over. They make you bark like a dog too. 

�Then they treat you to sexual
training. They make you practice cock sucking and pussy licking. They don�t
care if you�re gay, straight, or bi. They want you to use your mouth to satisfy
them. If you don�t they shock you until you do. If you keep refusing they jack
open your mouth and rape you. I watched three girls get that sort of treatment
while I was being trained. I didn�t like what I was doing but I cooperated.
It�s the most depraved act I�ve ever done. I�ll never run off again!� she said.

�These people are monsters,�
Megan said.

After a pregnant pause I opened
my mouth. �Elaine, you�re a psychologist. Has there ever been anyone really
depressed?�

She laughed. �What do you think
we are? Nobody�s exactly jumping for joy at this table.�

�No, I meant really depressed,
as in dangerously so.�

�To be truthful I�ve never seen
any. Maybe they don�t take girls that might try to take their own lives.�

�Psychology isn�t an exact
science,� I offered. �At some point they must have had a problem like that.�

�Maybe. I�d almost bet on their
destination if that were to happen.�

�Any woman will make a good
dog,� Angie said. �If they caused any problem, including being crippled by
their emotional state, I�d almost bet they�d end up in the kennels,� she said
with a sad look on her face.

�Yea,� I said, sorry that I had
asked.

Two girls entered the cafeteria.
Unlike us, they weren�t naked. It was the two ponygirls that had marched past
earlier. They were wearing their outfits although their hands were now bound by
the all too familiar chain that ran through their belts. They still wore their
boots, corsets, and collars. They were no longer hooded or gagged. They took
the last two seats.

�New girls?� the one on the left
asked.

�Cleo,� I offered.

�Bonnie.�

�Megan,� my blonde neighbor
said.

�I�m Brenda. This is Carrie.�

Brenda�s hair cascaded down her
back. She had multiple ribbons holding it together to keep it manageable.
Carrie had done the same.

Carrie�s hair was blonde.
Brenda�s was jet black.

�How was it?� Angie asked.

�Same old stuff,� Carrie said.
�We�re pulling carts now.�

�Gotta
be better than walking those damn paths,� Melanie said.

�I can do either. I�m used to it
by now,� Brenda replied.

�At least we don�t have to wear
saddles. I need bug juice,� Carrie said as she filled a paper cup.

�Saddles? Megan asked. �They
make you wear saddles?�

�We don�t. We�re not big enough.
They just make us pull carts and buggies. You have to have broader shoulders to
be a saddle pony.

�Like me?� Bonnie asked.

�It�s possible,� Brenda replied
carefully.

�Oh God!�

�We�re all here to support you,�
Angie said. �We�re all in this together.�

Bonnie just stared at everyone
with tears in her eyes.

�There�s still a chance you�ll
be put on a cart team,� Brenda said. I�ve heard that they don�t have much use
for saddle ponies. They need us to pull coaches for transportation. Saddle
ponies are used for shows and things like that.�

Bonnie seemed to relax a bit.
�Do you two march together?� I asked.

�No, our hair doesn�t match. We
march with other girls from one of the other pods.�

�How did you get such long
hair?� I asked.

�Rapunzel
cream,� Carrie replied.

�What?�

�They treat your scalp with a
cream to increase hair growth. They think ponies look best with hair that
trails to the ground.�

�That�s crazy,� Bonnie said,
suddenly gripping her own long locks.

�Did you ever hear how many
girls they have locked up here?� Megan asked, changing the subject.

�I heard there are over two
hundred ponies being trained at any one time. Anne told me that they�re
building a new facility east of here that�s twice as big.�

I had to know. �How many girls
are turned into dogs?�

�I heard that they have a
capacity for fifty girls in the kennels. I don�t know how many they actually
have though. My trainer won�t talk about them. It upsets her too much.�

�So, how are you all taking it?�
Carrie asked after taking a sip from her cup.

Bonnie and Megan stared at her
like she was an alien life form. I just shrugged my shoulders.

�That bad, huh? Well, we were
all first day recruits at some point. You�ll get over it.�

�I�m not so sure,� Bonnie said.

�Keep thinking like that and
they�ll have you barking in no time,� Carrie said.

�That�s not funny,� Bonnie said.

�I didn�t intend to be funny. I
spent two sessions as a dog in the kennels. It took a while but I learned to
submit. They have their own three strikes rule, you know. The third time you
visit the kennels, you never leave!�

We all looked at her with fear
in our eyes. I wondered how they could be so cruel to put someone in that sort
of bondage for years at a time. Their lives had to be hell. Why would they do
such a thing?

We chatted for a half hour
longer before turning in. �I need to use the bathroom,� I said after the door
closed. A minute later a latex clad female came in and removed my belt and
dildos. She pointed to an open door where I found a sink, a toilet, and a huge
showerhead suspended over a tiled area. In one corner I saw the coiled hose
they would use to clean me. I was fortunate that the girl didn�t use it on me. 

&nbsp;

The following morning I was
awakened by a loud bell that rang from the PA system. I awoke groggily trying
to get a hold of my senses. I felt something strange pulling me from behind. It
was my tail. It was now covered with bushy blonde hair that was nearly three
feet long!

Minutes later two of the
domestics came in to clean me. They silently led me into the bathroom where
they chained me under the shower with my hands above my head. First they locked
my feet to chains on the floor. Then they connected padded leather manacles to
my wrists. Only after doing so did they remove my belt, dildos, and chains. I
watched as the chains connected to my wrists disappeared through a hole in the
center of the shower head. Fortunately they didn�t suspend me. But my arms were
kept painfully stretched.

�Jesus Christ!� I said as the
water came on. It was freezing. But the water quickly warmed to a pleasant temperature.
One of the girls next took a bottle of green liquid and poured it into a paper
cup. She held it to my lips and showed me the bottle. It was mouthwash. It took
it in my mouth and swished it around before spitting it out. She held the glass
to my lips a second time and we repeated the process. I guess we were going to
skip brushing the teeth.

They used a foaming wand to wash
my body. They ignored my hair for the time being. The wands had wide circular
brushes that seemed to be saturated with suds. They hit every spot on my body,
including the very sensitive areas. The water never stopped falling during the
process.

They handled my hair last. First
they turned off the water. Then they applied something from a spray can that
looked like shaving cream. For a moment I thought they were going to cut my
hair off and shave me. I was glad that didn�t happen. Instead they worked the
foam into my hair and just waited. Several minutes later they turned the water
back on to rinse me down. As a final measure they took another can of foam and
using a very small amount carefully worked it into my scalp. The girl showed me
the label. It said �Rapunzel cream�. Now I knew how
the girls got such long hair.

Once my hair was treated they
turned on a large heated blower that seemed to blow from the shower head. The
two girls stayed close so the water would be blown off their outfits as well.
They used towels to assist the process, touching my crotch and breasts in the
process.

From behind I suddenly heard a
loud buzzing. One of the girls had an electric razor in her hands. She ran it
across my underarms and between my legs. My bush suddenly disappeared. Then she
ran it down my legs.

When she was done I heard the
other girl start another buzzing device. This was a depilator.
When she ran it across my skin it pulled on the tiny remaining hairs that were
left by the shaver. The armpits were bad but when she ran it across my
sensitive areas I found out just how sensitive I was down there. I bit my lip
to avoid screaming. By the end of that ordeal I was spent. Depilating my legs
was hardly worth mentioning after all the suffering I had endured.

I watched the girls grab the
coiled hose and knew what was going to happen next. It was the most horrible
experience of all of the massive number of torments I had to endure. As before
they inserted the probe into my ass and injected me with water. After filling
me it immediately sucked out the solution. The process was repeated again and
again until they were satisfied. I saw the girl replace the tip. Then she
inserted it into my vagina. It was humiliating.

The dildos weren�t replaced just
at that point as I expected them to. They did put the manacles on my hands and
feet before leading me out to the main room. Jules and Arnie were waiting.

�All clean?� Jules asked.

�Yes sir,� I replied.

�I�ll have them removed if you
promise to be cooperative,� Jules informed me, referring to my manacles.

�I�ll do whatever you want,� I
told him.

Jules nodded to the girls. A few
seconds later my chains were removed. One of the girls brought over a red
bodysuit. �Put it on,� Jules said. �It�s custom made just for you. The girls
will help.�

I sat on the bed and began
pulling it over my legs. Then I put my arms in. The crotch area was open and
reinforced with a rounded coping. The zipper went from the small of my back to
the top of the built in hood. There were holes for my breasts too. It took
several minutes of struggling to get everything situated. When all was said and
done I was wrapped in the red outfit quite snugly. My boobs were sticking out
proudly and my crotch was fully exposed.

�Let me have a good look,� Arnie
said. �Very nice,� he said approvingly.

�Let�s get her suited up. She
has a lot of walking to do today.�

The next items were the shiny
metal dildos. I knew their purpose but there was little I could do to prevent
their insertion. If I caused problems they had all the resources they needed to
subdue me. So I let the girls push them into me. A leather belt was wrapped
around and locked to my clit ring.

The corset they used was
different than the one they had allowed me to put on myself. This one was made
from black patent leather and was heavily boned. There were no laces though.
They used a ratchet system to pull the edges of the corset together. Then they
ran a steel wire up through the edges just like they were inserting a hinge
pin. And I can tell you, it was tight!

A red leather arm binder was
produced from one of the closets. It only took a second to secure my arm behind
me. Red boots were placed on my legs. They had six inch heels but had two inch
high platforms. So I could actually walk on them. The soles were a bit wider
than I was normally used to seeing and that helped me maintain my balance.

�The heels are short,� Jules
told me. �Stay on your toes when you walk.�

Jules encouraged me to walk
around the room in the new boots. They seemed to be much more comfortable than
I had expected. Heels always seemed to cause me problems whenever I wore them
in public. These boots seemed to be better designed.

�They�re really nice,� I said.

�Get used to them. You�ll be
wearing them every day from now on,� Arnie said.

The leather mask was still going
to be used. They made me kneel so the girls could reach my head easier. This
one was exactly like the last. They pulled my hair through a hole in the top
and closed the zipper. 

The mask was followed by a
collar and the mouthpiece. Jules inserted the mouthpiece himself. �Open,� he
said as he held the device that featured a myriad of straps. Once it was in my
mouth he told me to bite down. My teeth fit into the grooves on the top and
bottom of the device. My teeth were an inch and a half apart when they were
seated. It was a somewhat uncomfortable position for my mouth but it wasn�t
terribly painful. Once the straps were fastened it actually became more
comfortable. But I couldn�t move my jaw once the straps were fastened around my
head. And that was annoying.

The mouthpiece had this brass
weight on the end. It was hinged between my teeth. The inner part leaned against
my palate and was annoying because it went fairly far back in my mouth. Under
the pivot point there was a small box that extended past my teeth. It didn�t go
far into my mouth though, only about a half inch.

Arnie approached with a small
remote control device. He pointed it at the back of my neck. I heard a beep.

�Hold still while I program the
unit,� he said. The two girls held me steady.

Arnie showed Jules how the
device operated. It was obviously a new item on their list of greatest torture
devices on the planet.

�I�m setting the nod sensor to
five and the response to 4. That should keep her from nodding or shaking her
head.�

�What about when she�s
marching?� Jules asked.

�It�s automated. The unit can
detect movement from the dildos. If it sees she�s moving the unit will ignore
any head shaking.�

�Ingenious,� Jules said. �Now
what�s this about a query sensor?�

�The device can detect
questions. When we ask her a question she has to whinny within a set period. By
default that�s five seconds.�

�That should be good enough. And
finally, what about this tongue thing?�

�Well, I have it disabled at the
moment because she�s not been told. Let�s get it working though.�

�OK, Cleo. In between your teeth
you should feel a hole in the box that�s sticking into your mouth. It�s closed
right now. I want you to stick your tongue into it while you flip your head
backwards. Push your tongue in as far as it will go.�

They watched as I flipped my
head back so I could stick my tongue in the hole. On the first try I got it.
The weight was sticking out straight rather than leaning downward.

�Good girl,� Arnie praised me as
he pushed a series of buttons on the control. �The mouthpiece is live. If you
pull your tongue out the jaws will make contact and you�ll get a shock in your
ass.�

�Great!� I thought.

�You�ll get five warning thumps
in your vaginal probe before getting shocked. You have five seconds to put your
tongue back if it slips out. Understand?�

I nodded. Then I screamed as the
shock hit my ass. My tongue came out and I immediately began flipping my head
back. I was getting the hang of this tongue thing pretty quickly because again
I inserted my tongue in the hole.

�Don�t nod,� Jules told me.
�Whinny!�

�Nee-hee-hee-hee,�
I said loudly. I was in pain from the lingering effects of the shock. The pain
drove me to speak loudly, even with my tongue pinioned.

�Good girl,� Jules said.

In the hallway a girl waited on
hands and knees. In fact there was a �puppy� at every doorway. Jules attached a
set of reins to my mouthpiece and placed the joining leather bar in the mouth
of the waiting girl. She immediately got on all fours and held her head
proudly.

�OK, pony. Keep your knees up
when you walk and follow the puppy. We�ll follow closely behind to make sure
you don�t do anything stupid,� Jules said.

�Corridor 39B,� Arnie told the
girl.

She started crawling slowly
toward the far end of the aisle. A pair of security guards checked Arnie�s and Jules� ID then allowed us to pass. Twice more
we passed through similar checkpoints before we were outside. The walk to the
�Corridor� only took a few minutes.

The puppy pulled at a steady
pace. I followed, lifting my knees at Jules� and Arnie�s
encouragement. I had to concentrate on keeping my balance, keeping my tongue in
the little hole, and lifting my knees. It wasn�t easy to keep everything
working at the same time. My tongue was now dry so it stuck somewhat to the
jaws of the gag. In addition there were rough areas on the jaws to help me keep
my tongue in place. But I had real problems with my knee lifts. A few times I
didn�t lift my knees high enough. When I did fail to please them they zapped me
with a very low level shock. It wasn�t enough to cause me to scream but it got
my attention.

Eventually we reached the
corridors. The buildings were long and narrow. There were many of them, perhaps
forty or fifty. I couldn�t tell. The buildings were ten feet wide and at least
a hundred yards long. We walked past quite a few of them before we ended up at
our destination.

A latex clad woman was waiting
for us. Jules removed the reins and released the puppy to the woman�s care.
Without saying a word the puppy moved to the heel of the woman. Once she was in
position the girl walked away. I didn�t know where they were headed. 

From the inside the building
looked just like I had expected it. There were a long series of floor to
ceiling windows, wide brick pillars, and a long empty corridor. I supposed that
this was where I�d be marching. I was correct.

�Stand here while I put your
code into the computer,� Jules said. He walked over to a control station and inserted
a few numbers. �One pass?� Arnie asked him.

�For starters,� Jules said. �I
let the heart rate sensor schedule her rest periods. That�s the safest method.
Do you want to do the honors?�

Without saying a word Arnie took
me to a lit green square, being careful to not stand on it himself. �We�re
going to teach you to march now. You�ll be here for a while today. You�ll have
a second session this evening. Now pay attention. This is a little complicated.
You�re going to march down the path. The light on the square in front of you
will light up. When it does, lift your right knee slowly, then stomp it on the
square in front of you. As you do slowly lift your left knee so your thigh is
horizontal and then stomp it down on the next lit square. There are
computerized cameras that will be watching your form. If you don�t lift your
knees or you move out of pace with the lights you�ll get a warning in your
crotch dildo. If you don�t correct yourself quickly you�ll get zapped. The zaps
are pretty powerful and it will knock you to the ground. When that happens you
have to roll onto your belly, get up on your knees, then get to the next lit
square within three minutes. Otherwise you�ll get zapped again. Clear so far?�
he asked.

I was just about to nod my head
again when I remembered the last experience. I whinnied. �Good girl,� Arnie
said.

�One other thing. Don�t let more
than one foot touch the squares unless you�re on the end squares. OK, now lift
your right toe off the square and balance on your left. Wait for the square in
front of you to light up.�

The square lit. �March,� he
said.

The pace was painfully slow. I
wanted to walk faster but the lights didn�t come on quickly enough. I went six
squares when I felt a thumping in my groin. Lift your knees higher or you�ll
get shocked,� Arnie warned.

I did as he advised and the
thumps went away. But in doing so my tongue came out of its hole. I had to flip
my head back while continuing to march. I stepped on the square in front of me
before it was lit. The pain in my ass was excruciating and I went to the ground
screaming.

Arnie was standing next to me.
�First, get your tongue in the hole,� he said. I flipped my head back and got
it in place. �Next, get on your belly. Then pull your knees under you. You have
two minutes left to get on the lit square.�

It was torturous but I got on my
feet. The heels and the fact that I had no use of my hands was a horrible
obstacle. Arnie didn�t touch me at all. He let me do it all on my own. I got to
the square in time though.

�Lift your right toe and let�s
move on.�

We were only a third of the way
down the corridor. It took several minutes to walk all the way down. In the
process I had been zapped twice more. The first time I fell and had to go through
the same process of getting on my belly, pulling my knees under me, then
getting to my feet. Fortunately the second time it must have caught me at the
right moment. I screamed but didn�t fall. I was able to crouch and endure the
pain. After a moment to recover I got on the square without being told and
started the march again. Arnie praised me for that.

We eventually reached the end of
the path. When I landed on it I heard a loud single bell chime. The square at
the end was longer and lined with a yellow border. Now that I thought of it,
the first square looked identical. Arnie told me to turn around, take two deep
breaths and lift my toe. We were heading back.

�When you hear one chime you
have to keep going. If you hear three you can rest.�

The march back was even more
frustrating. I was knocked down five times, three for failing to pay attention
to the warnings from not lifting my knees, and twice because I pulled my tongue
out of its hole. My eyes were filling with tears. Arnie didn�t seem to care. All
he wanted was for me to march as ordered. He just kept telling me to get up,
get to the lit square and get going. I was really beginning to hate him.

Jules waited at the far end. �Not
bad,� he said as I reached the last square. I heard the bell ring three times.
That meant a rest. I needed it.

�At each end is one of these
padded horses. You can sit on it for five minutes. Come over here and back up
onto it,� Jules said.

While my feet didn�t hurt much
they were a little sore. Getting off the heels felt pretty good. �We�ll just
sit here until the bell rings again,� Jules said. �Then we�ll show you how you
can get a bite to eat.�

Jules and Arnie gazed out the
window. I stared down the corridor, looking at the length of the aisle and
wondering how I had fallen so many times without hurting myself. I almost
expected to find my body covered in bruises by the time I returned.

A triple bell sounded. Jules
came over to me and took me to the pillar next to the horse. I noticed some
sort of metal plate with a slot in it. �Stick the end of your gag in the hole,�
he said. Once it�s in, pull your tongue out of the slot.�

The prospect of sticking the gag
into something that it might get stuck in wasn�t something I relished. But
being able to pull my tongue out without getting shocked was too much to
ignore. So I did as I was told. And I did get stuck!

�Push in to get water. Turn
clockwise to get food. Turn counterclockwise to release yourself.�

I was thirsty so I pushed
forward. I had to push pretty far before the water flowed into my mouth. I only
got a short squirt before it stopped. So I repeated the process a few times.

�Try the food,� Arnie said.
�It�s cheesecake!�

�Cheesecake?� I thought. �He�s
kidding!�

When I turned the gadget
clockwise a nice paste of mashed cheesecake squirted into my mouth. And it was
awesome! Jules and Arnie must have been laughing their heads off while I kept
twisting my head to get more.

�I guess she likes it. Don�t eat
too much. You�ll have plenty of chances to get another serving. Finish up with
some water and then release yourself. Don�t forget to put your tongue back when
you pull out,� Jules said.

I reluctantly took my last drink
then inserted my tongue into the hole. Almost immediately after I had pulled
out of the hole a single bell rang and my crotch started thumping. My eyes
opened wide. �Get to the lit square. You have sixty seconds to get in
position,� Jules said. �Take your time. You don�t have to rush.

Arnie caught me as I tripped.
�Take your time,� he said as he pointed to the starting square.

I got into position as I had
done earlier. �Feet together, lift right toe, and march,� I said to myself,
repeating Arnie�s instructions in my head. Arnie
didn�t walk beside me this time though. He stayed with Jules at the starting
point. I made it almost half way down before the thumping in my crotch told me
I was doing something wrong. I lifted my knees higher and the thumping went
away.

I had a small piece of food in
my mouth that was annoying. I needed to pull my tongue out of the hole. But I
was marching and I was afraid that if I flipped my head I�d lose the pace. I
didn�t know what to do. I let the food particle sit in the corner of my mouth
under my tongue until I got to the end. I made it without falling!

A single bell rang and I turned
around. The hall was empty! Well, I didn�t have time to worry about being
alone. I knew the computer was waiting for me to start the march again. So I
lifted my toe and started once more.

The march back was a bit rough.
I had two shocks, both of which knocked me off my feet. My legs were tiring and
I was finding it difficult to keep my knees up. I wasn�t having as much problem
with my tongue however. I could keep that in its place pretty easily now.

But when I fell, my tongue
always came out of the hole. I found that if I rolled on my back it made it
easier to put it back in because gravity pulled the weight so that the hole
opened. Still, I couldn�t linger on my back for long. I had to get on my feet
quickly and get to the next square. I really was beginning to hate being a ponygirl!

When I reached the end I
expected three rings of the bell. Instead I got one. �Damn,� I thought. �I have
to make another pass down the hallway.�

When I reached the other end,
after falling twice more, the bell thankfully rang three times. I was beat! I
walked over to the horse and sat down heavily. My feet were killing me. 

I decided to look out the
window. It was still dark out. I figured it was 5 a.m. at the latest. That made the lit buildings easy to
see into, even with the tinted glass. All I could see was the building beside
mine. Looking through the windows I saw another girl marching. I couldn�t see
far but I noticed that she fell after taking only two steps off of the starting
square. I knew exactly what she was going through.

The bell rang three times,
signaling me to get my drink and food. I walked over to the pillar and inserted
the brass gadget into the hole. First the water, then the cheesecake. But when
I turned my head to get the delicious stuff I didn�t get cheesecake. I got corn
pudding. It tasted good but I wanted that cheesecake! �Damn!� I thought. �It
must only be at the other pillar.� But I got my fill of food and water, took a
couple deep breaths and released myself, forgetting to put my tongue back. My
crotch started thumping so I flipped my head and put my tongue in its hole.

&nbsp;

By the time I had finished
marching it was almost noon. �Six
hours!� I thought as I sat one more time on the padded horse. I must have
walked the path a hundred times. My feet hurt and I couldn�t stop this mindless
marching. I had to keep going or my ass was going to be cooked from the inside.
I can�t tell you how many times I fell from the shocks. By the end of the
session my body felt like it had been beaten with a hundred baseball bats.

I was so grateful to see Jules
return that I would have hugged him if my arms were free. I gladly allowed him
to hook me up to the puppy so I could be led back to my room. When we arrived
he asked me some questions to test my ability and desire to whinny. �Did you
enjoy that?� he asked.

I whinnied twice, to indicate
that I did not. My response was barely loud enough for him to find acceptable.
�Louder,� he said as he gave me a light shock. I whinnied louder to satisfy
him.

�Much better. We�re going to
pull the arm binder and the head gear off. The rest stays in place till you�ve
had your second session.�

Jules pulled the mouthpiece out
and set it aside. I started to say �Thank you� when I got a horrible shock. I
let out an expletive and got shocked a second time before falling to my knees.

�No talking until I give
permission,� Jules said. �You�re still in your pony outfit so whinny.�

�Nee-hee-hee-hee,�
I said reluctantly.

�Better. I�ll turn the sensor
off so you can chat with your friends. Consider it a reward for doing so well
on your first day.�








Chapter 6

&nbsp;

Dogs in the Morning

&nbsp;

Dina, the puppy:

&nbsp;

I was in a new cage. It was in a
hallway with so many cages that I couldn�t begin to guess. Both sides of the
aisle were lined with them. Nearly every one had the butt of a girl prominently
displayed behind it with a wagging tail protruding from their spine.

I heeled behind my trainer as
she walked down the long aisle. She wasn�t using a leash. She had the remote,
which she threatened to use should I try and run off. The cubicles were stacked
two high on both sides of the hallway. The upper cage was accessible by a
square platform that rose three feet to the upper cage. I saw two girls being
loaded into their cages. When they were in, the door was closed and the platform
rose above the top cage to be flattened against the wall.

We arrived at an empty cage,
number 37. �Sit,� Harmony commanded. I did so waiting for the next order like
an obedient dog. �You�re in the lower cage. You�re doing very well so far. Just
keep being a good girl and things will work out, OK?� she asked.

I barked as I had been trained.
I even kept my tongue in the little hole.

�Good girl,� she praised.

I�ll disable the gag and let you
get into your cell. Harmony punched a couple buttons on the remote and told me
my gag was turned off. I pulled my tongue from its resting slot and was not
shocked. 

�There�s a hole in the back of
the cage that you can get food and water from. Stick the brass wedge into it
and turn clockwise for food, counterclockwise to release, and press straight in
to get water. OK?�

I barked again. I even felt my
tail start to wag. I felt so humiliated!

�I have to attach a cunt leash to you first. Get up on all fours and crawl
halfway into your cage,� she said as she opened the door. I did as I was told
and stuck my head into the cubicle. I felt her clip a leash to the ring between
my legs. Then she slapped me in the ass and said go on in. The door clicked
shut behind me. �Try and get some sleep,� she said.

They changed the color of the
lights to red shortly afterwards. I tried to remember how to use the gadget in
my mouth. I needed a drink. I carefully crawled forward to the back of the
cubicle and inserted the brass wedge into the hole. It caught. I pressed inward
and got a squirt of water. Then it stopped. So I pulled back and pressed inward
again. That yielded more water. I wondered what sort of food they had so I
turned my head clockwise and discovered that it was some sort of sweet paste.
It tasted like sweetened farina. Well, I hated this stuff but I was hungry so I
twisted my head a half dozen times and swallowed. Then I took another sip of
water before trying to free myself. It only took a second to learn to twist my
head counterclockwise but that moment frightened me. For a brief moment I
feared that I was going to be stuck to the wall all night.

The cubicle was wider so I
started to turn around so I could stare out of the cage. But I felt the tug on
my clit and realized the purpose of the strap. The strap was actually anchored
to the front third of the cage and it prevented me from turning around. I had
to keep facing the back. I gave up on the idea of looking out. I�d get that
opportunity later.

I heard something move above
me.� With only a few inches of space
above my head it was easy to hear the other girl shuffling around. I thought I
heard weeping. I twisted my body to accommodate my rings, my tail and the thing
sticking out of my mouth. In fact I had to lay in the fetal position because
the cage was too short. My heels pressed into the wire gate which annoyed me to
no end because they kept getting stuck in the wire mesh. I had to scoot up
toward the back of the cage, which pulled the strap almost taut. When my
breathing calmed I heard the girl above me. She really was crying.
Unfortunately, so was I.

I slept fitfully. I had never
slept in bondage before and even with the tiring workout and the horrible
torture I had endured I still couldn�t sleep well. My nipples, nose, and clit
hurt quite a bit. And my ass hurt too. The collar was very stiff and wouldn�t
let me get comfortable. And I couldn�t move my fingers either. All this was
annoying. To top it off my legs and abdomen were itchy. And I couldn�t do
anything about them because I couldn�t remove the corset or the boots. I truly
don�t know how I fell asleep.

&nbsp;

The following morning I was
awakened by a shock in my ass. �OW,� I wanted to say. Instead all that came out
was �mmmmph.�

I looked behind me and saw Harmony
staring at me through the gate. �Get your breakfast then put your tongue in
your gag. Hurry up, we have a lot to do today,� she said impatiently.

The food was now something
tasting like mashed banana. It was sickly sweet. I only ate a mouthful or two.
I didn�t like it. I drank lots of water to flush the taste out of my mouth.
Then I inserted my tongue into the hole and backed up against the gate.

While I was eating I heard Harmony
repeat the commands to the girl in the top cage. I twisted my head around and
waited for her to open the gate. When she did she shocked me. �Don�t let me
catch you looking behind you. You just look straight ahead. Clear, puppy?� she
asked.

�Arf!�
I barked loudly. I was getting better at holding my tongue in the gag because
it didn�t come out.

I heard some lockers being
opened. It hadn�t registered before but there were lockers built into the wall
between each pair of cages. I assumed they were putting something in there for
us. There was a lot of banging.

I next heard some sort of
hydraulic machine being used. In fact I heard several of them being used. But I
couldn�t figure out what it was that was making the sound. I dared not turn
around either. But then I heard something large hit the floor behind me. The
hydraulic sound started again, followed by a distant clank.

I heard the door open. Then I
felt her doing something to the strap attached to my clit. Before long she was
pulling me out backwards by it. The strap was now a leash! 

When I turned around I saw the
other girl. She was dressed in black. Harmony called her Blackie. Then she
started calling me Red. I�d have to get used to that.

Blackie had blonde hair coming
out of the top of her hood. I could see her lips lined in bright red lipstick
and her mouth filled with the same gag that I wore. Her outfit was a little
different than mine. Her corset didn�t have front buckles and she wore some
sort of half body suit that covered her shoulders but left her breasts bulging.

Harmony had changed into a more
provocative outfit. It looked like a kinky uniform. She wore black knee high
boots with gold laces going up the front. They had wide three inch heels. She
wore a black leather skirt and a dark green silk blouse. Over top of all of it
she wore a black leather sport jacket with epaulettes. The epaulettes were
decorated with bars as was her collar. I realized that all the other trainers
present wore an identical outfit.

When I looked down the aisle I
saw the other human dogs lining up in front of their cages. There must have
been over a hundred of us. And there were at least fifty trainers and countless
numbers of latex clad slaves.

Both of us had straps attached
to our clit rings. Blackie moved to a designated black spot to Harmony�s left
while I was forced to move to a similar red spot on her right. We had to face
each other with two feet between us. Between our legs she took the straps and
clipped them to small bars in the floor. �Sit,� she said.

�Blackie, show Red how to beg
for inspection,� she ordered.

Blackie got up off her butt and
lifted her front hands, or was it her paws, until she looked like a begging
puppy. Her waist was kept straight and she looked straight ahead. And she
maintained that pose until Harmony gave her the order to �Sit!�

Now it was my turn. �Beg,� Harmony
ordered of me. So I mimicked Blackie�s actions.

�Good girl. Now sit,� she said.

As I watched, two entire lines
of girls were being positioned in like manner. Pairs of hooded slaves were
forced to sit on their asses with their hands in front of them, just like dogs,
just like me. Blackie�s eyes welled with tears. Mine did too.

When we were all in position an
order came through the PA. �Beg for inspection!� At that moment I saw every
girl rise from her butt and go into the begging position. I followed suit as
did Blackie. And we stayed like that for some time while four tall women
dressed in leather skirts, red blouses, and high heeled boots walked up and
down the aisles examining us.

They stopped at our location.
�This is the new pup?� the one woman asked. I turned my head to look at her.
She had dark hair and a riding crop in her hand. 

�Yes ma�am,� Harmony replied
respectfully.

�I can tell. Doesn�t know where
to keep her eyes,� she replied. �You�ll correct that quickly.�

�Yes ma�am,� I heard her say as
I felt a sudden shock in my ass. �Eyes Front!� Harmony yelled.

�Excellent,� the tall woman
said. �When do you expect her to be ready for treats?�

�The normal procedure is to give
them two weeks of physical training. It�s too early to tell if we can move her
any faster. She�s been through a lot in the last day or two. RAAC was pretty
hard on her, ma�am.�

�I�ll leave the decision up to
you. You�ve demonstrated excellent judgment in that area. While it�s early I
can definitely see promise in this one. Keep me posted.�

�Yes, Princess,� Harmony said.

After the procession passed I
heard Harmony sigh. I knew that face. It was Princess Cassandra, the wife of
our Prime Minister. So, she was in charge of the kennels. She must have been
immensely powerful. If she could frighten Harmony, I sure wasn�t going to mess
with her.

After the inspection the latex
clad girls got to work. Several carts were pushed down the aisle each carrying
cleaning supplies. Two girls stopped at our location but went across to the
girls on the other side of the aisle. While I couldn�t watch them because I
wasn�t allowed to turn my head, I did get a good look at what they were doing
to a pair of girls several cages down.

The first thing they did was
remove the belt and the dildos. Doing so required them to temporarily
disconnect the clit strap. I noticed them fumbling around with both hands when
doing so. I assumed, correctly, that there was some sort of lock involved. 

The ever familiar cleaning hose
was plugged into a socket between the girls and each orifice was flushed out.
They had many disposable tips available in the cart. Once they were flushed out
the gags and hoods came off.

The collars, the corsets and
body suits were removed next. This was no small chore since the corset was held
together by a metal rod that ran through many wire loops along their spines. They
had to attach three special ratchet devices and pull the edges of the corset
together in order to pull the wire free. The body suit came off afterwards. The
only things left were the gloves. The girls fully cooperated by allowing them
to pull the long mittens from their hands. They immediately returned their
hands to the begging position and awaited the next step.

The only thing holding the girls
in position was the clit straps. There were no devices installed that could
provide discipline shocks. But neither girl resisted or spoke. They just knelt
erect as the servants worked on them.

As I was watching the girls
being soaped and rinsed the two girls across the aisle had apparently finished.
Now it was our turn. The process was familiar. Our belts were removed and the
clit strap was reconnected and locked in place. After our plugs were removed the
disgusting flushing began. The solution was warm and very filling. I grunted as
they inserted the tip first into my ass, then my sex. But I didn�t move an
inch. Once I was finished, Blackie was cleaned. I�m sure she hated it as much
as I did.

One girl removed my gag, hood
and collar while the other removed Blackie�s. She was a pretty blonde girl. Her
hair was pretty long too. Once they had removed the collar and the hood her
hair fell below her shoulders. She was incredibly gorgeous.

My corset came off next,
followed by the boots. The corset was nothing more than a buckled affair that I
had put on several days ago. My body felt relief to have it removed. Blackie�s
corset was the same as the other girls�. It had the loops down the back and the
wire connector. I watched as the black clad female servant attached three
devices to her back. Then I heard a ratchet sound. A twelve inch wire spine was
pulled out of her back and the corset fell to the floor.

The only things left were our
gloves. These were easily removed by pulling down the zippers. I flexed my
fingers when the first glove was removed. The girl grabbed my hand and gently
placed it back into the begging position. Then she took off the other one.

The cleaning solution was the
same spray on material that had been used in the doctor�s office. Only it was
delivered from a spray hose. �Close your eyes and keep them closed until I tell
you otherwise,� Harmony ordered. �Keep your mouth closed unless you like the
taste of soap.�

I felt something being sprayed
all over me. It foamed and fizzed. The girl massaged every inch of my body from
head to toe. She then took a soft sponge and rubbed my skin down. She scrubbed
the lipstick off my face with it. I kept my eyes and my mouth closed. Finally I
felt warm water being sprayed all over my body. Then came the towels. First my
hair was dried. She wrapped a fresh dry towel around my hair as Harmony said I
could open my eyes. When I did I saw Blackie with a towel wrapped around her
head. We stared at each other while the girls used more towels to dry the rest
of our bodies.

The two servants strived to keep
our cleaning process at the same stage as best as they could. Now that we were all
cleaned they took these long sleeved Lycra suits and squeezed our bodies into
them. Blackie was obviously used to the process. I didn�t find it particularly
difficult but it was an interesting endeavor, nonetheless.

They did me first. The servants
retrieved a number of items from the lockers. Some were obviously mine and
others were Blackie�s. 

The suit was a body suit but it
had short thigh sections. It reminded me of a diver�s outfit. That meant it had
to go over my thighs. But my crotch strap was in the way. The obvious solution
was to disconnect it and have me stand up so I could pull it completely on.
Well, that�s not how it worked. They refused to trust me to the point of
releasing me for that long. Instead one girl held me steady while the other lifted
my toes off the ground so she could slide the suit under my calves. Once she
had gathered the leg material up near the knee she had me shift my weight to
one knee then the other until the material was above the knee. Now, she
disconnected the clit leash and threaded it through the large opening in the
crotch. As one reconnected the strap through the hole the other pulled the
stretchy, shiny red material over my ass.

�Help them out,� Harmony
ordered. �Put your arms in the sleeves.�

Now I had to help them bind me.
And that�s exactly what I did. I put my arms in the outfit and pulled it over
my shoulders. And I suddenly realized that my boobs would remain exposed. There
were reinforced holes for them.

The zipper in the back started
just above my tail. I hadn�t even thought about my tail until now. It was bushy
and blonde. I felt it. I could wag it. �Oh my God,� I mumbled.

As I watched, Blackie�s suit was
installed just like mine. Her breasts bulged as they pulled the zipper up her
back. The suits were obviously designed to make our breasts stand out.

�Very nice,� Harmony said as she
reached down and felt my tits. She felt around the base of each and pronounced
the fit to be perfect.

�Proceed, ladies,� she said to
the servants.

They had a new corset for me. It
was red and very tight. As one held it in place the other attached the ratchet
devices to pull the edges together. I watched one of the girls disappear behind
me with a steel wire. When she returned she was holding two of the three
ratchet devices. The other girl removed the last one. My God! Was it tight?

The girls seemed to know their
business because Blackie�s corset was installed very quickly. As before, she
kept her hands in the begging position just as I had been doing. I figured that
if she was doing it and if the entire group of girls was doing it, then I�d
better do it too. I wasn�t going to resist. There wasn�t much I could do unless
I wanted to tear my clit off. And I had no intention of doing that insane act!

One of the girls produced a
glass of green liquid. She held it to my mouth. I smelled the mint aroma of
mouthwash so I gladly accepted it. She held the glass up until I had a good
mouthful. Then she put her hand gently over my mouth and watched me swish it
around my mouth. Blackie had a similar treatment. When she was satisfied she
had me spit the liquid back into the glass.

The thigh high boots went back
on our legs. As before, we had to keep our toes pointed. These boots were not made for walking! The heels were an
inch longer than the toes. But the knees were padded so it felt good to get
something under them. The marble floor was beginning to get to me.

That was followed by fresh
gloves. Once they were in place we again had to resume the begging position. Harmony
smiled at me when I glanced at her. �Good job, Red,� she said.

Some of the puppies were being
led out now, most of them from the opposite side of the aisle. Each trainer
seemed to have two girls. One girl always had a red corset on her while the
other always had a black one on. There were few girls with red hoods though. 

I was watching the procession of
girls crawl by when I felt the familiar invader in my anus. Well, it had to
happen sooner or later. I was grateful that the probe was greased. It slid in
with some difficulty but it went in. The front device slipped in even easier as
I watched the semi-rigid phallus disappear into my hole.

I noticed that Blackie�s crotch
was being covered by the belt and the strap was being removed. The other girl
must have inserted hers while I was preoccupied with my own penetration. I felt
my own belt being applied. The girl fished the clit ring through both leather
straps and locked them in place with the bell equipped padlock. I still wasn�t
used to that!

�Down,� Harmony said at that
point. We both sat obediently as we watched more girls pad by.

The hoods came next. Our hair
was bundled to the top of our heads and the zipper was closed behind us. Then
the collars were put in place. Only then did the girls apply lipstick.

Harmony took one of the gags and
checked the number against my collar. �Wrong one,� she said as she went back to
the locker and grabbed another gag. �Open, Red,� she ordered. I fully opened my
mouth and took the invader into it. Without being told I bit down firmly and
let her buckle the straps. Once she had finished she patted my head. She lifted
the weight in front of my lips and let me insert my tongue into the slot.

Blackie looked curious. I found
out shortly that she hadn�t worn this new gag. When Harmony inserted it into
her mouth she had to be told how to keep from being zapped. Harmony made her
bark. �Speak,� she said.

As had happened to me several
times the weight dropped and she got zapped. I heard her scream and felt for
her. She quickly learned how to put her tongue back in the little hole by
flipping the weight up. After only a few more tries she could bark loudly and
still keep her tongue in place. But it was as painful a lesson for her as it
had been for me.

Now that we were completely
prepared it was time to move out. That was no simple matter either. Harmony
pulled two leather leashes from her pocket. One was four feet long and the
other six. She took the shorter one and clipped it to Blackie�s clit ring. The
other end she held in front of me. It was made of something resembling an
alligator clip but it had a small pin at the end. It went into my nose, the pin
going into the grommet. I had a nose leash!

Blackie wasn�t any luckier. The
longer leash was clipped to her nose. �Heel,� Harmony ordered. And we marched
outside.

&nbsp;








Chapter 7

&nbsp;

A new dog learns old tricks

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Harmony:

&nbsp;

The girls were doing well. Annette was leading and Dina
was trailing. Annette had been here just two days longer than Dina but she was
so scared that she didn�t dare disobey. They were essentially at the same stage
of their training. 

Our destination was the dog runs. But I wanted to take a
somewhat longer route so the puppies would get used to the idea of heeling to
my orders. So we walked around the grounds a bit so I could admire the ponies
as the marched on the paths. I knew I was an excellent dog trainer but I craved
doing cowgirl stuff too. Maybe I�d be able to afford a pony one day.

I wanted the girls to get a good view of the other form of
animals we trained. I considered ponies to be so much more graceful, their long
legs and hoofed boots making them look so tall. I loved the way their tails
flowed behind them as they marched.

Not that the puppies weren�t fun also. I had the feeling
that the little red one was going to be a joy for Arnie. I was a bit of a
perfectionist and I knew what it would take to move her in the right direction.
She needed a proper balance of coddling and discipline. If I did it right she�d
work out quite nicely.

I really liked Arnie and his wife. My husband and I went
out quite often with them. We often used a large carriage to haul all of us. It
saved on gas, which was now twenty euros a gallon. 

Of course they had a stable and we didn�t. But Arnie
didn�t mind lending us his ponies. He didn�t even charge us for them, like some
of the other owners did. Human power was much cheaper to maintain than a gas
powered vehicle so it helped tremendously when we needed to run an errand.

We eventually did arrive at the dog runs. I disconnected
Red�s leash from Blackie�s cunt then swapped the two
leather straps. China was manning the booth today. We
had known each other for over ten years. �Hi, Hon,� she said. One or two? She
asked.

�One for now. Me and Red are going to play a while. Do you
have a toy kit?�

�Sure, let me get it for you.�

She handed me the standard kit with the various items I�d
be using to play with Red. She was going to learn some tricks today. I was sure
she was not going to like it.

�Thanks,� I said. �We�ll be back in an hour or so. Then
you can have this one too.�

�Take your time. We have plenty of slots open.�

&nbsp;

Dina:

&nbsp;

�Heel,� Harmony said as we walked past the entire series
of dog runs. Blackie was now being led to a gate. With the leash attached to my
nose I couldn�t turn my head to see what they were going to do with her but I
had the feeling that she�d be running up and down the path for the next few
hours. According to what I heard I�d be in one of the dog runs shortly.

There were a lot of gates. The path must have been over
two hundred yards long! I had never seen so many gates. When they had brought
me to this place the last time I didn�t have to walk nearly so far. I had no
idea they had so much area dedicated to teaching girls to become dogs. It was
unbelievable! It was a nightmare.

It took quite some time to walk past all the gates and
arrive on the far side of the facility. We reached a large grassy lawn, perhaps
a hundred yards square. Some girls were fetching balls. Others were fetching
sticks. I was now led to a free area of the lawn.

Harmony bent down and pressed a button on the control. The
gag is disabled. I�m going to remove it now,� she said. �But the collar is
still on. If you do anything other than bark you�ll pay for it. Understand?�

I barked loudly.

I was happy to have the gag out of my mouth. I could move
my lips and breathe easier.

Harmony reached into the bag and retrieved a red ball.
�You know what this is?� she asked.

�Arf!� I said. It was then I
noticed my tail was wagging uncontrollably fast. I couldn�t make it stop! 

�I see you know what we�re going to do,� she said with a
smile. She threw the ball about fifty feet away. �Fetch!�

I just stood there staring at her. Then I screamed as she
pressed the remote button and gave me the worst shock I�d ever received.
�Fetch!� she repeated. I ran after the ball and grabbed it in my mouth. She
yelled at me, �Get it all the way in your mouth.�

I pushed my face onto the ball and used the ground to
press it behind my teeth. I felt like an animal!� I started trotting back and she shocked me
again. �Run back here,� she ordered. And I ran.

She took the ball from my mouth and patted me. �Want to
try again?� she asked. Again my tail started wagging. I got the picture. I
barked once. I knew if I did anything else there was pain to be delivered. She
threw the ball again and I ran off after it. And I got shocked again. �Stay!�
she said angrily.

�Don�t go until I tell you.� I turned to look at her
expectantly. My tail started flipping back and forth. �OK, fetch!�

This time I ran as fast as I could on all fours, pushed the
ball into my mouth, then returned to her holding my gagged mouth up to her
proudly.

�Good girl,� she said as my tail started moving at
hypersonic speed. �Very good girl!�

She threw the ball four more times and each time I rushed
to stuff it in my mouth. I ignored the grass clippings and other stuff that got
into my mouth and just did as she asked. I just didn�t want to get stung again.

She put the ball back after that and took out a leather
covered stick. It had metal rings on each end. She threw that too. �Fetch!� she
said.

I was winded but I ran after the stick with reckless
abandon. When I returned she took it and immediately threw it before I could
turn around to see where it had gone. �Fetch,� she said. This time I had to
rush after it and search for the stick. I searched franticly for it. Then she
called me and showed the stick in her hand. She tossed it in front of me and I
grabbed it. I rushed back to her panting as hard as I ever had.

�Let�s take a break. I have a lot more toys but they can
wait. Lay down on the grass,� she gently ordered.

She wanted me well rested for the next segment of our play
time. To be truthful I almost found the game of fetch to be enjoyable. At least
she wasn�t trying to impose some sort of discipline on me. Well, that wasn�t
true. She wanted me to stay and then only go when she ordered. And she did
shock me when she didn�t like what I was doing. But I understood her reasons.
My God! I was actually accepting my role.

My tail bothered me. It didn�t hurt or itch. The problem was
that it started moving on its own when we started playing our game. It�s like
it was its own entity. I could stop it from wagging if I wanted to and I could
start wagging it too. But sometimes when I wasn�t thinking about it the thing
just started going on its own. It made me really feel subhuman.

I was sucking air pretty heavily. The workout was very
tiring. I was grateful for the respite. As I laid on my side I watched Harmony
sit down on the grass. She sat next to me and petted me. God help me. I liked
it!

We laid there for almost ten minutes. I could see other
girls being trained to fetch and play games. They gave us plenty of room so I
didn�t get a good look at what they were throwing. One girl was fetching some
sort of strange object that looked like a giant jack. But I couldn�t see it up
close.

�Do you like Frisbee?� Harmony asked as she continued to
pet me.

�Arf!� I barked.

�Get up. Let�s see how you handle this.�

I got up and my trainer told me to stay. She pulled a
cloth Frisbee from her bag and walked about ten feet away. �Try and catch it in
mid air.�

I was all ready when she threw it. She had a good
technique. She spun it quickly with a flick of the wrist but threw it slowly
toward me. It nearly hovered a foot above my head. I leapt for it and missed it
with my teeth. I nearly cursed but instead just grabbed the toy with my teeth
and ran back to Harmony. �You almost had it,� she said. �Let�s try again. Go
back to where you were and wait,� she ordered.

I trotted about ten feet away and turned. �Ready?� she
asked.

�Arf!� I barked as my tail
started wagging uncontrollably.

�Here it comes!� The disk flew right toward me and sailed
over my head. I quickly turned around and saw it sail backwards just slightly.
It was at eye level. I jumped up and grabbed it. I got it! �Good girl!� she
said. �Bring it here!�

I was really proud! I caught it. She patted my head and gave
me a cream mint. �Very good girl!,� she kept saying.��������������� 

We played like that for another twenty minutes. She�s
throw the Frisbee and I�d try to catch it. I learned how to judge its speed and
behavior more and more with each toss. In the beginning I only caught it once
out of every five times. By the end I could catch nearly two out of three. I
was pretty proud of that.

When we finished our fetch time she let me lay down again.
�You have to get some time in the runs,� she said. �I�ll let you rest before I
take you. You were awesome. Never had a puppy take to the tricks so quickly.
I�m really proud of you,� she said as she now began massaging my shoulders.

I felt so strange. On one hand I felt humiliated to have
to play the role of a dog. On the other hand I felt proud to be able to do all
the tricks and follow commands as I had been given. But there was something
more developing. I didn�t want to admit it but I was beginning to develop an
admiration for my trainer. At the very least I felt we were connecting
extremely well. I actually understood her.

The gag was back in and we were going back to the dog
runs. I had to put my tongue back in its little home and march and bark like I
had been taught. As a reward for being such a good puppy she didn�t use the
nose leash. She just told me to heel. I did as she asked and followed
obediently behind her. And I didn�t do it out of fear of punishment. I did it
because I wanted to follow my trainer.

I spent the next two hours running up and down the dog
run. It was boring. There were girls crawling on each side of me. When I
reached the end the leash went slack and let me stick the brass wedge into a
slot in the end. It was a water only slot and the hole was spring loaded. I had
to press really hard to get the thing to give me water. After twenty seconds or
so the leash tugged at my collar and I had to make a trip down and back. And I
was given the chance to drink again.

Harmony watched me march for a short time then she
disappeared. I heard her mention to her friend in the booth that she was going
for breakfast. She would be grabbing Blackie and me in a little while. I didn�t
know what was in store for us.








Chapter 8

&nbsp;

A Lesson
for the Powerful

&nbsp;

Arnie:

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

You know, when almost everything
is perfectly set for a nice thing to happen, that�s when someone throws a
monkey wrench in the day�s plans! Case in point:

I had been watching our puppy
being trained via the remote camera hookup in our facility. We had a few new
girls �stewing� in the black rooms. They had been in there for two days and
seemed to be ready to strip. While I waited for the right moment I watched our
puppy and the pony named Cleo learn their trade. The puppy was awesome. I
hadn�t seen a girl take to the act so quickly in years. Cleo wasn�t as good a
pony as she was comfortable with the idea of submitting. She was also a calming
voice in the herd. I liked her for that but she needed to come a long way to
become prized stock.

As I was observing all this a call
came from the director. I needed to pop up to her office ASAP. Something had
come up. I knew it right then and there that something bad was about to happen.
I hate walking into situations like that!

The secretary waved me right in. There I found the
director, Janet James waiting. �Good afternoon. So, what�s up?� I asked
brightly. I was in a good mood.

�We have a problem. You know that deal you worked out
with the P.M.?�

�Yes,� I said expectantly, waiting for the shoe to
drop.

�Well, the princess is about to throw a wrench in the
works.�

�I was about to scream at the top of my lungs but
instead kept my cool.�

�The deal comes from the P.M. She can�t rescind it.�

�True, but if you tell her that, you�ll blow our
little gift. I really would prefer to keep our illustrious leader on our good
side.�

�That means making an enemy of the princess. Hmmm. I
think I need to take this to a higher authority.�

�Should I leave?�

�No. This shouldn�t take too long.�

I called a private number on my cell and punched in a
security code to get past the automated systems. �Good afternoon my dear
friend,� the Prime Minister said to me, recognizing the code that was reported
to him. What can I do for you?�

I explained the situation to him. Cassandra was going
to make a play for my puppy and I really wanted her for myself and my wife. My
wife had seen the video feed of her playing this morning and called me. She was
very excited. Losing it would be a huge disappointment.

The Prime Minister�s solution shocked me. �Have my
wife arrested,� he said. I was nearly knocked on the floor by the order.

�Did I hear you correctly Excellency? I am to arrest
her? On what charge?�

�There will be no charge. You will simply take her
prisoner and hold her until the gifts are ready. On second thought it would be
better if she learned a little humility. Put her in the kennel. But do not let
anyone know who she is.�

�Sir, in order to carry out this order I�ll need you
to inform a few people so I do not get charged with treason. Kidnapping the
princess would be a capital offense.�

�Tell me what you need,� he said.

I handed the phone to Jane. She talked on the cell for
a few minutes then called her secretary. The head of security and his captain
were called to her office. When they had arrived a short time later their jaws
dropped almost as fast as hers had when I let her in on the plan.

�I need to confirm this,� Colonel Peter Caldwell said.

�You have the Minister�s private number and security
code. I insist you call him. I could see the colonel shaking as he dialed the
number. It was a rare sight to see him in this mood. He had always been a rock
in difficult situations.

�Yes, Your Excellency. I�ll do whatever he says. Thank
you, Sir! Thank you very much, Sir!�

He folded the phone and stuffed it in his pocket
staring at me with a look of bewilderment. �Well?� his female companion,
Captain Anne Samuels, asked.

�Captain Samuels,� he ordered. �You�ll immediately go
to the veterinarian�s office and find our dear doctor�s secretary. You will
inform her to cancel all appointments after three p.m. She is not to let anyone know about this except those
who are waiting for service. Clear?�

�Perfectly, Sir!�

�Next you will approach the good doctor and inform him
to call our Prime Minister as you just saw me do. You will not discuss the
matter with the doctor. He will be notified of the minister�s edict by the
Prime Minister himself. I need not remind you that absolute secrecy must me
maintained.�

�Understood, Sir!�

�Dismissed.�

As the female soldier walked out of the office we
discussed the plan. Pete was a strategist, having been a key figure in our
military service for the last twenty years. His post as head of Horwath�s security team was a reward for his loyalty,
especially when times were difficult.

His mind had formulated a plan even before he had
completed the conversation with the Prime Minister. Both Jane and I knew it
would be brilliant yet simple to pull off. We marveled in its simplicity.

�Arnie, you will be in charge of the training regimen.
You must find a way to keep the princess isolated while she is washed. The
minister does not wish the trainer to know her identity if at all possible. He
said you know how to do a double blind training.�

�Double blind training?� Jane asked.

�That can be done. We take one trainer into our
confidence and have her clean her. Once she�s hooded we hand her off for her
training.�

�Any idea who to bring into this group?�

Jane spoke immediately. �Harmony.�

�She�s perfect,� I said.

&nbsp;

Peter continued describing the plan, obviously taking
full charge of the operation. �Arnie, you will call the princess and tell her
that you�re presenting your puppy as a gift to her. Tell her that we�re making
some modifications to her tongue that will make her serve her needs better.
You�d like to invite her to watch the process. Can you do that?� he asked.

�We�re old friends. I�ll do it right now.�

I dialed a new number on my cell. �Hey Babe! Wanna get shit faced and fuck each other�s brains out?� I
asked.

�Arnie!� she screamed as I smiled at the shocked faces
around me. �You must have some of your coworkers listening in,� she said. �So
what�s up?�

�Well Princess, I have this little present I�d like to
give you. I heard you�re in the market for a miniature. I was thinking of
looking in the catalog for something a little nicer, maybe one with a little
more meat underneath. So I was wondering if you�d accept her as your personal
pet?�

�Arnie, are you sure? I don�t want to impose,� she
said excitedly.

�Absolutely. I insist. In fact, the good doctor is
going to be working on her tongue this afternoon. He intends to decorate it
with diamonds and rubies. He was wondering if you�d like to be here to test the
new studs out personally. I�d imagine her look of fear would be priceless.�

�How could I say no? I�m free at 6,� she informed me.

�Your Highness, the only time that the doctor has free
today is from 3 to 4. Can you rearrange your schedule?�

�I�m the Princess! I can do anything I want. I�ll be
there!�

�We�ll need to go to full lockdown, I�m afraid,� the
colonel said.

�For the princess?� Jane asked. �We just go to level
two normally.�

�Considering the situation I�d like to go full bore on
this.�

�It�s your show,� I said. �Go for it.�

�We�ll go red at 2:40,�
he declared. �Will you inform your people?� he asked Jane.

�I�ll handle it.

�Speaking of handling, I�d better go talk to Charlie.
I bet he�s already blown a gasket or two.�

It took a few minutes to shuffle through the hallways
and arrive at the hospital. The secretary saw me and shook her head in a
serious manner. �You don�t want to go in there! Wait till he�s done with the
pony,� she said.

I waited ten minutes. The doors opened and a leather
clad ponygirl was led by a leash out of the treatment
room. The trainer was Coleen Lindholm,
one of our most beautiful pony trainers. �Madame,� I said bowing to her.

�Arnie!� she said laughing. �You handsome devil. Where
have you been? I haven�t seen you in almost two years.�

We hugged. She was an awesome beauty. �Been running all
over the place. This your new charge?�

�Yea, just came in. Special order. Nice and tall. The
CEO of Latex Euro took her. Her twin just graduated. I did her too. Awesome
trotter!�

�Let�s get together sometime. Maybe you and Lenny can
come over.�

�I�ll check my schedule. Hey, gotta
get this one in the corridor before she gets bored. I�ll call you.�

�Later,� I said as she led her pony out the door.

I turned around to see a red faced, semi-bald head
staring at me. �You have something to do with this?� he said, balling his hands
into fists.

�Ears only,� I said.

With those words his eyes opened wide. He knew I
didn�t invoke that level of security in the hospital unless it was absolutely
imperative to keep things quiet. We had served in the border wars just two years
ago when our northern friends invaded. I saved the doc�s life and got the
Supreme Medal of Valor. 

�In here,� the doc said pointing to his office.

He closed the door as I walked in. �OK, what�s this
about?� he asked.

�Special job,� I said.

�So? We�ve done special orders before. There was never
a need to go to this much trouble. What�s going on? You planning on turning the
princess into a puppy?�

�Exactly,� he said.

�Right. OK, who is the subject really?�

�Cassandra.�

�By who�s orders?�

�Who do you think?�

�I just talked to him. He didn�t mention anything
about this. All he told me was that he�d be visiting the facility.�

�He�s visiting?
Shit! That son of a bitch!� I screamed.

�Seems as though we were both kept in the dark. You�d
better get your affairs in order.�

�Do you have all the details worked out? Does he care
if the other pets see who�s fetching Frisbees beside them?�

�He wants her treated like any other dog.�

�I can�t see that happening unless the trainer never
sees her face.�

�Already got that figured out. Harmony will clean her
up personally in the isolation quarters. Probably not a bad idea. I�d bet that
once we get the gag and the collar off she�s curse like a blue streak.�

�I could feed her some mother-in-law juice,� Charlie
offered.

�Nah, let her scream. Sooner or later she�ll bend.�

�How long will she be in? He�s not making her
permanent, is he?�

�No. Just a couple weeks. But she�s not to know that.�

�What�s she done to deserve this?� he asked me.

�Not sure. But I�d guess she�s been a little rough on
the livestock. I know the PM has warned her before.�

�Well any lesson worth learning��

�Yea!

&nbsp;

I returned to director�s office. Harmony had arrived.
She had the puppy in tow with her. She was sitting obediently. �How�s she
doing?� I asked.

�She�s amazing. If you don�t take her, I will!�

�I thought you said you�d never own one because you
always can enjoy their company.�

�This one changed my mind.�

�She�s that good?�

Harmony smiled.

�Do you object having her along?� Peter asked me.

�Not at all. She�s the bait!�

We waited twenty minutes. The phone rang and Jane
answered it. �They�re here,� she said.

A procession of gold clad domestics trailed the royal
couple. Your Excellency, Your Highness!� Jane said. �We�re honored.�

�Jane,� Prime Minister Horwath
said. �You know my wife.�

�Of course, Princess. We�ve had many pleasant
encounters. That�s why we like our puppies.�

�Jane, it�s not polite to talk of such things in
public,� she said smiling.

�Of course, Your Highness. The doctor�s schedule is
quite full. You�re aware of the recent increase in demand. Shall we head to the
good doctor�s office?�

�We must get his team some help!� the princess
declared.

We proceeded out of the administrative building and
over to the small hospital. The grounds were unusually empty, the result of the
lockdown. The only training that was still proceeding was the corridors. The
ponygirls were still trotting in the narrow buildings. Since they were locked
into the buildings, there was no reason to deny them training. The puppies were
all in their cages. It was almost three p.m. anyway. An extra rest wouldn�t hurt them before their afternoon dog
walks in the runs.

We entered the main reception area and found the
doctor waiting with his secretary. �Doctor, a pleasure,� the princess said,
wrapping her arms around him. I saw the awkward smile on his face. He wasn�t
hiding his mixed emotions as well as we were. Well it was showtime.

�Harmony,� he said as they separated. �Why don�t you
take our little friend into the new prep room? She�ll need to be prepared and
her mouth will need to be disinfected. You�ll find two domestics in there to
assist.�

�Heel,� Harmony said. The puppy reluctantly walked
behind her, her gait obviously hampered by her fear. Harmony took her through a
pair of doors as if she were to be prepped. Instead she exited the hospital via
a rear exit and returned her to the kennel. Her work was done.

�She�s taking quite some time,� the princess said
after we had waited roughly five minutes.

�She�s not coming back, Princess,� I announced.
�There�s been a change in plans.�

�Oh?�

�Dear, would you take your clothes off for these
people?� the minister asked.

�Would I what?�

�Remove your clothes. I�d like these people to see my
wife�s naked body. Any objections?�

Cassandra seemed confused. �What�s going on, Siggy?� she asked; her tone obviously anxious.

�We�re going to teach you a little humility. I�ve
tired of your bitching so I thought it would be fitting to actually make you
into a bitch. I think you�ll enjoy the education.�

�Fuck you!�

�Promise?� the minister said sardonically.

�You can�t, Siggy,� she
cried. �Please don�t do this! I�ll be good. I swear!�

�If you get into the outfit right now we�ll only make
it a few days. If you make us fight you I�ll keep you in the kennels for a
year. What�s it going to be?�

�You can�t do this to me. I�m the princess!�

�And I�m the Prime Minister. I believe that means I
get anything I want?�

�You do,� she said submissively.

�Well?�

Cassandra began stripping. Her clothes slowly piled up
on the table next to her as her bare skin was revealed to us. We watched as the
haughty female slowly became a puppy. First we broke her down and subdued her
by making her remove her clothes voluntarily. Then we�d get her mounted to the
table. She�d be barking before she left.

The last piece of clothing was her panties. �You never
looked more beautiful, my dear. She�s an exquisite creature, wouldn�t you all
say?� the minister asked.

�Arnie, Jane, Charlie,� she pleaded. �Don�t do this. I
thought you were all my friends.�

She covered up her breasts and cried. Her tears were
genuine. It was pitiful. It was pathetic. �Arnie, she�s in your hands. I�ll expect
her delivered in the usual timeframe. Remember my orders. She�s to be trained
with the other puppies. She is not to receive any special treatment due to her
status. Clear?�

�Absolutely, Your Excellency.�

�Siggy, No, Please!� she
cried. But his back was to her and he refused to watch.

�Don�t leave me!�

�Leave you? My dear, I�m not leaving. I�m just moving
over here to get a better vantage point. I don�t want to miss a thing.�

�You bastard,� she screamed. She lunged for him but
two of the gold sheathed females blocked her way, dragging her to the ground.
�You�ll pay. I swear!�

�Now that�s the princess I remember!� the minister
said.

�Arnie, I tire of her antics. Shall we get things
moving?�

�Secure her to the table,� I ordered.

All four girls lifted Cassandra and took her to the
table. As had been done with so many puppies her arms were secured above and
below the elbows. Her thighs were clamped as were her calves. She fought every
step of the way, cursing our existence and bringing into question whether I had
carnal knowledge with my maternal relatives.

Once she was secure the doctor walked to the side door
and had two domestics come in. He simply said, �Clean her.�

Cassie�s introduction to the business end of the
flushing hose was fairly colorful. Her screams weren�t out of pain at this
point. That would come later. The insults were simply her frustration coming
out. She always got her way. Well, that would change now.

�Siggy, if I ever get out of
this so� Oh no!� she screamed as the cold water invaded her bowels. �Don�t do
that!� But the black clad assistants held the hose in place as they had done
many times before. A powerful jet of water was injected into her anus, and then
extracted. The sound of the water and waste being suctioned was loud and
disturbing. The process was repeated several times. By the end Cassie was quite
subdued.

A similar procedure was performed on her vagina.
Cassie whimpered while they performed the task. �Please!� she cried.

We kept the emotional atmosphere as calm as possible.
We treated her like any other girl being transformed. As our minister
requested, we allowed Cassie to experience the exact same indoctrination as all
the other pets.

The attendants continued the routine. The next step
was to apply soap to her hair as well as the rest of her body. A self foaming
spray was applied to her hair, torso, and legs. In short order she was covered
in suds. The girls began using sponges to work the lather. Of course they used
their hands to work it into her hair. Before long the soap began to run off of
her onto the table. A light rinse from a hose was used to help get the
remaining soap off her body. Her hair was thoroughly rinsed. Finally the used a
large number of towels to dry her body, using a blow dryer to assist getting
the last of the water out of her hair.

�Your Excellency, we�re ready for piercing. Are you
sure of this? Once her clit is pierced there�s no going back,� I asked.

�Absolutely. You will give her the full treatment. She
will be a dog.�

�Doctor?�

�Measurements if you will ladies.�

�Measurements were taken up to the point where they
wanted to measure her mouth. That�s when she refused to cooperate. �Open your
fucking mouth,� Charlie said.

�Fuck you!� she yelled.

�If you don�t let us measure you for a proper gag
we�ll use a generic one. It�s much more severe and extremely uncomfortable.
Sir,� he said turning to the prime minister, �I need to move this along. I�m
terribly backlogged. I could use much more severe methods but I implore you.
Please talk to her.�

�Cassandra, we were going to do this for only a few
days. Due to your antics I was about to increase that to two weeks. But your
behavior has been so obnoxious I�ve decided to increase your time in bondage. I
told you that I would if you refused to cooperate.�

�No, don�t!�

�Six weeks! If you protest one more time I�ll make it
three months! Now stop fucking around and do exactly as they say.�

She stared at him knowing that he wasn�t kidding. She
had seen him sentence insubordinate officers in his army to long prison
sentences just for speaking out of turn. He was a tyrant and she had no way to
escape his grasp. She nodded and remained silent.

�Doctor, please continue.�

The doctor donned rubber gloves in anticipation of the
piercing. He ordered the attendants to install the head brace. Cassie didn�t
like that at all. But she didn�t curse too much, especially when she noticed
the minister wagging a finger at her.

The piercings were all installed without too much
excitement. Cassie bit her tongue when her clit and breasts were ringed. Tears
ran down her eyes when the nose grommet was pressed into place. She knew at
that point she was doomed.

The process to create the gear for the puppy took far
less time than we had anticipated. As the doctor was piercing her nose a bell
sounded on the machine. �Running really quick today. Probably because we�re in
lockdown. Nobody else is using the system,� Doc said.

In order to put the body suit on her we needed to free
her legs. The clit ring was used to hold her in place while her legs were
freed. We attached a chain from the table to the ring and threatened to apply
an electric shock if she didn�t cooperate. This, in fact, was a lie. There was
no means to apply current that way. But she didn�t know that so she remained
still while the girls slipped the red spandex suit over her legs.

Once the outfit was over her thighs the clit chain was
threaded through the slot in the suit and reattached. The girls also secured
her thighs and calves again. We didn�t trust her enough to release both arms at
the same time. So the girls released her right arm first, slid it into the
suit, and then reattached it to the table. Then the left arm was inserted and
secured again.

��Do you want
her to have a tail, minister?�

�Can it be amputated later?� he asked.

�Yes, but she may get ghost stimulation when we do,�
Charlie said.

�Meaning?�

�After we amputate she will always feel the tail, even
if it is no longer there.�

�It will help her remember the experience. You will
install the tail,� the minister ordered.

�No! Please don�t!�

�What did I tell you about resisting?� the minister
asked angily.

�Please Siggy, don�t go that
far.�

The minister walked over to his helpless wife.
�Cassie, dear. You need this. I�m only doing this to you because I love you so
much.�

�You love me? This is a fine way to show it!� she said
sardonically. She didn�t expect a response but Siggy
had one for her.

�Yes, isn�t it? Do you think I�d do this to someone I
didn�t give a rat�s ass about? Of course I love you. I want to possess you.�

�As your dog,� she spit at him.

�For now, yes. Don�t you want to serve me? Isn�t that
what you promised at our wedding? �To love and to serve, till death.� Weren�t
those the words you used?�

�Yes, but I never expected to have to do this! Siggy, can�t we work something out?�

He took her head and put his shoulder under it,
hugging her. �I can�t. You need this too much. Now be a good girl and let these
people work. And one other thing. They are doing this on my orders. Don�t blame
anyone but me for this. Clear?�

�They went along with it though.�

�At my insistence. I�m very proud of them actually.
When I told them to do this they had a plan in place in only a few hours. I am
very impressed, aren�t you?�

�You mean all this was thought out today? You didn�t
put much thought into it?�

�Oh, I�ve thought about it for months. But when you
threatened to take that puppy that I gave to Arnie��

�You gave him a puppy that was worth a quarter million
dollars?�

�Yes.�

�Why?�

�He did something for me that I can�t discuss. The job
is worth every penny.�

�Then it�s not finished yet.�

�Soon. Let�s get finished. Arnie, what�s next?�

�Doc, you want to get your DNA sample? Girls, let�s
get a corset and collar on her.�

As Doc was getting the sample for her tail he asked
for the style. We left it to the minister. He suggested any sort of fur tail.
Most girls get the bushy fur tail, ala cocker spaniel. But when he looked at
the tail he said it didn�t look right for her. He instead picked a thinner
beagle tail. The thin root was produced almost instantly by the machine. The
feeling of the penetrating nerve endings caused her to scream to high heaven.

With the tail in place the girls installed the corset,
and collar. She remained impassive as these were installed. With these items
now in place the doctor took the two plugs, greased them, and then inserted
them into both lower openings. Her mouth fixed into a perfect oval shape as her
anus was spread by the invader. Her reaction was equally priceless when her
vaginal probe was inserted. 

With all the gear in place from the neck down it was
time for her head to be addressed. I decided to take over here. I examined the hood
carefully and pressed it to her face. After pulling her hair through the top
opening, I pulled the zipper down and tucked it under the collar. I let one of
the girls apply some lipstick before taking the gag from Charlie.

�Your Excellency, this is the new gag. Perhaps you�ve
heard of it.�

�Yes, as a matter of fact I was briefed by Cassie,� he
informed me.

�Good,� I said, turning to her. �I won�t have to
explain anything to her.�

I approached her with the gag and held it to her lips.
She grimaced as if to cry then opened her mouth. I pressed it in place and
began fastening the straps. I went over every buckle until it fit perfectly.
Her teeth seated perfectly in the groove and every strap was tight. As I held
the weight up to open the hole I told her to insert her tongue. Harmony arrived
just in time.

�Oh good, you�re back,� I said.

�Not a problem. I put Red back in her cage and came
back as soon as I could. Oh, and I found a spot for the princess. Diane just
had a girl graduate. She can take her.�

�Isn�t Diane a little inquisitive for this operation?�
Jane asked.

�She�s the only one with an empty cage. The next
opening won�t be till next week.�

�Well, you can�t give her to Diane! She�ll start
asking questions as soon as she�s told that she can�t see the puppy without her
mask.�

�Yea, I see your point. Well, then just let me train
her. I can stay impartial.�

�Are you sure?� I asked.

�I�d like to think so.�

�Minister?� Jane asked.

�It�s up to you. If you think this girl can train my
wife properly then I won�t interfere.�

�The job�s yours,� Jane said.

�Is she ready?� Harmony asked.

�The boots just came out of the machine. Once the
girls put them on her she�s all ready to go. Here�s the remote,� Charlie said
as he handed it to her.�

Harmony allowed the girls to put the pointed toed
boots on Cassie then enabled the remote. She pointed it at Cassie�s collar. We
all heard the beep. Then she pressed a button or two and told Cassie that the
device was live. And so the training began in earnest.








Chapter 9

&nbsp;

The Bitch becomes a Bitch

&nbsp;

Cassie:

&nbsp;

How did I get into this mess? Siggy was always saying that he thought I�d be a good
slave. He often threatened to put me in harness and have me drag him around
town in his pony cart. I, of course, knew he�d never do that to the princess. I
had too many friends in high places. If he wanted his projects to keep moving
forward then he�d have to deal with me.

I guess he found some dirt on
the little weasels that supplied his factories with workers and materials. He
must have intimidated them in order to win them over. Then again, maybe their
loyalty to me wasn�t nearly as secure as I had hoped. Now I was going to pay
for my naivet�. 

When I heard the beep of the
remote I knew exactly what it meant. I was now a dog. The collar would prevent
me from speaking. My ass was going to get cooked sooner or later. It would take
time to learn the routine, even though I had taught countless girls how to bark
and fetch. Now the shoe was on the other foot. Dammit!�

�What bothered me most at the moment was the
fact that I knew Harmony was good. She�d make me a dog regardless of how I felt
about the idea. I had three puppies trained by her and they had all been
delivered full of life and excited to please me. Yes, they were excited to
please me. I couldn�t even begin to imagine what she had put them through in
order to eliminate the dread and depression that this role would have bred in
them. I was really worried about that!

�Speak!� she ordered.

Of course I resisted. I suddenly
realized how stupid I was when I felt the jolt of a high level shock in my ass.
I was zapped hard just like I had done to countless puppies who displayed the
same behavior. To top it off I pulled my tongue out of the gag and got shocked
a second time. She must have had the punishment setting set high. It really
hurt.

�Get your tongue back in its
hole,� she urged. I knew that if I didn�t I�d get shocked in the ass again. I
flipped my head back and stuck my tongue in the hole. �Good girl,� she said
calmly.

�Now speak!� she said again.

�Arf!�
I said. Jesus I hated this.

The lessons on how to answer
questions, bark and hold my head were old hat. I had reminded puppies and
ponies how to behave more times than I could count. What I realized was that
she never lost her cool. Her tone was calming, even when she was threatening. I
really was amazed at how calm she remained.

They released me and clipped a
leash to my collar. �Heel,� Harmony ordered.

And I crawled.

&nbsp;

Cleo:

&nbsp;

I found my fellow ponies all
dressed in their spandex suits, corsets, boots, etc. having a nice late
breakfast. I was told to be ready for another session around six in the
evening. . So I had plenty of time to eat and relax. I needed the time to
recover.

I wasn�t used to the chains yet.
I suppose that would come with time. I was chained as before with cuffs on my
wrists and ankles. It was difficult to walk the thirty feet to the cafeteria
but I made it there somehow, hobbling along while using the walls for support
as I inched my way down the corridor.

I found several girls there.
Bonnie, Brenda, Angie, Megan, and Carrie were sitting at the table. The remaining
girls were nowhere to be found. �Hi, Gang. I�m bushed!,� I said jovially.

Every girl, especially Bonnie
and Carrie, were breathing heavily. The seemed reluctant to bother to look in
my direction. All they could do was drink their grape juice and sulk. I, being
the happy sort, didn�t like seeing people upset. I took it upon myself to try
and cheer the girls up.

�Did everyone get a good morning
workout? I don�t know about you but I�m really beat!� I said jovially.

Unfortunately
the girls weren�t exactly in the mood for humor and I got several looks that
would kill. �I think you missed your calling,� Bonnie said. �Maybe you should
be a trainer rather than a horse. I�m sure you can get a riding crop real cheap
somewhere, maybe even convince one of the trainers to get you some nice
jodhpurs and boots.�

�Chill,�
Brenda said. �She�s just trying to cheer us up. She didn�t mean anything by
it.�

�I
know. I�m sorry. I�m just so frustrated. I don�t even know how many times I got
shocked. I can�t believe they made me march for five hours. Five hours, in
heels, can you believe it! These monsters are sick.�

�We
all are going through the same thing,� Brenda said. 

Suddenly
we noticed a light in the corridor. There was a low red railing that had been
turned on. 

�Who�s
not here?� Brenda asked with a note of concern in her voice.

�Melanie,
Angie, Jo, and Elaine,� I said. �Why?�

�Someone�s
screwed up,� Carrie said. �Someone just got put in a puppy suit.�

�Who?�
Megan asked.

�We�ll
find out shortly,� Brenda said. 

From
down the hall we heard a single bark followed by the sound of scampering and
scraping. A few seconds later we saw the source of the commotion. She was
completely enclosed in a body suit. She was on all fours, wearing padded gloves
and boots. The toes were pointed and sported no heels. 

We
watched through the Plexiglas partition as she scampered to a lit area of the
wall. When she arrived she barked loudly. The light went out and she crawled to
the next area that was lit. We all pitied her.

�Can
you figure out who it is?� Bonnie asked.

�I
think it�s Melanie. I told her to chill. She must have pissed someone off!�
Brenda offered.

�How
long does she have to do that? That must be horrible.�

�You
have no idea,� Carrie returned. �The crawling is the easy part. Wait till they put
her in the cage. That�s the real horror! Constant oral sex for hours on end.�

��I don�t think I could do that!� Megan said.

�You
wouldn�t have a choice. The system is designed to punish you if you resist in
even the slightest way. You have to service male and female organs for two
weeks straight!�

�No!�
I said.

�That�s
what happens to girls that try to escape. I learned my lesson the hard way. I�m
not taking that route again, let me tell you.�

�Isn�t
there anything we can do?� I asked.

�Are
you nuts?� Brenda asked. �Maybe you want to spend some time crawling next to
her.�

�Still,
it�s so humiliating!� I said.

�I
know,� Brenda said. �But she has only herself to blame. Some people just need a
harsh lesson.�

Elaine
and Jo had arrived some time later, each exhausted. They saw Melanie crawling
around in the hallway and just shook their heads. �I told her!� Elaine said.

The
barking and scampering continued for hours. Some of us were really upset by the
spectacle. I know I was. Poor Melanie just kept crawling from panel to panel,
barking at each light. The barks were occasionally punctuated by a loud scream.
It was obvious that she had to reach each location before a certain time limit
expired or she�d get shocked. I�m sure the experience was breaking her to
tears.

At
some point her Jules came and connected a leash to her collar. She was led into
the cafeteria so we could all get a good look at what it was like to become a
dog. She sat on command at his heel. It was so sad.

�Melanie
has been a bad girl, haven�t you?� he said.

Melanie
barked loudly, �ARF!�

�Melanie
will bark when asked any question. She can�t talk and she can�t refuse to
answer. The collar guarantees that,� he explained.

�What
did she do?� I asked.

�She
attacked my assistants while she was being dressed. We decided that if she
didn�t like being a pony that a short stint as a puppy would show her the
errors of her ways.�

�How
long does she have to stay like that?� Megan asked.

�We�ll
let her go a week like this and see how she behaves. We can keep her like this
as long as it takes. Well, if there are no more questions, Melanie has to be
taken outside for some basic body functions. Say goodbye, Melanie,� 

�ARF!�
she barked.

On
command Melanie dropped behind Jules� left heel and was led away. We were so
upset for her. We wanted to help her so much but there was absolutely nothing
to do. She was going to have to suffer the consequences of her own actions.








Chapter 10

&nbsp;

Melanie�s plight

&nbsp;

Melanie:

They
held me down and handcuffed me. I just didn�t want to be put in that pony
outfit again. They couldn�t do this to me! But no matter how hard I fought they
had a way to stop me. It was like they were trained to subdue me.

The
latex clad girls used cattle prods on me until they had me cornered. I
eventually cowered into the corner of the room staring at their blank,
ball-gagged faces. Jules walked in after them and just shook his head. �What�s
your problem, Melanie?�

�I
can�t take this anymore! Please! You have to let me go.�

�You
know you broke the rules here. I told you not to resist them. Now you have to
deal with the consequences.�

�Consequences?
What sort of consequences?�

�Stand
up,� he said.

As I
did so he turned me around and handcuffed my wrists behind my back. �You�ll
learn to be more obedient after a little attitude adjustment,� he said. �Get on
your knees.�

�Linda,
let�s have a gold body suit,� he ordered.

One
of the girls went to the wall cabinet and retrieved a gold top. It was made of
heavy latex and sported a zipper down the back. �We�ll need a control collar
too,� he said.

Soon
I was wearing a heavy leather collar. It was so wide that I had to keep my head
tilted backwards. He explained to me that the collar had an electrical shock
device built in. His remote could punish me to any degree he desired from a
small jolt to a paralyzing, painful blast. �You�ll do as you�re told. Clear?�

I
was so frightened that all I could say was, �Yes, sir.�

With
the collar and the body suit in place, a body suit that allowed my breasts to
bulge through tight rings in the chest area no less, they brought out the
gloves and the boots. That�s when I realized what they were doing to me. �No,�
I said. �Don�t do this to me. Please!�

�It�s
for your own good. You broke the rules. You have to pay the price.�

�I�m
sorry,� I said, tears streaming down my cheeks.

�I
know,� Jules replied. �It�s only going to be a week or so. Don�t make it worse
than it has to be. Now let�s get the rest of the gear on you.�

�I�m
sorry,� I said again as they slipped the gloves on my arms and the boots on my
legs. That left the hood and the dildos, which went in last. As one last bit of
preparation they slipped a long tube over my tail and tightened it so it stuck
straight up in the air like a flag. �That�s to prevent you from tripping over
your own tail,� Jules explained.

Jules
pressed a couple buttons on the remote and I heard the collar beep. �I�m� Ahhhhh!� I screamed.

�No
more human talk,� he warned. �From now on you have to sound like a dog. Now,
listen carefully. You may not produce any sounds that appear even remotely
human. You may not even whimper or cry. If you do you�ll get shocked. In
addition the collar has a query sensor. If anyone asks you a question you must
bark within five seconds or you�ll get shocked. Understand?�

I
immediately felt the vaginal dildo thumping and took the warning seriously. �Arf!� I barked. The thumping stopped and I was not shocked.
I guess I did it correctly.

�Good
girl. We�ll use one bark for yes and two barks for no. Understood?�

Again
I felt the thumping and again I barked loudly, �Arf!�

�Excellent.
Ok, now that you know how to bark, let�s see you crawl at my heel.� Jules
pulled out a leash and attached one end to my collar and the other to the
bottom of the remote control. �Heel,� he commanded. And I did.

We
walked into the corridor. He spoke to the hallway mikes and asked that the
�puppy lights� be started up. Suddenly the bottom molding lit up solid along
the entire corridor. Then the lights turned off. A second later, a section that
was roughly ten feet in front of us lit up. 

�Now
listen closely, Melanie. I want you to crawl quickly to that lit section and
bark loudly. The light will go out and another section ahead will light up. You
have to get there in three seconds and bark or you�ll get a shock up your ass. OK,
off you go,� he said.

He
detached the collar and zapped my ass with a small shock that was annoying. I
knew I had to comply though. I crawled as fast as I could to the lit section
and barked. The panel went out and the section ahead of me lit. I started
scampering again and barked once more. After three or four panels I slowed down
involuntarily and was shocked with a huge jolt in my ass. After that I just ran
as fast as I could to each panel, fearing the horrible pain should I fail to
get there in time.

I
don�t know how long I had to do this thing. It must have been at least two
hours. I ran up and down the corridor at least a dozen times. By the end I was
completely exhausted. Tears ran down my cheeks and across the mask. But I
couldn�t stop. I had to keep running from one panel to the next, barking at
each one. When Jules came to stop me I was so grateful I wrapped my arms around
his legs and pressed my cheeks against his knees.

Suddenly
I screamed as I tried to say something to him. I couldn�t even thank him for
rescuing me! I couldn�t even whimper.

�You�re
a dog, Melanie. You can�t talk, not even a little. The collar won�t allow it!
You can whimper like a dog if you like but you can�t cry like a human.
Understand?�

I
nodded my head and barked. I got shocked. �Don�t nod. The collar will zap you.�

�Arf!� I replied.

I
hated this so much! I can�t begin to describe it. While I was panting on all
fours he connected the leash to my collar and led me to the cafeteria. Now I
had to perform my little dog act for the crowd. It wasn�t bad enough that I had
to act like a dog. Now I had an audience.

&nbsp;

With
my little display of obedience out of the way Jules led me outside where I had
to do my duty. This was more humiliation. I had to lift my leg and pee on a red
concrete fire hydrant. The other part of the detail was taken care of with the
flushing hose, which a latex clad domestic administered. With both dildos
firmly replaced I was led to a large red building on the far side of the
complex. It would be my worst nightmare!

When
we entered we again had to go through a series of security gates. I crawled
obediently behind Jules as he led me through a small anteroom. It was at that
point that a man walked up to us and handed Jules a pair of black patches. He
pressed them against my eyes and blinded me. 

I
could hear a lot of commotion as we passed through a second set of doors. I
knew there were a lot of women gasping for breath and grunting but I just
couldn�t figure out why. While I was trying to figure out what they were doing
a tall woman voice asked, �Is this Melanie?� she asked.

�Speak,
Honey,� Jules commanded. 

I
immediately replied with a bark, �Arf!� I was really
beginning to hate this role.

�I�ll
take her from here,� the woman said. �You can pick her up tomorrow morning for
hall trots.�

�Sounds
good. Looks like business is booming,� he noted before he left.

�Yea,
it is. With recalcitrant ponies as well as the regular pups we had to expand to
250 cages.�

�I
hear you�re getting more help.�

�Yea,
and there�s really a Santa Clause too.�

�There
is?�

�You
didn�t get the memo?� she said jokingly.

�I�ll
see you tomorrow, Elsie,� he said as he left me in her hands.

�Heel,
Honey. We have some education to attend to. Don�t pay too much attention to the
sounds of these girls. It will only upset you. We�ll go to a private room so I
can instruct you without distraction.�

We
walked for a short distance. Without the aid of sight I was essentially at this
woman�s mercy. She dept her hand on the leash close to the collar. This made it
relatively easy for her to guide me along. When we stopped she told me to sit.
I did as instructed and was praised, �Good girl!�

Suddenly
the patches were removed and I saw a low cage, a couple tables, and a few
cabinets. Nothing seemed any more frightening than I had experienced before but
I knew I was going to be punished. I was frightened because I didn�t know how!

�My
name�s Elsie. You�ll remember that, OK?�

I
barked. �Arf!�

�Good.
OK, I know you�ve been a bad pony. I don�t know any details and I really don�t
care. I�m here to teach you to be a good puppy. That�s all I do, train girls to
be nice little puppies. And that�s what you�re going to become. Understand?�
she asked.

I
barked �Arf, Arf,� to
indicate that I didn�t understand at all.

�You
will in time. Now let�s get that vaginal probe out of you and get ours in. It�s
much more effective for what we�re going to be doing. Up, Girl,� she commanded.

As I
got up and allowed her to work I felt the dildo slip out of me, soon to be
replaced with a similar one. The belt was snapped closed and all was calm
again. On her order I sat once more. As I sat I felt a cable under me. It was
attached to the dildo she had just installed. When I looked behind me I saw
that there was a coil of cable behind me. I couldn�t be good for me.

�Now
that that�s take care of let�s get these preliminary questions out of the way.
I�m going to ask you some very personal questions. Simply bark as you�ve been
doing and we�ll get this out of the way. OK?�

�Arf!�

�Good.
First question: Are you gay?�

�Arf, Arf!�

�Good,�
she said as she checked something on a notepad she had on the table.

Returning
her attention to me she asked me, �Do you consider gay acts with other females
disgusting?�

�Arf!� I barked enthusiastically. 

�Excellent,�
she said.

�Let�s
talk about men now. Have you ever performed oral sex with a man?�

�Arf, Arf!� I replied, showing a
reviling look on my face.

�Do
you consider cock sucking just as distasteful?�

�Arf!�

�Just
as disgusting?�

�Arf,� I replied.

�Fantastic.
I�m so glad. We hardly ever get any girls who think otherwise. This is
excellent.�

I
was wondering why she was asking these questions as she attended to some
paperwork on her clipboard. She kept looking at me while she wrote. She kept
smiling.

�You
know, I think we can lose that hood. You�d like that, wouldn�t you?�

�Arf!� I replied enthusiastically.

�Here,
let me take care of that.� She easily unfastened the zipper and pulled the hood
off my head. It was like my head was suddenly freed from a saran wrap covering.
It felt really good. After she had adjusted the binding that was holding up my
ponytail she stood up and grabbed a short leash from the table. �Come here,�
she commanded politely.

I
walked to her and was suddenly secured to the floor with a sixteen inch leash.
It was connected to a clasp on the bottom of my collar. She stood up and
returned with a second short leash. I don�t think it was more than a couple
feet long. As she disappeared behind me I heard her order me to move a little
to my right. When I did I felt the leash clip to the ring on my clit. The other
end obviously was connected to the floor. I couldn�t move more than an inch or
two. Now I was really scared.

�The
reason I wanted to make sure you found cocksucking
and pussy licking offensive is because that�s going to be your punishment. A
puppy�s main role is exactly that, sucking and licking. And these are going to
be your very best friends,� she said as she turned from the table holding
flaccid replicas of a male and female sex organ. The cock was over a foot long
with balls on the end. I could tell it was fairly stiff because when she held
it by the root it hardly drooped. The replica of the pussy was no different in
quality and authenticity. It looked as real as if it were cut from a woman just
moments ago.

�No�
Ahhhhh,� I screamed as my collar punished me for
speaking. Elsie didn�t even tell me to bark. Instead she just set the
disgusting items in front of me.

�It�s
OK, Honey. I know it�s going to be rough on you. But this is punishment, after
all. You have only yourself to blame. Now, here�s the deal. We�re going to put
you in a cage with one of each hanging from the wall. A computer will monitor
your activity and demand that you attend to your duties. If you don�t, you�ll
get zapped in your vagina. Understand?�

�Arf,� I barked in a crying, upset tone.

�Now,
that unit in your vagina is not like the others. It�s designed to punish you
for as long as it takes to satisfy us. And here�s the amazing thing! No matter
how much it hurts it won�t cause any damage and won�t knock you unconscious.
That�s to prevent you from just hunkering down and going fetal on us. We can
achieve pain levels five times higher than the current shockers. The only
problem is that the units draw too much juice. The hypersonic inserts haven�t
been optimized for battery use yet. Anyway, let�s see how you do with the
leather one here, OK?�

I
looked at her silently with eyes wide as she picked up the leather cock. I had
no intention of letting that thing enter my mouth. I sealed my mouth closed and
was horribly shocked. �I asked a question,� Elsie demanded.

�Arf, Arf!� I said. I didn�t want
to play her games.

�I
see. Let�s start with a little lesson then.� She disappeared behind me. As I
turned my head to look at her I noticed that she was plugging the wire into
some sort of port on the side of an electronic console. After she fiddled with
a few knobs I suddenly felt a low grade pain between my legs. It started out
feeling like a rash. �Do you feel it?� she asked.

�Arf!�

�Wait,
it will get worse as time goes on. Would you like it to stop now?�

�Arf!� I replied.

�Well,
that�s really easy to accomplish. Just open your mouth and grab this. A second
later the cock was in my mouth but the pain was continuing to increase. �Hold
it there and I�ll shut the dildo down.� And there I stayed obediently with a
cock hanging from my lips. Because of its weight I actually had to clamp down
on it with my lips. It was more disgusting than I could ever describe!

The
next ten minutes were used to show me how to please a cock by massaging it with
my lips. I had to learn to move in and out along its length in order to excite
him and make the man ejaculate. �That will be simulated once we get you in a
cage,� she informed me. 

After
she was satisfied that I was sufficiently familiar with this disgusting act,
part two came into play. Now I had to learn how to please a woman with my
tongue. Well that wasn�t nearly as hard on me but it was also annoying and
degrading. It also took less time. She seemed satisfied in quite a short period
of time compared to the other duties with the male organ.

�Now
that you know your duties, let�s get you into a cage. Let me check.�

Elsie
went to a computer terminal and pulled up a few pages on the monitor. �Looks
like number 223 is open. Sounds good to me. Let�s get going.�

Once
she had a leash attached to me she disconnected the front and rear leashes from
the floor. The front leash was completely removed but the back one was left
trailing on the floor between my legs as was the long cable, which she nearly
forgot to disconnect! We were on our way.

We
entered the auditorium and to my stunned eyes I suddenly saw the source of all
the commotion. We were at the far end of a huge auditorium that happened to be
filled with cages. There were five rows with cages on each side. There were
hundreds of cages and nearly every one contained a girl on her knees. They were
all attending to wall mounted cocks and vaginas and their efforts seemed
excessive and hurried. �Oh my God!� I silently thought, fearing the collar as I
dared not speak the words out loud.

The
collar tugged and I heard the command, �Heel.� And I followed my trainer to my
fate. Why did I have to fight those girls? I wish I would have listened to
Elaine�s advice. Dammit!

When
we arrived at my cage the door was open. The cage sat in front of a steel
pillar that sported a control box on top. Behind the pillar were the numbers
�223� printed large and bold. I had one girl on the left of me and nobody in
the cage on the right. 

�Get
in,� Elsie said, zapping me with a small shock in my ass. When I was halfway in
she pulled the leash up short. �Hold still,� she said. I thought she was going
to disconnect the leash but instead she clipped the clit leash to a hook in the
floor. She dropped the leash that was attached to my collar and walked to the
console. If I could just get the clit leash off or even cause myself injury and
tear it off in a fit of horrible rage� With the door still open I might have
been able to scramble backwards and try to escape but what was the point. I was
trapped in these gloves and these pointed boots. How fast could I run on my tip
toes? Well, honestly I did think about it for a second or two. But common sense
got the better of me and I just stayed still.

Elsie
activated something and the hook in the floor moved forward, pulling me into
the cage by my clit. It hurt until I realized that I had to follow it. Once I
was completely inside the cage, facing the hanging cock and the wall mounted
vagina that was just inches from my face I heard the door close with a loud
clank. I closed my eyes for a second and bit my lip. I really didn�t want to do
this!

Elsie
came around to my left and took the leash off my collar. �You�re all hooked up
and ready to go, Honey. Now look at the wall in front of you. See the light?�
she asked.

�Arf,� I replied. My heart was racing now and I was so
scared that I didn�t know what else to do. She read my emotion and petted my
head like I was her dog. It didn�t make things any better.

�There
are three colors of lights above each device. You have to use each device until
they get into the green. Below the green are the yellow lights. If you let the
light drop into the yellow you�ll have five seconds to get more aggressive and
get the indicator back into the green. Once you hit red you�ll immediately
start feeling pain. Understand?�

�Arf,� I barked again with a tone of despair in my voice.

�Now,
a couple items before we start. Don�t use your teeth. Keep your teeth off of
the cock at all costs. If your teeth bite down on it you�ll immediately get a
very heavy shock. Use your lips. The system can tell the difference. The male
organ will respond just like a real one. It�s going to get hard as you work it
and it�s going to ejaculate too.� My eyes opened wide with that news and my
mouth formed a perfect �O�.

�That�s
right, Honey. You have to drink it down. The material is all the food you�re
going to get. It tastes, looks, and feels like the real thing. It�s sticky and
smelly. It�s synthetic of course. We don�t have enough males to service this
many girls for the length of time we need to. What you need to remember is that
there�s a set of sensors under the cock. If you dribble any out of your mouth
you must lick it up within sixty seconds or you�ll start getting heavy shocks
that won�t turn off until the floor is clean.�

As
for the pussy, lick as deep as you can go and make sure you get your tongue
into the apex. Playing with the clit provides more stimulation than licking the
lips but you have to lick the entire thing or the rating will fall. Do you
understand all that?�

I
stared at her for just a second before responding, �Arf!�
And so the nightmare truly began.

She
stepped back to the console and tended to the controls. In the meantime I just
stared at the cock and the vagina in front of me. I just couldn�t do it. No
matter how much it hurt I knew I couldn�t put that thing in my mouth. I
grimaced as I felt the dildo in my vagina start to ache. I looked up. The red
lights above the flaccid cock were lit and I was expected to slip it into my
mouth. I just couldn�t do it. �Go on,� Elsie urged. �Don�t let the pain get
you.�

But
I just couldn�t. I couldn�t put that thing in my mouth, especially knowing that
it was going to squirt that goo into me. �Oh my God!�
I thought. It hurt so bad that I just curled up.

�You
don�t want to do that, Honey. It�s going to get a lot worse. The only way to
stop it is to suck the cock,� she said as she now knelt beside me. But all I
could do was grimace as my crotch began to burn with horrendous intensity.

At
some point the pain seemed to leap in intensity and I began screaming. �Ahhhh! Ahhh!� �Stop�. Ahhhh� I screamed both from the pain in my crotch and the
pain that now punished my words by shocking my ass as well. 

�I
can�t stop it. Only you can. You�re at 50%. It�s going to get a lot worse if
you don�t start sucking the cock.�

�Ahhhh�..� I screamed half hearing her as the next level of
pain kicked in. Her words hardly registered in my brain as my loins felt like
someone had set them onto a hot brazier. I couldn�t even scream any more. All I
could do was hold my mouth open wide and breathe as fast as I possibly could. 

�You�re
now at level three. You have one more level to go and you�ve got about two
minutes to get the cock in your mouth. Come on. I�ll help you to your paws,�
she said. �You can do it.�

I
had had enough. The pain was so great that I could hardly move, let alone get
to my hands and knees. Elsie reached through the top of the cage and pushed me
forward. She even grabbed the cock and put it against my lips, massaging it
just a little. And suddenly the pain stopped.

�Start
working it and pay attention to the lights,� she said as she watched my lips
caress the leather tube.

�Start
sucking on it and move your lips along the full length of the shaft. This isn�t
a long one so it won�t go down your throat. Go on. Get the lights into the
green.�

The
thought of a cock going down my throat was disgusting but right now the only
thing that mattered was the device between my legs. In and out, up and down, I
was coached. Elsie stayed right there helping me learn the method. If I had a
razor I�d have sit my wrists. What I really wanted was to avoid that horrific
pain again. I didn�t want to go through that again. All I could do was work the
cock between my lips and keep the lights in the green.

The
lights stayed pegged at the top of the scale while the tube firmed up. I knew
what was coming and Elsie warned me. �OK, it�s going to come in a second.
You�re doing a great job. Remember, just keep sucking and swallowing until
you�re absolutely sure the cock is dry. When you�re sure the cock is empty you
can let it fall out of your mouth. But keep an eye on it. If you see anything
dribbling out of the tip, catch it before it hits the floor. Until you get past
this stage and start licking the pussy the default pain level will be the last
one you experienced. So don�t let any dribble out of your mouth. You wouldn�t
like that.

It
wasn�t long before I actually did feel the member bulge at the base. I pulled
my lips back to the tip and let it go into my mouth. Oh God! It was horrible! I
couldn�t swallow it but it was too much to hold in my mouth. �Swallow as it
comes out or you�ll spill it,� she yelled. And I gulped and swallowed all of
it. None leaked out.

�Good
girl. Now let it go slack and keep sucking until you�re sure it�s dry.�

I
kept the cock in my mouth for a minute or two longer. The lights went out. And
I let the tube fall from my lips. I was breathing heavily and looked at the
cock and the vagina. I then glanced at the girl next to me. While that was
happening a small drop came out of the rubber cock and fell to the floor. A
bell started ringing and I felt a low level pain between my legs.

�Clean
it up before the pain comes. Lick it up quick. You have sixty seconds to get it
spotless.�

My
eyes opened wide as I realized what had happened. I looked at the cock and saw
a second drop ready to fall. I put my lips around it and sucked on it,
swallowing a small quantity of the goo. Then I turned
my attention to the spot on the floor. It was just a tiny spot so I took my
tongue and licked it up. But the bell kept ringing.

�Keep
going. Clean your tongue with your own saliva and try again. Saliva will dilute
the stuff and won�t set the alarm off. Hurry up. You only have thirty seconds
left.�

The
pain increased to a slightly higher level. I ignored it. I turned my attention
to that wet spot on the floor. I wet my tongue and licked again and again. The
pain increased once more as the bell continued to ring. Then the bell went out.

�Good
girl. Don�t trust the lights. Keep massaging the organ until you�re certain it
won�t yield any more sperm. All things said, except for the stupidity at the
beginning, that wasn�t bad for a first time cocksucker. You�ll get better as
the days progress. OK catch your breath. The pussy lick is next.�

The
session on the vagina was quite humiliating partly because it was fairly easy.
That allowed me to think. Mostly I thought about the objectives of the
training. While I had to concentrate on satisfying the computer with my tongue
I didn�t have to worry about anything leaking out or hitting the floor. I also
realized that this training was meant to teach me to provide this service to
real women and men. They were going to make me suck real cocks and lick real
vaginas. With the methods I was learning and the training I was enduring I
would be conditioned to their standards in just a few days, I was certain. And
that was really upsetting.

I
used my tongue effectively with little coaching on the vagina. I considered it
an insult but Elsie said I was a natural lesbian. �You missed your calling. You
should have been a pussy licker years ago.� I wasn�t sure if she was really
trying to torment me or if she was actually commenting on my skill. 

When
I finished I felt a painless thump between my legs. �That thump,� Elsie
informed me, �was your punisher being reset to minimum level. You did very
well. Soon the process is going to repeat. Don�t wait any longer than necessary
to get your lips around the cock or it�s going to hurt just like before.
Understand?�

�Arf!� I said with a frustrated but cowed tone. I suppose I
had learned my lesson.

&nbsp;

And
that�s how the day went. First I sucked cock, then I swallowed the sperm, then
I waited and watched the cock until I was sure it wouldn�t leak, finally I�d
lick pussy. And that�s all I did for hours on end. I must have swallowed a
gallon of goo!

Every
two hours someone came and took me out of my cage, thankfully giving me a
break. I was taken to a fire hydrant and allowed to empty my bladder. Then they
stuck a hose in my ass and flushed me out. The whole process took less than ten
minutes. As soon as I was returned to the cage the process started again.

After
the first break I noticed that the gap between the phases was shortening. I
didn�t have much time to make sure the cock was clean before the lights came on
above the vagina. I had to lick with my tongue while I had to split my attention
between the lights above the current object of my attention and the cock that
threatened to drip. I guess I was doing something right because it never did.

It
must have been around ten in the evening when the whole cycle stopped. We had
just completed a round of being relieved when I noticed that the system went
out of cycle. I had just completed a vagina session and expected the cock
session to start again. But instead the pussy lights started once more. I
didn�t understand why but I wasn�t going to argue with the computer. I started
licking it. Five minutes later a loudspeaker announced. �Rest Period! All dogs
rest.�

I
pulled my tongue from the pussy in front of me and looked to my left to find a
small redhead staring at me. �Arf!� she said.

I
guess she was saying �Hello� so I returned the same, �Arf!�

She
smiled.

Something
began to inflate under me. It was an air mattress. I had to keep my legs to the
sides of the cage and straddle it until it fully inflated. Eventually the
mattress, split in the center for the leash that was still attached to my
loins, was fully inflated. I was so grateful. I plopped down on the bedding and
lay on my side facing the other girl. Suddenly I saw an arm moving forward from
the sign. It looked like a crane. Dangling from the arm was a very long dildo.
As it slipped through the bars the girl put it in her mouth using her mittens.
She opened her eyes and nodded upward toward my cage. As I turned my head I was
hit on the nose by my own dildo. And that�s when I felt a low grade pain
between my legs. I got the message and put it in my mouth. The pain stopped.

An
attendant came around to check on us. �You�re new?� she asked. 

�Arf!� I barked holding the cock in my mouth.

�As
long as you�re awake keep the cock in your mouth. It�s OK to let it fall out
when you are asleep but if you wake up with your mouth empty, start looking for
it ASAP. The system will start hurting you if you don�t get it in your mouth
within two minutes. Try and get some sleep.�

After
the attendant, a pretty blonde girl dressed in black latex, left I glanced
across at the girl in the other cage. With the cock in her mouth she resembled
a baby sucking on a bottle. She didn�t seem upset or frightened. She seemed
content, almost like she was using the phallus as a pacifier. 

I
couldn�t imagine any girl wanting to do what I had just done. Only torture
could break someone so completely. As I glanced across the aisle I realized
that we had both been exposed to such torture. I pitied the girl across the
aisle, wondering just how long it took to cow her into behaving obediently.
Then I pitied myself.

I
was being punished. I could see that the other girl�s tail was actually made
like a dog�s tail. It was shorter. I had to assume that she was not being
punished. She was being trained for this role on a permanent basis. This was
all so sick. Why did the government do this?

Somehow,
probably due to fatigue, I fell asleep. I actually slept well. I don�t remember
the dream but it had something to do with lots of boyfriends and lots of fun.
But anyway, I must have slept well.

When
I awoke I looked across the aisle and saw the girl in the other cage. She was
asleep and the cock had fallen out of her mouth. That�s when I realized that
the cock was not in my mouth either and my groin was starting to hurt. It had
fallen out overnight. I quickly got my lips around it.

As
strange as it may sound I was curious about my surroundings. I was restless and
wanted to look around. The leash between my legs would prevent me from moving
very far but I crawled around the cage as best as I could manage to try and get
a feel for my surroundings.

In
one direction there were cages as far as the eye could see. Each was exactly
the same as mine, perhaps four feet wide, three feet high, and six feet deep.
Nearly every one was occupied and I could see every crane extended over the
cages. The cables hung into the cages like fishing lines waiting for a bite. I
glanced up at the arm above me instinctively.

I
dragged my rubber cock around to the other side of the cage and noticed beyond
my friend there were only a dozen cages left in our row. Most were empty but
there were a couple that had girls in them. On the far side of the aisle there
were only six beyond us that were empty.

As I
looked past our row I noticed much activity. There apparently was some sort of
assembly line setup over there but I couldn�t see much beyond our row. There
were five or six women and men sweeping and hosing down the floors. I couldn�t
see much because we were in the end row. All I could really tell was that there
was a lot of machinery there. 

An
attendant walked up on me from my blind side and knelt down beside me. �Don�t
bark too loudly,� she whispered. �Can�t sleep?� she asked.

�Arf,� I barked softly, trying to hold the cock in my mouth.

�Would
you like to get cleaned up early? I bet that suit�s pretty sweaty and itchy
right now.�

That
sounded like a good idea. �Arf!� I barked again.

�Let
me see if the crew has a cleaning line ready yet. I�ll be right back.�

So
that�s what the machinery at the end of the aisle was for. It was used for
cleaning us. As much as my instinct told me it wasn�t going to be pleasant, I
was very curious to find out how this was going to be done. I plopped down on
the mattress and waited.

She
returned a couple minutes later. �They�ll be ready in a minute or two. Get up
on all fours and I�ll get you out of there.�

I
rose on all fours and waited. After the door was opened I suddenly felt a tug
on the leash between my legs. It hurt! I backed up quickly as the sliding clip
moved backwards. The attendant connected a leash to my collar and pulled me the
rest of the way back, disconnecting the crotch leash in the process. 

�Let�s
get your insides cleaned out first. That should give the crew time to clear a
line,� she said.

I
went through the humiliating act of peeing on the fire hydrant. Of course that
was followed by the insertion of the hose into my ass. As before the nozzle was
held in place as the water proceeded to my insides out.

I
noticed that evil vaginal plug was left on the floor. She didn�t replace the
anal plug either. For the first time in several days I had no dildos in me. It
actually felt strange to move without them. Then again, I didn�t exactly miss
them either.

The
command came to follow, �Heel!� And I did.

�My
name�s Anna Lee, by the way. I have the night watch. I don�t often get to clean
puppies this early.� As we trotted toward the assembly lines I noticed a
digital clock on the wall. It was 4:30 a.m.

There
were two girls waiting for us. Both were dressed in black latex, the classic
latex of the domestic servant. But they didn�t have any headgear on. That
surprised me. 

One
of the girls seemed to be in charge and took my leash from Anna Lee. She
explained a few things to me. �This is your first trip down the path so we�ll
walk you through the process as we go. You�ll get this cleaning every morning.
Normally you�d have to wait in line. With over three hundred girls we use this
method to get our girls washed and dried in as little time as possible. Climb
up onto the palette.�

I
crawled onto a plastic palette that was roughly five feet by three feet in
size. The sides were high, which made it look like a green plastic sled. It
featured a hook in the center which had a chain attached. It also had a pair of
handcuffs attached to the front corners. After pulling the zipper down on my
suit the chain was clipped to the ring on my clit. They let the suit fall to
the floor while they removed my boots and pulled the suit completely off me.
Then the removed the gloves.

�Hand
and knees,� the woman ordered. I dropped to all fours. She positioned me on the
large tray then connected handcuffs to my wrists to hold them in place. She did
not manacle my legs. 

Anna
Lee pointed out my tail. �Don�t forget to bag that!� she said. They slipped a
plastic bag over the horsetail. 

�When
you go through the tunnel, keep your feet inside the dimensions of the tray,�
she warned. If you crawl out of the tray while you�re in the tunnel you could
be seriously hurt. Understand?� she asked.

�Arf!� I replied.

�Good.
This works just like a touchless car wash. You�ll go
through various phases and when you emerge from the other end you�ll be clean. Ready?�

�Arf!� I replied.

I
felt the belt start and the tray moved down the line. As I entered the tunnel I
was immediately hit with a warm mist that actually felt pretty good. As I
progressed a few feet farther spray nozzles began hitting me with a light soapy
solution. The belt stopped at that point for just a few seconds. Then it
started again. When I had proceeded to the next phase I was soaped with
sputtering warm suds. I was literally covered in lather and couldn�t wipe my
eyes or mouth. It seemed to come more from the top but nozzles also extended
under me and hit my belly with the stuff. My sex and ass got a lot of it too.

At
that point I emerged from the tunnel looking like a soapy dog. The two girls
now used gloved hands to massage my scalp and rub the soap into my sex
thoroughly. They used stiff brushes on the majority of my skin, which didn�t
feel very nice at all. While they worked the line stopped a second time. A few
seconds later, they stopped and the line started once more. The second half of
the tunnel waited. 

The
remaining tunnel was nothing more than a rinsing station. Warm water cascaded
over me for the entire length of the tunnel while jets sprayed me from
underneath and both sides. It was like being in a torrential downpour. Then it
all stopped and I was hit by a warm air blast that blew the majority of the
moisture off of my body. 

When
I emerged I was completely dry, with the exception of my hair. A girl took a
towel and wiped the collar down and then started drying my hair with a brush
and a blow dryer. When she was satisfied she pulled my hair into a ponytail and
secured it with a plastic band.

A
fresh red suit was ready for me. They pulled me out of the tray and led me
aside. One girl kept a firm hold of my leash while the other two dressed me. I
didn�t resist. There was no point. Eventually, not only did I allow them to put
the suit on me, I also let them slip the dildos, the boots, and the gloves back
on. It was pointless to resist so I just let them do as they pleased. I wanted
out of this treatment as soon as possible. If I showed resistance they�d assume
that I�d need more training. One week as a dog was more than enough for me.

I
was returned to the cage for breakfast. Unfortunately it was a rushed affair of
sorts. Yes, I had to put that tube of rubber in my mouth again and keep sucking
until my trainer was satisfied. Anna Lee didn�t make me lick the pussy though.
I just was forced to suck the male member until she was satisfied that I had
enough food to keep me going.

The
material that was ejected was not the same though. It was more like the
consistency of farina. It had a gritty feel and it came out slower. I was
actually able to enjoy it to some extent because it sort of oozed into my
mouth. In fact I had to apply quite a bit of suction in order to get it to come
out. While it was satisfying to eat something that wasn�t slimy it was still
another hour of humiliation that I had to endure. But what choice did I have?

After
twenty minutes of work Anna Lee checked on me then went to the console. �Looks
like you�ve had enough. I guess we can stop pumping you full. Jules should be
here in a half hour. But you can never have too much practice on the rubber
stick. Just keep working it. There won�t be any output. Just keep working it
until Jules comes.�

So I
was stuck in the cage sucking again. At least I didn�t have to get my mouth
filled with that stuff. I just had to humiliate myself by keeping my lips
wrapped around this electronic manhood. I was a bit pissed. I thought I�d be
able to rest a while until Jules came to pick me up. I didn�t exactly look
forward to scrambling through the halls but it was better than being stuck in
this cage. I should have pretended to be asleep. Instead I actually asked to be
washed early. Now I was paying for it by having extra time to practice my
technique. What a stupid idiot I am!

Thankfully
Jules arrived early. He was accompanied by Elsie. They found me in the cage
with my lips around the cock. �How�s she doing?� he asked as I continued to
work the rubber tube.

�Let
me check,� she replied as she stepped to the podium.

�Very
good. She�s got a very high score for the first day.�

�Do
you think she�ll be ready by Wednesday?�

�We
usually go a week or two before testing them.�

�I
don�t like to keep ponies out of training any longer than necessary. I figure I
can combine the dog training with the marching.�

�We
don�t normally do it that way but if you think you can keep her under control,
well, that�s fine by me.�

�Great.
Why don�t you shut her down and I�ll get her hood.�

Elsie
turned off the machine and pulled me out of the cage. She took a towel and wiped
my face before putting the red hood over my head. With the zipper closed I was
just like any other bondage puppy that walked the grounds. �Heel,� Jules said
as he led me outside.

Chapter 11

&nbsp;

Melanie�s Deal

&nbsp;

Jules:

&nbsp;

I
was pretty happy with Melanie�s progress. For a girl who had never used her
mouth for anything other than talking she was pretty good at the art. In a few
days she�d be ready for testing. I was certain, from the reports at least, that
she�d do quite well.

We
normally let the girls go for a full week before testing them. Then we often
came up with some sort of lame excuse to keep them on their knees for another
week. We wanted to make the experience so horrible for them that they would
never try to escape or fight again. Unfortunately some of the girls did take a
second session to get the desire to fight out of their system.

Melanie
at times showed a pleasant willingness to bend while at other times she seemed
stubborn as a mule. So I thought a little compromise was in order. Perhaps she�d
like to do both puppy and horse training at the same time. At least that would
keep her out of the cage and let her sleep in her own bed. I�m sure she�d
appreciate it.

I
let her go through the routine for two days longer. During the day she crawled
around barking at the hall lights. In the evening she was trained in the cage.
By Thursday morning she was ready for my examination and the offer I was about
to present to her.

We
were in her room at the stables when I had her stripped of her gear. Whenever
the routine changed the girls became anxious. �You�re not in trouble,� I said
to her as she sat on her butt. I pressed a button on the remote and disabled
the speech inhibitor. �You can speak freely,� I informed her.

�Thank
you,� she said, speaking the first real words since Sunday.

�Did
you enjoy your stay in the kennels?� I asked.

�No
sir,� she replied. �Do I have to go back?�

�That
all depends on what you do in the next several minutes,� I told her as the
girls continued to remove her outfit and fit her with chains.

�You
want me to use my mouth on you, don�t you?� she asked.

�I
will ask shortly. I have a proposal for you if you�re interested. Suppose I
were to tell you that I like the way you act when you�re a puppy.�

�I
don�t like being a puppy,� she said. �Please don�t make me do that again. I
swear! I�ll do anything.� She was begging me with tear stained eyes.

�Come
over here and sit on my lap,� I ordered.

Now
that her chains were connected she had to hobble over to me. Her naked form
felt soft on my lap. And she was captivating. She was beautiful.

�Normally
punishment for the type of offense you�re guilty of is two weeks. Did you know
that?�

�Yes,
Sir.�

�Do
you know how many days you were in the kennels?�

�Four,�
she said.

�And
that leaves?�

�Ten
days.�

�I
can�t do that for another ten days. Please!� she cried.

I
patted her on the head and put her head on my shoulder. �You don�t have to go
back if you do some things for me.�

�Anything,�
she said.

�I
need you to learn the pony stuff but I can�t allow you to get away with only
four days of punishment for attacking my servants. So here�s what we�re going
to do. You�ll be doing double duty. Depending on my mood you�ll either crawl at
my side or you�ll be spending several hours in the halls. Sometimes you�ll trot
around with me for my morning rounds and sometimes you�ll be taken to a
marching hall. But, you don�t have to go back to the kennels and you can sleep
in your own bed.�

�Is
there anything else?�

�What
do you think?� I asked.

�You
want me to use my mouth?� she asked.

�On
command.�

�OK.�

�No
time like the present,� I suggested.

&nbsp;

Cleo:

&nbsp;

We
were worried for Melanie. We saw her crawling the halls every day. The barking
got to us. Elaine seemed to become the default authority on her experiences.
She really didn�t want to upset us but we just asked too many questions to
ignore.

When
Thursday rolled around we fully expected Melanie to be crawling the halls that
afternoon. We were stunned to see her hobble into the cafeteria.

�Oh
my God!� I screamed. I got up and nearly fell on my face in my attempt to
nuzzle against her. �Are you OK?� I asked.

�I�m
fine. I�m fine.�

�How
did you get out so soon?� Elaine asked.

�I
was a good girl,� she said with a half hearted chuckle. 

I
could tell immediately that she had gone through hell. �If you don�t want to
talk about it, we understand,� Elaine said.

�No,
it�s OK. I�m fine.�

�We�re
glad you�re out. We really missed you,� I told her.

She
was sitting next to me and patted my hands with hers even though her wrists
were connected by a twelve inch chain. �Let me get something to eat,� she said.

We
catered to her, not allowing her to stand up at all. We also treated her with
kid gloves because Elaine had given us the word over the past few days. She had
not left out any details. I almost wish she had.

�I�m
glad you�re back too,� Carrie said. �I know exactly what you were going
through. I did it twice.�

�Twice?�
Melanie asked. �Oh, that�s right. You did say that. But how? How could you give
them a reason to punish you after you had gone through it once?�

�I�ll
be honest. I don�t know. They broke me the second time though. That�s no lie!
I�m glad they only did you for a few days. Are you sure you�re OK?� Carrie
asked.

�Yea,
I�m fine. I had to make a deal with Jules in order to get out early.�

�What
kind of deal?� Angie asked.

�Well,
he won�t send me back to the cages if I do him here. And for half the day I
have to crawl around for him.�

�That�s
disgusting!� Megan said. �I thought we didn�t have to have sex with anyone if
we�re ponies.�

�I guess
they�re allowed to bend the rules,� Jo said.

Bonnie
suddenly showed up wearing a harness over her red suit. She was in tears. �They
put a saddle on me,� she cried! �They said they were going to ride me when I
got stronger. Oh My God!�

Everyone
looked up at Bonnie. She took a seat and put her head on the table. �Why are
they doing this to us?� She cried.

�Don�t
let it get to you,� Melanie said. �You don�t want to end up where I was.�

Suddenly
Bonnie noticed that it was Melanie. �You�re back? I thought you were going to
be gone for two weeks,� she said.

�Change
of plans. Trust me. You don�t want to make them think you can�t do what they
ask. Get yourself together. We�re all going through it,� Melanie stated firmly.

Bonnie
saw the sheer panic in Melanie�s eyes when she made her statement. She knew
exactly what motivated her to say it. �It must have been hell for you,� Bonnie
said. �You looked like you had so much fight in you. Did they hurt you?�

Melanie
nodded. 

�How?�

�I
don�t want to go into details. You don�t want to know.�

�No,�
Carrie said. �She should know. All of them should know, especially from someone
who�s been there.�

�I
want to hear it too,� I said. �Talking about it is good for your sanity. Angie,
you�re the psychologist. You tell her.�

�She�s
right. It�s a good idea to talk about it. But you don�t have to talk about it
now. Let some time pass. You�ll talk when you�re ready.�

�I
don�t know if I�ll ever be ready,� she mumbled.

�It�s
OK. We�re all in this together.�

�You
girls don�t have to suck off Jules or trot around on all fours for half a day.�

�Maybe
we can spell you,� Megan offered. 

�Excuse
me?� Melanie asked. �What exactly do you mean?�

�We
could take your place until you feel better. Maybe you could return the favor
one day,� Megan explained.

Angie
laughed. Now let me get this straight. Megan, the most timid girl here, is
going to suck off Jules then crawl around like a puppy for a day. Is that what
you�re offering?�

�I
can do it,� she said in her innocent voice.

�Anyone
can! But will you?�

�It�s
better than marching around in heels with that damn spoon in my mouth. At least
my mouth would be free and my feet wouldn�t hurt.�

�She
may have a point,� Connie said. �But oral sex doesn�t exactly turn me on. And
they demand sex on command. That could mean a lot of performances. Does anyone
want to endure that just so our feet won�t hurt? Personally, I�d rather march,�
she said.

Melanie
looked at Megan with kind eyes. �That�s really sweet, but even if Jules would
go for it I just can�t let you do that for me. That�s really nice of you
though.�

�Well,
it was a thought,� she said resignedly.

�I�d
do it for you too,� I offered.

�We
don�t even know each other. Why would you do that for me?� Melanie asked.

�It�s
not for you. It�s for me. I agree with Megan. Marching around like this is
annoying at best and painful at worst. I can�t tell you how many times I�ve
fallen on my butt. At least if I�m a puppy for a day or two I won�t be getting
shocked every fifteen minutes. I can deal with a little humiliation.�

�They
feed you through a rubber penis,� Melanie said suddenly. �Think you can deal
with that?� she asked angrily.

My
eyes opened wide. �That�s sick!�

�It�s
not nearly as sick as some of the stuff I haven�t told you about.�

�Like
what?�

�They
train you to put your tongue between another woman�s legs. They make you suck a
rubber cock that ejaculates. And you have to swallow every drop or they shock
you between the legs like you�ve never imagined!�

�You
went fetal on them, didn�t you?� Carrie asked.

Melanie
nodded.

�You
poor girl. What level did they hit you with?�

�Three,�
she whispered. �I felt like my insides were on fire. I hurt so bad I couldn�t
even scream. I couldn�t move. They had to prop me up so I could get the cock in
my mouth. They wouldn�t turn it off until I was sucking on that damn thing! Oh
my God!� she cried. �They won�t let you say no. They just kept hurting me until
I did what they wanted.� Melanie�s voice was strained. She cried and cried.
Carrie took her bound hands in hers. 

�I
did the same thing. You didn�t do anything wrong.�

�I
should have done what they asked. It hurt so much!� she cried.

�I
know. But that�s all over. Jules won�t send you back there.�

�Yes
he will. If I don�t do what he asks he will. I can�t say no to him.�

�None
of us can say no to him, Honey. We all have to say yes. So don�t feel guilty,
OK?� Angie said.

Melanie
nodded. Her attention suddenly was directed at the clock. �I have to be back in
my room in twenty minutes,� she said. �I�m not looking forward to the puppy session.
I hate that damn barking routine.�

�I
never liked it either,� Carrie noted.

�I
said I�ll take your place,� I offered.

�You�re
nuts. Suppose they want to put you in the kennel for a few days to learn the
trade. Don�t risk it. It�s not worth it. Besides, if some sick fart sees you as
a pup they may want to keep you on your knees permanently.�

�That�s
true,� Angie said. �Jules already told me that they do that on occasion. They
like smaller girls to take on those roles. Megan, don�t let them put you in a
kennel. Do not volunteer to take Melanie�s spot. If you do you may be crawling
and fetching permanently. I�m sure you don�t want that!�

Megan�s
gaze returned to that of the scared, innocent girl. �No. I wouldn�t mind
covering for a day or so. But being kept as a dog permanently? No. I don�t
think I�d like that at all!�

�Has
anyone figured out why they are doing this?� I asked.

�We�ve
been trying to figure that out ourselves,� Angie said.

�I
just wish I were back in Texas,�
Melanie said. �I just got back from visiting my aunt and uncle there. They have
fantastic animals. I actually got a chance to ride a race horse. That was some
creature. My uncle has been breeding thoroughbreds for twenty years��

�That�s
it!� I said.

�What?�
Angie asked.

�Thoroughbreds!
That�s the answer. This is an ethnic cleansing plan.�

�You
know. You may have something there. Megan, where were your parents born?�
Carrie asked.

�Iowa.�

�Cleo?�

�Newark,
 New Jersey.�

As
we talked we discovered that none of us had any recent ancestry in Europe.
All our parents or grandparents came from the U.S. We felt quite proud to have figured this out. Not
that it would help much. We were going to be beasts of burden no matter how
smart we were. Unless someone had an army on the way we�d be pulling carts or
carrying people on our backs before too long.

�I
have to get back,� Melanie said. �I guess I�ll see you all tomorrow.�

�We�ll
pray for you,� Elaine offered.

Melanie
smiled, and then hobbled out of the cafeteria.

&nbsp;

�Did
you enjoy your little chat?� Jules asked.

�Yes
sir. They were all curious.�

�That�s
not unusual.�

�I
suppose. What do I have to do now?�

�First
you�ll please me. On your knees please.�

�Yes
sir.�

As
Melanie practiced her oral skills on Jules, he mumbled to himself, holding her
head between his legs. �I was going to drag you around on a leash but you�ve
already lost several days in harness. I think we�ll put you in a corridor for a
couple sessions before we go back to the puppy stuff. You need the exercise.

Of
course Melanie, with her mouth full of Jules member, couldn�t say anything. All
she could do was move in and out as she had practiced over the last few days.
Jules was demanding and insisted she do things right. He even shocked her when
she let her lips slip off his cock by accident. After she recovered he insisted
she start again with gusto. Seeing the remote in his hand, she got the message
quickly.

When
he released her he compliment her on her performance. �Except for that little
bobble, I can�t hardly complain. Keep doing what you�re doing and we�ll be done
with this little annoyance in a week or so.�

�Yes
sir.�

�Call
me Jules,� he insisted.

�Yes,
Jules. Is there anything else?�

�No.
I�ll send a set of domestics and a dog for you shortly. You can march through
the evening.�

�Yes,
Jules.�

�I�ll
see you tomorrow morning.�

&nbsp;

Jules:

&nbsp;

I
heard what the two girls offered to do for Melanie. The collars were wired and
I kept them monitored. It was a clear violation. They were interfering with
Melanie�s punishment. Anyway, I thought it would be good for them to discover
the consequences of their actions and see what a dog goes through. I also
agreed that Megan might not be suitable for a pony. She just might have to
become a puppy, simply due to her physical size.

I
figured on taking care of Megan first. I entered her room to find her lying on
her bed, dozing. As I called for two domestics she heard me.

�Hello,
Jules. Is it time already?�

�Almost.�

�Can�t
you do something about this? Can�t I get out of being a horse?�

�As
a matter of fact I have something else planned for you tonight. The domestics
will be in shortly to dress you.�

�I
know.�

�I
heard what you offered to do for Melanie,� I informed her.

Her
eyes lit up. �You heard me? You bugged the cafeteria.�

�Not
exactly. Your collar is wired.�

She
stared at me. �It was a dumb idea. Forget I mentioned it,� she said suddenly,
fear evident in her voice.

�Actually
it was a fantastic idea. I think we�ll try it out for a couple weeks.�

�A
couple weeks? Why? We didn�t do anything wrong! No, please. Don�t do this.�

�I�m
afraid I don�t have a choice. You screwed up. You can�t interfere with anyone�s
punishment. You were monitored by our staff and it was logged and reported.
You�re going to the kennels for punishment.�

She
stared at me in horror. �I can�t be a dog! Please don�t do this! She was crying
when the two latex clad women came in. When they looked at me I had only one
word for them. �Kennels.�

They
both nodded and retrieved the special gear that was locked in the end closet.
Since Megan had been left in her red body suit it was simply a matter of
swapping her collar, installing the pointed boots and finally putting the
special gloves on her. At that point I turned on the remote and programmed her
dildos to link to the collar. She was now a dog.

�Speak,�
I said.

�Wha�. Ahhhh,� she screamed.

�That�s
not what a dog says. Speak!� I commanded.

�Arf!� she said in a high pitched, but frightened voice.

�It�s
late so we�ll take you directly to the kennels. Diane, get a leash and take her
right over. I�ll get Cleo and be right behind you.�

Cleo
was already on all fours, crying and pleading. She was being shocked often due
to her histrionics. She was mad. She had no idea that offering to take
punishment for someone else was an offense. Well, she knew now.

�You�re
wondering why? You were told never to interfere with someone�s punishment. I
told you that on day one. Then you go and offer to get into a puppy outfit to
let Melanie off. Well, you�re going to get your wish. Megan�s going to keep you
company.�

Cleo
screamed as she tried to curse me. All that came out was a scream of extreme
pain. �You need to curb that behavior or you�ll cook your insides. I think a
spoon gag is in order,� I said to the domestics. Before long not only was she
gagged, she was also hooded and leashed. She was going to the kennels.








Chapter 12

&nbsp;

Puppy Love

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Jules:

&nbsp;

�Eileen?�
I asked as I finally got her on my cell.

�What�s
up? How�s are little project doing?�

�She�s
pretty much cowed. Got a couple more problems though. Two girls in need of some
attention.�

�Send
them over. We have plenty of room.�

�They�re
already on their way. Their names are Megan and Cleo. Check out Megan. She�s a
little small for a horse. Might be better on all fours permanently.�

�Small
horses are in demand too, you know.�

�That�s
true. With the powered carts I guess they don�t have to be tall. Still, we
should think about moving her over. Maybe we should see how well she does
before making a decision.�

�Are
you going the short route with these two also?�

�No.
They need to learn a lesson. I�m not planning on even evaluating them for at
least ten days. Besides, I have so much work to do that I doubt I�ll be able to
give them even a cursory glance until the middle of next week. You�ll have to
get someone to check their progress.�

�I
can do that. Excuse me for a second.� There was a pause and some talk in the
background. �Jules, they�re here. I�ll�. Hang on a second.� More talk was heard
in the background. �This Cleo, she�s Arnie�s pony.
Should we tell him?�

�Sure,�
I said. �In fact, why don�t you ask him to evaluate her?�

�Consider
it done.�

&nbsp;

Megan:

&nbsp;

�Can
you bark for me?� the woman asked as soon as she saw me.

I
looked at her with contempt right up until she took the control from the
servant. �Arf!� I said.

�We�ll
have to work on that enthusiasm,� she said sarcastically.

Behind
me the door opened and another girl crawled beside me. I saw the long tail on
her butt and realized it was Cleo. She was wearing a spoon gag and she was
obviously pissed. She was shocked three times while I was sitting there.

�You�re
an interesting little item,� the woman said. �But no matter. We�ll get you
properly up to speed. Take them to cages 303 and 304. They should enjoy
watching each other submit. I�m already aware of their profile so there�s no reason
they shouldn�t get the standard training. Make sure they get the proper vaginal
plugs inserted before they are caged.�

We
were taken down the middle aisle quite a distance before coming to our cages.
The cages were made of heavy iron. Short leashes were attached to our clits and
the vaginal plugs were replaced with ones that sported heavy cables. When they
were buttoned into us with the padlocks we were both frightened. The ends of
the clit leashes were attached to the tracks and we were pulled inside the
cages. It wasn�t until the doors were bolted shut that they removed Cleo�s gag.
I felt so sorry for her. It was my entire fault.

�OK,
puppies. We�re going to have a little lesson in oral sex. Notice the cocks in
front of you. Get used to it. You�re going to learn to love them, literally.
I�m going to turn on the system. When I do you�ll immediately start feeling
pain in your vaginal canal. That�s your cue to get the cock in your mouth. The
only thing that will stop the pain is for you got start sucking it. If you
resist, the pain will continue to intensify. If you let it go for thirty
seconds the pain will jump in intensity, doubling your agony. Every thirty
seconds the pain will double again until you reach level four. At that point
the pain will remain steady until you get the cock in your mouth. Got it?� the
sadistic bitch asked.

We
didn�t have a choice. We barked. It was humiliating.

�Megan,
we�ll start you up first. When the pain starts, just put your lips around the
cock and start working it. Just don�t touch it with your teeth.�

Eileen
walked to the console in front of my cage and played with some controls. I felt
the pain almost immediately. I looked at the rubber cock and instantly was
revolted by it. The pain grew in intensity. I shook my head. It was a stupid maneuver.
I got zapped in the ass for shaking my head. But I continued to resist. Then
the pain jumped and I screamed.

�That�s
level two,� Elaine said. �You have twenty seconds left before it jumps again.
You don�t want that to happen. Unless you like pain I�d suggest you get your
lips around your little friend.�

I
had had enough. I crawled forward and did the unthinkable. I put my lips around
the rubber cock. The pain stopped immediately.

�Good
girl,� she praised as I continued to suck on the thing. �Now, you have to work
the cock so the lights move into the green. Keep it out of the red and don�t
let the scale fall into the yellow any more than a few seconds. And don�t let
your teeth touch the cock. That will earn you a big jolt!�

I
looked at the lights and kept working the cock. It got hard like a real one.
While I was working it, Elaine started Cleo�s system. I glanced to my left and
saw that she had taken my lesson to heart. Her lips were working her own cock
vigorously.

�That�s
great girls. Now, when the system ejaculates, don�t let any spill. There are
sensors on the floor. If any spills you�ll hear beeping as a warning. You�ll
also start feeling the pain between your legs. Just like the pain that Megan
felt, it will double every thirty seconds.�

�I�ll
stay with you girls until you switch to pussy licking. I want to make sure
you�re doing it right. Oh, one other thing. These cocks tend to leak once
you�re done sucking so keep an eye on them while you�re licking the pussy.
Megan, get ready. The load will be coming any second.�

I
had never done this before and I found it as disgusting an act as I had
imagined. Yet the computer watched over me, preventing me from resisting. I
couldn�t let the cock fall out of my mouth and I couldn�t let any of the stuff
leak from my lips. I had to work the cock until it released its goo. And it did! Oh my God! It was horrible. I swallowed as
fast as I could. I actually had to gulp it down. It tasted salty and it had the
consistency of slime. 

�Keep
working it,� she said. �You�re almost done. When the light goes out, suck on it
hard for about thirty seconds. Then switch over to the pussy. That won�t be
nearly as difficult. Cleo, get ready. Your load is almost there.�

My
light went out so I did as I was told. I sucked on the penis until I was sure I
was dry. Elaine was paying close attention to Cleo so I was left alone for a
moment. When the light went on over the pussy I started working on it. That�s
when Cleo started groaning.

�You
should work harder to get it all down. Get your tongue to work on the floor. If
it�s not cleaned up in thirty seconds the pain will double.�

I
heard animal-like grunting from Cleo�s cage. I couldn�t glance her way for fear
of suffering a painful shock between my legs. All I could do was listen to her.
Then she screamed and I knew she had not made the thirty second time limit. I
guess she had to learn just as I had.

A
few minutes later I heard our tormenter praise Cleo. �I think you have the hang
of it now. The dildos between your leg will make sure you follow the rules.
I�ll be back in a couple hours to see how you�re doing. Just keep doing your
duty and you�ll be fine.�

&nbsp;

Cleo:

&nbsp;

I
wanted to cry. This was horrible. I was licking a rubber pussy and I had just
let a rubber cock squirt into my mouth. When the stuff dribbled from my lips
they made me lick the slime off the floor. My God, how that dildo hurt. They
had shocked me hard before but it never felt so bad as that device between my
legs. And Eileen said that it could quadruple? Sweet Jesus!

I
didn�t have time to sulk because if I lost concentration the damn thing would
zap me again. All I could do was lick and suck. The cycle continued for hours
without relieve or pause. We just kept attending to the genitalia in front of
us. They were conditioning us well.

&nbsp;

Arnie:

&nbsp;

Eileen
called me in the morning to tell me that they had my pony in the kennel. �What
did she do?� I asked, expecting an escape attempt or some other serious
infraction. When she explained the reason I began to stew. Instead though, I
held my anger and simply asked for the trainer.

�Jules
authorized it,� Eileen informed me. �I think he got the word from the
surveillance office. But I can�t be sure.�

Obviously
Eileen was just following orders herself. I�d have to check with Jules and find
out what was going on. One thing was certain. The girls didn�t deserve the
treatment they were getting. I�d have to fix this bungle.

I
had Jules� cell phone number and called him immediately. I held a civil tongue,
informing him that the punishment was too severe for the incident in question.

�I
was just following orders. Tara ordered them both to the kennels,� he informed me.

�You
should have called me,� I told him.

�Do
you want me to pull them out?� he asked.

�I�ll
take care of it after I talk to Tara. If Tara wants any girl put in the kennels from now on call
me. I�ll authorize or deny it.�

�Understood.
I�ll pass everything by you first. I�m sorry for causing you so much grief,� he
apologized.

�It�s
not your fault. You were only following orders. Stop by my office around noon. We�ll do lunch. I want to discuss some things with
you.�

�I
can do that. I�ll see you at noon.�

Tara�s office was
around the corner. I entered the large red building and made my way through the
lobby. The operations room was as big as a warehouse. Each aisle had a bank of
computer terminals on either side. Each was manned by operators who kept track
of the women in training. The operators were each assigned an area. Any female
entering the area would be watched and listened to. If an area was empty the
computer reassigned them.

This
was the room where ponies were watched for proper form. This was where
punishment signals were sent out when the ponies didn�t lift their knees
properly or hold their head high. It was also the place where the decision was
made to punish those who violated the rules.

Tara was staring
over the shoulder of a black haired gentleman who was pointing to an image of a
pony girl that was marching along one of the paths. �She�s OK for now but watch
her,� she said. �If her knees drop again, zap her.�

�Not
a problem,� the young man said.

I
caught her by surprise. �Hi, Babe. We need to talk,� I said to her.

When
we entered the office she turned around and smiled at me. Then she wrapped her
arms around me and our lips met in a mad blissful kiss. �God, I missed that!�
she said.

I
smiled back at her. Her long black hair was amazingly gorgeous. It hung down
past her ass. Her nose was just a bit long but her bright eyes lit up the room.
I loved her and remembered our wedding night. She was amazing in bed and I
immediately thought about this evening. 

But
I had serious matters to discuss. �What do you know about those two ponies in
Block 23B?� I asked.

�23B?
Oh, those are the ones who tried to make that other pony�s punishment easier.
What about them?�

�One
of them is destined for our stables. After Jules described the incidents I
thought that you might have been excessive.�

�Excessive?
I don�t think so but if you want to listen to the audio I don�t have any objection.�

�Yea,
go ahead. I just want to make sure that they deserved the treatment.�

�Hang
on. I�ll punch it up.�

It
only took a couple key pressed to bring up the file. I listened to the digital
audio. It gave me time to calm down. I wanted to give her a fair shake and make
sure the punishment was justified. I didn�t really want to argue with her
anyway. 

I
listened to the entire conversation and scratched my chin. �There was no
intent,� I pointed out.

�I
was always under the impression that you liked us to nip this sort of thing in
the bud. Yea, maybe it�s a little heavy but we always lean toward being safe
rather than sorry. I don�t have a problem if you want to reverse me. I really
didn�t feel too strongly about this one anyway. It�s not like they meant to break
the rules.�

I
scratched my chin and thought for a moment. �I�d rather have that Cleo
marching. Being put in the kennels takes away from her pony training, and
that�s the real point of this exercise.�

�So
you�re taking them both out?�

�I
think so. They�re not going to be puppies. We need them for transportation. Our
stable�s getting a little thin.�

�I
suppose you have a point. Do you want me to call Jules?�

�If
you don�t mind� I�ll let Eileen know.�

We
kissed. I knew she was a busy supervisor but she was very good. That�s why I
married her. We hardly ever argued. Ten years of marriage and we still felt
like newlyweds. I smiled as I walked back to the kennels.

&nbsp;

I
had one of those administrative meetings so I couldn�t pick up the girls until
late in the afternoon. That would work out well. A day or two in the kennels
wasn�t really going to harm them and might make them a little more enthusiastic
about being good ponies. Jules was tied up too with all sorts of meetings and
his obligatory management of his pod.

By
the time I got to the kennels it was nearly five in the afternoon. Eileen told
me over the phone that they were both at the runs. Her domestic, Jennifer, had
them and was going to play fetch with them, which was standard conditioning.

As I
talked on the phone with her I made my way to the dog runs. I told Eileen of
our decision. She was not happy. This was the second time she had gone through
the trouble of shoehorning ponies into the system only to have their stay cut
short for one reason or another.

�I
can�t really help it. They really didn�t deserve this. Besides, I need the one
girl up to speed in six weeks. I can�t really afford to have her training set
back.�

�I
understand,� she said. �I just don�t like having my plans changed.�

�Well,
I have a special puppy coming to you in a few days. I�m sure you�ll want to
take personal charge of this one.�

�Really?
What�s so special about her? Is she tiny and cute?� she asked intently.

�No,
she�s old and stubborn. You�re getting the princess.�

�Princess?
What princess?�

�THE
PRINCESS,� I enunciated loudly.

�You�re
kidding, right?�

�Nope.
The PM said to put her in an outfit for six weeks and make her bark.�

�I
can�t do it! She�ll have my head when she gets out of her outfit.�

�The
PM promised that no one will suffer for her treatment. She�ll be over in a few
days. Treat her just like any other puppy. Don�t spare her and don�t treat her
any worse. Just let the automated systems do the job, just like you always do.

�I
can�t get away from this, can I?�

�Nope.�
I said.

�Well,
I guess we�ll just have to make her into a puppy. I�ll make the arrangements.�

Thanks,�
I said.

The
walk to the dog runs took some time. Although I had become used to the sight of
pony and puppy girls it still amazed me that we could produce them on such a
large scale. I was quite proud of the staff. The organized effort they provided
produced some fine stock for the country�s benefit. 

The
ponies were the most obvious feature of the landscape. Hundreds of girls were
marching on the concrete paths, each bound and dressed in the standard outfit.
They all wore hoof boots, arm binders, and hoods. The spoon gag was used on
each girl. Each would certainly make a fine personal or taxi pony, I was sure.

Some
ponies were pretty tall. I saw one exceed six feet three. Her long blonde hair
cascaded out of the top of her hood and reached her ass. Her tail rose from her
ass and trailed behind her, flowing and swaying as she marched. In fact, the
majority of our ponies had similar traits. Each was a marvelous example of
submissive womanhood.

The
puppies were a different matter altogether. These girls were destined for
something much less pleasant. In the miniature communities of this country they
were highly valued. But in our northern neighbor�s land they were quite
commonplace. However since the supply was kept small the profit margin was
still quite acceptable. For the state it was a win-win situation.

I
found Jennifer on the training field with the girl named Megan. Jennifer was
not wearing the hood or gag. Kennel domestics weren�t required to wear them
because they had to give vocal commands. Jennifer was actually a very beautiful
woman of around forty. Her long straight red hair went to her shoulder blades
and her lips were painted with a deep red lipstick.

She
was playing fetch with the girl, teaching her to stay until the order was given
to fetch. I watched the puppy�s performance. For her first day it was not bad
at all. I thought her enthusiasm was lacking but since it was the first day it
was expected. Further training would have brought her around if I hadn�t made
arrangements to put her back in the pod.

�Are
you Jennifer?� I asked her, knowing that she was.

�Yes,
sir,� she responded.

�This
is one of the two ponies being punished, correct?�

�That�s
right. The other is in track 55. I was going to swap them in a few minutes. Is
there a problem?�

�I
need you to take them back to the stables, Pod 23B. Give them to the domestics
and have them put back into their cells. We�re suspending the puppy training
and putting them back in harness.�

She
didn�t question me or ask the reason. She simply said, �Yes, Sir.� She then
told her charge to �Heel.� She walked away with Megan in tow.

I
walked back to Pod 23 while Jennifer retrieved Cleo. I met up with Jules and
explained the situation. He said he had a meeting in fifteen minutes and
wouldn�t be able to check on the girls till later in the day. He really would
have liked to greet them. I offered to help by being there in his place.

When
the girls arrived I had them both put in Megan�s room for convenience. The
pod�s domestics took over, allowing Jennifer to return to her own duties. I
watched the tight latex pants stride away as she turned and left. She was
amazing!

Both
girls sat like trained puppies with their hands in front of their knees. The
domestics held their leashes and kept them steady and under control. I�m sure
Megan knew what was going to happen but unless Jennifer had given Cleo some
hint she was unaware that the punishment was over. It was time to tell them.

�Hello,
Girls,� I said. �Was the kennel tour as horrible as you imagined it?� I asked.

The
both barked loudly.

�Would
you like to be ponies rather than puppies?�

�Arf!� I heard each respond.

�Good.
Most girls agree that being a puppy is not nearly as pleasant as being a horse.
So I assume you�ll both do your best in your new roles. Can I make that
assumption?�

�Arf!� they replied.

�I
think we can drop the bark sensors. Ladies, let�s have each of the remotes.�

I
took each remote and punched the master code to bring up the anti-speech
settings. I turned off the bark and the query sensors. �Cleo, you can speak
normally again,� I informed her. A moment later I had turned off Megan�s collar
as well.

�Stay
on your knees. I want to ask you some questions.� The girls sat and waited
patiently. I towered over them. To make a better connection with them I sat on
the bed and beckoned them to me.

�Do
you girls understand why we did this to you?�

�No,
Sir,� Cleo replied. �All we did was offer to take Melanie�s place.�

�That�s
right, Sir,� Megan replied. �We didn�t mean any harm by it. We weren�t trying
to escape or get out of being ponies.�

�I
know. The monitors thought you were out of bounds though. They thought you were
trying to make Melanie�s punishment easier.�

�I didn�t
know it was such a big deal. Otherwise I would have never offered. I swear I�ll
never do that again,� Megan said.

�Me
neither. If someone�s getting punished it�s their own problem.�

�I�m
not going to admit that there was really a mistake here but we�re not going to
keep you in the kennels for two weeks. We�re letting you out now. I�m
countermanding the order.�

Cleo
looked up at me. �Thank you, Sir,� she said. Megan thanked me as well.

�I
want each of you to promise me that you�ll do everything in your power to be
good ponies. I don�t want any bullshit for either of you. Jules is a very
dedicated trainer and a good friend of mine. He�s got six kids to feed and he
has hardly any free time to himself. I don�t want any of you giving him any
more to worry about than he already has. So from this point forward you�ll do
as you�re told. Is that clear?�

�Yes,
Sir,� they both replied.

�Good.
Megan, one last detail.�

�Yes,
Sir?�

�Offer
to suck off Jules the next time you see him. In fact, from this point forward you�ll
suck him off any time he asks.�

�I
thought ponies didn�t have to�.�

�You�re
on parole. My rules,� I said.

She
looked at me for a moment and quietly agreed. �I�ll do as you ask,� she said.

�Good.
Cleo, Heel!�

We
returned to her room.

Chapter 13

&nbsp;

Weeks of Hardship

&nbsp;

Cleo:

&nbsp;

It was a difficult time for all of us. For the next
several weeks we were dressed in our pony outfits and put through two sessions
in the corridors. Twice a day we had to march down the corridors with our legs
sheathed in leather boots and every orifice filled. Our mouths were stuffed
with that damn spoon gag and both our lower openings carried electrified
dildos. Because of their ever present capability to shock us we had to obey. We
had to march like trained circus animals.

After a few days of marching I realized that I was
beginning to get the hang of it. I no longer fell. My balance improved markedly
and I hardly ever got warned through the signals in my dildo that I was losing
my form. I got the feeling that the other girls were getting the hang of it
too, although Megan and Melanie still showed signs of bruising from the falls
they obviously had not avoided.

It was after the first two weeks that we lost two
girls. Carrie and Brenda simply weren�t there one day. I asked Jules about it
and he told me they were shipped out. He didn�t know where but he assured me
that they�d be well taken care of. He also told me that there would be two new
girls coming in on the following Monday. I pitied them and prepared mentally
for the tears that were sure to come from them.

There was a lot to pity to go around. We pitied each
other for our own hardships. We pitied ourselves because we knew our future was
so depressing and degrading. But most of all we pitied the kennel girls. Their
lives were so horrible that we were almost glad we were chosen as ponies. I
still remembered that day in the kennel. I was so glad that I wasn�t selected
for that role.

Jules took good care of us. He had a number of
assistants but he ran the pod. Every day he�d make sure we were well groomed. When
we didn�t want to talk he�d make us talk to him, just so we wouldn�t dwell on
our current situation. He simply wouldn�t let us fall into the doldrums. Even
with the sad state of affairs he expected us to enjoy some element of our
lives.

Unfortunately he had to maintain discipline as well.
When one day Bonnie decided to lash out and try to prevent the domestic girls
from installing the harness Jules had no choice but to apply such discipline.
Soon we heard the barking sounds coming from her as she rushed up and down the
hallway. It was so upsetting to us that we began to avoid the break room so we
wouldn�t have to hear her. Melanie seemed to take it the worst. The truly sad
thing was that we knew the other element of her training first hand. We knew
she�d learn tricks not normally taught to dogs. We could only imagine her
torment.

After two weeks some things did change for us.
First, they started lining the marching corridors with thick mattresses so that
we wouldn�t be bruised when we did fall. We�d have to make sure to fall to one
side or the other. The disadvantage was that the path was reduced in width to
only two feet wide. That meant we had to march much straighter when we went
down the corridors. Of course with my arms bound behind me I soon discovered
just how susceptible I was to being toppled by even the slightest brush with
the mattresses. I soon learned to keep my feet in the center of the path.

After three weeks I was taken outside and put on the
concrete paths. After having been taught for so long how to lift my knees, I
hardly ever walked while in my outfit without doing so. Jules insisted that I
pump my knees whenever I wasn�t bound. In fact, he even changed my chains so
that I didn�t have to wear ankle manacles. The deal was that I had to lift my
knees all the time. He said his crew would watch me carefully.

I marched around the paths without the threat of any
automated system punishing me. Instead there were human monitors that watched
us through the myriad of cameras that dominated the facility. If I didn�t lift
my knees high enough or if I stopped without permission someone would push a
button and zap me. I�d never know their face or their name. But I�d surely feel
their sting.

I soon learned to march for longer periods of time.
Jules told me that the rest periods, spent on the horses that were positioned
around the paths, would be governed by my exhaustion level. As I tired there
would be more rest stops. By the end of week four I was marching a full twenty
minutes without difficulty.

I should make mention of the new girls we got in
week three. The new girls that came in during that week were quite young and
very frightened. One was named Cassie and the other was named Tony. Tony had
long black hair and Cassie had short blonde hair. They were both upset to no
end. In time I knew they�d adjust. But before we even had them for two days
they were sent to the kennels for fighting with the domestics. Soon there were
three girls barking in the halls. And we�d have to endure listening to the
sound of barking for a full two weeks more!

Then we heard that Melanie got caught trying to
escape. �Dammit!� I said to the group sitting at the
table. �Didn�t she learn anything?�

Jules gave us the scoop. She had tried to slip into
a supply truck while she thought no one was looking. Hadn�t she learned that
someone always was looking? Apparently not.

Jules told us that she�d have to complete her
training as a pony in a timely manner. Since puppy training took away from the
time that she�d march, it was decided that she�d perform double duty. She�d
spend her afternoons in the kennels suffering all the indignation that went
along with that role. But, she�d still spend her mornings and evening marching
on the paths or in the corridors.

Melanie had learned her lesson after the first day
but she had a full two weeks to go for her punishment to be fulfilled. She did
have one hour to eat lunch but she had to eat it out of a doggie dish. We had
to watch her humiliate herself in the process. She didn�t have any chance to
speak to us during the two weeks of punishment. It was just one more little
lesson taught to anyone who happened to be considering disobedience.

It was only after the fourth week that they put me
on a cart. As before I had my arms pushed into a leather sleeves. Thankfully my
hips were stabilized by the pull bars, which were connected to a harness that
was attached a wide leather belt. But there was one thankful thing about the
ordeal. I no longer had to wear the spoon gag. Instead I had to wear a bit and
bridle. While I found this humiliating it was so much more comfortable that I
actually was grateful! At least I didn�t need to keep my tongue extended while
I marched.

&nbsp;

Dina, puppy girl:

&nbsp;

After two weeks of crawling on hands and knees, being
taught tricks, and barking like a dog, I thought that things couldn�t get any
worse. In that time I had slowly begun to resent my predicament due to the
frustrating fact that there was nothing I could do to get out of this mess. I
was a puppy and I had no chance of escaping.

After only a few days in my outfit I discovered that
they had replaced my partner. What a surprise it was to find the princess
kneeling across from me. And if you thought I was upset over my role as puppy,
you should have seen her! She just didn�t want to have any part of this
adventure. She suffered for her attitude. Harmony would have no part of it. The
princess did scream! But it wasn�t a scream for freedom. It was simple and pure
punishment. She took a lot of hits before she learned.

For two weeks we continued to be treated to the dog
runs and the fetching. After a few days of playing Harmony introduced us to the
cock jack. This was a toy that we had to pick up with our mouths. It resembled
a spiked ball. But the spikes had been replaced with human cocks. We had to
pull it into our mouths and present it to her. I didn�t like doing it one bit
but I did as I was taught.

She also began teaching us to stay until commanded
to fetch. It was one more way to control us. We�d sit patiently while she�d
throw a toy into the field. Then she�d call us by name and tell us to �Fetch!�
We had to bark then run off and get the item, presenting it to her by begging
with our hands held at our side. It got old very quickly.

Anyway, I didn�t really want to discuss the next
part because it is so upsetting. After the second week the princess was
replaced by another girl. She had long black hair and she cried even more than the
original Blackie.. But what they did to me was enough that I�d never forget the
horror.

For the past two weeks all I had to do was physical
stuff such as crawling and fetching. There was the obvious display of my
breasts bulging from the uniform but there wasn�t any sexual activity. Even the
dildo in my sex wasn�t intended as a sexual stimulant. It was a punishment
device. I got no joy from having it placed inside me.

But on that day during the third week I was taken to
the kennels. I always thought that the area where I was staying was considered
the kennels but during those two weeks I began to put together enough
information that I realized that the kennels were something entirely separate. But
it wasn�t until that third week that I discovered the horror that the kennels
represented!

I followed obediently on a leash. The use of the leash
was somewhat unusual for me because I had been very cooperative. Harmony hadn�t
used the leash in over a week. I knew I couldn�t run off with her holding that
remote. But I didn�t think much of it until we entered the large warehouse. The
sight of the cages and what the girls were doing inside them made me sick to my
stomach. They couldn�t make me do that! I wanted to scream but the spoon gag
kept me silent. All I could do was let the tears well in my eyes.

Harmony handed my leash to a woman who was dressed
in a shiny black outfit. �Hello, Sweetheart. I�m Chelsea,� she introduced herself.
�I�m going to be your trainer for the next few weeks.�

I looked up at her with fear. I knew the path this
would lead down and I was so frightened and upset that I could hardly
concentrate on her words. I knew that they were going to make me open my mouth
and use it for sex. I started to whimper. I guess that wasn�t allowed either
because I got a shock for my behavior. I�d have to cry silently.

After we had walked for a short distance we entered
the prep room. In the room were a cage and some tables. �What�s that doing
here?� Harmony asked.

�The repair crew hasn�t had a chance to install it.
We had three break down last week. The cages tend to get a lot of use.�

�Yea, I suppose they do. This one is pretty docile.
She�s taken her training fairly well so you can pretty much depend on her to
obey your commands.�

�Good. I hate when I have to use extreme measures to
bring them in line. Anyway, we have a busy day ahead of us so let�s get the
formalities out of the way.� She redirected her attention to me and said, �Harmony�s
going to insert the new plug into your sex. Don�t be afraid. As long as you
cooperate you won�t have to worry about it.�

Harmony unfastened the belt and replaced the plug.
Once the belt was replaced I had a long cable trailing behind me. She also
attached a short leash to my clit ring while she was bent over me. �She�s all
ready,� Harmony said. �Call me when she�s been acclimated.�

So I was left with Chelsea and the ordeal began.
�You�re frightened, aren�t you?� she asked.

�Arf,� I said as I looked
up at her.

�Well, that�s just the way things have to be. Now,
let�s get you in a cage and we�ll get started. Heel!�

She led me out into the auditorium and down the middle
aisle. I immediately noticed the sounds of all the girls grunting as they
struggled to please the artificial cocks that were in their mouths. I could
barely stand it. The sounds alone made me sick to my stomach. I tried to keep
my eyes looking straight ahead. I just didn�t want to look at them. As we
continued down the aisle, passing cage after cage, Chelsea spoke of the girls. �This
is all new to you, I�m sure. The true purpose of a puppy is to please men and
women with her mouth. Each of these girls is going through the same training
that you�re going to endure. �They
usually stay in these cages for about four weeks. We take them out daily for
exercise in the dog runs and we teach them fetching tricks. But the real
training occurs here. Oh, here�s your cage. Come along.�

On command I crawled up to the open end of the cage
and stopped at the foot of the enclosure. Chelsea reached under me and
connected the clit leash. Once it was secured she disconnected the main leash
from my collar.. When she pressed the button the leash moved forward, dragging
me inside. I had to follow. Finally she plugged the cable into the waiting
socket.

I was now staring at male and female genitals. I
didn�t know how I was going to get that thing in my mouth. It looked so real.
But I knew I had to do it. I had to put it in my mouth or I�d get punished. I
knew that these women didn�t want to be here. They didn�t want to be trained to
be whores. So there had to be some sort of threat involved. I didn�t want to be
hurt anymore so I had to find a way to obey.

I heard the door lock. It was redundant anyway. I
couldn�t disconnect the leash from my crotch with these gloves on. I certainly
couldn�t work any latch with these fingerless mittens. And I couldn�t run away
from this nightmare with these pointed boots on my feet.

�OK, Honey. Let�s get started. In front of you is a
dick and a pussy. There are lights above each. When the lights come on you are
to suck the cock or lick the pussy aggressively enough so that the green lights
stay lit. If you don�t move fast enough the lights will drop into the yellow
and then the red. You�re allowed five seconds in the yellow before you get
punished. If the lights drop to the red you�ll feel pain between your legs
immediately. Understand so far?�

�Arf!� I barked.

�Good. The cock is only a six inch job so you won�t
have to deep throat it in order to massage the entire length. You have to work
the entire length of the cock and you must maintain suction. As you work it the
cock will stiffen and behave like a real one. When you work it properly it will
ejaculate into your mouth. There are sensors on the floor and you must keep the
stuff off the floor. If you do spill any, even one drop, you�ll have to lick it
up. As an incentive the pussy dildo will come on with a mild pain to prompt you
into action. You have thirty seconds to clean it up before the pain jumps to
the next level. Trust me. That really hurts. Oh, and that dildo between your
legs can�t cause any physical damage. That means that no matter how much it
hurts you won�t pass out and your pussy won�t be burned. It�s a hypersonic
stimulator. So it can�t burn you like the electrical inserts can.�

Chelsea walked to the console in
front of the cage and pressed a few buttons. �OK. Get ready,� she warned. Immediately
I began feeling the pain between my legs. I saw the lights turn on above the
cock and moved toward it. The pain seemed to be getting worse. �Get it in your
mouth and the pain will stop,� she said.

I opened my mouth and wrapped my lips around it. Oh,
God! How I hated this. Suddenly I just froze. I looked at the lights on the
panel and it glowed red suddenly. I felt the pain. It wasn�t starting small and
ramping up. It hit me like a hot poker between my legs. �Ahhhhh!�
I screamed, letting the dick pop out of my mouth. Chelsea yelled at me, telling me to
get it back in my mouth. I was so stunned by the pain between my legs that I
could hardly move. I began to shake and nearly collapsed to the floor. Instead
I gathered my strength an pulled the cock back into my mouth. Thankfully, the
pain went away.

�You have to work it,� Chelsea said. �Run your lips along
the entire length. Keep suction on it too. If you don�t keep moving your lips
you�ll get zapped again.�

Chelsea continued to coach me,
telling me to put the phallus deeper into my mouth. �It�s going to touch the
back of your throat,� she said. �When you get comfortable with this one we�ll
move to a longer one so can learn to deep-throat. Don�t worry about that now.
Just keep working. You�re doing just fine.�

Chelsea noticed the cock hardening.
She warned me to move my lips to the tip and keep sucking. �Get ready. Make
sure you don�t spill any,� she warned.

And sure enough the cock squirted into my mouth.
There was a lot of slime and I tried to swallow it. I choked though and spilled
some on the floor. I immediately heard the buzzer and felt the pain. It was
pretty mild, feeling like sunburn between my legs. Chelsea yelled at me to suck the
last of the stuff out of the cock. Then she told me to lick up the mess. �Hurry
up. If you don�t get it all up in thirty seconds you�ll really feel it. Well, I
somehow managed to clean up all the droplets in the time allotted. While the
pain was fierce, it didn�t jump in intensity.

In the interim the cock went limp. With the buzzer
turned off I knew I was safe. I thanked God for that. �You should learn to
swallow quickly. There�s more stuff than can fit in your mouth so you have to
swallow while you�re sucking it out. When the cock goes limp you should make
sure you suck it dry it doesn�t drip while you�re licking pussy. Understand?�

I barked as taught. This was really going to be my
worst nightmare!

Licking the rubber pussy was nothing compared to the
cock. Chelsea coached me to get my tongue deep into it and linger
at the top. I did as she instructed. There was a slight salty taste to it, I
assumed to simulate the real thing. All I did was lick and watch the lights. I
didn�t seem to have any problem keeping them in the green.

After a few minutes the lights on the cock came on
again and the cycle repeated itself. This time I did everything correctly. I
let the cock go deep into my mouth and kept my lips and tongue moving along its
length. When the stuff came out I swallowed quickly and didn�t spill any.

Chelsea seemed satisfied and walked
to the console. �I�m increasing the resistance a notch. You�ll have to work
just a little harder to satisfy the system. Remember. When you�re sucking cock,
the highest scoring area is next to the base. The deeper the cock goes in your
mouth the better your score will be. I�m sure you�ll get the hang of it. I�ll
be back in a few hours to see how you�re doing.�

When I started licking the pussy the green lights
wouldn�t peg to the top. Instead they tended to linger in the middle of the
range. I didn�t have to work too hard to get results but I did have to keep my
tongue moving over the entire length in order to satisfy it.

It was when I had to suck the cock again that I
realized just how much more demanding the system was going to be. Now I had to
move quite quickly in order to satisfy it. I also had to make sure I got my
lips to the base of the thing or the lights immediately dropped to the yellow
mark. I got zapped a couple times to enforce this rule. Now I knew why all the
girls were working so hard. If I didn�t want to be punished I had to learn the
same technique.

I spent the next two hours going back and forth
between male and female genitalia. By the end of those two hours I was
completely broken. I was fully accustomed to sucking cock or licking pussy. I
knew I�d be as docile as a newborn kitten.

A woman arrived, dressed from the neck down in black
latex. As I licked the pussy I watched her approach the console. Suddenly the
lights went out. I next heard the door behind me swing open. Next I felt a tug
on my clit as the slide pulled on my leash, dragging me out of the cage. The
woman clipped a leash to my collar and told me to heel. I did without
resistance.

We walked over to a concrete fire hydrant and I was
allowed to relieve myself against it. Several girls were waiting in a series of
lines awaiting the opportunity to do the same. Thankfully the cabled dildo was
removed from my crotch and the regular one was inserted in its place.

The woman never announced her name to me. All she
did was take me to a field where we practiced fetching and doing other tricks.
She made me catch Frisbees, rubber balls, and the infamous cock jack, which was
a ball with eight phalluses sticking out of it. Compared to the earlier ordeal
this was a piece of cake!

&nbsp;

I spent the next four weeks doing essentially the
same thing. Either I was forced to attend to my two rubber friends or I�d have
to play fetch or walk in the dog runs. Four weeks of hell had turned me into
their idea of a sex pet. Terms like sick and depraved no longer meant anything
to me. All I thought about was opening my mouth and pleasing the person holding
my leash. Four weeks had transformed me completely.

After four weeks I was now a trusted puppy. They now
gave me the duty of leading ponygirls to their assigned areas. They gave me a
bit and some reins and I pulled the girls along. At first they kept a domestic
near me as a guide. She�d be gagged so she had to use hand signals. When the
girl was put into the corridor or onto the concrete path I�d be released and
told to return to the kennels or the cage corridor. Sometimes I was ordered to
go to the dog runs. I always followed orders, knowing that they were watching
me with cameras the entire time.

During the next two weeks if I had to show my oral
talents it was done on the real thing. Harmony and Arnie seemed to test my
enthusiasm for the task most often. However, there were several other men and
women who tested my talents as well. I never knew their names. All I knew was
that I had to open my mouth and lick the women and suck the men. Before long it
was nothing more than a physical act to me. I no longer cared about hating or
liking it. I just did it.

After six weeks I was completely broken to the point
that I was ready for graduation. This consisted of a new outfit made out of dark
blue latex. My entire body was encased in it. My head was even covered in the
shiny material. My boots were changed to a gold colored set as were my arm
coverings. The attendants brushed my ponytail and my dog tail until they
shined. I also was treated to a new gold collar with beautiful green emeralds
on it. Like its predecessor it featured all the electronics to keep me behaving
like a dog. Well, that was to be expected.

&nbsp;

Cleo:

&nbsp;

One by one our numbers were replaced. Girls
disappeared and were replaced by new recruits. Those that were experienced
calmed the nerves of the new girls. We all took the job on reluctantly but
acclimated ourselves to the task. We all learned how to be psychologists over
those few weeks.

Some girls wouldn�t take the hint and ended up in
the kennels. I had learned my lesson. These girls, there were two in particular
that needed a heavy dose of discipline, needed the full treatment to bring them
into line. Jules showed no mercy. They spent three weeks on their knees. The
remaining girls got very upset as they had to listen to the incessant barking
and scampering. I had seen it enough that I was pretty much immune to it.

After the fourth week they started putting me on the
carts. In a way, this was good news because of the bit and bridle. Since I
needed to wear these items, so they could control me, they had to take out the
spoon gag. I didn�t mind holding the leather rod in my teeth. It was a lot more
comfortable than having to stick my tongue into the hole in that awful gag! 

My hair had grown to an unbelievable length in the
short time I had been here. My hair had grown to my ass! I must have had hair
that was over three feet long. My hair had lightened a shade too. I was
grateful that the girls combed it for me. The problem was that it took a long
time to wash, dry, and comb. I was kept chained in the shower during the
washing process. Once my hair was dry enough to handle they took me out into
the main room and clipped my collar to hanging chains so they could bend me at
the waist and comb my hair from the bottom up. I hated this part because it
often took fifteen to twenty minutes even with three girls combing my hair.

My tail had grown unbelievably bushy. It hung to the
floor, curling upward before draping down across my ass. I had some control
over it but it often seemed to swish on its own quite often. Often I didn�t
even realize it was moving until I felt it hit my legs. It was a demeaning
thing to have hanging from my ass. But it was now mine. I had to think of it as
an appendage rather than something tacked onto my butt. I really didn�t like it
but it was going to be there until someone surgically removed it, if they ever
did!

Each day would now be started by a delivered
breakfast followed by washing and grooming. Now that I didn�t have to wear the
spoon gag I was delivered breakfast first. It consisted of a bowl of cereal and
a piece of fruit. Afterwards I was washed, groomed, and dressed. My arms were
pinned behind my back with a leather arm binder. Then they put a hood on my
head along with a bridle. Various accessories were added such as bells, the
control dildos, and the collar. Finally the inserted the bit into my mouth and
activated the collar so that I had to make sounds like a horse. I hated that
too!

Once I was in uniform I had to lift my knees
whenever I walked. Wherever I walked I had to lift my knees. A dog girl led me
to my destination, often without the aid of a supervising person. Sometimes we
ended up at a training corridor, sometimes at a concrete path, and now, after
my fourth week, the track.

There was always an attendant waiting for me at the
track. Now that I had four weeks in training, my task was cart training. The
carts were powered so pulling them was nothing more than an effort in guiding
them. They were ingenious. The pace was controlled by the tension on the pull
bars. All I had to do was walk and the cart would follow. There was hardly any
weight that I had to carry. All I had to do was pull with a few pounds of force
and the cart moved. If I stopped the cart would brake. It would push me for a
step or two but I couldn�t possibly be run over by it.

By the end of week five my endurance was
unbelievable. I could trot nearly two miles without rest. They tested my
endurance by putting me on the cart and having me pull until I was tired. They
didn�t tell me that they were testing me but I had to keep trotting until I
just couldn�t walk any more. I did seven and a half laps! Afterwards they told
me how far I had marched. Pulling a cart and walking in these goofy boots I had
walked two miles. That was crazy!

On my last day they brought a new outfit, a deep
blue one. I no longer wore red. My entire outfit, corset, boots, bridle, and
bit, were made of navy blue colored leather. The collar was made of gold
leather with green emeralds. 

I was so grateful to leave this complex for the
final time, even if it meant a lifetime of being a ponygirl.
It was six weeks of hell. I had suffered the indignation of being forced to act
like an animal. I had seen others being treated even worse. I had seen the
girls being trained in the kennels. I pitied them so much. I pitied myself!








Epilogue

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

President Emil Rothschild XXIII:

&nbsp;

We had been invited to Prime Minister Horwath�s dinner on short notice. Our two countries had
been at war only three years ago. While Grumm and Horwathia were of similar cultures and backgrounds, we did
have our suspicions of each other. Our differences had been resolved several
months ago when he offered six beautiful girls to us as a peace offering. We
realized that our petty squabbles were gaining us no ground and, in fact, were
costing both our countries billions for unnecessary expenditures on our armies.
It was insane. We could make much better use of our resources.

After hearing of the program that Minister Horwath had endorsed in his country I immediately began
looking into the possibility of establishing a training facility in our own
country. Grumm�s population was primarily pure,
perhaps because the rugged terrain wasn�t nearly as hospitable for the soft
Americans. Horwath had a large Euro-American base to
enslave. Therefore we would have to use their population until we could attract
unsuspecting tourists to come here.

Arnie was the architect of the Horwathia
facilities and through political channels we requested that the Prime Minister
endorse his employment with us. There were a number of meetings with the Horwathia leader but the end result was quite acceptable to
all. The agreement only helped cement our relationship and put us on a path
toward true friendship.

Sigmund was actually a very interesting individual.
I soon discovered that he enjoyed the look of bound women as much as I did. We
both enjoyed talking about the training methods that were employed in the camp.
Arnie provided us with video, giving us reports on the progress of the girls.
He even provided us with secure live feeds of prospective candidates. We could
choose a girl from right off the street without her knowing about it till the
last second!

Arnie was a genius. There was no way around that
fact. His skill at determining the best method for breaking these women and
transforming them into pets and ponies was quite remarkable. He knew what they
were going through. He knew what it took to make them do as he wished. He even
knew how long each phase would take based on just a few observations. And he
was hardly ever wrong.

&nbsp;

We arrived at the 19th century castle
around six that evening. I wanted to arrive in our ponygirl
drawn coach but the distance would have been far too long. The Airport was over
thirty miles away. Besides, we were being pelted daily with freezing rain and
high winds. We left our girls home and instead just took four latex clad
servants.

My wife was gorgeous in her blue velvet gown. She
also wore a pearl choker and earrings. I had never seen her look so incredible!

We were greeted by two men and two women. The women
were dressed in gold latex outfits that left no part of their bodies exposed.
The women�s mouths were hidden behind flat masks that offered only holes for
their nostrils. Even their eyes were covered by plastic lenses.

As the men led us to the reception area we noticed
that every female servant was dressed in gold latex. Most wore hoods and masks
but quite a few did not. Those that did not looked to be in their mid-forties
to early fifties. The most amazing feature present on every female though was
the presence of a tail. Some tails were long and others were quite short. When
I asked one of the servants about this he said that each had previously been a
pony or pet. So that explained it!

As honored guests we were taken directly to the
front of the receiving line. My wife was greeted by Princess Cassandra while
the Prime Minister shook my hand heartily. �I�m so grateful that you could make
it, my friend,� Prime Minister Horwath exclaimed.
�This horrific weather has put a strain on all our resources.�

�It�s the same in our country, although we�re
dealing with large drifts of snow. Personally I�d rather have snow than this
type of weather. Princess, how are you doing?� I asked.

�I am well, Mr. President.�

�Did you really spend two weeks on your hands and
knees acting like a dog?� the first lady of Grumm
asked.

�Closer to four actually. I can�t say I recommend it
though. The accommodations are not up to our standards,� she quipped.

We all laughed but I noticed that her smile was
subdued. She must have gone through hell, I realized. As we talked I found that
she avoided the subject often. My wife, not known for her sensibility, kept pressing
her on the subject. It must have been increasingly annoying for Cassandra to
have to dodge the subject. So I decided to help.

�Dorothy, if you�re so interested in her experiences
perhaps you might enjoy a tour. I�m certain our hostess would enjoy showing the
kennels. If that isn�t sufficient, perhaps you�d like to spend a couple weeks
there to learn first hand what these girls go through.�

�No!� Cassandra warned. �You don�t want any part of
that life.�

Dorothy looked at Cassandra and realized what her
husband was suggesting. �I suppose I should quit while I�m ahead. I didn�t
realize you suffered so much, Cassandra. I apologize. I won�t bring the subject
up again.�

�It�s OK. The memories of those weeks are still
pretty fresh in my mind.�

A steward behind the Prime Minister spoke up. �Your
Excellency, the line grows quite long. Perhaps we could arrange a more formal
meeting a short while later.�

�Yes, of course. If you�ll pardon me, feel free to
mingle. Arnie is wandering around somewhere. If there is time I will have
someone bring you to my personal study when we are finished with these
proceedings.�

�Of course,� I replied.

My wife and I separated. She went looking for the
bar and I went looking for Arnie. I found him sitting at a table talking to his
wife. He spotted me as I approached. �Mr. President,� he greeted.

His wife was stunning. That long black hair cascaded
down over her shoulders in ripples of loveliness. She had obviously used the Rapunzel cream that Arnie�s staff
had invented. She was dressed in a dark red strapless gown. She wore white
elbow length gloves and a diamond necklace. She was exquisite.

�Is your wife here?� Tara asked.

�Yes. She�s wandering around somewhere.�

�I think I�ll go find her. It was a pleasure, Mr.
President.�

�The pleasure is all mine,� I replied. 

�So,� Arnie asked as I sat down. �How�s life in Grumm?�

I felt pretty silly at the moment so I said, �Glum.
Glum Grumm, that�s where we live,� I smiled at Arnie.

�Can I get you anything? A drink, a pet?� he asked.

�All of the above if you don�t mind.�

Arnie looked around the hall and spotted a waiter.
He came immediately. �How may I serve you, Gentlemen?� he asked.

We ordered drinks. I orders Scotch and soda. Arnie
ordered a martini. While we waited Arnie scanned the floor for a wandering pet.
I saw one pass fairly close to our table. When Arnie beckoned she crawled to
our table immediately.

�Arf,� she barked, sitting
on her heels and looking at us in an enthusiastic way.

Arnie scanned the name badge. �Jolene? I seem to
remember that name. Aren�t you the one who swore you�d never pull a cart or
march for us?�

�Arf,� the girl barked.

�This one was real trouble. We had her all set to be
a show pony and she just kept going fetal on us. No matter how much we tried to
convince her that the pony life was better she kept balling up in her room and
letting the punishment shocks hit her.�

�I suppose some girls simply can�t listen to
reason.�

�Unfortunately true. Shall we get started? Jolene,
please proceed. You can do me after you�ve satisfied the president.�

The puppy crawled under the table and proceeded to
open her mouth for me. With the tablecloth obscuring her actions she expertly
unzipped my fly with her mouth then extracted my cock with her tongue. Before
long my face seemed to light up with joy as the woman provided me with carnal
pleasure. As she began working on Arnie�s zipper the
steward arrived with the drinks. The steward paid no attention to the woman
crawling under the table. It was nothing he hadn�t seen before.

Shortly after we had dismissed the puppy our wives
returned. They had spotted the puppy crawling away from our table and knew what
was happening. Rather than object, they instead were curious. Arnie�s wife, Tara, wanted to know every detail. As Arnie
described what I had experienced, as well as what he remembered of her history,
the president�s wife seemed captivated.

�I understand you�re being awarded a puppy and a
pony,� the First Lady, Gina, noted.

�I didn�t want all the fuss,� he said.

�You deserve quite a bit of glory for all you�ve
done. The work on our new facility is almost complete. We should be up and
running in just another month. We already have the key personnel trained and
your Prime Minister has promised the loan of quite a few helpers, what you call
domestics. When the construction is complete we should be ready to operate in
just a month or two.�

�Thank you, Mr. President. I did put a lot of work
into getting your facility ready. I�m sure there�s a lot more work to come.
I�ve brought in several people to assist that I trust completely. In addition,
as backup, I�ve briefed my sister on all the details. Should there be any
reason I cannot complete the project I�m sure she can. In fact, several
innovations were her idea. The overhead track system was her idea as was the
tongue grabbing bit. She�s smarter than me.�

�You are an amazing fellow. I�m honored to call you
friend,� I said, as I patted him on the back.

We continued to chat for some time, talking about
all sorts of inconsequential matters. We talked about weather, furniture,
travel, and vacations. We talked about current events, past events, and future
events. When we had run out of things to talk about our wives took up the
subject of shopping. Neither of us was foolish enough to interrupt that conversation!
We had been married far too long to get into that mess.

A steward summoned us to the main dining hall where
the crowd was assembling. Honored guests took their places at the head of the huge
horseshoe shaped table, respectfully remaining standing until the Prime
Minister and his wife were seated. There were nearly one hundred people in the
room. Arnie and his wife were on the Prime Minister�s left and my wife and I
were on his right. 

The meal consisted of roast duck a la orange with a
pecan-orange glaze. The side dishes were oriental in nature, consisting of an
exquisite rice pilaf, Thai spring rolls, vegetable medleys, and various other
appetizers that were all exquisitely laid out on platters along the entire
length of the table.

The Prime Minister waited for everyone to be seated
then offered a toast. As was traditional, the first toast went to the visiting
head of state. Of course that was me. �A toast,� he said. �To our good friend
President Emil Rothschild XXIII, may his term in office be kind to him.�

I politely whispered a �Thank you, Mr. Prime
Minister.�

After drinking the toast several other dedications
were offered. First the minister offered a toast to his lovely wife, whom he
credited with organizing the event, then to his staff for the actual work that
was put into the banquet, and finally to Arnie, who was the recipient of praise
from both of us as I seconded the Prime Minister�s commendation.

Arnie seemed befuddled by all the attention. He knew
he was being given a pony and a puppy as gifts but he wasn�t prepared for all
the attention. I had known Arnie for some time and knew he shunned praise and
attention. He preferred his privacy and really didn�t care for the publicity.
Still, I thought he handled it quite well.

His wife, Tara, beamed with admiration for her
husband. She was so proud of him for all the work he had done. I had a high
opinion of her but she did have an appetite for glory that was not necessarily
in concert with her husband�s goals. She was intelligent and shrewd beyond comparison.
She was an amazing adversary when it came to arguing a point. She never went
over the line, instead allowing her opponent to box themselves in. I had lost
many an argument to her during the countless debates we had in friendly
discussions over the years. Yes, I did admire her greatly.

The dinner proceeded for the better part of an hour.
There was music from a small band. They played various pieces from Bach,
Chopin, and Beethoven. These were the Prime Minister�s favorites. I personally
considered it �Elevator Music� and tended to tune it out. Instead I listened to
the countless conversations, absorbing the intelligence information for later
use. Alcohol tended to loosen tongues and I fully expected to pick out one or
two tidbits that I might be able to use at a later time. Unfortunately I found
no such items of interest.

I turned my attention to Arnie. He was pretty upset
for some reason. The Prime Minister had just said something to him quietly. I
couldn�t hear the conversation but Arnie stared at him with mouth agape. Arnie
never seemed surprised at anything. The Prime Minister had something big up his
sleeve. I was very curious.

When dessert was served Arnie just stared at the
huge cake that was brought out. It was decorated with the national flag of Horwathia. The waitress, dressed and hooded in gold latex,
placed the cake in front of my friend. Arnie was in shock. He just stared at
the dessert. �Mr. Prime Minister, is Arnie OK?� I asked.

�Our friend was given some amazing news. I�d spoil
the surprise if I let you in on the secret.�

So there was something going on. Now I was really
curious. What could have stunned Arnie to such an extent that he literally had
been turned into a basket case? I had never seen him like this. He was always
so composed.

�Ladies and Gentlemen: please gather in the
auditorium for something very special,� the head steward announced after the
last pieces of cake were devoured.

The one hundred guests slowly proceeded from the
dining room to the auditorium. The room was in fact a dance hall featuring a
stage, an orchestra pit, and countless small tables and chairs. In the center
of the dance floor was a covered mass. Two square crates of some sort were
covered with black velvet cloths. One box was seven feet tall and three feet
square. The other was roughly five feet high, three feet wide and four feet
long. Other than the fact that there were rectangular containers under the coverings,
no one had any idea what was hidden under them.

The Prime Minister and I chatted in the doorway,
waiting for the crowd to settle into their seats. Once everyone was situated he
beckoned Arnie and his wife to escort him into the room. As honored guests we
were invited to join in the small entourage as well.

Several assistants took their places near the boxes
as we walked to the center of the room. The surprise was about to be sprung. My
curiosity was at a head. I had to know what was going on. 

�Ladies and Gentlemen,� the head steward announced,
�May I present our beloved Prime Minister.�

�Thank you Osmond,� the leader of Horwathia said as he took the microphone. �As you all know,
I�ve been leading our great nation for the better part of sixteen years. With
the help of my devoted servants, as well as the support of my loving family,
I�ve lived an idyllic life. I�m sorry to say that this all must come to an
end.�

I stood in shock with countless onlookers. We had
all known the Prime Minister for so long we couldn�t possibly imagine another
ruler in his place. The murmur from the crowd began to rise. They became silent
when he raised his hand to continue.

�Ladies and Gentlemen, the succession of rulers in
this country has been based on the bloodline of my great, great grandfather. It
would be fitting to pass on the reins to a son or daughter. Unfortunately I
have no heir. Therefore in order for this country to continue its prosperity I
have decided that one of you will succeed me. After careful consultation with
my cabinet I put forth to them a single name. With heartfelt approval�.�

�No!� Tara said out loud.

�We have decided to appoint Arnold Meyer as the next
Prime Minister of Horwathia. Arnie, please come
here,� the Prime Minister ordered.

Arnie staggered forward. �Our friend seems a little
stunned.�

The crowd laughed for just a moment. �How about a
hand for your next Prime Minister?�

The crowd began to applaud, standing in the process.
The sight of Arnie�s face was almost comical. I knew
he had been given some amazing news. But to go from the head of a state business
to the leader of the entire country in just a few hours was something not often
seen. In fact I don�t know of a single historical incident that compared.

�Mr. Prime Minister. I can�t possibly lead this
country. I��

�You are the most qualified person I know. I trust
you implicitly. You�re organized and just. You don�t take unfair advantage of
people. Who would you think would be a better choice? There are none in my
cabinet qualified. They are all too young and inexperienced. You have
character. You have intelligence. You will lead this nation.�

�Can I think about it?� he asked, smiling at the
gentleman.

�Absolutely not!� he replied, laughing the huge
belly laugh. The crowd and I began laughing out loud and applauding.

�I guess I�m your man then. Tara, where are you?� he asked.

�Drinks!� The prime minister demanded. We need
drinks. We must toast our new leader! Long life and prosperity to our new Prime
Minister and his wife, Mr. and Mrs. Arnold Meyer.

The crowd raised their glasses and toasted the new
minister. Applause broke out again.

�Uh, what�s in the box? I asked the old PM.

His eyes went wide. �Oh my God! I almost forgot!�
Turning to the crowd he raised his hand to gather their attention. �Ladies and
Gentlemen, I nearly forgot my present to the new minister. As some of you older
gents are aware there is a tradition in Horwathia
that was started with my great, great grandfather�s inauguration. When a new
ruler takes the reins he must be presented with a dog and a horse. The dog
represents unending loyalty and the horse represents tireless duty and
devotion. My father altered this tradition somewhat as a statement against the
great invasion. When I took office my present was a human dog and pony. My
girls have just about run their lifespan in these roles and will be retired to
domestic service soon. It is only fitting that I continue the tradition by
offering my good friend a fresh pair of females. Osmond, if you would?�

Osmond ordered two stewards to pull the cloth from
each structure. Inside two Plexiglas containers were Cleo and Dina, pony and
puppy. The girls had been specially prepared for the presentation. Each had
been meticulously groomed. Each girl was dressed in gold colored latex with red
leather corsets. Their boots were gold as well. Any hair that was exposed,
including their tails, was liberally sprinkled with gold dust. Both wore gold
hoods, Cleo�s being open-faced, Dina�s being a full latex hood. From their
heads hung huge plumes of hair that was pushed through eight inch tubes to make
it stand out stiffly from their head and drape down their backs. Dina�s mouth
was filled with a gold ball that stretched her mouth and protruded from the
orifice of the latex hood. Cleo�s head was encompassed by a gold bridle with a
matching gold bit. And each wore jeweled collars.

The girls were each mounted in frames that kept them
on their knees. Cleo knelt upright on a four foot high pedestal while Dina was
placed on all fours on a four foot high platform. Each was secured at arms,
legs and neck by special manacles.

�Congratulations, Mr. Prime Minister,� the old prime
minister said.

�They�re magnificent,� my wife said. �Absolutely
amazing.�

&nbsp;

Arnie:

&nbsp;

The whole affair was such a shock to me that I
didn�t have any sense of what I was doing for nearly two weeks. The old
minister�s staff provided me with all I needed to acclimate to the new
position. It still didn�t register. Was I really the ruler of this country? I
still couldn�t accept that.

My sister hadn�t been present at the inauguration.
She was invited but she thought it was just a state dinner. She had no clue
that such a thing was going to happen. When she discovered the turn of events
she cursed a blue streak! �Why did I ever turn the invitation down?� she kept
saying to herself.

I gave her a big hug and asked her to stand at my
side when my coronation took place in the coming days. I also asked a favor of
her. I asked her to finish the facility in Grumm. She
seemed honored and grateful to accept the task. �I know you�ll do a fantastic
job,� I told her.

Perhaps that was the moment I realized that I was
the leader of this land. I began to feel like a manager. I had unlimited
resources. I could have virtually any pony or puppy I pleased. I looked forward
to touring the countryside in a sleigh pulled by ponygirls. I especially wanted
to play with the newest puppy, which at this time was learning the wants and
desires of my wife.

The two gifts were just the start of an entire
stable and kennel of females. I enjoyed their company and service frequently.
As winter faded into spring I took Cleo out in a single seater
to visit the country. With warmer afternoons I pushed her to her maximum
endurance as she pulled my ornate cart through the streets of the local towns.
I kept up a conversation with the local populace, most of whom had accepted the
new mode of transportation. They truly appreciated the beauty as well as the
practicality of a ponygirl. Their acceptance of the
puppies was not so well received, however.

The willingness of the population to put girls into
puppy roles diminished in our country. However, in Grumm
the demand grew to unbelievable proportions. My sister had worked with the
President of Grumm, lending the girls out for free
during certain holiday weekends. This exposed the men and women to their
charms, hooking them in the process. The acceptance in Grumm
was nearly as slow as in Horwathia. But at some
point, perhaps six months after I took office, the demand in Grumm skyrocketed. And so did the price. 

We weren�t geared for such production. My sister had
anticipated the situation far better than we had. She had built a kennel five
times larger than our own and made a deal with us. We would each produce only
one product. She would produce the puppies and we would specialize in ponies.
It made sense. The costs would remain low and our population would be well
supplied. 

&nbsp;

Some may say that the demands we placed on the
American women were harsh and abusive. I admit that it appears that way. But we
had a culture to preserve. We couldn�t let our history become diluted by an
invasion of foreign culture. In addition we had energy problems, a dying
economy, and an unhappy population. We needed something drastic. Putting these
women into these positions of servitude kept our two countries thriving. In the
end, doesn�t the need of the many outweigh the needs of a few?

&nbsp;

The End.
