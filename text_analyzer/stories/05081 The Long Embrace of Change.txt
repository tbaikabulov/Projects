The Long
Embrace of Change

&nbsp;

Part I

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

�OK � tell me again why we targeted this guy?�

&nbsp;

I looked down at the body crumpled at our feet.� He was a young dark-haired man, mid-20�s,
average height, average weight.� Average
clothes blue jeans.� Average shoes on his
feet.� Average haircut.� Everything about him was just�average.�
Nothing made him stand out from anyone else.

&nbsp;

Kim and I looked at each other.� �No real reason,� she said, prodding him onto
his belly with her foot.� The small black
dart we�d shot at him jutted up from the back of his neck, right at the base of
his skull.� �He�s here.� We�re here.�
Wrong place, wrong time for him, I guess.�

&nbsp;

His green eyes were still open, a look of complete
astonishment on his face.� �Actually,�
Kim said, �we selected him for a few reasons.�
No connections to anyone outside school.�
He also behaves like someone who would be submissive if given the
chance.� Although � � she looked back at
me � �he probably has no idea about that.�

&nbsp;

She bent down and pulled the dart from his neck.� �Nice shot for a first timer!� she said,
handing the dart to me.� �Usually, first
timers miss, or they hit the target in the middle of the back.� It takes two or three darts if that
happens.� You nailed him right off.�

&nbsp;

�I have to admit � I�m a little nervous about all of
this.�� I looked up and down the
alley.� It was deserted, as it usually
was this time of night.� Our target was
probably taking a shortcut on his way home.�
A few people did that.� Some
became targets.

&nbsp;

I pulled the backpack off his shoulders and peeked
inside.� There were several textbooks
inside, all with his name written on the cover � �Chris.�� Scientist of some sort, based on the book
titles.

&nbsp;

Chris� former life was now over.� His new life was beginning.� He wouldn�t really know it for a while,
though.� A shame to waste all of that
education, but he�d be happier in the long run.�
And I would make him happy, just as he would make me happy.

&nbsp;

I could see why Kim chose this particular alleyway � no
windows looked down on the dimly-lit pavement, and our van blocked anyone on
the street outside from looking in.� A
couple of nearby colleges provided a steady stream of students as raw
material.� And none of the targets ever
actually disappeared � not right away, anyway.�
In fact, they never even noticed the fact that they got home about an
hour later than usual, or the painful welt that looked to have been left by a
needle of some sort, or the odd bruises and scrapes that spoke of a fall onto
the sidewalk - a fall they couldn�t remember, and didn�t even care to remember.

&nbsp;

��He�ll be on his way
home in no time,� Kim said.� �He went
down without so much as a grunt.�
Seriously � he was out before he hit the ground.� No worries.�
We�ll brush his clothes off and he�ll never know what hit him. �Heck, he�ll never know he was hit!� Let�s get him into the van.�

&nbsp;

We grabbed his arms and, together, pulled him into the open
back doors of the van.� Once he was lying
on the cot set up inside the van, we closed the doors.

&nbsp;

Kim started an IV line into his left arm.� �This�ll take a few minutes to work.�

&nbsp;

�What�s in it?�

&nbsp;

�Combination of drugs.�
One of them counteracts the sedative from the dart.� Another keeps him paralyzed, so he�s awake
but can�t move.� Others work on different
parts of his brain.� They keep him in a
state of strong suggestiveness while we program him.�� She finished setting up the IV line and said,
�we should probably step outside � it�s hard to tell when they can start
hearing you.�

&nbsp;

We stepped out of the van and into the alleyway to wait for
the new drugs to take effect.

&nbsp;

��OK,� I said, �now
what?�

&nbsp;

�First, we get him conditioned to the sound of the
whistle.�� She pulled a whistle out from
under her shirt, hanging by a chain around her neck.� She�d given me an identical whistle that morning.� It was unique� it made a strange high-pitched
sound humans could just barely hear.� Not
quite a dog whistle � dogs didn�t start barking if they heard it � but just
barely within the hearing range for people.�
Nothing else sounded like it � which was intentional.� If we were to program our targets to sounds
they might hear anywhere else, the process would be ruined.� �Second, we give him his first set of
instructions.� Then we wait.�

&nbsp;

I was anxious for this whole thing to end.� Kim had finally let me in on the secret
operation she and her Circle ran � and now, I couldn�t wait to be one of
them.� To be an owner.

&nbsp;

But ownership meant subjugation, and that took time.� Just kidnapping and brainwashing someone
didn�t work very well � it was quicker, but sloppier; and it carried too much
risk of having the target revert back.�
Better to get someone willing to become a slave than to enslave the
unwilling. 

&nbsp;

As time went on, their friends noticed the changes � but the
targets never really did.� And when the
time came, they�d pull out of school and � best of all � willingly come to
us.� We weren�t kidnapping them at
all.� It was all done voluntarily.� Eagerly, even.� They wanted to serve us � they just didn�t
know it yet.

&nbsp;

That�s why the Circle chose submissive men.� One can mess around with free will only so
far.� It�s amazingly hard to get someone
to do something they really find repugnant, no matter how much you dope up
their nervous system and hypnotically condition them.� The trick wasn�t to change their minds about
what they wanted to do � rather, it was to awaken interests they probably
didn�t know were there.� 

&nbsp;

We leaned against the doors of the van for a little
while.� �The first six months will drag
on,� she said, � but then things get a little intense � for him as well as for
you.� But it�ll be worth it.� We�ll check in with him every couple of
months, give him a new set of instructions.�
And don�t forget � members of the Circle will be involved every step of
the way, and they�ll contact us with progress reports.� He meets up with his first Circle member
tomorrow night, so if something goes seriously wrong, we�ll find out soon.�

&nbsp;

She glanced at her watch.�
�Should be ready about now.� Let�s
get to work.�

The Long Embrace of Change

&nbsp;

Part II

&nbsp;

I felt groggy the next
morning.� I had no idea why � I stayed
late at school, but no later than I�ve done in the past, and I came straight
home.� No beers with the guys, nothing.� Just home.

&nbsp;

My name is � was � Chris.� I was a biologist. 

&nbsp;

In hindsight, it�s incredibly
ironic that this happened to me, an expert on solitary wasp behavior.� To know why, one must first understand
solitary wasps.� 

&nbsp;

Solitary wasps don�t build big
nests like hornets do.� They live
alone.� And their reproductive behavior
comes right out of science fiction.

&nbsp;

The tarantula hawks (Pepsis formosa and Pepsis thisbe) are good examples.�
They live in deserts where tarantulas can be found.� When it�s time, the female finds a tarantula
and stings it.� Her venom paralyzes the
tarantula, which is then dragged into a shallow burrow.� An egg is laid on the paralyzed
tarantula.� When the egg hatches, the
larva feeds on the tarantula until it becomes an adult wasp and digs itself out
of the burrow.

&nbsp;

But here�s the totally creepy part
� the tarantula isn�t killed.� It�s
paralyzed.� That means it�s still alive when the wasp larva starts eating it.� And it can�t do a damn thing about it.

&nbsp;

Different solitary wasps target
different prey.� Some only attack
cicadas, for example.� Others find grubs
burrowed in wood and insert long, thin ovipositors right through the wood,
laying an egg on the grub.� In some
cases, the larva deliberately leaves the vital organs of its host for last,
keeping it alive as long as possible to keep it from starting to rot.�� 

&nbsp;

No one knows if the victims are
conscious or able to feel pain while their being eaten alive.� Part of me wants to believe they�re not, if
only because the alternative is too horrible to imagine.� 

&nbsp;

But a few solitary wasps are much
cooler than that.� They actually manage
to direct the behavior of their host.�
Biological mind control.� One of
them injects venom directly into the brain of a cockroach.� As a result, the cockroach lets itself be led
into the burrow and is uninterested in escape.�
It�s not paralyzed - it just sits there, being eaten alive. 

&nbsp;

Then there�s Hymenoepimecis
argyrophaga.� It�s a Costa Rican wasp
that attacks a small spider called Plesiometa
argyra.� Like the roach-controller, Hymenoepimecis doesn�t paralyze the
spider and is more interested in mind control.�
But in this case, the control is much more elaborate.� The tiny mother wasp simply lays an egg on
the spider and flies away.� When the egg
hatches, the larva begins to suck on the spider and, while doing so, drools a
bunch of chemicals into the wound.� At a
particular time, these chemicals cause the spider to stop spinning its own web
and start spinning a cocoon for the larva.�
The spider never knows why it suddenly decides to build cocoons � it only
knows it must.� It works furiously, as if
the future of the whole world rests on the completion of this one cocoon.� Once the cocoon is finished, the larva kills
and eats the spider, crawls into the cocoon, and finishes its transition to an
adult wasp.

&nbsp;

Food, clothing, and shelter all from one easy
source. 

&nbsp;

My own work was simple enough � I was trying to
figure out how, exactly, the chemicals made by these wasps control another
animal�s behavior.� And that�s why what
happened to me was so ironic � a few chemicals, along with some other
behavioral conditioning I still don�t completely understand, made me want to
change to please � to serve � another.� 

&nbsp;

So anyway, I felt stiff getting out of bed.� I ran my hand along the back of my neck � it
felt sore for some reason � and noticed a bruise on the inside of my left
elbow.� I had no idea how that got there.

&nbsp;

I washed up and started to get ready for class.� I taught two labs and had a late-afternoon
seminar.� We were two months away from
the end of the term.� But, just as I was
putting my jeans on, I stopped.� 

&nbsp;

There was something in the air - a high-pitched sound of
some sort.� I didn�t hear it as much as felt it.�
It wasn�t loud � in fact, it was barely audible.� It was almost painful.� It stopped me in my tracks.

&nbsp;

And then, for reasons I still don�t understand, I found
myself walking into the bathroom, picking up a pair of scissors, and cutting my
goatee off.� I didn�t consciously want to remove my goatee � I
thought it looked good on me � but for some reason, I felt compelled to shave
it off.� It had to go.� It was as if nothing could be more important
at that moment.� I managed to keep my hands
from shaking as I lathered up my face and razored the rest of the whiskers
away.

&nbsp;

Once that was done, I finished getting dressed and sat down
for breakfast.� And as I did so, I opened
the medicine bottle sitting on my table and took two pills � one yellow, one
blue.� I closed the pill bottle and
headed out the door.

&nbsp;

That the bottle had no prescription label didn�t bother me
in the least.� That I couldn�t remember
being told to take pills, or having ever taken these pills before, or what the
pills were for � those didn�t bother me either.�
It was simply what I did in the morning � one yellow pill, one blue
pill, taken down with my morning orange juice.�


&nbsp;

I had a sense of excitement all day.� I can�t describe it.� It wasn�t the fact that I�d shaved my beard
off � I kept rubbing my denuded chin all day, but I tended to grow and remove
goatees fairly regularly � it wasn�t unfamiliar.� I couldn�t think of anything scheduled for
after seminar.� I didn�t have anything
special planned for my students.� There
weren�t any deadlines coming up, and I wasn�t expecting a package.� I just felt as though I had big plans, and I
couldn�t wait.� 

&nbsp;

I felt sorry for my students.� I must have spoken a mile a minute,
stuttering the whole way.� I just
couldn�t finish my classes fast enough.�
By the end of my second lab, I was pounding the chalk against the
blackboard, sending chalk chips flying though the air with every letter I
wrote.

&nbsp;

I found sitting through seminar intolerable.� I don�t even remember what we were talking
about.� I just had to get out of
there.� I fidgeted in my chair.� It was impossible to take notes.� The professor and the other students in the
room kept glaring at me as I tapped my pencil against the table, staring at the
clock, practically willing the clock to hit 5:00.

&nbsp;

Once 5:00 arrived, I leapt from the chair and bolted from
the room.� I hastily threw my textbooks
and homework to be graded into my bag and ran for the door.

&nbsp;

And, once I was outside, I turned left.� Why, I didn�t know � home was to the
right.� But I just had to go left.

&nbsp;

The stores along this stretch of the street were mostly
fast-food restaurants catering to students.�
There were also one or two nightclubs and a couple of bookstores.� My pace quickened.

&nbsp;

I walked a few blocks and stopped at a door.� The sign over the door said, �TATTOO &amp;
BODY PIERCING.�� I stepped in.

&nbsp;

My heart was pounding.�
Why was I walking into a tattoo studio?�
It was as though someone was making me do this � and oddly, I didn�t
seem to mind.

&nbsp;

I walked to the front counter.� It was empty except for a woman at the front
counter.� She had black crewcut hair,
harsh makeup, a ring through her nasal septum, and at least ten piercings in
each ear.� She looked up.� �May I help you?�

&nbsp;

The words were out of my mouth before I realized I�d said
them.� �Yes � I�m here to get my ears and
nipples pierced.�� 

&nbsp;

I stood there with what must have been a completely
dumbfounded expression.� Never, in all of
my life, had I ever thought of piercing an ear, much less my nipples.� The thought never crossed my mind.� I wasn�t opposed to the idea, mind you � lots
of my students had piercings.� But
me?� Wasn�t my style.� And I said �ears,� plural.� Both
ears?� I knew some guys did that, but
most men pierced only one ear, not both.�


&nbsp;

And yet I just couldn�t wait to be pierced.� I can�t really describe how I felt.� It was as though someone was living in the
back of my head, whispering the idea to me.�
It wasn�t an instruction � not really, anyway.� It didn�t feel like I was being made to do this - I honestly wanted
it.� Someone had made a suggestion, and
for whatever reason it seemed like the most brilliant idea I�d ever heard.� I don�t know why I wanted it; I�d never
wanted it before, and I could think of no compelling reason why I should want
it now, but I wanted it nonetheless.�
Wanted it badly.� Needed it, and needed it now.

&nbsp;

She looked at me..� My
intense need to have my ears and nipples pierced must have shown through in my
voice, and I can�t imagine how that looked.�
But however I looked, she didn�t seem surprised.� In fact, she almost looked as though she
expected me to come through the door at that very moment and ask for those
specific services.� �OK � your name?�

&nbsp;

�Chris.�

&nbsp;

�OK.� Fill this out �
I have to make a quick phone call, and we�ll get started.�

&nbsp;

She handed me a disclaimer form and a pen.� While I was filling in my name and address,
the piercer stepped away from the counter and made a call on her cell
phone.� I couldn�t hear what she was
saying, but she occasionally nodded and glanced in my direction while she
spoke.

&nbsp;

She finished her conversation just as I finished filling out
the form.� We walked through the main
part of the studio.� The walls were
covered with sheets of colorful flash � ships, roses, snakes, pinup girls,
dragons, abstract designs of all sorts.�
She led me into a small room in the back of the studio, turned on a
light, closed the door, and said, �OK � shirt off and have a seat.�

&nbsp;

Almost mechanically, I pulled my shirt off and sat in what
looked like a dentist�s chair.�
Meanwhile, the woman from the counter pulled on a pair of latex gloves.

&nbsp;

�14 gauge OK?�� I had
no idea what she meant, but nodded anyway.�
Whatever she was doing was what I desperately wanted done, and I still
didn�t really know what that was.� And as
I awaited the needles, I found my cock growing hard.

&nbsp;

She stepped over to me and touched my earlobes with a
felt-tipped pen.� �Placement OK?�

&nbsp;

She held up a mirror.�
Each of my earlobes had a small black dot.� I nodded again.� I grew stiffer still.

&nbsp;

��This�ll sting a
little, but not too badly.�� In the space
of a minute, she�d slipped a long, thin needle through each of my earlobes and
threaded a stainless steel ring behind each one.� The rings were each about half an inch in
diameter � much bigger than I�d imagined.�
She closed each ring with a small steel ball.� They hurt a little.� 

&nbsp;

By now, my erection was clearly visible as a bulge in my
jeans.� Sitting was painful.� The woman piercing me glanced down every so
often, betraying her knowledge of my condtion with the slightest fleeting grin.

&nbsp;

�Nipple time!�� She
changed gloves and placed a small black dot on each side of each nipple.� She then clamped what looked like a hemostat
on my left nipple.� The tips of the
hemostat were loops.� 

&nbsp;

The clamp was very painful � but not nearly as painful as
having the needle actually go through the loops and pierce the nipple
itself.� That has to have been the most
painful thing I�ve ever felt.� My whole
gut seemed to clench, as though the needle passed right through my
stomach.� I cried out.� But it was mercifully quick, and in no time
at all I was looking down at a half-inch ring, just like those in my ears,
dangling from my left nipple.

&nbsp;

A minute later, the other nipple was pierced.� It was just as painful.� 

&nbsp;

�Can you excuse me?� I asked.� She nodded and pointed to an open door across
from the chair.� I practically dove
through the door, which led into a small bathroom, and closed it behind
me.� I almost came right in my pants � as
soon as my underwear was pulled below my balls, a jet of semen shot straight
out and hit the mirror behind the toilet.�
In my reflection, I stared in amazement at the steel rings fastened to
my chest.� They looked amazing!� And somehow, I knew they would look
amazing.� 

&nbsp;

I finished coming, trying very hard to keep from moaning,
cleaned up the mess, and pulled my pants off.

&nbsp;

I needed a minute to catch my breath.� When I was ready, I stepped out of the
bathroom to find the piercer on her cell phone.�
As soon as she saw me, she hung up.�
�Are you OK?�

I was still panting.�
�Yeah.� Yeah�.must have been a
little nervous about this.� Got
sick.�� I wiped my chin with the back of
my hand, as though to wipe my mouth clean.

&nbsp;

She nodded.� �That
happens a lot.�

&nbsp;

I put my shirt back on.�
The piercer handed me a bottle of saline solution and a care sheet.� I paid her and left.

&nbsp;

I walked home.� As
soon as I was in, I pulled my shirt off and looked at myself in the
mirror.� I couldn�t pull my eyes away
from my ears and chest. 

&nbsp;

After a while, I found myself rubbing my groin, making
myself hard again.� While staring into
the mirror, I brought myself to another climax.�
I hadn�t had two orgasms � both of them large - within the space of a
couple of hours in years.� But soon, the
events of the day faded into the back of my mind, I crawled into bed, and
drifted off to sleep.� 

&nbsp;

I couldn�t put my finger on it, but it felt like my whole
life was changing at that moment.

&nbsp;

The Long Embrace of Change

&nbsp;

Part III

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Kim and I sat on the roof of one
of the buildings over the alley.� It was
morning.� The sidewalks were almost
deserted � exams at the universities had just ended, so most of the students
had gone home for summer break.� But
Chris, being a dedicated graduate student � at least for the moment �� was still spending
time in his lab, and we expected him to pass this way any minute.

&nbsp;

At least, he should be on his way
here if the two-month-old instructions still held.

&nbsp;

�Don�t worry, Kelly,� Kim
said.� �We got the report right away that
he got his piercings as instructed.� He�s
been showing up at the gym almost daily, taking the aerobics class we told him
to take.� It�s working out fine so far �
no reason to think it�ll change now.�

&nbsp;

�But what if something goes
wrong?� What if something keeps him from
coming?�

&nbsp;

�We sack him later.� The programming never actually wears
off.� It�d add a few weeks to the whole
thing, but that�s it.�

&nbsp;

�And if someone else sees?�

&nbsp;

�What�s to see?� No one else can hear the whistle; all he�ll
do is turn around and walk the other way.�

&nbsp;

We waited for a few more long
minutes.� Then, Kim touched my shoulder
with her right hand and pointed with her left.�
�Here he comes � get ready.�

I had to admit, the procedure was
working.� His hair was getting longer,
and I could clearly see the earrings.� 

&nbsp;

.�The hormones are starting to
give him tits!� Kim whispered.� I could
clearly see the bulges in his chest.�
They were small, but given another few weeks, and it would be painful
for him to walk around without a bra.�
His ass was starting to get some padding as well.

&nbsp;

He was starting to become she, and
she was starting to look good.

&nbsp;

I pulled out the long brass
whistle I carried on a chain around my neck and put it to my lips.� �Remember,� Kim said, � two long blasts, then
a short one.�� 

&nbsp;

Two long blasts � two seconds long
� followed by a half-second blast.� I
blew hard into the whistle, even though I knew it would be all but silent
regardless.

&nbsp;

Chris immediately stopped in his
tracks.� His head was cocked to one side,
and his face seemed to betray confusion, as if he couldn�t decide whether
someone had called out his name or not.�
But a couple of seconds later, he turned right around and started to
walk back the way he came.

&nbsp;

His pace quickened with every
step, and by the time he was at the end of the alley, he was almost
jogging.� He turned the corner and
disappeared from view.

&nbsp;

True to Kim�s assurances, the two
or three people on the sidewalk took almost no notice. �All they saw was someone decide
to turn around in a hurry.� Maybe he�d
forgotten something at home.

&nbsp;

That, Kim and I knew, was not the
case.� He had � absolutely had � to go to the store, buy some
items, and then go home.� Then his day
was just beginning.

The Long Embrace of Change

&nbsp;

Part IV

&nbsp;

I fumbled with the keys as I unlocked the door to my
flat.� Eventually, I got the door open
and I rushed in.� I nearly dropped the
bags I was carrying as I did so.

&nbsp;

I�m not sure when I made my decision.� In fact, it wasn�t even clear, deep in the
deepest hollow of my mind, that the decision was mine at all.� My ears felt as if I should be hearing a
faint noise, but I couldn�t really hear anything.� Once the decision was made, it became a
mission.� It had to be done.� There were things I just had to buy right
away and use that very day.� Nothing
would stop me.� So I turned around and
went to the store.� Now I was home again.

&nbsp;

I lined up what I�d just bought around my bathroom sink � a
new set of electric hair clippers, a new razor (one of the type used by women
to shave their legs in the bath), a satchel of bath crystals, and a couple of
red candles that smelled like roses.� 

&nbsp;

I took off my clothes and looked in the mirror.� My clothes didn�t fit very well anymore � I�d
been going to the gym, and for the past two weeks my breakfasts and lunches
consisted of weight-loss shakes, supplemented with my morning pills.� My waist was much flatter and firmer than
before.� I wasn�t doing weights, so I
wasn�t sure why my chest looked a bit larger, but I didn�t really mind.� In fact, I liked the way it looked.� And now that the nipple piercings had more or
less healed, my chest felt really good.�
This was especially true when I gently fingered the rings, making my
nipples � and often my cock � erect.� 

&nbsp;

I turned out the lights and lit the candles.� The bathroom didn�t have a window, so the
room was lit only by the warm glow of the rose-scented candles.� I put on some music � Beethoven piano sonatas
� and started the bath.� I put some of the
fragrant bath crystals in the filling bathtub.�
And, while the bath was pouring, I took out the clippers.

&nbsp;

There wasn�t a moment�s hesitation in my actions.� I turned the clippers on and ran them up and
down my arms, chest, armpits, and legs.�
I stood with my back to the mirror, looking over my shoulder, as I ran
the clippers over my shoulders and back.�
Finally, I pressed them against my butt and sheared off the hair on my
ass.

&nbsp;

I was already half-hard by the time I got home, but I was at
full attention now.� Clumps of dark, wiry
hair tumbled the ground.� The cold,
vibrating blades felt good against my body.�


&nbsp;

My body was being stripped of its hair!� I couldn�t remember ever wanting to do this,
but I worked as though my whole life had been meant for this one moment � as
though I wanted this more than anything else in the world.

&nbsp;

And then it was time for my crotch.� I hesitated for just a moment � long enough
to enjoy the feeling of the clippers in my hand � and then dove them into my
pubic hair.� Before long, I had removed
everything but a little inverted-triangle patch right over my stiff cock.� Gently, I ran them along my cock�s shaft and,
more gently still, my scrotum.� I trimmed
the hair of my over-cock triangle down, but didn�t shave it off completely.

&nbsp;

The vibration against my genitals was almost more than I
could take.� I felt my hands begin to
shake with anticipation, forcing me to slow down a bit.� Once or twice, I found myself holding the
clippers against my balls just to enjoy the sensation.� Pre-cum began to drip from the tip of my
penis.� 

&nbsp;

After a few moments, it was done.� I stood surrounded by the cloud of hair
clipplings around my feet.� I was
breathing heavily.

&nbsp;

By now, the bath was full.�
I stepped in.� The hot perfumed
water soothed me. �I soaked for a few
minutes and then smeared shaving foam all over my body.� Running the razor over my skin was as erotic
as the clippers � I was familiar with the feeling of a razor blade against my
face, but against skin that had never been shaved, it was more intense.� The newly-bare skin, exposed to the air for
the first time since puberty, seemed extra-sensitive.� 

&nbsp;

I carefully shaved my cock and balls, making sure to leave
sharp, crisp lines along the sides of the triangle.� My balls were engorged with cum and ached for
release.� I left my ass for last,
carefully shaving the hair from around my asshole.

&nbsp;

Once I was fully shaved, I soaked in the bath for a while,
enjoying the feeling of warm water against my nakedness � a nakedness greater
than I�d felt since I was a child.

&nbsp;

I remained stiff the whole time.� Finally I stood in the bathtub and rubbed
myself to climax, spraying cum into the air above the water.� It was one of the most intense orgasms I�d
ever felt.��� 

&nbsp;

I soaked in the bath for a while after coming.� I really should have been drying off, getting
dressed, and heading out to the lab � instead, I lazily stroked my bare skin
with my fingertips, enjoying the glassy smoothness.� 

&nbsp;

After I got out of the tub, I gave myself a good, long look
in the mirror.� I looked amazing.� I felt liberated, as though the body hair had
been holding me back from�..well, from something I couldn�t really define.� My hands began stroking my body up and
down.� It wasn�t long before the sight
and feeling of my freshly-shaved body got me good and erect; as the last of the
Beethoven sonatas finished, I came again.

&nbsp;

I decided to go to the lab after all.� It was mid-day, but I could at least get some
writing done.� But I had a hard time
focusing on my work � between the memory of what I looked like, naked, no body
hair, swelling chest bejeweled, and the way my clothes felt against my skin, my
thoughts were elsewhere.� I could�t wait
to get home and see what it would feel like to sleep naked without body hair. 

&nbsp;

On the way home, I took a detour to the same body piercing
studio where I�d had my ears and nipples pierced before.� I�d decided to get a second set of piercings
on my earlobes.� The same black-haired
woman was working; the sides of her head had been shaved, giving her a short
black mohawk, but little else had changed.�
I signed the disclaimer form while she made a quick phone call
(occasionally looking at me through the corner of her eye), and then I had my
ears pierced again.

&nbsp;

Just as I turned to leave, I felt compelled to stop.� The same weird sensation of hearing something
I couldn�t hear hit me, and I turned around almost mechanically.� The piercer stood before me, putting
something I couldn�t see in her pocket, and she said, �You will follow me.� 

&nbsp;

I did.� I don�t know why I did � I just did.

&nbsp;

We went back to the room where my nipples had been pierced
two months earlier.� She closed the door,
looked at me, and said, �Strip.�

&nbsp;

Again without hesitation, I pulled my clothes off, standing
before her with my newly hairless body.

&nbsp;

She looked at me up and down, then pulled out her cell phone
and dialed a number.� �Yes, he�s
shaved.� Did an acceptable job.� You want me to go with the PA?�� She nodded and put the phone down.

&nbsp;

�Sit in the chair.�� I
did so.

&nbsp;

�You will relax.� You
will not move.� You will not speak.� Is that clear?�� I nodded.

&nbsp;

For some reason, I wasn�t getting aroused.� I should have been � the piercer was very
attractive.� Was it the embarrassment of
lying naked before a stranger?� Was it
something in her voice?� I still don�t
know, but I remained flaccid before her.

&nbsp;

I even remained flaccid as her rubber-gloved hand picked up
my penis.� Her other hand slipped a thin
plastic tube a short way up my urethra, causing a strange burning
sensation.� She then took a needle and
pushed it into my penis just behind the head.�
In a few seconds, a steel captive-bead ring had been threaded through
the hole and out through my urethra.� I�d
been pierced yet again.

&nbsp;

It hurt, though not quite as badly as the nipples.� 

&nbsp;

�This will bleed a little tonight and tomorrow, so make sure
you keep it clean.� You will also have to
sit to pee from now on.� Is that
clear?�� I nodded.� �You will always sit to pee from now on.� Get dressed.�

&nbsp;

I�m not quite sure what happened after that.� I vaguely remember seeing her pull a long,
brass tube from her pocket, but my next memory was of me walking home, trying
not to let my underpants chafe my newly-pierced cock.

&nbsp;

That night, sleeping was pure torture.� The feeling of the sheets against my hairless
body was erotic.� This tended to make me
erect, which caused the new piercing to hurt and bleed.� So I found myself lying naked, without
sheets, just to keep myself from the agony of an orgasm.� And I dreaded having to use the toilet � the
head of my dick burned furiously when I urinated � seated - for the first time.

&nbsp;

Later on, the inner sense I�d been having on and off over
the past few months � that my life was somehow changing course, and that
someone else was helping chart the course � hit me again.� And I didn�t mind � didn�t mind at all.� That put the thought of the pain in my cock
aside, and I dozed off.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;













The Long Embrace of Change

Part V

�Wow &#8211; she&#8217;s really coming along!�

We sat at a window in a coffee shop downtown.&nbsp; It was a couple of blocks away from the campus where Chris worked, and she (though, biologically, Chris was still he) was headed home.&nbsp; It was a late Monday afternoon.&nbsp; She walked along the sidewalk on the other side of the street.&nbsp; She had no idea we were there &#8211; in fact, had no conscious idea we even existed.

I had to agree with Kim.&nbsp; She really was coming along.&nbsp; Four months after I&#8217;d last seen her &#8211; six months after we&#8217;d started her conversion &#8211; she was really starting to look like the woman she was becoming. Her hair was now tied back in a short ponytail.&nbsp; Her ass was rounding out nicely, and her tits were visible as a pair of bulges under her shirt.&nbsp; People who worked with her every day probably didn&#8217;t notice them, but I only saw her sporadically.&nbsp; She wore jeans, but if wall was going well, her body under those clothes was as smooth-shaven as her face.&nbsp; The drugs she was taking caused her facial hair to come in more lightly, so at the end of a long day, there was virtually no shadow.&nbsp; I wondered if she even had to shave every day anymore.

�Not too much longer now, you know.&nbsp; You come up with a new name for her yet?�

I turned back toward Kim.&nbsp; �She&#8217;ll be Tina.�&nbsp; I nodded.&nbsp; �Yes.&nbsp; Tina.&nbsp; My Tina.�&nbsp; I liked the sound of that &#8211; my Tina.
&nbsp; 
Up to now, most of the changes had been cosmetic.&nbsp; She could now clearly see the changes in his appearance, and her attitude toward herself was changing, but as far as she was concerned, she was still Chris &#8211; a he.&nbsp; It was fundamentally no different from making someone play dress-up or wear a costume.&nbsp; We had to awaken a new self within her &#8211; one that would grow as her body changed and eventually consume the former self.&nbsp; She would replace him, as though his past was nourishment for another.&nbsp; 

And the new self &#8211; Tina &#8211; would submit herself completely to me.&nbsp; 

Behavioral changes were also underway.&nbsp; She started shaving her body two months ago &#8211; we would soon see if the practice had become routine &#8211; and, at the time, got a Prince Albert that forced her to piss sitting down.&nbsp; The latter behavior was reinforced hypnotically by the Circle member who operated the piercing studio.&nbsp; But so far, it was all just motions &#8211; nothing that really reoriented her view of herself.

I was really becoming drawn toward her.&nbsp; Partly, it was appreciation of what was, in part, my own creation &#8211; but something about the former Chris was really taking root in my soul.&nbsp; I could see this person becoming a lovely young woman.&nbsp; The more I watched her, the more I found her quirks endearing.&nbsp; The more I appreciated her developing curves, her face, her eyes.&nbsp; Yes, I was going to own her &#8211; but I was also starting to really love her.&nbsp; 

It&#8217;s hard to explain the kind of love I felt.&nbsp; It was somewhat like the love felt by an owner toward a pet.&nbsp; This was someone I would care for, and she would care for (and serve) me.&nbsp; I would be everything to her.&nbsp; But it was more than that.&nbsp; Not quite romantic love, but there was also the growing realization that this person &#8211; soon to be a male lesbian &#8211; would be able to satisfy me in many ways.&nbsp; 

Odd that I should feel this way, since I&#8217;d never really spoken with her.&nbsp; I&#8217;d spoken to her, but it was only to issue instructions, and she was in a deep trance every time.&nbsp; I really wanted to snap my fingers, get her out of her trance, talk to her.&nbsp; But I couldn&#8217;t.

This was soon to change. That morning, I&#8217;d moved temporarily into an apartment near Kim&#8217;s business.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t far away from where I worked, and I would only live there until we finished the conversion process &#8211; a few weeks.

The name of the apartment complex was wonderfully ironic &#8211; �Silk-Trappe Apartments.�&nbsp; The name had nothing to do with the silken traps spun by the Circle when they converted young men into male lesbian slaves &#8211; the building happens to be on the corner of Trappe Avenue and 10th Street.&nbsp; Trappe Ave. is named after a tycoon who once controlled much of the city.&nbsp; Peter Trappe made his fortune from silk.&nbsp; He was able to import silk thread from overseas cheap &#8211; he owned the silkworm farms in Asia and a fleet of clipper ships &#8211; and sell it to the people who made the silk textiles that made our city famous.&nbsp; The silk factories were all clustered along this stretch of 10th St., which has always been called �Silk Street.�&nbsp; 

The silk industry was long gone, and the old factories had all been converted to other things &#8211; coffee shops, clothing stores, even a couple of lingerie shops.&nbsp; The piercing studio where we&#8217;d had Chris pierce his ears, nipples, and cock was at one end of old Silk Street &#8211; the end closest to the university campus, where more upscale shopping gave way to cheap eateries.&nbsp; And Kim&#8217;s business, a beauty salon and day spa, was right in the middle.

We left the coffee shop and followed Chris.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t far to the alley that she took to her apartment, and as soon as she turned to it, Kim blew through the whistle a few times.

I heard nothing.&nbsp; Neither did anyone standing around us.&nbsp; But it stopped Chris as though an invisible wall had suddenly sprung from the ground.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t stagger or stumble &#8211; she simply stopped walking and stood still, with her legs spread out slightly and arms to the sides.

We walked over to her.&nbsp; Her face was completely expressionless.&nbsp; Her eyes were open, but not widely &#8211; there was no appearance of surprise.&nbsp; Her lips were slightly parted.&nbsp; 

We checked to make sure no one else was in the alley &#8211; unlikely at this time of day &#8211; and hiked up her right jeans leg a few inches.&nbsp; The exposed skin was hairless.&nbsp; She was shaving her legs, at least.

We gently pushed at her shoulders, forcing her to back up against a wall.&nbsp; An abandoned refrigerator stood between Chris and the opening to the alleyway &#8211; no one could see her but us.&nbsp; Kim nodded to me, and I quickly undid her belt buckle and unfastened the top button.&nbsp; Thankfully, her jeans had a zipper and not button fly, so I was able to quickly and smoothly draw her jeans open.&nbsp; I pulled back on the elastic of her briefs and saw that, apart from a fuzzy dark brown triangle right over her ringed dick, her crotch was still smooth and clean.&nbsp; 

I turned to Kim and gave her a thumbs-up sign.

We faced Chris and gave her instructions.&nbsp; She stood passively and soaked them in.












The Long Embrace of Change

Part VI

I couldn&#8217;t believe how much my life had changed in just a day. I reflected on this as I walked toward the doctor&#8217;s office.&nbsp; 

Actually, I&#8217;d been changing for a while.&nbsp; On the outside, this was obvious, and it wasn&#8217;t just that I&#8217;d pierced my ears or hadn&#8217;t had a haircut in months.&nbsp; My body&#8217;s shape was changing, and I wasn&#8217;t sure it was all exercise and diet.&nbsp; My abdomen was thinner than ever, so I suppose that&#8217;s why my hips seemed to spread out further, but my chest was also expanding.&nbsp; It almost looked like I&#8217;d started to sprout a pair of budding breasts.&nbsp; Physically, I felt fine &#8211; my nipples felt tingly from time to time, but I assumed that was from the piercings.&nbsp; And I wasn&#8217;t obese, either &#8211; quite the opposite, in fact &#8211; so what I had weren&#8217;t the kind of man-tits you see on fat people.&nbsp; 

Rationally, I should have seen a doctor.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t know why it was happening.&nbsp; But I did nothing.&nbsp; In part, this was from embarrassment.&nbsp; I mean, how does one go to a doctor and explain that he seems to be growing a pair of tits?&nbsp; But more than that, I didn&#8217;t dislike it.&nbsp; In fact, part of me deep in my core actually liked it.&nbsp; My nipples were becoming more sensitive, and I found myself rubbing and pinching them after each bath.&nbsp; In public, I wore loose clothes to de-emphasize my proto-bust; but at home, I would strip and look at myself in the mirror.&nbsp; My hairless body, my pierced ears, my tits &#8211; the effect was almost, well, girlish.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know why I got excited, whether it was fact of the change or the image in the mirror.&nbsp; I would get hard, and while I looked at my feminine chest, my hands would play with my masculine genitals until I came.

My mind was changing, too &#8211; changing in ways I couldn&#8217;t actually name.&nbsp; My attention was less and less focused on research.&nbsp; I no longer had a future in science.&nbsp; My work was getting slow and sloppy, as if I didn&#8217;t really care, as if it was all an afterthought.&nbsp; I was wasting my time and didn&#8217;t belong.&nbsp; I needed to get off the path I was following and find another.&nbsp; 

So yesterday, a Monday morning, I quit grad school.&nbsp; 

My advisor wasn&#8217;t surprised.&nbsp; He&#8217;d seen my dedication slip over the past few months.&nbsp; He&#8217;d seen the careless mistakes I was making, and he&#8217;d watched me daydream for hours at a time.&nbsp; I&#8217;d stopped participating in seminars &#8211; I&#8217;d just sit still while the others discussed the subject.&nbsp; I was going through the motions, but that&#8217;s all &#8211; I was no longer progressing.&nbsp; Whatever inner drive I&#8217;d had when I started was long gone.&nbsp; 

I didn&#8217;t really tell him I was quitting for good.&nbsp; I mumbled about needing time off, about finding myself, about looking for direction in life.&nbsp; Maybe I&#8217;d come back, I said.&nbsp; I knew I wouldn&#8217;t, and I think my advisor understood that.&nbsp; So he wished me well and helped me clean up my bench.

The hardest question to answer was what I&#8217;d do next.&nbsp; I had no real idea.&nbsp; I was distracted away from my work, but not toward anything in particular.&nbsp; I really didn&#8217;t know where I was headed.&nbsp; 

Quitting school meant giving up my fellowship.&nbsp; That meant getting a job.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t mind that, really &#8211; something mindless, mechanical.&nbsp; Something to keep the bills paid and my hands busy while I sorted things out.&nbsp; I was also asked to leave subsidized student housing near campus, so I&#8217;d have to find another place to live.&nbsp; They would have let me stay through the end of the month, but I wanted to get out.&nbsp; Not sure why &#8211; I just did.&nbsp; 

I got really, really lucky.&nbsp; Unbelievably lucky.&nbsp; Right after telling my advisor of my decision, I decided to go for a walk.&nbsp; Instead of heading toward my apartment, I went the other way.&nbsp; Something compelled me to go that way &#8211; I don&#8217;t know what it was, but I couldn&#8217;t think of a reason not to go that way, so that way I went.&nbsp; And eventually, I came across a white building on a corner with a sign in the window that said, �HELP WANTED.�

It was in the window of a beauty salon called �Kim&#8217;s Circle.�&nbsp; The rest of the building was taken up by apartments.

I&#8217;d never been in a beauty salon before and Kim, or whoever ran the place, was probably looking for someone specifically trained to work in one.&nbsp; I was nervous about going in; what if someone saw me?&nbsp; What would they think?&nbsp; Did straight guys &#8211; even straight guys who were looking less masculine &#8211; work in beauty salons?&nbsp; But something in my head was telling me I should do this, that I was supposed to go in.&nbsp; Besides, I had nothing to lose.&nbsp; If they wanted a hairdresser, they would say so, and I would be on my way.&nbsp; If they wanted someone to sweep floors, I&#8217;d have a job.&nbsp; So I gulped and walked in.

The first thing I noticed was the smell &#8211; a mixture of the chemicals women use on their hair.&nbsp; There was a row of chairs facing a long mirror against one wall.&nbsp; A couple of women were having their hair done, but they were seated toward the back of the salon.&nbsp; A tall woman stood at the front counter.&nbsp; She had jet-black bobbed hair, and when she looked up, her dark brown eyes seemed to see right through the back of my head.&nbsp; She intimidated me.&nbsp; 

�Uh�.hello?� I said, stuttering a little.&nbsp; �I saw the &#8216;help wanted&#8217; sign out front�.I&#8217;m looking for work�.�&nbsp; The back of my throat was very dry, and the words were coming out in squeaks.&nbsp; ��I&#8217;m not a hairdresser or anything, but �.well�.I can lift things and stuff, push brooms�..that would...�&nbsp; 

She introduced herself as Kim. I felt frozen in place while she spoke, glued in place by some invisible force that almost seemed to come straight from her eyes.&nbsp; She expressed surprise that someone would be asking this soon &#8211; the sign had just gone up a few moments before I walked in &#8211; but for some reason I can&#8217;t explain, her face didn&#8217;t seem surprised at all.&nbsp; And it wasn&#8217;t just that she wasn&#8217;t surprised to see a man ask about working in a beauty salon.&nbsp; It was as though she knew I &#8211; not just some guy, but me &#8211; would be asking at that particular time.&nbsp; 

�We&#8217;re just looking for general labor at this point &#8211; someone to help clean up, keep inventory, maybe stay at the front desk while the rest of us are occupied.&nbsp; Keep the magazines stacked neatly.&nbsp; What&#8217;s your background?�

Whatever kept me immobilized suddenly snapped, and I blinked once or twice before responding.&nbsp; Her eyes seemed to soften a little as I relaxed and told her I&#8217;d been in school studying biology, but that I&#8217;d recently dropped out and was looking for something to keep me going.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t say anything about trying to make sense of my life, but her eyes seemed to whisper the truth to me &#8211; that I was adrift, and she knew it.&nbsp; 

The job paid minimum wage, but it came with basic benefits and, since I&#8217;d had been educated, I might be given extra pay if I could keep some of their computer work in line.&nbsp; 

She handed me an application form.&nbsp; I hesitated after filling out my name, when I got to the address lines.&nbsp; I looked up at her, but before I could tell her of my status, she asked, �Got a place to stay right now?�

I shook my head.

�Well, you know,� she said, her eyes drilling right into mine, �I also manage the apartment complex in this building.&nbsp; If you&#8217;re willing to help out with maintenance and cleaning around the complex, you could stay in one of the studios up on the top floor.&nbsp; It&#8217;s small, but you can&#8217;t beat the location.�

I stood still, unable to speak.&nbsp; I hoped my eyes were expressing the gratitude I felt.&nbsp; They must have, because she took the application form, filled out the address for me, and handed it back.

Once the form was finished, I handed it back to her.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t actually look at it, though.&nbsp; No one else had applied, she said, and she thought I&#8217;d be perfect for the job.&nbsp; I could start work the following Monday, but could move in to the new flat that afternoon.

 �Just a couple of things, though,� Kim said.&nbsp; �If you&#8217;re going to live at Silk-Trappe, we&#8217;re required to have you checked over by a doctor.&nbsp; A liability thing &#8211; the insurance people insist on it.�

I gasped.&nbsp; It had just occurred to me that, because I was no longer in school, I could no longer use the student health clinic on campus.&nbsp; �No problem,� Kim assured me, �there&#8217;s a doctor who works through our system who can see you at no cost.&nbsp; In fact, we&#8217;d prefer that you saw our doctor.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll arrange the appointment for you. How long before you can move in?�

�I can be back in a couple of hours,� I said.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t plan on keeping most of the stuff in my old apartment.

�Good.�&nbsp; Her smile was bright, but her eyes continued to radiate power.&nbsp; �Come on by when you&#8217;re ready, and I should have your exam scheduled by then.�

By mid-afternoon, I&#8217;d gotten the few belongings I&#8217;d decided to keep &#8211; some clothes, a couple of books, some cooking things &#8211; and moved over to Silk-Trappe.&nbsp; I told the student housing managers they could give the rest of my things to other students.&nbsp; Kim met me on the sidewalk and took me to my apartment on the top floor.&nbsp; It was a small efficiency &#8211; it had a single room with a bed, a simple kitchen set against one wall, and a clean bathroom.&nbsp; There was a TV on a wood stand in one corner. 

�Help yourself to whatever food is in the apartment.&nbsp; We keep some things for one of our employees here &#8211; clothes and such.&nbsp; She won&#8217;t be here for several weeks, but we have no other place to put them.&nbsp; I apologize if they get in the way; you can move them if you like.�&nbsp; The look she gave me when she said that was almost predatory, and it gave me a shiver for reasons I didn&#8217;t understand.&nbsp; �Come by the salon Monday morning at 8:00 sharp.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll set you up with a uniform, maybe clean you up a little.�&nbsp; She ran the fingers of one hand along my ponytail as she said that.&nbsp; �We&#8217;ll probably have some work around the apartment complex later this week as well, but I&#8217;ll give you a couple of days to settle in first.�

As she turned to leave, Kim held out a slip of paper.&nbsp; It said, �Dr. Allen, 2550 10th St., noon tomorrow.�&nbsp; That was only a couple of blocks away.&nbsp; 

Until then, I had little to do.&nbsp; It took very little time to unpack, so I looked through the apartment.&nbsp; The kitchen cabinet was stocked with bottles of fortified water, and there were cans of diet milkshake in the fridge.&nbsp;&nbsp; The closet held some blouses and pullover dresses, a couple of which had the name �Tina� embroidered on them.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t know who Tina was, but the clothes suggested someone approximately my height and weight.&nbsp; They were about the same size as the shirts I was hanging up next to them.&nbsp; The drawers attached to the base of the bed also had some of Tina&#8217;s clothes &#8211; panties, bras, some socks and stockings.&nbsp; My own belongings fit easily in the remaining space.

After unpacking, I grabbed a bottle of water and started flipping through the channels on the TV.&nbsp; I hadn&#8217;t watched much television in my former life as a grad student &#8211; odd how in less than 12 hours, I&#8217;d already thought of it as a �former life� &#8211; so I didn&#8217;t know what would be on.&nbsp; I settled on a channel that was showing nature programs and began to relax.

I don&#8217;t actually recall what I watched, but it must have kept my attention.&nbsp; Something snapped me back to attention, and I realized it was midnight.&nbsp; I turned off the TV, brushed my teeth, and hit the sack.

The next morning, I had breakfast &#8211; a diet shake, with my usual pills washed down with protein water &#8211; and took a shower.&nbsp; For some reason, I decided to shave my face, but not my body.&nbsp; While waiting to head out for the doctor, I turned the TV on.&nbsp; The same blank feeling came over me, and before I knew it, I felt slapped back to reality just in time to get dressed and head out to meet Dr. Allen.&nbsp; 

I opened the drawer to pull out some clothes.&nbsp; I pulled out a pair of briefs, but as I did so, my hands brushed against a pair of satin panties evidently belonging to Tina, whoever that was.&nbsp; They felt cool and smooth, and something inside me stirred.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not sure what it was &#8211; whether it was the simple feel of the fabric against my skin or the image, coming without warning from deep in my head, of me actually wearing them.&nbsp; I could almost hear a voice saying I should put them on, that I&#8217;d feel good wearing them, that they&#8217;d flatter my almost girlish figure.&nbsp; I found my right hand reaching for them, but I held it back and stared at it for a moment.&nbsp; Part of me was actually going to pick up the panties and put them on!

The thought of wearing panties wasn&#8217;t exactly disturbing, mind you - but I&#8217;d never even thought about wearing womens&#8217; clothes before.&nbsp; I&#8217;d heard that most transvestites are straight, and I had no problem with the concept of cross-dressing, but I&#8217;d never had any urges before.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what caused me to stand still, staring at my hand &#8211; the feeling that these panties would feel good against my still hairless thighs seemed to come from nowhere.&nbsp; It had simply never occurred to me before.

After a few moments, I decided that since the panties weren&#8217;t mine &#8211; they belonged to Tina &#8211; I should probably wear my briefs. 

I grabbed a shirt and pair of jeans from the closet.&nbsp; My eyes looked at one of the sun dresses left for Tina in the back of the closet, and a similar image sprang to mind &#8211; one in which I was actually wearing the bright yellow sleeveless dress, my smooth legs emerging gracefully from below the knee-length skirt, my hair let down and falling around my shoulders.&nbsp; I shook my head and stepped back, amazed with the ease at which this feminized image of me came into being.&nbsp; My face, hands, and legs were those of a woman, not of a man &#8211; and yet, they were mine.&nbsp; A voice seemed to whisper in my ear that this was right, that it was how things were supposed to be.&nbsp; And I actually liked it.&nbsp; I shook my head again, trying to shed myself of this surprising mental picture like a dog shakes water from its fur, and put my own clothes on.&nbsp; 

As I walked toward the doctor&#8217;s office, the changes of the past 24 hours coursed through my head.&nbsp; So did my recent sudden thoughts and urges &#8211; I&#8217;d never had anything like them before.&nbsp; 










The Long Embrace of Change

Part VII

We watched Chris walk along toward his doctor&#8217;s appointment from my new apartment window.&nbsp; My apartment was much larger than his, but was strategically located so that every time he walked up or down the stairs, he would pass my door.&nbsp; And very soon, we would meet.

�She still has no idea,� Kim said.&nbsp; I knew of the subtle messages Chris was starting to get, some subliminally through the television, others as barely-audible voices broadcast through small speakers throughout the apartment.&nbsp; She was being given suggestions to wear the womens&#8217; clothes we&#8217;d left there.&nbsp; We could see she wasn&#8217;t wearing a dress, and we suspected she hadn&#8217;t actually put on the panties, either &#8211; but the seeds of desire were nonetheless being sown.

Her gait was taking on a decidedly womanly manner.&nbsp; Her ass wiggled just a little as he walked &#8211; not enough to raise the attention of onlookers, but enough to suggest a feminine side if one looked for it.&nbsp; 










The Long Embrace of Change

Part VIII

The office of Emily Allen, MD, was empty when I arrived except for a pretty blonde receptionist behind a desk.&nbsp; I gave her my name, and she looked at a monitor screen in front of her, but she seemed to know who I was anyway.&nbsp; Perhaps mine was the only appointment that day?

�Ah, yes,� said the receptionist. She wore green scrubs and a name badge that said, �Leila Baxter, RN.�&nbsp; �You have a noon appointment.&nbsp; Come with me.�

First, she handed me a plastic jar and pointed toward the rest room.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t have to piss very much, but I was able to provide a sample anyway.&nbsp; She then took me back into an examination room, where she asked me to strip down to my underwear.&nbsp; After taking my weight, blood pressure, pulse and temperature, she had me sit on the paper-covered exam table.&nbsp; A plastic tourniquet was tied around my left bicep, and she inserted a needle into a vein to draw some blood.&nbsp; After taking the blood sample, she left.

I only had to wait a moment or two.&nbsp; Dr. Allen was a tall woman with graying chestnut hair that she&#8217;d put back in a bun.&nbsp; Her approach at first seemed very businesslike and detatched, but her face projected warmth and trust.&nbsp; Her dark eyes looked over the clipboard with the vital stats recorded by Nurse Baxter, then she looked up at me.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m having the nurse run some tests on the blood and urine samples you gave us.&nbsp; Routine stuff.�&nbsp; The first things Dr. Allen did were indeed routine &#8211; she listened to my back with a stethoscope and looked into my eyes, ears, and throat.�

�How are you feeling?� she asked.

I wanted to tell her about my recent concerns about my chest.&nbsp; Dr. Allen seemed to be someone I could really confide in.&nbsp; Still, I was reluctant.&nbsp; �OK, I guess.&nbsp; Tired.&nbsp; A lot&#8217;s been happening in my life.�

�I understand you&#8217;ve recently left school and accepted a new job?�

Kim must have filled her in before I arrived.&nbsp; I nodded.

Her hands felt around the lymph nodes of my neck and then around my chest and abdomen.&nbsp; 

I must have flinched when her hands probed around my pectoral region &#8211; I wasn&#8217;t ready to admit I had breasts.&nbsp; She looked up and asked, �Did I hurt you?�&nbsp; I shook my head.&nbsp; �Did I pull on one of your piercings?�&nbsp; Again, I shook my head.&nbsp; �Hmmm.&nbsp; Something you want to tell me?�

�Well�..�&nbsp; I took a deep breath, trying to collect my words.&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t know if something&#8217;s wrong or not.&nbsp; Over the past few weeks, my chest seems to have�.well�expanded.&nbsp; Just a little.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not really uncomfortable or anything, just�.I don&#8217;t know�.I&#8217;ve been working out and dieting, and taking vitamins, so maybe it&#8217;s just that�.�

Dr. Allen looked more closely at my chest.&nbsp; Her hands then moved around the margins of my breasts, giving each a soft squeeze.&nbsp; I exhaled when she did that &#8211; it actually felt good!

�I can&#8217;t feel any abnormal tissue in here.&nbsp; The vitamins and diet could be doing this.&nbsp; Are you comfortable with it?�

I thought that was an odd question.&nbsp; �Uh�.to be honest, yes.&nbsp; No pain or anything, though if I&#8217;ve been standing for a long time my chest tends to be a little sore.&nbsp; A little increased sensitivity, too &#8211; I&#8217;d figured that was from having my chest rub against my shirts.�

�Could be,� she said.&nbsp; She seemed to think for a moment.&nbsp; �As long as there&#8217;s no real discomfort, there&#8217;s no reason to do anything &#8211; though if you want your figure improved down the road, we could always do that.�&nbsp; That surprised me; usually, when people spoke of �improving� the figure of their chest, it was in the context of a woman having her breasts enlarged, not reduced.&nbsp; �But the soreness you&#8217;re feeling from standing can be taken care of fairly easily.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a matter of reducing the amount of weight being supported by your chest.&nbsp; Have you considered wearing a bra?�

My eyes popped wide open at that.&nbsp; �Wear a bra? I���&nbsp; I was speechless.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know what shocked me more &#8211; the suggestion, or the ease with which she made it, as though it was a perfectly normal thing for a guy to do.

 �We&#8217;re not talking about anything major here.&nbsp; Just a small bra &#8211; an A-cup.&nbsp; As long as you&#8217;re wearing normal clothes, no one would know.&nbsp; Believe me, it would help.�&nbsp; 

I was still unable to speak.&nbsp; 

�Look &#8211; it&#8217;s nothing to be embarrassed about!&nbsp; This happens to lots of men your age.&nbsp; Wearing a bra under your clothes doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re a homosexual or a pervert.&nbsp; It&#8217;s just a practical solution to a minor issue.&nbsp; Just give it a try.�

She continued her exam.&nbsp; �Take of your underwear, please.�&nbsp; I hesitated &#8211; I&#8217;d been seen by female doctors before, but never down there.&nbsp; �It&#8217;s nothing I haven&#8217;t seen before, Chris.&nbsp; Please pull them down.�&nbsp; 

Once my underpants were off, she had me scoot back on the table and to put my feet into hoops at the front on either side.&nbsp; Once in, she strapped my feet in and pulled each leg up and out.&nbsp; This left my genitals and ass completely exposed.

�Relax,� she said. �This is a necessary part of the exam.&nbsp; It won&#8217;t hurt.�

She felt around my genitals and tugged on my penis once or twice.&nbsp; �You keep this clean, don&#8217;t you?� she asked, flicking my PA ring with her finger once or twice.&nbsp; I nodded.&nbsp; �Good thing you&#8217;re already circumcised with that.�&nbsp; My cock began to get aroused.&nbsp; 

�I&#8217;m sorry, doctor,� I said, embarrassed at my lack of control, �it&#8217;s just that you�.�

�I know,� she said.&nbsp; �Again, nothing I haven&#8217;t seen lots of times before.&nbsp; Just relax.�

Dr. Allen walked over to a set of drawers against the wall.&nbsp; I could hear various implements being moved around.&nbsp; When she turned back, she held two objects &#8211; a pair of calipers and a hypodermic needle.&nbsp; She swabbed my right shoulder and, before I could say anything, injected me.

�What was that!?�&nbsp; I rose up a little on the table, which was awkward because my legs were strapped into the stirrups.&nbsp; No one had said anything about injections!

As I struggled to rear up on my elbows, Dr. Allen pulled a chain from under her lab coat.&nbsp; On it was a thin brass tube.&nbsp; Something about the tube seemed familiar, but I couldn&#8217;t actually recall having seen one before.

She put the tube to her lips and blew into it once.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know what happened; I didn&#8217;t hear anything, but I suddenly felt much calmer and relaxed my arms.&nbsp; �Just a booster.�&nbsp; I figured it must have been a vaccine booster for measles or something; last time I&#8217;d been given the normal vaccinations was early grade school.&nbsp; I immediately began to calm down.&nbsp; (In hindsight, I wonder if something in the shot helped relax me.)

With the calipers, she measured each of my testicles.&nbsp; 

She pulled a pair of rubber gloves on her hands.&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t really see what she was doing, but I felt her hand smearing something cool and slippery along the crack of my ass.&nbsp; One of her fingers slipped in my anus, causing me to gasp in surprise. 

I&#8217;d never had anything up my butt before.&nbsp; I&#8217;d never had a prostate exam or anything.&nbsp; So I was astonished to find that the experience wasn&#8217;t very unpleasant at all.&nbsp; 

Her finger probed my ass for a couple of minutes.&nbsp; She must have found my prostate, because my cock started getting very hard.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m sorry�..embarrassing��&nbsp; 

�It would only be a problem if that didn&#8217;t happen,� she said, nodding to my erection.&nbsp; Once my cock stopped growing, she measured it with the calipers.

To my shock, I was actually disappointed when her finger was withdrawn.&nbsp; She wiped my butt with some tissue.
Once again, she put her lips around one end of the brass tube.&nbsp; Things got a little fuzzy after that; next thing I knew, I was standing up and buttoning up my shirt.&nbsp; For some reason, I wasn&#8217;t concerned about my lack of memory over the past couple of minutes.

The nurse came in with a sheet of paper, which Dr. Allen read.&nbsp; �OK,� she said, looking up at me, �your urine and blood both came back clear.&nbsp; You&#8217;re physically fine.&nbsp; Keep up with the exercize and diet &#8211; it&#8217;s keeping you very healthy &#8211; and you&#8217;ll need to come in for another booster next month.&nbsp; And don&#8217;t forget what I told you.&nbsp; Your choice, but I really think it would help.�

I walked back to my apartment and sat on my bed.&nbsp; Wear a bra?&nbsp; Me?&nbsp; 

My feelings were muddled.&nbsp; On the one hand, I was a guy, and guys just didn&#8217;t wear bras.&nbsp; What would people think?&nbsp; But on the other, the doctor seemed positive it would help, and the soreness I sometimes felt at the end of a long day really was a drag.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s not like I&#8217;d be walking around in public just wearing a bra.&nbsp; 

As I thought this over, my earlier urge to put on a pair of panties came back to me.&nbsp; There was something erotic about the idea of wearing womens&#8217; underclothes, and that now included a bra.&nbsp; Even if I hadn&#8217;t been dealing with an expanding chest, I felt like the desire would have eventually come to me on its own anyway.

So I&#8217;d decided to give it a go when I realized another obstacle &#8211; the act of actually buying a bra.&nbsp; That&#8217;s something guys definitely did not do. We might buy sexy lingerie for our girlfriends, but not everyday bras.&nbsp; I wouldn&#8217;t even know where to begin.&nbsp; I&#8217;d have to ask the salespeople for something that would fit me.&nbsp; And I might as well be wearing the bra in public &#8211; people would see and draw the conclusion that I wore womens&#8217; clothing.

Then it occurred to me.&nbsp; Tina.

Whoever Tina was, the clothes in the closet suggested someone of roughly the same height and weight.&nbsp; And, Kim had told me, she would be gone for a long time.&nbsp; I could get them washed, and she&#8217;d never know.

I opened the drawer and pulled out a bra.&nbsp; Sure enough, it was an A cup &#8211; precisely what the doctor had recommended.&nbsp; I looked at the bra for a few minutes, playing with the back strap to make sure I knew how it fastened.&nbsp; I took a deep breath, pulled off my shirt, and put the bra on.

Getting the back of the bra to hook up was tricky, but I managed to get it done.&nbsp; I went to the bathroom, where there was a full-length mirror against one wall, and took a look.

I had to admit, it looked good.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not sure why &#8211; it just did.&nbsp; But something was missing.&nbsp; 

�Ah, what the heck,� I said.&nbsp; I removed my jeans and underwear, walked back to the drawer, and pulled out a pair of black satin panties.&nbsp; They slipped over my legs and settled around my crotch like a glove.

Looking at myself in the mirror, the image was stunning.&nbsp; I undid my ponytail and let my hair drape my shoulders.&nbsp; I was a man, but I wasn&#8217;t &#8211; my earrings, my hair, my smooth skin, and now Tina&#8217;s clothes, all together, gave the impression of an attractive, seductive person.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#8217;s hard to describe &#8211; not quite male, but also not quite female.&nbsp; Change the clothes and put the hair back, and I would be a man.&nbsp; Add some makeup, maybe do my nails, and I&#8217;d be a woman.&nbsp; 

I became aroused looking at my image.&nbsp; The bra and panties felt so good against my skin, and could already tell that the support the bra gave to my breasts &#8211; for some reason, I now felt better about calling them breasts &#8211; would make me more comfortable.&nbsp; My hand slipped beneath the panties waistband and felt around at my growing cock, stroked my scrotum.&nbsp; 

Before I knew it, I was masturbating with real enthusiasm.&nbsp; I exploded, jetting spurts of semen all over my hand and the panties.&nbsp; 

Once I was finished, I sat down on the toilet, caught my breath, and enjoyed the feeling for a moment.&nbsp; But then, I realized I&#8217;d just soiled Tina&#8217;s panties with my fluids.&nbsp; I pulled the panties off as fast as I could and ran water over them in the sink, hoping to wash it all off.&nbsp; Once I thought the stain was gone, I wrung them out and draped them over the towel bar.&nbsp; 

�I&#8217;ll have to wash those,� I thought, looking at them hanging limp.&nbsp; 

I didn&#8217;t know what was happening to me.&nbsp; Only a day after first feeling the compulsion to wear womens&#8217; clothes, I found myself actually putting some on, and found myself getting excited over the fact.&nbsp; I had no idea what this meant.&nbsp; But before I knew what I was doing, I saw that my jeans were being pulled over yet another pair of panties &#8211; white ones &#8211; that I&#8217;d pulled out of the drawer without even thinking about it.&nbsp; I shrugged, put on a shirt, and sat down.&nbsp; The panties and bra actually felt normal, as if I was supposed to be wearing them.&nbsp; I had a few days before the job started, so I turned on the TV and gave it my full attention.
