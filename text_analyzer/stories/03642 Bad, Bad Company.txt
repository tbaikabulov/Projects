Bad, Bad Company 
Dawn flutters and marches, the lone crucifix the sole focus for the black-winged
  birds and an army of ants, their appetites for fresh carrion unrelenting. The
  gender of the corpse mattered little to avian and insectival diners intent
  on merely satisfying their hunger cravings. Obvious tortures inflicted prior
  to the stillness of the feast also were of no consequence to the food chain
  participants. By mid-day, Nature would reveal glimpses of bleached white bones
  in the now desolate arena 
Some 3 Weeks Earlier� 
�She was found nearby with escort and a friend.� 
Tsunacius, leader of the marauding patrol, fingered the gold seal and serpentine
  clasp taken from the young woman's bicep and the royal ring removed from her
  forefinger. Holding the jewelry he keenly eyed the toned blonde. An enemy actually
  taller than he, the short leather tunic she wore doing little to disguise its
  owner's curves. 
He almost absently said to his sergeant, �And the others?� 
�Ambushed and shot by our archers. This one ran and then mightily fought our
  men until we overcame and brought her here.� 
�These,� he said holding up the bejeweled belongings, �show you to be a princess.
  What is your name?� She fought the ropes binding wrists behind her back. Greenish
  eyes regarded her captor and with a voice devoid of any courtesy said, �Cyyerha,
  princess of Mannurs�. 
Invaders had uncourageously killed her younger cousin, two of her best guards
  and trespassed on her territory. �As I suspected. Your people will soon know
  of your late return and send out parties in search.� 
To his subordinate Tsunacius said, �Make preparations to leave immediately.
  Take her with us. We can return later with greater forces�Oh, and make sure
  that our princess here,� a smile sneered his bearded face, �is comfortable
  for the journey back. Pack her well!� 
Bare knees pressed up against the leather bodice. The wooden walls barely
  held room for her. Sunlight extinguished with the closing of the lid, pressing
  her head further down. A pounding heart made the loudest noise as Cyyerha jostled
  for any purchase within the crate atop the cart. The land journey began. 
Heat from exertion and the boxy confinement quickly increased. Were it but
  for small cracks in the lid blackness would prevail. Scant air prevented suffocation.
  Teeth gnashed. Clearly in bad, bad company� 
Scant light from the cracks in the lid dimmed as one evening arrived. The
  air inside somewhat cooled. A sleepless night was spent in futile attempts
  to find any give in the walls. The motion of the crate stopped. Cyyerha sensed
  that her captors and she were stopped at camp. 
For the next several days the motion of waves rocked underneath. A cool salt
  air proved relief from the muggy stale air of before. The confines remained
  claustrophobic. A sense of direction no longer mattered. 
The rocking motion got heavier and the air cooler. Fatigue enveloped. All
  became dark and still. 
To be continued� 
Bad, Bad Company 
�Let's see what cargo we have here, � Tsunacius said as he and other men collected
  around the wooden box containing Cyyerha. Two of the men pried open the lid
  to reveal the unconscious woman inside. �See? She slumbers. Lift her out and
  revive the prisoner!� Hands reached in then lifted up and out of the crate
  their limp package. One of the soldiers fetched a bucket of water. He upended
  the contents onto the prostrate female who coughed and struggled to rise as
  the water splashed. 
�This one is strong, as well as comely. Get her a cell. Standard rations,
  but run her everyday. Also test her mettle during the gladiators' workouts.� Tsunacius
  turned away and smiled. Privately he said, �Entertainment value for the coming
  games now has a new twist.� 
Days of solitary confinement fueled by rancid portions mixed with running
  and training at the gladiator school ironically gave Cyyerha renewed energy.
  Iron bars of the cell at night steeled her resolve, and the daily diet alone
  was enough to make anyone wish to escape. From what she could see of the sun's
  position and the foreign-looking land, Mannursian search parties would never
  find her. If she was to escape alive, she would have to do it on her own. Each
  morning, before the day's heat and tribulations of the school, she would be
  run between the same two horse-mounted guards along a bridle path, the topography
  of which remained a mystery, 
The filthy leather toga flapped and muscles ripped as each morning's run brought
  more and more awareness of her new position. 
Seeing her chance on one early run caught the horse-riders off-guard. The
  one on the right was easiest. With a sudden twist, she cupped both hands under
  the nearest boot and lifted. Off balance, the enemy guard clattered off his
  saddle and the horse. As the other reached down to grab her in response, she
  pulled him forward by the wrist. Both riders thudded to the earth. Rapidly
  mounting the horse on her right, Cyyerha did not see the first guard who had
  clamored to his feet and now savagely gripped the bridle with one hand, drawn
  sword pointed at her in the other. 
�You will find that disobedience here does have its consequences,� Tsunacius
  said later. Cyyerha tried to clear her head following the blow. Chains locked
  her wrists to her ankles. The gloom reminded her of the cell atmosphere except
  that a caldron nearby glowed with fiery light. She flinched as fingers lifted
  up the short leather skirt, narrowed her scarlet silk undergarment. Goose-flesh
  pimpled her otherwise blemish free right buttock. 
�You had better bite down on this, for the sake of all of our ears.� Others
  joined his chortle. From a corner of one eye, Cyyerha saw a heated metal rod
  lift from out of the cauldron, biting harder on the wood between her teeth
  as she saw its glowing tip approach closer. 
Eyes waterering and heart racing, her body jerked as the heated metal touched.
  Cyyerha tried to gag. She endured the rod slowly trace a line from the top
  of her right hip downward. 
Knees buckled, but locked. Aside from the dull ache and throbbing sensation
  that traveled down her entire leg, she stood and hobbled as she was led back
  up and into daylight. 
Nagging pain from the burn and foiled escape kept Cyyerha off of her usual
  gladiatorial game. A pronounced limp persisted. For the most part, trainees
  used wooden swords, practiced tumbles in the sand, and generally followed shouted
  instructions. That afternoon, she was to wrestle two men: one an older prisoner
  with a flabby body and grayish beard; and the other, a younger native man. 
Cyyerha saw the younger as her most threatening opponent. 
She feigned a pronounced limp and general weakness. The younger lunged first.
  Slipping past his bulk, Cyyerha forgot her earlier burn and kicked up at the
  older opponent. Her sandaled foot caught his left knee, easily dropping him.
  Spinning, she grabbed the native boy and flung him into the crumbled old man.
  Picking up a wooden sword, she swung mightily, hitting his temple. He lay on
  the ground bleeding and unconscious. 
Others approached the whirling female with lustful curiosity. Her unwashed
  hair whipped around. Sweat drenched. Cyyerha threw down the sword, rolled and
  grabbed a nearby staff. The staff arched as the first newcomer came forward,
  wounding his thigh. Jumping on a cart, she gripped the rod harder and knocked
  a blade from another's hand. Leaping to the other side, Cyyerha lunged with
  the staff at one of the instructors, smacking him between the legs. Dirt sprayed
  as his feet came out from under him and he too fell, writhing as he clutched
  his groin, bellowing in pain. 
�It has become apparent that you are slow to learn,� said Tsunacius. The remoteness
  of his voice and the coolness of an underground darkness so disturbingly familiar
  again brought shivers. 
Realizing that once more she was bent forward and chained, Cyyerha fought
  the restraints as the fuzziness between her temples cleared. The same cauldron
  with its horrid glow flickered in the corner of an eye, although her bent position
  seemed new. 
�To make sure you do learn, this time you will get two brands. Two on the
  other side.� 
To be continued� 
Bad, Bad Company 
A feminine voice beckoned. �You are to come with me�� Eyelids parted. A pleasant-looking
  woman stood on the other side of the bars, the two guards flanking her offered
  the only apparent threat. Cyyerha stiffly got to her feet, shook off remnants
  of stale straw, and shuffled to where the other woman and guards waited. The
  cell door swung open, and she followed voluntarily. 
They entered a room in which Cyyerha never had been. Tall marble walls splashed
  across with multi-colored murals sweated, yet the room temperature was the
  pleasant. Caryatids near the ceiling separated opened windows. Scented air
  delicately filled the interior. Dominating the center of the large room was
  a sunken tub. Around it, three other women dressed in wraps around their tops
  and hips worked over heated water in a bath. Clean towels lay atop a padded
  table. The male guards left. 
The woman Cyyerha followed turned and began removing her dirty leathers. At
  first Cyyerha flinched, but then seeing that the woman meant no harm allowed
  her to continue. The other women came over to help, one unlacing straps on
  her calves and removing dirt encrusted sandals. The trio soon lifted off Cyyerha's
  silk undergarment. 
Tentatively, she tested the bath water with her toe. Smiling on either side,
  two of the women helped her down into the water. Cyyerha at last relaxed as
  the soapy water covered her up to her neck. Exotic scents wafted all around.
  She easily forgot about her plight, and even the still painful burns. 
Cyyerha lowered her guard this time. Oils and creams were gently massaged
  into her tired body. Razors so sharp and expertly wielded did their work without
  any nicks in places Cyyerha never before imagined. 
Her triangle of light-brown curly hairs floated away to reveal denuded lips.
  They looked pale, darkened only by the reddish slit separating the two. 
From the bath, she was led to the table. Face down, delicate fingers worked
  into her taut frame. Honey, avocado, and cucumber wafted forth. While others
  massaged her legs and back, another shampooed her hair. Still another manicured
  and then pedicured. Small hands rolled her onto her back. Cyyerha's opened
  eyes looked up to see the first woman, the one who awoke her in her cell. She
  also smiled, but not at Cyyerha's face. �You have lovely ones,� she said. Cyyerha
  lifted up her head and looked down her chin. The woman's pale hand drifted
  over Cyyerha's right breast, the tip of the stranger's nail lightly trailing
  around the enlarged pink aureole and then flicking the budding nipple. 
Cyyerha lay her head back, and closed her eyes again. All pleasures were to
  be savored however they were found. 
Oiled and perfumed, skin and hair dabbed dry, Cyyerha was taken off of the
  table. A full-length robe made of light, translucent beauty was draped on her.
  A slightly thicker belt, made of the same exotic material was cinched around
  her pinched waist. She was led to a wall where a shiny rectangle stood. A mirror.
  Cyyerha looked at her own reflection and saw that the weightless robe concealed
  little, yet somehow she was proud of what she saw. 
Golden curls framed a pretty face: sea-foam green eyes, slender nose, high
  cheekbones and voluptuous lips, all leading to a narrow chin and long neck.
  The sheerness of the gown also displayed breasts that were to be envied and
  more� 
Cyyerha was led to yet another room she had yet to see. Marble floors and
  walls here, as well. Yet, geometric patterns decorated this marble. Opulent
  rugs and other furnishings filled the room. 
�Welcome.� Cyyerha froze at the sound she recognized. Until this point, she
  had almost forgotten about all of the horrors. With just one spoken word, those
  dark memories flooded back. Tsunacius stood in one corner. A clean shave did
  little to lessen his evilness. She instinctively covered her arms over her
  chest. Tsunacius smirked and stood relaxed in a robe of shiny midnight-blue
  with silver trim. �You look wonderful, but must be famished. Unfortunately,
  certain precautions left us no choice but to remove all eating utensils. Feel
  free, though,� he said with a grand sweep of his hand, �to help yourself. It
  is all prepared for you.� 
Platters of meats and fishes simmered on a low table. Cyyerha slowly lowered
  herself to its level. Resting a hip on one of the rugs next to the table, Cyyerha
  suspiciously eyed the food, drink, and Tsunacius. She timidly tested a dish.
  Convinced of no trickery, she then rapidly began to devour the meal. 
Sated, she leaned her back against the sofa just as Tsunacius lifted her by
  her hand. �Now's hardly the time to rest. Plus, I have something else for you�� The
  base of her neck chilled as she felt the coldness of thin metal. Again peering
  down, she saw the necklace consisted of a large emerald pendant. �Turn around,
  I wish to see more of you,� he said. �And allow me to help part this robe of
  yours.� 
The candlelit marble geometric patterned walls, plush furnishings, sumptuous
  dinner, all swam before Cyyerha. Her mind clouded. One vision remained abundantly
  clear: Tsunacius stood before her opening up her gauzy robe. Fury vanquished
  all else. Cyyerha threw her knee at the grinning Tsunacius. At the same time
  swung her arm. Her nails scratched his cheek, Blood spurted. She pushed Tsunacius
  backward. He crashed, tumbling over the sofa. Grabbing a small end table, she
  threw it at him as he fell. Pieces of wood splintered over him and the floor.
  Powerful legs leaped over the upended furniture and stomped his melon belly.
  Her landing foot caused a great gasp. Tsunacius rolled on the floor away from
  Cyyerha. Four guards burst into the room, swords drawn and pointed at her.
  Her attack ceased. Panting, she saw that she was unarmed and out-numbered. 
Tsunacius groaned. Holding one side of his face with bloodied fingers, he
  rose. Regaining dignity remained he said, �I'll take those,� and ripped the
  emerald necklace from Cyyerha. �And the robe, as well.� She struggled at first,
  but he easily tore off the flimsy fabric. Cyyerha stood naked. She wore only
  the sandals she had been given. To the men he said, �This one attacked me!
  She deserves death on the cross tomorrow. But for now, take her away. Enjoy
  at your pleasure.� His slimy voice intoned and shiny robe rustled. �Oh, and
  torture this one tonight. Just enough�� Tsunacius leered and slapped Cyyerha,
  rocking her head from side to side. �I shall supervise��

Perspective from close to the center gave an improved sense of dimension.
  The arena was not massive. From the high wall circumventing the floor climbed
  tiers crowded with raucous spectators, maybe around three-hundred and shaded
  by a sort of circular awning. Clearly those in the stands were protected, and
  those on the arena floor exposed. 
Panting near exhaustion, Cyyerha eyed her surroundings. Resting on her knees
  actually provided relief. The beam on her back so heavy and awkward at first
  now seemed a part of her. Protest was out of the question as hands eased her
  and the attached wood to the ground. 
Shadowy shapes loomed partially blocking the slate-colored sky above. Cyyerha
  inhaled deeply. The sack scratched with the rise and fall of her wetness. Hair
  and head in sand mattered little � it simply felt good to lay back for a moment's
  rest. Half-way along her outstretched right arm ran the tattered weave. Hands
  from one of the shadows untied the rope around her wrist. The pale wrist and
  palm were turned upward. Horns and cheers in the distance blared. 
A dark shape swiftly arced overhead. Explosion shot the length of her arm,
  shattering an almost restful universe. Cyyerha's head jerked in the direction
  of the upturned wrist. Many other hands pressed her down as she fought to react. 
Another scream choked her throat with the second blow. She wanted to twist
  away, legs thrashed, the teeth smashing fire in her right arm begged for freedom
  and yet she was stuck. Cyyerha gulped for air. Instinct forced her to see what
  she already knew too well. A spike rose from her upturned wrist, its gnarled
  iron shaft pinning her to the wood. Tributaries of blood bubbled and flooded
  at its base. 
Earlier�
The escort of guards from Tsunacius's place made room between the collected
  others. Uniforms and armor rattled as bodies impatiently rustled. The original
  four securing his bedroom had swollen to at least twenty. Masculine noises
  murmured approvals at her entrance. Knives sliced through straps attached to
  her sandals. Cyyerha tried to stand calmly, nude and surrounded as she was. 
The spit and crackle of the fiery coals were unmistakable and yet the room
  had changed. The gloom had grown in size. More were present, too. Torches added
  flickering light that danced amongst rocky walls and threatening enemy. Smells
  of pitch mingled with sweat and worn uniforms. 
�Release her.� 
�Here�.allow me.� Tsunacius took the lead rope leading from one corner ceiling,
  fondled her left breast and then tied a noose snugly between its softness and
  the boniness of her ribs. He did the same with the other. �Now you may take
  the rope, and let us see just how mighty your really are.� 
Cyyerha gasped. Instinctively, she grabbed the angled ropes. She lifted. Only
  her toes touched the floor. She grappled more rope to lessen the massive pressure.
  Inching upwards, Cyyerha clutched for more. Her feet sought in vain any purchase
  with the floor. 
Legs kicked out, then merely hung. Knuckles whitened, muscles strained. Already
  pink aureolae disappeared into the clouding hue of ballooning surrounding tissue.
  Veins seemed to pop. Teeth clenched. Once admired facial features contorted.
  Sweat rained down from her hairline. 
�Pretty good,� he said. �so far�� She grunted in reply. Her audience grew
  more restless. Circulation virtually cut off, her chest turned an unhealthy
  shade. Nipples, once pink, now jutted as two black points. Flat seas of deep
  purple surrounded them. Reddish-purple balloons seemed to burst as they thrust
  upward. Cyyerha's sweaty face and neck roared with the effort. Biceps shook
  as they, too, seemed ready to explode. 
�However, let's see how you do with this�� Tsunacius swung the snaking leather
  whip. Cyyerha recoiled and cried out. Her tight-grip slipped. Thick coils already
  darkened by too much sweat, shook over her shoulders. A welt reddened across
  her stretched mid-section. Sweating hands desperately shifted for grip. Trickles
  of blood seeped from between clenched fingers. 
Another lash encircled her hips. The second strike caused Cyyerha to cry out,
  and again slip on what had become two lifelines. Her breasts pointed impossibly
  upward. Beads of moisture merged and coursed down curves and ridges forming
  sparkling rivers and streams. 
Tsunacius stepped behind the hanging figure. He aimed for the shiny vertebrae
  at the small of her back. The whip hit, and again Cyyerha's hands slid. This
  time, her head remained lowered, rocking from side to side, trying to shake
  away the inevitable and concentrate all energy to her supporting arms. Upper
  shoulder muscles vertically shifted beneath taut skin. 
They attracted Tsunacius's interest, but he aimed his next blow at the softer
  backs of her thighs. All present heard more of a yell than the previous cries.
  This time arms so courageous, conceded. Too heavily taxed, they draped helplessly
  alongside Cyyerha's burned hips. 
Tsunacius returned to face the limply hanging princess. Her face now downcast,
  shrouded by soaked hair, head barely moving. Large breasts pointed still higher,
  now uniformly black globes. Glistening crimson rose and fell over sweat. �Take
  her down. Over to the table�And let there be no doubt just who is to be first.� 
�Or is it �whom'..? I can never seem to remember.� 
Wrists manacled behind her and chained to the wooden legs below, Cyyerha's
  head hung over one end her bent neck dividing pinioned arms. Hips proffered
  themselves at the opposite end. Tsunacius parted the long thighs, grazed fingertips
  over the shaven lips, and then, plunged his erect cock into the slit, forging
  through the tight canal, rupturing Nature's barrier. Cyyerha spat screams,
  rattled in her bondage, and tried to fight away what was not to be denied. 
Tsunacius plunged deeper, raping Cyyerha of her virginity. He dipped the tip
  of an index finger in the spatter of blood issuing from between the thighs.
  Using the same finger, he swiped it across mumbling lips. With the same hand,
  he then patted the churning mid-riff, gazed briefly at mottled breasts gradually
  returning more to their natural color and said, �You have now been deflowered
  my princess.� Tsunacius glanced around at the men energetically crowding and
  said, �Just a taste of what is yet to come�� 
�Make sure she gets at least a few hours rest,� Tsunacius said mockingly as
  he left the chamber. �She'll need every bit tomorrow.� 
Grogginess brought on by shock eased. Detail gradually returned as Cyyerha
  hung from the cross. Gladiators resumed what they were doing before. Draped
  in animal pelts they scurried about in armed combat. Metal clanged. Cyyerha's
  head had never before ached or felt so heavy. On slightly raising her chin
  she saw Tsunacius cheering with others. Below soldiers used staffs to rip off
  what little she still wore. Cyyerha hung naked, clothed in little more than
  pain, concentrating on the simple act of breathing, in itself, so laborious.
  Any panic of being nailed to the cross became history. 
But Before� 
As their superior exited several worked without hesitation on Cyyerha's restrained
  head. A pipe end of a funnel was inserted between lips and into her mouth.
  One pinched her nose. Several began to masturbate into the wide round opening
  leading into her gullet. 
At the other end of the table, Cyyerha's long legs were elevated, calves held
  on the shoulders of the second in command. Despite advanced age most there
  approved of his muscled virility. His stout piston vigorously pumped into Cyyerha. 
One of the first with the funnel began to ejaculate. Sperm flew into the opening
  and down the shaft. Other white streams followed. Cyyerha made unintelligible
  noises of protest, attempting to free herself from the lodged pipe and its
  awful contents. The gargled protests went unheeded. 
Her throat slid up and down as Cyyerha was forced to swallow. 
Later Cyyerha was moved. Her position changed. She remained on the table,
  but no longer on her back. Sickened by previous tortures weakened. She offered
  little resistance and repeatedly taken from behind. Eventually, there no longer
  became any need for restraints. Cyyerha docilely allowed herself to be man-handled
  throughout the night.

Ringing the top of the arena wall ran a sculptured stone barrier builders
  designed for more than mere cosmetics. The barrier prevented wayward spectators
  from falling down from atop the wall. Three ruffians ran to a portion atop
  the wall they knew to be in disrepair. 
The shabby figure making a tortuous round of the arena floor hardly prompted
  the youthful haste. Instead, theirs was a project to further loosen stone atop
  the wall before the beam-bearing condemned arrived underneath. Keeping an eye
  on her approach, the teens feverishly kicked away at the barrier until a large
  section broke free. All hefted the piece just as their intended target passed
  below. Their swift actions proved timely. 
Tsunacius cursed the servants, the gods, his company � anyone in earshot.
  Obviously clear by their boos and cat-calls, the need for instant gratification
  for this crowd was boisterously announcing itself. The demand to see female
  flesh displayed overwhelmed all else. Who among them considered that his men
  were at this moment shredding away and that very soon their lustful appetite
  was to be fulfilled? But nooo, they demanded it now and not later. 
Swearing his toga kept tangling, Tsunacius frustratingly broke free. Standing
  and weaving around to placate the horde, he gestured for patience. The complaints
  continued. For a moment, Tsunacius doubted his own magisterial visage, wondered
  if the spectators did not obey because the muggy weather had made his makeup
  run showing the scratches on his cheek and the developing bruise, and somehow
  all this diminished his authority. 
Where the nearest retreat with the most dignity became more and more relevant
  as his further exhortations went ignored when suddenly, the boos changed to
  cheers. Tsunacius spun around. He could not fool even himself into thinking
  that the cheers were for him. Tsunacius steadied himself and looked back just
  in time to see the remaining remnants of Cyyerha's rags cut free. 
It was she and not he they were cheering! Crowd control concerned no longer.
  His jaw dropped. A stunned Tsunacius sat back down. 
Yes the darkening overcast blended the contours, contrast was nil. Sky or
  no sky, Tsunacius vividly recalled each and every curve. Only he perceived
  each valley, slope, ridge of her. All of the others could not possibly see
  what he saw. The nude below had succumbed to him. He was her first. Too bad
  the creature could not be saved�How lovely she had looked in his bedroom. How
  exquisite she felt. A pity all of that beauty must be so cruelly lost. And
  his men! Tsunacius knew well that those brutes knew nothing of tenderness.
  Signs of their relentless abuse proved that much. 
The jagged stone dropped and hit. Cyyerha fell forward, sprawling under the
  rough-cut beam, face half-buried in the sand. The defacto stone masons above
  scattered. Luckily for her, the rock had struck just slightly off its intended
  mark. The unfinished wood absorbed most of the blow. Two guards bent and lifted
  her up by the ends of the cross-beam. She spat out sand, tried to blink her
  eyes free of its grit. Bark smashed by the stone scattered around where the
  three struggled to reassemble. 
Cyyerha bent under the weight of the log despite aid in regaining her feet.
  Her arms remained extended out and behind the wood. The carpenter who prepared
  the beam planed only the side pressing against her neck and into her shoulders.
  The rest of the bark remained, except for where the falling stone had hit.
  The coarse garb she wore, fashioned of the same material usually used for hauling
  supplies, proved to be nothing more than a rectangle, a slash in the middle
  for her head. A short length of rope pinched her waist. Uneven sides flapped
  apart. Rounded profiles immodestly flashed. Tops of thighs began where rag
  ended. Helped to her feet, she resumed staggering the outer perimeter in and
  under strain. One of the guards mercilessly prodded with the swing of leather
  as with a common pack animal. 
Despite all, shouts for more filled the stadium. 
Fighting in the center resumed the clank of swords and armor barely heard
  above the crowd noise. The lone female, however, distracted most. Special delight
  reigned when she struggled just beneath a particular section in the stadium.
  Stains in browns and grays darkened the crude apparel. The unruly hair atop
  her head no longer held the color of sunlight. With arms and legs she fought
  for balance. Skin that did show flexed dully under the overcast skies. Stumbling
  and falling, she was helped by the men away from the wall toward the center
  of the arena where a longer timber lay. 
Soldiers untied arms and lifted off the cumbersome weight. Tufts of sand kicked
  out as bare knees and hands tried to brace the fall. A failed attempt. She
  sprawled on the ground. 
Cyyerha mentally challenged image of the encroaching cave. She was not prepared
  to be devoured by its perceived menace. The blinding pain as nails pierced
  her arms and feet and nailed her to the wood were distant memories. How long
  it had been, she did not know. All that mattered was not to be swallowed by
  the cavern's abyss. To live she would once more try to allow air into her lungs.
  To do so meant relying on already impossibly strained arms and legs. The pressure
  she knew. She must repeat the process. In order to sip life-giving air she
  must raise her body up. Muscles woodenly shook and ached in protest. The agony
  of shifting weight from her wrists to the nails in her feet was too unbearable
  to contemplate. Cyyerha screamed again. The abyss came closer. Its black interior
  beckoned. Cyyerha's body slumped. Her chin slumped to her chest. Limbs loosened
  their determination. Eyes closed in a weary invitation to eternity. 
A cool plop slid off the top of one breast. Another her head. More fell. Cyyerha
  stirred. Weary eyelids parted. Rain hit everywhere. The shower drenched the
  arena, her body and the bemused gladiators. Water! Renewed life infused Cyyerha.
  She needed drink. Tilting her head back, the rain wet her face, but the back
  of her head knocked against wood. The upright prevented rain from falling directly
  between her parched lips. Angling her neck to the side, the back of her head
  slid. Ignoring the smear of hair matted to her cheek Cyyerha gulped as the
  fresh rain poured in. 
The cross shuddered. Peering between glistening breasts and thighs, Cyyerha
  saw a fallen gladiator, his animal pelt soaked as she. He hit the cross's base,
  shaking the wood. His fall splashed sand and mud up her shins. Hygiene represented
  the least of her worries at present, but�she could not feel the coolness on
  her legs. They were numb. 
Feelings in her limbs or no feelings at all, the need to take another quick
  breath urgently made itself apparent. This time, Cyyerha gritted her moistened
  teeth, tightly clenched her jaw, and poised her leadened muscles to help her
  make the shift upward. Perhaps because of the renewed energy, Cyyerha wailed
  louder than before. She raised herself up and stayed up longer. She took three,
  not one, fast gasps for air before sliding back down. 
Refreshed, the threatening �cave� with its gaping maw now seemed smaller,
  and less inviting. Pleased, Cyyerha turned skyward and let the falling rain
  wash away much.
