Hannah Reynolds had worked for Tanaka since leaving university.&nbsp; Her combined honours degree in business and Japanese had served to start her on the career ladder with the large Japanese conglomerate.&nbsp; She had been interested in the East since she was a little girl, getting her first taste of oriental culture from television shows like Monkey or the Water Margin.&nbsp; Classic Japanese films like Godzilla had been very entertaining.&nbsp; You knew that it was a man in a suite stomping all over a model city, but she was prepared to believe the illusion for the sake of entertainment.&nbsp; Then, while at college she had discovered Manga and she had re-considered everything that she knew about the Japanese.&nbsp; She had joked that the most evil organisations on the planet seemed to be Japanese Multi Corporations.&nbsp; All of these had, by definition, a weapon&#8217;s or experimental science division.&nbsp; They would all have a dangerous experimental gizmo that they would leave around for their children to find and play with, or more usually, somebody else&#8217;s children.&nbsp; They would then cause havoc, ultimately destroying Tokyo.&nbsp; It was only then that the companies&#8217; large and suspiciously primed construction division would leap into action.&nbsp; Rebuilding Tokyo seemed to be a very profitable and popular national pastime in all Japanese fiction.

The reality was a little less dramatic.&nbsp; Yes the large Japanese companies had their fingers in many pies,&nbsp; but no experimental science divisions researching futuristic weaponry, no crazy card games possessed by Egyptian gods and monsters.&nbsp; In short, they were very ordinary in their approach to making money.

At 28 Hannah had been busily working her way up the career ladder and, despite being a Westerner, she had prospered and now, she was finally realising her dream of working at one of the company&#8217;s premier locations.&nbsp; Not the head offices on the mainland, but a state of the art production community on one of the Japanese islands.&nbsp; 

The mainland of Japan has several disadvantages for a company wishing to produce local goods, as well as exporting.&nbsp; Primarily cost.&nbsp; Land is incredibly expensive in Japan and so, while office space is needed for a company presence, actual production is another matter, since large factories take a lot of land.&nbsp; The problem then becomes one of how to invest in Japanese companies, with a Japanese work force, when the initial outlay is horrendously expensive.&nbsp; Setting up in Malaysia or China has its advantages, but does not help address the issue of hiring a mainly Japanese work force.

The solution, as far as Tanaka Corporation was concerned, was to use one of the local Pacific islands.&nbsp; In this way, a workforce could easily be re-located into a company town and then several factories would be built in order to produce goods for the mainland.&nbsp; In this way set up costs are lower, they could get a much larger facility for their money and still keep production and transportation costs low enough to ensure that they could make a nice profit.&nbsp; It was a model that had been used on three islands so far and, while Tanaka had used this model to build factories all over the world, it was the core islands that were the heart of the company&#8217;s&#8217; and Hannah would need one of these feathers in her cap if she was to progress any further up the corporate ladder.

Hannah felt that her feet had not touched the ground since she got here.&nbsp; Flying over the island she could clearly make out the volcanic origins of the island, so typical of such pacific paradises.&nbsp; But out of the jungle had risen all of the trappings of a super villain&#8217;s lair. Lab and production complexes on one side of the island with a main road connecting these various sites to the idyllic workers villages that had been built on the beach infested North of the island.&nbsp; All it needed was James Bond to turn up and blow the place to pieces or for Godzilla to stomp out of the jungle and start his long swim to Tokyo to complete the scene.

She had been given a nicely furnished apartment in one of the larger complexes, just over the hall from her assistant NoikeJurai.&nbsp; The apartment complex housed most of the people from her division, since the company philosophy believed that the workers should live and work together in order to build a stronger bond, like an extended family, as well as enabling Hannah to call on her assistant should she need to burn the midnight oil.&nbsp; The apartments were similar to self-catering holiday hotels that she had stayed in before and a short walk down the stairs from her first floor room led into a small courtyard that opened up into a communal grass area and gardens, like a small park.&nbsp; A path led down to the bars and shops, which were near to the company busses that shipped the workers to their various factories or offices.&nbsp; In keeping with all workers being the same, the managing director could be seen walking around the factory floor in the same company overalls as everyone else.&nbsp; An extension of this philosophy was that everybody had the same style apartments or family buildings.&nbsp; This meant that the furnishings were Japanese.&nbsp; Futons, tables to kneel at, with little to accommodate Western tastes. The rooms were of a good size.&nbsp; Simple bath room and shower, a single bedroom, lounge, large kitchen and a reasonably sized utility room.&nbsp; Not the largest apartment, but then reasonably laid out, with everything that she needed, including television, washing machine and built in cooker and hob.

Regardless, Hannah liked it and had become firm friends with Noike.&nbsp; They would often take the bus to work together, as well as sitting and relaxing in one another&#8217;s apartments.Noike was a stark contrast to her Western friend.&nbsp; She was small; barely over five feet tall, slim, with long black hair and soft oriental features that reminded Hannah of the doe eyed Japanese cartoon characters she has seen on television.&nbsp; All she needed was a mini skirted school girl outfit or sailor suit and she would be complete. 

One morning she decided to get to the office early, since she had a busy schedule to meet that day and the extra three quarters of an hour could save her a lot of rushing around.&nbsp; And so, leaving before her friend, she caught the earlier bus.&nbsp; However, unlike her usual bus, this took a slightly different route, visiting other industrial complexes on the island.&nbsp; Because of this not all of the people traveling on the bus were from her unit.&nbsp; One passenger in particular caught her attention.&nbsp; Not the passenger themselves, since they were in the usual company uniform of mouse grey cap, jacket and trousers, which she herself wore.&nbsp; It was his companion.&nbsp; A woman, perhaps in her early twenties, lay at his feet.&nbsp; Around her neck she wore a thick dog collar in tan leather, with diamante studs.&nbsp; The man held a lead casually in his hand, which was clipped to the collar.&nbsp; This would be strange enough were it not for the strange black and white spotted suite worn by the woman, which forced her legs to bend so that, in order to walk, she would have to crawl.&nbsp; Her feet could just be seen under the tight material, touching her ass, between which she could see a two foot, black and white spotted tail sticking out.&nbsp; The absurd costume continued up her body, apart from her breasts, which poked through holes in the strange material to stand proud and naked before her.&nbsp; The rest of the costume continued under the dog collar to a hood which covered her head, leaving her face open.&nbsp; On top of this was a pair of pointed ears.&nbsp; The final part of the strange costume was a shaped mask that left slanted, oriental eyes and lower jaw clear and was shaped to look like the face of a boxer, or mastiff.&nbsp; The overall effect was of a strange dog woman.&nbsp; Weird, kinky, but definitely erotic.

The dog woman returned the regard with casual indifference for some moments before returning her attention to her master with apparent adoration.&nbsp; Unlike everybody else on the bus, who actively chose to ignored the woman, as is the Japanese way, Hannah just stared openly at the couple.&nbsp; It was only after they had gotten off of the bus that she started to breathe again, so taken with the pair that she had been holding her breath.&nbsp; It took several minutes for her heart rate to return to normal.&nbsp; Hannah did not know what to make of the strange encounter, but it have left her with a head full of ideas and questions, disturbing images and a pair of very damp panties.

Hannah was distracted for the rest of the day and Noike picked up on this fact.&nbsp; However, she did not talk to her about it until the evening.&nbsp; It was only after they had both eaten in Noike&#8217;s apartment that Hannah explained what she had seen on the bus earlier in the day.

Noike regarded her friend for some minute before answering.

�As you know, Japan is a very complex society, with many rules.&nbsp; For years, women who travel on the underground have been felt up by male passengers, enduring the groping with silence, for to cry out and admit what was happening would bring shame on the woman, not the attacker.&nbsp; This is similar.&nbsp; A new craze has been sweeping Japan that allows our strict behavioural laws to be exploited and made fun of.&nbsp; People dress up and behave as animals and parade as pets, being led by their lovers or masters around in public.&nbsp; And just as nobody would publically call attention to a woman being groped by a stranger on a train, in order to save her honour, nobody would publically acknowledge the woman on the floor of the bus.&nbsp; This may be because of the Japanese social codes or perhaps that simply to name it and point out that there is a semi naked woman disgracing herself in public is to give it substance.&nbsp; To make it real.&nbsp; It is the elephant in the room, or in this case the puppy, that nobody will talk about.�

Hannah was not sure what to make of this.&nbsp; She could see why and how this would work and how these perverted freaks were using Japans social customs as a form of ridicule.&nbsp; A licence to perversion.&nbsp; It was a great deal to take in.&nbsp; Again the images started to invade her thoughts.&nbsp; She imagined herself on the floor, dressed in a dog suite, being paraded around town like an exotic animal.&nbsp; Shuddering Hannahstruggled to bring her thoughts back to the present.

Hannah spent the rest of the week traveling to work on the early bus, watching out for the couple and their strange pastime.&nbsp; Having arrived at work much earlier than her colleges Hannah made straight for her office, closing the door behind her and collapsing into her big office chair, she unbuttoned her uniform as quickly as possible to allow her hand access to her sopping pussy.&nbsp; This became her morning ritual, followed by a day of distraction.

This could not continue.&nbsp; Eventually her distraction led to mistakes.&nbsp; Costly and noticeable mistakes.&nbsp; And so, two months after encountering the strange couple on the bed, she found herself called into Mr Kosugi&#8217;s office where all of her mistakes and errors were laid out before her.

�I am at a loss to explain your behaviour.&nbsp; Your colleagues describe you as distracted.&nbsp; It is as though your head is somewhere else.&nbsp; I do not have to tell you what would happen to your career if we were to fire you?�

Mr Kosugi let her mull this over for a moment as he regarded the young woman before him.&nbsp; She had seemed so promising and they had invested a great deal of effort into her training.&nbsp; He would have to be careful if she were not to undo all of the hard work now.

�The Japanese believe that shame can be used to help an employee to understand their errors and eventually work to correct them.&nbsp; For that reason, if a Japanese employee needs to be brought into line and encouraged to improve their work, they are made into Window Workers.&nbsp; These are people that arrive at work every day, sitting at their usual work station.&nbsp; But unlike other workers, they do not have a role to play.&nbsp; They take no part in the workings of the company at all.&nbsp; Their colleagues all know this and so the shame and humiliation, which can last for days, months or even years, are enough to encourage greater effort when they are again given responsibility.&nbsp; Their colleagues welcome them back and do not mention the incident.&nbsp; Unfortunately, you are not Japanese and you would not feel the same level of humiliation that we would in such a position.&nbsp; Because of this and because of your Western origins Tanaka Corp have developed a Western equivalent of the Window Worker.&nbsp; So you have a choice.&nbsp; You can leave, without a reference or, if you wish to be given the opportunity to continue with our company and to regain our previous trust in you, you can become a thing of ridicule.&nbsp; So, what is it to be Miss Reynolds San? �

Hannah was shocked.&nbsp; She could leave Tenaka and throw away everything that she had worked so hard to achieve, or she can endure her punishment for as long as necessary and regain her position.&nbsp; In the end it was no real choice and she nodded her consent.

�Very well.&nbsp; Your assistant will take over your job while you are given a new, temporary position within the company.&nbsp; When you leave here report directly to the workers canteen.&nbsp; You will report there every day until you have proved your commitment to the company.�

Hannah shuffled out of the office in a daze.&nbsp; She was not sure what had just happened, but she could not go back now.&nbsp; It would mean the end of everything that she had worked for.&nbsp; She was sure that this was only a temporary break in her career.&nbsp; If she did this and proved herself she would be alright.&nbsp; She just needed to be strong and, like she had always done, just work through it.&nbsp; How bad could it be after all?&nbsp; She could work in the kitchens for as long as needed.&nbsp; She had done similar jobs as a student.

Hannah pulled up short as she realised that she had reached her destination.&nbsp; She had been so busy worrying that she had not noticed how she had gotten there.&nbsp; It was too late to worry now.&nbsp; The doors to the staff canteen were right in front of her.&nbsp; Reluctantly, she pushed the doors open and stepped inside.
To her surprise she found Noike waiting patiently for her.&nbsp; Distantly, Hannah heard the busy noises of cooking coming from the kitchen as she approached her friend.&nbsp; 

�Hello Noike.&nbsp; What are you doing here?�

�I am here to prepare you for your new role within the company.&nbsp; It is not going to be easy, but I asked that you should have a friend to help you, rather than some nameless person sent by HR�.

Hannah didn&#8217;t know what her friend was talking about, but it didn&#8217;t sound like she was going to be washing up for the next few months.&nbsp; She had been worried before, but now she was starting to get frightened.

Her fear must have been apparent, since Noike stepped forward and put her arm around her to comfort her, while leading her over toward the canteen exit.&nbsp; It was then that she noticed the new display.&nbsp; Rather than the usual product displays that sat next to the doors, a little diorama had been created, like a window display in a shop.&nbsp; A little raised dais had been placed in the display area, which had been covered with artificial grass.&nbsp; A background had been made using a display stand, that she had last seen used at a big semina.&nbsp; However, rather than the company images and promotions, the backdrop now depicted a suburban style garden.&nbsp; Fake plastic plants were also added to the scene.&nbsp; But the centre piece was a small wooden house, like a Wendy house.&nbsp; 

�What is this Noike?&nbsp; What&#8217;s happening?�

�What did Mr Kosugi say to you?� her friend countered.

Hannahconsidered for a moment.

�He said something about a Window Worker.&nbsp; I assumed that I would be working in the kitchen or something.�

�This is very difficult.&nbsp; In the West, you do not understand what shame is.&nbsp; If you were to be treated as Japanese you would not understand.&nbsp; You might even think it were a soft option.&nbsp; So Tanaka Corp have devised something very different for Western employees.&nbsp; It is not a soft option.&nbsp; It is going to be hard for you.&nbsp; But as your friend I will try to help you through it.�

�What?&nbsp; What will you help me with?&nbsp; What is so terrible,� Hannah asked, tears starting to well as her nerves began to get the better of her.

�Take off your clothes,� her friend whispered quietly&#8217;

�What?� Hannah asked, shock registering on her face.

�You must.&nbsp; If you do not do this you will leave the island forever.&nbsp; I will never see you again and your career will be in ruins.&nbsp; You will never find another job without a reference.&nbsp; Please, you must,� the girl pleaded.&nbsp; �Take off your clothes.�

Hannah stared at her friend, shock still registering on her now pale face.&nbsp; Almost on their own her hands slowly travelled up to the top button of her uniform jacked and started to unbutton the garment, while her friend looked on with a mixture of sadness and relief.

�What is this about?&nbsp; Why am I getting undressed?�

�It is not easy to explain.&nbsp; The management wish to humiliate you and if you want to save your career then you must do as I tell you,� the other woman stated.

Hannah had reached the bottom button and reluctantly shrugged off the garment, revealing her plain white bra, a horrible suspicion forming in her mind.

Folding the garment, she moved over to a nearby table and chairs and placed the jacket onto the table.&nbsp; Next she sat down and undid the laces of her trainers, which she slipped off and placed next to her as she regarded the strange house.&nbsp; She still had not seen the front of it and wondered why a shutter board wooden house with a pitch roof would be set up in the canteen.

Slipping her trousers off she also folded them neatly and placed them on top of the jacket.&nbsp; She was now dressed only in her underwear:&nbsp;&nbsp; Cotton panties, bra and socks.&nbsp; All the while she was being watched silently by her friend.

Noike studied her friend while she had been doing this.&nbsp; The company uniforms did nothing for her friend who, Noike knew, had an enviable figure.&nbsp; Her large double D breasts were emphasised by her slim, size 8 waste and flaring hips that created a neat, pear shaped rear.&nbsp; Her long legs adding an impression of grace and litheness and lending her a well-proportioned height of five foot seven.&nbsp; The thing that the oriental girl was most jealous of was the colour of her friends hair.&nbsp; A light natural copper tone, made up of golds, browns and reds to create a glorious crown of curls and light that no bottle could ever capture.&nbsp; Her pale skin looked even whiter in the stark artificial lights of the canteen, but a network of freckles patterned her body in contrasting light browns.&nbsp; But her real asset, was her green eyes.&nbsp; An eye colour that any oriental would kill to own.

�Everything,� Noike whispered.

She was not sure if her friend had heard, but she held the girls eyes and then, after an eternity where Noike was about to speak again, Hannah&#8217;s hands reached slowly behind her and undid her bra.&nbsp; Almost instantly the weight came off of the shoulder straps and the garment was pulled forward as the woman&#8217;s unsupported breast hung freely.&nbsp; Reaching up Hannah pulled her bra free and placed it on the growing pile of clothes asNoike marvelled at her friends cleavage and surprisingly large, erect, nipples.

Sitting down, Hannah removed her socks before standing, she slowly pulled down her panties, revealing a neatly trimmed thatch that confirmed her status as a natural redhead, and if her friend noticed and she prayed to god that she wouldn&#8217;t, her own damp excitement at the humiliation she was being forced to endure, before adding the last item to the pile of clothes on the table.

Any defiance or hope that Hannah might have had seemed to evaporate as she placed the last garment onto the pile.

Turning around she hung her head, refusing to meet her friends gaze as her long copper curls hung down over her face which, Hannah suspected, was fluorescing bright red with embarrassment.&nbsp; As if sensing her friends plight Noike walked softly over to the naked woman and, taking her hand, gently led her over to the strange wooden building.&nbsp; Kneeling down into the large arched entrance, Norika pulled out a bag, which she placed on the floor next to her friend who, having come around to the front of the building, now stared in horror at the large kennel with her name, or an approximation of it, �Hana,� written in Japanese characters above the door.&nbsp; Little blossoms styled around the writing confirmed the Japanese meaning of her name.&nbsp; 

As if to confirm her suspicion, the first item that her friend pulled from the bag was a large pink leather dog collar, with large metal studs spaced along the strap.&nbsp; Almost absently, Hannah noticed the small, bone shaped, metal disc at the front of the collar which, if she looked closely, she was certain would contain her name.&nbsp; 

Noike locked the collar around her friends neck, pulling the buckle tightly before feeding the strap underneath the metal loop that would secure it in place.&nbsp; As though this was a trigger, all of her fear, frustration and humiliation seamed to break like a dam as the degraded woman burst into great heaving sobs that came like staccato hiccups.

�You are nearly finished.&nbsp; You are strong.&nbsp; So strong.&nbsp; I know you can do this,� her friend encouraged as she led her friend onto the platform, gently forcing her down onto her knees and bending her forward until she was on all fours in front of the little house.

To say that Hannah was having second thoughts was an understatement.&nbsp; As her friend bent down to retrieve something else from the bag, she started to plan her escape.&nbsp; No job was worth this.&nbsp; All she needed to do was get up, dress and leave.&nbsp; She imagined herself doing just that, tasting it in her mind as she played through what she would say to her friend, as tears continued to come in quieter sobs.&nbsp; However, before she could put her plan into action, her friend was kneeling at her side, securing a strange leather strap to her elbow, which she then guided towards her knee.&nbsp; Another strap was joined into the middle of the first, so that Noike was able to fasten it around her leg, above the knee, in such a way as to join the two limbs together at the knees and elbows, forcing her to kneel forward on the stage.

She could leave now.&nbsp; All she needed to do was undo the first strap and then run over to the table.&nbsp; That&#8217;s all she needed to do.&nbsp; But rather than acting on her growing panic, Hannah stayed frozen in place, not resisting as Noike pulled her other elbow towards her other knee and strapped the limbs in place.

Hannah was still paralysed, numbed by the turn of events and how quickly she was being transformed.&nbsp; Only half an hour ago she had been a junior manager for a large multinational company.&nbsp; Now she was a degraded, humiliated thing.&nbsp; A parody of a dog that, she was sure would soon be displayed before her former colleagues.

Hannah&#8217;s attention returned to her friend and she felt her left hand being lifted.&nbsp; She watched in amazement as a large, paw shaped glove was forced onto her hand.&nbsp; It was as large as a boxing glove and secured by laces in the same way.&nbsp; It even balled her hand into a tight fist.&nbsp; But unlike the sporting glove, this was done in a light brown and shaped into a distinct paw shape.

This was too much.&nbsp; Hannah reached over with her free hand to undo the opposite elbow strap, but Norika quickly grabbed her hand and again, forced her hand into a similar glove with a speed and force that amazed her.

Now, as Norika finished the laces, Hannah realised that she could no longer escape.&nbsp; She was trapped.&nbsp; Although the leather straps were simple enough to undo, she could not possibly do so while wearing these large, ridiculous gloves.

Hannah&#8217;s&nbsp; shoulders visibly slumped as even the sobs died down and eventually stopped, leaving the young woman sniffing and panting as she accepted her situation.

Noike continued to prepare the company&#8217;s latest display, pulling a brush from the bag and separating her friends hair into two, distinct pig tail style loops which she fashioned, with the help of a couple of bands, into a style that looked remarkably like a set of floppy dog ears.

The next item from the bag was a small brown mask that, Hannah realised, was similar to the one she had seen the woman on the bus wearing.&nbsp; Although it covered her nose and top lip, it meant that she could still use her mouth.&nbsp; It had plastic jowls and a little black nose.&nbsp; Noike fed two straps behind Hannah&#8217;s head and under the ears that she had fashioned, before securing the mask tightly to her face.

Although Hannah could no more have left the platform under her own steam that she could run to the top of the Empire State building, Noike walked behind her, returning momentarily to clip the metal chain that was fastened to the front of the kennel onto her collar.

�One last thing and then you are ready,� Noike whispered into her ear as she disappeared behind the exposed woman in order to get some last thing from the kennel.&nbsp; 

Hannah did not know what her friend was doing behind her, but she soon found out as she felt something cold and hard, with a slimy coating of some sort, pushed against her anus.

Although a boyfriend had once fingered her there, she had never actually had anything violate her rear passage before.&nbsp; Before she could protest further her anal virginity was roughly taken from her as something long and hard was rammed forcefully into her ass.&nbsp; The shock and humiliation at her rough handling forced a loud and savage scream from her as the savage shaft came to rest and, having widened into a carrot shape, the thing tapered down into a smaller diameter that her abused rosebud closed tightly around.

�There, that&#8217;s the worst of it Hannah.&nbsp; I know this is a shock,� Noike soothed as she stroked the woman&#8217;s tear streaked face.&nbsp; �But it is only for a little while and I know you can do this.&nbsp; Besides,� Her friend crooned, �I do not think that you totally dislike this,� she whispered as her other hand followed the curve of her body, rounding her thigh before stealing stealthily onto her hot and wet sex, stroking and caressing, causing her friend to shudder, before blushing at her friends discovery.

Noike finished up by drying her friends face and re-applying her eye makeup, which had run in black streaks down her face.&nbsp; Her final act was to place two stainless steel bowls in front of her friend, filling one with water that she poured from a bottle kept in the bag.

�I have to leave now.&nbsp; I have to move into your old office and start work, but I will be back later to make sure that you get a break.�

With that the young woman kissed her older friend on the forehead, picked up the bag and walked out of the canteen doors.

Hannah watched the doors swing closed as she realised that she was finally alone.&nbsp; As though like a movie where time stops and then re-starts, she noticed the sounds from the kitchen returning.&nbsp; Perhaps, she wondered, they had never stopped.&nbsp; Craning her neck as best she could, she was not surprised to see a long, whippy tail sticking out of her ass.&nbsp; Experimentally she waggled her hips, watching in morbid fascination as the tail swung in a springy arc left and right, causing the bulb in her ass to rub slightly.

Time seemed to move slowly as she waited for the lunch break to start, and the factory and office workers would arrive, in different shifts, to get their meals, before heading back to work as every worker in the building filed through those doors, which she watched desperately hoping that they would never open, or that they would open soon and she could be done with it all and go home.

She imagined what she would look like to the workers as they stood with their trays or sat down.&nbsp; The naked red head with her ass in the air and her boobs hanging down, framed lewdly between her arms, a strange mask, collar and tail decorating her otherwise naked body.&nbsp; Despite her fear she started to become aroused by the image that she conjured up.

Occasionally a kitchen worker would come out and do something, placing hot food trays into the glass fronted counter, or re-stocking the another display. However, the activities of the kitchen staff, who occasionally glanced at her, lowering their eyes as she met their stairs, or trying to hide a smile as they went about their work.&nbsp; At last, the lunch alarm sounded and, as if time had sped up, the doors were opened by the mid-day rush as her friends and colleagues made their way towards the food counter, occasionally looking her direction, pointing and sniggering.

Hannah cringed inwardly as she watched the workforce begin to take their seats, turning their chairs to take in the free entertainment of their humiliated former co-worker.&nbsp; Groups started to get up and leave as they finished their meals, getting ready to return to work, eager to discuss her humiliation, no doubt.&nbsp; However, one worker walked over to her carrying his bowl.&nbsp; Bending down, he emptied his unfinished lunch into her dish before patting her on the head, telling her she was a good doggy and getting up and leaving.&nbsp; As if in response to this, Hannah realised how hungry she was as her stomach gave a loud, hollow sounding, growl.

Hannah might be humiliate and displayed, but she still had some pride and she refused to eat the growing pile of food that was scraped into her bowl.&nbsp; That is until Mr Kosugi walked over and emptied his scraps into the dish in front of her.

�Come on doggy, eat up,� he encouraged as he placed his hand on her head and forced it down towards the bowl.&nbsp; 

She did not even try to resist as her face at last made contact with the greasy noodles and bits of meat and vegetables.&nbsp; As if this was a final taboo that she was forced to concede, all resistance fled from the young woman as she began to eat the cooling scraps.&nbsp; At least the Japanese chopped up their food, making it easier to handle with chopsticks, or to eat from her current position.&nbsp; Freed of her last barrier, Hannah set about the food as though it was her last meal, stopping occasionally to slurp loudly from the water dish, accompanied by howls of laughter from the lunchtime crowd.

Finally it was over and Hannah was again alone, watching the canteen staff clean the tables and sweep the floor.&nbsp; Just as she had hoped, Noike walked in and strode over to her.

�How are you doing?� she asked.

�Hanging in.&nbsp; At least it&#8217;s over now.�

�Well, for a little while,� her friend stated.&nbsp; �There is still the afternoon break and I cannot come and get you until five.�

�So what are you doing here?&nbsp; Come to gloat?�

�No,� her friend replied.&nbsp; �I thought you could use a break.�

With that Noike bent down and undid the straps around Hannah&#8217;s elbows, freeing her arms but leaving the other strap secured to her leg.&nbsp; Hannah tried to stand up, but Noikes hand on her back stopped her as the other woman unclipped the chain on her collar and clipped a new, leather lead around her neck

�Mr Kosugi wishes for you to remain in character for the day.&nbsp; He also asked me to tell you that you are not allowed to talk.&nbsp; He said that he heard you saying thank you a few times as people gave you food.&nbsp; He wishes me to say that you should only bark or wag your tail when addressed by a worker.�

Hannah, stunned by this new degradation, nearly stopped as Noike led her to the toilets and the smaller woman tugged quickly on the lead to get her to continue.

She was led into the women&#8217;s toilets where, to her further humiliation, she saw a big tray full of kittee litter placed in one stalls, waiting for her.

�Hold on a moment,� Noike urged as she went behind the other woman, placed one hand on Hannah&#8217;s ass while the other one gently eased the butt plug out of her ass.

Walking over to one of the sinks, Noike quickly cleaned the bulb before placing it on the side of the basin and heading for the door.

�Bark when you are done,� the other woman called as she gave her former boss some privacy.

Hannah appreciated this small token as she crawled over to the box and squatted over it.&nbsp; At first, nothing would come, but eventually the damn that she had been holding in broke and steaming piss started to splash into the litter.

Strangely, she also needed to poo.&nbsp; She was not sure if she could, having had that thing in her ass all morning, but she could not spend the rest of the day trapped in the canteen with the discomfort that she would face if she didn&#8217;t go now and so, much to her disgust, she strained and forced a large poo into the box.

She tried her best to make sure that there was not poo clinging to her, since she could not wipe herself and satisfied that she had done all she could, she left the cubicle and barked at the closed door.

Almost immediately, Noike entered and, producing a wet wipe from a small packet in her pocket, much to the other woman&#8217;s continued humiliation, cleaned her private areas before disposing of the used wipe in the tray and retrieveiving the tail from the sink, produced a small tube of lubricant, that she coated the bulb with, before moving around behind the blushing woman who never the less, waited patiently on all fours for the inevitable intrusion.

�Ready?� Noike asked.

Hannah was about to answer yes, or at least give a glib comment when she stopped what she was about to say and re-considered.

�Woof.�

Hannah could have been mistaken but, as she looked over her shoulder she thought she saw her friend smile, before bending down and, much gentler than before, easing the plug slowly into her already stretched anus.

With a quick sucking sensation the tail re-seated itself and, clipping the lead back into place, Hannah crawled obediently back out into the canteen to be strapped and chained back into place, ready for the next break.

Hannah waited patiently for the arrival of the next crowd of people who, she remembered to woof, bark and wag her tail at, especially when Mr Kosugi or any of the other senior management was watching.&nbsp; Sometimes she forgot herself and thanked people for food or answered a question.

The wait for five seemed to take forever.&nbsp; Unlike the earlier times that she had waited, workers from the night shift started to arrive, using the vending machine to buy tea, and snacks before they had to start work.&nbsp; Again, she was the centre of attention, as the new arrivals joked and pointed.&nbsp; But Hannah was numb to this by now and dutifully woofed when required.

Eventually, about fifteen or twenty minutes past five, Noike returned with her clothes.&nbsp; As she gradually stood up, her aching back and knees protested and ached appallingly as Hannah tried to stretch and flex her knotted muscles, before getting dressed.&nbsp; Together, wordlessly, the two women left workand headed home.

Hannah did not fool herself that she would only have to do a single day of this humiliation.&nbsp; If she was expected back in the office they would not have given her work to her assistant.&nbsp; Even so, Hannah collapsed into her apartment, shutting the door like a safety barrier before staggering into her armchair.
Hannah did not know how long she sat there, going over the day&#8217;s events and wondering if she could actually do this.&nbsp; However, perhaps after an hour, when she was just thinking of crawling into bed, a gentle knock at the door sounded.&nbsp; She thought about ignoring it, but she didn&#8217;t.

She opened the door to find Noike standing there.&nbsp; The other woman didn&#8217;t say a word, simply raised her hand to show the leather collar and lead that she held in her hand.

�Oh come on.&nbsp; It&#8217;s just on company time.&nbsp; I&#8217;m done for the day.&nbsp; You can&#8217;t be serious, I mean don&#8217;t I have a bit of time to myself.&nbsp; Do I have to?&nbsp; Can&#8217;t I just have one night?&nbsp; Just one?�

But the other woman didn&#8217;t answer.&nbsp; She simply stood there, holding the lead up for Hannah to see.&nbsp; Hannah looked into Noikes eyes and, seeing the inevitability of her plight reflected back at her, she started to unbutton her clothes.

Naked, the defeated woman dropped onto all fours in front of her mistress and did nothing as the other woman placed the collar around her neck and pulled her out of her apartment on all fours, taking care to lock the door&nbsp; with Hannah&#8217;s keys before walking the company pet over to Noikes own apartment.















The Window Worker Part 2

bd, work, pet

Noikeled Hannah, or Hana as she now started to pronounce her friends name,by the lead into her apartment over the hall.&nbsp; Once inside Hannah was led over to thekitchen where Noike had some food prepared on the side.&nbsp; Hannah turned on the hob and quickly started to cook a rice dish on the hob.

�Why is this happening?&nbsp; I can understand about work, sort of, but usually even Window Workers must get to go home and carry on as normal.&nbsp; Why am I being treated like this?� Hannah enquired.

Noike continued to cook without turning around and Hannah was about to get up and walk away when her friend answered in a low murmur.

�In Japan the shame of being a Window Worker is felt at home, as well as at work.&nbsp; In order to experience this total degradation, Mr Kosugi believes that this should also be the case for Western Workers.&nbsp; Only in this way can you truly understand how shameful the loss of honour is to us.&nbsp; I want you to succeed and if I can convince Mr Kosugi that you have tried your hardest I am certain that you will impress him enough to shorten your punishment.�

As if coming out of a trance Noike finished the cooking and scooped the contents into two bowls.&nbsp; Rather than taking both bowls with her to the small table in the living room, Noike took one of the bowls to the utility room and laid it next to another dish, filled with water.

Hannah just stared in amazement as her friend returned to the counter, picked up her dish, a glass of water and a set of chopsticks before heading into the living area.&nbsp; Once her friend had left she crawled over to the utility room which, she noted, had been kitted out for an animal to stay.&nbsp; The bowls were obviously for human use, since they came from the same set as Noike had dished her food into.&nbsp; She noted, in the corner, by the washing machine, a large duvet had been bundled while, in the opposite corner, a large plastic tray, lined with paper and soil had been placed.&nbsp; Hannah did not need a degree to know what that was for.&nbsp; Resigned, she sat down and once the meal was cool enough, picked the food up with her fingers and started to place it in her mouth.&nbsp; It was then that she noticed the new shadow in the door.&nbsp; Noike had returned.

�If I am to convince Mr Kosugi that you are serious, you must make every effort to take up your new role, otherwise this could go on for months.&nbsp; You might even fail to convince the management team that you are committed and leave with nothing.&nbsp; In that case everything that you have done today will have merely been to degrade yourself further in everyone&#8217;s eyes.�

�I am naked and sitting on the cold floor of your kitchen.&nbsp; I have been paraded naked in front of everybody.&nbsp; What else does he want?� Hana burst out.

�You must embrace the role.&nbsp; Crawl on all fours, beg, and do doggy tricks.&nbsp; You must eat your meals off of the floor and sleep in a dog bed,� Noike continued.

�But it is just us.&nbsp; We are friends.&nbsp; Can you not just speak up for me and say how hard I have tried?�

Noike looked hurt, but continued.

�And if Mr Kosugiasks me, on my honour, if you have tried your hardest?&nbsp; What am I to say then?�

The two women shared a moment&#8217;s eye contact before Norika turned and walked back into the living room.&nbsp; Hana considered the other woman&#8217;s words for a minute before placing the bowl onto the floor and lowering her face into the food.

Once she had finished she turned to the bowl of water and tried, as she had earlier, to lap up the water with her tongue.&nbsp; Just like her time in the canteen, more water ended up on the floor than in her mouth, but Hannah was nothing if not persistent.&nbsp; Satisfied she crawled into the living room where she found her friend sitting on cushions watching television.

Hannah considered what to do next.&nbsp; What would a dog do she wondered?&nbsp; In the end she simply crawled over to the other woman and, kneeling in front of the other woman, placed her head in Noikes lap.&nbsp; Looking down, Hannahs former assistant began to stroke the naked womans curly hair, before looking back at the television, a slight smile spreading over her face.

At last the evening grew late.&nbsp; Neither woman has spoken.&nbsp; No words where necessary. Noike rose and walked into the kitchen beckoning Hannah to follow, which she did.&nbsp; All of this crawling was playing havoc with her knees, but Hannah hoped that she would not have to become too used to it.&nbsp; The small oriental woman stood holding the Utility room door open.&nbsp; Hannah obediently walked inside before curling up on the duvet.&nbsp; Satisfied Noike closed the door, plunging the small room into darkness before retiring herself.

Hannah spent a restless and uncomfortable night on the floor.&nbsp; She had needed the bathroom once and had struggled to remember where the tray was, but eventually found it, relieving herself and returning to bed.&nbsp; But other than this Hannah spent the night on the hard floor, trying her best to get comfortable on the thin duvet.

At last morning arrived and Noike opened the door.&nbsp; Hannah, despite her predicament, had gained some sleep.&nbsp; However, she was awake when the other woman entered and led her out.

�Why don&#8217;t you have a shower and get dressed.&nbsp; It seems to me that if you are going to work in clothes, you should at least have a bit of human comfort before work starts today.�

Hannah simply nodded at the small kindness and headed for the bathroom, taking time to shower and brush her teeth with, Hannah realised, her toothbrush.&nbsp; Noike must have got some of her things before releasing her from the utility room.

Because both women needed to arrive early in order to prepare for Hannah&#8217;s coming day, they took the early bus.&nbsp; As had happened previously, the woman in the dog suite was on the bus.&nbsp; Hannah stared at her with a new sense of understanding.&nbsp; They stared at each other for an eternity before Hannah turned away.&nbsp; She spoke little on the journey in.&nbsp; At last, after twenty minutes, the company bus stopped at their complex and both women headed for the canteen.

Unlike yesterday, Hannah quickly got undressed and, after a little shuffling, was soon kneeling on the platform.&nbsp; Noike quickly attacked the collar, chain, straps and gloves.&nbsp; Walking behind Hannah, the other woman picked up the tail and lubricated it with a tube of KY jelly.

�OK, you know what this is and what is going to happen.&nbsp; Are you ready?�

�Yes,� Hannah responded before the other woman placed the rubber plug onto her unresisting bud and gently forced the invader into her ass.

Hannah, or Hana as she would be for the rest of the day squirmed a little before looking over her shoulder at her new tail.&nbsp; Accepting that it was as she remembered it, she stayed still as Noike arranged her hair and added the dog mask.&nbsp; Finally two metal dishes were placed in front of her and taking a bottle of water from the refrigerator by the counter, topped up the water dish.&nbsp; With a final kiss on the head and words of encouragement the new junior production manager strode&nbsp; out of the double doors.

Noike had a bus day ahead of her, but she reported to Mr Kosugi and took part in a team Kaisan meeting.&nbsp; Returning to her office, she was careful to order some supplies from the island store, which she had delivered to her apartment, as well as ordering some supplies for the company and last minute items for Wednesdays mainland shipment.

As the day wore on, Hannah grew uncomfortable, crunched up onto her knees and elbows, her back was killing her.&nbsp; Noikes visit could not come too soon, especially since she needed to use the litter box.&nbsp; 

Lunch time came and went and again, after the ritual humiliation, where she was forced to eat scraps, Noike again arrived to give the woman a toilet break.

Once she had visited the toilet and was again back on her stage, chained to her dog house, Noike reached into her pocket and pulled something out before bending down.

�Although Mr Kosugi is impressed with the dedication and commitment that you have shown so far, he feels that you still have not accepted your role as an animal.�

�What are you talking about?&nbsp; I have been wagging my tail and lapping up scraps all day,� the other woman protested.

�And you have just made his point I fear,� Noike stated calmly.&nbsp; �Dogs do not talk.&nbsp; In order to encourage you, Mr Kosugi has asked me to give you this,� the girl stated as she produced a small plastic and wire device as she opened her hand.&nbsp; �It will help you to play your role.�

Hannah stared uncomprehendingly at the strange object.

�Open wide,� Noike asked as she moved towards the other woman.

Confused Hannah complied as the strange device was pushed into her mouth and, after some fiddling, fitted in place.&nbsp; It was a simple plastic band that pushed the tongue down and was held in place as the wire snapped tightly onto her molars.&nbsp; She could open her mouth.&nbsp; She could eat, but it felt tight and restrictive.
�Otizzish?Otamia u-osedoooo?�&nbsp; But she already had her answer as she found that she could not make intelligible sounds.

�Mr Kosugi feels that with this device you will not be tempted to talk.&nbsp; You should only make simple barks and yaps.�

Hannah stared mutely at the woman she thought was her friend, but was fast coming to believe was her controller.&nbsp; She dismissed the thought before it started to take route and simply watched as the other woman finished up and then left the canteen.

Time seemed to stretch forever as hundreds of staff filed in for their breaks, occasionally coming over to empty their bowls into hers, or to offer her a treat.&nbsp; She dutifully barked, whined and wagged her tail until; at last, Noike came to take her home.&nbsp; She dressed quickly and, even though the strange mouth piece had been removed, the two women returned to Noikes apartment in silence.

A large box, was waiting outside of Noikes apartment door as the two women walked back.&nbsp; Noike ushered Hannah into the apartment and asked her to get ready in the bathroom while she pulled the large box inside and shut the door.

Getting it into the living room was difficult, but not impossible.&nbsp; At last Noike was happy and, taking a knife from the kitchen, quickly unpacked the contents.

Hannah crawled into the room some minutes later to see the large, empty box in the centre and Noike waiting for her.&nbsp; Was that excitement she saw in the other woman?&nbsp;&nbsp; No, it couldn&#8217;t be.

�I have a present for you,� she said as she shooed the woman into the utility room.&nbsp; 

A new dog bed had been set up, as well as a large plastic litter tray, complete with absorbent grains.&nbsp; Three new ceramic dishes were also waiting for her.&nbsp; One was filled with water, but the other two were empty.&nbsp; These she presumed, were for food.
Hannah simply stared at the smaller woman, trying to decide if she was serious or not.&nbsp; However, after a moment, she decided not to argue and simply crawled over and tried out her new bed.&nbsp; She had to admit that it was quite comfortable.

Norike quickly changed out of the mouse grey work suite and, after a shower, quickly wrapped herself in a short Kimono before returning to begin cooking supper.

Noike busied herself in the kitchen, preparing something with fish.&nbsp; At last she poured the food into a couple of bowls before turning to one of the kitchen cupboards and taking out a bag of dry dog food.

�I am sorry.&nbsp; I tried to argue with Mr Kosugi, but he insisted,� Noike apologised as she poured the dry, brown pellets into one of the bowls.&nbsp; 

Hannah stared with distaste at her evening meal.&nbsp; She was even more revolted as Noike opened a tin of wet dog food and upended the tin into her other bowl.

�You have got to be fucking kidding,� she fumed.&nbsp; �I am not eating that muck.&nbsp; Who the hell does this prick think he is?&nbsp; Who the hell does he think I am?� she fumed.

�I see that, despite trying my best to help you, you choose to be difficult and ignore the advice I have given you.&nbsp;&nbsp; You do not make it easy for me,� she snapped bitterly.

With that Noike stormed out, returning some moments later and taking hold of Hannah&#8217;s jaw, deftly fitted the mouthpiece that she had produced earlier.&nbsp; Shocked, she simply stared after the small woman as she stormed out of the room, leaving Hannah agape at the sudden outburst.&nbsp; After an eternity, Hannah stared down at the sickening contents of her food bowl.&nbsp; Could she do this?&nbsp; Should she?&nbsp; Guilt rolled over her and slowly, trying her best not to smell or look at the food bowl, she lowered her head.

Hannah opened her mouth and nearly gagged.&nbsp; How could this happen to her?&nbsp; She did not know and she stopped thinking about it as she lowered her head further, all thought now focused on the thick chunks of meat and gravy.&nbsp; The smell was overpowering, opening her mouth made it worse, but she had to do it.&nbsp; Her friend was trying so hard and she had to do the same.&nbsp; It was either play this strange game to its outcome, or lose everything.&nbsp; With a final spurt of resolution, before she lost her nerve, she lowered her face into the mix and took a bite, her face puckering up into a grimace as she slowly chewed her food.&nbsp; Swallowing, she lowered her face again and took another bite, before she lost her nerve.&nbsp; After a couple of bites, she slurped some water before trying some of the dry.&nbsp; 

The dry food crunched noisily and although it had a vaguely meaty taste, Hannah found that she could eat this with less revulsion than the wet.&nbsp; Even so, she must show Mr bloody Kosugi and, more importantly, her friend, that she could do this and so, reluctantly, while trying her best not to be sick, she worked her way through the cold, wet, stuff.&nbsp; At last, she had eaten all of the wet and, as much of the dry as she could, before slurping down some water and making her way to the living room.

Noike was sitting by the table slowly eating her food as Hannah approached.&nbsp; On a whim, Hannah nuzzled the other woman with her nose before sitting back on her hind legs, assuming the classic begging position and letting out her best doggy whine.

Noike turned and smiled.

�Good girl.&nbsp; Did you enjoy that?&nbsp; Did you?&nbsp; Here, you want a treat?�

Noike used her chop sticks to find a piece of chicken which she tossed at the naked woman who, to the amazement of both, caught it in her mouth, before chewing and giving a loud �Woof�.

�Good girl,� Noike said as she patted Hannah on the head and firmly guided her down onto her lap so that she could stroke her pet while watching television.

Absently Noike stroked the body of her pet with her left hand, while resting her other hand upon Hannah&#8217;s head.&nbsp; As her hands continued to caress the naked woman an idea sprung into her mind.

�On the first day, when I prepared you, your body seemed to be enjoying itself.&nbsp; I wonder if, despite or because of everything that has happened, your body still craves the humiliation?�

As she talked her hand had moved down her friend body, over her ass and, with a little lean of her body, her hand snaked its way down towards Hannah&#8217;s most sensitive region.&nbsp; Hannah tensed, already knowing what the other woman would find as her hand travelled ever Southward and tried to sit up and pull away, but a strong hand moved from stroking her hair to firmly pinning her shoulders, commanding with gentle force, that she stay where she was.

Hannah bit her lip as she buried her head in her friends lap as she felt soft fingers tracing the crack in her ass downwards with a steady inevitability.&nbsp; When Noike&#8217;s fingers eventually found Hannah&#8217;s hot, wet sex, the nude woman let out the breath that she had been holding with a soft gasp.&nbsp; The gasps became shallow breathing that matched the gentle downward and upward movement of the soft warm fingers that rubbed up and down on her sopping pussy, teasing her clit into rigid attention as the gentlest touch found its mark, eliciting a soft panting sound from the face buried tightly in her friends lap.&nbsp; At last, she could resist no longer and the orgasm that had been building, if she admitted it, all day at last burst, like a flood of emotion and electricity, rocking her body in a mind shattering eruption that caused her to buck and scream violently, before sagging back into Noike warm embrace.

Hannah spent a comfortable evening in her utility room before being let out by Noike, given more dog food for breakfast which, strangely, Hannah ate without complaint, almost seeming to enjoy her food.&nbsp;&nbsp; Allowed to dress they both walked in silence for the bus.&nbsp; Hannah had no choice in this, as she still had the mouthpiece securing her tongue.&nbsp; Strangely, she had not taken it out of her mouth since Noike had forced it there yesterday evening.














The Window Worker Part 3
By

2012�

Noike sat in her office as her new assistant bought her the post, which she opened and quickly read through.&nbsp;&nbsp; She was jus
t about to return to her PC when her assistant bought in another item.&nbsp; A box.&nbsp; It was Wednesday and the supply ship had arrived from the mainland.
Hannah had spent an uncomfortable day naked in the canteen wearing her dog paraphernalia.&nbsp; But strangely, perhaps because of last night, or perhaps because of the girl on the bus, Hannah had enjoyed every humiliating minute of her day bound and tied to be mocked by her former work mates.&nbsp; She did not know if she could again look them in the eyes and manage them as she had before.&nbsp; Perhaps she could, but at this moment it was another world away.
The late shift had started to wonder into the canteen and she started to recognise familiar faces who had given her scraps or scratched her ear jokingly.&nbsp; It was getting late.&nbsp; Finally the shift bell sounded and shortly after Noike bustled into the canteen carrying a cardboard box.
Noike set the box down in front of Hannah before busily unstrapping her and removing her collar, chain and mask.&nbsp; Hannah looked at the box and Noike following her eyes answered the question that was obviously on her mind.
�It is a gift from Mr Kosugi.&nbsp; You are to wear this when you are not working.�
As Hannah stood and stretched, getting ready, or so she thought, to wear her uniform.&nbsp; She was surprised therefore, when Noike did not produce her mouse grey garments, but instead held up a corset, or more accurately, a waist cincher in a burnt orange colour.&nbsp; It was rear lacing, with steel front fastening and, she could make out that the foot tall garment was heavily layered with steel boning.&nbsp; 
Without elaborating further Noike quickly wrapped the garment around Hannah&#8217;s already thin waist before doing up the front fastening.&nbsp; Hannah was puzzled by this turn of events and a few days ago she might have questioned the woman&#8217;s actions, even with the tongue guard fitted.&nbsp; But now, after days of learning to obey and being treated to the view from the bottom of the pecking order, she allowed herself to be led over to the nearest table where Noike bid her grab the back of a chair with both hands.&nbsp; She then saw her friend disappear behind her.

Hannah felt gentle tugging behind her as the shorter woman began to tighten the laces, working from top to bottom and then bottom to top, before repeating the process.&nbsp; After a short time the tugging became more insistent.

�Grab the chair more firmly and bend over a little to give me some leverage.�

Hannah complied and, as the laces grew tighter, both women grunted until, standing on a chair and placing her knee in the small of the taller women&#8217;s back for leverage, Noike was eventually satisfied that the laces were as tight as possible, before tying them off in a double bow.&nbsp; A flap was then folded over the laces, sticking firmly to a Velcro strip on the other side of the laces, which had been pulled tight enough to cause Hannah to gasp and pant in short, staccato breaths, effectively hiding the tight chords from view and giving a seamless appearance to the restrictive fashion statement which straightened the woman&#8217;s back, crushing her figure into a tight hour glass figure, two sized smaller than her normal waist measurement.

�Sit down Hannah,� the smaller woman commanded.

Hannah complied and Noike returned to the box, pulling out a bundle of straps which she attached to the confused woman&#8217;s upper thighs above the knee.&nbsp; Bending her leg until her foot touched her ass. 

Taking the straps attached to her thighs she secured Hannahs legs and ankles until she could not unbend her leg.&nbsp; Noike quickly repeated the procedure so that Hannah could only lie with her legs bent or, if she chose, kneel in place.&nbsp; Hannah stayed where she had been left until Noike returned with a strange garment, made from short, red brown material, similar to her own copper tones.

Without ceremony Noike began to pull the garment on to the prone woman, rolling it up her knees, over her ass and along her body, pulling each arm through the long sleeves, before continuing up so that the built in hood stretched easily over her shoulders and fell in place around her neck.&nbsp; However, rather than pulling the hood over hear head, she left it loosely encircling her neck.&nbsp; Her new suite hugged her tightly and, Hannah realised, must be made from lycra, or a similar material.This was not the glossy lycra that Hannah remembered from gym class, but was covered in a short fur like outer layer.&nbsp; However, unlike many leotards that Hannah remembered from gym class, this costume had holes designed into it to allow for her ass and pussy to remain exposed and for her bare breasts to remain on lewdly displayed for all to see.&nbsp; Also, curiously, the calves were made of stronger material, with padding on the knees, which ended in a strange padded dog paw.

Noike took a pair of gloves, not as large as the boxing style glove she had worn all day, be that bunched her hand into a fist and was securely laced in place, none the less.&nbsp; Hannah was not sure if she wanted to laugh or cry at her continued captivity.&nbsp; Instead she sat there quietly while Noike continued with her transformation.

Next Noike quickly fitted an orange hewed dog mask, similar to the one she had worn all day, before pulling the hood over her head, hiding the straps of the mask so that it appeared that the mask was not attached but a part of the woman.

The hood of the garment also had holes in it.&nbsp; Since Hannah&#8217;s hair was already styled into floppy dog ears Noike simply pulled these through the holes above her own ears, enhancing the impression that she did, in fact, own a pair of floppy ears.

The next item out of the box was a tail, which to Hannah&#8217;s relief, was not pushed up her rear, but was in fact fed threw a hole in the garment and screwed into place in a small metal plate at the bottom of the corset.&nbsp; This gave the impression of a proper tail.&nbsp; Like the last tail she had sported it was flexible and bendy and, like everything else, matched the copper colour of the costume.

As Noike reached into the box for the final item, Noike issued a definite command.

�Sit.�

Hannah complied without thinking, adopting a kneeling position and straightening her arms so that her front paws rested on the ground before her.

�Good girl.&nbsp; Look what I have got for you.&nbsp; Aren&#8217;t you a good doggy?�

Hannah was not sure what to say to this, but she had given up trying to question anything her mistress said to her.&nbsp; That one thought brought her up short, as she had actually thought of Noike, not as her friend, or her assistant, or even her manager.&nbsp; She had thought of her as her mistress.&nbsp; Her owner.&nbsp; Then again she considered the butterflies in her stomach and the sensations coming from her damp pussy were more than enough to convince her that she was actually excited by the thought and, in response to the question, Hannah let out an excited �Arf,� while shuffling her butt in an attempt to wag her tail.

In response Noike produced a beautifully crafted deep green leather collar, with short steel spikes around the circumference and circular dog tag.&nbsp; Unlike the cheap, machine pressed, bone tag that she had worn so far, this was made from a machined silver metal, with her name �Hana� clearly written in a raised Japanese calligraphy.&nbsp; On the back of the licence where the words:

�Property of NoikeJorai,� followed by a telephone number.

A shiver ran down her body as, having shown her these details, Noike placed the collar around her pets neck and attached an equally beautifully crafted leather lead to the collar.

Placing Hannah&#8217;s work uniform into the box, she pushed the box into the back of the kennel before picking up the lead and tugging gently as she walked her pet out of the canteen.

Hannah tried to adjust to walking on her hands and knees, while Noike walked slowly enough for her to learn.&nbsp; However, Noike&#8217;s pet adjusted remarkably quickly and was soon able to crawl quickly after her oriental keeper.&nbsp; The stairs out of the building presented something of a challenge, but she managed these eventually, walking down in tentative, well considered steps, while staying close to Noikes heel.

Hannah sat patiently at the bus stop, waiting for the bus with her mistress. As she had expected, most of the passengers actively ignored her, although a few complemented Noike on her fine animal, asking her name and how long she had owned her.&nbsp; One or two even petted her on the head.

Hana, as she began to think of herself, sat obediently in the isle, next to her mistress, as the bus made its way back towards their apartment.&nbsp; However, Hana was surprised when, rather than the eighth stop, Noike tugged her lead and got up at the sixth.&nbsp; But Hannah was beyond questioning and simply followed as she was led off of the bus.

They were at the shops, a small collection of boutiques and essential stores.&nbsp; There was also, Hana discovered, a Vets.

Noike walked the nervous Hana with her up to the reception desk.

�Hello,� Noike said as she greeted the receptionist.&nbsp; �I am Miss Jurai.&nbsp; I have brought my bitch Hana for an appointment.&nbsp; I telephoned earlier.

After consulting her computer, the receptionist quickly checked the bookings before returning her attention to the young woman.

�Ah yes, Miss Juai San.&nbsp; Dr Kenda is expecting you.&nbsp; If you would take a seat in the waiting area he will see you shortly.� 

Pulling Hana with her, Noike took a seat and read a magazine while an increasingly nervous Hana sat at her feet.&nbsp; She did not know why but she began to whine while looking up at Noike.&nbsp; In response Noike simply patted her head and began to stroke her ear/hair absently as she read.&nbsp; 

Other pet owners were waiting, occasionally getting up and taking their pets with them.&nbsp; There were a collection of traditional pets but, across the room sitting just as quietly, watching her was a human dog.&nbsp; Judging by the large phallus sticking up from the floor where he sat, a very male dog who was very pleased to see her.&nbsp; 

Returning his gaze Hana look in the strong muscled form of the man underneath the brown and white spotted dog suite.&nbsp; He wore a black leather collar and looked oriental. In any event he gave a short bark and tried to tug at the lead, getting up to wag his tail and yap at her.&nbsp; This earned him a sharp slap on the head from his mistress.

�Down Butch.&nbsp; Sit,� the woman said as she pulled on the lead.

Butch sat reluctantly, but continued to keep a tight hold as he sat, waggling his bum and staring at her excitedly.&nbsp; Hana did not know whether to laugh or cry as she noted that his tongue was lolling out of his mouth and he was drooling on the floor.

Finally her name was called and she was led into the waiting room, where the doctor made a fuss of her before talking to Noike.&nbsp; 

�This is her first time isn&#8217;t it?&nbsp; You wanted the standard package?�

Noike nodded affirmation and so, with the help of a nurse, all three of them lifted Hana onto the table, still on all fours.&nbsp; Hana had become very nervous and had started to shake with fear as Noike tried to comfort her.&nbsp; Suddenly she felt a sharp prick at the base of her neck and a needle pushed into the flap of skin.&nbsp; She tried to pull away, crying out in pain, but Noike and the nurse both held her firmly while the doctor gave her two more injections.&nbsp; One in each arm, just below the shoulder.

�There you go, all done,� the doctor soothed as Hana was lifted up and place back on the floor.

Hana stood trembling.&nbsp; She was not sure what this was, but it had gone beyond the role of window worker.&nbsp; This was getting very serious and very weird.

�The three shots that I have given her come with the standard package.&nbsp; The first is an identification chip,� which he demonstrated when he ran a hand held reader over the back of her neck and Hana&#8217;s details appeared upon the small screen.&nbsp; �The second is a slow release anti-coagulant.&nbsp; This will thin the blood and prevent blood clots from forming, allowing you to keep her legs strapped up for long periods.&nbsp; I recommend that you undo the straps and massage the limbs once per day, perhaps giving her half an hour or so before rebinding her legs.&nbsp; The other implant is a slow release contraceptive.&nbsp; You should renew the blood thinner every three months, but the contraceptive will last for seven years.&nbsp; You will have to return in order to have It removed, should you wish to breed your pet.&nbsp; But other than that if you return in six months we can see how she is doing.&nbsp; But from my initial examination she looks healthy enough.�

With that Noike led a confused and concerned Hana out of the room, stopping to pay the receptionist before leaving the surgery.&nbsp; Walking to the corner shop, Noike tied Hana outside before heading indoors.&nbsp; 

Hana considered her options.&nbsp; She should just untie herself, find a quiet corner to bite through the gloves and get out of this costume.&nbsp; She could then go to her old apartment to change and pack and get on the first boat off of this island and get a new job, any job, back home.&nbsp; But she didn&#8217;t.&nbsp; She sat turning over her options and what this latest assault meant to her.&nbsp; Before she could decide anything Noike returned with a bag full of shopping and untied her lead.

They walked back through the park and, to Hana&#8217;s surprise, Noike bent down and unclipped her lead.

�There you are girl, go and run for a bit.&nbsp; You could save me an unpleasant job cleaning out your box as well if you want.�

Hana did not have to be asked twice as she crawled as fast as she could into onto the lush grass and Noike took advantage of a park bench to sit down and watch her.&nbsp; She could run, but Noike would quickly catch her.&nbsp; And then what?&nbsp; Hana didn&#8217;t know.&nbsp; She did know that she had not been to the toilet since she had been given a break in the mid afternoon and one thing that the corset did was to squish her insides very, very tightly.

Hana selected a piece of grass behind a tree that offered some measure of privacy before squatting down and releasing her bladder.&nbsp; 

�In for a penny, in for a pound,� thought the young woman as the flow of pee slowed to a stop and the fowl puddle was absorbed into the earth.

Looking around, to make sure she was not being observed, Hana moved to a fresh position before squatting again and straining.&nbsp; She was rewarded as a large turd began to ease out of her ass, coiling on the ground beneath her like a stinking snake.&nbsp; Hana crawled away and did her best to shake the loose shit from her ass.

�Good girl.&nbsp; Who&#8217;s a clever girl then?� Noike asked.

As if Noike had been waiting she appeared with a wet wipe that she used to clean the girls ass.&nbsp; She then pulled a small plastic bag from her purse, walked over to the tree and used it to pick up the pile that Hana had just left.&nbsp; Retuning she picked up the tissue wipe and put this in the bag, which she carried over to a bin by the path and disposed of.

Hana watched this for a few moments before turning and exploring a bit more of the park.&nbsp; After a while Hana heard Noike talking and ambled back to see her talking quietly to the woman who she had seen in the vet.&nbsp; Sure enough, close by and ambling towards her at an enthusiastic pace was Butch.&nbsp; Hana tried to turn away, but Butch had obviously been doing this for longer than her and easily caught up with her, cornering her by some bushes.&nbsp; 

Butch greeted her by licking her face enthusiastically, before moving around her and sniffing her ass.&nbsp; Hana was not too happy about this and so turned around so that Butch had to follow her around.&nbsp; He was nothing, if not persistent and soon the strange man dog had buried his nose in her pussy which, she noticed with dismay, was wet again.&nbsp; �God,� she though, �She was such a slut�.

As if to confirm this, with a loud snuffling noise, Butch pulled back, replacing his nose with his long tongue.&nbsp; Hana should have pulled away, or sat down, but instead, she was already dripping wet and so, her mind beginning to cloud, she stood there while Butch performed a very special kind of welcome with a very skilled tongue.

Hana&#8217;s body began to react and soon she was a quivering mess of hormones as an orgasm began to quickly build within her and her breath came in short, desperate pants as Butches tongue ran up and down her sex, teasing her clit with delicate flicks.

Noike&#8217;s pet was building towards an orgasm, pressure building within her as the humiliation of the public display, watched by both animal owners, brought her lust towards its climax.&nbsp; But, just as she neared release, Butch pulled back, much to Hana&#8217;s frustration, which she vented in a loud bark.

Accepting the invitation, Butch reared up and Hana felt his weight on her back, as strong arms wrapped around her waist and she felt his erect manhood, or rather doghood, poking into her rear.

A few weeks ago, a different Hannah, a professional business woman with designs to rise within the company, would have laughed at the idea of what was happening to her now.&nbsp; She might have run screaming and reported this man to the authorities.&nbsp; But this Hana, had changed.&nbsp; Although she wore a leash and spent most of her day tied in a ridiculous sexual parody of a dog, for all of her former employees&#8217; amusement, she was actually free to do what she wanted.&nbsp; She no longer had any embarrassment about her body.&nbsp; Being displayed for weeks on end will do that.&nbsp; She could take a dump in the park and nobody would bat an eye lid and now, she discovered, she could fuck a complete stranger, in the park, and nobody would stop her, arrest her or even notice her.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t even have to think about paying rent, or making ends meet, or anything that had occupied her mind for as long as she could remember.&nbsp; She could just be.&nbsp; And so, rather than resisting, or trying to pull away, as soon as Butch&#8217;s dick found it&#8217;s mark, Hana pushed backwards, allowing him to penetrate her with some force.

Unlike a human lover, or at least a considerate one, Butch didn&#8217;t have to make her feel anything, he simply took her.&nbsp; He took her hard and fast, his hips pumping and slapping her thighs with considerable force as his arms wrapped tightly around her.&nbsp; All too quickly, her orgasm burst over her, sending spasms through her entire body.&nbsp; As if he had been waiting, Bruno gave a low growl as his dick twitched inside her, closely followed by a feeling of a damp, sticky splat inside of her.&nbsp; Bruno continued to pump as Hana&#8217;s muscles clenched around his shaft, milking him for every ounce of seed.&nbsp; Finally spent, the lovers collapsed onto the grass as Hana tried to control her breathing and her mate spooned her in the open.&nbsp; At last, Butch got up and, walking around her, began to lap their mingled juices from her pussy.&nbsp; Hana bent her body and returned the favour, cleaning his dick until all of their cum was cleaned and her mouth tasted of recent sex.&nbsp; This, combined with his wonderful tongue, almost without warning, brought her to a second, shuddering climax, leaving her a panting, collapsed pile on the lawn.

All too soon she saw her mistress, walking with Butches owner, towards them.&nbsp; She was too spent to resist as her lead was clipped to her collar and she was led reluctantly away from her very smug looking lover.

She was such a slut.&nbsp; She had just had sex with a complete stranger, in front of everyone, in the park.&nbsp; She tried to be ashamed.&nbsp; She tried to beat herself with her old morals, but she could not.&nbsp; She really was free, she discovered, and she liked it.

The following weeks saw Hana settle into her new life.&nbsp; Noike became friends with Butches mistress and the two women visited each other&#8217;s apartments, following a run in the park after work, much to Hana and Butches mutual delight.&nbsp; 

Some weeks later, after a morning in the canteen where the novelty had finally worn off and the diners ate their lunch with only the occasional glance at their pet, Noike arrived to untie Hana.&nbsp; However, instead of taking her to the toilet, Noike led Hana to the staff changing rooms, where she was given her old uniform to put on.

�Mr Kosugi wishes to see you in his office Hannah San,� Noike said.

Hannah was taken aback.&nbsp; She had all but forgotten about Mr Kosugi.&nbsp; Also, Noike had used San when addressing her.&nbsp; Honourable is not a title you use on a pet and, she now realised, with some reluctance, Hana changed into her old, if freshly laundered, clothes.&nbsp; She brushed her hair and applied make up before making her way up to Mr Kosugi&#8217;s office.

Mr Kosugi greeted her warmly, inviting her into his office and offering her a seat.&nbsp; He then congratulated her on her efforts to embrace her role as a window worker, stating that she was a true credit to the company.

�Unfortunately, the economy has taken a turn for the worse.&nbsp; We had hoped that this was only a temporary glitch and we would be able to offer you a return to your old job.&nbsp; But things have not improved and we are left with many difficult choices.&nbsp; One of which regards trimming our work force.Unfortunately we have to make sacrifices and I regret that we can no longer hold your position open for you.&nbsp; Please accept our sincerest apologies in this matter, made all the more bitter from the epic efforts that you have made.&nbsp; If there were a way that you could remain on the island until a suitable position became available, we would do so, but we must re-allocate your apartment.&nbsp; Rest assured that you will receive a generous reference, with a small bonus to help you set up in your new job.&nbsp; I can only wish you luck in your future career and apologise for this regrettable turn of events.

Hannah shuffled out of the office in a daze even worse than the one which had clouded her thoughts the last time she had walked out of Mr Kosugi&#8217;s door.&nbsp; All of her hard work, the sacrifices that she had madeand the ridicule that she had suffered were a waste of time.&nbsp; She did not know what she would do and so, as if on autopilot, she caught the next bus back to her apartment and, almost immediately, took out her suitcases and began to pack as tears began to flow freely down her cheeks.

A knock at the door brought her out of her stupor and, looking sadly at her few possessions, she shuffled towards the door and opened it to find Noike.&nbsp; This was no surprise since, like most secrets in such a small community, if everybody did not know her fate now, they would before the end of the day.&nbsp; But what shocked her the most was what the young woman was holding up in front of her; Hana&#8217;s green dog collar and lead.

The two women stared at each other wordlessly as emotions and promises were exchanged as they held each other&#8217;s gaze.&nbsp; And then, as if compelled by an unseen force, Hanna&#8217;s hands reached up and unbuttoned her top.&nbsp; Once naked, she knelt on all fours and allowed Noike to place the collar around her neck and lead her from the apartment.

The following day, Noike travelled with her new pet to work, but instead of going to the kitchen, Noike led Hana to her old office, where a new dog bed, food, water dish and litter tray had been set up.&nbsp; Hana span in circles on her new bed before dropping down in a contented heap.&nbsp; Throughout the day Hana dutifully greeted people who arrived for meetings with her mistress, although she did growl at one worker who had been particularly mean to her when she had been a window worker.

The last meeting of the evening was with the senior managers and Hana waited patiently in her office while Noike headed off to the board room.

�So how are you getting on with your new pet Jurai San?� Mr Kosugi asked.

�Very well, she is everything that I could have hoped for and more.�

�Well you have earned it.&nbsp; The three percent rise in profits last year was the result of a great deal of inspiration and hard work.&nbsp; Tanaka Corp believes in rewarding its loyal employees.&nbsp; So�, Mr Kosugi continued, �When are you going to move back into your old office?&nbsp; It has a lot more space than the junior managers&#8217; room that you have at the moment?�

�Not too quickly, probably in the spring when I have to go to head office for the general meeting.&nbsp; After all, I do not want to raise Hana&#8217;s suspicion.&nbsp; My meteoric rise to power cannot be too meteoric.&nbsp; She still believes that I am only 23, rather than the same age as her and still quite junior in the company.�

Looking around the room, Hannah would have recognised a few of the senior managers from the company bulletin board, as well Butches owner and the owner of the girl on the bus.

�So, moving on,� Mr Kosugi urged, turning to another member of the team, �Mr Yamato San, following your outstanding efforts last year and your successful handling of the recent merger, the board has decided that you too should be rewarded.&nbsp; So, have to considered what sort of pet you would like?�

�I would like, with your approval of course Mr Kosugi San, a ponygirl,� the executive stated.&nbsp; �Preferably black, although a blond European would be my second choice.�

The senior managers considered this for several moments before MrKosugi spoke again.

�Very well Mr Yamato San.&nbsp; I will have Human Resources scour their files of our African and European employees for a suitable candidate.&nbsp; I must say that the psychometric testing that we insisted on for all employees has enabled us to pick willing recruits much quicker than we could have ever expected and I must say that if the current converts are a testament to their effectiveness, I am quite hopeful that we will quickly procure a suitable pony for you Mr Yamato San,� Mr Kosugi continued to the accompanying nods of the rest of the board.

The End.
