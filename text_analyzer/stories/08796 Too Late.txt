Synopsis: A young white couple are having trouble conceiving a baby.Little does the wife know, she has been setup for a date with a black guy while her husband is away.






&nbsp; Shannon was nervous. She could feel her stomach churning as she drove her car down the busy highway. She held a notepad in one hand as it rested on the steering wheel of her car. She kept watching for the address as she carefully switched lanes in the heavy rush hour traffic.

&nbsp; The numbers were getting closer. Shannon started to slow down as she searched for the address. Suddenly, she spotted the address. Ninety-three hundred. This is it! She turned her head and saw the apartment complex to the right. Finding the driveway she pulled straight in looking for the building number. 

&nbsp; There it was on the left. Shannon pulled her car around into the guest parking area and stopped the car turning off the engine. She took a deep breath and tilted her head up to look into the makeup mirror on the flip side of the visor. 

&nbsp; She looked fine. Shannon never wore heavy makeup. A little bit of lipstick. There! That will do! A light pink color. The color she normally wore. She sat still starring out the window at the apartment building she would soon walk out to.

&nbsp; Shannon thought of her husband, Tom. He was in Afghanistan. Deployed for the third time in two years. They talked whenever he could get a chance to call. He&#8217;d been gone a little over five months now and it was driving her crazy not having him around.

 During Tom&#8217;s last visit on leave, he introduced Shannon to another couple. He was a guy from Tom&#8217;s group serving in Afghanistan. Tom said they were swingers and belonged to this club. This all started several months ago when Shannon confessed to Tom that she felt horny most of the time. 

&nbsp; Especially at night when he wasn&#8217;t around. Tom said some of the guys he knew talked about their wives like they were sluts half the time. A few worried about them cheating with other men. Tom knew he&#8217;d never have to worry about his wife cheating. She was too nervous to even speak to other men let alone fuck one.

&nbsp; Tom never had plans to swing with this other couple. It just wasn&#8217;t his thing to fuck other women. Shannon felt lucky that Tom was that way. Tom did however have other ideas. This other couple was really nice. A bit older that Shannon and Tom. Millie was the wife. A hot redhead who liked to fuck other men. Shannon got very acquainted with Millie. They went shopping together, visited coffee shops and just hung out a lot at Millie&#8217;s house.

&nbsp; One afternoon Millie had something different planned for Shannon. Millie suggested they drive over to Star Bucks for a coffee like they did every once in a while. They sat having their drink when this black guy walked in smiling at Millie.

&nbsp; She stood up giving the handsome black guy a hug and a kiss and introduced him to Shannon. His name was William. He seemed like a very pleasant man. He was very talkative and made Shannon comfortable. He didn&#8217;t seem pushy, he was very polite and gushed all over Shannon as they talked. An hour flew by than another. 

&nbsp; Nothing was ever said about sex but before William left he invited Shannon over to his play for coffee saying he&#8217;d like to get to know her better. He politely stood up and gave Millie a kiss than shaking Shannon&#8217;s hand before he left.

&nbsp; Mille sat down as William walked out the door of the coffee shop. She was smiling at Shannon.

&nbsp; &#8220;What do you think doll?&#8221;

&nbsp; Shannon smiled. &#8220;He seems very nice.&#8221;

&nbsp; Millie reached out holding Shannon&#8217;s hand. &#8220;Listen doll. I&#8217;ve known William for over three years now. He&#8217;s a good stud and very dependable and clean. You won&#8217;t have to worry about no drama with him. None of that bullshit you find with these other low-life&#8217;s that&#8217;s for sure.&#8221;

&nbsp; Shannon looked confused as she said. &#8220;What do you mean. I don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;

&nbsp; Millie grabbed her hand a little tighter. &#8220;Listen doll. I told your husband I&#8217;d look out for you. Get you hooked up with the right guy.&#8221;

&nbsp; Shannon gasped. &#8220;You mean Tom knows about this?&#8221;

&nbsp; Mille laughed. &#8220;Yep. He also knows it&#8217;ll be a good experience for you while he&#8217;s gone. I told him I&#8217;d make sure you got laid by the best!&#8221;

&nbsp; Shannon sat in disbelief knowing that her husband must have shared these personal feelings with Millie. She pulled her hand away straightening up.
Shannon took a deep breath than said.

&nbsp; &#8220;Mille. Tom and I spoke about certain things but I never suggested anything of this nature.&#8221;

&nbsp; Millie was excited as she smiled and replied. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think Tom knows how you are? He told me you would even speak to another man when your by yourself. Listen doll. Everything is going to be fine.&#8221;

&nbsp; Shannon starred down at her coffee cup thinking as Millie continued her speech. 

&nbsp; &#8220;William&#8217;s a good guy. He&#8217;s not going to force you to do anything you don&#8217;t want to do.&#8221; She hesitated a moment than continued. &#8220;Listen. Just go and take him up on his offer. If things don&#8217;t work out you can always just leave. What do you have to loose?&#8221;

&nbsp; Shannon spoke with Millie several more times on the phone that week. Shannon asked all sorts of questions and Millie certainly gave her good advice. Mille even asked about birth control. Shannon assured her she was still taking the pill hoping Tom would call and say he was returning home earlier than expected.

&nbsp; Millie told her that was a plus. She told Shannon there was nothing like feeling a hard bare cock inside her pussy. She went onto explaining in more detail all the advantages about fucking William bareback. 

By the time Mille got down, Shannon was actually looking forward to the actual moment when William would pump his potent African seed into her womb. Shannon felt the excitement churning in her belly knowing that her womb would be carrying potent African seed fully capable of making her pregnant.

&nbsp; Her whole body tingled with that thought and wondered if it were a sick thought our perhaps other white women experience the same thoughts. She had to phone Mille and ask.

&nbsp; &#8220;Of coarse your not sick. Your going to love the feeling and excitement once this occurs. Trust me on this one doll.&#8221;

&nbsp; Well. Here she was parked in front of Williams apartment. She took one last deep breath and opened the car door. Shannon walked up to the door and knocked. Within seconds the door opened.

&nbsp; &#8220;Come in. I&#8217;ve been expecting you.&#8221;

&nbsp; William seemed very nice. He was very polite. We talked for almost an hour while I slowly sipped on a drink. His apartment was one of those studio apartments so we sat on the bed to be more comfortable while we spoke.

&nbsp; I don&#8217;t remember exactly how it happened but we were laying on the bed laughing and talking about our childhood when William started unbuttoning my blouse. 

&nbsp; Everything seemed to move quickly from that point. The next thing I knew we were kissing than William stood up and began taking off his clothes than sat on the bed wrapping his arms around me. 

&nbsp; I guess I was excited to have a look at his cock. I heard so much about black men being known for their size. I can assure you. I wasn&#8217;t disappointed when he took his cock out for the first time. I thought to myself. It&#8217;s now or never and just grabbed hold of his shaft and began stroking him.

&nbsp; I wasted no time leaning over putting the giant head in my mouth. William groaned and leaned his head back while I sucked on his cock. My mind thought about my husband for a moment as I moved my tongue across the head teasing the slit with the tip of my tongue.

&nbsp; William helped me take the rest of my clothes off and soon laid on top of me as we kissed and fondled one another. He kissed my neck making me laugh than moved his way down to my boobs than my belly. When his mouth touched my pussy for the first time I thought I was going to cum.

&nbsp; William sucked and licked my pussy until I was hot and wet than slowly moved up as I spread my legs for him. He moved into position and the head of his cock flirted with my pussy lips. 

&nbsp; It felt big as the head parting my pussy open. My body was tense but I was so wet he slid inside me with ease. It felt odd having such a thick cock inside me. I was so accustomed to my husband&#8217;s size. I felt more than full at the moment. 

&nbsp; William was kissing my neck, nibbling on my ear as he slid his cock slowly in and out of my wet pussy. I think I came within a couple minutes the first time. My whole body shook under William as he continued to fuck me.

&nbsp; I came again and William planted his lips on mine as he began hammering in me at a faster rate. I wrapped my legs around his ass while he drove deep inside my belly. I could feel the head of his cock hitting my cervix with each inward thrust. 

&nbsp; I cam again than a few seconds later William&#8217;s body started to tense up than I felt the first waive of hot cum filling my womb as William groaned in my ear.

&nbsp; I felt his cock flexing with each spurt wondering how much cum was being put inside me. I started thinking of my husband at that moment and the possibility that William was going to make me pregnant with his baby. A black baby.

&nbsp; William stood up catching his breath. He grabbed a bottle of water out of the frig handing it to me. I took a long swig of the water as I sat feeling his cum slowly leaking from my pussy. 

&nbsp; William leaned over giving me a kiss than helped me out of the bed. We took a shower together before he had to leave for work. It&#8217;s been eight weeks now and yes, I&#8217;m pregnant. I&#8217;m going to have a black baby. 

&nbsp; I&#8217;m going to break the news to my husband when he calls me tonight. I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;ll be happy and want to know all the details about William.

I wrote this story based on a video on my site. It's a true story and hope you like it.
