Synopsis: Jane's friend invited her to meet at a coffee shop to celebrate Jane's graduation.  The friend had a very unique way of celebrating, however.  And later, even the friend became surprised.Surprise! Surprise!  
Chapter 1: The Game Begins  
Jane Collins sat expectantly in the coffee shop. It was a beautiful, warm
  Spring morning and she had been half-tempted to take one of the outside tables
  on the sidewalk. But Emily had told her that she would meet her inside. So
  Jane sat inside and gazed at the park across the street.  
Deep inside, Jane knew that it would have been find if she had taken an outside
  table. But, out of respect, she sat inside and watched the lattes and cappuccinos
  and frappuccinos being made and served to the endless line of customers.  
Jane and Emily had been close for twenty years. Jane was now twenty four and
  was a bona fide adult, having gone through college and two years of graduate
  school. She completed her last exam only two days earlier and the only formality
  left was to collect her diploma.  
Emily Braxton was thirty four, ten years older than Jane almost to the day.
  They had first been introduced by Jane&rsquo;s parents when Emily had been
  hired to babysit a four-year old Jane. Since that first meeting of infant and
  teenager, they had grown close and had become fast friends. It was difficult
  to describe their friendship, however. It was something of an amalgamation
  of babysitter, older/younger sister, mother/daughter, close confidant and co-conspirator.  
Jane had wondered about meeting. Was this just a casual cup of coffee? Did
  Emily have plans for after the coffee? Frequently, they would go to a museum
  or for a ride in the country. Sometimes, Emily would take her to dinner, but
  this was far too early in the day for that. But it still had left her in a
  quandary about how to dress for the occasion. Should she dress up? No. That
  would make her appear expectant. Maybe something elegantly casual? No. That
  would also make it appear that she was anticipating something. And she was
  now a totally free, credentialed, and degreed young woman. She could wear whatever
  she liked and she wanted to create the appearance that she was not expecting
  her friend to set the agenda.  
She had settled on a navy blue top with khaki shorts and sandals. She thought
  that this would signal that she was simply meeting her friend for coffee with
  no expectations of imposing on her friend&rsquo;s generosity.  
She had debated about the bra. What would it signal if she wore one? How would
  it be interpreted if she didn&rsquo;t? She decided that she had obviously taken
  way too many psychology courses in college to even wonder about this. And she
  made the decision to let her 38D breasts just fend for themselves without the
  support of a bra.  
At exactly the designated time, Emily strode through the door and crossed
  the distance to the table, leaning down to give Jane a kiss on the cheek and
  a hug. &ldquo;How ya doin&rsquo;, pip?&rdquo;  
Jane blushed as she heard the twenty year old pet name that Emily had dubbed
  her with early on in their relationship. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m great, Em,&rdquo; she
  replied as she tried to hide her embarrassment.  
&ldquo;Glad to hear it. Let me get a coffee and I&rsquo;ll be right with you.&rdquo; With
  that, Emily dumped her purse on the table and headed off to the bar with her
  wallet. She returned a couple of minutes later with a steaming brew of something
  exotic and plopped herself into the chair beside Jane.  
&ldquo;I still can&rsquo;t get over how you have changed,&rdquo; she said
  as she reached for her purse and set it beneath the table. &ldquo;I think that
  the first time I saw you, you weren&rsquo;t much bigger than one of these.&rdquo; As
  she said &ldquo;these&rdquo; she reached out and playfully poked Jane&rsquo;s
  nearest breast, causing Jane to gasp and jump back.  
But you never moved quite like that when you were that size.&rdquo; She snickered
  as she saw the breast swaying and jiggling beneath Jane&rsquo;s top.  
&ldquo;Em!&rdquo; hissed Jane as quietly as she could. &ldquo;Please! I&rsquo;m
  not a kid any more!&rdquo;  
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say,&rdquo; laughed Emily. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re really packing
  these days.&rdquo;  
Again, Jane blushed and tried to hide her embarrassment by taking a sip of
  her coffee.  
&ldquo;Okay, okay, I&rsquo;ll behave. It&rsquo;s so good to see you. I just
  got carried away. Forgive me?&rdquo;  
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re forgiven,&rdquo; smiled Jane as she realized she was regaining
  control of the situation.  
&ldquo;Hugs?&rdquo; asked Emily as she stretched out her arms.  
&ldquo;Oh, okay,&rdquo; replied Jane sheepishly as she leaned toward Emily
  gave her a hug.  
&ldquo;Much better,&rdquo; said a contented Emily. &ldquo;So tell me what&rsquo;s
  up. I&rsquo;m dying to hear about all of your plans now that school&rsquo;s
  over.&rdquo;  
And Jane spent the next twenty minutes described all of the horrors of final
  exams and all of the possibilities that lay ahead of her. She babbled on nonstop
  until she had run through every career possibility under the sun.  
&lsquo;So no plans, huh?&rdquo; asked Emily when the monologue had finished.  
&ldquo;Well nothing definite,&rdquo; replied Jane, defensively. &ldquo;But
  I have a lot of opportunities.&rdquo;  
&ldquo;So where ya goin&rsquo; to work on Monday?&rdquo;  
&ldquo;Em!&rdquo; cried an exasperated Jane. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I get any
  time off at all?&rdquo;  
&ldquo;Yep, you do,&rdquo; smiled Emily. &ldquo;I was just kidding. You should
  have some time where you don&rsquo;t have to make any decisions. You should
  be free of any responsibilities. Lord knows you&rsquo;ve had enough decisions
  to worry about for the past few years. And I have just the answer for you.&rdquo;  
&quot;You do?&quot; replied Jane expectantly.  
&quot;You bet I do. And I have a present for you.&quot; With that, she reached
  down to her purse and started to rummage around. &quot;Just reach down here
  and get it.&quot;  
Without thinking, Jane quickly bent over and reached beneath the table, expecting
  Emily to place some concert tickets or maybe even plane tickets in her hands.
  Instead, she felt cold steel against her wrists andheard clicking sounds.  
&quot;What are you doing?&quot; cried a very surprised Jane.  
&quot;Hush, pip&quot; replied Emily quietly, &quot;unless you want everyone
  in the place to hear you.&quot;  
Jane quickly glanced around to see if anyone had noticed her embarrassing
  predicament. Thankfully, everyone was engaged in chatting with friends and
  sipping exotic coffee.  
&quot;What are you doing?&quot; she asked again, but in hushed tones this
  time.  
&quot;Helping you relax,&quot; smiled Emily.  
&quot;Relax?&quot; asked Jane,using a louder voice than was appropriate. Emily
  quickly reached out and placed her finger on Jane's lips to quiet her. &quot;Relax?&quot; said
  Jane in a whisper. &quot;How is this supposed to relax me?&quot;  
&quot;It frees you from decisions and responsibilities&quot; replied Emily. &quot;As
  long as you are wearing those, you don't have any worries. I'm forced to make
  all of the decisions for you.&quot;  
&quot;Is this some kind of a game?&quot; asked Jane as she furrowed her brow.  
&quot;Exactly,&quot; responded Emily as her finger stroked Jane's cheek lightly. &quot;Just
  think of it as a game.&quot;  
&quot;You can't be serious!&quot; hissed Jane as she started to get annoyed
  with her older friend. &quot;I don't think this is funny at all.&quot;  
&quot;Take a deep breath, girl,&quot; instructed Emily. &quot;Where's your
  sense of adventure? This should be lots of fun. In fact, let's get started.
  Time to go.&quot; With that, Emily arose and waited for Jane.  
&quot;I can't walk out of here like this. People will think I'm some sort
  of criminal or something,&quot; complained Jane.  
&quot;Oh sure you can,&quot; replied Emily. &quot;Just drape this scarf over
  your hands and nobody will know the difference.&quot;  
&quot;I don't know about this,&quot; said Jane warily as she tried to arrange
  the scarf to make herself as inconspicuous as possible.  
&quot;Don't be a ninny&quot; chided Emily. &quot;Come on, let's go.&quot; And
  she grabbed Jane's ponytail as she headed toward the door, urging Jane into
  motion.  
&quot;Okay, okay,&quot; said Jane as she jumped to her feet. &quot;I'll go
  along with the gag, but you have a lot of explaining to do.&quot;  
&quot;No problems,&quot; quipped Emily as she used the brunette ponytail as
  a handle to steer Jane toward the exit. &quot;There'll be plenty of time for
  explanations later. Plenty of time.&quot;  
Emily finally released her charge's hair but draped an arm across Jane's shoulders
  so that she could continue to guide the younger woman. &quot;These puppies
  can really move around!&quot; Emily said as she again playfully poked at one
  of Jane's untethered breasts.  
&quot;Hey!&quot; protested Jane, only to be pushed into the passenger seat
  of Emily's car. Emily got into the driver's seat and then reached across to
  buckle Jane's seatbelt. &quot;Now you're doubly locked up. And not a care in
  the world. Don't you feel better already?&quot;  
&quot;Not really&quot; muttered Jane.  
&quot;Spoil sport!&quot; With that, Emily started the car and drove across
  town. They exited the city and, within an hour, arrived at Emily's home.  
Chapter 2: The Game Annoys  
Emily had inherited the old farmhouse and the surrounding property a few years
  earlier when her father died. The land had not been farmed in many years and
  now was largely woodland. The long driveway was tree lined but eventually opened
  up into a well-manicured yard with the farmhouse and barn and a few other structures
  throughout the opening.  
After parking the car, Emily went around to the other side, unbuckled Jane,
  and then helped her out of the car. Again, she led her charge with her arm
  draped over Jane's shoulders to the front door. But before opening the door,
  she lifted the scarf that had been covering Jane's handcuffs. Then she rolled
  it into a band and held it up in front of Jane's eyes. It was obvious to Jane
  that her friend and her captor meant to blindfold her.  
&quot;Do you trust me?&quot; asked Emily.  
&quot;Not one bit,&quot; retorted Jane.  
Emily laughed. &quot;That's okay. You probably shouldn't. But at least I know
  you love me.&quot; With that, she tied the scarf around Jane's head, stealing
  all sight from her.  
&quot;Does it get better?&quot; asked Jane, sarcastically.  
&quot;Oh, it gets much better. You're going to love it.&quot;  
Emily opened the door and led Jane inside, keeping her arm around Jane's waist
  to steer her and avoid any collisions. Jane felt herself being turned this
  way and that but knew at all times where she was since she had been in the
  house so many times.  
&quot;Oh. You pulled up the carpet,&quot; said Jane as an effort to frustrate
  her captor. She figured that if she demonstrated that she was not being confused
  and that she knew what was going on around her, then Emily might grow tired
  of the game.  
&quot;Yep. Too many blood stains,&quot; Emily shot back,causing Jane to stop
  dead in her tracks. Emily laughed and gave Jane a swat on the bottom. &quot;Just
  kidding,&quot; she said. But it was still enough to melt away a little more
  of Jane's confidence.  
Emily drew Janeto a halt. &quot;I'm going to uncuff you first. Are you going
  to be a good girl?&quot;  
&quot;I'm always a good girl, Nanny Em&quot; replied Jane in a childish singsong
  voice, trying to mock Emily's question. &quot;You know I am.&quot;  
Emily laughed and patted Jane on the top of her head.&quot;Yes you are such
  a good girl.&quot;  
&quot;Jane felt Emily's fingers fumbling with one of the cuffs and breathed
  a sigh of relief when she felt it open. But before she could celebrate too
  much, she felt that arm being raised quickly and heard the ominous sound of
  the cuffs being clicked shut again.  
&quot;Oh my god! What do you think you are doing?&quot; exclaimed a surprised
  and frustrated Jane.  
&quot;I think I'm just doing you the favor that I promised. No decisions.
  No responsibilities.&quot;  
Jane was quickly growing tired of the game and started to pull at her binding.
  But she let out a loud &quot;Ouch&quot; when her efforts led to the metal cuffs
  digging into the tender flesh of her wrist. Emily had left one cuff attached
  to Jane's right wrist but had attached its mate toa steel ring embedded in
  the wall above her captive's head.  
Jane reached up with her newly freed hand and ripped off her blindfold to
  glare at Emily. &quot;You have a lot of explaining to do!&quot;  
&quot;I keep telling you, but you don't listen. I explain but you don't understand.&quot; Emily
  reached out to stroke Jane's cheek but Jane swatted away the hand. &quot;I
  already told you. I'm giving you a vacationfrom decisions and responsibilities.&quot;  
&quot;You call this a vacation?!?!&quot; shouted Jane, indignantly.  
&quot;Of course I do,&quot; smiled Emily. &quot;Would lashing both arms to
  the wall be better?&quot;  
Jane just shook her head in disbelief. &quot;No, that won't make it better.
  This is fine.&quot; Then she shook her head again as she realized what she
  had just said. This wasn't fine. This wasn'tfine at all.  
&quot;Okay. One hand free. The other hand bound,&quot; said Emily cheerfully. &quot;That
  will make it easier for you to get out of your clothes.&quot;  
&quot;What!?!?!?!&quot; shouted Jane again, her voice rising a few octaves
  this time.  
&quot;Slavegirls should be kept naked. Surely you knew that,&quot; replied
  Emily, feigning surprise at the question.  
&quot;I'm not a slavegirl. And I think you had better let me go now. This
  is getting too weird for me.&quot;  
&quot;Hmmm. Not a slavegirl. Maybe I missed something.&quot; Emily furrowed
  her brow as if in contemplation. &quot;Let's see. Slavegirls are girls. And
  you certainly qualify there.&quot; She reached out and quickly gave Jane's
  left breast a gentle poke.  
&quot;Stop that!&quot; admonished Jane.  
&quot;So the real question is 'are you a slave?'&quot; she went on. &quot;Well
  slaves are people who are owned by other people. And I claimed you today. So
  that makes you my property. Yep, you are my slave. So that makes you my slavegirl.&quot;  
&quot;Oh god I can't believe this is happening to me,&quot; groaned Jane.  
&quot;Oh, it's really happening to you, pip. And it's great for both of us.
  I get a new toy and you have no worries in the world. Now off with the clothes.&quot;  
&quot;Em, please be reasonable. Let me go and we can forget this ever happened.&quot;  
Emily ignored Jane's plea and, instead, went to a table, picking up what Jane
  immediately recognized as a whip. She smiled sweetly as she walked back to
  Jane and lifted the wip to caress Jane's cheek with the leather.  
&quot;You wouldn't dare,&quot; growled Jane.  
&quot;Oh wouldn't I?&quot; responded Emily in a sweet tone. Before Jane could
  react, the whip wistled through the air and cracked loudly on Jane's bottom.
  Thankfully, the shorts absorbed most of the impact, but it was still enough
  to elicit a howl out of the captive girl.  
&quot;That hurt!&quot; she cried out.  
&quot;It was supposed to hurt. Now start peeling before you get another one.&quot;  
Jane continued to glare defiantly at her captor. &quot;I won't!&quot; she
  proclaimed. This was immediately followed by another whistle and crack.  
&quot;Suit yourself,&quot; said Emily as she reached back to swing the whip
  again.  
&quot;Stop!&quot; shrieked Jane. &quot;Why are you doing this? What did I
  do to make you mad?&quot;  
&quot;Oh little one,&quot; said Emily who dropped the whip and rushed forward
  to hug Jane. &quot;You haven't made me mad at all. I love you.&quot;  
&quot;Then why are you hurting me?&quot; sniffled Jane, tearfully.  
&quot;Because you chose it, pip. You could have obeyed me but you chose pain
  instead.&quot;  
&quot;I didn't,&quot; Jane sobbed. &quot;I never wanted to be whipped.&quot;  
&quot;Then you should just take off your clothes like a good little girl.
  Okay?&quot; asked Emily as she stroked Jane's hair and tilted her head forward
  to kiss her forehead.  
&quot;Okay. But no more whips, okay?&quot;  
&quot;Well no more that are not deserved,&quot; replied Emily. With that weak
  reassurance, Jane struggled out of her clothes until only the shoulder strap
  of her shirt dangledfrom her cuffed arm. Emily solved that problem by cuffing
  the other wrist to the wall and releasing the original one, leaving Jane standing
  in all of her naked glory.  
&quot;Oh my, oh my, oh my,&quot; exclaimed Emily. &quot;Oh my how you have
  grown.&quot; She reached out and cupped a breast in her hand causing Jane to
  shrink away.  
&quot;Oh Em,&quot; whispered Jane. &quot;What's going on? Did you go lez or
  something?&quot;  
Emily laughed. &quot;No way. That would be too boring. I'm very diverse in
  my tastes. You might even consider my tastes eclectic.&quot;  
Chapter 3: The Game Turns Serious  
Jane was at a loss about what to do. A couple of hours ago, she was enjoying
  a carefree Spring day and waiting to meet her best friend in the world. Now
  she was a naked prisoner and was being groped by that same friend. She had
  to escape and get back to normalcy somehow. But how could she do it?  
She gritted her teeth and, in a quick motion, lashed out with her right leg
  and swing with her free arm to catch the unsuspecting Emily off guard and send
  her sprawling backward. Emily grunted as she hit the floor and then shook her
  head to clear it.  
&quot;That wasn't very nice,&quot; she said as she sat up and grasped her
  knees to gaze at her prey.  
&quot;Well stripping me and groping me wasn't very nice, either,&quot; shouted
  Jane. Jane's whole body was tensed for action but she was also trembling, which
  probably betrayed her fear.  
&quot;Ooooo,I love the way your breasts bounce when you do that,&quot; grinned
  Emily as she remained seated on the floor. &quot;Bend over and move your chest
  back and forth. I think they'll sway deliciously.&quot;  
&quot;Stop it!&quot; screamed Jane. &quot;Stop it, stop it, stop it! What
  do you want of me?&quot;  
&quot;Why, everything of course,&quot; replied Emily. &quot;I want everything.
  I want you completely and totally.&quot;  
&quot;I just don't understand,&quot; said a confused Jane.  
&quot;It's simple, really,&quot; Emily continued. &quot;For years, I have
  loved you. And recently, I have wanted to own a slave. And then if finally
  dawned on me that you would be a perfect slavegirl for me. So I captured you
  and claimed you. Of course, I wanted to wait until you were finished with school.
  Having an educated slave is much better than having an ignorant one. And I
  might add a slaveboy someday. Maybe even another slavegirl. But that can wait.&quot;  
&quot;You're crazy!&quot; Jane uttered as she shook her head in disbelief. &quot;This
  can't be happening to me.&quot;  
Emily remained silent but inwardly smiled as she watched the captive girl.
  And she congratulated herself on her catch. Jane was truly beautiful. She was
  taller than average at five feet ten inches, just an inch shorter than Emily.
  She had a beautiful almond-shaped face with aristocratic features. Beautiful
  green eyes were temporarily wet with tears, but Emily knew that would change
  soon enough.  
A slender but angular nose and a well-defined, strong chin gave her face definition.
  She had the elegant look of a model and, when her long slender neck was added
  to the mix, the look was elevated to that of royalty. &ldquo;My own personal
  slave princess,&rdquo; mused Emily.  
Jane&rsquo;s flesh was soft, supple and toned. Jane had always been active
  and reasonably athletic. She was sure that her prisoner had little fat and
  what body fat she did have was splendidly distributed and put to good use.
  Emily&rsquo;s earlier fondling had told her how amazingly soft and smooth and
  tender Jane was. A perfect specimen of femininity.  
Her skin still showed faint tan lines from time spent in the sun during the
  previous Summer. Emily remembered how beautifully Jane tanned and licked her
  lips as she pictured her slave tanned to a nice golden brown. &ldquo;No tan
  lines this Summer,&rdquo; she thought.  
Jane had many &ldquo;best features&rdquo; and certainly her breasts were near
  the top of that list. Full and firm and without a hint of sagging, they stood
  proudly on the naked woman&rsquo;s chest. Again, Emily found herself licking
  her lips as she eyed the mouthwatering nipples that capped the breasts. Each
  areola was slightly larger than a quarter and each nipple seemed to be perpetually
  erect. Emily wondered how sensitive the delectable nubs were and made a mental
  note to find out in the near future.  
From the chest down, Jane was a spectacular combination of curves as her body
  narrowed to a slender waist before flaring out to smallish, but still extremely
  feminine hips. Emily saw Jane&rsquo;s belly quivering nervously and saw how
  tight and fit the girl&rsquo;s musculature was. Moving downward, Emily saw
  the brown thatch of hair covering Jane&rsquo;s mound and noticed how neatly
  manicured it was. This was quite attractive to Emily and left her in a quandary.
  She had planned on shaving off that hair but now she wasn&rsquo;t so sure.  
The image was capped off by two long, slender, strong legs that tapered down
  to delicate ankles. &ldquo;Even her feet are beautiful,&rdquo; thought Emily
  as she eyed Jane&rsquo;s feet with their red, painted nails.  
So far, Emily&rsquo;s plan had worked perfectly. She had captured the beautiful
  prey and had spirited her to her home where she could enjoy the new toy in
  seclusion and privacy. The best part of this old farm was that it was relatively
  free from prying eyes. The closest neighbors were the Hopewells, a couple who
  had also escaped to the country from the big city, but they were at least a
  half mile away and rarely dropped by unannounced. But Emily&rsquo;s problem
  was that she had run out of plan. She had devised a scheme to capture Jane.
  Now, she needed to figure out what to do with her.  
She found the whole scene highly erotic and knew, without touching herself,
  that her sex was so wet that it could be considered swampy. Having a naked
  girl chained to the wall of your living room sent all sorts of sexual thrills
  through one&rsquo;s mind and she wondered if Jane also saw anything erotic
  in the image.  
But she found herself wondering why she found this so appealing. It wasn&rsquo;t
  as if she were a lesbian or anything like that. Sure, she had fooled around
  with some girls in high school and, later, in college. But it had all been
  kind of experimental and exploratory and light. Lips and laughs, she used to
  call it because those scenes had been mostly filled with kissing and giggling
  and a little bit of petting thrown in. The heaviest it had gotten was in college
  when she and another girl had sat naked on the bed together and masturbated
  each other to orgasm.  
She still enjoyed men. In fact, her current boyfriend was very good in bed.
  She decided that she definitely enjoyed heterosexual activities. &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; she
  thought, &ldquo;if I should share pip with Rob? That might make things interesting.
  I&rsquo;ll have to think about that.&rdquo;  
Emily gazed at Jane and saw her leaning back against the wall, looking defeated.
  Now she would be able to explore the softer side of sex a lot more. But where
  to start?  
Jane&rsquo;s tears had stopped flowing by this time. Emily got back to her
  feet and approached her girl causing Jane to tense again.  
&ldquo;Relax, little one. I&rsquo;m not going to hurt you,&rdquo; she said
  gently as she reached out and brushed a stray hair off of Jane&rsquo;s cheek. &ldquo;This
  will be a lot of fun and it will be exciting. You&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;  
&ldquo;But you kidnapped me, Em,&rdquo; she said softly. &ldquo;You could
  go to prison for that.&rdquo;  
&ldquo;Yes, I suppose I did,&rdquo; replied Emily. &ldquo;And I suppose I
  could. Well let&rsquo;s just see how it goes for awhile. If it doesn&rsquo;t
  work for both of us, I promise I&rsquo;ll release you and you will be free
  to send me to prison. But in the meantime, you&rsquo;re my slave.&rdquo;  
&ldquo;For how long?&rdquo; asked Jane, hopefully.  
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. We&rsquo;ll have to play it by ear. But we should
  know soon enough, I would think.&rdquo;  
&ldquo;A day? A week? How long?&rdquo;  
&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know, pip,&rdquo; replied Emily. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
  just have to trust me.&rdquo;  
Jane groaned. &ldquo;What will I have to do? What do you expect of me?&rdquo;  
Emily smiled. &ldquo;Everything. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to do everything
  that I tell you to do. That&rsquo;s what being a slave is all about.&rdquo;  
&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s included in everything?&rdquo;  
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see. Probably some chores. I think I might like having
  you bathe me and dress me and serve me. I like to be pampered. And I would
  imagine that sex will enter into it.&rdquo;  
Jane gasped. &ldquo;Sex with you? But I&rsquo;m not lesbian!&rdquo;  
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not either,&rdquo; smiled Emily, letting her fingers trace
  Jane&rsquo;s jawline. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve thought about what it must be like.
  And now we&rsquo;ll both get a chance to explore it. We&rsquo;ll call ourselves
  bi though. Not lesbian.&rdquo;  
&ldquo;And there may be sex with others,&rdquo; Emily continued. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
  be sure to sprinkle in enough men to keep us from thinking that we&rsquo;re
  lesbians. And there are endless other possibilities. I read a story once where
  a girl was treated as a pony. It might be fun to harness you and drive you
  around the farm.&rdquo;  
Jane hung her head as she listened to her friend and consciously resisted
  the urge to swat Emily&rsquo;s hand away from her face. She figured that she
  shouldn&rsquo;t do anything to anger her captor in case Emily had somehow become
  mentally imbalanced.  
&ldquo;And I think that you might be a decorative addition to parties that
  I throw. Maybe have you chained like this. Or bound kneeling in the middle
  of the room. Or even have you be a centerpiece on the dining room table. Oh,
  the possibilities are endless.&rdquo;  
&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t whip me again, will you?&rdquo;  
&ldquo;Only if you are bad,&rdquo; Emily replied. &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s
  not entirely true. I might do things to you that you don&rsquo;t like just
  to experiment or for special effects. But I promise you that nothing will be
  severe unless you are bad. Are you planning to be a bad girl?&rdquo;  
&ldquo;No, Em, I&rsquo;m not planning anything.&rdquo;  
Emily smiled brightly and kissed Jane&rsquo;s forehead again. &ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re
  getting into it. I knew you would eventually. You don&rsquo;t have to plan
  anything. That&rsquo;s my job. This should just be a wonderful and exciting
  vacation for you.&rdquo;  
By this time, it was early afternoon and Emily decided that it was a beautiful
  day for a walk. First, she shackled Jane&rsquo;s ankles together with another
  pair of handcuffs so Jane would not be able to try to escape. Then she released
  the cuff from the wall and resecured Jane&rsquo;s wrists, this time behind
  the girl&rsquo;s back. When Jane&rsquo;s wrists were cuffed again, Emily removed
  the shackles.  
&ldquo;Am I going to be handcuffed all the time?&rdquo;  
&ldquo;No, not all the time. Sometimes I might use chains or rope, although
  I have to get a lot better with knots if I&rsquo;m going to use rope. And maybe
  I&rsquo;ll buy a little cage for my little pet. Ooooooo and maybe some old
  fashioned stocks! That would make it easy to play with these.&rdquo; And she
  reached out to tweak the twin nipples to emphasize her point. Then, to quell
  her curiosity, she quickly darted her hand to between Jane&rsquo;s legs and
  slipped a finger into her, finding her just as wet as she imagined herself
  to be.  
Surprise! Surprise!  
Chapter 4: No Longer a Game  
By the third week, things had settled into a routine. Jane would generally
  awaken first. Since she was chained to the bed each night, she could not get
  up by herself. But if she had been given an assignment for the morning or had
  to use the bathroom, then she needed to wake up Emily in an appropriate way.  
She learned what was appropriate and what was not the hard way. Shaking Emily
  awake was clearly inappropriate. She learned this by being immediately spanked
  after using that method. Making noises was equally inappropriate. She spent
  most of a day lashed spread eagle between two poles in the yard for trying
  that. One morning, she found an alarm clock on the bed stand and set it to
  ring one minute later. That earned her a night on the floor, hog-tied and gagged.  
She kept experimenting but was starting to come to the conclusion that all
  acceptable methods involved her lips. She learned that kissing Emily awake
  was appropriate. Suckling her nipples was appropriate. And one morning when
  Emily had a pillow clutched to her chest and covering her face, Jane discovered
  that kissing her owner&rsquo;s sex was considered appropriate.  
Despite her earlier misgivings about lesbian sex, Jane discovered that it
  was not all that bad. And she discovered, much to her surprise, that she especially
  enjoyed it when Emily reciprocated. Having a feminine tongue urging her to
  orgasm was like nothing she had ever experienced.  
After Jane negotiated her way from bed each morning, her ankles were hobbled
  and her wrists were, in some way, cuffed to prevent her escape. She then spent
  the morning cooking, cleaning and serving for her mistress.  
The early afternoons generally found her outside tending the gardens or otherwise
  landscaping. Emily told her that this was the best way for her to get the all-over
  toasted tan look that Emily was looking for. Other than a few metal bands and
  chains, there was nothing to hide her flesh from the sun.  
And then, late in the afternoon, Emily would take her for a run. She said
  that she wanted her slavegirl to remain fit and to be the envy of all other
  slaves and owners. Sometimes, Emily would take her on long runs, in which case,
  Jane was allowed to wear a sports bra. On other days, Jane was totally naked
  except for her bindings.  
This was one of the days when she was totally naked. A sturdy chain was wrapped
  around her waist and her wrists were cuffed to the chain. Emily wore shorts,
  a t-shirt and sneakers, but Jane was denied even the protection for her feet.
  She didn&rsquo;t mind going shoeless so much because the trails were generally
  clear and free of sticks and rocks that would cause her pain. But going braless
  was very uncomfortable as her ample breasts would bounce as if they were on
  a workout schedule of their own.  
They were half way through the run on this afternoon when disaster struck.
  At least, it was a disaster as far as Jane was concerned. They had just emerged
  from the woods into a small clearing when they heard the voice.  
&ldquo;Nice filly you have there,&rdquo; said the male voice.  
Emily immediately stopped and Jane almost bumped into her, but managed to
  stop moments before the collision. Emily looked around to find the source and
  then smiled.  
&ldquo;Thank you, Bob,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a very fine filly.
  But I hope we haven&rsquo;t embarrassed you. I didn&rsquo;t expect anyone to
  be around.&rdquo;  
&ldquo;No problem,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just been taking down
  the old fence. I&rsquo;ve been at it for five months and just got around to
  this section. Good timing on my part, eh?&rdquo; And no, you haven&rsquo;t
  embarrassed me. I have quite an appreciation for a fine slavegirl. I assume
  she is your slave?&rdquo;  
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a conversation you don&rsquo;t hear very often,&rdquo; thought
  Jane. &ldquo;Two neighbors discussing a slave!&rdquo; Ordinarily, she would
  have raised her hands to provide some modesty but her bindings prevented that.
  Plus she had spent three weeks without clothes, so she was becoming accustomed
  to her nudity.  
Bob walked over to Emily and shook her hand. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t see much
  of you. I guess I know why now. How long have you owned her?&rdquo;  
&ldquo;Three weeks or so,&rdquo; replied Emily. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s fairly
  new.&rdquo;  
&ldquo;Yes she is,&rdquo; replied Bob. &ldquo;But you obviously have her very
  well trained. May I?&rdquo; he asked as he stepped in front of Jane.  
This is when Jane started regretting not darting back into the woods. Here
  she was, stark naked with her arms pinned to her sides by the chain around
  her waist and a stranger standing in front of her appraising her as if she
  were an object for sale.  
He smiled at her and then used his thumb and forefinger from one hand to pry
  her lips apart. He kept applying pressure until he had opened her mouth and
  used a finger from his other hand to run it around her teeth and gums. Then,
  he grasped her tongue and stretched it out of her mouth for inspection. She
  wondered if he was a dentist or horse trader in real life.  
&ldquo;Nice. Very nice,&rdquo; he commented to Emily.  
Then he stepped back slightly and reached out to lift Jane&rsquo;s breasts
  in his hands, letting his thumbs stroke back and forth across the nipples and
  causing them to stand out proudly. &ldquo;You might consider rings,&rdquo; he
  remarked, eliciting a gasp from Jane.  
Then he crouched down and ran his hands up and down her legs to continue the
  inspection. He ended by slipping a finger easily into her sex and drawing it
  out letting the sunlight show how it was glistening with her juices. This caused
  Jane&rsquo;s cheeks to burn red in embarrassment.  
&ldquo;You have a real thoroughbred here,&rdquo; he said as he turned back
  to Emily. &ldquo;Bring her by the house tomorrow and we can try her on the
  track. You might have a racer.&rdquo;  
&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; exclaimed Emily, when she finally realized that her neighbor
  was serious. &ldquo;What are you talking about? I was worried about embarrassing
  you but you seem to be very comfortable with the idea of me owning a slave.&rdquo;  
&ldquo;Oh, Emily,&rdquo; he smiled. &ldquo;I know all about slaves. I&rsquo;m
  not sure if I&rsquo;m comfortable with you owning one, but Meg and I have had
  some in the past.&rdquo;  
With that, he returned to his work. &ldquo;Enjoy the rest of your day. And
  if you want, tomorrow at around 3 o&rsquo;clock would work for us.&rdquo;  
After cooling down and bathing together, the two girls went outside for some
  pleasurable relaxation. It was a warm, sunny day and Emily spread a blanket
  on the lawn before helping Jane to lie down. Jane&rsquo;s wrists were cuffed
  to a collar that Emily had placed on her after the bath and, therefore, it
  was awkward for her to lie down by herself. When Emily was done positioning
  Jane, she knelt over her face and then leaned down to taste her slavegirl.
  She smiled when she found Jane&rsquo;s sex already very wet and realized that
  Jane seemed to be in a constant state of high sexual arousal. Very quickly,
  Jane&rsquo;s tongue started lapping at Emily&rsquo;s sex and, for the next
  thirty minutes, the two girls urged each other to several orgasms apiece. Finally,
  an exhausted Emily rolled off of Jane and then rearranged herself to cuddle
  and kiss her slave. &ldquo;Wow! I think we need another bath!&rdquo;  
&ldquo;Mmmmm,&rdquo; was all that Jane could say as she nuzzled against Emily&rsquo;s
  neck.  
&ldquo;So tell me, pip,&rdquo; asked Emily after a lengthy amount of cuddling, &ldquo;is
  this as horrible as you imagined?&rdquo;  
&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s not exactly nice being chained up all the time, you
  know.&rdquo;  
&ldquo;I suppose not,&rdquo; replied Emily. &ldquo;But it wouldn&rsquo;t be
  the same if you were totally free. This is supposed to be an exciting experience.
  A vacation from the stresses of life. Don&rsquo;t you feel freer now? Less
  inhibited? More alive?  
Jane laughed. &ldquo;Well running around naked all the time sure makes a person
  less inhibited. And it is kind of exciting in a strange way, but it&rsquo;s
  still pretty embarrassing.&rdquo;  
&ldquo;You must love that kind of humiliation then?&rdquo; observed Emily
  but she worded it as a question.  
&ldquo;Why do you say that?&rdquo; asked Jane.  
Emily slid her hand down, letting her palm glide over the satiny skin of Jane&rsquo;s
  belly and then slipped a finger into Jane&rsquo;s sex. &ldquo;This is why.
  You&rsquo;ve been positively sopping the entire time you&rsquo;ve been here.&rdquo;  
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; was Jane&rsquo;s only response as she felt her face blushing.  
That night, Jane had difficulty falling asleep. Early on in her captivity,
  she had decided to go along with Emily and simply endure it and try to view
  this as the vacation that Emily had talked about. After all, she trusted Emily
  completely and it was only for a month. At least she hoped it was only for
  a month. Emily had talked about trying it for a month but Jane couldn&rsquo;t
  remember exactly what Emily had said and whether or not she could call it quits
  at the end of that month.  
But what was troubling her most was the way she was changing and what she
  was feeling as time went on. Emily&rsquo;s glistening finger had provided proof
  that she was constantly aroused these days. Being a chained and naked slavegirl
  was highly erotic to her. And Emily had been right about it freeing her. She
  felt no obligations, responsibilities or concerns. She had to make no decisions
  and had no problems to solve. The lifestyle had it advantages and it was very
  healthy. She was well fed, she was exercised frequently and she was even pampered
  most of the time.  
This created a huge problem in itself, however. She had always been ambitious
  and driven. How could she reconcile the ambitions with her newfound contentment
  at being a slavegirl? She wrestled with this conflict until sleep finally overtook
  her.  
 
  Chapter 5: A Change of Pace  
&ldquo;Are you sure this is a good idea, Em?&rdquo; asked Jane as they were
  preparing to leave to visit the Hopewells.  
&ldquo;We were invited, pip,&rdquo; replied Emily as Jane acted the part of
  the handmaiden and dressed her mistress. &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be polite
  to reject their offer. Besides, we don&rsquo;t have any plans for the rest
  of the day.&rdquo;  
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Somehow it just doesn&rsquo;t feel right.&rdquo;  
Emily laughed. &ldquo;You just are embarrassed about being displayed naked
  and I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re not looking forward to being raced around their
  track.&rdquo;  
&ldquo;Well that too,&rdquo; responded Jane. &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s something
  else. I can&rsquo;t put my finger on it.&rdquo;  
&ldquo;Oh stop worrying,&rdquo; said Emily as she gave Jane a playful swat
  to her naked bottom. Jane just sighed and then knelt to fasten Emily&rsquo;s
  sandals to her feet. Emily had chosen to wear a white sundress, which nicely
  accented her tan. She had also elected to forgo any underwear, which Jane thought
  to be too daring, despite the fact that she knew she wold be going naked.  
The sundress also accented Emily&rsquo;s form. Over the past three weeks,
  Jane had grown to admire Emily&rsquo;s shape and proportions, and even to become
  aroused by her owner&rsquo;s body. The dress seemed to highlight, instead of
  hide, Emily&rsquo;s attributes. While the firm, high 36C breasts were not quite
  as large as Jane&rsquo;s, she thought they looked perfect on Emily and gave
  her a svelte and sleeker look than herself. Jane had always thought that she
  was too busty and would not have minded a smaller set of breasts. Emily&rsquo;s
  face was beautiful, with dark brown eyes that gave her a Mediterranean look.
  Her hair was a darker shade of brown than Jane&rsquo;s and had always been
  worn loose and flowing. She had begun, however, tying it into a ponytail since
  capturing Jane and now both girls wore their hair that way.  
The dress was not tight, but it was tailored to show that Emily had a narrow
  waist which, combined with her flaring hips, gave her the classic hourglass
  figure that women always aspired to. In her early twenties, Emily had done
  some modeling, but gave it up because she didn&rsquo;t like the people with
  whom she had to associate. But her legs were still those of a fashion model:
  Long and elegant.  
&ldquo;What should we have you wear today, little one?&rdquo; Emily asked.  
&ldquo;Is that a trick question?&rdquo; asked Jane sarcastically, which earned
  her another swat to her bottom.  
&ldquo;You know what I mean. Of course you will go naked. But how shall I
  decorate you?&rdquo; she pondered. &ldquo;I know just the thing!&rdquo;  
She went to the drawer that held Jane&rsquo;s entire wardrobe of chains, cuffs,
  collars and the like and returned carrying a few items. The first item that
  she put on Jane was a slender gold waist chain that rested seductively on the
  upper swells of Jane&rsquo;s hips. Then, she fastened a gold cuff to each wrist
  and gathered her captive&rsquo;s hands behind her back, latching the cuffs
  together before attaching them to the waist chain. Finally, Emily knelt and
  wrapped a wide leather strap around the top of Jane&rsquo;s right thigh and
  buckled it tightly, securing it in place.  
A puzzled Jane looked down at the strap. It was black and was probably three
  or four inches wide, but seemed to serve no purpose whatsoever. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
  it for?&rdquo; she asked.  
&ldquo;Beats me,&rdquo; replied Emily as she got back to her feet. &ldquo;I
  just thought it would look exotic. Here, take a look.&rdquo; She turned Jane
  toward the full length mirror eliciting a gasp from Jane as she saw her reflection.
  The leather band may have served no purpose, but it did indeed look exotic
  and erotic and seemed to emphasize her status as a slavegirl.  
Emily decided that they would walk to their destination since it was a beautiful
  day and they could cut through the woods and fields without being seen. She
  let Jane go unleashed, but carried a leash and collar in case she changed her
  mind later. After the brief walk, they emerged into the neighbor&rsquo;s yard
  to find the Hopewells relaxing in lawn chairs.  
&ldquo;Here come our guests,&rdquo; proclaimed Bob as he arose from his chair
  to greet the two girls. Meg also stood up and gave Emily a kiss on the cheek. &ldquo;You
  look lovelier than normal,&rdquo; said Meg to Emily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad
  that you could make it. And I&rsquo;m glad that you brought your new pet, also.&rdquo;  
Jane bristled as she heard herself being referred to as a pet but bit her
  tongue to keep from getting herself into trouble. Then, as Meg moved to stand
  in front of her with her eyes roaming as if inspecting the slave, Jane felt
  her irritation turning into embarrassment and she instinctively cast her eyes
  downward.  
&ldquo;Oh my, what a catch!&rdquo; exclaimed Meg.  
&ldquo;I told you that Emily had good taste,&rdquo; offered Bob.  
&ldquo;I think that your exact words were &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll bet that Emily
  tastes good,&rsquo;&rdquo; laughed Meg before turning back to Emily. &ldquo;She
  must have been very expensive. Where did you buy her?&rdquo; 
 
This caused Emily to raise her eyebrows. She had never even dreamed that people
  were bought and sold in this day and age. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t buy her,&rdquo; she
  replied. &ldquo;I captured her.&rdquo;  
&ldquo;Such a much better way to stock your stables,&rdquo; nodded Meg. Much
  less expensive and  
it opens up the whole world as candidates. Although, it comes with a lot more
  risk.&rdquo;  
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve known Jane for a long time. So I didn&rsquo;t think
  there was a lot of risk.&rdquo;  
&ldquo;Good for you,&rdquo; smiled Meg. &ldquo;She really is a wonderful thing.
  What are your plans for her?&rdquo;  
Jane listened closely to Emily&rsquo;s response. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
  really. I said that we&rsquo;d try it for a month and reassess everything then.
  We&rsquo;ll just have to see.&rdquo;  
Jane was relieved at Emily&rsquo;s response but that relief was quickly dashed
  when she heard Bob speak up.  
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame. But then again, maybe you&rsquo;ll decide to keep
  her. And if not, I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;d be willing to buy her from you,&rdquo; the
  man said. This sent a chill shooting down Jane&rsquo;s spine.  
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a tall one,&rdquo; said the diminutive Meg who could not
  have been more than an inch over five feet tall. Then she laughed. &ldquo;You
  both are! In fact, you make a perfect matched set!&rdquo;  
Emily laughed and then sat down when the Hopewells invited her to join them.
  Jane moved beside Emily and then knelt when she saw her owner point to a spot
  on the ground.  
&ldquo;So have you thought about racing your filly?&rdquo; asked Bob.  
&ldquo;No, not really,&rdquo; replied Emily.  
&ldquo;Another shame. She has the build and she appears to have the strength.
  I&rsquo;d bet that she would be a very fast ponygirl.&rdquo;  
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a ponygirl, exactly?&rdquo; asked Emily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
  seen some pictures of them on the internet but I assumed that it was just some
  kind of costume.&rdquo;  
&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; responded Meg. &ldquo;Some people are quite serious about
  their ponies. And there are pony boys too.&rdquo; Then Meg went on to describe
  the different types of ponies and how their owners used them. Jane listened
  in horror as she heard about people being kept in stables and girls pulling
  carts. Even the equestrian and dressage events were distasteful to her, despite
  her enjoyment of those things when they were performed with real horses.  
&ldquo;Bob and I find the idea exciting and we have even used some of our
  slaves as ponies. But more as a change of pace rather than a steady diet.&rdquo;  
&ldquo;How many slaves have you owned?&rdquo; asked a curious Emily.  
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see,&rdquo; replied Bob as he thought for a moment. &ldquo;We
  have had five subs, but only one of them was a slave.&rdquo;  
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the difference?&rdquo; asked Emily. Meg took over and
  explained how subs could set limits and how the relationship was frequently
  not full time. Slaves had no say in things and were frequently full-time. &ldquo;I
  guess Jane&rsquo;s a sub then. Well, no,&rdquo; said Emily as she furrowed
  her brow, &ldquo;I guess she&rsquo;s a temporary slave. At least for another
  week.&rdquo;  
Meg sighed as she nodded. &ldquo;Well enjoy her while you can. Does she have
  any talents?&rdquo;  
Jane was once again becoming irritated. It was driving her crazy to listen
  to the way that everyone was talking around her. They behaved as if she weren&rsquo;t
  even there. Or as if she were an inanimate object. &lsquo;Pet!!!&rsquo; she
  thought disgustedly.  
&ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s very good at a lot of things. And she has become
  quite talented wither tongue in the past three weeks,&rdquo; replied Emily,
  eliciting a soft groan from Jane. Emily reacted by reaching down and giving
  Jane&rsquo;s bottom a swat.  
&ldquo;Really? I&rsquo;ll have to check that out some time,&rdquo; said Meg.  
&ldquo;Oh please do. You are welcome to check it out right now, if you like.
  And Bob, you should feel free to enjoy her too. I&rsquo;m afraid that I have
  been remiss lately in my job. I haven&rsquo;t provided her with any male companionship
  for three weeks. And she&rsquo;s a professed heterosexual.&rdquo;  
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very generous of you,&rdquo; responded Bob. Then he turned
  toward his wife. &ldquo;Shall we?&rdquo;  
Meg grinned and stood up to start shedding her clothes. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Soon
  both hosts were naked and were positioning Jane for their pleasure. Meg laid
  down in the grass and Jane was moved between her legs. With her hands still
  held behind her, this was difficult for the slavegirl. But it became easier
  when Bob slid behind her and grasped her arms. At least now she wouldn&rsquo;t
  have to worry about falling forward. Bob arched his hips forward, spearing
  his cock deep inside of Jane, causing her to moan as her tongue started working
  on Meg&rsquo;s sex.  
&ldquo;Is she always this wet?&rdquo; asked Bob as he turned his head to Emily.  
&ldquo;Always,&rdquo; replied Emily. &ldquo;At least she has been constantly
  wet for the past three weeks.&rdquo; Jane heard herself being discussed again
  but was almost beyond becoming embarrassed at this point. She continued to
  lap at Meg&rsquo;s sex, flickering her tongue over the clit occasionally, as
  she enjoyed the filling penetration of Bob.  
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the only one dressed, my dear,&rdquo; observed Bob. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t
  you be more comfortable without the dress?&rdquo;  
Emily laughed. &ldquo;I guess I would.&rdquo; She reached behind her back
  and unzipped the garment, letting it slide down her body to pool at her feet. &ldquo;When
  in Rome&hellip;&rdquo;  
&ldquo;Oh very nice. Much better. May I?&rdquo; asked Bob as he reached a
  hand out to Emily. Emily drew closer and when she got close enough, Bob wrapped
  his arm around her hips and pulled her to him.  
&ldquo;So divine,&rdquo; he muttered as his lips moved across the lower swells
  of Emily&rsquo;s breasts. He kept pistoning in and out of Jane and started
  playfully nipping at Emily&rsquo;s breast flesh with his teeth.  
At this point, Meg, who had been silent other than for her moans, propped
  herself up on her elbows. She gazed over Jane&rsquo;s head, back and bottom
  to catch her first glimpse of a naked Emily. &ldquo;Fabulous!&rdquo; she exclaimed
  and then sucked in her breath quickly as Jane&rsquo;s tongue started flickering
  over her clit again. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a magnificent creature, isn&rsquo;t
  she dear?&rdquo;  
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s wonderful,&rdquo; he said as he took a break from devouring
  Emily&rsquo;s breasts. &ldquo;The two girls really are a matched pair.&rdquo; He
  slid his hand down between Emily&rsquo;s legs and started stroking her clit
  as he started to suckle on her nipples.  
Emily arched her back to feed her breasts to Bob&rsquo;s lips and teeth and
  smiled proudly as she heard herself being appraised as an equal to Jane. Emily
  knew that she was pretty but did not think that she was in the same league
  as Jane who she thought was truly stunning. And yet her neighbors viewed the
  two of them as a matched pair.  
Meg achieved orgasm first and let out a long, low groan before reaching down
  and lifting Jane&rsquo;s head. Jane&rsquo;s eyes were closed but her tongue
  was still fluttering furiously, which caused Meg to laugh. &ldquo;Whoa girl!
  If you keep doing that to me, I&rsquo;ll end up in a hospital or something.&rdquo;  
Meg then raised Jane higher until she was almost kneeling upright. This made
  for a difficult angle for Bob so he pulled out of Jane, causing the slavegirl
  to whimper at her new emptiness. Then he looked up at Emily. &ldquo;I seem
  to have lost my place. Would you do me the honors?&rdquo;  
Emily was confused for a moment. She didn&rsquo;t know if Bob was asking her
  to help him reinsert his cock in Jane or if he wanted to impale her. Never
  one to look a gift cock in the mouth, she quickly took the initiative and laid
  back in the grass, opening her legs in invitation to Bob. Bob shuffled between
  the spread thighs and then leaned forward letting his member slide into the
  waiting and wet sex. &ldquo;Ahhhh! Home at lastl!&rdquo; he groaned.  
In the meantime, Meg took advantage of Bob&rsquo;s disengagement and straightened
  Jane all the way up. &ldquo;Much better,&rdquo; she declared as she knelt before
  the kneeling slave and kissed her. Meg&rsquo;s hands roamed down to Jane&rsquo;s
  breasts and captured them, squeezing until the firm globes of flesh oozed from
  between her fingers. &ldquo;All the goodies are available now.&rdquo;  
Bob and Emily continued their passionate coupling, occasionally glancing over
  at Meg and Jane. Meg had lowered her head and was moving from one nipple to
  the other, sucking them into her mouth, nibbling on them, and then stretching
  them away from Jane&rsquo;s chest only to let her teeth graze along them as
  they slowly slid from between her lips. Meg&rsquo;s hand was between Jane&rsquo;s
  legs with three fingers thrust inside the girl and her thumb moving furiously
  back and forth across the swollen clit. Jane had her head thrown back with
  her eyes closed and was simply making unintelligible sounds.  
All three of them climaxed almost simultaneously and the air was filled with
  moans and whimpers. Bob collapsed on top of Emily and she hugged him, wrapping
  her arms around him to hold him in place and to keep his cock lodged inside
  of her. Meg had to hold Jane up to keep her from toppling forward but finally
  managed to lay her down on her side. Then, Meg laid down in front of her, kissing
  the girl and licking her own juices from Jane&rsquo;s lips.  
&ldquo;Well, that was fun,&rdquo; Emily told Jane as she led her slave back
  toward home later in the day. &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;  
&ldquo;It was sure different,&rdquo; observed Jane. &ldquo;They must have
  a very different kind of relationship.&rdquo;  
&ldquo;I think they&rsquo;re just a very open couple,&rdquo; said Emily. &ldquo;I
  really like them both. And it was sure nice to get fucked. I was about to start
  crawling the walls. Maybe I should get us a strap-on to play with.&rdquo;  
Jane just shook her head as she listened to her sex-crazed owner. That evening,
  the phone rang and it was Meg. She chatted with Emily for a long time before
  Emily hung up the phone and plopped down on the couch beside Jane. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
  been invited back tomorrow afternoon. It seems they had as much fun as we did.
  We&rsquo;ll go swimming if it&rsquo;s nice.&rdquo;  
&ldquo;What else did you talk about?&rdquo; asked Jane.  
&ldquo;You mostly,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;They seem to be quite taken
  by you.&rdquo;  
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nice. As long as I&rsquo;m not taken by them. Being taken
  by one person is quite enough for me, thank you,&rdquo; said Jane.  
Emily laughed at Jane&rsquo;s play on words and gave her slave a hug. &ldquo;You
  can be so cute! As a matter of fact, she did happen to mention that they were
  thinking about getting back into slave ownership and asked me to consider selling
  you to them.&rdquo;  
&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; gasped Jane.  
&ldquo;I told them I&rsquo;d think about it,&rdquo; responded Emily before
  breaking out laughing. &ldquo;Of course I wouldn&rsquo;t sell you to them,
  silly. If you&rsquo;re going to remain in slavery, you will be my slave.&rdquo; Jane
  nodded warily.  
Chapter 6: Baiting the Hook 
&ldquo;Only a few more days until it will be a month,&rdquo; said Emily as
  she laced up her running shoes. She planned on taking Jane for her run and
  they would end up at the Hopewell's. &ldquo;What do you think we should do
  at the end?&rdquo; 
Jane sighed. She knew this question would come up and wasn't quite sure how
  she would answer it. &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; she finally replied, honestly. &ldquo;You
  were right that it was exciting. I can't remember anything every being so exciting.
  And you were right about the feeling of freedom from not having decisions and
  responsibilities.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;You have been the perfect slavegirl,&rdquo; smiled Emily as she straightened
  up and kissed Jane. 
&ldquo;But it just doesn't feel right to commit to slavery. I should be thinking
  of career and family and children. I have my whole life ahead of me. It doesn't
  seem right that I should spend it like this.&rdquo; She emphasized her point
  by lifting and then dropping her arms causing her chains to rattle. For the
  run, Emily had placed a heavier chain around the slavegirl's waist with a chain
  that ran from each side of her to her cuffs. This allowed her to move her arms
  while running but she could only raise her hands as high as her breasts. &ldquo;Besides,
  it's totally unfair to ask me that. Nobody should ever be asked if they want
  to be a slave.&rdquo; 
Emily chuckled as she placed her hands over Jane's breasts and kissed her
  again. &ldquo;You're right. Maybe I should make the decision myself.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; protested Jane. &ldquo;That's not what I meant!&rdquo; 
&ldquo;I know what you meant,&rdquo; laughed Emily. Let's not worry about
  it. We still have a few days to decide.&rdquo; 
They found the Hopewells already in the pool when they arrived and were invited
  to join in. Emily quickly peeled out of her clothes and was getting ready to
  jump in when Jane shouted. &ldquo;Hey! Do you want me to drown?&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; said Emily. &ldquo;I guess I'm still not used to owning
  you.&rdquo; The Hopewell's chuckled as Emily went over to Jane and produced
  her key. After Emily removed the chains, Jane was left wearing only the cuffs
  around her wrists and she realized that this was the first time in almost a
  month that she had not been bound like a prisoner. But her reflection on this
  was cut short when Emily gave her a shove and toppled her into the water. Then,
  Emily dove in and swam underwater, emerging in front of Meg and kissing her
  hostess. 
&ldquo;Thank you for inviting me, Ma'am. The water feels divine.&rdquo; 
Meg wrapped her arms around Emily's neck and drew her into a passionate kiss. &ldquo;You're
  welcome. You make this place even more divine.&rdquo; 
In the meantime, Bob swam up behind Jane. He wrapped his arms around her
  and grasped her breasts, using them as handles to pull her to him. He adjusted
  her up and down a bit until her sex was poised just above his cock and then
  slid easily into her. &ldquo;Amazing! Even after a run, she's wet!&rdquo; 
Jane opened her eyes wide at the unexpected intrusion and then blushed as
  she heard Bob's comment. But she welcomed being filled by his cock. And this
  started her mind churning. A month ago, she would never have considered swimming
  naked in a neighbor's pool and would have slapped someone who tried to have
  sex with her without asking her first. In fact, she might have even had them
  charged with attempted rape. 
Now, however, she was accepting and even welcoming of this kind of treatment.
  Things had truly changed for her and she started to think that maybe she should
  remain as Emily's slave. She certainly had adapted well to her captivity. And
  she had to admit that she found many aspects of it appealing. As she had told
  Emily, it was very, very exciting. And there was no way of hiding that from
  anyone. Her wet sex and rock-hard nipples were ample evidence. And the sexual
  flush that frequently spread across her cheeks and chest also gave it away. 
Also, she had never in her life experienced so many orgasms. It was like
  a non-stop ride of erotic thrills. While she had always enjoyed sex, she never
  remembered craving it like she did these days. And she could feel another orgasm
  quickly approaching. But just as she was about to reach the crest, Bob slid
  out of her causing her to groan. 
&ldquo;Just a taste for now!&rdquo; he chuckled. &ldquo;There'll be plenty
  of time for more of that later.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Hey you two!&rdquo; shouted Meg from across the pool. &ldquo;Stop
  horsing around. I thought we were going to show these two some pony things,
  Bob.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Yes Mistress,&rdquo; replied Bob in an exaggerated tone, bordering
  on sarcasm. All four naked people laughed and then climbed out of the pool
  to towel each other dry. Jane actually hugged herself, reveling in her freedom
  of movement. Then the foursome headed across the lawn, led by a naked Megan
  with an equally naked Emily beside her. 
&ldquo;Were you ever a slave yourself?&rdquo; Meg asked. 
&ldquo;No, never,&rdquo; replied Emily. 
&ldquo;How did you get involved in all of this then?&rdquo; How did you learn
  what you need to know in order to own another?&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Don't know really. Books, internet, dreams, fantasy. And a lot of
  experimentation once I took Jane.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Well, you've done wonderfully. Especially given your inexperience,&rdquo; praised
  Meg. &ldquo;Of course, there's nothing quite like first hand experience. Starting
  at the bottom, so to speak.&rdquo; Bob started to get the gist of the conversation
  and started to slow down Jane so that she did not overhear the discussion by
  wrapping his arm around her waist and gripping the chain that she wore. 
&ldquo;And I suppose you're going to tell me that you were a sub once?&rdquo; challenged
  Emily. 
&ldquo;A slave, actually. Bob bought me from my first owner but eventually
  he realized that I would be happier as a top. Since then, he has found a few
  subs for me. And the one slave we told you about.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Well, I'm quite happy as a top,&rdquo; declared Emily. 
&ldquo;How can you know that until you've been a bottom? And how can you
  know how to treat a slave unless you've at least tasted it?&rdquo; 
&ldquo;I guess there are some things that you just know,&rdquo; said Emily. 
Meg wrapped an arm around Emily's hips and Jane, who was far behind at this
  point saw the action and had to stifle a giggle. Here was a woman who was almost
  a foot shorter than her owner holding Emily possessively. 
&ldquo;I have a proposition for you,&rdquo; Meg went on causing Emily's ears
  to perk up. &ldquo;As I mentioned, I believe that one needs to bottom before
  they can top effectively. You might disagree, but I speak from many years of
  watching relationships flourish or fail. Do you want to keep Jane?&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Of course I do,&rdquo; replied Emily. &ldquo;I love her and she has
  provided the most exciting month of my life. And she is absolutely gorgeous.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Yes, she is very pretty,&rdquo; nodded Meg as they neared the barn. &ldquo;Well
  I will predict that it all ends soon, never to be repeated unless you do something
  about it. And here's where my proposition comes in.&rdquo; 
Emily listened intently but was feeling a bit nervous. Part of that was because
  of the uncertainty about what would come out of Meg's mouth. And part was because
  of the way Meg's hand seemed to move possessively over Emily's hip, thigh,
  waist and chest as they walked. 
&ldquo;Be our slavegirl for a week,&rdquo; Meg went on. Hearing the first
  part of the proposal caused Emily to suck in her breath. &ldquo;And I do mean
  slave. We're not talking about sub. This is the whole thing where we own you.
  And of course, we will want to own Jane, also.&rdquo; 
Emily stopped in her tracks, just outside of the barn. &ldquo;Come along,&rdquo; urged
  Meg as she pushed Emily forward. &ldquo;You can learn a lot from two experienced
  owners. By the way, we both started as slaves.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;At the end of the week, you can make the decision. You might decide
  to leave. In that case, you leave with Jane and you will have gained valuable
  insights into being an owner. Or you might decide to stay, in which case you
  become our slave. Either way, it's your choice. Either you leave with your
  slave or you both stay as our slavegirls.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; cried Emily after everything started to sink in. &ldquo;Did
  you say that you and Bob started as slaves?&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Yes I did, but the circumstances were very different for me. I was
  a slave for two years before Bob bought me and then I was a slave for three
  more years with him as my owner. And Bob was a slave too. He did exactly what
  I am proposing to you. He agreed to be the slave of a couple for a week so
  that he could have a greater appreciation of the lifestyle.&rdquo; 
Then Meg laughed. &ldquo;And he hasn't sucked a cock since that week. Although,
  he still toys with the boys occasionally.&rdquo; 
All of this had Jane's head spinning. She was being asked to become a slave
  herself. Her hosts had both been slaves at one time. Bob sucked cocks? It was
  all too much too absorb. 
Meg continued to urge Emily deeper into the barn and finally stopped in front
  of two stalls. &ldquo;This is where you would be kept for a couple of those
  days. We would let the two of you experience the life of ponygirls.&rdquo; 
Jane looked inside one of the stalls and saw that it was freshly cleaned
  and appointed. Fresh straw was strewn across the floor and a little sleeping
  mat laid in one corner. Hanging from pegs on one wall were an assortment of
  leather straps, bridles and bits. On another wall hung more straps but these
  were more ornamental in nature, some complete with brightly colored plumes. 
&ldquo;When would all of this start?&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Whenever you want it to start,&rdquo; replied Meg. &ldquo;We could
  enslave you immediately if that was what you wished.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;I'll have to think about it,&rdquo; Emily replied as her fingers toyed
  with the leather straps and she tried to imagine herself wearing them. &ldquo;Can
  I give you an answer tomorrow?&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Of course you can,&rdquo; smiled Meg as she rose onto her toes to
  kiss Emily. &ldquo;And if you can't make a decision that fast, then the offer
  will remain open.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;How will I know that you will release us at the end of the week?&rdquo; 
Meg laughed. &ldquo;You won't. And that uncertainty should add to the thrill.
  But we have never been kidnappers before. It's highly unlikely that we would
  start now.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;What will be expected of us?&rdquo; asked Emily. 
&ldquo;Everything! Anything! Whatever we dream up. And we both have very
  active imaginations. Surprise! Surprise! That's our motto.&rdquo; 
Emily nodded slowly as if in a daze. Then she shook her head to clear it. &ldquo;Maybe
  we should have some kind of agreement. Kind of like a contract.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;We can do that,&rdquo; replied Meg, wrapping her arm around Emily
  to guide her out of the stall. &ldquo;We have a standard slavery contract that
  we used once. Let's go find the other two and you can think it over. I wonder
  what happened to them.&rdquo; 
The found the other two outside of the barn. Bob had fastened Jane's cuffs
  to a beam jutting out of the barn leaving her with her arms spread wide and
  her toes just grazing the ground. His cock was standing erect and was glistening
  in the sunlight making it obvious that he had been fucking the slavegirl again. 
&ldquo;You're incorrigible!&rdquo; exclaimed Meg. 
&ldquo;Just giving the girl another taste,&rdquo; he grinned. 
&ldquo;Well let her down so I can get her into the tack so Emily can see
  what a real ponygirl looks like.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Yes Mistress,&rdquo; he said again, bowing deeply. When Jane was released,
  Meg disappeared into the barn with her, leaving Bob and Emily outside. 
Bob walked up to Emily and reached up grasping the two erect nipples to roll
  them back and forth with his fingers. &ldquo;So are you going to be my slavegirl?&rdquo; 
Emily felt a thrill shoot through her body at his touch and felt her knees
  weakening. &ldquo;I'm thinking about it. But what's in it for the two of you?
  Why would you waste a week of your time with us?&rdquo; 
&ldquo;The same thing that's in it for you,&rdquo; he replied as he continued
  to roll the hard buds, slowly increasing the pressure. &ldquo;An exciting time.
  A learning experience. And we would learn too. We always learn from our subs.
  And it would definitely not be a waste of time. We can't think of a better
  way to spend a week than with two gorgeous slavegirls.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;What do you plan to do with us if we agree?&rdquo; asked Emily as
  the fingers kept sending erotic thrills through her body. 
 &ldquo;How did Meg answer that? I'm sure you must have asked her.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;She said everything and anything.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Well, that's not entirely true,&rdquo; said Bob. He started stepping
  back, drawing Emily forward by her nipples. &ldquo;What she probably meant
  to say is everything and anything that we want. But there are lots of things
  that we could do that we won't because it wouldn't appeal to us. 
&ldquo;Like what?&rdquo; asked Emily as she continued to be led by her breasts. 
&ldquo;Like scat, for instance. Neither of us likes it so you won't be doing
  anything with shit,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;And like burning cigarettes.
  We wouldn't want to do anything to mar the beauty of anything. That would be
  like purposefully driving a Rolls Royce into a tree. Makes no sense.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;What kinds of things do you like, then?&rdquo; askedEmily who winced
  at the end of her question when Bob squeezed her nipples tightly. 
&ldquo;Meg plans on having a pair of ponies drive her through the countryside
  for a day. I imagine that we'll try to test your limits, both physically and
  psychologically. That's where a lot of the learning comes from. And sex of
  course. We both plan to enjoy our lovelies.&rdquo; Bob finally stopped and
  reached down to the picnic table to pick up a blindfold. The last thing that
  Emily saw before her sight was taken away was Bob's cock bouncing up and down
  and rubbing against her hip. Then he drew her arms behind her and placed two
  cuffs on her wrists, latching them together. 
Bob then slipped a finger into Emily, withdrawing it and lifting it to her
  face to rub it across her lips. &ldquo;You know that you want to do it,&rdquo; he
  taunted. Emily just whimpered. 
&ldquo;You won't pierce our nipples or anything, will you?&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Not during your first week,&rdquo; he reassured her. &ldquo;But if
  you decide to stay, all bets are off.&rdquo; I love the look of gold hoops
  accenting breasts. And they are so useful for controlling an unruly girl.&rdquo; 
Emily shuddered at the thought of her tender nipples being skewered and ringed
  but immediately became distracted by the sounds coming from the direction of
  the barn door. The sounds of foot steps and an occasional slap of leather against
  naked flesh told Emily that Meg was bringing out Jane. &ldquo;Are you ready
  to see your ponygirl, sweet girl?&rdquo; asked Bob as he ran his fingers lightly
  down her side leaving a trail of gooseflesh in their wake. Emily shuddered
  again and was just able to croak out a &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Behold!&rdquo; announced Bob as he whipped off the blindfold. Standing
  before her was the most erotic sight she had ever seen. Jane was wearing a
  full bridle, complete with bit and blinders. A strap of polished white leather
  crossed her forehead and wrapped around her head. A brilliant red plume of
  feathers stood above her head, rustling in the light breeze. More white leather
  led to the bit that was firmly embedded in her mouth and which would obviously
  be very effective at controlling the new pony. 
White leather straps led from a kind of leather yoke to a leather band around
  her waist and criss-crossed Jane's chest capturing each breast at the base
  and causing them to bulge. Emily always knew that Jane's breasts were large
  but this made them look even bigger. And each nipple was clamped with a tiny
  bell dangling beneath it. 
From the waist band, more white straps led downward and disappeared between
  her legs, capturing the girl's labia and holding them open to reveal her glistening
  sex. The ensemble was completed by a pair of white high-heeled boots that encased
  her legs to above her knees. 
&ldquo;Oh my!&rdquo; exclaimed Emily when she saw Jane's enhancements. &ldquo;She
  looks good enough to eat!&rdquo; 
&ldquo;That can be arranged,&rdquo; grinned Meg who was obviously proud of
  her work. &ldquo;If I had had more time, I would have gotten rid of this.&rdquo; And
  she tugged on a thatch of the brown pubic hair that was Jane's only source
  of modesty at the time. &ldquo;That would have enhanced the look, but you get
  the picture.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;But she's beautiful! She's perfect!&rdquo; said Emily. 
&ldquo;Yes she is,&rdquo; said Meg. &ldquo;But can she prance?&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Why don't you run her through her paces, dear?&rdquo; offered Bob
  as he pulled Emily to him. As Meg led Jane to the side of the barn, Bob leaned
  over and whispered into Emily's ear. &ldquo;Picture yourself in her place.
  We have a matching harness. For a matching pair.&rdquo; 
Emily's mind was a whirlwind. She was torn completely. Seeing Jane displayed
  this way made her want to own her friend even more. But seeing her displayed
  like this also made her curious. &ldquo;What must be going through her mind
  right now?&rdquo; she wondered. &ldquo;What would it feel like to be inside
  that tack? Is she as aroused as I am?&rdquo; She made up her mind at that point
  to accept the Hopewell's offer. She and Jane would become slaves of Bob and
  Meg for a week. Now she just needed to figure out how to break the news to
  Jane. 
Jane was taught to prance by a not-too-forgiving Meg who frequently used
  her riding crop to correct the slavegirl. Bob finished his &ldquo;tasting&rdquo; by
  fucking Emily as she leaned over the fence beside the small corral. And Emily
  had the strangest mixture of emotions of her life. She watched Jane prancing
  in circles, raising her knees high with each step and was filed with conflicting
  emotions of pride and jealousy. 
That evening, as Emily spooned against the back of her bound slavegirl, Emily
  broached the subject. &ldquo;You wouldn't mind a few extra days as a slave,
  would you?&rdquo; 
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; was the response in the darkness. 
&ldquo;I mean that we're all conflicted and we shouldn't make hasty decisions
  just because the month is ending. Don't you agree?&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Well when would my slavery end, then?&rdquo; asked Jane, feeling Emily
  cuddling up tighter against her back. Each evening, she was bound in a different
  way. For this night, she wore both wrist and ankle cuffs with a short chain
  connecting them. This had the effect of bending her in two and made for an
  easy target for spooning. 
&ldquo;In about a week from now.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Why the extension?&rdquo; asked the bound girl. 
&ldquo;It's just something that I want to do,&rdquo; replied Emily after
  a brief hesitation. 
Jane remained silent for a moment and then responded. &ldquo;Okay. Tell me.
  What gives?&rdquo; 
Emily sighed and then told Jane about the offer. Jane listened silently and
  then remained silent after Emily had finished. 
Emily finally broke the silence. &ldquo;So would you mind?&rdquo; 
Jane took a deep breath before responding. &ldquo;You are my mistress. You
  are my owner. If it would please you to keep me in slavery for a few more days,
  then it would please me.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;You are too precious,&rdquo; declared Emily, hugging herself against
  Jane's back. &ldquo;I really do have to get us that strap-on because there's
  nothing I would like better than to fuck you right now until you scream.&rdquo; 
Jane laughed. &ldquo;I just hope you know what you're doing. I trust you.
  I don't even know them. So I'm putting my life in your hands. When do we start?&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Tomorrow, I guess&rdquo; replied Emily. &ldquo;And thank you
    for trusting me.&rdquo; 
   
&ldquo;You haven't called me pip today,&rdquo; said Jane quietly. &ldquo;Am
  I no longer your pip?&rdquo; 
Emily felt her eyes starting to water. &ldquo;You'll always be my pip.&rdquo; With
  that she reached an arm across Jane and found a breast, which she claimed for
  the rest of the night as they slept. 
Chapter 7: A Bold Move 
&ldquo;I hope you know what you're doing,&rdquo; remarked Jane as the two
  stood at the edge of the woods together, trying to gather enough courage to
  step out into the Hopewell yard. 
&ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; said Emily as she removed the last of Jane's bindings
  leaving her completely naked and unadorned in any way for the first time since
  the coffee shop. &ldquo;Well here goes nothin'&rdquo; And together they walked
  hand-in hand toward the house. 
&ldquo;Bob met them at the bottom of the stairs to the porch. &ldquo;Kneel
  slavegirls,&rdquo; he said in an authoritative voice. &ldquo;Meg tells me that
  you wanted something in writing. Read this and sign it. Then bring it into
  the house with you.&rdquo; With that, he turned and went back inside. 
Emily laid the document down and the two girls read it together, emitting
  little gasps at certain phrases or clauses. &ldquo;willingly give my mind,
  body and soul&rdquo; was one that earned a gasp. &ldquo;understand that I will
  submit to anything required by my owners&rdquo; was another. Most of it was
  similar to a slave ownership agreement that Emily had bumped into on the internet
  when she was studying her newfound obsession. It was during that research that
  she had stumbled onto pictures of ponygirls but she remembered that none of
  them had been as breathtaking as Jane in her tack. 
It was obvious, though, that the document had been modified and tailored
  to her. It said that this was a one-week ownership and that it could be renewed
  for the rest of her life at the end of that week. It indicated that, by signing
  the contract, Emily also yielded ownership of her slave, Jane, for the duration
  of the term. A loud gasp came as they read about transferability of rights.
  It said that the girls could not be sold during the first week but that they
  could be sold at any time if the contract was renewed. It did, however, indicate
  that they would be sold together as a set. 
Then there was a long list of items, some of which were already checked.
  Reading the top of the page, they learned that checked items would be prohibited
  but that any unchecked items were fair game during the first week. After the
  first week, all boxes would be treated as unchecked. 
They read through the list and Jane gulped as she tried to imagine some of
  these things. Every manner of deviant sexual behavior seemed to be listed.
  The Hopewells had already checked off a dozen or so behaviors. Scatology, piercing,
  branding and a number of others were already placed out of bounds by their
  future owners. But there were still plenty of unpleasantries left. The instructions
  at the top of the page indicated that Emily could select five more items to
  remove from the list, which caused the girls to start chattering as they tried
  to verbally prioritize it in terms of offensiveness. 
Meg and Bob watched them through the window and chuckled together as an occasional
  hand flew to a mouth in shock or as one or both of the girls started fidgeting
  nervously. &ldquo;They look so cute out there,&rdquo; observed Meg. &ldquo;Do
  you think they'll stay beyond the week?&rdquo; 
&ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; replied Bob, giving his wife a hug, &ldquo;but
  I think they probably will.&rdquo; 
Emily and Jane worked together and eliminated hanging, electric shock, mummification
  (they weren't sure what that was but Jane didn't like the sounds of it) and
  tattoos. But they wished that they had several more choices instead of just
  one more. There were still three items that they wanted to rule out: videotaping,
  minors and bestiality. 
&ldquo;I'm not fucking a dog!&rdquo; exclaimed Jane. 
&ldquo;Relax. They don't even have a dog,&rdquo; replied Emily who inwardly
  knew that she also had no desire to have a dog or horse or monkey or anything
  else as a lover. 
Back and forth they argued about which item was the worst. &ldquo;I think
  it would be gross to have sex with a teenager,&rdquo; was Emily's view on minors. &ldquo;If
  we allow videotaping, we can never go back to our old lives,&rdquo; was Jane's
  observation. &ldquo;The clips would probably end up all over the internet.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Together they finally agreed to check the box next to videotaping.
  Emily agreed that allowing themselves to be recorded would probably come back
  to haunt them later in life while the other two would only be unpleasantries
  for the next week. Plus, they reasoned, the other two were unlikely since the
  Hopewells had no children or pets. It never even dawned on them that they had
  overlooked an even more serious item in the list that they never even discussed. 
They turned to the last page and read the remaining paragraphs, which described
  their rights as slaves: food, water and medical treatment, however, seemed
  to be their only rights. Emily picked up the pen and, with a shaky hand, managed
  to sign and date the document. There as another signature line below the first
  one but it was to be signed at the end of the week. Emily stared at that line
  for a long time knowing that it would seal her fate for the rest of her life
  and wondered if her name would ever appear on it. 
Bob opened the door after he heard the knock and ushered the two naked girls
  inside. Emily held out the contract, which Bob accepted and looked over. &ldquo;Interesting
  selections,&rdquo; he observed. Were they difficult choices to make?&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Very difficult,&rdquo; replied Emily. 
There wasn't a place for me to sign though, Bob,&rdquo; observed Jane. 
&ldquo;Well now, that brings up two interesting points. First, your signature
  was not required because you are already the property of Emily. Her signature
  was all that was needed to transfer title of your body, mind and soul to us.&rdquo; He
  emphasized his point by squeezing her breast as he said &ldquo;body,&rdquo; stroking
  her temple as he said &ldquo;mind,&rdquo; and placing his palm on her chest
  as he said &ldquo;soul&rdquo; causing Jane to tremble. 
&ldquo;As to the second point, for the duration of this contract, you are
  both to call us Master or Mistress. Understood?&rdquo; 
Jane gulped and nodded her head slowly. &ldquo;Yes Master.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Yes Master,&rdquo; whispered Emily. 
Meg came up to them and commanded the two girls to kneel, which they promptly
  did. Then she bent down and encircled each neck, starting with Emily, with
  a woven collar. &ldquo;You may rise and check out your new attire in the mirror.&rdquo; They
  quickly got to their feet and went to the mirror where they each emitted an &ldquo;ooo.&rdquo; The
  collars were about two inches tall and appeared to be woven of metal or some
  kind of metal-coated fiber and formed a latticework appearance around their
  necks. Beneath each collar dangled a silver tag. Emily reached out and grasped
  Jane's, reading &ldquo;Jane Ridley&rdquo; on one side. Flipping it over she
  read &ldquo;Property of Robert and Megan Hopewell.&rdquo; A shudder raced through
  her body as she realized that hers must be the same. Jane reached out and read
  Emily's tag, the only difference being that the front read &ldquo;Emily Barclay.&rdquo; An
  identical shudder went through Jane's body. 
&ldquo;Do you like them?&rdquo; asked Meg who had stepped between them, wrapping
  her arms around their naked waists. 
&ldquo;They're beautiful, Me&hellip; I mean Mistress,&rdquo; replied Jane. 
&ldquo;And very functional too,&rdquo; said Meg. &ldquo;They are kind of
  like choke collars for girls. I guarantee that, while on a leash, you will
  not be resisting much.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Come over here with me now, girls,&rdquo; said Meg as she turned them
  and led them to the couch. &ldquo;Kneel now. We want to go over a few things
  with you.&rdquo; Both girls immediately lowered themselves to their knees.
  Jane had no idea what was going on in Emily's mind but hers was filled with
  excitement about the new experience and an acute fear about what Emily would
  decide in a week. It all seemed surrealistic to her that she now had an undetermined
  period of slavery ahead of her but that she found her incarceration exciting.
  Emily had no idea what was going through Jane's mind but hers was entertained
  by a combination of absolute thrill tempered by severe doubts and dreads. &ldquo;What
  have I gotten myself into?&rdquo; 
&ldquo;You already know how to address us,&rdquo; Bob spoke. &ldquo;I trust
  that you will always do that properly. We also expect you to be posed appropriately.
  Many owners require that their slaves memorize dozens of positions and poses.
  We require only two: one for kneeling and one for standing. Meg will demonstrate
  your positions.&rdquo; 
Meg slid off the couch and knelt on the floor. &ldquo;Knees should be spread
  shoulder width. You should be kneeling upright unless you are told to relax.
  Then you can rest your bottoms on your heels. Your wrists should be crossed
  behind your back unless you are bound in some way that prevents that. And your
  head should be held high. We only accept proud slaves. You should always look
  us in the eyes. You will meet some of our friends who are offended by a slave
  who does not cast her eyes down but always remember that you are our property
  and you will obey our rules.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Friends?!?!?!&rdquo; thought Emily. &ldquo;Nobody said anything about
  bringing others into this. Maybe I really have gotten myself in over my head.&rdquo; 
The two girls adjusted their positions to emulate Meg. Meanwhile, she arose
  and started walking around her two naked charges with a riding crop, swatting
  a bottom that stuck back too far or lifting a chin slightly. &ldquo;Simple
  elegance is what we are looking for here. We want you available and exposed
  but elegant.&rdquo; 
Next, Jane and Emily learned their standing position. This one was also relatively
  simple. Their feet were to be shoulder width apart with their toes pointed
  forward. Heads high. Fingers laced behind their necks. Elbows back and in line
  with the backs of their heads. Chests arched forward as if making an offering
  of their breasts. They both mastered this position and were left in it as Meg
  sat back down beside Bob. &ldquo;When you enter a room, you are always to present
  yourself to us. Generally, you will present yourself standing. But if we are
  seated and occupied in some way, such as talking with someone or working, then
  you should kneel before us or at our sides, whichever is most appropriate.
  And you should try to alternate so that we both get to enjoy both of you. Neither
  of us has a favorite and we intend to keep it that way. We expect that neither
  of you forms a favorite. You are simply property.&rdquo; 
They learned other rules that morning. They were expected to continue to
  exercise. As Meg put it, &ldquo;we expect our property to be well maintained.&rdquo; They
  would arise early and groom each other in time to be able to awaken their owners
  for breakfast. Lips and tongues were the preferred alarm clocks, they learned.
  They would have both inside and outside chores, which would be assigned to
  them daily. They were never to leave the house without permission and there
  was an alarm that would sound if they tried. They would be severely punished
  if they did try. Lastly, they were to keep themselves shaved. This was the
  last rule before the end of the meeting and then Meg led them to their quarters. 
Chapter 8: A New Kind of Life 
Their quarters were not the Spartan kind if arrangement that most people
  would expect. Instead, it was move like a luxury suite with a king-size bed
  and a spacious, well-appointed bathroom, complete with bidet, spa and sauna. &ldquo;Almost
  like a harem,&rdquo; Jane thought. They were left there to prepare themselves
  and were given an hour before they were expected to present themselves. 
&ldquo;Okay, spread &lsquo;em, sis&rdquo; said Emily as she picked up a pair
  of scissors and a razor. Jane just shook her head in disbelief again as she
  had so many times in the previous weeks. 
&ldquo;What are we doing?&rdquo; asked Jane. &ldquo;Maybe it's time to gracefully
  back out and apologize for inconveniencing them.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;I'm not sure that's possible now, pip. I think that, for the next
  week, we are slave sisters. At this point, I would release you if I could.
  But I don't own you at the moment. Now do you want me to shave you or do you
  want to do it yourself?&rdquo; 
&ldquo;What's with the shaving stuff?&rdquo; asked an indignant Jane. &ldquo;It
  will make us look like adolescents!&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Trust me, babe,&rdquo; said Emily as she grasped Jane's breasts and
  squeezed, &ldquo;you will never be mistaken for an adolescent.&rdquo; 
Jane finally succumbed after much sighing and arguing and bitching. Eventually,
  she perched her bottom on the counter and let Emily denude her sex. Then she
  returned the favor by taking the scissors to Emily's thatch. After several
  minutes of clipping, she invited Emily to look, who saw that her pubic hair
  had been trimmed in the shape of a question mark. 
&ldquo;Very funny,&rdquo; Emily said sarcastically. &ldquo;Are you making
  a statement of come kind?&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Only that we have no idea what we are doing here or why we agreed
  to anything this crazy.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Well, to set your mind at ease, you didn't agree to anything. I was
  the only volunteer here. Now finish up.&rdquo; Jane finished snipping and then
  used the razor to make her friend's sex as smooth as a baby's bottom. She finished
  by giving the naked mound a quick kiss. 
&ldquo;It does look sexy on you,&rdquo; conceded Jane. &ldquo;And I guess
  you're right about me not looking like an adolescent. It just all seems so
  strange.&rdquo; 
The two girls showered together, blew each other's hair dry and then combed
  it out until it shined. &ldquo;Having a slave sister will make this a whole
  lot more fun and enjoyable,&rdquo; said Emily. &ldquo;Thanks for doing this
  for me.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;It's not as if I had any choice in the matter,&rdquo; giggled Jane
  as she turned her chest back and forth playfully letting her nipples duel with
  Emily's. &ldquo;And you're right. It could be fun. And I already know that
  it will be different. But don't you dare sign that second line. Or if you do,
  make sure I'm free and away from here.&rdquo; 
It was only noon when the two slaves stepped back into the living
    room again. They were surprised to find it empty and then started moving
    around the house in search of their owners. Finally, they spied them sitting
    on the porch and Emily reached for the doorknob. 
   
&ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; whispered Jane. &ldquo;We're not allowed to leave the
  house without permission.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Well we were told to report back to them within an hour and time's
  almost up!&rdquo; hissed Emily. 
&ldquo;It must be a test of some kind then. I do know we'll get in trouble
  though if we open that door.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Well what do you suggest Miss Perfect Little Slavegirl?&rdquo; asked
  Emily as she stood with her hands on her hips and her head cocked to the side. 
&ldquo;Wellllll,&rdquo; replied Jane in an exaggerated tone, &ldquo;my previous
  owner, who shall remain unnamed, taught me to always follow instructions. Failure
  to do so was generally followed by a whipping here, a spanking there, confinement
  everywhere. I recommend that we knock on the window.&rdquo; 
Jane's little dramatic performance brought both girls to stitches and they
  were laughing so hard that they could not control themselves. Emily accidentally
  hit the window with an elbow before they fell into each others arms to support
  one another. The tap on the window caught the attention of Bob and Emily who
  both got up from their chairs to see what was going on. They peered through
  the glass and saw the two naked girls holding on to each other and laughing
  hysterically. 
&ldquo;This could be a challenge,&rdquo; observed Bob. 
&ldquo;But it looks like it will be a fun challenge, dear,&rdquo; replied
  Meg. 
&ldquo;Ahem.&rdquo; 
Both girls let go of each other and stood up straight when they realized
  they had been discovered. &ldquo;What do you think you are doing?&rdquo; asked
  Bob in a cold voice. 
&ldquo;We're sorry Bo&hellip; Master,&rdquo; replied Emily. &ldquo;We were
  trying to follow instructions but got distracted.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;So I see,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Meg, bring them out to the post.&rdquo; This
  resulted in their first whipping and they each made a vow to themselves to
  do everything possible to avoid a second one. 
Meg took the two girls to a pole in the yard that had rings embedded about
  six feet off the ground. Each girl's wrists were tied to the rings and then
  Bob stepped forward snapping a long, ugly whip in the air. The first swing
  of his arm sent the tip of the whip crashing into Jane's bottom causing her
  to shriek and jump around. This was quickly followed by another whistle of
  the whip through the air and Emily was the one to shriek. Since their hands
  were fastened at the level of the tops of their heads, there was a lot of room
  for them to dance around and try to avoid the whip. But they quickly learned
  that this was a mixed blessing. While it gave them the illusion of being able
  to avoid the whip, it actually made them more vulnerable. Jane was the first
  to figure this out when the whip wrapped around her chest and snapped at one
  of her nipples. She quickly pressed her body flat against the pole to try to
  save her tender breasts from more abuse. Emily eventually figured it out also
  when the whip circled her hip and snapped against her newly shaven mound. Soon
  both girls were hugging the pole and kissing one another to try to provide
  solace and comfort. 
&ldquo;I think that's enough,&rdquo; said Bob as he dropped the whip across
  their shoulders. &ldquo;Have you learned anything?&rdquo; 
&ldquo;I learned that I don't like to be whipped, Master,&rdquo; replied
  Jane quickly. 
&ldquo;That's a good lesson to learn,&rdquo; said Bob as he stroked the side
  of Jane's face. &ldquo;And did you learn anything, Emily?&rdquo; 
&ldquo;I learned that I prefer being a top,&rdquo; she said emphatically. 
&ldquo;We'll see about that,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;You have another
    week to sort that out. In the meantime, there's weeding to do.&rdquo; And
    for the next three hours, two naked girls knelt in the garden beds pulling
    up weeds. They had not been told to be silent but neither said a word. 
   
It was mid-afternoon when they finished. They were told to shower, which
  they did under an outside showerhead at the barn and then were allowed to relax
  by the pool. &ldquo;You'll get nice and tanned this week,&rdquo; promised Meg. &ldquo;But
  we need to even it out. Your backs got a lot of attention today. &ldquo;Tomorrow,
  we'll focus on your fronts.&rdquo; 
The girls helped each other apply tanning oil to their bodies and then laid
  down on their backs in comfortable chaise lounges. Jane was sound asleep within
  minutes, leaving Emily alone in thought. Emily watched Jane's beautiful breasts
  rise and fall with each breath before letting her eyes roam lower. Despite
  not wanting to have her sex shaved, Emily had to admit that it created a stunning
  appearance, especially when Jane's body was oiled and glistening as it was
  now. 
Emily decided that she should take stock of her situation each day so that
  the decision would be easier at the end of the week. So far, the decision was
  easy. She had been shaved against her will. She had been whipped. And she had
  performed three hours of strenuous labor in the gardens. &ldquo;No problem,&rdquo; she
  thought. &ldquo;I can deal with a week of this but after that I'm taking my
  slavegirl and heading home.&rdquo; Soon, she too drifted off to sleep. 
That evening, Jane was selected to serve the meal. She was dressed in high
  heels, a lacy maid's cap, and a tiny laced apron that tied around her waist
  but did very little to hide anything. In fact, if anything, it made her appear
  even more naked. 
Emily was doing serving of a different nature. Her hands had been bound behind
  her back and she was placed under the table. Her job was to move back and forth
  between Bob and Meg and to use her lips and tongue to pleasure them. And she
  was warned that if they did not each climax at least once then she would be
  punished. She took her job very seriously and by the end of the main course,
  had coaxed an orgasm out of Meg. She could hear dishes being cleared and hoped
  that her owners would be having dessert. Thankfully, she later heard Jane's
  heels clicking back into the room and heard the clattering of dishes as Jane
  served dessert. She redoubled her efforts with her head bobbing up and down,
  her lips and cheeks sucking, and her tongue furiously bathing and teasing the
  cock inside her mouth. 
Emily started to panic as she heard dishes being cleared again and knew that
  she was running out of time. &ldquo;If only I had my hands,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;I'd
  have him orbiting the earth by now.&rdquo; But she didn't have her hands and
  her jaw was aching from all of the strain of continually sucking. Plus Bob
  did not have a small cock. It was both wide in girth and long, which only added
  to the strain. When she heard coffee cups being refilled, she knew that she
  had little time left. In a desperation move, she let the cock slide from her
  lips and ducked lower to suck Bob's balls into her mouth. These were larger
  than normal too, making it difficult to do much with them but she was able
  to roll them back and forth a bit and was able to flutter her tongue over the
  tight sac that held them. She then released them and dove back onto the cock
  taking it as deep as she could into her mouth. But she had only moved her lips
  up and down a few times when she heard a chair scraping across the floor. 
&ldquo;Shit!&rdquo; she thought as Meg pushed back and stood. Then the cock
  was pulled from her lips as Bob also pushed back. 
&ldquo;Nice work with the balls, pet,&rdquo; said Bob as he pulled his pants
  up and tucked the balls in. &ldquo;But you failed your test.&rdquo; 
That night, Jane was taken to bed by the couple where she serviced them and
  was serviced in return until all three passed out from exhaustion. A forlorn
  Emily gazed out of a cage in the corner of the Hopewell's bedroom with a large
  penis gag stuffed into her mouth. She could only look on sadly as she watched
  her slavegirl being ravished by her new owners. 
Chapter 9: Ponies or mules? 
&ldquo;Move along girls,&rdquo; shouted Meg as the whip snapped above two
  naked bodies. Thankfully, she was just using the whip to make the sound as
  the two girls used every muscle that they could muster to push the plow through
  the earth. This was inhumane in the minds of each of the girls. Huge horses
  and oxen had difficulty with this task. But every time they protested or let
  up in their efforts, the whip would crack across their backs or bottoms. 
They had only been at work for about twenty minutes but it had seemed like
  hours. Each girl had been blindfolded prior to the task &ldquo;to let them
  concentrate on their chores&rdquo; and had been guided by a combination of
  whip snaps and tugs on the bits that they wore in their mouths. This was no
  decorative or elaborate dressage pony day. Today, they were more like field
  animals with their wrists cuffed to the handles of the plow. They pushed and
  they pushed with sweat pouring off their bodies, being stopped frequently and
  redirected to plow in another direction. 
Eventually, their ordeal ended and they were unfastened one at a time, only
  to have their wrists bound behind their backs and led to the shower by the
  barn. A stiff brush, some soap and plenty of cold water cleansed them and they
  stood shivering and trying to complain in the yard. The bits, however, rendered
  their complaints useless. 
Finally, their blindfolds were removed and they were led back to the land
  that they had filled. They were shocked to see that it was just a small garden
  plot. After all of their work and struggles, they were sure that they had plowed
  up half the county. 
&ldquo;Would my pretty ponies like to relax for a bit?&rdquo; asked Meg as
  she stood in front of them and bounced a breast from each girl in her palms.
  Both girls nodded vigorously and they were rewarded by being led to the lounge
  chairs again. This time, however, they were lashed down to the chairs with
  their legs spread and their hands cuffed to the top of the chair. Meg stayed
  with them for a long while and chatted as she rubbed the oil onto their fronts. 
&ldquo;Tomorrow, you can transplant the seedlings. I think that the two of
  you did a fine job with the tilling,&rdquo; she said as her hands finished
  rubbing the oil onto Emily's face, neck and shoulders. She poured more oil
  into her palms and then coated Emily's breasts, taking plenty of time to tease
  and tweak the nipples to stiffness. &ldquo;We have to protect these,&rdquo; she
  said as she wrapped her fingers around the base of each breast and squeezed.
  These belong to me now, you know.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;When she finished coating each girl, she removed their bits and then
  knelt in at the foot of each recliner, leaning over and flickering her tongue
  on each clit until the girl climaxed. Emily was rewarded first, followed by
  Jane. Each girl was asleep by the time Meg gathered up the discarded bridles
  and the bottle of oil and headed in to the house. 
&ldquo;How are they coming along?&rdquo; asked Bob as he hugged his wife
  and kissed her lipsthat were coated with the juices of the two girls. 
&ldquo;I think they're progressing nicely,&rdquo; she responded as she pressed
  her body against his and returned the kiss. &ldquo;I don't think they know
  which way is up at the moment. And I'm sure they're both wishing they hadn't
  done this. We should talk about how the rest of the week should go. But I'm
  hopeful that we will own both by week's end.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;We need to lighten up on Emily, I think,&rdquo; offered Bob. &ldquo;After
  all, she's the one who has to make the decision.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Maybe we lighten up on both of them tomorrow. A day of bondage and
  harem dreams. And the party should tell us a lot.&rdquo; Meg had called a number
  of their special friends and three couples had accepted the invitation for
  the next evening. It was actually two couples and a single female. But the
  single female said that she would bring along a boyfriend who would be tolerant
  of the lifestyle. 
After being awakened, the two slavegirls were taken to their quarters and
  were given three hours to themselves. This was an unexpected luxury and the
  girls could hardly contain themselves. They were locked into their suite but
  were otherwise free. Emily took the lead and dragged Jane to the bathroom where
  a bath was quickly drawn. Emily laid backing the tub and Jane laid back against
  Emily. The older slave reached around her slave sister and cupped the full
  breasts, letting her thumbs strum up and down over the stiff nipples. &ldquo;I
  had the wildest dreams out there!&rdquo; proclaimed Emily. &ldquo;I'm sooooo
  horny! I'm going to fuck you &lsquo;til the cows come home.&rdquo; 
Jane laughed. &ldquo;Must have been some dream!&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Picture yourself impaled by a HUGE cock jutting out from my crotch.
  I wish I had bought us that strap-on. I want to fuck you until you are babbling
  incoherently.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Mmmmm, sounds nice,&rdquo; said Jane as she turned her head and kissed
  the inner swell of Emily's breast. &ldquo;Guess you'll just have to settle
  for tongue action though.&rdquo; 
Chapter 10: A Different Maid 
That evening, roles were reversed. This time, Emily was wearing the tiny
  apron and it was Jane beneath the table. Both girls had a glow about them from
  their time frolicking along. This did not go unnoticed by their owners who
  smiled knowingly at each other. 
Jane had learned from Emily's mistake from the previous night. She started
  with Bob's cock, getting it nice and hard but moved to his balls letting her
  tongue dance over them as she suckled and rolled them. She found a sweet spot
  when she pushed her tongue between them, separating the two large orbs, causing
  Bob to stiffen and emit a grown. She vowed to remember that trick when she
  returned but she knew that she needed to get started with Meg. She let the
  balls slip from her mouth and gave the tip of the waggling cock a kiss slipping
  her tongue into the tiny slit at the end. Another groan could be clearly heard
  and she felt as if she had hit pay dirt. 
Moving to Meg was more difficult than she expected with her hands bound behind
  her back. Bob had made her bondage even stricter than Emily's had been when
  he lashed her elbows together. This caused the muscles and joints in her shoulders
  to strain but hade the effect of forcing her chest out. &ldquo;Goodness,&rdquo; Meg
  had exclaimed when Bob had finished with his knotsmanship, &ldquo;She looks
  like she's all breast.&rdquo; Shuffling beneath the table, crouched down with
  her shoulders straining painfully, Jane almost toppled forward. But at last
  she reached Emily's parted thighs. 
Instead of starting with her tongue, Jane kissed Meg up and down her sex
  until the petals opened. Then, she sucked on labia into her mouth and nibbled
  lightly up and down its length before repeating this action with its sister.
  Soon, Meg was quivering and it was only then that Jane curled her tongue and
  speared it into Meg's depths. Jane heard a gasp and thrust her tongue in several
  more times. Finally, it was time for the assault on the clit. Again, Jane chose
  not to start with her tongue. Instead, she pursed her lips and sucked the little
  nub into her mouth alternating with suction and release to let the clit pulse
  in and out of her lips. Meg was visibly writhing and started moaning at this
  point but Jane did not relent. She kept up her suckling until Meg's body was
  shaking. When she felt Meg's fingers entwine in her hair and felt Meg trying
  to lift her face from her crotch, Jane knew that victory was close. This is
  when she brought her tongue in to play and a flickers was all it took to send
  Meg over the edge. 
Jane kissed the slick sex before starting her journey back to her master.
  She had to stifle a giggle, though when she heard Meg say, &ldquo;Where did
  she learn that? That ought to be patented or something. Maybe even outlawed.
  Em, I thought you told me that she was strictly hetero.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;She was, Mistress. I guess she's just a fast learner.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;I think she might be a magician,&rdquo; retorted Meg as she slumped
  in her chair. 
Emily also had to stifle a giggle at Meg's comment. Jane meanwhile was starting
  her renewed attack on Bob. She started by blowing lightly on the cock up and
  down the length of the shaft. Then she ran her tongue on each side of the cock,
  wetting it, before blowing on it again. The cock twitched and bobbed in anticipation,
  providing encouragement to Jane. 
So far, she had avoided the head other than to lightly blow on it. Now she
  returned to the balls, sucking in only one this time. Having one of the huge
  egg-shaped globes in her mouth was more manageable for her and allowed her
  tongue to play over its surface more. She pressed her face hard into Bob's
  groin and then slowly pulled her head back stretching the ball away from Bob
  as her tongue painted circles around the thing. Eventually, she released it
  letting it bounce back into place before repeating her act on its brother. 
Not knowing how much time remained, she decided to get serious with the cock.
  She opened her mouth wide and leaned forward encircling the shaft but not touching
  it. The only thing that Bob could feel was the warmth of Jane's breath caressing
  his sensitive member until it finally bumped into the back of her throat. As
  soon as that happened, Jane clamped her teeth tightly around the cock, grasping
  it near the base. She would have preferred to catch it at the base but had
  never been able to bring herself to deep throating anyone. She started sucking
  on it as she drew her lips up the shaft, feeling her cheeks collapsing inward
  from the heavy suction. Then she moved her head forward and back quickly letting
  just the bulbous head slide in and out of her mouth as her tongue bathed it
  and teased the little hole at the tip. 
She would lunge forward occasionally, taking the cock as deep into her mouth
  as possible but would always return to focus most of her efforts on the head.
  She was only able to lunge forward three times, however, before the shaft twitched
  and her mouth was filled with salty, warm fluid. Another owner was soon slumped
  in a chair. 
After he recovered, Bob reached down and pulled Jane out from under the table
  helping her to her feet. &ldquo;Where did you learn all of that, girl?&rdquo; 
&ldquo;From Emily, Master,&rdquo; she replied. 
&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Meg jumped in. &ldquo;It seems that our Emily has more
  talents than we suspected.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Very well done, pet,&rdquo; smiled Bob as he gave each prominent nipple
  a squeeze. Then he turned his attention to Emily. &ldquo;And thank you for
  being such an excellent instructor.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;You are welcome, Master.&rdquo; 
Jane's wrists remained tied behind her back but at least her elbows were
  released after dinner, which provided her with greatly appreciated relief.
  Both girls were taken to bed with the Hopewells that night. Emily was to be
  the sex toy this evening and she was sandwiched between Bob and Meg and ravished
  for hours. Jane had a more functional role. She was bound across the head of
  the bed and became everyone's pillow. Bob rested his head on the girl's thighs.
  Emily slept on Jane's belly. And Meg enjoyed a good night's sleep using Jane's
  full, firm breasts to support her head. And she couldn't help herself from
  playing with them whenever she awoke. Unfortunately for Jane, Meg was a light
  sleeper and Jane was awakened numerous times to find lips wrapped around a
  nipple suckling it. 
Chapter 11: Harem Dreams and Bondage 
The only chore for the girls, the next day, was transplanting some seedlings
  that had been started in the barn when the weather was too cold for them. Now
  that it was warm each day, the two girls busied themselves by giving the plants
  a new home in their freshly tilled garden. It took less than two hours to create
  rows of tomato plants and herbs. 
Meg watched them while they toiled, marveling at their sleek but decidedly
  feminine forms. When they finished, she beckoned them to her and they quickly
  knelt at her feet. &ldquo;You have been such good girls,&rdquo; she said as
  she reached out to hold a breast from each slave in her hands. &ldquo;What
  would you like to do for the rest of the day?&rdquo; 
They looked at her, perplexed, unsure of how to answer. Then they looked
  at each other hoping for some guidance. &ldquo;We don't know, Mistress. Whatever
  you would like us to do, I suppose,&rdquo; replied Emily. 
Meg smiled and gave Emily's breast a squeeze. &ldquo;Yes. Such good girls.&rdquo; 
Emily and Jane conferred for a few moments, glancing nervously at Meg now
  and then. They wanted to make the most of their ability to set their future
  but seemed unable to come to a decision for the longest time. 
&ldquo;We would like to swim and sun by the pool, Mistress,&rdquo; started
  Emily after they had been in conference for a long while. 
&ldquo;And we, I, would like to go for a run,&rdquo; interjected Jane. 
And we, I, would like to have some time in the afternoon to ourselves,&rdquo; finished
  Emily. 
&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; proclaimed Meg. &ldquo;My girls shall have their wishes.
  I assume that you want to end up in your room for your time together, so where
  would you like to start? Pool or run?&rdquo; 
After a bit more bickering between themselves, they decided on the run first,
  followed by the pool, which would let them cool down and relax before heading
  off to the relative protection of their room. 
Meg attached new collars to their necks, which she told them would send electric
  shocks through them if they left the property. They believed her and stayed
  within the boundaries before returning to cool down and sun by the pool. It
  was a luxury for a slavegirl. Eventually, they returned to their rooms, bathed
  and enjoyed some wonderful lovemaking before falling asleep in each other's
  arms. 
Meg looked down at her two pets seeing them as a tangled mass of intertwined
  arms and legs with their lips pressed together. The brown lush hair atop both
  heads fanned across the pillows as the two girls slept and she almost felt
  guilty about awakening them. But she had plans, even though the two slaves
  were unaware of the upcoming events. With some reluctance, she raised the crop
  and swung it down to catch Emily's smooth bottom only to lift it again quickly
  to do the same to Jane. 
&ldquo;Up girls!&rdquo; commanded Meg. &ldquo;We have a busy night ahead
  of us. I think a bath with this bath oil would be in order. No makeup. I want
  you both with a French braid. And don't bother dressing. I will be back in
  one hour to collect you.&rdquo; With that, she left, locking the door behind
  her. 
&ldquo;What's up?&rdquo; asked Jane. 
&ldquo;How am I supposed to know?&rdquo; responded Emily. &ldquo;But we better
  get moving if we're going to get those braids done.&rdquo; 
Fifty five minutes later, they had completed their assignments and were standing
  together in front of the mirror. &ldquo;We really do look like a matched pair,&rdquo; observed
  Jane. 
&ldquo;Hardly,&rdquo; replied Emily. You are more top heavy than me.&rdquo; 
Chapter 12: The Boxes Unchecked 
Meg returned on time and attached leashes to both of her girls &ldquo;We
  have guests tonight,&rdquo; she said, causing each girl to tense and pull back
  only to feel their collars tighten around their necks. &ldquo;I expect both
  of you to behave and to make us proud.&rdquo; 
Each girl had her wrists bound behind her back and each girl had her elbows
  lashed together also. &ldquo;Battle of the Bosoms,&rdquo; thought Emily as
  she glanced down and saw her breasts protruding as invitingly as Jane's. Then,
  the reluctant slaves were led down the hall toward the voices in the living
  room. They each wanted to die when they emerged into the room to find Bob talking
  with three elegantly dressed couples. 
&ldquo;I present to you my finest catches yet: Emily and Jane. Feel free
  to enjoy them, but please acquaint yourselves with their tags first.&rdquo; Bob
  stood proudly beside his two catches and then patted Emily's bottom, urging
  her forward into the small crowd. 
&ldquo;Oh my gawwwwd!&rdquo; thought Emily as she saw every eye on her roaming
  over her nudity. Jane was urged forward a moment later and quickly the two
  slaves found themselves circled by the guests and being poked, prodded and
  pinched. 
&ldquo;One of the women, an attractive redhead in her mid-forties, reached
  forward and clasped the tag dangling from Jane's collar. &ldquo;Ridley,&rdquo; she
  observed. &ldquo;I think I know your parents.&rdquo; Jane's eyes went wide
  in fear as she heard the words and wondered how she would ever explain her
  current predicament to her conservative mother and father. &ldquo;Don't worry,&rdquo; the
  woman whispered as she tweaked Jane's nipple. &ldquo;It'll be our secret.&rdquo; 
Then the woman turned to Bob. &ldquo;Short. Simple. But very effective, Bob.
  It gets the message across.&rdquo; 
Bob smiled. &ldquo;Thank you, Roz.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Which one gives better head?&rdquo; asked a man who had claimed Emily's
  left breast. 
&ldquo;They are new enough that I haven't had a lot of time to evaluate them,&rdquo; replied
  Bob. &ldquo;But so far, I'd give them both A+.&rdquo; 
Emily breathed a sigh of relief at those words. She was afraid that he was
  going to reveal her earlier failure. She was also being very distracted by
  all of the hands moving over her body. It seemed that no part of her was left
  untouched. Even her bottom cheeks were spread for inspection back there. 
&ldquo;How are they with anal?&rdquo; asked the man who was currently holding
  Emily's cheeks apart. 
&ldquo;Haven't gotten around to it yet,&rdquo; was Bob's answer. &ldquo;Keep
  in mind we've only owned them for a couple of days.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;We'll have to fix that tonight,&rdquo; was the response. 
&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; was Bob's noncommittal reply. 
&ldquo;Prime property,&rdquo; said a black-haired woman in her mid-twenties. &ldquo;Are
  you planning to show them?&rdquo; 
&ldquo;We'll have to see, Liz,&rdquo; answered Meg. &ldquo;We haven't quite
  decided what to do with them. They sort of dropped into our laps and we haven't
  had a chance to make any plans.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;I'm sure they'd be winners,&rdquo; Liz went on. &ldquo;There's a show
  tomorrow night if you want to give them a trial run.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Oh really?&rdquo; said Meg, musingly. &ldquo;I had no idea. We might
  just have to do that.&rdquo; 
Emily just about jumped out of her skin as a finger stabbed into her sex
  followed by a second and then a third digit. Emily looked down to see the blonde
  woman in front of her with three fingers disappearing inside of her. 
&ldquo;How is she with a fist?&rdquo; asked the blonde. 
Meg shrugged her shoulders. &ldquo;Don't know, June. Haven't gotten around
  to that either.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Mind if I see?&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Be my guest,&rdquo; said Meg as she moved around to watch. 
Again, Emily's eyes opened wide in surprise as she realized what was about
  to happen. She wanted to scream and run but knew that she would be punished
  severely for that. Instead, all that she could do is look down in disbelief
  as a fourth finger joined the first three. 
Two of the men grasped Emily's upper arms to steady her and to hold her in
  place as June withdrew her glistening fingers. Then, in horror, Emily saw the
  woman tuck her thumb against her palm and start to slowly move the assembly
  in and out as a little bit more of the hand disappeared inside of her with
  each push. 
&ldquo;Thankfully, she's very wet,&rdquo; exclaimed June. 
&ldquo;They are both like that all the time,&rdquo; responded Meg. &ldquo;It's
  the most amazing thing. I call them my matched pair.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Well this part of the match is going to waste over here,&rdquo; said
  a man who was currently inspecting Jane's bottom. 
&ldquo;Okay, Ted,&rdquo; laughed Bob. &ldquo;Go for it.&rdquo; 
Ted wasted no time and very quickly Jane found herself bent over the back
  of an upholstered chair. She heard a zipper being lowered and knew that her
  upthrust bottom was likely going to be too tempting of a target to resist.
  Within moments, she felt a large shaft impaling her sex and let out a gasp
  at the sudden intrusion. Thankfully, it had been her sex that had been entered
  instead of her bottom. 
By this time, Emily was panting and groaning as June's knuckles were starting
  to spread her wide. She felt as if she were going to be split in two from the
  intrusion but the hand seemed to make a little more progress with each thrust.
  June pushed a little harder causing Emily to let out a long, low groan but
  allowing the hand to pop inside of her. 
&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; murmured June as her fingers started dancing over the
  walls inside of Jane's sex. &ldquo;So soft. So velvety. So warm and wet in
  here.&rdquo; 
Emily felt her body perspiring and felt her body trembling as the fingers
  moved over every inch inside of her. Then a finger found her cervix and started
  slowly pressing against it. At first, Emily felt the pressure. Then she felt
  a little discomfort. Finally she felt pain as the insistent finger kept pushing
  causing Emily to rise up onto her toes to try to escape. 
&ldquo;Come back here, little one,&rdquo; laughed June as she reached up,
  grabbing Emily's nipple and pulling down hard on it. Reluctantly, Emily returned
  to standing on her heels but then groaned again as the finger was successful
  in penetrating into her womb and in sending pain through her body. 
At the very same moment, Ted had pulled out of Jane and repositioned his
  glistening cock at her little rosebud, pushing forward until the tip of his
  cock opened her bottom and slipped inside. 
&ldquo;Oh my gawwwwddd!&rdquo; groaned each girl simultaneously as they felt
  the new attacks on their bodies. 
June seemed content to leave just the tip of her finger within the cervix
  but Ted was not going to be satisfied with just partial penetration. He worked
  his hips forward and back until his cock was fully encased in Jane's bowels. 
June decided to toy with her captive a little more and leaned forward letting
  her tongue flutter over Emily's exposed and erect clit. Emily's mind was totally
  confused at this time by the erotic thrills shooting from her clit combined
  with the pain and cramping from her penetrated cervix. 
Jane was not confused at all, however. She just plain didn't like being fucked
  in the ass. She grasped at the arms of the chair and tried to pull herself
  forward in a desperate attempt to escape the abuse she was receiving. She was
  stopped by Ted who grasped her hips tightly and held her where she was. 
&ldquo;Move her back a bit, big boy,&rdquo; Jane heard Liz say. &ldquo;Give
  me some room to get in there and play. I'll give her something nice to focus
  on while she gets used to that cock.&rdquo; Liz reached under Jane's belly
  and slid her hand down until she found the slavegirl's wet sex. Her fingers
  quickly claimed the slippery clit and she started strumming it as her free
  hand caressed Jane's back. &ldquo;You are a beautiful little pet,&rdquo; she
  cooed into Jane's ear. &ldquo;Just let yourself go with it. Stop fighting it
  and it can even be pleasurable.&rdquo; 
Jane whimpered and buried her face in the cushion but felt her body already
  starting to respond to Liz' ministrations. June finally withdrew her finger
  allowing Emily to breathe a sigh of relief. Now she only had to deal with the
  fullness caused by having a hand buried in her sex. June started to flex her
  fingers and then draw them together in a fist as she also started to rotate
  her arm. The flickering tongue also remained engaged in it's toils moving Emily
  closer and closer to an orgasm. 
Jane turned her head to look at her captors. Ted's eyes were closed and his
  face was red as he pounded in and out of her bottom. He had the look of someone
  close to climax and it could not come soon enough as far as Jane was concerned.
  Liz smiled back at her and leaned forward to kiss her as she kept her fingers
  moving lightly over the girl's clit. This caused Jane to blush as she realized
  that this captor was the same age as herself but was very clearly in a position
  of dominance over her. Nevertheless, she appreciated the tenderness being provided
  by Liz and returned the kiss enjoying the soft, lush lips against her arm. 
Emily was visibly trembling at this point and the tight muscles of her belly
  were quivering from June's nonstop attentions. The fingers inside of her moved
  randomly now, sometimes stroking, sometimes flexing, always twisting in a new
  direction. Finally, she could hold back no longer and the orgasm swept through
  her body. She felt as if the top of her head was going to blow off from the
  intensity of the climax and, thankfully, the two men were holding her arms
  or she would have toppled over. 
Ted climaxed at the same time as Emily, letting out a grunt as he filled
  Jane's bowels with his sperm. Luckily for Jane, he softened quickly and slid
  out of her bottom. This left her as the only whimpering soul in the room and
  all eyes were on her. Liz' free hand continued to stroke and caress the naked
  girl as the other hand tried to coax out an orgasm. It did not take much more
  time and Liz was rewarded by a shuddering body and a muffled groan as Jane
  once again buried her face in the cushions. 
&ldquo;That was quite a demonstration,&rdquo; observed Bob. &ldquo;I'm sure
  that my girls have learned a thing or two. Let's relax and enjoy ourselves
  while they gather their wits.&rdquo; The two men draped Emily's body over the
  back of the chair beside Jane's and they all took seats, frequently glancing
  over to the near-comatose slaves. 
&ldquo;I still think you should show them,&rdquo; offered Liz. &ldquo;I'd
  be happy to take them tomorrow night if you'd like.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;I'm sure you would,&rdquo; smiled Bob. &ldquo;And I'm sure you'd like
  to keep them.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Oh I would,&rdquo; said Liz as her face lit up. &ldquo;Are they for
  sale?&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Sadly, they aren't,&rdquo; replied Bob. &ldquo;At least not at the
  moment. There are currently some contractual limitations to our ownership.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;But I could challenge for them, couldn't I?&rdquo; said Liz hopefully. &ldquo;If
  we made a prize bet and I won, wouldn't you have to give them to me?&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Yes, I suppose,&rdquo; said Bob. &ldquo;But you would have to put
  up a prize yourself that you could lose.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;That's why it's called betting,&rdquo; grinned Liz. 
Bob sighed. &ldquo;You may challenge if you wish. What prize would you offer?&rdquo; 
&ldquo;My Edward. For a week. Against those two for a week.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;One male for two females?&rdquo; asked Bob. &ldquo;That's not even
  close to equal.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Liz. &ldquo;But Edward is trained and your two aren't.&rdquo; This
  left Bob shaking his head in refusal. &ldquo;Hmmmm. Let me think,&rdquo; Liz
  went on as she thought. &ldquo;How about my Edward for those two? And I would
  throw myself in on top.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Now that might be interesting,&rdquo; Meg chirped in. 
Bob was not sure about all of this. He knew that Meg truly loved having boy
  toys to play with but he wasn't at all sure what he would do with three slavegirls
  at once. He had to admit that he had frequently fantasized about having Liz
  naked and kneeling at his feet. She was just as stunning as Jane and Emily
  and, other than for hair color, would also be part of the matched set. All
  three girls were about the same height. All were large-breasted with tiny waists.
  And all three had truly beautiful faces. But how could he enjoy all three lovelies
  at once? 
Then there was the possibility that he could lose the challenge. In that
  case, Emily and Jane would be out of his hands for a week. He could still finish
  off the remaining term of their slavery after they were returned to him because
  it had become common practice that &ldquo;challenge time&rdquo; did not count
  toward &ldquo;contract time,&rdquo; although slaves typically never learned
  that until they had been lost in a challenge. He was most concerned about how
  it might affect Emily's decision at the end of the contract. He had been becoming
  increasingly confident that she would commit herself, and therefore Jane, to
  slavery or at least extend her trial period. 
Being lost to Liz, however, might scare Emily off. For one thing, it might
  infuriate her that she ended up spending two weeks in slavery instead of the
  one she agreed to. For another thing, he would lose control of how she was
  brought to the decision. Currently, he could manage her time in slavery and
  seduce her into committing her life to them. And he desperately wanted to have
  them as his property. But he also couldn't back away from a challenge. The
  best he could hope for was to make the terms of the bet so unattractive that
  the challenge would be withdrawn. 
&ldquo;That could work for me,&rdquo; Bob said after considering the situation, &ldquo;but
  with one change. If we win, we get you and your slaveboy for a week. If you
  win, you get Emily and Jane for a week and&hellip;&rdquo; 
&ldquo;we get you when you return them for the duration of their slavery.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Whoa!&rdquo; exclaimed Liz. &ldquo;Are you serious? I thought my slaving
  days were over. I'll have to think about that one.&rdquo; 
Jane was the first to return to her senses and the gist of the discussion
  started to register for her. She couldn't believe what she was hearing. She
  had already been kidnapped by one owner and then given to a second owner. Now
  her body was to be gambled and potentially won by a third owner. It was at
  that moment more than at any previous time that she realized that she really
  was just a piece of property to be used, displayed, bought, sold, donated and
  ultimately discarded in all likelihood. And it sounded like she might have
  her slavery extended by at least another week. 
She wondered if Emily was listening and if she understood that the two of
  them may end up with a new owner. When she looked over at her slave sister,
  however, she saw that Emily was sound asleep, draped over the chair, with her
  bound arms sticking up in the air. She was not listening to anything. 
She also wondered what Liz would be like as an owner. She was very pretty
  and she seemed to be very gentle. Jane remembered the soothing caresses and
  the calming words during the rape of her bottom. And it seemed that Liz must
  be heterosexual since it sounded like she owned a male slave. But it seemed
  so unusual that someone her age could own someone else. &ldquo;Did that mean
  that I could own someone?&rdquo; she wondered. &ldquo;What would it be like
  to own someone? Would I even like it?&rdquo; 
She decided that she had better stand up or she might be accused of malingering.
  So she raised herself from the relative safety of the chair and stood behind
  it. 
&ldquo;Come, girl,&rdquo; motioned Meg, and Jane crossed the floor to kneel
  at her owner's feet. Meg continued to talk with the others but also started
  lightly caressing Jane's cheek. 
Emily finally awoke and joined the gathering. She was told to kneel in the
  center of the sitting area and Jane was told to join her. Their bindings were
  removed and they knelt back-to-back, acting as a decorative centerpiece to
  the ongoing discussions. Their sexual use had ended. For the remainder of the
  evening, they were mere ornaments. 
Finally, the little party broke up and guests started filing out. Ted and
  his wife, June, told the Hopewells that they would be interested in buying
  the girls and asked Bob to name a price. Bob graciously declined. 
Liz sent her boyfriend out to the car ahead of her and lingered behind. &ldquo;I'm
  still thinking about the challenge,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I want those two.
  But in the meantime, please do think about showing them tomorrow night.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;We'll think about it,&rdquo; replied Bob. &ldquo;And we'll also order
  another collar. One for your neck.&rdquo; 
After the guests left, Bob and Meg debated about what to do with the girls.
  Bob thought that they should be left together so they could sort out their
  future decision. Meg thought they should be brought to bed where Emily could
  be comforted by the owners. She argued that the recent fisting and ass-fucking
  would probably be the only topics of conversation if the girls were left alone
  and that could easily lead to them both leaving at the end of the week. 
Meg's argument prevailed in the end. The two girls were brought to the master
  bedroom and sandwiched between Bob and Meg. Bob claimed Emily on his side of
  the bed and Meg curled up with Jane. 
&ldquo;I was very proud of both of you,&rdquo; said Bob to his two captives. 
:Thank you, Master,&rdquo; replied Emily. 
&ldquo;I'm sure that you wish that some parts of the evening never happened,&rdquo; he
  went on, &ldquo;but we learned things about you. You seemed to have some pretty
  powerful orgasms. And I think that you probably learned some things about yourself.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Sure did, Master. I learned that I hate being ass-fucked!&rdquo; said
  Jane irreverently, knowing that it would probably result in some kind of punishment. 
&ldquo;I'm sure it wasn't all that bad,&rdquo; replied Bob. 
&ldquo;Not that bad?!?!?!&rdquo; replied Jane. &ldquo;Have you ever been
  ass-fucked?&rdquo; 
&ldquo;As a matter of fact, I have,&rdquo; responded Bob. &ldquo;The first
  time was bad. It got better later.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; was all that Jane could say. She decided to shut up and
  let her body mold itself to Meg who had draped an arm across her. 
&ldquo;Are you comfortable, Mistress?&rdquo; asked Jane, trying to change
  the subject. 
&ldquo;Yes, pet,&rdquo; murmured Meg as she cupped a breast and squeezed
  it. &ldquo;I'm doing wonderfully.&rdquo; 
Chapter 12: Decision 
The rest of the week went by quickly. There were no more whippings, fistings
  or anal sex. Bob and Emily continued to enjoy frequent and varied sex with
  the girls. And the girls had their own gentle lovemaking when they had time
  by themselves in their suite, which turned out to be a late-afternoon tradition.
  The owners did, however, like to place the girls in predicaments from time
  to time. 
One day, their arms were bound behind their backs. Then a rope was run from
  one set of wrists through a pulley in the top of the barn and down to the other
  girl's wrists. All of the slack was taken out of the rope and then Bob continued
  to tighten it. As the rope grew shorter and shorter, the bound hands were drawn
  into the air, causing the slaves to bend at the waist. It continued to be drawn
  tighter until the shoulders were straining and then they were left alone. It
  was a devilish torture. Each girl could reduce the strain on her own shoulders
  by pulling downward but that would have the affect of increasing the strain
  on her slave sister. They both ended up suffering together, bottom-to-bottom,
  standing bent over in the middle of the barn for over an hour. 
On another day, Meg made good on her promise to let them experience pony
  play. They were each fitted with tack and led out to the corral where Meg taught
  them how to prance, urging their education with a long, convincing buggy whip.
  After they had learned how to step like a ponygirl, she hooked them up to a
  cart and drove them through the countryside. Meg especially enjoyed that day.
  Seeing two firm, naked bottoms flexing and moving in unison was a memory that
  she would carry with her forever. And the tiny tinkling of the bells fastened
  to the four nipples just added to the experience. 
But the decision day finally came and since their slavery was started on
  a morning, the decision was set for the morning. 
&ldquo;Emily, we know that you have been thinking a lot about this for the
  past week. And we recognize that many emotions must be swirling through your
  mind. Have you been able to come to a decision?&rdquo; asked Meg. 
&ldquo;Yes, Mistress, I have,&rdquo; replied Emily. Jane felt her heart pounding
  in her chest as she held her breath. &ldquo;I have had a wonderful time. You
  have taught me many things about myself that I never would have discovered
  on my own. But I cannot stay here as your slave. One of the things that I learned
  was that I enjoy topping too much to be a slavegirl.&rdquo; Jane let out her
  breath as an audible sigh. 
&ldquo;I also discovered that I also love being a bottom, though, so if it's
  okay with you, I would like to return frequently to be your temporary slavegirl.
  But I would understand if you said no. For the time being, though, I think
  I want to take my slavegirl home with me.&rdquo; 
Bob nodded slowly. &ldquo;We will respect your decision and will release
  the two of you. But we will be viewing this as simply a delay of your enslavement
  to us. We saw the makings of an exceptional slave in you and saw true happiness
  in your face. We will own you. But you will decide when that happens.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Yes, Master,&rdquo; replied Emily. &ldquo;Thank you. And you may be
  right about owning me. I don't even know myself.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Will you be loaning Jane to us occasionally?&rdquo; asked Meg. 
&ldquo;I don't know, Mistress,&rdquo; responded Emily honestly. &ldquo;I
  have a lot to sort out.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Well you take whatever time you need, pet,&rdquo; said Meg. We lobe
  you both dearly.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;I love you too, Mistress,&rdquo; said a tearful Emily. &ldquo;And
  you too, Master.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Well now that we are both neighboring slave owners,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;we
  should talk about how to use our properties together for slave training. Maybe
  some pony trails throughout the estates? But that can wait. You need to sort
  things out. And we need to find some slaves. We just lost the best two slaves
  possible so it might take some time for us.&rdquo; 
The two girls walked naked and hand-in-hand back to Emily's home. It was
  only ten o'clock in the morning when they walked into the house and they sat
  naked at the kitchen table enjoying a cup of coffee. Despite Emily's freedom,
  she never donned any clothes for the duration of the day. She had become accustomed
  to being naked and it probably would have felt strange to wear anything. And
  Jane, who had been naked for over a month, also remained naked. What surprised
  her, though, was that she was not bound in some way. The Hopewells had removed
  their collars saying that they would keep them in a safe place for their return
  and Jane was now free of any adornment or restraint. 
The two girls ambled aimlessly around the house. And then in the late afternoon
  they retired to the bedroom for their daily lovemaking. They fell asleep in
  each other's arms and awoke at dusk. Then they prepared dinner and relaxed
  in the living room with Emily sitting on the couch and Jane kneeling at her
  feet. 
&ldquo;I'm releasing you, pip,&rdquo; said Emily as she ran her fingers through
  her slavegirl's hair. 
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Jane. 
&ldquo;Just what I said. Tonight will be your last night in slavery. Tomorrow,
  you go home and are free.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Jane quietly. &ldquo;Just like that, huh?&rdquo; 
&ldquo;You are too precious to be held by just one person. And you have dreams
  and aspirations. You mean too much to me to deprive you of those.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; replied Jane. And then there was a long silence. Finally,
  Jane spoke again. &ldquo;I will miss this,&rdquo; she said quietly. 
&ldquo;I will miss it too. You were the most perfect slavegirl.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Can I request something?&rdquo; asked Jane. 
&ldquo;Sure pip,&rdquo; replied Emily as she patted her lap encouraging Jane
  to come up to the couch. Jane quickly scrambled up and soon one nude girl sat
  in the lap of another nude girl. 
&ldquo;I want to remain as your slave, Em. This has been the most amazing
  time of my life and I don't want to lose it. I have never felt so alive. But
  can I recommend some changes?&rdquo; 
&ldquo;I'm all ears,&rdquo; responded Emily. 
&ldquo;Well I would like to have a career. I think that I should work outside
  the home but that I should live here as your slave. And I do want to settle
  down and raise a family someday. But that can wait. But I would like to be
  released from slavery when I meet the right guy. Until I do though, I want
  to be your slavegirl.&rdquo; 
 
&rdquo;What does being my slavegirl mean to you, pip?&rdquo; asked Emily.  
&ldquo;It means slavery. No decisions. If you want to cut my hair or pierce
  my nipples or fist me or whatever, then I am your property to do that with.
  You could sell me or loan me. You could parade me naked in public or whip me
  in private. You could do anything you wanted. Just let me have a career.&rdquo; 
Emily wrapped her arms around Jane and hugged her. &ldquo;And if I bought
  that strap-on and ass-fucked you?&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Ewwww!&rdquo; exclaimed Jane. &ldquo;Even that though.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;I love you, pip. And I accept your offer. Your body and mind and soul
  now belong to me.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;I love you too,&rdquo; smiled Jane. &ldquo;Thank you, Mistress.&rdquo;
