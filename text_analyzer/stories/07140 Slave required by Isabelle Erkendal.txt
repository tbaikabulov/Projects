Slave required by Isabelle Erkendal





"I hear the thunder crashing, the sky is dark

And now a storm is breaking within my heart

(All day, all day) Watch them all fall down" (Domino Dancing)



Hi there, guys!



I am Isabelle Erkendal from Sweden. You know me. I am the singer from the band West End Girls.

You dream of me: red hair, cute voice, fire brigade helmet and uniform. Once you saw ME in one

of these, it became your new fetish. I am famous, successful and superior to most of you guys.



I became a celebrity by redoing the best of the Pet Shop Boys songs. Another reason why you love

me so much. You heard and listened to the songs since your childhood, and they became a part of your

life. But then you heard ME singing them - and they were even better than before. At least so

you say in your tons of fan mail I receive every day.



"You dress me up, I'm your puppet

You buy me things, I love it

You bring me food, I need it

You give me love, I feed it

And look at the two of us in sympathy

With everything we see

I never want anything, it's easy

You buy whatever I need

But look at my hopes, look at my dreams

The currency we've spent

(Ooooh) I love you, oh, you pay my rent

...

I'm your puppet

I love it" (Rent)



Ah, Rent is sung from the male perspective.



As I became rich by doing music, I can choose whatever man I like. Obviously I will choose my most

devoted fan and keep him as my pet. He will own nothing, I will own him and determine everything in

his life: his clothes, his food, what he is doing. You think, you can serve me like this? Keep in mind

that you will have to give your current life up completely and just do whatever I wish.



"Can you even deliver, what she demands of you?" (Can you forgive her?)



Naturally, complete control also includes complete sexual control. You will satisfy my physical needs in

whichever fashion I desire. Prepare to be kept chaste and locked up in an appropiate device. I will keep

all keys for it. You will have no orgasm unless I wish you do. How often that will be? Who knows? Maybe ...

sometimes. But people can change, so can I. Maybe I won't let you come at all after a while to keep

you ready and willing to serve all around the clock.



"You've got the brawn, I've got the brains

Let's make lots of money" (Opportunities)



Don't think, you can go lazy, when you become mine. I will exploit your talents. If you are a technician,

you will become part of the touring staff and be responsible for the sound equipment. Beware to keep all

synthesizers, cables and boxes working well and undamaged. Even if you crave heavy punishment, you will

never want to piss me off. But maybe you are less into electronics, but more into bureau work? Hm, you

might substitute my overpaid manager and do everything about the contracts, contacts and legal stuff of

our band to make me even richer than I am now.



"I go anywhere, baby.

I'm not scared, baby." (I'm not scared)



You will be the perfect gentleman at my side in public whenever I go to a party or a public meeting. You

will hide your slave branding under a suite. But that won't mean much. My partner in the band and all my

girlfriends will know about your true condition. Maybe some of them will want to rent your body for their

pleasure and ask me to send you in some privat room, where you will have to strip, kneel down facing the wall

and wait for whatever the evening will bring.



"Which do you choose, a hard or soft option?" (West End Girls)



You will train to get and keep a perfect body. Not too muscular, you need to keep up a somewhat boyish,

teenage-like look. Your body hair will be completely removed, and I will put a locked ring through your

scrotum so you can be chained everywhere.



You will also train to be used by men. This is very important for me! Read this careful!



"She'd make fun of you, and even in bed

Said she was gonna go and get herself a real man instead" (Can you forgive her?)



Neil Tennant from the Pet Shop Boys has written a red letter to our band West End Girls. Neil Tennant is such

a great guy, I adore him very much. When I found my band it was because I was in love with him, and I am still

quite ofently think about him. He has a sexy voice, great talent as an artist and the best face in the world.

Even such a cool guy like David Tennant, who has been acting as tenth Doctor Who, has chosen his stage name from

Neil Tennant. (David's real name is David John McDonald.)



Neil told us in his letter, the Pet Shop Boys are inviting us, the West End Girls, to come to them to England for

a year or so. They want to produce an album together with us. It's a unique project, in which we Girls won't copy

the Boys, but do something original together with them - Neil and me singing. Both band names will appear on the

cover. It will be my greatest dream come true, and we will go to the West End Boys and join them for a while.



"You're in love, and it feels like pain" (Can you forgive her?)



Too bad Neil is gay. But I will please him by offering the services of my personal slave. You will do it, whatever

he wishes and anytime when he wishes. If you love me, you must become his slut. If he asks, I might rent you out

to Neil for a longer period, or even give you to him as a gift of friendship and reverence. If you love me and

want to improve my life and help me in what is really important for me, you'll understand that this will be of

utmost importance and be happy to be used for my stronger connection to Neil.



"So I look back upon my life

Forever with a sense of shame

I've always been the one to blame

For everything I long to do

No matter when or where or who

Has one thing in common, too

It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin

It's a sin

Everything I've ever done

Everything I ever do

Every place I've ever been

Everywhere I'm going to - it's a sin" (It's a sin)



You know, your life was meaningless before you were owned by me. It had no sense, no purpose, no direction, no value.

Anything you did, while not serving me, was useless and foolish. It is good you started to regret these wasted years.

I will take all your property, all fruits of your work, your body, your soul and all your time, so you will have nothing

left to pay back the crime of not caring for me in your past. How will you compensate your failure?



"To feel the smack of firm government" (King's Cross)



Yes, you will be punished whenever I feel like it. I've got the tools for it to treat you really hard. You know them.

You crave them. You will love me even more for applying them to your body. You'll exist for my pleasure regardless the

pain you may experience. If you like it or not - I expect you to jump whenever I clap my hands!



I think, this description of my offer is sufficient. If you think, you can fulfill my expectations, get up, come here to

Sweden and become my property!

Slave required by Isabelle Erkendal





"I hear the thunder crashing, the sky is dark

me so much. You heard and listened to the songs since your childhood, and they became a part of your

life. But then you heard ME singing them - and they were even better than before. At least so

you say in your tons of fan mail I receive every day.



I am the oldest of three siblings. Growing up with a smaller sister and a smaller brother, I became

a natural, skilled and responsible leader type. A cold, cool, sexy, smart and voguish woman, who knows

what she wants and gets it - that's not just an image I'm selling but the most important part of my

personality. And you will completely adjust yourself to me.



"You dress me up, I'm your puppet

You buy me things, I love it

You bring me food, I need it

You give me love, I feed it

And look at the two of us in sympathy

With everything we see

I never want anything, it's easy

"Can you even deliver, what she demands of you?" (Can you forgive her?)



Naturally, complete control also includes complete sexual control. You will satisfy my physical needs in

whichever fashion I desire. Usually on your knees between my legs. You've seen that doggie on some of the

photos we've published? That'll be precisely your position. Prepare to be kept chaste and locked up in an

appropiate device. I will keep all keys for it. You will have no orgasm unless I wish you do. How often

that will be? Who knows? Maybe ... sometimes. But people can change, so can I. Maybe I won't let you come at

all after a while to keep you ready and willing to serve all around the clock.

"What do you wear

When you need to impress

Just slip into high heals

And a brand new little black dress

You're such a success

Wearing a little black dress

And out to impress

Wearing a little black dress

Love is a vampire

Haunting the city at night

In chic uniform

Short, black and tight" (A little black dress)



Yeah, I don't just wear fire brigade uniforms all the time. I like fashion, and I am constantly changing,

evolving and reinventing myself with new styles, outfits and dresses. You will adore me in all of them. If

you are skilled and a really good servant, you might be allowed to be the official photographer of the

West End Girls. Newly I prefere to wear equestrian's clothes, boots, helmet, leggins and all that. You will

serve as bridled pony boy under my riding crop.



"Baybe, I go anywhere.

Baby, I'm not scared." (I'm not scared)



You will be the perfect gentleman at my side in public whenever I go to a party or a public meeting. You

will hide your slave branding under a suite. But that won't mean much. My partner in the band and all my
