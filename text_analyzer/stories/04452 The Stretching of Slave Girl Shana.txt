The Stretching of Slave Girl Shana������������������� 

by Sigmund Freud (sirwhereareyou@hotmail.com)

&nbsp;

In the decades that followed the global energy and food shortages, and
the subsequent collapse of various economies, the old polities disintegrated
into city states and feudalism. The rich were excessively so, and exploited the
poor for their own private gain.

&nbsp;

Inside the
complex on the far side of the mountain, near the ruins of the Oratory, a slave
girl was retained for the Master's personal indulgences. Her name was Shana.
Having been trained by the Understudy for display before the Master (upon his
whim), Shana had been shown to her shoe box-sized chamber and given her slave
uniform. It was a green tunic with short sleeves and a high, even collar with a
notch cut in the front, like a priest's. It had a crisp, professional press to
it, greatly flattering her upper body, but its hemline was very, very short.
She had only an inch, it seemed, between her modesty and her embarrassment.

&nbsp;

It had been a week of hard training by the Understudy, and
Shana was in her chamber, trying to relax by reading, lying across the bed on
her stomach with her feet in the air, brushing her bare, pointed toes against
each other. So long as she was alone, she didn't mind the mirror reflecting how
the tunic betrayed the first inch of her bare seat.

&nbsp;

Having lost herself in the book, she did not hear the
approaching shuffle of the Usher, did not hear his feet on the ladder, did not
realize her solitude was to be taken again, until he flung back the chamber
curtain. Shana gasped, and was off the bed and kneeling on the floor in one,
swift motion, her head bowed. The Usher's face was expressionless.

&nbsp;

&quot;The Understudy will see you now,&quot; he said simply.
Shana rose and looked for her sandals. &quot;Bare feet,&quot; the Usher said,
in an absent-minded tone, almost to himself, and climbed back down the ladder.

&nbsp;

Shana suppressed a sigh. Cold concrete, the sandals forsaken.
She climbed out and down the ladder, ignoring the Usher's upward stare.

&nbsp;

The Usher brought Shana to a dimly-lit room at the far end of
the complex. She was greeted by the sight of a strange contraption in the
middle of the room: a stainless steel table, with a large floodlight positioned
overhead. At the foot of the table was a long, stainless steel piston-shaped
tube emerging from an inscrutable mesh of hydraulics, rounding to a soft point
at one end like a missile, and with a diameter comparable to a rolling pin. A
small console with gauges and lights stood next to it. The Understudy paced
slowly around the machine and stopped when he caught sight of Shana.

&nbsp;

&quot;Ah, good,&quot; he said, &quot;You've arrived.&quot;
She knelt and bowed her head. The Usher went over to the machine and flipped
some switches on the console, causing gauges and tiny lights to jump to life.
He switched on the floodlight and the metallic table was brightly lit, the
shiny metal reflecting the light all around the room. The Understudy smiled
thinly at Shana. &quot;I designed and built this myself,&quot; he said.
&quot;From spare scrap from the old university campus.&quot; Shana stared up
uncomprehendingly at the machine. He added, &quot;There are other projects,
too.&quot;

&nbsp;

The Understudy stepped forward and took her hand.
&quot;Arise, slave,&quot; he said, gently pulling her up. &quot;Stand on your
toes for a moment.&quot; She did, and the Understudy paced around her, taking
her in from all sides. Standing on her toes had the action of pulling the back
of her tunic's hem up high enough to show a hint of the crease of her bare rear.

&nbsp;

The Understudy stopped smiling. &quot;All right, that's
enough,&quot; he said calmly, striding over to the machine. &quot;Come over
here and get up on the table.&quot; Shana hesitated, her eyes wide.
&quot;Now!&quot; the Understudy barked. She padded quickly over to the table,
and slid up onto its cold, shiny surface, keeping her legs and thighs firmly
together in an attempt to preserve her modesty.

&nbsp;

The Usher seemed to be checking the gauges on the machine and
conferred momentarily with the Understudy, the two talking in quiet tones.
Shana stared at the piston. The Understudy turned back to her suddenly and
said, &quot;Alright, Slave Shana, lie on your back.&quot; Shana broke her
silence.

&nbsp;

&quot;What is this machine for?&quot; she asked quietly.

&nbsp;

&quot;Lie down and I'll tell you,&quot; he replied. She
slowly lay back, bringing her legs up, thighs together, onto the cold, metal
slab, and tugged her hem down to cover her fur, which uncovered her bare rear.
She felt the cold metal beneath her and began to shake. Before she understood
what was happening, the Understudy casually reached to the side of the table
and pulled a strap tightly over her pelvis like a seatbelt, locking it in place
on the other side beyond her reach. It was so tight, it hurt. Shana sat up in a
panic, tried to wiggle her torso free, and found she was belted tight to the
table. She looked at the Understudy with fright.

&nbsp;

&quot;Please, sir, it's too tight! What are you doing?&quot;
she squeaked. The Understudy pushed her back down roughly, eliciting a
surprised grunt from her.

&nbsp;

&quot;Slave Shana, I am displeased with your truculence and
we are here tonight to ensure that this behaviour changes!&quot; the Understudy
thundered. Shana began to cry quietly, tears brimming up and rolling down her
cheeks.

&nbsp;

&quot;But, but I've been a good girl,&quot; she said
plaintively.

&nbsp;

&quot;No,&quot; said the Understudy simply. &quot;Not to my
way of thinking.&quot; She began to cry harder as the realization dawned on her
that he meant to punish her. Her slim body increasingly shook with her sobs.
&quot;Anyway,&quot; said the Understudy, &quot;I'm not much for lectures. This
isn't a movie.&quot; He turned toward the console. &quot;Begin the
treatment,&quot; he said to the Usher, who nodded and flipped a switch.

&nbsp;

Shana let out long, choking sobs, which filled the room from
end to end, echoing off the walls piteously. The piston shuddered to life and
advanced up the table with a soft whine of its hydraulic arms. It was already
positioned at a latitude that brought it easily up between her legs. When Shana
saw the piston move, she sat up again, hysterical, frantically clamping her
thighs together, as she finally realized what the piston was for and why she
wasn't allowed any panties underneath her little skirt.

&nbsp;

&quot;No, no, no, no!&quot; she shrieked, shaking her head,
as if trying to will a halt to the piston's advance. She pushed against it with
all her might, but the hydraulics were relentless, and the belt across her
pelvis had pinned her hips firmly in place. The Understudy stepped back and
watched impassively as the piston nosed up under her skirt, effortlessly
separating her clamped thighs. As the tip of the piston reached her pubic bone,
Shana switched from pushing against the end of it to frantically grabbing its
sides, her hands between her thighs, continuing to fight it, and shrieking. It
would still not yield to her efforts. She tried moving her hips to either side,
but the tip found the folds, breached her labia majora, followed the groove
down and penetrated her, tearing through her hymen. Then it began to stretch
the insides of her vagina wider then she ever thought possible, making a
discernible squishing noise. Her shrieking ended in a sharp cry, and for just a
brief moment, she continued to fight it as it went up into her, fingers sliding
uselessly against stainless steel. Her head snapped back, her legs squirmed and
her bare feet scrabbled on the table.

&nbsp;

That was when Shana stopped crying.

&nbsp;

The room hushed as her normal behaviour ceased. The time for
her shrieking and crying had ended, and the time for a special kind of silence
began: a surreal silence punctuated by the sounds she made as she was being
stretched. A short while ago, she had been innocently reading on her bed, and
now her unexpected performance commenced: unrehearsed, spontaneous, and
genuine. Shana crossed the boundary between articulate and inarticulate, and
the contrast was sharp.

&nbsp;

Shana wordlessly arched her back, her breasts straining
through her tunic. Her tiny tunic's short hem slipped up her bare hips as she
brought her knees up. She began to tilt her head back, her long hair spilling
off the edge of the table. Her arms and hands grew rigid, every tendon visible,
and her fingertips raked the table. Her bare feet arched hard like a gymnast,
toes pointed. She silently opened her mouth wide, relaxed it slightly, her
throat undulating, then widened it again.

&nbsp;

&quot;Aa, aaa,&quot; she croaked.

&nbsp;

Then silence.

&nbsp;

The piston would pause, advance an inch, pause, advance an
inch. Her body would twitch in response.

&nbsp;

&quot;Aa -a.&quot;

&nbsp;

Silence.

&nbsp;

Her head was thrown all the way back as far as it could go,
touching the table, mouth wide open, jaw quivering. The piston made a soft, wet
noise inside her as it jerked another inch.

&nbsp;

&quot;Aaa,&quot; she croaked again.

&nbsp;

Silence.

&nbsp;

The piston jerked another inch and her bare feet arched
again, her sweaty soles squeaking as they slid on the table.

&nbsp;

&quot;Aa -aa.&quot;

&nbsp;

Silence filled the room. The piston jerked deeper.

&nbsp;

Sweat beaded up on her forehead and neck. The more it
stretched her, the more strained and intense was her croaking; like staccato
Morse Code, the pitch of her voice a little higher each time the piston jerked
deeper, harder.

&nbsp;

&quot;Aaa, aa-aa... !&quot;

&nbsp;

Shana's hands repeatedly clenched into fists and unclenched.
Her eyes squeezed shut. Her mouth stretched wide, as far as it could open.
Tears streamed down her cheeks.

&nbsp;

&quot;Aaaaaa- aa-&quot; 

&nbsp;

The guttural croaking sound from the back of her throat,
mouth yawning, her tongue jerking. The sweat beads on her shuddering skin
glistened under the hard spotlight.

&nbsp;

The sweaty soles of her bare feet squeaked on the table
again. She could not get a grip with them, and the soles arched, the toes
pointed. Arched, then pointed. Her bare heels would dig into the table, hold a
moment, and then slip. The legs would straighten. Then the knees would rise,
and just the tips of her arched, pointed toes would touch the stainless steel.
They would hold, slip, and the process would repeat.

&nbsp;

Now the piston was deep inside her.

&nbsp;

She began to tear inside her tunnel. She could feel it tear,
feel herself tear. Her tunnel was at its limit, the stretching too rapid for it
to accommodate the piston. 

&nbsp;

The Understudy gave a small nod to the Usher, who flipped the
switch, and the piston suddenly withdrew out from her - most of the way. Shana
collapsed, hyperventilating noisily, her chest heaving, her tunic damp with
sweat. As she heaved, her shaking hands slid between her thighs to wrap around
the piston and follow it up to where it entered her pussy. Her fingers felt
around the edges where her pussy bulged around the shaft, and she raised her
head to try and look at the spectacle with wild, wide eyes.

&nbsp;

�No, stop! It's splitting me open!� she gasped. �Please help
me!�

&nbsp;

The Understudy gave her a moment and then nodded at the
Usher. &quot;Again,&quot; he said. The Usher flipped the switch and the piston
pushed up into her again.

&nbsp;

�No! Daddy please help me� aaah!�

&nbsp;

Shana made a protesting, plaintive cry, and went rigid.

&nbsp;

�Aaah! Aah! Ah!�

&nbsp;

She contorted, as before, grabbing the sides of the table
with white knuckles, and the room hushed a second time.

&nbsp;

The piston sank into her, stretching her taut and thin. Her
jaw undulated, her open mouth reached for the ceiling, but she made no sound.

&nbsp;

When the piston was fully inside her, the Understudy stepped
forward and released the belt across her hips. With the flip of another switch
by the Usher, the piston began to lift her, waist-first, leaving her back and
shoulders resting on the metal slab, and her raised lower half impaled on the
piston.

&nbsp;

Shana gaaked loudly from her throat.

&nbsp;

She hung in the silence, stretching.

&nbsp;

She gaaked again.

&nbsp;

The tearing in her tunnel widened.

&nbsp;

Shana gaaked in agony from the tearing. 

&nbsp;

Her body hung suspended at an angle, her skirt falling up to
reveal how the piston emerged obscenely from her pussy.

&nbsp;

She involuntarily wrapped her bare legs around the cold
piston, toes pointed, the sound of sweaty bare skin rubbing against steel, as
she tried to stop herself from tearing more. From stretching wider than her
tunnel could go.

&nbsp;

Shana was dimly aware she was being watched intently, but had
given up all pretense of dignity as the piston continued to stretch her. The
soft, squishing, stretching noise was faintly audible, in the silences between
the sounds coming from the back of her throat as she felt herself open. She had
never heard herself make the sounds she was making before. It didn�t sound like
her voice, but she knew it was her voice, and she could not help but make the
sounds.

&nbsp;

&quot;Aa...�� 

&nbsp;

a... 

&nbsp;

a...&quot;

&nbsp;

The piston no longer moved, having lodged up against the top
of her tunnel. Shana clung to the piston with her bare legs and feet, trying
not to move. Each movement, however slight, was causing her tunnel to tear a
little more, millimetre by millimetre, from the weight of her body.� 

&nbsp;

Her left bare sole arched and rubbed the piston. It lost its
purchase and slipped. 

&nbsp;

Another tear opened.

&nbsp;

Shana gaaked in agony.

&nbsp;

Silence.

&nbsp;

She slowly brought her bare foot back up and over the piston
and squeezed with the legs for purchase.

&nbsp;

The movement widened the tear.

&nbsp;

She gaaked in greater agony.

&nbsp;

Silence.

&nbsp;

Her sweaty bare legs kissed the cool metal for a moment more
and then slipped. Shana tried to brace herself, but she tore in several more
places. Her tunnel now had six micro ruptures in it.

&nbsp;

She gaaked three times in rapid succession.

&nbsp;

Again she wrapped her bare legs around the cold, steel shaft,
toes arched and trembling. Her body shook with the effort. Shana did not think
she could hold on much longer without her tunnel rupturing. There was no place
left for the bulging hulk of steel to go.

&nbsp;

She felt another tear and she mustered the will to look at
her audience. They stared back at her, silently.

&nbsp;

She mewed to them softly, plaintively. No one said anything.
She mewed again. Another tear opened and she snapped her head up and back and gaaked
again. 

&nbsp;

Finally, the Understudy nodded at the Usher, who reversed the
switch, and the piston let her back down to the slab, and withdrew from her
slowly, dripping and slick. 

&nbsp;

Shana screamed sharply and bucked her hips violently as it
slid out.� The Usher calmly wiped it with
a cloth.

&nbsp;

Shana rolled onto her side, heaved, and drew her knees up to
her chest. The surreal silence was over and time snapped back to normal again.
The performance had ended and she began to sob hard, gut-wrenching sobs.

&nbsp;

The Understudy said, &quot;At the height of that, you looked
like the most beautiful woman in the world.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Please, please don't do that again! Please don't hurt
me anymore! Please don't hurt me!&quot; she cried.

&nbsp;

&quot;I won't. But I'm sure you'll work harder at your station
with that kind of inspiration,&quot; he said. &quot;Anyway, the Usher will take
you to the infirmary. I know that hurt, but you'll get more than enough
rest.&quot;

&nbsp;

She lay still on the table, her thighs quivering. 

&nbsp;

�Oh God, it hurt so bad. It hurt so bad!�

&nbsp;

He left the room, leaving her with the Usher, who waited
patiently for her to recover.
