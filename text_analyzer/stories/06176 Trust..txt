 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"John... put that thing away.&nbsp; We've already talked about this..."&nbsp; I stared at the disgusting red ballgag that my shirtless husband dangled in front of me.&nbsp; "You know that we should always have a safe word."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Shhh, Erica."&nbsp; He placed his index finger gently over my lips and stared at me with his hazel eyes.&nbsp; "You trust me, don't you?&nbsp; When have you ever had to use a safeword with me?"

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was right.&nbsp; He had always been safe in the past, but I still shook my head and said, "You know that I trust you, honey, but I don't want to put myself in that position.&nbsp; We should always try to keep things safe."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My husband sighed, and stared at me with disappointment and frustration in his eyes.&nbsp; "Oh, please... it's summer break and we won't have to deal with students or administrators for over two months.&nbsp; Let's this be the summer of sexual adventure we were always wishing for, okay?"&nbsp; He placed his hands on my arms, which were chained to the a ceiling hook by leather cuffs. He grinned the same wide and toothy smile at me in the same exact way that made me love him from our very first date.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I closed my eyes and breathed heavily, remembering some of the more intense bondage sessions of our past.&nbsp; A few times I was ready to scream the predetermined word in pain, but instead kept going, realizing I had made the right decision as I orgasmed over and over.&nbsp; Thoughts of those times still terrified me, but a rising lust pushed me to overcome my caution and meagerly nod at John's demands.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"That's a good girl," John said.&nbsp; He reached out and stroked my long black hair with his right hand, toying with my ear, just the way I liked it.&nbsp; "Trust me, by the time it is over, you'll thank me.&nbsp; During the intermediate time, however, well, that's the spirit of adventure, right?" He ran the back of his hand along my inner thigh, giving me a taste of the erotic pleasure that would fill this summer.&nbsp; I smiled back at him ever so briefly, before he harshly shoved the gag into my mouth and locked it into place.&nbsp; I tried to let loose a yelp, but the gag did it's job, the rubber taste filling my mouth.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I had carelessly crossed the point of no return, and I tried to take back that one little mistake, but it was too late; my pleas only acted to heighten my husband's arousal, the bulge in his dress pants becoming more noticeable as I screamed into the bright red gag. I would have to live the consequences, no matter what they would be.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I screamed louder into the gag.&nbsp; "Mmmrrrrrrrrrrffffffff!", but my husband just looked at me and smiled.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I guess I should get into character as well."&nbsp; He reared his hand back and slapped me gently across the face, breaking one of the taboos we had set down when we started bondage play.&nbsp; I looked at his smooth face in contempt- there was no way he thought the slap was acceptable.&nbsp; "Quiet down, woman, or your punishment will be a lot worse than a light tap to your cheek."&nbsp; He tried to be sound mean, but his calm and gentle voice dampened the effect.&nbsp; I continued to scream into the gag, wishing more than anything to recant my consent, to regain my freedom, but John continued with his act and slapped me again, this time harder than he had ever slapped me before.&nbsp; I began to cry.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"There there, girl.&nbsp; No need for tears."&nbsp; John reach his right hand up to my face and swept away the forming tears.&nbsp; "I have plenty planned for us.&nbsp; Just you wait and see."&nbsp; He turned around and walked to the closet of our guest bedroom, which had turned into a makeshift bondage den six months ago.&nbsp; I followed his naked arms hairless back with my eyes, and I realized how deceptive his build was.&nbsp; While medium height and somewhat thin, he was powerful when he needed to be.&nbsp; Each time I tried to control him in bed, led to a reversal, him ravashing me as I struggled against his might.


 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As his eyes and head darted back and forth across the shelves of the closet, I could tell what he was searching for.&nbsp; I was in no mood for toys, especially after he had already crossed so many lines.&nbsp; I continued to scream and flail against the ropes that kept me tied to the ceiling, but John merely smiled.&nbsp; He found what he was looking for, then turned around, ribbed vibrator in hand. "Ah, here we go."&nbsp; He approached me with a sadistic smile.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Staring into his contorted face, I could no longer tell whether or not he was just playing.&nbsp; For the first time in our eight year relationship, I was scared of him.&nbsp; However, with my legs and arms bound and body exposed, I had no choice but to accept his probing hands and toys.&nbsp; I tried to follow him as he walked around me, but he left my view, leaving a trail of cologne behind him, a remnant of the night's romantic dinner date.&nbsp; All I could feel were his groping hands as they pinched my nipples, kneaded my tits, and caressed my thighs.&nbsp; Despite the initial objections, a warmth began to overtake me as the reality of true helplessness came to light.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For first the first time ever, I wandered out of my safety zone, no longer knowing what the future would hold.&nbsp; The rush in all of my previous bondage adventures was a result of the mere illusion of danger, fully aware that there was no true risk.&nbsp; Now, however, I was absolutely prone to the whims of another human being, with nothing keeping me safe and alive except my husband's wishes.&nbsp; I still cried, a nervous reaction to the intensity of the games, but I no longer strained against the bindings.&nbsp; John walked back to my front, running his fingers from the small of my back to just above my vagina. He unzipped his pants and let them, along with his boxers, drop to the floor, allowing his large cock to spring out, surprising me, as usual. I twitched but accepted him as he pierced me with his thick cock and began pumping in unison with him.&nbsp; His small but firm hands held tightly into my spread thighs as he rammed me repeatadly with his penis, my feet dangling helplessly to his sides.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was just getting used to my husband's rhythmic thrusts when he took the plastic vibrator, lubed it up, and shoved it deep into my tight asshole.&nbsp; I jerked in pain- that bastard knew how much I hated anal.&nbsp; His gentle thrusts gave way to more violent assaults on both of my holes, and my trust in my husband shattered into a thousand pieces.&nbsp; What was only moments ago thrilling became horrifying, my husband having ventured well beyond my previous limits of pain.&nbsp; I now understood that his preemptive gagging was no accident; for some reason, John's intentions were far from pure, and he fully intended to hurt me more than I would ever consent to.&nbsp; For the first time ever, I hated my husband.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finally, I broke down, thrashing with all my might, trying to kick John with my tiny feet. Tears streamed down my face.&nbsp; The most horrible noise I had ever tried to make emanated from my throat.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Nrrrggghh!"&nbsp; I stared at him with clouded eyes and tried to clench my thighs together, hoping to force him out as he came inside of me.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; He laughed at me as I struggled, leading me to turn to him and hate the clean-shaven face that I once found attractive.&nbsp; "Hahaha.&nbsp; Come on, Erica.&nbsp; You don't expect me to give up that easily, do you?&nbsp; We have a ton of ground to cover this summer, so you best save your strength from the coming trials."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Coming trials?&nbsp; What the hell was he planning to do with me? All I wanted was to lay down and sleep, free of the forced bondage so I could enjoy my summer vacation.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unfortunately, such a relaxing summer was not meant to be.&nbsp; John shoved the vibrator deeper into my ass and taped it into the place, then loosely redressed himself in his black slacks and blue dress shirt, not bothering to zip his pants or button his shirt.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Sweet dreams, honey.&nbsp; I'll be back in the morning to resume your training."&nbsp; He turned off the light and left me hanging in the darkness, tears falling down my face and cum down my thighs.&nbsp; For hours, I cried alone into the darkness, accompanied only by the buzz of the vibrator in my rear.&nbsp; I hung there in pain, hating my husband, fearing what other dark desires he had been waiting to fulfill.
