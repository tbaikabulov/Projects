THE PROLOGUE


Jessica's head was throbbing.&nbsp;&nbsp; She didn't know where she was, or how she got there.&nbsp; The last thing she remembered was driving with her three best girlfriends in her jeep to the beach, excited to celebrate their high school graduation.&nbsp; It was going to be beer and boys for a whole week.&nbsp; They were all so excited, they were already in their bathing suits, drinking the whole ride over.

She shuddered as memories came back to her.&nbsp; It was dark, they were drunk, and they had turned off the main roads.&nbsp; There was a crash.&nbsp; A truck.&nbsp; Someone was there.&nbsp; Someone took them...

Her reverie was interrupted by a cry of pain emanating from some other part of the unfamiliar building.&nbsp; When she instinctively tried to move, she realized she was tied up.&nbsp; Thin wire cut her wrists as she struggled against them.&nbsp; She tried to get up but pain shot up her leg with the slightest move.&nbsp; Maybe it was broken.&nbsp; She couldn't tell.&nbsp; Her head continued to throb.

Again the scream.&nbsp; Jessica froze in fear.&nbsp; She recognized the voice.&nbsp; It was Christine.



CHAPTER ONE


The skinny, auburn haired teenager was strapped to a rusty chair in a dingy room deep within the old warehouse.&nbsp; She had various bruises and cuts from the crash, including a broken nose which left dried blood running down her face.

But the real danger wasn't from the injuries from the accident.&nbsp; The real danger came from the dozens of C-clamps attached to every part of her body: fingers, joints, breasts, ribcage, temples.&nbsp; She tried to move her head but it was strapped to the back of the tall chair.&nbsp; Her mouth gagged with a thin strap of cloth, possibly from her skimpy white t-shirt that hung onto her in tatters.&nbsp; A pair of skimpy, skin tight shorts was the only other article of clothing she was wearing.

Her toned limbs struggled against her bonds, but she was strapped into the rusty chair by numerous metal cuffs.&nbsp; She shivered in the dark cold, but it was more from fear than from the low temperature.

When she heard footsteps she froze.&nbsp; Tuhk.&nbsp; Tuhk.&nbsp; Tuhk.&nbsp; The steps were slow and echoed along the crumbling stone walls of the building.&nbsp; Slowly they grew louder.&nbsp; They approached the open door to Christine's room.&nbsp; She froze, terrified.

A dark figure stood in the doorway, his features obscured by the darkness.&nbsp; He was huge, almost inhuman in his height and mass.&nbsp; Over seven feet and a chest the size of a refrigerator.&nbsp; He moved closer to the nearly naked teenager bound and helpless in the chair.&nbsp; Slowly he entered the light emanating from the dim bulb hanging in the center of the small, windowless room.&nbsp; Christine cried as he looked upon her through a hideous mask of rusted iron and metal.&nbsp; She couldn't see his eyes, but she heard is deep, harsh voice.

"Hello, Christine."

Christine screamed.



CHAPTER TWO


Nikki couldn't bear the feeling of helplessness as she lay tied up in the dark.&nbsp; When she heard Christine's screams she knew she had to move, but her wrists and elbows were tied behind her back with sharp twine that cut into her if she moved too much.&nbsp; At least her legs were free.&nbsp; The problem was that in the near pitch black darkness she didn't know where to go.

Wherever she was it was not a very hygienic place.&nbsp; The room must have been filled with old food; it smelled of sour milk and rotting cheese.&nbsp; She took only shallow breaths to prevent herself from gagging.

And then she heard the rats.&nbsp; There was no mistaking the pitter patter of their feet or their squeaks in the darkness.&nbsp; Nikki was terrified of rats.

A rat brushed by her foot and Nikki screeched.&nbsp; She curled to a ball but nothing she could do would protect her.&nbsp; Barefoot and scantily clad in a string bikini, she was almost completely exposed to their sharp teeth and claws.

Another rat touched her, this time with its claws as it scratched the bottom of her foot.&nbsp; Nikki screeched again and kicked her feet.&nbsp; Then she gasped in pain as she felt more of the wire cut into her arms.&nbsp; She would have to be more careful about moving.

Oh God why is this happening, thought Nikki.&nbsp; She wondered where her friends were.&nbsp; Are they doing any better?



CHAPTER THREE


"Please, please, don't hurt me.&nbsp; Oh God, please..." Christine blubbered as the monster of a man loosened the cloth that formed her gag.&nbsp; "What, what do you want?"

"I want to make you realize your vanity.&nbsp; I want you to decide what's more important, beauty, or life itself?" The man reached to his right and flipped a switch on the equipment near Christine.&nbsp; The hum of an air compressor came to life.

Suddenly moment Christine felt the clamp on her temples tighten, alarming her that her skull was being crushed.

"AAhhhhhh make it stop make it stop!"

"The compressor will crush your head in a few minutes, but you have the power to stop it."

"How? I want it to stop now!"

"You need to press down on this switch." The man held a small device that connected to the equipment through an electrical wire.&nbsp; The switch was simple: squeeze it and you could hear a click.&nbsp; At that moment the equipment beeped in acknowledgement, and Christine could feel the pressure on her temples release.

"Now," he continued, "for the next three minutes you won't have to worry about the pressure on your temples.&nbsp; But soon the pressure will return and you will need to press down on the switch again.&nbsp; But this next time, you will feel the pressure elsewhere on your body." He ran a large, gloved finger over the clamps that gripped her own fingers.

"So you will have to chose.&nbsp; Your beauty," he spoke as he ran a gloved finger over the clamps on her feet and toes, "or your life."

Just then the compressor clicked back to life and Christine felt the pressure on her temples return.

"Please don't make me do this.&nbsp; Please, please, oh no please no..." He stared impassionate at her through the mask as she openly sobbed, and he waited until panic set in.

"OH GOD I DON'T WANT TO DIE.&nbsp; PRESS IT.&nbsp; I'll do anything please make it stop."

"Only you have the power to choose, Christine," he gripped her right ankle and inserted the pivot switch under her bound foot, making sure to latch it onto the ground so she couldn't inadvertently push it away.

In a panic she pressed down on the switch.&nbsp; The familiar click sound could be heard and the equipment hummed in a different tone, indicating it was shifting pressure elsewhere.&nbsp; Immediately Christine felt relief from the pressure on her temples, but slowly realized that her right pinky was throbbing.&nbsp; A small red light flashed atop the clamp on her dainty finger, indicating the machine was initiating its ruthless program.&nbsp; Slowly and slowly the pressure on it built; the clamp squeezing tighter and tighter on her finger.&nbsp; She stared at the monster in astonishment.

"You are going to have to make many choices in the next hour, dear Christine."

The man exited the room, closing the iron door behind him, leaving Christine alone with the machine.&nbsp; She tried to stay calm amidst the escalating pain in her hand, but when the bones in her pinky splintered and blood and tissue oozed out of the sides on the clamp, she let loose a violent scream.&nbsp; Then the compressor clicked again, ceasing its attack on her pinky and returning to her temples.&nbsp; She wept as she agonized over pressing the switch to save herself.

She clenched her jaw and triggering the switch once again.&nbsp; Her left index finger, beautifully manicured and perfectly slender, began to throb.



More of the story will be published next week.









CHAPTER FIVE


Jessica frantically pulled at her bonds which held her wrists behind her back and her head next to the floor.&nbsp; She could kick with her bare legs but as long as the noose around her neck ran through the steel ring in the floor she could not get anywhere.&nbsp; She had been tied up like this ever since she awoke.

Suddenly the warehouse's overhead lights flickered on and the ring holding her noose in place unhinged.&nbsp; As Jessica's eyes adjusted to the light, she realized that her noose was not connected to the ring; it only ran through it.&nbsp; The industrial strength rope seemed to be connected to something on the far side of the room, but it was too dark to see where it lead.

Just as Jessica stood up and was finally able to move around, she heard the sound of an engine in the distance.&nbsp; A moment later she felt a tug on the rope connected to her noose.&nbsp; Her first instinct was to resist being dragged into the darkness, but as she pulled back on the noose she felt it constrict around her neck.&nbsp; She realized that the only way to keep from choking to death was to keep pace with the slowly retracting rope.

Soon after Jessica stepped into the darkness the area before her became illuminated by another overhead spotlight.&nbsp; She was taken aback by what appeared to be an open sewer laid before her.&nbsp; Human feces filled the shallow ditch in the cement floor by several inches.&nbsp; Pipes ran back and forth along the narrow corridor.&nbsp; Some were iron pipes, split and leaking sewage - others seems to be leaking hot steam.

Jessica cried as her bare feet first made contact with the infectious human waste.&nbsp; The rope retracted at a glacial speed.&nbsp; In a panic she considered running ahead of the rope, even if it meant the pain of navigating the pipes ahead, if only to reduce the time she spent in the filth.&nbsp; But the thick rope had almost no bend to it - she was forced to be dragged along at the pace of the soulless, unyielding leash.&nbsp; She held her breath but even that couldn't take away the feeling and the stain of the feces splashing up to her knees.

Things went from bad to worse as she came to the series of pipes.&nbsp; She had to step over the first one - precariously balancing herself without the use of her arms as she made her way over the waist high pipe.&nbsp; As soon as she tossed her left leg over it she felt the oil and grease on the pipe cover her belly, things, and crotch.

She just barely got her right leg over in time before her leash pulled her to still more pipes.&nbsp; She ducked under the next one, having to bring her head just inches from the raw sewage.&nbsp; The next set of pipes contained several broken ones which slowly seeped shit onto the floor below.&nbsp; Jessica avoided some but couldn't avoid them all.&nbsp; One dropped soft feces directly onto her cleavage while another cut her along her left arm.&nbsp; Jessica screamed and stumbled along, finding it increasingly difficult to navigate the pipes.

The next two pipes Jessica squeezed between must have been steam pipes.&nbsp; She cried out as the pipes scalded her breasts, back, and ass as she pressed between them.&nbsp; More steam shot out and burned her naked thighs.&nbsp; Jessica doubled over in pain and without realizing it fell to her knees into some of the deepest part of the filth.&nbsp; Feces splashed up onto her chest and face as she screamed out in frustration.&nbsp; But still the rope lead on, through another set of broken pipes, then on into the darkness beyond.



CHAPTER SIX


Christine thought she would pass out from the unbearable pain of having her big toe crushed into a pulp.&nbsp; One time when she was young she had stubbed her toe and nearly lost a nail, but nothing compared to the inhuman sensation of a body part being flattened by a solid plate of metal.&nbsp; But somehow Christine held on.&nbsp; Her body was so pumped full of adrenaline and fear that she would never be able to escape into unconsciousness.

And neither would she be granted a reprieve from her torment, for as soon as the machine had finished smashing her poor toe into a bloody mess, the pressure plates on her temple began to squeeze again.&nbsp; Christine glanced down at the devices attached to her body to find the light indicating which new body part she would be forced to sacrifice to save her life.&nbsp; She was nearly out of fingers and toes - only her thumbs remained.

The sensor light above her left thumb was blinking.&nbsp; Christine, crying and cringing in a pathetic attempt to brace herself against the inevitable pain, pushed down on the switch for the 19th time.&nbsp; In a flash, the pain on her temples subsided, leaving behind only a dull throb.&nbsp; But then the pain began anew as two small sets of plates on either side of her thumb joint began their slow contraction.

Christine prayed that this time she would be strong enough.&nbsp; That her muscles and skin would not tear away, that her bones would not splinter and jab into the surrounding tissue.&nbsp; If only she tensed the muscles enough...

"NNNNNNNNEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!" Christine wailed as the thumb bones smashed and triggered pain nerves that no human being should ever have to feel.&nbsp; More and more the metal plates contracted, relentlessly pressing the splintered bone into her muscles and joints.&nbsp; She didn't want to look at the blood oozing out from her ruined thumb, or the discolored skin bulging and breaking obscenely.&nbsp; But she couldn't look away.&nbsp; She wanted to tell herself that this wasn't happening.&nbsp; That she would be rescued at any moment.&nbsp; That her body wasn't really as injured as she knew it to be.

But the machine gave her no time for reverie.&nbsp; Without pause it switched from crushing her fingers to crushing her temples, giving only the slightest of relief to her thumb.&nbsp; It seemed to position the plates just enough so that the bleeding was minimized and that the pain would lessen ever so slightly - all to keep her awake and alert for each new torture.

Christine considered letting the machine crush her skull.&nbsp; She just didn't want to be tortured anymore.&nbsp; But like a drowning man instinctively gasping for air, she pressed down on the life saving switch unconsciously.&nbsp; She didn't have the courage to face death.&nbsp; She would face anything but death.&nbsp; I'm such a coward, she bemoaned.

Again the machine crushed a delicate part of her lovely, tanned body, and again she screamed until she thought her lungs would bleed.&nbsp; The pain would be terrible, then after a few seconds would find a way to become worse.&nbsp; More blood leaked onto the rusted chair, more skin tore and distended to make room for the unyielding metal plates.

Next came more significant parts of her body.&nbsp; She had to choose her forearms next.

"GGGGGEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRR!!!" she screamed as her radial and ulna cracked and broke through the skin in an attempt to escape the pressure of the plates.&nbsp; The pain went on for so long and was so intense that she lost all track of time.

At last I'm free,&nbsp; she rejoiced.&nbsp; It seemed that all the little devices had run their course.&nbsp; She would be free.&nbsp; No more torture.&nbsp; No more pain! she swooned in her mind.

But as soon as she had sacrificed her remaining forearm, the familiar pressure against her temples returned.&nbsp; WHAT?? she screamed in her mind.&nbsp; There's nothing left.&nbsp; It's not fair.&nbsp; I played by the rules!

It was then that she realized that there were more devices she had missed before.&nbsp; In her constant state of panic and pain she hadn't seen them.&nbsp; They were right in front of her all along.&nbsp; I can't believe it, she thought.&nbsp; Not this... anything but this.

She stared in disbelief at the flashing light atop the device poised to crush her left nipple, then pressed down hard on the switch.




CHAPTER SEVEN


Nikki continued to struggle inch by agonizing inch along the sharp objects littering the filthy factory floor.

I can't take this, she thought.&nbsp; There's too much glass.&nbsp; Auughhh my tits are in so much pain.&nbsp; Owww another shard in my tit!

But somehow Nikki struggled onward, leaving behind an ever widening pool of blood to attract the increasingly veracious vermin.&nbsp; The rats forced her to keep moving, without taking time to carefully push aside any debris, or try to find the safest path.&nbsp; In her haste she sometimes brushed against the barbed wire overhead, badly cutting up her arms and leavings bits of flesh and blood on the barbs.&nbsp; 

Further and further she crawled.&nbsp;&nbsp; 10, 20, 30 feet, and still more to go.&nbsp; The sound of crushing glass and dragging metal was ever present, but it was the sounds of scurrying and squealing rats which terrified Nikki more than anything.&nbsp; She couldn't see them in the darkness, which only intensified her fears of what was preying on her vulnerable body.

"EEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGGGGGGGGGG!!!" she suddenly cried out as she felt a long, rusty hook dig deeply into her left breast.&nbsp; Most of her wounds were superficial but this thick hook pierced mammary tissue deep within.&nbsp; Although she could barely see through tears of indescribable pain, Nikki pressed on.&nbsp; I'm so close, she thought as she spurned herself on.&nbsp; Only 10 more feet.

But these 10 feet were worse than the previous 50 combined.&nbsp; Thin, 3 inch nails littered the floor, intermingled with bits of rusted barbed wire and the sharpest bits of metal.&nbsp; All of this rested atop a bed of finely ground glass, which tore into her skin like coarse sandpaper, but worse so because the glass embedded itself into her bloody skin.

The only thing that kept her moving was shear, willful determination and the lubrication provided by her own blood.&nbsp; Nearly every part of her body was red, from her face to her breasts, onto her stomach, her arms, her legs, her toes and feet.

"AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHGGGGGGGGGGG!!"&nbsp; With each squirm and gyration on the floor she screamed to deal with the pain, which mounted and mounted with each new nail plunged into her muscles, and each new layer of skin stripped off by the fine glass.

So close, she thought.&nbsp; I can see the end of the barbed wire.&nbsp; I made it!

But as she attempted to move the last two feet she felt a painful tug on the chain connected to the hook in her breast.&nbsp; She moved forward yet her tit was stuck in place.&nbsp; Under the bright light of the exit sign she could see that the hook was attached to a chain which reached far back in the distance.&nbsp; She couldn't move forward without taking out the hook, but with her hands bound behind her it was impossible.

"No, no, no! I was so close," she cried in exasperation, suddenly losing the willpower she had sustained to get her this far.

As she lay sobbing on the floor, the rats that had hounded her for so long suddenly attacked the near lifeless teenager.&nbsp; Nikki screamed anew as the rats tore into her shapely legs like lions on a fresh kill.&nbsp; She could feel strips of skin and muscles being torn from her things and calves, despite her best attempts to kick off her attackers.&nbsp; A few rats latched onto her supple toes.&nbsp; One tore out a nail, while another used its large teeth to severe her pinky toe.&nbsp; Nikki realized that she would be eaten alive if she didn't act fast.&nbsp; She did her best to kick off the rats and then pulled herself forward, in spite of the hook buried deep in her breast.

"EEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG!" she screamed through clenched teeth as she summoned every bit of willpower in her body to pull against the hook.&nbsp; As she pulled, the dull, rusty hook began slicing through her breast, coming down from the top and working its way through the middle of the breast.&nbsp; As it did so her breast began to split, and anyone standing nearby could see the muscles and mammary glands exposing themselves.

Young Nikki never fathomed that such pain existed, but she continued to pull against the chain, feeling slight progress in spite of the immense resistance of the hook.&nbsp; After a full minute of pulling against the hook she was free, leaving behind a fair amount of blood and fresh mammary tissue attached to the hook.&nbsp; But the sudden release made her fall forward, directly onto her breasts.&nbsp; Her right boob, it's insides completely exposed, fell directly onto several sharp pieces of metal.

"AAAAAAAAAAAEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!"&nbsp; Nikki blacked out momentary from the indescribably pain she felt in her tit.&nbsp; The rats have her no pause as she lay sobbing, losing all strength to resist.&nbsp; In a mindless haze she crawled forward, her bloody, shredded body slowly making its way through the exit door.

As the door closed, leaving behind the rats and so many beautiful layers of skin, Nikki finally passed out, awaiting to face the final horrors ahead. 











CHAPTER EIGHT


Jessica was making it through the horrible sunken corridor filled with sewage, steam, and broken metal pipes relatively unscathed.&nbsp; Her athletic body allowed her to contort herself in many useful ways, allowing her to dodge hanging pipes and squeeze through tight spaces.

But before the tunnel ended she was faced with an impenetrable wall of steam from at least a dozen pipes, leaving no room for her to dodge their murderous sprays.&nbsp; As her chain dragged her relentlessly towards the steam, Jessica cried and tried to mentally brace herself for the steam bath.&nbsp; When she felt the steam burn her upper body, arms, and legs, she let out an unholy wail of agony.&nbsp; Never could she imagine that such pain existed as she was experiencing right now.&nbsp; And yet she was passing through just the first of a dozen pipes.&nbsp; She knew she would not survive.

In a reflex, and against every sense of humanity in her body, she forced her body head first into the slime she had been crawling through, desperate to escape the burning steam.&nbsp; For nearly two minutes the girl held her breath under the surface of the sewage, using it as protection from the steam.&nbsp; But nothing had prepared her for the disgusting sensations of human waste coating every inch of her body.&nbsp; She felt the fluids enter her ears and slither into her nostrils.&nbsp; The slime burned her eyes and partly entered her mouth, forcing her to fight her gag reflex with all her might.

She didn't know how long she'd have to stay under, so she stayed until her lungs felt as if there were going to explode.&nbsp; Then, with the same unconscious impulse that plunged her into the sewage, she bounded above the surface, oblivious to the potential danger above.&nbsp; She leaped up and took a giant gasp of air, swallowing chunks of sewage as she did so.&nbsp; The steam burned her slightly, but only her backside.&nbsp; She had made it through the steam just in time.

As she shook her head from side to side to flake off as much of the filth as possible, Jessica was able to open her eyes and see the end of the tunnel.&nbsp; Soon she was out of the tunnel, free of the river of slime and the broken iron pipes.&nbsp; She was in an open warehouse now.&nbsp; It was too dark for she to see much more than a few feet in front of her.&nbsp; She moved along trepidatiously, fearing some new horror awaiting her.




CHAPTER NINE


Christine pressed down hard on the switch, condemning her right nipple to be flattened to a meaty pulp, just as she had recently done to her left.&nbsp; The strong metal plates crushed her areolas until the skin split and the beautiful flesh was disfigured before her eyes.&nbsp; Christine screamed ceaselessly during the entire 60 second process, but no amount of vocal release could mitigate the tremendous pain sensations she now felt at the tips of both of her beautiful c-cup breasts.

Even as the metal plates on her temples renewed their deadly movements, Christine could only look onward in a daze.&nbsp; Her mind was nearly shattered by the trauma of seeing so many beautiful parts of her young body being mangled beyond recognition.&nbsp; Her wide eyes stared ahead unblinkingly, her pupils contracted into tiny dots.

When the machine finished its callous work on her nipples and renewed its attack on her temples, she had no will to continue on.&nbsp; The pain in her skull felt almost reassuring, giving her some sense of release from the throbbing sensations emanating from the rest of her body.&nbsp; But just as her mind was about to succumb to the pressure against it, her jaws clenched and she smashed her disfigured foot on the pedal.&nbsp; Like a man about to die from holding his breath too long, her reflexes would not allow her to die so easily.

Christine didn't look down as the two large plates began crushing her left breast from the sides.&nbsp; The plates moved at an agonizingly slow rate, almost imperceptibly.&nbsp; It took a minute for the plates to make any real progress, and her boob, flexible as it was, was not in too much pain.&nbsp; The second minute was a bit worse; her breast was slightly distended and turning purple.&nbsp; Stretch marks formed along the tit and the pressure inside increased.&nbsp; 

Christine grit her teeth and tightened all her muscles in response to the assault on her helpless tit.&nbsp; But no amount of exertion could reduce the horrifying feeling of having her tit crushed to the bursting point.&nbsp; The skin began to split along the stretch marks, oozing blood and tissue over her chest and stomach.

�AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!�

Christine's eyes appeared to nearly burst from their sockets as every ounce of strength left in her body attempted to break free of her restraints.&nbsp; Veins pulsated obscenely in her neck and arms and she tried futilely to fight the incredible sensation of having her breast crushed almost flat.&nbsp; Delirious from the pain, Christine appeared to be foaming at the mouth as she screamed.

Long into the fifth and final minute the plates relentlessly crushed the raw tit meat inside her ruined breast.&nbsp; They crushed the internal muscles and raw nerve endings deep inside of her.&nbsp; She would have screamed anew if she hadn't just burst her vocal chords.

The destruction of her right breast was just as excruciating, if not worse.&nbsp; Blood and saliva dripped down her chin as she bit through her lower lip during the process.&nbsp; She blacked out from the pain at some point, but still ever more pain shocked her back into consciousness in time for her to see blood and mammary glands burst from the split skin of the breast.

After her second breast was finally flattened and destroyed the plates on her temples renewed their movement once more.&nbsp; WHAT ELSE IS LEFT??? I DON'T SEE ANYTHING, her mind screamed.&nbsp; She was beyond caring, almost eager to further destroy her body now, hoping the mutilation would finally give her the sweat release of death.&nbsp; She knew in the back of her mind that these tortures wouldn't kill her though, and that her blood loss was minor, but she wanted to believe otherwise.

She pressed down on the switch the 27th and final time, without any clue as to what part of her body she was condemning to destruction.

When she felt the pressure in her vagina her heart sank.&nbsp; No, no, no, no it can't be it can't... she pleaded in her mind.&nbsp; She realized now why she couldn't see the final device: it was just under her shorts, with one plate inside her vagina and the other one of just below her pubic mound.&nbsp; The device was positioned to crush her clitoris into the g-spot inside, pulverizing the flesh and bone in between.

Nothing could prepare Christine for the pain she felt during those fifteen minutes of excruciating agony.&nbsp; Several times she vomited what little bile and stomach acid remained in her stomach, burning her throat and lips.&nbsp; When nothing was left she dry heaved to the point of hyperventilation.&nbsp; Her face turned white from shock and sweat poured from every gland in her body.&nbsp; When she wasn't screaming through her burst vocal chords she was biting down hard on her lips or tongue in an effort to block out the pain.&nbsp; At one point she shit and pissed herself.&nbsp; Her entire body shook like it was in epileptic shock.

By the end she had bitten threw her lips and had clenched her teeth so hard that some of her molars had cracked under the pressure.&nbsp; Her entire body was covered in blood, sweat, vomit, and other bodily fluids.

As the plates came to a stop the air pressure machine let out a final hiss, releasing the pressure on all of the devices attached to Christine's body and snapping open the restraints which locked the teen to the metal chair.&nbsp; But she had mercifully fainted from the cumulative pain of having every sensitive part of her body slowly mutilated.&nbsp; If she had remained conscious she might have had time to get up and escape.&nbsp; Instead, the masked giant came back for her, and took her away into the deep recesses of the complex. 




CHAPTER TEN


Jessica limped along towards the end of the tunnel.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bruised, cut, exhausted, and covered in filth, Jessica was nearly out of strength.&nbsp;&nbsp; She wanted nothing more than to sit down, just for one moment.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the cable attached to the noose around her neck dragged her relentlessly forward.&nbsp;&nbsp; A few times she nearly stumbled and choked half to death, but always she found the renewed energy to move forward.

When Jessica stepped out of the tunnel and into the large warehouse room she was overwhelmed with joy.&nbsp;&nbsp; She could smell fresh air; she could walk on smooth, dry ground; and she didn't have to weave and dodge through an obstacle course of deadly metal piping.&nbsp;&nbsp; She walked with renewed energy and confidence.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, she was in pain and felt ill from vomiting so much, but she sensed that the worst was over.&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon this perverse obstacle course would be over and she could find a way out of this place.&nbsp;&nbsp; If only it wasn't so dark, she lamented, then I could actually see where I'm going. 

As if in answer to her unspoken thoughts, the area ahead suddenly illuminated with dim overhead lights.&nbsp;&nbsp; One by one lights clicked on, showing more and more of the clear path ahead, until stopping at the end of the room.&nbsp;&nbsp; There Jessica saw the end of the long rope that had been pulling her all this time.&nbsp;&nbsp; A large rotating wheel cranked ever so slowly, coiling the rope around it.&nbsp;&nbsp; But before the rope wrapped around the wheel, it made a final pass through a set of iron bars, which allowed the rope to pass through but would surely prevent Jessica from passing through.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the bars weren't Jessica's true worry.&nbsp;&nbsp; No, young Jessica was too concerned about the 4 inch spikes protruding all along the bars.&nbsp;&nbsp; The girl was being dragged to an inevitable impalement on dozens of nasty spikes, and there was nothing she could do to stop it.

In a panic the teen pulled on the cord, digging her bare heals into the hard concrete floor and using all her might to stop the wheel from retracting further.

"Noooo!&nbsp; Nooo!!!&nbsp; Oh my GOD!&nbsp; Make it stop!&nbsp; It's going to kill me, make it STOP!!"

The only answer to her pleas was the grinding sound of the wheel continuing its slow, inexorable rotation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even with adrenaline pumping through her veins and the mad determination to live overpowering any worry about straining her muscles or tendons, no amount of pulling could stop the machine.

Closer and closer it pulled her to the spiked metal bars.&nbsp;&nbsp; Jessica realized that she would have to prepare herself for the inevitable.&nbsp;&nbsp; She would have to brace herself for the spikes; try to position herself so that they wouldn't puncture her lungs or heart or anything vital.&nbsp;&nbsp; As she got closer she tried to position herself to protect her eyes and her neck, yet still she was sweating in fear of the tremendous pain she would soon be subjected to.

Jessica was now only a foot away from the spikes.&nbsp;&nbsp; The wheel seemed to be rotating slower than before, almost imperceptibly.&nbsp;&nbsp; It would give Jessica more time to position herself, but it would also drag out the pain.

Six inches to go.&nbsp;&nbsp; Three inches.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the first spikes touched her perky tits, 3 in each.&nbsp;&nbsp; Jessica screamed in torment as she felt the sharp metal inch its way into her delicate breasts.&nbsp;&nbsp; The spikes widened slightly as they got closer to the base, stretching and tearing the holes they made in her lithe body and she pressed against them.

In a desperate effort to fend off the pain Jessica pushed against the bars with her hands, but there was no place for her to put her hands that were not covered in spikes.&nbsp;&nbsp; As she pressed futilely against the steel the several spikes pierced through her hands and she howled in pain.&nbsp;&nbsp; More spikes dug into her arms and her legs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Several large spikes entered her belly as she screamed and screamed and screamed.

As Jessica was pressed closer and closer against the bars, the spikes worked their way deep into her flesh, some digging into bone and piercing nerves deep in the recesses of her body.&nbsp;&nbsp; Both of her nipples were impaled on 4 inch spikes, moving ever deeper into the core of her intimate body parts.

Jessica retained consciousness up until the point where both her labia and her vagina were skewered on the spikes.&nbsp;&nbsp; As they worked their way into her love canal she let out one final, primal scream and then blacked out - her eyes glazed over and her tongue hanging limp from her mouth.

Then the machine came to an abrupt stop.&nbsp;&nbsp; The monstrous man who had tormented the other girls came into the room, detached Jessica's collar and began to slowly pull her unconscious form from the metal frame.&nbsp;&nbsp; Blood leaked out of her puncture wounds and pooled on the floor by her impaled feet.&nbsp;&nbsp; But she did not lose enough to kill her.&nbsp;&nbsp; He needed her alive for the final test that was to come.











CHAPTER ELEVEN


Jessica awoke, cold and in pain.&nbsp;&nbsp; Where am I? she wondered.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, I feel so stiff.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh my God, I'm bleeding.&nbsp;&nbsp; Why are there so many bandages around me.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ow...

Jessica moaned in pain as she attempted to move around.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bandages covered many parts of her body: her hands, feet, thighs, breasts, stomach, crotch, almost everywhere.&nbsp;&nbsp; They were clearly makeshift, and some were very blood-soaked.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've got to get to a hospital.

Jessica sat up and gasped as she saw she was not alone.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nikki and Christine were also laying on the floor a few feet away from her.&nbsp;&nbsp; They too were bandaged like her.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nikki was partially wake but absorbed in her own pain.&nbsp;&nbsp; Christine was out cold.

"Nikki, Nikki," she whispered.

Nikki looked up.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh Jessica!&nbsp; Thank goodness you're alive!&nbsp; We have to get out of here."

Jessica slid over to her friend and tried to help her sit up.&nbsp;&nbsp; "C'mon," Jessica said, "we have to help Chris."

The girls sat on either side of Christine, gently rocking her and cooing her name.

"Ugh, uh, what?," mumbled Christine as she gradually awoke.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh guys, guys help me, I hurt so bad..."&nbsp; Jessica and Nikki had noticed that Christine looked to be in worse shape than either of them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her hands and feet were heavily bandaged, and her breasts were bleeding through the gauss.

"We'll get you out Chrissie," assured Jessica.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get up, we have to get up."&nbsp; The two girls tried to help her up but when Christine put weight on her feet, pain shot up her body and she collapsed to the ground, crying.

"Welcome!" a deep, sinister voice boomed over an audio system somewhere in the room.

"What was that?" Nikki asked aloud.&nbsp;&nbsp; The lights in the room turned on, revealing that the 3 hapless girls were in a round storage room.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the center of the room was a canvas draped over a very large object.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was only one door to the room.&nbsp;&nbsp; Jessica ran over to it and tried to turn the knob but it was obviously locked.

"I know you must be eager to leave," continued the voice.&nbsp;&nbsp; "But to understand where you are going, you must know where you have been."

"Where are you, you bastard!&nbsp; Let us out!" screamed Nikki.

"Your arrival here was no accident," the voice continued, oblivious to Nikki's outburst.&nbsp;&nbsp; "You were bought and sold, by a friend, no less.&nbsp;&nbsp; A very, unscrupulous friend."

"Who are you talking about?" Nikki cried out yet again.

"I think it's just a recording, Nikki," Jessica said.

"Your friend wanted you all to die.&nbsp;&nbsp; For a modest sum, she delivered you to me, for my...&nbsp; entertainment.&nbsp;&nbsp; I must admit, I didn't expect you all to live, but here you are.&nbsp;&nbsp; So I'm offering you a chance for freedom.&nbsp;&nbsp; You need only to take that freedom from the one who deserves it the least."

A chain in the ceiling began to retract, taking along with it the canvas covering.&nbsp;&nbsp; The girls looked on in disbelief at what they saw.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was their closest friend, the one who was with them in the car accident.&nbsp; Here she was, naked and chained spread eagle to a pair of vertical bars.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her entire body was crisscrossed with cuts from a scalpel, which formed a series of squares and triangles all over her body.&nbsp;&nbsp; She looked at the trio imploringly, but she said nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her mouth was held open by a metal ring gag connected to a metal brace around her head.

"Don't feel too bad for Amanda," continued the voice.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Those cuts are far less painful than the torments you have had to face."
"Inserted beneath her skin, hidden among one of the many sections of flesh outlined for you, is the key to the door behind you.&nbsp;&nbsp; Remove the outer layer of deciet to find the salvation within."

"No, no, no," cried Christine, "This can't be happening..."

"You must hurry though.&nbsp;&nbsp; The room you are in is airtight.&nbsp;&nbsp; You've been in here for several hours.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oxygen will run out by 1 o'clock."&nbsp; Then the speaker went dead.

Four pairs of eyes examined the clock atop the door.

12:41.




CHAPTER TWELVE


"We need to find the key, hurry!" said a panicked Nikki as she moved next to Amanda's tied up body.

"We can't just mutilate Amanda.&nbsp;&nbsp; There's got to be some other way," interjected Jessica, rushing to her friend's side.&nbsp;&nbsp; "See if you can feel for a bump."

Both girls ran their hands along Amanda's skin and over her cuts, feeling for any kind of bump to give them a hint.&nbsp;&nbsp; They checked her stomach, back, legs, and even breasts, but they couldn't feel any bumps nor did they see anything that looked like one.&nbsp;&nbsp; Jessica looked into Amanda's eyes, hoping to get some hint from her friend's reaction.&nbsp;&nbsp; It appeared that Amanda was completely unaware of its location, and from the desperate look she gave Jessica, she was clearly hoping she wouldn't find out.

12:46.

"There's got to be some way to get you out!" cried Jessica as she pulled on the chains binding Amanda's nude form in place.&nbsp;&nbsp; But there was no way she could see a way to break open the iron bindings around her ankles and wrists.&nbsp;&nbsp; They looked to be welded shut - not even a key or wrench could free her.&nbsp;&nbsp; Amanda was clearly not meant to escape...

12:49.

"I, I'm having trouble breathing," moaned Nikki.&nbsp;&nbsp; As she struggled to take a deep breath the other girls also noticed the lack of air.&nbsp;&nbsp; Time was indeed running out.

"JUST DO IT!"

The sudden yell from the heretofore silent Christine startled them all.&nbsp;&nbsp; Christine looked up at them from the floor, herself barely able to get up because of her injuries.

"Just get the key.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's all her fault we're here.&nbsp;&nbsp; It doesn't matter if she gets hurt.&nbsp;&nbsp; Look at me!&nbsp; Look at what she's done to me...&nbsp; Fuck her!&nbsp; Who cares if she suffers."

Both Jessica and Nikki looked into Amanda's eyes one last time, as if hoping to get some sense of permission from their gagged friend's eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp; But they saw only panic and terror.&nbsp;&nbsp; Amanda shook her head and tried to yell through her gag to tell them to stop but it was unintelligible.&nbsp;&nbsp; All she could do was cry and pull weakly at her bonds.&nbsp;&nbsp; She was spread so taught that if the girls did pull at her flesh, she could not twist away to fight them.

"She's right," admitted Nikki.&nbsp;&nbsp; "We've all had to suffer because of her.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it's her turn.&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't feel bad, Jess."

Nikki was the first to pull at the tender layer of Amanda's soft skin.&nbsp;&nbsp; She picked a piece of her back, hoping to mutilate her friend without having to look into her eyes.

"EEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!"

Amanda's scream was inhuman sounding at such a high volume through the gag.&nbsp;&nbsp; Saliva shot out around the gag and her eyes bulged obscenely, as if hoping to escape a body filled with such ungodly pain.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nikki continued to pull at the stubborn flap of skin, amazed at how hard it was to pull off.&nbsp;&nbsp; The skin was slippery with sweat and blood, and it took almost all of her strength to pull it off.

12:54.

"Help me damn it!" Nikki yelled through a haze of remorseful tears.

"Jessica, please," pleaded Christine.&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want her to pay.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please, make her pay..."

Jessica tried not to think about the horrible pain Amanda must have been going through.&nbsp;&nbsp; She tried not to hear her tortuous screams; she tried not to look at the increasing amount of mutilated flesh being torn from her torso and limbs.&nbsp;&nbsp; She tried not to feel the slick, warm blood coating her hands and arms and feet as she skinned her former friend alive.&nbsp;&nbsp; She told herself that it was only right.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was Amanda's fault that she had to swallow foul sewer waste and have her body burned and sliced and stabbed.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was her fault she was here in the first place.

But why did she do it?&nbsp; wondered Jessica.&nbsp;&nbsp; What's the motive?&nbsp; And why did she get double-crossed?&nbsp; What if -

"I FOUND IT!"&nbsp; Nikki screamed as pulled a skeleton key from the bloody mess that was once Amanda's right knee.&nbsp;&nbsp; In a mad dash for the door, stumbling along the way from exhaustion and lack of air, Nikki brought the key to the door, and as the clock turned 1 o'clock, the door clicked open and desperately needed oxygen filled the room.&nbsp;&nbsp; The three surviving girls were free, stumbling out into the city streets to find desperately needed help.




EPILOGUE


"Lieutenant, take a look at this."&nbsp; The female police sergeant handed the lead detective a VHS tape.&nbsp; It was unmarked, but judging from the few pieces of camera and recording equipment found at the crime scene, it was clearly created by the perpetrators.

"Let's pop it in the TV we found in the room next to the warehouse area.&nbsp; Maybe it will give us some clues to what happened in this godforsaken place."

The leading police members on the case gathered into the dusty room, decorated with schematics for a strange chair connected to chords and pumps, and other various drawings and plans.&nbsp; The detective's partner popped in the tape and the old Zenith lit up.&nbsp; The crowd gave a light gasp as they recognized the girl chained to the poles - she was definitely the dead girl they had found missing over half her skin.&nbsp; In this video she was alive though, alive and frightened to tears.

"Why?&nbsp; Why are you doing this?&nbsp; What do you want?&nbsp; Please don't hurt me..." sobbed the teen.

"I'm not the one who is going to hurt you, Amanda," replied a dark, unidentifiable voice from off camera.&nbsp; "It's your friends.&nbsp; I'm afraid, they are going to hurt you more than you could ever imagine."

"What?&nbsp; What have you done to them?&nbsp; What are you saying?&nbsp; They would never -"

"Oh, I expect that they will.&nbsp; See, I'm going to tell them a little white lie.&nbsp; Just like the same little white lies you've been telling your whole life."&nbsp; There was a long pause.&nbsp; "Don't you think that's only fair, Amanda?"

"What?&nbsp; Stay away from me."&nbsp; A large figure walked into camera view, his back to the camera.&nbsp; "Oh my God help!&nbsp; Someone!&nbsp; Please - "

The tape ended there, abruptly cutting to digital snow.

"It must be the same guy," Remarked the lieutenant.&nbsp; "It fits all the descriptions: deep, guttural voice... young female victims, elaborate torture scenes.&nbsp; All girls picked at random, without any previous associations."

"Well, whoever he is he's getting a lot more sophisticated.&nbsp; The stories the girls told sounded more vicious than anything I've heard of on these cases," remarked a fellow officer.

"I'll take this tape downtown," the sergeant said, reaching for the VCR.&nbsp; "I'll show it to the girls.&nbsp; Maybe they can help us identify the man."

"Maybe.&nbsp; Don't count on it," said the lieutenant, half yawning.&nbsp; Apathy was a necessary defense for these types of cases.&nbsp; "I doubt the tape will help with much of anything, except maybe produce more nightmares."

"Well," responded the sergeant, "if you murdered your best friend by mistake, wouldn't you have trouble sleeping through the night, too?"
