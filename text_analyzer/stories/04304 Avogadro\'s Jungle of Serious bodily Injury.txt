�Cannibal Women of Avogodro�s Jungle of Lethal
Bodily Injury

(3/20/06 version)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I� First Contact

&nbsp;

Lewis Merriwether and Clark
Williams followed the trail with enthusiasm and skill.� They were the best of the third platoon of
Easy Company, of the 11th Special Forces Battalion, the best of the
best.� They picked their way cautiously
through the thick brush, following the signal from the transponder hidden in
that feminazi Professor Francine Kurtz�s baggage, one month ago. A full,
heavily armed platoon of Special Forces ought to be more than a match for a few
hundred three-quarters naked, female savages. 

&nbsp;

�The Transport Portal had a refractory period
proportional to the square of the number of living beings transported.� A platoon-sized unit of forty men might be
sent once a month.� A company size unit
of 200 men might be sent once each two years unless balanced by a simultaneous
return transit.� The soldiers sent to
Alternate Earth were truly isolated.�
They had no way to communicate back home, except by a physical message.

&nbsp;

����������� Clark
heard the roar of the waterfall first.�
Next, Lou swore that he heard exuberant female laughter.�� Clark crept past him
to look down the embankment and saw two dozen, stunningly attractive young
women cavorting naked and carefree in the crystal clear pool beneath the
beautiful waterfall.� Lou joined him and
the two grinned ear to ear at the engaging sight before them.� Honey brown skin covered enticing female
forms.� Dark hair framed attractive faces
illuminated by bright smiles and laughter.�
Youthful breasts shook and jiggled as they played.� Some women swam gracefully.� Through the crystal clear water, the men
could see their shapely bottoms. 

&nbsp;

����������� Clark
simply forgot himself and his peril.� He
just stood up.� Somehow, his camouflage suit
kept him hidden from the inattentive women in the water, but not from the
mosquitoes or from the women�s lookouts.�
�Damn mosquitoes,� he whispered hoarsely.� He was as honestly surprised as anyone when a
feathered arrow blossomed from his chest.�
Flabbergasted, he opened his mouth to speak. A second arrow appeared
beside the first.�� No further sound
emerged except for wet gurgles and he drooled frothy blood.� One arrow had pierced his lung.� The other had pierced his heart. Strength
fled from his limbs and he simply toppled over dead onto Lou�s prone form.

&nbsp;

����������� Lou felt Clark�s
full weight fall dead upon him.� He
wrestled free and saw the dead man�s glassy stare.� He crawled out from under his friend�s body.
He raised his rifle and searched for the attacker.� He saw nothing.� The birds still rested quietly on their
perches.� Another arrow whizzed by his
ear and he just turned and ran. A cloud of birds erupted into the sky, flashing
colorful feathers and screaming raucously.�


&nbsp;

����������� Lou
dashed through the jungle and wondered briefly if these savages set traps like
other primitive people.� He turned
briefly and saw a scantily clad woman bearing a bow emerged from cover and sop
and take aim.� Then he saw several more
following armed with bows or spears and shields.� The chase was on.� The dense foliage kept Lou to a narrow game
trail.� The rain forest enclosed the
twisting trail like the walls of a tunnel.�
He cursed when he saw signs of a pit-fall trap dug right on his path. He
looked for any hint of a path through the brush.� He felt like he was already trapped within
the walls of cage and panicked.� He saw a
hint of a narrow passage and cut sharply to his left.� He crashed through outreaching leaves and
branches.� About 10 meters down the
narrow track, he stepped in an unseen snare and was jerked abruptly from his
feet.� 

&nbsp;

He hung head down, suspended by
one ankle with his hands a tantalizing foot above the ground.� He was screaming and yelling still when
warriors emerged from the jungle.� 

&nbsp;

Rihali had had hopes that they
might use this male to carry the other�s heavy carcass back to the
village.� Even bled and gutted, the other
one promised to be onerous on the long trek home.� Lou�s houting did not abate and Mihali cut
his throat simply to stop his racket.�
She had both carcasses gutted, skinned and quartered.� Runners took 4 quarters and both of skins to
the chief village.�� Of the three Annu�i
hamlets, two received haunches and one received a full saddle.� The forequarters were reserved for the
warriors� families. Mihali and her band set out to locate any other
invaders.� She had never seen males like
this � either among her people the Annu�i or even among the hated Annu�lu.

&nbsp;




II� The Kappa Klappa House

&nbsp;

�So you went to that �get together�
at the old Kappa Kappa house?� asked Ashley.

&nbsp;

Meaghan nodded, yes.

&nbsp;

�Remember, it�s called the old
Kappa �Klappa� house � the major source of sexually transmitted disease on
campus � �Kappa Klappa� � get it?� said Hannah, proudly wearing her Sigma Tau
Delta � STD - sweat shirt

&nbsp;

�Yeah, Professor Marlow from my
Women�s Studies course recommended that we go and meet those women from the
Alternate Earth.� Meaghan replied.� She
slapped at a mosquito and continued.��
�Kim Hunter, her doctoral student, is actually living with them. There�re
about a half-dozen visitors and a half dozen grad students staying there now.
And well, here�s the story as best as I understand it.� Professor Karen Marlow led an expedition to
rescue Professor Francine Kurtz � as if Kurtz needed rescuing in the first
place. Marlow acted in good faith, but she was set up by the CIA.� In the end, the Annu�I women pretty much
ended up saving themselves and Professors Kurtz and Marlow too.� When the smoke cleared, the government was
just about as embarrassed as a government can be.� Marlow got a lease on the old Kappa Kappa
house � you remember � the fraternity that was closed down in the date rape
scandal.� It�s an embassy of some sort;
it was really pretty neat.� On their
world, the women run everything.� Society
protects and nurtures women and children.�
They have peace and no war.�
Violent crime is almost nonexistent.�
The environment is protected and no one is afraid.� It�s really hard to believe.� 

&nbsp;

�The US
army thought that they would be easy pickings but they were wrong � twice, if I
remember.�� Hannah recalled

&nbsp;

�I heard they�re cannibals,�
Cameron offered.� �Really!� she insisted,
seeing disbelief on the others� faces.

&nbsp;

Meaghan shook her head forcefully.

&nbsp;

�Well, maybe not exactly
cannibals.� The women kill and, uh, eat
their males,� Cameron continued. 

&nbsp;

Hannah couldn�t restrain her grin.

&nbsp;

�� not like that!� Hannah, can�t you get your mind out of the
gutter!�� Uh, like praying mantises or,
ugh black widow spiders.� Their males and
not each other � ugh.� Cameron corrected herself. 

&nbsp;

�That�s just an accusation,�
Meaghan responded.� �That�s the kind of
rumor that racists and, fascists always spread about the �others,� the
�OTHERS,� you know.�� They say that Jews
eat Christian blood in their unleavened bread. They say that the Aztecs were
cannibals.�

&nbsp;

�Well, what I heard was that the US
Expeditionary force was cut off and captured to the man, somehow.� Our government wanted to ask for an exchange
of prisoners, but first they discovered that we had no one who could talk to
the Annu�i and then they discovered that we had no prisoners to trade.� We had nothing else that they wanted in
particular either.� In the end, the
prisoners were auctioned off and sold, uh, as livestock, they say. Tell
me.� Did you eat anything when you were
at the old Kappa Klappa House?� asked Hannah suspiciously.

&nbsp;

�Not much. They served some sort
small chunks of meats to roast on skewers over a small charcoal fire � a
hibachi.� They some sort of had sweet
potato tortillas and all kinds of sauces for dipping � tropical fruits �
avocado, tamarind, mango, papaya, and pineapple. It was really delicious!�
concluded Meaghan with some satisfaction

&nbsp;

Just what kind of meat was it?� Where did it come from?� asked Hannah.

&nbsp;

Meaghan really didn�t know and it
hadn�t even occurred to her to ask.� �No,
it couldn�t be!�� She had been hungry and
the meat was delicious � like pork, only sweeter.

&nbsp;




&nbsp;

III The Village

&nbsp;

Professor Karen Marlow, Kimberly
Hunter, and Bunny Greenberg slowly overcame the disorientation of transport and
followed the female warriors back to their village. They had passed through the
Portal without incident and were famished after a long day on the trail. They
reached the village only at dusk.

&nbsp;

Professor Kurtz had preceded them
by a full year.� Two scouts and an entire
platoon of marines - now lost - had followed her arrival by 10 months. The
military insisted that they had sent two scouts only to rescue Professor Kurtz
and the platoon only to try to rescue the scouts.� Professor Marlow had first asked why they
thought that Professor Kurtz needed rescue, but in the end, she had offered to
learn about the marines and extracted a solemn promise that there would be no
further military interventions before undertaking her expedition.� It was her one and only nonnegotiable demand.

&nbsp;

The Annu�i tribeswomen had met them
at the Portal on their arrival.�
Obviously, they had been watching the Portal. Once on the trail, they
kept up a ferocious pace.� They stopped
only once when their leader retrieved some plant or other in the jungle.� The tribeswomen were obviously used to the
pace.� Kim Hunter demonstrated her grit
and regular exercise.� Despite her seeming
frailty, Bunny kept up too.� She worked
out regularly too.� Only Professor Marlow
did not work out regularly and she suffered.��
Rahali, their leader, hoped to reach the village by dusk and drove them
mercilessly.� A plague of mosquitoes only
added to their torment.

&nbsp;

As they trotted through the
village, the Professor saw women of all ages.�
She saw young women holding their infants to their breasts, women
sitting in groups in front of their huts pursuing this craft or that, and old
grannies standing in small groups and chatting, now that their day�s work had
come to an end. Hair color and skin tones varied, although all were deeply
tanned by the sun.� She saw naked
children of both genders playing energetically amidst their elders. Older girls
wore no more than loincloths.� Young
women wore short aprons or lappets. Many were bare-breasted. Older women wore
long skirts of beaten bark and brightly colored vests.� However, she saw no men and no boys past the
age of toddlers.� Older males all lived
in the male compound, she was told, except for a small number of young men kept
in the main village.

&nbsp;

����������� Several
wicker huts were grouped around a central larger hut.� Flowers were everywhere.� Along with their perfumed fragrances, the
hungry Professor could smell the enticing aroma of roasting meat.� In order to reach the village by dusk, Rahali
had not allowed the party to stop for more than 5 minutes since they had broken
camp in the faint glow before dawn.� The
aroma of food made them all the more hungry.�
The gnawing hunger was akin to pain for those unused to deprivation.

&nbsp;

����������� Rahali and
Mihali led the strangers directly to the central hut. She motioned that they
might take off their packs and enter.���
Packs were heaped beside the entrance.�
Much relieved they entered the hut. Inside, bare-breasted young women in
brief lappets handed them gourds holding fresh, cold water.� Never had simple water tasted so
refreshing.� Others proffered wicker
trays with smoked meat.� The meat was
chewy but delicious too. 

&nbsp;

����������� Without
fanfare, an older woman emerged from an inner chamber of the hut. Her name was
Aratti, the head-woman of the village, and with her was none other than the
long lost Professor Francine Kurtz.� The
Professor, her petite frame barely containing her fierce will, looked tanned
and fit and none the worse for her ordeal. She wore neatly pressed cotton
slacks and a clean white tee-shirt.� Her
deep brown eyes and close cropped black hair gleamed in the light of oil lamps.
She appeared quite well and in no distress of any kind.

����������� 

����������� �Karen!�
she exclaimed.� �Fancy meeting you
here.� Welcome to the village of the
Annu�i.�� The women embraced briefly.

&nbsp;

����������� �Glad to be
here,� Karen answered after she had swallowed a second morsel of the succulent
meat. Karen had a light brown hair, a medium build and stood a head
taller.� �Good to see you too!� We were so afraid for you.� Look�s like you�re in better shape than we
are.� Tell me, will I have any chance
soon to take off my boots and wash my filthy body.� I was really supposed to rescue you, but it
almost appears that you had no need of rescue.�

&nbsp;




IV En

&nbsp;

Mihali conducted Professor Marlow
to one hut while Istari conducted Kim and Bunny to a second hut to prepare
themselves for the welcoming feast.�
Mihali motioned for the Professor to sit, then clapped her hands and a
young man entered.� She smiled at the
woman�s reaction.� The man was completely
naked.� His strong body was unmarked,
unlike the women who affected various piercings and body paint.� Unexpectedly, Mihali left Karen to her own
devices.� Karen suddenly wished that the
Annu�i woman had stayed.

&nbsp;

����������� The youth
knelt before the Professor.� She tried to
mask her unease with his casual nudity, mocking her own cultural rigidity.� In her world, male nudity was a threat. She
looked down at him and pointed to her self � �Karen,� she said.� She pointed at him and asked,� �What�s your name?�� She spoke very slowly and distinctly, as if
that might overcome the difference in language.

&nbsp;

����������� He looked
at her with a puzzled expression and smiled. �En,� he said quietly.� �My name is En.� How do you do?� Please, let me help you with your boots.�

&nbsp;

����������� His strong
hands felt good on her tired feet and legs.�
The Professor couldn�t help seeing.�
His heavy sex hung blatantly between his muscular thighs.� She tried not to stare. She wished again that
Mihali had stayed.

&nbsp;

����������� �How did
you learn English?� she asked.

&nbsp;

����������� �My mother
and my aunts housed a number of the outlander males our warriors had
captured.� I learned English from them.� 

&nbsp;

����������� En asked
her to follow from the hut and she complied.

&nbsp;

����������� �Where are
they now?� the Professor asked, but En just smiled and kept walking. They
entered a hut that boasted a large tub of warm water.� The immanent opportunity for a bath quickly
distracted her from her half-hearted interrogation. She was surprised when En
offered to help her disrobe.� But he was
naked already, she figured, and here people apparently had few reservations
about nudity.� She briefly wondered how
she might look in comparison with the lithe and fit tribeswomen whom she had
seen. 

&nbsp;

The Professor soaked in the warm,
fragrant water.� A seemingly endless
relay of laughing, chatting, young women carried in buckets of hot water and
made her luxurious bath possible. The warmth penetrated the tired muscles of
her calves and legs.� En�s strong fingers
loosened her tired muscles.� The warmth
soothed her much abused feet. She closed her eyes and rested.� She closed her eyes and welcomed the
quiet.� She hardly noticed when the girls
had filled the pool and left her alone with En once more.

&nbsp;

She really enjoyed the feel of En�s
strong hands on her tired body.�� It had
been along time since a man � any man - had last touched her body � that way or
any way at all, come to think of it.� Her
mind marshaled all of the arguments.� As
a Professor of Women�s Studies, she knew all of them very well and she was
certainly old enough to now the difference between love and lust.� However, she was also old enough to have some
empathy for her own appetites and simply indulge herself once in a while.

&nbsp;

En was great and she was glad that
she did it.� Without her asking, he went
down on her the way she loved.� He was
patient and gentle.� She had two orgasms
before she took him into her and when she had had her third orgasm, he was
still hard and eager.� When she gave him
his pleasure, she felt like the Goddess who danced with the Wind Serpent and
called the world into existence.� Then he
went down on her again.� The pleasure
threatened to kill her. 

&nbsp;

Istari took Kim and Bunny to their
hut.� Istari could speak some English,
but was nowhere near as fluent as Mihali

&nbsp;

�The furnishing in the hut was simple, just two
raised sleeping platforms.� There, they
found two youths, Kidu and Emesh..� Emesh
was native to the Annu�i, but Kidu had been captured from the Annu�lu in a
chattel raid one year before led by Mihali and Rahali.� They had found him out gathering under the
not so watchful eyes of the Annu�lu warriors and quickly subdued him.� Mihali gagged him and tied his wrists behind
his back securely, then led him back to the Annu�i village by a leash attached
to his scrotal sac.� Now, he had been
adopted formally and was a full member of the Annu�i tribe.

&nbsp;

The children all loved him because
he allowed them to play capture.� He let
himself be overwhelmed by noisy bands of tiny warriors and let them practice
their skills securing and leashing a male.

�


Bunny just stared at the naked
youths. At first, they made her a bit nervous.�
Once on her world, a man could terrorize a dozen sane healthy women
simply by threatening to expose his male parts. Her world had actually changed
some.� Bunny thought of Shelby�s
wild bachelorette party � the world had changed a lot - but male nudity still
carried a message of male aggression rather than male vulnerability in too many
contexts.

&nbsp;

�Are we safe?� Kim asked. Despite
her usual bravado and self-defense training, she had had much less contact with
the male gender. Her Women�s Studies major had sensitized her to the undeniable
male alacrity for violence and she lacked Bunny�s extensive experience in
managing blatant male aggression with its always-present undercurrent of
potential brutal assault.

&nbsp;

Istari was puzzled by the question
but reassured her.� Did women on the
Other Earth live in fear of their males?��
Here, the unruly males were locked in their pens, castrated, and then
put down, if that didn�t help. 

&nbsp;

��Prime beef on the hoof,� Bunny marveled,
looking at Kim with a grin.� She flipped
her thick, blond ponytail and smacked her lips. �I�d love to get my mouth on
them.�

&nbsp;

Kim shook her head, embarrassed -
as always - by Bunny�s unabashed and unashamed sexuality

&nbsp;

However, Istari heard Bunny�s
remark and promptly agreed that the males, now fully-grown and ready for
harvest, would yield excellent meat.�
Their keepers had fed them amply and exercised them hard to assure their
quality.� She very much looked forward to
the feast also.� However, she confessed
to a bit of confusion.� She had thought
that women on Professor Kurtz�s world chose not to make such use of their
males.

&nbsp;

Kim tried to explain.

&nbsp;

At first, Istari understood that
Bunny wanted to eat their sex parts raw while they still lived. That sounded
cruel and not very appetizing. Everyone knew that sex parts were delicious, but
required careful and lengthy preparation.�
For herself, Istari liked testicles, but she thought that cock was just
too rubbery and chewy. 

&nbsp;

Kim tried again with more
success.� 

&nbsp;

Istari and Kim went to look around
the village.� Bunny refused the
invitation and decided to stay behind with Kidu and Emesh , once Istari had
assured her that the males were quite docile.

�

When Kim and Istari toured village
where the males lived. Istari brought the strong, bitter tea that the males
drank and carried back some of the food they had gathered or grown in their
garden plots.� Male children stayed with
their mothers until they were three years old.�
Then they went to live in the male village. The youngest males were
cared for by the 18 year olds, the 4 year olds by the 17 years old, the 5 year
olds by the 16 year olds and so on.� Kim
met the women who supervised the male village and the hand of warriors who
protected them against wandering off or being carried away by Annu�lu
raiders.� The 19 year olds lived in the
male compound in the main village.� The
prime males were chosen for special sacrifice in the Temple.� The inferior males simply were slaughtered
without ceremony as required.� The males
were large and well nourished but Kim saw no males older than 19 years. 

�

Bunny lay back on the on the bed
dreamily while the two naked youths massaged her battered, sore feet. Her eyes
were more than half closed. Bunny was so tired after the day�s exertion.� It had taken a while to overcome her
disbelief, but she finally understood that the Annu� slaughtered and ate their
males.� It seemed like such a waste.� Right now, she�d rather that a male ate
her.� She beckoned with her finger and
one of the males stood.� 

&nbsp;

Emesh looked at her trying to
determine what exactly she wanted.� As
her drowsy mind passed into sleep, she found herself straddling the face of one
male who expertly nuzzled her hot, hungry sex with his mouth and tongue while
she closed her soft red lips around the hot, hard cock of the other.� Her well-manicured hand massaged his plump
ball sac. She groaned aloud.� She and the
males explored several other configurations and limp with pleasure, she finally
fell fast asleep.

&nbsp;

After a time, Kim and Istari returned.� Bunny still slept soundly.� The two males sat quietly on the floor at the
end of the sleeping platform.� Istari
sent the two males back to their pen and Kim let Bunny sleep.

&nbsp;




V Story of The
First Invasion

&nbsp;

����������� 

Everyone met again at
dinner.� Professor Marlow grilled
Professor Kurtz about the simple economics of it all.

&nbsp;

�We all know, Karen,� Professor
Kurtz began, �in hunting and gathering societies, women gather most of the food
stuffs.� Here the males garden while the
women hunt and gather.� On our Earth,
males� � especially the older males
consume much more than their share of resources with their sports, hobbies, and
wars.� Here, there are quite simply no
older males to monopolize resources.�

&nbsp;

�Any way you look at it,� Kim
Hunter offered tentatively, �this system reserves more resources for women and
children.� Who protects them?� Isn�t that the male role.� 

&nbsp;

Francine Kurtz nodded.� �The women protect themselves.� The Annu�i are in constant struggle with the
Annu�lu. ��Both rule over a number of
lesser tribes.� We � I mean � the Annu�i
were invaded once already by the American military.� A higher percentage of females, means a
higher reproductive capacity.� More
resources for women and children translate into a healthier population and a
lower infant mortality.� Compared to men,
women mature earlier and take on their responsibilities as warriors at a
younger age.� She told them the story of the first invasion.� 

&nbsp;

When Aratti learned of the
arrival the American soldiers, she had been shocked by the news.� Even though Francine had told her something
of the nature of our Earth, the idea of armed males playing at war seemed a
fundamental perversion of nature.�
Francine had urged her to believe her scouts.�� An invasion was not only possible � it was
the most likely response of the patriarchal establishment.

&nbsp;

�
Kim nodded in ready agreement.

&nbsp;

Aratti steadfastly denied the
possibility.� Their own males had always
been docile and well behaved.� Finally,
Mihali showed her the weapons, hairy, pale skins, and genitals that they had
taken from the two scouts.

&nbsp;

Today, Mihali showed Karen, Kim,
and Bunny the Merriweather and William�s dog tags. �

&nbsp;

Professor Kurtz had deeply
admired the warriors� courage in the face of the soldiers� guns and railed at
her government�s duplicity.� She warned
the others that the first two were most likely only scouts for a larger,
well-armed force.

&nbsp;

Aratti dispatched Inanni and a
large band of warriors to locate Rahali and her band.� They were to watch the Portal from a distance
and shadow any new invaders.� Despite
their courage, her warriors knew that they could not match the soldier�s
firepower. However, they knew the jungle. A stratagem was required and
concocted. 

&nbsp;

Francine Kurtz found the
transponder in her baggage.� When the
platoon arrived the Annu�i were ready.

&nbsp;

Never had the warriors captured so
many males at one time.� The outlanders
were still unruly even after they had surrendered and were disarmed.� Herded into a stockade they hammered on the stout
wooden gate, beating their hands bloody.�
Several formed a human ladder to allow one of their number to scale the
twelve foot wall.� Before he could drop
to the ground, a warrior with a padded bamboo pole pushed him back inside. 

&nbsp;

Generally, the tribeswomen
sacrificed one male formally each month. In addition, one or two others might
be culled from the home stock or captured by the hunters and slaughtered for
private trade and consumption.� A fully
grown male might yield 100 pounds of meat and meat kept poorly in the
jungle.� Carcasses were usually consumed
on the day they were slaughtered although some meat might be preserved in the
dry season.� About 600 women lived in the
main village and the three hamlets.� Each
might expect no more than an occasional taste of the prestige food.� 

&nbsp;

Never had the women had so
plentiful a supply of males. The prisoners themselves required an immense
amount of food.� Hygiene was a challenge.Ygeine �Tribeswomen came from all over to see the
outlanders.� 

&nbsp;

Aratti, the headwoman, ordered a
male slaughtered every day. The carcasses were gutted, butchered, and prepared.
The soldiers were much more hairy in general than the Annu�i. Francine Kurtz
showed them how to use burning straw to remove body hair.�� 

&nbsp;

The Annu�i employed a traditional
cooking style. The flayed, gutted carcasses were butchered. Large cuts of meat
were boiled in huge caldrons, then cut into fist sized pieces and seared on
sharpened sticks.� The Annu�i practice of
cooking and eating males was the major cause of their long conflict with the
Annu�lu.

&nbsp;

Professor Kurtz shared a humorous
story.� One of the males ordered the
others to halt their assault on the gate. He pushed to the front and tried to
speak to his captors.� The warriors sent
for Professor Kurtz. Karen had her doubts but she went.

&nbsp;

�I�m Lieutenant Wilson,� the marine
explained, guessing that she spoke English from her attire. �I�m the commanding
officer.�

&nbsp;

The Professor nodded, but did not
introduce herself.� She was uncomfortable
conversing with likely livestock.

&nbsp;

�Tell them we�re soldiers, warriors
like them,� he pleaded. �We�re prisoners of war and I demand that they follow
the Geneva conventions,� the
Lieutenant concluded, pleased with the strength of his arguments.

&nbsp;

The Professor shook her head. She
was surprised how little he moved her.�
�Do you really want me to tell them that you and your men are warriors?�

&nbsp;

The Lieutenant nodded, yes and the
Professor shrugged.

&nbsp;

Mihali laughed when Francine
communicated the claim and laughed again to hear the retelling.� �When I heard his claim, I laughed so hard
that I nearly lost my pee.� Inanni drew
her newly acquired commando blade and spoke menacingly to him in her own
tongue.� None of us had learned much
English yet.�� All eyes returned to
Professor Kurtz.

&nbsp;

The Professor continued.� I told the officer, �If you want to convince
them that you�re a warrior, Lieutenant, you�ll have to prove it.�

&nbsp;

�Does she want to fight? Give me a
knife and I�ll fight her.� he retorted

&nbsp;

�She doesn�t want to fight.� She�s fought already and she won.� She wants you to remove your clothes.�

&nbsp;

Now the poor Lieutenant was
confused and hesitated.

&nbsp;

�It�s up to you, Lieutenant.� If you want we can just leave you in there
and go about our business.�

&nbsp;

His men crowded close around.� The Lieutenant growled to his men to get
back.� They retreated grudgingly, leaving
him some room.� He searched Mihali and
Inanni�s painted savage faces and tried desperately to penetrate the American
woman�s quizzical look.� She had never
told him her name. Reluctantly, he stripped down to his undershirt, underpants,
and socks.

&nbsp;

�Not good enough, Lieutenant,� the
Professor explained as if to slower but still earnest student.� �Naked.�

&nbsp;

First the Lieutenant removed his
socks, then his undershirt, and finally his underpants.

&nbsp;

Mihali pointed at him and
laughed.� Inanni had laughed out loud too
and even the Professor could not restrain her chuckle. The pattern of a woman�s
face paint denoted her rank and her personal initiations. 

&nbsp;

The Lieutenant covered himself as
best he could.� �Why are they laughing at
me?� They demanded that I strip and I
stripped.� I wasn�t my idea.� Haven�t they ever seen a naked man?�

&nbsp;

Even the Professor smiled.� �You say that you�re a warrior.� They say that no one can have one of those
and be a warrior.� They want to know if
you really thought that you would fool them.�

&nbsp;

Now the Lieutenant was
confused.� �One of what?�

&nbsp;

�A penis.�� Everyone laughed. 

&nbsp;

Aratti, the head woman,
continued.� Stripped naked, the
outlanders were much more manageable, but there were just so many of them. She
was unsure exactly what to do with them. Meat was so plentiful that only the
prime cuts were eaten.� In ones and twos,
the headwomen gave males to women from outlying hamlets so that all might share
in the bounty. �She even sent a pair of
males to the Annu�lu under a flag of truce. 

&nbsp;

Professor Kurtz saw the warm
reception that her first story had received and ventured a second.� 

&nbsp;

A certain Corporal couldn�t
understand what had come to pass.� She
had forgotten his name.� Why had the old
lady Lieutenant surrendered?� He was a
large man and naked, his heavily muscled physique was obvious to all.� That damned feminazi Professor and two slight
savage girls entered the compound like they owned it, without regard for the forty
men confined there.� �Hey, bitches!� the
Corporal had called.

&nbsp;

The women ignored him.

&nbsp;

�Hey, cunts!� Look at me!��
He stroked his male parts.� On
Earth, a male can terrorize a dozen sane, healthy women just by threatening to
expose his male parts.� Here, no one paid
much attention. Certainly, no one was intimidated.

&nbsp;

Rahali and Mihali just looked at
him and grinned.� They didn�t understand
a word that he said, but found his loud antics amusing. He appeared to be an
outstanding specimen.

&nbsp;

�Suddenly, the Professor felt fear.� She couldn�t completely repress her
instinctual reaction to his size and undeniable potential for violence. She was
afraid and she didn�t like it.

&nbsp;

�Hey, girlies! I�ve got some USDA
prime meat for you!�� He waved his fat
cock in their direction.� His grin was
maniacal.

&nbsp;

�What is he saying?� Mihali had
asked the Professor.

&nbsp;

Francine Kurtz said she had thought
for a moment and finally understood the absolute impotence of his threats in
this time and place.� She suppressed a
chuckle, both then and now.� �He�s
boasting about the quality of his flesh.�

&nbsp;

Several hours later, his flayed
carcass was butchered and boiling in a large cauldron. Several hours later
still, many more could now testify to the veracity of his seemingly arrogant
claim.

&nbsp;

Kim offered that now that she was
there, she knew something about firearms and might teach them to use the
weapons that they had captured.

&nbsp;

�Well,� Professor Marlow
concluded.� �The Government let us come
as peaceful emissaries at least.� I got
them to promise no more soldiers!�

&nbsp;




VI� The Sacrifice

&nbsp;

Professor Karen Marlow stood
among the close-packed celebrants and struggled mightily to maintain her
scientific detachment.� A day of fasting
� this time voluntary and in keeping with the ritual - left her stomach all too
vocal in its urgent complaints.� The
flowery fragrance of the burning incense was intoxicating.� She felt weak and giddy.� The compelling beat of the drums and the
rhythmic chanting of the worshippers discouraged rational thought. Their excitement
was irresistibly contagious.� 

&nbsp;

Kidu entered the Temple,
followed closely by Aratti and Mihali, his captor.� When Karen saw him, her feelings roiled. His
golden skin glowed in flickering light of the torches.� Memory crowded upon memory.� He was covered in a faint sheen of
perspiration.� His face was calm, but his
breathing was a bit rapid and a bit shallow.�
No one could deny his magnificence.��
She marveled at his courage and dedication.



When Kidu came closer, she wanted
to flee.� Karen looked quickly to
Francine Kurtz standing to her left and grinning, and to Irami, the elder, who
stood to her right.� Kidu stood before
her and bowed his head.� He reminded her
so much of En.� She wasn�t sure that he
even saw her.� She wanted very much to
embrace him.� She wanted to flee with
him.� 

&nbsp;

However, Mihali, his captor,�
offered Karen the bone-handled knife. Karen took the knife and tears
wells up in her eyes.� She looked into
Kidu�s dark eyes and did what was required.�
She accepted the honor.� She
grabbed a handful of his thick, dark hair and cut his hair, which had never
before been cut. She could not stop her tears.



The initial step completed, Rahali ushered the youth to the
altar and the waiting attendants. Mihali looked on proudly and accepted the
congratulations of those around her.�
Kidu knelt before the altar and Rahali wielded the club as he had
asked.� He knew that she would not fail
him in her crucial task.� Upon the signal
of the high priestess, she struck him once and truly.� As he collapsed, the four attendants caught
him, two on each side.� Two stood on the
step below altar and two stood on the step above.� The four together they lifted him, by his
legs and hips, head down, and displayed him to the celebrants.� As tall as he was, his thick arms lay
unmoving on the ground.� His sex flopped
limply against his flat belly. 



The attendants draped him supinely over the roughly
fashioned stone altar. His head hung back, baring his throat.� His eyes were closed and his jaw was
slack.� A junior priestess wielded the
sacrificial knife while the drums and the chanting reached a crescendo.� She opened his throat while her kneeling
attendant held a broad deep bowl below to catch the blood. Blood spurted
against the altar and against the priestesses. The celebrants groaned aloud.



Karen thought that she might have fainted for a time.� The pale form was carried from the altar
while the celebrants filed silently from the Temple.� The women, still excited by what they had
seen, followed the torch-lit walkways on either side of the structure to the
inner courtyard, now alight with smoking torches that flickered in the moist
tropical breeze.



Dried gourds filled with of fermented cassava juice awaited
revelers.� All stopped for some
refreshment.� 



�An awe-inspiring ritual,� Prof. Kurtz commented as she
quaffed her second gourd.� �The boy was
magnificent and Rahali put him down so cleanly.�
They had tried to extend the same honor to the Lieutenant of the
captured Marines, but he hadn�t the dignity and ended up butcher meat.�� 

&nbsp;

Karen wondered if En was waiting for her in her hut as she
had arranged. Francine laughed at her self-indulgence, but urged her to try
another male and not dote so on En. Karen was unsure of herself and her
appetites.� She was still unwilling to go
completely native. 



Behind the Temple,
behind a bamboo screen, the abattoir workers worked furiously.� Once a sharp, heavy axe had severed his head,
Kidu�s resemblance to anything human ceased.�
They gutted and flayed his headless carcass with skilled hands and sharp
tools. The flayed carcass was quartered and then butchered while the skin was
hung for display.



Large cuts of meat were boiled in one of two bubbling
cauldrons. 



Karen Marlow didn�t take part in the festivities.� She struggled to keep her disapproval to
herself.� While she approved of the
Annu�I gynocetnrism, she disapproved of their androphagy.� She went back to her hut and fucked En again.
She worried that he could become habit forming.

&nbsp;

Kim Hunter, always eager to experience the new and unusual,
was an eager participant.� She stayed
close to Mihali and Rahali and roasted a fist sized chunk of meat on a
sharpened stick.� 

&nbsp;

Bunny
had even slept with Kidu and she had had several others.� Still, she just couldn�t bring herself to
watch the ceremony.� However, hunger and
the aroma of roasting meat brought her from her hut.� Once among the Annu�I and after a gourd of
fermented cassava juice, however, the festive mood was contagious and
irresistible.� Bunny soon forgot both her
reservations and her diet.� She wondered
if she would have time to try all the males before they were eaten.� Perhaps, Rahali could tell her which ones to
try first. It all still seemed such a waste.

&nbsp;








VII Arruru



Arruru
of the Annu�lu people watched the proceedings with disgust.� The Annu�i shamelessly butchered the male
carcass and threw the pieces into boiling cauldrons. An insult to the Goddess,
she fumed.� About on e hour later, the
chunks were fished out and cut into fist size pieces.� The Annu�i seared these over wood fires
talking and laughing all the while.

&nbsp;

�Arruru swallowed her disgust and signalled to
her war leader, Ishtaru and to Annatu, Nanu and the others.� The Annu�i warriors on guard tonight likely
seethed in resentment at missing the festivities and would be less than
vigilant.� Likely, they nursed their
grievances rather than warded their charges.��
This would be a great time to raid the Annu�i male compound.� Perhaps, several males might be recovered to
re[place Kidu, whom they had lost.� 

&nbsp;

Arurru herself silenced to the one
guard they found awake. She was hardly sober.��
Her comrades burst into a hut and secured three of the largest
males.� They were quickly gagged.� Their wrists were tied behind their backs and
they were led off by leashes tied to their scrotal sacs.� The women and their captives disappeared
silently into the jungle.� The remaining
males were thoroughly agitated and raised an alarm.

&nbsp;

Arruru hung back to confuse any
pursuit.� She had drawn th black
tile.� The penalty for capture was a year
and a day as a slave.� Women were rarely
killed or injured in these endemic raids and reprisals.� Mihali led the pursuit. Despite Arruru�s
skills, she could not evade capture.�
However, she did buy enough time to allow her comrades to escape. Three
males had been redeemed from the hated Annu�i.

&nbsp;

Arrurru was a warrior. She glared
at the Annu�I as they stripped her naked,��
fiercely ignoring her cuts and bruises.�
Her anger was barely constrained.�
She would serve them for a year and a day as required by custom.� They would try to impregnate her.� Any child � male or female � belonged to the
Annu�i.�� They would try to make her
share their foul meats.� She would die,
rather than surrender her principles.� 

&nbsp;




VIII
Reprisal

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The angry response in the
Annu�I village was to mount a reprisal, as it had been for generations.� Mihali and Rahali hid near the male compound
of the Annu�lu village.� Kimhad come with
htem.� Mihali said that dusk was likely
the best time for abduction as the males likely straggled back to their village
after a day�s gathering and gardening.�
This way, they might win some time to disappear back into the jungle
before the alarm was raised and the darkness would aid their escape. 

&nbsp;

Mihali pointed out the cooking pits
of the hated Annu�lu. �The Annu�lu ate
their males just like the Annu�i.� 

&nbsp;

Kim Hunter noted that the Annu�lu
roasted male carcasses whole on a spit without boiling.�� As the meat cooked, the crispy outer layers
were shaved away and eaten, leaving uncooked flesh underneath to roast.� The Annu�i thought that eating male flesh
without boiling it first was filthy.� The
Annu�lu thought that butchering a carcass before cooking it was uncouth. It had
more to do with theology and showing proper respect to the Goddess than
cuisine.

&nbsp;

The three fell on a male meandering
back to the village after a long day working in his garden.� Quickly and efficiently, he was bound and
gagged.� Mihali dragged him into the
forest by his scrotal leash.� After an
hour�s mad dash, Rihali finally allowed them to halt.� The male groaned in his bonds and fell to the
ground, exhausted.� 

&nbsp;

Rihali went back to scout to learn
if anyone was following them.� The
languages of the Annu�i and the Annu�lu were very similar and Mihali offered
the male some water on condition that he make no sound.� He assented and she removed his gag and gave
him two long swallows.� Kim, giddy from
shortness of breath and the exhilaration of their success, caught her breath,
took a mouthful of water, cleansed her mouth and spit.� Then she slowly took a long drink of
water.� 

&nbsp;

Meanwhile, Mihali replaced her
captives� gag . When Rihali came back and reported no sign of pursuit, she
removed his scrotal leash and hobbled his ankles for the night. 

&nbsp;

The male lay among the shadows in
the moonlight. Mihali sat beside him.�
She murmured in comforting tones and milked his cock with her fist.�� His eyes were wide with terror but his body
responded to her touch promptly.�� Mihali
was surprised by her easy success and took his response as her triumph.� She called softly to Rihali and Kim.� �Look at this � who wants to have him
first?� You, Kim?�

&nbsp;

Kim was unsure and hesitated.� Rihali didn�t ask twice or wait for
long.� She shrugged and straddled the
bound male, lifted her apron and settled on his ready sex. Terrified as he was,
his erection faded.� Rihali groaned in
disappointment, but reached into a pouch on her belt and retrieved several
leaves. She crushed these between her fingers, then poked a finger into the bound
male�s mouth and painted the inside of his cheeks and gums. His erection
promptly returned.� Rihali quickly took
him into her.� She took her pleasure
deliberately and ground her way to orgasm.�
The male stayed hard.� He was
unable to ejaculate.� When Rihali had
finished he glistened with her juices, but his cock still stood
invitingly.� Mahali took her pleasure
too. 

&nbsp;

Kim thought long and hard and
finally decided that she might try. She was intellectually opposed to
rape.� The male wasn�t exactly
resisting.� He may be too frightened to
fight, but he wasn�t even protesting.�
Maybe, his hard-on was proof of consent and maybe even the asshole
really even liked it. She always sought something new.� Her jeans and panties presented a greater
problem than the tribeswomen�s lappets. To her surprise, she was already wet
when she straddled him.� He was hot and
thick inside her and it felt so good.�
She ran her fingers over his mouth and teeth.� He opened his mouth and she fisted his mouth
with relish.� She found her pleasure
easily despite her friends� unceasing, raucous comments. Kim was breathing hard
when she dismounted.� She had taken two
orgasms quickly, the second even more easily than the first.� 

&nbsp;

When Mihali stood over him once
more, Kim thought that it would all start again.� Instead, Mihali placed her hand on her sex
and separated her labia.� She looked up
at Kim and smiled, then she released a steam of urine to mark her captive. His
name was Nergal.

&nbsp;




IX Second Invasion

&nbsp;

When the three returned to
the village, it had been abandoned. Miryami, a young warrior, found them and
quickly guided them away to where the others were in hiding. More soldiers had
arrived two days before � this time a full company, 200 strong, well-armed and
well aware of their predecessors� unexpected defeat. They search through the
jungle for the village, methodically and systematically.� They battled the dense foliage and the
mosquitoes and didn�t depend on any technological device.� The village was hidden, but daily life had
carved paths in the jungle.� The soldiers
had craft enough to find these.

&nbsp;

When the soldiers finally
reached the village, the Annu�i had already fled into the jungle leaving their
garden plots and most of their males, behind.�
Their campsite was moved daily to avoid detection.�� Some warriors were assigned to shadow the
enemy.� Others hunted for food.� Foodstuffs were always in short supply.� Hunting was severely impeded by the need to
track the soldiers and avoid detection.�
The children were always fed first.

&nbsp;

The soldiers searched the
jungle for the Annu�i.� However, the
soldiers were burdened by the need to care for the abandoned males.� 

.

Mihali�s male, Nergal, was
slaughtered immediately without ceremony.�
One by one, the few other males were slaughtered.� Karen was outraged.� Rationale arguments that food was short,
feeding the males placed one more burden on the inadequate food supply, and
their yield was better now while they was still well nourished, did nothing to
assuage her anger.� She wouldn�t partake at
all and she grew steadily weaker.

&nbsp;

The tribeswomen held
Professor Marlow in high esteem and truly wished her approval.� They wanted her to eat to maintain her
strength. However, she condemned their anthropophagy and forbid anyone to touch
her male En.� The idea that a male might
belong to an individual and not to the tribe was alien as a whole to the
Annu�i.� However, Aratti consulted with
the elders and they decided to honor the Professor�s request.� En would not be slaughtered.

&nbsp;

En himself viewed the scene
with terrible confusion.� From earliest
childhood, he aspired to be a temple sacrifice.�
He deeply wanted to help his people.

&nbsp;

While her fiery will blazed
unabated, the Professor weakened physically.��
Still, she refused any food until the children had eaten. She always ate
less than her allotted ration.� As time
passed, she slept more and more of each day.�
Finally, she required assistance even to walk. En tended her
lovingly.� 

&nbsp;

Finally, she was too weak to
argue much when Rahali came to her with rich broth.� When she did argue, Rihali just ignored her
protests.� On the first day, she ate only
a bit, before she suffered terrible stomach cramps and vomiting.� On the next day, she ate a bit more and held
it down.� Diarrhea began and abated only
with herb tea.� On the third day, she ate
still more. Her strength gradually returned.�
En was always there for her and cared for her. When she began to wonder
about the origin of the broth, she knew that she was on the path to recovery.

&nbsp;

Inani roused her early one
morning for the day�s march. The Professor ate her ration of soup- actually
relishing the chunks of meat that had simmered long with the spices and
vegetables.� When she learned that the
soup had been made from the body of a soldier, she found herself oddly lacking
in condemnation. The soldiers had after all deprived them of their homes and
threatened their very lives. 

&nbsp;

One day En was nowhere to be found.� Aratti told her that he had gone ahead with
Mihali to the next campsite to await them. Over the day�s long trek, her hunger
mounted. Now that she was stronger, her hunger was even more compelling.�� As they approached the end of the long day�s
journey, she detected the aroma of roasting meat.� At first, she thought that her famished mind
was playing a trick on her, but as she walked on the aroma became undeniable.

&nbsp;

Finally at the campsite, she saw girls and women clustered
around small fires roasting chunks of meat.�
Obviously, the Hunters had brought in a male. Suddenly food was
plentiful and they ate with abandon,

&nbsp;

Professor Marlow surprised herself with her response.� The meat was clearly human or more
specifically male.� Despite her
intellectual qualms and reservations, she found herself salivating; her hunger
was undeniably piqued.� Her expected
horror and disgust were strangely absent.�
With envy, she watched Professor Kurtz enjoy her dinner with no apparent
conflict. Once she had begun to eat, her ambivalence evaporated too.

&nbsp;

Someone handed her a stick with a fist-sized piece of
steaming flesh.� Marlow ate with
enthusiasm.� Her hands were greasy.� Juices ran down her face and soiled her
blouse and she didn�t really care. 

&nbsp;

The edge off her hunger, she suddenly, she remembered
En.� Where was her En?� She looked for Mihali and didn�t see
her.� Marlow stopped eating and put down
her leaf and searched the camp.� Her
suspicions grew and she really didn�t want to ask.

&nbsp;

�Where�s my En?�� she inquired, when she found Mihali eating
with Rahali and Inanni. No one answered her right away.� She repeated her question and demanded an
answer.

&nbsp;

Mihali looked at her for a long
moment.� She held up the stick with its
chunk of roasted meat and frowned.

&nbsp;

The Professor threw her stick to
the ground.� She battled a cold
fury.� �I begged none of you to hurt him!
I pleaded!� You owed me that much.�

&nbsp;

�None of us touched him,
Professor.� En saw how much we starved
and how the children suffered.� He took
Rahali�s knife, and cut his own throat.�
See, you also enjoy his gift.�

&nbsp;

����������� The
Professor fell to her knees weeping.� Her
friends, wishing not to exacerbate her embarrassment, ignored her and went back
to their feasting.� It had been too long
since they had eaten like this.� 

&nbsp;

Alone in her grief, the Professor
remembered that En had always looked forward to being chosen for
sacrifice.� The invaders had seized the
temple and denied him his altar and his ceremony.� Despite them, En had succeeded in sacrificing
himself for his people. Perhaps, after all, she should take some pride in his
victory.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;




X Victory

&nbsp;

Two weeks passed and the first of
the soldiers became ill. Malaise was followed quickly by weakness and lethargy.
Every day more and more soldiers reported themselves ill. The dwindling number
of healthy soldiers tended to their sick comrades. No one recovery but no one
died.� Every day fewer soldiers scoured
the jungle for the tribeswomen. 

&nbsp;

Despite his limited tools and
increasing malaise, the medic quickly identified the virus that caused the
illness, a virus carried by mosquitoes. Professor Kurtz had sent back weekly
blood samples before the first invasion and nothing like this had been found in
her blood. He found antibodies to the virus in the blood of every native male
whom he tested. Perhaps this virus was like polio or mononucleosis, causing a
mild illness in young toddlers, but major disease in older adolescents and
adults. He had no native females to test. 

&nbsp;

After four weeks, the soldiers
abandoned the hamlets and retreated to the main village to care for their sick.
The women returned to their hamlets and watched the invaders intently.

�

Preparations began.� Aratti sent the priestesses into the jungle
to gather the herb used in making the bitter tea that the males drank. Never
had the women played host to so many males. 

&nbsp;

After four, the women returned to
their village. The soldiers were too ill to resist. No one fought back when the
women took their weapons. Kim showed the women how to care for the weapons and
started a class in their use. No one resisted when the women took the soldiers�
filthy clothes and left them stark naked. Almost 200 males were divided into
more manageable gangs of ten. One gang at a time, the males were driven to the
river and washed. Only then, were the soldiers allowed to drink the bitter
herbal tea that kept the endemic illness in check for the native males.
Curiously, the illness never affected women. 

&nbsp;

The soldiers� rations were hardly
sufficient for both the soldiers and the women. The women found their bland
taste more than noxious. Once again, gangs were sent as gifts to the
neighboring tribes. Aratti freed Arurru and sent her home with 20 males as a
peace offering to the Annu�lu.� She
ordered that one or two males a day might be slaughtered. Karen Marlow did not
complain. 

&nbsp;

����������� This seemed
like a time for peace between the Annu�i and the Annu�lu.� Kim talked long and hard with Professor Kurtz
in order to increase her understanding of Annu�i and Annu�lu customs and
beliefs.� Then, she devised a new cooking
style that would satisfy the aesthetic and religious requirements of both the
Annu�i and the Annu�lu.� Kim Hunter
talked with Arurru and Inanni.� A flayed
male carcass might be trussed then boiled whole, Annu�i style, before roasting
on a spit over an aromatic wood fire.�
The flavorful crispy outer layers of flesh might be shaved away, Annu�lu
style.� The carcass was respected as per
Annu�lu custom and boiled as per Annu�i custom.�
After a worrisome pause, all agreed that the method was a success.� Arruru and Inanni agreed that the procedure
was proper and the results were delicious.�
Kim was glad that she had had so many carcasses for her various
experiments.

&nbsp;

Professor Marlow gathered up the
dog tags, the doctors� log, and Bunny and headed back to our Earth. She brushed
aside the CIA�s pleas for secrecy and told her story. Her evidence overwhelmed
their dispirited pro forma denials. Across party lines, the substantial
majority of women in the Congress and Senate were unified and resolute in
demanding protection for this unique, twice betrayed gynicentric culture. Few
in the defense establishment saw much prospects of success for battling an
aroused female majority. At best, they might bide their time. In the meantime,
Professor Marlow�s college might open an exchange program right in the Midwest,
in the heartland. 

&nbsp;




XI� The Kappa Klappa House

&nbsp;

Brad and his pledge class stared
through the bushes at the Kappa Kappa House and considered their next move. The
pledge master was some sort of bastard. He demanded proof that Brad and his
fellow pledges had been inside the famous Kappa Klappa House.� Some things never changed at Midwestern
University.� The heat and humidity of the
late summer nights was oppressive.� The
mosquitoes were as voracious as ever.�
Hazing lived on.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Everyone was certain that exposure
to the American consumer culture would change the Annu�i.� Cars, shopping centers, and credit cards were
certain to undermine traditional ways � just as they had for countless other
immigrants.� However, much had changed on
campus since the Annu�i women had taken over the old Kappa Klappa House. Women
flocked there from all the dorms and sororities on campus. No male was known to
have ever visited. If any male had visited, none was ever known to have left
alive, the upper classmen teased the freshmen boys.� Their reputation preceded them.

&nbsp;

�This Kim Hunter, now Doctor Kimberly Hunter,
an instructor in the Women�s Studies Program, had set up a women�s self defense
program. The Campus Police were supplemented by women�s patrols with as many of
their boyfriends as they could coax to come long. It was a cheap date at least.
For once, the campus was safe at night and students of both genders enjoyed the
novel freedom from fear. The Campus police took credit for the sudden turn of
events. A few wondered to themselves just where to absent miscreants ended up,
but no one really wanted to ask.

&nbsp;

Some things didn�t change.� Summer nights were hot and humid in the
Midwest.� Mosquitoes were large and
rapacious. Fraternity pledges played pranks, while the College authorities
indulged their wild mischief.� 

&nbsp;

Brad looked at the Kappa Klappa
house and searched for way in.� He heard
women�s voices from the enclosed yard behind the house over the suddenly loud
breathing of his friends.� He smelled
mesquite smoke together with the sweet fragrance of the flowers. Maybe Collin
was lucky to be home sick.� A buzzing
mosquito landed on the back of Brad�s left hand.� He felt the tickle of its legs and slapped at
it, almost by reflex.� The sudden noise
startled his friends. �You know,� Brad whispered.� �I don�t think that this is the right night
for this stunt.�

&nbsp;

�Yeah,� said Tim.� �You don�t think.�

&nbsp;

�Do you really want to face that
ass hole,� asked Mike.

&nbsp;

�Which ass hole?� asked Tim, very
well knowing the answer already.

&nbsp;

�Brother Bob, the pledge master �
you�re really an ass hole, Tim.� offered Zach.�
�Brad�s right.� Maybe another
night would be better.� Let�s get us the
hell away from here.� Far away.� Any questions, ladies?� Let�s get!�
