The Storm

Synopsis: 






The impending storm was bringing the twilight faster than usual.&nbsp; He was seated on a barstool on one side of the counter in the kitchen, glancing absently at a newspaper spread out on the counter, and she stood directly opposite him, on the other side of the counter.&nbsp; Thunder sounded in the distance.&nbsp; He filled his heavy flat-bottomed glass with scotch from the decanter on the counter.&nbsp; She looked at the sky then the clouds through the window to the West.&nbsp; �Storm brewing.�&nbsp; she said.&nbsp; �Big one.�&nbsp; He nodded and poured a little scotch in another glass which he pushed in her direction.&nbsp; �Have a drink.�&nbsp; He said, without looking at her.&nbsp; 

She picked it up and brought it to her lips, drinking the amount he&#8217;d poured for her in one swallow, then wincing at the taste.&nbsp; Someday she would ask him to explain the benefit of aged scotch as opposed to brand new scotch�she sat her empty glass down.&nbsp; Feeling impatient.&nbsp; She watched as he took another drink from his glass.&nbsp; She cocked her head a little as she watched him, wondering what he was thinking.&nbsp; He lit a cigarette and she watched his fingers manipulate it.&nbsp; Watched him absently bring it to his lips and inhale.&nbsp; Watched as he exhaled, the smoke slowly escaping his slightly parted lips.&nbsp; Ugh.&nbsp; 

Plan a, she thought�.snatch that cigarette away and run.&nbsp; She wondered if he would give playful chase or punish her for being impertinent.&nbsp; No telling what his reaction would be.&nbsp; So, unwilling to risk displeasing him, she was forced to wait while he smoked it.&nbsp; She felt restless and fidgety�she glanced again out the window�stifling a tell-tale impatient sigh�and resorted to�plan b�she inwardly grinned as she slid her hand down to her pussy�out of his line of sight from where he sat and where she stood.&nbsp; She briefly considered the consequences if she were to�.say�.play with her pussy through her skirt while she waited.&nbsp; She touched herself through her skirt, leveling her eyes to his profile and biting her lip�and then decided against it.&nbsp; Heat welled up inside her and pulsed from her like she were an unoccupied burner turned to high on an old electric stove.&nbsp; Yet, still, he lingered with his drink�his cigarette.&nbsp; Couldn&#8217;t he feel it?&nbsp; Fuck.&nbsp; He had to feel it.&nbsp; 

The thunder sounded closer.&nbsp; The rain would probably come soon.&nbsp; She danced impatiently from foot to foot as he poured a little more scotch in her glass and with a nod, pushed it in her direction.&nbsp; She again drank it down in one swallow.&nbsp; After the initial, obligatory wince, the warmth of it fanned her already over-heated state.&nbsp; She began dancing from foot to foot, again, fidgeting, having trouble now containing her impatience.&nbsp; He promised. 

�You promised.�&nbsp; she said flatly staring at her hands.&nbsp; 

�I don&#8217;t need reminded of the things I say.�&nbsp; He replied impatiently.

His tone stopped her from whining, which had been plan c on her agenda.&nbsp; He promised.&nbsp; He promised.&nbsp; He promised.&nbsp; Three times.&nbsp; He promised to take me to the woods, to play�and now he&#8217;s taking his sweet-ass time with that infernal drink�which shall never be empty if he keeps topping it off that way�and soon the rain will come and ruin our plans.&nbsp; She glanced again at the dark and rapidly approaching clouds &amp; then back to him, watching as he poured just a little more into his glass.&nbsp; Grrrr.

Lightning flashed outside, a rogue gust of wind blew in through the open window, causing the candle he&#8217;d lit on the counter to flicker and blow out.&nbsp; He didn&#8217;t seem to notice.&nbsp; She dipped her fingers into the pool of melted wax in the candle.&nbsp; Ouch.&nbsp;  It was a mighty storm, judging by the energy she felt building in the air.&nbsp; She let the wax cool on her finger and then pealed it easily away, making it into a ball between her finger and thumb, then dropping it back into the depression in the top of the candle, watching it melt back into the pool.&nbsp; She glanced up at him and watched as He tilted his glass and finished the last of the amber fluid in the glass.&nbsp; He butted out his cigarette.&nbsp; His eyes finally landed on her for what she felt may&#8217;ve been the first time all day.&nbsp; �Are you ready?�&nbsp; He asked.&nbsp; Am I ready?&nbsp; Ugh.&nbsp; �Yes, yes�Sir.�&nbsp; she replied�clapping her hands &amp; jumping up and down a little.&nbsp; �Okay!�&nbsp; she said, grabbing His hand and pulling him out of the open door, onto the deck and down into the field.

She let go of his hand and darted out ahead a bit�chattering non-stop, giggling, turning around to walk backwards and look at him while she babbled on and on�amused, apparently, by the sound of her own voice�rattling on and on.&nbsp; She was happy &amp; excited�and as such�couldn&#8217;t stop chattering.&nbsp; �Where will we go?�&nbsp; she asked him.&nbsp; He didn&#8217;t reply.&nbsp; �Thank you for taking me for a walk.�&nbsp; she said after more endless chatter.&nbsp; �You&#8217;re welcome.�&nbsp; he replied.&nbsp; She did an awkward cartwheel her skirt flying as she flipped head over heal, hoping to make him smile and it worked�he clapped his hands together in mock applause and she curtsied low, holding her skirt out as she did so.&nbsp; 

The wind was stirring pretty steadily, blowing her long hair in her face, she brushed it from her face again and again, annoyed.&nbsp; It also blew up her skirt intermittently�revealing her tan legs as she giggled and modestly, but ineffectively, attempted to keep it in place.&nbsp; �Where are we going?�&nbsp; she asked again, breathless from all her flitting around.&nbsp; When she received no response she playfully tugged at the waist band of his pants.&nbsp; �What will we do when we get there?�&nbsp; she asked glancing coyly up at him from under lowered lashes.&nbsp; 

�Well, aren&#8217;t you full of questions?�&nbsp; he answered her questions with a question as they made their way beyond the field and through the wood-line, onto a broad path.&nbsp;&nbsp; �Patience is a virtue.&nbsp; Or haven&#8217;t you heard that saying?�&nbsp; She let go of the waist band of his pants and feigned ignorance.&nbsp; �No.�&nbsp; she said, �I haven&#8217;t heard that one.&nbsp; Explain it to me.�&nbsp; He shook his head, and grinned, refusing to take the bait.&nbsp; Suffice to say, she&#8217;d pay for that later.&nbsp; 

Nearly the moment they reached the tree-line the wind began to pick up, blowing steadily, beginning to blow leaves from the trees, her skirt refused to stay where it belonged and he caught an occasional glimpse of her thighs and ass, despite her best efforts to keep her skirt in its place.&nbsp; Her consternation over this fact was somewhat amusing, considering the things they&#8217;d done together over the years and the things they would do today, he thought.&nbsp; The ever-darkening sky, combined with the approaching twilight, and the relative gloom of the tree-cover made the woods seem ominous, and the lightning was really flashing, the thunder much louder now.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

After several minutes they came to a tall oak tree and he abruptly stopped� �Here�� he said, motioning for her to approach.&nbsp;&nbsp; She hadn&#8217;t immediately noticed that he&#8217;d stopped and had kept walking, but when he&#8217;d addressed her, she&#8217;d spun around, her incessant chatter dying on her lips.&nbsp; She looked down at her feet, then back at him, suddenly reluctant and unsure.&nbsp; She stepped tentatively toward him.&nbsp; Tentative, because she could tell by the tone of his voice that something was about to happen.&nbsp; Just like that�his energy had shifted.&nbsp; It reminded her of shift in the atmosphere that had been caused by the impending storm.&nbsp; Her breath caught in her throat and her heart thudded in her chest and she resisted a sudden urge to run away. 

She looked at him as she approached, trying to read the look in his eyes.&nbsp; And suddenly, realizing his full attention was upon her, she felt pinned by his stare.&nbsp; All day she&#8217;d been doing anything she could to gain his attention to no avail, and now that she had his full attention she felt both irresistibly compelled and terrifyingly off-balance, suddenly, somehow.&nbsp; 

She felt an indefinable rush.&nbsp; She almost laughed out loud even as she blinked back an inexplicable film of tears.&nbsp; Her pussy contracted in anticipation, releasing a flood of hot moisture which felt like it scalded the suddenly chilled skin of her inner thighs.&nbsp; She grinned nervously, holding both hands up in a motion of supplication.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t be mad.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t.&nbsp; Or do.&nbsp; If you want.&nbsp; Are you?&nbsp; She cocked her head as she considered his intentions.&nbsp; She wanted to apologize, but she didn&#8217;t know what for.&nbsp; For the first time in the last 15 minutes, she couldn&#8217;t decide what to say and clasped her hands nervously in front of her.&nbsp; She tried to calm herself and stop second-guessing him.&nbsp; I need...something.&nbsp; She closed the remaining distance between them then stopped, looking around briefly for�nothing really and then allowed her eyes to rest on their feet.&nbsp; They were toe to toe, just inches apart.&nbsp; She felt very, very small.&nbsp; He knows what you need.&nbsp; She seemed to be able to look at anything just then but him.&nbsp; And if she did look, what would she see?&nbsp; What would he see?&nbsp; Don&#8217;t look.&nbsp; Better not.&nbsp; Better not.&nbsp; 

Lighting flashed cutting a streak across the sky followed immediately by a violent crash of thunder, causing her to start.&nbsp; The storm was directly above them.&nbsp; The wind was blowing her hair wild and her skirt up, unchecked.&nbsp; Modesty &amp; propriety, so seemingly important a moment ago, were the least of her worries just now.&nbsp; She heard the rain, falling in a torrent on the tree-tops in the distance, and the sound grew nearer, and nearer with each passing moment.&nbsp; 

The sky opened up above them and the rain began to pour, she could tell by the sound, but the rain was taking it&#8217;s time trickling down through the branches of the trees above, so for what seemed like a long time, they remained dry.&nbsp; She couldn&#8217;t breath.&nbsp; He&#8217;s taken the air.&nbsp; In a moment of precognition she stiffened and closed her eyes, just a split second before he grabbed her by her upper arms, lifting her easily from the ground, spinning in a 180 degree circle and slamming her back roughly against the trunk of the oak tree that had been behind him.&nbsp; 

She let out an involuntary yelp as her back hit the tree, she kept her eyes clamped shut.&nbsp; Her lips parted and she was gulping in big panicky gulps of air.&nbsp; He secured her arms to the tree above her head, by means pre-planned but unknown to her.&nbsp; The rain was falling beneath the trees now, in big intermittent plops, none hitting either of them, as of yet.&nbsp; Without constant interaction from him during the first few moments of their now rapidly escalating encounter, she had detached herself from the intensity of the scene, her breathing grew slow &amp; steady.&nbsp; The ropes dug into her wrists but she barely felt it.&nbsp; 

She was lost, or more specifically, he had lost her, for the moment and she was waiting to be found as the first big plop of rain fell from a leaf above and hit her forehead, eliciting no reaction from her at all, as it ran slowly down her face.&nbsp; He noted her reaction and made a mental note to keep her engaged next time�then in an instant, the gathering rain drops had finally weighed down the canopy of intertwined leaves above to the point that they could no longer hold their weight, and the rain fell at an increasingly steady pace upon them.&nbsp; 

Without a word, his hands grasped her shirt and he yanked it hard, ripping the thin fabric easily from her body, her breasts exposed to the elements now, her nipples hardening instantly as the rain drops fell on her bare skin.&nbsp; He slid her skirt down over her hips and let it fall to the ground.&nbsp; Her hair was soaked with rain now and clung to her face and shoulders, rain drops dripping from her nipples.&nbsp; 

Eyes still closed, her focus was entirely inside herself.&nbsp; She had found a warm place inside to focus on and the world slipped away.&nbsp; She was, for the moment, unaware of his gaze.&nbsp; Of the water that was running in rivulets down her body.&nbsp; Of the chilling wind whipping through the trees, that had caused goose bumps to rise up all over her body.&nbsp; Everything about her in that moment seemed to be speaking to him�saying, �bring me back.�&nbsp; and He intended to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

He stood in front of her but off to the side a bit.&nbsp; He ran his fingers down her arms, from the spot where her wrists were tied, far above her head.&nbsp; Then he slid one hand over her silky hair, heavy with rain water and across her cheek, cradling her chin for a moment, before dropping a little lower.&nbsp; Then he gently caressed the delicate skin of her neck, before spreading his fingers wide and wrapping them loosely around her slim neck, surprised at how much of her neck he could encircle with just one hand.&nbsp; His other hand continued its journey over her breasts, taking a moment to caress both, feeling their tautness and weight before slowly moving down her tummy finally finding the warmth between her legs.&nbsp; Her skin felt chilled�everywhere but here.&nbsp;&nbsp; He slid two fingers inside her tight pussy and pressed his thumb against her clit.&nbsp; He pressed his lips close to her ear and whispered her name�increasing the pressure of his fingers around her throat as the moments passed.&nbsp; 

He gripped her neck a little tighter, and then again, just a little tighter he squeezed.&nbsp; He heard her breathing became more shallow and she thrust her hips forward a bit, attempting to drive his fingers deeper, her hot pussy gripping his fingers.&nbsp; Her focus was shifting slowly back to him, to where he needed it to be, so he squeezed her neck a bit harder, finally, completely cutting off her air.&nbsp; Moments passed in slow motion.&nbsp; Suddenly, as if waking from a dream her eyes shot open and she began to struggle, kicking her feet, which he hadn&#8217;t tied, her sandals flying off, her bare toes slipping &amp; squishing in the mud under her feet.&nbsp; She was trying in vain to wrench away from his grip.&nbsp; 

He began fucking her hard with his fingers and did not release his grip on her throat.&nbsp; �There you are�slut.�&nbsp; he said, �Welcome back.� He paused.&nbsp; Then in an authoritative tone.&nbsp; �You&#8217;re okay.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t panic.�&nbsp; he instructed as her struggling became more frantic.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m going to do what I please, so you may as well accept it.�&nbsp; What he wanted from her wasn&#8217;t penetrating the fog of her growing desperation for air, and he had no intention of&nbsp; letting go until it did.&nbsp; 

�Listen to me.�&nbsp; he demanded in a stern voice, tightening his grip for the last time and feeling his fingers sink deeper into her tender skin, He would have to be less subtle with his instruction this time.&nbsp; �Stop struggling and I&#8217;ll let go.�&nbsp; The futility of her struggle left her with no choice but to obey.&nbsp; On an instinctual level, she realized that she could not break free, struggling wouldn&#8217;t work.&nbsp; It was only in surrendering to his will that she could get what she needed.&nbsp; He felt her entire body go instantly limp under his hands.&nbsp; He took his hand from her pussy and slid his fingers slippery with her juices gently over her lips, still not releasing his grip on her neck.&nbsp;&nbsp; �Open your eyes.�&nbsp; he said, and she did�they were wide with fear.&nbsp; He knew that it was only by using every ounce of self-control she possessed that she was able to lock eyes with him and remain limp and passive under his hand.&nbsp; Satisfied with her response, and anxious to build trust, to keep his word, he released his grip on her throat�.she breathed in deeply and coughed repeatedly, gasping for air.&nbsp; 

�What do you say?�&nbsp; he asked her.&nbsp; She shook her head, still gasping for air.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t understand the question.&nbsp; He slapped her hard across her cheek with his left hand, leaving a red mark.&nbsp; �That&#8217;s what inattentive sluts who make me repeat myself get.�&nbsp; he told her, for future reference, of course, then repeated the question.&nbsp; �What do you say?�&nbsp; She finally caught it up and remembered herself.&nbsp; �Thank you, Sir��&nbsp; she sputtered, inhaling deeply.

After she had caught her breath a bit she dropped her chin to her chest and she was almost startled by the site of her own nakedness.&nbsp; Her nipples were harder and more erect than she had ever seen them.&nbsp; She began to shiver uncontrollably as she watched the wind whip the rain in sheets of fine white mist off the ground as soon as it landed, soaking them both.&nbsp; Thunder roared.&nbsp; She jumped.&nbsp; Lightning flashed.&nbsp; She clamped her jaw to keep her teeth from chattering.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her throat felt funny, her cheek burned.&nbsp; The woods seemed alive with sound and movement as the wind and rain invaded every thing in sight.

He stood back and waited for her to take in her surroundings, to acclimate to the situation.&nbsp; He waited for her to let him know that she was ready for whatever was next.&nbsp;&nbsp; He watched her as she first took in her own nakedness and then the entirety of the rain-drenched, storm-ravaged twilight falling around her.&nbsp; He remained impassive while she looked straight up at the ropes tying her hands and struggled briefly.&nbsp; Waited for her to decide there was no breaking free.&nbsp; She stopped struggling and hung her head, her hair falling over her face.&nbsp; She simply groaned, accepting her own helplessness and then slowly raised her head,&nbsp; her eyes meeting his, reaching out to the only person who could help her.&nbsp; Which, he instinctively knew, was his cue.

He took two steps forward and grabbed a handful of her hair and pulled her head sharply back, exposing the red marks that would fade to dull finger shaped bruises with time on her slim neck and planting slow kisses on her wet skin.&nbsp; The cold caused her skin to be hyper-sensitive, every touch felt extraordinarily intense.&nbsp; His lips continued their exploration of her neck, moving slowly lower.&nbsp; Her lips parted and she let out a soft moan that was lost in the wind as his lips closed over her right nipple.&nbsp; He sucked the water from it and nipped it with his teeth.&nbsp; He used his free hand to knead her other breast, then squeezed and twisted her other nipple between his thumb and forefinger.&nbsp; 

She was fully immersed in her present situation now.&nbsp; She suddenly was acutely aware of the rope biting into her wrists, the rough tree bark scraping against her back, his fingers wrapped firmly in her hair pulling her head back, the cold rain hitting her face, his hot mouth and hands roughly and expertly manipulating her sensitive nipples.&nbsp; He moved his mouth to her other nipple, using his fingers to squeeze the one that had been in his mouth, slippery now with his saliva, until the rain washed it away.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

She pushed her thighs together, applying what pressure she could to her pussy in her present situation, and pushed her breasts out as far as she could, encouraging his attentions.&nbsp; �Ooooh�god, god, god�� she moaned and her whole body convulsed as her first orgasm overcame her, without warning, without permission.&nbsp; �Fuck, fuck�.fuck.�&nbsp; she groaned�damn the rain and the cold and�and�him�for making her feel so�so�fucking�out of control.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m sorry�I&#8217;m sorry��&nbsp; she apologized&nbsp; all the while trying to compose herself &amp; prepare herself for the punishment that was sure to follow.&nbsp; He stopped his manipulations and slapped each breast hard with his bare hand, causing her to wince on the first slap, let out an �Owww�� on the second and finally twist her torso away, on the third, so painful were the blows.

His fingers still wrapped in her hair he planted a firm kiss on her lips, exploring her mouth with his tongue, tasting a combination of her lips, the rain, and just faintly, the pussy juice, that he&#8217;d smeared on her lips earlier.&nbsp; She was breathless and completely immersed in her passion by the time he ended the kiss.&nbsp; Her eyes looked sort of dreamy and dazed.&nbsp; �you,� he said, punctuating his word with another sharp tug of her hair, �are such a dirty little whore�aren&#8217;t you?�&nbsp; She closed her eyes and felt her clit react to his words, almost forgetting to respond with a breathless, �Yes, Sir.�&nbsp; 

�Yes.�&nbsp; he said softly, �Open your eyes, whore.�&nbsp; She did so.&nbsp; �Good girl.�&nbsp; he nodded.&nbsp; �You came without permission.&nbsp; And, if you do it again, it will be the last thing you ever do.�&nbsp; He said it quietly and without emotion.&nbsp; �Is that little whore&#8217;s brain of yours capable of understanding?�&nbsp; She attempted to nod, remembering his fingers tangled in her hair when she tried, then stuttered, �Y-yes, Sir.�&nbsp; she was trembling uncontrollably, from the cold?&nbsp; From his threat?&nbsp; From his touch?&nbsp; A combination?&nbsp; She couldn&#8217;t tell.&nbsp; �Good.�&nbsp; he responded.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m afraid that you&#8217;ve left me with no choice but to put my cock in your tight little ass as a reminder of who is in charge here.&nbsp; What do you think?&nbsp; Do you need a reminded of who&#8217;s in charge here?�&nbsp; It was a trick question.&nbsp; Her mind raced, her heart pounding loud in her ears.&nbsp; yes, no. yes, no.&nbsp; What had been the question? Shit.&nbsp; 

He slapped her cheek again, causing her to cry out this time, tears springing to her eyes and he repeated his question slowly, enunciating each word precisely.&nbsp; �Do you need reminded of who is in charge here?�&nbsp; this time, his voice sounding threatening.&nbsp; �No, Sir.�&nbsp; she responded quickly, and louder than she&#8217;d anticipated due to her frantic desire to say the right thing.&nbsp; He nodded.&nbsp; �Hmmm.&nbsp; I see.�&nbsp; he peered off into the gathering gloom for a moment.&nbsp; �Just so I&#8217;m clear��&nbsp; he said, his voice tight� ��what you&#8217;re saying is, you don&#8217;t think I should put my cock in your ass?�&nbsp; He looked back at her.&nbsp; �Is that it?�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

All the color drained from her face.&nbsp; She realized her mistake too late.&nbsp; He slapped her again, hard.&nbsp; �Pretentious fucking bitch!� he shouted and she started to cry.&nbsp; �Look who&#8217;s got an opinion!&nbsp; You think you get a say in what happens to you?�&nbsp; He yanked at the rope holding her hands, releasing it from the branch above her head without warning, and without its support she crumpled to the ground.&nbsp; She scrambled backwards on her behind, using her arms and legs to scootch so that her back was against the tree.&nbsp; He grabbed her throat and her right leg and pulled her away from the tree as she struggled, forcing her back onto the muddy ground.&nbsp; 

�You wanna be in charge?�&nbsp; he shouted, �Is that it?�&nbsp; She shook her head no, tears streaming down her cheeks.&nbsp; �You can&#8217;t even control yourself!�&nbsp; he continued.&nbsp; �You can&#8217;t even wait for my permission to come!&nbsp; And you wanna call the shots?�&nbsp; he snorted and flipped her over on her tummy in the mud, �flip the fuck over�lay still��&nbsp; he struggled with her�&nbsp; �I said, flip the fuck over��&nbsp; he pushed himself between her legs and put his hands on her hips�quickly yanking her ass into the air in one swift motion.&nbsp; �get your fucking ass up here�good for nothing fucking whore��&nbsp; he reached in his pants and pulled out his cock�throbbing and hard and aching for release� �spread your ass cheeks for me�slut.&nbsp; Do it!&nbsp; Now!�&nbsp; her face and chest pressed into the mud, she reached behind her, and leaving muddy hand prints on her ass held her cheeks open wide for him�her ass was wet with rain and her own juices�he quickly pushed the head of his cock in her tight ass�without the benefit of ceremony or finesse.&nbsp; 

She cried out and he saw her grip tighten on her ass cheeks.&nbsp; �Fuck!&nbsp; Oww�fuck!�&nbsp; she moaned.&nbsp; �Shut the fuck up�and take it.&nbsp; Hold yourself open for me�and fucking take it.&nbsp; It&#8217;s the one thing you&#8217;re good for and you&#8217;re gonna do it right.�&nbsp; he pulled the head completely out and pushed it into her tight ass again, this time harder and a little deeper.&nbsp; �You got that?&nbsp; Now don&#8217;t fucking move�and don&#8217;t you dare fucking come��&nbsp; He pulled his cock out again�precum glistening on the tip�.watching her ass clench tight again� �Beg me to fuck your ass.�&nbsp; she didn&#8217;t delay in her response, �Please, Sir�will you fuck my ass?�&nbsp; He pushed the head back in.&nbsp; �Louder.&nbsp; Say it louder.&nbsp; Tell me you want my thick cock in your ass.&nbsp; Say it..� He pulled it back out�stroked it a few time.&nbsp; �God, god�please��&nbsp; she let go of her ass cheeks and braced her hands on the muddy ground.&nbsp; �Sir�fuck my ass�oh�god�please�please�please�I want your cock�in my ass.�&nbsp; He shoved it back in�this time, as hard as he could�as deep as he could.&nbsp; He gripped her hips and pounded his hard cock into her ass brutally�her moans increasing in volume and frequency�her breath tearing from her lungs in ragged, noisy gasps�repeating the things he&#8217;d told her to say�in between. 

Her words soon became incoherent, her ass was gripping him hard�and she was driving herself backwards to meet his thursts�she was going to come�&nbsp; �Don&#8217;t you come without permission.� he warned�feeling very close himself� �Do you wanna come?�&nbsp;&nbsp; She made a sound like a sob.&nbsp; �Is that a yes?�&nbsp; he asked�&nbsp; �Ask me.�&nbsp; he pumped even harder�&nbsp; �You dirty little slut�.say it.&nbsp; Say, &#8216;Sir, can I come with your cock in my ass?&#8217;��&nbsp; 

She managed a version of that�indiscernible, unless you knew what she was trying to say�he was ready to fill her ass with cum, so it was close enough for him.&nbsp; �Permission granted��&nbsp; he groaned feeling her ass grip his cock�the spasms radiating through her body�causing him to cum�filling her�.and then continuing to fuck her limp form until he was completely spent, slipping his cock out and watching his cum drip from her ass.&nbsp; 

The rain had long since stopped, unnoticed by either of them�she left her muddy, torn clothes on the ground and he slipped his shirt on her shoulders�she held it closed in the front and they made their way back to the house�the moon was peaking out from behind the last vestiges of the storm clouds now, lighting the way�.acting as the only witness to their play, and they both felt certain he would keep their secret.&nbsp;
