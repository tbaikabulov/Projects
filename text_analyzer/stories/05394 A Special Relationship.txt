A Special Relationship

&nbsp;

by Velvetglove

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Toni was in a meeting with her
design team when her cell phone buzzed like a mini vibrator. It was her
super-slim personal one, not her business Blackberry. She stared at it, a hot
flush pimpling her neck, as the noise continued,
signifying she had received a text message.

Around her, seven faces stared
expectantly, paused, watching.

She lunged at it and flipped it
face down as the throbbing ceased.

�Yes ?�
she snapped at the young female designer who�d been speaking, before her phone
interrupted them. �Carry on.�

The meeting continued for five
minutes but she barely heard a word.

�Lets take
a break.� She said. �Back here in ten.�

&nbsp;

After they had all filed out of her
office, she looked at the little square screen. It was a simple coded message
of just seven digits:

&nbsp;

! ! ! x x x

G

&nbsp;

The hot flush shot from her brain,
straight down her spine to between her legs. She screwed her eyes shut, exhaled
a deep breath and put her hand out to steady herself. Every time it happened it
was the same. A potent cocktail of emotions; shame, jealousy, excitement, lust,
frustration, anger and, yes, love. She could picture it; hear, smell, taste.
Her vintage digital said 15.22. She still had to concentrate another three
hours or so.

&nbsp;

The meeting continued. Toni was
Creative Director. The six women and single man round the table, who mostly
constituted her senior team, relied on her, looked for guidance, leadership,
inspiration. Somehow she still managed to give them her best, wrapping up another
week of intense creativity.

At six thirty, she closed the
meeting.

�Good weekend guys. See you bright
and early Monday.�

Files were closed, papers cleared.

Davina, a young, pretty design student, who�d been taking the meeting�s
minutes, collected all the mugs onto a tray.

�Night everyone!� shouted a couple
of the unattached girls merrily, already running late for their dates.

�Good night, Toni.� Davina chirped. �Have a nice weekend.�

Toni stared at her desk when they
had all left her office. Her salary slip was in her in tray. Every fourth
Friday was payday. She pushed the envelope, a couple of glossy magazines and a
bunch of unread memos into her satchel.

Then she turned out the light and
exited �one part� of her life.

A change is as good as a rest.

It was time for the �other part� to
take over.

&nbsp;

*** *** ***

&nbsp;

She made it home with 3 minutes to
spare.

19.57

Her curfew started at eight
o�clock.

But she could tell the house was
empty anyway. She let herself in and placed her satchel on the chair in the hall.
She walked quickly from room to room, opening the doors and flicking on the
lights.

Living Room,
fine.

Dining Room,
fine.

His office, locked.

Kitchen, a mess.

She mounted the stairs and went
into her bedroom. Sorry, his bedroom. A mess.

Ensuite
bathroom, a mess.

Spare bedroom � hers - fine.

Shower room, fine.

Box room, locked.

She glanced at her watch. He might
be back at any time.

In spite of her end-of-the-week
lethargy, she returned to the main bedroom and stripped off her office gear,
quickly pulling on a clean thong, a black push-up quarter-cup bra, sluttish
fishnet stockings, suspender belt, black micro-skirt, overly tight silk blouse,
a French maid�s apron and finally an uncomfortable pair of stiletto heels.

She looked at herself in the full
length mirror.

As ever, the
costume was too cheap and clich� to look sexy to her. But it was what he liked and that�s all that counted.

That alone made
her feel sexy.

She ran her fingers through her
hair. She was a brunette, with it cut shoulder length, and a chic fringe, like
that hot French actress.

She would have liked to spend a bit
more time on her appearance but there was too much to do.

20.09

She stared properly at the double
bed. There is a subtle difference between a �slept in� unmade bed and a �fucked
in� unmade bed. Not just the scents and smells and stains. It�s the way the
bottom sheet is crumpled, the pillows cast aside, the blankets or duvet on the
floor.

Of course, the text message had
forewarned her but the evidence always stabbed her deliciously, agonisingly, in
the neglected depths of her body and soul. Of all the tortures he put her
through � or rather, that she put herself through � this was the one that hit
her right where it hurt the most.

Antonia turned back to the mirror.
Such a posh name for a girl like her, which was the reason she had been called
Toni as long as she could remember. Why did she have to put herself through this ?

What possible defect in her
chromosomes had caused it ?

She gazed at her high cheekbones,
button nose, slender red lips and into her accusing emerald eyes, with just a
few lines now appearing at the sides.

She knew she wasn�t beautiful,
but then again, not many men would throw her out of their beds either.

She surveyed her full cleavage
spilling out of her the 34B black bra that was a size too small, over the top
of the stretched blouse.

She looked exactly what she was.

Sighing, she scooped the bottom
sheet of the bed and removed the pillow cases. Time to get to
work.

21.40

An hour and a half later, she
waited in silence kneeling by the front door. Each room was now clean, the
sheets were tumbling in the dryer, his meal awaited on the table. She hadn�t
eaten herself, or drunk, or even relieved her bladder of the cups of tea that
had kept her going through the afternoon meeting.

22.30

He often put her through tests like
this. Not ringing, no texts, nothing. Her entire Friday evening gone, wasted.
Sometimes she nearly succumbed and said fuck it all. Why should she, a
successful 36 year old woman, let herself be abused by this upstart 24 year old
so-called �musician ?� Yes, he was gorgeous, and maybe
he was talented, but neither of those things really had much to do with it.

22.41

A noise of the
doorstep. At last. The
bell rang. She quickly rose and opened it.

He stood swaying on the step,
smirking at her in a drunken haze.

�Mouth.�

She tried to pull him inside the
hall, at least.

He tittered, looking exaggeratedly
left and right down the street.

�Nobody�s coming.�

He fumbled drunkenly with the
zipper of his jeans.

�Mouth !�

His tone was firmer now, his
American accent more pronounced, the way he elongated the �ou�
sound in mouth, compared with the more clipped English sound.

Hesitantly, reluctant but unable to
stop herself, Toni knelt down on the doormat and helped him extract his swollen
penis from his pants.

She opened her mouth into a wide
�o�. Behind him there was only darkness and street lamps but somebody might
walk past at any time.

His hot, beer-loaded urine splashed
her face and then he was inside her, filling her throat and gums until she
gagged, and its bitterness overflowed onto the mat, and he was chuckling,
hosing it all over her coiffed hair, clean face and pressed blouse.

23.11

Half an hour later, she refilled
his mug with black coffee, clearing his plate. While he ate, he had let her
shower and change, this time just into a white towelling robe. He reached
inside it and cuddled her to him, nibbling on her nipple.

�May I eat something
?� she asked, not twisting away.

He opened her robe and tweaked the
flesh on her hips. She shivered and stared down, ashamed at the pinch of excess
skin between his thumb and finger. Toni was nearer forty than thirty, his age
and half again, and she was in as good shape as any of her contemporaries. But
she knew he compared her with the honed, skin-tight 18-21 year old students he
hung out with.

�Please.�

He perused the plate of chicken
salad she had laid out for herself; lettuce leaves, sliced tomatoes, cucumber,
little yellow corncobs and a cold leg of chicken. Slowly he picked up a large
floppy green leaf.

�Spread.� He said, his voice less slurred, more in control now.

She knew better than to argue. She
widened her stance and pushed her hips forward slightly, giving him access. Her
mound was smooth and hairless and her labia pouted, slick with desire.

His dark, almost black, shining
eyes looked up at her, mocking her, as he wiped the lettuce through her cunt as
if cleaning her with a tissue. Then he sniffed it.

�Been a good girl ?� he asked, the word �good� drawn out in an exaggerated
Texan drawl.

She nodded, emitting a slight gasp.
�Yes.�

He stared deep into her eyes; five,
ten, fifteen seconds, seeking any tell tale signs of dishonesty.

There were none.

She knew better than to try to lie.
They didn�t use chastity belts. Self control was a better, harder, test. It had
been two weeks - fourteen whole days - since he had permitted her an orgasm.
She wasn�t even allowed to request one. The decision was entirely his,
voluntarily given, if he felt in the mood.

She met his gaze, simultaneously
admiring his chiselled beauty even though he was the worse for wear. She adored
his unusual combination of Ivy League and Latin looks, from his lush, layered
hair and olive skin, to his perfectly symmetrical teeth and classic jaw line. A young Clooney; her own �Gorgeous
George�.

�Turn.�

She knew what was coming but she
controlled her expression. Carefully, she turned away from him, bending over,
flipping the robe over her back so it hung down over her shoulders to the
kitchen floor.

She felt his fingers opening her
bottom, sensed him inspecting her, then screwed her
eyes shut in humiliation as the lettuce leaf wiped her crack.

�Wait.�

She winced as his fingers pushed
one of the tiny corncobs into her dry anus, easing it fully inside her. It was
small. Nothing but her pride was hurt. She stayed motionless, listening to him
breathing.

�Okay. You can eat now.�

His hand appeared, placing her
plate on the floor under her face. She dropped to her knees and wolfed her
salad on all fours without using her hands. She heard him pouring himself a
whisky.

00.35

He lay on
the bed now, fingers laced behind his head, while she soaped his cock and
sponged it dry with a hot flannel. There were telltale crusty bits of dried
fluid along his shaft and in his pubic hair from his afternoon activities.

She didn�t ask, and he didn�t say.

His right to fuck other women was
unlimited and unquestioned. Those were their rules.

�Can I please you
?� she asked, when she�d finished, lowering her head to his waist
suggestively, pursing her lips. She knew her lips were too thin and she looked
silly trying to pout like that French actress he fancied, but she tried.

He turned and smiled sadly at her,
cruelty giving way to kindness, as it sometimes did at moments like this.

�You got my text
?�

She nodded.

�I�ve got a new one. A real stunner.�

She kept her composure, nodding
again.

�I�m fucked out, doll. You couldn�t
get my dick up tonight if you were half your age and twice as hot. Too much hooch too. Maybe in the morning, eh
?�

She nodded, moving her head away.

�She borrowed some of your stuff.
I�m not sure what.�

�Er �
fine. That�s okay.�

�I said for her to help herself.�
He turned onto his side, smiling at her.

�Sure.�

�You�ll tell her she can keep it,
right.� Statement, not a question.

�Wh � what ? When will I m � meet her ?�

He shrugged, teasing. �Soon.�

�What has she � taken
?�

�Not much. She�s taller, but you�re
a size bigger than her she said. A sweater; that black cashmere one you just
bought. The one you were real excited about. Her hooters looked great in it. I
don�t know. A shirt, I think. A leather belt she liked. Some
jewellery, but nothing valuable. Just stuff from your
pot.�

She listened in silence, wanting to
dash to her wardrobe and dressing table to see what some young bitch had helped
herself to. The humiliation was intense.

How this young man knew just how
to do it to her.

�Yes.� She mumbled. �She can keep
it.�

He grinned. �Horny
?�

It took a moment for Toni to
compute the sudden change of topic.

She nodded. �Very.�

�Then maybe we�ll find a way for
you to get a little excitement over this weekend. If you�re
good. Now, turn off that light.�

In the dark, he kissed her softly
on the forehead, cheek and finally lips.

�Sleep tight, doll.�

�Sleep tight � Sir.� She replied,
turning to stroke his back while he drifted off to sleep.

Within two minutes, she heard the
quiet rumble of his snoring.

&nbsp;

*** *** ***

&nbsp;

She slipped out of the bed at
07.45.

She�d have liked to have slept more
but she was wide awake and there were chores to do downstairs. She made herself
a peppermint tea and started on some ironing, also jotting down a shopping list
as she thought of things they needed for the house.

At nine, she made coffee, poured
grapefruit juice and took a tray with a mug, milk carton and an empty glass jug
upstairs.

Gently, she kissed him awake.

He rubbed his eyes. �Time ?�

�Just gone nine.�

He grimaced. �Fetch me something
for my head.�

She went into the bathroom and
grabbed a couple of pills. He took them with a gulp of the juice.

�Oh boy.� He squinted at her as she opened the curtains slightly. �Everything
hurts.� He let rip with an enormous, early morning flatulent fart under the
duvet. �Come here, doll.�

She walked back to the bed as he
threw back the cover. He was hard. A gust of fetid air slammed into her
nostrils.

�Jug.�

She knelt by the side of the bed
and laid the glass jug on his hard, muscled abdomen, circling it round his
erection.

�Mmm ��
he groaned in relief.

His urine, dark and plentiful,
hosed the jug. She tipped it slightly as it steadily filled, careful not to let
any spill on him.

�Mmm ��
she echoed admiringly. �Thank you, Sir !� It wasn�t
enough for them that she drank his piss. She had to be grateful too.

She placed the sloshing, three
quarters full jug back on the tray and passed him his steaming mug of coffee.

�Sleep well ?�
he asked her, as she propped his pillow up behind him.

�So-so. You snored.�

He smiled at her. �So would you if
you�d had the day I had yesterday.�

She waited, wondering if he�d tell
her any more in the cold light of the morning. But he didn�t.

He looked down at his still thick
cock. No longer piss-hard but now semi-erect for all the right reasons.

�I think he could use a morning
wake up call too.� He said.

She grinned, pathetically pleased.

Anything was better than
nothing.

�How would he like to be woken ?�

�Nothing too
strenuous. How about you just give him a little
phone call ?�

She knelt by the side of the bed
again and lowered her head to his waist. As sexily as possible, she trailed her
wet tongue across the line of his hips into his thick pubic tangle, then drew him into her mouth, tasting a few lingering bitter
drops.

He sighed, settled lower on the
bed, and she felt his fingers winding themselves into strands of her hair.

She worked in silence, doing it
just as he liked. The other men in her life had been grateful for any-old-how,
but he insisted on her going �back to the design stage�, to learn exactly what he
wanted a blowjob to be.

Long, full, rhythmic strokes, her
lips tight, but not sucking too hard, using her tongue
as a replica thumb to tease the veined shaft. It wasn�t easy. But then, she�d
had a lot of practice since she�d met him.

She ignored the churning gurgle in
her ear as she worked. His stomach was rumbling and then another loud fart exploded
inches from her head. As ever, he was completely shameless, merely sighing
contentedly on the pillow.

Her neck started to tire and her
jaw ached. But she kept her banned fingers away. She was only allowed to use
her hands if he said so. Her lips made a vulgar slurping noise as she sucked a
bit too hard.

His fingers tightened their grip on
her coiffed hair.

�Careful !�
he admonished. �Use your fingers now.�

Gratefully, she slid her slender
right fist round his glistening shaft.

�Lick my prostate.� He murmured.

She shifted position, sliding over,
in between his legs, still stroking his erection rhythmically, bending her head
so her tongue could lather his balls, then down into his moist crack.

�Mmm � deeper.�

She knew the signs. His breathing
quickened, his muscles tensed, his penis pulsed, and then he started to
chuckle.

She couldn�t see but she could feel
jet after jet, while she buried her tongue as far as she could inside him,
rubbing her nose against his prostate.

After a half minute or so, he
released her hair. Without being asked, she placed a trail of kisses up from
his anus, over his scrotum, along the heavy vein of his erection, and then she
surveyed the fan-shaped splatter of pearly oyster fluid, streaks running from
his abdomen up to his pectorals, and two copious pools in his chest and navel.

�May I ?�
she asked, convincingly.

He raised his head and opened one
eye, gloating proudly at the mess he had made. He nodded disinterestedly.

Slowly, she lowered her lips.

She grimaced under her fringe. However
long this went on, she would never get to like the taste. Or
the texture. Just because she was submissive, just because she did
whatever he told her, didn�t mean she had to enjoy it.

She had never come across a man who
produced so much. Not that she was an expert, by any means; six boyfriends in
nineteen years and she hadn�t even sucked off all of those. But she had checked
out the men in the handful of XXX �come shot� films that she�d watched with
him. George was, by a distance, the most prolific sperm machine she had seen.

In spite of her distaste,
probably because of it, she could feel her own hard nipples brushing against
his skin, her heat below open and moist in longing for something, anything, to
release her sexual need.

Within two minutes, his washboard
torso shone clean.

�Oh, man.� He said, clambering out
of bed. �That coffee worked a treat.�

He pulled the bathroom door
semi-closed. She heard him bang the seat cover up. She wiped her lips dry
cautiously and started straightening the bed. There was a grunt from the
bathroom.

�Hey !� he
called out. �You got paid yesterday, right ?�

�Yes.�

�Yahoo.� He exclaimed, against the background noise of bathroom ablutions.
�Any news on your bonus yet ?�

�No. Next month.�

�Shit !�

She plumped up the pillows, still
making the bed.

�I hope you don�t need much
yourself this month.� He called out.

She squeezed her eyes shut. This
was so hard.

�Er � no. That�s okay. I�ll
be fine.�

�Good. I don�t want to have to pimp
you out.�

It was his idea of a joke. There
was an audible chuckle.

A minute later she heard the toilet
roll holder whirling, and the sound of tissue being ripped off. Then a repeat. Then a third time, followed
by the seat slamming down and then a gush of tap water from the basin.

She waited for the sound of the
flush. In vain.

He came out grinning, drying his
hands on a towel.

She held open his dressing gown for
him and he shucked one arm in, then the other. She tied it tight round him.

�Let�s go make a transfer.�

&nbsp;

*** *** ***

&nbsp;

Naturally, he knew her account
details and PIN code, but he still liked her to do it. She logged on and
brought up her balances. There it was, her new current account balance, plump
with this month�s salary credit.

He eased her out of the chair and
took her place.

�Go make me another coffee and a
bacon sandwich.�

She watched him out of the corner
of her eye while the water boiled and she placed the bacon under the grill. He
jotted on a pad and tapped the calculator on her desk. She knew he was leaving
her enough for the monthly standing orders and bills plus a modest daily amount
hopefully sufficient for her travel to work and a bite of lunch.

The remainder: kapow !

She took the mug of coffee over on
a tray.

He smiled up at her. A guilty, amused smirk.

She saw immediately why. He had
raided her deposit account too. Cleaned it out. Her
�rainy day� fund.

�George !�

A dark cloud scudded across his
handsome face in an instant.

�Yes ?�

Immediately she backtracked.
�Sorry, it�s just ��

There was a long silence.

�It�s just for one month.� He said,
matter-of-factly. �There�s stuff I need now. But so long as you get a big
enough bonus next month, we�ll put some of it back in your little old deposit
account. Right ?�

She lowered her head, steeling
herself.

�Sure.�

He laughed, patting her on the bottom.

�Now mix yourself a breakfast smoothie, yeah ?�

She gulped.

�Make it nice and strong. Say, two
thirds, one third. I want to see it before you drink it. And don�t burn my
bacon.�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

He was in his email account when
she brought over his sandwich.

He minimised the screen so she
couldn�t read it.

�Show me.� He said.

She held up the tall glass tumbler,
full to the brim. She had blended the entire jug of his morning urine with
plain yoghurt in a ratio of two parts to one, all frothed up in the liquidiser.
The mix was as unappetising as it sounds.

�Offer me your cunt while you
guzzle your breakfast down.�

She stood, wide legged, holding her
robe apart with her hands, then put the glass to her lips and tipped her head
back. 

He studied her, nonchalantly taking
a bite of his sandwich, fingering her open with his left hand. She choked
slightly on her drink as his middle finger brushed her clitoris.

She managed to drain it in one
swig, blanking her mind, swallowing it down, and then wiped the froth from her
lips.

She showed him the empty glass. 

He grinned. �Regrets ?�

She shook her head. �None.�

A question flashed through her
mind; the truth ?

�This is going to be a special
weekend.� He said, lightly rubbing circles round her engorged clit, his dark
eyes smiling up at her in amusement.

She couldn�t help frowning
slightly. �Thank you � Sir.�

He removed his finger agonisingly
slowly. Her hips followed momentarily as if attached to his hand by an
invisible cord. He gave her a sly smirk.

�Look at you, you filthy cumslut.�

He stared at her shiny residue on
his fingertip.

�We�re going to test your limits
this weekend. Or would you rather we stop this all right now and I get out your
life for good ?�

She bit her lip. Could she truly
answer that question ? Even before she�d finished asking herself she knew the
answer.

�No.� she blurted. �I�ll do
whatever you say.�

He looked at her for thirty
seconds, munching on his sandwich. Then, just for a brief second, his dark eyes
brightened mischievously, like the reflection of a full moon rippling on a lake
at midnight. 

�Remember, whatever I say, whatever
I do, it will be in character. I won�t mean it. Underneath it all, I love you.
Carry that thought.�

Her heart leapt. Quaking, she
nodded, as his facemask turned cold again.

�Then get yourself upstairs and run
my bath.�

She dipped her head again
hurriedly, closing her robe.

�And clean out that lavatory pan.�
He added. �Without flushing.�

&nbsp;

She deserved this.

Not in any fundamental way. She was
too intelligent to think that she was inferior as a human being. No, she
deserved this because she was weak enough to give in to her cravings. Like a
nicotine or booze, drugs or gambling addict, she had to pay for her addiction.

She stared down. Like his earlier
orgasm, he had produced an impressive display; there was a thick mush of soggy
tissue and excrement filling the bottom of the pan. But he had also made sure
to splatter the back and sides of the toilet with heavy brown brush strokes.

She was armed with her bare hands,
two plastic buckets and an old toothbrush of hers. Holding her breath, she
lowered an arm into the pan and scooped up a handful of the soggy mush.
Controlling her urge to vomit, she carefully lifted it and dropped it into one
of the buckets by her knees.

�Smile.�

She looked up as his mobile phone
clicked.

�Nice one.� He said, looking at the
photo.

She stifled her objection and
lowered her arm into the pan again. She felt him watching her as she
transferred second, third and fourth loads into the bucket. Then she heard him
turn off the bath taps himself and check the water temperature with his
swirling hand.

�Hurry up. That�s making quite a
stink.�

She quickly scooped up the
remaining mush two-handed as he settled back into the hot bath with a sigh.

Next she gripped the toothbrush and
began scouring the sides of the porcelain. Again, she sensed his eyes on her
back as she laboriously removed his drying tyre marks. She dipped the brush in
the pan water and scrubbed, dipped and scrubbed, working frantically.

�Finished ?�

�Nearly.�

�Fucking hurry up.�

Eventually everything was clean but
for the filthy brown water. She washed her hands and then filled the second
bucket with clean cold water from the basin and emptied it into the pan as a
manual flush.

She checked. It was almost clean. She
filled the bucket with water again and added a splash of green pine essence for
fragrance. He liked it to be spick, span and scented before he used it again.

This time, after she�d emptied it
into the pan, the white porcelain gleamed.

�I�ve finished.�

She looked at him lying back in the
steaming bathwater.

�Take that bucket out to the shed.
But don�t empty it.�

As she went downstairs to the back
door, she shivered with apprehension. Toilet games did nothing for her. She put
up with them at best. She knew his scatological desires ran much deeper than
hers.

Back in the bathroom, he smiled at
her.

�I want a special dinner tonight.�

She perked up. Cooking for him was
something she truly enjoyed. It was subservient in a way, but also rewarding,
and relaxing after her working week.

�You choose the menu but make it
the best. Buy the ingredients, spend the day preparing, I�ll be back about
six.�

Her mood changed again.

He was going out all day.

�Table for two. Candles, linen,
glasses. Get us some nice wine.�

He chuckled as her frown turned
into a smile. She knew he could read her like a book. He lent forward in the
bath.

�Come soap my back.�

At that moment, his cell phone
started blaring out a bass guitar solo; the famous intro to �Smoke on the
Water�.

�Pass it here.� He said, wiping his
hands on a towel.

She watched him survey the caller
number and smile.

�Hi.� He said into the phone.
�How�re you feeling babe?�

She started busying herself,
picking up his bathrobe from the floor.

�Me too. Rough as hell. Shouldn�t have
had that last one. But I�m feeling better now.�

There was a pause while he
listened.

�Sure. What time ? � Fine. Noon it
is.�

Another, longer pause.

�Hey, great idea. We�ll have a
party �. yeah, she loves parties.�

She felt his eyes on her back as
she put paste on her toothbrush.

�Okay. Can�t wait. I�m stiff
already. Bye babe � bye.�

She turned back to take the phone
from him.

�Right.� He said, clambering out of
the bath. �Gotta move. Take what you need from my
wallet. Three twenties. Sixty quid enough ?�

She draped the huge white bath
towel round him.

�Oh yeah. And make that a table for
three tonight.�

&nbsp;

*** *** ***

&nbsp;

Six o�clock came and went. He was
never on time.

She had spent all eight hours
preparing. First showering, dressing and applying a bit of mascara, then
walking to the local shops, buying fresh seafood, beef, vegetables, salad,
bread, butter, cream, other ingredients, two bottles of white wine and a
special red. Then hours cutting, dicing, marinading,
slicing, laying the table, arranging flowers, making it all as perfect as she
could.

At five, she had showered again and
changed. She hadn�t been given guidance about what to wear. She chose a sexy
black cocktail dress, with black lingerie underneath, stockings, heels and her
diamond earrings. She brushed her hair carefully and reapplied her mascara,
adding blush and a dash of lipstick. Then she placed the white wine in an ice
bucket, uncorked the red and stared at the kitchen clock.

Each minute dragged by. She
longed for, yet dreaded, his arrival. Would he be alone ?

Was it all a wind up ?

Or would he be accompanied ?

What would she be like ?

Oh shit, she longed for a drink
to calm her nerves. But he didn�t allow her to drink alcohol unless invited.

There was a noise of the doorstep.
The bell rang. He had his keys with him but as usual hadn�t bothered using
them.

She opened the door.

And there stood the most stunning
blonde girl she had ever seen.

Toni gasped.

The girl tilted her head to one
side, an amused smile on her face.

�Toni, right ?�

She nodded. The girl was like
something out of Baywatch. A blonde bombshell of
bronze, blue and boobs. Twenty, maybe twenty one at most.

�I�m Jess.�

Toni shook her head to clear it,
turning the gesture into a welcoming nod.

�Hi. I�m sorry. Come in.�

The girl�s hair was the colour and
gloss of melting butter, the eyes as blue as a Moroccan sky, the bronze glow
looked a natural suntan, and the cleavage was displayed like two weapons of
mass distinction.

Jess caught Toni�s gaze. She
giggled.

�Oh yes. Thanks. I love it.�

There was a necklace. Lifted
from Toni�s jewellery pot the day before.

Toni ushered her into the front
room.

�I�m � er
� glad you like it. Er � is George � ?�

�Isn�t he here yet ?�

Jess dropped her bag and jumped
back into the sofa as if she owned the place. She was wearing a tight, low cut
top, fashionable denim jeans and a pair of strappy,
fuck-me sandals.

�No.�

�Get me a drink, yeah ? I�m
parched.� In spite of her looks, Jess was no Californian beach babe. The accent
was Thames Estuary; straight middle class, south east England.

Toni swallowed. �Sure. White wine
okay ?�

�Whatever.�

Toni staggered into the kitchen.
She rushed to open the bottle and pour a glass, afraid to leave the invader
alone for too long.

�Here.�

Jess took the glass and drained it
half empty in one gulp.

She looked at her.

�You not drinking ? �. Oh no, he
doesn�t let you, does he ?�

Toni blushed.

Jess flashed a smile. A glare of
brilliant white teeth.

But her blue eyes didn�t sparkle at
all.

�You really do everything he
says ?�

There was a long silence. How
did this happen so fast ?

�Yes.� She sighed.

�And he said you�d do everything
I say too.�

�He did ?�

Jess fished out a cell phone. �You wanna call and check ?�

It was a dare. Both of them knew
he�d be pissed off.

Toni shook her head, lowering her
eyes.

�Fill my glass.�

When she returned, Jess had laid
down full length, feet up, on the sofa.

�Lift up the hem of your dress.�

Slowly, screwing her eyes shut,
Toni obeyed.

�Look at me, bitch.�

She stared down at the perfect
little evil tormentor.

Jess reached out and pushed aside
the gusset of Toni�s panties. The girl�s sharp, red talon burrowed inside her
labia.

�He said it�s two weeks since you
last came ?�

She took another deep breath and
nodded. �Yes.�

�Fuuuuck
! You�re not kidding ? You really don�t diddle your hot little clam when he�s
not around ?�

Indignant, she shook her head.

Jess burst out laughing. An unkind,
bullying, hyena-like bray.

�Sick, sick, sick. But �� she
shrugged, �� such fun !�

&nbsp;

Toni showed her round the house;
dining room, kitchen, main bedroom, ensuite bathroom,
spare bedroom, shower room. His office and the box room were still locked.

Jess nosed everywhere, picking
things up, looking in drawers. She patted the double bed and opened the
cupboard on Toni�s side of the bed.

�I�ve seen it all before.� She
said. �But it�s nice to have the lady of the house take me round.� She said
�lady of the house� with a sarcastic sneer.

There was the sound of the key in
the front door lock.

�Hi !� It was a familiar American
accent. �Anyone home ?�

�We�re upstairs.� Jess called back
before Toni could reply.

�Already ?� he replied, with a
laugh.

She followed Jess down the
staircase.

And there, standing in the hall,
was George, alongside a young, dark skinned man. He looked Indian. On second
thoughts, Arab or North African. He was early twenties, with gold rimmed
spectacles, thinning hair and a pudgy, slightly geeky appearance.

She dug her nails into the palms of
her hands to control herself.

What�s going on ?

�Bonsoir, ladies.� Said George with
a mock bow. �You�ve met.�

Jess gave Toni a sideways glance.
�Oh yes � we�re friends already.�

It was evident Jess knew the other
man too. She kissed him on the cheek.

�Hassan,
Toni.� George said. �Toni, meet our friend Hassan.�

He held out an elegant, effeminate
brown hand. It was surprisingly thin for a boy who was plump and clearly
somewhat overweight. Toni held out hers and he took it, raising it to his
mouth, brushing it with his lips.

�Enchanted.� He said, his liquid
brown eyes like chocolate.

�Let�s go sit in the living room.
Toni, fetch us drinks, yeah ?�

&nbsp;

A table for three indeed !

She spent the next hour serving
drinks and cooking the meal, then the following two hours serving it, while
replenishing their wine glasses, and washing up.

Only Hassan
paid her any attention, saying thank you, acknowledging her presence, leaning
aside when she cleared the plates.

To George and Jess she may just as
well not have been there.

�We�ll have coffee and drinks in
the other room.� George announced, his first words to her in three hours. Not
once had he commented on the meal or anything.

After they were sat comfortably and
she had poured them coffees, whiskies, and wine for Jess, Toni hovered in the
doorway.

Jess had snuggled up next to
George, his arm around her, on the sofa. Hassan was
sat demurely in the best armchair.

�Hungry ?� Jess asked her.

Toni nodded. She hadn�t eaten since
a snack at lunchtime.

�Bring a plate of scraps through.�
Jess instructed.

Toni blanched. This was going
too far.

�Look � I ��

She struggled for words.

Jess shrugged, looking up at
George.

�I told you. She�s not committed.
Let�s go. Get your stuff.�

George shifted on the sofa.

�Wait !� She gasped. �Okay, I�ll do
it.�

In the kitchen, she patted cold
water on the back of her neck and took some deep breaths, then scooped up a
plateful of leftovers; bits from the seafood starter, fat bits they�d left from
the beef, a muck of cold veg and salad and curdled
sauce from their plates.

She carried the plate into the
room.

�Lay it here, between my feet.�
Jess said, beaming.

George was smirking too, happy
to relax and let his bitch take over.

�Get down on all fours.�

She complied, descending into a
deeper sub-space than she�d ever been before. The heat from her embarrassed
cheeks travelled down her body to her guts like a scalding drink.

She stared at the yucky plate
nestled between the girl�s strappy sandals.

�Arse in the air. Head down. Eat !
And no hands.�

Hiding her grimace, she lowered her
lips to a cold prawn.

Suddenly, soft music filled the
room. George had clicked on one of her jazz CDs. Hassan
asked him a question. George replied.

She chewed the prawn, then ate a
bit of beansprout. They were ignoring her, talking
amongst themselves, maybe not even watching.

Over the music, she heard their conversation.
It had turned to a familiar topic; sex. She heard kisses, a giggle, George and
Jess frisking on the sofa.

�Really ?� Jess shrieked. �Never ?�

Hassan�s soft voice protested. �It�s not so easy for us. Girls don�t sleep
with anybody before marriage. Well, very few do, except hookers.�

�So it�s not just because
you�re tubby, my fat friend ?� George laughed.

�That�s rude !� Jess giggled.

�No.� Hassan
protested pleasantly. �Our women like fat. It�s associated with wealth and
comfort.�

Toni nibbled, and licked, and
listened, feeling like dirt.

Suddenly Jess�s sandal prodded her.

�Hey. You want us to stay or leave
?�

Toni looked up. �To stay � please.�

�In that case,� the girl flashed
her perfect white teeth triumphantly, �get up and remove that dress.�

Toni looked from her to George and
back. It was do, or die.

Slowly, she rose, stood, and as
proudly as possible, unzipped her dress and then lifted it up over her head and
placed it on a chair.

She stood in the centre of the room
in just her black underwear, stockings and heels. Normally she was quite
satisfied with her own breasts but they were nothing compared to Jess�s
spectacular display.

She felt Hassan�s
eyes on her and saw him smile sheepishly.

�Lose the panties.� Said Jess,
staring coldly at her. 

She couldn�t do that !

She thumbed her waistband and
slowly lowered her pants, stepping out of them and placing them by her dress.

�Cute.� Jess observed. �I�d say
past her �best by� date and a bit rough round the edges, but still cute. What
do you reckon, Hassan ?�

�Enchanted. Cute indeed.�

�Go over to Hassan
and let him feel you.�

In a trance, she staggered over to
his chair and stood, legs apart.

Slowly, like a brown snake, his arm
reached out and hovered by her hip. Then his hand touched her leg, sending
electric shocks round her entire body. She whimpered a tiny moan.

He smiled at her, paused then,
emboldened, his soft fingers traced a line up to her waist, over her tummy to
her bra. He fingered her breasts one by one, rubbing his thumb through the lace
over her hardening nipples.

At the edge of her vision, she
could see George and Jess in a deep embrace, their tongues entwined. But Jess�s
blue eyes were still glancing over George�s shoulder at her and Hassan. 

Hassan�s fingers moved lower, back down to her waist, and then lower.

�Legs wider.� Jess called out,
coming up for air.

Toni spread herself obscenely.

Hassan raised an eyebrow up at her and grinned. He lifted his other arm
and used both hands to hold apart the lips of her vagina. He used his thumbs
and forefingers to spread her and then peered inside.

�Serves the purpose, my friend.�

The voice was George�s, evaluating
her like some blow up sex doll.

She felt Hassan�s
fingers sliding over her slick folds.

�She�s very wet.�

�That�s nothing.� George said.

�Go sit in that chair.� Said Jess,
jumping up excitedly.

The room contained the sofa and
armchair that the others were sat in, plus a pair of high backed chairs, one of
which she had laid her dress and panties on. Finally, next to the TV, there was
a second armchair, with a rattan back and wooden arms.

She sat down on the armchair�s
plump cushion.

Jess fished in her bag and
extracted a long piece of plastic.

�Sit back.� Jess pushed her down
into the chair. �Legs over the sides of the arms.�

Toni lay as if she was on her
gynaecologist�s table, legs in stirrups. She stared at the huge, flesh coloured
vibrator Jess was brandishing. She owned one that she had purchased before she
met George. It was a standard, nice sized Rabbit.

The one Jess held was something
else entirely; completely oversized, both long and thick, with exaggerated
ridges round the middle of the shaft and a band of protruding rubber pinpricks
at the base, just above the battery handle.

�Bought today, in Soho, with you in
mind dear.� Jess said, licking her lips. �With your own cash ! Expensive. But
you�re worth it.�

She stared at it. Mesmerised. Where
would it all go ?

Jess seemed to read her mind.

�Well, let�s see shall we ?�

Toni gasped as Jess applied the
crown to her drooling labia.

�No need for any lube, is there ?�

The first inches slid in easily.
Toni flushed with shame. Not just with embarrassment at the act but in how
easily she had absorbed the monstrous helmet.

Jess nodded, clearly impressed.
�You sure you haven�t had kids ?�

The ridges were more difficult.
Each was slightly thicker than the previous one. Toni gasped and grimaced as
her body struggled to accept more than it ever had before.

She suddenly became aware of both
men standing above her, grinning down interestedly, faces either side of Jess�s
look of concentration.

�Half way there.� Jess announced.

Was that a joke ? Toni could
judge length and surely way more than that was already inside her. Or was her
brain scrambled ? She couldn�t think straight.

The relentless, slow penetration
continued to the sultry jazz music.

�Aaaggh
�� she gasped, wincing at a dagger of discomfort. She could feel the end of the
vibrator pushing hard against something inside her.

�Steady now.� Jess chuckled. �Not
much to go.�

�Please �� she heard her own frail
voice somewhere, objecting.

�Look at that boys.� Jess said,
proudly, wiping her forehead. �That�s the full twelve inches inside. What a
fucking tramp.�

�No wonder I prefer her mouth and
arse.� George frowned.

She shrieked as the vibrator buzzed
into life. The shaft started churning and the pinpricks at the base twisted in
a counter direction. Jess pulled it several inches out and then thrust it back
in to the hilt.

Toni wailed.

�Too rough ?� Jess asked. �Okay.
You do it to yourself while we watch.� She reached for Toni�s hand and guided
it down to the handle of the vibrator. �That�s it. You ram it in and out, nice
and deep.�

Instantly it felt better. With
control, she could mix the right blend of pain and pleasure, and within seconds
she was building to a climax.

Her eyes exploded open. �Muh � may � I � ?�

�Certainly not.� Jess snarled.
�Control yourself !�

Toni gasped in frustration and
twisted the vibrator inside her so that it lost contact with her clitoris. She
dragged the pins to increase the pain level and reduce the pleasure, driving
her impending orgasm back.

George was grinning down at her. Hassan was nowhere to be seen.

Jess was unbuckling George�s belt,
dragging his shirt out of his jeans.

Toni stared up at them, mouth
sagging open, realising she was going to be cuckolded here and now by her
boyfriend and his beautiful bitch.

Fuck. Emotional agony on top of
physical pain and sexual stimulation nearly drove her over the abyss again.

Then, suddenly, there was a brown
fist above her face. And a brown cock. And, before she had time to react to
what was happening, ropes of warm, sticky fluid were uncoiling over her face,
into her gasping mouth, cascading onto her cheeks and forehead.

Everybody was laughing. Hassan had dumped his load onto her. George�s cell phone
camera clicked.

The shame was too much.

She would have lost control and
come, regardless, except for Jess slapping her pumping hand away and pulling
the vibrator out in one long, smooth action. There was an obscene, slurping
noise.

�Please �� she begged, helpless, in
a wheezing trance.

She heard the crack, like an echo,
and only later felt the hot pain as a hand smacked her bottom painfully. It
brought her round.

�No way, old lady.� Jess muttered.
�Not yet.�

&nbsp;

*** *** ***

&nbsp;

Even though she tried to shut her
eyes, she couldn�t. The distorted view was too mesmerising and, besides, she
could hear, smell and sense everything. Just two inches above her face, her
boyfriend�s full blooded shaft was pounding in and out of Jess�s gripping,
slippery vagina, as the two of them gasped and grunted in pre-orgasmic ecstasy.

Only ten minutes after Hassan had left, Toni had been tied to the four corners of
her own double bed, face up and spread eagled with her ankles strapped to the
headboard and her wrists fastened to the posts at the bottom of the bed.

Jess was like a dog on all fours
astride Toni�s face and George knelt behind her, both of them ignoring Toni
completely.

For the moment she was just a
sheet on the bed to them.

She studied Jess�s labia as they welcomed
and released, welcomed and released, the heady scent of sweaty sex almost
intoxicating, the slap-slap of flesh on flesh like voodoo drums. Jess�s pubic
hair was soft and blonde, trimmed to a tiny tuft, with a gold stud in her navel
and a �Sweet Bitch� tattoo on her perfect buttocks.

�Yessssssss
�.�

Toni heard Jess hiss and saw her
young, fit muscles tensing up.

George groaned in unison, his
pumping harder but shallower, his penis not wanting to leave its welcoming
home.

�Yes � Yes � Yes � Mmmmmmm ��

�Come � baby, come � fuck aaaaaahhhh ��

They both climaxed in a noisy,
extended, simultaneous orgasm, frozen in their own epic moments, but entwined
in mutual satisfaction.

�Phew !� George exhaled eventually,
easing his erection from her.

�Mmm �
that was gooooooood �� Jess responded.

Toni watched his glistening dick
twitch above her face momentarily, a globule of pearly semen hanging from the
tip by a thread.

George turned and looked down at
her, giving a wink.

�Mmm ��
Jess groaned unhappily, �put it back ��

He laughed. �Horny thing. You�ll
have to wait a bit.�

There was a silence for a few
seconds.

Toni adjusted her eyes to the light
and squinted at the oozing, open gash above her as it was briefly raised up a
few inches.

�Why wait ?� Jess giggled. �I wanna try something new.�

Toni watched as Jess�s right hand
curled down between her legs and fingered open her labia. Then, slowly the
light went dark again.

She had never felt a lesbian urge,
never even the curiosity to try.

But she opened her lips and stuck
out her tongue as Jess lowered her thighs and plonked her messy mound on her
like a rain soaked flower.

�Yes �� Jess hooted above her in
triumph.

She pushed her tongue to meet with
Jess�s ripe clitoris.

�Clean me out you slut.�

Second hand gloop
mixed with female secretions tasted no better to her than first hand semen
straight from the source. But she lapped and guzzled as gravity turned the
trickle into a steady stream.

�Now try this for size.�

Above her, Jess shifted her hips
forwards so that her taut buttocks swivelled and she lowered them onto Toni�s
sopping face. After a few moments, Jess stopped supporting her weight and
allowed her cheeks to envelop Toni�s nose, making her gasp for air.

She felt fingers probing at her own
sore, still frustrated vagina, nails pinching her labial lips, making her
wince.

�Get your tongue right up in there
lady, no slacking.�

She pushed her tongue in as far as
it would go and used it like a ramrod, in-out, in-out, gagging for breath and
trying not to panic.

Please, I can�t take much more
of this, physically or emotionally.

Thankfully, Jess shifted back into
her previous position, clit poised an inch above Toni�s nose, petals smeared
and splayed.

�Make me come � quick.� The order
was urgent, needy.

Some little perverted spark in
Toni�s brain felt better, pleased even, that she had a modicum of control back.
This girl needed her for satisfaction.

It took only seconds, a few,
extended languid licks the full length up to her clit, and Jess let out her
telltale hiss.

�Yessssssss
�.�

Toni completed the job, trying to
ignore her own desire that had now climbed back up to peak level.

�Mmm � nghnghngh ��

Jess seemed to climax with even
more intensity than she had earlier.

Toni felt Jess�s fingers probing
her again and, for one gorgeous moment, thought that maybe her time had come at
last.

But Jess knelt up and peered down
into Toni�s blinking eyes.

�No way, old lady.� Jess chuckled.
�Not yet.�

&nbsp;

*** *** ***

&nbsp;

She was allowed to brush her teeth
and use the toilet.

Jess surveyed her while Toni sat
and urinated, an amused smirk on her face. George had gone downstairs to lock
up and turn the lights out.

�You enjoying this ?�

Yes. But not you, you silly
little bitch.

She shrugged. �It � is quite
intense.�

�Ooo �
quite intense � you use fancy words for a slut, don�t you.�

Toni reached for toilet tissue to
dry herself.

�Leave that alone ! Paper�s too
good for you. And I want you to know that tomorrow is going to get a whole lot
more fucking � intense.�

Toni stood slowly. �Why � do you
dislike me so much ?�

The girl made a face like �duh�,
what a stupid question.

�You ? I don�t give a shit about
you. It�s him I want. Your boyfriend.�

Toni stared in silence.

�Now, let�s get you tucked up for
the night. Follow me.�

They went to the spare room. �Her
room�. There was a single bed with just a mattress; no sheets, blankets or
pillow. The bed was a cheap pine one, with slatted head and footboards.

�Get on there.�

Toni lay cautiously on the bed and
stretched her arms and legs into position as Jess used BDSM �play cuffs�, a
�leg spreader� and a ball of twine to tie her tightly into position.

George appeared in the doorway in
his robe, looking like an Olympic swimmer about to mount the medal podium.

�All done ?�

Jess tugged on each knot and then
stood up.

�In a minute. You go get into bed.�

George disappeared from view and
padded down the corridor.

Jess looked round guiltily.

�Open wide�. She took a roll of
black tape from her bathrobe pocket. Or rather, Toni�s bathrobe, which she was
borrowing.

Nervously, Toni opened her jaws.

Jess sat down by the side of her
head and removed lacy white panties from her other pocket.

�I bought this along just for you.�

Jess flicked the panties open
inside out and revealed a dark pink stain in the front gusset and an almost black
skidmark in the back. Slowly, she balled the cloth
and placed it inside Toni�s mouth, then wedged it down firmly.

Toni couldn�t help but vomit up a
tiny squirt of bile into the cloth, which then burned its way back down her
throat.

Jess quickly sealed a long strip of
the black duct tape over Toni�s lips.

�There we are. That�s better.�

Her blue eyes stared down at Toni
until she quietened. Then, with a savage snarl, she tore another piece of black
tape off the roll and held it poised threateningly over Toni�s nose.

�Fancy breathing tonight ?�

Toni nodded frantically, mewling
helplessly.

Jess grinned at her. �Then here�s
the deal. Tomorrow you put up with whatever he and I care to do to you. Got
that ?�

Toni moved her head up and down in
agreement.

�It won�t be pleasant, I can assure
you.�

Again, Toni indicated she
understood.

�Then when tomorrow evening comes,
you tell him that it was all too much for you and you would like him out of
your life. Forever.�

Fuck you.

�Understood ? Or do I have to
explain.� She lent forward and pinched Toni�s nostrils closed with her fingers.

Slowly, wincing with pain, Toni
nodded, wetness rimming her eyes.

Equally slowly, Jess let go, and
put the tape back in her pocket.

�I�m glad we have an agreement. And
make any mention of this little chat tomorrow and I shall really fuck you up soooo badly.�

&nbsp;

*** *** ***

&nbsp;

Toni knew that being left like she
had been was dangerous. She was cold, uncovered, uncomfortable and
incommunicado.

Breathing with the panties in her
mouth was easy but unnatural. Sleep would be near impossible.

She lay there, in the dark,
wondering how things had suddenly got so out of hand.

She liked games, hard games,
alone with George. Of course she did. And even the idea of involving third
parties, not just as his lovers, but them actually present, had made her hot.
She could even put up with the humiliation of being wanked
over by a stranger if that was what her boyfriend enjoyed putting her through.
But where had this monster come from ? This girl who had uncaringly trampled
through one of Toni�s limits without asking, giving her disgusting stained
knickers to suck on through the night.

She shivered and almost gagged on
the material packed in her mouth.

And yet ? How she wished she
could stroke herself, bring herself off.

She compressed her inner thighs as
far as the leg spreader would allow but felt little. Certainly not enough to
reach an orgasm.

A tiny, nasty germ deep inside
told her she was � yes � enjoying this. If you are going to blow your limits
you may as well do it in style. She had always wanted to experience
humiliation, submission, on a grand scale. This was going to be it. And if she
really had to lose him, then what a way to go ! She could relive this weekend
in her mind as she sat with some future boring accountant husband and watched
the sun set on a Caribbean cruise in her sixties. Fantasy was one thing but few
people lived something as extreme as these next 24 hours seemed likely to be.

&nbsp;

She woke in the dark. She must have
finally drifted off. She�d been dreaming; a rambling nightmare of female
vampires and ghosts in a churchyard and a tombstone with George�s name on it.

There was somebody in the room.
What time was it ?

A hand touched her leg and fumbled
its way up her body.

She could tell it was female. The
bed creaked and she sensed Jess climbing over her body, knees settling in the
gaps by her armpits.

A titter.

�I shouldn�t have drunk so much
wine.�

Without warning, a torrent of hot
rain showered Toni�s face, hair and upper body. She gasped, unable to breath as
it deluged her nostrils, burning back into her mouth through her sinuses. The
shower continued unabated for what seemed like at least a minute.

At last, she felt Jess clambering
back off the bed.

Another titter.

�That�s better.� Footsteps. �Sleep
tight.�

&nbsp;

*** *** ***

&nbsp;

This time it was light when she
woke. The brightness of the sun slicing through the gap in the curtains
suggested it was quite late.

She raised her head off the damp
mattress. Her door was wide open.

She heard a noise, a muffled sound.
Then another. It was unmistakeable. The distinctive reverberations of two
people having uninhibited sex; squeaking springs, groans and moans, occasional
words and rhythm changes.

She lay there and listened. Almost
immediately her own sex started responding to the sounds, her humiliation and
imagination.

By the time Jess sidled up to the
open doorway, Toni was clammy and urgent with need herself. This had gone on
too long.

�Morning. Cat got your tongue ?�

She nodded in an attempt not to
seem rude and thus annoy Jess.

�My, your ex-boyfriend�s got a
lovely, insatiable dick, hasn�t he ?�

She walked over to the bed, opened
the robe and presented her gaping and well battered vagina to Toni.

�Look ! Even more than last night
!�

Jess dipped her index finger in and
scooped out a dollop.

�Mmm ��

She pushed her finger into Toni�s
right nostril, plugging it up.

�I�ve had an idea.�

Toni looked at her, trying to snort
up the semen to clear her nose.

�You�re going to fall for Hassan instead.�

What !

�Yes. Today you�re going to suck
and fuck Hassan and George is going to watch and
think, do I want this raddled old tart as my girlfriend ?�

She giggled at Toni.

�You make it easy for him; a choice
between a beautiful, sexy girl his own age who will be faithful. Or, a has-been
whore who drinks his piss, but is also likely to drink the piss of every other
person who comes calling.�

She put her whole hand under her
middle and grimaced, squeezing her vaginal muscles until her pretty, suntanned
cheeks were puce and a pool of semen filled the palm of her hand.

�Let�s sign our agreement shall we
?�

Her hand smeared the liquid all
over Toni�s neck, face and hair.

&nbsp;

*** *** ***

&nbsp;

Toni was dressed in just a waist
apron, otherwise naked, serving them breakfast at the table; coffee, juice,
croissants, fruit and champagne.

George was showing Jess the
collection of snaps he�d collected on his phone.

�Wow ! I love that one.�

�Yesterday morning.� He replied, as
she held it up to see better.

�You can see in the background.
What a great shot. Look, there, in the toilet, you can see your poo stuck on the sides. Amazing.�

Toni remained silent, refilling
George�s coffee cup.

�Let�s email them to some people.�
Jess enthused.

George laughed. �Er � I don�t think so. This is a game we play, that�s all.
And why jeopardise her life when I live off her ?�

That�s it. Tell the silly cow.

Toni silently topped up Jess�s cup
as well.

But Jess didn�t give up so easily.

�But you don�t have to actually
email them out. Just set things up so you could. One twitch on a key and, kaboom, bye bye to her
respectability. I think you would find that would be a useful bargaining tool
in eradicating any last limits or laziness in your � er
� girlfriend.�

George sipped his coffee. �Mmm � just blackmail, eh ?�

�Look at her.� They both glanced up
at Toni. �Look at that insolent expression. You�ve told me there are things you
want to do to her that are off limits. Well, I say, fuck limits. Use a bit of
blackmail.�

George paused a moment then broke
into a handsome smile.

And yet � behind the gorgeous grin
� she noticed something else. A strange, calculating look in his dark eyes, a
frightening coldness.

�Gotcha.� He said.

&nbsp;

Toni was finishing doing the
washing up when Hassan arrived. Jess let him in and
called her over to take his coffee order; black, three sugars.

When she brought back the coffee,
Jess and Hassan were deep in whispered conversation.

�I�m going back to help George in
his office.� Jess said. �Hassan, you stay here and
keep Toni � company.�

After she had left, Hassan smiled sheepishly at Toni. He looked worse than the
previous night; unshaven, thinning hair awry, wearing a tight black shirt that
exaggerated his paunch.

�I hear we have a deal.�

We do ?

�I think that your friend has ��
Toni replied to him, as pleasantly as she could, �� misunderstood the
parameters of this thing.�

He shook his head from side to
side.

�No. I think it�s you who have
misunderstood the parameters. Miss � Creative Director � at a well known
fashion label !�

She gawped at him. Would they
stoop so low ?

�What d� do you mean ?�

He leered victoriously, sliding his
hand over her naked breast.

�Do what I want and you won�t have
to find out what I mean.�

He looked down ever so slowly so
that she followed his gaze. Then, equally slowly, he unzipped the fly of his
trousers.

�You can have the honour of giving
me my first ever blowjob.�

If I make a run for it where
will I go ? What will I do ?

She sunk down dejectedly onto her
knees and used her fingers to undo his belt, button and zip, and then eased his
trousers over his hips. His white underpants were grubby. She could see his
erection growing, tenting the yellow stained front of his underwear. Slowly,
she tugged them down and his brown penis jerked straight, right in front of her
face.

She had never been with anybody but
white men before. All English and one Scot, before George. His brown penis was
okay in its own right, but a bit thin, and overall meagre compared with her
boyfriend�s totem.

He sat down in a chair, spreading
his legs wide in that casual, male manner. His chubby belly hung down
unattractively.

�Let�s go, teacher.� He said.

She decided to get it over with as
quickly as possible.

She knelt down in as subservient
position as she could bear.

This man was not her Master.

Then she placed her right hand
round his shaft and her lips over his helmet, letting her tongue dance to get
him as hot and ready as she could. Soon she began to pump her hand to and fro.

He moved his fingers through her
fringe so he could see her face.

�Look at me while you do it.�

She turned her eyes to look up at
his jowls and slightly hooded brown eyes.

�You will do this again many times
for me, white lady.�

Oh yeah ! He sounded like some
Sheikh from a white slave porno fantasy. Get real you fucking perve.

He tasted of cloves and garlic. And
that was before he�d come. She dreaded his spunk. Undoubtedly he�d expect her
to swallow it, as all men seemed to.

She smiled enthusiastically,
sliding her tongue along the underside vein, noting with obtuse satisfaction
his shiver of enjoyment.

Come, you arsehole. Get it over
with.

�Enough.� He suddenly announced.
�We will save your throat for another time. Go and lean over that table.�

He wanted to fuck her, the fat
shit.

Briefly, she thought of objecting
because he hadn�t got a condom, but what the hell. Get it over with. Besides,
based on what she�d heard last night, he was a virgin or near as damn it.
Unlikely to be diseased.

She bent over the edge of the table
and gripped the sides.

He clumsily took up position behind
her and fumbled in between her thighs. She didn�t help. Do it yourself
kiddo.

�Don�t you dare orgasm !� he said.
�You are not to enjoy this.�

Too right. No danger of that.

He penetrated her although she
barely felt him, wet, and accustomed as she was to George.

His hands reached round and started
squeezing her boobs crudely.

And it was that that got to her.
The image they made in her mind suddenly flicked a switch and she recognised
the signs. Her cheeks flushed and her nipples hardened to his touch, and an
extra dollop of moisture lubricated her inner walls for him.

No please. Not this. Not even
this !

To complete her humiliation the
door opened and there stood Jess and George watching, wry grins on their faces.

�Don�t let us interrupt.� Her
boyfriend said as she was fucked.

She felt Hassan�s
slobber drooling onto her back as he grunted in manic fashion, hammering out
the final few blows to take him to orgasm.

She screwed her eyes shut in shame
and then his hot fluid was within her and her inner walls felt his flesh
pulsing in a series of squirts.

She grimaced in frustration,
controlling her own impending climax, locking it back in its box, for later
when her true love chose to release it.

�Thank you.� Hassan
said lovingly, nuzzling her neck.

She snatched open her eyes. George
and Jess had already gone.

&nbsp;

*** *** ***

&nbsp;

Toni ate her lunch from a bowl on
the floor. She was starving and it was a helping of cold tinned beans and
sausages with a side order of prunes and cabbages, all pulverised into mush in
the liquidiser.

Jess, George and Hassan watched her eat while they sipped their own
pre-lunch aperitifs of champagne and cassis. Jess snapped several photos with a
small digital camera, some clearly displaying Toni�s face.

�Smile !� Jess said, as the flash
popped.

Then Toni served them their own
lunch of pasta and salad with ice cream and butterscotch to follow, washed down
with red wine.

�Is it true that, in your home
country, men love to screw women in their arses ?� Jess asked Hassan, when Toni was in earshot.

�My home country ! I was born in
South London.� Hassan laughed.

�Okay. Your country of origin then,
although that makes you sound like some manufactured product.�

He paused, then shrugged. �Don�t
men like that anywhere ?�

�Not where I come from !� Jess
replied.

�Toni takes it up the butt, don�t
you doll ?� George said.

Three times ! In my life. To
please you !

�I have done, yes.� She replied,
topping up Jess�s wine glass.

�Why doesn�t she let Hassan try anal as well ?� Jess exclaimed.

There was an awkward silence, two,
three, five seconds.

�Really ?� Hassan
said, looking over at George, not Jess.

George shrugged at both of them, a
strange look in his eyes. �Er � what does she think
?�

�Who gives a shit ? She�s your fucking
slut.� Jess said, draining her glass.

�I will do whatever my Master tells
me to.� Toni interjected.

George smiled up at her. Now his
expression was deeply enigmatic.

�In that case, I would like to see Hassan fuck your arse after lunch.�

Damn, damn, damn !

She bowed her head.

Hassan grinned and raised his glass of sparkling water in a silent toast.

Jess smiled like the cat that got
the cream.

&nbsp;

�Come here�. Jess called out to
her, as Toni finished wiping up.

They were all gathered around her
PC.

She looked at the screen. It was a
porno site. A woman in an obviously amateur shot was mopping a tiled floor in
the nude.

�Click the �back� button.� Jess
said.

Oh my fucking hell.

As she clicked, immediately a photo
of her own face appeared.

It was one from the previous night.
A close up of her face covered in creamy white ejaculate; thick streaks on her
cheeks, forehead and landing in her gasping mouth. She was clearly visible.
Anybody who knew her, seeing this page, would inevitably recognise her.

�Why ?� she said, her face
crumbling into tears, her life ruined.

George smiled kindly. �Shhh ! Don�t panic. It�s just a preview page.�

�For now !� Jess added.

�Wh �
what do I have to doooo ?� she sobbed.

George took her face in his hands
and kissed her.

�That�s the right question. I�m fed
up with limits. Do what you�re told and I have no interest in ruining your
life. Okay ?�

She wiped her eyes, listening,
grabbing hold of hope.

�You remember yesterday�s bathroom
bucket ?�

She nodded, biting her lower lip.

�Go fetch.�

In a daze she walked naked to the
outdoor shed and carried it back. She glanced down. It contained a stinking
mess of soggy toilet tissue and day-old excrement in a pool of fetid brown
water.

Hassan held his nose as she entered the room.

�Oh, wow !� Jess sniggered.

George grinned at her, full of self
confidence.

�Now, tell me how much you don�t
want Jess to click and upload the photos onto the site. It�s not just that
photo by the way. There are ten in total, all of you.�

�I will do � anything you say, for
her not to do that.�

�Then bend over and put your head
down in that bucket.�

Steeling herself, she gripped her
shins and bent down into position.

�Hassan
is now going to fuck your shithole while you breathe
in mine.�

She braced herself. What choice
did she have ?

Slowly she lowered her head into
the confines of the foul plastic bucket, trying to ensure that strands of her
hair didn�t fall into the muck.

She felt hands on her spine, then
fingers in her anal crack, sluicing in a dollop of cold lubricant of some sort.
Her nose filled with stench and her eyes rolled with humiliation but she
managed to stay bent over.

What felt like thumbs roughly hiked
open her greased anus and then a hard but fleshy penis nuzzled into her
sphincter. It was painful, but that was as nothing to the awful, overpowering
shame she felt.

Hands gripped her hips and she felt
the smooth, thin penis glide into her passage. A stranger�s penis that now knew
each of her three orifices.

Please let this be over quickly.

But it was not to be. Hassan took an age. He sampled different angles and speeds,
she heard him discussing things with the others but couldn�t make out the muted
words. He steered her with his left hand while his right mauled her dangling
breasts. Her feet, shins, thighs, hips and bottom ached and throbbed until the
blood had all run to her head.

Eventually, though, he came,
spewing his load inside her.

She stayed down resolutely in
position after he had extracted his cock.

�Up.�

She heard George�s voice and slowly
raised her head from the bucket.

�Question.� He said. �Any more � er � limits in future ?�

Can there be anything else ?
What more can you want of me ?

She stared imploringly into his
eyes. �No limits, Sir.�

His stern expression broke into a
grin. �Right answer, doll.�

Meanwhile Jess, arms folded over
her cleavage, instead of looking victorious or amused, was scowling at her with
a face like thunder.

&nbsp;

*** *** ***

&nbsp;

At around five the doorbell rang.

�Go answer it.� George called out
as if he was expecting somebody.

Toni was still naked. Nevertheless,
obediently, she walked through the hall and cautiously opened the door to the
extent the security chain allowed.

Outside stood five students. Or
what looked like students; three guys and two girls.

�Let�em
in.� George shouted.

Grimacing with extreme
embarrassment, Toni slid the chain back and opened the door.

�Thanks.�

They trooped in, evidently unshocked, but checking out Toni�s naked body. The three
guys, in particular, ogled her boobs and thighs.

And then � a moment that would stay
with her for the remainder of her life.

F U C K.

A third girl appeared from round
the corner, stubbing a cigarette butt under her trendy boots. She stared in
shock straight at Toni.

Her name was Davina
and she was a design student on a work placement at Toni�s office; making
coffee, taking notes, hoping to break into the fashion world. She�d even been
at Friday�s meeting.

It soon became clear that this
extra humiliation had not been part of George�s plans. It was a pure
fluke.

Give credit to the girl. She
took it in her young stride.

�Hi, Toni. You havin�
a good weekend ?�

She walked boldly through the front
door after the others.

�Davina�
please ��

Toni gushed out an explanation, or
at least an attempt at one, while all six students and Jess, Hassan and George stood by and listened.

�She works for you ?� asked George,
incredulous.

�Yes. Sort of.�

George beamed. �How delicious.
Somebody to keep an eye on you at your office !�

�No ! You don�t understand. You
can�t mix business and � this !�

George turned his mouth down with a
Gallic shrug. �Why not ?�

Davina looked at her with interest. �Yeah. Why ?�

Why ????!!!! You stupid, na�ve
kids.

�After all, I�m sure Davina would like a firm job offer.� George said.

�Yeah.� Davina
echoed.

�And a salary raise. A fat one, eh,
Davina ?�

The design student leaned over and
kissed him on the lips. �Right on.�

�You can be trusted with our
little secret can�t you ?�

�Sure.�

�Hold on a minute !� Jess
interrupted indignantly. �I thought the idea was to humiliate this bitch. This
is the perfect opportunity.�

George frowned exaggeratedly, as if
mulling the idea over, looking at each of the students meaningfully, then Hassan, and finally at Toni, with the tiniest of winks.

�Actually, Jess, the idea now is to
humiliate you.� He gestured at the new arrivals. �Meet my � special
friends. And this is the perfect opportunity.�

&nbsp;

*** *** ***

&nbsp;

Jess fought like a tiger, screamed
like a hyena and begged like a dog.

To no avail.

Once they had her gagged and wrists
tied, the young men went to work. And whereas Toni had got some pleasure from
her rape and shame, Jess hated every single moment.

The three male students used her
first; one, two, then � memorably - all three at a time, in a classic
triple-orifice triangle. The spiky haired punk lay back with Jess�s virgin
bottom impaled on his cock, while the one with the ginger goatee fucked her on
top, and the muscled black kid knelt over her face and pumped her slack jawed
mouth.

Afterwards, Hassan
and George took their turns enthusiastically. When George ploughed his well
endowed cock, that she had so recently enjoyed, into her �Sweet Bitch�
arsehole, Jess strangely didn�t seem to like it at all. Finally, the female
students used her in various ways too, while the Goth girl who was a talented
film student, operated the camcorder.

Toni ferried beers and nibbles to
the throng and had never enjoyed herself so much in all her 36 years.

Davina mumbled an aside to her. �Is every weekend like this ?�

Toni made a face. �I promise you ��

�Calm down boss.� Davina said, putting her finger to Toni�s trembling lips.
�Look, if it makes you feel any better, I�ve been into bdsm
since I was seventeen. I�m a bisexual domme and I go
to clubs and munches most weekends myself. Your secret�s safe with me. If mine
is with you.�

They both smiled as George walked
back into the room brandishing the huge, flesh coloured, ridged vibrator that
Toni herself had been humiliated with the evening before.

After two hours of filming, in
order to avoid brutal threats, Jess was made to ride each man again
enthusiastically, smiling at the camera, shriek in several convincing orgasms
with different partners, drink several vodka shots, shoot up a few drugs, and
generally show herself to be a delighted and willing participant in the entire
drunken orgy.

All on camera.

Once it was edited and everybody�s
but Jess�s face had been cut or blurred, it would prove an extremely powerful
blackmail weapon, especially in the hands of Hassan,
who was not going to let such a wonderful opportunity for a white slave pass
him by.

Sometime, just before everybody
left, George caught Toni�s eye and smiled. She went over to him.

And he kissed her gently,
passionately.

�I think it�s finally time that
clit of yours got a little action, isn�t it ?�

She melted into his chest, her
heart pounding.

�And I think it�s time I told you
voluntarily that there will no longer be any limits. From this moment,
anything, and I mean anything, is up to you.�

&nbsp;

*** *** ***

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

On Monday morning, Toni was back in
a meeting with her design team. The five women and single man around the table
were munching on croissants and sipping hot cappuccinos.

�Where is she ?� mumbled
Trish, Toni�s deputy. The redheaded Scot was known as Dragon behind her back; a
heart of gold well hidden by an impatient, intolerant, professional exterior.

�Davina�s
never normally late.�

�Her cell phone�s not answering.�

Toni bounced her pad on the table
to signify she was ready.

�I suspect Davina
isn�t coming. Or ��, Toni smiled, �maybe she is.�

In my bed, no doubt.

�What ? Well is she or isn�t she ?�
Trish blurted.

�Tell you what Trish.� Toni said,
pushing the notepad in her direction. �You take notes until Davina
arrives. Okay ?�

&nbsp;

At noon, showered and gorgeous, Davina pranced into the room.

�Sorry I�m late. Something came
up.�

�Huh.� Trish frowned. �That ��

That black cashmere sweater is
exactly like �

Toni interrupted. �Trish.
Everybody. I�ve been thinking over the weekend. Davina�s
been with us five months now and she�s done a very good job. I�ve decided to
invite her to join the team properly.�

There were gob smacked expressions
all round.

Davina beamed. �Thank you, Toni. You won�t regret it, I promise you.�

&nbsp;

On Tuesday morning, the creative
team was gathered again, this time with the production department to sort out
the next season�s delivery schedule.

�Where is she ?� Trish
stared dramatically at her watch. �Late again.�

�I tried her cell. It�s switched
off.�

At that moment Toni�s phone hummed.
Her personal one, not her Blackberry.

Around her, faces stared
expectantly, waiting, watching.

She smiled at them coolly until her
phone ceased.

�Davina�s
moving into a new place, now that�s she�s got a full time job. So let�s start
the meeting without her.�

The meeting proceeded smoothly and
it took forty five minutes.

Later, in the privacy of her own
office, Toni flipped open her phone and looked at the little square screen.
There was a simple text message of seven digits:

&nbsp;

! ! ! x x x

G

&nbsp;

Suddenly Trish stood in the
doorway, smiling drily.

�That man of yours is always texting you, isn�t he ?�

Toni shrugged. �Not so often, why
?�

�I mean, whenever your American
friend says jump, you just seem to ask how high, right ?�

Toni made a face. �It�s more
complicated than that.�

�Sure.� Trish chuckled. �It�s nice
to see. You two must have a very special relationship.�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

*** THE END ***

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Already posted by the same
author:

&nbsp;

�Son of a Gun� � a tale set
in both the mid 19th century and the present day recounting the fate
of two young ladies stranded on a desert island and suggesting what might have
been the outcome of their ravishment several generations later (some
non-consensual scenes and moderate bdsm but not
an excessively heavy story � please note that none of my writings ever contain
snuff, gore or any material characters under 21).

&nbsp;

�The Ballad of Lara and Gemma� � a spin-off tale from my earlier novel �After the
Pestilence� (see below). It is set in the near future and describes the
relationship between a lesbian/bi domme and her
infatuation with an unwilling female slave (all non-consensual scenes and
extreme humiliation including scat).

&nbsp;

�Amuse-Bouches�
� this is written in English, not French ! Amuse-Bouches
are nibbles that fancy restaurants serve to �amuse the mouth� before the main
meal. I posted a selection of three dominant-POV short stories, rising in
severity from consensual to mind control to non-consensual (the first two
contain moderate bdsm, whilst the third is quite
heavy and may not be to everybody�s taste).

&nbsp;

�Hors d�Oeuvres�
� also written in English, not French ! A selection of three consensual,
male-submissive short stories, or rather opening chapters of novels I never
finished (without a doubt the mildest posting I have made so far and so it may
not be to everybody�s taste, especially dominant guys !)

&nbsp;

�After the Pestilence� � a
long (70,000 words) novel that took over a year to write, set in the near
future, involving numerous characters and containing, as one reviewer said,
�something for everyone� (most of it is non-consensual and the humiliation is
extreme, although the actual violence is mainly moderate). A shorter sequel
�Beyond the Pestilence� is a work in progress that I hope to post one day.
