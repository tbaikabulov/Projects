Synopsis: Danny is taken prisoner right in his own home












The door slammed shut behind him and he winced, having not intended to slam it so hard. The house was silent and no lights had been left on. Something he found unusual, since Carrie always left at least one on when she knew he was working late. He dropped his bag by the door, set the keys in the ashtray and shrugged out of his coat. He did this all without turning on a light.
�����Dropping his coat across his bag, he turned and looked around. Nothing looked out of place, but something nagged at the back of his mind. Something was wrong. It was not like Carrie to break routine like that. He went from room to room, still in darkness. The doors were locked, windows bolted from the inside. 
�����He found a half eaten sandwich and a glass of flat coke in the kitchen. There was a folded piece of paper next to it. Frowning, he picked it up and pulled open the fridge door for a little light. Blinking, his eyes adjusted and read the note. Carrie's mom was ill. She'd come home at lunch time for a change of clothes. She had to take her mother to hospital and would probably stay there for the weekend. That would explain why there were no lights on.
�����He shut the fridge again and let his eyes adjust to the darkness, absently sipping the coke. He still did not turn on any lights. He could see well enough from the glow of the street lights outside. The darkness was calm and relaxing. To walk around in darkness like this was not an opportunity he got often.
�����Taking a bite of the sandwich, he headed for the bathroom, unbuttoning his shirt as he went. He turned on the shower, adjusting the taps before undressing, dropping his laundry in the basket. He smiled to himself as he imagined Carrie berating him, had he not done it.
�����Testing the temperature of the water, he stepped under the spray and shut the shower door. It was hot. He let the water pound at tensed muscles for several moments, before turning and lowering the temperature. He began to wash and yawned, the need to sleep creeping over him as his body relaxed. He quickly washed his hair, turned off the shower and stepped on to the mat. He yawned again as he reached for a towel and then decided against it, heading for the bedroom naked. So tired, he barely felt it as his knee bumped the edge of the bed. He tumbled forward, shoulder hitting the mattress first as he rolled on to the bed. He was asleep within moments.
Tasha emerged from her hiding place in a room down the hall. Eyes well-adjusted to the darkness of the house, she strode confidently down the hallway and entered the bedroom. She smiled as she saw Danny's naked form asleep on the bed. It had been touch and go for a moment as his sixth sense nagged. She really thought he would conduct a more thorough search of the house and find her. Then she would have been forced to use more extreme methods.
But in the end, all had gone according to plan. Danny was asleep on the bed, blissfully unaware of what was going to happen next.
�����Touching the light switch, she made the room a fraction brighter, so that she could see a little more than just vague shapes. She approached quietly, set her bag down next to the bed and surveyed the scene. 
�����It was a large room, window covered by heavy drapes opposite the door. To the left, the wall was obscured by built-in cupboards from floor to ceiling. The bed was the centerpiece of the room. A king-sized bed, with a post at each corner, reaching almost to the ceiling. Each post was joined at the top by another, over which sheets of lacy fabric were thrown. Two curtains hung from each post and these were still tied back, so that one could see the bed. Tasha stepped closer. She knew that both the headboard and the board across the foot of the bed had intricate carvings on them, depicting the Big Five of Africa. On either side of the bed, also in a dark wood, were two bedside cabinets, as well as a chair, also matching.
�����Danny was lying sprawled across the bed, one foot hanging off the side. Carefully, she untucked the blankets and moved to the other side of the bed. With gentle tugs, she pulled him into the middle of the bed and into a better position. Returning to her bag, Tasha pulled out several lengths of rope. She tied one to each post before pausing to ensure that he was still sleeping deeply. She pulled his ankles apart, towards the edges of the bed. Wrapping the rope twice around each ankle. Tasha knotted the ropes securely before cautiously pulling on the ropes to ensure they did not come loose. Shifting his upper torso slightly, she did the same to his wrists. 
�����Sitting on the edge of the bed she watched him sleeping for a moment, arms and legs outstretched and bound. He moaned softly and tried to shift position. He did not wake. She stroked the inside of his thigh, almost affectionately before bending over to dig in her bag again. She lifted out a ball gag and blindfold, putting them on the edge of the bed. Next she lifted out a cock ring. Turning around a little further, she ran her hand up his leg again, brushing over his balls and flaccid cock. Gently taking it in her hand, she closed her fingers around it and stroked him. It did not take long before he started to respond to her touch. A smile tugged at her lips as she rolled the ring down over his growing member. She continued to massage him, until his cock had grown to its full length, bulging slightly around the ring.
�����Tasha got off the bed and quietly began to undress, carefully folding her clothes and placing them neatly upon a chair. She could see him becoming a little restless as he slept, but it would still be a while before he awoke. She stood and stared at him as he slept, her mind drifting a little as her hands caressed her slim body. Her hand brushed over her shaven pussy and she realized how wet she was, anticipating what she knew was to come.
�����She sat down again, one hand automatically seeking her moist womanhood, while the other caressed her captive cock. She moaned as a warmth spread through her body. Her thumb found her clit as two fingers stroked deep inside her. She could feel her desire building as she stroked a little faster. Tasha wanted to feel him inside her. Her mind could see her on top of him, slowly riding his stiff member. Feeling him writhe beneath her as he moans. She slipped a third finger into her wet pussy and gasped and shuddered as her thumb found a sensitive spot. She rubbed the area faster as she felt the orgasm building within her. She moaned and shuddered, her hand slipping from his cock to caress his balls. Again, her mind drifted, seeing him writhing on the bed, desperate moans escaping the gag. He was in pain. Her mind did not care what type of pain, so long as she could hear his cries. It was his pain that got her off. 
�����A pained moan broke her reverie. Danny was pulling against his restraints. Tasha watched him for a moment as she continued to roughly play with his balls. Her fingers began to stroke even faster as she felt her orgasm build to new heights. Her hand moved suddenly to clench the sheet instead. She mewled softly, trying to bite back the cries as her orgasm hit. Her body bucked, nearly throwing her over as she rode it out, her thumb slowing and finally stopping its caresses.
�����Tasha took a few deep breaths as she came down from her orgasm. It had been awesome, but she knew that she had more spectacular ones to come. Her body was soaked in a fine sheen of sweat and she could feel the moisture seeping from her pussy. Unsurprisingly, Danny still slept. She went to the bathroom, briefly, also without turning on any lights, and wiped herself down with a damp cloth. When she returned to the bedroom, she saw that Danny was finally beginning to stir and smiled to herself.
�����She climbed on the bed and leaned over him, knees on either side of his hips, hands by his head. Bending over, she kissed him gently before picking up the blindfold. It was one of those they gave you for long flights, to cover your eyes while you slept. She gently eased the elastic over his hair and placed the blindfold over his eyes. Danny moaned and turned his head as Tasha reached for the ball gag. She kissed him full on the lips, pushing her tongue gently between his teeth and exploring his mouth. Slowly he began to respond, his mind not yet awake enough to comprehend his situation. 
�����She eased her body closer to his, feeling his cock pressing against her. Shifting a little, she felt him enter her. Tasha paused, with just the tip inside her, savoring the feeling she had been waiting for. She kissed him again, more demanding this time before pulling away suddenly and shoving the ball gag into his open mouth. She secured it before caressing his cheek. Propping herself up again, she stared down at him again. Little by little, she eased herself backwards, pushing him deeper.
Danny slowly came round from his deep sleep. He could feel someone slowly riding him. It felt so good. He began lifting his hips off the bed, in time with her movements. He wanted to hold her, caress and squeeze her naked breasts. Something was wrong with this picture. He could not move. Suddenly the thought of sex lost its appeal as the severity of his situation dawned upon him.
�����Restrained. Gagged. Blindfolded. This could not be happening. A dream. Please let it be a dream. Pain seared through his chest. She was pinching his nipples. Not a dream. Very real. 
�����Danny cried out, though very little escaped the gag. He bucked, fighting against the restraints. Fear tightened his chest. He felt her vaginal muscles squeezing his cock deep inside her. He tugged against the ropes again. He tried to shout at her, but the gag muffled almost all sound. Pain stabbed through his right armpit and Danny bucked again. She began pinching him over and over, cruelly abusing his nipples, armpits and any other sensitive area she could find. Danny screamed into the gag, tears stinging his eyes behind the blindfold as he desperately fought to escape.
Tasha cried out as the orgasm hit. Her body arched, nails digging into Danny's shoulders as she rode it out. Her vaginal muscles tightened round his cock as wave after wave of pleasure washed over her. She felt a small flood of juice seep down around his cock. She slowed and finally stopped, his cock twitching inside her.
�����Danny lay rigid beneath her, the initial fear having passed, though she could still see his nostrils flaring with each desperate breath. Some small part of his mind was trying to escape. He was still testing his bonds, wrists tugging and twisting against the ropes. 
�����Tasha caressed his damp chest, fingers tracing the faint lines between his abs. Bending over, she gently kissed and sucked his abused nipples, hands stroking his shoulders. Danny remained tense beneath her as she slowly began to ride his aching cock again. She planted soft kisses all the way up his neck before licking and nibbling his left earlobe. Her hands massaged his shoulders as she kissed his cheeks, chin and chest some more. She could feel him relaxing beneath her, lulled into a false sense of security.
�����She picked up the pace as she felt her third orgasm swiftly building. Her kisses and caresses became more demanding. Despite his situation, Danny once again began to respond, hips lifting from the bed. His cock hurt, but he wanted to orgasm so badly. He moaned in frustration as the ropes prevented him from touching her. Tasha ran her hands up over his chest again before her fingers closed around his throat. She did not squeeze, but his tensing was enough to send her over the edge in a third, powerful orgasm.
�����Danny was helpless to stop her. Her hands tightened round his throat as she rode out her orgasm. She could snuff out his life any time she wanted and there was nothing he could do. She had the power to decide whether he lived or died and that gave her a rush like nothing else could.
�����Tasha finally got off her prisoner a couple minutes later. He was once again testing his bonds, almost desperately. Tasha stood watching him from beside the bed before heading to the bathroom again. Stepping into the shower, she was careful not to get her hair too wet while she washed herself clean. Stepping out again, she toweled herself dry. She picked up a face cloth and soaked it in cold water. Squeezing out some of the excess water, she headed back to the bedroom.
�����Danny was lying quietly on the bed. He had not heard her return and flinched as she sat down on the bed again. His fingers were curled round the ropes restraining him and his grip tightened visibly. Holding the cloth in one hand, she stroked his thigh with the other. 
�����His nostrils flared as he fought to control his fear. He held on tightly to the ropes, a part of his mind strangely believing that if he pulled hard enough, he might actually break them. He could feel her stroking his thigh and was unable to pull away from her touch. Her hand moved to gently stroke his balls and still erect cock. If he could tense up any further, he would have.
�����Tasha suddenly dropped the cold cloth over his genitals. Danny bucked and moaned, wanting to double over. Tasha wrapped the cloth around his cock, holding it there until she felt his cock soften enough for her to remove the cock ring. 
�����Danny suddenly understood why he had not been able to orgasm yet. He felt her tongue licking his balls, gently kissing them. Her mouth moved up over his cock, licking and kissing, until she reached the head. Ever so softly, she sucked him into her mouth, her teeth lightly caressing his sensitive member. Danny moaned, tensed muscles relaxing as his cock swelled to fill her mouth. He felt the head slip down the back of her throat as her tongue licked and stroked him. An orgasm was swiftly building and he moaned softly to voice his pleasure.
�����Suddenly, his stiff member slapped against his stomach. The bed shifted as Tasha got up. Danny cried out in frustration. He was so close! His hips thrust at empty air to get his message across. He heard the door click shut. He was alone, so close to an orgasm but unable to do anything about it. His balls ached with the need to release their load.
He tried to pretend that he was still sleeping, but he knew that she knew that he was awake. The involuntary flinch as she touched his thigh had given him away. She was gently stroking his cock again. "I'm not going to hurt you," she said. This was the first time she had spoken. She sounded as if she cared and was being truthful, but Danny did not believe a word of it. 
�����Semi-erect, she released his cock to take his balls gently in her hand. They were swollen and hurt. Danny tried not to let his discomfort show. For several minutes, she rolled his balls between her fingers. Tasha's hand closed around her prize and turned her attention to her prisoner. He was tense again. His fingers curled and gripped the ropes that bound his wrists. Such a small piece of the male anatomy could cause so much pain. It did not matter how many times she did it, having a man at her mercy never ceased to turn Tasha on.
�����Tasha's hand closed around his trapped testicles. Even this light squeezing to his swollen orbs caused intense pain. Her lips parted and her breath caught in her throat as he began to squirm against his restraints. Her free hand slipped without thought to her hot womanhood and began to stroke her clit. The grip on his balls tightened further, causing Danny's tensed body to arch against the bed. Muffled cries escaped his gag, exciting Tasha further. She could only imagine the pain that he was going through. Waves of agony radiated from his trapped manhood, making him want to double over and protect them from further pain. 
�����As her grip tightened even further, his mind fought desperately to hold back the urge to vomit, knowing that if he did so, he might choke because of the gag. His grip on the rope was so tight that his knuckles were white. His heels scraped uselessly at the sheets. He could smell her arousal and was vaguely aware of her moans. He realized that she was fingering herself to an orgasm. Moments later, her climax hit and fresh waves of pain washed over him. Tears stung his eyes as he fought to remain conscious.
�����Relief, when it finally came, was a small mercy. He knew she could start again at any moment and take extreme pleasure from the torture. In fact, her hand did not move far from his testicles as she took several deep breaths.
�����"So I lied," she said, "but I will promise that you will come through with your manhood intact." Tasha got up and went to the end cupboard, where she had stashed an extra bag of equipment several days before. It had been a calculated risk, but knew that they did not check in there often. She let the large kitbag drop heavily on the side of the bed. Danny flinched again. Looking at him, she asked, "I bet you're wondering why this is happening, aren't you?" She waited for him to nod before continuing. "Sometimes, I don't know myself," she said. "All I know for sure is that I enjoy seeing a man in pain. It gives me such a rush to see someone helpless and at my mercy." She paused. "But you knew that already."
�����Tasha lifted a tripod out of the bag and set it up next to the bed. "There are other reasons as well. Obviously there are. We're all driven by money and greed, aren't we?" She lifted a video camera out the bag and began setting it up upon the tripod. "You have become one of my chosen blackmail targets. You are a young and successful district attorney. Who knows what the future holds for you." She turned the camera on and adjusted some settings. "Maybe you'll be a senator, or even a president one day. What a shame if someone had to leak some pictures to the press of you fucking someone other than your wife? In your own bedroom!"
�����She moved the bag to the floor and sat down on the bed. She leaned over and removed Danny's blindfold. He blinked several times. The first thing he noticed was that she was wearing his wife's bath robe. Tasha saw him looking and smiled. "Looks good on me, don't you think?" He did not respond, taking in her shoulder-length brown hair and hazel green eyes. She calmly allowed him to look for several moments, before saying, "You can look as much as you like. You won't go to the police. Not ever. Because the photos I am about to take will find your wife, your boss and all the local newspapers. Your career will be over before it even began."
�����As Tasha got up, the robe fell open and Danny caught a glimpse of her small breasts and erect nipples as she circled the bed to fetch the cock ring. Crawling on to the bed, she grinned, knowing the view she was giving him would turn him on. The robe slipped from her shoulders as she knelt between his legs. She bent over, taking his cock in her mouth. She sucked on it briefly and released it, a hand curling round its length and stroking him while she licked the base and his tender balls. It took a little longer, but the result was the same - an erection trapped within the confines of the ring.
�����She looked up and smiled. Shifting her weight forward, she let her breasts slide over his erection and kissed his chest. Moving upwards, she kissed his nipples and throat, her damp pussy rubbing against his manhood. It was just a couple of centimeters and he would be inside of her. She rubbed herself against him several times and moaned, feeling her desire grow. 
�����Tasha had to force herself back to the present, though and took a deep breath. Moving to one side, she pulled the bag closer and reached into the side pouch for a bottle of pills. Sitting up, she took a single pill out and placed the bottle beside the bed. She held it between finger and thumb for Danny to see. It was small and could have easily been mistaken for several other medications on the market.
�����"You won't find these at any pharmacy," she said. "They just like Viagra, but due to some dangerous side effects, the FDA never approved them." She had a wicked smile on her face. "Luckily, I found someone who was able to give me a few." She bent over him and unfastened the gag. Tossing it to the floor, she allowed him a moment to flex his jaw muscles. She dropped the pill into his mouth during a lapse of concentration and covered his nose and mouth with her hand. She stroked his throat with his other hand until he swallowed it. Leaning over, she began kissing him, planting soft kisses on his neck, cheeks and lips.
�����Despite all that had already happened, Danny again found himself responding to her gentle caresses, reaching forward to kiss her back, groaning as she stayed just out of reach. Tasha rubbed her hips against his, leaning close to kiss and nibble is ear. Danny responded in kind, kissing her neck and pulling against his restraints, wanting to caress her.
�����Tasha pulled away suddenly. This was moving a little too quickly. Not ready yet. The drug needed time to work. Giving it to him on an empty stomach did speed it up somewhat, but the drug still needed time to take effect. Planting a last kiss on his navel, Tasha stood up. Danny tugged at the ropes, trying to ask her to come back, but his dry throat failed to co-operate. She knew what he wanted to say. "Soon, handsome," she said as she shut the door.
