&nbsp;

Amy sobbed into the gag as her
husband rocked into her again. Her body throbbed from sexual tension, but more
from the tight cuffs at her wrists and ankles. She could still taste the woman
he�d given her to, the musky scent covering her face, forced into her nostrils
and mouth. 

She�d promised to be and do
whatever he said but this had never even been a remote possibility. What had
she agreed to? She gasped as his movements became more violent. She could see
the deep concentration on his face above her as took her virginity.

&nbsp;

The best man at their wedding Misha, had offered to show her the way to the honeymoon
suite when Keane had been caught by an older relative. Keane had motioned her
to go with a beautiful smile. He�d stroked her arm and then turned away. 

�Who was that Misha?� she asked as
they entered the elevator. 

�Keane�s great uncle on his
father�s side.� The man spoke tersely as he had every time they�d spoke. 

�Is something wrong?� She could see
he was surprised she was so blunt.

Misha shook his head, �No,� he
turned back away full of anger.

�I love him Misha, I won�t hurt
him.�

The dark angry laugh surprised her,
�No, Amy, I�m sure you won�t.� He took her arm in his and shook his head. �I�m
sure you won�t.� 

Amy didn�t struggle against him as
he led her to the door. He turned and looked down at her for a moment then
spoke sincerely. �It�s not too late, if you turned and walked away I�d let you
go.� 

Amy smiled up at him, �Silly, I�m
not afraid of Keane. I love him.�

Misha nodded and opened the door
letting her walk in first. �Oh,� she said suddenly looking behind her. �Umm,
he�s supposed to��

Misha moved quickly and lifted her
into his arms and carried her across the threshold. 

The squeal didn�t surprise him, �Um
Misha, you��

�But I did.�

�You can put me down now.� 

Amy was looking up at him a little
alarmed. �Why Amy, I�m here to put you to bed.� Her face was more than slightly
alarmed now. �I�m blood bonded to Keane, he�s my master. Tonight you�ll be
blood bonded and you�ll be just as much his.� She squirmed in his arms. She was
just a little bit of nothing. She could struggle for a week and not do more
than arouse him but Keane realized that. �Now stop that Amy. Did you promise
him to do all that he asked?� 

Amy stopped suddenly and met his
eyes. �Yes,� she whispered. Good she wasn�t stupid just uninformed. �He left
you a note.� 

She watched as he turned and saw
the dozen red roses on the table just inside the opulent suite. He nodded and
she reached out and took the little card lifting it. �Amy trust
me, do exactly as Misha says. You promised. Your loving
husband Keane.� It was his writing she glanced back up then down at the
card. 

�Ok,� she whispered. 

Misha felt a tug in his heart,
Keane, had won again. Even this delicate little female could feel the power in
him. 

Amy squealed as Misha swung her up,
then gently set her on her feet. �First we need to get
you washed. I want you to walk to the rug and wait for me. Face the mirror.

�She looked up and saw herself framed in the
ornate full length mirror before her. �See how pretty, how fresh and innocent.�
She glanced toward him, �No, look at yourself. Remember your old life, because
it is gone now. You are now Mrs. Keane Von Serias,
little Amy is gone, she�s your past.� She felt his hands on her back and
flinched. The gentle caress made her want to turn but she kept her gaze on
herself. She couldn�t even see him in the mirror the room was dark. A tight
overhead spotlight illuminated her. 

Amy felt the tightly tied corset
bodice loosening, she�d argued with the dresser this morning who�d insisted it
be cinched tightly. She sucked in a gasp as she realized Keane had instructed
the woman. She tried to see Misha�s eyes in the mirror but he was just an
indistinct figure. She met her own eyes again. Who was this man she�d married? 

The dress falling away broke her
from her trance. �Lift your right leg,� Misha�s hand dropped under hers
supporting her. �Now your left.� He pulled the dress away, she lifted her free hand to cover herself. �No.� 

The white lace slip barely
concealed anything, her nipples pressed against the gossamer material. The
garters holding up the white fishnet stockings peaked out under the hem. She
felt her face flush. She felt the slip shift across her nipples and realized her
entire body tingled. It frightened her. 

Misha walked into the light behind
her, his hands lightly touched her shoulders. �Do you see Amy the young woman,
the budding business woman, the virgin?� His voice was mesmerizing. She nodded
not even resisting as his hands skimmed her arms, moving her shielding hands to
her side. �She�s gone, she gave up her life to be Mrs.
Keane Von Serias.� She gasped as he reached in front
of her and the lace ripped from her. Her bare breasts jiggled, she tried to
lift her hands but he held them in his lace filled hands. �No, don�t hide her.
Keane would be displeased, never hide his body from our gaze.� 

Amy felt her eyes flutter as she
looked between her gaze and his. �You��

�No, shhh,
it�s time to learn. Soon your husband will join you and you will learn what it
means to surrender your will to him.� Slowly he shifted against her pressing
her arms in with his as he reached around her again, holding her in a light
embrace for a moment. He back away then walked around her leaving the lace to
fall behind her. Amy swallowed as he knelt before her and reached out freeing
the stockings from her garters. His hands were warm and gentle on her flesh.
�Look in the mirror Amy.� His voice was gentle but firm. She saw him rolling
the stocking down. She heard her breath coming in panting gasps until she stood
completely nude before the kneeling man. �Look at her Amy. She�s never to be
hidden before her husband or his orders. 

&nbsp;

The water in the shower would have
been soothing if his hands hadn�t accompanied it. She found it difficult to
keep her eyes open and her gaze on her face in the mirrored room. She hadn�t
stopped trembling since she�d stepped in, and placed her hands on the bar
suspended above the shower. The water trickled down from her neck avoiding her
hair pinned up lightly. She heard the movement and realized Misha was following
her in, and he was nude. �You�I�ca�� 

�Shhh,
you must be washed for your night of revelation.� He reached out taking the
soap in his big hands she couldn�t stop looking at him. �Are you looking at
Amy?� He asked with a chuckle behind his words. She didn�t answer but her eyes
pulled up to meet her wide eyed innocent gaze. He hoped she wasn�t going to
faint. �Take a deep breath and I�ll wash you.� 

His hands moved to her shoulders,
caressing, soaping, he didn�t spare her. She wiggled on her toes as his hands
soaped her armpits. �No,� she said clearly as he lifted a razor to the almost
smooth flesh. 

�Yes, Amy, I�m preparing you for
your husband, on your husband�s orders. Open your eyes back up and watch.
Keane�s pleasure is always upper most in our minds. He wants you smooth and
fresh.� Misha was glad the lightly drugged wine wasn�t wearing off yet, she was
so skittish, but weren�t most virgins on their wedding night? He hoped Keane
was enjoying the live video feed. 

She struggled as he soaped her
breasts bringing her large firm nipples to rock hard peaks. He held her firmly
against his body and smiled she still held the bar above her head. She hadn�t
even thought of disobeying. Keane would be enjoying this. He soaped her stomach
letting his finger thrust in and out of her navel as she wiggled more making
him ready to burst. He didn�t dare rock against her, not if Keane was watching.
He soaped her mound and she lifted high on her toes her squeal was loud.

�Shhh,
you have to be clean, lift your right leg to the seat,� he helped her comply
and stroked long between her legs.

�No,� she gasped loudly.

�Yes,� he spoke firmly, �I�m going
to shave you, you�re going to be very still.� She
trembled in his arms violently. He hid his smile behind her head. He was going
to enjoy his master having a wife.

&nbsp;

Amy�s legs wouldn�t support her as
she tried to walk from the shower. Misha wrapped her into the large warm towel
and set her on the padded bench in the middle of the warm room. Again she was
set in front of a mirror, again he chided her to see
herself as new, different. The intensity was frightening. He brushed her hair
till it sparkled against her skin. He lifted her slowly and walked her out of
the warm room her naked body responded to the cool air. She looked down, her nipples were tight and large, protruding as if
Misha�s fingers had rolled them again. She felt a blush over whelming her as
they stopped at the bed. 

�Crawl up and lay on your back.�
She looked at the bed the covers turned down invitingly, then
she saw the set of cuffs on the pillow.

�No,� she tried to run but Misha
swept her up and firmly laid her on the bed. He held her with his nude body,
slowly lifting her hands. 

�He is our master Amy, submit and
love him and your life will be full of passion. You promised.� Her body reacted
as if he had slapped her and he quickly cuffed her delicate wrists tightly. He
turned before she could recover her determination and lay across her legs. The
cuffs were barely locked when she realized what was happening and began to
fight again. He rolled over and chuckled. �It�s too late now Amy.� He walked to
the end of the bed and began to pull. Her squeal sent a wave of desire through
his body. He tightened her till she could barely wiggle and then stood and
looked down at her. �Our master will be very pleased Amy. Only one adornment,�
he walked around the bed and opened the bedside table. She watched as he lifted
a black leather piece. Misha turned it, she still didn�t understand till he
slowly lowered it over her face. The gag was horrid, she screamed but it
allowed only a light mewing sound. Misha smiled the sound itself was enough to
cause a severe tightening in his balls. �Enjoy your wedding night Amy. I�ll see
you later.� 

&nbsp;

Amy felt her husband tensing his
eyes shut and he moaned her name as he filled her with his seed. He dropped on
her body and smiled against her hair. �Yes you�re wonderful.�

�

Chapter

&nbsp;

The hair dryer started in the bathroom,
a door opened to the side. Keane smiled as he rolled over and looked at Misha
standing next to the bed setting a tray down on the bedside table. He took a
handkerchief and looked at him. �She was a virgin, record it.� Keane enjoyed
watching as Misha used the handkerchief to collect the blood from between her
legs. Reverently Misha folded it and set it in a box. 

Keane lifted his arms and folded
them behind his bed watching as Misha lifted a warm washcloth. He met his eyes
and Keane nodded once. Misha gently and reverently cleansed him, �I hope she�s
pregnant Misha.� 

�Yes master.� 

�I�m not done with her, escort
Michelle out. Make sure she gets a picture of her naughty behavior. I want her
available if I choose.�

�Yes master.� 

Keane turned onto his side and
looked into the scared eyes of his young wife. �I watched Amy, before, you did
well. All of it was recorded, you and Misha, and you and Michelle. Did you
enjoy her attention?� He chuckled as she shook her head once then hesitated. �I
won�t punish you for being honest Amy.� 

She shook her head then nodded
once. He chuckled, �I�ll explore that answer later.� His hand shifted down her
body slowly then back up. �Your skin is so soft.� His fingers ran over her
touching, caressing, tickling, fondling till she couldn�t help but wither under
them. �Are you hungry for me Amy?� he leaned over her meeting her eyes. She
nodded her head twice never dropping her eyes. He could see the fear still but
the longing was clear. �Did you know my needs will always be more important to
you than your own?� She didn�t know what to do. 

He rolled her nipple between his
fingers and she mewed behind the nasty gag. He pulled on her flesh and then let
it fall away. She had very little play in the tight bondage. His fingers walked
down her body to her damp crotch. He stroked her lightly running his fingers up
and down repeatedly till she was mewing wildly behind the gag. �Beg me Amy. Beg
me to fuck you again.� She made undistinguishable noises behind the gag. �Beg
me Amy.� He twisted his wrist and slapped hard between her dripping legs. �Beg
for more.� The mewing rose an octave but continued.
�Do you love me Amy, do you love your husband?� She
wildly nodded her head. �Will you offer me your life again,
give me anything I want willingly?� Her head continued it�s bobbing. He
leaned forward and kissed her forehead again. �Wonderful.� 

Keane lifted his fingers and
snapped them, he�d seen Misha escort the woman out
earlier and knew he�d be waiting. �Free her legs Misha.� He leaned back over
Amy and smiled. �No fighting, do just as you�re told.� She bobbed her head
again and tried to glance around him. �No, Misha is invisible to you when
you�re with me. I�m your husband your master, your life, your breath.� He
reached up and pinched her nose. 

He smiled as she squirmed, she
finally nodded her head and he let her go. �Wonderful, you�re bright. Do you
love me Amy?� she nodded violently and he chuckled.

�I�m done master.� Misha said
waiting for instructions. 

�A lubricant Misha, I�m going to delve
into my wives dark secret place.�

�Yes master.�

Keane felt her tremble under his
hand. �Do you understand Amy? I�m going to place my body inside your entrance
of Sodom. It will hurt because
you�re so small and tight. You will most likely bleed just as you did when I
broke through your maidenhead. Do you willingly offer me your body Amy, to do
with as I please?� 

The fear in her eyes was
intoxicating but she nodded her head clearly aware he could make her agree.
�Misha prepare her,� he didn�t move his gaze from her. He didn�t need to, he knew Misha would do exactly what he asked quickly and
proficiently. She squirmed as he fondled her nipples. He could hear both their
breathing quicken. Misha desired her it was clear. 

�Master, she�s ready.� 

�Stay and watch Misha,
sit at her head and hold her ankles, so she can relax,� he chuckled. Keane
shifted away and knelt high above her for a moment looking down at her body. He
crawled between her spread legs and lifted slowly letting her control her
breathing. He pressed her feet toward her head. Misha took her ankles in his
hand and held them finishing the descent. He fingered her clit for a moment
then lowered and let his other hand start fingering her still damp and bloody
slit. His seed mixed with her blood and lust. �Do you love me Amy?� 

She nodded and he moved his body
and pressed the head of his engorged cock at her rear entrance. �Do you want me
to enter your anal passage Amy?� She shook her head and he frowned down at her.
�Amy? Your life�s goal should be to please me, to make me happy. Do you want me
to enter your anal passage?�

It was tentative, but she nodded,
he smiled again. �Such an obedient wife I have Misha. She puts my wants and
desires above her own.� 

�Yes master as we all do.� 

The thrust was brutal, she screamed
as he laughed loudly reveling in the tight body surrounding him, as it bucked
and squirmed under him. Misha held her tightly his eyes closed his body
tattling on him as the bulge in his pants grew. 

Keane mastered himself and held
completely still till she calmed gasping in the gag. He leaned forward and took
the gag in his hands. �Not a word wife and I�ll let you breath.� She nodded
bobbing her head quickly. He rocked as she was freed and enjoyed the hearty
gasp. �Wonderful.� He murmured holding his body under his will. �Move,� he
murmured as he stopped. She tentatively shifted her hips. �More,� he ordered
with a low growl. She sobbed as she rocked her hips. He lost all semblance of
control plunging into her wildly for a number of strokes, then
he filled her and fell forward. 

�Misha,� he murmured and found
himself lifted and rolled gently onto his back. A warm cloth followed as he
relaxed completely and let him self fall into a deep satisfied sleep. 

Misha looked at the quietly crying
woman he cleaned her body with a warm cloth and then used another to wipe her
face. He motioned silence, she nodded. He covered them both and left the room
for his own. 

&nbsp;

Amy looked into the dark after
Misha left and pulled a deep breath into her lungs. She was no longer alone, she was no longer herself she was Mrs. Keane Von Serias.
