1Part 1.&nbsp; Ground Rules


 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Weddings, even the fairly small and traditional one that Meryn was planning, take time to arrange.&nbsp; A marriage, especially like the one between Meryn and Jeremy, which promised to be far from traditional, would almost certainly take a lifetime to fully evolve.&nbsp; Meryn understood this from the very start.&nbsp; She was exceedingly happy that she was going to spend her life with Jeremy, whom she now knew she loved beyond all reason, and who loved her, if possible, even more in return.&nbsp; But it was not going to be either simple or easy.&nbsp; Jeremy had come into her life a year ago, at least in his mind, as her slave.&nbsp; She had never truly considered him thus, even though that was how they had been introduced to each other by her friend Natasha, a lifestyle Domme.&nbsp; She had resisted accepting him as such in the beginning.&nbsp; But his gentle, always giving nature had charmed her.&nbsp; She had been further beguiled by his incredible strength of will, and determination to do things she asked of him, such as losing over one hundred pounds to prove himself, in his own mind, worthy of her.&nbsp; He would also deny himself the very simplest of pleasures unless he received her permission to partake of them.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At first she had thought of him merely as a helpmate, but very quickly he became a confidante and friend, and soon thereafter, her very best friend.&nbsp; They had come to share intimate relations, born more out of his fervent desire to give her pleasure, but she had always tried to reciprocate at least in part, in kind.&nbsp; They had not truly become lovers, however, until that night of the one year anniversary of their meeting, when they had finally discovered and acknowledged the deep love they had for each other, a love which they both had been afraid to declare.&nbsp; Now they were embarking on a journey to spend the rest of their lives together as husband and wife.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But Meryn knew that, in his heart, Jeremy still considered himself a slave.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t that she didn&#8217;t want him in part as such.&nbsp; It was just that she didn&#8217;t want him to think of himself as A slave, but only as HER slave.&nbsp; That part of him she would always accept, love, nurture and cherish.&nbsp; But she would want, and demand, far more from him.&nbsp; As her husband, she would want a partner, who would lead as well as be led, whom she could always trust to make his thoughts and desires known to her, and not just what he might believe she wanted him to think, know and do.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This, as she saw it, was her problem and her challenge.&nbsp; How was she to overcome Jeremy&#8217;s slave mindset, although she would always embrace his worship, adoration and devotion.&nbsp; How could she continue to encourage him to grow into the husband and man she wanted and needed him to be.&nbsp; This was not something she could just command him to do.&nbsp; It had to come from within him, something he wanted and needed as well, for it to be honest and real.&nbsp; And lasting.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Surprisingly, a hint of how she might begin to accomplish this came when she met her future mother-in-law for lunch soon after the engagement was announced.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Meryn, I can&#8217;t tell you how unbelievably happy I am about this.&nbsp; For both of you.�&nbsp; His mother began.&nbsp; �But I must admit, I was beginning to be very afraid that something like this would never happen for Jeremy.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Why so?�&nbsp; Meryn inquired, although she thought she knew in part the reason.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It has never been easy for Jeremy.�&nbsp; His mother sighed.&nbsp; �Maybe it&#8217;s because his father died before he was born, and he never had that influence.&nbsp; I tried my best with him.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You raised the most&nbsp; wonderful, loving, giving person.�&nbsp; Meryn replied.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I know he&#8217;s all that and has always been.&nbsp; But you are the first woman to have ever seen that.&nbsp; He never really seemed to have a problem having male friends, but he never seemed to be able to connect with women at all.&nbsp; Before you.&nbsp; Maybe it was just shyness or lack of self confidence.&nbsp; I always taught him to honor and respect women.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�He certainly does that and more.�&nbsp; Meryn smiled.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�And, of course, his weight never helped.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know how you did it, Meryn.&nbsp; How you were able to get him to do something like that, which he had never been able to even begin to do before.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I asked.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh it had to be more than that.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And it had been.&nbsp; At least in the beginning.&nbsp; It had been her challenge to him, something she had also believed he would never be able to do, which would give her a legitimate excuse to be able to part ways with him without her feeling guilty.&nbsp; But he had succeeded, had proven himself to her, in extraordinary fashion, by losing nineteen pounds alone in the very first week of their acquaintance.&nbsp; For her.&nbsp; Because she had asked.&nbsp; That had moved her more than she could have ever believed.&nbsp; And it had started them on the path to where they were now, which was something else she also found extraordinary and unforseen.&nbsp; She smiled inwardly to herself as she remembered that he had recently finally broken the two hundred pound barrier, weighing in at 195, giving him a more than one hundred pound weight loss from his start.&nbsp; She had told him that this was more than enough.&nbsp; She was perfectly happy now with the toned physique he had so laboriously attained.&nbsp; For her.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It really had to be more than that, I know.�&nbsp; His mother continued.&nbsp; �Of course he did it for love of you.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t think even that could have been enough for what he&#8217;s accomplished since he met you.&nbsp; Not just his weight.&nbsp; His confidence.&nbsp; His new success in his career.&nbsp; His interactions with others.�&nbsp; She paused.&nbsp; �You saw the man in him, that nobody else could see.&nbsp; Which even he couldn&#8217;t see or believe was there.&nbsp; And you helped bring him out.&nbsp; You did that, Meryn.&nbsp; For that I can never thank you enough.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Meryn blushed.&nbsp; She felt she was getting far too much credit.&nbsp; It had always been there in Jeremy, and a lot more was still there waiting to be drawn out.&nbsp; Yes, she was willing to admit that she had helped.&nbsp; She had been a catalyst.&nbsp; And then she suddenly understood something more.&nbsp; Jeremy had grown, had become so much more in the year that they had been together, but it had happened in large part, maybe even in toto, because she had accepted him into her life as her slave.&nbsp; He had begun to become a more confident, accomplished person as she allowed him to continue to be her slave.&nbsp; Perhaps that was the clue.&nbsp; Maybe she could continue to use his ongoing desire to be her slave, to please her always, to spur him on to further become the man and husband she desired, and he deserved to be.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I can&#8217;t tell you how much that means to me.�&nbsp; Meryn concluded sincerely to his mother.&nbsp; �And how much our talk today has helped me understand Jeremy a little bit more.�


 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Over the next several months, as they continued to live together in her brownstone as they prepared for their coming wedding day, Meryn had several opportunities to test her theory, and she used a variety of approaches.&nbsp; The first was the gentlest and occurred soon after her talk with his mother.&nbsp; She had joined him in the bedroom one evening, and began to help him fold and put away the large baskets of laundry he had just washed and dried, a job he knew she hated to do.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Meryn,� he had said.&nbsp; �You don&#8217;t need to do this.&nbsp; It&#8217;s my job.&nbsp; Why don&#8217;t you go into the living room and rest.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�My love.�&nbsp; She had replied.&nbsp; �Can&#8217;t you understand that there are times that I just want to be with you, do things with you, even if it&#8217;s housework.&nbsp; That it makes me happy to do it with you?�&nbsp; Seeing that she had captured his undivided attention, she continued on.&nbsp; �And that there will be times when I&#8217;ll want to do some chores by myself, just because it pleases me to know that I&#8217;m doing something for you.&nbsp; There may also be times,� she added, �when I&#8217;ll do something that you usually do, just because I enjoy doing it.&nbsp; Isn&#8217;t that what it&#8217;s all about?&nbsp; Being happy?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He had no viable argument to offer.&nbsp; This was what it was all about for him.&nbsp; Her happiness.&nbsp; Which then made him happy.&nbsp; If she wanted to join him with the chores, or do some on her own, if it gave her pleasure, he would always be happy and content with that.&nbsp; Of a surety, she knew he would still be doing the lion&#8217;s share of the housework, and she didn&#8217;t mind that he considered all of it his ultimate responsibility.&nbsp; But he never again complained or seemed the least bit upset when she chipped in to help.&nbsp; And so she counted this encounter a success.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The next opportunity required her to be somewhat firmer.&nbsp; They had been discussing several of her ideas for the wedding and reception, and he had replied earnestly, �Whatever you want, Meryn.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She stopped short.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No Jeremy.�&nbsp; She sharply responded.&nbsp; �It&#8217;s not &#8216;Whatever I want&#8217;.&nbsp; I never want it to be &#8216;Whatever I want&#8217;.&nbsp; There will be many times in private, you can be sure, when I will demand your unquestioning obedience.�&nbsp; She declared emphatically.&nbsp; �But in the everyday world where we&#8217;ll live most of our lives, what I WILL always want from you is to know what you think, what your opinions are, even when I haven&#8217;t asked.� 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She paused, then continued more calmly.&nbsp; �There will be times when we disagree, and I will defer to you because it might seem to me that it means more to you than to me, and I know you will do the same for me.�&nbsp; Far too often, she feared, unless she was vigilant.&nbsp; �And if there are times, when we strongly disagree, we WILL work to find a compromise.&nbsp; If I ever sense that you&#8217;re giving in to me on something you feel strongly about, without us attempting to find a compromise, then I will really become angry.&nbsp; And even worse, I will be greatly disappointed.&nbsp; And I know you don&#8217;t ever want to disappoint me�&nbsp; Which, in itself, she knew, would be his most severe punishment.&nbsp; �Do I make myself clear?�&nbsp; She added ominously.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Ma&#8217;am.�&nbsp; He firmly responded.&nbsp; She allowed herself a small smile at the appellation they had previously agreed that he could use whenever he needed to acknowledge her dominance, and his submissiveness.&nbsp; It wouldn&#8217;t be used often, but she would accept it when it was, for what it meant.&nbsp; Especially such as now, when he was agreeing to be a willing and equal participant in their decision making from now on.&nbsp; Because he now realized that this was what she truly wanted and needed.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her third confrontation with an unwelcome manifestation of Jeremy&#8217;s slave mentality happened about a month and a half later, and provoked her most vigorous response.&nbsp; It occurred one night when they were sharing intimate love.&nbsp; Since the night of their betrothal, Meryn had insisted that they frequently, although not always, include intercourse in their actions.&nbsp; Since this would be one of his most pleasurable husbandly duties, he never saw any reason to complain.&nbsp; But as he had become a master at finding new and creative ways to drive her into an orgasmic frenzy using other techniques, she usually most willingly allowed and encouraged him to do so.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This particular night, Meryn had decided to belatedly explore something she had wanted to do with him for some time.&nbsp; She bade him to lay naked on his back on the bed.&nbsp; She then disrobed, climbed up to straddle his ankles on her knees, and slowly began to stoke the insides of his thighs to his groin with her hands.&nbsp; His manhood jutted up in front of her, thick and rock hard.&nbsp; She cooed to him as she licked her lips, and then slowly bent forward to begin to nuzzle, nibble and lick his eager erection.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No Meryn.&nbsp; Please don&#8217;t.�&nbsp; He suddenly protested attempting to pull away from her.&nbsp; �You shouldn&#8217;t.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not right.� 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She sat bolt upright on her heels, towering over him, initially perplexed and clearly angry.&nbsp; Then she understood where this was coming from.&nbsp; And that she had to put a stop to it.&nbsp; Now and forever.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Listen slave.�&nbsp; She retorted hotly.&nbsp; �Haven&#8217;t you sworn to me time and again that I own you body and soul?&nbsp; Haven&#8217;t you?�&nbsp; She practically snarled.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Ma&#8217;am.�&nbsp; He whispered back.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She grabbed his now softening penis and held it firmly in her hand.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�So who owns this then?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You do.�&nbsp; He replied.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Damn right I do.�&nbsp; She gripped him more tightly.&nbsp; �This is MY prick.&nbsp; Mine.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t you ever, ever forget it.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He could only nod.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�If I want to suck on my prick like a baby suckles on a breast for mother&#8217;s milk, I will do so.&nbsp; Any time, any way I want.&nbsp; Is that understood?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He nodded again.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�And I definitely want to do so now.�&nbsp; She paused and held his eyes with hers to make sure he got the message.&nbsp; �And slave, my prick better be able to produce the nourishment I want, or there will be hell to pay.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With that she bent back down and began to lick, slurp, and deep throat her prick to her heart&#8217;s delight, until, with permission implied in her previous command, he could take no more, and he erupted into her mouth.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She held him within her until she was sure he was done, and then crawled up with a mouth full of his spunk, and French kissed him, sharing the spoils of her conquest.&nbsp; After several long, blissful moments of this, she pulled back and rewarded him with a smile.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Always remember this, my love.&nbsp; I will take what I own whenever I want.&nbsp; But I will always share fully with you whatever joy I receive.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With eyes glistening, he responded.&nbsp; �Yes Ma&#8217;am.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Always.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She waited a few more seconds, clearly enjoying the moment, and then continued.&nbsp; �And now I think you should put what&#8217;s left of my treasure where it properly belongs.�&nbsp; With that she rolled onto her back, and demurely spread her legs.&nbsp; Needing no further encouragement, he shimmied his face down between her thighs, where he spent most of the rest of the night gloriously attempting to deposit any of the remaining seed in his mouth into her inner sanctum.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Later, as she basked in the after haze of his attentions, she reflected on what had taken place over the past several months.&nbsp; She really didn&#8217;t think that there would be any further protests about acts that he might believe were beneath her, or that he might feel he didn&#8217;t have any right to enjoy.&nbsp; Manipulating his slave mindset had clearly helped continue his development into the man she wanted, and the husband she would need.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t know if this would always be the way to deal with any further issues and problems that may arise in the future.&nbsp; But, she mused to herself, it certainly had given them both a good start.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 









1Part 2.&nbsp; The Wedding


 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Their wedding day, which had seemed so far away when they had first set the date, they now seemed to be hurtling towards in a frenzy.&nbsp; Meryn honestly believed that she might have lost her mind if it hadn&#8217;t been for the organizational skills, the attention to detail, but most of all the calm and collected presence of Jeremy.&nbsp; As he had often done before, he had impressed upon her the importance of delegating authority.&nbsp; This had become a vital tool for her at work, where she had previously felt it necessary to attend to every detail of a job herself.&nbsp; Now that she was in charge as manager of a thus far immensely successful investment project for her company, she had come to utilize his advice and council to great advantage.&nbsp; That she was doing so as well with the myriad details of her ... no ...&nbsp; their&nbsp; plans for the wedding and reception, and that most of the delegation of the necessary grunt work fell onto him, did not seem to bother him in the least.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As they had planned, it was going to be a relatively small and simple affair, with about eighty or so guests.&nbsp; The majority of them would be relatives and friends of Meryn.&nbsp; Jeremy only had his mother and two distant cousins, but there was also a recently increasing number of friends among his coworkers from the school where he taught.&nbsp; They would each have only one attendant, one of Meryn&#8217;s sisters being her Matron of Honor.&nbsp; It was Jeremy&#8217;s choice for Best Man that took her completely by surprise.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�SCOTT?�&nbsp; She sputtered.&nbsp; Scott?&nbsp; Natasha&#8217;s slave, Scott?&nbsp; She hadn&#8217;t seen Scott in over a year, since that night which she wished she could forget.&nbsp; The night when she had lost control of herself, and almost caused him serious harm.&nbsp; On those very rare occasions when she thought of Scott at all, only two images came to mind.&nbsp; The first, which she had tried to banish forever from her thoughts, was of a flame red backside, arched up over a small vaulting horse, which she had tortured unmercifully, nearly to the breaking point.&nbsp; The second, which was the only other position in which she could remember him, was on his hands and knees, prostrate, groveling at Natasha&#8217;s feet.&nbsp; What possibly could he and Jeremy have in common?&nbsp; No, she had to admit ...&nbsp; in a very certain way they were&nbsp; kindred spirits.&nbsp; Still, how and why had they developed such a bond?&nbsp;&nbsp; What possibly could Jeremy see in him?&nbsp; All she could see was a mindless, spineless drone, who was enslaved in every way to Natasha.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�He&#8217;s really a very nice guy.�&nbsp; Jeremy volunteered, seeing her reaction.&nbsp; �He&#8217;s very friendly and giving.&nbsp;&nbsp; Super intelligent.&nbsp; And he has a great sense of humor.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The last she most certainly would have never suspected.&nbsp; But how had he come to know that?&nbsp; How had they become such friends that he now was going to be Jeremy&#8217;s Best Man?&nbsp; When she asked him that, he grew quite contrite.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�He looked me up at my school about a year ago, and asked me if I could teach him how to cook.&nbsp; He told me that it was a major problem for him.�&nbsp; And for Natasha as well, she thought.&nbsp; �I said of course, and we&#8217;ve been doing things together ever since.&nbsp; He&#8217;s taught me a great deal as well.&nbsp; How to exercise and work out.&nbsp; He&#8217;s shown me a lot about computers which is the business he&#8217;s in.&nbsp; I really like him a lot, and we&#8217;ve become very good friends.�&nbsp; He hung his head.&nbsp; �Meryn, I&#8217;m really sorry about this.&nbsp; I hope you&#8217;re not too upset.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Of course not, Jeremy.�&nbsp; She replied carefully.&nbsp; �You can have any friends that you want.&nbsp; I&#8217;m glad you have close friends.&nbsp; It&#8217;s just...�&nbsp; She hesitated.&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t want us to ever have any secrets from each other.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I know.&nbsp; I wanted to tell you, but I knew how you no longer wanted for us to ever get together with them again, and I was...well...afraid.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You never have to be afraid of being open with me Jeremy.�&nbsp; She said somewhat sternly.&nbsp; Another lesson for him to learn.&nbsp; �It&#8217;s just that I obviously don&#8217;t know Scott very well, and what I thought I did know wasn&#8217;t very flattering.&nbsp; But I guess that&#8217;s as much my fault as anyone&#8217;s.�&nbsp; Another thought suddenly occurred to her.&nbsp; �Does Natasha know about all this?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well, in the beginning, I think she actually ordered him to seek me out for cooking lessons, and she&#8217;s apparently been happy with those results.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t think she knew how much our relationship had developed until he asked her for permission to be my Best Man.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�And she gave it?�&nbsp; Meryn inquired, annoyed that it even had to be asked, and knowing that if it hadn&#8217;t been given, she was going to have words with &#8216;Miss Natasha&#8217;.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I think she was quite surprised by how close we&#8217;ve become, and I suspect he suffered some extra Penance� she winced,&nbsp; �for springing it on her like that.�&nbsp; He smiled.&nbsp; �But yes, she gave her permission, and actually told him she was very pleased to do so.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How so like Natasha to react like that.&nbsp; She was still perturbed that Natasha had known about Scott and Jeremy before she had, but there was no way she was ever going to let her know that.&nbsp; She felt let down in Jeremy&#8217;s reluctance to have confided in her about Scott before this, but she somewhat understood.&nbsp; It was just something more she was going to have to work out with him over time.&nbsp; In the end, she was very glad that he had someone who was close and important to him, who would be standing up with him on that day.&nbsp; She had actually feared that he would have no one, as before this she had not known of anyone he seemed close enough to.&nbsp; That he really did have someone overcame any other concerns she might have had, and ultimately made her very happy.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the Wedding Day finally arrived their levels of composure were the opposite to what they had been in the days leading up to it.&nbsp; Meryn awoke, calm and serene, secure in the knowledge that she was absolutely making the right choice.&nbsp; Jeremy was nervous and anxious the entire day, forever wondering if Meryn was finally going to change her mind when she realized that she could do so much better.&nbsp; It was an irrational fear, he knew.&nbsp; His Goddess would never do anything like that.&nbsp; But he didn&#8217;t fully believe until he saw her walking down the aisle toward him, a joyous smile on her face.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was radiant in her simple and elegant, sleeveless and strapless white gown.&nbsp; Instead of a veil, she wore a small tiara, perfectly befitting the Queen of his heart, as well as all else.&nbsp; He looked quite dashing in his black tuxedo, white ruffled shirt and vest and white bow tie.&nbsp; Known only to both of them was something more he wore underneath.&nbsp; Tied around the center of her prick was a small white bow ribbon, a symbol of what else they were pledging to each other on this day.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The wedding was held at a small country inn which they had rented exclusively for the day, and where they would be staying in a lovely suite overnight.&nbsp; It was officiated by a Judge who was an acquaintance of Natasha.&nbsp; After a few pleasant opening and introductory remarks by Her Honor, the Judge, they proceeded on to the exchange of rings, and the vows they had written themselves.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Meryn.�&nbsp; Jeremy began most earnestly.&nbsp; �With this ring I swear not only to love, honor and obey, but even more, to always worship and adore you.&nbsp; I promise to devote every moment of my life to bringing you joy, comfort and happiness with the entirety of my being.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To everyone else attending, this seemed a very lovely statement such as one would make on their wedding day.&nbsp; Only Meryn knew that he had truly meant, and would always try to act on every word of it.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Jeremy.�&nbsp; She responded in kind.&nbsp; �With this ring I accept in all ways your love and devotion, and I vow that I will always strive to be worthy of you.&nbsp; Know that I will always return it all to you with every part of my heart and soul.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With that they were joined.&nbsp; They were so entranced with each other during their long, lingering, concluding kiss, that they did not even hear the loud accompanying applause.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then it was on to the reception.&nbsp; It was a very festive affair.&nbsp; Meryn had pulled rank, exercised her authority without debate, and had insisted on �Wind Beneath My Wings� as the song for their first dance.&nbsp; Jeremy had been deeply touched.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The band was very lively and Meryn spent much of the rest of the reception dancing with a large number of their guests.&nbsp; She was pleased to see Jeremy dance with both mothers and both of her sisters, and then was surprised to see him ask Natasha, who had also seemed somewhat surprised as well, but had graciously accepted.&nbsp; While he had been confident and assured dancing with the others, with Natasha he was tentative and awkward, but she quickly took charge and the lead, and after that it went well.&nbsp; Towards the end of their dance, she leaned forward and whispered into his ear.&nbsp; He nodded vigorously, smiled, leaned forward and whispered into hers.&nbsp; She raised her eyebrows, offered a small smile herself, and gave him a quick peck on the cheek as they parted.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After observing this, Meryn realized that despite the large number of dance partners she had had, she had not danced with Scott.&nbsp; Indeed he had hardly interacted with her at all, other than his offer of a barely audible congratulations to them both after the ceremony.&nbsp; She considered going to ask him to do so, he was Jeremy&#8217;s Best Man after all, when she was waylaid by Mr. Martin, the President of her company and her boss, who claimed his turn with her on the dance floor, and she quickly forgot about Scott.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The party had been fabulous, and they had both had an excellent time, but the part of the night she was most looking forward to had arrived at last, so she indicated to Jeremy that the time had come.&nbsp; Wishing their guests goodnight, but urging them to party on, they then retired to their upstairs suite.&nbsp; After being carried across the threshold, Meryn asked Jeremy to open the chilled bottle of champagne that had been left for them, while she changed into something more comfortable.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She returned a short while later wearing the new white negligee and robe she had bought for the occasion.&nbsp; She saw the Jeremy had taken off his jacket, vest and bow tie, and had a glass of champagne waiting for her.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well, my love,� she said to him, smiling, �this was certainly a magical day, and I wish I could say I could have danced all night, but I don&#8217;t think my feet could have taken any more.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Recognizing a cue when it was given, Jeremy smiled back and nodded toward the bottle of scented foot lotion he had already taken out.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes.�&nbsp; She responded, noting it.&nbsp; �I think this is the perfect time for my daily foot massage.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And it was a daily ritual they had from the very first days of their relationship.&nbsp; Upon arriving home from work every night, Jeremy would greet her with a cold drink, and proceed on his knees to massage out the tensions of the day from her feet, as they discussed their daily events.&nbsp; It always set a calming and pleasant tone for the rest of the evening.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�But as this is a special night,� she continued, �I would like this to be special as well.�&nbsp; She smiled again.&nbsp; �I want you naked as you do it tonight.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Stripping quickly to comply with her command, Jeremy then knelt in front of her, warmed the lotion in his hands, and began to lovingly knead her feet and toes.&nbsp; They talked contentedly about the day&#8217;s events, and how well they had gone, as she sipped her champagne and luxuriated in his attentions.&nbsp; As her massage neared its end, curiosity got the best of her and she had to ask. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�So what did Natasha whisper into your ear at the end of your dance?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jeremy stopped his ministrations, looked up at her, and offered a small, wry grin.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�She told me to serve my Mistress well.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�And what, pray tell, did you whisper back?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His grin now became one of his heart warming smiles.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I told her that I most certainly would.&nbsp; But that I would always love you even more.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She couldn&#8217;t help the sigh that escaped as her eyes glistened.&nbsp; She took a moment to compose herself.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Jeremy, before we proceed on to what&nbsp; we&#8217;ve both been dying for, I think I would very much like for you to offer me your devotional first.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This was another ritual that had become such an important part of their lives.&nbsp; Each night before going to bed Jeremy would again approach Meryn on his knees and slowly, softly, reverently kiss every inch of both of her feet, including the tops, tips and bottoms of every&nbsp; toe.&nbsp; While he performed this devotional, he would thank her for allowing him to serve her that day, and then beseech her to allow him to continue to do so the next.&nbsp; She would always grant him this wish.&nbsp; Tonight she wanted it to be the beginning of something new.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�But, my love, you no longer need to ask to be allowed to continue on with me each and every day.&nbsp; That I promised you today for all the rest of our lives.�&nbsp; She paused, and then grinned.&nbsp; �Of course I never tire of hearing how much you love and adore me.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And so, as he offered his devotional on this special night, he waxed his most poetic in extolling her innumerable virtues, and his undying love, worship and devotion.&nbsp; He added his own difference, when instead of kissing every toe, he took each individually into his mouth and gently sucked and swirled his tongue around them, savoring the taste of each.&nbsp; By the time he was finished, she was beyond excitement, and knew it was well past time for the consecration of their marriage.&nbsp; To increase the anticipation and to make it more special for this night, she had forbidden intercourse between them for the previous two months, and all sexual activity for the past several weeks.&nbsp; They were both more than ready.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She bade him to stand up

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Present my prick.�&nbsp; She ordered hungrily.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He stood up, her prick at attention and bobbing before her, the white bow ribbon tied around it&#8217;s shaft.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Ah Love, you look so, so delicious.�&nbsp; She said as she bent forward to untie the ribbon.&nbsp; �But before we move on to the main course, I believe I would first like a little appetizer.�&nbsp; With that she lay back on the recliner, pulled her robe open, her negligee up, and spread her legs to reveal nothing worn underneath.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Needing no further urging, Jeremy sank to his knees again and buried his face between her thighs.&nbsp; It didn&#8217;t take long or very much effort to bring her to her first incredible high.&nbsp; As she did not want to ruin her appetite for the main banquet, she then commanded.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Take me Jeremy.&nbsp; Take me now�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He immediately sprang up, picked her up in his arms, and carried her to the king sized bed, where for the rest of the night they both partook of the feast of a lifetime.&nbsp; If it had been counted in calories, Jeremy may have regained his entire one hundred pounds that night, and Meryn likely even more.&nbsp; As it was, they built up a huge reserve of love and trust that would hopefully sustain them as they traveled down the unknown and uncharted road of their new lives together.&nbsp; 














1Part 3.&nbsp; Scott


 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Their honeymoon was a magical time that they would always cherish.&nbsp; Meryn and Jeremy spent two weeks at a private beachfront villa in St. Marten which had been arranged by Scott through one of his business associates.&nbsp; While they certainly had enjoyed the sun, surf ,and sights together, they had spent the better part of their time with Jeremy&#8217;s face planted between her thighs, or with Meryn&#8217;s legs wrapped around his groin.&nbsp; There was even some time with her lips and tongue encircling and enveloping her prick.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But the real world, and their life within it awaited them on their return home.&nbsp; Their home.&nbsp; Meryn was immersed at work in preparing the second phase of her investment project, after the spectacular success of the first.&nbsp; There was speculation and rumors floating around the company that if the second phase went as well as the first, she would be in line for a Vice Presidency, becoming the youngest ever in the history of the company.&nbsp; She tried her best to put these rumors out of her mind.&nbsp; There was still far too much time, hard work, effort and results to be attained before she could be thinking of anything like that.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For his part, Jeremy was having success in his career as well.&nbsp; He had been appointed Vice Chairman of the English Department in his school district for the coming year, and as the current chairman was planning to retire in another year, he certainly appeared to be the heir apparent for that position.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Their lives were thus kept very busy by their work responsibilities.&nbsp; He continued to be primarily responsible for all the domestic duties, but she helped out as much as she could, with nary a peep of protest any more from him.&nbsp; They settled into a comfortable but hectic routine.&nbsp; Her weekly hour-long total body massages, usually reserved for Friday nights, became more frequent as he sensed her heightened tension from the increasing stresses of her job.&nbsp; They thoroughly enjoyed the time they were able to make and spend with each other, but after several months Meryn realized that their social life had become almost non existent.&nbsp; They were able to go out for an occasional dinner and movie, but they hadn&#8217;t been able to do very much with friends. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In reality, as a couple, they didn&#8217;t really have any close friends.&nbsp; Meryn talked to Natasha frequently on the phone, and they got together several times a month for lunch.&nbsp; Now that he felt free to tell her, she knew that Jeremy and Scott also did things together.&nbsp; She thought it strange that she and Natasha, and Jeremy and Scott should be each other&#8217;s closest friend, but the four of them had nothing to do with each other as couples.&nbsp; Maybe not so strange, she admitted to herself.&nbsp; She had been primarily responsible for that.&nbsp; But things had changed, hadn&#8217;t they?&nbsp; She and Jeremy were married now, and secure in their, albeit, unusual relationship.&nbsp; She shouldn&#8217;t feel threatened any more by how Natasha and Scott might interact between themselves in private.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unfortunately, she had to acknowledge, she still barely knew Scott.&nbsp; He rarely visited their home, and when he did, it was usually when she was at work, as Jeremy always got home before her to begin to prepare dinner and start his chores.&nbsp; One time she had left work early and found him there with Jeremy.&nbsp; He had quickly said �Hello Miss Meryn�, eyes cast down, and then hurriedly said that he had to get home to his Mistress, and left.&nbsp; She had come to the conclusion that Scott didn&#8217;t like her.&nbsp; She broached this to Jeremy one night during her evening foot massage.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s true at all.�&nbsp; He told her.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Then what is it?�&nbsp; She queried.&nbsp; �He never talks to me.&nbsp; He hardly ever looks at me.&nbsp; He didn&#8217;t even dance with me at our wedding.&nbsp; As your Best Man.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jeremy was silent for a few moments.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I think he&#8217;s afraid of you.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She shuddered.&nbsp; �Because of...that night?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He chuckled.&nbsp; �No, no.&nbsp; Not at all.&nbsp; Although I&#8217;m sure he doesn&#8217;t have the fondest memory of it.&nbsp; He certainly would never hold that against you.&nbsp; He knows that that&#8217;s part of the life he&#8217;s accepted.&nbsp; And even desires.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Meryn couldn&#8217;t quite bring herself to believe that, but forged ahead.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; �So what is he afraid of then.&nbsp; I saw him at the wedding with other people.&nbsp; He was friendly, engaging.&nbsp; You say he has a great sense of humor.&nbsp; How come I never experience any of that with him?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jeremy paused again before answering.&nbsp; Considering.&nbsp; He finally offered.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�In the outside world, Scott is a tremendously successful businessman and entrepreneur, and he can interact with most people on that level.&nbsp; But in what he considers his real life, he&#8217;s a slave.&nbsp; And you&#8217;re a Mistress.&nbsp; Not his Mistress, but a Mistress nonetheless.&nbsp; And he doesn&#8217;t know how to approach you.&nbsp; How you would respond.&nbsp; If you would think him presumptuous, or even worse, for even daring to take up a moment of your time.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh Jeremy, that&#8217;s just silly.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He stopped his kneading of her feet.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No.�&nbsp; He said quietly.&nbsp; �It&#8217;s not.&nbsp; Not for us.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She couldn&#8217;t help but notice the reference to &#8216;us&#8217;.&nbsp; Kindred spirits indeed.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�So what can I do then?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He began massaging her feet again.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I don&#8217;t know.&nbsp; Natasha and he are much deeper&nbsp; psychologically into this lifestyle than we are, so he has a lot farther to come than I did.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�And you still have a long way to go.�&nbsp; She said lightly.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I know.�&nbsp; He acknowledged.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So, apparently, did she.&nbsp; Meryn sat silently for several minutes, thinking and contemplating while Jeremy continued with his care of her feet.&nbsp; Finally...

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Jeremy.&nbsp; I want you to do something for me.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Your wish is always my command.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In their case this was quite literally true.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;ve been having trouble fully integrating my home computer program with the new system at work, and my IT people there haven&#8217;t been able to work out the kinks.�&nbsp; In reality this wasn&#8217;t true.&nbsp; They had told her that they could fix it but they would have to come over to work on her home computer, and she hadn&#8217;t had them do so yet.&nbsp; �Since it&#8217;s his area of expertise, I&#8217;d like you to ask Scott to come over on Saturday to see if he could help me with it.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;ll ask him.�&nbsp; Jeremy said warily.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�And when he&#8217;s here, I&#8217;m going to send you on an errand out of the house.&nbsp; I want to have a talk with Scott.&nbsp; Alone.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jeremy nodded slowly.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I think that would be best.&nbsp; And good.�&nbsp; Then he added.&nbsp; �You know he&#8217;s going to have to ask&nbsp; Natasha for permission.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;`�I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s going to be a problem.�&nbsp; She answered.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And it wasn&#8217;t.&nbsp; She called Natasha the next day, explaining the computer problem, and requesting Scott&#8217;s services.&nbsp; After expounding at length about what dolts the IT people were at their company, Natasha assured her that Scott would be there promptly at whatever time she wanted him on 
Saturday, and that he would fix her problem if he knew what was good for him.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On Saturday, Scott arrived at the apartment precisely at 11:00 AM as requested.&nbsp; Jeremy met him at the door, and they went together into the computer room so that Scott could begin his work.&nbsp; After about fifteen minutes, Meryn called to Jeremy from the living room that she wanted him to go out to the store for her.&nbsp; He promptly left, and Scott, remained behind, working.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Several minutes later, Meryn entered the computer room.&nbsp; She observed him silently from behind, his back straight, appearing confident and comfortable, his fingers dancing over the keyboard as he watched the monitor, with windows popping up and out at his direction at a dizzying pace.&nbsp; This was a different person than the one to whom she had been exposed.&nbsp; This was the person she wanted to get to know, and this was the real reason she had him brought here.&nbsp; It was time to get on with it.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Hello Scott.�&nbsp; She began.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He jerked, and rapidly swivelled in his chair to face her, appearing flustered as if he didn&#8217;t know whether to stand up, kneel down, or stay where he was.&nbsp; She tried to make it easy by indicating he should stay put, as she pulled over a chair and sat down a few feet away from him.&nbsp; He settled for directing his eyes to the floor.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good morning Miss Meryn.�&nbsp; He answered in a low voice.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I just wanted to tell you how much I appreciate your help with my computer problem.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It&#8217;s my honor and duty, Miss Meryn.�&nbsp; He replied, eyes still cast down.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes, well, I still greatly appreciate it.�&nbsp; She paused.&nbsp; �But I want to be totally honest with you Scott.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t really need your help with the computer.&nbsp; I had another reason I wanted you to come over today.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He now raised his eyes slowly to look at her, tentatively.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I started to suspect that.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Why so?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A ghost of a smile creased the corners of his lips.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I could see that even a &#8216;dolt&#8217; of an IT person could have handled this easily.&nbsp; I should be finished in a couple of minutes, so I don&#8217;t understand why you had to go out of your way to have me do it.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Okay then.&nbsp; Let me tell you the real reason I wanted to have you over today.&nbsp; I wanted to have a chance to talk to you.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He didn&#8217;t respond for several moments.&nbsp; Then...

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Why Miss Meryn?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Because you&#8217;re Jeremy&#8217;s closest friend, and I don&#8217;t know you at all.&nbsp; And I&#8217;d like to.&nbsp; But you seem to try to avoid me at every opportunity.�&nbsp; She had to know for sure.&nbsp; �Is it because of that one ... ah ... encounter we had last year?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No Miss Meryn.&nbsp; Please believe me.&nbsp; Not at all.�&nbsp; He now offered a slightly larger smile.&nbsp; �Although I must admit you wield a mean paddle.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She grimaced, and he lost his smile quickly.&nbsp; He looked at her uncertain, as if he was struggling to make a decision.&nbsp; She sat expectantly.&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally he took a deep breath and continued.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I learned later on from Jeremy that that is not part of your makeup, and how much you dislike that type of thing.�&nbsp; He began slowly.&nbsp; �I think it may have been unfair of my Mistress to have put you in that position.&nbsp; Now I&#8217;m far more concerned that you were upset and guilty about it, and I beg you not to be.&nbsp; It IS a part of my makeup.�&nbsp; He shrugged.&nbsp; �I may not enjoy certain aspects of it very much.&nbsp; But it is who I am, and what I&#8217;ve accepted.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She nodded.&nbsp; �I can&#8217;t pretend that I understand that part of you Scott.�&nbsp; She admitted.&nbsp; �I still have difficulty understanding many things about Jeremy.&nbsp; But I know from him that there is far, far more to you than that.&nbsp; And I&#8217;d like to get to know THAT person a lot better.&nbsp; And maybe even become friends.&nbsp; As my husband has the privilege of being.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He looked baffled, and even a little embarrassed.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s possible Miss Meryn.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Why not?&nbsp; Look, everything begins with a first step.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s start with something simple.&nbsp; I&#8217;d like you to stop calling me Miss.&nbsp; Just call me ...�
She paused and considered for a moment, then decided.&nbsp; �... Meryn.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I don&#8217;t think my Mistress would approve.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Now I know you were here when Natasha declared that in my house I make the rules.&nbsp; So I say again.&nbsp; Please, just call me Meryn.&nbsp; You know,� she went on, � other than my mother, Jeremy is the only person I like calling me that.&nbsp; But I really think I would like you to do so as well.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Scott was looking at her as if he really didn&#8217;t know what to say.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�And if there are times,� she continued, �when you feel ... circumstances make it necessary for you to be more ... formal ... then just call me Miss Meri.&nbsp; What do you say?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He answered with a tentative smile.&nbsp; �That you make the rules here ... Meryn.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good.&nbsp; That&#8217;s settled.&nbsp; Now how do we get Natasha to buy into all this, so that the four of us can be friends together outside of our private lives?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Scott lost his smile again in a hurry.&nbsp; �That, I&#8217;m afraid ,isn&#8217;t going to happen.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Again I ask, why not?&nbsp; I know Natasha well.&nbsp; She&#8217;s a fun loving person and my dearest friend.&nbsp; Why wouldn&#8217;t she want the type of relationship with all of us where we could all just be friends.&nbsp; At least some of the time.&nbsp; And maybe she can get to know a little better, herself, the person I&#8217;m talking to now.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Because she&#8217;s never shown the slightest interest in getting to know that person,� he responded&nbsp; rapidly, �or in having anything more than the relationship that we have.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Wouldn&#8217;t you like it?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That has no importance at all.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You can&#8217;t really mean that Scott.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�But I do.�&nbsp; He answered firmly.&nbsp; �With my Mistress I had only one choice to make, and once I made it, no more were allowed.&nbsp; It&#8217;s do what&#8217;s demanded, and receive only what&#8217;s given.&nbsp; And I accept that totally, to be able to keep what I have.�&nbsp; He stopped for a moment.&nbsp; �Oh, I guess in a physical way I could still choose differently.&nbsp; But mentally there is no longer any other choice for me.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�But wouldn&#8217;t you like more?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Scott looked down at the floor, and then back up at her, a wistful expression on his face.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What you and Jeremy have is so very special,� he said softly.&nbsp; �To have something even distantly approaching it requires two people who want it.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t believe there is any reason to believe that that will ever happen with us.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Meryn suddenly understood so much more.&nbsp; She wondered whether Natasha had any idea.&nbsp; She wanted to say so much more, but didn&#8217;t know how.&nbsp; Instead ...

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Scott,� she began �I would like to ask your permission to talk to Natasha about some of the issues we&#8217;ve discussed today.&nbsp; I promise you that I will hold everything WE&#8217;VE talked about in the strictest confidence.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He smiled, but his eyes held a sadness.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I can&#8217;t begin to thank you enough for that consideration, or tell you how much it means to me that you offer it.�&nbsp; He bit his lip.&nbsp; �I truly wish I could extend that same courtesy to you.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now it was Meryn&#8217;s turn to feel a certain sadness.&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I understand.�&nbsp; She assured him, not really sure that she did.&nbsp; �I would still very much like to have your permission though.&nbsp; May I?&nbsp; Please.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His smile widened a little bit, and his eyes seemed a little less sad.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes ... Of course ... Meryn.�


&nbsp;&nbsp; 


 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;









1Part 4.&nbsp; Natasha


 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Meryn knew that Natasha was going to be a far more difficult challenge, even though she knew her so much better, and considered her a very close friend.&nbsp; There seemed to be two Natashas these days.&nbsp; There was the Natasha she had known for years, whom she still talked to all the time on the phone, and frequently got together with for lunch, laughing and joking, sharing confidences, and generally&nbsp; being very comfortable with.&nbsp; Then there was Natasha, the Domme, who seemed to revel in the power and thrill of totally controlling and manipulating another human being.&nbsp; Owning him in all but the legal sense.&nbsp; This Natasha had introduced her to Jeremy, and had at least begun to show her how to meet the needs that Jeremy had.&nbsp; The fact that Natasha had done this, not out of any consideration or thought for Jeremy, but because she felt that Meryn would also come to relish the lifestyle, was almost beside the point.&nbsp; Meryn and Jeremy had grown into their own unique relationship, and met each others wants and needs in their own way.&nbsp;&nbsp; She would always be grateful to Natasha for being the spark.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But it was this second Natasha that she had been avoiding for well over a year, and whom she feared she was going to have to deal with now.&nbsp; She felt that it had now become even more important to her than just hoping that she and Jeremy could develop a comfortable friendship, outside the context of their private lives, with Natasha and Scott.&nbsp; In the short time she had come to know him better, she could sense that Scott, even if he was unable to consciously acknowledge it, had a desire to be more for Natasha.&nbsp; Whether Natasha, the Domme, had any desire to have more from him was the question that needed to be explored.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Having anticipated that she would want to talk to Natasha soon after her manufactured meeting with Scott, Meryn had arranged to have lunch with her the following Monday.&nbsp; Concerned that sensitive topics might be discussed, and emotions might flare, she had asked for a back corner booth, away from where most of the other customers would be sitting.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�So Meri.�&nbsp; Natasha said as she sat down in the booth with a smile that seemed more like a smirk.&nbsp; �I understand that you want to be friends with my slave.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Meryn sighed.&nbsp; She had somewhat expected this.&nbsp; Scott had forewarned her.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I guess he told you about our little talk.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Of course he did.�&nbsp; She said sternly.&nbsp; �Scott has no rights of privacy or to have secrets from me.�&nbsp; Her tone now softened.&nbsp; �But you do, Meri.&nbsp; He was far more circumspect than I liked, which he paid for in Penance that night I can tell you.&nbsp; But after I assured myself that you were just trying to get to know him better, God knows why, out of respect for you I didn&#8217;t delve any more deeply.�&nbsp; She shrugged.&nbsp; �You have a right to your confidences.&nbsp; Even if they ARE with my slave.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I suppose I should thank you for that.�&nbsp; Meryn replied, regretfully aware that her actions had already caused Scott some increased pain.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No.&nbsp; Not at all Meri.�&nbsp; Natasha laughed.&nbsp; �I must admit, however, that I find your idea amusing.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t imagine how you would find it in any way worthy of your time and effort.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Why so Tash?�&nbsp; Meryn responded.&nbsp; �You and I are very good friends, and so are Jeremy and Scott.&nbsp; Why is it surprising that I would like to have that friendship shared between all of us, outside of what we do when we&#8217;re alone with our men?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Why would you think that I would want anything like that with my slave.&nbsp; Look Meri, I realize that you&#8217;re not as heavy into this as I am, and that you allow Jeremy to be something more than your possession.&nbsp; I can accept that, and interact with him as your husband on that level.&nbsp; But I have no interest in having Scott be anything more than he is.&nbsp; One who exists in my world only to cater to my every want and desire.&nbsp; With no thought to his own.&nbsp; Whose sole purpose is to see to my comfort and pleasure.&nbsp; Why would I want anything more?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What if he wants more?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That has absolutely no relevance.�&nbsp; She snorted.&nbsp; �I&#8217;ve told you before that really doesn&#8217;t matter.&nbsp; He&#8217;s free to leave any time he wants.&nbsp; That he doesn&#8217;t tells me everything I need to know.&nbsp; And allows me to amuse myself by constantly trying to push him beyond what he may think are his limits.&nbsp; What more could he possibly have to offer me than that?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�A lot more than you think,�&nbsp; Meryn responded hotly.&nbsp; �From the little I&#8217;ve already gotten to know of him, and what Jeremy has experienced as well.&nbsp; God, Tash.�&nbsp; She went on.&nbsp; �This is a man who lives with you, who works himself to the bone for you, and who cares for you very much.�&nbsp; This last brought a startled glance from Natasha.&nbsp; �And all you experience of him is a sniveling toady groveling at your feet, when you could have so much more.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�A SLAVE who lives with me.&nbsp; Not a man.�&nbsp; She shot back.&nbsp; �And I like him as a sniveling toady.&nbsp; I want him as a sniveling toady.&nbsp; That&#8217;s all he is, and I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s all he wants to be.�&nbsp; She concluded, but somewhat less convincingly.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Meryn was too upset to say anything more, and they both sat there silently for several minutes, Meryn with her fists gripped tightly, and Natasha with a speculative look on her face.&nbsp; Finally Natasha broke the impasse.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I guess it does get a little boring at times, having to always be in character, even if the character is someone I want to be.&nbsp; And I really don&#8217;t get out as much as I deserve.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe I should get to know this other Scott you seem to like, a little better.&nbsp; It may give me something new and different to exploit.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Meryn could only roll her eyes.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#8216;Okay Meri.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll make a deal with you.&nbsp; As you would like, we&#8217;ll get together as couples, do &#8216;friends&#8217; things together, and see what our ... men ...have to offer.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�And the deal?�&nbsp; Meryn asked suspiciously.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well, as my slave and I are going to be frolicking together with you and Jeremy in the vanilla world, I think it&#8217;s only fair that you two join us for some fun and games in my world.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh no Tash.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s such a good idea at all.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Natasha laughed.&nbsp; �Come on Meri.&nbsp; I&#8217;m trusting you when you assure me that my slave is not going to be too corrupted by my loosening the leash a little bit.&nbsp; In return you&#8217;ve got to trust me that nothing bad is going to happen if we have some fun tightening the leash on both of them later.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not going to be like the last time.&nbsp; That was when you were new to all of this, and I thought I had to teach you some things.&nbsp; Maybe I went a little overboard with you there.&nbsp; But you&#8217;ve found your level now.&nbsp; What you want and are comfortable with, and how you want to live.&nbsp; There&#8217;s no problem with that.&nbsp; But it&#8217;ll be good for you to gently stretch your limits in a fun, controlled way.&nbsp; And I think Jeremy will appreciate it too.&nbsp; It won&#8217;t stretch Scott or me very much, but I think I&#8217;ll enjoy playing with you two.&nbsp; And I think you&#8217;ll find it fun as well.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m still don&#8217;t think so.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Look Meri, we&#8217;ll agree on everything beforehand.&nbsp; What&#8217;s acceptable, and what&#8217;s not.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll be in charge.&nbsp; Anything you don&#8217;t want to do, we won&#8217;t do.&nbsp; The idea is to have fun together playing as Mistresses with our slaves.&nbsp; Believe it or not, they&#8217;re supposed to enjoy it as well.&nbsp; See.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not the ogre you think I am, always looking to cause my slave pain and distress.&nbsp; I frankly don&#8217;t like to do that at all, unless it&#8217;s necessary, or I&#8217;m trying to expand his boundaries.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t mind him having a little fun in a way I suspect he would like, as long as it gives me pleasure and amusement.&nbsp; Especially when it&#8217;s going to be with the &#8216;friends&#8217; with whom we&#8217;re now going to be sharing other, non lifestyle activities.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Meryn felt that she had boxed herself into a corner.&nbsp; She really did want to have a couples relationship with Natasha and Scott, and now Natasha was offering that.&nbsp; In more ways than one.&nbsp; And Natasha was being very persuasive.&nbsp; In the end, Meryn did believe that she could trust her.&nbsp; And maybe Jeremy would benefit from this as well.&nbsp; She wasn&#8217;t sure that she knew yet how to meet all of his inner needs, so perhaps this would afford her the opportunity to learn, as Natasha had said, in a safe, controlled, and even fun environment.&nbsp; But she would have the final say of what they would and wouldn&#8217;t do.&nbsp; And if she had any suspicion that things were getting out of hand, she&#8217;d put a stop to it right away.&nbsp; That was non negotiable.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Alright Tash, alright.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll go for it.&nbsp; But I want your promise that you won&#8217;t let me come to regret this.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Absolutely Meri.&nbsp; When it comes to this, you&#8217;ll be the boss.&nbsp; And I don&#8217;t think you really know how hard it is for a Domme to say that.&nbsp; To anyone.&nbsp; So go ahead and start to plan some nights on the town for us, and I&#8217;ll make sure my slave ... no, okay ... make that Scott and I will be there.&nbsp; Traveling to my world can wait a little while.�&nbsp; She laughed again.&nbsp; �This is great.&nbsp; I&#8217;m excited.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So, Meryn was surprised to admit to herself, was she.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 









1Part 5.&nbsp; Fun And Games


 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For their initial outing, Meryn had chosen for them to go to a dinner club where a Beatles tribute band, whom she had been wanting to see, was going to play.&nbsp; On Meryn&#8217;s insistence and Natasha&#8217;s acquiescence, the women agreed that in this setting the men could refer to them by their first names without any honorifics.&nbsp; Surprisingly, Jeremy appeared more uncomfortable doing this than Scott, probably because Scott knew it was what Meryn really wanted, while Jeremy understood that it was only at Natasha&#8217;s indulgence.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In all other ways, Scott was clearly the more anxious and stiff of the two.&nbsp; He was constantly looking down at his hands, then sneaking nervous glances at Natasha to see how she was reacting to all of this.&nbsp; Meryn had anticipated that this might be a problem, and she had instructed Jeremy beforehand to try to draw him out by asking him to tell one of the funny stories at which he was apparently very adept.&nbsp; Very tentative at first, the tempo seeming slightly off, Scott was able to elicit a chuckle at one point from Natasha, after which he seemed to relax, get more into the flow, and soon had them all laughing, almost hysterically at times, as he went on.&nbsp; When he finished, the tension which had seemed palpable before he had started, was now completely dispersed, and they all had an enjoyable dinner, each of them taking a turn trading anecdotes.&nbsp; Meryn was pleased to note that when Scott was speaking, Natasha would watch him intently with a small smile, and never sought to interrupt him.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Being the classic rock afficionado in the group, Meryn thoroughly enjoyed the Beatles band that followed, and Natasha agreed that she also thought that they had been fantastic.&nbsp; The two men just seemed immensely pleased that the women had had such a good time.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Their next foray out together occurred soon after.&nbsp; They attended a performance of �A Midsummer&#8217;s Night Dream� at the Shakespeare in the Park festival .&nbsp; During the gourmet picnic dinner that followed, which Jeremy had prepared, both Meryn and Natasha commented that while they usually didn&#8217;t care for Shakespeare very much, this particular company had hammed up the comedy so much that they had been very entertained.&nbsp; Then they listened, totally absorbed, as Jeremy and Scott debated the relative merits of Shakespeare&#8217;s comedies versus his tragedies, and which plays they each felt were overrated, and which they believed were underappreciated.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Over the next several months, they went out together on a number of more occasions, and each time they all seemed to become more comfortable with each other, and the situation, particularly the men.&nbsp; Meryn had to admit that Natasha was certainly keeping up her end of the bargain.&nbsp; It came as no surprise then when Natasha, during one of their luncheon dates, finally indicated that she felt the time had come for her turn to host a get together.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She proposed that they spend a weekend at a summer house that Scott owned on a private lake several hours outside of the city.&nbsp; While Jeremy had indicated to Meryn in the past that Scott was a successful businessman, she now learned that his software company had made him tremendously wealthy.&nbsp; Besides his summer house, which, it turned out was on twenty secluded acres on a private inlet of a ten mile long lake, he also owned a very large house as his primary residence in the suburbs.&nbsp; When Meryn asked Natasha, somewhat incredulously, why they were still living in her two bedroom apartment, Natasha had become slightly indignant.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Because it&#8217;s my domain.�&nbsp; She snapped.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m not a gold digger, Meri.&nbsp; I possess Scott body and mind.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not interested in his money.�&nbsp; She then got a sly smile.&nbsp; �Of course, I&#8217;m not above being indulged with gifts as tribute, or partaking of the fruits of his outside labors now and then.&nbsp; But outside of my domain, what&#8217;s his is his.&nbsp; Inside, it all is mine.&nbsp; Including him�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The weekend, as envisioned by Natasha, would have them arriving on Friday evening, and spending that night settling in.&nbsp; The parameters that Meryn established, and to which Natasha agreed, were, first, that although the slaves would be in service to both Mistresses at all times, their primary obedience would always be to their own.&nbsp; There would be no public sexual activity, and any that occurred in private would most certainly be only with their own.&nbsp; Finally, any bondage or discipline would have to be consensual, and not corporeal in nature, and subject to cessation on her word at any time.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Natasha had nodded wearily when agreeing to all of these rules.&nbsp; She understood that she was going to have to tread lightly with Meri if this was going to work.&nbsp; The weekend might not push her own buttons very much, but if she wanted to have future adventures with them, and she truly did, she would have to go slow, at least in the beginning.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For her part, Meryn was still not completely confident that she had covered all the bases.&nbsp; She had discussed everything with Jeremy to make sure that he was okay with it all.&nbsp; They developed signals they could pass between themselves in case either found something unacceptable, at which point she could put an end to it.&nbsp; She extracted a promise from him that he wouldn&#8217;t do anything he didn&#8217;t want to do, or allow anything to be done to him just because he thought she might like it, or that it might embarrass her if he didn&#8217;t.&nbsp; They did agree that they would try to go with the flow as much as possible.&nbsp; They didn&#8217;t want to seem like total prudes.&nbsp; This was an experiment after all, and they would try to keep up their end of the deal that Meryn had made.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The plan for the rest of the weekend after their arrival on Friday, would be that each Domme would develop a scenario that would be followed by them all for an entire day.&nbsp; Natasha would have Saturday, and Meryn would have Sunday.&nbsp; These also had been vetted by Meryn ahead of time, and cleared again by her with Jeremy in private.&nbsp; While neither of them were particularly enthused by Natasha&#8217;s scenario, he was much more excited about Meryn&#8217;s, they agreed to go ahead with it.&nbsp; It could have been worse, and they couldn&#8217;t say no to everything.&nbsp; She felt better about it when she had gotten his acceptance.&nbsp; She strongly doubted that Natasha had extended the same courtesy, as he would put it, to Scott.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When they arrived on Friday evening at his almost palatial summer house, they were greeted at the door by the, not unexpectedly, sparsely dressed Scott.&nbsp; He wore only bright chartreuse satin panties.&nbsp; He had a big smile on his face as he offered a heartfelt and robust, �Welcome Miss Meri.� before falling to his knees to kiss her shoes.&nbsp; Natasha, who had been standing behind him, was shocked by the seeming informality.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Scott.&nbsp; What kind of greeting was that?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Exactly the one I&#8217;ve asked of him, Tash.�&nbsp; Meryn answered for him, smiling.&nbsp; �And hello to both of you too.�&nbsp; She continued as she went forward to hug and kiss Natasha, and pat Scott on the head as he rose upright on his knees.&nbsp; Jeremy, who knew what was expected, then entered, stripped to his&nbsp; black briefs, dropped to his knees to kiss Natasha&#8217;s sandal-clad feet, and offered as he did so.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good evening Miss Natasha.&nbsp; Thank you so very much for granting me the honor and privilege of coming to serve you this weekend.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Now that&#8217;s more like it.�&nbsp; She responded, seemingly placated.&nbsp; �Come in, come in Meri, so I can show you the house, while the slaves bring in your luggage and get you settled.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It truly was a magnificent house, with a huge cleared and manicured lakefront area and several wide paths leading out and through the woods that surrounded it.&nbsp; There were four bedrooms, two with private baths to go along with the other two common bathrooms, an enormous kitchen, a dining area, a den and playroom, and a fabulous living room that opened up through sliding glass doors onto a large covered porch that faced the lake.&nbsp; Meryn was beyond impressed.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After the tour, Natasha indicated that Scott had dinner ready for them all.&nbsp; Meryn was very pleased to note upon entering the dining room that there were four table settings, in obvious deference to her known wishes in the matter.&nbsp; Though they would be allowed to sit and eat with them, however, the slaves certainly weren&#8217;t excused from service to their Mistresses.&nbsp; They made sure their plates were full, before sitting down to their own, and hopped up frequently throughout the dinner to provided seconds, refill wine and water glasses, or anything else that their owners required.&nbsp; They were otherwise ignored as Natasha and Meryn carried on a lively conversation.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I hope you&#8217;ve found this dinner more acceptable than the ones my slave has prepared in the past, Meri.�&nbsp; Natasha inquired as they were finishing the main course.&nbsp; �I do think he&#8217;s gotten better at this, thanks ever so much to you.&nbsp; And your slave of course.�&nbsp; She added.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In truth the dinner had been excellent, and she made sure to tell Natasha so in glowing terms, congratulating her profusely on it, an obvious bow on her part to Natasha&#8217;s sensibilities on such things.&nbsp; She couldn&#8217;t help but notice though, the grin that creased Scott&#8217;s face as she did so.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After they had cleared the dinner plates from the table, Scott brought out his specially prepared dessert, which Jeremy had obviously taught him how to make.&nbsp; It was Meryn&#8217;s favorite, and one to which she had become practically addicted.&nbsp; A homemade strawberry-rhubarb tart.&nbsp; She had to confess that it was almost as good as Jeremy&#8217;s, although she exaggerated a bit by telling Natasha that it was better, as she congratulated her on it as well, giving a little unobserved wink to Jeremy as she did so.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Why don&#8217;t we relax in the living room Meri, as the slaves clean up.�&nbsp; Natasha proposed as Meryn finished wolfing down her second tart.&nbsp; �They&#8217;re going to have to spend some time tonight preparing all of our meals in advance for tomorrow.&nbsp; I&#8217;m afraid we&#8217;re going to have to fend for ourselves, service wise for the day.�&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Meryn understood the reference.&nbsp; In Natasha&#8217;s next day scenario, from the time they woke up in the morning, through the entire day, the slaves would not be slaves.&nbsp; They would be pets.&nbsp; More specifically, pet puppies, who would spend the day being trained to do tricks, and entertaining their Dommes.&nbsp; They would remain on all fours, not be allowed to speak, only bark, and had been instructed that they were expected to get into their roles and come up with a variety of puppy things to do.&nbsp; Meryn wasn&#8217;t sure how this was all going to play out, but as she went to bed for the night, she promised herself that she would try hard to get into the spirit of the thing.&nbsp; And she knew that her man, lying next to her, would do his best to play his role as well.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When she awoke the next morning, Jeremy was already gone.&nbsp; She got up, took a leisurely shower in their private bath, and took her time getting ready, dressing in shorts, a pullover top, and sandals.&nbsp; As she left the bedroom, she found Jeremy curled up on the floor at the side of the door.&nbsp; Natasha had him dressed only with a studded collar and fur covered panties with a bushy tail attached.&nbsp; She had reluctantly concluded that total nudity with a butt-plug tail would be a leap too long for Meryn at this point.&nbsp; Seeing&nbsp; his Mistress, he scrambled up onto all fours, went �ruff ruff� with a big smile on his face, and started wagging his behind, the bushy tail wildly swinging to and fro.&nbsp; Meryn laughed as she petted him on the head, and he licked her fingers.&nbsp; If her puppy could get into it so quickly, so could she.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Meri, you&#8217;re up.&nbsp; Good.�&nbsp; Natasha called from the kitchen.&nbsp; �I&#8217;ve set up some breakfast.&nbsp; Come on in.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Meryn proceeded into the large eat-in kitchen with Jeremy padding on his hands and knees after her.&nbsp; She found Natasha sitting at the kitchen table with Scott, similarly clad, kneeling up with his arms bent upright in front of him and bent forward at the wrists.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That&#8217;s right, beg for a goodie.&nbsp; Good puppy.�&nbsp; She crooned to him as he whimpered in front of her as she held a piece of donut above him.&nbsp; When he craned his neck forward and snapped the donut from her fingers with his mouth, she lightly boxed him on the nose with a rolled up newspaper.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No.&nbsp; Bad doggie.&nbsp; You wait for me to give it to you.&nbsp; Bad dog.� smacking him softly again.&nbsp; She looked to Meryn in seeming exasperation. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; �It looks like we&#8217;ve got our work cut out for us today Meri.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Meryn could only laugh again and nod.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�So what should we name our puppies Meri.�&nbsp; She went on.&nbsp; �I think I&#8217;ll keep mine simple, for a simple mind so he won&#8217;t be confused, and call him Scottie.&nbsp; What about you?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Meryn hadn&#8217;t given it any thought, but she had a sudden inspiration.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Lovemuffin.�&nbsp; She said.&nbsp; �I&#8217;ll name him Lovemuffin.&nbsp; But I&#8217;ll call him Muffy for short.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh, that&#8217;s so adorable.&nbsp; I love it.�&nbsp; Natasha actually giggled.&nbsp; �Muffy it is then.� as Muffy continued to smile broadly and wiggle his behind.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Dommes spent the better part of the day playing with, and training their pets.&nbsp; Meryn noted with approval that Natasha had allowed them to wear knee pads, as they would be on all fours all day, a contingency she herself had not thought of.&nbsp; They walked the puppies on leashes and choke collars in the back yard, Natasha taking the lead in training them to heel, sit, and roll over.&nbsp; Meryn found it perversely delightful when they took the leashes off, and had them play fetch, throwing a large rawhide bone for them to retrieve.&nbsp; It became particularly enjoyable when they made a game of it, throwing the bone as far away as they could, and having the puppies race each other to get it first, the winner returning it to his own Mistress, who would reward him with a treat.&nbsp; When Muffy won, Meryn would plop the treat directly onto his offered tongue.&nbsp; Scottie, being more athletic, won more often, but Natasha would frequently flip the treat onto the ground, and laugh even harder as he would scramble to pick it up with his mouth.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was one activity that did meet with Meryn&#8217;s disapproval, when Scottie began to whine in front of Natasha when they were all in the living room later in the day.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh, does puppy have to go?�&nbsp; Natasha asked.&nbsp; �Come on, outside with you then.� and she opened the sliding door.&nbsp; Scottie, redfaced, reluctantly crawled outside, made his way to the nearest tree, used a paw to partially pull down his panties, and then lifted his leg and did his business, while Natasha laughed uproariously.&nbsp; Meryn, frowning, looked to Muffy, who nodded gratefully when she used one of their prearranged signals to indicate that this was not to be repeated by him.&nbsp; When it became necessary, he discreetly used the human facilities in their bedroom.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For dinner, the two Mistresses served themselves a cold poached salmon with dill sauce, accompanied by a vegetable pate that Jeremy, assisted by Scott, had prepared for them the night before.&nbsp; Then it was time for the puppies one meal of the day.&nbsp; Natasha had privately assured Meryn that what she had prepared for them was actually ground beef in a gravy, but it certainly had the appearance of dog food, which was the intended effect.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Okay puppies, it&#8217;s time for your kibble� she said as she spooned a large amount into each of the two dog dishes, which she then placed onto the floor.&nbsp; �Be good doggies and eat it all up now.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Which they did, having had nothing to eat all day except the treats that had been offered as rewards for their tricks.&nbsp; Not wanting to incur any displeasure, they both made sure to completely lick their bowls clean, much to Natasha&#8217;s satisfaction, although Meryn seemed far less pleased with the entire scene.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The rest of the night passed pleasantly.&nbsp; As they had done all day, the Dommes left all of the dirty dishes in the sink, or left them on the table.&nbsp; The dogs would be slaves again in the morning, Natasha had said, and would take care of them.&nbsp; They sat down in the living room to watch a DVD of a recent popular movie which the critics had described as an old fashioned five handkerchief&nbsp; weeper.&nbsp; As they watched, their pets lay in front of them, Scottie curled up at Natasha&#8217;s feet as she unconsciously ran her bare toes through his hair, while munching her popcorn, sipping her drink, and occasionally letting escape a sigh over the events on the screen.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Meryn was not quite as affected by the movie, thinking it overdone, but she enjoyed it nonetheless, particularly as her puppy knelt in front of her, and rested his head on her thighs like a lap dog as she stroked and petted him contentedly throughout the film.&nbsp; When it ended, she exaggerated a yawn, wished her hostess a goodnight, and retired to her bedroom with her pet crawling in behind her.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That was certainly an interesting day.�&nbsp; She sighed as she closed the bedroom door behind him, and sat down on the side of the bed.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Woof.�&nbsp; He responded, wagging his tail vigorously one last time.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She laughed.&nbsp; �Well, as I&#8217;m not particularly into bestiality,� she observed as she kicked off her sandals, and slipped off her shorts and panties.&nbsp; �I think my little Lovemuffin better transform himself into my little boytoy pretty quickly, or his Mistress is going to become very frustrated.&nbsp; And,� she added pointedly, �very disappointed.� 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He did.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And she wasn&#8217;t.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The next morning found Meryn unexpectedly excited.&nbsp; As before, Jeremy had already arisen and left, in preparation no doubt for her day.&nbsp; For her scenario, Meryn envisioned that she and Natasha would be Babylonian princesses ensconced at their summer palace, protected from without by unseen armed honor guards, but attended within only by their two eunuch-slaves.&nbsp; While she had sketched out this broad outline, she had left it to Jeremy and Scott to fill in the particulars, believing that they would do a far better job than she.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After finishing her shower and morning duties, and dressed in a simple white pullover summer dress tied at the waist, she departed her boudoir and came upon the two eunuchs in the kitchen.&nbsp; They both immediately fell to their knees, touched their foreheads to the ground, and then arose.&nbsp; She noted that they were both attired only in a simple loin cloth, sandals, a golden yellow collar, and each had a single, large, gold clip-on hoop earing dangling from one ear.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good morning Your Highness.�&nbsp; Jeremy intoned formally.&nbsp; �My sincerest hope is that you slept well last night.�&nbsp; With many thanks to you she thought, as she then nodded haughtily.&nbsp; �Your morning meal has been prepared and is awaiting, if I may attend you.�&nbsp; He then led her to the dining room, the kitchen table being out of the question for royalty.&nbsp; He bowed as he pulled her chair for her as she settled in it.&nbsp; She was joined moments later by Natasha, who was accorded similar treatment by her eunuch.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well, this is a most appropriate start to our day.�&nbsp; Natasha said as she sampled the splendid array of fruits, nuts and cheeses, along with juices and porcelain cups of steaming coffee that was set up before them.&nbsp; Meryn could only agree as they ate, and speculated about what further enjoyments their slaves had planned for them the rest of the day.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After they had cleared and cleaned up after the morning repast, the eunuchs reminded their Highnesses of their expressed desire for an&nbsp; excursion, and afternoon meal at the beach, and the Princesses then commanded them to prepare for it.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; This got off to a hilarious start when the eunuchs discovered how difficult it was to peel grapes, which they had intended to feed their owners as they lounged by the lake.&nbsp; When this small fiasco was finally resolved, the Exalted Ones&#8217; presence was humbly requested outside by Jeremy, where they were greeted by the sight of a two seated rickshaw, which was to be their conveyance to their planned sojourn.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon seeing them, Scott, who had been kneeling at the side of the rickshaw, immediately lay down on his belly in front of the seats.&nbsp; Meryn was initially confused by this, but Natasha confidently walked over, and stepped on the slave&#8217;s back to get up and onto the seat.&nbsp; After a moment&#8217;s hesitation, Meryn followed suit.&nbsp; Scott then arose, and positioned himself in front of the rickshaw, each of his arms and hands placed on the long arm of the carriage in anticipation of beginning their journey.&nbsp; After attaching one end of a six foot chain to the back of the carriage, and the other end to a D-ring on his collar, Jeremy picked up a large cooler filled with supplies and foodstuffs, and indicated to his fellow slave that they were ready to proceed.&nbsp; Natasha then pulled out a buggy whip that was attached to her side of the rickshaw, flicked Scott&#8217;s hindquarters with it, and ordered, �Away.�&nbsp; And the procession began.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was about a quarter mile trek and ride on a path through the woods until they came to another open area in front of the lake, this one with a small, sandy beach, a long dock at the far end with two rowboats currently lashed to it.&nbsp; Beyond that, there was a large boathouse with an attached cabana.&nbsp; In the middle of the clearing two reclining lounge chairs were set up, and it was behind these that Scott brought the rickshaw to a stop.&nbsp; He then lay down again in front of them to allow the two Princesses to step off and walk the few steps to the chairs into which they sat down and lay back while the slaves unpacked.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After providing cold drinks and canapes to their Mistresses, the slaves then picked up two bamboo poles with large rushes attached.&nbsp; Taking positions to the back and side of their respective Princess, they gently began to fan them as they lounged, sipped their drinks, and conversed&nbsp; between themselves, watching the lake sparkle in the sunlight.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was a particularly hot summer day, and after about an hour, Natasha declared that she would like to go in for a swim.&nbsp; Meryn lamented that she hadn&#8217;t brought her bathing suit.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Natasha laughed.&nbsp; �Meri.&nbsp; Believe me.&nbsp; There&#8217;s nobody around for miles.&nbsp; And these two are eunuchs after all.�&nbsp; With that she slipped off her summer shift, revealing only her lovely nude body underneath, and waded into the water.&nbsp; After some momentary trepidation of baring herself to Scott, Meryn did the same, and followed her in.&nbsp; For the next half hour they swam, splashed each other, laughed and giggled and cooled off in the refreshing lake water.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon emerging they were met on the shore by the slaves, who had awaited their Princesses on their knees the entire time, and who now dried them off with towels.&nbsp; Meryn then expressed a desire to sunbathe, and each eunuch applied a liberal amount of sun block to his own Mistress.&nbsp; This evolved in a prolonged body massage before they again took up their stations with their fans behind the lounge chairs, as the two Highnesses&nbsp; basked in the sun&#8217;s warming rays.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After an enjoyable and restful interlude, they were redressed by their slaves, who then hand fed them their lunch, including the aborted attempt at peeled grapes.&nbsp; Natasha then suggested that they go out onto the lake in the rowboats.&nbsp; Each Mistress got into one with her own slave manning the oars, and rowed out a fair distance before stopping, and letting the waves gently rock the boats, and the lake breezes cool them.&nbsp; They enjoyed this for a very peaceful period of time before Natasha proposed a race back to the dock.&nbsp; Meryn readily agreed, and the race was on, each Mistress urging, screaming, and laughingly cajoling their slave onto better efforts.&nbsp; Somewhat surprisingly, Jeremy won.&nbsp; Natasha seemed none too pleased, but she graciously congratulated Meryn on her victory, who wondered whether Scott might experience some extra Penance in the future for his loss.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Securing the boats, the slaves then gathered everything together for the journey home.&nbsp; For the return trip, Jeremy served as the step stool and beast of burden, with Scott tethered by the neck to the back of the rickshaw, carrying the equipment.&nbsp; Arriving back, the two Princesses showered, changed and freshened up for the evening as the slaves prepared dinner.&nbsp; After serving their Highnesses a sumptuous feast, they cleaned up, and then presented the final entertainment of the night.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They acted out a play that Jeremy had written, with Jeremy playing the roles of narrator and Princess in distress.&nbsp; Scott played the duel roles of evil Sultan and the dashing Prince who rescues the Princess from the Sultan&#8217;s evil clutches.&nbsp; By the time the play finished, Natasha and Meryn&#8217;s sides ached from laughing so much.&nbsp; And something else ached even more.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I think it&#8217;s time for this Princess to get her beauty rest.�&nbsp; Meryn announced when she had composed herself.&nbsp; She got up, looked to Jeremy, and simply said&nbsp;&nbsp; �Attend me.�&nbsp; She then bid Natasha a very good night, and retired to her room with her slave following close behind.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She sighed contentedly as she flopped back onto the bed.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Jeremy, your play was hilarious.�&nbsp; She said to him as he closed the door.&nbsp; �And I can&#8217;t thank you enough for how wonderful you made my scenario.&nbsp; And my day.&nbsp; And my weekend.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Am I still a eunuch?� he inquired.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Ah.�&nbsp; She answered slyly as she sat up.&nbsp; �As it is my scenario, I believe I should be allowed to create the epilog.�&nbsp; She thought for a long moment.&nbsp; �It just so happens that years earlier, when the fairer Princess was asked to select&nbsp; which of the slaves would be made into the eunuchs that would become her personal guard, she took a fancy to one, and secretly had him spared the gelding.&nbsp; Unbeknownst to the Sultan, when he sent them away to their summer retreat, it was this false eunuch that she chose to personally attend her.&nbsp; Now the only mystery that remains in the story is whether the fair Princess made a mistake in saving the slave his ... no, make that, HER jewels.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jeremy spent the rest of the night proving to her that she hadn&#8217;t.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Driving home the next morning, Meryn reflected on how surprisingly well the weekend had gone.&nbsp; Natasha had been on her best behavior, and had tried very hard to make her hosted event a success.&nbsp; Far more important to her though, Meryn, seeing how much Jeremy had seemed to enjoy the events of the weekend, now felt that she better understood a number of the needs within him that would require massaging now and then.&nbsp; She firmly promised herself that she would do so, both at home, and in future sessions of &#8216;Fun and Games&#8217; which Natasha had proposed when they were leaving. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Receiving an imperceptible nod from Jeremy, Meryn had enthusiastically accepted .

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;









 










1Part 6.&nbsp; The Plan


 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Over the next six months the two couples did get together a number of times, including another three day weekend of &#8216;Fun and Games&#8217; at the lake.&nbsp; For that one, the two Mistresses jointly created a scenario of a two day Slave Olympics, with their slaves facing off in five different events of competitive subservience on each of the days.&nbsp; Both of the slaves had their individual triumphs.&nbsp; Jeremy&#8217;s signature one came in the pedicure contest, which was judged on speed of completion combined with accuracy of application.&nbsp; The final championship, however, was won by Scott.&nbsp; He did this in dramatic fashion by winning the last event of the two days.&nbsp; The Dommes had created an obstacle course in the back yard through which the slaves, their hands bound above and in front of their heads, raced on their bellies through the course to retrieve a pair of their owner&#8217;s panties at one end of the course, returning with it in their teeth through the course again to place it at their owner&#8217;s feet at the other end.&nbsp; Natasha was absolutely delighted with her ultimate victory.&nbsp; Meryn, and she believed Jeremy as well, was not upset with the loss, suspecting that it would save Scott some pain in Penance down the line.&nbsp; Instead, as a reward to her slave, Natasha announced that when they retired to their room for the evening, she planned on releasing him for some play time from the plastic cage in which he was usually encased.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Because of their hectic work schedules, particularly Meryn&#8217;s, all of their other get togethers were of what Natasha called the vanilla variety.&nbsp; They went out to dinners, concerts, shows, even bike riding in the park, and they generally all had an excellent and enjoyable time together.&nbsp; As she got to know him better, Meryn found that Scott was quite a raconteur, but more importantly, as Jeremy had indicated, he was really a nice, funny and endearing person, of whom she had genuinely become very fond, and now considered a dear friend.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The only discordant notes during these times together, were the seemingly random episodes of humiliation and cruelty Natasha would occasionally inflict upon him.&nbsp; It was as if, despite the good time they would be having, she always wanted him to be aware of who and what he was.&nbsp; This never appeared to bother Scott.&nbsp; Indeed, Meryn would often observe him gazing intently at Natasha when she was talking and not paying attention to him.&nbsp; At first, Meryn thought that he did this because it was not something he would be allowed to do in private.&nbsp; She soon came to realize however, with a certainty she couldn&#8217;t explain, that he was a man besotted, and not just with the lifestyle.&nbsp; She wondered if Natasha knew, and if she did, whether she even cared.&nbsp; Meryn resolved that the next time she got together alone with her, she would discreetly feel her out about it.&nbsp; She would make every effort to do so in a way that wouldn&#8217;t compromise Scott, and possibly give Natasha, as she would put it, something new to exploit.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was presented with such an opportunity a week later, when, on a Saturday morning, Natasha had called and invited her over to her place for lunch.&nbsp; Scott had been given permission to attend to some business at his company for the day, and Saturday was Jeremy&#8217;s major household cleaning and laundry day, and she would just be in the way, so Meryn jumped at the invitation.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�So Meri, I understand congratulations are in order.�&nbsp; Natasha said as they sat down to the lunch that Scott had prepared and set up for them before he left for work, and which he would clean up when he returned.&nbsp; Such was the life of a slave.&nbsp; �Record profits for the quarter.&nbsp; Your project is keeping the entire company afloat.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This latter statement wasn&#8217;t precisely true of course, but the second phase of her project was already doing better than the tremendous success of the first, as the hefty bonus she had just received amply reflected.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Thanks Tash.&nbsp; I appreciate that.&nbsp; My group has done very well so far.&nbsp; But I think my success pales to that of Scott&#8217;s.�&nbsp; As she had come to know him better, and they had talked shop at times, she had come to find out just how spectacularly successful his software company was.&nbsp; She had estimated that he and it were worth well into the eight figures.&nbsp; �You must be very proud of him.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What he does outside of the lifestyle is of very little interest to me, except to how it might add to my comfort.�&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha replied.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well, you&#8217;ve got to admit he&#8217;s quite an accomplished and successful person. And a heck of a nice guy to boot.�&nbsp; Meryn prodded.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes, I&#8217;ve noticed you&#8217;ve become somewhat enamored of him.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll be happy to lend him to you for a day if you&#8217;d like to have some private fun with he and Jeremy.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh come on Tash.&nbsp; You know that&#8217;s not what I mean.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve come to consider Scott a very close friend.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That&#8217;s what I was afraid of when we started all this.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You can&#8217;t possibly mean that.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Of course I do.�&nbsp; Natasha retorted.&nbsp; �Look Meri, I&#8217;ll grant you that you&#8217;ve caused me to see a different and sometimes more interesting Scott from the one whom I generally experience.&nbsp; All that has really done, though, is give me the added excitement of knowing that besides being a hunk, he is a very accomplished and successful person whom everyone else desires to be, but, at the end of the day, all HE truly desires in his life is to kneel before ME and place himself in my hands.&nbsp; Like a lump of clay to be made into anything I wish and want.&nbsp; That, more than the service and pleasure he provides me every day, is what gives me my greatest thrill.&nbsp; That I can mold him, twist him, push his limits in ways he couldn&#8217;t ever imagine, with no thought of how he might feel about it, as long as it provides me with enjoyment and entertainment.&nbsp; I have no interest in him in any other way.&nbsp; Certainly not as a friend.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure he doesn&#8217;t want that either.&nbsp; Not that it matters.&nbsp; That&#8217;s not what he&#8217;s in this for.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; She paused for a moment.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�But you are a friend Meri, and very important to me.&nbsp; If you need him as something more, as a friend if you want, I will of course allow it.&nbsp; For you.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Are you so sure about all of this, Tash?�&nbsp; Meryn asked, not fully believing.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Why shouldn&#8217;t I be?&nbsp; Scott has given his existence to me to do with what I will.&nbsp; He has no other purpose to me but to use him as I wish.&nbsp; And I do push his limits, believe me.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�How so?�&nbsp; Meryn was almost forced to ask.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Ah, Meri.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve never shown any interest before in knowing the degree to which I&#8217;ve developed my dominance.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve respected that because I know you&#8217;re happy and satisfied with your level.&nbsp; And I&#8217;ve enjoyed playing with you and Jeremy at the fringes of the lifestyle where you live, because you&#8217;re my closest friend.&nbsp; But if you really want to know, I&#8217;d be very happy.&nbsp; It would be exciting and fun sharing ideas and experiences with someone else, someone I&#8217;m close to and trust.&nbsp; Particularly now.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Why so?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Natasha was silent for several long moments, then plunged ahead, eyes glittering.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;ve been contemplating taking Scott, and myself, to an entirely new level.&nbsp; Expanding both of our boundaries way beyond where we&#8217;ve been.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve been hinting about it to him for a while now, and I can see he&#8217;s terrified at the prospect, which makes it all the more delectable.&nbsp; And I&#8217;ve now finally decided the time has come.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What are you talking about Tash?�&nbsp; Meryn asked, a feeling of dread filling her.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You know that I have Scott satisfy and pleasure me in every way I demand.�&nbsp; Natasha rushed on.&nbsp; �And he does, and it&#8217;s been grand.&nbsp; But I miss fucking, Meri.&nbsp; It&#8217;s been over two years.&nbsp; A Domme shouldn&#8217;t deny herself that long.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�So why would Scott be terrified of that?&nbsp; I would think it would be something he would greatly look forward to.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Please.�&nbsp; Natasha sneered.&nbsp; �How many times do I have to tell you.&nbsp; You don&#8217;t fuck your slave.&nbsp; I&#8217;m going to have to find someone else for that particular pleasure.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Meryn was appalled.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�But that&#8217;s going to devastate Scott if he finds out.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Of course he&#8217;s going to find out.�&nbsp; Natasha laughed.&nbsp; �He&#8217;s going to be kneeling right there by my bedside, watching me in all my glory, as I&#8217;m pleasured in a way that he will never be able to provide.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what&#8217;s going to make it so much more special.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Meryn stood up abruptly.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Natasha !&nbsp; That&#8217;s monstrous ! ...&nbsp;&nbsp; Don&#8217;t do it ! ... Natasha, I mean it ! ... that will destroy him !�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh, I have no doubt it will be excruciating for him, but that&#8217;s what makes it so exciting.&nbsp; For both of us.&nbsp; It will further fill that inner need he has, and I know deep down he&#8217;ll love every minute of it.&nbsp; Knowing, finally, that he is my slave in every imaginable way.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�HE WON&#8217;T.�&nbsp; Meryn cried.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m absolutely sure he won&#8217;t love that.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�How can you be so sure?�&nbsp; Natasha snorted.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�BECAUSE HE LOVES YOU.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Natasha flinched.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Natasha.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t do this.�&nbsp; Meryn continued, almost pleading.&nbsp; �If you do, then yes, maybe Scott will stay on as your slave, but only as that.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll lose him, and everything else he has to offer.&nbsp; Forever.&nbsp; And he has so much more he wants to give, to be for you.&nbsp; And you&#8217;re going to throw it all away. Don&#8217;t do it Natasha.&nbsp; I&#8217;m begging you.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Meryn sat back down, stone faced.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�If you do, Scott won&#8217;t be the only person you lose.�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They stared at each other silently for over a minute.&nbsp; Finally, quietly, Natasha responded.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I think you&#8217;re all wrong about this, Meri.&nbsp; About all of it.&nbsp; I really do.� 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; More silence.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�But because I respect you so much, I will consider what you&#8217;ve said.�&nbsp; A truly evil thought then entered her mind.&nbsp; And she let it develop and simmer in deathly quiet before proceeding.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�If you truly want me to consider changing my plans, you have to do something for me.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What Tash?�&nbsp; Meryn replied with equal degrees of wary relief and suspicion.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Natasha smiled benignly.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;d like you to lend Jeremy to me for an evening.&nbsp; Next Saturday would be about right.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You can&#8217;t be serious !�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Natasha&#8217;s smile turned into a grin.&nbsp; �But I am.&nbsp; If you want me to consider your plea for Scott, you&#8217;ll lend me your slave.�&nbsp; She laughed.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m not going to abuse him, Meri.&nbsp; If I know Jeremy, he&#8217;s going to enjoy what I&#8217;m going to ask of him.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�And just what might that be?�&nbsp; Meryn demanded.


 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No, Meri.&nbsp; That&#8217;s going to have to be my little secret.&nbsp; To make this work out the way I want it, you&#8217;re going to have to trust me.&nbsp; If you really 
care about Scott&#8217;s presumed well being so much, you just have your slave 
report to me next Saturday evening, and tell him to do whatever I ask of him.&nbsp; You do have that much control over him, don&#8217;t you?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Meryn bristled.&nbsp; Every instinct in her body screamed for her to say no.&nbsp; Her first, and most important priority was the care of her own.&nbsp; Jeremy.&nbsp; But she had come to care very much for Scott, and she knew that Natasha&#8217;s plan would damage him irreparably.&nbsp; And she knew that Jeremy, given the choice, would do anything he could to help his friend.&nbsp; Finally, she didn&#8217;t really think that Natasha would ever betray her.&nbsp; Would jeopardize everything they had together.&nbsp; She worked up a deep breath, sighed, and then stared at Natasha as she said.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Okay Natasha.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll do it your way.&nbsp; Jeremy will be here next Saturday.&nbsp; This better not be a mistake.&nbsp; On either of our parts.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Great Meri.&nbsp; This will work out just fine.&nbsp; I really believe both slaves are going to enjoy what I have planned.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She grinned wickedly as she then thought to herself: And I&#8217;m going to find out if you&#8217;re right, Meri, while you&#8217;re going to learn what it means to be a true Domme. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;









1Part 7.&nbsp; The Breaking Point


 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For the next several days, Natasha struggled with her decision to proceed with her plan.&nbsp; Her conversation with Meryn had strongly affected her.&nbsp; She valued Meryn&#8217;s friendship greatly.&nbsp; She had been quite happy that Meryn had engineered the friendship that had developed between the couples, even in the vanilla world.&nbsp; Indeed, as Meryn had predicted, she found that she enjoyed the different Scott she encountered there, and had come to immensely appreciate the fascinating aspects of him she had discovered.&nbsp; They helped make her relationship with him in her private domain even more intense, and led her to realize how much more from him she wanted.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was also glad that Meryn had agreed to venture more into her world, even if it was just below the surface from where Meryn normally lived.&nbsp; Even though Natasha wasn&#8217;t challenged by these forays, she found that she was more comfortable doing things with Meryn.&nbsp; She was becoming increasingly annoyed, and occasionally even a little intimidated by some of the more serious lifestyle Dommes with whom she had come to know and associate.&nbsp; All too often many of them became far too competitive about their dominance.&nbsp; This was not an issue with Meryn.&nbsp; There was never any question with her of who between them was more dominant.&nbsp; Despite this, Meryn never seemed to need to prove anything to anyone, and Natasha respected her all the more for that.&nbsp; She also realized that she greatly wished for Meryn&#8217;s respect in return.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But Natasha had become obsessed with finding out if Meryn was right in what she had said.&nbsp; By mid week she was sure of her decision to proceed, and once made, she was filled with an almost giddy excitement and euphoria for the rest of the week.&nbsp; She informed Scott that Saturday would be a most special evening, as she would be entertaining a male guest, and she expected his preparation and participation to be perfect.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As he sensed her nervous anticipation, Scott realized that this was the event that his Mistress had been hinting about for some time, and of which he had been living in dread.&nbsp; He accepted, and had even chosen his role in her life.&nbsp; He was forever grateful, however, that Meryn and Jeremy had created the opportunity for her to see him in a different light.&nbsp; He had long wished for her to discover how much more he had to offer her.&nbsp; Not the successful entrepreneur, but the real person within him.&nbsp; And she had appeared to enjoy and appreciate that person.&nbsp; He was also thankful that he was able, at times, to experience a different Natasha as well, a caring, carefree, happy-go-lucky, vibrant young woman.&nbsp; The fact that she was not ONLY the stern taskmistress, who kept him firmly underfoot, a place he did long to be as long as it was under her foot, served to entrance him all the more.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But this was all threatened to be rendered meaningless by the action his Mistress was planning.&nbsp; He understood that stretching his limits and expanding his boundaries was part of the dynamic that fueled their relationship, and made it continually enticing for her.&nbsp; He just didn&#8217;t know if this was a boundary he could traverse safely without breaking.&nbsp; Early on in their relationship, he would have felt that his Mistress had every right to do what she was now apparently planning.&nbsp; Since that time, however, she had come to mean so much more to him.&nbsp; And, he hazarded a desperate hope, he also might be so to her.&nbsp; While he believed that she still had that right, he felt that if she proceeded with her plan, something vital and important inside him would be crushed.&nbsp; Perhaps forever.&nbsp; He would remain her slave, but that would be all he would, or could ever be.&nbsp; Maybe that was all she would ever want of him. And it would be all he would ever be able to give.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As he awoke early Saturday morning, he arose from the palette on which he always slept at the foot of his owner&#8217;s bed. .&nbsp; He quietly left the bedroom so as not to rouse her, showered and shaved in the extra bathroom, put on a fresh pair of panties, and then proceeded to prepare her breakfast.&nbsp; Checking the clock until the precise time that he was instructed, he reentered the bedroom, fell to his knees, and began to gently kiss her feet, which was the prescribed way to wake her every morning.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After several minutes, Natasha roused, stretched, and tapped him on the top of his head with her free foot to signal that he should stop his homage.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What a glorious morning.&nbsp; This is the day I&#8217;ve been looking forward to for a long time.&nbsp; I&#8217;m so excited.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Scott&#8217;s only response was a wave of anxiety that surged through his stomach.&nbsp; He scrambled to place slippers on her feet as she sat up on the side of the bed, then helped her into her robe, before she entered the Mistress bathroom.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;During breakfast, he stood attentively to the back and side of her, rushing forward to refresh her coffee, refill her juice glass, or see to any other need she required.&nbsp; When she finished, he quickly cleaned up, grabbed a hurried bite to eat as he did so, and then spent the rest of the morning making the place spotless and ready for the evening&#8217;s activities, while she read the morning papers and lounged.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Just before noon, Natasha announced that she wanted to go shopping.&nbsp; After they both had dressed, and he had opened the back door of the car for her, he got into the driver&#8217;s seat.&nbsp; She ordered him to take her to an upscale lingerie store, commenting that she wanted some new special items for the evening.&nbsp; En route, she was unusually engaging in her conversation, but his nerves on this day made it difficult for him to do more that answer &#8216;Yes Mistress.&nbsp; No Mistress&#8217; in response.&nbsp; Occasionally he was able to produce a witticism that made her laugh, but this did little to ease his tension.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once at the lingerie store, after much deliberation, often asking his advice and using it for her final selection, she chose an elegant black silk negligee with matching panties and robe.&nbsp; She had him, rather than the saleslady, help her try on several selections of open toed slippers before she decided on a pair.&nbsp; She then led the way to the Full-Body section where she picked out a pair of frilly chiffon panties for him.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When they went to the cashier, the young salesgirl suggested to Natasha that she might have made a mistake.&nbsp; The chiffon panties were extra-large, while the rest of her purchases were more appropriately small.&nbsp; Natasha laughed, told her that there was no mistake, and looked pointedly at Scott.&nbsp; The salesgirl blushed, tittered, and then smiled knowingly at Scott as he paid the bill.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Natasha decided she wanted to shop in several more stores in the area, making a number of stops and purchases along the way, with Scott in tow behind, carrying all her packages and her pocketbook.&nbsp; Lunch was next on her agenda, and they went to one of her favorite lunch restaurants, where she ordered a soup and quiche for herself , and a small garden salad for him.&nbsp; Her mood continued to be buoyant, and she &#8216;encouraged&#8217; him to regale her with several of his many droll stories, to keep her entertained.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When they finally arrived home in the late afternoon, she announced that she had to begin preparations for her special evening.&nbsp; She instructed him to change into his new chiffon panties, and then draw a hot bubble bath for her, and then await her in the bathroom.&nbsp; She arrived several minutes after it was filled, dressed only in her bathrobe and slippers, which he helped remove before she slipped in the warm, scented water.&nbsp; She luxuriated in it as he knelt by the side, chatting away about how wonderful her day had been thus far, and how much more so it would be that night. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After about fifteen minutes, she had him shampoo and rinse her hair, then cleanse her entire body with her loofa.&nbsp; He then assisted her out of the bath, toweled her dry, slipped on her slippers, helped wrap a towel around her hair and a larger one around her body before they went into the bedroom.&nbsp; She unwrapped the body towel and lay down prone on the bed, and allowed him to give her a body massage with her favorite lavender-scented lotion.&nbsp; When she finally indicated that he was finished with this, he asked her if she wanted him to prepare dinner for her.&nbsp; She replied that she was too excited to eat, and that &#8216;they&#8217; would dine after.&nbsp; She then bade him to give her a manicure and pedicure, using the magenta colored nail polish she had purchased earlier in the day.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Over the time he had been with her, Scott had performed all of these different duties for her, but never all at one time as he had done on this day.&nbsp; This underscored to him how very special this day was to her, and fueled the growing state of controlled agony he was experiencing.&nbsp; Natasha noted with some satisfaction and delight how his usually rock steady hand was trembling slightly as he painted her toenails.&nbsp; The day was certainly having the effect on him that she wanted.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After he blew dry her hair, and brushed and combed it for over fifteen minutes, he then helped her dress in her new negligee, panties and robe, finally placing her new slippers on her feet.&nbsp; With a rising sense of near panic, he realized how gorgeous and alluring she was.&nbsp; He practically jumped when precisely at seven o:clock the doorbell rang.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well don&#8217;t just kneel there Scott.&nbsp; Go and let my guest in.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As he scurried to the door, Scott wondered whether his Mistress&#8217; guest knew what all he was getting into this night.&nbsp; Whether he would be expecting a male slave, dressed only in frilly panties, greeting him at the door.&nbsp; Knowing his Mistress, her guest probably wouldn&#8217;t be surprised, and would likely enjoy, and be amused at the services he would probably be providing them both, before and after.&nbsp; At that moment, Scott truly didn&#8217;t know how he was going to make it through the rest of the evening.&nbsp; Nothing could have prepared him, however, for the shock which he then received.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Jeremy!�&nbsp; He exclaimed as he opened the door.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Scott.&nbsp; Are you alright?� Jeremy worriedly asked seeing the utter dismay on his close friend&#8217;s face.&nbsp; �You were expecting me, weren&#8217;t you?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Ah ... Yes ... Of course ... Come in�&nbsp; was all Scott could manage.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Should I undress?�&nbsp; He inquired as he entered the hallway.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No.&nbsp; Of course not Jeremy.�&nbsp; Natasha answered as she suddenly appeared behind Scott.&nbsp; �At least not yet.�&nbsp; She then surprised both slaves as she moved forward to hug Jeremy, and kiss him on the cheek.&nbsp; �It&#8217;s so good to see you, and I&#8217;m so happy that Meri saw fit to lend you to me for the night.�&nbsp; She locked one of her arms in his, and led him into the living room as Scott dejectedly followed. She indicated that he should sit on the sofa, and then turned back to Scott.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Scott.&nbsp; Pour both Jeremy and me a glass of wine, and then I want you to go prepare the bedroom as I told you before, while I instruct Jeremy on what&#8217;s expected of him tonight.&nbsp; When you&#8217;re finished, I want you to take off your panties, and kneel by the bedside.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Despite the intensity of the horror that he now felt, Scott could do nothing else at that moment but obey.&nbsp; He went into the bedroom, and as previously ordered, lit the candles by the bedside, turned down the bed sheets, poured two more glasses of wine, turned off the lights, and then took off his panties, placed them under the bed, and knelt by the side of it. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To wait .

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As he did so, Scott couldn&#8217;t&nbsp; really fathom that this was all happening.&nbsp; That his Mistress would take a lover with his full knowledge was difficult enough.&nbsp; That it would be his best friend, and that he apparently was going to be forced to watch, took it all to an unbearable place.&nbsp; He didn&#8217;t know if he could go through with this.&nbsp; He truly wanted to be Natasha&#8217;s slave forever.&nbsp; And be more if she would have it.&nbsp; But he didn&#8217;t know if he could pay this price to do so.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The minutes dragged on to well over thirty as he waited on his knees, only imagining what could be going on in the living room, as his agony rose to a near intolerable point.&nbsp; Finally the bedroom door opened and Natasha glided in like a Goddess.&nbsp; Without a word, she walked to the bed and sat down, facing Scott and looking down at him.&nbsp; Silently.&nbsp; For over a minute.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well Scott, you have certainly prepared everything exactly as I commanded.&nbsp; I believe the time has finally come.&nbsp; What do you think?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Struggling strenuously to maintain the ability to give her everything she wanted of him, he tried.&nbsp; And failed.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Mistress ... Please ... Don&#8217;t.�&nbsp; He implored.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Don&#8217;t what?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Natasha ... Please, I beg you ... Don&#8217;t ... Not Jeremy ... Not anyone.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Whatever can you mean?�&nbsp; She asked, incredulous.&nbsp; �You want me to send Jeremy away?&nbsp; You want me to insult Meryn?&nbsp; My best friend.&nbsp; Your friend.&nbsp; After she allowed him to come over for this.&nbsp; Why would you ever want me to do anything like that?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had no other answer to give, even as he knew it would make no difference.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Because I love you.�&nbsp; He whispered hoarsely, hanging his head, awaiting her derision and scorn.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her eyes gleamed, and her smile lit up the room.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Of course you do, Scott.&nbsp; As I love you.&nbsp;&nbsp; But what does that have to do with Jeremy preparing a romantic dinner for us both tonight?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His head snapped up.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�But I ... I thought ...�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I know what you thought, Scott.�&nbsp; She rebuked sternly.&nbsp; �Oh, you can be such a trial to me at times.&nbsp; It&#8217;s obvious you need so much more training.�&nbsp; She waited several seconds.&nbsp; �You do still want the training, don&#8217;t you?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes ... Always� he gasped.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her voice softened.&nbsp; The moment had come.&nbsp; Even she felt a touch of anxiety.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You know, Scott.&nbsp; What you thought was going to happen tonight.&nbsp; It still might in the future.&nbsp; Unless ...�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Unless, Mistress?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Unless I was married.&nbsp; If I was married, I would never do anything like that to my husband.&nbsp; Even if he was my slave.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His eyes widened.&nbsp; �Do you mean it?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I always mean what I say, Scott.&nbsp; Haven&#8217;t you learned that yet?&nbsp; I can see that the training for a husband is going to have to be even more intense.&nbsp; Are you sure you still want it?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes!&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; Please Mistress ... I beg you ...Please marry me.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With that he buried his face in her lap, then turned it sideways as she began to stroke his face.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good ... Very good, my pet ... That was the right answer ... Very, very good.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And it was very good.&nbsp; Meri had been so right.&nbsp; He did love her.&nbsp; She had always been convinced that he was only in it for the kink that she could provide.&nbsp; For a long while that had been enough for her too, but as her feelings for him grew, she believed that she had to push the kink more and more.&nbsp; To entice him to want to stay with her, which she now wanted more than anything in her life.&nbsp; She hadn&#8217;t dared believe, even after Meri had told her.&nbsp; She had to find out for sure.&nbsp; Today had been the test.&nbsp; It hadn&#8217;t been a very fair test, she knew.&nbsp; But being fair wasn&#8217;t necessarily part of being a Domme.&nbsp; Perhaps somewhat more in being a wife.&nbsp; She would see.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After several minutes, Natasha gently urged Scott to kneel up, continuing to smile at him.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I guess as a husband, there will have to be an expansion of certain privileges.�&nbsp; She said as she used her foot to lift his plastic encased cock.&nbsp; �I think this particular one, however, will have to wait until our actual nuptials.�&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She paused for a second, and then slipped over her head a gold chain with a small key on it.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That doesn&#8217;t mean though, that as Jeremy finishes making our dinner, we can&#8217;t have some fun playing together to celebrate our engagement.� 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She bent forward to unlock his cage.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once freed, Scott immediately sprang to attention at his full eight inches in joyous supplication.&nbsp; She took his hands and pulled him up and into her bed to begin their celebration.


 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Both Natasha and Scott had understood from the beginning that each had a deep need in their psyches for the kink that they provided and received from each other.&nbsp; What they had discovered this evening, was that they also had both been yearning to give and get so much more from each other.&nbsp; At one time, Natasha would have laughed to have called this love.&nbsp; But when it had been declared and offered to her so freely, she found that she was only too happy to offer it back.&nbsp; As long as it would always be on her own terms.&nbsp; For his part Scott would be only too happy to accept that.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And comply.

&nbsp;&nbsp; 









1Part 8.&nbsp; The Ceremony


 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The wedding of Natasha and Scott was definitely not going to be traditional.&nbsp; Natasha made this clear from the very first day.&nbsp; For the few family members they each had left, their business associates, and the diminishing number of vanilla friends they had, they concocted a story of impulsively going down to City Hall and getting married.&nbsp; For the rest of the enlarging group of their lifestyle acquaintances, Natasha was planning a femdom extravaganza.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Meryn and Jeremy were so happy with the unexpected turn of events, that they were extremely pleased to be involved, especially when Natasha asked Meryn to be her Mistress of Honor, and Scott asked permission for Jeremy to be his Best Slave.&nbsp; Natasha had never gone into details with Meryn about the events of the engagement night.&nbsp; Jeremy had only been able to tell her that he had prepared a sumptuous dinner for them, as Natasha had instructed, which he had then served them very late in the evening when they had finally emerged, slightly bedraggled but utterly transported when they told him the news.&nbsp; Meryn thought it was extremely sweet that Natasha had &#8216;borrowed&#8217; Jeremy for that purpose, and later told Natasha so.&nbsp; She had not been concerned for Jeremy about what might happen that night.&nbsp; She had privately made sure that he understood that there were boundaries beyond which he was not to go.&nbsp; If he had ever felt in any way compromised by anything that Natasha might have demanded of him, she had given him an ironclad command to leave at once.&nbsp; She really had trusted Natasha, but trust went only so far when you were safeguarding your man.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Natasha did not see any reason to tell Meryn the real use she had made of Jeremy that night.&nbsp; Meryn would just&nbsp; never understand, but Natasha loved her for it all the same.&nbsp; And, she insisted to herself, she had never intended to use Jeremy that night in the way that Scott had feared.&nbsp; She would never do something like that to Meri, her best friend.&nbsp; And, she knew now, she could never have done it to Scott either, even before he had begged her not to, and professed his love.&nbsp; Finally, she had to concede, she wouldn&#8217;t have done anything like that to Jeremy either.&nbsp; He was a friend, himself, now after all. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The ceremony was held on a lovely spring evening at Scott&#8217;s place at the lake.&nbsp; There were about fifty guests, all of them Dommes and their attending slaves.&nbsp; Some of the latter were slave-husbands, and the majority of the rest were in long term relationships with their owners.&nbsp; The person officiating was the same lady judge who had married Meryn and Jeremy, and whom Meryn now discovered was a Domme herself, who had her own large stable of slaves.&nbsp; One of them was her escort for the night, a distinguished looking gentleman who would not have looked out of place in any corporate boardroom except for the thick, black studded collar he wore around his neck.&nbsp; Indeed, all of the slaves in attendance, including Jeremy, wore collars of some kind, it being the accouterment du rigeur of the evening for them.&nbsp; They were all otherwise fully dressed.&nbsp; This was a serious occasion after all.
The Judge had graciously lent many of the rest of her stable to Natasha for the evening, to be used as waiters, bartenders and busboys at the reception to follow.&nbsp; They were all properly attired for their roles as well.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Natasha had kept many of her planned specifics for the ceremony secret, even from Meryn.&nbsp; This was to be a grand spectacle, and she wanted it to be a wondrous surprise for everyone .&nbsp; The large backyard along the lakeshore was arrayed on the left side with rows of comfortably cushioned lawn chairs, to which the Dommes were escorted by their attendant slaves to be seated.&nbsp; The slaves then walked across the large central aisle to the right side, to be situated in rows of wooden kneelers that were set up on that side.&nbsp; The central aisle had a long red carpet down its center, at the end of which a small podium for the Judge was set up.&nbsp; In front of that was slightly elevated platform on which sat a single red cushioned, old Victorian armchair.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When all the guests were seated or kneeling, the Lady Judge, the Mistress of Honor, and the Best Slave took their places in front.&nbsp; A buzz of anticipation swirled through the guests, at least on the left side among the Dommes, as the slaves on the right remained dutifully silent.&nbsp; After an appropriate delay, Scott&#8217;s elaborate sound system burst forth withe the piped-in processional that Natasha had chosen, �Thus Spake Zarathustra�.&nbsp; All of the guests rose to the thumping music, awaiting the arrival of the Guest of Honor, and her soon to be slave husband.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They did not have to wait long. From around the side of the house, Scott, dressed in white pants and shoes, a white satin shirt and leather vest, and finally a white, rhinestone studded collar with a white bow tie in front, emerged, pulling the rickshaw on which Natasha was regally seated.&nbsp; She was adorned in a mid length white leather skirt, covering knee high white leather boots, a white silk blouse with lace accentuating all the right areas.&nbsp; She wore several strands of pearls around her neck, and finally a large white tiara with a circle of diamonds in the center.&nbsp; Instead of flowers, she held a large, coiled bullwhip, something she knew she would never use, but which she thought an appropriate symbol for the occasion.&nbsp; The approving murmurs she heard from the Domme side of the aisle seemed to bear this out.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With all deliberate gravity, Scott slowly pulled the rickshaw down the aisle.&nbsp; When he reached the front, he lay down prone in front of Natasha&nbsp; so she could step off onto his back and onto the platform to be seated in her chair.&nbsp; As he had been instructed, Jeremy then pulled the rickshaw out of the way, as Scott knelt by Natasha&#8217;s side, and she placed her hand on the top of his head.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Judge stepped forward to formally begin the ceremony.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Mistresses.&nbsp; And slaves.&nbsp; We are gathered here today to witness the very joyous event of the joining in matrimony of the Lady Natasha and her slave Scott.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She surveyed the crowd.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Marriage is a sacred union, made even more special in this case, as here it is not only a joining of two people, but also the complete surrender of one into the total dominion of the other.&nbsp; Scott, today, is offering freely his entire being at the feet of Natasha to be used however she will.&nbsp; But with this gift of himself comes a solemn responsibility.&nbsp; Natasha&nbsp; will be charged forever with his care, as he will no longer be allowed to see to it himself.&nbsp; His life, to which today she will vow to accept, love and protect, will be placed in her hands.�&nbsp; She now looked directly at Natasha.&nbsp; �Use him well.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With that the Judge nodded to Scott, and asked if he was ready to proceed.&nbsp; Scott answered a most definite yes, and turned to Jeremy, who stepped forward and attached a white leash to a ring on the back of Scott&#8217;s collar.&nbsp; He handed the other end to Scott and stepped back.&nbsp; At that end of the leash a gold ring was attached to the leather handle.&nbsp; Scott shuffled on his knees in front of Natasha, bent down and kissed both of her feet, then knelt up and placed the ring with the attached leash onto her offered finger.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�My most beloved Mistress Natasha.&nbsp; With this ring and leash, I pledge my life and lifetime in undying love, obedience and servitude to you.&nbsp; I beg you to take me forever as your adoring husband and slave.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Judge then nodded to Natasha, who turned to Meryn, who handed her a small gold hoop earing.&nbsp; Natasha took it as she stood and stepped before the still kneeling Scott.&nbsp; She placed the connecting end of the hoop through a pierced area of his nasal septum so that the ring, once attached, hung down from the middle of his nose.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Scott.&nbsp; With this ring as a symbol of your role in my life, I accept with love your vow of devoted service and obedience.&nbsp; I promise to be here for you forever, to be loved, worshiped, served and adored.&nbsp; By you alone.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She then lifted him up to stand beside her as the Judge pronounced them Mistress-Wife and Slave-Husband.&nbsp; Scott had started the ceremony as only her slave, and appropriately had kissed only her feet.&nbsp; Now, as her husband, he was allowed to kiss her as a wife as well.&nbsp; And he did so with amazing gusto, to the appreciative applause of all gathered.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was then time to party.&nbsp; First, cocktails and a fantastic array of hors d&#8217;oeuvres were served by the Judge&#8217;s slaves to any and all of the guests.&nbsp; Many of the Dommes had their own slaves scurry back and forth to bring the various selections of the finger food and drinks.&nbsp; Most, but not all, of the slave guests, after their Mistresses had been served, were allowed some of the offerings themselves, but always with the permission and moderating control of their owners.&nbsp; A spectacular dinner buffet followed, during which wine and drinks continued to flow, at least for the Dommes in attendance.&nbsp; It was clear that no expense had been spared.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At the far end of the yard, a dance area had been set up, and a band was playing.&nbsp; It was an amateur, but very accomplished group, made up of a number of high level male executives, dressed only in collars and loin cloths, who called their band �the submissives�.&nbsp; They often played for free at large femdom functions like the one this night.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For their first dance, Natasha had chosen a slowed down version of �Ain&#8217;t Too Proud To Beg� with some minor but appropriate lyric changes.&nbsp; They were soon joined on the dance floor by several other Dommes and their slaves, including Meryn and Jeremy.&nbsp; Once this dance was over, more of the Mistresses began dancing with their own, and, sometimes, other slaves.&nbsp; Several of the Dommes prevailed upon Natasha to have Scott take them on rickshaw rides around the property.&nbsp; He was a husband now, however, and merited some more consideration than a simple command.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Scott, darling.�&nbsp; She said sweetly.&nbsp; �Some of my friends would like a rickshaw ride.&nbsp; Be a dear and see to it.�&nbsp;&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He jumped to obey.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While he was thus occupied, she was left alone on the side of the dance floor, as none of the other slaves appeared courageous enough to dare ask her to dance, until Jeremy, with much more confidence than he had shown at his own wedding, strode forward to do so.&nbsp; She graciously accepted, and they stepped out onto the dance floor.&nbsp; Meryn watched them with pride as Jeremy led Natasha throughout.&nbsp; At the end of the dance, he leaned forward and whispered into her ear.&nbsp; She laughed and answered back into his, and he smiled as they parted.&nbsp; Once the ice was broken, many of the other Dommes rushed to have their slaves dance with Natasha, which kept her most enjoyably entertained while Scott was otherwise engaged.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The festivities rocked on into the night as the guests, particularly the Dommes, appeared to be enjoying themselves immensely.&nbsp; This was particularly apparent when a number of them ordered their slaves out onto the dance floor for a command performance of a slaves-only Macarena.&nbsp; This was accompanied by many hoots, whoops, and whistles by the boisterously laughing Mistresses in the audience.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Scott had finally exhausted the many requests for his rickshaw services, he made his way back to the side of his seated Mistress-Wife.&nbsp; He knelt down and whispered into her ear.&nbsp; She nodded assent, and he got up and walked across the dance floor and respectfully asked Meryn to dance.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It would be an honor, Scott.�&nbsp; She said as he led her onto the floor, and they began a slow dance.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�The honor is all mine, Miss Meri.�&nbsp; He answered.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Please Scott.&nbsp; Particularly on this night.&nbsp; Just Meryn.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Especially on this night it should be Miss Meri.�&nbsp; He responded, smiling.&nbsp; �I just want you to know how very much I appreciate everything you&#8217;ve done for us.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What have I done?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I don&#8217;t know all the details, but I&#8217;ve gathered enough to know that you were the major force in encouraging my Mistress to look to discover more in me than she ever thought existed.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh, she would have found you on her own, Scott.&nbsp; Anyone with eyes could see you had so much more to offer.&nbsp; So very much more to the real you.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His smile turned solemn.&nbsp; �No Meryn.&nbsp; I really don&#8217;t think that would have happened without you.&nbsp; You were the one who got us all together, and allowed her the opportunity to see me in a different way.&nbsp; You were the one she respected enough to take a different look.&nbsp; And from the many clues that she&#8217;s dropped, you were the one who convinced her not to do something that may have destroyed it all.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; They both knew to what he was referring, and they danced silently, lost in their own thoughts for the next several moments.&nbsp; Scott then continued.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I want you to know, Meryn, that I will never, ever forget any of it.&nbsp; I am so glad, and so very thankful, that you are my friend.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eyes glistening, Meryn stopped their dance, put the palm of one hand flat on one his cheeks, and reached up to kiss him on the other.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I don&#8217;t think you can ever know how much that means to me, Scott.�&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They parted with a hug.

 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Later, as the gala was beginning to show some small signs of winding down, Meryn and Jeremy sat on the back porch on the bench swing, his left hand entwined in her right.&nbsp; They gently rocked back and forth in comfortable silence, taking in what was left of the party.&nbsp; Meryn finally broke the silence with a soft query.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�So what did you whisper into Natasha&#8217;s ear this time when you danced?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The corners of his mouth twitched up.&nbsp; �I asked her to please take good care of her man.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�And what did she answer?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It now became a full smile.&nbsp; �She said he would be well kept.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Meryn nodded with rueful approval.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A group of Dommes, including Natasha, could now be seen and heard arranging for a game of&nbsp; �Kiss the Tail of the Donkey�.&nbsp; This was a game that was becoming increasing popular at lifestyle parties.&nbsp; In it, a given slave was designated as the donkey.&nbsp; He was bent at the waist over a table.&nbsp; The contestant slaves were then led about ten feet away.&nbsp; A liberal amount of lipstick was applied to their lips and they were then placed on all fours and blindfolded.&nbsp; One by one, they were aimed by their Mistresses, and told to crawl forward.&nbsp; On first contact with any object with their blindfolded face, they were to kiss it, the lipstick marking the spot.&nbsp; The winner was the slave who came closest to kissing the center of the donkey&#8217;s tail.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As hostess, Natasha felt it was her duty to offer Scott as the donkey.&nbsp; She led him over to the table, pulled his pants and his chiffon panties down to his ankles, his still imprisoned member visible for all to see.&nbsp; She bent him over the table, and then announced that the winner among the ten slave contestants would be granted the honor of kissing the feet of all the contestants&#8217; Dommes, including the Bride.&nbsp; The losers would be left to contemplate the displeasure of their Mistresses for their pathetic failure.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Meryn watched with morbid fascination as the first slave crawled forward, kissed and missed, his mark left on the table to the side of Scott.&nbsp; The next slave fared much better, as his forehead grazed the side of Scott&#8217;s behind, and his kiss left red lip marks on the right cheek of the donkey&#8217;s tail, eliciting a delighted squeal from the contestant&#8217;s Domme.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Now that&#8217;s the way to kiss an ass!�&nbsp; Natasha chortled at her pun, to the appreciative accompaniment of female laughter.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Meryn rolled her eyes, shook her head, and looked away, turning her attention back to Jeremy.&nbsp; She sighed and said to him.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�This has all been just a little bit over the top, don&#8217;t you think?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He turned to face her with a shy smile.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�They&#8217;re both very happy.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She gazed up at him with a longing look.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�And are you happy, my love?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Exceedingly.�&nbsp; And he gave her his special smile that never failed to melt her heart.&nbsp; An intuitive question flashed into her mind.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�But you would like some more of this, wouldn&#8217;t you?�&nbsp; She asked, vaguely gesturing to the activities behind her.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His smile lessened, and he looked away.&nbsp; After several long moments, he finally answered.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Sometimes.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She took a few seconds before proceeding.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�We have our Fun and Games.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He took even longer as he bowed his head before responding slowly.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes ... We do.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The silence that now stretched between them was nothing like the one before.&nbsp; It was filled with unasked and unanswered questions.&nbsp; This time it was broken by Jeremy, who suddenly lifted his head, sighed&nbsp; �Meryn� and brought his lips urgently to hers, and kissed her with a raw passion.&nbsp; Startled at first, she quickly warmed to, and then embraced it, as he had never before initiated a kiss like this.&nbsp; When their lips and tongues finally parted, his breathing was heavy, and his voice ragged as he rasped.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Meryn ... do you think ... when we get back to the room ... we could ... you know ...�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�My love.&nbsp; You don&#8217;t have to ask.� thrilled that he had, as he had never done so before.&nbsp; �I always want to be there for you, as you&#8217;ve always been there for me.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He nodded.&nbsp; And when they returned to the room where they were staying, he didn&#8217;t ask.&nbsp; He took.&nbsp; Without permission.&nbsp; Hard.&nbsp; And rough.&nbsp; It hadn&#8217;t been this electric for either of them in quite some time.&nbsp; And they took full advantage.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As the evening&#8217;s events reached the ultimate climax for them both, with Meryn gasping ecstatically, she wondered joyously if this truly marked an important milestone that they may have reached this night.&nbsp; As they continued their ongoing journey together in the lifestyle they had both chosen.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 










1Part 9.&nbsp; Questions And Crisis


 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For the week following Natasha and Scott&#8217;s wedding, Jeremy was unusually quiet, even withdrawn.&nbsp; He seemed particularly reticent to talk about the party whenever Meryn would bring it up.&nbsp; He continued to be very diligent about all of his chores, duties and care of her, maybe even more so than usual.&nbsp; It was just that it seemed to her that he was almost embarrassed about something.&nbsp; After a week of his not really responding to her subtle inquiries, she decided to meet the matter head on one evening during her foot massage.&nbsp; She discovered that he was not only embarrassed, but deeply ashamed of his actions on the night of the ceremony.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�But why Jeremy?&nbsp; I thought we had a lot of fun at the party.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was rubbing her feet much harder than usual.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�My behavior was way out of line, Meryn.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve been trying all week to ask for your forgiveness, but I haven&#8217;t been able to, because I can&#8217;t forgive myself.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about.&nbsp; I had an absolutely wonderful time with you.�&nbsp; Her lips curved up into a wicked smile.&nbsp; �Especially at the end.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He lowered his head.&nbsp; �That&#8217;s what I mean.&nbsp; What I did was completely uncalled for.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know what came over me.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She laughed.&nbsp; �I think it&#8217;s called love.&nbsp; And lust.�&nbsp; When he didn&#8217;t seem to respond, she continued more seriously.&nbsp; �Really, my love, I loved that you took charge.&nbsp; I really like you to be in control sometimes.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�But I was out of control.�&nbsp; He cried.&nbsp; �The things that I did.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t right ... It was like ... �

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Like what?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�... like you were mine.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was stunned.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�But I am yours, Jeremy.�&nbsp; She protested.&nbsp; �Just like you&#8217;re mine.&nbsp; That&#8217;s the way it&#8217;s supposed to be.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Not like that.&nbsp; It shouldn&#8217;t be.&nbsp; It can&#8217;t be like that.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And no matter how hard she tried to convince him otherwise, to cajole him, to encourage him, even after he appeared to surrender and agree with her viewpoints, she could tell that deep within, he continued to believe that he had no right, that it was unconscionable, for him to have acted as he had.&nbsp; Or in any way like it.&nbsp; She understood then, with regret, that this was going to be an issue for them for some time to come.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Over the next several days, Meryn didn&#8217;t quite know how to react to the situation.&nbsp; On the surface, things appeared to return to normal, with Jeremy making a good effort and show of it.&nbsp; But she could see that he was still clearly upset with how he perceived he had acted.&nbsp; She also felt that there was far more to it all than that.&nbsp; She thought back to his cryptic comments at the wedding.&nbsp; Did he need more of what they had witnessed there than she had been giving him?&nbsp; Did she need to be more of a Mistress and less of a Wife to him than she had been?&nbsp; He had always done everything he could, and more, to see to her happiness.&nbsp; Could she do any less for him?&nbsp; If that&#8217;s what it took to make him happy, to snap him out of this, she surely had to try.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The only role model Meryn had for any of this was Natasha.&nbsp; There were certainly many things that she saw in Natasha that she knew were beyond her and that she could never do.&nbsp; But she could emulate the attitude, the character as Natasha had called it.&nbsp; She resolved to try, and see what kind of response she could get out of her Love.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She selected the next Monday to start.&nbsp; From the moment she woke up, to be served her breakfast as always, she began acting more imperious and haughty.&nbsp; She stopped thanking Jeremy for the little things and courtesies he did, and no longer complimented him on his more extensive efforts, such as his always delicious dinners.&nbsp; During her daily foot massages, instead of discussing their day&#8217;s events as they usually did, she began to criticize his performance of his chores, even when they had been done perfectly.&nbsp; She feigned indifference to his nightly devotionals, and by the second night even took to reading a magazine while he offered his homage.&nbsp; She began snapping at him for no reason, and ignoring him much of the rest of the time.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By mid week she needed something to relieve the stress and tension that her actions had been causing, so after Jeremy completed his devotional for the evening, Meryn put down the magazine she had been reading, and looked down at him.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Look slave.&nbsp; I&#8217;m going to give you a chance to make up for your sloppy performance with everything else so far this week.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s see if you can do something right for a change.�&nbsp; With that she lay back on the bed and spread her legs.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jeremy needed no further encouragement.&nbsp; He crawled forward, and with his face and tongue enthusiastically took to his task.&nbsp; Meryn had never been able to say that he was anything less than an ardent lover.&nbsp; Working slowly at first, within minutes he had her writhing on the bed, and then accelerating his efforts, soon had her enjoying a particularly splendid orgasm.&nbsp; But she wanted more than lips and tongue this night, so as he continued his oral worship she grabbed him by his hair, pulled him up onto the bed and onto his back, and without any hesitation, mounted him.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She rode him hard and fast, and he worked furiously to keep up with her.&nbsp; She rode higher and higher until she reached the peak.&nbsp; As she did, she sensed him struggling mightily to hold back, awaiting the permission to cum that he always required, and which she always granted, usually right at the moment when they could share the climax together.&nbsp; It would not be given this night.&nbsp; After she rode him to the heights of her own passion, when she was absolutely spent, she collapsed off of him, eyes closed, to lay panting on her side.&nbsp; Jeremy lay next to her, painfully erect and totally bewildered.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As her breathing eased, and heartbeat slowed, she finally opened her eyes to look at him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Marginally better.�&nbsp; She said.&nbsp; �But I think a night of blue balls might just be the burr you need in your butt to spur you on to more adequate efforts tomorrow.�&nbsp; With that, she turned over onto her other side, away from him, and fell asleep.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jeremy&#8217;s reaction to all of the week&#8217;s actions was to become more and more servile.&nbsp; Soon, his only response to her was either a �Yes Ma&#8217;am� or �No Ma&#8217;am�, with no unsolicited talk in any other way.&nbsp; He hadn&#8217;t offered even a small smile in several days.&nbsp; His domestic responsibilities didn&#8217;t suffer.&nbsp; If anything, they were even more exemplary despite Meryn&#8217;s ongoing sniping.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By the end of the week, which included another night of blue balls for Jeremy, Meryn had had enough.&nbsp; At work on Friday, she had even snapped at her assistant, Michael, and she knew she had to put an end to it.&nbsp; When she arrived home that evening, to be greeted by Jeremy with her customary cold drink and foot lotion in his hands, she sat down in her favorite easy chair.&nbsp; He knelt in front of her, head down, as if awaiting another verbal barrage.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Jeremy, my Love.�&nbsp; She started softly, almost plaintively.&nbsp; �I just can&#8217;t keep this up any more.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He looked up at her anxious face, and slowly a small smile creased his, the first one she had seen in almost a week.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You aren&#8217;t very good at being a bitch.�&nbsp; He said, his smile broadening.&nbsp; �But I&#8217;d hate it even more if you were.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She heaved a huge sigh of relief, then returned his smile.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�And you were a pretty poor excuse for a toad.�&nbsp; She replied.&nbsp; �Let&#8217;s just agree to be who we are.&nbsp; That&#8217;s good enough for me.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You&#8217;ve always been more than I could have ever dreamed , Meryn.&nbsp; Please don&#8217;t ever change.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Then it&#8217;s settled.&nbsp; You&#8217;re my husband.&nbsp; I&#8217;m your wife.&nbsp; I&#8217;m your Mistress.&nbsp; You&#8217;re my slave.&nbsp; It&#8217;s as simple as that.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�As simple as that.�&nbsp; He agreed.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If it were only that simple, she wished.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Something really smells delicious.�&nbsp; She said, changing the subject, and because she was suddenly very hungry, her appetite returning with a vengeance after several days.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I made one of your favorites.�&nbsp; He replied.&nbsp; �Veal Sorrentino.&nbsp; It should be ready as soon as I finish your foot rub.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yum.�&nbsp; She responded as she looked down at him applying himself with vigor in massaging her feet.&nbsp; �And Jeremy, after dinner, I&#8217;d like to postpone my weekly body massage until tomorrow.�&nbsp; Seeing a flicker of disappointment flash across his face, she went on.&nbsp; �I would like an extra special devotional tonight though.&nbsp; I think I&#8217;ve been missing out on enjoying it recently.�&nbsp; She paused several seconds before continuing slowly.&nbsp; �And then I have a very severe case of blue balls of mine that I&#8217;ve got to take care of.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This was met with the smile she had so badly wanted, and had been missing for too long.


 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They quickly settled back into their comfortable routine.&nbsp; Meryn knew that below the surface there were still unanswered questions and issues, but she was content to let them be for the present, particularly after her recent disastrous experiment.&nbsp; This was made easier by their workload, especially for Jeremy.&nbsp; As had been previously announced, the head of his department had retired at the end of the last school year, and, as anticipated, Jeremy had been named the new Chairman of the English Department for the coming school year.&nbsp; His Principal, who was his strongest advocate at work, was urging him to put together the plan for a completely new and revamped curriculum and course of study that Jeremy had been developing for over a year, but had held off proposing in deference to the old chief.&nbsp; Now, with all these new responsibilities, Jeremy was far busier at work, and bringing much more of it home.&nbsp; He was finding it difficult to get his daily domestic duties done at night, so he was now usually spending most of Sundays in addition to his usual full day on Saturdays to complete his housework.&nbsp; Meryn tried to help out as much as she dared, but although he no longer complained when she contributed, she was sensitive, particularly now, that she not give any appearance that she felt he was incapable of meeting his perceived obligations to her, and his chores.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Because of their increased work schedules, they hadn&#8217;t been able to participate in many social activities.&nbsp; They had gotten together with Natasha and Scott a number of times.&nbsp; Surprisingly, Natasha had initiated several of these, coming up with interesting and fun &#8216;vanilla&#8217; things for the two couples to do.&nbsp; They had not had any time to go away for any recent Fun and Games weekends, and just as surprisingly, Meryn found that she missed these as well.&nbsp; It might have given her more opportunities to see and discover the extent of Jeremy&#8217;s inner needs.&nbsp; And, in her heart, she now realized that she, herself, had come to very much enjoy the fun of those games.


 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The crisis came suddenly and unexpectedly several months later.&nbsp; After her division at work had posted their fourth consecutive quarter of record breaking profits, Meryn was named the company&#8217;s �Person Of The Year�.&nbsp; She was to be given this award at the company&#8217;s annual gala dinner.&nbsp; It was now an open secret that she was next in line for a Vice Presidency in the near future.&nbsp; The problem was that the gala was to be held on the same night as an important Board of Education meeting, when Jeremy was going to present his proposal for his new curriculum, and petition for the significant funding that it would take to implement it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Of course I&#8217;m going to be upset that you&#8217;re not going to be able to come to the dinner.�&nbsp; Meryn assured him when the conflict in dates became apparent, and he began suggesting alternative arrangements so that he would be able to attend.&nbsp; �But you have to go to your board meeting and make your presentation.&nbsp; I&#8217;m just getting an award.&nbsp; This is your future and your success we&#8217;re talking about.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve worked far too hard on this.&nbsp; You must go.�&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And there was no further discussion to be had.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On the night of the gala, Meryn was dressed to the nines in a stunning evening dress that had Jeremy practically drooling as he kissed her goodbye as she left for the affair.&nbsp; It was during the cocktail hour, which she spent entertaining the well wishes and congratulations of many of her colleagues, that she received her shock.&nbsp; Striding toward her, dapperly dressed in a tuxedo, with a huge smile on his face, was ... her husband.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Jeremy!�&nbsp; She exclaimed as he reached her.&nbsp; �What are you doing here?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I just couldn&#8217;t miss my Lady&#8217;s big night.�&nbsp; He answered, his smile still very broad.&nbsp; �When she finally gets the recognition she so richly deserves.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�But what about your board meeting?&nbsp; Your presentation?�&nbsp; She replied, no smile on her face.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Sheila,� his new vice chairperson, �is going to make the presentation.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s going to go fine.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�But what if it doesn&#8217;t?&nbsp; You worked too hard on this, Jeremy.&nbsp; And even if it does, then Sheila is going to get all of the credit.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That&#8217;s not important.�&nbsp; He tried to answer.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�But it is.�&nbsp; She practically cried.&nbsp; She then noticed a number of people nearby looking at them, and Mr. Martin and his wife walking towards her to offer their congratulations.&nbsp; She narrowed her eyes toward Jeremy and said in a low, steely voice only he could hear.&nbsp; �We&#8217;ll discuss this later.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For the rest of the event, both Meryn and Jeremy were congenial and engaging with everyone else.&nbsp; They sat at a table which included Natasha and Scott, who did provide some comfort for Meryn, as under the surface there was a tension, which only Scott seemed to notice.&nbsp; This tension did affect her enjoyment on receiving her award, and, indeed, her very real happiness that Jeremy was there to share it with her.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As they had come separately, they went home from the gala separately, with Jeremy arriving home first.&nbsp; When he met Meryn at the door as she arrived, she walked in, dropped her coat in his hands, and strode past him without a word to go sit on the edge of her easy chair, bolt upright.&nbsp; As he entered the living room, after hanging up her coat, she indicated that he should sit down across from her.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Meryn.�&nbsp; He began tentatively.&nbsp; �I know you&#8217;re angry with me.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No, Jeremy.�&nbsp; She replied evenly.&nbsp; �I was angry when I first saw you at the dinner.&nbsp; What I am now is just extremely disappointed.�&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A look of dismay crossed his face.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�This is the first time you&#8217;ve ever disobeyed me.�&nbsp; She continued.&nbsp; �And over something as important as this.�&nbsp; Her voice lowered, dripping with pain.&nbsp; �Your success.&nbsp; Something that obviously means so much more to me than it does to you.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His look of dismay now became one of devastation.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�So yes.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever been so disappointed.�&nbsp; She looked away from him.&nbsp; And then back.&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t want your devotional tonight.&nbsp; Under the circumstances, I think it would be meaningless.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t even want to sleep with you.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At that, she stood up and walked into the bedroom, leaving him rooted, desolate, in his chair.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Meryn tossed and turned for the next several hours, unable to sleep.&nbsp; Had she been too harsh on him?&nbsp; She realized that his actions had been done in a desire to please her, to make her happy.&nbsp; He just didn&#8217;t understand yet what she truly wanted and needed from him.&nbsp; As she remembered the look on his face when she had left him in the living room, her heart&nbsp; wrenched.&nbsp; She got up from the bed, and went out to see to him.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She found him still in his clothes, lying on the couch, staring up at the ceiling.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Jeremy.�&nbsp; She said softly, standing over him.&nbsp; �I know what you did tonight, you did out of love.&nbsp; And I love you for it ... I also forgive you for it.�&nbsp; She waited a few seconds.&nbsp; �Come to bed now, Love�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jeremy turned his head and looked up at her.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Meryn. I can&#8217;t.&nbsp; If you insist, I will.&nbsp; But please don&#8217;t ask ... I just can&#8217;t tonight ... I will tomorrow, I promise ... But not tonight ... Please.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Meryn looked down at him.&nbsp; And nodded reluctantly.&nbsp; And went back into the bedroom.&nbsp; Alone.


 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After a virtually sleepless night, they both spent the next day being extra nice and contrite to each other.&nbsp; By the end of the day, things almost seemed back to normal.&nbsp; Jeremy prepared one of his wonderful dinners.&nbsp; During her foot massage, they talked about anything and everything, except the events of the previous day.&nbsp; During his devotional that night, which Meryn had insisted upon, he somewhat surprised her by not asking for forgiveness.&nbsp; Instead, he told her how much he loved her, how much she meant to him, and how he didn&#8217;t know how he could ever live without her.&nbsp; She knew that they both needed relief from the tension that was still swirling around them, so she gave him the signal she always used to indicate that his intimate attentions were desired.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jeremy began his oral adoration with even more than his usual ardor, and before long she could sense her tension easing, to be replaced by far more delightful feelings.&nbsp; Her first orgasm was particularly strong, and as he continued his fervent attentions, she was rapidly approaching her second.&nbsp; But she knew she needed more.&nbsp; She wanted HIM.&nbsp; And to provide the relief he so desperately needed as well.&nbsp; She called to him to come up to her, but he seemed strangely reluctant, and continued to work furiously on her.&nbsp; Realizing she was again reaching a point of no return, she insisted that he get up and come to her, leaning forward to pull on his arms to get him to do so.&nbsp; When he did, what she saw came as a complete shock.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was totally limp.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Meryn.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry.�&nbsp; He whispered rapidly.&nbsp; �I&#8217;ve been trying.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s wrong.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It&#8217;s alright, Jeremy.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll help you.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll make it work.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But despite the best efforts of her hands, lips and tongue, he remained irredeemably soft.&nbsp; After several minutes, deeply ashamed, he begged her to stop.&nbsp; She did, and crawled up into his arms to snuggle, and reassure him that she was sure that tomorrow everything would be alright.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unfortunately, the next night produced the same lack of results, as did the night following.&nbsp; They decided to wait several days before trying again, but were without success that time as well, and experienced the same on a further attempt a week later.&nbsp; On Jeremy&#8217;s beseeching, he continued to try to pleasure her, but as time went on, she found that despite his best efforts, she could no longer come to orgasm knowing that he could not share in her joy.&nbsp; They soon stopped trying.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was evident that Jeremy&#8217;s failure was affecting him greatly.&nbsp; He was becoming more and more depressed, and more frantic in working harder to find other ways to please her.&nbsp; She could see his growing despondency, and her attempts at raising his spirits by complimenting and praising him on everything big and small, only seemed to highlight to him his sense of inadequacy and failure in the one area that he believed, erroneously, was most important to her.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Meryn didn&#8217;t know what to do.&nbsp; With the type of relationship she had with Jeremy, this was not a problem one discussed with mothers or sisters.&nbsp; After much deliberation, she turned to the only person she thought might be able to help with Jeremy&#8217;s ... and her problem.&nbsp; She called Natasha on the phone.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Meri, I&#8217;m glad you called.�&nbsp; Natasha began when receiving the call.&nbsp; �I was planning on calling you.&nbsp; I was hoping to set up another outing for all of us.&nbsp; It&#8217;s been over a month.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Ah ... yes ... that would be nice, Tash.&nbsp; But that&#8217;s not the reason I&#8217;m calling.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Meri, is everything okay?�&nbsp; Natasha responded, noting more than a hint of desolation in her friend&#8217;s voice.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She started hesitantly.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well ... Jeremy and I are having something of a problem that I could use some help and advice in trying to figure out what to do.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What&#8217;s wrong, Meri?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No, Tash.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think this is something you can help us with.&nbsp; I called you up to ask for a favor.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Anything Meri.&nbsp; You know that.&nbsp; What can I do?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;d like to ask your permission to speak to Scott.&nbsp; Alone.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was a long silence on the other end of the phone.&nbsp; Then ...

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I think you&#8217;re right, Meri.&nbsp; Who better to understand the morass that is the mind of a slave than another slave.&nbsp; Of course you can speak to Scott.&nbsp; Anytime, anywhere, for as long as you want.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Thank you, Tash.&nbsp; This is really very important to me.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Another pause on her end of the line.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You trusted me with your Jeremy on what turned out to be the most important night of my life.&nbsp; How could I do any less for you.&nbsp; I also want you to know that I won&#8217;t ask Scott anything about your conversation.&nbsp; He still might not have any rights to have secrets from me, but you always will.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That means a lot to me, Tash.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�One last thing, Meri.�&nbsp; Natasha added quietly after another long pause.&nbsp; �It may be a little enough thing that you&#8217;re asking of me, but I want you to know that I think I&#8217;m doing this as much for Jeremy as I am for you.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To Meryn, that meant even more. 


 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 









1Part 10.&nbsp; Balance and Beginning


 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Meryn didn&#8217;t waste any time in arranging a lunch meeting with Scott.&nbsp; She made a reservation for the next day at her favorite restaurant, making sure that she got the back booth, her privacy booth as she called it, away from the ears of other patrons.&nbsp; She had a knot of anxiety in her stomach for the entire morning at work.&nbsp; Scott had to be able to help her.&nbsp; If he didn&#8217;t have any ideas, she didn&#8217;t know what she was going to do.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When she arrived, he was already sitting in the booth, waiting for her.&nbsp; He immediately got up to greet her, allowing her to kiss him on the cheek, something he would never have had the presumption to initiate, but was touched that she did so.&nbsp; He then waited for her to slide into the booth to seat herself, before he sat down across from her.&nbsp; And waited.&nbsp; Without speaking.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I want to thank you so much for meeting me today, Scott.�&nbsp; She finally began.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Even if my Mistress hadn&#8217;t allowed it, I daresay I would have found a way to be here.�&nbsp; He replied, smiling.&nbsp; �Although it&#8217;s likely that that would have meant a little more Penance for me.�&nbsp; Quite a bit more, she thought bleakly, for such a major act of disobedience.&nbsp; �But it would have been well worth the cost.�&nbsp; he continued.&nbsp; �Fortunately, that wasn&#8217;t an issue.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m glad, and very appreciative.�&nbsp; She agreed.&nbsp; She then tentatively broached the reason for their meeting. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Do you know why I asked to talk to you today?� 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I know that you had a problem with Jeremy going to see you get your award at the gala&nbsp; rather than to his Board of Education meeting.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It was far more than that.�&nbsp; She retorted.&nbsp; �He was supposed to make an important presentation at that meeting.&nbsp; One that meant everything to his future.&nbsp; For everything he had been working so hard on.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I heard.�&nbsp; Scott replied.&nbsp; He took a second to collect himself.&nbsp; �You know, Meryn, everything with that turned out very well.&nbsp; His proposal was passed and funded by the Board, and everyone, especially the powers that be, know it was Jeremy&#8217;s ideas and work.&nbsp; And people thought it was incredibly generous of him to share the credit with his new assistant by allowing her to present it.&nbsp; He&#8217;s become quite the hero to all of the other teachers, who think he&#8217;s a fantastic boss to work for, for doing things like that.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Meryn sat there, dumbfounded.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t know that.�&nbsp; She said slowly.&nbsp; �When I asked, he just told me that his proposal had been accepted.&nbsp; None of the rest of it.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well, we both know that Jeremy is not one to toot his own horn.�&nbsp; Scott opined.&nbsp; �But I think it&#8217;s more than that.&nbsp; I think he&#8217;s still too ashamed to bring anything up about that night.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�But why?&nbsp; I forgave him almost immediately.&nbsp; I even did it that night.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Scott looked down, and then back up.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Though it&#8217;s always hard, it&#8217;s much easier for a slave to accept forgiveness for a mistake that made his Mistress momentarily angry.�&nbsp; He paused.&nbsp; �Disappointment, however, is far more difficult, even impossible at times, for a slave to deal with.&nbsp; It implies a failure that goes to the very core of his reason for being.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He saw her looking at him in astonishment.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�We slaves do talk, you know.&nbsp; Not in any detail, and never about anything truly private.&nbsp; But we do have to share our unique problems with someone at times.&nbsp; And we certainly wouldn&#8217;t and shouldn&#8217;t burden our owners with them.�&nbsp; He looked intently at Meryn.&nbsp; �Even when one of them might want to know.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I didn&#8217;t know.�&nbsp; She said quietly

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�While it is our choice, and the only one we are allowed to make, the life of a slave is not an easy one.�&nbsp; Scott smiled wryly.&nbsp; �Although I suspect it&#8217;s a lot more so for Jeremy.&nbsp; He has a much more benevolent Mistress.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She looked distressed.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Scott.&nbsp; I&#8217;m so sorry.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He laughed.&nbsp; �Oh, Meryn, don&#8217;t be.&nbsp; I wouldn&#8217;t have my life be any other way.&nbsp; And even though my Mistress still prefers to have me be her toady most of the time, that&#8217;s her favorite term for me now,� Meryn couldn&#8217;t suppress a small smile, �she has taken to kissing her frog to make him a prince more often now.&nbsp; To enjoy those aspects of him as well.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her smile now became broader.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It&#8217;s a matter of balance, Meryn.�&nbsp; He continued more seriously.&nbsp; �My Mistress and I are finding it for ourselves.&nbsp; As hard as I find it to believe, I don&#8217;t know if you and Jeremy have.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�But I treat him like a slave much of the time.�&nbsp; She protested.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That may be part of the problem.&nbsp; You treat him LIKE a slave.&nbsp; It may be that he needs to know that he really IS a slave.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�But he does everything.&nbsp; He does all the housework.&nbsp; He pampers me in every way imaginable, and caters to my every whim.&nbsp; And he sees in the most fantastic ways to all my ... ah ... other needs.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Those are all things he wants and loves to do.&nbsp; For you.&nbsp; They don&#8217;t make him a slave so much as a ... a ... � He grinned.&nbsp; �... as a lovemuffin.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Meryn couldn&#8217;t help but return his grin.&nbsp; It quickly faded.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What do I have to do then?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Scott took so long to answer, she began to worry that he might not.&nbsp; He had a faraway look in his eyes.&nbsp; Finally ...

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Impose your will.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He let that linger.&nbsp; Then repeated.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Impose your will, Meryn.&nbsp; Knowing you both, I suspect that when you and Jeremy disagree on anything, you both go out of your way to compromise.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m not sure that at this point that&#8217;s the best approach with him.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t mean common, everyday types of things.&nbsp; I mean something important.&nbsp; You need to impose your will on him on something you know he doesn&#8217;t want, but you do.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He paused, and then added softly.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Not something that might break him.�&nbsp; He shuddered slightly, and she knew only too well to what he was referring.&nbsp; He continued.&nbsp; �But something he definitely doesn&#8217;t want to do.&nbsp; By imposing your will, without regard to his concerns, his desires, you let him know he really IS owned.&nbsp; He really IS yours.&nbsp; And then he may really BE yours.&nbsp; In every way that you want.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Meryn took some time to digest all this.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What kind of thing do you think might work?�&nbsp; She finally asked.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Scott shook his head.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I don&#8217;t know.&nbsp; I really don&#8217;t.&nbsp; For all that Jeremy and I share a similar orientation, underneath we have very different desires and needs.&nbsp; I just don&#8217;t know what he would respond to.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He looked down at his hands, placed in front of him on the table.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Meryn, I don&#8217;t even know if I&#8217;m on the right track here.&nbsp; Problems in vanilla relationships are hard enough, even though there are lots of people that can be turned to for advice and support.&nbsp; In our world, the issues can be a lot more complicated and complex, and there are so few people with the knowledge, the experience ... people you can trust ... Meryn, I may be leading you down the wrong path.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Meryn stared intently at him, seeing the look of doubt and concern on his face.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No.�&nbsp; She responded slowly.&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t think so.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She reached forward across the table, and placed her hand on top of one of his.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Scott, I want you to know that, other than Jeremy, there is no one that I trust more than you.&nbsp; I am so very grateful, and extremely lucky, that you ARE my friend.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Scott didn&#8217;t answer, for the lump in his throat.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Meryn withdrew her hand.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Impose my will.�&nbsp; She mused.&nbsp; She looked him full in the face.&nbsp; Then smiled majestically.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You know, Scott.&nbsp; I believe I will.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Scott nodded, returned her smile, and bowed his head.


 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the days following her conversation with Scott, Meryn found that it was far easier to make her resolution, than it was to come up with an idea to implement it.&nbsp; She and Jeremy didn&#8217;t disagree on many things, and on those in which they did, it was usually very easy for either of them to compromise or acquiesce.&nbsp; There just wasn&#8217;t anything that she could think of that she would really want, that Jeremy wouldn&#8217;t want to give or do for her.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But she had to come up with something soon.&nbsp; He was withdrawing more and more into a shell, and although his work efforts, both outside and in the home, never suffered, she no longer saw a joy in it for him.&nbsp; He started making denigrating comments about himself that she found upsetting and unsettling.&nbsp; The worst came one night during his devotional, a ritual always sacrosanct to him, when he told her, only half facetiously, that she ought to go on to the web and trade him in, and her now useless prick, for a good vibrator.&nbsp; She had mildly rebuked him, which she immediately regretted when she saw the pain in his face, and the raw emotion that had brought on that comment.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ironically, it was that comment that put a seed of an idea in her mind that started to grow.&nbsp; In the early days of their marriage, as part of a night of frivolity, they had gone onto the web to a BDSM catalog site to investigate some sex toys.&nbsp; They had actually bought some, and used them from time to time.&nbsp; But there was one item that they had come upon that night that had intrigued, and even strangely excited her.&nbsp; But when Jeremy looked at it, he had immediately said �Oh God no�.&nbsp; Seeing the distaste in his face, she had quickly moved on, and forgotten it.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In reality, she hadn&#8217;t completely forgotten it.&nbsp; Every now and then, the image would pop into her thoughts and her pulse would quicken.&nbsp; She had never acted upon it.&nbsp; Her remembrance of Jeremy&#8217;s distaste, even revulsion, was enough for her to drive it out of her mind.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now, though, she brought in back to the forefront.&nbsp; She went back to the website.&nbsp; Could this be the item she needed to impose her will?&nbsp; It was clearly something Jeremy wouldn&#8217;t like, and would try to oppose, but which she, for reasons she couldn&#8217;t explain, was drawn to.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t think it would be something that would break him.&nbsp; But would it be too much?&nbsp; Would it be enough?&nbsp; She wrestled with indecision and doubt.&nbsp; But she had to do something.&nbsp; And soon.&nbsp; She geared up her resolve ... then clicked, and purchased.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once her package arrived in the mail, Meryn hid it away safely.&nbsp; It would not serve any purpose for it to be seen before the proper moment.&nbsp; Now she had to plan the how, and when of that moment.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As if by Providence, their second wedding anniversary was to occur later that week on Saturday.&nbsp; The first year of their marriage had been idyllic, as had much of the second.&nbsp; But over the last number of months, the difficulties managing their special relationship had progressively deteriorated to the point where they were now causing serious strain.&nbsp; Meryn knew that they hadn&#8217;t, and wouldn&#8217;t affect their love, but they were markedly affecting their happiness.&nbsp; It was as if Fortune had deemed that she should implement her plan on their anniversary, as if to mark a new beginning.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She put the first part of her plan in play that night during her foot massage.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Jeremy, in case you&#8217;ve forgotten,� which she knew he never would, �this Saturday is our anniversary.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He stopped his kneading and looked up at her, replying forlornly.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I didn&#8217;t think it would be anything you would want to celebrate this year, now that it appears that I really have become nothing more than your eunuch.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Don&#8217;t say that.�&nbsp; She cried.&nbsp; �Don&#8217;t ever say that.&nbsp; You&#8217;re my husband.&nbsp; You will always be my husband.&nbsp; In every way that will always be important to me.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She continued.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�And I do want to celebrate.&nbsp; And we will.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m going to tell you how.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She had his full attention.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�We&#8217;re going to stay home, and you&#8217;re going to make us the best dinner that you&#8217;ve ever made, with champagne and all the works.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She paused.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�And then I&#8217;ve got something very special planned for both of us.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jeremy felt as if he had a knife sticking in his stomach.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Meryn.�&nbsp; He began.&nbsp; �Do you really think that&#8217;s such a good idea.&nbsp; I mean the dinner&#8217;s fine.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll do my best for that.&nbsp; But after ... I mean ... you know I&#8217;m ... ah ... unable.�&nbsp; He hung his head.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh you WILL be able, believe me.&nbsp; This is going to be a new beginning for us.�&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He looked back up at her, and she stared straight into his eyes.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�And you will provide the enjoyment.&nbsp; Make no mistake about that.&nbsp; Do I make myself clear?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He nodded.&nbsp; There was no more to be said.&nbsp; She had spoken.&nbsp; In a way she had rarely, if ever, done so before.&nbsp; His continuing doubts and fears had to bow to obedience.&nbsp; Saturday, their anniversary, would be celebrated as she decreed.


 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For the rest of the week, they were both on pins and needles, Jeremy fearing his anticipated failure, and Meryn worrying herself almost sick wondering if she was barking up the wrong tree.&nbsp; What if imposing her will in this way served only to drive him further into despair.&nbsp; She realized that their marriage was at a crossroads.&nbsp; Though they had not voiced the words at their wedding, she knew she would always hold to the �For Better.&nbsp; For Worse� of the traditional vow.&nbsp; This had to work on Saturday.&nbsp; But if it didn&#8217;t, she would try something else.&nbsp; And something else again.&nbsp; And again and again if necessary.&nbsp; This was her man, and she meant to keep him.&nbsp; Under any and all circumstances.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For better.&nbsp; For worse.&nbsp; For ever.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By Saturday morning, Jeremy was resigned and resolved to try to make the day as special as his Wife and Mistress so much desired.&nbsp; He would do his utmost and pray that his efforts would not, in the end, be as doomed to failure as he feared.&nbsp; He spent the morning meticulously cleaning the house, and then the entire afternoon preparing the feast his Mistress had ordered.&nbsp; Meryn had gone out early, saying she had a few more items she needed to pick up for the evening.&nbsp; She also wanted to be out of the house during the day so her nerves wouldn&#8217;t be so apparent.&nbsp; She returned early in the evening.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jeremy greeted her at the door with a kiss that she melted into.&nbsp; Placing her packages to the side, he led her to her favorite easy chair, opened and poured her her first glass of champagne for the evening, and then fell to his knees to begin her foot massage.&nbsp; For the next hour, as he worked, they joked and reminisced about the many wonderful times and things they had shared in their three years together.&nbsp; It helped greatly to calm and comfort both of them despite the cloud that still hung.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was then time for their feast.&nbsp; The dining room was candle lit, and the table settings were with their fine china, used only for special occasions.&nbsp; Jeremy began by serving a black and red caviar crustini, followed by an appetizer of thinly sliced, sesame crusted rare tuna with a soy wasabi dressing.&nbsp; The soup that came after was Cioppino , a Portuguese fish specialty.&nbsp; Finally, the main course was two huge Maine lobsters, perfectly prepared, with tails and claws cracked open to provide easy access to the meat within, to be dipped into the drawn butter garnished with rosemary and thyme.&nbsp; As if there was room for more, the dessert, of course, was Meryn&#8217;s favorite, Jeremy&#8217;s own strawberry rhubarb tart, which she couldn&#8217;t help but finish.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As Jeremy cleaned up, Meryn sat in the living room, sated and sipping her third glass of champagne.&nbsp; Their celebration had been wonderful thus far.&nbsp; But now she had to refocus her resolve to proceed on with her special plans for the evening.&nbsp; There was no doubt that she and Jeremy deeply loved each other.&nbsp; She had to find the way for them to better live together.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t know if her actions tonight would lead to an answer.&nbsp; But there would eventually be an answer.&nbsp; That, more than anything, was her will that would be imposed.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lost in thought, she didn&#8217;t hear Jeremy come up behind her until he gently kissed the back of her neck.&nbsp; He then walked around to the front of her chair, knelt down in front of her, and offered her a small, gift wrapped box.&nbsp; Her breath caught in her throat as she opened it, and took out a heart shaped ruby pendant bordered by small diamonds.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Jeremy.&nbsp; It&#8217;s beautiful.�&nbsp; She whispered.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Not as beautiful as the one who will be wearing it.�&nbsp; He answered as he rose to fasten it on its chain around her neck, fitting perfectly at the base of her throat.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The time had to be now, or she would lose all ability to act.&nbsp; Steeling herself, she ventured forth.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�My Love.�&nbsp; She started softly.&nbsp; �I can never thank you enough.&nbsp; For this.&nbsp; And for everything you&#8217;ve done, and have meant to me from the beginning.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her voice hardened.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�But now, I have something very special planned for us.&nbsp; To mark a new beginning.&nbsp; From this point on tonight, you will do everything exactly as I tell you.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Always.�&nbsp; He replied.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Indeed you will.�&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She looked directly into his eyes.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I want you to go now and shower, and thoroughly clean yourself.&nbsp; When that is done, I want you to shave off every bit of hair from your body, except that on the top of your head.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His eyes widened.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�But Meryn.�&nbsp; He started to protest.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Is that the way you define &#8216;Always&#8217; slave?�&nbsp; She interjected sharply.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No.�&nbsp; He responded meekly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A pause.&nbsp; Then a continuation.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�After you&#8217;ve prepared your body like a newborn&nbsp; babe for our new beginning, you are to go into the bedroom, light all the candles, turn off the light, and then kneel upright and naked in the middle of the room, with your hands on top of your head.&nbsp; And wait for me.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jeremy could only stare at her, paralyzed into inaction.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Did I make myself clear?�&nbsp; She asked pointedly.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He nodded.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Then go!�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He went.


 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As he showered and washed, Jeremy could only ponder what all Meryn had in store for him this night.&nbsp; What he had heard thus far, he might not like, but he knew that he would do anything possible to not disappoint her.&nbsp; He knew despondently that it was what he could not do, that would again be the ultimate disappointment.&nbsp; For her.&nbsp; And in him.&nbsp;&nbsp; All he could do, and would, was to try to please her to the best of his ability until that point.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Toweling off after his shower, he began the next stage of his ordered preparation.&nbsp; He did not have much hair on his chest, arms or legs, but what was there, he quickly removed.&nbsp; Next came his underarms, and this proved slightly more problematic, but soon both were smooth and hairless.&nbsp; Finally, he came to his groin.&nbsp; Carefully, with scissors, he cut down to stubble his entire pubic area.&nbsp; Then, copiously lathered with shaving cream, he slowly shaved off the rest.&nbsp; Despite the sense of excitement and the thrill of submission he felt while doing so, he looked down in self disgust as his organ remained resolutely flaccid throughout.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This task finished, he entered the bedroom, lit the four candles, and turned off the light.&nbsp; He went to the center of the room, placed his hands on top of his head, and knelt down.&nbsp; And began his wait.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After ten minutes his arms began to ache.&nbsp; After twenty his knees, much more used to this position, began to protest as well.&nbsp; After thirty he had to furiously fight the urge to get up, shake his arms, and move around.&nbsp; He steadfastly refused to do so.&nbsp; He would not fail her in something as simple as this.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finally, after forty minutes the bedroom door slowly opened, and Meryn entered.&nbsp; In the flickering candlelight Jeremy saw that she continued to wear her ruby and diamond pendant.&nbsp; Below that, she wore only a black bra, black stockings held up by a garter belt, and black high heels.&nbsp; What completely captured his full attention, however, and made his heart hammer, was the item strapped around her waist and groin.&nbsp; Jutting forward ominously.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A eight inch black dildo.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finding his voice after several long moments of horror, as Meryn stood there in silence, Jeremy hoarsely forced out.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Meryn ... No.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Quiet, slave.� came the strong rebuke.&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t want to hear another word from you.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She slowly and sleekly strode over and then around him, inspecting her property, as he remained completely still under her gaze.&nbsp; She stopped in front of him, the black phallus inches from his face, as she looked down on him.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You are going to give me great pleasure tonight, Jeremy.�&nbsp; She began in a low, husky voice.&nbsp; �And in a way that I have wanted for a very long time.&nbsp; Who knows,� she continued, �you may even enjoy it yourself.�&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She paused.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�But you WILL please me.&nbsp; As you&#8217;ve pledged your life to do.&nbsp; Whether you like it or not.� 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Except for a slight tremble, Jeremy remained very still.&nbsp; Meryn then spoke again.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I want you draped over the side of the bed.&nbsp; With your legs spread as wide as you can.&nbsp; NOW!�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With every fiber of his being, Jeremy wanted to refuse.&nbsp; But there was no mistaking the tone of command in her voice.&nbsp; And he knew in his heart, he could never disappoint her again.&nbsp; Slowly, with great trepidation, he crawled over to the bed, climbed halfway up the side, bending over it at the waist, spreading his legs, and positioning his ass, up and inviting ...&nbsp; For her use.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Meryn walked over behind him, and kicked off her heels.&nbsp; This was going to require balance and leverage.&nbsp; She applied a liberal amount of lubricant to her dildo from the tube she was holding.&nbsp; As she began to apply even more to the area between his buttocks cheeks, he flinched violently.&nbsp; She realized how terrified he was of his coming violation.&nbsp; But there was no turning back.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I suspect this is going to hurt some, Jeremy.&nbsp; You are a virgin at this after all.�&nbsp; She began.&nbsp; �I will try to go slowly, and it will be easier for you if you try to relax.&nbsp; But I AM going to take you.&nbsp; And you ARE going to take it.&nbsp; All.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With that she directed the tip of the phallus to the center of his behind, and began to push.&nbsp; As the tip entered, he made no sound, but she saw him firmly grip the covers on top of the bed.&nbsp; She continued to press forward slowly, and his grip became tighter, and he began to rub his face into the bed.&nbsp; As she reached halfway, a low pitched groan escaped from his throat, and she began to experience a very strange and exotic sensation.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She continued to inch forward, and his low groan became a grunting through gritted teeth, as she felt a tightness and vibration in her own groin.&nbsp; With two inches to go, Jeremy&#8217;s breathing became ragged, and he began softly beating his forehead into the bed as Meryn began to rock back and forth as well as push.&nbsp; She was beyond caring.&nbsp; Abandoning caution, she drove forward with one final surge to totally bury the device deep within him.&nbsp; As it filled him completely, his neck and shoulders arched back, and a continuous, guttural growl issued forth from his clenched mouth.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You&#8217;re mine, Jeremy.&nbsp; You&#8217;re totally MINE�&nbsp; She exulted.&nbsp; �FOREVER�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fully impaled, Jeremy had never felt ... So Possessed ...&nbsp; So Owned.&nbsp; And, as Meryn withdrew, and bid him stand up, to his utter amazement as he looked down, he had never been ... So Aroused.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�My, my.�&nbsp; She cooed, smiling appraisingly, her eyes twinkling, as she observed it as well.&nbsp; �It certainly looks like you enjoyed that a lot more than you let on�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As he stood there, rock hard and swaying, Jeremy wondered frantically if his Mistress was going to grant him relief.&nbsp; He had never felt this in need.&nbsp; He was like a rutting animal.&nbsp; Worse, a rutting slave.&nbsp; Should he ask?&nbsp; Should he beg?&nbsp; And, if refused, would he ever bring himself to take?&nbsp; His shudders at the negation of that thought, that he would even entertain it, joined the pulsing in his groin that was driving him to a frenzy.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Meryn broke through his delirium.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I took you and totally used you tonight, Jeremy.&nbsp; For my pleasure.&nbsp; And I want you to know that I will take you and use you again.&nbsp; Any time, any way, any where that I want.�&nbsp; She paused, and then continued forcefully.&nbsp; �BECAUSE YOU&#8217;RE MINE.&nbsp; AND ALWAYS WILL BE.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She unstrapped and took off the dildo to reveal nothing on underneath.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�But I need you to know, My Love,� she continued much more softly, �that what I take, I will always give to you to take back.&nbsp; Because THAT also pleases me. �&nbsp; Her eyes misted, and she added, barely above a whisper.&nbsp; �Because I&#8217;m yours.&nbsp; And always will be.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With that, she walked past him, handing him a tube, bent over the side of the bed, and positioned herself exactly as he had been.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jeremy stared at her in disbelief.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Meryn ... No.�&nbsp; He stuttered.&nbsp; �It will hurt you too much.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�This is the only way you will have me tonight, Jeremy.�&nbsp; She answered.&nbsp; �It&#8217;s your choice.&nbsp; But I really need you to take me ... Please.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His need was also too great to be denied.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He looked at the lubricant in his hand, but decided he had a much better one to use first.&nbsp; He knelt down behind her, cupped her cheeks in his hands, and gently pulled them apart to reveal her glorious nether orifice.&nbsp; He had worshiped with his tongue at the alter of her anus many times before, but this time with a new purpose.&nbsp; He drove his face and tongue forward, darting it in and about her opening.&nbsp; He could taste as well as smell the musk of her arousal as her hips began to sway with the rhythm of his lapping.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t long before she could stand no more.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Take me Jeremy!&nbsp; Take me now!�&nbsp; She pleaded.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He rose and rapidly rubbed the lubricant onto his purple and ramrod stiff manhood.&nbsp; He applied some between her cheeks as well, and then guided the head of his shaft to her hole.&nbsp; She was ever so tight, but he was far too hard to be denied.&nbsp; As he invaded her vault she gave an involuntary gasp.&nbsp; He pressed his onslaught urgently, and she began to whimper.&nbsp; He didn&#8217;t know if it was in pain or pleasure.&nbsp; As he drove forward forcibly against the vicelike grip of her sphincter, her whimpers became cries, more clearly now of pain.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He immediately started to pull out.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�NO.�&nbsp; Meryn cried in a strained voice.&nbsp; �Don&#8217;t stop ... I want it ... I want you, Jeremy ... I want it ALL.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That desire made eminently clear, Jeremy lost all restraint.&nbsp; With a snarl of almost savage satisfaction, he thrust forward with all his might, filling her fully, and eliciting even louder cries of pain/pleasure.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;These cries merged with his cry of triumph as he surged inward, and poured forth his essence into her in ever increasing spasms, that felt like fire to them both, but produced for both the most exquisite ecstacy.&nbsp; Their cries became screams as he continued to thrust back and forth, on and on, until they became hoarse, and finally, gloriously, spent.&nbsp; They collapsed, exhausted, into each other&#8217;s arms on top of the bed.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gripping him tightly, Meryn buried her face into Jeremy&#8217;s chest with quiet sobs of pure joy.&nbsp; She murmured his name, and her love for him over and over, as he gently stroked her hair.&nbsp; Slowly, contentedly, her hold loosened, and she drifted peacefully into a blissful sleep.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jeremy gazed adoringly at her face, so serene in slumber.&nbsp; Her beauty, as it so often did, took his breath away.&nbsp; But her real beauty, the part that had touched ... no ... that had captured his very soul, lay within.&nbsp; He knew now, as he never had quite before, that they were true soulmates.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And the key part of that word, he now realized, was mate.&nbsp; Meryn had taken him tonight, and would take and use him again.&nbsp; In any and all ways that she desired.&nbsp; But she had given herself back to be taken by him as well, and promised him that this would always be so.&nbsp; She would always be his Mistress, and he her slave.&nbsp; But he now understood that she needed so much more from him.&nbsp; She needed more than his worship, service, love, and devotion.&nbsp; She needed his protection.&nbsp; She needed him to share in the burden of her leadership. And, at times, to lift it from her completely.&nbsp; To allow her to rest.&nbsp; To have time to be vulnerable, secure and confident in his care.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He would bear this burden happily as long as she needed, but he would always yield the power back.&nbsp; That would always be hers to wield as she saw fit.&nbsp; But he would become the leader that she wanted, so that she could be proud of him.&nbsp; Always in the outside world.&nbsp; And whenever she needed it from him in private.&nbsp; This would make his ultimate gift of his complete submission to her so much more valuable and worthy of her.&nbsp; He would strive to be the best of whatever she wanted and needed him to be:&nbsp; Husband, Lover, Partner.&nbsp; Best Friend and Protector.&nbsp; But he knew that underlying it all, the very foundation, as she had&nbsp; shown him this night:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He would always BE her slave.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As he held her in his arms, he continued to gaze at her.&nbsp; Enraptured.&nbsp; On this night of their new beginning, he silently vowed to her to be all of this and more.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For as long as he drew breath.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For Her.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His Goddess.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His Woman.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His Eternal Beloved.
