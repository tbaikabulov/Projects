Don�t worry about
doing great deeds,

Worry about doing
good ones,

History will decide
if it is good enough to be great

����������������������������������������������������������������������������������� 

����������������������������������������������������������������������������������� The
Path of Man

&nbsp;

It is good to be a man.

&nbsp;

�������������� The thought came unexpectedly to Kiki Frings, but he can�t help but agree with it. Hard to argue when you are enjoying life like this. Kiki looked down at his two naked cows, Kim and Elena. Kim is blond; she also has huge size D tits which Kiki has pierced with 2 silver nipple rings. Her follow cow Elena however has black raven hair; small sized A tits and no piercing. Kiki loved the contrast between the two and right now both females have only one thought in their minds. To please their master. 

&nbsp;

Elena was
sucking his cock while Kim was licking his balls. Elena was a natural at cock-sucking.
She could deep throat the whole cock without gagging; something Kim was unable
to do. What she lacked in ability however, Kim makes up for in enthusiasm. She
was licking his balls slowly but always made sure that she covered every spot
with her tongue. She also was very careful about his pleasure, making sure that
Kiki enjoyed the experience. All in all, Kiki has to say that they work well
together.� 

&nbsp;

It is good to be a man.

&nbsp;

����������� The
thought came again as Kiki lay his head on the pillow. They were on his giant
bed in his quarters. Not for the first time Kiki felt regret in agreeing for
the mission. Still what�s done is done. Enjoy the time while you still have it.
Kiki looked at the 2 cows again and made his decision. �Elena, animal
position.� He said. Both cows looked at their master with smiles on their
faces. Elena then turned around and placed her face on the bed. She kneed and
put both hands on her ass cheeks. With her ass in the air, she pulled her ass
apart showing her anus to Kiki. Kiki kneed behind her. Kim then placed both
hands on Kiki�s cock and direct it Elena�s asshole. If she was disappointed
with his decision, Kim hid it well. 

&nbsp;

�Your cow is ready Master.� Elena
whispered. 

Kim looked at Kiki and repeated,
�Your cow is ready Master.�

&nbsp;

����������� Kiki
placed his hands on Elena�s hips and slowly entered her. A small moan came from
the cow. With a steady rhythm, Kiki began to plumb her. With all the attention
earlier, it did not take long for him to feel like cumming. He thrusts became
faster, then faster and more violent. Cries came from Elena; Kiki then grabbed
her hair with both hands and pull her in as he thrusts. Elena cries turned into
screams. It was a huge turn-on. Kiki pull harder, faster� then he felt the
pressure. He was going to cum. He resisted, pulling and thrusting in frenzy.
Elena�s screams got louder. Kiki ignored it totally, who cares about the pain
of a female. Then he came. Kiki pulled out of Elena immediately and slapped her
ass. Elena turned around again and opened her mouth. Without a second thought,
she placed her mouth in front of her master�s cock. Kim came and placed both
hands on the cock, directing it to Elena�s mouth. Kiki released his cum right
there. Spent, Kiki lay down on the bed again. Kim went down on her master�s cock,
using her mouth to clean the shit and juice off it. Kiki looked at Elena. The
cow�s mouth was still opened, dutifully showing a mouthful of cum to her
master. Kiki looked at her for a few second. Something about seeing his cow
with a mouthful of his cum always gets to him. Finally he ordered, �Swallow.� Elena
swallowed in one big gulp. She has been well-trained. 

&nbsp;

It is good to be a man.

&nbsp;

����������� The
thought came again. 

&nbsp;

�I�m leaving for Planet Dembang
in a few days,� he said. Both cows looked at him in surprise. �I�ve made
arrangements with Abrams. You two will be staying on his farm while I�m gone. I
expect you to work your ass off while you�re there.� Both cows looked at him
with concern; it�s well-known that his brother works his cows hard. Kiki
continued, �This means no complains from Abrams. Fifty strokes of the whip on
your ass for each complain I hear from him. You hear?� 

�Yes Master,� both cows replied.

�Good.� Kiki felt sleep coming.
�Now get off my bed.�

�Yes Master� 

Both cows slide
off the bed onto the floor. Kiki always follow one rule in his bedroom, �Humans
sleep on beds, animals slept on the floor.� With that, he closed his eyes and
fell into a blissful sleep. 

&nbsp;

Planet
Dembang is also known as the Dark Planet. This is because all the men on the
planet are black, while all the women are white. At 18 months old, all the
newborns on the planet undergo skin augmentations. Male babies have their skin
darken to midnight black, while female
babies have their skin lighten to a white as clear as snow.

The Outer Planets, the Lost Terran Empire 

����������������������������������������������������������������������� Published
in Year 8024

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Planet Dembang is known as one of the most beautiful planets
known to mankind. Kiki Frings could understand why. As the sun rise, the whole
sky slowly turns from darkness to a gorgeous bronze. The bronze sky is in
direct contrast to the yellow grasslands that filled the planet; truly a
breathtaking sight to behold. 

&nbsp;

�Beautiful,
isn�t it?�

&nbsp;

����������� Kiki turned to the man who spoke.
Ray Umaga is the Cultural Minister of Planet Dembang and the man who invited
him to see the sunrise in his house. As part of the Patriarch Alliance
delegation to Dembang, it was an invitation Kiki can�t refuse. Kiki looked at
Ray Umaga and liked what he saw. A tall strong man, Ray Umaga has his hair
styled in the dreadlocks that is the fashion in Dembang. One look and you can
tell that he was a former soldier, and why the Alliance
wanted Dembang as an ally.

&nbsp;

�Yes
it is. Dembang is every bit as beautiful as its reputation Minister.�

�I
thank you for the praise.�

&nbsp;

����������� The minister then raised his hand
and a female came forward with a tray. The minister poured 2 cups of coffee,
handing one cup to Kiki. As Kiki gave his thanks, the female stepped back,
joining the other female at the corner of the room. Kiki looked at the 2
females and wasn�t surprised with what he saw. Both females were wearing a
white corset with a long white skirt that reaches their ankles. A long slip in
the front of the skirt shows you the panties they were wearing. Each was also
wearing a white bra that supports their tits, but Kiki can clearly see the
nipples as there was a big hole in each cup. Both females also had their very
blond hair tied in a neat bun and they, like all females in the Outer Rims were
barefooted. Kiki could also see that the 2 females were wearing different
panties, one red, and the other blue. 

&nbsp;

�The
color of the panties shows their rank right?� Kiki was careful to ask the
question in an offhanded matter.

�Yes.�
The minister answered carefully. �Red panties show that the female is a wife
while blue shows that she is a concubine.� 

�Is
there a difference?�

�A
wife can only be fucked by her husband, while a concubine may be shared with
friends. Different from the Alliance
isn�t it.�

�Yes
it is,� Kiki agreed. �In the Alliance,
a female can only be fucked by her master. We seldom share.�

�Here
on Dembang, the custom of sharing a concubine is considered a great honor.
Something that�s only done between true friends.�

�A
difference in culture then. Something we have to share when Dembang joined the Alliance.�


The
minister looked at Kiki for a few seconds then asked, �You truly believed this
will worked? The Patriarch Alliance wants Dembang to join them?�

�Yes.
The Alliance currently only has 3
planets; Whiteside, Thordaw and Kadir. Considering the danger we are all in, we
need each other.�

&nbsp;

����������� Ray Umaga sat back and ponders on
the situation. Kiki knew what he was thinking. The Terran Empire had attacked a
planet in the Outer Rims 3 months ago. They were still fighting, but sooner or
later the Terran will win. Then they will case their eyes over the rest of the
Outer Rims planets. Alone, none of the independent planets has a chance against
the Empire, but together they may. That was why the delegation was on Dembang.
The Patriarch Alliance may be the biggest force in the Outer Rims but Planet
Dembang has the most powerful military. With the Alliance
resources and the Dembang power, they would then try to convince the rest of
the planets to join them in opposing the Empire. Of course, that�s easier said
than done.

&nbsp;

�The
Patriarch Alliance is an economic alliance. Why would King Unbei want to join
with you?�

Kiki
was ready for this question. �The Alliance
has resources Dembang cannot get. Energy, crystals and raw materials that
Dembang do not have and quite frankly have no chance of getting. You may have
the most powerful military in the Outer Rims, but it is next to nothing
compared to the Empire. By sheer numbers, the Empire will win in any war in the
Outer Rims. Only together will the Outer Rims have a chance.�

�And
that�s the problem!� Ray stated. �You want to get all 13 planets in the Rims
together. That is just not possible. Although we all follow the Laws of Nature
that states that men are superior to females, we are just too different!�

�Differences
that can be overcome.�

�On
Planet Zilan, gays rule over lesbians. On Planet Endar, females are called
ponygirls. Even in the Alliance,
you consider females to be nothing but animals. Here on Dembang, we consider
our wives and concubines to be prizes. In return for their servitude, men must
protect and provide for them. No man on Dembang would consider their wives to
be animals, and I must add that homosexuality is a crime on Dembang. How can we
possibly work together with such differences?�

Kiki
was ready for this question as well. The answer was ready very simple. �We must
work together because we have no choice Minister. Do you truly want to be
cloned?�

&nbsp;

����������� That shut the minister up. Even the
2 females at the corner looked very uncomfortable. When humans first started
conquering the stars, they faced a huge problem. That was numbers. Exploration
came so fast that there just weren�t enough men to develop existing planets and
continue explorations at the same time. The problem was solved with cloning.
Men were worked to their death on the planets, and when they died, a new clone
would be used to replace them. With such an endless number of workers, working
conditions on the planets fell like a stone. Why spent money on safety when
it�s so much cheaper to just clone another worker. Men were born knowing that
they would be lucky to survive till they were 30; and when you died, you died
knowing that another you would be used to replace you. Generations and
generations of such slave labor were used to man the planets. So when the
Walien Theocracy first arrived in the Outer Rims in 7816, the aliens found a
population that was more than happy to back them against the Terran Empire. And
when the aliens outlawed cloning as an �un-natural act�, alien invaders became
alien liberators. �Now over 200 years
later, the aliens have withdrawn and the Terrans were back.

&nbsp;

�We
do not want to be cloned, but still�all 13 planets together in one alliance is
an impossible idea.� The minister sighed. �Even in the Patriarch Alliance, with
just 3 planets, you have problems. Just try to imagine what will happen with 13
planets?�� 

�I
myself am from Planet Thordaw,� Kiki said. �There are things on Kadir and
Whiteside which I don�t agree with but these are things I can tolerate because
each planet has their own culture.� Kiki continued, �And we are stronger
together than we are alone. King Unbei does not want to lose power by joining
the Alliance. We can understand
that. The people of Dembang do not want to lose their independence by joining
the Alliance. We can understand
that also. But the deal is one you have to take because if you do not�you will
lose everything to the Empire.�

The
minister was quiet again. Finally he said, �I will take your advice to His
Majesty on the matter.�

&nbsp;

�Marrying a female is
like buying an animal,

You can ride it and
beat it whenever you like&quot;

&nbsp;

The Path of Man

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

����������� It�s strange sleeping without his
cows. Kiki lay on the bed and realized how much he misses them. He half thought
of calling his brother on Thordaw to see how they were doing, but immediately
dismissed the idea as unworkable. Not only will it show weakness to his cows,
Abrams may be insulted by his queries. Kiki knew why he misses them of course.
He had stayed the day with Ray and saw how he interacts with his females.

&nbsp;

����������� As a monk, Kiki was with the Alliance
delegation as a sort of cultural officer. As such, he had the most contact with
Ray Umaga. They had exchange stories and knowledge, giving each other the do�s
and don�ts of each culture. That was why Ray had invited Kiki to stay at his
house in the city; to show him how a family works in Dembang. Surprisingly,
there wasn�t that such of a difference. Like in the Alliance,
the cooking and cleaning of the house were done by the females, and not by
robots. The females also serve their master hand and foot like in the Alliance.
There were of course some differences. 

&nbsp;

Kiki couldn�t help but remember the biggest one. It was the
end of the day. Ray had invited Kiki to see the summaries. As informed by Ray,
the summaries were a report given to the master of the house by the leading
female of the house. The report consists of the work done by all the females in
the day and what mistakes they have made. Punishments will then be handed out
for the mistakes. Females are openly encouraged to spy and tell on each other.
Kiki was sitting in a chair beside Ray feeling very uncomfortable. In the Alliance,
females are openly encouraged to work together to serve their master better.
The direct opposite of how things are done on Dembang. The 2 females of the
house were kneeing before them. Ray�s wife then informs him of their day�s
routine. So far, nothing unusual. Then, the wife informs Ray that she was
having her period. In the Alliance,
females were given surgery to rid themselves of their troublesome periods. This
is something that isn�t done on Dembang. What happened next was what was truly
shocking to Kiki.

&nbsp;

�Show
me.� Ray said. His wife stood up and lowered her panties to her knees. The
female then took a red leaf out of her panties and showed it to her master. 

Kiki
couldn�t help but asked, �What�s that?�

Ray
answered. �It�s a bang leaf. Those leaves you see on the grasslands; this is
one of them.�

�Those
leaves are yellow.�

�Yes,
the leaf can absorb a lot of liquid. After absorbing all the blood of the
female, the leaf will naturally turn red.� 

�I
see.� Kiki nod his understanding.

&nbsp;

����������� Ray then turned to his wife and
ordered, �Eat it.� His wife folded the leaf in half and then put it in her
mouth. By the time she finished eating; Kiki�s mouth was already on the ground.
To hear Ray says it, making females eat their own blood is a great way to show
them their place in the world. The females were already greatly embarrassed by
their periods, and found the act of eating their own tampons as it was an
incredible humiliation. Almost all females cry the first time they do it and
they must do it every time they have their periods. Even thinking of it now,
Kiki can�t help but feel unease. This is something new and quite frankly, Kiki
found the act very offensive. But he was in no position to argue with the
minister as there�s no shortage of female humiliation in the Alliance.


&nbsp;

����������� Kiki remembered the last Thordawan
wedding he presided over. As a monk, Kiki had presides over many weddings
before but this one was special. It was the wedding of his nephew Boris and his
Terran bride. Kiki had been surprised when his brother Abrams agreed to the
marriage, but with the increased tension between the Alliance
and the Empire, Abrams decided that it was better to marry the two before the
shooting starts. 

����������� Kiki was standing on a platform in
the Temple of Manhood.
In front of him, sat the men of the Frings family; at the side, the females of
the family were kneeling on the ground. The ceremony starts when the first ray
of sunshine hits Thordaw. A big gong in the temple sounded the sunrise. 

&nbsp;

����������� At the sound of the gong, Boris
slowly walked towards the platform from the back of the hall. Boris was in a
black and white tuxedo. In his hand was a leash; a leash that was connected to
a collar that was around the neck of his bride. Jenny crawled behind Boris on
her hands and knees naked saved for the collar. Slowly they approached the
platform. Once they reached the platform, Jenny went to her knees while Boris
stood tall and proud. Kiki started the ceremony.

&nbsp;

�By
the stars and the laws of nature,� he intoned, �we are here today to grant a
petition from a man of honor. Who request the petition?�

�I,
Boris Frings, request a petition from the Temple
 of Manhood.� Boris solemnly
answered. �I am to take this female as my cow.�

Kiki
gave Boris his best piercing stare. �Do you, Boris Frings, promised to provide
and care for this female. To treat her as the animal she is, in accordance to
the laws of nature and the laws of the Patriarch Alliance.� 

�I
do�

�What
is the animal�s name?�

�Her
name is Jenny.�

Kiki
turned to Jenny and asked, �Do you, Jenny, promised to serve and suffer for
this man. To give yourself as an animal to this man, and acknowledge him as your
man and master.�

�I
do.� Jenny was careful to keep her head down as she answered.

�You
are an animal�

�I
am�

Kiki
turned back to Boris and said, �Prove that she is an animal.�

Boris
turned to Jenny and ordered. �Cow, piss yourself.�

Jenny
opened her knees apart. A second later, a steam of piss came out of her. Jenny
stayed on her knees, soaking in her own piss.

Kiki
told Boris, �Prove that she is your animal.�

Jenny
raised her head towards Boris and smiled. Boris smiled at his bride and then
gave her a right cross to the head. Jenny was staggered from the punch but
managed to keep on her knees.

�One.
Thank you Master, please give me another.�

Another
right punch to the head.

�Two.
Thank you Master, please give me another.�

The third
and last punch knocked Jenny to the ground. Slowly, the cow got back to her
knees. She raised her head, showing off her bloody nose. �Three. Thank you
Master.�

Boris
extended his right hand to his bride. Jenny immediately started to lick the
hand that bloodied her.

Boris
turned to Kiki. �She is my cow.�

Kiki
turned to the men in hall and asked, �Is there any man here who disagree with
this marriage. Say it now or forever hold your peace.� As expected, no one
objected. Kiki turned to Boris again. �You may baptize your animal.�

Boris
opened his pants and showed his cock to his bride. He said, �I named you Stupid
Slut.� With that, Boris releases his piss onto Jenny�s head. Jenny kneed there
quietly as the piss flowed down her head and body. Finally, the piss stopped
and Boris put up his pants.

Kiki
then handed a toh-gan to Boris and said, �You may cover your animal.�

����������� The toh-gan is a loose fitting grey
robe that covers the body till the hands and knees. There is also a hood that
could cover the head. It is the only clothes that a married female may wear on
Thordaw. Boris took the toh-gan from Kiki and covered Jenny naked body with it.

Boris
intoned the chant, �With this cloth I, Boris Frings, named you mine. You are my
animal. You will show this body to no one but me.�

�I
am your animal.� Jenny repeated.

Boris
then took the hood and covered Jenny�s head. �With this hood I, Boris Frings,
named you mine. You are my cow. You will show this head to no one but me.� 

�I
am your cow.� Jenny said.

Boris
then took the thick steel mesh that is connected to the hood and lowered it. It
totally covered Jenny�s face. With the steel mesh, you can�t see the female�s
face, not even the eyes. �With this mesh I, Boris Frings, named you mine. You
are mine; mind, body and soul. You will show this face to no one but me.�

Jenny was silent. An animal do not speak in public unless
given permission by her master. Kiki looked at the new cow. With the toh-gan,
he cannot see her face, body or tits. All he sees were her hands and lower
legs. A faceless drone, a faceless animal in the service of her man and master.
Time for the final part of the ceremony.

�Do
you Jenny accept this man as your master? Will you give your mind, body and
soul to this man and accept him as your superior?� 

�I
do. My mind, body and soul is his.�

�I,
Kiki Frings, by the powers invested in me by the laws of nature and the
authority of the Patriarch Alliance named Boris Frings the master of Jenny of
Frings.� Cheers and applauses came from the men. Kiki waited for it to die down
before continuing, �The cow will wait here. The master will enter the Temple
 of Manhood.�

&nbsp;

����������� With that, the ceremony was almost
over. Kiki followed Boris and the rest of the men into the temple for food and
drinks, to celebrate the occasion. The females of the family kneed in a circle
around Jenny. They sang songs to her. In some ways, this is the most dangerous
part of the ceremony. Thordaw is a hot desert planet. The new cow is to knee
there in her master piss, under the hot sun, in her uncomfortable toh-gan till
her master is finished with the celebration. This would be at sundown! So
basically, the cow must knee on the platform from dawn to dusk. Needless to
say, some cows would faint from the ordeal. If they do faint, they would be
left there till sundown when their master comes for them. The songs are needed
to keep the cow�s spirits up. Of course, the songs sang to the cow were all
appropriate to the occasion. Songs such as �Kneeing by my Master� and �I am
Dirt�, songs that enforce the cow�s position in life. Still, the men�s
celebration was something to remember. With drinks and a new cow in the family,
Kiki and the rest of the men were all in a great mood. With that pleasant
thought, Kiki went to sleep.

Sports
for men in the Outer Rims are surprising similar to sports in the Empire. Sports
for females however are a different thing. Sports for females in the Outer Rims
must have one of 3 things. Humiliation, Pain or both! Needless to say, no
respecting Empire women will play the sports of the Outer Rims.

The Outer Planets, the Lost Terran Empire 

����������������������������������������������������������������������� Published
in Year 8024

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

����������� �Kiki sat down on one of the seats in the
stadium. The Dembang government has kindly invited the Alliance
delegation to a sporting event. Of course, the delegation agreed to attend and
all the members were present. A huge roar came from the crowd.

&nbsp;

�I�m
surprise they take such games so seriously here in Dembang.� 

&nbsp;

����������� Kiki looked at the man who spoke.
Senator Jonas Lim is the leader of the Alliance
delegation. A tall man with blue eyes and black hair, he is an intelligent man
from the Law Enforcement caste and a senator of the parliament for Thordaw.
However, he knows next to nothing of other planet�s culture and thus is easily
surprised at some things.

&nbsp;

�Actually,
female sports are very popular in the Outer Rims.� Kiki explained. �In the Alliance,
we consider these amusing games but on other planets, they are considered
sports.�

�How
is this �sport� played again?� Jonas asked as he looked at the centre field.

It�s
a good thing monks are known for their patience as this must be the seventh
time Kiki had to explain it to someone in the delegation. �A metal ball is
inserted in the females� pussy. The idea is that the female will use her virginal
muscles to force the ball out.�

�And
the female with the furthest distance win the competition?� The senator asked.

�Depends
on the event! Some event is for the furthest distance, others for accuracy. A
ring will be placed on the ground some distance away, the female must force the
ball out and placed it in the middle of the ring. Whoever gets it closest to
the middle win?��� 

�And
there�s money to be won on this?�

�Money
goes to their masters of course, but it is serious business. Men exactly
married females on how well they play the sport and this is but one of the
female sports. This is called body control, there are others like pony-girls
racing, dog wrestling and pigs� eating. All very popular on some, or in some
case, all of the planets in the Outer Rims.�

Jonas
looked at the near naked contestants and shook his head in amazement. �I can�t
imagine men from Thordaw agreeing to let their females go naked in front of the
world.�

�You
might be surprise at that, especially if there�s a lot credits involved. Men
from Thordaw might have problems but I doubt men from Whiteside and Kadir will
have any problems with this.�

The
senator looked at Kiki strangely. �You almost sound like you approved of these
�sports�.�

Kiki
agreed. �If it helps the planets forge a closer bond, why not? We already have
the Rims Olympic Games for men, why not an Animal Olympic Games for
females?�� 

Jonas
was shock at the suggestion. �A female Olympic Games?�

�Sure.
Of course, nothing likes football or basketball for men but female sports like
pony-girls racing, dog wrestling and pain-management. It will be something that
belongs only to the Outer Rims; I doubt the Terrans will send anyone to these
Games.�

&nbsp;

The senator looked thoughtful at this suggestion, clearly
seeing the benefits of the idea. Kiki decided to use the chance to ask the
questions he wanted answered.

&nbsp;

�How
did negotiations go with King Unbei, Senator?�

The
senator�s face darkens at the question. �Negotiations imply that there�s a
middle ground both side wants to reach! This is not the case with the king.�

�The
king believes that the Empire will not attack the Outer Rims?�

�Oh,
even better than that!� Kiki could clearly hear the anger in the senator�s
voice. �He thinks that the war will never reach Dembang. Dembang is on the far
side of the Outer Rims and the king thinks that the rest of the planets,
including the Patriarch Alliance, will fight off the Terrans before they reach
Dembang. Of course, Dembang will be more than happy to send their mercenaries
armies to fight against the Terran Empire. Provide we pay them the going rates,
which of course will be higher then due to heavy demand.� 

�Well,
greed is considered a virtue here on Dembang.�

�Not
when your own way of life is being threaten. I have managed to convince the
prince and most of the Dembang government, but in a monarchy, only the king�s
word matter.�

Kiki
was disappointed to hear this; Ray seems to have failed. �So there�s no hope?�

The
senator said. �I still have 2 days, then we have a farewell parade and then
we�re gone.����� 

�Then
we have 2 days! There�s still a chance.�

The
senator shook his head, �Not unless the king dies tomorrow.�

&nbsp;

����������� The hologram is one that will be
shown for decades to come; showcasing the bravery of the men in the Patriarch
Alliance. The parade started simple enough. Two lines of females walked down
the street. Tall, white and blond, the beautiful females walked in two prefect
rows. As they walked, they threw petals of red flowers onto the road. Then came
the float and the crowd roared! The king was on it, sitting on a golden throne
in the middle of the float. The Alliance
delegation stood behind the throne, soaking up the cheers from the crowd. On
one side of the float, the prince and Senator Jonas were engaged in a
discussion. Then, King Unbei waved and the crowd went crazy. Security officers
and robots on both side of the road fought to keep the crowd away from the
float. Then, a female broke from the crowd and ran towards the float. A
security officer grabbed the female from behind, stopping her from reaching the
float. Laughter came from the sides of the road and King Unbei smiled. Then,
the female threw something onto the float. No one knew who did it but someone
shouted �BOMB�. The item landed in front of the throne. The hologram clearly
showed the senator bravely shielding the prince with his body, the people on
the float jumping away from the bomb�and the king sat rooted in his seat. There
was no chance. The king will die; then a body flew cross the float. The brave
soul covered the bomb with his body; the bomb exploded. The king was injured
but he survived; the prince was unharmed; and the monk, Kiki Frings, became a
legend in the Patriarch Alliance!�

The Path of Man

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

����������� Ray Umaga, Cultural Minister of
Planet Dembang, walked carefully behind the king. King Unbei walked slowly in
the palace garden, not yet fully recovered from his injuries 6 days ago. Prince
Uyake walked on the other side of the king. 

&nbsp;

�Any
news on the female?� the king asked.

�No,�
the prince replied. �The brainwashing was too through. The poor girl can�t even
remember where she is from, much less who put her up for the assassination.� 

The
king nodded. �What does her DNA says?� 

�She�s
from Planet Whiteside.�

The
king stopped in his tracks. �She was sent by the Alliance?�

��Impossible!� This was the first time Ray said
anything but in this he was certain. �Kiki Frings gave his life for the king
and Senator Jonas himself shielded the prince! They were here for an alliance,
why would they send an assassin?�

�They
didn�t.� Prince Uyake replied.

�Explain,
my son.�

�DNA
confirmed that she is from Whiteside,� the prince said. �But the Alliance
keeps very good record of its� citizens, even the females. She was reported
missing 5 months ago by her father.�

�And?�

�We
found the shuttle that bought her to Dembang.� The prince looked at his father
carefully. �The space shuttle came from the Terran Empire.�

King
Unbei stayed silent for a second before asking the inevitable question. �You
are sure on this?�

�We
found the shuttle leaving orbit and after some �persuasion�, the captain admit that
he came from Terran space.� 

�The
captain?�

�He
knows next to nothing. He brought a group of females in on an illegal slave
run, just his luck the Empire decided to send an assassin on board.�

�You
are sure the captain is innocent?� 

The
prince nodded. �He no longer has use of his right arm.�

The
king was pleased with this news, �And of course the Terrans had covered their
tracks.�

�Nothing
we can proof, though if the assassination was successful�� No need to finish
that sentence.

�We
would think that the Alliance were
the culprits.� The king looked at Ray for the first time, �What about you?�

Ray
gave the king a formal bow and answered, �Negotiations were very successful
Your Majesty. The formal signing will be on August 9th on Thoradaw.
On that day, in the year of 8056, Planet Dembang will be a formal member of the
Patriarch Alliance.�

�Good.�
The king nodded. �And the monk�s family?�

�Kiki
Frings has 2 cows and�� The minister never finished.

�Cows?�
The prince asked.

�Yes,�
Ray answered. �On Thordaw they called their wives and concubines �cows�.�

The
king smiled indulgently, �There are some things you still have to learn Uyake.
Please continue Ray.� 

�He
has 2 cows and 3 sons. All 3 sons are grown and have their own careers. The 2
cows are being taken care of on an energy farm owned by Kiki�s brother Abrams.�

�What
about the compensations?� The king asked.

�The
3 sons all received the compensations already but there�s a problem with the 2
cows. Credits to the 2 females will be given to their master but with Kiki�s
death, they no longer have an owner.�

�What
about the brother?� The king felt a large debt to the monk for saving his life.

�He
is taking take of them, but unless he married them, he is not considered their
master.�

�Masterless
females.� The prince shook his head as he said it. In the Outer Rims, there is
no worse fate for a female.��� 

�How
many wives does the brother have?� the king asked.

�3�

�The
men in the Alliance can have 5
wives right?� Ray nodded as the king asked. �Advise the brother the credits are
his if he marry the 2�cows. No, better yet, double the compensations to the
brother if he agrees!�

Ray
warned, �That�s a lot of money Your Majesty.� 

The
king stared hard at the minister, and then answered, �The monk saved my life,
and the least I will do is take care of his family.�

Ray
bowed his acceptance. 

&nbsp;

����������� Together, the 3 men looked at the
clear bronze sky. A new day has arrived, the Patriarch Alliance has a new
member and the Terran Empire will be made to pay for the death of a brave man!

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Patriarch Alliance

Planet Thordaw; New Dawn City

����������� The senator sat on the chair in
front of the President. Jonas Lim was slightly injured in the �attack�, but the
pain was nothing compared to the sick feeling in his stomach.

&nbsp;

�They
suspected nothing?� The question was asked by the President of the Patriarch
Alliance. Gilberto Nakamura is in his third year of an 8 year term,
unfortunately for him; his term is right in time for a war with the Terran
Empire.

�Nothing.�
Jonas continued, �They will find that the cow is from the Alliance,
and then upon further inquires, they will find that she was coming from the
Empire. It will look like the Empire order the assassination and then tried to
frame us for the deed.�

�Good,�
President Nakamura had not been a fan of the plan from the start, but really
there�s not much choice in the matter. The Alliance
needed Dembang. �Couldn�t have work out any better!�

The
president was smiling, the senator wasn�t. �Unfortunate that a brave man like
Kiki had to die.� He said. 

�Yes,
it was.� The president answered. �The plan was for the king to die and you to
save the prince. Still, maybe it�s better this way. Kiki Frings is now a
legend. They are replaying the holo-clip of the parade all over the networks
and King Unbei is very grateful.�

�Still,
his death��

�Will
not be for nothing!� The president was smiling as he says this. �The Alliance
is now stronger due to his sacrifice! Together, we will have a chance against
the Empire.�

Jonas
nodded. Some truth can�t be denied. At his nod, the president continued, �The
Dembangs gave us their reply on the names.�

The
senator asked, �Names?� 

�Yes.
Females are called cows on Thordaw; pigs on Whiteside and worms on Kadir. We
thought it would be best if the females of Dembang are given a name as well.�

�Oh.�
Jonas found himself intrigued by this. �What animal did they pick?�

�RATS!�
