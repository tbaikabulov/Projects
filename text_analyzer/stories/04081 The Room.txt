Synopsis: Guy kidnaps a women and turns her into his willing slave






THE ROOM



She lay helpless on the cold cement floor.There was no light,&nbsp; no sound, no nothing.She tried to move but very soon found her arms handcuffed and also her feet.She tried to move from side to side and also found that was no good as it appeared that she was attached to the floor in some fashion.She was unsure how long she lay there.She had very few memories of how she got here.The last thing she knew for sure was that she was coming out of work at the bank.She had worked very late on the books and it was quite dark when she left.The security guard offered to walk her to her car but she told him not to bother, said goodnight and walked to the parking garage to go home.She was just getting to her car and had dropped the keys as she tried to find the door key.Then a very brief moment where it seemed something was across her face,she tried to breath and felt her legs give out.She knew nothing more of how or why she now lay in this place but she was very scared.



A single light came on from directly above her,blinding her.As her eyes became used to the light she looked around and her heart sank and the pit in her stomach grew very tight.



A voice spoke from it seemed nowhere and everywhere,"Good evening Nora" was all he said.

She tried to speak but had a very bad taste in her mouth.All she could get out was "Where am I?"

For a long time nothing happened and then he spoke again,"In Hell" was all he said and the light turned off.

She started to scream "who are you,why am I here please let me go" but slience was all she got back.



His name was Bill.He was 35 about 6 feet tall with just a bit of extra around the middle but nothing much,,just a bit of padding.He had brown hair,blue eyes,and always thought of himself as not bad looking but knew he was no Tom Cruise or Harrison Ford.That was ok&nbsp; with him because he thought that looking like that seemed to have more troubles then it was worth.



He was never married,had no kids and just a few friends but they were close friends.He had a very good job and all that came with that,a nice house,car clothes,and was never worried about how the phone bill or the gas bill would get paid.He had had a few women in his life.All he cared very much for and they seemed to care very much for him but something always led to them breaking up.They got bored with him or found something better them him because he liked to stay home and read or watch science programs on tv or use his compiter to search the internet for things he found that held some sort of interest to him.That had lost him a few women in the past.He didnt like going to the clubs or things like that as he did not drink or "party" like most men his age.Because of this his relationships never lasted too long.He was quiet,did not like the fast pace it seemed everyone was always going so he again was alone.



His parents&nbsp; were gone now,They had him late in life and they had no other children.That to was ok with him.They always cared for him, never abused him and he was always well fed,clean and had a roof over his head.He had always done well in school,Made the top of his classes but never really did anything except clubs like the chess club or the science club.Put that all together and what did you get-a nerd-the only thing he did not have was the pocket protector and he would have been the poster child for for the geek squad.Collage was almost the same way .He always did well but never did much to loose the nerd image.He had studied computers as at that time they were just getting started so he got in on the ground floor.Back then in collage you had to be rich to have a computer in your home but now all you needed was a desk and a phone connection and the world was yours.He turned the knowledge he gained back then into the&nbsp; solid job with great pay that he had now.Every so often he would make a slient prayer to "God" or as&nbsp; he was known to mortal men--Bill Gates--thanking him for how things had worked out.



He was no stranger to sex.He had lost his cherry to the&nbsp; girl in high school who took care of the audio-visual room,Yes, he was in that club too. It was two lonely scared kids groping&nbsp; each other trying to find out what it was all about.She and him were together for junior and senior year but she got accepted to a good collage out west and they kept in touch for a while but then even that stopped.He had dated a few girls in collage but it was always short lived.



The one thing in his life that he was never good at was asking girls out,He got rejected so many times and in so many ways that if you were to count them all and store them you would need a computer that was capable of running the Space Shuttle--by itself.



Some where nice when they said no-some were not.He could hear the smirks and the gossip they shared back and forth about him and it always hurt.It hurt more then anyone knew,His friends. family, co-workers could never even begin to understand how he felt.They knew nothing of the times he spent crying softly to himself because some girl had turned him down,The long sleepless nights he stared at the ceiling and wondered why they had to be mean to him or why the world was like this.He&nbsp; had asked God&nbsp; many times to find him someone he could love and some one who loved him right back.When he&nbsp; thought he had found that special someone and it broke apart he sank deeper and deeper into himself&nbsp; until what remained was something so dark inside him that if anyone knew the&nbsp; thoughts he had locked up in his mind&nbsp; they would lock him away and never let him see the light of day&nbsp; again.



It had started about 15 years ago.At first it was small,renting bondage videos or looking at sites online that catered to his thoughts.He kept it locked up so very tight inside him no one would ever expect what kinds of images he had going on inside his mind.It stayed that way for a few years,every now and again he would rent a video or see things online and he would release the anger and pain with masterbation and the demons would be safely locked up again.But that would only keep him in control for so long.He was getting more movies and downloading&nbsp; more often and the time he could keep control was growing shorter and shorter. The things that got him off became more violent and disturbing until he had grown a large collection of stuff stored on his harddrive and a huge video stash hidden away in the back closet.



Images of women being raped,tortured, killed.After a while he would masterbate to thoughts he had about acting out those things in real life.The more violent and brutal thoughts he would have the harder and faster he would achive climax.Soon not a day went by he didnt jack off to thoughts of him acting out his plans in real life.



Then it began.

Chapter 2

&nbsp;

It began with
thoughts on ways to act out his ideas in real life.� How could he do the things he was thinking
without getting caught? How could he do these things without getting hurt or
killed? His first thought was he would have to do things here at his home. No
one ever came by except the mailman and the UPS guy when he got another tape or
DVD. But he could not take a chance. What if someone did come by?� He could not have some women hanging from the
ceiling and screaming in the front room for the entire world to see and hear.
So how would it be done?� He had a garage
but that posed all the same risk as the house. He had a basement but again the
risk was just too high. Then as he was watching TV--The History Channel-- he
saw it--a bomb shelter. Yes! That would be the ticket. He could hire people to
build him a bomb shelter in the basement and all anyone would ever think was he
was just another crazy guy with too much money and not enough brains. He could
draw the plans himself. That way when they were working he could control who
saw what and when.

&nbsp;

He would have
several sets of plans made. One set to show the workman. One set to show the
city so he could get the building permits. And of course one set that would
show the real reason for all this work. He had months of vacation time coming
to him because he had never had a reason to use it so he could be home and
supervise all the work. He could keep using the crazy guy with money angle when
it came to the finer points of the construction. When asked why they had
installed a drainage system under the floor he could respond, &quot;In case of
flooding&quot;. When asked why a shower and toilet was installed he could say,
&quot;in case of an attack by the crazy middle easterners he may been down there
a long time&quot;. When asked why it was being made soundproof he could answer,
&quot;In case they ransack my house and I make too much noise and they find
me&quot;. When someone asked why he had Internet wiring and sound and TV wiring
he could say, &quot;So I can be able to see the news and know when it was safe
to come out&quot;. And he never had to answer why the door was hidden behind a
sliding wall--they would guess that one all by themselves. All these things
would have a simple reason for being there--after all you never know when
&quot;the big one&quot; might happen--it was perfect. When all was said and
done he was just another nut with a lot of money and an over active
imagination.

&nbsp;

The work had
taken 3 weeks to complete and when it was all over he could not have been more
pleased. But now he needed to test it. His first test was simple--sound. He
brought down his stereo- a rather large and expensive one and turned it on full
blast with Beethoven's 9th -4th movement playing -walked out and closed the
hidden door. Not even a whisper. One down. Next was the toilet and shower. He
used the toilet several times and ran the shower all seemed to work just fine.
Now he checked the TV and sound. He brought down a 25&quot; TV hooked it up and
all was good. He checked the sound system. He had placed 4 speakers in the four
corners of the room and ran the cords out thru the wall into the regular
basement. Again Mr. Beethoven helped out and when he was in the room it was
fantastic--out of the room not a note could be heard. Then it was time to test
the Internet connection. He brought down the notebook computer hooked it up and
in less then a minute he was online.

&nbsp;

He had of course
had a completely independent power source installed, which ran on its own
batteries. That little piece of the plan was the most expensive part of this
whole thing. It was quiet as a mouse and had a 72-hour running time, which
could be extended with good conservation use. He even had the drainage system
drain some 500 yards away from the house and hidden in case someone searched
for it. Nothing was left to chance. From the outside you would never know it
was there.

&nbsp;

Now it was time
to add his own touches. He made plastic covers for all the things inside. The
TV, speakers, computer, icebox and where covered with two inch sheets of clear bulletproof
plastic and made with self-locking systems which could be opened or closed by
his computer outside the room. On the walls and ceiling he put in eyebolts
every few feet and they were sunk six inches inside the cement. You would need
a small army to get them out. On the ceiling again incased in unbreakable
plastic he mounted a garage door opener and rigged the cable through some of
the bolts along the ceiling and down one wall with a collar at the end. When
released the cable would allow movement to anywhere in the room. When activated
it would bring &quot;whoever&quot; back flush against the wall. He even tested
it on himself. No matter what he did when he pushed the button he was dragged
back to that spot on the wall. If he tried to hold on to something the pull of
the opener was too great and he almost passed out from the collar digging into
his neck.

&nbsp;

He made it so the
notebook computer could only receive incoming signals and never send outgoing
ones. There was no way a person without more knowledge them him on computers
could make that machine send anything to the outside world.

&nbsp;

His last task was
to install the one-way mirror and the computer system, which would control
everything. From the desk outside he would have complete and total control of
everything in that room. Lights, sound, temp. It was fantastic.

Chapter 3

&nbsp;

Now that the where part was taken care of he needed the
&quot;who&quot; part. He started by just driving around. Seeing if there was
someone who caught his eye. He had seen a few that were sort of what he was
looking for but so far no one had fit the whole package. He was looking for
someone special. She would be 5'5'' or under, skinny, long dark hair, and a
smoker as he had just a bit of a smoking fetish. She would be 30 or under,
never married and had no kids. Those were the guidelines and he would not settle
for anyone else.

&nbsp;

When he saw someone that met the looks department he begin
to follow her, study her. Thru his computer skills and a few well-chosen web
sites he got all the info he could on her. Public records were a very good way
of getting info on someone. Was she married or had she ever been? Were there
any children? Where did she work and what did she do? Did she have loads of
outstanding debt? What did she drive? Was it a piece of crap or something new?
Were she and only child? Where did her relatives live? 

&nbsp;

Most of his prospects failed the investigation. They were
married or had kids and that was something he did not want. Some had shit jobs
and had tons of credit bills and people like that where always found by the
people they owed.

Some had drug problems and some wanted by the police. If he
wanted he could have made a very good buck turning them in. Some had too many
relatives living in the area. In short he wanted someone like himself. Someone
who was alone, well off in the cash department, smart, and had very few or no
long lasting contacts with the rest of the world. Someone who could disappear
with little or no notice.

&nbsp;

He was driving late one night in a town a few towns away
from his and just by sure luck he saw her. She was walking out of a large bank.
She was walking alone to the parking garage across the street. She was
beautiful. She was about 5'2 must have only weighed 120lbs wet, had shoulder
length dark hair and was smoking what looked to be a long white 120.She was
walking kind of slow but smoking very fast as it seemed it had been a land time
since she last had one. He almost had an accident when he saw her; He pulled
over and waited next to the exit of the parking garage. As it was late he was
fairly sure hers would be the next car leaving-he was right. He very quickly
wrote down the make, model and silence of her car as she pulled out.

&nbsp;

He hard a hard time driving home without speeding, he had to
get to his computer to begin her investigation. He got home and very fast
booted up his computer. As he had done so many times before he hacked into the
department of motor vehicles and typed in her plate number. Her name was Nora.
She lived in the same town as the bank. From the counties public database he
could find nothing telling him she was ever married. He then sent the same
inquiry to the surrounding counties and again found no marriage cetificate.
Nora was looking better and better. With her date of birth from the DMV records
he began his search for her birthplace. In the local hospitals he found
nothing. No one matching her last name as far back as 35 years ago. He then
sent out a statewide search and again found nothing. He tried sending out a
search to the surrounding states and it was almost 2 days before he found what
he was seeking. She was born 27 years ago in small hospital two states away.
From the local public database there he could find no other births matching her
parents name. She was an only child.

&nbsp;

He then started on her credit report. If people really knew
how easy it was to find out info on someone by someone who knew what they was
doing they would never leave the house. In short order he found she had A1
credit. Only had 2 credit cards, which she used only rarely, and both were paid
in full. My Nora--you impress me more and more. He looked at the state and
local police public information sites and found nothing. Not even a parking
ticket in the last 5 years.

&nbsp;

He had gotten all he was going to get from the computer. Now
it was time to watch her. Since all of his subjects had not passed the computer
tests he found himself so excited he had to tell himself to slow down .The
first test was to find out if she lived alone. He drove to her house. It was a
nice two-story brick house in the upper scale side of town. Very late one
evening he parked his car two blocks away and walked to her house. When he got
there he quickly hid in the bushes and set up a time-lapse camera, which was
set to take a picture of her front door and garage, every half hour for the
next 48 hushed had trouble sleeping and working the next 2 days before he got
back the camera. He quickly developed the pictures and found that she left
early in the am and got home late every evening. No one besides the mailman
came or went from her house but her in the entire 2 days. She lived alone.

&nbsp;

Now he was really started to get excited. Next was watching
her. He would park a few houses away in the early am and would follow her to
work at the bank. He was lucky, he could come and go from work at anytime and
none would say a word. She stopped every morning at the Starbucks across from
the bank and bought coffee. One morning he was already inside to see just what
kind of coffee she liked. She would come out to the smoker�s area at regular
times to smoke--always alone. If there where people already there she would go
down the block or into the parking garage to find privacy�s always seemed to
work late, At least past 5 like everyone else. She would stop at the local
market almost every night to buy dinner and cigerettes. Seemed Nora did not
plan much or maybe she just hated shopping. She would arrive at home and from
peeking inside her window a few times she worked at her computer or would read
a book before turning in at a reasonable hour.

&nbsp;

He had gone thru her garbage one night, Lots of empty
microwave dinners and lots of empty cigarette packs. He was right. Virginia
Slims 120's non-menthol.

One day he made a very bold move. Using the skills he had
learned thru an Internet blacksmithing course he picked the back door while she
was at work.

Her home was very orderly. Some might even say a bit anal.
There was no mess anywhere. The closets where nice and tidy, everything hung or
put into some storage container. The kitchen was clean enough you could have
eaten of the floor. The icebox was almost empty except for some milk and juice.
The freezer was empty. The bathroom was just as clean. She even put the
toothpaste top back on and rolled it up from the bottom. Her music collection
was top notch and of course all cud�s were put back inside the cover. It was
mostly classical with a bit of modern jazz and tucked away in one corner was a
Led Zeppelin cadges she had to work out some tension from time to time. The
bedroom was last. The bed was made and looked like it was never used. It took
some time but he finally found it-a small bullet vibrator and some lube. My
God-she even had spare batteries in the same drawer!

&nbsp;

It had taken 2 months of computer work and watching her
before he made up his mind. She was the one.













Chapter 4



She woke up.She was lying on what felt like a cement floor.She tried to move but found her hands were handcuffed.She tried to stand but her feet were tied as well and it seemed she was somehow fastened to the floor.She had no idea how long she was lying there when a single bright light came on above her head.Ittook her a few minutes to get used to the light.as she did she began tolook aroud and her heart sank and her stomach turned into 1 giant ball.

She tried to speak byt had&nbsp; avery bad taste in her mouth."Where am I?"

She managed to say.She heard nothing.Again she said it.And from what seemed like everywhere she heard a man's voice."

"Good Evening Nora".

"Where am I"?

"In Hell" was the answer and the light turned off.She began screaming-"Who are you-where am I--what do you want"?Silence was all she got in return



The act of getting Nora proved to be much easier then he expected.He simpley waited in the parking garage under a car until he heard someone coming.Since she had stuck to her daily routine and had worked late at the bank and most other people were already gone all he had to do was wait and watch.He had inspected the garage and made sure there where no security cameras or regular checks made by the bank security staff. It made getting her almost to easy.He waited until she arrived and sliently came around in back of her.She just had dropped her car keys when in one swift motion he put the cloraform on her face.She made a very brief struggle but then she fell like a sack of potatoes.He very quickly picked her up and placed her in the trunk of his car and quietly left the parking garage.He drove the 60 miles back home,parked inside his garage and carried her to the room.



He fastened handcuffs to her and tied her feet.He then used the I Bolts in the floor to fasten her down.Then he left the room,closed the hidden door and waited.

She woke about 2 hours later.He used the infrared camera he installed to watch her.After a few minutes where she had tested the bonds on her she spoke.

He threw on the overhead light and watched her jump.He answered her question and turned out the light.For what seemed like an hour she screamed and struggled to get free but to no use.He watched as she settled down and again turned on the light.She began to scream and struggle again.He opened the door and for the first time see saw who had done this to her.She screamed and sturggled at him calling him names and saying the usaul stuff like let me go or you will spend the rest of your life in jail.He walked to her and from behind his back produced a long metal stick,looked at her screaming and fussing and touched the rod to her stomach."AAAAAGGGHHHHH" was all she could say as wave after wave of pain shot thru her body.After a minute he removed the rod and she lay twitching on the floor.

"This is your standard cattle prod Nora.It has several settings and the shock you just recieved was the lowest one.Now listen very carfully to me-DO NOT SPEAK-- until I give you permission,Now by a simple nod of your head let me know you understand"

Again she started screaming and struggling against her bonds.He looked at her yelling at him and he very slowly put the switch on the prod to level 2 and touched it to her side

"AAAAAAAGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHH" she yelled as loud as she could as more pain rammed thru her body.Again after a minute he stopped.She could not control the spasms her body was having and she jerked this way and that on the floor.

"Now Nora" he paused-"I know you are a smart women and I hope you realize how very long and painful for you this could be--As I said--DO NOT SPEAK--until I give you permission--nod you head if you understand".

She looked at him with a stare that could have scared the Devil but then very slowly nodded her head.

"Good--I see we have understanding.Now let me explain the basic rules.You already know the first one so in a minute I am going to release your bindings that are holding you to the floor.You will do nothing unless I tell you to do so-Do you understand?"

A small nod.

"Good.When I release you from the floor i am going to help you stand up at which point I will answer some of the questions you have.Nod if you understand".

Another small nod.

He put down the prod and released her from the floor .As he was helping her up she swung her cuffed hands at his head catching him on the side and making his ears ring.He let her drop to the floor and moved back from her.He was holding his ear and pulled his hand away to find a small amount of blood on his hand.He goes over to the shower area and gets a towel to hold to his head.Then with&nbsp; a small smile on his face walks over to her and picks up the prod-turns up the power one more notch and very slowly lowers it to her side.She starts screaming and crying and moving away from him as best as she can.The prod touches her side and the pain rams thru her body like nothing she has ever felt before.Her muscels tighten up and her body goes rigid and she is lying&nbsp; there gasping and unable to breath as the electricity corses thru her.After what must have felt like forever she starts seeing stars and passes out.



She woke to a hard ,stinging slap across her face.She jumped and her vision clears and she see him standing in front of her.She very quickly looks around and finds herself naked.She is sitting on the concrete floor with her back striaght up against the wall.Her hands are are straight out to her sides and secured to the wall.Her legs are tied.He sees that she is aware and sits down in a chair in front of her.Her body feels like she was hit by a train and her head aches.There is a small bandage on his right ear and for a very brief second she smiles.

He touches some kind of device on his belt and her right hand falls free from the shackel.He walked over to her,places a bottle of water by her and an fresh pack of Virginia Slim 120's and a lighter and ashtray and returns to his chair.

"Now Nora I believe you remember rule 1--no talking--and I trust we wont have need for me to demonstrate what happens when we break rule 1--Do you understand"?

A small nod

"Good--you may have a cigerette and some water,I am sure they will make you feel a bit better".

She opens the water and takes a long pull.She thens reaches for the smokes,noticeing they are her brand.and lights one.She takes a very hard drag and does a very slow exhale before another long drag and slow exhale.

He asks"Please toss me the lighter".She does and he lights his own cigerette .

He takes a drag and starts talking,"Well,we got off to a bit of a shacky start ther didnt we.The hands to my head was a nice move"

She says nothing as she continues to smoke her cigerette.

"Let me try to answer some of the questions you have running thru your head.First,my name is Bill,Second where you are is about 200 miles from the bank in a very remote part of the state.Next you are in a specilly designed bomb shellter,It is soundproff,waterproof and escape proff,and last why are you here--you are here to pay for the sins of all women.This shellter was constucted about 50 feet underground.Now you will notice the things in this room.It has been furnished with most of the modern things in life.Over there you will find your sleeping area.It is a genuine stardard US ARMY cot.I even got you a pillow.Next over in that corner is the batroom facilites.The shower is a working one for you to bath.Over here we have an icebox which is filled with food and will be refilled when needed.On the other wall you will notice a tv--with cable no less.And next to it you will see a notebook computer with internet connection.And By the way--it is set up ONLY to recieve,It cannot send so trying to send an email or anything else you can think off is not possible.I have it monitered at all times so please dont even attempt to send anything.You wont like what happens if you do.And lastly you will notice the collar around your neck.It is hooked up to that garage door opener on the ceiling.It has enough cable for you to reach the whole room.You are free to use all the things in this room.I even put in a sound system.There is a list of music avilable next to it.Just push the button with the corresponding number.And as a final instuction when you see the lights flash in this room you are to move over to where you now are as three seconds after the last flash the door opener will begin to retract and you will be pilled to that spot.Understand everything so far?"

A small nod

"Good--now you have permission to speak--I will answer one and only one question".

"Why ME?"

"Thats simple--Because"

He tosses the lighter back to her-gets up and leaves the room.Ten seconds after that the light goes out and she is left alone--naked--scared--and crying.





'















chapter 5



He had left her alone in the room for two days.He watched her thru the one way mirror.She slept,eat some fruit from the fridge and used the computer.Thru its connection with his computer he was able to see what she was looking at.She started by scanning the news papers from the town where she lived.She found several stories about a missing bank bookkeeper and the search for her.She started to cry when the story read that the police had no leads.He already knew that as he was keeping up with the investigation.Later she watched some tv.She was watching some corny soap operas.During those first two days he made no attempt to speak to her or show her any sign that he was there.He kept the room temp at a comfortable setting and had made the water and shower available to her.



Then it was time.In the middle of the night as she lay sleeping he flashed the room lights 3 times.She did not awaken.Then he hit the switch on the garage door opener.She started to be pilled from the bed towards the wall.She awoke with a scream and her hands came up trying to lossen the collar.She remembered what she had to do.She went over to the wall and waited.The wench stopped as she was standing agaisnt the wall and could not move anywhere.He opened the door and walked in.She had fear in her eyes but she remembered rule 1--no talking.

"Put your hands in the shackles".

She complied

He hit the button on his belt device and both shackles closed around her wrists.

She had started to shake a little from the fear.He walked up close to her and removed a pair of leather gloves like the kind used by drivers.He started directly at her as he put on the gloves.He made sure the were on all the way and tight around his fingers.With no warning his first blow landed on her face.He had slapped her very hard with his open hand.Her head moved from the force and she let out a scream.He began to slap her face One side then the other over and over again.She was crying and screaming.He did this non stop for almost ten minutes.Her cheeks were bright red and had already started to bruise before he stopped.Her head lay limp and she was sobbing.Again withn no warning her gave her four punches in the stomach.Her head came up as he heard the whoosh of air leaving her body.She was now staring him right in the face as she spit and sputtered trying to catch her breath.He then attacked her face again,landing slap after slap ,watching her head move back and forth.She still had not caught her breath so all she could do was stare at him with a look of terror in her eyes.He was being very careful not to cause and lingering damage to her but yet the beating continued.Again he hit her stomach and her kidneys in rapid time before returned to deliver more blows to her face.He could see she was almost ready to pass out and he then delivered a kick in her groin.Her eyes rolled back in her head and she slumped down in her bonds.



He left her there unconscience and left the room.He went outside to the control panel and he played back the tape recording he had just made.He took of his pants and pulled out his dick which was harder then he had ever been. In less then a minute he had the most powerful cum of his entire life.He came so hard the semen flew 5 feet from where he was standing and then he could no longer stand and fell to the ground still seeing stars.He rested for a few minutes,then hit the release for the shackles and the garage door opener and Nora fell to the floor unmoving



She lay still for almost 30 minutes before starting to stir.She didnt move much as he was sure she was in great pain.Her face was a mess.Both sides were all puffy and black and blue.She curled up into a fetal ball and was softly crying.But tonight was not yet done.He reset the temputure to 55 degress and put in a cd of the loudest headbanging music he could find and set the volume to its max and flipped the switch.She jumped as the roaring sound filled the room and she ran from one end of the room to the other trying to get away from the noise but it was no use.Soon she slumped to the floor and held her hands to her head and started to shake from the cold.He left her like that the rest of the night as hed went upstairs made himself a nice meal,eat,took a shower and then went to bed,falling alsleep very quickly.



He woke in the morning felling well rested,dressed made some coffee and then headed downstairs to see Nora.She had not moved from the spot last night and was lying on her side shakeing.He looked at her face and it had swelled a great deal from last night.It looked like both of hers eyes had swelled shut and he could see just a faint bit of blueish hugh to her skin from the cold.He sat down at the control center,turned off the music and reset the temp to a more comfy setting.When the music stopped she raised her head and looked around the room but he could tell she could see nothing,Thru the intercom he told her he was coming in and if she did anything at all to upset him he would begin on her where he stopped last night.He went inside and she cringed back from him as she heard him get near.

"Stop that and stay still".he said as her picked her up .

"Do you need to use the toliet?"

She nodded her head and he placed her on the toliet and soon heard her release her bladder.

"I am going to put you in the shower"he told her."Brace yourself" he said as her turned on the water.She arched her back and let out a wail as the water hit her but soon she calmed down and he washed her body.

He then removed her from the shower,dried her shivering body and placed her on the cot with a blanket.She again curled into a ball and fell asleep















chapter 6



It had been two days since the beating.She had moved from the cot only long enough to use the toilet.He had watched her most of the time waiting for some sign that she was coming back to reality.Still she made no move.He flashed the lights giving her signal to move to the wall.She saw the lights flash and pulled herself over to the wall as she had not wanted to be dragged there by the wench.He turned on the wench and the slack came out of the line.He entered the room.He walked over to her and using his hand examined her face.She made no move to try and stop him.He saw that the swelling was going down somewhat and she could now see out of her left eye.He removed a needle from his pocket and a small vile of fluid.She saw this and stated to cry.

"Stop that,this is a vitamin shot,you have not eaten for 2 days and I dont want you getting sick ok?"

She just nodded her head very unsure if she believed him.He gave her the injection and rubbed the spot where the needle went in.

"See--nothing to get upset about".He went back out of the room and returned with a table and chair.On the table he placed a large bottle of water with a straw and again put her brand of cigerettes on the table and then he sat in the chair.

"Please feel free" he said.

She picked up the water and straw and had a very long drink.He could see her winch in pain when the cold water had hit a sore spot inside her mouth.

She then tried having a cigerette but when she tried to light it her hand was shakeing to much.He was unsure if this was from pain or the lack of nickotine as it had been several days since she had one.

"Here let me help you" as he lit the lighter for her and she took a drag.He then sat back down in the chair.He was just looking at her as she smoked and had some more water.

"Can I get you anything?"he asked after a few minutes."You may speak"

"Aspirans"was all she said."

"Of course-I should have thought of that myself" he said as left the room for a minute and returned with some Tylenol.He put the bottle on the table and sat back down.

"Nora,please put the lighter back on the table".She looked at him for a quick second and reached behind her head taking the lighter from her hair where she had tried to hide it and placed it on the table.

"Thank you" was all he said.He helped her open the Tylenol and made sure she took only 3.She took the medicine and a long drink from the water

"Thank you"she said very meekly.He nodded his head and noticed she was staring at the cigerettes."Please help yourself" he told her as she took another 120.Again he helped her lite it.

"Is there anything else I can get you?"he asked

She exhaled a long thin stream of smoke and paused"You could let me go"

He smiled a thin smile and said"Well is there anything besides that?"

She said nothing."Well I guess I will let you rest then" he said as he stood up.He again noticed her start to cringe away from him.He moved the table over by the cot and left the cigerettes and lighter and water on the table.He started to walk out of the room then stopped."When you are done with the light press this switch and it will go off".Then as the smile left his face he looked directly at her and said"When you are a bit more recovered will can discuss the hiding of the lighter.I will be back tomarrow to give you another shot and some more Tylenol"and he left the room



He watched her from the outer room after he left and she was staring at the door with a single tear running down her cheek.

He returned the next day and again gave her a vitamin shot and gave her a fresh pack of cigerettes.He also gave her a few more Tylenol and noticed the swelling had gone down more.He refilled the icebox with more water and turned to leave.He asked her"Anything else?--You may speak"

She looked at him for a minute and in a very small voice asked"What do you want of me"

"I want you to break" was all he said.He walked over to her standing by the wall looking directly at her."I am going to break you Nora-I am going to turn you into nothing but a mindless slave whose only thought will be to make me happy"he said as he leaned closer&nbsp; to her face

She started to cry."Would you like to discuss the lighter now or wait till you are a bit more up to it?"She just stood there crying.

"Why dont we take care of it now that way I wont forget"He pressed a button on his control pad and the overhead wench started to go slack as Nora sank to ger knees.He stopped the wench allowing her only a foot or two to move.He undid his pants and lowered his underware to the ground.She began crying more.He took his cock in his hand and with careful aim started to piss all over her.She tried to cover her head with her hands but he grabbed a handfull of hair and pissed directly on her face.He finished pissing as she sank back to the floor.He pulled up his pants and walked from the room leaving her in the puddle of his piss.







 









chapter 7



He let her sit in the puddle of piss all night.Next morning before work he checked on her.She was leaning aganist the wall where he had left her.It appered she was awake.He hit the switch for the lights 3 times letting her know the wench would go on soon.She stood up and leaned by the wall as he turned on the switch for the wench. She stood up as he&nbsp; went into the room.

"Good Morning Nora" he said.She did not say anything as she knew the first rule but looked at him with a combonation of fear and hatred in her eyes.He looked back at her with a slight smile on his face."Your arms in the shackles please".She complied.He hit the button for the shackles to close.He walked over to her."I see the swelling is going down more,good" refering to the beating he had given her 4 days ago."How is the pain-you may speak"

"It still hurts" she sad meekly.

"Well I will leave you some more tylenol when I leave".

"I will leave you some soft foods to eat,and please do eat Nora because I dont like giving you the vitamin shots too often."

"I am going to go now,I will leave the shower on for you to use,you smell just a bite ripe and then you can rest today".He turned and started the shower for her making sure she had soap and some towels.He hit the button to release the shackles and left the room.

He hit the button for the wench to release and watched her go to the shower,testing the water and got in rubbing hard and fast&nbsp; on her body trying to clean the piss off of herself.She washed long and hard .When she was done she toweled off completly and went to the ice box and grabed a water bottle.She opened it as fast as she could and downed half the bottle in one swig.She took the tylenol he left her and washed them down with the rest of the bottle and she fell on the cot,curled up into a ball and fell asleep.



He left her alone for the next few days.Only watching as she watched tv,ate the soft furit he had left her and slept.She did not make use of the computer and only once used the music libray he had left her,selecting a slow,sad Chopin piano piece which she played over and over again.Her face was almost back to mormal with only a small black eye remaining.Good becuase it was time for the next lesson.



She was lying on the cot watching tv when he turned off the tv from his controls outside the room and hit the lights.She Jumped as the lights flashed and went to the wall waiting with fear as he entered the room."Good Evening Nora,arms pleaes."She placed her arms in the shackles and he hit the button for them to close.He walked to her slowly showing no emotion on his face.When he was 1 foot away he raised his arm as if to strike her.She screamed.He laughed as he brought his arm dowm slowly and caressed her cheek.He walked back out of the room and came back in with what looked to her to be a sawhorse.In fact it was but it was no starndard sawhorse.It was the kind used widely in the BDSM community.It had pads for her hands and knees and straps to tie her to the sawhorse with a wide board on top for her torso.He placed the sawhorse in the middle of the room and went out again.He returned with the cattle prod.Seeing this she began to whimper softly."Please stop that Nora.I cant think with you blubbering".Now Nora,I am going to release you from the shackles and the wall.You are to mount the sawhorse here and put your arms and legs in the proper place and secure one of your hands with the other.You need to do this as fast as possible.And please do as your instucted without any problems asI am in a hurry to begin this evenings lesson and I dont want to wait for you to wake up after setting 3 on the prod if you do not comply.Do you understand?"

She slowly nodded her head."Good" and he hit his remote for the shackles and the wench.She went to the sawhorse and climbed on and secured her left arm with the right and them stopped moving."Very good dear"he said as he secured her other arm and her legs.She was now bound in the doggie position.

He turned off the cattle prod.He left the room again returning with a small table which he&nbsp; placed right in front of her.He made several more trips outside the room returning with various items and placing all of them on the table in front of her.On the table was the wide leather belt,candle,KY jelly,and a small bucket of ice and a hood.

He placed the hood over her head,while he was doing so she pleaded with him."No please" she begged.He backhanded her across the mouth saying"Did we forget rule 1?"She let out a scream as he continued to put the hood on.

He finished with the hood.He went out of the room to his controlpanel.Cueing up Pink Floyd's The Wall, setting the volume up to a loud level he walked back in the room.The music started.He opened the eys slits on her hood and as she watched as he placed the driving gloves on his hands and selected the leather belt.She began weeping.



He waited a few minutes as he wanted her not to know where and when the first strike would come from.As the cd came to "Another Brick in the wall part1" and as he heard the helicopter sound which plays at the begining of that track he began.

His first hit landed square on both ass cheeks with a crack.Her head flew up and she let out a long scream.He then began to work her over.Landing strike after strike on her ass as she screamed as the music played on and on.He changed sides every so often ,he wanted every inch of her to feel the pain just as he did all those years.He kept hitting and hitting as she kept screaming and screaming.After a long time as her ass was 1 large bruise and was welted and bleeding in some spots. He turned his attention to the back of her thighs.Soon he had them welted and bleeding from his&nbsp; unstopping assault.

His arm was giving out so he dropped the belt and lit the candle.He then began to drip the hot wax on her back.Her screams began anew as each drop of hot wax landed.He soon had most of her back coated in a thick layer of wax so he turned to the bruised ass and began there and when she was coated there her started on her battered thighs.

She had stopped screaming as her voice was no longer capable.He dropped the candle.He walked up in front of her and removed her hood.Her eyes and face were all puffy from screaming and crying.He sat dowm on her cot and wiped the sweat from his face.He took a bottle of water from her fridge and sat there drinking.He had a few cigerettes as he calmed down.He knew that if he did not stop soon he was capable of doing serious damage to her and he did not want that.He wanted her pain and her fear not her death.



She laid there with her head drooped to one side whimpering."You know Nora.this could all have been avoiding if my life had turned out a different way"he began talking."If just a few of those women would have been nice to me.But instead they decieded not to be.They were mean and nasty making me feel so small and so weak that after a time I just wanted to die.But then once in a while one would be nice to me for a while until she saw something better and left me or I found out they were just using me for my money.Each time it hurt more and more until I could not take it anymore".

"Ah well-enough of this ,Where was I? Oh yes I was about to beat you more before I fuck you".She started thrashing in her bonds again as he picked up the belt again.He landed a solid blow to the bottom of her right foot.She screamed as loud as she could thrashing her head back and forth as he landed again and again on the soles of her feet.Soom they too here black and blue and a few spots were bleeding.He again dropped the belt and walked in front of her.He took off his sweat stained shirt and removed his pants and underware and stood naked in front of her.She was looking at his erect dick and shaking her head saying"NO NO PLEASE".

She knew this was going to happen sooner or later and she feared it.He picked up the KY jelly from the table and moved around the horse to her ass.He poured a long steram straight on to her butthole.He smeared it around with a finger then stopped.She was begging him. "NO NO PLEASE NOT THAT" as he lined up his dick with her bung hole and thrust foward.He buried his dick to the hilt in one thrust as she screamed and thrashed around in her bonds.He began to fuck her ass.This was not a&nbsp; genlte fuck.This was a fuck from hell.He slammed into her again and again as hard as he could.He was&nbsp; able to last for some time before he let go and slammed into her one last time as his balls unloaded and he filled her bowels with his cum.He slipped from her and sat down on the cot panting."That was everything I was hopimg forNora-your ass was fantastic,Thank You"He was hoping to shame her by thanking her as if she had little choice and as he said it he saw her close her eyes and hang her head-it worked.

He had some more water and layed back on the cot and soon fell asleep leaving her on the horse with her pain and his cum draining from her ass.After some time he awoke but did not let her see that he was awake.She had her head resting on on side and was looking out to space as he jumped up from the bed scaring her.He picked up the cattle prob without her seeing him,set it to levl one and touched it to her&nbsp; black and blue right foot.She jumped and thrashed about and screamed as the voltage shot thru her.He went around her boby touching the prod to all the spots he had attacked with the belt.She bucked and thrashed around yelling and screaming.Then he touched the prod to her clit and her head went straight up and her mouth flew open but no sound came out.He held it there for a short moment before removing it .Her head dropped and she was breathing very deep and fast and he knew it was time.Again he grabbed the lube and again he thrust hard into her bleeding and battered ass.Again he fucked her hard as he could as she struggled in her bonds yelling and screaming.After a few short minutes he shot his load into her ass again and slipped from her.He reached over and picked up the prod and set to level 3 touched her ass.She convulsed for a minute before passing out









Chapter 8



She had no idea how long she had been tied on the horse.She knew she must have passed out from the aweful pain of the cattle prod.When see awoke her whole body was on fire.The pain was everywhere.Her ass and back hurt from the beating,her pussy hurt from the prod and her ass hurt from the brutal fucking.Her arms and legs where stiff and hurt like hell from being on the horse so long.He was not in the room.She prayed he would&nbsp; be gone for a long time yet also prayed to be released from this fucking horse.God,she hurt.



He was asleep upstairs.He was tired from beating her and fucking her.He would have never guessed that doing these things would be so draining.But God did he feel good,his dick was still tingling from taking her ass and he could still see in his mind the sight of her screaming as the belt landed time and time again.Glorious it was.



He got up and dressed himself.It was a weekend end so he did not have to go anywhere.He went to the kitchen and fixed some breakfest for himself.Eggs,bacon.toast and orange juice.It tasted better then any meal he could recall lately.Of course it might have to do with the things going on inside his mind.He finished his meal and then went downstairs.She had been on the horse for about 10 hours and he was sure she would not last to much longer if he let her stay there.He went into the room.



She was awake.She jumped and screamed from his sudden appearence.She was off in another world.Someplace where the pain and torture were not real.He walked around her.Her back and ass were black and blue and had a few small spots of dried blood.Her butthole was a bit battered and also had a spot of blood on it.Her looked at her feet.There were a real mess.They had swelled up from his attack.He knew she would not be able to walk.She stared at him with a look of fear not knowing what was going to happen.



He said nothing.He removed the cuffs from her hands and feet.She did not move.She could not move,He picked her up off the horse and she started to tremble.He took her to the shower and turned on the water to a lukewarm setting and placed her in the shower.She let out a scream as the water hit her.He begin to bath her.Using very gentle strokes as not to cause her pain.He worked on her arms and legs tring to get the musceles working again.

He finished the shower and toweled her off.She was still unable to move much as her musceles had not yet started to work.He placed her on the toilet and waited as she let lose her bladder and then tryed to take a shit.His attack on her ass made that action very painful and she yelled as it happened.



Her picked her up and carried her to the cot.Still not having said a word to her he got her a water bottle and opened it for her.Her arm was still stiff but she managed to hold it and drink for herself.He gave her a cigerette and lit it for her.He sat on the floor as she had her smoke.She finished it and he gave her some food.He had made some scrambled eggs for her and she was eating then slowly as he sat next to her not saying anything just looking at her with no expresstion on his face.She finished eating.He offered her another cigerette and she took it.She finished it and he helped her turn on her stomach.He placed a blanket over her turned off the lights and left the room.He sat at his control panel watching her.In just a few short minutes she was asleep.He did all this with&nbsp; good reason.It was all part of the mindfuck.He wanted her to be kept off balance at all times.Never knowing what he was going to do.Was he going to beat and torture her or was he going to be gentle and caring.She would never know.



He kept up his vigil.When she woke he would come into the room with more food and water and cigerettes.He would help her to the toilet and shower before helping her back to bed to rest smor more.This went on for 4 days.Her back and ass were healing slowly.Her feet were still painful and she could not walk much.All this time he said nothing to her and she in turn said nothing to him.She was still very aware of rule #1.Her mind was a mix of emotions.How could anyone do what he did to her and then be so gentle and caring? She was terrified of him and thats exactly what he wanted.Confusion and fear and then&nbsp; calm.Never knowing what the next minute had in store for her.



It had been almost two weeks.He had cared for her everyday and not done anything bad to her.Her body was almost back to normal aside from a few scares on her back.It was time.While she had been asleep one day he had installed small but very powerful strobe lights in each corner of the room.He flashed the lights 3 times.Her signal to go to the wall or be dragged there by the wench.She was awake just lying on the cot when he did this so she moved as fast as she could to her spot on the wall,her feet still causing her some discomfort.He entered the room and for the first time in weeks talked to her."Nora please put your arms in the shackles",She complied not having the slightest idea what was going to come next.He hit the control button and the shackles closed on her wrists.Her took the tv remote from his pocket and turned on the tube.On the screen came the local news."Please pay very close attention to the tv Nora".She was watching as the anchorman came back on after a commerical."In local news,the search for the missing woman Mrs Nora Smith has been called off.After a very long and unsuccessful search of the local area&nbsp; and after following any and all tips the police held a news conference today at police headquartes.The seach for Mrs Smith has been called off ..After seaching 200 sqaure miles and after all leads have turned out to be unsuccuesful we have no choice but to turn the case over to our cold case squad to move on to other matters.Thats all we have at this time". The police man was replaced on the tv by Nora's family as the newscaster said the family still had high hopes off finding their daughter alive and where very disapponted at the police report today'"We want to say thank you to all that have helped in the search for our daughter and we are offering a 25000 dollar reward to anyone with any information and where our baby might be".The newscaster closed with "Up next our whether forcast for the folling week".He turned off the tv and looked at the subject of the news story and with a slow grin spreading across his face said"Well I guess thats means you are all mine now".Nora looked at his face and screamed."NNNNNNNOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!"











chapter 9



He left her standing against the wall screaming. He went to the control console,turned down the heat to 50 degress,put on the thrash metal on high volume and hit the strobe lights.Her world became cold ,loud and blinding.Add all of that to the knowledge that the search for her had been called off and you get one mindfucked person.He left her there all night.In the morning he changed the trash metal music to a tape of Holloween sounds with all the screaming and yelling,put the temp up to 95 and turned off the strobe lights.After 5 hours of that she was bathed in sweat and could barely stand anymore having been in the same spot for over 24 hours with her feet still in pain from the beating of her soles.Now she was alone in the dark with ear pierceing screams all around her and sweating like a pig.She finnally fell.He released the wench just enough so she could sit without choking herself.Next it was back to the strobe lights.She had been in the dark for&nbsp; hours and when the strobes hit her she screamed and tried to shield her eyes without much luck.After a long night of that her turned off the strobes and played the tape of the news report over and over.



Two days later he turned off the tape and put the temp back to a normal level and walked into the room.She had been tortured like this for 4 days now.She was sitting against the wall staring blankly into space.She had pissed and shit herself several times and the room smelled like an open sewer.He released her arms from the shackles and they fell to her sides.She was in very bad shape.He was unsure if she had lost her mind.Maybe 4 days had been a bit too much.He walked over to her and looked in her eyes.She was still staring off into space completely unaware he was there.So he slapped her hard across the face.That brought her back to reality and she screamed and cringed away from him.He went over the the shower area and filled a bucket of water up with cold water,turned back to her and tossed the water over her.She screamed again and was starting to wimper.He got the cattle prod from the other room,walked back in and without her seeing it zapped her.She screamed again and jumped .



He put the prod down and bent down in front of her.He needed to know if her mind was still working."NORA!!" he yelled.She looked straight into his face wimpering."Nora,what is your name,you may speak"My name is Nora!!" she yelled.

"Good" he said."What year where you born?"

"1965" she replied in a smaller voice.

"Very good"he answered back."Now stand up"

She tried to stand several times before she managed it.

"Turn around" he barked the command and she did.He handcuffed her hands and hit the release for the wench.He took her over to the shower and pushed her in and turned on the cold water.She jumped and yelled as the water hit her.She tried to move out of the spray but he kept her in the shower for 15 minutes before turning it off and toweling her off.He led her back to the cot and uncuffed her.She was shakeing.Her gave her a cup of coffe and a cigerette.She downed the coffe in one gulp,He refilled her cup.She had stopped shack after some time and seemed to be back in this world.



It was several days later when he returned to the room.He had left her alone on purpose.He had made sure she had water and food to eat and had made the shower available to her.She had not dome much except eat and bath a few times,she just stayed laying on the cot sleeping or just looking up at the ceiling.He hit the lights three times and at the signal she went to stand at her place on the wall as the wench took up the slack in the line.He went inside and put a table and chair for himself and brought with him a pot of coffee and two mugs,poured them both some coffee and put a fresh pack of cigerettes on the table as well."Help yourself" was all he said.



She sipped her coffee and reached for a cigerette.He put the lighter on the table for her use.She lit it and took a long slow pull before inhalling and he saw her body relax a bit.He had one for himself and they sat there in&nbsp; the slience smoking and looking at each other."Well, here we are.what shall we do"? She said nothing not because she did not permission to speak but because she had nothing to say."I guess its time to tell you a few things.By now you have I hope realized that your life belongs to me now.I hope you have given up and hope of escape from here or at least escaping alive.You know that there is no shinning knight on a white horse coming to your rescue.So where does that leave you you wonder?What meaning does your life have now?How long will you indure this toment?All of these are good questions and now I will give you the answer.Your life as you knew it is over.Your new life begins today.Today you learn what you will be for the rest of your life.Mine.You now have only one thing to care about.Me. That is your only concern.You are going to be taught how to please me in every way.You are going to be taught that my happiness comes before your own.In time you will learn that making me happy will bring you happiness.Not making me happy will mean pain and torture for you.So you now have a choice to make.Do you begin to learn how to make me happy and in doing so bring yourself happiness or do we continue like this and you live in fear and pain and I take want I want from you anyway until one day I grow tried of you and torture you to death? I can make your life pleasent and enjoyable or I can make your life a living hell.I will leave you know Nora.I will come back in one hour and then you will tell me your choice"



One hour passes and he returns to the room and sits down at the table.He had been watching her from the control room.Watching her and her mind working.Watching as she talked to herself.Watched as she would go from calm&nbsp; and quiet to weeping with great angwish,watching as she would recall the pain and then see her&nbsp; regain your composure only to lose it again with anger and hatred.A million emotions came and went from her face in that hour.Now as he sat before him she was calm and quiet." Well Nora,have you reached your decision you may speak".She looked away from him and with a quiet voice said"Yes"

"Sorry I did not get that please repeat it".She turned to him and said in a stong voice "YES I will do as you say".

"Very good .A wise decision.And now you will see what I mean by making me happy you make yourself happy".He rose from the table and went to the control room.He retuned with a bundle under his arm.He placed the bundle on the table and told her"You may get dressed" and unrolled the bundle giving her a pair of sweatpants and a sweatshirt and socks.She looked down at the clothes not beliving what she saw."Tomarrow will begin your training.I suggest that you get a good nights sleep".He rose and left the room closing the door behind him.He released the wench so she could move and he watched as she began to dress.She Had tears in her eyes,he was unsure if they were haapy tears from be allowed to dress or sad because she had given in to him.
