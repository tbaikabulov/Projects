Part 2 &#8211; Dark Well 

Chapter 1 &#8211; A Step Backwards

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The blond woman points the gun at me again. I wonder if she is going to shoot me this time. She grins, enjoying my fear.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How did she find me? I did exactly what Steven wanted me to do. It was to hide somewhere for a week or two. He didn&#8217;t give me any explanation. He made me do that. I didn&#8217;t even protest much. He said that I am in danger. We are divorced but I still trust him. I still think that he is a nice guy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; Undoubtedly, no one would hear the shot. The mountain lodge that I rented is too isolated. The nearest lodge is two miles away. If she shoots me, my dead body will not be found soon, not until next week�maybe. Partially decomposed and stinking. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; We are on the lawn near the lodge. As I fix my gaze on her eyes, I realize that she is really going to kill me. I am shivering all over. It is very difficult to pretend that I am not horrified. Despite that, I am trying.
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Are you going to stare at me like that all day?� I ask boldly.
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Just a minute. Don&#8217;t be so inpatient! Are you ready to die yet?� she says and shoves me. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; A lump forms in my throat. I try to swallow it. She giggles. What a bitch!
&nbsp;&nbsp; She steps forward, and presses the muzzle against my chest. Instinctively, I step back. Something crunches under my foot. I look down. Rotten planks. They give way and break under my weight. I fall through, crying with fear. Darkness envelops me. A nasty laughter rings into my ears. A couple of seconds later, when I hit the bottom of the well, the darkness becomes absolute. Mercifully, the nasty laughter stops tormenting me. 

Chapter 2 &#8211; What&#8217;s Wrong With Me?

&nbsp;&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know what has helped me come round. Maybe it is the feeling of tiny creature crawling on my hand, or the disgusting smell of rottenness and mould. Possibly, it is the pain. Never mind! It looks unbelievable that I can still breathe, feel, and see. This doesn&#8217;t make me feel happy at all. Surely, I am going to die soon! I know that there is something wrong with me! Am I really dying? But I am just 27.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; I take a deep breath and try to chase the panic away. The thoughts scurry in my head. I am lying at the bottom of a deep well. I am seeing the light above me. It seems that the well is at least ten meters deep. The woman who pushed me is gone. I don&#8217;t hear anything except the distant twitter of the birds. How long I have been lying here?
&nbsp;&nbsp; The pain intensifies and rudely interrupts the flow of thoughts. I gasp for breath. Everything swims before my eyes. As the dizziness recede, I am able to think again. I can&#8217;t move. I feel as if my body is shattered. My right leg is stretched out. My foot is turned inwards. There is a lump in the middle of my thigh. Instinctively, I know that I should not even try to budge my leg. The left one looks better. I can flex my knee. At least I am not paralyzed. That&#8217;s for sure. My bottom and lower back are on fire. I am trying to move my arms. The right one is not responding. My fingers are numb. I am not sure if I have internal injuries. My stomach is not painful. That&#8217;s good. There are moist blotches beside me. I touch them. Then, I examine the tips of my fingers. To my relief, they are not smeared with blood. The wetness is maybe water or urine, but definitely not blood. I am not sure if I have wetted myself. The dampness on my panties answers this question. It seems that my skirt and pantyhose are torn. I see my bare flesh here and there. Except for a big bump behind the left ear, my head is intact. As I finish the cursory examination, the panic comes back induced by another wave of pain. I faint.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I regain consciousness, I realize that something has changed. What? I can&#8217;t see anything! What&#8217;s going on? The darkness is impenetrable! 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, I look up and see a star. Night has fallen. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel unwell. I am in a fever. My heart is pounding. It appears that my right thigh is terribly swollen. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; When I stir slightly, unbearable, piercing pain erupts from my pelvis and moves up my spine. I writhe and cry with pain. This causes more suffering. I will myself to lie still. It is very difficult. Tears gush from my eyes. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My left foot troubles me too. It feels as if the leather boot cannot contain it anymore. The swelling is growing by the minute. The feeling is torturing, but I can&#8217;t do anything. It would have been great if I could reach out and slide the zipper down�
&nbsp;&nbsp; Something is crawling on my knee. This doesn&#8217;t bother me anymore. Nothing bothers me, except the pain.
&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I am still and the pain is almost tolerable. It is encouraging. May be I will live through the night. I doze off.
&nbsp;&nbsp; The night is so long. I have never had such a night. Everlasting. Why I am waiting for the dawn? What would it bring to me? Who knows! Why I delude myself that someone will help me? There is no glimpse of hope. I can&#8217;t bear this agony anymore. What can I do? Nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; My life is such a mess. I don&#8217;t have kids. I don&#8217;t have a husband. I have many fair-weather friends, but few real friends. Possibly, Steve is the only one. Nevertheless, he drew me into this. Why this woman tried to kill me? What has he done? Is he in danger too?
&nbsp;&nbsp; It dawns. I am dying for water. My lips are parched. The tight leather boot is pressing my swelled foot ruthlessly. The pain is excruciating. I have to do something.
&nbsp;&nbsp; Using my good arm, I push myself slightly up. I regret about doing it. Something moves in my pelvis.
&nbsp;&nbsp; It feels as if a hungry worm is eating my flesh. As though, some vicious creature is forcing its way inside me, striving to be born. What a stupid thought! In fact, my pelvic is broken. I am sure. This is not soothing at all. Moreover, it is horrible. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was a kid, Linda&#8217;s mother fell off a tree, and broke her pelvis. She spent three month in the hospital. I saw her when she returned home. She was waddling around, supporting herself on crutches. The children mocked her on the streets. Linda said that her mother wasn&#8217;t the same person anymore, and that she was unable even to�That&#8217;s enough! I should not think about that. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; Miraculously, I manage to sit up. I sob bitterly. Large tears roll down my cheeks. The weight of my upper body presses down on my broken pelvis. I scream in agony and almost topple sideways. My good arm helps me prop myself up. I stabilize myself and manage to calm down a little. Afterwards, I flex my left knee, drawing my injured foot closer. Then, I reach out and run the zipper down. I feel some relief as my foot is free. Growing weaker, I slump gingerly down again. That&#8217;s all. I won&#8217;t move anymore. Come what may.
&nbsp;&nbsp; Time goes by. I am tired and dizzy. Pangs torture me from time to time. The pain sucks my powers. My thoughts are muddled. I am calmer and more indifferent than before, though. Most of the time, I don&#8217;t think about anything. I am not so scared anymore. Dusk is falling.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Chapter 3 &#8211; Found

&nbsp;&nbsp; �Daddy, Daddy! Come here! Someone is lying there. Look! A lady! �
&nbsp;&nbsp; I look up. The face of a little girl is hovering above me. She is staring curiously at me. I try to say something, but my tongue betrays me.
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Get back, Emily!� someone says anxiously.
&nbsp;&nbsp; �She is not moving, daddy! Is she dead?� 
&nbsp;&nbsp; A young man appears and gazes down at me. I manage to lift my good arm. It is surprisingly difficult. As though, my arm is leaden. Then, I drop it down again. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Are you OK, miss?� the man asks. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; What a stupid question! Am I looking OK!
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Help me!� I manage to groan.
&nbsp;&nbsp; My voice is weak and hoarse. It is almost a whisper. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Don&#8217;t move! Everything is gonna be OK.&#8217;&#8217;
&nbsp;&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have even the slightest intention of moving. The man disappears. I hear him talking on his mobile. Please hurry! I can&#8217;t bear it any longer! At one time, I hear a chopper. Grit and bits of straw start falling down on me. The emotions and pain go too far, and I swoon. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; I come around as the paramedics are lifting my mutilated body. I am placed on a stretcher. They do it as gently as they can in such a cramped space. Despite that, I am in agony. I sob all the time. One of the paramedics tries to soothe me. He caresses my brow, talks to me. I am unable to grasp the meaning of the words. Then, I am hoisted up. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; As the chopper takes off, they place a mask on my face and attach an IV line to my arm. I am given a shot. It feels good. Slowly, I drift into unconsciousness.

Chapter 4 &#8211; The Hospital
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel gentle fingers tugging at my clothes. My eyelids are so heavy that I can&#8217;t open my eyes. Soft hands are touching me. At first, my forehead and neck, then my abdomen. Finally, my legs. Some of the touches are causing me pain. I&#8217;m trying to protest, but my lips can&#8217;t move. The touching stops. I hear a lively conversation. The words sound familiar, but I can&#8217;t grasp their meaning. A few minutes later, I am aware of something cold sliding up my right leg. It barely touches my skin. I hear a creaking sound. I don&#8217;t understand what&#8217;s going on. Then, I feel the same coldness on my left leg. What a fool I am! They are cutting the pantyhose. Subsequently, I feel my panties being cut off laterally and removed. Have they noticed that I have wetted my panties? I am self-conscious about my nakedness. My skirt and blouse are taken off as well. My bra remains untouched. What are they going to do? I am rather interested than scared. The worst is over. They will take care of me. The pain is not so intense now. It is almost tolerable. Am I drugged? Then, I make out the phrase �multiple fractures�. Are they talking about me? Sure. It stings as they are cleaning the cuts and bruises. I am aware that my body is fully exposed. Including my private parts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; I am wheeled into another room. The temperature is lower and I go goosey. I still can&#8217;t open my eyes. Something clicks loudly. They are turning me cautiously on my left side. It hurts like hell. I hear the same sound again. A moment later, I am turned on my back and wheeled out. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; People are scurrying about. They are talking. I can make out at least three different voices but can&#8217;t make sense of the conversation. For them, I am an object. My personality is not important. They are working on me, trying to fix me. I am thankful. No one is going to hurt me anymore. In this moment, I feel my left foot being lifted. Someone&#8217;s strong hands are holding it. They clasp around it and push. At first, I am unable to understand what&#8217;s going on. The pain overwhelms me. I feel bone fragments moving, grating against each other. I scream. The torture stops immediately. My foot is on fire. I open my eyes. A man is scolding one of the nurses. She blushes. A mask is placed on my face, and I slowly drift into unconsciousness. The torture continues before I pass out completely. This time, I am barely aware of it. Soon, I don&#8217;t feel anything.
&nbsp;&nbsp; I am dreaming. I know that it is just a nightmare, but I am horrified nevertheless. The worm is eating me. It is big. Almost like a little snake. It is into my womb. Its tiny teeth are razor sharp. They chew my intestines. I fist my stomach, trying to kill it. The worm is writhing. It digs deeper into my flesh. This time it gnaws at the bones. They crunch as it breaks them with voracious eagerness. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; I am covered with cold sweat as I wake up. Shaking off the nightmare, I open my eyes. A lot of time has passed. I am alone in a small separate room. My right arm is casted. It is lifted up in a sling. The plaster is going all the way up to my shoulder. The cast is bent at a 90-degree angle. My left leg is plastered up to the knee. It hangs in a sling too. The cast is pretty big for such a small-sized foot as mine. Was I expecting some tight fitting, cute cast? Not that the cast is ugly but� I am looking at my bloated toes when something catches my eyes. The sight is quite futuristic. I have never seen this sort of contraption before. My right leg is in traction. Metal bars are surrounding it. The limb looks pitiably. There are holes bored into it. Metal pieces are shoved into the holes. Weights are suspended from the frame above. The sight makes me queasy. It hurts even looking at my leg. Obviously, it is badly broken. For all I know it could have been amputated. Maybe, I am lucky.
&nbsp;&nbsp; A nurse comes in. As she sees that I am conscious, she smiles sweetly.
&nbsp;&nbsp; �My name is Nora. I hope that you are feeling better,� she says and comes closer. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; �I am scared,� I answer weakly.
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Do you want me to stay?�
&nbsp;&nbsp; I nod. Nora smiles shyly and sits beside me. She is very young and attractive. Her big brown eyes avoid my gaze.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Am I embarrassing you?� I ask.
&nbsp;&nbsp; �I am new. I still can&#8217;t handle all this,� she mumbles and flushes. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; �What do you mean?� 
&nbsp;&nbsp; �There is so much pain and suffering here.�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Could you please tell me more about�� I point at the traction apparatus.
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Oh! Your right leg is going to be OK. It is broken in three places but Dr. Conners said that it looks worse than it really is. He had a lot more problems setting your pelvis. The fractured bones were nastily displaced. It took him almost two hours to fix you. You were moaning all the time, despite the anaesthetic. Does it still hurt?�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �It feels sore. When I came round, I was so preoccupied with the sight of my legs that the fact that my pelvis was injured slipped out of my mind. I knew that it was broken even before they brought me here.&#8217;&#8217; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, I realize that there is something hard beneath me. When I look down, I see that my body is bandaged from the navel to the armpits. Why haven&#8217;t I noticed this yet? Strange!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �What&#8217;s this?� I ask.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �This is a splint. It is made especially for you. The orthopedic technician took your measures and made it. He said that you are certainly a model,� Nora giggled.� The splint immobilizes your posterior and back. Dr. Conners adjusted it, and I helped him bandage you up.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �I am not a model. I am accountant. What about my back?� I interrupt her impatiently.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �You have two broken vertebrae, but your spinal cord is not damaged. You are lucky.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The door opens, and a young doctor comes in. He has an earnest face and handsome look.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Would you please leave us alone?� the man asks irritably. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nora leaves without a word.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �I am Dr. Conners.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Pamela Angelbeck.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Did she have enough time to frighten you?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �She was kind. I asked her to tell me more about my injuries.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �I will explain. Fractured pelvis and two vertebrae, fractured legs and arm. As a hole, you didn&#8217;t manage to break only your head and your left arm. It will take a long time to restore you to health. You have to stay here at least four months, so you have to be very patient.&nbsp; We will take good care of you, Miss Angelbeck. Do you have any questions?�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �When will I be able to walk again?� 
&nbsp;&nbsp; �No one knows.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I plunge into reverie. Dr. Conners examines the traction inch by inch.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel like human guinea pig. My private parts are covered with a sheet but I wonder if he can see under it. Why I am so worried about this? Surely he had seen me stark naked when he set the broken bones. What is he thinking as he heals naked women? Possibly, he is so preoccupied with his work that� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The physician touches one of the metal bars. The pain shoots up my entire leg. I clench teeth and shudder. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Sorry. I had to adjust it some more.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He turns his attention toward my casted toes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Wiggle them, please!�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I comply. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Very well! It is even better than I thought it would be.�&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before leaving, he checks my casted arm.
&nbsp;&nbsp; I am alone again. Soon I realize that the effect of the painkillers is wearing off. The anguish starts again. I press the button on the wall behind me. Nora comes in, humming merrily.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Chapter 5 &#8211; The Pain

&nbsp;&nbsp; �I need something for the pain,� I plead.
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nora looks at her wristwatch and frowns.
&nbsp;&nbsp; �It&#8217;s too early. You have to wait! Is it really bad?� Nora says.
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Yes, it is. Can I talk to Dr.Conners?�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �No. I am afraid he is busy right now. I will give you a sponge bath. You will like it. I am sure.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I decide that there is no use protesting, so I try not to think about the pain. But it is impossible. The hope that the worst is over gradually evaporates. I am completely immobilised and the broken bones are set. Why does it still hurt like hell? My heart sinks and my eyes fill with tears.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wet sponge touches my bare shoulder. I startle.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Is the water cold?� Nora asks. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �No. It&#8217;s fine.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nora rubs my shoulders clean, then my face and neck. After drying me, she took her time brushing my long hair.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Is it naturally black?� Nora asks.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Yes. Why do you ask me?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Your eyes are blue, so I thought that maybe the natural color of your hair is blond.� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �It&#8217;s not.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The nurse sits on the bed beside me and lifts the sheet.&nbsp; Dabbing at my groin, Nora doesn&#8217;t show that she has noticed my uneasiness. Finally, she washes my left thigh and knee.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �That&#8217;s all I can do,� Nora mumbles. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Thank you.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �It isn&#8217;t much of a job. You are so bind up and plastered that I don&#8217;t have a big field of activity. The traction should not be touched either. I cleaned your casted toes when you were unconscious. They were specked with plaster. You should have seen your foot before the cast was applied. It was as bloated as a balloon. Four broken bones, including the heel bone! Could you believe it! I was holding your ankle as Dr. Conners was reducing the fractures.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �You did a great job, Nora. Why don&#8217;t you give me something for the pain?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Do not be so impatient!� There was a shade of annoyance in her voice. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �I&#8217;m sorry.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �I heard that you were found into a dried well. Is it true?&#8217;&#8217;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Yes, it&#8217;s true.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �You were pushed?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Yes.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Who did it?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Never seen her before.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Woman! Of course. How could a man hurt such a beauty like you!�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everything started to swim before my eyes. I close them.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �You are so pale, Pamela! I thought that you were stronger. Wait a minute! You will get what you want. It&#8217;s about time.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Twenty minutes later, I drift into a restless sleep.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Chapter 6 &#8211; Visitors

&nbsp;&nbsp; Gentle fingers touch my bare shoulder. Dr. Conners is leaning over me. My vision is still dimmed by the sleep. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; �You have a visitor. I explained that you are too weak but he insisted to see you. He said that it was important. I&#8217;m sorry.�
&nbsp;&nbsp; A man in his fifties comes closer, and sits beside my bed. The doctor gets out of the room.
&nbsp;&nbsp; �I am police officer. My name is Shipler,� the man says.
&nbsp;&nbsp; During the next fifteen minutes he is pouring me with questions.
&nbsp;&nbsp; �How come you fell into the well?�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �I was pushed.�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Who did it?�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t know her. She was tall and blond, in her thirties.�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Did she say anything?�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Not much,� I say, and then recount all that I remember.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; �What do you think? Why did she try to kill you?�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t know. My ex-husband Steven Corbett called and said that I was in danger, and I have to hide somewhere. I rented the lodge. I thought I would be safe there. He didn&#8217;t explain anything to me. Is Steve OK?� 
&nbsp;&nbsp; �He is OK. He surrendered.�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �What has he done?� I ask anxiously.
&nbsp;&nbsp; The police officer fixes his grim eyes on me, and then he quickly averts his gaze as if confused by the sight of my mutilated body.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; �We are working on this. Mr. Corbett is quite supportive. That&#8217;s all I am entitled to say.�
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shipler leaves. I look at the ceiling, brooding over the conversation. The thoughts spoil my already spoiled mood. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; An hour later, Nora comes and checks the IV line.
&nbsp;&nbsp; �You have another visitor,� she says.
&nbsp;&nbsp; �I am tired and I do not want to see anybody.� 
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Then, I will send her away.�
&nbsp;&nbsp; I sighed. Who knows that I am here?
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Let her in!� I say.
&nbsp;&nbsp; The young woman introduces herself as Tiffany. She is walking on crutches. Her right leg is casted from the base of her toes to the hip. Her short skirt covers the top of the cast. I notice that her left arm is casted up to the elbow. Despite this plaster outfit or due to it, she looks great. Her figure is slender, and her waist is very small. The charming face and the fair hair make her look somewhat childish. The tiny figure strengthens this impression. I think that she would have looked like a bimbo if her green eyes were not so serious and intelligent.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; �I&#8217;m so sorry about you. They will catch her. You&#8217;ll see. She deserves to rot in jail,� Tiffany says angrily.
&nbsp;&nbsp; �The woman who�attacked me?� I ask.
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Of course.�
&nbsp;&nbsp; I point at the chair. Tiffany slips the crutches off her armpits and sits clumsily on the chair. Her casted heel clacks on the floor. She flinches.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Did she attack you as well?� I inquire.
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Yes. I had almost recovered from the car crash, and then she broke my leg again.�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Why did she do that?�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �She wanted to know where Dr. Corbett was. Your ex-husband treated my leg. The bitch had an edge on him. I didn&#8217;t know his whereabouts and so� � 
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Do you know something about Steven?�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Officer Shipler said that he has been arrested.�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Arrested! But why?�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t know,� Tiffany answers.
&nbsp;&nbsp; During the conversation, Tiffany never shows signs of embarrassment. Obviously, the sight of my mangled body doesn&#8217;t disgust her. She takes in every detail though, doing her best so that not to upset me. Her eyes are curious but at the same sympathetic.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Is your back injured too?� Tiffany asks.
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Two broken vertebrae.�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Did they tell you if your spinal cord is� if your spinal cord is �damaged?� 
&nbsp;&nbsp; �It is not damaged. I can still wiggle my toes. But please don&#8217;t ask me to do that because it hurts!�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �I won&#8217;t,� Tiffany says and smiles.
&nbsp;&nbsp; I begin to laugh. The slight movement induces a pang in my pelvis. I cough, making the things worse.
&nbsp;&nbsp; �What&#8217;s the matter with you? Do you want me to call the nurse?� she grabs the crutches, preparing to stand up. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; �No, no! I am fine. Sometimes, it just hurts awfully. My pelvis is fractured,� I utter faintly.
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Can I do something for you?� she asks worriedly.
&nbsp;&nbsp; �No. I am all right now. Thank you.�
&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually the pain abates and I calm myself down. My breathing gets back to normal. Then, I notice that Tiffany is feeling uncomfortable. Obviously, the top of the cast is digging into her hip. She is bending her upper body to the left trying to make herself comfortable.
&nbsp;&nbsp; �It would be better if you rest your casted foot on the bed. There is enough room for it.�
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tiffany gladly complies. She slips her hands under the cast and lifts it up, then places her casted foot on the bed beside my left thigh. As I am looking at these cute little toes that are sticking out of the cast, I wonder if Steven has ever touched them. It may well have happened. He has treated her after all. I recall Steven&#8217;s attraction to women&#8217;s feet and to ladies wearing cast. It&#8217;s no wonder that he has chosen to be an orthopedist. Lucky boy! Tiffany now looks exactly as he would have liked. He liked my feet once�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Did Steven plaster your broken leg?� I ask.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �He applied the first cast. Another doctor applied this one.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We chat nearly half an hour. Tiffany&#8217;s presence is comforting to me. Before leaving she asks if I need something and promises to pay me a visit next week. 

Chapter 7 &#8211; A Small Change

&nbsp;&nbsp; I can&#8217;t get used to the bedpan. I feel very awkward about using it. Moreover, it is painful. My body has to be lifted slightly up so that the bedpan to be slipped under me. Another nurse aids Nora in this task. They do the whole procedure cautiously, but even the slightest movement causes me pain. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nora gives me a sponge bath every day. I enjoy it very much. It makes me feel better. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; The days are passing by uneventfully. Dr. Conners is very kind to me. He always pays attention to my complaints and tries to encourage me. On Monday he comes and examines my casted toes very closely.
&nbsp;&nbsp; �They are not as swollen as before. Are you still in pain when you wiggle them?� Dr.Conners asks.
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Just a little,� I answer.
&nbsp;&nbsp; As he lowers the cast from the sling, I become aware that my foot is moving inside the cast. It hurts. Obviously, the swelling has subsided. He cuts the cast using a saw and Nora helps him pry it open. What a sorry sight! The swelling is gone, but there is a big purple stain around my ankle. It has turned light blue near the sole of my foot. My heel is dark blue. I wonder at this color transformation. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; The doctor instructs Nora what to do. She slides her palms under my calf and lifts up. My foot is hanging limply, slightly bent inward. Dr.Conners pulls the stockinet on as cautiously as possible, trying to protect my injured foot. Then he gently wraps it with wadding. After that he applies the new cast, moulding it slowly around every cure. As he finishes, I am glad to see that the cast is not as big as before. It looks more like a tight fitting boot. The curve of my instep is clearly distinguishable. My toes are fully exposed. I stare admiringly at the new cast. Steven would have liked it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Do you like it?� Dr. Conners asks and puts my leg in the sling again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; �It&#8217;s masterpiece.�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Your delicate foot and ankle are the reason.�
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nora winks at me. The doctor smiles nicely and leaves. After cleaning the mess, she leaves too.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; I watch TV for about an hour, and then drop asleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Chapter 8 &#8211; Nora

&nbsp;&nbsp; Nora brings me books and magazines. I doubt that I could muster enough concentration to read. Despite that I thank her and decide to try later. The nurse sits beside me.
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Do you remember anything?� she asks. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; �What?�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �I mean� after you fell into the well.�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Most of the time I was unconscious but I tried to make an assessment of the extent of my injuries.�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �And?�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �I decided that I should not move. I knew that my body was crushed.�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �So you didn&#8217;t move all the time?�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �No. I had to take off my boot. My foot was so swollen that��
&nbsp;&nbsp; �You did it?�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Yes.�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Was it painful?�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �It was horrible. I cried like a baby all the time.�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Where did it hurt most?�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �My bottom.�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �I&#8217;m not surprised. When we took your clothes off, I noticed that your flanks were somehow � somehow distorted. No wonder that Dr. Conners had problems fixing you,� Nora says.
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Did you help him fix my pelvis?�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Yes, but at first we took care of your right leg. The thighbone was angled and a bone fragment had nearly pierced the skin. As the doctor tugged at your leg, I heard a crunching sound. The broken bones were moving. How horrible! Don&#8217;t you remember anything at all? � 
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Nora, why do you ask all these questions?� 
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nora blushes.
&nbsp;&nbsp; �I � I just �wonder how it feels to be injured so badly,� she stammers.
&nbsp;&nbsp; �What exactly are you interested in?�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Never mind. I should not have asked you.� 
&nbsp;&nbsp; �What&#8217;s wrong with you, Nora?�
&nbsp;&nbsp; She hesitates for a moment, then looks down at the floor and starts talking.
&nbsp;&nbsp; �I had a boyfriend. His name was Tim. We loved each other very much. He promised to marry me. That was five years ago. I was only 18 then. The accident changed everything. My sister Connie is one year younger than me.&nbsp; She fell off a ladder and broke both her legs just above the ankles. She stayed at the hospital one night. Then, daddy brought her back home, carrying her in his strong hands. Connie&#8217;s legs were casted from the base of her toes all the way up to her hips. She was sniffing plaintively. The nightmare began. Mom and dad were pampering her all the time. They were fulfilling all her whims. Connie was complaining incessantly. She alleged that the pain was horrible. My parents were so obsessed with her that they forgot my birthday. This drove me crazy. No one was paying attention to me. At one point, I wondered if they really knew that I still existed. Tim was the only light in my life. Then, the worst happened. One day, Tim dropped in to see me. My parents were gone somewhere. We talked for a while, and then Tim proposed going to the cinema. I refused. I had to take care of Connie. Moreover, mom would have scolded me if I had left �the poor girl� alone. Meanwhile, in the inner courtyard �the poor girl� was watching a TV show, giggling from time to time. She was slouched into her wheelchair; her casted legs were jutting out, propped on the footrests. A parasol was protecting her from the sun. As she saw me, she immediately asked me for some ice cream. I didn&#8217;t see any ice-cream in the fridge so I went to buy some. I had to walk at least half an hour in the sweltering heat. Tim stayed to keep her company. I started up the street. Mad with rage, I had forgotten to take money with me so I returned home. To my great surprise, Connie was lying on the grass. Tim had spread her casted legs wide apart and was fucking her. �The poor girl� was moaning passionately. Her toes were curling up and down as my boyfriend was screwing her fiercely. From time to time, Tim was emitting grunting noises. Rooted to the spot, I just watched. They were so occupied with each other that I remained unnoticed. A huge orgasm shook their bodies. I hid and watched some more. Tears were streaming down my face. I was sobbing. My agony became unbearable as Tim hugged her tenderly and started kissing her. He had never kissed me like that. When he brought his lips down on her casted toes and licked them, I turned and left. And never came back.� 
&nbsp;&nbsp; An awkward silence ensues. Nora&#8217;s eyes are moist.
&nbsp;&nbsp; �I am so sorry,� I say. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nora bursts into tears and stumbles out of the room. Her clogs are clicking noisily as she is running down the corridor.
&nbsp; 
Chapter 9 &#8211; Boring Days

&nbsp;&nbsp; The next two weeks pass uneventfully. I spend a lot of time watching TV. The pain is still tormenting me. Even the painkillers don&#8217;t help much sometimes. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; I often ask Dr. Conners to tell me more about my injuries. He kindly explains that I am recovering faster than he had expected. His unwillingness to talk scares me. To my satisfaction, Nora doesn&#8217;t ask strange questions anymore and continues to do her job meticulously. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tiffany pays me a visit again and stays more than an hour. She is very friendly. I ain&#8217;t surprised that she notices my new cast. She says that it is cute. When I ask her to rub my casted toes, she blushes. Then, she moves closer and massages them expertly. It seems to me that she is glad to do it. As I see her leaning on her crutches, I imagine myself walking on crutches. I wonder if I would ever be able to do that.
&nbsp;&nbsp; I call mom, but I don&#8217;t tell her what happened to me. I don&#8217;t want to scare her. She says that my voice has changed. After that, she tries to convince me to take a break from work and to lie down for a while. I can&#8217;t stop myself laughing at this. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; My colleagues come to see me. They crowd into my room. It is embarrassing. I feel self-conscious about my condition. And I feel their eyes staring unblinkingly at me as if I am some kind of freak. Gradually, the tension eases and we start talking more freely. One of my colleagues remains silent all the time. She has always hated me. Surely, she is glad to see me crippled.
&nbsp;&nbsp; In Tuesday, Dr. Conners and a physician I don&#8217;t know come in. Nora and another nurse follow them.
&nbsp;&nbsp; �What&#8217;s going on?� I ask.
&nbsp;&nbsp; �It&#8217;s time for some X rays. You have to be transported,� Dr. Conners answers.
&nbsp;&nbsp; After taking my blood pressure, they place a mask on my face. Slowly my troubles fade away, and I lapse into unconsciousness.

Chapter 10 &#8211; The Big Change

&nbsp;&nbsp; I am tired and sleepy. It is almost impossible to open my eyes. I blink a couple of times, trying to do that. My eyelids are so heavy. It looks like I have been drugged. Why did they do that?&nbsp; Finally, I manage to open my eyes. After focusing them, I see that I am in my room again. My back is propped on pillows. My casted right arm is hanging in a sling in just the same way as before. Then, I see the big change. The traction is gone, as well as the short leg cast. Both my legs are casted and placed in slings high above the bed. The casts are identical. They are holding my legs straight. A bar spreads them wide apart. It is placed between my ankles and is moulded into the casts. My toes are fully exposed. I see speckles of plaster on them. A sheet is draped over my body. I lift it and peek under it. My hips and stomach are plastered. Only the area around my vagina is left free. The cast narrows at my waist, then moves up engulfing my breasts, and stops just under my armpits. The upper edge is padded so that not to chafe my skin. The enormity of the cast is frightening. Then, I realize that I am feeling more comfortable than before. It seems that my body is better immobilized. I can&#8217;t even budge a muscle. That makes me feel secure and protected. I stir my shoulders. The plaster embraces me tightly. I should not be scared. For all I know the body cast is a step towards my recovery. It helps me to heal. And what is more important, it reduces the pain by immobilizing my bogy completely. I breathe a sigh of relief. Just one thing troubles me. My legs are stretched wide apart. Was it necessary? It makes me feel awkward. They must have had a good reason to do that. Nevertheless, I feel vulnerable. Something pops up in my mind. Nora&#8217;s sister�Connie, her casted legs were spread like that when�What &#8216;s going on with me? I am aroused! I can&#8217;t believe it! My body is shattered and immobilized but despite that, I am aroused. What a miracle! I giggle. My left hand slips under the sheet.
&nbsp;&nbsp; The hinges creak and the door opens. Dr. Conners enters. I flush, startled by the unexpected visit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; �How is my broken angel today?� he asks playfully.
&nbsp;&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t see any angels here, just a tortoise lying helplessly on her back,� I answer.
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Very smart, miss Angelbeck! Do you like your carapace?�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Do I have any options?�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �No.�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �It&#8217;s cool,� I say.
&nbsp;&nbsp; �The X-rays showed that the traction could be removed. You have a great number of fractures. I applied the body cast so that to immobilize you completely. I know that you are embarrassed but��
&nbsp;&nbsp; �I understand. You don&#8217;t have to apologize. You are very kind to me.�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �It looks like Nora forgot something,� Dr. Conners says.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He takes a towel and starts cleaning my toes. The tips of his fingers tenderly touch them now and then. He is entirely preoccupied with this task. I feel that my heart starts beating faster. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Thank you,� I say as he finishes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �I have to go,� he answers pensively.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah hour later Nora gives me the daily sponge bath.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �How long did it take to apply the cast?� I ask.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �About an hour.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Tell me more, please!�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �At first Dr. Conners removed the traction and the cast on your left leg. I cut the bandages holding the splint in place. Then Jessica and I gripped your arms and lifted you up so that the splint to be pulled out. After that, you were X-rayed. Dr. Conners studied the pictures and decided to apply the cast. Two slings were slipped on under your armpits and strapped together. You were hoisted in upright position. Your feet were hanging limply few inches above the floor, your head bent down. What a sight! Poor thing! Then we started to work. At first, we plastered your legs and propped them on a low table. The bar was moulded in place. Then we continued upward. To tell you the truth, you have perfect tits. It is to be regretted that we had to cover them with plaster. I am Sorry. That&#8217;s all.�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �It seems that almost everyone in this hospital have seen me stark naked.�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �I should not be worried about that. We are professionals. We are just doing our job. Moreover, you do not have a reason to feel ashamed. I have to assure you, you are the hospital&#8217;s belle,� Nora says and giggles.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; I notice that Nora is walking with a limp.
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Nora, are you injured?� I ask.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; She reddens.
&nbsp;&nbsp; �I� I twisted my ankle. The stairs were wet and I slipped. It&#8217;s not serious.�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �When did it happen?�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Two hours ago. I am fine. Don&#8217;t worry about me! By the way, do you want me to wash your hair?�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �No. Thank you, Nora.�
&nbsp;&nbsp; She nods and hobbles out of the room.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Chapter 11 &#8211; In The Dead Of Night
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; It is night. The darkness is almost impenetrable. Only my body cast gleams out white. As though, it is trying to illuminate the room. I turn my head toward the window. The sky is starless. I see a strip of light under the door. It can&#8217;t chase the darkness away. I am tense. Something has awakened me in this ungodly hour. I am trying to figure out what. Was it the dream that awakened me? No, it wasn&#8217;t the dream. Something else. The darkness is frightening. I have never been so afraid of the dark. It&#8217;s different now. I am so helpless. I fumble for the light switch but can&#8217;t find it. Someone is sitting on a chair beside me. In spite of the fact that I can&#8217;t see or hear anything, I am sure that someone is sitting beside me. The presence is clearly perceptible. Possibly, the woman who tried to kill me was here. My heart starts to beat faster. The rustling of clothes is now audible.
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Who is there?�&nbsp; I ask with quivering voice.
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Don&#8217;t be afraid! It&#8217;s me.�
&nbsp;&nbsp; I relax when I hear Dr. Conners&#8217;s voice.
&nbsp;&nbsp; �What are you doing here? You scared me out of my wits!�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �I am sorry. I just wanted to talk to you.�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Now! Isn&#8217;t it a bit late? By the way, could you please turn on the light?�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t want everybody to know that I am here.�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �OK, but why?�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Pamela, I like you very much. You are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. My words may seem stupid to you but this is the truth,� he says and squeezes my uncasted hand lightly.�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Dr. Conners, I am so surprised. Maybe we should talk when I get better.�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Please call me David!�
&nbsp;&nbsp; He is caressing my hand.
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Look, David��
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Are you afraid of me, Pam?�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �No but��
&nbsp;&nbsp; �If you don&#8217;t like me I won&#8217;t bother you anymore. I know that you feel vulnerable.�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Of course I feel vulnerable. Look at me!�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �I won&#8217;t take advantage of your helplessness. I just wanted to express my feelings,� David says. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; �I am surprised that someone considers me attractive... right now.� 
&nbsp;&nbsp; �You are attractive!�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �What makes me so attractive to you, my mangled body or the huge cast?� I ask indignantly.
&nbsp;&nbsp; He let go of my hand.
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Don&#8217;t talk like that, Pam! I am not a sadist. I must admit though, that the body cast is adding more femininity to your personality. You are immobilized, helpless and you need so much care. I am so sorry that you have to endure all this pain. I am trying to do my best to help you.�
&nbsp;&nbsp; I don&#8217;t answer. Then I hear him pacing toward the door.
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Good night, Pamela,� he says. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Please, stay!� 
&nbsp;&nbsp; David sits on the bed beside me. The weight of his body joggles me lightly. He places his hands on my shoulders and squeezes gently. Then, I feel his lips on my face. They trace its way across my face, finally finding my mouth. We kiss each other passionately. I put my tongue in motion, tickling his lips. He moans. His hands move up my neck and start caressing my face. Using my good hand, I embrace him. The touches of his fingers are very gentle, as if he is exploring my features. Then he kisses my forehead. Moving his lips sideways, he finds my ear. He bites playfully at it. I am tense. Unconsciously, I am trying to move my plastered body. The cast restrains me. My erect nipples press against the inner side of the cast. I feel moistness between my legs. David slides his fingers under the cast. Kneading my breasts, he almost reaches my nipples. I groan with pleasure. To my frustration, he stops. I hear his footsteps on the tiled floor. Then I feel that the big toe of my left foot is in his mouth. He sucks it. After that, his tongue explores my toes one by one. It is unbelievable. If the body cast wasn&#8217;t so solid, it would have cracked under the pressure of my tensed muscles. I utter a low cry and reach under the sheet covering my private parts. David&#8217;s hand stops me. He teases my clit with the tips of his fingers, then with his tongue. I reward him with a juicy orgasm. Groping around, I get hold of his belt. He helps me to unbuckle it. His erection is enormous.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �I won&#8217;t risk hurting you, Pam,� David says.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �OK,� I answer and rub his penis eagerly. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It erupts in my hand. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We talk for a while, and then we start again. It is indescribable.

THE END&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
