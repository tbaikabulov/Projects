The agreement

Synopsis: He finally found employment, but in an unexpectated place. 






As my luck would have it, i began 2009 unemployed. I had a little bit of reserve cash, enough for a couple months, but that was it. I was having some difficulty finding work, so i figured i might as well have some fun.&nbsp; I got in touch with a dominant ladyfriend of mine whom i had served before and inquired if she needed any maidservice. She was very interested. This was a friend who owned a large home in the area and threw some of the biggest swinger, alt lifestyle and fetish parties around. She needed help getting ready for a party that evening.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Well, after arriving and getting changed into my uniform,(corset, fishnets, 5 inch heels, petticoat and maids dress) I set about taking instructions and cleaning to get ready for the party. As i did we caught up with what was going on in outr lives. For me it was about my unemployment and how i was struggling while she spoke of her parties getting bigger each week, almost to the point of it being too much for her. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once the party began, she asked if i could stay and serve, which i did gladly. While at the party she seemed to enjoy introducing me as her maid and i frequently saw her speaking with this person or that while pointing and looking at me. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the party was over i changed and before leaving I wished her well and told her&nbsp; to feel free to call me if she needed me. A week went by and i still hadn't heard from her. I was about to call her when the phone rang. It was her asking me if i could come over. I asked if she was having aother party and she said no, she just wanted me to come over to speak with me about something. I packed my clothes and off i went.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When i arrived the place was empty except for her, which was unusual. She welcomed me in, guided me into the office just off her bedroom and had me sit across from her. She started out by asking me how much i took home per month when i was working. I let her know i took home about $2800.00 and grossed about $3600.00. She thought for a moment and said that if i was an independent contractor and claimed to make $15.00 an hour, that would give me about a $600.00 tax liability. She paused again then asked how i would feel if i could make $3500 or more a month working 4 days a week, 45 hours total, for her. Doing what i enjoy, being a maid. At this point she slides a piece of paper titled "Service Agreement". In it it states just what she just told me, that i would be paid a minimum of $3500.00 per month working 45 hours over 4 days.
It also stated that i would be required to follow any and all instructions given by her as well as accept any punishment, discipline or training she may deem necessary. The only exceptions allowed being nothing involving children, animals, scat, purpously drawing blood or causing permanent injury.
There was also a clause stating that i would be paid&nbsp; monthly and that if during any 2 month period my pay didn't average $3500.00 a month, I could end the agreement. Otherwise the agreement will remain in force for 1 year from the date signed.
At this point she said that i could either agree, after which we could go over the finer details, or i could not agree, at which point i could leave and there would be no hard feelings.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To me it sounded too good to be true and so i asked about the finer details. She explained that everything i needed to know in order to sign was right in front of me. I thought about it for a minute and asked for a pen. she handed me a pen and pulled out a pocket camcorder. Asking me to smile and wave to the camera before i signed and explaining it was her first contract and wanted to capture the moment. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once signed she sent me home to grab my uniforms and such, letting me know i could store them there and that we will go over details when i return. On my return she led me to the attached guest apartment the house had, letting me know i could store my things in the walk in closet there. She told me to put away my things, get dressed, then come and find her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once finished I enter the main house and down the hallway, my heels clicking on the tiled floor. I step out into the living room and there she is on the couch. She motions me over to her and tosses a throw pillow on the floor in front of her, telling me to kneel. She tells me that first we're going to go over the basics, and that i should save my questions until we're done.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;First of all, while our relationship in the past may have been casual, that's no longer the case. I am to adress her as Miss Tanya in public and simply Ma'am in private. I am to obey her or anyone she places in charge of me without hesitation and while it may be o.k. to question how to accomplish a task, it's not o.k. to question the task. No puoting or expressions of anger or discontent will be allowed, especially in public. Finally, I am not allowed to ask that the agreement end, or even hint at it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Standard dress will be a heels with a minimum height of 4 1/2 inches, and platforms don't count. If the shoe has an inch of platform, the heel better be 5 1/2 inches. Open toed shoes require polished toes. Stockings can be sheer, fishnet, keyhole ar lace, but must have a backseam.Ruffled matching pantes. Corset with garters, and yes we will be doing waist training. Proper unform and apron as well as locking maids collar. A wig will be worn or your hair done properly. full make up. fingernails will be painted and must match if toes are&nbsp; painted.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You will be clean shaven at all times and no body hair is allowed from the neck down. You will maintain your hair, makeup and dress throughout the workday. Shoes will be clean and scuff free, stockings snag free and backseams always straight. Uniform wrinkle, lint and stain free.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your work week will begin at 7:00 p.m wednesday and you will be in service until noon on sunday, with each full day counting as 13 hrs worked, after all you'll be sleeping 8 hours, have a 1/2 hour in the morning and before bed to yourself plus the last 10 minutes of every hour is breaktime.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She then says that i might be wondering how she can afford to pay me what the agreement states. Well, she plans on renting me out!
She explains how she knows a great deal of people and a lot of the people who attend her parties are quite well off. Regular maid service is in the realm of $50.00 an hour, so your "special" kind of service is worth at least that much. What really made it all possible is one gentleman, a tranny chaser who's almost always at my parties. When he heard about what i planned for you, he wanted your services for 5 hours every friday and was willing to pay $600.00 a week for it, which is chump change to him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I tried to interrupt her at this point, to tell her that i thought i would be serving her, but was cut shortby her basically telling me to shut the fuck up if i knew what was good for me.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She then explained the breakdown of my week. I would be given a key to the back apt. and the code for the gate. I would park in back by the stables, enter the apartment and get ready, then come into the main house and present myself no later than 7:30 p.m. Thursday night would be spent catching up on the chores from the days i was off as well as training/refining my skills/look/composure/attitude. Off duty at 1:00 a.m. and expected to be dressed and back on duty by 10:00 a.m.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your thursdays are going to be serving others for hire. broken down into 3 periods from 11:00 a.m. until 2:00 p.m., at which time i will pick you up and drop you off at your next assignment which is from 2:30 p.m. until 5:30 p.m. Then i'll bring you back here, you rest a bit, get something to eat before your last assignment which is from 7:00 p.m until 11:00 p.m. Then it's back here and lights out at 1:00 a.m.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You're back in service at 10:00 a.m. and you work around here for me until your 6:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m assignment, then you're back here until 1:00 a.m.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then saturday you're all mine until noon on sunday, which is the end of your week.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;OFor your thursday assignments i'm going to be charging $200.00, $200.00 and $300.00 respectinley 3 hours of having a sissymaid who will obey all orders is a steal for $200.00 so i doubt i'll have any problems filling those slots. As a matter of fact for the next 4 weeks i've already filled 7 of the 12 slots available to the tune of $1600.00. Add that to the 4 gauranteed fridays for $2400.00 and i've more than covered your wages.
i have no reason to believe that i won't fill every slot on thursdays, which would mean $1300.00 per week. Multiply that by 4.33 weeks a month and it comes out to $5600.00 a month. You get your $3500.00 plus 20% of the remaining $2100.00. Which means i get about $1600.00 plus about 25 hoursof free maidservice to help with my parties and to clean up after me, and one look at my closet and anyone can see i need it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She continues by telling me that i will be expected to be on my best behavior at all times and will continually work at improving my services. Any rough spots will be dealt with using corrective discipline. disobedience and carelessness will be met with harsh punishments, and i should make no mistake, she's not at all opposed to taking a cane to my ass and this ain't play, so i can forget about safewords.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She also informs me that i will be required to wear and hand over the key to my chastity device. It's a "lori's spiral #12" that threads through a frenum piercing and locks with a tubular high security lock. This i will wear whether on or off duty, 24/7. She may be inclined to let me out of it 4 a few hours every couple months or so, but only if i'm on my best behavior and even then, only if she feels like it. I should expect nothing.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When i'm on my assignments i will also be fitted with a locking plug harness to prevent access to my ass, my mouth however will be free for them to use as they see fit. Your assignments will also be allowed to discipline and punish you as thet see fit, as long as they don'tviolate the limits of the agreement you signed. or they can simpy report any problems to me. You should also consider yourself subservient to anyone else in this house at any time and will be expected to obey them as you would me although if you feel something is out of line or conflicts with any of my orders, you are allowwed to clear it with me first.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finally, if you ask to be let out of this agreement or attempt to undermine it, sabotage it or otherwise attempt to break it for any reason other than what is stated in the agreement, it will automatically be extended by 6 months. If you choose to go M.I.A. i know enough people that i can find someone to bring you to me and the agreement will be extended an additional year.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All i could do was kneel there in stunned silence.
