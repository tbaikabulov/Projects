Julie
Taylor had been in the rebel service for more than four years.� The empire was a formidable enemy.� The rebels need many fighters.� Because of new recruits always coming in and fighters
getting killed, Julie had moved up in rank rather quickly.� Only 29 years old, Julie had already achieved
the rank of Captain.

&nbsp;

Her
big accomplishment had been learning to pilot a space yacht before enlisting.� She had studied and worked hard at it.� A pilot�s certification, even just a yacht
certification was enough to get her on the fast track.

&nbsp;

This
was Julie�s first assignment at a Captain.�
On this assignment, Julie and her crew were assigned to the Vegan sector
as scouts.� A yacht is a pleasure craft
in times of peace, so it isn�t equipped with heavy plating or significant
weapons.� Even with the additions made to
the yacht, it was not really a fighting vessel.�
It was their assignment to patrol the Vegan sector posing as traders,
and report on empire troop movements, and anything else they can find out.

&nbsp;

Julie�s
crew of four was entirely human.� Each of
them was given a cover identity as a convicted criminal with a bounty on
his/her head if they were ever returned to earth.

&nbsp;

The
three others in Julie�s crew were all men.�
Carl Sandford was her second in command.�
Carl was a large man.� At 35 years
old, Carl held the rank of Commander.�
Sandford seemed to enjoy his position as second with no desire to move
up.� If he ever had to take command,
however, he was a well trained and seasoned veteran.

&nbsp;

The
other crewmen, Emil Sanchez, age 28 and Hank Brener, age 38 were both enlisted
men.� Both of them had a rather rough and
tumble attitude.� They were constantly
disobeying minor orders and getting into trouble.� Never big trouble, but they were always in
it.� Given their current assignment,
these rough characters were probably made to order.� Brener was actually an experienced pilot as
well.� He didn�t have a license however,
since his pilot experience was derived entirely from hijacking yachts in
civilian life.� In fact, it wasn�t
necessary to invent a convict background for Brener since he actually was
wanted by the authorities.

&nbsp;

---- o ----

&nbsp;

The
Vegans are a war-like race.� They appear
to be half-humanoid and half-reptile.� To
many humans, they have the appearance of devils.� Their war-like mannerisms did nothing to
alleviate this impression.

&nbsp;

Despite
their love of warfare, the Vegans were neutral in this war.� There was no love between the Vegans and the
empire.� The majority of the Vegans
probably favored the rebels.� 

&nbsp;

The
Vegan sector was too close to the empire to really be an independent power.� Any attempt by the Vegans to oppose the
empire would be put down in short order.�
After several failed attempts to show their independence from the
empire, the Vegans had reluctantly settled for an official position of
neutrality.

&nbsp;

The
official government position aside, a few Vegans had individually joined the
fight on the rebel side.� Julie and her
crew had been briefed by a Vegan, Arnad, before taking their current assignment.� The Vegan wanted to join Julie�s mission, but
he was too easily recognized on his own world as a rebel soldier.� Sympathy with the cause was one thing, but
openly opposing the government�s official neutrality meant he was subject to
execution if caught.

&nbsp;

Their
session with Arnad was interesting.�
Arnad explained to them many of the customs and beliefs of his people,
information that would prove vital later in the mission.� Arnad also briefed the crew on the various
government officials including who has real power and information and who is
just a figure head.� This too would be
valuable later on.� This Vegan was
war-like but at the same time very friendly.

&nbsp;

Despite
his helpfulness and his friendly demeanor, Julie was repulsed by Arnad�s
appearance.� His lizard-like qualities
were difficult for Julie to accept.�
Julie found herself staying as far from Arnad as possible and still in
the briefing room.� For their part, the male
members of the crew saw Arnad as �a damn ugly dude,� but they could look past
his appearance and appreciate his help.

&nbsp;

Arnad
saw the male crew members as just another species.� He was neither attracted nor repulsed by
their appearance.� The female however he
found captivating.� He had trouble taking
his eyes off of her.� He was not used to
a female without scales.� For that matter
he was not used to a female who spoke, listened and understood anything other
than the most basic commands.� Vegan
females are non-sentient and incapable of verbal communication.� Vegan males own their females and care for
them as one would care for any other dumb animal.

&nbsp;

At
first, Julie was worried about her undisciplined crew.� Try as she might, she had not been able to
whip them into shape.� In fact, it became
obvious that Sanchez and Brener had been exchanging vulgar jokes about their
female leader.� Julie worried that the
lack of respect for her as Captain of the ship would result in confusion and
disaster when they went into action.

&nbsp;

--- o ---

&nbsp;

Their
first action was a surprise encounter with an empire scout ship.� While a scout ship is small in the overall
empire force, it was nonetheless three times the size of Julie�s yacht and
heavily armed.� Julie�s yacht was in an
area where the yacht should not be.� The
Yacht heaved to and prepared to be boarded.�
Communicating with the Captain of the scout ship, Julie had stated she
was lost and had taken a wrong turn.

&nbsp;

Three
empire troops stepped out of the air lock and onto the bridge of the space
yacht.� Sandford and Sanchez played along
as bumbling crew members of a civilian craft totally off course.� It would be only a matter of time before they
found the sophisticated communications and artillery that had been added to
this �civilian� craft.� 

&nbsp;

As
Julie spoke to the leader of the three troops, Sandford quickly and� quietly wrapped a cord around the neck of one
of the troops.� Momentarily startled, the
other two turned to look at their now dying comrade.� As they did, Sanchez plunged his knife into
the abdomen of another trooper and Julie did the same to the leader.

&nbsp;

--- o ---

&nbsp;

While
his three shipmates were disposing of the boarding party, Brener had positioned
himself in the forward hold.� It would be
normal procedure for the boarding party to order the hatches opened on the hold
so that the crew of the scout ship could look inside.� Thus no alarm was raised when the hatch cover
of the forward hold began to open.

&nbsp;

By
the time the scout ship crew saw the cannon inside the hold, Brener already had
the gun trained on the scout ship bridge.�
His first shot took out the bridge and its occupants.� Without an order to open fire, the gunners on
the scout ship hesitated long enough for Julie and crew to push the engines to
full speed.

&nbsp;

The
yacht was out of sight and range before the scout ship could even react.� Julie�s crew had performed their duties.� It was all she could hope for from her them.

&nbsp;

--- o ---

&nbsp;

The
crew became closer knit after the incident with the scout ship.� Julie knew that in the engine room she was
still the butt of many sexually oriented jokes and vulgar comments.� Even so, the crew was a much friendlier group
and everyone felt that the others had his back.

&nbsp;

For
the next few months, the yacht kept a semi-regular schedule between three or
four systems, hauling one commodity or another from world to world.� Had they been the real commercial venture
they were pretending to be, they would have actually made a profit!

&nbsp;

Their
access to the sector gave them the ability to monitor empire activities in the
sector.� They gained as much information
on the ground, chatting with other merchants, as they did from their own
observations in space.

&nbsp;

--- o ---

&nbsp;

The
empire was putting more and more pressure on the Vegan home world to join the
war on the empire�s side.� Empire troops
were already moving into what should have been a neutral zone.� As the number of empire troops grew, it put
more and more pressure on the Vegan government to abandon its neutrality.

&nbsp;

Given
the war-like demeanor of the populous, the government�s position was become
less and less tolerable.

&nbsp;

--- o ---

&nbsp;

It
was generally known that the lizardmen of Vega were desirous of humanoid
females.� The women of Vega are not
sentient and so are kept by Vegan men as property.� The idea of smooth skin women who can speak
intelligently was a concept few Vegan men believed until they were actually
exposed to it.

&nbsp;

At
first, the Vegans tried to buy human women.�
At that point, they were told that human women are not property and
cannot be bought and sold.

&nbsp;

Without
the ability to buy human females, the Vegans were at a loss.� In their culture they had never developed any
sort of courtship or romance.� 

&nbsp;

Because
of their lizard-like appearance, even their attempts to entice hookers had for
the most part failed.

&nbsp;

So
it was into this situation that Julie arrived.�


&nbsp;

The
yacht landed on the Vegan home world after seven months in the sector.� By now, they were fairly well known as
traders.� While the incident with the
empire scout ship was also well known, no one had associated the human misfits
with that incident.

&nbsp;

Rebel
command had informed them that a mutual-defense treaty between the Empire and
the Vegans was imminent.� Their job was
to verify this and, if possible, stop it.

&nbsp;

It
would not be possible to get anywhere near the Vegan Prime Minister.� It was possible, however, to find his
undersecretary for foreign worlds drinking in a bar near the capital.� 

&nbsp;

Sandford
approached the undersecretary and struck up a conversation over a few
drinks.� It didn�t take long for the two
to get on a first name basis.� Thank
goodness for the universal translator.

&nbsp;

Sandford
learned that the secretary had a harem of six females and he had eight
children.� To his horror, Sandford
learned that it was common for the father to eat his young immediately after
birth if he didn�t want additional children.�
In this way, he was able to insure five sentient male offspring even
though the birth rate of non-sentient females is three to one over the males.� One of his daughters had already been sold
and the other two were for sale.

&nbsp;

Sandford�s
assignment was to get information about the empire treaty, but it was the one
subject the secretary would not discuss even in his drunken state.

&nbsp;

Sanford finally decided to go to plan B.� From his jacket pocket, Sandford produced a
picture of Julie in a skimpy bathing suit.�
The secretary immediately put down his drink and looked at his drinking
companion.

&nbsp;

�What�s
this?�� asked the secretary.

&nbsp;

�Something
I have for sale.� It�s a valuable
commodity.�

&nbsp;

�I
was under the impression that humans don�t sell their females.�

&nbsp;

�Law
abiding humans don�t.� You can check with
anyone you like.� I am not
law-abiding.� In fact, if I ever return
to Earth, I will probably be executed.�

&nbsp;

The
secretary smiled and looked once again at the picture of Julie.� �How much?�

&nbsp;

Over
the next half hour, Sandford and the secretary haggled over the price.� Once it was agreed upon, the two shook
hands.� They agreed to meet at Sandford�s
space yacht in half an hour.

&nbsp;

This
would be a difficult assignment for Julie.�
The information the secretary could provide could turn the war.� Julie was no different than most humans in
that she had an instinctive repulsion to lizards.� To help her through this, Julie had taken a sedative.� While it dulled her senses, she still
remained alert and aware of what was happening.�
It was a sensation similar to floating outside one�s body.

&nbsp;

When
Sandford and the secretary met again at the yacht, Sanchez and Brener were
standing next to a cage.� Inside the cage
was Julie wearing a skimpy bikini.� Julie
was lying on the floor of the cage, apparently sleeping, but actually awake.

&nbsp;

The
secretary kneeled down next to the cage and reached inside.� He stroked Julie�s hair and then her smooth
skin.� The secretary pulled on the top of
Julie�s bikini until it came off and then proceeded to do the same with the
bottom.� He smiled at Sandford as he
handed him the now discarded bikini.� For
Julie�s part, she felt the touch of the rough reptilian hand, but was not
repulsed by it due to her sedative.

&nbsp;

The
secretary paid Sandford the agreed upon price.�
The Secretary�s driver, together with Sanchez and Brener loaded Julie�s
cage on the back of the secretary�s vehicle.�
Once the cargo was secure, the vehicle left at full speed.

&nbsp;

�Well
boys, nothing left to do but wait�

&nbsp;

On
the way back to his residence, the secretary had phoned ahead and ordered his
staff to put all of his females into their cages before he arrived.

&nbsp;

On
arrival, the secretary entered through the front door.� The driver then went to the back door to
unload the cargo.� The chief of staff
examined the sleeping girl.� One day he
hoped to own such a prize.� Till then he
could just look and appreciate.

&nbsp;

After
the cage was lowered to the ground, the chief opened the lock and brought Julie
out.� He placed a metal collar around her
neck.� It was actually a collar made for
an immature female.� A full size Vegan
female collar would be much too big for Julie.

&nbsp;

Once
he had her on her feet, he thought about the bikini that she had been wearing.� He wondered to himself why these silly humans
cover themselves in pieces of material.�
Vegans, male and female, wear small items to denote their rank in the
military or government.� Other than that
they have no use for these things.� The
human practice confused him.

&nbsp;

A
leash was attached to Julie�s collar to lead her into the secretary�s
room.� Again, the Vegans had a practical
purpose for doing this.� Their
non-sentient females were somewhat wild and could pose a threat if they became
upset.� The collar and leash were a
safety precaution.� The Chief led Julie
to the secretary�s chamber.� There he
attached the collar to a hook on the wall and left her standing in one corner
of the room.� Julie didn�t see a bed or
chair or couch.� She wasn�t sure how this
was going to be done.

�

Julie
was in the secretary�s chamber for only a few moments when the secretary
himself entered.� He came over to her and
began to fondle her without speaking a word.�
Why should he?� The females on his
planet wouldn�t understand anything he said.�
Despite the drug, Julie had to concentrate to hold down her revulsion.� With much effort, she was able to do so.

&nbsp;

Because
of his different physical make-up, the secretary�s groin area was below Julie�s
even though he was a foot taller than she.�
Julie looked at the secretary�s genital area.� She saw what she assumed to be his
penis.� It was small and short; no more
than two or three inches long.� The
secretary pressed himself to Julie.

&nbsp;

With
his reptilian finger, the secretary began playing with Julie�s nipples.� In a surprising way, it felt good to
Julie.� The secretary�s skin was rough
and scaly and produced an interesting feeling as it rubbed against her tit.

&nbsp;

At
first Julie felt just a little tickle around her pussy.� She assumed that was the secretary�s pitiful
penis.� After a few moments, his penis
penetrated her pussy and became hard and erect.�
Then it grew and it grew some more.�
She was amazed at the sensation.�
The penis was now at least nine inches into her and it was growing wider
and wider.� If she hadn�t been high on
the drug, she might have been worried at this point.

&nbsp;

The
secretary wrapped his arms around Julie in a strong embrace.� She could tell immediately that he was much
stronger than a human.� He held her tight
to him as she felt a new, strange sensation.�
Something was trying to push into her anus, but his penis was still in
her pussy.� She was confused in part from
the drug but in part because this just didn�t make any sense.

&nbsp;

In
a few minutes, Julie had been double penetrated and both penises had grown to
enormous size.� The secretary was now
rocking his hips back and forth and as he did, the two penises were moving in
and out of her.� She was starting to
enjoy this when something else unexpected happened to her.

&nbsp;

She
was slapped, rather forcefully, right on her backside.� A moment later, she was spanked again and
this time it seemed to be coming from the opposite side.� She was still held tight in the secretary�s
grip, but she tried to turn her head to see who was spanking her.� There didn�t seem to be anyone else in the room.� For a long time, this remained a mystery to
Julie, but she would eventually find out that it was the secretary�s tail that
was whipping around and spanking her.

&nbsp;

As
she turned her head back to the secretary, his tongue shot out from his face
and entered her mouth.� His tongue was
powerful and not to be denied.� It found
its way into her throat.� At first she
wanted to panic thinking she wouldn�t be able to breathe.� Somehow, though, she had no trouble
breathing.� Again, she would later find
out that in the Vegan anatomy, air from the lungs is exhaled through openings
in the tongue and so she was receiving air even though the secretary�s tongue
filled her mouth and throat.

&nbsp;

At
this point, the secretary released his embrace of her and went back to playing
with her tits.� He was now pinching and
pulling her nipples.

&nbsp;

The
multi-sensations cascading into Julie were somewhat overwhelming.� She was literally being fucked in all three
holes at once, having her nipples pinched and being spanked all by the same man
err creature.� Julie had an orgasm.

&nbsp;

There
was twenty minutes during which the secretary continued his assault on Julie�s
sensations.� During that time, Julie had
at least four orgasms.� Finally the
secretary came as well.� His fluid came
into her from both penises and from his tongue.�
The volume was overwhelming and Julie was starting to choke this
time.� Eventually the secretary was
spent.

&nbsp;

As
he disengaged from her Julie got a look at his dual penises.� They were both flaccid now and hung all the
way to the ground between his feet.� In
moments, however, they both began to retract into his body and disappear.� The secretary left Julie attached to the wall
by her collar while he cleaned himself up.

&nbsp;

The
phone rang.� The Chief told the secretary
that the Prime Minister was on the phone and then put the PM through.� This is what Julie had been waiting for.� Neither of them would give a second thought
to a female in the room.

&nbsp;

The
conversation went on and Julie listened in.�
The empire�s ambassador would be arriving to sign the peace treaty.� The PM wanted the secretary to sign for the
Vegans.� All the details of the
ambassador�s shuttle were discussed including the route and the arrival
time.� Julie had everything she needed.

&nbsp;

Moments
later, the secretary left the room, leaving Julie by herself.� It would be a simple matter for her to unhook
the leash from the wall, but she decided to continue to play stupid.� She figured that she had a few minutes before
the Chief would come to retrieve her.�
She reached her left hand into her mouth and found a molar on her upper
jaw.� Grabbing it tightly, she gave a
twist.� She heard the distinctive
click.� She knew help would be on the
way.

&nbsp;

Brener
was watching the monitor when the signal appeared.� The small GPS tracking signal in Julie�s
mouth had been activated.� It not only
told them where she was but also signaled that she had completed the mission
and needed to be extracted.

&nbsp;

Under
cover of night, the crew approached the secretary�s home.� The GPS indicator led them, not to the main
building, but to an out building.� The
out building wasn�t even locked or guarded.�
The building was filled with stalls and cages for the secretary�s harem.� They quickly located the cage that contained
Julie.

&nbsp;

Julie
was awake and waiting for them to arrive.�
She knew that when they found her naked, it would only fuel the vulgar
jokes about her but she didn�t care, she had the information that could win the
war.

&nbsp;

Sanchez
released Julie from the cage and helped her out of it.� He did take a second look at her nude body,
but then he took off his jacket and put it around her.� Sanchez�s jacket barely covered her, but at
least it was something.

&nbsp;

In
short order, they reached the stolen ground vehicle and headed back to the
yacht.� Brener was still in the yacht
when they arrived and had everything set for launch as soon as the doors were
secure.� Julie barely got into her seat
before the G force hit her.� It was not
until three hours later, when they left orbit and headed into space, that she
was able to go to her cabin and get some clothes.

&nbsp;

Julie
reported her findings to the rebel command.�
A plot was hatched immediately to intercept the Ambassador�s ship with
warships that would appear Vegan.� The
Ambassador was given just enough time to report back to the empire that he was
under attack from the Vegans before his ship was blasted to pieces.

&nbsp;

The
incident sparked an immediate war between the empire and the Vegans.� The Vegans were forced to ally themselves
with the rebels in order to survive.� The
plot to have the Vegans join the empire was completely crushed.

&nbsp;

On
Vega, the secretary was accused of treason.�
It was reasoned that the PM had told no one other than the secretary of
the details of the ambassador�s flight.�
Therefore, the secretary is the only one who could have told the rebels
where to intercept him.� The thought that
they had been undone by a female never crossed anyone�s mind.� The Secretary was executed in a gruesome
manner.� Under Vegan law he was literally
torn to pieces by his own body guards.

&nbsp;

Julie
is still in the rebel command, somewhat of a heroine now, and has command of a
much larger and more powerful ship.�
Sandford is still her second in command and Sanchez and Brener are both
part of her crew.� She trusts no one as
much as she trusts these three.� There is
an occasional new crewman who makes a vulgar remark in the engine room about
the female captain.� Such incidents are
quickly and forcefully discouraged by Sanchez and Brener.

&nbsp;

Oh,
and one other thing.� Arnad, the Vegan
rebel, is also now a part of Julie�s crew.�
Julie is no longer repulsed by the appearance of Vegans and she and
Arnad have become close.� In fact rumor
has it that they are having an affair!
