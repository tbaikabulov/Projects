I walked into my apartment when I noticed that the light was on in the living room. I walked silently up behind the chair where I saw him sitting. I reached towards my boot and his voice startled me, �I wouldn&#8217;t do that if I was you.� His warning was followed by a circle of men around me. I slowly stood straight, realizing that if I fought back, I&#8217;d loose. �You thought you could hide forever? Did you really think I&#8217;d never find you?� He stood and turned, and I saw the mark I had left on his face, a scar from above his eyebrow down to his cheek and an eye patch covering the eye that was now useless. �I must admit, you were quite good at getting away. We almost had you in Paris, and we just missed you when you left Madrid, by hours. But three years was long enough, and you need to come home now.� He was in front of me, so close I could smell his sweet breath as he spoke. He gently stroked my face and ran his hand down to my neck, grabbing it slightly and punched me in the stomach. I wretched forward and hugged myself as I fell on my knees. �You haven&#8217;t even tried to beg for my forgiveness, Amelia. Have you nothing to say for yourself? No words to defend your actions?� I held my tongue, refusing to give him what he wanted. I managed to push myself up and faced him. I looked him in the eye as I spit in his face. He wiped it off and snapped his fingers. One of the men from the circle grabbed my arms and twisted them behind my back so my hands were grabbing my elbows. He tied them that way and put a gag in my mouth, a black bag over my head. I didn&#8217;t scream, because I didn&#8217;t want to give them any satisfaction. I didn&#8217;t fight back because I already knew I was as good as dead as it was. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His name was Leonardo and he had once been my master. To say once was, is actually false, for he is still my master by law, and I had escaped his prison three years ago, almost to the day. His home was lavish, to say the least, and he had more land than most in Arizona. Since the great war of America, the country went through a serious change, for women, the change was a bad one. Every woman was fair game, up for grabs. I had been neighbors with Leonardo before the war; I was 16 and knew that I was attractive. I was also a bitch, especially to him. He was 23 and I hated how he looked at me, and how he treated me like meat. Back then, I could stand up to him with no problem, no consequences. But then men got fed up with how women were so bitchy, so entitled, such teases to men, and they took power back. The war wasn&#8217;t just gender, it was politics. When Harold the Horrid, as I call him, took over the government, everything changed, and all the power went to the men, women became objects and slaves. I was 18 when the new laws took place and Leonardo barged into our home. With my father out of the picture, he sold my mother and took me to be his slave. I couldn&#8217;t deny that he was attractive; he worked out and took care of himself. He had blue eyes, dark brown, curly hair, and was 6&#8217;4&#8217;&#8217;. His chin was chiseled and perfect. His nose was like that of a great roman sculpture. And after a year of horrible treatment, rape, and humiliation, I decided I would sneak away in the night. The night I escaped, I took a blade to his face when he caught me, tearing through the side of his face and blinding him in his right eye. I stole $2,000 from his chest and took his car and drove towards Mexico, a safe haven for women lucky enough to get away. But now I was caught, my efforts just made into a joke as I am hauled out of my latest hold in England. Because of the international laws, he was free to take me back to Arizona with him. I kept quiet as his men threw me into a van and drove me away. He sat in the back with me and didn&#8217;t speak. His silence made me nervous because he always had something to say. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It took us about a day to get through all the legal passes in order to get back to the state. When we finally arrived, he let his hired men leave, paying them hefty amounts for their assistance. I was still tied up, the gag and the bag were removed, however, and I could see the house hadn&#8217;t changed much. He untied me and threw me to the floor. �You haven&#8217;t said a word to me, no apologies, no reasons to let you live. I do have the right to have you executed; I just want you to be aware of that. But worse than execution, I could sell you, to someone far worse than myself. Do you understand that?� I looked to the floor, my stomach churning at the thought of a man, old and gross, forcing his will upon me. As soon as the image was in my head, I grabbed his feet and started crying. I didn&#8217;t know what to say, I couldn&#8217;t speak even when I tried. He let me hold his ankles for about a minute before he spoke, �Amelia, either you give me a reason to keep you or I will sell you to a man so bad, so terrible, that most of his slaves lose a hand when they steal, forced to wear weights when caught trying to escape, and are often put on display in front of thousands at a time during his parties.� I started begging at that moment, �Master, please. I am sorry for what I did, I am sorry for running away. You were a good master and I know that now. I, I don&#8217;t know why I stayed away so long, I was ashamed, I couldn&#8217;t come back to you, I couldn&#8217;t see your face and feel safe anymore.� I was too afraid to look at his face, too afraid he would see through my lies. �Is that all you have to say for yourself? I don&#8217;t know, I think you&#8217;ll have to do more. I mean, we both know why you stayed away. We both know what you will be going through is far worse now than if you had come home sooner. Now really, make me want to keep you,� He turned his back toward me and took a few steps away. I knew what he wanted, and I knew what I had to do to stay in the better hell. �Master, I will do anything, anything you ask of me. I will do whatever you tell me to do. I won&#8217;t try to escape again.� My promise to do anything hung there, the tension building. �Darling, you know that you are easily replaced, and that you will bepunished for your crimes, right?� I nodded, still afraid to look at him. �Good, now let&#8217;s go get you cleaned up. You really are filthy from your little adventure. We will discuss how you will pay me back for what you&#8217;ve stolen from me as we scrub your filthy little body.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We got to the bathroom and began to run the water. �Strip,� his voice was stern, but sweet. I undressed slowly, carefully removing my clothes, one item at a time. He didn&#8217;t like the pace I was moving so he finished for me, ripping my clothes from my body with such force. I was thin, but toned. I had abs and my ass was round and firm. I had hair to my collarbone, dark brown with a streak of blonde on the side. My skin was olive and my eyes a shade of brown so dark that people said they were like black holes. I had the look of a woman who knew how to take care of herself, but that rough look was starting to fade as the realization became more and more fierce. I was caught, I was going to be punished, I was going to be hurt, and humiliated. I tried to cover myself, not used to the eyes watching my naked body yet. �Oh, don&#8217;t do that. You&#8217;ll just make me angry. There is no need to cover you up.� I let my hands fall to my side, still refusing to look him in the eye. �Get in,� he pointed to the water. I cautiously walked past him, afraid to get hit. He laughed silently and deep, mocking my fear that I didn&#8217;t have when he found me, only yesterday. �I thought it would be much harder to break you, but I&#8217;m glad to know you are such an easy one.� I got into the steamy water, my muscles loosening as the heat soaked into my aches. He grabbed my hair and put it into to a bun and then grabbed a loofa and some soap. He lathered my body in lavender, the same that he used before I left. He washed me in the same delicate way, as if he was going to stay delicate. �I want you to get on your hands and knees and spread your legs, I want to make sure you are clean for tonight.� I slowly changed my position and he grabbed a new tool. It was a loofa but it was on a stick. He got the soap on it and began to scrub my private areas. He then shoved the loofa up my pussy and I fell into the water, losing my grip. He grabbed my hair and pulled me out of the water and told me if I moved again, I would regret it. He then began to scrub my pussy with the loofa, going in and out slowly. He then told me to brace myself and warned me again not to move. He shoved the loofa up my asshole, not sogentle as when he began the bath. I yelped but made sure not to move. Tears ran down my cheek, my ass hadn&#8217;t had anything in it since I ran away and I wasn&#8217;t much a fan for it. He pulled the loofa out after scrubbing for what felt like forever, but was only 2 minutes. �Take your hair out and wash it while I go get the enema ready, to rinse you out.� I froze, �No! No, not that.� He slapped my face. �How dare you say no, as if you had a choice? As if I was asking for your permission. I will remind you that you are on thin ice.� With that he walked to the sink and prepared the enema. I washed my hair and waiting, a knot building in my belly. �Master, I&#8217;m sorry. I just. . . I really. . .� I didn&#8217;t finish my plea; I knew I&#8217;d still have to do it. He let the drain up and placed a butt plug on the tub side. Then he set the enema up on the hook and forced me on my hands and knees. He stuck the tube in my ass and I felt the bubble go in. he released the hook and the hot water began to flow into my bowels, filling me up. I began to feel bloated and the urge to empty myself grew stronger. My belly grew and my face distorted in pain as I filled. Finally the water was done and he told me to hold it in as he pulled out the tube or I would be sorry. I held my asshole as best I could, but some slipped out. I knew that counted against me, but he didn&#8217;t say anything. He grabbed the butt plug and slowly shoved it in my ass. �Stand up and dry off,� he ordered. I did but I couldn&#8217;t stand straight. I had a hard time getting out of the tub, it took me about a minute. I got dried off when the doorbell rang. I stood there and he slapped my face �Well go answer it you cunt,�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Suddenly, my urge to empty myself got stronger, as I was anxious to let a stranger in. I slowly walked to the door, but Leo didn&#8217;t like my pace. He grabbed the back of my neck with force and dragged me down the stairs. I yelped as he pushed me to the door. He still was holding my neck as I opened the door, trying to hide behind it. But he wouldn&#8217;t have any of that. He pulled the door wide open and forced the gentleman I was greeting to see all of me. Tears ran down my face and Leo squeezed my neck. �What do you say?� 
�Good evening kind sir, how may I please you tonight?�
The man on the other side of the door had an evil grin on his face. My bowels began to hurt extremely as the man asked to come in. I looked at Leo, and he nodded, so I turned to the man and motioned him inside. Apparently, that was the wrong way to let him in as Leo squeezed my neck and pushed me to the floor. I screamed and he slapped me. The man laughed as he walked past me and I turned bright red. �You know how to answer the damn door correctly; you couldn&#8217;t possibly have forgotten everything I taught you.� I looked up at the man, �Please come in, kind sir, Master will be right with you,� it sounded more like a question than a statement, but it was correct as Leo let go of me and I stood up. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Leo greeted the man as �Jose� and led him to his office. He then turned and told me to go finish washing up, but not to take the plug out of my ass. I walked up the stairs and back into the bathroom and looked in the mirror. I cried as it dawned on me that I was back to being Slave, not having a real name. I was back to being nothing for myself and everything that Master Leo told me to be.
