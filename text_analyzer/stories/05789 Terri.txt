Synopsis: Self bondage gone wrong when Terri gets discovered






Terri looked again at the map in her hands. According to it, there was a lot of empty space, some trees and a small village between where she planned on leaving the car, and where her adventure would start.

There was a footpath lined with trees that would take her around the village itself, but then she would have to cross the road, and that meant the possibility of getting caught. 

The keys to her cuffs were already stored in the car, with a set of clothing, nothing special, just a pair of jeans and a top, and a pair of slip on shoes. Very much what she was wearing now as she stood in the clearing. 

It was fine day, the sun not too hot, and no breeze. Her long blonde hair was tied back in a pony tail to keep it tidy, and out of the way. 

Terri had carried the travelling bag from the car, a bag she had bought cheap at a charity shop, so she could afford to throw it away and not worry over it. Taking one last look around, and seeing no-one anywhere close, she began to undress. She had decided not to wear underwear. All of her underwear at home was expensive, and she didn&#8217;t really want to lose any of it. Removing the top first, her breasts fell loose on her chest, breasts she was proud of. Slightly firm, but with enough droop to be able to tie them up. Had they been firm, she would probably have not been able to do exactly as she had planned.

Taking a small piece of thin rope, Terri passed it under one of her breasts, and with much trouble managed to bring it round and tie it tight. Her slightly soft breast was now as hard as a ball. It took her a few minutes to tie the other breast, cursing as it took her several attempts.

She could see already that her breasts were turning dark as the blood flow was restricted. The last time anyone had tied her breasts this way, she discovered it was the taking the ropes off which had caused more pain.

Removing her shoes and her jeans, Terri now stood naked apart from the ropes on her breasts. 

She looked at her watch. 10.30 am, plenty of time to get back to her car and home. 

The ball gag was the next item out of the bag. This ball gag was the largest in her collection, and she knew from previous experience that it would stretch her mouth to its fullest. Forcing the ball into her mouth, she passed the straps behind her head, fastened them, and put the small padlock through the hasp part. This was now on until she reached her car. From now Terri had little choice but to continue her adventure.

Bending down to pick the next rope out of her bag, Terri tied one end of the next rope around her leg, just above the knee. She tested that it was tight enough so it would not come down past her knee, even though she realised this would also restrict her blood flow slightly, but not enough to cause her any damage. Measuring the other end of the rope so that there was only four inches of clear rope between her knees, she tied that end around her other knee. Now her steps would be severely restricted, and would become more so when she tied the last rope in place around her ankles. Terri knew that by tying her legs so close together, she stood the chance of falling over, and would be unable to prevent it should she do so, but this was all a part of the task she had set herself.

Again, Terri checked her watch. 11.00 am, and now only the handcuffs to apply. She had several pairs of handcuffs in her collection, some rigid ones, and some with a small chain between them. She knew that had she chosen the rigid ones, she would not be able to release herself, so had chosen a pair with four chain links between the cuffs. This would allow her to be able to free herself when she reached her car again, but would still be restricting her ability to use her hands to prevent falling should she do so.

Terri clicked one half of the cuffs on her right wrist, and then bent down and placed her clothing back in her bag. This she managed to hide under a tree ready for collection later should she wish to retrieve them.

Thinking to her self �here goes� Terri placed her hands behind her back and with a final sigh. Locked the other end of the cuffs on her left wrist. Now she had no choice. It was make it back to her car, or get caught trying.

Taking the first few short steps Terri realised just how restricted she had made things. It was bad enough only being able to move her feet a few short inches at a time, but with the ropes around her knees as well, it seemed much harder, and made it more perilous, knowing she could fall at any moment.

The first part of the journey was fields, recently ploughed fields. She hoped the farmer would not be coming back today to re-plough, or to plant, not that she now had any choices should he have done so.

Terri lost count of the number of times she stumbled and fell, her sides hurting where she had caught stones where she landed. She could feel a pain on her upper thigh where one stone had been larger than the others, and she had landed on it. That was sure to bruise, she told herself.

It was slow going, and Terri had lost track of time. Eventually, she managed to cross the first field unseen, and took a break under the bushes. Her legs and ankles were hurting badly, and the one time she had fallen on her hands had made the cuffs dig deeply into her wrists. She thought they had bled, but could not be sure.

The next three fields proved much harder than Terri had thought they would be, the light rain overnight having transformed some of the earth into mud, soft enough when falling on it, but hard to move at only four inches per step. She had hoped that the morning sun would have dried them out, but although it was a fine day, the sun was not hot enough to take the moisture out of the ground yet.

Terri decided it must be well after lunch by the time she reached the bushes that ran around the village. She could hear a dog barking, and froze in her tracks. Looking through the bushes she could see a man and two dogs. The man was throwing sticks for the dogs, and they were happy collecting the sticks and returning them to the man. Terri knew she couldn&#8217;t move now until the man had gone. 

She waited,&nbsp; silently begging the man to go, but all in vain. He seemed quite happy to continue to throw them. One stick landed a few feet from her, and she held her breath as one of the dogs came bounding over, and started to sniff out the stick. The dog came closer and closer, and Terri thought it would only be a matter of time before the dog found her and announced her presence to the man, but, in the nick of time, the dog found it&#8217;s stick and ran back to the waiting man.

Terri didn&#8217;t know how long she lay under the bush waiting, but her breasts were hurting, her ankles and hands were aching, and she now needed to answer the call of nature. The bushes offered lots of cover, but she didn&#8217;t want the dog to discover her while she was watering the ground. She tried to hold on as long as possible, but eventually, she had no choice, and squatting in the bushes, let it flow. The feeling of relief was tremendous, and Terri forgot for a few moments that she was tied up, gagged, naked and only a few feet away from the chance of detection if the dog found her.

After what seemed like a lifetime to Terri, the man with the dogs finally moved away, and she was able to move again. It was only then that she realised she had been lying board still, and as she forced her way to her feet, her whole body ached. Hopefully, she wouldn&#8217;t have to hide for as long anymore between then and reaching her car.

It was still slow going, and now Terri&#8217;s stomach was rumbling, she needed to eat, but that also had to wait until she reached her car, still a long way off. After the episode with the man and his dogs, Terri was keeping a watchful eye on the path ahead, and straining her ears to hear anything that sounded like another presence close by.

It took her almost two hours to circumvent the village, but now she had the biggest obstacle of all, the road. Reduced to steps of only four inches, she knew she had to make sure there was absolutely no traffic coming in either direction. She also knew that should she fall, she could do herself some serious damage.

Peering through the hedgerow Terri saw a tractor moving away from her, about a hundred yards away. She waiting, patiently, allowing the tractor to get out of sight, and out of earshot. She reckoned that if she could hear it, then it was still too close.

She was just about to step out onto the road when she heard another sound. More falling back than stepping back, Terri hid in the bushes just in time to see a car drive past her spot.&nbsp; This was not going to be as easy as Terri had hoped, and for the first time since she started this, she now had doubts about getting back to her care safely.

The road was now totally silent, but she was reluctant to move. The last car, she had not heard it until it was almost on top of her, and had she not fallen, she may well have been spotted.

After about half an hour, Terri took courage in her hands, and stood up, peering again through the bushes to make sure there was no-one around. There was silence, and it was now or never. Deciding that &#8216;walking&#8217; across the road could leave her standing in the middle if another car appeared, she began bunny hopping, hoping above all else that she didn&#8217;t lose her footing and fall over. 

Terri&#8217;s luck held this time, and she crossed the road without falling, and without seeing anyone, falling without a care into the bushes at the other side of the road. She caught her knee on a rock, and a trickle of blood escaped, but this was, to her mind, less painful than it would be had she been caught.

Her car was now only just over an hour away if she could keep going, but the light was starting to fade slowly, and though she knew where she was in daylight, she also knew that everything looked different at night, and also realised that darkness would slow her process down. 

She wished she had perhaps given herself more room on the hobble, but it was too late to worry about that now, and besides, the worst was over now, and all she had to do was stay out of sight, and she would be home and dry.

The light seemed to fade faster in the country than it ever did in the city, and Terri soon realised that her progress had slowed dramatically. She could no longer see the stones on her path, and had started to fall over more frequently. Her legs were cut in many places, and her hands were in agony from the times she had fallen on the cuffs.

At one stage, she had to think carefully about which way she should be going, not only because she could not see clearly, but also, she was sure it was taking far too long to reach her car. Her relief when she finally saw her car exactly where she had parked it, was audible. Just a few more minutes, and it would be over.

Hopping, falling over and regaining her feet, Terri reached the car and moved to the rear wheel where she had left the keys. Her hands scrambled around, but there was something wrong. The keys were not there. Moving to the other rear wheel Terri started to panic. The keys were not there either.

�Looking for these?� came a man&#8217;s voice from somewhere in the darkness.

Terri froze. 

�I have been watching you for ages� the man said.� I spotted you earlier when I was out with the dogs, and I followed to see where you were going. When I realised what direction you were heading in, I decided to get ahead of you�

Terri heard footsteps coming closer, but without light, she could not make out the man&#8217;s features.

�Now then, I wonder what it is worth to get your keys back? Well?�

There was a flippancy in the man&#8217;s voice. �Well. I guess you don&#8217;t want to speak to me, eh? Ah yes, that thing in your mouth would stop you, wouldn&#8217;t it? But you&#8217;re okay, I don&#8217;t want your mouth. What I want is already available I guess.�

By now the man was standing over Terri as she lay panic stricken on the ground. She tried to scream out, but the gag she had chosen was effective, especially coupled with the fact her jaw ached.

The man bent down over her and placed one hand over her right breast, and squeezed. Terri flinched as the pain rushed through her. his other hand moved to the other breast, and again he squeezed, laughing as Terri moaned.

She felt him kneel down beside her, and than as his hands moved away from her breasts, she heard the unmistakable sound of a zipper opening. 

�No, please no�, Terri screamed into the gag, but whether the man recognised her words and ignored her, she would never know. 

Lifting her bound legs the man moved closer to her. a simple matter of pressing on her knees from the back and her legs were fully bent and resting on her chest. Terri knew immediately that this would make her vunerable, but struggling was useless, he was stronger than she, and he had not been tied up for all those hours.

Terri could feel the heat of the man&#8217;s body as he moved closer to his target, and screamed again when she felt something hard pressing against her pussy. 

Ignoring her garbled screams, the man guided his manhood and began to press, the tip sliding in easily. With not word, he thrust his hips forward, and buried himself deep inside her pussy. Withdrawing until he was almost out of her, he poised, and then rammed himself as far into her body as he could. 

Terri was now no longer a female to him, she was simply a piece of meat he could use for his own pleasure, as he continued to ram hard and deep inside her, his breathing coming faster, his speed increasing.

Even before the man finished, Terri knew that he was not going to pull out, and moments later, with a loud gasp and groan, the man buried himself to the hilt inside her, and ejaculated.

Tears filled Terri&#8217;s eyes, and rolled down her cheeks as the man slowly pulled his manhood out of her, letting her legs fall to the ground.

� Your keys are here� said the man, dropping them at her side. � Next time you want to feel me, I will be here.�

Terri cried uncontrollably as she heard the man&#8217;s footsteps walking away, leaving her feeling dirty and used.

Finding the keys, Terri crawled to her car, forced herself to her feet and unlocked the door, collapsing onto the seat. It took her several minutes to find the keys and unlock her cuffs, her body still racked with sobbing. Not bothering to dress, Terri started the car and drove away, tears still in her eyes, and the feel of the man&#8217;s juices leaking out of her, and down her inner thighs.
