* Background of this universe

In an alternate timeline, a feminist was elected as the President of the United States in 1920, bringing change that slowly crept over the world. By the 40s women were the ruling class in most of the world; only those areas of the Middle East and Africa where women had little to no rights to begin with, were men still in control. These were also the only areas where male violence of any form still occurred on a regular basis. In the year 1953 the United Earth Government was founded and the global election was held for the World Presidency and Senate with only the male controlled regions not being a part of the government. In 1958 the Female dominated Senate passed the Male Decitizenship and Ownership Bill.

All males became the property of their wives or registered girlfriend. Single males became wards of the state, until they were assigned to a single woman. Normally women were allowed only one male. Women were only allowed to breed while she was between the ages of 18 and 36, and only with her own male. Women were allowed sex with any other consenting woman and a male whose Owner consented to his use, but protection from breeding and disease had to be used in these encounters. Lesbians had a choice of owning a male for breeding, or owning a female stripped of citizenship for pleasure. Eventually allotments were made for Lesbians who owned females and Females who had infertile males to get a license to 'borrow' males for breeding. The Lesbians though had the option of the male inseminating her female property rather then herself.

It was decided male children would be the property of their Mother who, had rights to make arrangements for the boyís ownership to a Female in the first half of the breeding age range. Ownership was transferred on the male's between their 18th and 19th birthday. Any male who did not have a signed Ownership Agreement on their 19th birthday were taken into custody by the local Male Control Board and issued to a Female who did not own a male from the waiting list.

The judicial system was overhauled also. The Female Court was very similar to the old US Justice system, lawyers, judge and jury of their peers. The male Court system was strictly a bench trial arrangement with no jury of peers. When the judgment was passed the sentencing was decided upon by an anonymous in-court Review Board assigned by the local Male Control Board's Judicial Oversight department. These women attend the trial and would have access to all testimony and evidence.

males were property but were to still be treated humanely, any Females found to have abused their males (over and above what was required for discipline) or other female's property were also sent to male Court. If found in contempt of the Humane Laws of Male Control, the Female could be sent to prison or be stripped of her citizenship, assigned as property of a Lesbian or as a breeder for older Females who failed to conceive during the breeding age.

Of course there were male resistance groups, who avoided capture and caused trouble, and also occasional escaped males but in the years that came, their quantities had dwindled to a low number.

Now in 2014 most of the males accept this life, as they had grown up with the Female dominated governments, and those that were born into this culture just accepted it as it was taught to them with their basic elementary reading and arithmetic.

This brings us to our tale of a Female whose beloved male was confiscated and charged with Owner Rape. One of the most viscous crimes a male can commit. A crime both the Female and her property vehemently deny.

*The Judgment

"We have nothing to worry about Justine, with your testimony that you ordered this action&nbsp; from your male, Judge Alfons has no choice but to dismiss the charges. michael will be going home with you today."

The beautiful redhead looked at me, "I hope so Adrianne, but her attitude towards myself and michael disturbs me. I would still like to know how they got that recording and who made the allegation. The Prosecution's claim that I am a victim and suffer from Shanghai Syndrome really upsets me too." 

"Yes me too, but Prosecutor Herring is just trying to discredit your testimony. I think the Judge could see through that. All the testimony by your fellows should be enough to convince her it is not true. Judge Alfons may be a male hater, which in my opinion means she should not preside over male Court, but she has to see the adoration for you in michael. Christ he literally radiated love when you were on the stand." A beep from the my Notepad interrupted the conversation. I read the message that appeared on the screen. "Good she has her judgment already, that's good for us, let's go in there and get your boy back."

Justine sat behind the clear wall where she could see and hear everything. While I and her michael stood at the defense table on the other side of the wall, michael's limbs were restrained as they had been whenever he was in court over the last week.

The brawny bailiff said at the top of her voice "michael Delanoe Solomon, Property of Justine Solomon, prepare for judgment."

I put a reassuring hand on michael's shoulder "He is prepared."

Judge Melissa Alfons entered the room and took her seat. The smile on the old hag's face sent a chill through my spine. I could see the same happen to michael next to me as he dared to look up, I had lost my confident air at that moment.

"michael Delanoe Solomon, Property of Justine Solomon, by the power invested in me by the Male Control Board of the city of New York, I find you Guilty of the crime of Owner Rape and pass you to the Review Board for sentencing."

The room was silent for a moment. The Females who knew Justine and michael and had been in attendance were in shock. michael fell to his knees weeping. On the other side of the wall the noise of anger and disbelief erupted from her friends, family, and coworkers, Justine had started beating on the two inch thick clear plastic between us in anger.

"Silence in my court!!"

The crowd quieted enough for me to announce plans to appeal the decision.

"That is your Female Client's right counselor, but for now his fate is in the board's hands and I recommend they issue immediate re-education and reassignment. Review Board will now deliberate." I knew Justine's heart must have stopped with the judge's recommendation.

At that pronouncement the panel of five hooded women who had been sitting silently in review of the proceedings walked through a door next to their seats.

I already had told Justine early on this could take minutes or days for them to come to a majority, if it went to the Review Board, an event I had been confidant wouldn't occur.

*The Sentencing

The light went green over the door within ten minutes. One by one the Review Board returned to their seats from the door. The last stayed standing at her seat. Her voice was amplified through the room. "It is the decision of this board that the property michael be returned to his Owner, Justine Solomon, within three days, he is under house arrest and his male genital device will remain in place and locked by the MCB until the Owner's appeal is decided." Judge Alfons showed intense anger at the council which grew with their next announcement. "Also this board is using its discretion to order an Oversight Committee Review of this Proceeding and Judge Alfons's fitness for the bench."

"You can't do that!" screamed the Judge.

The Forewoman of the Board stared daggers at the judge through the opaque hood that hid her identity. "Section 17.5a of the Judicial Code for male Punishment says a Review Board who unanimously agrees the ruling of the judge is wrong can make a declaration for a review of the proceeding. Furthermore Section 65.5b states that if a majority of the review board feel as if the Judge is allowing her personal feelings outweigh the testimony the Board MUST call for a fitness review by the MCB. We are not only in our rights, but it is our obligation to do as such in the interest of humane treatment of males." The remaining four women nod their head in agreement. "We feel, with the testimony offered by prosecution and defense witnesses, your verdict is unjustified. There is no proof of Shanghai Syndrome as offered by prosecution, and you did not order the supposed Owner-victim for a MCB psychological review to confirm or deny this, as is required by law. Also your suggestive punishment is both unprofessional and oversteps your authority as a male Court judge."

"You are a bunch of bleeding heart liberalettes. You are dismissed! I will have each of your hoods!"

The board filed out of the room and the judge ordered the prisoner returned to holding and the room cleared. The bailiff picked michael off the floor as if he was a doll. He was in such shock he offered no resistance.

*The Aftermath

Outside the court Justine was being consoled by her Mother and best friends. Crying she said "How am I going to get pregnant if michael is locked in one of those things? Mom I love him, and he loves me, you know it!" 

I approached her. "Don't worry Justine, I have already been approached by a rep of the city MCB and got a message from a state rep also. Evidently the Review Board contacted them while in deliberations and they are fast tracking the Oversight Committee review of this case. But now it is even more personal to me. Someone obviously has sights on you and/or michael for some reason, and the Judge is in their pocket. I suspected that about the investigation force to have even let it get to court, but I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt, until now."

Allison, Justine's Mother, spoke up "Who would do that to her, she does not have any powerful enemies or rivals."

"I wish I knew, but I promise..." I took Justineís hand in my own to give her strength, "...we will find out together. In the meantime I will also file for a Breeding Exception to arrange supervised conjugal sessions. We will need to file an affidavit that you only wish to breed with michael. If approved quickly, that will give you a chance to become pregnant by him while the other processes are ongoing."

---

The evening news ran the story of the trial verdict, and the Review Board's statements. After all Owner Rape is a very rare and serious crime in today's culture, there was less then 50 in the whole UEG last year. The commentaries all lambasted Judge Alphons's decision and decried that such heartfelt testimony by the supposed victim and her friends and family did not support the Judge's decision in the least.

Meanwhile, with these running on the various screens in my office,&nbsp; I, Adrianne Harking, and my small staff were calling in every favor they had with the City Police, New York State Records Database, and the Male Control Board to get as much information on the tip to the Investigation Force, Judge Alphons and even Prosecutor Char Herring, to see if we could connect the dots of what I was seeing as a conspiracy against my client Justine or Justine's property, michael.

Two days later we caught a break, the number that called in the anonymous tip cross-referenced to a phone belonging to one of the residents in a neighboring apartment to Justine's. Furthermore this number called in tips about males from several neighboring apartments having committed crimes, but the other's were minor and considered unfounded.

I was on my way to oversee the installation of the home arrest system and Justine's training in its use. I was just a half block from the building when my Notepad announced a new message. It was from my genealogy researcher, she discovered a link between the Owner of the phone making the tips and Judge Alphons. Alphons was the great-aunt of the Owner of the apartment the tips came from. Further research found that this woman's male had died this past December as he returned from running to get supplies for last year's Winter Holiday Party (formerly known as Christmas in the male dominated society), he was struck by an automobile as he crossed the street.

Now I have something to work with at least, the chances of this being a coincidence is extremely tiny.

*The Preparations

When Adrianne arrived at my apartment the installers where already at work.

"Now Justine, there are some rules you and michael will be required to follow in compliance with the MCB's House Arrest procedures. First michael will only be able to leave the Apartment with you or a MCB certified officer. He must be restrained in the arm cuffs and hobble shackles whenever he is alone or leaving the apartment. Attempting to leave the apartment without them will result in an incapacitating shock to his groin from genital device, which is now retrofitted with the house arrest reciever. The genital device for the time being cannot be removed by your thumbprint as usual, or any other Female previously authorized by you for that matter. The MCB has locked out the genital device's control from anyone except medical and prison personnel. This is for 'your safety' until I can straighten out this mess."

"But you know michael didn't rape me."

"Yes, I know, but these are the standard procedure in all male house arrests. Tomorrow when we pick michael up, you will be issued a control bracelet that you can use to activate the emergency punishment features of his genital device if you feel threatened by him. Any civilaian Female in custody of the prisoner male must be given this bracelet for their protection from the prisoner."

"Now I will be his jailer. This just is not fair, he has done nothing wrong."

"Would you prefer he be jailed by your loving hands, or by the Female guards and their male enforcers at Rikers Island?"

"Me, but this is still wrong. I've known michael since we were children. By the time we were teenagers, we both knew I would do anything to be his Owner, and he wanted it so badly. Do you know, his Mother practically gave him to me, even though there were Females offering far more then I could afford for him. It just feels I am betraying her trust and his faith in me."

"I know dear, it can be so hard when you truly love the male and think of them as more then property. I am sure he understands as would his Mother if she were still alive. Now I need to continue." Adrianne took a deep breath to get her thoughts back on track. ìThe genital device's GPS will be active at all times, not just on command. He is not allowed to associate with other males, and no males are allowed to be in your home with him here, unless they are professional service providers working as assistants to their Female. The sensors are linked to your building's alarm system, in case of fire the sensors will shut down and open the door and window access to the fire escape for him."

One of the installation techs came over at this point. "Ma'am, Attorney Harking. The security sensors are all installed on the door and windows and operational, if you both will sign this form we will be on our way."

"Yes of course" Adrianne took the Female's Notepad and signed in her indicated spot, and instructed me to do so also.

As the door closed behind the installation techs and their male assistants, Adrianne motioned me to the couch, "We need to talk, I found out who caused this and have a link from them back to Judge Alphons, but it is a weak link at best."

"Who did this to me? I will make her pay!"

Adrianne pulled out her Notepad. Pulling up a photo on the pad, she shows it to me. "Do you recognize this woman?"

"That's poor Liz Hodlar next door; her male ryan was killed by a car the week before Winter Holiday. Wait she did this!" My rage welled up.

Adrianne barely beat me to the door. "Don't! If you end up in jail for assault, who will be here for michael?" 

I started to cry and struggle in the lawyer's arms, "But she is the cause of this, I need to rip her arms off or something."

"I know, but I am advising on the 'or something'. I have the start of a plan. If we want to absolutely ensure that michael's conviction is overturned we will need her to admit her involvement, her ties to Judge Alphons, and their collusion. It would also be good to know her motive and ultimate goal. You and michael were not her only complaint. According to records she filed tips against most of the males on this floor."

With the cold fire of revenge in my heart I just had one question: "What do you need me to do?"

*The Release

I stepped out of the elevator into our building's private underground parking area to see Adrianne standing next to a compact van with blackened windows.

"I figured this will give us a little privacy from the news hounds."

I gave Adrianne a hug. "Thank you, for everything."

She returned the hug, "This is not over yet, and I will fight for you as long as it takes." She pulled back from me and looked me in the eyes. "I know I said this once already; let's go get your boy."

The driver guided our van through the crowd and down to the regional court building, where another gaggle of reporters were waiting and bypassed as we went to the correct gate.

When we got to the prisoner transfer facility I was given a packet of papers to sign before they could release him into my custody.

Finally I am going to have michael back!&nbsp; I passed the paperwork back to the clerk and received his clothes to dress him in and my damned control bracelet.

Two guards were escorting michael out in his restraints, I immediately noticed he was limping and badly bruised on his torso and legs. When michael saw me he broke loose of the surprised guards' hands and ran as fast as his hobble allowed, dropping to his knees and buried his face in my stomach leaning into me for all he was worth.

"What the hell happened to him?" Adrianne hollered. "He did not look like this two days ago!"

"This is the way we found him this morning Attorney Harking." The startled Female explained. "We had a hard time locating him. He was not in the cell indicated in our paperwork, you know, in the Pending Transfer area. When we asked the guards where he was, they informed us that they had received orders for him to be transferred to maximum security the night before. We went there to retrieve him to find out he was in the infirmary. Evidently there was an incident that his two cell mates' genital devices were tampered with and they got out of them. And violent males, without their chastity devices, well..."

"Are you saying they raped him?" I asked in shock. michael still had not pulled away from my shirt, which was now moist with his tears. "michael why didn't you fight them off?"

He looked up at me a mixture of sadness and fear, "Ma'am, I did not want to give the MCB a reason to keep me from you. I was afraid if I defended myself they would not let me come home to you Milady, and they were both very big males. Even if I was not cuffed I doubt I could have defended myself long."

I stooped to his height and pulled his restrained body into a one way hug. "Oh my poor little boy. When we get home I will take care of you."

Adrianne looked back from the us to the Female guard. "Call Rickers, I want a copy of all the paperwork about last night's transfer, along with the incident and medical reports hardcopied to my office and emailed to my Notepad immediately. If the reports are not done yet, have them done because they will be getting a call from the MCB about this before the morning is out." She turned to Justine. Let's get him dressed and get out of here. This place has made me sick!"

The guards dressed michael and the two of us Females and my male headed back to the parking garage just in time to see the compact van the we arrived in leave, flashes from the cameras evident in its shiny finish.

"Wasn't that our van?"

"Yes it was." Adrianne smiled and turned to another aisle, "But we will be taking this one to your home in about ten minutes, while they lead them to the far side of town. Hopefully the reporters at the apartment building will hear we went the other direction and try to give chase."

Indeed when we got to the garage gate of the apartment building only a handful of reporters remained. On the drive over michael was informed of his part of the plan to clear his name.

*Finally Home

Miss Justine with me in tow exited the elevator&nbsp; to a small "welcome back" celebration of confetti and noise makers like those used on New Years, from our neighbors on the floor, both Female and male alike. My owner graciously thanked them all for their support and reminded them that our fight was not over yet. She looked around the small crowd for somone in the crowd, but I could tell she had not seen Liz Hodlar. She opened our apartment door and escorted me in, locking the door behind us.

I looked around the room with tears in my eyes. "I am home." I whispered to himself. "Milady our home needs to be cleaned, please release me so I can get started."

She kissed me on the cheek "michael, you are such a good boy. I have something I need you to do first." She pressed the release on my wrist restraints and hobble and placed them on the door-side table.

"Anything you want Miss Justine, just ask and I will do it."

"Strip" I gave her a confused look, but as years of training and natural instinct had taught me, I complied instantly. "Come to bed and hold me." She took my hand and led me to the bedroom.

-----

As we lay in bed I found herself relishing being in his arms, I had missed his loving embrace in the last two months. I also missed his sexual skills. Because of the lockout on the genital device I could not enjoy those skills to their fullest yet. I thought to herself, 'Soon I will have him orally please me again. Then I will be relieved of some of my frustrations and only after that will I put Adrianne's plan into motion.'

Later that afternoon I finally conceded to allow michael to start cleaning the apartment. I wanted him holding me again but he could not stand seeing his Owner's home in such a state. So I watched him work, he was trying to ignore his own pain and focus on his work, but only partially succeeding. "How could anyone think such a gentle creature was capable of rape?" I said to myself.

He immediately stopped in his tracks and turned to me. "What Milady?"

Still got his excellent hearing, "Nothing dear, just thinking out loud. Bring me the phone, and take a break. Lay here with your head in my lap."

He complied and settled in as instructed. After a wince of pain as he hit one of his sore spots, a look of serenity crossed michael's face as he stared up into the underside of my breasts. I knew by his expression that he wished I was not wearing the tank-top so he could suckle on them. 

-----

I let his mind drift back to seven years ago, a day that is burned into my mind as the day I came to know the one great truth of my life.

It was a beautiful spring day. Miss Justine, myself, and our schoolmates from the neighborhood were on our way home. Miss Justine took my hand and led me to the little park on the block. This was not an unusual occurrence since Miss Justine was my usual male-sitter until my Mother and father got off of work. We sat under a tree and were doing our homework assignments. I had been struggling with some algebra problem. Miss Justine slid over and looked at my paper (we males were not allowed to use the new electronic Notepad technology yet) "Oh I remember this from middle school, do you want my help?"&nbsp; 

"Please Miss Justine, but just help me understand the technique, Momma would be mad if I let a young Lady do my work for me."

"Of course michael, I would not want you to get punished. I like you too much for that." She coached me through the problem and with her help I got the answer. As a reward she kissed my cheek. She supervised the next few problems and rewarded each correct answer with another kiss.

When all our assignments had been done we still had some time before my Mother got home. She sat against the tree and motioned me to come closer. She put her arm around me and pulled me into her shoulder, where I got comfortable with my head just resting against her soft chest mound, what was the polite term... breast, that was it. I could feel that odd feeling between my legs as usual when I would be near her. The first few times this feeling came, I told my Mother that I thought I may be outgrowing this genital device already because it kept getting tight. She would pull out her key and check to confirm everything was fine. With a laugh she said that it was just his male instincts making the device tight. (I still do not understand this, but guessed I would when I had anatomy in my senior year). 

Miss Justine tenderly stroked my head. And we then said the sentences that changed us both forever: 

"Miss Justine, I think... I think I love you, when we are old enough I want to be your property."

"I want that too michael, I promise you I will have you and love you forever."

A firm hand pressed to my cheek brought me back to the present. "What are you thinking about michael? It obviously is a very pleasant thought."

With a big smile I said; "More a memory Milady, of April 12th, 2007."

She returned my smile.

-----

It was a happy memory for both of us; I was on cloud nine when I returned home that night, after making sure michael was home safe. The male I had lusted over for years had professed his love for me. I was determined to spend as much time as possible with Miss Delanoe and michael. I knew Miss Delanoe, like my own Mother, was one of the old school Females. She truly loved her male and her son. Not like many of the extremists who got upset and only took care of a male offspring because the law required it, michael's Mother nurtured him and taught him the proper ways to treat a Female, with affection and reverence. If I could show Miss Delanoe that I cherished michael as much as she herself did, I was sure my dowry offering for him would be well considered no matter how small it was in comparison to the richer Females who, if they were lucky, met him occasionally at school or at the now popular social teen dances. Of course then there would also be the many overseas dowry offers that came from Females who have never met the male, and with political funding were attempting to buy him just to diversify their regions genetic material.

Fortunately for us both, my read of Juliet Delanoe was spot on. On the day after I took ownership of michael, Miss Delanoe showed me the other dowry bids, one of which was from the Mayor's own Daughter, a sum that was three times what I had been able to offer, which itself was still lower then a few of the others. "I know you two are in love, as unconventional as that is in this day and age, that is more important to me then the money."

I owed it to Juliet to ensure michael was still well cared for and loved. I needed to stop procrastinating. I warned michael to be silent and dialed the phone.

"Hello?"

"Hi Liz, its Justine from next door. Can I ask you a BIG favor?"

"Sure go ahead?"

"Are you working tomorrow? I need to go to the lawyer's office for a few hours and I would prefer not to have to drag michael across town trying to avoid the media with him in leg hobbles only able to take small steps, and he has too much work to do to spend the day restrained at home."

"Yes I'm off, but why me?"

"Well you do not have a male, and since michael is not allowed to be with any other males while under house arrest. It leaves me with you, or a paid male-sitter service. And I figured michael at least knows you, and could trust you. Some of the things that have occurred since his arrest has made him fear and distrust strange Females."

"Can I think about it a little, I promise I will give you an answer early enough for you to make other arrangements if need be."

"Okay Liz, thanks. And if it gives you a better piece of mind, I will need to give you the bracelet that has the punishment controls for his genital device. So you have some recourse if he gets a little mannish with you."

"Talk to you soon Justine."

"Thanks again for even considering it Liz. Bye!"

I looked down and saw that the adoration in michael's eyes was now replaced by fear. "I am not so sure of this Milady. What if I cannot do this? I may make things worse. And I will be alone and vulnerable in the hands of the Female who got me sent to prison."

"Do you trust Miss Adrianne, do you trust me?"

michael shuffled so his head was closer to my stomach. "Yes ma'am, I trust you both very much."

"And we both trust that you can do your part, boy. We believe in you, you are a very smart male, believe in yourself."

"Yes Milady." He punctuated his response by kissing my abs, which had become exposed by his head movements.

The phone announced the incoming call. I gave it enough rings to make it appear as if I was not anxiously waiting for the call.

"Hello."

"Justine, its Liz. I'll do it, you just need to come over and teach me how to use that bracelet device."

"Oh good! Thank you sooo much Liz. Will 8:30 be good for me to come over?

"Perfect I'll have some hot tea ready, I'll see you then. Bye Justine."

"See you in the morning Liz." 

I set the phone on the table and stroked the side of michael's head. He still looked very tense. I would need to relieve some of this tension before morning. Since the best form of tension release for him is off limits at the time, I decided I would give him a nice long massage. "michael go draw a bath for us, use the bath oils. I will be along in a few minutes."

He sat up and kissed me on the cheek. "Yes Milady right away."

I picked up the phone and dialed a new number. "Adrianne, we are on for tomorrow morning."

*The Trap is Set

michael woke me at 6AM in a more subdued manner then usual. Normally he would crawl on top of me and make passionate love to me. This is what got him in trouble in the first place. The Investigators had got a recording of our morning wakeup ritual. Their claim was that since I was not awake when the intercourse started, it was rape. The fact that I instructed him this was how I wanted to be woke every morning and it had been part of our daily lives for two years did not matter to them. Since his arrest I had not enjoyed the mornings. Today his tongue did the job his penis would normally do, and while it was not my traditionally preferred method, it was a close second.

After I had recovered, I propped myself up on my side and looked at michael, kneeling on the bed between my feet. He was licking my cum from his lips. "You want more of that, don't you?"

He hung his head as if he was ashamed of admitting it "Always Milady, I know the male is not supposed to enjoy sex. But the thrill of making you happy in this way, makes me hunger for more."

"Soon I will have you out of this genital device, and I want your male juices in me very much. Would you like that?"

"You know I do Miss Justine, I want desperately to provide you Daughters!"

"Or sons?" I asked with a raised eyebrow.

"Or sons Milady. I am sorry; I know you just want children, that you care not if it will be a female or male. But part of me hopes our children will be Females. I want to be a male proud to say his child is going to be a leader of society."

I ran my hands over his crotch, over the damned genital device. A necessary evil these devices. The more mannish males they help to keep in line, it protects the more submissive males from being used by any Female who can get their claws into the males. And used as a control device for the violent males. Back in our childhood they were just called male chastity devices, and were opened by traditional keys held by the Owner or Mother of the male. Simple garments that where made of varying materials in many designs. Today's varieties are all the same standard design, nearly indestructible plastic bikini briefs with a biometric lock. They had built in GPS locators that could be activated by the MCB or the Owner at anytime; supplementary hardware could be added for punishment devices, or for Female sexual gratification (i.e. an attachable penis). The biometric lock was keyed to the specific Owner, and other Females she authorized. Professional Females (Police and Medical Doctor's mostly) had override functions that activated when they were on duty. michael's belt device would normally open for my Mother, as well as my sister, and best friend. But right now, no one could access it.

This sad thought reminded me of the ultimate mission for the day. "Get dressed michael, we have some work to do."

I knocked on the door to the next apartment. It was answered by the owner of the apartment Elizabeth 'Liz' Hodlar. She was a Nurse Practitioner, while a little on the bulkier side, she still possessed a nice womanly figure. Sadly she was on the tail end of the breeding age, and had yet to conceive when her male ryan had died. Childless, and an only child, her bloodline would likely die out if she did not conceive in the next three years. This pushed her up the waiting list to receive an unclaimed or 'widowed' male. But from what she was told she could still be a year or more until she got a male.

"Come in Justine. The water is almost ready for tea."

"Thank you Liz, for the tea and the assistance today."

Liz pulled cups from the cabinet and prepared the tea. "No problem Justine. I'm sorry I made you wait for an answer, but I had to make sure this was an allowable procedure for house arrest. I didn't want to find out I wasn't allowed to do this and jeopardize my chances of getting another male myself."

"Oh! That's fine. I just thought maybe you were unsure if you would be safe around michael."

"ryan thought he was a good enough male. I trusted his opinion, even if he was just a male."

"Yes they did seem to appreciate each other's company. Not many males have learned chess anymore. michael misses their matches. He says the 'pad is just not a intuitive enough player, too predictable."

"I wonder which of them came up with that line, ryan used the same line." She laughed, but then looked sadly at her teacup.

"I'm sorry Liz, is this bringing up bad feelings?"

"Yes but it is okay, I have to put it in the past. 'Remember the past fondly and look to the future.' was what my Mother said when my father died. Of course she didn't seem anywhere near as attached to him as I was to ryan."

I looked at my watch. "Well I better show you this before I have to leave." I handed Liz the bracelet. "Put it on your wrist, the yellow button activates a mild shock in his genital device, a warning level. The red is the big kicker. It is strong enough to drop him. But don't press them now."

Liz pulled her fingers back "It's active?"

"Yes. 24/7. If you have to leave the apartment before I get back you will have to put his restraints on him. He's not to leave without me so don't take him anywhere."

"Okay, got it."

"Well I better get going he's waiting next door to start cleaning. As soon as you release his restraints he will get to work."

At that Liz takes the cups to the sink and we walk back to my apartment. I opened the door and let Liz in. "You be good for Miss Elizabeth, understand boy?"

"Yes Milady, I will be on my best behavior." I blew him a kiss and closed the door behind me.

-----

"Aww! That's cute you have 'pet names' for each other. Will you call me 'Milady' when I own you?"

"I do not understand Miss Elizabeth, Miss Justine will not sell me."

"No, but after you attack me and beat me, you will be offered to me after your mandatory re-education process."

"I would not do that Ma'am. Will you please release me so I can begin my chores; I have two months of cleaning to catch up on."

"Will you beat me if I release you?"

"No Ma'am, I just want to clean my Owner's home."

"Then I can't release you yet." Suddenly Miss Elizabeth threw herself into the doorjamb to the kitchen, raising a bruise on her exposed shoulder. She followed that by tearing at the collar on the opposite side of her shirt.

"Miss Elizabeth what are you doing? Are you alright?"

"NO I AM NOT ALRIGHT YOU BASTARD!" She screamed. "You and the other males on this floor took my ryan from me!"

"What are you talking about Ma'am? He was hit by a car!"

"None of you could go to the store so he had to, and now he's dead!"

"None of us could go because none of our Owners were home to allow us to leave; you were the only Female home that day."

Miss Elizabeth climbed up on a chair and leapt backwards into the dinner table, collapsing it. She pulls herself up and stares at me. "So I lose my male, and your Owner keeps hers! How is that fair?" She presses the red punishment button and I am hit with excruciating pain in my crotch. I fall off the couch to the floor in agony.

When I regained my senses I looked at her, "Why me, ryan and I were friends?"

"Oh you are such a man, it is all about you! Well I hope it breaks your little mannish ego to find out you are only my most recent attempt to get one of you lazy males from this floor. You just happened to be the one who actually managed to get as far as being convicted in court. My Aunt Missy was going to make sure when you were reassigned my name would be at the top of the list! But that damned Review Board, those Bitches!" She pressed the button again, causing me to spasm uncontrollably.

"Aunt Missy? How could your Aunt help you?"

"You know her as Judge Alphons." Miss Elizabeth ripped her own pants down and yanked her panties to her knees. "And according to her if a male under house arrest attacks a Female he is automatically sent for re-education, and his victim has the option to claim him as her own property afterwards. Oh that and his previous Owner gets put on trial for allowing the attack!

She hits her face on the doorjamb once again raising a bruise. "A little known fact about these issued punishment devices, if they are pressed three times in an hour the police respond to the address." She drags my restrained body to the door area and presses the button for a long time. She quickly removes my restraints, opens the door part way, and begins moving across the room arranging herself against the collapsed table.

"Now the Owner rapist has another victim, me!"

"But I did not touch you." I moaned.

"According to the story I am going to tell; you did. Who do you think they will believe, a battered victim, or an already convicted male?"

I waited a few minutes until I heard the heavy boots of the police coming down the hall before got on my hands and knees. I gave her a weak smile and said; "The recording... they will believe the recording."

At that two officers came through the door. The first scooped me up by the arm in her tight grip.

Miss Elizabeth opened her eyes and made a feeble attempt to stand "He... he attacked me! I tried to fight him... off officer. Even used the bracelet, but... but he kept coming back! When he tried to run away, he colla... collapsed at the door."

The Policefemale offered her a hand up then in one quick motion a pair of restraints snapped on her wrist, brought behind her back, and attached to her other wrist. "Elizabeth Hodlar, you are under arrest for filing false reports, Excessive punishment or torture of a male, attempted ownership interference, and conspiracy to commit ownership interference."

"What are you talking about? I AM THE VICTIM!" Miss Elizabeth turned in shock as she heard her own voice repeating her conversation with me.

"They watched this, live as it was occurring." Said a smiling Miss Adrianne from the door, she held up her Notepad with the video playing on it for Miss Elizabeth to see. 

Miss Justine rushed in crying and took me from the Policefemale and held me tight, as she guided me to the couch she finally was able to speak "I'm so sorry you had to go through this boy, I will make it up to you I promise."

She sat with down and pulled me down so my head was on her knees. I smiled up at her, "No Milady, I did this for us. I am getting the only reward I care about right now; your love."

The police started to escort the irate Liz Hodlar out of the apartment. "This is entrapment, I was illegally recorded!"

Adrianne smiled at her. "This is not your home, you have no expectation of privacy, Miss Solomon agreed to the surveillance equipment, and they did have a warrant to tap your phone lines, and I'm pretty sure that call to 'Aunt Missy' is going to be real interesting to both your Prosecutor and the MCB Oversight Committee."

With the room now clear Adrianne knelt next to the couch and kissed me on the forehead. "You did wonderful michael; you gave her enough ignorance that she could not help herself from gloating to you. I told you that you could do it."

"Indeed, you were perfect boy."

I could feel myself blushing at my owner's pride in me. "Thank you, Milady. Miss Adrianne, I do not know how to thank you for all you have done for Milady and I."

"Miss Justine and I have come to terms with some options of special compensation."
&nbsp; 
*Epilogue ~ Two months later

"So today with the guilty plea agreement of former Judge Melissa Alphons, the saga of Justine Solomon and michael has come to a close."

"michael turn up the television! I want to hear this."

michael silently complies as the Anchorfemale continued. "We now go to our legal correspondent Eleanor Malkovits"

"Thank you Lisa. Six weeks ago the highly publicized conviction of the property of Justine Solomon known as michael was overturned by the MCB, because of new evidence. This same evidence was used later that month to convict Elizabeth Hodlar of multiple crimes including Attempted Ownership Interference, and Abuse of a male."

"Has the sentence been passed in this case yet Eleanor?"

"Yes, after considerable debate at multiple levels of the MCB and Female Court system, Liz Hodlar was stripped of her Citizenship, and will be given over as property to her victim, or in this case, her victim's Owner. She is currently in a Re-education Facility, and due to be discharged to her new Owner within the next week."

"And what of today's agreement for Judge Alphons?"

"Well as most our viewers will remember, Judge Alphons issued the controversial conviction of michael that ended her career. Just after the MCB stripped her of her robes she was charged as a conspiritor in the Ownership Interference case of her Great-niece Liz Hodlar, and for arranging in the assault and rape of michael while he was in prison. Rather then risk decitizenship, Melissa Alphons plead guilty. As part of the plea, Alphons will be under house arrest at her Granddaughter's residence. All her physical and financial property, including her Staten Island estate and her home in the Hamptons, will be transferred to her victim, in trust to his Owner."

"Eleanor, does this seem harsh to you?"

"Yes, a little, but the unofficial explanation from the MCB is that they want to send a message to judges worldwide, that abuse of power for their own goals will not be tolerated."

"Thank you Eleanor. In other news; United Earth backed Female rebels in the Muslim Federation have dealt a major blow to their male government today..."

"That's enough news; it is time for bed boy." I said as I turned off the television.

"Miss Justine is what they said true?"

"Yes, pretty much boy." I&nbsp; grabbed his chin and kissed him. "But michael, some things for you to understand; liz has been taught that she is lower then you in my household, you are first and foremost the love of my life. When she arrives she is supposed to follow your instructions as if they were my own. I do not want you abusing this or using her sexually. If she ever does get violent or petulant with you, come to me right away. When we move to the Judge's Estate, our new home, I will be working from home most of the time. Especially after the baby is born. Now go prepare our bath."

"Yes Ma'am." He walked off to the bathroom, I waited for him to respond further. I laughed to myself when I heard something fall to the floor in the bathroom, followed by his heavy footsteps rushing back through their bedroom. michael came to a stop at the door, staring at me a big dumb smile on his face. All deportment forgotten in his surprise "Did you say BABY??"

The last four months may have been the most troubling time of my life, but I could not feel any better about its outcome. Love, Life, and Revenge!










Revenge 2 The Start of a New Tradition

My name is elizabeth, my owner and her superior property known as michael often refer to me simply as 'liz' or lizzie'. Formerly I was the Female known as Elizabeth Hodlar. I had tried doing a terrible thing to the Female that now owns me, Miss Justine Solomon (a beautiful red haired Female several years younger then myself), specifically to have her male property, and childhood love, michael taken from her, with the plans that I would receive him. I almost succeeded in this plan, but I was outsmarted by Miss Justine and her lawyer, who had discovered I was behind the plan.

As punishment the government removed my Female citizenship status and made me a property female. I was then offered to the Female I had victimized. I actually feel fortunate that Miss Justine accepted the offer, the other option the Male Control Board considered was to loan me out as a breeder and be used as a baby machine until I turned 35. I dread to think what would have happened to me when I would have been too old to be used as a breeder. As a Citizen Female I had never found out what happened to breeder females when they reached 36 years of age. Now I can not if I wanted, as my access to television and the internet is extremely limited and must be approved by my owner.

I now live in a home I know well. This fact brings a little sadness to me. This home, which is legally owned in the name of michael in trust to Miss Justine, was my Great-aunt's house. For her part in michael's unjust conviction and her arranging for him to be raped in prison by two violent male inmates (which I had no knowledge of), he was given her real estate and financial holdings. Of course since he is a male, his owner Miss Justine has complete control over it all.

After my Re-education Miss Justine and michael accepted the new me into their family. I work to maintain the house with michael's supervision and help. Mostly michael is preparing the meals for us all (cooking is a passion of his and only allows me to help or cook when he is too busy) and caring for his Daughter Juliet, who was born a few months after we moved to the estate. Miss Justine says she named the baby after michael's mother, because she was a great and loving Female who Miss Justine strives to be like.

The last week has been odd around the estate, Miss Justine and I have been caring for little Juli, and I have not seen michael all week. I have done all the cooking and Miss Justine would disappear with a plate that I assumed was for michael. I asked yesterday if michael was ill. Miss Justine said not exactly and that I would find out today.

Right after Miss Justine's Mother left with Juli I was summoned and instructed to follow her.

Thinking about this I had failed to see where Miss Justine had led me to until she opened the concealed door. Before me was a room I prayed to never see again. It was my Aunt's punishment room! A room many of the Females in my family brought their males for a personal re-education. The last time I was in this room I was 15 and I watched as my Mother had caned my father until he was unconscious. It was a brutality that plaqued my dreams for months, and his crime according to my Mother was that he accidently broke a vase while cleaning our home. I was appalled, but she insisted I stayed and learned the best way to train a male.

I vowed to myself that I would never bring my male to this room or treat him in such a horrible way. And I had never done so. I thought Miss Justine could never be so cruel either. Was I to be punished here? What had I done? Then I saw one of the sheet covered devices move. Miss Justine walked over and removed the sheet to reveal michael in a set of stocks nude except for his genital device and a blindfold.

"Do you know what today is liz? What is the significance of this date?"

"No Ma'am, I am not even sure of the date."

"Well today is an anniversary of sorts, the day michael was fully cleared of his charges and released back to my loving arms, and I could release him from his genital device for the first time since his arrest. So I decided today will be an annual family holiday for us."

"I still do not understand Ma'am."

"Well from now on for the week before this day, I will have michael locked here in this room. On this day you will join him in this room. As a matter of fact strip and come to this set of stocks."

Miss Justine placed me in a stock that forced me to bend horizontally at the waist and secured my feet apart.

"lizzie, when was the last time you had penetration sex?"

"Well before my arrest Ma'am."

"You know michael and I make love almost everyday, usually twice a day, and I have had you give him oral quite often as a reward for his doing a good job."

"Yes Ma'am."

"Does that make you jealous?"

"Some Miss Justine, I have not had any sex in so long. My body still wants it."

"It has been showing in your attitude to myself and michael." She gave me a smile that made me fear for my life for the first time since I have been her property. "Well that is why I have devised this holiday, as I said every year michael will spend a week in this room with no sexual release." michael groaned at this statement. "As I will also be abstaining from sex, this is to remind him and I what we have, and almost lost because of you." She removed michael's blindfold and kissed him passionately.&nbsp; While she kissed him, she also reached under him and pressed her thumb onto his genital control device. With a click it released into her hand. michael's penis hardened to its full length almost instantly.

"To remind you of your part in this, for the next two hours michael will have full and free access to your body, where he will literally fuck you as you tried to symbolically fuck him a year ago."

"Once I leave this room michael, you can use her in any or all of her holes and with any of the equipment in here in whatever way you choose, except&nbsp; I want no permanent harm to happen to liz."

"I... I... I understand Milady."

Miss Justine reached under me and released my own genital device. I felt so open and exposed.

"Miss Justine, you are telling michael to rape me!"

"No I am telling him to use my property for his own pleasure, if I were you I would sit back and enjoy it, it may be the only time you have vaginal sex for the next whole year." I began crying, "This is for your own good my dear. You have been a little bossy to michael; he is your better and deserves your respect. I am sure michael will not be as cruel to you as your family has been to the males that have occupied this room. According to the tapes I have seen, your own grandfather died in this very room at the hands of your Great-aunt and Grandmother."

Miss Justine unlocked the stocks michael was in. "Now I want you both to be exhausted when I return, take advantage of my gift michael. And lizzie; when I come back if michael tells me you fought him, I will take over and you will think that beating your father took the last time you were here was pleasant."

Aunt Missy must have recorded all the punishment sessions! Miss Justine could only know these things if she has seen the recordings.

Miss Justine went to the door opposite the one we entered from when michael spoke up. "Milady, I... I am not sure I can do this."

"michael you need to learn to stand up to her, we have treated her with kindness and she fails to remember her place. But if it makes you feel any better I will give you some incentives. You will not have sex with me until you do this, and you will spend each night in the paddling machine over there until you do." michael looked up in shock. "I will be recording this and watching occasionally so do not get any ideas about faking going through with it michael. Just remember she was the reason you were in prison and anally raped, she tried to take you from me."

"Yes Ma'am."

The door closed and I looked up at michael. The uncertainty was still there, but so were other emotions, lust and anger mainly.

He went around the room looking at things, picking up one device or another. "It seems Miss Justine expected me to not know what this stuff is; she provided pictures of the devices being used on males with each item."

He strolled over carrying a small bucket in one hand and a paddle in the other. He set them down just out of my eyesight. He rubbed my nipples hardening them before he attached a heavy clip with a weight hanging from it to each of them in turn.

"Please michael, don't! I will beha..." A crack rattled my body from my ass to the stock, the force of the impact causing the clips on my breasts to sway.

"Wow lizzie, I was going to give you a hit with this for each day I was in jail... but after seeing your reaction I think I will just do one for each week, that is eight swats. But first there are enough of these weights that I will place one on you for each time I was raped in that cell my last night. Do you know how many that is?"

I was crying hard but managed to shake my head in the negative.

He knelt in front of me, tears on his face. "Of course not, I have never even told Miss Justine because it would break her heart. Twenty times they took my butt! TWENTY TIMES BECAUSE YOU WANTED REVENGE!!!" The look of anger and hatred scared me, what has Miss Justine done!

michael hung nine more weights on each breast then proceeded to give me seven more shots with the paddle. My ass was on fire and my breasts were sore where the weights were attached. "I am tempted to go back to one swat for each day."

"Please michael I beg you, don't!"

"Tell me lizzie, have you ever had a penis in your butt?"

No! He can't be serious! "michael, please no! I can't do that, it's not the way a Female is supposed to have sex!"

"Neither is a male, but I had it forced upon me! Remember you are not a Female anymore, just property like me. And our owner said I can use any of your 'holes' as I please."

michael walked behind me and I heard him inhale through his nose. "lizzie! Your vagina is very wet. Miss Justine only gets this way when she wants to have sex!"

Oh God he was right, I am so turned on! Why? Why is my pussy so excited? I was so lost in those questions that I was surprised to feel michael's cock push into me. For the first time in over a year, I felt my pussy being filled, and it felt so good.

"Hmm your vagina feels good, but I just wanted to get wet for now." He pulled out of my pussy and rams himself into my asshole. I scream my head off. "You should feel fortunate liz, I am smaller then either of the guys who took me, and they did not lubricate themselves like I did."

Between my sore ass cheeks, asshole, and the swinging weights I was in such pain. I could feel something dripping down my leg. I knew michael was tearing my ass apart and I was bleeding. He paced himself to prolong my agony, but he eventually released his sperm in my ass.

He pulled out of me and walked away. I heard water running behind me. Soon he was standing before me and released me from the stocks. "I am sorry lizzie, I do not know where that much anger came from."

"Are you releasing me?"

"No, not until Miss Justine says so, but I am giving you a chance to refresh. Go ahead and remove those and place them in here." He pointed to the clip-weights while handing me their bucket. I went to the sink and cleaned my ass and legs. I did not find blood around my asshole, what I thought was blood on my leg was really juices from my pussy. What is wrong with me?

"Get over here."

michael was standing next to a strange chair, similar to the kind gynecologists used, but evil looking. I needed no invitation, I climbed up in it. Michael secured my ankles to the stirrups, and my wrists to the base directly below my torso. "Now for the interesting parts." He swung the head restraint up, caging my head and adjusted the gag to fit in my mouth. He disappeared from my line of sight, and then I felt something intruding into my ass again. A mechanical pump sound started and the intruders in my mouth and ass both swelled.

When they stopped he came up on my left. "Try to move your butt liz." I did but could not lift it or shift in any direction. From what I am seeing in these pictures, this was used to restrain the males so the Females could whip and beat the male�s penis and scrotum."

I tried to scream no but my mouth was too full, I wanted to beg for him not to beat my pussy. He must have seen my fear. He tenderly kissed one of my sore tits. "No I will not do that, I am done being cruel, for now. I think my penis is ready for the next hole, your vagina."

I felt michael running his fingers over my pussy. "lizzie, lizzie, lizzie. Are you always this sexually excited or is it these restraints?" 

I wanted to say; 'Could it be I have been deprived any relief for almost a year?' But something he said struck a nerve, I am more excited then I have ever been, and the more I am trapped, the more pronounced my excitement. 

Without a word michael entered me with his cock. Thankfully he didn't just pull it out this time, he was using that pussy. My pussy! It felt wonderful, with the anal device in I had never felt more... full. I had two orgasms and was building to my third when I felt michael's body stiffen between my secured legs as his jism spray inside of me. Inside of me! Oh no what if I got pregnant? I'm no longer allowed to breed. We would be in so much trouble!

After a five minute respite, michael started again. I struggled, but was too secure to do anything! I tried to scream for michael to stop. But he ignored me. We each had another orgasm, As much as I tried not to.

I started crying, as my nose filled up with mucus, it became harder to breath. If I got pregnant, we would surely be punished by the MCB.

michael must have realized I was struggling to breath, I felt the gag deflate and my hands and head restraints released. michael helped me sit up. "Easy liz, take a few breaths. Are you alright?"

I looked at him. "michael why? Are you trying to get us taken from Miss Justine?" He looked dumbly at me. Simplemindedly confused was a better description. "You ejaculated in me! Twice! I am property; I am not allowed to get pregnant without MCB permission!"

He fell to his knees, and without his support I dropped to my back. "No! What have I done? I don't want to be taken from Miss Justine!" He began crying too.

"michael, maybe I will not get pregnant! But we have to tell Miss..."

Just then our owner came bursting into the room and ran right to michael. She pulled him to her shoulder. "It is all right boy; no one is going to take you or liz from me over this."

"But if I got her pregnant?"

"It is okay michael. Now help me release liz and I will explain."

Soon I was sitting up on the punishment chair, Miss Justine had provided both michael and I with towels to clean our faces and clear our noses of mucus.

"Now here is the situation; neither of you will be in trouble for anything that happened in here. And if liz is pregnant it is fully sanctioned. It was requested I allow her to breed while she is still able because there are few left breeding from her father's genetic line as he was the only child of his generation and she is almost too old. And the MCB feels it is important to keep genetic diversity. So when I agreed they issued me a license to breed lizzie with any male. I choose to keep it in the 'family' for now. I enjoyed watching you two and it gave me ideas, we will be using this room often I think. I promise you both it will be mutually enjoyable, mostly. I have no desire to cause either of you excessive pain or injury. The more cruel devices will be removed entirely, and destroyed."

"Miss Justine, please do not ask me to be michael's tormentor, I do not think I can handle it, or deserve to do it. I think I would prefer being only on the receiving end of these machines."

"I am pleased to hear that lizzie, I never planned on letting you have control over michael. Ever. If he is restrained in here, it will be by myself or one of my Female family members or close friends, like Miss Adrianne or Lucy. When or if I decide to reveal this room to them."

"I understand Miss Justine, because I am less then him."

"Good, just remember that, because michael is allowed to bring you down here whenever he feels you have overstepped your place." She turned to michael. "Restraints and predicament implements, like those weights, are all you are allowed to use, no machines, no paddling or whipping her on your own. No gagging if you are leaving the room."

"Yes Milady, but I pray I will not need to do this for anything but your enjoyment." 

She smiled at him and stroked his cheek. "I was shocked by your aggressive punishment of her earlier boy. I did not think you had it in you."

"I did not know it either Milady. It scared me, but you stroked the right embers to awaken the old fires of pain and the pain wanted revenge."

"I'm sorry to you, both of you, for reminding you of this. It was petty of me to encourage michael into this by using his rape. I had not realized how deep that pain still was."

"Miss Justine... uh is my time down here done?"

"Why michael?"

"There is one more restraint I would like to use on liz."

I looked at Miss Justine, and she was looking at me. I was not sure if I wanted to be subjected to another session. When I saw the smile on Miss Justine's face as she looked down, I realized my body did want it, my snatch was glistening with fresh juices.

"Go for it boy."

michael wasted no time; he almost lovingly carried me to the 'throne'. My head was laid inside and he strapped a gag that was made out of two fake penises on me, one penis in my mouth gagging me the other sticking out from my face. He closed the throne around my neck and wrists. My vision was reduced to the hole just smaller then a human head that was above me. I felt my head harness raise me up slightly to the seat so my gag protruded out of the throne. The rest of me protruded out the front along the floor.

I heard Miss Justine's surprised voice; "michael what are you doing?"

"Please trust me Milady; it will be 'mutually enjoyable'."

It was relatively silent then, I could hear some clothes rustling, then Miss Justine giggle. Suddenly my view of the ceiling was replaced by a pair of male arms lowering a Female ass onto my face. He guided the cock sticking from my face into Miss Justine's pussy. It slid in with ease.

I heard michael's voice from the air holes at the back of the throne. "lizzie, you are in here until you can make Miss Justine orgasm five times. But don't worry you will get some satisfaction too, we all will." I had a sudden sharp pain began in my stomach. Oh and if you are not doing a good job, Miss Justine is going to use the uhh..."

"It's a riding crop michael." Miss Justine laughed good-naturedly.

"Okay. She will use the riding crop on you."

I started moving my neck a little in each direction.

michael lifted my hips and slid something under me. Then I felt michael enter my pussy and began to slowly pump back and forth. When michael pushed into me, I was pushed up further into Miss Justine. I felt michael cum in me and go limp, leaning against me for support. 

I heard michael yelp and Miss Justine hiss; "Get those hands back on my tits boy. Just because your cock is out of commission at the moment doesn't mean you stop servicing me!"

"I am... I am sorry Milady." Michael was clearly out of breath.

Miss Justine got her five orgasms, and michael got one more and could not get hard again. I had got about a dozen hits from the crop and two more orgasms, the last caused only by excitement of the situation and the crop rubbing my clit!

After I was released, we were all laying on the bed in the corner of the room. michael was affectionately cleaning our owner's juices from my face with his tongue.

I looked at Miss Justine. "Do we really have to wait a year to do this again Miss Justine?"

"No girl, I think we will be doing this much more frequently. But this will be a tradition for us as I stated earlier."

She smiled at me as I leaned back. Wait! What did Miss Justine call me? When I opened my eyes both Miss Justine and michael were looking at me expectantly. "Miss Justine, did you just call me 'girl'?"

"Yes girl I did." She said with a smile.

"Does that mean...?"

"Yes it does girl."

I started crying, I was finally fully accepted into her family, and I was finally given the privilege to call my owner by her and michael's special greeting. "Thank you..." I had to build up my courage to say it because the last time I said it, she set my genital device to shock my every half hour for a whole day in punishment. "...Milady."

The silence is deafening. I am alone in our big home at the moment. Well I am the only conscious person anyhow, as my infant Daughter Juli is asleep in my owner's office. My name is michael; I am a male belonging to Miss Justine Solomon, my childhood sweetheart and love of my life. We live in a beautiful estate with our beloved Daughter Juliet or simply Juli, and my property-sister liz. Ours is a unique family relationship and history. I prefer to try to forget the events that lead us to this arrangement.

Miss Justine has decided to go on a long weekend to an all-Female resort to celebrate a recent successful business project. Since no males were allowed I could not go, but liz being a property female was allowed to go as an attendant, but she is not allowed to partake in the recreational facilities.

They left this morning in a taxi. So it has just been little Juli and I in the house. Miss Justine insisted liz have the house spotless before they left so I would have very little to worry about. So I played with Juli most of the morning, and challenged my 'Notepad-male' to chess for an hour. Soon Milady�s Mother, Miss Allison will be here to spend the rest of the weekend with us. This way I am not unsupervised for longer then the eighteen hours a day that I am allowed by law.

I stop in the office and check that my darling Juli is still sleeping soundly in her crib when I hear the front door open.

"michael, I am here!" echoes down the front hall.

I rush out the door and signal her to be quiet. "Juli is sleeping Mother Alli." She insists I call her that in the privacy of family, even though the term 'Miss' is the socially accepted term, and expected way for a male to address a Female, she says that is for young Females, not old Motherly Females.

"Come over here child, give me a big hug."

"Of course Mother." 

We embrace and she kisses me deeply. "I have been waiting for this weekend child. Both to spend time with you and my Granddaughter."

Miss Allison (Mother Alli) simply adores me. She has known me since I was a child and always said what a good young male I was becoming and how my Mother did such a good job teaching me proper loving respect for Females. She was so happy when my Mother called to say that she had chosen Miss Justine as my owner over all the other applicants, she threw an Ownership Party for us, something that is usually done only by the wealthy and famous Females.

I of course also adore Mother Alli. She is very much like how my Mother was, believing in a firm, yet loving, control of the male members of the species. Maybe this shared philosophy was why she and my Mother were such close friends. Miss Allison had strong genes; Miss Justine herself is almost the spitting image of her Mother at that age, as is her younger Daughter, Miss Amanda. Of course Mother Alli's red hair is now streaked with grey/white strands and she is a bit heavier now. But she carries these new curves in all the right places. I will be a lucky male if my Owner follows in her Mother's lead when she ages.

Mother Alli is also one of only four Females that Miss Justine has authorized to open my genital device and have the right to demand sex from me whenever they choose. Mother Alli says soon she will be able to ride me 'bareback' as she is close to the age where she will be physically unable to breed (she has been too old to legally breed for more then a few years), I do not know for sure what this means but I have a good idea. Sometimes the Females, especially the older ones who were raised in the transition years of the United Earth Government, have such obscure terminology and use words we males are taught we should never speak because they are vulgarities from a male. 

One thing that is a problem with Mother Alli is she despises liz for her transgressions of the past. Despite Miss Justine's allowing her into our family, Mother Alli does not trust her and is outright mean to liz.

liz, to her credit, has maintained neutral attitude to Miss Allison when in person, but has come to me in private crying about the abuse to expel the anger and stress from her mind. I have mentioned to Milady that one day Mother Alli will push too much and liz will say or do something she will regret. In response Miss Justine has asked me to always try to keep liz very busy when her Mother is with us, in hopes that if she is busy elsewhere, Mother Alli would have less chance and reason to upset liz.

Mother Alli breaks off the hug, and playfully runs a hand across the area where my penis is contained under the genital device. "You be a good male and take my bag upstairs to my room, I will go look in on my Granddaughter."

"Yes Ma'am, of course."

The main house had six bedrooms, the Mistress Suite where Miss Justine and I sleep, one is set up for Mother Alli, the smallest room was converted into a room for liz, and the remaining bedrooms are for guests. I recommended we convert one of the guest rooms into a nursery for Juli, but Milady insisted we have enough room in the expansive Mistress Suite, for the baby's needs at this time.

I placed the bag on top of the dresser, and turned down the queen size bed. liz had placed fresh flowers from the back flower garden in the vases this morning, which gave the room a pleasant scent. I have the feeling I will be sleeping in this bed tonight.

When I returned to the first floor, Mother Alli was holding Juli in her arms and making funny faces and noises. I put on my best serious face and planted my hands on my hips to look authorative. "Miss Allison! Did you go and wake up my Daughter?" I only partially managed to keep the smile from my face.

"My aren't you the 'mother bear' child?" She gave a sly smile. "Not intentionally, I woke up my Granddaughter when I kissed her, because she was such a sleeping beauty." She rubbed noses with Juli. "Yes you are a beauty! michael have you ate yet?"

"No Ma'am I was waiting for you, in case you had not on your way here."

"Then go pack a cooler with some sandwiches, chips, bottled water, and some baby bottles. We are going to the park for a little picnic. I'll get Juliet ready and stock the diaper bag."

"Yes Mother Alli, that is a great idea!" With Miss Justine so focused on work lately, it had been several weeks since I have left the estate with my Daughter to relax.

When we arrived at the park we located a shady spot to protect Juli from too much direct sunlight (my lovely Daughter had inherited her Mother and Grandmother's red hair and the natural pale complexion associated with it). I laid out a blanket and set out the food. When we were done we let Juli crawl about the blanket. She laughed and played. Miss Allison had dozed off while Juli and I played tug with one of her toy rings when we were approached be a Policefemale and her rather large male enforcer.

"You male, present yourself for identification." I of course instantly stood and exposed the identification collar I was required to wear around my neck whenever I leave home. She scanned it and compared me to the display of her notepad, then looked at Miss Allison with a little concern in her face. �Is this your Owner michael?"

"No officer, she is my Owner's Mother; Miss Allison Solomon."

"Is there a problem officer?" I had thought Miss Allison was more asleep so she surprised me.

"Just doing a spot-check Ma'am, if you will show me your ID so I can verify you are who the male claims. And the child, whose is she?"

Miss Allison passed her identification card to the officer. "Both the child and the male are my eldest Daughter's. Justine Solomon is her name. I brought them here for a little fresh air while she is out of town for the weekend."

"Alright, everything is in order. We had reports of freemales approaching Females and children in the parks the last few weeks. Some of them have reportedly had Females with them. So we have been checking, especially with Females and males with an apparent age difference"

"Oh dear I had not heard of that." Miss Allison exclaimed.

"It is not public yet as none of these incidents have been confirmed. Have a good day Miss Solomon."

"Thank you, a good day to you also officer."

I watched them leave, thinking to myself how well the enforcer must be trained to be controlled by such a slight (in comparison) Female. I felt a pull on my pants. "michael be a dear and massage my neck and shoulders, they are terribly stiff."

"Of course Mother." I moved behind her and began to rub her shoulders.

All of a sudden I heard a strange male voice behind me "Don't make a move, either of you!" I felt something jabbed into my back. 

"What do you want? If you want food you can have all that we have left, we don't have any electronics or cash." I said when the shock wore off.

"All we want is you two, grab the brat too."

"No you keep your hands off my Granddaughter." Miss Allison grabbed up Juli.

"Don't listen well do you bitch? Fine you carry your precious grandbaby; it�s what a woman is for anyway. Bag 'em both, and cuff him"

I was restrained and had my vision cut off by a canvas hood, and from the sounds of it the same was happening to Miss Allison. By the feel of the terrain and the branches hitting my arms I knew we were led into the woods, before being loaded into a motor vehicle.

I could hear Miss Allison comforting Juli. I wished I could see my precious little girl right now. The van stops and I am pulled from my seat and dragged through a door. My wrists were swiftly uncuffed and reattached behind a post. I hear Juli cry and Miss Allison screaming about giving her back. "What are you doing? Leave them alone!"

My hood was removed. When my eyes adjusted to the light I could see Miss Allison against a post opposite me. There were four males about the room, two of them carrying guns that I had never seen before. One was putting Juli in a simple crib, and the last was a few inches in front of my face, staring at me. All except the one in front of me were dirty and rather unkempt. The one looking at me looked like an average male you would see on the streets, Identicollar and all.

He smiled as I checked him out. He unsnapped the collar and tossed it on a table. "Just costuming, we're all free men, working to free other men and swell our ranks by any means possible. You have two choices male, die, or join us." He fingered my collar, "We will relieve you of this, but the fancy underwear, well that is another thing. Does the old bitch have the ability to remove it?"

"No, Miss Allison cannot remove it." I lied.

"Anyone you know that can?"

"Just my owner." These beasts kidnapped us in broad daylight, I was not about to tell them about Miss Amanda, Lucy, or Adrianne and risk them being dragged into this.

"Shame we could have used some fresh sperm in the breeding pool."

He turned to Miss Allison and pulled down her pants. "Can you still bear children bitch?"

"What if I can't?"

"Then you are useless." He snapped at her.

"Let Miss Allison and my Daughter go, and I'll join you." Miss Allison looked at me in surprise.

"No, the brat is going to be used to breed as soon as she is able, and if the old bitch can't breed she's dead." He looked back at me, care to join her or us?"

"Please, let my Daughter go." I was staring to cry.

"Ahh! Look at the 'male' slave cry for his baby." The word male was said with an insulting tone. "No, like these 'holier then thou' cows, we don't give up our breed stock. The girl stays with us and will be used over and over as a baby machine."

The next I remember I was kicking the well dressed freemale's body where he lay on the ground. My hands were still cuffed behind me. "That is enough michael, he is not getting up." I turn to come face to throat with the male enforcer we saw in the park.

"ben! What were you thinking? I said to wait for backup."

"I'm sorry Ma'am but I had to make a snap decision, these two would have shot michael in the back. He took out half of them himself."

I ran to the crib Juli was in. She smiled at seeing my face; I leaned it and kissed her. The Policefemale unlocked Miss Allison's and then my own cuffs. As soon as my hands were free I took my Juliet in my arms and held her tightly

"What happened ben? I only turned away for a minute!"

"That one was talking, and michael pulled the column from the floor and charged him. Knocked him and the guy behind him against the wall hard. I saw the other two aim their guns at him and I charged in and caught them both from behind."

"benjamin, do you expect me to believe this slight of a male did this?" Pointing to the broken post.

Miss Allison spoke up for the first time. "Mother bear."

"What?" The Policefemale gave Miss Allison a confused look.

Miss Allison smiled at me. "michael went off like a mother bear defending her cubs. That 'man' was gloating that they would use my Granddaughter for breeding. He pissed michael off enough that he went into a rage to protect his Daughter! He truly did do this himself, I saw it."

More Police and enforcers arrived. One distinguished Female started barking orders. "Secure the perimeter and building!" She walked into the room we were in. "Good job Officer Heinline. Get them out of here and get their statements."

ben guided us to the door with the Officer behind us. "It was all the males this time Captain. It will be in the reports."

We told our story to ben's recorder as Officer Heinline took some long-hand notes and asked questions. When the official recording was complete Miss Allison looked at the Policefemale. "How did you find us? It can't be a coincident that the same officer that confronted us in the park found us here so fast, likely miles from the park."

She laughed. "We had walked maybe a quarter mile when ben remembered why the name Justine Solomon sounded so familiar. Because of all the changes to the male Courts after michael�s trial of course. So we doubled back. Not everyday we come across a male celebrity you know. And we found your picnic abandoned. I called in to have his genital device's GPS activated and followed it here. When we found you, I turned to watch our back while calling for backup, and all hell broke out."

An enforcer came running over. "Ma'am they found six more Females in the building, and they have been abused and raped repeatedly. The Captain ordered all enforcers out and all available Females in, because each of the victims seem to be suffering Shanghai Syndrome or Androphobia to one degree or another."

"Alright you return to your post, ben you stay here. Wait, Miss Solomon are you going to be okay with being alone with michael and enforcer ben?"

"Yes dear, I trust michael explicitly, and I have faith your enforcer is a well trained and professional male."

With a nod Officer Heinline went back in the building.

I tugged at Mother Alli's shirt. "Ma'am what's Andro's Phobia?"

ben smiled at him, "It is Androphobia, fear of the male. Sometimes Females who survive a traumatic event at the hands of a male suffer from it. Other's can become dependant on the male and the torture after a long time, that's Shanghai Syndrome."

"I know that one, I had to learn about it for my appearance in male Court." I hugged Juli a little tighter knowing I almost never had her because of that time.

ben placed his hand on my shoulder and looked me in the eye. "michael you did something foolish you could have gotten yourself killed, if we had not been here you would be dead. Why?"

"I am not a good male, I acted like a man, on instinct." I hung my head in shame.

"You fought against the odds in protection of your family's Females, you were willing to die rather then let them come to harm. That is the instinct of a parent, not the behavior of a man. I am proud to call you a male!" He smiled at me. "We enforcers are some of the most highly trained and educated males on Earth. If you were a bit more muscular, I believe you would have been a perfect enforcer. Your protective instincts are spot on, even if your tactical skills are lacking."

By the end of that day, besides the four that had grabbed Miss Allison, Juli and I, ten more freemales were captured, with four more Females that were suffering from extreme Shanghai Syndrome and were being used to blend in.as Owner/male couples in public.

When we were finally released, Officer Heinline and ben took us to pick up our belongings in the park. The area had been roped off as a crime scene shortly after our disappearance was reported. When they dropped us off at home is was a little after 8PM, Juli was cranky with the dramatic change in routine.

I got Juli changed, fed, and settled into her proper crib. I stood there looking down at my baby girl when Mother Alli walked in and took my hand. "michael come..."

I put my finger up to her mouth. "No Mother Alli, I need to stay here tonight. I know you have been looking forward to having me in bed. But tonight I need to focus on being with Juli."

"Yes indeed, definitely a mother bear." She flashed a smile I love because it is the same one as Milady's. "Okay michael, I respect that. Pull over that couch and we will sit here and watch her sleep."

Soon Mother Alli was asleep with her head on my shoulder.

"michaaaeeel, michaaeeel sweetie." I thought I was dreaming. "michael do not move just look at me." I open my eyes to the whisper and see my lovely Owner standing over the back of the couch, Looking down on myself and Mother Alli. "Rough day my love?"

"Miss Justine? What are you doing here?"

"I got a call that you and Mom were involved in some sort of trouble, so we made our way home. I understand you decided to be a hero."

"No Milady, I did not decide that. I did not think, I acted in anger. I am not deserv... oww" A sudden sharp pain in my side made me stop mid sentence. Mother Alli had elbowed me.

"No michael, stop it! No self-reparations. Yes it was instinct, but a good instinct, one of love for your child. I doubt being shot would even have stopped you."

"Sorry Mom, didn't mean to wake you."

"Nonsense Justine. I am asleep in your room on your male. Nothing to be sorry about. Although maybe you should punish him for refusing to come to bed with me."

My eyes must have reflected the shock I felt that Mother Alli suggested this. She laughed at my reaction, and winked at me.

Miss Justine laughed with a knowing smile at her Mother "I think it is obvious where his thoughts were Mother. I don't think punishment is justified."

Mother Alli sat up and kissed me. "Well I expect no excuses for you to spend some time with me in bed tomorrow."

Miss Justine laughed again. "Today, it is two in the morning, and I promise he will." Miss Justine kissed Mother Alli's cheek. "Now you go to bed, I want to take your place."

The door closed behind Mother Alli and Miss Justine indeed took her place. I felt a kiss on my opposite cheek and turned to see liz standing there still in her Identicollar and travelling clothes. "I am glad you and Juliet are unhurt michael. It must have been scary, but your heart did what it needed for Juliet's sake." liz pulled the chair from Miss Justine's vanity closer and joined our little vigil.

"Milady, I am sorry I messed up your weekend. You worked hard and earned this vacation."

"No michael, it would have messed up my vacation if something serious happened to any of you. As it is I'm just thankful my family is intact and unhurt. There will be other spa retreat weekends."

***

A few weeks later Officer Heinline and ben were to be awarded Meritorious Service Awards for our rescue. Miss Allison and I were asked to help present the award. The ten Females rescued that day were also in attendance on the raised platform with us (I later learned it was part of their social rehabilitation). I felt very awkward in a dress suit, I only wore them usually for parties that Miss Justine attended for work or holidays. 

I was effectively ambushed on the stage when my own name was announced for an award; 'male Bravery in the Defense of Females'. Miss Allison got up and told the audience of my actions with pride and finally presented me with the award. I managed to mutter a polite thank you, but between my shyness and shock, I was unable to develop more comprehensive thoughts then that. I think if Miss Justine had not been down in the front row, and Miss Allison had not had her arm around my shoulder, I may have ran from stage. When I returned to my seat ben patted my shoulder and shook my hand in congratulations. With a smile he said; "You did good kid, so much for 'a day in the park' meaning easy."










Revenge 4 A New Purpose in Life

Note: This takes place shortly after the events of A Day in the Park.

I was working in the punishment room. I had been charged by my owner Justine Solomon to rework the restraint devices that were designed to be used only on male property to accommodate female property also. Mostly this affected the devices that latched onto a male's penis or scrotum. I build some form of quick disconnect into these devices and then fit an appliance in the form of a fake penis (many of which were inflatable and/or vibrating) with the same connection so it could be swapped depending if Miss Justine was securing myself or my property-sister liz to the device. The one I was working on presently was going to use a device based on a medieval device known as the 'Pear of Anguish'. The device was pear shaped (hence the name) and when used, the four segments opened outward from the tip of the large portion like a flower blooming, except it would expand inside the orifice of a person and could expand larger then said orifice. Milady says they were used orally as gags by robbers originally and sometime in the years that men dominated Earth, one got the idea to use them to torture women in their vagina and butt.

The intercom on the wall buzzed followed by my beloved's voice; "michael, where are you?"

I trod over to the wall and pressed the flashing button indicating the room the global page came from. "I am in 'the room' Milady. Shall I come to you?"

"No dear, secure yourself into the self-stocks and I will join you there in a few minutes."

A shiver ran through my spine. "Yes Ma'am."

I walked back to the equipment and located the stainless steel device and moved it from the wall. I pressed the button on the back side of the stocks opening the head and wrist yoke on the vertical, and the ankle yoke that was just above the floor. Thoughts raced through my mind; Am I to be punished, what have I done wrong? I place myself in the device, and press the close button on the front of the stock it is just within reach of my left hand, the system engages. The yokes close around my extremities; the air bladders recessed in the yokes' openings inflate conforming to my body parts. Out of habit I press the button again. I know it will not work again until after the one on the opposite side (that I can no longer reach now) is pressed. I am trapped.

In the not so distant days of the house's previous owner, Judge Melissa Alphons, a male was sent here to await punishment by his owner. Miss Justine showed me the recording of the males waiting in this stock for hours, waiting, knowing that he would receive a sever beating with any of a number of whips or paddles that had (and to a much lesser extent still do now) reside on the walls and tables. Inevitably they would receive this punishment, but only after hours of wondering when it would come and how sever it would be.

True to her word Miss Justine came through the door mere minutes after I was secure. More surprising to me was Miss Adrianne, our attorney, was with her. This was the first time since Milady discovered the room that someone outside of our immediate family of three has been in here.

The expression of amazement was clear on her face even from across the room. "Wow Just! You weren't kidding when you said she was a sadistic bitch." 

"When you have more time I will show you the videos, of some of the more tame stuff, it will still make you sick. Most of the truly evil devices I have had destroyed, but the more benign ones I enjoy. Like this one, hello boy." She came to a stop and affectionately rubbed my close-cropped hair.

"Hello Milady, Hello Miss Adrianne. Welcome to 'The Room'." I tried to make the encompassing hand gesture that is usually a part of the arms sweeping out in a grandiose fashion.

Both women laughed at my attempt at hospitality.

"michael, you are going to be accompanying Miss Adrianne today. You are to be on your best behavior. She will explain more on the way, but for now we need to prepare you."

Miss Justine loosened my pants and pulled them to my knees. While she was doing this Miss Adrianne was closing my Identicollar around my neck. I was not surprised to feel my genital device being slid over my penis. When the straps were all latched I knew the indicator that showed they were all securely locked was lit, without even seeing it.

The air bladders deflated and the yokes opened, Milady helped me from the stocks. "michael, the punishment device is installed on your genital device, where you are going it is required, and Adrianne will have to set it to open frequency when you arrive at your destination."

"Open frequency? Why?"

"I will explain on the way, go get changed into respectful, but comfortable clothes."

"Yes Miss Adrianne"

I made my way to the door. "boy, we will be in my office then. Now hustle."

"Yes Ma'am!" I rushed up the stairs the two floors to the Mistress suite and chose myself a nice pair of Khaki pants and collared pull over shirt. I approached the study, which is now my owner's office, just as liz was leaving it. 

liz is slightly older then Miss Justine and myself, while originally she had a little extra weight when we knew her as our neighbor, she has trimmed down the last year and a half since she lost her citizenship, but that may change soon as we are trying to get her pregnant before she turns 35 in two years and no longer legally allowed to become pregnant.

It is ironic that she is the oldest person in the home, but the one of the least social standing, being even below me in the order of things, something our Owner has repeatedly emphansized with her.

"michael, where are you going?" She whispered.

"I do not know yet, all I know is I am going with Miss Adrianne."

She pouted. "Please tell me when you get back."

"Only if Miss Justine allows me to, you know better lizzie." I shook my finger at her. "Now I need to go." I patted the side of her face and went through the heavy door.

"...amazed at how much and how little she has changed." Miss Adrianne was saying.

"Did liz question you on where you were going?" Milady asked with a smile.

"Yes my dearest Owner she did. But I told her nothing, because I know nothing."

"I'll deal with her while you are away. I know you will be good, just mind your manners, and follow the instructions." She placed a big kiss on me that brought on the tight feeling in my genital device. I think she enjoyed the confusion of bliss and pain on my face caused by this.

"Let's go michael."

"One minute please Miss Adrianne." I went over to Juli's crib and kissed her. "You be a good girl for Mommy. daddy will be back soon." I turned to head for the door. "Now I am ready."

Miss Adrianne was smiling at me as I walked to the door.

I went and opened the driver's side door of Miss Adrianne's car and stepped aside for her to enter. "Such a gentlemale. Ride in the front seat michael, we need to talk."

I was very nervous as we pulled through the estate's gate. Miss Adrianne could tell this and she reached over and took my hand then after a moment pulled it over to her and slid it under the hem of her skirt. I could feel the sheer part of her hosiery merged with the thicker panty portion. "Right now we are going to St. Catherine's Hospital. Remember those Females that were rescued when Miss Allison and yourself were abducted?"

"Yes Ma'am."

"Their doctor saw you at the award ceremony and banquet. They have asked Miss Justine if you would be willing to participate in the rehabilitation of the Females. They feel your gentle and submissive natures will help them trust males a little better again. Now some of these women were betrayed by their males, while a few of them watched as their males were executed by the freemales, for refusing to join the freemales." She smiled at me as my hand gently rubbed her leg, the silkiness of her leg helped soothe my uneasiness. She learned from Miss Justine that I had affection for hosiery and used it to help me stave off the nervousness by allowing me to rub her leg under the table in court. "Because we will be dealing with Females suffering from male induced traumas you are required to have the open frequency punishment, and will be in restraints."

"Restraints, but I... with strange females Miss Adrianne, why?"

"Relax they are just costuming mostly, to show you are no threat. What they will not know is you can release yourself anytime, just in case one of them gets violent with you. And only then. Otherwise they stay on until I or one of the doctors remove them, understand?"

"I think so Ma'am."

"Good! Now can you please ease up on my leg?"

I hadn't realized I had even gripped her leg until that moment. I opened my hand. "Sorry Miss Adrianne, I apologize sooo much..."

She cut me off with a smirk. "It's okay michael. You'll find your cuffs in that bag at your feet, put them on we are almost there."

I placed the ankle restraints on first, and then did my hand restraints. "Now for you to release them just pinch the cuff with your opposite hand's thumb and middle finger." 

I did this and my left cuff popped open. "Wow! That is neat."

"Only in case of emergencies. Am I clear?"

"Yes Ma'am, I will only use it in life or death emergencies."

"Take them off now. You will have to put them on before we enter the ward."

When we got to the hospital Miss Adrianne opened my car door to let me out, and led me to the lobby. When she got to the front desk she waited for the male working it to finish his phone conversation. Informing him who we were and who we were there to see. We were told to have a seat and we will be seen shortly.

A really young male wearing a nametag 'joseph' came to collect us. Miss Adrianne asked the same question that I was thinking; "How old are you? You seem too young to work in a hospital."

"I am 15 Ma'am, and anywhere else in the facility; I am too young, but the patients in this ward normally react better to less mature males, we are less threatening. As it is, next year I may be too old to work with them. At 16 and 17 the department head reviews us based on appearance before it is decided if we can continue in the ward, if we look too old we are released back to the school to finish and come back to work in the normal parts of the facility."

"I see. I didn't even know they took this much thought into the treatment."

"As I understand this has only been done in recent years, with the declining number of Female nurses. I have also heard rumors of forcing medical procedures to make castrate upcoming male nurses or surgery so they appear to be females while still able to breed as a normal male."

"That is an interesting concept! I will have to keep an eye out for info on that. Thank you for the that joseph."

The young male blushed at Miss Adrianne's gratitude, "It is my pleasure Attorney Harking. Please restrain your male and we will continue." After Miss Adrianne had replaced the cuffs on my wrists and ankles he placed his hand on a scanner and the door opened. "Right this way Ma'am."

Just inside the door we were guided into an office and told that the doctor will be in directly. joseph had in fact not made it back to the door before it opened and a scholarly Female of African descent entered. While she was not as attractive to me as Miss Justine or Miss Allison, I had to admit her confidence and intelligence stirred the hormones of my penis.

"Thank you joey, go prepare the group room for me please."

"Yes Doctor, I will get right to it."

The door closed behind the child. "He's a good kid; he will make an excellent nurse. Attorney Harking I presume, and michael of course." She shook each of our hands, mine being a slight clumsy because of the restraints. "I am Doctor Cherish Johvon. You and Miss Solomon have discussed what is expected of him here today?"

"Only partially, I would not expect you to give legal advice, I would never dream of trying to explain your psychological processes."

Doctor Johvon laughed. "Fair enough Miss Harking. michael I saw you at the awards ceremony and banquet. I believe you have the qualities I need to help abused Females rebuild their trust in the males and reinsert themselves as the dominant part of society. To that end I researched your history. I of course was already vaguely familiar with your recent altercation with the freemales as it was what has filled my ward with patients." She walked behind me and placed her hands on my shoulders. "I was deeply intrigued by the profile that was done of you during your trial after it was unburied and made part of your official record."

Miss Adrianne grimaced. "It took me a month to get that found and entered into evidence against Judge Alphons." 

"Yes indeed I could see why she arranged for its disappearance. So for your part in this michael, what I want you to do is be here and show these Females you are trustworthy. That you are willing to serve them. That males as a whole are not to be feared. That with proper upbringing, training, and compassion, most males are loving, caring companions."

"Doctor with all due respect, what can I offer?"

"You are modest; first I want you to share with them the events of the day of your abduction. Show them that you were also a victim of the same tormentors; this should form a slight bond, opening them up to your actions of that day. Then I expect you to socialize with them, interact and perform basic male duties for them. Just be yourself; the respectful and proud property of Justine Solomon."

I looked at her, "I guess I can be myself." 

"I have requested you be here every Monday afternoon from 1 to 4, and your owner has agreed to it. I want you to strip down to your genital device and collar when you are with the Females. You will be escorted here and your chaperone or owner can unlock you to undress. Perhaps later we will work you into some of the one on one sessions I have with them later in the week as I see fit."

"Why is he to be stripped?" Miss Adrianne asked.

"To give the victims the feeling of security and superiority they need in dealing with males. Miss Justine, yourself, or another Citizen Female are required to be present to ensure no impropriety. Do not be alarmed if I make offers of allowing them to abuse michael. It will be for effect, and any punishment I allow them to carry out will be fully supervised. To that end michael, you will never be gagged and if you say the word 'elephant' the staff is instructed to halt any activity. Do you understand that?" 

"Yes Ma'am, say 'elephant' if I get panicked."

"There will be a point where we intend to teach the Females self-defense, you will be asked to be one of the 'aggressors' in these exercises. But that will be only after I feel the majority of the group sufficiently trusts you." She looked at her watch. "joseph should have the group room ready and the patients in there by now. Shall we?" She motioned to my clothes. Miss Adrianne removed my cuffs, and I disrobed and was restrained once more.

We entered a large room; there was a circle of chairs all but one occupied by a Female, and an exercise mat in the middle. The woman reacted to my presence in varying ways; amusement, surprise, anger, and fear.

Doctor Johvon looked around the group. "I am pleased to announce we will be having a new participant over the next few weeks. Some of you may recognize michael from the awards ceremony. He was one of the reasons why you all were rescued." She motioned me to the mat. "Have a seat michael. We've all heard each of your stories up to this point; I thought you should all hear the first hand account of the events that transpired resulting in your freedom before he is put into service as a training aid. Remember in his own way michael is himself a victim of these men and at least deserves the same respect in allowing him to tell his story without interruptions." She paused to let the Females absorb this. "Begin michael."

I looked around the circle of eleven Females; I was slightly overwhelmed and scared. The hate in some of their eyes made me scared, I began to panic. Finally my eyes fell on Miss Adrianne. She nodded at me and my mind travelled back to her advice on how I could get around this very same problem for my trial testimony. I soon had told the whole story of that day from our capture until we were escorted from the building.

At the end I could see some of the Females attitude toward me had softened. One of them, a pregnant Female, indicated she had a question. "When you offered to join them under your terms, what were you thinking, your plans?"

"To be honest Ma'am, I just wanted my child and Miss Allison out of there. I knew I would try to escape to get back to my Owner as soon as I could."

"What about us, would you have left us there?" This came from one of the more angry members of the group, and almost sounded like a challenge.

"At the time I knew nothing of the rest of you in the building. My thoughts were only of my family Females. If I had known... I do not know how I would have handled that."

"Would you have participated in our abuse, tried to impregnate us, if they accepted your terms?" She pushed the subject.

"I pray I would not have, that was why I lied to them saying that only my Owner could unlock my genital device. If anything I would like to believe that would give me more reason to escape and bring back help. No person deserves to be raped at all. I have been..." I choked up and found it hard to speak.

Doctor Jovhon came over to me and comforted me and explained. "michael had been on trial for a crime he was innocent of, while being held in prison, he was left restrained in a cell while his cellmates' genital devices were disabled by the guards, he was repeatedly raped and beat by the males all night long." She looked at each Female in turn. "He has much in common with all of you, but he has moved on and continued his life, lovingly and respectfully serving his owner. If a male can move on from such trauma, you each should be able to also." She smiled at me and winked. So that was her game; use me to stroke their 'Superior' Female egos. "Now lets hear about what is new in your lives."

The next hour or so was spent getting short weekly autobiographies from each Female's Journal. The angry one, Miss Louise, refused to read her's as long as I was there. To which the doctor told her she must become accustomed to me as I was to participate from now on as a member of the group. When she still resisted the doctor moved on.

After that we did some trust exercises where I was released temporarily (after a quick test to ensure the patients that the punishment system worked and that all the Female Nurses and Doctor Johvon had a control device). I was put into a different domestic situation with each of the Females to gauge their reaction to my male role. To me it seemed to go relatively well with all of them, only minor hesitations to them engaging in conversations with me, or accepting my help, etc. Two events really went bad and had to be intervened upon. The first was a Female who was one of the few still on inpatient status. She begged me to 'fuck' her and tried pulling my genital device off by hand. The doctor and Miss Adrianne separated her from me and she was escorted back to her room. The second was Miss Louise. It was the last exercise and I was cleaning the kitchen set, scrubbing the floor and she was supposed to give me series of instructions. Instead she began kicking me with no cause. The pregnant Female, Miss Becky, placed herself between us before the Female nurses could reach Miss Louise.

"Stop it he didn't do anything to deserve this. He's not even fighting back" She yelled at Miss Louise.

"He was born; he should have been killed long ago! They can't be trusted!"

By this point Miss Adrianne was helping me up. Miss Becky kept herself between Miss Louise and me �Just because your male turned on you the first chance he got doesn't mean all males can't be trusted! Obviously some Females like you can't be trusted."

Miss Louise was trying to get free from the nurses holding her. She spat at me. "Milk 'em of their sperm and kill 'em. That's all they're good for."

Doctor Johvon looked at her. "I am so sad; obviously you did not learn that it was because of this kind of treatment that scott betrayed you." She stopped and looked around at the group. "Four of the Females here had their males refuse to join the freemales and they willingly died rather then betray their Females. Two others joined only to try to go reach the police and were killed for their attempt. It was because they were treated with respect by their Females." She pointed at me, "One fought the odds refused to die without a fight. Ask yourselves; Why did seven of the eleven males involved here refuse to turn, or only pretend to turn, was it fear... or respect... or love? Only each of you knows for sure what led to your male's decision and fate." She turned to Miss Louise again. "I was afraid you were just acting to be less hating towards males, you seemed too insincere." She addressed the nurses restraining her. "Get her out of here; I am having her recommitted as a violent patient immediately."

Miss Louise kicked and screamed obscenities all the way to the door, her voice being heard for several moments after she had been escorted out of the room. "Everyone else please get yourself some refreshments and meet back in the group room." The group of Females began to leave the room but Miss Becky was checking me over with Miss Adrianne. "Rebecca what made you interfere?"

"It was wrong for her to do that to michael, he obviously was no threat to any of us... and it reminded me of the beating my justin took before they shot him in the head."

"Go on, join the others." She came over to me. "I apologize michael; I had not expected her to get violent, bossy and degrading I expected from her, not this. This gives some credibility to her male's statement that she was physically abusive to him from the beginning."

My restraints were replaced, and we rejoined the remaining eight Females in the Group Therapy Room where joseph offered us beverages and pastries. The Females took their seats again and Doctor Johvon closed the session explaining that how they choose to treat the males in their lives is reflected in the male's affection to his Owner, and how a well trained and cared for male is no more a threat then a child. She also went on to say that she hopes that in the weeks to come that they will learn to trust males once again. After a reminder to keep up their journal, and to make their scheduled personal session where they will discuss today's exercises and events.

Afterwards they all helped joseph clean up the refreshments. I was left in the hall as Miss Adrianne was in the office with Doctor Johvon. I saw the nurse watching me look up. I turned to see the pregnant belly of Miss Becky above me. She sat next to me and smiled. "Are you alright michael?"

"Yes Ma'am, thank you. Thank you for asking and coming to my rescue."

"You're welcome michael. I had to stop her it reminded me too much of what happened to justin."

"You loved him deeply I can tell, I feel in you the same strength as my Owner. Is your child his, or was it from being raped by the freemales?" I realized I may have gone too far as soon as the words passed my lips. I saw the tears forming in her eyes. "I am so sorry that was inappropriate of me!"

"No! It's okay michael, it is a common question believe it or not. It is justin's, and I will cherish this child because of that. justin gave his life because he refused to betray me; even with a pistol held between his eyes he would not denounce me. I am proud of him. He tried to fight back, just too late." She smiled again. �I look forward to seeing you next week michael, you remind me there are gentlemales out there."

And then Miss Adrianne and the doctor were above us. Miss Adrianne's smile was almost infectious "Come michael, we should get you home."

Epilogue:

Adrianne led michael into my office and I looked at the time. Oops! I have had liz in the forced enema machine for two and a half hours. I should have paid more attention to the time. I walked around the desk and gave michael a big kiss. He practically melted in my arms. I love the look of lust on his face when I do this. "Were you a good boy today my love?"

"Yes Milady, I think so."

"He was perfect Justine, everything Doctor Johvon hoped for."

"Good, michael be a dear and go release lizzie from the enema bench in the room, make sure to let the machine complete its suction cycle first. I lost track of time so she has not prepared supper. Have her get ready to go out. No discussing where you went today or what happened."

"Yes Ma'am."

When the door closed I looked at Adrianne. "How did it really go?"

"You were right; he is repressing fears, not from the kidnapping though, but from his time in prison. She thinks it was just brought back to the forefront by the recent events. She feels working with these poor girls will help him out as well as them."

"Good, good."

"There was an incident, one of the Females got violent with michael, he's bruised but not hurt seriously. Doctor Johvon assures me she is having this Female removed from the program as she has an intensive hatred to males that seems to dominate her personality. She told me, off the record, that this Female was going to be removed anyway because she will be in court soon facing cruelty charges, her male was one of the converts and he has documentable abusive injuries that goes back several years." Adrianne smiled at me before continuing. "Johvon is very happy with michael's performance today and is sure he is the perfect male for this therapy experiment, she will be applying to the MCB and Hospital Board to give michael special privileges to become a member of her staff. I think you have found michael a new purpose in life."

There was a slight knock to my office door just before it partially opened and liz stuck her head through the gap. "Milady is michael still home? I know he is supposed to go to the hospital later today and I can't find him anywhere. I needed him to move a few things."

"Come in lizzie, he should be here somewhere." As liz entered the room, I felt the pang of regret and jealousy at seeing the pregnant form of the older female, now in her final trimester. In retrospect, I was doubting my own judgment in allowing, encouraging even, michael (my property and life-long love) to impregnating liz, my female property. I wish it was me pregnant again by my male and not liz. But I agreed with the Male Control Board's request to have her breed before she reaches the cut-off age of 35, and decided michael should be the one to do it. Maybe soon I will be carrying the offspring of my michael again. "You're not trying to clean again are you? The doctor said no more manual labor until after the baby was born."

"No ma'am, I just wanted to rearrange the nursery."

"Again?"

She pouted at me "I'm bored Miss Justine. I've read all the books and magazine's on baby-care three times this week already, I just keep trying to think of ways to improve what I have, to better take care of the baby and serve you at the same time."

"liz you shouldn't have waited so long to find him, Adrianne will be here in a little while to take michael anyway."

"But I've been looking for him for an hour Milady."

"An hour? Usually he is underfoot, have you checked in Juli's room?"

"She was asleep last I was in there, but no sign of michael."

"Where didn't you look?"

"I only looked in most of the main house Miss Justine. But not the basement or the punishment room."

"Oh shit, that's right he asked if he should go clean up in the punishment room, but that was over two hours ago!" 

I look at my watch not much time left. I walk over to the intercom and press the button for the punishment room, "michael?" I wait several seconds for a reply before switching to the global page "michael where the hell are you?!"

Again silence.

"Alright I have to go find him, he probably lost track of time. He is going to be late for the therapy group session if he needs to clean up. I should give him a paddling!"

lizzie looks at her feet (well in that general direction since her baby bump blocked direct viewing). She looked more like a young child, then the 33 year old female she is. �I did not mean to get him in trouble Miss Justine, honest."

I had punished her more then a few times when she first came to me as property, for trying to tattle to me about michael's doings. Not that there was anything to really tell me that I did not know for a long time, michael has always been an open book to me since we were children and I fully approved of the way he ran our home.

"Its fine girl, I am sure he has just got himself into some project down there, and has his headphones in as he usually does. Take some paper and a pencil and sketch out some of your plans. I promise michael will help you tomorrow."

"Yes Milady."

A short while later I open the concealed door to the punishment room. "michael, where are you boy?" I scan over the room looking for any signs of movement amongst the various restraint devices. Finally I spot the tote that michael stores the various cleaning and repair supplies for the devices in the room. 

He has become quite adept at their maintenance and modification since we discovered this room. Actually it was michael who even realized something amiss in the basement. He noticed the basement rooms had a considerable smaller area then the floors above. Then while checking this out I discovered the hidden door. The room was only partially under the main house, and extended out under the detached guest house/garage.

When I discovered the video tapes and computer recordings from the rooms hidden cameras, it was revealed to me that lizzie had been in the room as a teenager several times, and decided not to inform me of its existence when we took ownership of the property from her Great-aunt. Well I revealed to her that I discovered the room by leaving her restrained and at the mercy of michael, after he himself had spent a week in the various restraints, sexually deprived. Not easy on a male accustomed to making love two or three times daily. As I left I gave him instructions to have his way with her. (See Revenge 2 The Start of a New Tradition) The following week I set her genital device to apply mild shocks randomly to remind her she is to have no secrets from me.

When I reached the tote I found michael's Notepad-male laying next to it. 'Prepare to go to St Catherine's-75 minutes overdue!' I could hear the reminder buzzing from the headset attached to it. I silenced the reminder. Now I am worried, michael would not leave this lay, as a gift from me for the 5th anniversary of my ownership of him, it is one of his most prized possessions. I start making my way to the video room to see when he was here last, and where he went.

I start the replay of this morning, the cameras coming online when michael entered the room. I follow all his activities on the screens as he moved from the view of one camera to another as he worked his way through the room. I fast-forward it to the point where I see him in the area where I found the tote. I see him start polishing one of the wooden benches. He suddenly removed his headphones and looked around. He moved to what I believe is an isolation chamber that I had yet to really investigate. All I knew was that in the videos the males that went in always were carried out of it after a long gap in time. It scared me to be honest, but it was too big for me to get taken out. 

I could see michael look at the control console next to the door. No don't tell me he went in to it. I release a breath I had not known I was holding as he walks behind it, I know there was a high powered electrical cord there I unplugged long ago. He returns and checks the console. He does not touch anything and the door opens, he passes through and it closes. I forward the recordings and the screen goes dark and the time stamp jumps and I am shown coming in. Oh shit michael is in that chamber and stuck in it for almost two hours!

I rush back out into the main room and over to the device, nothing could have prepared me for what I was seeing through the door's window. My beloved michael was naked, hanging spread eagle in the middle of the 7 foot cube. Each limb held out by an articulated arm extending from the walls, and two extended from the floor, one penetrating his ass the other holding his genitals. The clothing he was wearing earlier were in torn pieces on the floor around him.

I tried to slide the door open but it didn't even budge. The control panel! I step away from the door around the short wall protrusion between it and the panel. The panel was flashing red. I look at the display:

&nbsp; Unauthorized male in chamber!!&nbsp; 
&nbsp; Security Protocol activated
&nbsp; Identity confirmed 
&nbsp; Launching Level 1 Reconditioning Program for subject
&nbsp; Program Complete - subject Resisting - Engaging Punishment Functions
&nbsp; Female Authorization required to continue/cancel

I touch the screen and it changes to the shape of a right hand.

&nbsp; Confirm Identity, place hand flat on display.

I follow the directions, and get a loud, shrilling noise puncturing my ears.

&nbsp; Unauthorized Female Detected!
&nbsp; Please get authorized Female User to access controls!

Oh Shit! I move back to the door and bang on the glass and yell at the top of my voice, "michael hold on, I'll get you out!"

It looks like he tries to turn to my voice, but suddenly starts shaking in his bonds violently. "michael!"

I run to the intercom and press the global page button. "lizzie, get down here now!"

I am again standing helpless next to the door when she enters. "Miss Justine what is the matter?"

"michael is in here! What is it? It's hurting him!"

"Oh God, I don't know what it is. What happened when you used the controls?"

"Nothing it wouldn't recognize me!"

liz touches the screen and followed the same display I did, except when she pressed her hand down on the screen, it turned green and a Feminine voice emanated from the device. "Recognized: Elizabeth Hodlar."

"Okay, that's a step in the right direction! Aunt Missy must have set this up to recognize me if I ever decided to take up the offer to use the room for ryan. Give me a few seconds Milady."

The arms retracted from michaels's crotch and michael was released and fell to the floor among the scraps of his clothes. As the door slid open I went to rush in but liz's hand reached out and grasped my upper arm. "Justine no!" I was about to tear her apart, I could not decide which of her offences made me more mad; putting her hands on me, talking to me in the familiar, or that she was preventing me from getting to michael. But the scared look she had paused my tongue, and likely my hands also, long enough for her to point at the display. "The security system is still active! Just a few more seconds"

She pressed on the screen, looking like she was trying to figure out the right choices on a test. She turned to me, "Now go in."

I had dragged michael out of the accursed machine and I got down on my knees and pulled his limp body up to me. "michael baby, speak to me!"

For the second time in those seemingly unending minutes liz stepped in and almost found my wrath. Only when I noticed what she was doing did I remember that prior to her crimes against myself and michael she had been a trained medical professional. Skills and training that snapped into place in this crisis. "Pulse is good, pupils are slow but reactive. Bruising on wrists and ankles, and... oh dear Lord!"

"What is it?"

"Electrical burns on his balls." She lifted his hip, "And his ass! It was electrocuting him!"

liz and I both jumped when the intercom crackled to life. "Hello! Anybody home?"

I motioned and liz unsteadily rose from her crouch and moved to the intercom. "Miss Adrianne we're in the room, please hurry!"

liz had the door open waiting for Adrianne to come through when she arrived. "What's the matter liz?" Our eyes met from across the room and her hands flew to her face, when she took in the sight. I barely heard her exclaim; "Oh god no! liz is he..."

"Just unresponsive ma'am." By then they were both over michael and I.

"What happened here?" She looked up behind me. "I never noticed this re-education chamber here before; tell me he didn't go into this."

liz was back down beside michael, once again checking him over. "That's a re-education chamber? It does not look like the ones I was put through Miss Adrianne."

"I would hope not, only about a hundred or so of this model was made, the MCB ruled it too barbaric to use on any males, and ordered production halted for a major redesign to make it fit into the humane treatment guidelines. The manufacturer eventually went bankrupt since they put all their money into the original production line and couldn't afford to retool. I thought they all were destroyed."

"Addie, help me get him upstairs."

Fortunately michael is not a large male, and Adrianne and I managed to get him upstairs to the living room with little difficulty. Although liz did try to help and I told her to stop because of her condition.

"Justine, I'm concerned he has barely moved on his own, let alone talked. Maybe we need to call an ambulance and take him to a hospital."

"It may be a good idea Milady. He seems to be in a deep shock or something."

michael suddenly curled up in a fetal position, trapping the arm I had around his waist, holding him against my own body. He tipped over on his side, my hand under him.

"michael honey, can you hear me? Get me free of him, and let's get him some help. OW! His grip just tightened!"

He began to shiver uncontrollably as Adrianne tried to open him up, but he remained curled up in an awkward hug with my arm.

"Miss Justine, I think he is fine, physically at least. Maybe he has suffered some form of psychological break from being so tortured. But I think we still need to take him to the hospital."

"liz be quiet, what do you know?" Adrianne snapped at her.

liz started to shrink away, but then seemed to think better of it standing proud "Forgive me Miss Adrianne, but I was a nurse practitioner, and I fear for michael's health, he is a brother to me in a sense and the father of my baby!" She held Adrianne gaze for a few seconds before breaking into tears.

Adrianne looked at me, regret obvious on her face. "liz, I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking straight. Let me call Dr. Johvan let her know michael will not be there and get her opinion on liz's diagnosis. I'll try to be as vague as I can." She pulled out her cell phone and stepped out into the hall.

liz looked at michael, then at me, and hung her head sobbing. "Milady, I am so sorry, I just... with michael... and... and..."

"It's okay dear, Miss Adrianne knows you were just trying to help, she feels for michael just like you do."

"But it was disrespectful of me to talk to a citizen Female that way."

"You're darn right it was," Adrianne came back in, "you were also right to speak up; you of all of us have the best knowledge in medicine and anatomy. Johvan is on her way over; she is calling someone in to take over the therapy group. She hopes to keep this out of the hospital if at all possible."

"lizzie go check on Juli, I didn't grab the monitor when I left the office."

"Yes Milady, please call me if his condition changes before the doctor gets here." liz disappeared up the stairs, casting a worried glance to her property-brother.

"Are you alright Just? Can I get you anything?"

"What I need is my loving male back Addie. And my arm."

"Maybe a little 'stocking therapy' will help calm him? Like in the days of the trial."

"Don't play innocent with me Addie, I know you still let him play with your legs every chance you get, you like it as much as he does." I smile at her, before saying; "Give it a shot, it couldn't hurt."

A blushing Adrianne sat on the other side of michael and began rubbing her legs over the exposed portion of his back. "You little tattletale, telling your Owner when I allow you take liberties with my legs."

Usually the feel of stocking and pantyhose puts michael in a very relaxed state, sometimes even forgetting what he was doing. Sadly, in his current condition, he seemed oblivious.

Adrianne leaned in close to michael. "I think I heard him mumble something, your name maybe." She smiled and spoke in his ear. "michael, Miss Justine is here all you need to do is let go of her arm and sit up. I can hear him, but he is not talking clear enough for me to understand."

The gate buzzer went and Adrianne got up to answer it. "I'll let Cherish in, you wait here." She gave me a sly smile.

I stuck my tongue out at her, "Like I can go anywhere!"

Adrianne led in the 40ish African descended Female, and she came right over and started checking michael's vital signs. "Justine Solomon I assume, nice to finally meet you personally, I just wish it was under a better situation. What happened to my favorite training aid here?" She patted the side oh his head. "Usually he blushes when I call him that."

"He unknowingly entered some re-education machine that belonged to the previous owner of the home, it kept him immobile and we believe it was electrocuting him for a few hours." Adrianne gave me a surprised look at my immediate admission. "Addie she needs to know the whole truth if she is to help michael."

"Thank you for that Justine, I'll need to see this device to know what it did to him. They should only use punishment functions if he resisted."

"Given the nature of where it is Doctor, I can't say that is likely the case." I turned to Adrianne, "Get lizzie down here, the Doctor will likely need her." 

"Your property female, why should I need her?"

"This house was owned by a member of her family, the controls had been programmed with her palm print sometime in the past. Something we did not know until we tried to get michael out."

"It has biometric controls? That is a rarity on these type devices."

"Miss Adrianne said you wanted me Milady?"

"Take Doctor Johvan to where we found michael. Help her, answer any and all of her questions."

She looked at me in shock. "Miss Justine?"

"Am I harder to understand with michael wrapped around my arm? Everyone is questioning my decisions!&nbsp; Just do it elizabeth!"

The use of her full first name told her there would be no more second chances. "Please follow me Doctor."

"elizabeth, where is Miss Adrianne?"

"Juli was awake and asking for 'daddy' so Miss Adrianne stayed with her."

"Alright go now."

I sat there alone, save for michael, clinging to me like an abnormal growth. I rubbed my free hand against the side of his head and talked calmly to him. Now I also could hear faint mumbling rising from him.

After a short while liz came stumbling in and went to her knees, crying her eyes out. "Miss Justine I'm so sorry!" My heart skipped a beat at the despair in her voice. "This is all my fault!"

"liz calm down, what is it?"

Doctor Johvan came in behind her. In a booming voice she yelled; "male, who is your Owner?"

I felt michael shudder "Miss... Miss... Miss Elizab... Miss Elizabeth Hod..." 

I was in shock, I looked at the crying pregnant woman before me "Wha... what was he saying?" 

michael sobbed and his grip on my arm got a little bit tighter "Owww! michael that hurts!"

I heard a whimper emanate from him, before he weakly stated; "Miss Justine Solomon."

Adrianne was now at the top of the stairs, drawn by all the noise. "You traitorous bitch! What did you do to him? After all Justine and michael have done for you!"

"Easy Adrianne," The doctor came up behind liz, knelt down and held her, "elizabeth did not do this. She does not have the access to the controls for program creation or editing. Her access only shows the running program and the ability to start, end, or progress the currently running routine to the next level. The routine michael was subjected to was written to entrench, in him specifically, that he is the property of Elizabeth Hodlar. I think he is fighting off the conditioning by literally holding on to the truth. The file date stamp is back in the time of michael's trial and its creator is the system administrator..."

"Judge Melissa Alphons!" Adrianne hissed out.

"elizabeth! You had no knowledge of this?"

She looked at me with eyes the size of plates. "I would never have accepted this, even if we would have succeeded. You must believe me Miss Justine. I couldn't even bring myself to hurt him to encourage him to attack me."

"No but you sure felt free enough to use the punishment device on him when he was helpless!" I was mad enough to spit fire, part of me believed lizzie, but I still did feel betrayed enough to be spiteful.

"Enough! This is not helping michael!" Doctor Johvan looked at Adrianne and I with steely eyes. Adrianne you know me well enough to trust my judgment?"

"I like to think so."

"I believe liz is telling the truth, her shock when we read the screen was genuine, and her pain at the revelation of what happened was as a direct result of her past crimes is real." She helped liz to her feet. "I am taking elizabeth and we are going to try to get the info I need. I suggest you both take this time to calm yourselves."

"Adrianne, please get her special collar. It is in the safe by the front door. Give the control device to the doctor."

Adrianne returned a few moments later carrying the baby monitor receiver from my office. "I need to take a walk to clear my head." She set the monitor down on the coffee table and gave me a hug. "Give me a call on my cell if you need anything. Okay baby?" 

"Yes Addie, go, we both need time to get our heads on straight."

She kissed the side of michael's head and went out the door leading to the garden.

"Oh crap! Addie wait!" Damn, too late! I don't have any phones nearby, and both my cell and Notepad are in the office. I can't call her if I need her after all.

Then I was hit with the sudden urge to go to the bathroom!

-----

We were already a few blocks away from the estate, and I was still crying, a bit light headed, and feeling sorry for myself. Idly I toyed with my Pregnancy Identicollar. It currently replaced the genital device, that could not fit me in my condition, as a tracking device and punishment delivery system. Albeit the punishment capabilities of the collar were considerably underpowered compared to the GD version, can't risk hurting the baby and all.

"Don't worry elizabeth, we will fix michael."

"I know Doctor, but it is just my past sins have come back to haunt me. Now michael is... well you know, because of it. It is a legacy of pain that I never wanted a part of. And Miss Justine will never forgive me, let alone trust me ever again."

"You really care about that, you care about both of them very much." She glanced over at me. "I can tell you did not take to the entire re-education process, even if they did certify you. These are your true feelings"

I turned to look out the passenger window, I wasn't about to admit to something that was going to get me sent back to a Re-Ed facility. Even if the way today has gone Miss Justine was likely to send me there anyway.

"Justine knows or suspects doesn't she?"

"Yes she knows. Almost from the time I came to her. Three weeks into my being her property she talked to me about it and said as long as I was loyal to her and michael, she would not send me back. She liked the idea that I was still part 'normal Female' deep down and not just a 'brainwashed piece of property'. That was her words for it." I looked over to see the piercing dark eyes staring at me as we sat at the red light. "When she has disagreements with her Mother, Miss Adrianne, or other Females she comes to me for my thoughts. She told me at these times to give my honest opinion not just agree with my Owner. Now she is likely going to have that last bit of the old me wiped out. The first time I deserved it, I tried to destroy something beautiful. I almost was sent back after Miss Justine found out I knew or and never told her about the punishment room to her, fortunately she opted to use the genital device's punishment feature. Now I am innocent and she is sure to send me." The last bit coming among fresh burst of tears. 

"Let's not borrow problems from the future, and worry about the here and now."

I caught a glimpse of the Heads-up GPS in the windshield directing a turn. "Where are we going Ma'am?"

"I thought you were smart enough to figure that out. Where is the one place we can get this information?"

"Well no one knows about the room outside of... No, that's not a good idea Doctor."

"We have no choice liz, its her or we have all lost michael as we know and love him. Judge Alphons is the only one we know who will have the Mistress Password to the control system. I need that to get the settings used on him."



We stood outside the door; Doctor Johvan had made me go to the door ahead of her. I was afraid to ring the bell. "Don't worry liz, I have a backup plan, but plan A is to sweet talk it out of her." She reached out a pressed the call button.

A few minutes later the door opened rather abruptly. "What the hell do you want bitch!"

It was the reaction I dreaded, and expected. "Hello to you to cousin, I need to talk to Aunt Missy."

"Tough shit, she doesn't have time for the likes of you." She went to slam the door in my face and felt shocked it didn't move. Neither of us had seen the Doctor reach up to press her hand against the door.

"Miss Alphons, I am Doctor Cherish Johvan, it is imperative I talk to your grandmother Judge Alphons."

"Child that is no way to treat company... or family." My Great-aunt was now at the bottom of the steps. "You're the Cherish Johvan, clinical researcher in male-induced traumas."

"One and the same Ma'am"

"Please come in. I must say, I'm impressed with your credentials and track record, not so much with your political stance."

"Well thank you Judge, but sadly I am not here to debate politics."

"Just call me Melissa; I can't use the title Judge anymore. Tell me why are you and dear Elizabeth here for?" Aunt Missy turned to me. "By the way dear, I am glad that my pulling of strings with the Diversity Committee paid off."

I should have known they would not have approached Miss Justine without some prodding from someone. Under house arrest and she still has the power to manipulate things her way.

"We're here about the Fujomo-Cameron 1000 in the basement of your former home."

"Ahhh I see." A conspiring grin crossed her face as she looked over to me. "Who stumbled into it, the male, or his Owner?"

"It's not important who; I just need the password to have access to its systems."

"NOT IMPORTANT! They took away my Grandmother's freedom! They deserve whatever the chamber gave them!"

"Shut up Mary! Give us some privacy."

My cousin Mary left mumbling about being dismissed in her own home. She ordered lawrence, her male, downstairs. I would hate to be him, taking a beating for our appearance in her abode.

The Doctor cringed but tried to hide it. "Melissa, please just give me the password and we will be on our way." 

Aunt Missy ignored her and turned to me, "You know this is your chance child, the power in the home has shifted to you."

For the second time today, something in me just snapped into place, gone was the meek property female. In its place was the forceful Female self of old, at least in attitude if not opinions. "I don't want it. Please just give us the password, the father of my baby is a vegetable right now. I... We need michael back the way he was. We were wrong to do what we did in the past. To make michael into a mindless male puppet is wrong. He is a beautiful person, loving, gentle, and intelligent. In my first week as their, yes I said their, property, I saw more love between them then I saw in all the Females in this family since I was born. We had no right to try to end that for our own wants. God help me, I love them both for accepting me, even after the hell we put them through!" My lightheadesness returned and I grabbed Doctor Johvon's arm to keep myself steady.

Aunt Missy shook her head "Always one in the family."

"Look Melissa time is short, how would it look for your Daughters, Granddaughters and Nieces if videos of them cruelly beating their males into submission would surface. How many deaths occurred in that room? I'm sure their employers will not hold their positions until they are out of jail, and political backers may pull there support."

"You are not afraid to pull out the big guns. Very well, the password is brandon, b-r-a-n-d-o-n." My shock must have been apparent. "Yes child, the password is your grandfather's name. Now I would appreciate it if you would leave, I prefer being the blackmailer not the blackmailed. I think I need to relieve some stress myself, like my Granddaughter already is."

As we were walking back to the Doctor's car, I felt sympathy for Mary's poor lawrence; he was to be the victim of both sadists. I glanced at Doctor Johvan and could tell she was feeling the same as me. "liz, there is nothing we can do for him unless we witness the abuse, or he comes forward. I swear we are falling back into the same ruts as the men did before us."

-----

I was ready to burst by the time Adrianne came back, thankfully the intimacy we have shared in the time of michael's trial and since, and of course my urgency, allowed us both to quickly overcome the embarrassment of having her help slide my pants down and hold a bowl under me to pee into.

"You�re going to owe me for this one dear." She smiled as she walked away with the bowl.

"Consider us even for you taking off in a huff and leaving me like this with no way to call for help."

"I apologized already, sheesh! Forget one little detail once and someone will make sure you never forget it again!"

I heard the front door open. lizzie stuck her head in "We're back Miss Justine. We're going downstairs now."

Adrianne came back drying off her hands. "Was that liz? Good news I hope."

"She seemed... confidant. Let's take that as a good sign." I took Adrianne's hand. "Thank you, you have been a big help today, I would have panicked long ago. I realized while I was waiting for you to come back, liz could have betrayed me when we found him and locked me in that machine with michael forever. Perhaps we were a little too presumptuous earlier."

"I think we both owe liz another apology later. Damn twice in one day from me, she is going to get an ego about that."

"She deserves it today; she is the only one among us that really kept her cool, at least until we pushed her."

Doctor Johvan returned twenty minutes later with liz in tow. "Okay Justine I need you to unlock michael's Notepad so I can download to it."

I punched in the password and she plugged the retractable cord from her own Notepad into his and began sending files. "liz place the EEG leads and headphones on him please." She turned back to me; "The program worked on harmonic subliminals, a specific frequency used to push thoughts into a specific part of the brain. I have written a counter-regimen that should erase the enforced thoughts by strengthening the original concepts in his mind he has struggled to keep. We just need to give it time to work." She took a deep breath. "Justine this may not work at all, or worse his mind may completely go from having the conflicting orders forced into it. I can't guarantee he will ever be the same."

I thought of having him think liz was his Owner or him as a broken male, it tore my heart out either way. "We can't just do nothing, if you feel this is our best option, do it."

She nodded and plugged in the wires from his head into her Notepad, checked the readings and pressed the play button on his Notepad. "Okay now all we can do is pray, the rest is up to him."

Adrianne took liz to the kitchen and came back with sandwiches for all and coffee for the three of us Females, liz abstaining from the caffeinated drink because of her pregnancy, just drank some milk. liz stayed by my side to help me with reaching the table.

I went to pick up my mug and realized I had more leeway. I gave a slight tug on my arm. "I'm free!"

We checked michael over, his body was much more limber then it had been since he trapped me. Between the three of us we got him situated on his back, his head in my lap. lizzie giggled and teased me that now I was free, I did not want to be. She also went and got the ointments and treated michael's burns now that we could reach them.

I was absentmindedly rubbing his close cropped hair with one hand and holding his hand with my other when he gave my hand a squeeze. "Milady?" 

That one word never felt so good in my ears as it did in that moment, I broke into tears of joy.

He reached up and felt the sensors on his head and Doctor Johvan reached out and stopped him from where she sat on the coffee table. "No michael! They need to stay on for now, the headphones too."

He shot me a shocked expression."Milady, what is going on? Why is Doctor Cherish here?" He looked around the room. "Why is everyone crying?"

Doctor Johvan smiled at him "It's a long story kiddo, just rest for now. In a little bit we will find out what you remember and answer your questions."

"Can I have something to drink? My mouth is dry and I feel like I have not eaten in hours." He looked confused as we all broke down and laughed.

liz immediately gave him the rest of her most recent glass of milk, which he sat up and chugged down and scarfed a sandwich from the plate. "Thank you lizzie, can you get me another please?" Smiling she ran/waddled to the kitchen.

"You rest a little while longer michael. Justine can we talk in private? I nodded my agreement. "liz please monitor the EEG readings on my Notepad, call for me if something spikes."

"Ma'am I'm not allowed to use Notepads."

"liz for this I will make an exception, because you are just reading the display." I should lighten up her tech restrictions someday soon.

When we settled into my office, Doctor Johvan looked a little concerned; I hope she isn't foreseeing problems with michael. "What is it Doctor?"

"liz."

"What about her?"

"She's scared you are going to send her off to a Re-Ed over this."

"Well the thought crossed my mind in the heat of things earlier, but when I calmed down, and the events played out again in my mind, with the clearer head I saw liz could have taken advantage of me being in the machine, or allowing me to enter it before disarming the security system. I knew deep down she was innocent."

"That is another part of what I wanted to tell you, it is good she did stop you. The machine only had three profiles in it. michael, liz, and one for you. The rest were deleted on the day your and liz's were created. I checked the dates against the records on my Notepad; it was the week before you moved in."

"What do you mean?"

"Judge Alphons wrote subliminal programs just before she moved out and set them up that if you or liz entered the machine it would activate, then whichever of you entered you were to get the other to enter after your program went through. The programs were to make you essentially the property, and liz the Owner. The routine for liz also included lines to make her sadistic, to thrive on causing her property pain. And to eventually get michael into the machine to be reprogrammed with the routine that was created for him during his trial."

"So if lizzie hadn't stopped me..."

"You and michael both would have believed you were liz's property."

"Did she know?"

"She had no clue, the files had not been accessed until today by me, and were created while she was in your custody. I also want you to hear this." 

She pulled a small voice recorder from her pocket and hit the playback button. I listened intently, liz's determined voice trying to convince the Judge to surrender the info, her pleas for michael's health falling on deaf ears. And then the Doctor played her trump card. "Thank you Doctor, this means much to me on so many levels. You risked your career for my boy, and proved that liz has fully accepted her place in my home and respects its structure. Not to mention returning to him his own mind."

The intercom on my desk clicked to life "Miss Justine, michael wants you, and he is not a happy male." The last part coming out barely more then a whisper.

I shook my head and thought out loud: "Now what?"

I took a second to take a deep relaxing breath before I entered and vowed to myself to maintain control. When I came into the living room michael was sitting there pouting, arms across his chest and a blanket across his legs. "What is it michael? What is so important?"

"Miss Adrianne won't let me go to Juli, or bring her to me."

"I told him not until the Doctor cleared him." Adrianne said from behind him, positioned between the couch and stairs.

"She's right michael." I cut him off before he could reply. He looked at me ready to cry. Oh the pain in those eyes...

"Why don't we let me continue my evaluation?" Doctor Johvan injected and took off the headset. "michael what do you remember of today?"

"Well I remember waking Miss Justine up..." he blushed, �in my usual manner. Then got up to make our..."

"How about after you went into the punishment room?" 

He looked at her in shock and then at me scared. "Miss Justine... I did not tell anyone honest!"

Good thing he plays chess and not poker. I took his hand in mine. "Just answer her baby."

"Yes Milady, well I went in and was tightening up the equipment you had me in this week, and polishing up what was dusty. I heard a beeping in-between songs on my Notepad. So I followed the sound to the big thing in the corner. Its display was flashing red and said 'Backup Power critically low! Restore Primary Power Supply" He looked at me. "I promise Milady, I did not press any buttons. All I did was walk around to the rear and plug in the power cord. When I came back to the front the display was yellow and had instructions to connect the Backup to the charger inside the door. I went in and the door closed behind me. I tried to get out but something dragged me back from the door and pain shot through my testicles. I remember my head hurting, and my arms and legs held tight, too tight for me to get loose, and I was naked. Every time I tried to get free it felt like my testicles and butt were on fire. I think I heard you calling me at one point Milady, but it was so faint I do not know if it was real." He frowned, "Then I woke looking up to you."

"Nothing else?"

"No Doctor, nothing else."

"I found you in the device, lizzie and I got you free of it, and between myself and Miss Adrianne we got you to the couch. Where you promptly trapped my arm for hours and would not let me go."

"Why is Doctor Cherish here though? She is a brain doctor, not a body doctor." Johvan playfully slapped him. "No offense meant Ma'am."

liz took his other hand and kissed his cheek. "It did evil things to your mind, and she undid them."

"Yes, unspeakable things, and I do not want anyone to explain them to him." I looked at her wondering what she was thinking. "michael, I want you to keep a dream journal. Write down all your dreams you remember. Do this even before your..." She looked at me, "daily routine." I think we both blushed at that. The doctor removed the EEG sensors from michaels�s head.

Adrianne clapped loudly "Well alls well and such. There is a dog back at my apartment that probably needs to go for a walk desperately."

"I was going to invite you for dinner." I said as she kissed me and then michael.

"No dear, I should go. I will see you Wednesday for tennis?" I nodded my agreement. "liz walk with me to the door."

They walked out. "How about you Doctor? It will likely just be Chinese take-out or pizza. My cooking skills are..."

"Below adequate." michael looked at me with a sly smile. 

I laughed "You got some nerve! The sad part is; he is being generous, and I don't think either of the two that can cook in the house are in shape to do so."

"I accept, and that will be fine. I will have to call my male and tell him he will be on his own tonight."

"Doctor Cherish, I did not know you had a male. You never mention him. I thought you were..."

"A lesbian?"

"Oh no Ma'am I was going to say a confirmed bachlorette, like Miss Adrianne. You know career before pleasure."

"Ahh. Well I did not look for a male until I had my schooling finished, and my son just moved in with his new owner two years ago. But I also try to keep my personal life separate from work."

"Your secret is safe with me Doctor Cherish." The smile left his face; I followed his gaze to see lizzie standing in the hall crying.

What now? "lizzie, what is it girl?"

"Miss Adrianne..." liz sobbed and I wondered what she had said to liz now? "She hugged and kissed me, and told me I did well today and she was proud how I stood up to her for michael's sake. She apologized for thinking the worst of me."

"I am proud of you too liz," I thought back to the Doctor's recording, "for what it's worth I do love you in my own way, not quite how I love michael, but you are very important to me, not as property, as a person. I have been a bit strict with you since you came to us; I think there will be more freedom to come for you especially with the baby coming soon."

Doctor Johvan smiled at me, she knew I meant what I said and her concerns for liz's future more secure. 

Dinner was decided, and Pizza Castle made yet another delivery to my home. Something too common here the last several weeks. a now fully clothed michael ate almost a whole pie by himself, he was that hungry after his ordeal. He still managed to hand feed some cooled bites to Juli amongst his own feeding frenzy.

Dinner was also relatively quiet with little being said by anyone that did not involve passing a slice or condiment. But all that changed when liz walked around the table and wrapped her arms around michael. "Oh brother dearest!" liz's usual opening when she wanted something from michael. "Miss Justine promised me you'd help rearrange the nursery tomorrow."

He looked from her to me, I nod my approval, and he looked back to her. "Again?" He sighed.

Between the look on his face, and the little pout she gave him in response, neither Cherish or I could help laughing, which then spread to the pair of them.










Revenge 6 Life and Loss

Story Codes: F/m, Chastity


I woke with michael�s hard cock deep inside of me, God how this makes me feel so good! There is no better way to wake in the morning!

I open my eyes; His own gaze widened as he saw the look in my emerald eyes. He knew, no words had to be said.

He pulled me tight to his own body and without removing his member from my love canal, turned us over so I was riding him. I took his hands and held them over his head and lightly slapped his crossed wrists. I might well have welded his hands together and to the bed at that point, because he knew by that small action not to separate or move those hands until I commanded it, and he was not going to disappoint me.

I played my nails across his chest, he would not make direct eye contact again until I instructed. It was hard on him, he loved to see the ecstasy on my face as we made love, but he knew the second he saw the look in my eye that I was in my full bitch-dom mood. He knew he was my toy at the moment, not my lover. He would be concentrating on holding himself back from ejaculating, unless I commanded it, he would hold back for my extended pleasure.

When I finally did get to the point where I wanted him to let loose, I was in the midst of a multiorgasmic overload and I could not form the words to tell him. I manage to push up his chin and force him to look at me. My michael, my love, my property, he could read the order in my eyes. He pulsed in me as I collapsed onto his chest. I felt him wrap his arms around me, he knew, now was the time to release his hands from my imposed 'restraint'.

We did not need words; we were made for each other. Two lucky humans who just happened to be born and raised close enough to their soulmate to meet and connect, in our case we've known each other longer then either of us can remember.

When it came the traditional time for a male to be taught how to please a Female (around age 17), in poor and lower middle class homes, like we were both from, usually it is a close friend of the mother who teaches the son about intimacy. Proper training schools tend to be too expensive for our class, and it was starting to get to the point back then even, where even upper middle class could not afford it.

I was shocked when my Mother said Juliet Delanoe asked if I was willing to teach michael. I had for years wanted michael in bed with me, and it was just the year before that he had professed his own love for me.

"But Mom, what do I know about sexual pleasures?"

She took my hand, "You know what you do to make yourself feel good..."

"Mom!" I was mortified that my Mother was talking about my masturbating, my little Sister Mandy was just in the next room!

"Justine, show him the areas of your body that make you feel good, experiment a little with him, let nature lead you both. He's learned the basics at school this year, he just needs practical experience. I don't have the time and Juliet wants you to do it anyway." She smiled at me. "You know you want him, you will surely score points with Juliet if you do this for her, it might help her with deciding who to turn ownership over to, don't forget he becomes eligible next year." I was hooked, set-up by my own mother, in cahoots with Juliet Delanoe I later learned, with bait they knew I could not refuse.

The first night, the night we both lost our virginity to another person, was magical, I doubt Mrs. Delanoe or michael�s father tony got any sleep themselves. 

michael just hit every erogenous zone on me perfectly, even ones I did not know I had at the time. 

During the rest of his 'training' hardly any words were said between us, a simple look or gesture was all he needed to know where I needed him.

Going on ten years later and we still have that connection.

"Good morning Milady."

"Yes it is boy. But you may not agree later!"

He wearily smiled at me, he knew, the bitch-dom was only temporarily satisfied, that she wanted to take the boy down to the punishment room and tease him until he begged to be allowed to please her.

I did not get in these moods often, but when I did michael always made me proud of him.

I heard the door open behind us; I did not even need to turn back and look. "What is it elizabeth!" I growled. My female property was the only one else who could be at the door. She knows better then even enter my bedroom before michael or I leave it in the morning.

"Miss Justine, forgive me, but my water broke!"

michael was still semi-conscious in post-coital bliss, it took a moment until it sunk in what she said, than both michael and I shot up from the goddess size bed (back in the old days they were called king size) and rushed to get dressed.

"michael get Juli ready and grab the go bag! I'll get lizzie ready and meet you at the van."

michael had the van out, engine running, and Juli in her car seat by the time I got liz outside.

He helped her up and into the back seat when I saw his Identicollar on his neck. My good boy did not forget his collar, and likely also made sure he was wearing his Genital Device. But I on the other hand had completely forgotten liz�s. "michael, go in and get..."

"Her Identicollar is on the other side of Juli, I'll put it on her on the way."

"No michael, you're driving, I'll stay in the back with lizzie."

liz�s jaw dropped as she stared at me in shock, and I'm sure michael was doing the same behind me. males did not normally drive unless they were trained professional drivers for limos or taxis, and they were restrained to their seat and closely monitored. Very few males outside of driving professions or police enforcers even had licenses.

"I'll walk please!" liz laughed

"Miss Justine I can't..."

"liz shut up! michael you know how, I taught you just for this kind of situation. Just don't break any laws... or hit anybody."

We soon were on the way; if we did get pulled over I would have to open one of the side doors to explain what was going on. The van, and the other automobiles we owned, came with the house; the van specifically was used previously to transport uncooperative males from their homes to the Judge's punishment room and therefore had darkened windows all about it. Fortunately michael was extra safe with his precious cargo aboard and we made it to the hospital without issue and turned the van over to a valet at the entrance to the emergency ward. She was shocked to take the keys from a male.



In the Birthing Center waiting room michael was pacing back and forth, and it was driving me crazy. I shifted Juli to my other shoulder. "Were you this nervous when I had Juli?"

"I do not remember, I think Miss Amanda had a nurse give me a tranquilizer... or three."

"HA! That does sound like something she'd do!"

Juli started wiggling about to look at michael, and stretched out her arms in his direction. "daddy hold!"

michael took her from me and sat down next to me. "Two year's old and she's got you wrapped around her little finger already! So help me if you side with her in one Mother-Daughter argument you'll spend the rest of your life in the room."

He smiled at me. "You're just jealous you did not have this level of control of me until we were 18!"

"boy, I had absolute control of you a lot longer then you will admit. Remember when I told you to go into the old Windmere House to get my frisbee when we were twelve. You didn't care it was 'haunted' or condemned. I told you go and you went."

"And stepped on a rusty nail ten feet in. Oh Mother was mad at me! When I proudly told her I did it because you told me to, she got all the more mad and asked me if someone told me to jump from the roof if I would do it? I told her if it was Miss Justine I would! dad just shook his head and walked away. He mumbled something about being glad that these conversations where no longer the man's responsibility"

"But you got my frisbee back. And you got a kiss from me as a reward."

"And a tetanus shot! Which at that age, both were about the same level of trauma." He laughed.

"You man!" I playfully slapped his face.

"Momma, lithie hurt?"

"No baby, lizzie is having your little baby Sister or brother."

She smiled. "Me Sista?"

"Miss Solomon?" There was a Doctor in the doorway.

"Yes, that's me."

"Can you come back please? elizabeth wants to see you."

michael perked up "Has she had the baby?"

"No, not yet. Is he safe to leave here alone with a child? I can have a nurse or guard brought in."

"michael�s fine Doctor. Our Daughter is completely safe in his hands and he isn't going anywhere."

She led me down the hall. "Ma'am there has been a complication, elizabeth�s heart rate has become erratic and her pulse has weakened dramatically. We don't know why, but we could lose her and/or the baby if we don't take the baby now."

"Then what are we doing talking about it?"

"We needed your permission and she insisted on talking to you before we did anything." 

She opened the door and there was lizzie splayed open before me. "Milady! Please save my baby!"

"Of course lizzie, you know..."

"Miss Justine please promise me you will raise my baby as your own. I don't think I'm going to make it!"

"liz you will be fine girl."

"Please Justine!!!"

The fear in her eyes was something I will never forget. "I will, you are a member of my family, your child is also my step-child. If anything happens she or he will be taken care of properly, you know michael will not allow it any other way."

She smiled weakly at me. "Thank you Milady."

We were moved to the operating room a few moments later. I stayed next to liz the whole time, talking to her telling her it will be alright. She held my hand tight, and kept reminding me of my promise.

I was praying that the baby came out fine, both michael and lizzie would be devastated if it didn't survive. Then I heard the baby cry! liz squeezed my hand all the more tighter begging me with her eyes.

"Miss Solomon, elizabeth has given birth to a healthy baby boy!" 

They brought him over to me, and I held him only for a moment. The child was legally mine, but I knew where he really belonged, nestled to his natural mother. 

As liz held her firstborn child I smiled at her.

"He is beautiful, my son." She said to no one in particular.

"Do you have a male name picked out?"

"I can pick the name?"

"We went over this girl, I may be the legal Mother, but he is your biological child, I won't take that away from you."

"I did have only two I thought of for a male, but I fear you will reject both."

The staff was working around us still trying to get lizzie's system straight. "Try me."

"I want to name him for his father, but I will understand if you want to save that privilege for your own son, the other is ryan after my male."

Both had special meaning to her, and to michael, as ryan had also been a good friend of his. "michael junior it is then, but the next of us to have a son will name him ryan."

"Oh thank you Miss Justine! But I fear my chances... of...&nbsp; hav..."

I saw her go limp and grabbed the baby, just as the medicos pushed me away to work on liz. 



I found michael and Juli outside the nursery window, my little Girl saw me first. "Momma, lithie baby!" She proudly patted her own chest "Sista" She looked at me for a second and held out her arms to me "Momma hold." The sadness in her eyes told me she knew. Damn! If I can't keep it from a toddler how was I going to keep it from the male who knew me inside and out?

michael turned to give me Juli; we locked eyes and the pride that was on his face disappeared. Just like when I had to tell him about his Mother, he knew, the second our eyes met the critical information passed from me to him without as much as a syllable leaving my mouth. 

"How?"

"They don't know yet baby, they think it was something with her heart."

And just like with his Mother, I could see he wasn't going to hold himself together, I closed the gap between us and took him in my arms just as the tears rolled down his face. He looked back at the window to their son. "Did she at least..."

"Yes, she held him. And she named him michael junior. But I think we will call him mikey for now."

He buried his face in the side of my neck.� This should have been a happy day for her, for all of us!"

"Honey, I know it's of little comfort, but she was happy, she knew something was wrong, she was happy her baby was fine and would have us as parents."

"It's not right Miss Justine. She just wanted to love and be loved."

"I know boy. And we gave it to her. Now is not the time for regret and sorrow. Your son, our son needs us. We will mourn later. Would you like to hold your son now?

He kissed my neck and pulled back. "Yes, I need to do that."

"daddy messy!"

He did look like hell. "Go clean up michael, you should look your best when you meet your son."



We spent the rest of the day with little mikey, michael brightened a little more each hour. Juli was proud to be a big sister and made sure to tell every person that this was her 'babybruda'.

By the time we left Juli was asleep in her father's arms. When we got home michael tucked Juli into her bed as I prepared a nice hot shower for the two of us. michael was silent the whole time. He was not himself, almost mechanical.

I dismissed him to bed, and finished drying and brushing my long red hair without his help. God I forgot how hard that was without him.

He was waiting for me in bed; I slid into bed next to him and was immediately wrapped up in his arms. "Good night Miss Justine."

I kissed him. "Good night boy, I love you."

"I love you too Milady. Sorry if I seem out of sorts, this is all a bit much for my simple mind to grasp."

"It's okay honey, I understand. Wake me up at normal time, just a wake up, no morning fun; I don't think either of us will really be in the mood."

"Yes my lovely Lady"

I laid there waiting for his soft snoring to start before I allowed myself to sleep.



In the morning I woke to an empty bed. I look to the clock to see it is just past 8 and michael�s dream journal is open in front of it. 

8?! michael should have got me up an hour ago! 

I get out of bed and throw on a nightgown. He must have woke up sometime last night, wandered off and fell asleep again. I thought about his dream journal. I usually don't read it unless he or Cherish say I should, but with it sitting open on the night stand I decided today was a good day to check.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had a very bad dream tonight. We took liz to deliver the
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; baby and there were complications. The baby survived (a boy!)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but liz did not! It was very unpleasant; I was not handling it well,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and Miss Justine was being very understanding. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt lost, scared. How was I going to take care of Miss Justine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a baby, a toddler, and a big home without liz.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think I will go check in on liz before waking Miss Justine, just so it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is out of my mind while we make love.

I walked down the hall, I checked Juli's room; my little red haired angel was asleep still. I had hoped michael was there too.

I went to the next room, liz�s room; I could hear him just on the other side of the door. I opened the door to see him kneeling next to her bed. He turned to me tears down his face. "It wasn't a dream Miss Justine! Please tell me it was all a bad dream!"

I got down next to him and took him in my arms "I can't sweetie, I wish I could. I'm sorry."

We sat like that for several minutes. The biggest problem with such gentle sweet males is always the emotional attachments, to you, the children, and in this case other property. But in my opinion, I would rather deal with a male crying on my shoulder, then having to punish one for being mannish.

I led him back to our room and sat on the ornate couch in the corner. I made him look at me person to person. "michael, be strong for me, for Juli and mikey too. We all need you dear. We must move past this, continue living. We can't let the past cripple us."

"I know, but it is just... I don't know, such a shock to me, one day she is here happily waiting the baby, the next she is gone. I do not even remember saying a word to her yesterday. What kind of a mate am I that I did not even wish the mother of my child good luck when she went to deliver?"

"michael you were there holding her hand right up to the door to the obstetrics department, when they had to make you let go. You didn't need words, you were telling her through touch."

"Jay! Get out of bed already! We're here." My sister's voice came from the intercom, interupting the conversation.

I walked over to the wall mounted device. "Obviously, we'll be down shortly, my alarm didn't go off this morning."

"Last time your alarm didn't go off it was because he was in my bed."

My sister Amanda looked like my younger clone, but had a bad habit of being crass around family. She was still a gentle, loving person otherwise just had no manners in private. "Just go make yourselves some coffee Em. Now's not the time."

"Sorry Jay, I wasn't thinking. See you two in a few minutes."

I turned back to the couch and michael was gone! He didn't go out the door. Where is he?

"Is this outfit fine for you Milady?" michael said as he came out of the walk in closet. This is the boy I love, anticipating my needs.

"Fine michael, get yourself dressed and rouse Juli."



"Your coffee is on the table Ma'am. Miss Amanda asked me to make your breakfast."

"Thank you carlos. Good Morning kiddo" I gave my sister's male a peck on the cheek.

carlos was Mandy's little project. Her hurt puppy, nursed back to health. 

He was born into a household of a pair of elitist Lesbian Citizen Females, who owned and tolerated a male each as household slaves. They used artificial insemination to get pregnant to have a child by one of their males. Unfortunately they only wanted Female children, and abused the child horribly for not being a Female. When he was 16 his father went to the MCB when the Mother and her partner decided to illegally castrate the poor boy because they did not want to be responsible for the birth of another useless male to society. All three males were immediately removed from the home. 

Mandy had just started interning at the shelter as a Social Worker. carlos feared all Females at the time, but my sister seemed to be able to reach out to him. They grew close; eventually she petitioned the state for ownership, and the reviewers decided she was likely the best chance he had for an emotionally normal life. They are not in true love like michael and I, but what they have is close. More of a mutual admiration. He still has much distrust for most Females (myself and our Mother excluded, we have earned his respect), but at least he is no longer frozen with fear every time he leaves the home.

I sat down where my 'World's BEST Owner' mug was, across from my sister.

"Morning Sis, how is my michael doing? And you of course too!"

Worded to bait me, not today Sis. Normally we would banter about how Amanda had (or maybe yet has) a crush on michael. michael had taken her virginity at our Mother's request. Better a male she knows and loves, then a cold lifeless stimulator device.

"Me; Fine for the most part. michael; He has taken it all pretty hard. He has survivor's guilt. He had himself convinced it was all a bad dream when he woke up. Even wrote it down in the journal. Then he went to see her before waking me, and he went downhill from there."

"Oh, Justine I'm sorry. Here I am trying to be normal and all."

"Like you could ever be normal Miss Amanda. But that is what I love about you� carlos put a plate of eggs and toast in front of me. "Is michael coming down soon?"

"Right behind you kid. Make sure you properly clean up my good pan when you�re done with the eggs. Look who is here Juli."

"Aunt Mandy!"

"Hey sweetie, ready to spend the day with me and carlos?"

She frowned and looked at me. "brudda?"

Mandy came around the table and took Juli from michael. "Later today you and I will go see him, unless he comes home with Mommy and daddy. Okay?"

With an exaggerated nod of her head Juli smiled and said "Okay!"

carlos brought out michael�s plate. "Sus huevos papay."

"Gracias carlos. That is the correct word?" 

"Yes michael, very good. Now eat up we need to leave." 

I finished first since I had already been eating. I signaled Mandy to follow me out.

"The van keys are in the cabinet next to the kitchen door, I'm taking the car."

"Mom coming in to see him today?"

"Doesn't want to at all. Her Irish temper is still holding a grudge against liz and has extended it to her offspring. She said some stuff I would rather forget."

"Does that surprise you?"

"No, but I would hope by now she would be more accepting."

"What did you once tell me; she's new wave-old school."

"Yeah new standards with old philosophies." We laughed for a moment. "Any problems call me."

"We'll be fine Jay. Right Squirt?"

Juli just smiled and played with Mandy's shoulder length hair.

michael came to the living room doorway "Miss Justine are we almost ready?" 

"Yes dear, I just need to get my Notepad and the car seat in case we need it."

I kissed Juli. "Be a good Girl, and you will see baby mikey." She squealed in delight. "Say your goodbyes michael and get out the car." I was almost out the door and turned to my Sister, "Goodbye doesn't include removing his genital device."

She stuck out her tongue "Party pooper!" An action Juli imitated.

michael gave my Sister a scowl "Juliet! Be a good girl; tell Aunt Amanda she is bad for teaching you unladylike behavior."

She promptly stuck her tongue out at my Sister "Bad Aunt Mandy." I walked away before I burst out laughing

I could hear Mandy giggling, followed by the exasperation in michael's voice down the hall; "Just give daddy a kiss Sweetheart. I swear I don't know how Mimi has any red hair left after raising these two."



When we arrived at the hospital there were two Females arguing with the guard at the nursery's security desk. I directed michael to the side to set down his burden and we took seats while waiting to sign in.

The Female raved at the Guard; "Look bitch, I'm just here to pick up my Sister's child, she's feeling sick today. You have a letter she signed authorizing the release."

"Sorry Ma'am we can only release to the parent, child services, or MCB Social"

Just then a burly male, that was obviously a security enforcer, entered from the security door. "Ma'am, you requested me."

"Yes alan, Please remove Miss Solomon and her companion from the building."

michael and I looked at each other. I blurted out; "But we just got here! What did we do?"

All eyes turned to us. And I realized she was not referring to the two of us. The two Females ran for the door, closely followed by the enforcer.

The Female guard was talking into her radio, ordering all exits to be closed and giving a description of the offending Females.

"Miss Justine Solomon?" I nod my head. "I am guessing neither of those Females are your Sister."

"Not even close. My only Sister is at my home with my Daughter."

"You will understand if I require both of your IDs?"

I hand over my driver's license, "Of course." At my signal michael leans down and pulls out his collar to be scanned.

We spent the rest of the morning in relative silence, basically only talking to the baby. Then michael hit me with a question I had not really thought of much since early on in liz's pregnancy.

"Milady, what will you have mikey call you?"

"Well to be honest I was originally thinking we would have him call me Mommy Justine or Aunt Justine, I wanted to discuss it with lizzie after the baby was born. I wanted the baby to know lizzie was her or his true mommy, and have that special connection with her." I walked over and took him from michael; my eyes started tearing up a little. I sat on michael's lap and leaned into him as he reached around us. "I will be his Mommy, but I want... need him to know about his real mother. michael look me in the eyes; I promised lizzie I will raise the baby as my own, and I will, with all the same love I provide to Juli. It was my promise to liz, and now my promise to you. But he should not be denied the knowledge of his true Maternal heritage either."

"Yes my lovely Owner."

I gave him a deep kiss; I could feel him holding himself back. He was not letting himself flow into me as normal. "What's wrong boy?"

"I... I'm not sure Milady; I just don't feel like myself. Forgive me." 

Two contractions in one sentence! Unheard of from the male who prides himself on speaking properly, as he was taught males should speak. Occasionally michael has let one slip, especially if he is tired or upset, but I can't remember him ever using two in the same conversation.

"It's okay, the last two days have been hard. It's understandable."

"Thank you Miss Justine."

That afternoon was a flurry of activity. Mandy arrived with Juli, deciding to leave carlos at my house to prepare a dinner, much to michael�s chagrin (he hated anyone cooking in 'his' kitchen but he and liz). The Doctors declared mikey fit and released him to my care. And in the midst of it all, I made arrangements for liz's funeral.

We had a basic service three days later, the Alphons and Hodlar clans made a pass at the viewing but did not stay, or come to the cemetery. When liz�s birth family had come through michael was on edge especially when the Judge came through with her Granddaughter Mary. He held the children close and practically cowered behind me. I realized it was the first time he had come face to face with the Female that had arranged his prison rape, and I kicked myself for not expecting and planning for this occurrence. Fortunately Adrianne and Doctor Johvon had; they swooped in to spirit the three of them away so michael could get himself composed. We had seen a few of the people from our old building, but not many. Several of our old neighbors had been alienated by liz when it was revealed that she had been the one who made false claims against their males as she had with michael.

She was buried under her birth name, next to her ryan. The cemetery director said I could have had the headstone modified to reflect that she was my property. I declined having her name changed. As far as I was concerned in her death she was freed from my ownership, but I did have them add the word 'Mother' under her name.

In the days following Mandy and carlos went home and I took a few days off from my work to spend bonding as a family. I extended the cleaning contract from the service I had hired during liz�s last trimester. While michael was not keen on stranger's in our home, he had admitted he could not handle it all himself with having two young children to care for also.

Our love life was suffering. michael went through the motions for my sake, but his heart was not in it. He would bring me to climax and quit. One night I decided to play on michael�s hosiery fetish. I had him go to bed, and I changed into sexy lingerie with stockings and a garter belt. It felt so good to dress like this again for him, it had been way too long since I seduced my boy. I peeked in on him and he was laying in bed with his back towards me. I crept up on him and pounced.

There was the briefest struggle until michael saw that I was his attacker. Then I was quickly on top of him, my bare crotch pressed down on him, I had my knees to the outside of his legs, and my feet to the inside so he would have no choice but to feel the stocking next to his skin. I leaned in and pressed my breasts against him, dragged his hands up to the base of the headboard and slapped them.

He had this dreamy look in his eyes. "Ooohhh Miiiilady!"

I slid repeatedly over his penis and felt it harden beneath me. I reached down and aimed him into my hole and impaled myself on him. Oh this felt so good! He hasn't been this hard in me since that day.

I was pushing him over the edge I could feel it as the muscles in his body stiffened. He opened his eyes and looked at me as his panic set in. I felt him go soft in me and for the first time I can ever remember michael removed his hands unexpectedly from where I slapped them down earlier.

"No, I'm sorry, I can't" He rolled me off of his lap onto the bed.

I was furious! "Down to the room now! I will take care of you as soon as I change."

He looked at me in shock, but slinked away without a word.

I walked in to the punishment room wearing my terry cloth robe and scanned the room for michael. I found him secured into the self-closing stocks. He knew he was in trouble and trying to show his submission.

I grabbed a paddle from the wall and let a flurry of swats across his exposed ass. He did little more then whimper with each hit. He was not going to insult me by begging for mercy. My arm tired and I dropped the paddle to the floor. I pressed the button that released him from the device and dragged him over to a stock table, which could hold him flat on his back or stomach, and locked him in face-up. He did not resist in the slightest, he knew better.

 I grabbed the bag I brought with me from the bedroom and emptied it on his chest. "Do you know what this is?"

"The clothes you were wearing in bed."

"No, they were the clothes I put on for you! I wanted to make love to you! I wanted it special for you! I wanted to feel your pleasure meld with my own! And you keep denying me your sperm. Why?"

"Milady..." I slapped him.

"That term is reserved for my lover; you are not that male anymore! You are a sperm donor!" That hurt him deeply. I could see it in the quiver of his lip. "Now answer me!" The tears started flowing from him.

"Miss Justine I am sorry! I am afraid!"

"Oh you are going to have plenty to be afraid of!"

I gagged him with a ball, and proceeded to mount him. I rode him hard, talking nasty and rubbing myself against him. I was going to have him cum if it killed me, or him.

I saw it in his face as he passed the point of no return, I felt the viscous liquid pass into me. Finally! The two orgasms I had while building him to this point had drained my anger so I leaned over to kiss my male over his gag when I saw he was crying his eyes out.

I popped the ball from his mouth. He turned his head away, refusing to make eye contact. "Why? I love you more then anything! Why did you do it?"

I stared at him, dumbfounded by his reaction when it dawned on me what had just happened; In my anger I raped him. He was not a willing participant, he was a victim. My victim! He was raped again, but this time it was not some violent strangers in a maximum security prison cell, it was by the one person he trusted the most, the one he relied on to take care of him. I betrayed his trust in me.

Whatever his reasoning for holding back on me, he of all people did not deserve this, not from anyone, and especially not from me! "What have I done?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I got off of him, released his arms, leaving it to him undo his own legs, and I just ran from the room. I wasn't even halfway to the stairs when I stumbled and ended up in a crying heap in the hall, unable to make myself even stand.

I don't even know how long I was there when I saw michael�s shadow fall over me. I half expected him to keep on going, or to be kicked as he passed. Instead he knelt down and took me in his arms. "It is okay Mil... Owner. I am here; you will be alright, I will take care of you." 

I am confused, why is he being protective of me? He lovingly caresses me, and kisses my cheek.

He picks me up and carried me all the way to the Mistress Bedroom and tucked me in. I cried myself to sleep as he sat on the bed looking at me and holding my hand.

When I woke up in the morning, it was before the alarm was set to go off, so michael was still asleep. He was holding me tight, but I managed to get loose without waking him. I looked at myself in the bathroom mirror and wished I hadn't. I looked like hell warmed over. My eyes were bloodshot and I had bags under them that you could carry a cell phone in.

michael was still asleep in bed when I returned to the bedroom; I turned the clock off a few minutes before it was set to ring. I pulled the baby monitor from beside his head, he had the volume at its lowest setting so he could hear it but it would not disturb me. Today I would be his alarm clock as he has been for me all these years. 

Was this a good idea? I just raped him last night, would he be further traumatized? 

I decided I would render oral service. It was something I have rarely done with michael myself, but had ordered lizzie to do it often to him. Just a little something that reminded them both that he was superior to her. Something for his enjoyment only, and at her expense, especially when she was still in forced celibacy

After last night michael deserved it, he has always treated me with love and respect, even trying to ensure I got my jollies even if he was not in the mood for whatever the reason, my abusing him like that was the ultimate betrayal of his love.

I pulled back the blanket, ever so gently so as not to disturb him. There was his little friend semi-hard in its morning needs. I took it in and began. I watched the smile form on his face and his man instincts kicked in and his hands grasped the sides of my head as he began speeding up my motions. Then his hands stopped my movement completely, his eyes jerked open and locked onto mine. He was shocked that it was my head he held. Then his fear crossed between us, he was wondering how I got in that position, and why he was doing it to me. He feared retribution. I smiled as best I could, relaying with my eyes that all was good as I overcame his hold to keep up with my mission.

He stared down at me in awe and love, I conveyed my apologies, and he answered there was no need. All this, without a sound other then the air and moisture passing between my lips and his cock. I knew then our love was still intact, despite my actions last night. His eyes telegraphed his impending ejaculation, and he tried pulling my head free of his cock to spare me the indignity, but I would not relent, I took his full load and swallowed as much as I could. 

"Milad..." He frowned. "Forgive me, Miss Justine, what was that for?"

"Milady is fine boy; I crossed a line last night that I should have never even approached, regardless of my anger and frustration. I'm sorry I should never have taken you against your will. This was me making amends."

"It was not that it was against my will, I always want to be making love to you, and you have every right to take me whenever, however you want. It is just... I don't know how I can explain it correctly; I don't want to kill you."

"What?"

"I am afraid if you get pregnant I will kill you too."

"michael, is this about what happened to liz?"

"Yes, I killed her, I got her pregnant and it killed her, I killed your property, my own property-sister, the mother of my son! I do not deserve pleasure. Especially if it can cause a repeat of those events with the most important Female in my life."

"michael your impregnating liz did not kill her."

"She died giving birth to a child I sired, I am responsible." He was starting to cry.

"A previously undiagnosed heart condition killed her. It only becomes apparent while the sufferer was in stress. Because it happened during labor, which is an extended period of extreme stress, there was little time to find out the cause. It was a genetic time bomb in her waiting for the opportunity to go off. A good argument with someone would have triggered it, but it likely would have been a shorter experience and let to her being checked by a Doctor."

"Oh dear, all those times Mother Alli got her worked up, she complained about being out of sorts..." Fear dawned on my male's face, as he connected the dots I had drawn for him. "Wait genetic? Does that mean... mikey?"

"Maybe, but we know about the possibility and I will have him tested when he is older to verify. He may need surgery if the condition was passed to him, and he will get it if it is deemed medically necessary. And those incidents with liz probably were signs of the condition, but they were not severe enough to cause worry in her or us."

"I am sorry Milady, I caused you such distress. I should have told you my fears. Instead I just made you feel neglected. I was selfish, I deserved much harsher punishment"

"michael, I am as much to blame as you, I should have explained what I was told about liz�s death sooner. I was actually waiting until you snapped out of your odd mood to tell you." I looked at him and kissed him deeply. "I should have talked to you about your feelings. Maybe I am not worthy of being your owner."

michael grabbed my wrists and rolled me over onto my back. He looked down at me as he straddled my body. I was stunned by his sudden aggressiveness. "Miss Justine, please do not ever talk that way, you are more then just my owner."

"michael..." He placed a finger on my lips.

"You ARE the one who I was, I am, destined to be with. With you, my Justine, it is a union, a joining of spirit that none can compare. I am not mere property to you, no more then you are an average Owner to me. If you are unworthy to be my Owner, I do not want my life to continue, because I cannot imagine being owned by another Female."

"Thank you michael. After what I did last night, I needed to hear that." I rolled us over to get him on his back and kissed him. He melted into me, but he was still hesitant, and he tried hiding the scared look in his eyes. "Go and wake our children, then make us breakfast. Bagel and cream cheese for me. I'll be down shortly."

When I could hear michael over the baby monitor, I dialed the number written on the back of the business card michael kept in his dream journal. The call went straight to voice mail, not surprising for this early in the morning. "Doctor Johvon, this is Justine Solomon. You told me to call if michael was still not acting like himself by tomorrow, well after I made a foolish mistake, I think I had a breakthrough with him this morning, but I don't think he has completely come out of the funk. Call me on my work line, when you can, and we can talk about it more in depth and you can advise me what I should do from here. Thanks."

Time for me to get dressed and act as if nothing is wrong, with any luck I will pull it off better than michael.

"Milady?" I look up and almost laughed, I forgot how silly michael looked with that baby carrier on. With the little hands and feet sticking out from his chest. At least with mikey's almost invisible blonde hair it was not as standoutish as Juli was with her Solomon trademark red hair.

"Yes boy, what is it?"

"I know you wanted some time to yourself to get ready to go back to work next week, but Mother Alli is on the house line."

"Thank you dear, why don't you make us some of your mint tea and we'll both rest while I'm on the phone with her."

He gave me a smile. "Yes Miss Justine." He blew me a kiss and left the room.

I hit the speakerphone button. "Hi Mom, what's up?"

"Just calling to check on how you, Juli, and michael are doing. We haven't talked for a few days." 

Her omission of michael junior spoke volumes to me. "We're all doing fine Mom, little mikey too!" I heard the grunt over the speaker. "Mom, he is my son, you are going to have to accept that."

"No Justine, he is not your son, he is the little bastard child of that bitch you let live with you. You should never have accepted her into your home, or allowed michael to sleep with her. You should just ship that boy off to her family or an MCB orphanage and be done with him! You do not need..."

The rest of her sentence was lost in the crash of the tray and tea glasses that michael dropped on the hardwood floor.

"What the hell was that?"

"michael!?" He was already going out the door, but I saw the pain on his face. "Baby come back! Are you satisfied Mother?"

"How much did he hear?"

"More then I myself even wanted to hear, I need to go to him."

"Justine put him on the phone with me. I'll..."

"You've done enough damage Mother, good bye!" I picked up the receiver and slammed it back down to disconnect the call.

I made my way through the house, checking all the obvious places where he goes, My second guess, but the last to check because it was the farthest to reach from my office, was where he was; liz's bedroom. I wanted to empty it out and make it into a playroom for Juli and mikey, but michael was not ready to do it just yet. Every time something tripped his grief over her death he came running here to cry. This time he was not alone, he had brought mikey with him. 

michael had his back to me and had mikey on the bed near the pillow. "This is where your real mommy slept, take in her scent son, you will never meet her because she died for you to be born. You will never meet any of her blood family; daddy will protect you from them."

I put my hand on his shoulder. "Mommy and daddy will protect him."

His hand found my hand. "I will not let those monsters near my son, even if I must disobey you. liz would not want that for him either."

"Nor do I, michael I have no intention of going back on my promise to you or liz, I will walk away from my Mother before I do that."

"Miss Justine I cannot let you do that, she loves you, she loves Juli, I do not want my son getting between you anymore then I can let him go to them."

"mikey is OUR son, not just yours, I will worry about Mom, you worry about our family, the ones that live in these walls. Understand?"

"Yes Ma'am." He kissed my hand

My phone beeped to indicate a new email and I looked at it. "Shit, I have to go michael. It's the office; one of my customers requested an urgent afternoon lunch meeting."

"Go clean up my love, I will be there in a moment to help you dress. Wait it is only 10 in the morning what is the rush Milady"

"They want to meet at The Woodlands across the Long Island Sound in Connecticut, you know that place that advertises no cellular or wireless access for interruption-free meetings. It's going to take me a couple of hours to drive around the Sound to get there."


Until I was fully ready michael had my briefcase packed, and had updated my work folder from the laptop to my Notepad. I know I am not supposed to let him have full access to unsecured electronic, but sometimes it is a lifesaver that he knows the passwords to my work systems. "Okay baby, I'll be back soon, any problems give Mom... just call Addie or Lucy. And don't answer any calls from my Mother, I don't need her upsetting you. Oh and clean up the mess in my office" I kissed him, "I love you!"

"Already done. I love you too Milady, and I always will." 

I was out the door and a few moments later driving out the gate when another car started to pull in the drive. I rolled down the window to yell at the driver (I am a New Yorker afterall) and realized it was Cherish Johvon! I got out and walked over to her car. "Doctor Johvon, I'm sorry it has been a bit of a mess here this morning and I completely forgot you were coming. I have to leave for an urgent business meeting."

"Do you want me to come back later?"

"No, go in, michael is still here with the kids. I didn't even tell him you were coming. Just give me a few minutes to get going after I open the gate for you and call my cell. I want to brief you on this morning's fiasco before you walk into it."

------

I listened as Justine described the incident about her Mother's phone call and how upset michael had become, I told her I will talk to him and try to calm him in regards to it.

I was reaching for the door bell when the door opened. michael was standing there is shock as he saw me. He had a loaded back pack, a diaper bag and the baby strapped to his chest.

"Doctor Cherish?"

"michael where are you off to?"

I read the thoughts as they crossed his face, the instinctive thought was 'come clean to her', then 'lie' came to his mind, but the last one surprised me 'run away!' That thought evidently won out as I saw him look past me and watched his muscles tighten for action.

"MICHAEL DOWN!" In an instant he dropped to his knees, hands behind his back, and head down.

One of the first things I did when he started becoming a regular part of my Female group therapy sessions was to ensure he properly responded to the control commands that are drilled into males and taught to Females as school children. Although he had not been issued any of these commands in years he responded properly and immediately to each one.

I walked through the door and dragged him back into the foyer by his back pack. He never even tried to get up or resist.

I closed the door and placed myself between him and his freedom. "Look at me, where were you going?"

This time he settled on the lie. "For a walk out to..."

"Without Juliet? michael, you do understand part of a psychologist's job is to be able to know when someone is lying?"

"I was running away to protect my family." The truth finally. "Please I need to take mikey away before Miss Allison forces Miss Justine to choose between mikey and her. I cannot let my son and I to come between them or have him go to the Alphonses or an orphanage."

"So you were just going to leave your two year old daughter alone for the rest of the day?"

He pulled a baby monitor receiver from his bag. "Not exactly, I was going to wait outside until Miss Justine got home in case Juli needed me."

"And how far did you expect to get wearing your genital device?" I had noticed the GPS enabled chastity belt was not beside the door on its stand as I walked through the door. "If you are lucky, your Owner would have come after you herself, and not called the police. With them it surely would have been straight off to a Re-ed for you." He looked down at his pants with an 'Oh shit!' expression "Didn't even think about that, you just put it on right away when you considered going out, didn't you?"

"Yes Ma'am."

I patted his head. "Good boy, that is good." He looked up at me perplexed, afraid to speak. "That shows you did not plan this, it was impulsive, I doubt you would have got as far as the road before you came to your senses and turned around."

"I was not even going to leave the property until after I knew Miss Justine was home and Juli was safe."

"On your feet child, follow me."

He wordlessly followed me with his head down. He paused momentarily at the stairs to the basement. I was almost to the stairs to the second floor when I saw him looking at me then to the basement. As if he expected I was taking him to be punished.

"Don't dawdle boy, you have to put all that back where it belongs if you don't want Miss Justine to know."



I sat on the couch in the corner of the bedroom as michael returned the little bit of his clothes and baby clothes to their proper location

When he was done he knelt before me, his head hung low. "Are you really not going to tell Miss Justine?"

"Well that is going to depend more on how truthful you are with me michael, we are going to have a long talk you and I." I glanced at him and saw is head nodding, he was following the movement of my leg, he was transfixed on the stockings on my legs! I had of course already deduced his little fetish on the first day he joined my therapy group. The way he relaxed when he had rested his eyes on Adrianne, and since then I noticed he paid more attention to the patients in skirts and hosiery, then those in bare legs or slacks.

"michael eyes up!" He was slow at responding, but did manage to look up and meet my gaze "michael what were we just talking about?"

At first he looked at me like I was speaking a foreign language. "Uhh, about you were wanting to talk to me about my attempt to run away."

"And what were you just thinking about before I ordered your attention."

michael's skin changed a nice shade of red. Caucasian and Asian males were so fun to tease because of that. "I was enjoying watching your leg."

"Because of my stockings. Do you want to touch it?"

"Yes, but I should not, not without Miss Justine's and your permission."

"Sit up here." I patted next to me on the couch and he took a seat. "I'll tell you what; I'll allow you to rub my legs as long as you are answering my questions truthfully."

"But Miss Justine has not..."

"I am sure if she was here she would allow it, just as she has for Adrianne. If she gets upset, I will tell her I ordered you to do it." I took his hands and placed them each on a knee. "Take some time get a feel for them." Soon he had a blissed look on his face and I started talking to him and asking him about the events of the last week, and his thoughts on them. He was essentially tranced out, as if I had mesmerized him. He admitted to feelings I doubt he would have otherwise. Well at least now I know the easy way into his mind if I think he is holding back on me.

I took his hands in my own, "Okay michael, now listen to me, you trust me right? I have no reason to lie to you."

He looked at me calmly and said "Yes Doctor Cherish, I trust you."

"Okay then, listen and think about what I am about to tell you, you are a smart male, I know you will understand things as I explain them. michael you are no more responsible for liz's death any more then I am. You do not have killer sperm; the fact that Juliet and Justine both are alive dismisses that theory of yours. You are going to miss liz for some time, if not forever, she grew attached to you and Justine, and you both to her. You developed a kinship, maybe even a symbiotic relationship; you fed off each other in your duties to the home and your mutual Owner. That is not something you will or should forget, especially since you also share a child. mikey may not have been conceived in true love, but he was conceived to be loved."

I saw the tears welling in his eyes, but he kept them in check.

"You told me after liz's pregnancy was confirmed, that Miss Justine wanted the child raised in this house by its loving parents, 'Which will be all three of us' was the phrase I believe you said she used. Give her a chance to live up to her promise, and do not worry about Miss Allison. When push comes to shove, I think Allison Solomon will forego her hatred for the sake of her Daughter and you."

I placed a hand to his chest. "Also you feel betrayed by Miss Allison, and justifiably so, but do you really think she intended to hurt you?"

"No, she loves me, or at least I think she loved me. She has treated me as if I was her own son for longer then I know, and she has shared a bed with me as a lover. It was just not something I expected, you know, her to attack my innocent child because of his mother's past. I knew she has always had disdain for lizzie because of what she almost did to Miss Justine and I." He shook his head, "But it was not like she did not know we were attempting to breed lizzie, and I know she was aware we would be raising any children from our coupling as a member of our family. Maybe she just refused to believe it."

"I will talk to Justine, and maybe she and I will confront her Mother abou..." The intercom's buzzing interrupted me.

"Excuse me Doctor; there is someone at the gate." He walked over and hit the reply button. "May I help you?"

"Yes we are from Godshall's Cleaning, we are here to clean your home."

"I am sorry you have the wrong day, you are supposed to be here Thursday."

"We had a cancellation today, and Miss Solomon agreed to let us come and do your home today instead, so if you will open the gate we will get started."

"I'm sorry you will have to use your company's security code to open the gate, I am not allowed to let anyone in."

"We do not have the code because we are not the crew originally assigned to your home, so just unlock the gate."

"I cannot do that Ma'am. You will need to call your office and get the code from the contract."

"Listen male, open up or your Owner will be very upset."

He went to the phone and picked it up. "No dial tone! Doctor Cherish, go get Juli from the next room, I will be right back." There was an edge of panic in his voice that disturbed me.

"What's the matter?"

"See the buttons are flashing, three long, three short, then three long again."

"An SOS?" He looked at me confused not understanding the context of the old Morse code distress call.

"It means someone is entering security codes into the keypad that were assigned to members of the Judge's family or staff!"

I pulled out my cell phone. "No service on my phone, they must be using a cell scrambler. michael this is a planned out home invasion."

"I need to get my Notepad from Miss Justine's office right now."

I got Juli from her playpen and was carrying her back to the Mistress suite where mikey was still in the crib.&nbsp; michael came running up the stairs. "Internet is down too! Follow me."

He slipped on the baby carrier and arranged it so the baby would be in the back. "Slide mikey in there, I will hold Juli."

"Okay michael he's in. Where are we going?"

"In here." He opened the door to a walk-in closet and continued to the back wall. He waved his Notepad over the wall until we heard a beep and whoosh. A door opened to reveal a three foot shaft with a ladder and child seat on a rope. "You go first Doctor, I will lower Juli in the seat right behind you."

I climbed down, I figured I had to be in the basement when I hit the bottom. When I turned around there was Juli clapping and having a good time. "michael I got Juli, you come down."

Soon he was leading me down the dusty corridor lit by lights protruding from the one wall. "This runs the length of the punishment room and comes up in the garage. We figure the judge had it built to get away if there ever was a male uprising or political rival had come after her. liz didn't even know about it."

"Wouldn't someone sent by the Judge know of the exit and have it covered?" 

"Milady thought about that. Here we are!" He twisted the light fixture to the right, then pushed in an inch and twisted it to the other direction. A hidden door popped open to his left. "She used a fair amount of money to have this room built under the garden. Females first."

Once we were in he held his Notepad over a marked spot and pressed in a set of numbers and the door closed. "There we are safe for now, and help will be on the way."

"Help? You do remember we could not call anyone."

"This panic room has a dedicated outgoing internet connection, separate from the house lines ran to a junction in a neighbor's house, with her permission. As soon as I punched in the lock code, it sent emails to our family, friends, and Miss Justine's coworkers that help is needed and to call the police."

"So now we wait. How will we know it is safe?"

"Only my and Miss Justine's Notepad's have the transmitter to open the door, and it will maintain a link to the monitoring system in the light that I turned to open the door. We can watch and hear the hall in both directions. When we see someone I know or the police, I can open the door by entering the code."

michael slid out of the baby carrier, extracted little michael from it and placed him in the waiting crib. He came over to me and took Juli out of the car seat she was in.

"Juliet, do you remember this place?"

She put her finger to her lips. "SHHH!" 

"Good girl, now you just sit here and play with your dolls."

"Love you daddy." His whole demeanor changed, he seemed more confident, more convicted."

"I love you too Cutie."

"Could you really have broken that girl's heart?"

"No, you were right Doctor. I was not thinking, I know I would have come to my senses, but maybe too late. Thank you for saving me from myself."

I check my phone again, still no service. We may be here for a while.

-----

I am standing at the reception counter of The Woodlands Hotel and Restaurant as the male behind it checks the desk notes. I have been here 45 minutes already and my customer hasn't shown. "I am sorry Miss Solomon, there still are no messages for you. Are you sure you have the right day?"

"Well the email I received was dated today and said 'this afternoon at 1'. Are there any phones I can use to make an outgoing call to Manhattan?"

"Yes Ma'am, through that door over there, there are six private rooms with credit phones for just that purpose. Just wait for one to be open."

"Thank you, sorry to be a pest."

"No problem Ma'am, it is a pretty common problem."

When I went through the door, there were two rooms open, so I close and lock the one closest to me, slide my card through and dial into my office. I punched in the extension of the Female who sent me the email and got her voicemail. I exit the voicemail system and enter my friend Lucy's extension.

"Calloway and Briggs Consulting, Lucy Matthews speaking."

"Luce, it's Justine. Is Margo around there somewhere?"

"Just! Where are you? I've been trying to get a hold of you for the last thirty minutes, since we all got your email!"

A chill went down my spine. "What email? Does it end with a set of initials and a number?"

"Yes, PRP 07-04-12." My heart filled with dread, PRP; Panic Room Protocol, and secured with the date michael professed his love for me, chosen because there was no vital statistic containing it, and we both remembered by heart. Someone was attempting to break into our home. "It says there is a problem at your home and that we need to call the police. We did and they said it was already reported and someone was already en-route."

"Lucy tell Margo to call and cancel the meeting with the Carluchi sisters, they are almost an hour late anyway."

"Just, Margo's been out sick all week."

"She emailed me this morning to tell me about this meeting at the Woodlands... Oh god, I was lured away from michael and the children! Call my Mother and Adrianne Harking and tell them what is going on they both would have got that email too. Tell them I'll be there as soon as I can!"

"Just, what is going on?"

"I don't know Luce, but it is not good! I got to go I'm hours away yet!"

I peeled out of the parking lot and programmed my GPS to take me on the fastest way home.

I was twenty minutes down the highway, travelling as fast as I could and still drive safely when I saw the flashing lights approaching. I pulled over praying they would keep going. I cursed when they came up behind me and stopped.

The officer came up to my door. "Miss Solomon, you need to come with me, we got a call to be expecting you."

Great I wasn't just led away; I was led into a trap!

-----

I lost track of how long we had been in this literal hole in the wall when we heard a noise from michael's Notepad.

At the far end of the corridor stood what looked like your average male enforcer, but was definitely Female, and armed. "Guest house and garage are clear, doesn't look like the passage was opened on that side." She paused, "I'm in the passage now. Do you want me to come and help you finish the main house?"

"Wow, what a brute, she must be a weight lifter or something!"

"Shh michael! I'm trying to listen to her conversation, they evidently have some form of radio communication."

"Confirmed I'll wait here for you."

Damn, if she left we could have likely slipped out through the other entrance to freedom.

A few minutes later an average woman came from the end we had.

michael zoomed in on her face. "She looks familiar. I have seen her before."

And I realized I had too. Everyday for the last week, on a warning bulletin! "michael she was the woman who tried to steal mikey from the hospital!"

Brute looked at her. "Where's the boss lady?"

"She went into the basement, said she had some business down there to take care of and she would be off radio. Unless they're in the basement the main house is clear, where'd they go?"

"What about that car out front, could there have been other people here and they got them out before we came in?"

"No we would have seen them; they are on the property somewhere. Serena will make sure they do not go out the gate."

"I was hoping to confront the male, I heard he took out ten armed freemales alone and unarmed."

"That's bullcrap, there were four and he only took out two, but his hands were cuffed behind his back as I understand it. I have to give him credit for... What was that?"

"You two!" Both Females swung around and aimed their weapons at the large male coming from the house. "Drop the weapons, I'm a Police enforcer, you two are under arrest."

"You drop the tazer male, that's an order from a Female!"

"Sorry Ma'am I may be in civvies, but I have been placed on-duty so I will not follow any orders except from my Partner Female, or her direct superiors."

michael gave me a big smile "It's ben, Officer Heinline's enforcer!"

"You can't take us both out alone. Lay down your tazer."

"Who said he was alone? You heard my enforcer, drop 'em!"

"Come on, time to get out of here!" michael started heading back to the children.

"No, wait for them to be secured and taken away, no sense revealing this room to those two Females."

I looked back at the display to see ben securing the slender Female in handcuffs. What happened next I saw telegraphed in the large Females body language. She spun around and grabbed Officer Heinline by her gun arm, I heard the bones break even over the speaker. She moved fast for the mountain that she was. She was soon behind the Policefemale and had taken her weapon from her and directed it back at its owner.

"Release her or you partner dies."

ben had seen it all happen and had managed to redraw his tazer gun but had not been able to get a clean shot.

"Release Officer Heinline immediately!"

"As long as I got her you can't take the shot, so I don't see that as a wise move on my part."

"benjamin! Innocence Protocol!"

"Miss Lisa?"

"enforcer! I say again Innocence Protocol!"

The enforcer dropped his tazer and pulled a conventional pistol.

"Doctor what is Innocence Protocol?"

Helping to write the latest revision of 'The enforcer Procedural and Training Manual' for the state and city police forces, I knew what it meant all too well. I turned away from him. "She is authorizing him to allow her to be killed in defense of innocents. She is basically ordering him to shoot through her to kill the attacker rather then let her get away."

"No! Doctor remember this: zero seven zero four twelve."

"What?" I turned to see the door behind me closing again. I picked up the abandoned Notepad in time to see michael tackle the brutish Female causing her to drop Lisa Heinline.

"There you are!" She said as she spun around to him. "Save yourself the pain and tell me where the male child is."

"Over my dead body!" michael charged at her again, without the element of surprise he took the brunt of a fist to his chest slamming him into the wall with a sickening thud. He slid to the floor in a heap.

"Your choice." She held the gun to michael's head. I turned away I couldn't bare to watch. The clapping thunder erupted from the speaker and echoed around the small room, followed by the baby crying!

------

I tried opening my eyes, but slammed them shut again as the light was too harsh. I tried sitting up but that met with my head spinning. "What hit me?"

"A fist the size of a baked ham, followed by a wall."

I forced my eyes open to see ben standing over me. The afternoon's events came flooding back to me. "How long have I been unconscious? Did you find Doctor Johvon and the kids?"

"Relax michael, they're all safe. The runts are with the Doc and your Owner's Mother just left to go check on them."

I looked over to see Officer Heinline in the bed next to mine. I looked around and was surprised by where I was. "Why am I... a Female ward?"

She smiled at me "I insisted the male who saved my life share a room with me."

"Keep this up kid and they will commit you to that psych ward you work in for being suicidal. First you attack freemales, then a Female that could have crushed you into a bloodstain."

"Miss Justine she went to a meeting, I must contact her."

"The meeting was a ruse michael, like in your chess game; they lured the Queen away so the King would be vulnerable."

"michael you're awake, I'm so sorry child!" Miss Allison rushed over and gave me a big and painful hug.

I started crying "Milady is dead!"

She pulled back from me, confused. "michael, Jay is fine."

Between sobs I managed to explain myself "But Officer Heinline already told me she was killed, and then you came in all apologetic."

"You told him what?"

"michael all I said she was lured out like a Queen in chess, not that she was killed."

"Bad analogy to use with a chess player, you only lure the Queen out if you think you can kill her." That voice, was I hearing things?

Now my tears were in overdrive, I couldn't see clearly, but the blurry image I saw I could never mistaken for anyone else. "Miss Justine?"

"Yes boy, I'm safe, we all are." She kissed me; there was no doubt she was real now. "You are lucky the way I hear it. If ben was a hair slower I would be the one crying." She tried to wipe away my tears, a no-win situation at the moment.

"Lisa, ben. Thank you for taking that email at face value and checking it out, I'm sorry you got hurt for it."

"A few broken bones, a bruised neck, and a touch of asphyxia. Business as usual for us. Aside of the broken arm, michael took it worse then I did so ben wouldn't be forced to shoot through me."

Mother Alli gave Miss Justine a big hug and kiss. "Lucy said you were in Connecticut, how did you get back so fast?"

"Adrianne had me picked up and escorted here by an old friend who is in the Connecticut State Police. Those lights and sirens make travelling into the city a lot easier!" "But I will have to wait for her partner to get here in my car."

The room's phone rang and ben answered it; "Hello. Yes Ma'am. No Ma'am, Miss Lisa cleared the small house, I cleared the main house, and both were cleared a second time when the additional units responded to the 'Officer down' call out. We are with them now, we will talk to them and then I will report to the scene."

"What did the Commander want ben?"

"According to the two Females we arrested, there was a fourth member of the team, their boss. Did you see another Female michael?"

"I only saw the two in the passage, but they did talk about a 'boss lady' who was doing something in the basement and a Serena who was watching the gate."

Officer Heinline looked at Miss Justine. "Any place in the basement you know she could hide until the smoke clears. Assuming she is tied to the Alphons family since we already know they are aware of things only they knew about."

"Only one I can think of, but I would have to open it for you. That room would have secured when michael activated the Panic Room. And it cannot be opened again until I unlock it."

"Take her ben, I will call the Commander and brief her."

"I will come too." I started to get up, and regretted that decision.

"No boy, you need to stay here. The Doctor said you got several broken ribs, a concussion, and they want to keep an eye out for internal bleeding."

"Do not make me cuff you to the bed kid."

I offered no resistance as Mother Alli pushed me back down. "I will stay here with him for now. Doctor Johvon asked that we take the children home soon though. So I will leave in about a half hour and take my grandchildren home with me."

"Thanks Mom, uhh ben, can you drive?"

"Yes Ma'am all Police enforcer's are licensed drivers."

Miss Justine gave me a kiss, "Be safe Milady!"

"As safe as you were boy."

"That is not very comforting considering my state." I started to laugh but it hurt. I got a kiss to the forehead and they left.

Mother Alli leaned into me and whispered while Officer Heinline was making her call; "You did hear what I said didn't you son?"

I thought back over the brief exchanges that just happened. "You are leaving in a half hour?"

"With my grandchildren."

The sun broke the horizon in my mind as the words finally made sense. I fought back the tears. "Thank you Mother Alli."

"That was what I was apologizing about when I came in. I'm sorry I made you feel so alienated. I had not thought about your feelings, or your love for your own son. I'm sorry I made you feel that you had to run away to protect both Justine and mikey from me. I do love you as my own, and like Doctor Johvon explained, I should accept little michael because of that. I have done you a great wrong son, and I will make it up to you."

I could not hold back my tears any longer. "Oh you crybaby!" She gave me a hug. "But that is what is so special about you; you are naturally sweet and emotional."

-----

I looked at the burly male sitting next to me in the driver's seat. I know first hand he is normally a gentle giant when off-duty. "ben, thank you for saving michael. God knows he would be dead if not for you and Lisa."

"Actually Ma'am the more I think of it, it was because of us he almost got killed. He would have stayed safe in that room if we hadn't shown up, or if Miss Lisa hadn't got grabbed by that muscled up Female. His actions saved me from killing my partner and Owner." He glanced at me for a moment. "Even though she gave me the order, I would have regretted it for the rest of my life. Miss Lisa has treated me well and I respect and adore her for that. Many other enforcers are just used as a piece of meat at home. Not abused, but no real social interactions. Fed, then used for sex and household chores."

"Why were you the first at my house? What happened?"

"Miss Lisa got your email. When she read it she called it in and said we would be responding in POV. We parked down the block after we observed the White van blocking the gate. She ordered me on-duty, we geared up and caught the Female at the van off guard when the gate opened I tazered her. We found her radio ear set when we searched her. Miss Lisa listened in on the conversation as we split up to search the two houses."

He smiled over at me. "Miss Lisa knew they were in the passage and had me go down to distract them from the main house side so she could get the drop on them from the garage side. It worked except we misjudged the speed of the muscled Female, and Miss Lisa got too close. When michael came on the scene, I had no idea where he came from but I saw him coming, and I also ran for her, she instinctively aimed the gun at me, and was unprepared for michaelís impact."

He frowned. "Then was my second mistake, I pulled Miss Lisa clear before disabling the perpetrator. I knew I had messed up immediately, and michael paid for my mistake. When she put the gun to michael's head, I just pulled up and fired, I didn't even aim the shot. I got lucky I did not also hit michael. Well here we are; your home sweet home."

"ben sometimes all there is to make the best with the moment. Everyone must make judgment calls, for all you knew she could have just ignored michael and shot you or Lisa. michael knew he was no match for her, but he was not going to let his friends fight his battle for him, or let them die for him."

We approached the front door when I realized there was a flaw in my plan. "I don't have my Notepad! It's still in my car!"

"Do you need it Ma'am?"

"To open the locked door I will. Where is michael's Notepad-male? It will work too,"

"I believe Doctor Johvon placed it in the office. One moment and we can check." ben Pulled out his ID to show it to the Officer standing guard. "enforcer ben Heinline, escorting the resident to try to find a missing perp."

"Go on ahead we were told to expect you ben. All forensics personnel have been withdrawn until you personally say it is clear. There are Officers or enforcers at all entrances to both buildings. ben Heinline go On-duty, and Civillian Protection Protocols." 

ben drew his conventional pistol. "Understood Ma'am, I will protect her with lethal force, and risk to my own life if required."

We went into my office and michael's Notepad was sitting on my desk. I picked it up and walked back out to the hall. "Okay ben, to the basement. Where I am about to take you is our secret. Very few people outside of the Alphons and Hodlar Families know about it. It has been there much longer then we have lived here, although I have updated the security of it since we lived here."

"What is it some sort of torture chamber?" He laughed.

"It used to be."

ben stopped dead in his tracks. "You are not joking are you?" I shake my head no. "Wow I have heard rumors of the kind but never seen one. Do you take michael into it."

"I have relegated all punishments to occur only in there. I had to use it more for liz then I did for michael. But I was never cruel ben. To be honest we have used it more as a sexual recreation then for punishment. A little game of dominance and control. With a little pain thrown in for spice."

"Well I will let you in on a little secret too, there is nothing illegal about these rooms as long as the person is not being abusive. Or using a Re-ed chamber."

"Well it came with one, but after I discovered what it was I had michael disable it and destroy its control computer. Now it is just used as a storage room."

We stood outside the room and he stared at me. "Cripes. I never heard that, and will not see it."

I smiled at him. "Thanks, now let's see if our intruder is in there." I place the Notepad to the wall, since it is michael's it requested my override. I press the code and the screen shows the active cameras. Sitting just inside the door is a Female I recognized holding a pistol in her lap. "She's in there alright; let's see what she has been up to." I access the playback computer and start today's recording. We watch as she entered, then wandered about the room, as if checking to make sure nobody else is around. Finally she approached the recording room door and tried to open it. When it refused, she went back to the door into the hall and met with the same problem. I check the time stamp. "When did the email go out from the panic room?"

"About 1215 hours, we had left the precinct at 1200 hours."

"michael accidently trapped her; she came in at 12:06 and tried to access the recording room at 12:18. When he activated the panic room it also locked both of these doors to keep out intruders. She must have came straight here after they broke in."

We watched her struggle to open the door manually, and then try the recording room again. Eventually she gave up and just kept herself and her gun ready for the hall door to open. I switched back to live feed to see her pacing again.

"Are you ready ben?"

"What's the plan?"

"You're going to love this. Start your recorder." I pressed a few keys and spoke into the 'pad's mic. "Put the gun down and step away from the door."

She looked around. "Just let me go bitch, I've already destroyed all the recordings so you will never have any leverage over us."

"The fact I am talking to you this way tells me that's a lie. Now put down the gun and walk over to the self stocks. I believe you know how they work. If you do not do as instructed I will be forced to just leave you locked in there."

"My associates will be here in minutes, they will have the boy and then you will..."

"You mean the one who was at the van, or the one that you sent to steal my son from the hospital? They're both well secured, oh and muscle-girl won't be helping anyone anymore after her run in with michael."

"What have you done with them? My Grandmother knows we're here, likely she has already arranged someone to extract me."

"Yes you should thank her for that; it was that action that made me realize you were here. Of course we gave them the body of muscle-girl and told them we had no clue where you or the others ran to after that happened. Now all I will have to do is wait until you are too weak or tired to resist You got five seconds before I go and get my dinner."

She used as much of the five seconds as she could before pressing the button securing herself. "Good I'm glad you decided to be helpful Mary. It is Mary yes?"

"Yes." She practically spat out the word.

I punched in the unlock code and the door lock disengaged. I swung the door open. "There you go enforcer ben, one prepackaged perpetrator, with confession of breaking and entry, attempted kidnapping, and conspiracy."

"You tricked me!"

"Turn about is fair play, you tricked me into leaving so you can raid my home."

"This is my Grandmother's home; she will get it back one way or another."

"Not according to the City of New York. How do I get her out of this contraption?"

"You may want to secure one of her wrists and hold on."

After I released her, ben quickly had her secured and escorted her out to a waiting Officer. He also turned over his recorder tape of the confession.

Epilogue:

I had not realized how sore I was still. All this manual labor would have killed me if I had done it myself. 

"Thank you for helping me move these boxes ben, I did not know Mother Alli had so much stuff."

"No problem kid, with Miss Lisa still on desk duty, all I can do is escort prisoners to and fro. I was glad to get away from that for a day. I cannot wait for her arm to heal up so she can recertify on the weapon range. You sure you got it from here, I saw your clutching your ribs earlier."

"Yeah, I will be good, this box is light."&nbsp; I shook my head "I will be helping her unpack for a month I don't know where she fit all that stuff in her little apartment. I just hope she adjusts to living here well, I do not want to move her back out."

"You need the help, and an extra set of eyes on your back. The Alphons family is not happy that the Judge and Mary are in prison after their failed attempts to get little michael. Who would have thought they would try to kidnap him to sell him on the black market. Where are the Females anyway?"

"Miss Justine told me she and Miss Allison had a special thank you planned for me, and they were going to prepare it."

"Maybe they are making you a special dinner?"

"In that case I hope it is Miss Allison doing the preparing! I still want to live."

"Is your Owner's cooking that bad."

"Do not tell her I said this, but almost"

He laughed "I better get out of here before I cause a domestic disturbance."

"Drive safe."

"Always!"

The Female folk had been oddly quiet. The whole house was too quiet, with the children at Miss Amanda and carlos's home tonight, it felt empty.

I set the final box on Miss Allison's bed, where a folded note sat with my name on it.

I read the note; it was instructions from Milady to report to the room. I half expected this. Evidently Miss Justine decided to let her Mother in on our secret. I was sure by now Mother Alli or Doctor Cherish had told Miss Justine about my attempt at running away and Mother Alli would see first hand the purpose of the room.

When I entered from the hall I was not greeted by the sight I expected. Miss Justine and Allison were both naked and each secured into one of the devices. Miss Justine was in the self stocks with a ball gag in her mouth. Mother Alli was on one of the gynecological style chairs. This particular one just held its occupant down at the ankles and waist with the hands secured by leather cuffs and chains to the leg supports. She was blindfolded and had a ring gag in her mouth. If I had my guess she also had in earplugs as she had not even reacted to the door opening and closing.

Miss Justine looked at me with a smile in her eyes. Then she looked at a note she held in her left hand. Her eyes said 'Read it'. I took it from her hand and opened it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; michael,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mother is offering herself to you to use as you see fit, an
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; apology for her treatment of our son
. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just ask you follow the rules I set for you to use with liz
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You no longer need to worry about using a condom, and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you may ejaculate in her all you can.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But please save some for me, When you have Mother
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sufficiently worn out it is my turn. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will both be your property to use, please refrain from
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; calling us Miss or Mother when addressing us at this time.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have your fun my Love, you deserve it!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Justine

"Really?" She answered me with a nod. "And your Mother is fine with this?" Another nod.

I walk away to one of the wall shelves and gather some supplies. I slide a vibrating penis in my love's intimate area and turn it on low. "That is to get you ready for me, don't drop it or I may need to get a paddle. This is to keep you from getting distracted." I reached over and slid a blindfold on her. She resisted and tried to stop me. "Ahh, did Justine want to watch as I take her bound Mother?"

She nodded her head. "I cannot allow that, one disapproving look from you and I would stop and deny myself the reward I have been offered. And I bet you want to hear what I am going to do too?" Another nod. "Sorry I think we need a little privacy." I pushed the rolled ear plugs in and waited for them to expand. She tried to turn her head to stop me, but I had been too fast.

I gently brushed Miss Justine's nipples, drawing a moan from her, and walked away.

Miss Allison was now my target. She jerked at my touch. I leaned close to her ear, and held her hand. "If you can hear me squeeze my hand." When she did that I continued; "You are my property now, did you know that?" She nodded. I got into my role and tried to use more vulgar terms. "You probably did not know this, but I got a lot of practice fucking a bound woman down here. I tormented lizzie down here often, she began to feel excited every time we sent her here, hoping it would result in her cumming." I cringed at using those terms out loud. "Are you ready to experience all I learned from her torment?" She hesitated, but nodded her head. "I hope you know what you are doing Allison, that was your only chance to get me to stop." She howled through her gag as I twisted her nipple."

I took a quick taste of her wet vagina, it sounded like she tried to say 'more' through her open mouth. I wonder if Allison has ever had a cock in her mouth. I am willing to bet that was Milady's intent with that particular gag.

I resolved myself to be as demanding an owner as I could, but still ensure the pleasure of the two beautiful Females who have put themseves at my mercy..
