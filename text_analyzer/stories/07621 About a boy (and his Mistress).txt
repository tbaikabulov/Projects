Synopsis: 






CHAPTER I: The Arrival 

It was completely dark outside, an almost moonless night, as he walked up to the front door at the prescribed time standing intrepidly before ringing the bell to announce himself. Her request that he arrive barefoot, wearing only his pajama bottoms and a t-shirt caused him to shiver and had caused his his nipples to harden rub against his shirt when his feet hit the cold cement on the path to Her door. 

She had also instructed that he arrive with the black plug that was Her favorite inserted deeply into his ass. She knew that the oversized ring sticking out put extra pressure on his prostate when he was sitting -- and that the car vibrations would have amplified that. His mind strayed to how it felt as he drove over, vibrating with the car's engine, pressing deep into his ass, making him excited and ready for her. He blushed in shame thinking how much he enjoyed her command over him. 

His thoughts turned to Her and the familiar feeling of anxiety and excitement began to spread through his body. His Mistress -- Mistress Harmony, so aptly named for all the different yet equal parts of Her personality ... Her balance of patience and impatience; kindness and cruelness; empathy and the need to humiliate him. He was ready for whatever game She had in mind for him tonight and he shivered as he reached out and pushed the bell, his thick cock already starting to throb.

Moments later he heard the clicking of high heels on the Terrazzo floor and the door, with the chain still on it, opened a few inches; a pale hand with long fingers and a perfect french manicure told him that it was Her as She reached through and held out a white business envelope. No words were said as he took it and the hand was quickly withdrawn and the door clicked shut firmly. He heard the sound of the chain being taken off and then the echo of her high heels retreating. 

Looking down at the envelope in his hands, he saw his name written in her familiar script across the front. He brought it to his nose and inhaled her lingering scent on it. His heart beat quickened as he turned it over and wished desperately that She had sealed it so that he might lick the place where her tongue had touched it, disappointed that the flap was only tucked in. 

Finally he opened it and pulled out a slim single page with a neatly typed note. Stepping closer to the dim light doorway light he stood quietly, shivering, shifting on his feet, reading. 


 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Thank you for being prompt and dressed appropriately. I assume that you are wearing your plug as directed and that of course, pleases me greatly; if you are not, I expect a full explanation and we will discuss that at a later time. Your instructions are below. Follow them to the letter or ... . Always, my beloved pet, remember how much I love you and I hope you enjoy what I have planned for you tonight.

7) Open the box and put on each of the following you will find inside: a set of ear plugs, a set of wrist cuffs, a set of ankle cuffs and the chastity cage for that beautiful cock of yours.
