Last night, I dreamed of a black horse. Upon waking, I looked
      in the dictionary of dreams I keep in my bedside table, to see if there
      is any significance to this particular night time vision. It seems a dream
      of a black horse is a dream of passion. Considering all that has happened
      in the past weeks, I am not surprised.  
 
Chapter 1: The Marriage  
It started a few weeks ago � at least it was a few weeks for me. History itself
  has stretched itself thin in that time so that I must commence my tale hundreds
  of years ago. I had just turned 17. My father was the Earl of the Dairmaid
  Clan and thought it propitious to seek greater political security via my marriage.
  I did not resent my father, whom I loved and trusted implicitly, since the
  husband he had chosen for me was a fine young man, most striking in appearance,
  and highly agreeable in nature.  
We were married a week after my birthday. As was the custom, I moved to his
  castle on the night of my marriage. In those days a wife was little more than
  her husband's property. If she refuses, he is quite within his rights to force
  himself upon her with all the righteous violence he deems appropriate. I was
  warned of my duty by my mother that morning and knew what that night's fate
  would be. In the bedchamber, with hands shaking, I fumbled with my laces and
  slowly undressed in front of him. Finally, so tentatively, I stepped out of
  the last of my undergarments. For a fleeting moment I looked up at his eyes.
  There was a strange glinting desire within them as his gaze soaked up the smooth
  soft skin around my breasts, my flat stomach, the space between my thighs.
  I waited, breathing heavily, terrified. Nothing happened. I thought I must
  be doing something wrong. Remembering myself, and the advice of the morning,
  I lay on the bed, my hands above me holding the wood of the headboard, my legs
  crudely apart. I closed my eyes, hoping the pain would be bearable. A minute
  went by in silence. Eventually it was broken by his words, spoken meekly, almost
  in shame. He knelt next to me on the bed and softly said,  
�Mary, God has melted our two souls divinely together. And as my wife I honour
  and respect you above all others. I can see the fear in your eyes and feel
  saddened that you should assume I can be that cruel, so routed in ways rejected
  many years past. I swear on this clan, on everything I hold sacred, that I
  will never willingly hurt you. You must believe me. Do you believe me?�  
I nodded with a wide, grateful smile, and kissed him on the cheek. He began
  ever so tenderly to stroke my naked body from head to foot. On one level the
  sensations were pleasing to a mild degree. However, the core of my being felt
  somehow neutral, detached. He noticed this too, suggested patience. But 15
  minutes later there was little progress and I was still a maiden. Kindly, he
  told me we would try again the next night. I insisted he take me how he liked,
  that I was not a real wife otherwise, but he would not hear of it. He told
  me it would be as if he were violating the virgin Mary herself!  
Seven nights in a row he tried to please me, but each time I felt the merest
  hint of pleasure from my body, but my mind was dead to his touch. Always, there
  was the kind acceptance of my lack of readiness, the gentle request for patience,
  and the hint of resentment. I felt deeply angry with myself for letting my
  dear husband down. I began to wonder if there was anything amiss inside me.
  Was I defective in some way?  
Chapter 2: The Book  
As time went on, a gnawing emptiness grew within me � a feeling I couldn't
  explain. I needed to escape for a while, to think about all that had happened.
  I exclaimed to dear William that I missed my family and he let me ride alone
  to their estate.  
A few days into my stay I happened to frequent the library. The library's
  collection was far too numerous for me to read in a lifetime. In fact, I suspected
  that there was more than a thousand ancient texts in there that my father had
  not even perused. Filled with a tired melancholy I took to browsing a dusty
  shelf in the corner. As if it somehow called to me, my fingers found a strange
  tomb without a title on the spine. It was caked in dust, but when I wiped this
  off, still there was no title. When I opened it, the first page simply read, �The
  book of desires and dreams.� Beside this on the right was a cunningly thin
  binding, entitled, �The book of desires� while in the middle of the book, almost
  deceitfully hidden, was a further cover, called �The book of dreams�. I turned
  to the very front of the tomb again. There were indeed no words, but a faint
  picture was there. I could have sworn it was blank before. I looked more closely
  at the picture, wiping away the last of the dust. I almost dropped the book
  in fright. It was � I couldn't believe it! In my father's castle? It was obscene,
  blasphemous, hideous. And yet, I couldn't take my eyes off it. There was a
  beautiful woman on the cover in remarkable detail. Her clothes were hanging
  in tatters so that not one inch of her modesty remained. She was bound tightly
  in chains, her arms painfully locked behind her. She was standing, but forced
  forwards. Behind her was� was� I could hardly bear to look. Behind her was
  this monstrous figure. It was black and red, some creature obviously from the
  depths of hell. It looked like a black horse, but had three heads, each with
  the devil's horns. One head had large fangs that were biting and twisting at
  the maiden's shoulder. The second was laughing insanely at her embarrassing
  lack of cover. And the last head seemed to be revelling in power and control,
  as it grasped in its teeth the chains around her wrist, pulling her mightily
  towards it, pulling her inward. She was impaled on his massive member. But
  despite the strangely perfect detail of her face, I couldn't quite ascertain
  whether she was in absolute torment or within the throws of ecstacy. There
  were tears of dejection, but there was also a smile of delight.  
That night, I examined the book more closely. All the pages of The Book of
  Desires were blank � except the first. It read, �Through the exploration of
  desires comes self-knowledge. Explore your desires inside me, set forth the
  greatest of fires inside your soul, and learn.� Beside these words, was a picture
  of a quill beginning to write. The message was clear, but I was afraid even
  to think of a desire. Surely I had stumbled across a trinket of Satan. I turned
  to the start of the second book, the book of dreams, which had these words: �Once
  you've explored your deepest desires, they will strip away artifice from your
  being. Your dreams will be pure and their meaning in here will liberate you
  from ignorance of your nature.� Within the book at regular intervals and in
  order, were the letters of the alphabet, but between them nothing.  
I slept that night in a state of near panic, and at dawn the following day
  I rode back to my husband. Although my first inclination was to destroy this
  strange book, something compelled me to stow it with me as I travelled. A single
  thought saved the book: I had no idea who I really was.  
As I rode, my mind drifted. For the first time in my life, I began to question
  certain details. There was a spark of desire, a hint of life that was my own,
  not my parents or my heritage or my culture. When I had expected my husband
  to take me by force, there was a ripple of excitement amidst the fear. But
  it dissipated with his gentility and had not returned until� until I saw the
  shocking cover of that book. What was happening to me? How could I even think
  such disgusting thoughts? I put them out of my mind.  
A few days later, William tried again with me. I didn't know quite how to
  broach the subject, but asked him to try to be forceful, manly, brutal - for
  me not for him. I couldn't explain why, and he didn't understand. Instead he
  appeared shocked, and told me that he was a true Christian and could never,
  not even for a moment, contemplate such barbarity. He left quickly, and I felt
  horribly embarrassed, as I lay there alone.  
Tentatively, I picked up the tomb that I had stashed under my pillow and opened
  to the first fresh page. Everyone around me was so devout, so pure, so full
  of warmth and care, but it caused me to feel stifled. I daren't write such
  things though. It was so un-Christian of me that I felt my cheeks burn with
  guilt. But no one was in my room and if I kept the book very secret� I picked
  up the quill ever so carefully, thought for a moment, and with a reticent pleasure
  that I used to feel when performing mischief as a young child, I wrote: �I
  wish to live in less innocent times.�  
Chapter3: The Release of the Marquis  
Before the ink had a chance to dry, I felt ever so dizzy and the room became
  blurred and mis-shapen. A moment later I found myself bound to the ceiling
  by my wrists in a dungeon. My feet, tied wide, were stretching me to the floor.
  All my limbs were about to dislocate � or at least that was how it felt. What
  dark magic was this? Was I dreaming? What had happened to me? Had the devil
  via that horrid book stolen me to Hell? Indeed, I blurted out automatically, �Am
  I in Hell?� to which a middle-aged man beside me replied,  
�Bien sur, mademoiselle.�  
It was a foreign tongue, but strangely I understood the words as if they were
  my own. He continued, eyeing me up and down with a leer that made me uncomfortable,  
�Why else would they have let me out the Bastille!�  
�Who are you? What am I doing � �  
�Ah yes, in my haste to bind you to my quaint lair, I have been most rude.
  Let me formally introduce myself: I am the Marquis de Sade, recently liberated
  by the revolution.�  
Somehow, without any experience, knowledge of these times came to me. The
  year was 1789. A powerful and bloody revolution had overturned France and rattled
  the whole of the civilised world. A new, liberal animal was being born. Prostitutes
  of every description covered the streets like a carpet, bearing their breasts,
  enticing men into their beds, allowing their customers to take them in every
  hole, even whip them, as long as they paid. And I was one particularly young,
  new member of this popular profession. Such revelations calmed me slightly,
  but the knowledge of who exactly the Marquis was more than countered this,
  making me quiver against the ropes.  
�You really do have a fabulous bosom, my dear - not at all the weathered,
  sagging tits of the usual whores around here. And your believable look of innocence
  causes the blood to surge into my cock. Now, as is my chief pleasure, I am
  going to hurt you repeatedly, intensely for hours. Then, when I can bear the
  pleasure on my cock no longer, I will give you a special treat by cutting you
  down and fucking you in the arse till the blood gushes from that sweet hole.�  
�Please sir, please let me go� I begged him as I continued to shudder with
  abject terror. He laughed at this.  
�Don't you realise your pleas will only make my cock harder? But I'm in a
  generous mood today, and besides, there is something about you that intrigues
  me. So I will offer you this gem of advice. Pleasure can be mined from many
  raw sources, even intense torture. If you open your soul to the experience,
  perhaps you will enjoy tonight more than I. To me, it matters not.� At this,
  he picked up the cruellest device I'd ever seen. It was a long single whip,
  but across the surface was peppered round, sharp metal studs. Surely this would
  tear me to death!  
He soaked the whip in vinegar for a moment as I stared transfixed at this
  studded snake. Slowly, almost lazily, he moved behind me. After what seemed
  like a century, I heard a sharp crack, found my whole body jolt forwards against
  the ropes, let out an ear piercing scream and then a split second later absolute
  agony filled every corner of my mind. I felt my behind dripping with what must
  have been blood. The pain only slightly subsided after nearly a minute of inactivity.
  I was shaking uncontrollably, wimpering.  
�I think 20 lashes should be a good round number, don't you think? But don't
  worry, I won't neglect you after that. The burning irons will be next. You
  are going to know pain more intimately in the next hour than most embrace in
  a lifetime, my innocent whore.� I could hear the faint swish of the lash behind
  me, then another thwack as it hit the middle of my back. I almost passed out
  at the shearing, tearing feeling screaming from my new wound. The Marquis paused
  once more, stroking himself manically as he came to view my face. I closed
  my eyes, trying desperately to block the pain from my mind. It was no use.
  Instead, I concentrated deeply on my experience, trying to dissolve it by force
  of will. And it was at this precise moment that I detected something else,
  something that had been brewing within me from the start, but which only now
  was creeping into my consciousness. There was a tingling, exciting feeling
  of pleasure running through my body. And it was steadily growing. What was
  causing it? Was it the pain itself, the humiliation of my open nudity, or the
  understanding that I was dominated absolutely? I did not know, and was indeed
  rather sickened that I could have such thoughts, but amidst this cave of torments,
  this hopeless situation, it was the only positive experience to attach myself
  to. So I did.  
The third stroke hit the tops of my thighs. The next few returned to my bottom,
  as the Marquis began to put his utmost strength into the evil endeavour. The
  pain was maddening, as was the horror that my flesh was being ripped, destroyed
  by this madman. But the pleasure was starting to do battle with the pain. I
  found I could centre on this instead, and was thrilled amidst my fear. Could
  it subsume the rest? For the sake of my sanity I had to find out. The Marquis
  held out the whip, tickled my tender breasts with it for minutes on end, making
  it very clear what was coming next. Then the studded whip descended with full
  force upon my right breast. It hit above the nipple, splitting the flesh, causing
  it to ooze blood. But to the surprise of both the Marquis and myself, I let
  out a loud sigh of delight. The pain was spreading ecstacy throughout me. When
  I looked down now at my ravaged bosom, it excited me, it made my vagina ache
  with a longing for contact.  
�Lash it again,� I whispered breathlessly, feeling suddenly liberated, empowered
  that I could be giving him orders.  
�You truly are a wondrous sight, my girl. A kindred spirit, if I may be so
  bold.� He duly obeyed me, forcing the whip on my right breast again, this time
  splitting the hard, erect nipple. The pain and fear had completely disappeared
  by now. I didn't understand it, hardly understood anything of my situation.
  All I knew, all I experienced was the raw, sexual pleasure washing over me
  in waves.  
�Again!� I screamed. He turned his attentions to the other breast, attempting
  a symmetry of destruction. I was rising higher and higher now, my body shaking
  for different reasons.  
�Between my legs! Between my legs,� I ordered with a fanatical impatience.
  The single contact of the vinegar-soaked leather, and those gorgeous metal
  studs caused a violent climax. It was as if my body were in a seizure. I shook
  all over, screaming in pleasure, for what was nearly a minute, but the minute
  seemed to hang in the air for eternity. And then I passed out.  
I was running down a hill near my childhood castle, and as I bolted over the
  grass, my clothes slowly dissolved. In front of me was a glorious Highlands
  scene � full of mist and lochs and ragged mountains tipped in snow. But as
  I descended and as I gradually shed my garments, the lakes, hills and valleys
  became buildings. The buildings began as small, simple abodes. But they mutated,
  steadily stretching to the sky � great monuments of glass and bricks. As I
  ran closer to the foot of the valley, the buildings thrust through the clouds,
  their shape growing more and more elaborate. Eventually, they became a bizarre
  double helical structure. I stopped, surrounded by them, and found these fantastic,
  powerful constructions twisted and curled their way towards me. Each was tipped
  by the head of a penis. The encircled me, roughly, yet affectionately embracing
  me, causing me equal quantities of pain and pleasure. The tips of all these
  gargantuan buildings converged on my vagina. I no longer felt empty. I then
  woke up with a start.  
A faint blue dawn light was streaming through the open door at the top of
  the dungeon. It took me a while to remember where I was. But the sensation
  of cold metal of a chain around my neck jolted me back to reality. Although
  my whole body ached from my wounds, and I was a prisoner of a sadist, his paintoy,
  I was actually happy, excited, relaxed. As I looked around the dank, dirty
  dungeon, I noticed a book lying beside me. It was THE book. Immediately, impatiently,
  I opened the second half. What would it be under? I tried �B� for �building� and
  found a perfect description of my dream. There followed an interpretation: �You
  have chosen time as your means of knowledge. You are learning fast. Pain and
  pleasure are indeed the mirror foundations for all human actions. But wisdom
  is far from your grasp. These times cannot adequately teach you the rest.�  
I contemplated these words, and understand the implicit suggestion. A quill
  was lying beside the book. Without hesitating, I turned to the first half of
  the book. I found an empty page, and wrote: �I wish to be dominated.�  
Chapter4: Nazi Treatment  
� Hergekommen, j&uuml;disches Schwein!� I was surrounded by men in uniform.  
I was completely naked except for a set of numbers branded onto my arm, and
  a collar that read �Jewish Whore�. This time, though, no ropes or chains held
  me. They weren't needed. I was crawling on the ground towards the officer in
  charge.  
�Faster, you stupid Jew-cow!� He bellowed. I sped up. Once I was in reach,
  he grabbed my left nipple (the hair on my head had been completely removed
  for �hygiene� reasons). He spoke quietly, though menacingly to me, �You rotten
  fucking Jew animal. You have a chance for a whole loaf of bread if you behave
  this evening. I happen to know that you haven't had a bite to eat in three
  days. Too busy being fucked 24 hours a day in the Auschwitz brothel, haven't
  you? How does it feel to be so very popular to the very soldiers that killed
  your family?� He laughed, twisting my nipple around as he did so. I winced
  in pain and grief. �And if you disobey, whore,� he smiled at me with mock sweetness, �then
  you will die tonight along with ten girls of my choosing.� He turned to the
  main group of officers, suddenly completely ignoring me.  
�Listen here, men,� he continued, though more loudly now, �We've had a productive
  day in the chambers, and you deserve a bit of a show for a reward.� He lifted
  me up by pinching my nipple fiercely between finger and thumb and raising his
  arm. I stood there passively, staring at the ground. �I have here the prettiest
  Jew-whore in the camp � which isn't saying much of course. And she's going
  to show us just what Jews are good for. God I hate Jews! All a bunch of scientists,
  artists and bankers! I tell you now � civilisation is not built on such things � they
  are pointless, dragging us insidiously away from greatness. No, military might,
  the power of the gun � that is all that matters. Survival of the fittest, am
  I right? And our Motherland is therefore truly great!� Cheers erupted around
  me. �Now to demonstrate what a particularly low animal Jews are, this stupid
  gob of spittle will obey you gentleman in every regard. Remember, for those
  of you who are married, fucking a Jew doesn't count. You can still remain faithful
  while spewing your semen as deep up her crack as you can go. I'll start, shall
  I? Now, putrid Jew-animal: I'm an Arian and I'm in charge here, so as I walk
  down this room you will kiss and lick the floor at each place I've put my foot.
  Then you will lick my boots as if I'm a God.� The floor was filthy, it even
  stank, but what choice did I have? I obeyed him as some soldiers around me
  laughed, others kicked my arse as I crawled past, and still more chatted away,
  completely uninterested in what was happening to me. I felt nauseous, not just
  for the smell, but because my whole sense of self was being destroyed, it seemed.
  I was a nothing, a worthless animal to these men.  
The next soldier, more out of curiosity than anything else, ordered me to
  hold his sweaty, rank erect penis in my throat until I passed out. As I was
  slapped awake, I felt his ejaculate surge onto my face. I was ordered to keep
  it there for the whole night and beyond. Another soldier, with an evil glint
  in his eye, handed me a cigarette and ordered me to extinguish it in my vagina.
  I winced, but nevertheless used one hand to open up my labia while the other
  pushed the burning stick deep into me. I screamed in pain, but somehow the
  first sound of my own voice, along with the agony, awoke something in me. Memories
  of the Marquis came back to me � as did his advice. Perhaps I could preserve
  myself in the same way again. Could I feed off this submission, learn to soak
  up the sensation of being worthless as if it were foreplay? Again, I was desperate,
  and again I was intrigued to discover new territory. The soldier relit the
  cigarette and simply said, �Now your arse.� With a glint in my eye, I inserting
  the cigarette and as it burned my rectum; I smiled in pleasure at him.  
Another soldier ordered me to kneel so that he could have a convenient footrest.
  He dug his muddy boots into my back and reclined. At the same time, I was to
  lower my breasts into a bed of nails he'd had another girl bring. I had to
  produce blood or he would be angry. Other soldiers grew excited by this view,
  and took to forming a queue by my face and cunt. If I didn't manically use
  my tongue, or take the penis as far down my throat as possible while grinding
  my pussy against their cocks, that would count as disobedience. I was blindfolded,
  so that I couldn't see who or what was being forced into my holes. I could
  only smell the filthy dicks, and feel them thrust into my mouth, pussy and
  arse. The knowledge that a group of hateful, ignorant, racist strangers was
  taking me in any way they saw fit, while I was forced to aid them, began to
  send a heat through my mind again. There was something horribly delicious about
  how I was being treated, how low I had fallen. I was the Jew plaything of these
  brutish soldiers, worse than a slave. Such thoughts made my pussy drip with
  desire. As dicks caused me to gag, as they battered my cervix, that hot desire
  turned to orgasm after orgasm. I don't know if the soldiers recognised this,
  but I felt saved, liberated, invulnerable. Whatever they did to me now I would
  enjoy �they could rape every hole I had for hours, days, but I would feed off
  every moment, would want more. My consent would ebb and flow with their cruel
  demands as if I were a leaf on a babbling brook. While a stone might drown,
  the leaf will float forever.  
True to the colonel's word, four hours and nearly a hundred rapes later he
  provided me with a loaf of bread, sprinkled as crumbs on the soil all the way
  from the officers' comfortable barracks to my brothel's shed. I was only to
  use my tongue to fetch the specks of food. However, he didn't stop me from
  touching my cunt as I ate my muddy line of a meal, and I came four more times
  before I reached my bed. I felt satisfied and sane. He had not won. I and MY
  race were stronger than this Nazi scum could ever be.  
This time the dream came almost as soon as I lay on my bed. All manner of
  creatures surrounded me. They fought each other. Almost every time, the larger,
  stronger ones vanquished those smaller. Then they came to take their prize,
  with massive penises at the ready. I had no choice but to submit, though the
  power of their strength and victory aroused me greatly. After the sex, the
  next generation of blindly fighting animals would emerge from my vagina, fighting
  even before they were free from me. This continued for many generations, creating
  larger and larger monsters. Eventually, I grew tired of this cycle, but I didn't
  know how to stop the ever stronger monsters ravaging me. And soon they would
  be too big for me, destroying me completely. I was afraid it would somehow
  be my fault if the last generation perished with me.  
As soon as I woke up, I looked for the book. It was dutifully by my side.
  I knew to look up �A� for �animal�. The dream, as I knew it would be, was there,
  followed by the usual enigmatic interpretation: �You have now learnt evolution,
  which favours the strong. You're drawn to the mightiest, those that dominate
  their peers and force you to submit, to cower under their superiority. These
  are the fittest to help transfer your essence across the generations. But the
  strongest are no better in value than the weakest. Both are blind products
  of a blind process. What value do you really possess?�  
Again, the book seemed to tap the deepest questions in my mind, anticipating
  my next request. Wishing desperately to escape from this time, I wrote, �I
  wish to be humiliated.�  
Chapter5: The Value of Sex  
It was a well lit, wide alleyway. I was wearing a mini-skirt and cum-stained
  tank-top. I was also bare foot, standing in a stale puddle. I knew the year
  to be 2014, and I was on a two year contract with a large, muscular pimp who
  was possessively squeezing my right arm. In just those two years, I would make
  more than enough money to get me through medical school. But if I disobeyed
  my pimp in a situation that wasn't life-threatening to me, then the contract
  could end and I'd lose all my money. I had just one month to go, and he was
  trying his best to make sure I didn't get a cent.  
�Well, skank, you're on your 3 rd warning now, after refusing to suck off
  that old man who had that interesting dick with all those worts and sores.
  So tonight is punishment night, baby, and it's gonna be great � well great
  for me �coz I'm gonna make a shit load a' money. And our members at NYFuckmeat79.com
  are gonna love this. Millions online are gonna watch you be a slave to 50 o'
  the dirtiest, roughest down-and-out bums around. And look up there.� He pointed
  to a balcony above the alleyway, populated by a large group of people. �They
  are your whole high school class, here to enjoy the show, and laugh at just
  what you are prepared to do for a few bucks. Why don't you wave at them.� I
  obeyed, already feeling a thrill at the sense of shame, and being defined as
  simply a cheap whore.  
I was given some music and had to strip sexily in front of all those tramps,
  as if they were 1000-dollar clients. When I was naked, one ordered me to keep
  very still, kneeling down on a dirty mat. My lips and eyes were to remain wide
  open at all times, although I was allowed occasionally to swallow, as long
  as I swallowed everything that was in my mouth. The 50 bums took turns spitting
  at me and cumming over me. At regular intervals, I was prompted to ask for
  more spit and sperm. After just 10 minutes, my whole face, hair and tits were
  covered in a wall of putrid slime. It felt wonderful. I was getting so turned
  on by the mixture of rank tastes, by the bitter sting in my eyes. When they
  all urinated on me to wash it off, I had my first orgasm as I tasted a combination
  of 10 different vile salty piss-drinks at the same time.  
�Well, if you like piss so much, cumbucket-whore, we have a special treat
  for you.� At this, he dragged me by the hair to a corner of the alley, where
  there was a bucket that was obviously a makeshift toilet for these bums. �This
  has a month's shit and piss, just for you. Why don't you dunk your head in
  it.� I looked at the revolting mixture, smelled the rancid odour, gazed up
  at the high-school crowd and the cameras and instinctively craved to show them
  how disgusting, how worthless I actually was. With my fingers automatically
  rubbing my nipples and clit, I dunked my head completely below the water and
  held it there for nearly a minute. One of the bums pulled me out with a twisted
  look of digust on his face. He handed me a filthy glass, with some cigarette
  stumps encased on the bottom. I knew what to do. Furiously sticking my fingers
  up my cunt now, I grabbed a generous glass-full of the mixture and drank it
  down. My stomach rebelled at taking such a horrid mixture, though, and I vomited
  it onto the ground. I was told to lick it up. I started to do this, then found
  a surprise behind me. A large Alsatian with a coat matted with bits of rubbish
  was being positioned so that he could mount me. I felt his paws on my back,
  and didn't object. In fact, I was amazed to find myself in heaven at this pistoning
  dog-cock inside my cunt. I found licking up my own vomit with even more vigour
  hastened and enhanced my climax. I screamed and screamed in ecstasy as the
  jeers of my high school peers drifted down to my ears.  
After the toilet bucket was kicked to the floor and I was given far more to
  lick up, ten more tramp's dogs turned up to fuck me � sometimes in the arse
  and sometimes in the cunt, always with their paws scraping at my back. Then
  the bums took their turn. A money box was put next to me and each bum paid
  a dime to fuck me. I was only double arse-fucked, and then the pair would take
  it in turns to choke me with their shit-cum covered filthy dicks. They wouldn't
  stop until the dicks were completely clean again. All 50 took me this way,
  each for a dime, though some complained that I wasn't worth that much. I lost
  count of the times I climaxed that night.  
Eventually, they left me in a heap in the corner and went to get some food.
  Exhausted, yet perversely satisfied, I drifted to sleep. The dream this time
  was simpler. I had erected the most beautiful nude statue of myself in gold
  and diamonds. It had taken years, and eventually it was up for auction to the
  highest bidder. I felt brave to show every detail, every blemish on my body
  to the world and thought that would elevate the price further. However, not
  a single bid was made.  
As soon as I woke, I flicked in the dictionary to �S� for Statue and read
  the interpretation: �Value, whether monetary, or in terms of self-worth is
  illusory. Within you is the essence of this truth. Sexual humiliation is revelling
  in a valueless perception. There is only one sense of worth imposed on nature
  that has any truth � and you are its supreme proponent. You need to find a
  world that agrees with this fact.�  
But how could I ever fit in, how could such desires as my own create companionship,
  respect? Feeling melancholy and tired of these vicious lessons, I wrote, �I
  want to feel at home.�  
Chapter6: The Virtual Queen  
I was in a penthouse apartment, looking down on a vast city. In the distance,
  I could see a gigantic poster of some woman, advertising the Dream Game. It
  took me a while to realise it was me. Then the new world hit my consciousness
  in a rush. I had fallen much further into the future. BDSM-ers were now revered,
  placed above other members of society. They were found to be high-iq, cultured,
  deeply creative � and every genius that ever had been was found to be a member
  of this special sexual club. It was a lifestyle that vanillas envied for its
  status and sexual variety. Sex itself was now the most respected pastime in
  a world that embraced this as the most honest expression of our nature. It
  was concluded we have no other fundamental purpose - and submissives epitomise
  that universal truth. I was a Polymorphic Submissive � a rare and special woman.
  For my sexual tastes I was made famous and wealthy. Men paid millions simply
  for an afternoon with me in the Dream Game, and came away satisfied.  
Had I arrived? Was this my ultimate home, my final lesson? I had to check.
  It was already night. I lay on my enormous bed, feeling more comfortable and
  safe under the soft sheets than I'd done in weeks. I dreamt I was a white mare,
  galloping through time, chased by a large black stud. I couldn't outrun him,
  and eventually succumbed to being mounted.  
My dictionary of dreams simply says a black horse signifies passion. But I
  don't need any further explanations now.  
I have time for a quick session before breakfast. With quiet glee, I slip
  a metal cap over my scalp, and enter the Dream Game. I find myself naked, my
  skin shimmering silver, as I'm tightly tethered in the middle of a vast, glittering
  sphere. Four creatures approach me, each with a pair of biting, salivating
  3 foot long snakes for penises. They have enormous clawed hands with sandpaper
  for skin. Their faces are the faces of real men, though, and I detect respect
  - even love - excitement, and sadistic lust. With the first violent touch,
  my vagina becomes a fluorescent blue river. I have found my home�
