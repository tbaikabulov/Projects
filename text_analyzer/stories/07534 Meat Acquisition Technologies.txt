Meat Acquisition Technologies

ï¿½ Spitman March 19, 2008

It was early when the limousine cruised up to the main entrance of the factory, and the chauffeur opened the door for his passenger.

&#8216;Thank you, Harry,&#8217; the passenger told him graciously.

&#8216;It was my pleasure, Mr Wang. I will be here when you are ready to leave.&#8217;

Li looked around. From the outside, the main building looked like an aircraft hanger, with an office block at one end, but there was enough evidence of meticulous care to convince him that something very different was to be found inside. He smiled at the elaborate logo and sign above the entrance: ARMATI - Advanced Real Meat Acquisition Technologies Inc. It was a pretty good name for what they did, and that was exactly why he had come.

He stepped into the reception area.

&#8216;Good morning, Sir, can I help you?&#8217;

&#8216;Miss Kate Graham is expecting me.&#8217;

&#8216;Ah, yes. You must be Mr Li Ho Wang.&#8217;

He smiled his assent.

&#8216;Sir, please take a seat while I prepare your security pass and call Miss Kate for you.&#8217;

&#8216;Thank you, Miss . . . &#8216;

&#8216;Emma. Call me Emma.&#8217;

&#8216;Thank you, Emma.&#8217;

The seats in the reception area were luxurious, and he didn&#8217;t think he would ever want to get up again. His eyes were drawn to the colourful images displayed on the walls of the reception area; fabulous looking, nude girls, each on a barbecue spit, a couple of them moving erotically, obviously still quite alive when those clips were recorded. On the other wall were still photographs of quite beautiful Jessica machines with lovely nude girls sprawled over them. Those advanced machines had come a long way since Dolcett&#8217;s day, he thought. Women were quite understandably attracted to the look and feel of them, especially the feel.

&#8216;Mr Wang? I&#8217;m Jim Coates. Welcome to ARMATI!&#8217; A tall, well dressed man, his suit mostly concealed beneath a spotless white coat, approached, offering his hand. &#8216;Please call me Jim. Everybody else does&#8217;

&#8216;Mr Coates? It will be my pleasure. Jim. I believe you know why I&#8217;m here.&#8217;

&#8216;I do indeed, Mr Wang. Miss Kate has asked me to set up some demonstrations for you before your meeting. I believe you are interested in the more advanced meat acquisition machines.&#8217;

Li smiled to himself. Years ago those machines would have been called Jessicas, their purpose seen quite differently. They were still spitting machines, of course, but these days they had to attract the meat, and that required something a lot more advanced than the original Jessica machine. Today&#8217;s machines were full of smart mechanisms and intelligent programming. It took somebody quite devious to come up with good, practical ideas and make them work, and nobody had been quite so successful at that than the world famous Kate Graham, the secret weapon of the girlmeat processing industry.

&#8216;I have been looking forward to this for quite a while Jim. Shall we go?&#8217;

&#8216;Right this way.&#8217;

From the reception area he led Li through a short corridor to a hospitality area where three smiling and very beautiful women were waiting.

&#8216;Mr Wang, please help yourself to coffee and biscuits, and I&#8217;ll introduce you to some of the girls who will be helping us with the demonstration. They are all members of our company staff here.&#8217;

Li helped himself to the coffee and turned to rejoin his host.

A smiling brunette stepped forward, wearing a sheer silk dress in a tasteful shade of brown. As she moved, it became stunningly obvious that she wore absolutely nothing else, except a matching pair of highly polished high heeled sandals.

&#8216;Monica? Meet Mr Wang. He is looking forward to our program today.&#8217;

&#8216;Hello, Mr Wang.&#8217;

&#8216;It is a pleasure to meet you, my dear. Monica is a very nice name. Are you going to demonstrate one of the spitting machines for me?&#8217;

&#8216;Oh no, Mr Wang. My job is to show you how safe they are unless I do something really stupid.&#8217; She laughed. &#8216;I promise you, I&#8217;m going to be very, very careful.&#8217;

She had a nice laugh, but Li was rather taken by the movement of her obviously bare breasts beneath her dress.

&#8216;Have you done a lot of these demonstrations, Monica?&#8217;

&#8216;Oh no, Sir. I work in Administration, but we are a bit short of female staff at the moment, so they asked if I would help out. Don&#8217;t worry, I know exactly how the machines work, and I&#8217;m sure I can give you a good demonstration.&#8217;

Jim beckoned another girl forward, a dark skinned beauty with black hair, and a generously proportioned body. She was wearing a similar dress in a combination of bright colours. It suited her marvellously. She had rather prominent, chocolate coloured nipples, and there was a hint of gold in the dark shadowy slit between her legs.

&#8216;This is Tanya, Mr Wang. She normally works in Accounts, but we drafted her in today for the demonstration.&#8217;

&#8216;Have you done this before, Tanya?&#8217;

&#8216;Oh no, Sir, but we get field trips, and I&#8217;ve seen the machines used lots of times. I&#8217;ve never actually been on one though.&#8217;

&#8216;What did you think of the machines?&#8217;

&#8216;Oh, they work pretty well; the ones I&#8217;ve seen anyway, but the girls I saw made it far too easy. When a girl climbs onto a machine like that and does something silly, and then she gets spitted, well, she can hardly complain afterwards, can she?&#8217;

Li laughed. &#8216;I suppose not, Tanya. And now you are going to climb on one for me!&#8217;

&#8216;That&#8217;s not exactly the same thing, Sir. I&#8217;m just doing a demonstration, and I&#8217;m not silly like those other girls. It is exciting though. I&#8217;ve always wondered how it feels to be on a machine like that. In Accounts we see a lot of orders, but we don&#8217;t see the actual machines. I believe some of them are pretty fancy.&#8217;

&#8216;So I&#8217;m told, Tania. How much do you know about the way the machines work?&#8217;

&#8216;I know they&#8217;re exciting to watch, and pretty exciting for the girl. That&#8217;s about it. Sales take care of the technical details. I just process the payments.&#8217;

&#8216;Doesn&#8217;t it worry you, that you might get spitted?&#8217;

&#8216;Oh no, Mr Wang. Of course I could be called up for harvesting any time, but it&#8217;s not that. It&#8217;s just that I&#8217;m not one of those silly girls who can&#8217;t control themselves. The ones I watched all seemed to be having a great time, but my job today is just to show you how a girl looks on a machine, before you buy one.&#8217;

Li chuckled to himself. This was too good to be true, but the girls were sincere enough. The coffee was pretty good too, a rather fine Columbian blend.

&#8216;Thank you, Tania. I look forward to your demonstration.&#8217;

&#8216;Thank you, Sir.&#8217;

After the other two girls stepped away, Jim brought another girl forward.

&#8216;Mr Wang, this is Barbara, who is also helping with our demonstrations today.&#8217;

&#8216;Good morning, Barbara.&#8217;

&#8216;Good morning, Sir.&#8217;

Barbara had ginger hair, feisty blue eyes and a creamy complexion. Her dress went perfectly with her eyes and her matching shoes. It also had trouble containing her firm, well rounded breasts. Li was impressed by her lean, athletic looking body. It looked as though she had a lot of good quality meat on her.

&#8216;What do you normally do here, Barbara?&#8217;

&#8216;Sir, I am a telephonist in the Sales Department.&#8217;

&#8216;You have a very nice voice, Barbara. I might have spoken to you myself.&#8217;

&#8216;Perhaps you have. Thank you, Sir.&#8217;

&#8216;How did you come to be chosen to help with the demonstration?&#8217;

&#8216;Well, Sir, it was a bet. My friend bet me that I wouldn&#8217;t volunteer, and then she bet that I&#8217;d definitely be spitted. She&#8217;s such a fool about stuff like that. She said that if she lost the bet she&#8217;d volunteer for the testing programme. So here I am.&#8217;

&#8216;I see. So was it just because it was a bet, or do you really believe that you are going to win?&#8217;

&#8216;Well, Sir, I know lots of girls lose bets like that, but I&#8217;m not just a passer-by in some park or other. We make the machines here, and in the Sales department I have to know about all the standard features, so I can explain them to clients. I&#8217;ve been on field trips to see some of our newly installed machines in action, and I have a pretty good idea what I shouldn&#8217;t do! At least I have a much better chance than most girls who&#8217;ve never seen one of our machines before.&#8217;

&#8216;Advanced Real Meat Acquisition Technologies, that&#8217;s a pretty interesting name for a company. What do you tell the clients about the products you sell?&#8217;

&#8216;That our machines are the best on the market in terms of meat acquisition.&#8217;

&#8216;What does that mean?&#8217;

&#8216;They usually report the success rate. What matters is the percentage of the girls who mount a machine and finish up getting spitted. The higher the percentage, the better.&#8217;

&#8216;What sort of percentages are we talking about?&#8217;

&#8216;Oh, it depends on the machine. A standard machine might only get 50%, but the more advanced machines can get up to over 95%. That&#8217;s really efficient. At the top end, with special features, our machines are the best on the market.&#8217;

&#8216;I see. 95% sounds pretty impressive. How do they achieve that?&#8217;

&#8216;With an ordinary machine it&#8217;s pretty simple. All the girl has to do is avoid pressing firmly into the clamps, but half of them finish up doing that anyway.&#8217;

&#8216;Why is that?&#8217;

&#8216;Some girls have an impulse to do it and see how it feels, some are so excited by the feel of the machine that they forget to be careful, and if she has a climax a girl will often lose control and activate the clamps by accident. Of course an attended machine gets better results than that, even as high as 100%, but the aim of our technology is to do that without human assistance, other than the girl herself.&#8217;

&#8216;What makes your machines different?&#8217;

&#8216;When a girl is in position on the machine, she can&#8217;t help thinking about the spit, and the more she does that, the more excited she gets. Most of the mechanisms encourage her to have a climax and when she loses control it takes only a small movement to trigger the machine. Of course the safest thing she can do is not mount the machine in the first place. She can just keep still and try not to respond to what she feels. Most of them either don&#8217;t expect it, or can&#8217;t control it anyway.&#8217;

&#8216;I see,&#8217; Mr Wang told her, impressed by her understanding.

&#8216;There&#8217;s also another important factor in Real Meat Acquisition, but it&#8217;s much harder to measure. If the machine is attractive, and the girls seem to be having a good time, it will attract more of them to try it.&#8217;

&#8216;How do you measure that?&#8217;

&#8216;We have done video analysis to see how many girls in a given crowd finish up trying the machine.&#8217;

&#8216;What sort of results did you get?&#8217;

&#8216;I believe it was something like 70%, but when we ran the same analysis with different machines, the more advanced machines got higher scores. I believe some of them were over 85%.&#8217;

&#8216;So, let me get this right. 85% of the girls who see the machine finish up trying it, and 95% of those finish up on a spit. That&#8217;s an overall success rate of over 80%.&#8217;

&#8216;Yes, Sir, that&#8217;s about right.&#8217;

&#8216;Then I think Real Meat Acquisition is a good term for it. How do you feel about that, as a girl?&#8217;

&#8216;I think girls get what they want, and sooner or later most of us will be harvested anyway. If the machine looks interesting, a lot of us will go for it. It&#8217;s better than finishing up on some processing line. Spitroasting is so much more sexy.&#8217;

&#8216;Does that mean you don&#8217;t care if you get spitted today?&#8217;

&#8216;Mmmmm, not really. I&#8217;m just doing a demonstration to show off the machine. I&#8217;m not here to get spitted, Sir.&#8217;

&#8216;It does sound as if the odds are rather stacked against you, though.&#8217;

&#8216;Well, I have a much better chance than most girls, with what I know. I know a lot about the machines, and I&#8217;ve seen them in action lots of times, so I have a good idea where most of the girls went wrong. I&#8217;m doing it as a technical challenge, not because I&#8217;m excited by the idea of getting spitted, like most girls.&#8217;

&#8216;You mean you aren&#8217;t excited by the idea?&#8217;

&#8216;I am, yes, but not enough to forget about the consequences. I&#8217;m just thinking how much better I will be at selling the machines after trying one for real.&#8217;

&#8216;But, if you succeed, doesn&#8217;t that mean that the machine failed? How will that help you to sell the machines?&#8217;

Barbara smiled. &#8216;Whatever happens will make no difference to the overall real meat acquisition rate, Sir. It will still be the same even if it doesn&#8217;t spit me.&#8217;

&#8216;You are a very intelligent girl, Barbara, as well as beautiful. I&#8217;m looking forward to your demonstration. I&#8217;m sure you will look stunningly sexy on one of those machines, and you&#8217;ll give a great show. Good luck.&#8217;

The fact was, Barbara would look stunningly sexy in a floor length bearskin coat with a bag over her head. She had the kind of figure that no amount of clothing could disguise. It was also quite obvious that she knew exactly what her chances were, and believed she could beat the machine. At least, she was going to try.

As Barbara moved away, Jim beckoned to Mr Wang, who followed him to a viewing area where three Jessica machines were set up in separate partitioned showrooms behind thick plate glass windows. Monica was waiting by the first machine, which was set up at an angle to the viewing window, giving a good view of the machine from the rear and the side.

Monica looked a little self-conscious in her nudity.

&#8216;Monica, would you mind turning for Mr Wang, so he can see your credentials! He ordered.&#8217;

Obediently she turned, displaying first the meat stamp on her bottom cheek, and then the tag inserted through her bare pussy lip. She had a smooth, beautifully curved shape and Li could tell firm meat when he saw it.

&#8216;All right, Monica, you can mount the machine now.&#8217;

She looked quite enthusiastic as she knelt in position over the machine, taking care to keep her wrists well clear of the clamps. She was not that stupid.

Li and Jim exchanged glances.

&#8216;Monica, would you mind getting a little more comfortable! Mr Wang wants to see how the machine fits a girl of the right dimensions.&#8217;

&#8216;All right, Sir,&#8217; Monica said with a sigh. It felt nice. In fact it felt incredible. It was just the kind of feeling that a sillier girl would surrender to. The more she felt the smooth metal fitting so perfectly to the contours of her body, the more tempted she was. There was an odd tingling though, in her nipples, like static electricity, and she felt herself terribly aroused.

&#8216;Aaaaah!&#8217; She yelled as the prickling found the centre of her pleasure, deep within her slit and she knew she was juicing terribly but when she tried to lift herself off, the pleasure grew until it exploded and her arms went limp, a moment later she heard a CLICK as the clamps locked and she was suddenly helpless to resist as the helmet dropped into place over her head and the pleasure mechanism closed over her pussy. Then she was screaming with pleasure, utterly helpless, too distracted to feel the first light touch of the spit, but then it became insistent and she moved instinctively to centre her vulva and ease its entry.

Mr Wang watched with professional interest as Monica&#8217;s spitted body was picked up by the overhead conveyor, and sped upwards from the test chamber. She was thinking ruefully that the machine had worked rather too well, but at least it must have impressed Mr Wang. Perhaps some good will come of this, she thought.

&#8216;Interesting,&#8217; Li remarked.

&#8216;What you saw there was one of our newer optional features, the electrostatic gun. It almost always causes the girl to lose control. We can include it with one of our standard models,&#8217; Jim told him.

&#8216;It looks most effective,&#8217; Mr Wang replied.

&#8216;Let&#8217;s look at another one of our newer machines,&#8217; Jim told him. &#8216;We have it set up in the next showroom.&#8217;

Tanya stood in a tempting pose, the glint of gold between her legs now revealed as a ring emerging from the ridge of her clitoris hood. Li found himself hardening. It was most embarrassing, but Jim seemed not to have noticed. Not for the first time he wished he could have worn something looser and more comfortable, as he did at home.

&#8216;Will you turn for us, please, Tanya!&#8217;

Tania&#8217;s lower bottom cheek displayed an official looking meat stamp, and there was also a tag through her pussy lip, but Li could not take his eyes off the ring as she turned back to face them. Surely it must have some significance.

He looked questioningly at Jim.

&#8216;The ring? Those are popular with the girls, these days, and we encourage them. The insertion is quite deep through the clitoris ridge, under the clitoris itself, and I&#8217;m told that the feel of them is quite special. A few gentle tugs will make some girls climax uncontrollably. I suggest that you watch closely.&#8217;

Li had an idea that something unusual was going to happen.

&#8216;We are ready for your demonstration now, Tania. Let&#8217;s see you on the machine.&#8217;

&#8216;Yes, Sir.&#8217;

The machine was set up at an angle to the viewing window, giving an excellent view of the rear and left side.

&#8216;Mr Wang, as you might have noticed, this machine is higher than the previous one, and I have here a remote control, which I will use to demonstrate some of its special features.&#8217;

Tania looked a little nervous on the machine, her breasts fitting perfectly through the smoothly rounded cutouts in the block. She was fidgeting, obviously trying not to get too close to the clamps, except of course, those she could not avoid under her widely parted ankles and knees, and her neck. What was very sexy indeed was the ring that now hung freely from her clitoris ridge, quite close to the block.

&#8216;See if you can hug the block a bit more closely, Tania.&#8217;

She wriggled her bottom, and managed to move her pussy a little closer to the block.

&#8216;Would you like to press 1 on this remote, Mr Wang?&#8217;

&#8216;Of course, Jim. It will be my pleasure.&#8217;

He pressed the button, there was a soft click and suddenly Tania was wriggling wildly in shocked surprise.

&#8216;Sir, I can&#8217;t . . . it&#8217;s not fair. I didn&#8217;t do anything!&#8217; She protested.

To Mr Wang&#8217;s amusement, there was now a strong looking steel loop linking her pussy ring to the block. In her position, her hands were well out of reach. She was a fixture. It was very, very nice.

&#8216;That is one of our new features, Mr Wang, and it&#8217;s available as an optional extra on all our machines. It really helps a girl if she&#8217;s undecided, don&#8217;t you think?&#8217;

&#8216;Oh yes, I like it very much, Jim. How does it work?&#8217;

&#8216;Inside the block there is a sensor. When it detects a ring like that, it waits until it is in just the right position to be hooked, and the steel loop seals her ring to the block before she has a chance to react. Miss Kate came up with the idea. If more girls wore rings like that, it would increase acquisition rates significantly.&#8217;

&#8216;That&#8217;s an interesting idea.&#8217;

Li was asking himself how they could fit those rings to a significant proportion of the girls in his country. They could do it like a mass vaccination program, he thought, with mobile piercing units, but gold rings would be far too expensive.

&#8216;Do you have to use a remote control to activate it? I am really looking for machines that will work unattended.&#8217;

&#8216;No, Mr Wang. I am just using this remote control for the demonstration. Normally the machines are set up to hook the girl automatically when a ring is detected in the right position, but you could have fun with a remote control, if you had a machine set up in your office building.&#8217;

&#8216;Indeed I could, Jim.&#8217;

&#8216;Now if you watch closely, I believe Tania is about to have a climax.&#8217;

Every tug at Tania&#8217;s clitoris brought a small explosion of pleasure, and the more she moved, the more intense the sensations that flooded through her body.

&#8216;Sir, please let me go, I can&#8217;t . . . .&#8217; She begged plaintively.

&#8216;I think, you will see, Mr Wang, how useful this feature can be. Just using this feature alone, most girls will lose control and activate the spitting mechanism, but I am now going to demonstrate another special feature of this machine. Would you be kind enough to press 2 on this keypad for me?&#8217;

&#8216;With pleasure, Jim.&#8217;

Suddenly the machine lifted and began to buck, dropping one side, then the other, dropping the front and then lifting it suddenly. Instinctively Tania grabbed at the block, and a moment later there was a loud CLICK as the clamps locked. Jim switched off the motion mechanism and the block settled back into place.

&#8216;Most impressive, Jim. Can I take it that this feature can also be set to run automatically?&#8217;

&#8216;Yes, Mr Wang. It can, most definitely. If you watch closely now, you will see the steel loop releasing Tania&#8217;s ring before the pleasure cycle begins. Of course she is already having a climax, but that makes no difference.&#8217;

They watched as the steel loop withdrew from Tania&#8217;s ring and the pleasure cycle began. Soon she was screaming with pleasure. Her screams were only silenced when the spit emerged from her open mouth. It seemed almost a pity when the conveyor lifted her erotically wriggling, spitted body up and out of sight.

&#8216;That was an excellent demonstration, Jim, but I am curious to know how the acquisition rate is affected, when other girls have already seen it in action.&#8217;

&#8216;It seems they find it sexy and fascinating, especially girls with those rings. It looks so exciting that they forget about the risk.&#8217;

&#8216;Would you like more coffee, Mr Wang? Perhaps you&#8217;d like a break before we continue?&#8217;

Li was grateful for Jim&#8217;s consideration. He needed a comfort break.

The coffee was just what he needed after travelling halfway across the world, but at least he had enjoyed a good sleep in his private first class cabin on the plane.

&#8216;Barbara is waiting for us now, Mr Wang. I think she might surprise us.&#8217;

&#8216;She is certainly very intelligent, but beautiful too.&#8217;

&#8216;Barbara, would you mind turning for Mr Wang? That&#8217;s it. Thank you.&#8217;

Nude, Barbara was even more sexy than he had expected. Her legs were amazing, long and beautifully curved, and her skin looked incredibly smooth. The brown meat stamp on her bottom cheek was a tantalising invitation. Her pussy lips were full and neatly, temptingly divided with her meat tag inserted through one of them. Her firm, superbly rounded breasts thrust proudly, with no need for support. Her torso would have made a fine figurehead on a sailing clipper, Li thought, but the qualities of her meat looked even more tempting.

&#8216;Right, Barbara, we are ready now. Would you please mount the machine.&#8217;

&#8216;Of course, Sir.&#8217;

She knelt with her widely parted ankles and knees in the grooves, and leant over the machine, making sure to keep her wrists well clear of the clamps. Her chin rested comfortably on the pad, lifted to align her mouth with her pussy. It was easy to imagine the path of the spit opening her vulva, running straight through her body and out of her mouth. She was perfectly positioned for it, but she was not overwhelmed by the feel of it.

She grinned, feeling very relaxed. This was going to be easy, as long as she didn&#8217;t lose it. The most important thing was to keep her composure, no matter what happened. She had noticed Tania&#8217;s ring, and it didn&#8217;t take a genius to guess what feature Jim had demonstrated on her. She wondered if she was going to be tested with the electrostatic stimulator, or perhaps the bucking mechanism. That was popular with the clients, and often surprised the girls. She grinned. This was going to be fun. The only question was, what kind of fun.

&#8216;Barbara, I want to show Mr Wang a girl in the proper position. Please move your arms a little closer to the clamps. There&#8217;s no need to activate the clamps, I just want you to look as if you could.&#8217;

&#8216;Here we go,&#8217; she thought, obediently moving her wrists a little closer to the clamps, but not quite touching them. She was not that stupid. There had to be something else. Ah, she thought, as she felt a mild but growing tingling in her nipples and pussy. That&#8217;s it, just as I expected. The electrostatic feature. She stiffened her arms to make sure she didn&#8217;t flop into the clamps accidentally as the pleasure mounted. Soon she was squirming, but she was grinning happily. This is nice, but I can control it, she thought. Forewarned is forearmed.

&#8216;As you see, Mr Wang, Barbara is doing rather well. The ordinary features might not complete her acquisition, and she is not wearing one of those special rings.&#8217;

&#8216;Well done, Barbara,&#8217; he told her when the spasms subsided. &#8216;You are doing well. Now I want you to move your wrists a little closer to the clamps, almost but not quite touching. I want to show Mr Wang something.&#8217;

Curious, she obeyed. Perhaps this was it, she wondered. She tried to think of another feature he might be planning to use on her, but nothing came to mind.

She brushed her wrists lightly against the smooth surface of the clamps. CLICK! She gasped with surprise. How had he done that? Damn, she thought. The old advice came to mind; never bet on a sure thing.

&#8216;W-what&#8217;s happened, Sir? I didn&#8217;t press the clamps! I really didn&#8217;t!&#8217;

&#8216;Of course you didn&#8217;t, Barbara. That is a new feature I wanted to show Mr Wang, straight out of the lab. It has not reached our current product line yet.&#8217;

She felt the light touch of the pleasure mechanism on her pussy and gasped as it began to work.

'Mr Wang, those clamps are activated by body heat, not pressure. The girl only has to get close and the clamps will lock. That is really Advanced Real Meat Acquisition Technology. Girls can see the machine in action any number of times and still think the clamps are pressure activated. What do you think, Barbara?&#8217;

&#8216;S-Sir, it&#8217;s terrible. It&#8217;s going to work every time. We won&#8217;t have a chance. Aaah! W-we won&#8217;t need to work out the acquisition rate, and the most terrible thing is that girls will want to try it. You will empty the parks with this damned machine.&#8217;

&#8216;If we can build enough barbecue pits. Is that right, Barbara?&#8217;

&#8216;Aaaah! Oooooh! Y-yes, Sir! I&#8217;m s-sorry, Sir, I can&#8217;t think . . . .&#8217;

A moment later she screamed for the first time, then again. Her body writhed and contorted helplessly as the insistent stimulation continued. The two men watched with enjoyment as she felt the touch of the spit, instinctively adjusted her position to receive it. It slid smoothly through her helpless, perfectly aligned body until it emerged from her mouth. She was going to be a fine looking spitroast, turning over the flames, they thought as she was picked up by the conveyor and moved upwards, out of sight.

&#8216;That was most impressive, Jim, especially to see how it worked with a girl who knew as much about the machines as she did.&#8217;

Jim grinned. He thought Wang was going to see it that way. That was the whole idea of picking Barbara to demonstrate that particular feature.

&#8216;What do you think of our technologies as a whole, Mr Wang? I&#8217;m sure you will have some questions for Miss Kate when you meet her shortly. Would you care for another coffee in the meantime?&#8217;

&#8216;Thank you, Jim. There is no such thing as too much coffee.&#8217;

A tall, elegantly dressed woman entered the room. She had brown hair and eyes that made you wonder if they were blue or green, but they were definitely not brown. There was nothing wrong with her figure either, and her easy movement suggested that she took plenty of the right kind of exercise. She had a rounded face and a bit of colour in her cheeks. Li guessed that she was in her early 30s.

&#8216;Miss Kate, let me introduce Li Ho Wang. Mr Wang has been most impressed with our demonstration. There was not a single failure.&#8217;

&#8216;Thank you, Jim,&#8217; she answered. &#8216;Good morning Mr Wang. Welcome to our facility.&#8217;

&#8216;I am truly honoured, Miss Kate. Your advanced machines are legendary in our part of the world, and I was most impressed by your latest models.&#8217;

&#8216;That is very kind of you, Mr Wang. We do our best.&#8217;

&#8216;I was fortunate enough to be introduced to the girls who volunteered to model the machines I was shown today. They all seemed convinced that it was perfectly safe, and I&#8217;m sure that none of them intended to finish up being spitted. I was most impressed with Barbara. It was almost a pity to waste a girl like that just to show me a special new feature, but she was certainly very convincing.&#8217;

&#8216;Don&#8217;t worry, Mr Wang, she will not be wasted, as you will see, later on. In the meantime I expect you have some questions for me. Why don&#8217;t we sit down comfortably and talk. Jim! I will have a black coffee. Make mine Brazilian dark roast. Would you like another one, Mr Wang?&#8217;

&#8216;Not just now, Miss Kate. I only just started this one.&#8217;

&#8216;You said that none of them intended to be spitted, Mr Wang, but that depends on what we mean by &#8216;intended&#8217;. The silly pussies always think they are too clever for the machine, but they also know that they are ready for harvesting, so it never comes as a complete surprise.&#8217;

&#8216;Miss Kate, before I came here today I was already curious to meet you. You have contributed the most inventive and successful ideas to the design of the advanced spitting machine, and yet you are a woman. That fascinates me.&#8217;

&#8216;Mr Wang, we have different kinds of advanced machine here. Our production plant models are for use in a high throughput meatgirl processing environment, but we still guarantee a high quality experience for every piglet. The machines you saw today were our latest stand-alone, self-activated models and the silly pussies mount them in their thousands. Piglets are all so predictable.&#8217;

&#8216;Why do you think your designs are so successful, Miss Kate?&#8217;

&#8216;A piglet on one of our machines has no idea what to expect, how it will feel, or why she is vulnerable. She has instinctive reactions, but she has no way to control something she has never experienced. We have observed and analysed the responses of thousands of them, and we know exactly how the silly pussies react, so it is an unequal contest. All the same, it is my job to ensure that the piglet has no chance at all, and I enjoy that enormously. I love the whole idea of it.&#8217;

&#8216;Don&#8217;t you see yourself in their position? How do you feel about that?&#8217;

&#8216;It is so kind of you to ask. Most people are afraid to know how I feel about it. The truth is, I love the challenge. Because I am a woman, I know what piglets like, how they feel, what attracts them, what tempts them and what distracts them. All I do is suggest how to build those qualities into our meat acquisition products.&#8217;

&#8216;You seem very dedicated to the idea, for a woman.&#8217;

&#8216;I do feel dedicated. It is one thing to understand how a piglet thinks, and how she responds physically, but ensuring that she is spitted the very first time is a humane responsibility, and I take that very seriously. It is also far more efficient if the more elusive girls are taken care of. The engineers are very good at implementing my suggestions, and we all work as a team.&#8217;

&#8216;Miss Kate, I can see that you are a true professional.&#8217;

&#8216;Thank you, Mr Wang. I am just doing my job,&#8217; she told him politely.

&#8216;I believe I know why you don&#8217;t call your machines Jessicas, but most of the other manufacturers do. I&#8217;d like to hear you explain why.&#8217;

Kate grinned. This was her favourite subject.

&#8216;Mr Wang, we do not make Jessica machines. A Jessica machine was traditionally used purely for spitting. They might have had associated functions, but nothing different from that. In most cases traditional Jessica machines were used to spit girls with a lot of help from attendants. Often this was non-consensual, although girls did volunteer.&#8217;

&#8216;Our Advanced Real Meat Acquisition products,&#8217; she continued, &#8216;are designed to attract the piglets, make them want to mount and activate the machines, complete the process and deliver them to the barbecue site; alive, spitted and ready to roast. Our technology places most of the emphasis on the first two functions, attraction and activation, while the traditional Jessica machine focused purely on the spitting function, and only had a very simple activation system.&#8217;

&#8216;Of course there are obvious parallels,&#8217; she added. &#8216;The piglet, the chin rest, the securing devices and the spitting motor are in very similar positions, but then, there is no better way to align a piglet for spitting. We have done a lot of research. In the end we decided that it works, and doesn&#8217;t need fixing. Our focus is on very different aspects of the whole situation, and especially the activation technology, as you have seen from the demonstrations.&#8217;

&#8216;Attraction is a psychological issue. If the machine looks beautiful, and the process is visually appealing, we are half way there. I don&#8217;t think the silly pussies care if they surrender or not, as long as they are excited by the idea of it. They like to be the centre of attention, and after seeing other piglets squirming with pleasure, it is natural for them to be strongly attracted. All we have to do after that is make sure that if a piglet mounts the machine, it is so easy to activate the process that none of them are going to be disappointed.&#8217;

&#8216;Disappointed?&#8217; Li asked.

&#8216;Yes, it is terrible if a piglet is allowed to just walk away, after she had the courage to mount a machine like that, knowing what to expect. She will feel empty and even rejected. She will not be pleased by its failure, and after that, when she sees another piglet enjoying the ultimate pleasure of the spitting process, she will feel incredibly jealous. Some finish up as volunteers at the meat processing plants.&#8217;

&#8216;I had no idea,&#8217; Li told her, &#8216;but it makes perfect sense.&#8217;

&#8216;All I do is lead the silly pussies on until they set their machines in motion. There are so many ways to do that, and we are just beginning to design some of the more interesting features into our machines. I know you saw one or two examples in the demonstration.&#8217;

&#8216;Yes, I liked all your ideas, but the demonstration showed that you can make those ideas work in a commercial product, like the new machine with the heat triggered clamps.&#8217;

&#8216;Would you like to see the production line, Mr Wang?&#8217; She asked.

&#8216;Thank you. That would be most interesting.&#8217; Li answered gratefully.

&#8216;Very good. After your tour I will join you in the Executive Club for lunch.&#8217;

&#8216;Thank you, Miss Kate. You are most gracious.&#8217;

&#8216;Will you come this way, Mr Wang?&#8217;

&#8216;Of course, Jim.&#8217;

The production line was in the assembly building, which was in a hard hat area. On entering the building, Jim gave Mr Wang a hard hat, asked the supervisor to halt the production line and led the way to a partially assembled machine.

&#8216;Mr Wang, I thought you&#8217;d like to have a closer look at the new technology we used Barbara to demonstrate earlier.&#8217;

&#8216;Thank you, Jim.&#8217;

&#8216;I expect you are familiar with the standard technology that has been about for the past five years or so?&#8217;

&#8216;It has been my business to import those machines into the Asian market for even longer than that,&#8217; Wang replied. &#8216;I assume you are referring to the pressure sensors that activate the clamps when the girl presses firmly into them.&#8217;

&#8216;Yes, Sir,&#8217; Jim answered. &#8216;That is where these latest machines are different. These are entirely electrical. These heat sensors,&#8217; he continued, indicating a rectangular insert in the inner face of the clamps, &#8216;detect the proximity of a girl&#8217;s limb due to her body heat. With these latest machines there is no need for the girl to press firmly into the clamps to lock her into position for the spit.&#8217;

&#8216;Does she still have to be ready in all the clamps before they lock?&#8217;

&#8216;That&#8217;s a very good question. We can set these machines up in different ways. The client can also change the settings as required. One of the options is to set the delay between detecting the wrists in position and locking the clamps. It can be very sensitive, in fact almost simultaneous. Setting a delay of a few seconds lets the girl enjoy the moment before acquisition is completed. We can also allow the girl&#8217;s wrists to be detected in position two or three times before the clamps finally lock. All of that tends to fool the bystanders into thinking that the clamps are still pressure activated. They love to put their wrists in the clamps and brush the smooth metal lightly, knowing how easy it is to take that final step. The more it looks as though they can do that quite safely, the more tempted they are. It doesn&#8217;t seem to matter if all the girls who go before finish up being spitted.&#8217;

&#8216;Hmmmm. I see. Very nice. Was this Miss Kate&#8217;s idea?&#8217;

&#8216;Yes. Devious, isn&#8217;t it. Kate likes to call them piglets, or occasionally silly pussies, because that&#8217;s how she feels about them. She&#8217;s not far wrong, actually.&#8217;

They exchanged smiles.

&#8216;And I suppose she does not include herself in any of those categories!&#8217;

&#8216;I&#8217;m not sure, but if she didn&#8217;t imagine herself in any of those situations, I don&#8217;t think she would be quite as good at what she does. I think she is so deprecating because she knows how terribly vulnerable she is herself.&#8217;

Jim led Li on through the plant showing him how the machines were built. He took him to the Programming section and introduced him to some of the staff who did the programming. He met the Production Manager and the Product Quality Testing staff. By that time hours had passed, and he was beginning to feel rather hungry.

&#8216;If it&#8217;s all right with you, Sir, we should go back now. Lunch should be ready now.&#8217;

&#8216;Would that be a barbecued spitroast, by any chance?&#8217;

Jim grinned. &#8216;It might be.&#8217;

&#8216;One of the girls we met this morning, by chance?&#8217;

&#8216;I mustn&#8217;t spoil Miss Kate&#8217;s little surprise.&#8217;

On the executive terrace Kate was relaxing as she watched the piglets roasting. Monica had started roasting first on maximum heat, and she should be ready for carving. She would do very well for lunch. The others were being roasted more slowly, and would be ready for the the Board of Directors&#8217; formal dinner.

Monica&#8217;s well browned, evenly basted skin was cracking and popping nicely. Li Wang was sure to appreciate her meat. It would make a change from the flavours of home grown meat in his own country.

Tania had the perfect shape for a spitroast, well balanced and nicely rounded, with her golden pussy ring still in place, and her nipples rigid as if straining to reach the flames. Barbara was the pick of the bunch, and the Directors would enjoy being presented with her. They would enjoy it even more when she told them how successful the demonstrations had been, and the contribution Barbara had made. Piglets were piglets once you had them nicely browning over the barbecue pit, but Barbara had meant far more than that. She had been a very useful member of the Sales Team, but needs must, she thought.

&#8216;Mr Wang, I hope you enjoyed your tour.&#8217;

&#8216;Very much, thank you, Miss Kate,&#8217; he answered, his eyes straying to the roasting pits.

&#8216;Monica started roasting first, so we are having her served for lunch. What we don&#8217;t eat will be served to the staff. Tania and Barbara are going to be served at the Board of Directors&#8217; Dinner tonight. I hope you can join us.&#8217;

&#8216;I wouldn&#8217;t miss it for the world,&#8217; he answered. &#8216;All three of those beauties look very tasty indeed, but Barbara is one I will remember in a very special way.&#8217;

&#8216;I think we will all remember Barbara,&#8217; Kate told him, &#8216;but they are all just piglets now, appetising spitroasts. That is what we do. It&#8217;s our business, and we can&#8217;t get sentimental just because we knew those piglets as girls. Once a girl is roasted, all that matters is how good she tastes, and how appetising she looks on the table.

&#8216;I agree with you there, Miss Kate,&#8217; Li told her.

&#8216;She&#8217;ll be ready for carving in another half hour or so. In the meantime, perhaps you will tell me what you are looking for during your trip.&#8217;

&#8216;My dear Miss Kate,&#8217; Mr Wang answered, the erotic sight of the three girls roasting causing him to be uncharacteristically familiar with his hostess. &#8216;In my country we normally discuss business after eating, but under the circumstances, perhaps I can mention a few things I was hoping to achieve.&#8217;

&#8216;At the moment,&#8217; he continued, &#8216;processing plant hardware is really not our most urgent requirement. We are anxious to reduce our impact on the environment by reducing the number of girls transported to plants, and encouraging girls to come themselves to stand-alone machines, set up in parks and other accessible areas.

&#8216;I see. That makes sense.&#8217;

&#8216;You have some very innovative ideas, and I like the way you combine them in the same machines. You make it hard for those &#8216;piglets&#8217; to get away once they mount one of your machines, and I like the seamless way the pleasure cycle leads into the spitting process.&#8217;

&#8216;Our girls are highly intelligent, and I am sure the intellectual challenge would encourage them to try the machines. The advanced mechanical design and hidden functions will please as much as they surprise, and I am sure our &#8216;piglets&#8217; are just as physically susceptible as yours are. I&#8217;d like to take a few of your machines on trial.&#8217;

&#8216;How many were you thinking of?&#8217; Kate asked, her heart racing.

&#8216;Oh, I think a hundred will do to start with, in some of the major city centres.&#8217;

&#8216;When do you want delivery?&#8217;

&#8216;Let me see . . . how about four months?&#8217;

&#8216;At the factory, or including delivery?&#8217;

&#8216;Including delivery, but we will pay for air freight.&#8217;

&#8216;We can do that.&#8217;

&#8216;There is just one more thing,&#8217; Mr Wang added.

&#8216;Oh, what&#8217;s that?&#8217;

&#8216;You, Miss Kate. I want you to come out and supervise the installation of the first machines. I would also like you to write some promotional material, and give some lectures to our girls to appeal for their support. This is going to be a big thing for them. If it works there will be far bigger orders to follow. We can arrange simultaneous translation, but you can work in English.&#8217;

&#8216;Oh,&#8217; Kate answered, suddenly breathless. &#8216;I-I don&#8217;t know . . . .&#8217;

Mr Wang smiled. &#8216;Don&#8217;t worry, Miss Kate. We are going to take very good care of you, just as you are going to be very important for our economy.&#8217;

&#8216;Well, I suppose . . . .&#8217;

&#8216;I assume that you will agree, Miss Kate, and now I believe I will relax and enjoy your roast piglet!&#8217;

Kate laughed. At least he had a sense of humour, and after all, calling them &#8216;piglets&#8217; was her own idea.

Distracted by the conversation, they had failed to notice the chefs who were busily carving Monica&#8217;s steaming meat, until the waiter set large wooden trays in front of them. A chef then set several thick pieces of meat on each tray, with a portion of english mustard, salads on the side with house dressing, and baked potatoes with sour cream. They were also offered apple and cranberry sauces.

It was a feast worthy of the ARMATI enterprise. Monica&#8217;s meat was delicious. Li&#8217;s thoughts went to his plans to set up ARMATI machines all over his country. He was going to become very wealthy indeed, but the best part was enjoying your work.

Here is Part 2, and the conclusion of the story about Advanced Real Meat Acquisition Technologies and the people and machines involved. This has just pulled me along, as you will see from the length of the finished story, but this is not about length. I hope you will enjoy reading any small part of it.

Meat Acquisition Technologies Part 2

ï¿½ Spitman April 2008

On his return flight Li was in good humour. The visit to the ARMATI plant had gone even better than he had expected. He would need all of the next four months to prepare for the arrival of the machines. The results were going to be spectacular.

The highlight of the trip had been meeting the girls before the demonstration. It had been entertaining to hear what they had to say. It was much more convincing to demonstrate meat acquisition on girls who didn&#8217;t consciously want it to happen. A VIP comes halfway round the world to see those machines, and the girls didn&#8217;t think it was going to be a working demonstration? He chuckled to himself. Women were all piglets at heart. Miss Kate was right about that.

Kate Graham was a fascinating character. He didn&#8217;t buy all that stuff about it just being a job. She was a well endowed woman in fine condition, just as ready for the barbecue pit as any of the girls she helped in that particular direction. She was no fool. She would imagine herself on a roasting spit, waking and in her dreams, just like most other girls, whether they were old enough to be harvested or not.

Kate believed that her machines should close off every loophole, so that every girl who mounted the machine would be processed. Her subtle ideas would lead the girl to discover at some point that the outcome was inevitable, but it should not seem that way when she mounts the machine. The girl should always think she has a chance, and any girls watching should also think they will have a chance.

Kate&#8217;s explanation of what induced girls to mount the machines revealed a lot, but her desire to take advantage of every female weakness revealed even more. She must surely have an unconscious desire to experience all those things for herself, starting with the desire to mount the machine and feel those emotions she had only imagined. She would tremble with excitement at the thought of its purpose, its diabolical efficiency owing so much to her own well researched understanding of a woman&#8217;s unthinking responses and reactions. She would try not to think of the outcome as quite inevitable, but the moment she felt its embrace she would feel her body responding, betraying her. She would try desperately, uselessly to control her responses but without being consciously aware of what she had done, she would suddenly discover that the clamps had locked, her emotions exploding, helplessly responding as the long imagined pleasure cycle began.

She would scream with the intensity of her orgasms, barely conscious of the first touch of the spit between the swollen, slippery mounds of her lips, or the instinctive movement of her hips to ease its entry into her vulva. The sensation of the spit passing with awesome force steadily, smoothly through the soft core of her body, from the clinging tunnel of her cunt to her wide open mouth, would have a peculiar, awful familiarity, and then she would be nothing more than a silenced, wriggling piglet on a spit, roasting over the flames of a barbecue pit, just as she had always imagined.

It was not at all difficult to visualise Kate&#8217;s body bare, spitted and turning over a roasting pit. Sooner or later her time would come, but such a deviously inventive woman deserved a fitting challenge when her turn came.

The meeting with the Head of Research at ARMATI had been most intriguing. The range of ideas being researched was fascinating, mostly suggested by Kate, but it took a long time to develop a practical engineering design for some of them.

One of them had seemed particularly appealing at first sight. It involved nipple capture. With her nipples in specially designed traps a girl would have no chance of release, and the outcome would not be in doubt. That research program had run into problems though. It did help that in position on the machine, a girl&#8217;s nipples were always at the lowest point on her breasts, but girls varied too much in the size and shape of their nipples. A nipple trap would only work if the nipples were of a certain minimum size, and erect. The engineers had considered, and discarded the option of analysing the shape of the nipple from some kind of scan. It would be far too complex, and expensive for a mass produced machine. Then they had thought of building something that brushed and excited the nipples, and then attempted to lock onto them with the help of suction. That was simpler, and if it only worked on a proportion of the girls, that was acceptable. After all, a lot of the features only worked on a proportion of the girls.

The engineers were already thinking of modifying the ring catcher used on Tania in the demonstration. It wasn&#8217;t quite in accordance with the philosophy of Real Meat Acquisition. There really had to be a way for the girl to position herself and not be caught. At least, not immediately. The solution was to give her a full minute before it locked her to the block by the ring through her clitoris hood. In the meantime she had the same chance of activating the machine as any other girl. Many times the ring catcher would not be required. As it did not always operate, the risk would look less predictable to girls watching, and that would overcome the problem.

Jim had promised to keep him informed of progress in the research department, and it was nice to know that men had come up with at least some of the ideas!

* * * * *

Over the next few months Li had visited the plant several more times. There were prototypes being evaluated, with Asian women brought in specially to test them, as there were a number of differences from the standard American machine.

People power was more in accordance with energy conservation than providing overhead conveyors to deliver the spitted girls to the barbecue sites, which had as many as 40 roasting pits in some cases. If it took five or six hours to cook a spitroast properly, and the meat acquisition machine produced at least five spitted girls per hour when running continuously, you needed a lot of barbecue pits. That made a conveyor system of conveyors far more expensive and power hungry than the machine itself. There was no automatic banding mechanism, as there was in America. Teams were trained to fasten the girls to their spits, attach crossbars for easy handling, and deliver them to the roasting pits at a run.

The machines needed to accommodate a range of girl sizes. On average Asian girls were two inches or so shorter than American girls of similar age. Individual variations were far greater than those due to ethnic differences. A woman like Kate, for example, was ten inches taller than the average Asian woman, and some Asian women were even shorter than that average. There were also both ethnic and individual differences in the proportion between torso and leg lengths.

The simplest engineering solution was for the girl to stand against a vertical scale. On pressing a button, callipers slid up to her crotch and down to her head, and the machine automatically adjusted itself to fit her perfectly. It was not difficult or expensive to implement, and American machines were similarly upgraded for improved comfort over a wider range of body sizes.

Four months extended to six before the machines were finally ready with all of the requested features and as promised, Kate travelled to assist with the installation.

The flight to the Far East was luxurious but uneventful, and she was too excited to sleep in the luxurious First Class cabin booked for her by Li Wang. Few of the cities where the machines were set up had direct non-stop connections to the USA, and even fewer offered such a superior level of comfort on the flights. Xhi Dong had a strong trading relationship with Western business and industry, so it was an easy choice for that city to receive the first machines to be installed.

On her arrival at Xhi Dong Airport Kate was received by a group of women and, of course, Li Ho Wang who gave the appropriate introductions. She was impressed by their beauty. They wore the most stunning, intricately patterned floor length silk dresses, slit to reveal sexy glimpses of bare thigh, all creamy smooth and without a hint of underwear. There were also large keyhole-shaped openings between their breasts, displaying impressive amounts of cleavage. For some reason Kate had expected Asian girls to have tiny breasts. Perhaps some of them did, but these girls would all look perfect on a roasting spit. Some of them even spoke English.

Kate was tired after the sleepless flight, but excited at the prospect of seeing her Advanced Real Meat Acquisition Technology working in another part of the world, where as Li had explained, eating girlmeat played an essential part in maintaining a sustainable population. The girls were all keen to practice their English and there was a torrent of questions. Quite clearly they all believed that it was an essential social duty for every female citizen to surrender her meat for the common good.

The journey to the city centre was so fast, there was scarcely time to talk before she was ushered away to her hotel. She had a few hours to rest before the tour planned for the following day, and the bed was so soft and comfortable that after a soothing and fragrant bath, she fell asleep the moment she lay down.

In the morning she was met by Li who enquired if she had slept well, and asked if she required breakfast. Smiling, she told him that all she needed was her special Fibre-Flossï¿½ diet. Like most women eligible for harvesting, she had the habit of keeping herself ready at any time, and took great care to stay in condition.

On the tour she was accompanied by Li and two of the women she had met at the airport. They visited a typical real meat kitchen, where she was horrified to find an ancient hand cranked spitting machine and the most primitive gutting equipment, both showing signs of recent use. They had obviously come at the wrong time for her to see them in operation, to her profound relief. She shuddered at the thought of such inconsiderate butchery.

Bullet trains and fine tall buildings were all very well, but women deserved better treatment on their way to the roasting pit. Efficient Real Meat Acquisition required the willing cooperation of the piglets. They needed to see others enjoying extreme pleasure and excitement on the machine before they would step up themselves. That was a no-brainer, and she was already glad that she had come. Obviously there was a desperate need for what ARMATI had to offer.

After that they visited a Real Meat Processing and Packing Plant run by the State. It was disturbingly functional, without any consideration for the comfort or feelings of the girls being processed. They were herded to be slaughtered with whips, like cattle. The killing was cold, businesslike and unimaginative, but at least it was quick, and the girls were obviously resigned to their fate. Most were butchered, but a select few were spitted on a very old local copy of a Jessica 3000. It was crude, unpleasant, horribly painful and pleasureless, and the idea of live roasting did not seem to have occurred to anyone.

They then visited a traditional girlmeat butcher, where fresh wriggling piglets were hung by their widely parted ankles from overhead rails, waiting to be processed, their wrists neatly bound behind their backs. The butcher moved one into position over a hopper in the floor and casually slit its throat, then deftly cut it open from crotch to sternum and scooped its guts into a bowl. He then reached up to a large handle and pulled it firmly down, and a wickedly toothed bandsaw separated the meat into two separate halves from pussy to neck, while another passed across to separate the head which fell into the hopper where they heard grinding noises.

Li told her that brains had once been considered a particular delicacy, but recently the government had banned brains from the food chain for health reasons. By this time Kate had a pretty good idea what to expect. At least the butcher had done a neat and efficient job. Even in America, the process was not so very different.

Finally they visited a large and very crowded restaurant where several girls were roasting over barbecue pits. There was a hubbub of noise loud enough to rupture eardrums, Kate thought. Again she declined to eat, but she was impressed to see how expertly the chefs carved and served the meat, and the spicy sauces looked and smelled very appetising indeed.

Back at her hotel, she retired to her room to change into something less formal for the afternoon&#8217;s brief visit to the barbecue site, and she spent the intervening time looking through her notes. Today they would inspect the plinth and the facilities on the site generally, and check that everything was ready for the installation due to take place on the following day.

* * * * *

Li arrived exactly on time, and practically before she had time to think, Kate was on her way to the barbecue site. By this time she was a little more used to the traffic, but she was glad she was not driving. Bicycles were everywhere, and cars jammed bumper to bumper, but fortunately it took only minutes to reach the park, which was close to the airport rail link terminal, and full of tourist attractions.

The spacious barbecue site was between the entrance to the park and a large lake, and there were numerous picnic tables and shelters set up between the rows of roasting pits. Kate felt quite at home! She knew immediately that this was a very well planned facility. Just as she had hoped, the Advanced Real Meat Acquisition Machine was to be set up on a raised concrete plinth in the centre of the barbecue area and clearly visible from all sides. As they drew closer she noticed that there were steps all round the plinth, and a ramp on either side, to make access easier for a team of attendants carrying a spitroast. The flat top of the plinth had a wide path of polished granite all around, and a concrete base in the centre.

&#8216;What do you think, Miss Kate,&#8217; Li enquired.

&#8216;This is simply breathtaking, Mr Wang,&#8217; she replied. &#8216;It&#8217;s fantastic.&#8217;

&#8216;I wanted the site to be as close as possible to a road and a Metro station, for people to arrive and waste disposed of. If the site is busy there will be a lot of waste every day.&#8217;

&#8216;Are you planning to keep it open all the time?&#8217; She asked.

&#8216;No, the park is normally closed after dark, although we have a special permit to keep the barbecue area open during normal restaurant hours. The problem is the cooking time. We will have to stop meat acquisition during the evening, or some of the piglets will not be fully cooked when we close.&#8217;

&#8216;Why did you choose this particular park?&#8217;

&#8216;This is the only park big enough, near enough to the city centre, with good Metro links and facilities for large numbers of customers. The Meat Acquisition initiative is supported very strongly by the government. Otherwise I don&#8217;t think they would have let us use the park.&#8217;

&#8216;What time is the machine arriving?&#8217;

&#8216;Early in the morning. We can&#8217;t begin to set it up before 8 a.m. because the park is used for Tai Chi in the mornings, and we would disturb the concentration of people taking exercise. We can arrive at about 8:30. We should have plenty of time to set it up before midday.&#8217;

&#8216;Midday?&#8217;

&#8216;Oh, that&#8217;s when the first girls will arrive to help us to test the machine. You have already met some of them.&#8217;

&#8216;Ah. I see.&#8217;

&#8216;Don&#8217;t pre-judge them. I think you will find that they have very clear ideas, not to mention sexual preferences of their own.&#8217;

&#8216;I don&#8217;t understand. I thought your people were very reserved in sexual matters.&#8217;

&#8216;That&#8217;s exactly the point. We were, but now that girlmeat is a staple food almost as important as rice, they are far less reticent about their sexual preferences, and they love to show off their bodies. Nudity is definitely not a problem. I will expect to see a lot of girls wanting to show off their bodies on a roasting spit.&#8217;

Kate grinned. That sounded familiar! It was dawning on her that this was all going to be a lot more fun than she had expected. She might even ask Li to extend her stay, if all went well at the Opening Ceremony.

Something he said had aroused her curiosity though.

&#8216;Apart from nudity, what sexual preferences do you mean?&#8217;

&#8216;In our society, in the past, practices such as body piercing and BDSM were not tolerated. The leadership regarded such practices as elitist, and subversive of good order in society. That is exactly why many women regard them as an expression of personal freedom today. After Real Meat Acquisition became an integral part of the Five Year Plan, the government withdrew its opposition to certain practices that were seen as conducive to achieving the Plan&#8217;s targets.&#8217;

&#8216;You mean, Real Meat Acquisition is already in the Five Year Plan?&#8217;

&#8216;My dear Miss Kate, you cannot think that I could have negotiated an agreement with your company if it had not had political support?&#8217;

&#8216;I suppose not, and you can&#8217;t attach a meat tag without a piercing.&#8217;

&#8216;Exactly, but you will also see other kinds of piercing, like Tania&#8217;s ring through the ridge of her clitoris hood. Some women have pierced nipples, tongues, navels etc.&#8217;

&#8216;Right. And what about BDSM?&#8217;

&#8216;When women began to talk more openly about their physical needs, dreams and sexual preferences, they discovered that it was quite normal for a girl to become aroused when she even thought about being punished with a whip or a cane, and the real thing was even better. So BDSM has become quietly accepted as a social habit. Women find that it makes almost any kind of sex more exciting.&#8217;

&#8216;I&#8217;m sure they are right about that!&#8217; Kate answered, feeling a familiar warmth pervading her pussy at the mere thought of it.

Li grinned at her rather obvious discomfiture.

&#8216;So we understand each other. I hope you will understand our girls just as well.&#8217;

&#8216;I&#8217;m sure I will.&#8217;

&#8216;Well, Miss Kate, I think you should be getting back to your hotel.&#8217;

&#8216;Thank you, Mr Wang. I will be glad to catch up on my sleep.&#8217;

Kate was barely conscious of the ten minute journey back to the hotel. She was tired, contented but also extraordinarily excited by what they had talked about, and the events that were due to take place on the following day.

&#8216;Miss Kate, I am so glad you came. I will pick you up at eight in the morning.&#8217;

&#8216;Thank you so much, Mr Wang. You have done a wonderful job here.&#8217;

&#8216;Thank you, Miss Kate. Goodnight.&#8217;

&#8216;Goodnight, Mr Wang.&#8217;

She had a shower and retired to bed, where she fell asleep immediately.

In the morning she woke up refreshed, even energetic. It was tempting to try the local coffee, or one of the local rice based breakfast cereals, but she adhered to her usual diet of Fibre-Flossï¿½. It felt good, and it always made her feel more in tune with the girls who were processed on her machines. It also let her imagine that she might become one of them, some day.

Li was in a particularly good mood when he picked her up. It was a fine sunny morning, and Kate felt very excited. Today the very first of her new machines would be set up and running, here, on another continent.

A small group of workmen were waiting by the plinth with a crane and two large crates. Kate grinned in surprise. The crates were marked ï¿½ARMATI Kate 1ï¿½. It was sweet of the engineers to name the machine after her. There was also an ARMATI Technician waiting to help unpack the machine.

Li signalled to the crew and they opened the crates with claw hammers. One crate held the Spitting Engine, and the other held the Block. Once the crates were open, the technician set to work removing the rods that kept the mechanism safe and undamaged during the long journey.

Then it was time to set the machine in position. The workmen fastened rope loops under each part of the machine. One by one the crane lifted them into position. The technician directed the crane operator to lower the bases carefully onto the bolts that projected upwards from the plinth. He used a torque wrench to fasten the nuts tightly, then fitted covers over them.

Kate&#8217;s heart thudded as the moment drew closer when the machine would be ready. Prominently on the side of each part was a plate with ï¿½ARMATI Kate 1ï¿½ and a serial number. The machine gleamed invitingly. It was smooth, beautiful. She watched the technician set up the height measuring rod and callipers on the side of the spitting engine. It was nice to imagine the feel of the calliper sliding up to press into her slit.

The power connections were sturdy looking, for outdoor use. When he connected the power, Kate saw a small green light illuminate in the base of the Block. There did not seem to be an ï¿½Offï¿½ switch. Kate grinned. Give a girl an ï¿½Offï¿½ switch and she can try the machine in perfect safety, which means a zero acquisition rate. There was also a Remote Control, but it was locked in a compartment in the Spitting Engine, where the public could not get to it.

The installation went very smoothly, but it was still almost midday when it was finished. The technician had run the setup checks, and there were no problems, so he put the Remote Control away, and gave the compartment key to Li.

&#8216;Miss Kate, congratulations! It looks as though we are on schedule.&#8217;

&#8216;Thank you, Mr Wang. I had no idea they had named the machine after me. I suppose that explains why the engineering department was so mysterious about it. They wouldn&#8217;t let me see it before it was shipped!&#8217;

&#8216;My dear Miss Kate, there are so many of your ideas in it, I&#8217;m sure it was the right thing to do. When I spoke to Jim he said that they worked very hard to make this the best machine ever, and I&#8217;m sure it will be a great success!&#8217;

&#8216;I certainly hope so, Mr Wang, but until we have actually tested it on some of your girls over here, I&#8217;m still going to worry a little bit. This is the first time we&#8217;ve done anything like this outside America, although you were kind enough to send us a few girls as a sample, and the engineers told me that the testing went very well.&#8217;

The familiar, pleasant smell of barbecue fires was all around by the time the group of Acquisition Test girls arrived a few moments before midday, all wearing those pretty looking dresses slit up to the thighs. Kate had a strong suspicion that they were wearing nothing at all underneath, and as they moved she caught glimpses of erect nipples tenting the filmy fabric. As one of them turned she also noticed a glint of bright metal between her legs. She grinned. That particular girl was evidently there to test Li&#8217;s favourite feature! They had also brought a long, narrow carrying case with them. Kate was curious.

&#8216;I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll be glad to show you what they have in that bag,&#8217; Li told her, and said something to the girls in his own language.

The girl with the bag opened it to display its contents. Oh! Kate thought. Li was quite serious about the BDSM angle. There was a long, pure white and slender cane, some very springy looking, long and thin bamboo rods, and serious looking whips with leather handles. One was a cat-of-nine-tails with knotted leather lashes, another had lashes of braided silk. It was a serious looking collection!

&#8216;Why did they bring these?&#8217; She asked.

&#8216;They are not used to the idea of this kind of machine,&#8217; Li answered. &#8216;They think a girl will need some special encouragement to activate the clamps. I think they are going to be rather pleasantly surprised!&#8217;

&#8216;I see,&#8217; Kate answered, laughing. &#8216;I&#8217;m sure you are right about that.&#8217; All the same, she thought, it was an idea that could add a certain spice to the proceedings, not to mention speeding things up!

The girls seemed to have chosen who was going to be first, with a lot of laughing and teasing, and one stepped forward. She looked very shy, Kate thought until she saw the fire in her eyes. She gave a cheeky looking smile, and without a sign of self-consciousness she lifted the tunic over her head, stepped out of her shoes and approached the machine.

Her skin was creamy smooth, and the curves of her body were very sexy indeed, with firm but tiny nipples like pink berries and a neat, hairless slit that looked far too small to accommodate the thick shaft of a spit, but Kate knew better. Pussies were made to stretch, and spits were made to stretch them. She grinned. This was going to be fun.

Li directed the girl to the height measuring scale, and she pressed the button. The callipers moved smoothly into position, one lowered to the top of her head, and the other rising to her crotch. There was a quiet whirring as the block moved into the optimum configuration for the size of her body, the leg grooves rising to suit her relatively short legs.

On the machine, the girl knelt in the grooves that separated her legs, and leaned over the block. The chin rest was perfectly positioned. She loved the feel of the smooth metal block against her body, but where did her wrists go? She reached down on either side of the block and felt the grooves ready to receive her arms, but was there something she was supposed to do after that? In the briefing the girls had been told to just relax and let the machine do the work.

It was then that she felt it. A slender vibrating rod touched her pussy lips. She gasped with excitement, forgetting to be careful with her wrists. CLICK! Damn, she thought, this is so intoxicating. She pulled tentatively at the clamps, but she was utterly immobilised. The helmet lowered onto her head and the pleasure cycle began. She panted, gasping as the neural feedback brought her in seconds to a climax so powerful that she screamed, her orgasms growing, exploding through her body until she was weak, satiated and still it continued.

Suddenly there was something else, something hard and sharp was moving slowly between her pussy lips. So that&#8217;s how it feels, she thought, adjusting her position minutely to centre the spit on her vulva. It parted her lips, and opened her like a flower. She felt her cunt stretch to accommodate the thickness of the shaft, and then it was in her belly, slipping between her entrails, merciless, unrelenting. Her soft young body gave no resistance at all to its progress. Then it was in her throat and moments later she saw the point emerge from her open mouth.

She struggled tentatively, but she could barely move on the rigid shaft. Hands bound her to the spit, and carrying handles lifted it onto the shoulders of the firepit attendants. She felt the shaft in her cunt. Her vulva muscles clenched it as they ran with her spitted body to the roasting pit. The movement brought another powerful climax. The heat was impossibly intense as she began to turn over the flames. So now I am meat, she thought. But I have always been meat.

The group had followed the attendants to see the girl&#8217;s body set on to roast. Kate was pleased. It had all gone very well indeed. That small vibrating probe was a nice touch. That was another feature the engineers had not mentioned to her!

Li was also very pleased. It was a good test. The girl had no idea what was going to happen. The others might think they were not going to be quite so easy, but there were more surprises in store for them!

The tests continued. As instructed, the girls all tried to avoid activating the clamps but they all succumbed to one distraction or another. Kate enjoyed herself as one by one, the special features worked exactly as intended. When it came to the girl with the pubic ring, she managed to avoid being caught for a good thirty seconds before the steel loop of the ring catcher sealed her to the block. There was a lot of pointing and chattering from the other girls, some who had similar rings excited at the prospect of being caught like that, but all unsure what she had actually done to activate the ring catcher.

By this time the remaining girls had seen for themselves that whatever a girl did, the machine always seemed to have an answer. If there was a way to avoid being caught, they had no idea what it was. Somehow that excited them even more. In the end, even if a girl delayed the inevitable, they decided, she could always be &#8216;helped&#8217; by a few distracting strokes of a whip or a cane.

Li was amused by their conversation. Watching a friend struggle desperately with the machine, they might have been expected to cheer the girl on, but instead they seemed to be wanting the machine to win every time. The more it succeeded, the more it seemed to have a personality of its own, and the more they wanted to try it for themselves. Their reaction was exactly what he had been hoping for.

While they were busy inaugurating the machine, and just as importantly, getting some meat on to cook for the evening&#8217;s celebrations, workmen were busy setting up rows of seats in a semicircle around the machine, with a small podium for the speakers to one side of the spitting engine, where it would not obscure the view of the girls on the block.

* * * * *

There were VIP guests invited from central and local government, the Ministry of Agriculture, and a few foreign diplomats. Dozens of girls were there from the Real Meat Guild. The rest of the seating was for journalists, and live broadcast teams from State television and international news media. Photographers milled about.

Kate was enjoying the feeling of being the centre of attention. Li had told her to prepare a speech, which was almost as scary as being asked to test the machine. She smiled. Now that was a wicked thought, but where had it come from?

Eventually everybody had taken their seats, except the photographers, of course. They were a law unto themselves, but you could hardly expect them to take pictures sitting down in a nice row of seats, could you! It was important to mark the occasion with pictures taken from every possible angle, as long as they didn&#8217;t obstruct the view of everybody else.

Up on the podium the Chairman introduced her in English.

&#8216;Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me much pleasure to introduce Miss Kate Graham, who has made Real Meat Acquisition an attractive, efficient and exciting process. I think we are all looking forward to her talk, and the demonstration to folllow.&#8217;

&#8216;Thank you very much, Miss Wei. I feel very privileged to be here at the beginning of large scale, state of the art Meat Acquisition in your country. This technology is now well established in the West because it gives such important consideration to the feelings of the woman being processed. It is fast, humane and efficient.&#8217;

&#8216;The key to its success is that piglets - er - girls choose themselves to mount the machine, which requires very little attention other than replenishing the spits from time to time. Once the girl has activated the machine, she can relax and enjoy the most powerful succession of orgasms she has ever experienced before the spit is run and, except in rare cases, she will be alive and able to experience the most exquisite sensations while she is being roasted.&#8217;

&#8216;The machine can be activated in a number of ways. If you watch this video clip, you will see the girl pressing her wrists into the clamps, which lock immediately. The pleasure cycle then begins, and when her pleasure reaches its maximum intensity the spit is activated. The speed of the spit is controlled to cause the girl minimum internal damage.&#8217;

&#8216;Advanced models of spitting machine have developed considerably over the past few years, with features like a pleasure cycle with neural feedback. In most cases they are activated when a girl pressed her wrists into pressure sensitive clamps. Those machines run very smoothly, with very little maintenance. Spits have to be replenished from time to time, and the roasting pits also need constant attention, but they do an excellent job. They spit the girls smoothly and deliver them directly to the roasting pit, but they are not designed for Meat Acquisition.&#8217;

&#8216;It&#8217;s far too easy for a girl to mount the machine, enjoy the feel of it for a while and then walk away. She has to make a conscious, deliberate movement to lock the clamps. Often it is several minutes before the temptation became so strong that she can&#8217;t resist the temptation, or in the excitement she does it accidentally. Although most of the girls are spitted in the end, it takes far too long. A typical unattended machine processes only three or four girls per hour, which is a very low return on investment for a Meat Acquisition machine.&#8217;

&#8216;We did learn a lot from those machines. Girls who activate the machine do it out of curiosity, excitement or even just a momentary impulse, especially if the excitement leads to an orgasm, when she might do so accidentally. Distractions such as corporal punishment could also cause her to activate the machine by accident, but that requires an attendant or companion.&#8217;

&#8216;I realised that there was something missing from the process. It was like most things created by men for women. Deep subconscious desires attract women to the machine, but it was far too passive. A woman wants her own body and mind to be helped in a subtle way towards that final step. She wants it to happen without conscious effort. Most of all, she doesn&#8217;t want to be disappointed. That would be rather like lying naked in a man&#8217;s bed, and not getting screwed.&#8217;

Laughter greeted this remark, and Kate continued.

&#8216;Men often see a spitting machine as a functional piece of cooking equipment, but if it is properly designed, it can be something that makes our dreams come true. We want excitement, not disappointment, and nothing is more exciting than the moment of surprise when you discover that you have triggered the machine, you are utterly helpless, and the pleasure cycle is about to begin. Yes, ladies, every one of our machines will bring you to the ultimate peak of pleasure before it runs the spit through you from your pussy to your mouth. It will fill your pussy, and over the heat of the roasting pit you will be silent as you perform your final dance.&#8217;

&#8216;If you mount one of my machines, I want you to be taken though all kinds of feelings like excitement, pleasure, panic, desperation, even love and fulfilment, but you will not be rejected or disappointed. When your body begins to respond to the machine, it will take you comfortably, easily to where you are destined to go. You may have some natural resistance at first, but it will soon disappear.&#8217;

&#8216;These are not just spitting machines. They are Advanced Real Meat Acquisition Machines. They are there to collect your meat and deliver it to the barbecue pit, ready to roast. I want the machine and the process to look so attractive and exciting that you can&#8217;t resist the temptation to see how it feels for yourself, and when you discover the surprise, I want you to enjoy the moment, and experience the ultimate level of pleasure and excitement for as long as the process lasts.&#8217;

&#8216;Some of you might want me to explain how the machines work, but I was told how intelligent you are, and after seeing some of you in action, I am sure of it!&#8217;

More laughter.

&#8216;I&#8217;m sure you can work that out for yourselves, but I&#8217;m going to give you a little help with a demonstration, in a few minutes time.&#8217;

&#8216;The entertainment is part of the attraction. It looks like nothing more than a bit of risky fun. Even when you see girls spitted one after the other, you don&#8217;t want to believe that it will happen to you. You mount the block. It feels smooth and warm, and it matches the contours of your body. You know what it will do if you activate the clamps, but you don&#8217;t believe that it will really happen. Those other girls were silly, and lost control, and it was all their fault.&#8217;

&#8216;It is seductive and exciting, even a little scary to know that your pussy is perfectly positioned to receive the spit, but nothing is holding you to the block. You can get up and walk away. There is nothing to fear. The machine is unmoving, inert. If you are careful, nothing is going to happen. Perhaps you are going to be roasted on a spit, but not this one, not today, you might think.&#8217;

&#8216;You test the feel of it, intoxicated by the danger. Something about your position, or just a tiny movement triggers the clamps. You gasp with shocked surprise. This was not supposed to happen. You have been seduced, and now you cannot move. There is a strange feeling in the pit of your stomach. This is not a game any more.&#8217;

&#8216;Pleasure is a weapon that you can&#8217;t resist. In seconds you are screaming with one orgasm after another. You cannot fight it, but you know how it will end.&#8217;

&#8216;Something annoyingly sharp touches your pussy lip. You make a little movement to ease the discomfort. The spit slides between your lips and into your cunt, but it doesn&#8217;t stop there. You endure the pain until it emerges from your mouth. You are silenced forever. Meat has no need to communicate. Your pain will not be shared. You will be roasted, and your succulent, tasty meat will feed many hungry people. You finally understand that this is what you are. The outcome was never in any doubt. You are just girlmeat on a well engineered spitroast production line.&#8217;

&#8216;You explore the feel of your spit. Your body cannot bend, but when you shift your position the sensations are amazing as your cunt moves up and down on the spit. Pleasure blossoms and explodes in another powerful climax. And then you feel the heat. Raw pain penetrates your skin. Sweat, and then fat drips from your body. Gradually your consciousness fades, and there is nothing more to feel, or to fear.&#8217;

&#8216;Of course this is only speculation. A spitroast cannot tell its story, but observing Real Meat Acquisition many thousands of times does tell us something, and I can imagine how I might feel in its place. The only true answer is to experience Real Meat Acquisition for yourself.&#8217;

&#8216;In testing in North America, where there was sufficient capacity to meet demand, seventeen out of twenty girls who saw a machine in action came forward afterwards to try it, and out of those who did, acquisition was successful on nineteen out of twenty. New features we have included in this machine might even improve on that acquisition rate.&#8217;

&#8216;Earlier today we set up this machine, and tested it on some charming volunteers. It proved every bit as successful as we had expected. The rate of Meat Acquisition was a hundred percent overall, after several test runs. You will have noticed that there is meat roasting already in the barbecue area. Those are the lovely girls who helped us to test the machine, and others amongst you are waiting eagerly to take their turn.&#8217;

&#8216;I am sure you will all welcome the woman-friendly emphasis this new technology represents, and I look forward to seeing it in action in your country.&#8217;

&#8216;Finally, I want to thank Mr Li Ho Wang for his very persuasive invitation to come here and talk to you today, and our Chairman, Mr Wei, for hosting this meeting.&#8217;

Advanced Real Meat Acquisition Technologies - Conclusion

ï¿½ Spitman, April 2008

Loud applause followed her as she returned to her seat on the podium, and the Chairman returned to the microphone.

&#8216;We are very grateful to Miss Kate Graham for her fascinating and most erudite presentation on the Advanced Real Meat Acquisition Technology. I am sure we are all looking forward to seeing it in action at first hand.&#8217;

&#8216;Before that, if any of you have questions for Miss Graham, we will take them now.

A forest of hands shot up.

&#8216;Miss Graham,&#8217; an elegantly dressed woman two rows back began, &#8216;what do you think is the greatest obstacle to the success of your machines in our country?&#8217;

Kate returned to the microphone.

&#8216;I must be frank,&#8217; she began. &#8216;Before I came here I knew that you had cultural difficulties with nudity, but meat does not need clothing. The whole process is a display of the most intimate sexuality, but I was very pleased by the girls who helped us to test the machine this morning, who showed no nervousness at all. They seemed to enjoy being naked in public.&#8217;

&#8216;Miss Graham,&#8217; the questioner answered.&#8217; Thank you for your frankness, but what you observed this morning is very typical of girls today. Being &#8216;on the menu&#8217;, so to speak, has removed those traditional inhibitions, and today there is no problem. If you agree, we can put this to the test?&#8217;

&#8216;By all means,&#8217; Kate replied, curious to know what she was suggesting.

&#8216;Ladies!&#8217; The woman announced. &#8216;Let&#8217;s show Miss Graham how relaxed we are about nudity these days! I would like you all to remove your clothes, right now!&#8217;

To Kate&#8217;s surprise, they all removed their clothes, and Kate felt that she had no option but to follow suit. Once the women were all facing her, grinning happily, Kate took stock. No matter where you are in the world, women are beautiful. They might be a little shorter, their breasts might be smaller and their pubic slits higher, lower, plumper or narrower, but their skin was smoother, and she could easily visualise them all as attractive looking spitroasts. There were no signs of body hair at all, just glistening wet slits and prettily erected nipple buds. Several of them wore pubic rings just like Tania&#8217;s. Li Wang must have been busy with his &#8217;mass vaccination&#8217; program!

Kate&#8217;s own nudity was getting plenty of appreciation. Her tall, well toned body had firm, shapely breasts by American standards, with invitingly erect nipples, and a meat tag through one of her nicely formed, smoothly curved pussy lips. As she turned to expose the meat stamp on her bottom the murmuring grew louder. In Xhi Dong tagging was mandatory, but they had not expected that of such a distinguished visitor.

&#8216;Thank you very much for the demonstration, ladies. I am most impressed!&#8217; She said, with a laugh. There were tinkles of laughter all over the room as women dressed again. Laughter was universal, she thought.

&#8216;Can I have the next question?&#8217;

&#8216;Miss Graham,&#8217; a small but nicely rounded woman began, &#8216;if we keep still, do we still get spitted?&#8217;

&#8216;What I can tell you,&#8217; Kate replied, &#8216;is that if you don&#8217;t get spitted, you didn&#8217;t move, but it&#8217;s not as simple as that. It&#8217;s about position, not just movement.&#8217;

&#8216;Miss Graham,&#8217; another girl asked, &#8216;will we need a permit to use the machine?&#8217;

&#8216;I think I&#8217;ll let the panel answer that one.&#8217;

A member of the City Council stepped forward.

&#8216;We are at the early stages of this program,&#8217; he answered. &#8216;Up till now, real meat processing has not been regulated, but that is going to change. On the advice of an American organisation, we have set up a new department in the Ministry of Agriculture to handle the regulation of real meat quality, acquisition, processing and humane treatment. It is also responsible for a five year plan with targets for real meat production, quality and yield, and the management of surpluses.&#8217;

&#8216;Up till now there has been no organised system for inspection and registration, but as some of you will know, a month ago we formed an inspectorate which has already inspected and registered several thousand girls for immediate processing, yourselves included. If you are registered, and you have been on the required diet for at least four days, you do not require an additional permit to use the machine.&#8217;

&#8216;If acquisition fails, you are then exempt from processing, and your tag number will be cancelled.&#8217;

&#8216;Thank you, Sir,&#8217; she answered.

&#8216;Miss Graham,&#8217; another girl asked, &#8216;After we get onto the machine, how long does it take before we are spitted and taken away to be roasted?&#8217;

&#8216;That depends on the particular machine, and how easy you are,&#8217; Kate answered.

&#8216;Meat acquisition machines are not built for speed. They are designed to give an exciting experience, and an attractive show. If you get lucky you might have several minutes of fun before you trigger it, but some girls do it in seconds. The only sure thing is that you won&#8217;t expect it when it happens. The pleasure cycle is also very hard to predict. If you respond easily and quickly, it could take seconds, but if your pleasure builds up slowly it could take minutes.&#8217;

&#8216;After you mount the machine, it might take between five and eight minutes before you are on your way to the roasting pit. Does that answer your question?&#8217;

&#8216;Oh yes, Miss Graham. Thank you very much.&#8217;

&#8216;Miss Graham,&#8217; another girl asked, &#8216;If I am wriggling about in an orgasm, could the spit miss my pussy entrance and hurt me?&#8217;

&#8216;That is a very good question. The spit moves at a variable speed, but when it enters you it is going quite slowly, only five millimetres per second. That gives you a chance to react when it first touches you. Instinctively you will adjust your position to centre it perfectly. We all have that instinct, so there is no need to worry. Your body will do that for you, automatically. As the spit opens you up and penetrates deeper, your cunt will act as a firm, secure sleeve on the shaft, holding you rigidly in the correct alignment, so it can&#8217;t go astray.&#8217;

&#8216;I see. Thank you, Miss Graham.&#8217;

&#8216;Miss Graham, I was wondering, did you ever think of trying one of those machines yourself? If you know all about the machine, can it still work on you?&#8217;

&#8216;I was wondering when I was going to get a question like that. The answer is, I really don&#8217;t know. Of course I like the machines. I love the whole idea of the machines, and I am just as tempted to try one as any other girl. Perhaps one day I will, and no matter how well I think I know what the machine will do, I can&#8217;t know for certain what my own body will do. I might be just as vulnerable as any other girl, or not, but I can&#8217;t possibly know.&#8217;

&#8216;Many people think of it as a physical and psychological battle between you and the machine and the machine&#8217;s designers, but it is really a battle between your own body and your mind, and the outcome depends on how well you can control yourself. Knowing about a feature does not mean that you can escape it. Some features cannot easily be escaped, because that is the way your body works, and mine as well, but that type of feature is really a last resort. It is far better to give a girl every chance, see her surprise when she makes a crucial mistake, and then let her have the satisfaction of knowing exactly how she was caught.&#8217;

&#8216;Miss Graham!&#8217; the Chairman said. &#8216;I am most grateful for your answers. It has all been most interesting, and I&#8217;m sure everybody will agree.&#8217;

There was another burst of applause, and the audience stood and cheered.

&#8216;And now we come to the most important part of our Opening Ceremony today. Miss Graham is going to demonstrate her machine, and Mr Wang will translate if she needs any help, as he is quite familiar with the technology.&#8217;

&#8216;OK Girls, who wants to be first?&#8217;

A forest of hands shot up. Kate grinned. The girls left over from the earlier testing were right at the front, eager to be chosen, but she had another idea. She pointed to a girl in the second row.

&#8216;You, in the blue dress!&#8217;

Obediently the smiling girl stepped up to the plinth.

&#8216;Put your clothes in the basket, and step up here!&#8217;

She was slim, with smooth, creamy skin, soft gentle curves and tiny nipples, firm round buds in a delicate shade of pink, perched precariously on her breasts. The neat shadow of her slit ran down from a deep, dimple-like depression, giving the impression of a prettily rounded keyhole, but the prettiest thing was her smile.

&#8216;How do you feel about what is going to happen?&#8217; Kate asked, and waited for Li to translate, but the girl answered in excellent English.&#8217;

&#8216;I am honoured to be chosen, Miss Graham,&#8217; she answered, bowing deeply.

&#8216;You do understand that this is a spitting machine, and if it works properly, you are going to be roasted today?&#8217;

&#8216;Yes, Miss Graham. I know. It is my preference, spitting and roasting.&#8217;

&#8216;Why is that?&#8217; Kate asked curiously.

&#8216;Spitting girls look very nice, smooth skin not get cut,&#8217; she answered.

&#8216;I see. You mean, you want to be processed whole, and not cooked in pieces like at the butcher or on a processing line?&#8217;

The girl nodded vigorously. Well, that makes sense, Kate thought.

&#8216;All right. Please step up here to be measured.&#8217;

She stepped up to the measuring station.

&#8216;Stand here, with your feet flat on the ground!&#8217;

&#8216;Yes, Miss Graham.&#8217;

Kate pressed the button. The callipers slid down to her head and up to her pussy, and there was a whirring sound and the machine adjusted itself slightly.

&#8216;Now you can mount the machine. Good luck!&#8217;

Eagerly she knelt in the grooves and bent forward over the block.

&#8216;Ooooh!&#8217; She breathed. It felt wonderful. She explored the feel of the smooth steel block against her body. She was heady with excitement. The grooves for her wrists were down there somewhere. She reached down, tingling with pleasure, fumbling unsteadily. CLICK! She could not move. She was utterly helpless.

She struggled uselessly as the pleasure mechanism settled into position. It felt very nice at first, stirring gentle waves of pleasure, but then the neural feedback lifted the pleasure to a peak, then another, and the more it increased the more her responses fed back and the more powerful the sensations became. She screamed in helpless convulsions until she could scream no more.

It was cool, sharply pointed and a little annoying when it touched her slippery wet pussy lips. Instinctively she tilted her hips to ease its entrance, and millimetre by millimetre it opened her pussy. She squeezed it desperately with her vulva but in moments the thickness of the shaft had filled her cunt, and still it moved forward, unyielding and unstoppable. She was frantic with excitement. The spit was coming through her meat and there was nothing she could do to stop it. The movement of the spit into her tightly stretched pussy brought indescribable sensations, building to another distracting convulsion of pleasure, then another.

In a rare moment of clarity she heard applause, and smiled. She was proud to be chosen to represent her city and her country on such an auspicious occasion. Miss Graham must surely be pleased with her performance, even if she had seen other girls do the same a thousand times. There were no rehearsals, but girls all had the same choreographer. Responding to a spit was surely a natural, primeval instinct. She had learned that at school, and it was surely true.

She felt the spit rising towards her throat. She coughed, feeling the point advance over her tongue, and then it was out of her mouth. She wriggled tentatively, and pleasure blossomed again. Expert hands were busy binding her limbs to the spit, they attached the handles to the spit and she felt herself lifted by the attendants who carried her towards the roasting pits at a run, to enthusiastic applause.

&#8216;Ladies and gentlemen!&#8217; Kate announced.

&#8216;That was a proud, brave and very pretty girl. I&#8217;m sure though, that you noticed how easily she was distracted. A little carelessness, and those clamps locked long before they might have, but there were compensations. She had a wonderful ride, and many of you might not do so well.'

The next girl was a lot more careful, very hesitant indeed to allow her wrists near the clamps, but after a few seconds the slim vibrating probe found her slit. In a few seconds she was gasping with excitement, utterly distracted and a moment later, CLICK! She was caught. Her screaming, wriggling progress through the pleasure cycle was entertaining, and there was a lot of chattering as the other girls saw the spit running through her stll convulsing body

Kate remembered the following girl from the earlier session. Nude, there was a gleam of gold between her lips. Kate grinned. This was going to be fun.

The girl mounted the machine and leaned over cautiously into position, taking care with her hands. She squirmed about for a few seconds, enjoying it immensely, but suddenly the ring lock activated and she was caught, the ring pulling at the ridge of her clitoris hood as she struggled, bringing flashes of pleasure. She felt a climax coming, and she writhed helplessly, accidentally triggering the clamps. It was over. Three girls in little more than ten minutes, Kate thought. Perhaps it all looked a bit too easy. Once the girls had seen it a few times, this was not going to continue.

&#8216;Now who is going to be next?&#8217; She asked, and the forest of hands went up again.

She indicated a very fashionable looking girl with spiky ginger hair.

&#8216;Right, you are next. Come up here!&#8217; She told her.

The girl couldn&#8217;t wait to show herself off, and tossed her clothes quickly into the basket. What a body! For an Asian girl she had a magnificent cleavage, and her nipples were pierced with silver bars. Her expensive looking hair style suited her elfen face perfectly. She was also quite athletic looking, with plenty of meat on her, most of it in exactly the right places.

&#8216;What do you think about all this?&#8217; Kate asked.

The girl looked around, bathing in the appreciation of the crowd.

&#8216;That&#8217;s a fantastic machine,&#8217; she said in excellent English. &#8216;It looks like fun.&#8217;

&#8216;Well, I hope it is, young lady, but it also has a serious purpose. Are you prepared for that?&#8217;

The girl laughed. &#8216;Oh no, I&#8217;m not going to let it get me. I&#8217;m going to be careful. I&#8217;m going to be the one who walks away and then never gets spitted!&#8217;

&#8216;Why do you think you are going to succeed?&#8217;

&#8216;I&#8217;m a computer scientist. Programming, that stuff. PhD if it means anything. I do logic that works machines, so I should be able to figure out this one.&#8217;

&#8216;I see,&#8217; Kate answered, amused. &#8216;Well, you are welcome to try. Good luck!&#8217;

She indicated the measuring station. The girl walked up nonchalantly, stood up against the scale and pressed the button. She was a little taller than the previous girl, judging by the machine&#8217;s automatic adjustments.

She walked over casually to the machine. A real show girl, this one, Kate thought as she settled into position, hugging the block as if she wanted to take it home, but keeping her hands carefully away from the clamps.

Nothing happened for a few seconds, but then Kate saw the thin vibrating probe advancing towards her pussy. When it slid between her lips the girl gasped, but kept her composure as her body responded.

&#8216;Nice, that!&#8217; The girl said audibly. &#8216;Thermal sensors to know I&#8217;m here, then if I don&#8217;t move for a preset time delay, it starts to tease my clit. Maybe it thinks that if I have an orgasm I&#8217;ll lose it. No chance! I know exactly what&#8217;s going on.&#8217;

&#8216;Not bad, girl,&#8217; Kate told her with a grin.

&#8216;If there are heat sensors, I expect you have them in the clamps as well, so I&#8217;ll be rather careful about that,&#8217; the girl said insolently.

At this point the bucking mechanism kicked in, but the girl seemed to know how to hold on without getting too close to the wrist clamps.

&#8216;I expect a lot of the girls fall for this,' the girl said, gasping.

&#8216;Yes, they often do,&#8217; Kate told her. &#8216;How long do you think you can hang on like that?&#8217;

&#8216;As long as it takes, Miss Graham!&#8217; She answered defiantly.

Politeness! What a surprise! It was the first time the girl had addressed her by name. She must be weakening, Kate thought, but it was time she showed a little respect.

The bucking stopped at last, and the girl panted in relief, but not for long. She felt a mild tingling in her nipples and then a powerful electrostatic charge zapped her pussy. She wriggled her hips wildly in response, but she still managed to keep her wrists out of the clamps.

&#8216;Cool! Electrostatic gun. Just what I&#8217;d have done next!&#8217; She said provocatively, gasping as the sensations gripped her pleasure button.

Kate was wondering if she was going to escape after all, when suddenly the girl yelled loudly, her hands flying towards her breasts, and of course, right into the clamps. CLICK! Kate heard, with much amusement.

&#8216;Damn, damn, damn, what was that?&#8217; The girl demanded angrily.

&#8216;Oh, I suppose it&#8217;s because you have all that metal in your nipples. A heat gun will usually do the trick; heats them up marvellously,&#8217; Kate told her. &#8216;They&#8217;ll feel pretty warm over the roasting pit, too, but it was your choice to wear them.&#8217;

&#8216;I suppose the pleasure cycle will be starting now,&#8217; the girl said bitterly, annoyed with herself. Why had she been so stupid! She asked herself rhetorically.

&#8216;Oh yes, immediately. You&#8217;ll see. If you&#8217;re interested, the buildup of pleasure is iterative and exponential,&#8217; Kate answered cheerfully. &#8216;That&#8217;s how the neural feedback works, but you&#8217;ll find that out for yourself. Most girls enjoy it.&#8217;

The pleasure mechanism was already in place over the girl&#8217;s pussy, and Kate saw her first gasping, jerking responses as the neural feedback gradually built up her pleasure until she screamed, convulsing helplessly in the throes of an orgasm that carried on building exponentially in those iterative waves. Poor girl, Kate thought, a little wickedly. How are the mighty fallen!

The trouble with the bright ones, Kate reflected, is that even if a girl is extremely well educated and highly logical, it is not her pussy that has the PhD. She might be able to control her thoughts, but her body will have entirely different ideas.

The audience had found the girl&#8217;s defiant behaviour highly entertaining, but they enjoyed her screams even more. Surely she deserved it, after showing such a lack of respect for the importance of the occasion. They all agreed that it had been a very good demonstration of what the machine could do, and some of them were already asking themselves how well Miss Graham would fare in a similar position.

The ginger-haired girl was followed by others who succumbed in succession to the various standard features, all seeming perfectly happy to donate their bodies in honour of the occasion. Kate thought it had worked out very well for the media as well. There had been lots of entertainment, and just the right amount of technical wizardry to keep an audience glued to the screen, but it was probably best to quit while she was ahead, and wind things up.

&#8216;Mr Chairman, that concludes the inaugural demonstration of Advanced Real Meat Acquisition Technology here in your country. We have shown that our machine can overcome even the most stubborn resistance, and the girls all enjoyed their ride on it. Ladies and Gentlemen, there will be a short interval now while the workmen clear away the seating, and the machine will then be available for general use. I suggest we all move on to the barbecue area.&#8217;

The Chairman stepped up to the microphone.

&#8216;Miss Kate, your machine is a masterpiece of invention, perhaps the only example of artistic design ever applied to such a task in our country. Without exception, members of our Real Meat Guild have demonstrated their eagerness to try it for themselves, and so far it has shown itself to be a match for any woman, however hard she has tried to defeat it.&#8217;

&#8216;That is very kind of you, Sir,&#8217; Kate answered, unccountably disconcerted.

&#8216;There is only one woman, we think, who might be a match for the machine, and that is you. We all agree on that.&#8217;

&#8216;M-me?&#8217; She answered, visibly quaking. They couldn&#8217;t be serious, could they. But then, she thought, there would never be a better time, with an audience of over a billion, to find out what she had often asked herself; would her body betray her, or would her inside knowledge enable her to defeat it. It was the ultimate test.&#8217;

&#8216;My dear Miss Kate,&#8217; he continued. &#8216;I think it is the moment for us all to find out.&#8217;

&#8216;Y-yes, Sir,&#8217; she answered, trembling.

Nothing like this would have happened in America, she thought. When you got called up for processing, there were no nice speeches. Either they sent a meat truck, or a message to report in somewhere. You did not have a choice. When your meat was wanted, they just turned up and collected it, or had you deliver yourself, and that was the end of it. There were no exceptions, not even the designer of some fancy meat processing machine. Television audiences had seen it all before. They would rather watch football, she thought ruefully, but here it was different. They were all eager and excited to see what was going to happen next. She caught a conspiratorial smile from Li. So this is why I am here, she realised. She wondered what other little surprises Li had conjured out of the engineers, but she would know, soon enough.

Her heart pounding, she came down from the podium to the steps of the plinth. She folded her clothes neatly and deposited them on the step. If she won, she might have earned herself immunity for ever, she thought.

Once she had set the machine to her size she mounted the block, It was pleasantly warm from its previous occupants, and surprisingly comfortable. Her breasts hung excitingly through the smoothly rounded cutouts. Not many of the girls over here had really tested that feature. Even her chin was comfortable, lifted on its padded rest. Like every girl, she was conscious of the alignment of her body for the wickedly pointed spit.

Her arms fell naturally into the grooves, just as she had intended. It was an effort not to relax and approach the clamps too closely. She was conscious of the heat sensors that did not require her to touch the metal. You only had to come close. Cleverly she tented her fingers to keep her wrists at a safe distance. She grinned. So far, so good! Just a minute or so longer and she could get off this thing, but it felt so good it was tempting to stay on it for a little longer, and hang the applause. This was about her, not them.

She was waiting for it, but still the slender vibrating probe made her gasp when it entered her slit. Determined, she stiffened her tented fingers, aware that her body was responding with an uncontrollable convulsion of pleasure, but she managed to hang on. The electrostatic gun was even worse, but she managed to hang on even through the cycle of bucking and twisting. This was going well, she thought, and when the bucking stopped she relaxed a little.

She gasped as a powerful suction pulled her wrists firmly into the clamps and they locked, CLICK! Where did that come from? Damn those engineers, she thought as the pleasure mechanism moved into position, and those wickedly teasing feelers brought her to an almost instant orgasm. Pleasure was rising, exploding through her body, overwhelming her senses and she was conscious of herself screaming in helpless response to the overpowering sensations.

The excited crowd applauded with enthusiasm. The Chairman was delighted to see that her machine had passed even this test. It was surely a match for any woman in the world. There was going to be an endless supply of succulent, delicious meat for months, even years. He licked his lips in anticipation.

Li was watching with enjoyment. She had not disappointed. Without those vacuum ports in the wrist clamps she might even have succeeded, but he thought not. She would have succumbed in the end, like all the others; perhaps not quite as easily as the others, but designing the vacuum ports as a backstop avoided any further delay to the inevitable. Kate was a stunning example of American meat, after all.

The hard, sharp tip of the spit made contact with her slit. She panicked. No, this can&#8217;t be happening, she thought for an instant before her hips instinctively tilted to ease its progress. She had seen spits run so many times that she could anticipate the tiniest instinctive movement of a girl&#8217;s body, but it was strangely exciting to be that body and know she was responding so predictably. It was like suddenly crossing a barrier and finding yourself on the other side, looking back at everything familiar.

She felt the spit at her throat and opened her mouth wide to let it emerge. She explored the feel of it tentatively as the attendants bound her to its length. It was a rigid presence, stiff, unbending. Her body was filled, distended, utterly helpless. Her heart thudded, She knew what was coming next as they fixed the carrying handles to the spit and set off at a run.

She knew it was going to be bad, but the heat was excruciating. It seared her skin, setting off explosions of sensation. She squirmed frantically on the shaft but there was no relief until the attendants set to work with the basting brushes, and even that only eased the fierceness of it. Her frantic squirming on the spit excited her, pleasure mingling with the awful sensation of heat penetrating deep into her tender meat. The climax just came, unbidden, a soothing, distracting relief.

The dignitaries were there, surrounding the roasting pit, beaming with pleasure. Bright lights illuminated her for the benefit of the cameras, but there was no relief from the powerful sensations that gripped her body.

Li was smiling too. He was holding up a paper for her to see. As she turned she managed to focus for long enough to take it in. It was a contract issued to ARMATI for five hundred more machines exactly like the one they had seen tested. Five hundred! She felt like yelling and jumping with excitement, but reality intruded. It was a prize she had not dared to hope for in her wildest dreams, but it had come at a price. Someone had to convince them that 100% Acquisition was a practical reality, and nobody else could have given such a convincing performance, she thought ruefully. It had been a very close thing, but now she was nothing more than interestingly flavoured American meat, to be sampled at their dinner. They had even named the machine after her in advance! They must have known what it would take to be certain of the outcome.

&#8216;Congratulations, Miss Kate,&#8217; he said quietly. &#8216;We are all very proud of you.&#8217;

The Chairman stepped up closer.

&#8216;Miss Kate,&#8217; he began. &#8216;We thank you for your selfless courage. Many members of our Meat Guild will be encouraged by your performance here today. The machine is already dedicated to you, but from today, this barbecue area will be known as Kate Park.&#8217;

Nice, Kate thought. I get a posthumous award for becoming their dinner! It was just as well she had no way to tell them what she thought about that. Ah! Ooooh! Undiplomatically the waves of pleasure convulsed her again. The Chairman smiled.

&#8216;I think we had better leave you to enjoy the rest of your ride!&#8217; He told her.

Li gave her a friendly pat as he left.

&#8216;It&#8217;s been a pleasure, Miss Kate,&#8217; he said.

Not as much as it&#8217;s been for me! It&#8217;s so nice to be here, being cooked over a really hot fire with a spit up my cunt, she felt like saying sarcastically, but he couldn&#8217;t be expected to understand. All he cared about was shifting boxes of machinery and getting rich, oh, and maybe a bit of kudos to go with it. The feelings of the girl who had made it all possible were the last thing on his mind, and after enjoying a bit of roasted Kate he would soon forget all about her. Or would he, she wondered.

Still, you couldn&#8217;t let it get you down. A girl was meat, after all. It had been a hell of a ride, she reflected as her consciousness finally faded.
