Synopsis:  A Dom subjects his sub to an evil little test to see how long it will be until she is allowed another orgasm.






Bernard called for Skyla to enter the bedroom. Yesterday, she had her first orgasm in 44 days. Today, Bernard would determine when her next one would be. It was always a tough test for her. He designed it that way, and she knew it. But it changed each time, something she would never expect and was not prepared for.
She hesitantly entered, unsure what he had planned for her this time. She was already stripped naked, as was expected in the house, revealing her perfect pale skin, devoid of hair anywhere on it. The lights were off, but candles were lit around the room, the aroma of wax and burnt wick filling the air. The bed was stripped of its blankets and pillows, covered by only a sheet. He looked her up and down, smiling, the predator getting ready to finish its prey.
�Are you ready for your test, my pet? You know your score will directly determine how long you must wait until your next orgasm. I hope you&#8217;ve prepared well!� He chuckled to himself softly.
Skyla gulped and took a deep breath. �I am ready, Master.�
�And so it begins. Lay flat on the bed, face up. Place your palms flat on the bed next to you. Spread your legs and keep your heels flat on the bed as well. You will maintain this position until I direct you otherwise. If any part of your body separates from the bed, a day will be added. But before you lay down�� He walked over to her and slipped a black blindfold over her eyes, completely obscuring her vision. �Ah, that&#8217;s better. Now get to it!� He snapped, suddenly quite serious.
She slid on to the bed, assuming the position exactly as commanded. He watched her chest rise and fall as she lay there, preferring to make her wait a little bit, enjoying just looking at his naked pet frozen on the bed, unable to see what he had planned. He picked up a leather single tail lash, dragging it over her stomach and breasts before swishing it through the air, watching her body go taut with each woosh as she prepared for it to make contact with her exposed skin. But the contact never came, and he put the lash back down.
He next picked up a flogger, one with thin rubber tails designed to be as stinging as possible. He let the ends of the tails fall upon her breasts, circling them slowly. As soon as she felt the cold rubber touch her, she knew what was coming. He rubbed it against her flesh slowly, and then started circling it slowly in the air, letting the rubber fall on her breasts, her stomach, her thighs, ever so slowly. Without warning, he delivered a quick hard shot to her leg, the rubber hitting the top of her legs and snapping against her thigh. Skyla reflexively gasped and flinched, her knee popping up just a little bit for only a moment.
�One.�
She grimaced. She had felt this flogger before, so she knew that this was not the main test for the day. And she had already had her first fuck up. She felt the rubber once again rubbing against her skin, coming down hard against her other leg, but she had learned over time how to keep herself still, and she kept herself down. She realized her training would be more important today than ever before.
Bernard smiled. She was ready. He started spinning the flogger faster and faster, crashing it against every inch of her skin from the tops of her breasts to the tops of her knees, moving up and down her body, watching it get redder and redder in the pale light, watching for even the slightest movement up off the bed from any part of her. But while she grimaced and gasped and yelped, her skin crawling with all of the stinging pain inflicted by the flogger, she managed to keep her body pinned to the bed &#8211; for the most part.
After a full two minutes of this &#8211; a warm up for him, an eternity for her &#8211; Bernard tossed the flogger aside. �Not bad, slut. You were doing quite well there for a while, but alas, your hips and shoulders started to lift off the bed by the end. As such, your total is now up to 6 days. Not bad�but not good either. And that was just the warm-up.�
Bernard watched Skyla&#8217;s chest rise up and down, deep breaths to compose herself after the two minute flogging. With her eyes covered, the rest of her senses were heightened. She could hear the blood pumping in her ears, the room otherwise silent except for Bernard&#8217;s occasional movements. The position was comfortable, but holding a single position for a long period without moving or shifting at all still was not easy. She just tried to stay focused and prepared for whatever was coming next.
Bernard walked around the room, smiling at the pools of wax forming in the tops of the pillar candles. He mused to himself what he would name his next piece of art. �Squirming� &#8211; Wax on Flesh. He could see Skyla hung in a museum when he was done with her. He picked up a red and a blue candle and readied himself silently over his canvas. Without a word, he tilted the red candle, spilling a few drops of the pooled wax on to her left breast.
Skyla yelped and jerked in surprise, her left shoulder coming off the bed involuntarily. She could feel the hot wax solidifying on her breast. The flogging had really warmed up her body, getting the blood flowing, making everything more sensitive. She felt that she could withstand this challenge though, once she got used to the heat. If she could get used to the heat. But when the next drops hit her right breast, she jerked again, her other shoulder coming off the bed. He chuckled.
�You know, if you do that every time drops fall on you, it&#8217;s going to be a very long time before you cum again.� He suddenly tilted both candles down, letting them drop their wax on to her breasts and her chest, slowly rotating them around, leaving trails, careful to leave her nipples clean still. He watched as Skyla squirmed and struggled not to move or cover herself, watching her shoulders, elbows, and back repeatedly come off the bed as the wax burned at her sensitive flesh.
Having exhausted those two candles for the moment, he placed them back where they came from, picking up a purple candle. Where red and blue meet, they make purple. As such, he felt it only fitting that in the middle of all of the red and blue wax, there be some purple. It was also lightly scented &#8211; lavender. It was the only purple candle he could find. He had read that scented candles burned hotter than other candles but�well, it wasn&#8217;t supposed to be easy, was it? She heard him walking around, assuming that he was finding something to take off all that wax with and prepared herself for the exact wrong type of impact.
The first drop of purple wax landed perfectly on her left nipple and was immediately announced with an ear-piercing shriek. Bernard watched as most of her body came off the bed in a strong reaction to what was obviously more painful than he thought it would be. He let her settle down, giving her a few seconds to regain herself, then let a drop fall on to her other nipple. Neither the scream nor the reaction were as pronounced the second time, but he could tell by her face that it was just as painful.
He put the candle back where it came from, satisfied, and walked back over to Skyla&#8217;s heavily breathing form. �You were doing so well, too. But I must add a day for each body part that came off the bed. And you had quite a bit of movement when that wax fell upon your nipples. Did that hurt? Don&#8217;t answer that, I don&#8217;t care. In case you&#8217;re wondering, you&#8217;re already up to�� He paused, wanting to milk the moment. �23 days.�
Skyla whimpered softly. She knew he wasn&#8217;t done yet, and already, she was more than halfway to her previous total. She resolved to do better going forward, because she knew that more willpower now meant less needed in the future. She heard the familiar whooshing sound of the flogger and prepared herself for an impact. And again, the impact never came. Instead, a few seconds later, she felt wax dripped on to her inner thigh and she jumped. She cursed herself out in her head.
Bernard smiled. He had gotten her again. He knew the element of surprise was important here. He had picked up an orange and a yellow candle this time, and was dripping them liberally on to Skyla&#8217;s inner thighs and upper legs, covering them in a coating of the quickly solidifying wax. He watched her squirm, the candlelight flitting around her body, illuminating the patches of wax he had laid already. She was doing a good job sticking to the bed, even if she was moving around on it. She was getting better, and he wasn&#8217;t sure how much longer this test would be effective. He decided to move right to the grand finale.
�You have done well. I only need to add two days to your previous total. 25 days. Do you think you can keep it under a month? You might be able to. But, as I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve figured out, you still have some�sensitive flesh I can attend to. Lift your legs in the air and spread them wide. Do not let them move. The rest of your body should stay in place. I hope you have good core strength, it will certainly come in handy here�� He watched as she obeyed, looking at her face, watching true fear creep upon it. He picked up a black candle, thinner than the ones he had been using. He wanted this one to be a little more focused.
Skyla felt Bernard crawl up on to the bed, able to tell that he was perfectly stationed between her legs by the mattress being pulled down there. She steeled herself as much as possible, remembering how painful it was on her nipples and only able to imagine how much worse this will be. Bernard just kept looking at her face, watching her thought process reflected in her contortions. She obviously had not quite learned yet.
Bernard raised the candle, tilted it, and watched as the wax landed on the sole of her foot. Her legs jerked violently, and he suddenly realized that this may not be the best spot to do this from. He crawled around and straddled her stomach, pinning her arms to her sides, figuring at the very least that it would be harder for her legs to buck towards her face than back down towards the bed. �Both of your legs moved. That will be two more days added.� He lowered the candle towards her exposed pussy, letting her feel the heat of it. He gently rubbed it, feeling her wetness. Despite the nature of the exercise, she was clearly enjoying herself. He quickly brought the candle back up and dropped a few drops on her other foot, watching her legs again flail around for a few moments. �Two more days.�
The soles of her feet were just too sensitive to hold still in this position, and they both realized it fairly quickly. Skyla was dearly hoping Bernard would not be evil, which was exactly what Bernard was considering. But he decided to be nice. She was already at 29 days, and he remembered Skyla getting exponentially more desperate as the days went by. Still, his masterpiece wasn&#8217;t quite finished yet�
He rolled off her and stood up, replacing the black candle and picking up a white one. Just as purple was the matrimony of red and blue, the white wax was to represent the hottest flames, leaping from the orange and yellow ones on her thighs. Unlike the purple one, this one was unscented. He had gotten both a scented and unscented white, but decided to play �nice� at this point. Can it ever be described as nice when you&#8217;re pouring hot wax on somebody&#8217;s exposed pussy? He mused to himself, letting Skyla lay in terrified wait. He walked back over to the bed.
�I will offer you a deal. You are at 29 days. I am not done with the wax, not to mention any other tests I may have planned. However, I am willing to increase your 29 days to 35 days and stop adding days to that. That means that you can&#8217;t have less than 35 days, but you won&#8217;t have more than that either. Simply nod your head yes or no to answer. You have ten seconds to think about it.� He watched her head, and within three seconds, she nodded yes. �So be it. You will have your next orgasm in 35 days.� He climbed on the bed and straddled her as he had before. He hooked his elbows around her legs, keeping them a little bit more in place this time.
Slowly, he tilted the candle, watching the liquid wax moving ever so slowly to and then over the edge and on to her shaved, unprotected slit. He felt her body bucking and listened to her screams, but he did not stop. Her screams grew louder, her bucking stronger, but he did not hold back, making sure that her pussy was completely covered from top to bottom in the white wax. Eventually, the first layer of wax started to cool and harden, and her screams grew softer and ragged and her bucking turned to twitches. �Keep your legs up.� He slid off of her, looking down at her face, seeing it contorted in agony, the corner of her eyes wet. It was a beautiful sight.
He put the candle down. There was only one thing left to do. He picked up a camera he had brought along for the occasion. After all, what good is artwork without people seeing it? He took multiple pictures from all angles, with her legs both up and down. He had her stand up and took full-frontal shots. They just looked so good, dark and erotic, a naked body illuminated by shadows and covered in wax. Leaving the blindfold on, he turned on the lights and took a few more shots in bright light, just for good measure, before turning them off again. After all, he still liked the way she looked better with the lights off.
Bernard laid Skyla back down, putting out all of the candles before lying down next to her. He removed her blindfold and ran his hands through her hair. �Are you okay? I know that was pretty intense.� She nodded her head yes. �I&#8217;m glad. Now get some rest. You have 35 days until your next orgasm, but we&#8217;ll have plenty of fun before then, I promise.� They both smiled. Bernard held Skyla in his arms as they both peacefully and blissfully drifted in to dreamland.
