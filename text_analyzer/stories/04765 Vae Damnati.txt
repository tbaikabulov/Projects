Prologue - Domina

&nbsp;

I have no notion of how long I have remained there.� The time was immeasurable.� I have no way of keeping track of the hours
or minutes.� I doubt that there was any
window to the outside world where I am, but even if there were, it would do me
no good as my eye sight is completely kept from me.� Perhaps instead of what I do not, I should
begin with what I do know.

I know the state that I am currently being kept in, and
it is an unpleasant one at best.� I am on
my knees, something that has become painfully apparent over the course of this
trial.� Other then the various restraints
that hold me, I have been stripped completely.�
My eyes are shielded by a leather strap around my head and two circular,
padded pieces of leather effectively blindfolding me completely.� A rubber ball fills my mouth to the brim,
with yet another leather strap holding it in place.� I know there is a hole drilled through the
middle with a tube forced into it.� Much
to my dismay the tube has been forced down my throat to a destination I can
only guess at.� Any noise I make is
reduced to a mere mumble, as well as grind on my throat, and I�m forced to
drool on myself uncontrollably.� My arms
are encased in a leather sleeve that holds them behind my back tightly, forcing
them together all the way up to my shoulders.�
The agony is compounded by the fact that a chain at the end of this
sleeve wrenches them into the air and threatens to pull them straight out of
their sockets.� As a result I am doubled
over with my face to the cold, cement floor.�
I would be able to lift my head slightly, to what avail I don�t know,
save for the fact that a thick leather collar encircles my throat
completely.� It holds me rigidly
preventing any movement of my neck at all and a short chain from the front
hooked into the floor keeping my face practically pressed against it.� My knees are kept apart by leather straps
that encircle each one.� I can distinctly
feel the presence of a bar between them, forcing them open and chains from
either side also hook into the floor, preventing me from shifting my position
at all.� More leather cuffs encase my
ankles and are similarly affixed to one another via a bar and then to the
floor.

I can tell from the cold air on my body that every inch
of hair has been shaved off save for the closely cropped hair on my head.� Of all my predicaments it is the strangest,
but least upsetting.� The final bit of
restraint is simply confusing to say the least.�
I can feel uncomfortable metal conforming around my dick, holding it
prisoner and bending it down sharply.�
Not that I have any desire to, but I get the distinct feeling that any
attempt at getting an erection would be met with pain instead.� As well, I can feel the slight burning
sensation of a catheter inside of me.�
Where it drains to, I have no idea, but the need to alleviate myself has
obviously been taken care of.

I can guess that I�ve been here for at least hours, if
not more by the fact that my stomach growls with hunger and my throat is
parched.� I try to shift slightly in my
restraints, but it is next to impossible.�
Every inch of me is both in anguish and stiff.� I�m desperate to move, even just an
inch.� At the same time, though, I know
that any such movement is likely to result in even more agony given how long I
have remained motionless.

The first sound that catches my ear is that of an
opening door.� It�s heavy, wooden or
metal, and creeks slightly as it does.� The next sound is the obvious noise of heals
on the cold stony floor.� They are light,
but firm enough to give an authoritative presence as soon as they can be
heard.� This must be my captor, I muse to myself as I await
whatever is coming.� Then I hear it�

Her voice is soft, feminine and alluring but it betrays
no sense of compassion.� It is stern, but
not overtly abusive.� It is intended to
immediately show me who is boss, but at the same time compels me to want her to
give such commands.� At first a foot
simply slides beneath my face and I can feel the leather of her boot under my
mouth.� I feel hands at the back of my
neck and a click of a lock.� The ball is
pulled from my mouth along with the tube, which results in a gagging sensation
and I nearly vomit. �I stretch my jaw for
a moment or two.� Just before I have the
moment to speak, her commanding tone overtakes me, �Lick� slave.�

It is very obvious that I am the slave in question,
though I�m not sure when my status changed.�
I also have seen enough erotica in my day to know what she means by
lick.� There is a part of me that desires
to resist, disobeying her commands and defying her to the core.� That is however unlikely to result in
anything but agony.� Instead the small
part of me that wants to attempt to be resilient to the bitter end is put down
by the more rational side of me.� My
tongue probes out of my mouth and begins to lap at the toe of her boot
diligently.� A part of me cannot stomach
the utter submission I have demonstrated nearly instantly, but a second part of
me stirs at it slightly.� Strangely
enough I feel the slightest twitch between my legs.� Is it possible I desire to be dominated so
strongly that any assertive woman could have commanded me to do this at any
point in my life?� It seems doubtful, but
here I am, hands and knees, bound tightly and licking her boot without
question.� I admit, there isn�t much
protest I could put forth, but at least a little resistance might be in order?

For what seems like eons she allows me to debase myself,
lapping at her leather clad foot meticulously, as if assigned the task by
God.� After several moments, the boot
pulls away from my face and I let out my first sounds since who knows
when.� A simple grunt is all I can muster
for the moment.� Before I can truly speak
my captors voice rings out again.� It is
almost soft and sweet, but it betrays nothing that would make me thing she will
be soft or sweet with me.� Despite her
obvious cruel streak and the fact that my conscience mind reels against my
treatment, the sound of her tone fills me with a certain longing and the flesh
between my legs twitches once more in its prison.

�Good boy,� her hand reaches to my head and I feel
leather clad fingers ruffle my hair as one would an obedient dog. �I suppose
you can be taught.� But,� she muses with
a tone that betrays the smirk that must be plastered across her face, �you have
much yet to learn.�

I hear her movements once more as she paces around my
prone, stripped body.� I can feel her
eyes on my flesh, burning into me.� The
depth with which she is inspecting every inch of me goes beyond my body all the
way to the core of my being.� I can�t
help but feel completely naked and exposed both inside and out.

Finally, I clear my throat once and a horse voice cracks
out.� I barely recognize it as my
own.� Thought I attempt strength, it is
lacking.� Instead it is barely a
whimper.� Even my voice apparently knows
that I am destined to be on my knees to this woman, bondage or no, �What do you
want with me?�

For a moment there is silence.� The silence is broken suddenly by a sharp
crack and fire racing across my upturned ass.�
I can only imagine the instrument that has inflicted such agony, but it
is most definitely leather.� It is just
as everything in my new world seems to be: leather and metal.� It is also unquestionably intended to punish
transgression.� I can only assume then
that asking what she wants with me is a transgression in this new life.

Finally my captor explains, �See, already you are
disobedient.� You will escape with that
one reminder because you are unfamiliar with the rules.� Further disobedience will result in much harsher
methods in the future however,� I can only imagine the smirk is once more
present on her face.� �Speaking without
permission is a punishable offense.� It
will result in ten strokes per word.� Is
that clear?� You may verbalize a single
word answer.�

For the moment, it seems in my best interest I decide
that to play the game.� I am obviously
the powerless in this situation, �Yes.�

�Excellent.� From
now on, know that if I ask a question I require an answer.� I expect your answer to be verbal, polite,
prompt and using as few words as possible.�
That is also the last sentence you will ever utter that does not end
with the word �Mistress�.� Failure to
address me properly will result in twenty lashes.� Are we completely clear?�

�Yes,� I stumble across the title of address she has
selected for herself for only a moment before spitting it out as best as I can,
�Mistress.�

I can tell she is smirking again as she speaks, there�s
something about her tone that betrays it each time, �Excellent.� That was the first time you have called me
such, but I expect that will be the last time you will ever hesitate to address
me properly.�

She says nothing, but I can hear her move and the floor
shifts slightly accompanied by a mechanical noise.� At first it is impossible to tell exactly
what is happening but as the second pass I get the distinct sensation of
rising.� Further deduction and I gather
that the section of the floor that I must be kneeling upon is moving slowly
upwards to lift me into the air, like some sort of table.� Nothing betrays how high I have raised until
the machine finally comes to rest.� I can
smell something.� Initially I cannot
place it, but then the scent of arousal fills my nostrils.� After a single deep inhale I can tell that
her bare sex is directly in front of my face.�
I can also tell that she is incredibly turned on; I can only guess that
it is my domination which causes her excitement.� Now I know, however that my face is waist
high and can assume she has raised me such for the purposes of slaking her
lusts with my mouth.� Strangely, the idea
does not sound completely unappealing and once more my cock twitches with
excitement.� This time my member actually
attempts to begin developing an erection.�
Shooting pain cuts that thought my dick as what feels like a thousand
tiny needles stab me all over.� No matter
how small my phallic prison is, apparently it is lined with minute spikes which
effectively help to curb any pleasure I may have.� Still, a part of me waits with baited breath
for the order to pleasure her.� I hate
the part of me that wants to burry my tongue deep with in her neither region,
as I�m certain she wishes.� I have no
idea how wrong I am.

After I have taken several intoxicating breaths of her
scent I can hear her move away.� There is
the distinct sound of leather and metal, bucks and straps.� It is not on me, though.� When the sound of her steps returns my
nostrils are no longer filled with her aroma, but instead the smell of leather
and rubber.� Her wonderful fragrance is
masked by these but still faint enough for me to catch.� Her words are plain, harsh and demanding and
they shock me.

�Open your mouth.�
I am wearing a strap on.� You will
suck it like a faggot sucking a cock.�
Any hesitation will result in sever
punishment.�

I blink behind my blindfold for a moment.� I am not gay; I have never wanted to be
gay.� The idea of having dick anywhere
near me other then my own is frankly, repulsive.� However, this creature holds all the
cards.� To refuse or even hesitate would
be met with some unknown fate.� For
several ticks I am stuck in limbo, my mouth only half open in an attempt to
reconcile what to do.� The annoyed
clearing of her throat solves my moral dilemma and my mouth opens completely.

Once again I feel her leather clad hand grip my hair and
twist my head for the perfect entry.� It
tugs on my collar which pulls on my neck uncomfortably, but I was soon to
discover how little my comfort mattered.�
The shock of being so forcefully violated explains to me just what my
comfort is worth.� The phallus is massive
and she buries it completely inside of my throat.� I imagine that it must be as large around as
a baseball bat and nearly as long when in truth it was probably no more then
seven inches of soft, but firm rubber.�
The girth fills my mouth completely and the head of the device lodges
itself totally inside of me.� I want to
gag, to vomit and my stomach turns horribly, but there is no where for such
actions to go so they are stifled instead.�
I try to cry out, but it�s nothing more then a muffled moan which one
could almost mistake for pleasure.� Was
it pleasure?

My nose is ground against the leather harness that holds
the device to her body and I can smell its distinct odor as well as the musky
feminine scent of my dominatrix.� Just as
my throat feels torn in two, I feel equally torn.� I hate her.�
I hate that I am stripped, I hate that I am bound, I hate that I am
raped orally.� I love her.� I love that she has stripped me, I love that
she has bound me and I love that she is raping me.� I have lusted after women in the past, but
never have to so strongly had the desire to bury my
face into a woman�s crotch and make her cum.�
Never have I desired to pleasure a woman and receive nothing in
return.� The image of eating out her
pussy only to be pet on the head like an obedient dog
and left in my bondage for ever fills my mind and it instills both loathing and
the imprisoned member between my legs.� A
grunt of agony at its attempted erection is muffled to yet another moan.

�You aren�t sucking, slave,� she practically sings into
the chamber.� �Sucking this cock has a
multi purpose for you.� In the first
part, watching you debase yourself pleases me.�
When I am pleased you will be uncomfortable and humiliated.� When I am displeased you are tortured and in
agony.� Secondly, this device is
carefully placed on my body so that your efforts transfer that motion to a nub
that rubs me just the right way, if you catch my drift.� Sucking it, will not deliver much to my clit,
but on the off chance that you successfully make me cum, your day will end
her.� I will remove you from your
restraints, bind you in my room to view for my pleasure but otherwise let you
rest for the day,� she paused in a manor that betrayed the all to familiar
smirk I had yet to see, but knew by heart already.� I took this opportunity to begin rubbing my
tongue across the shaft of the device buried in my throat, sucking at it
gently.� I had never sucked cock before,
but I had seen enough porn to guess.� I
was rewarded with a soft moan of pleasure before she continued, �If you fail to
make me cum, there is still a reward for the effort of sucking.� You see, if I fail to cum while you suck
this,� I moved in such a manor as to produce yet another sudden moan and she
chuckled lightly before continuing her speech, �I plan to take your anal cherry
immediately after,� I whimpered slightly at that and sucked harder on the
device, moving my head as best I could in both my bonds and her grasp to try
and force as much stimulation down the device as I could, �Oh don�t cry about
it.� Today or tomorrow, I will fuck your
asshole.� It�s if I do it now or later
that you are worried about.� Regardless,
if I fail to cum, I will fuck your ass with this very strap on.� The better you suck, the gentler I�ll
be.� In any case, the only lubrication it
will receive will be your spit covering it, so I advice you to suck well.�

I redoubled my efforts with this new knowledge and set
work with all my effort.� She moaned
slightly and she writhed a little, twisting her grip in my hair.� I knew that the creature which kept me was a
true sadist.� The more she moaned the
more pain she delivered to my scalp.�
Ultimately, all my efforts were not enough however as I felt the device
yank from my mouth before she came to any obvious climax.� A soft sigh of disappointment escaped her
lips and she began to pace around me once more.�
I coughed considerably as the device yanked out of my throat.� I didn�t know if I was allowed to vomit, but
seeing as how so far I was not permitted anything, even speech or erection, I
imagined that would be forbidden as well and thus I suppressed it.

�You did very well for your first cock sucking.� I imagine some day you�ll make an excellent
faggot.� Perhaps I�ll let you train on
one of my other slaves.� Not enough for
me I�m afraid, though.� I�m sorry to say
that you�ll be fucked in the ass now.�
The rougher action of pounding your ass will undoubtedly rub me the
right way.� Besides, I�ve always found it
so hot to violate a man in the place that they always desire to violate women.�� I wanted to open my mouth; I wanted to
protest.� A part of me even wanted to
beg.� But I held my tongue.� �Especially,� she continued while her leather
gloved hand ran across my exposed balls and then griped the metal covered shaft
as if to jerk me off, �While they are kept neuter.�

Her hand returned its attention to my sac and I groaned
as my erection attempted to form yet again, already I gathered her teasing me
while I was imprisoned in this device would be a constant element to my new
life.� My thoughts shocked me for a
moment.� I was beginning to consider my
�new life�.� As if I had already resigned
myself to this fate.� The thought of
resignation was almost comforting.� A
part of me considered that this new life was impossible to escape and thus my
only purpose in life now was to obey.�
That sick part of me felt free.�
But the rest of my mind reeled against the though, redoubling its
efforts to keep vigilant for some hope of escape or rescue.

�You know,� her voice filled my ears once more, �I have
raped so many men in their asses�� she paused as if musing for a second, �women
as well mind you, I am an equal opportunity slaver and I have no love of one
sex over they other,� she chuckled lightly, �I love them both in my own way.� I love when they squirm.� I love when they beg.� I love when they scream.� I love when men�s cocks stand at attention,
twitching and helpless forever kept from desperate release.� I love when women�s hips hump air in their
own forms of your metal prison, desperate for something to violate them deep
inside.� A desperation
that will never arrive.� I love to
see straight men�s mouths around cocks.�
I love straight women�s tongues buried inside cunt.� I love to debase, humiliate, torture and
violate everything about humanity.� It is
what I was made to do.� I love to deny
what you want, and give you what you don�t.�
I love imprisoning your sex organs in metal and leather so that they are
useless and then driving both men and women to the brink of orgasm
endlessly.� I love how all of you, no
matter how resolute or strong eventually succumb to me and agree to any
violation just for a single orgasm.� But
what I love most is begging.� Out right,
pathetic, whimpering begging.� In the
end, all women beg for their Mistress to drill them with this strap on until
they orgasm, screaming.� In the end, all
men beg to just be allowed to put their cocks inside their Mistress once until
they cum, moaning.� And that is what this
moment lacks.� You begging.� You will beg
me to fuck your ass and it best be convincing��

This shattered my mind.�
No only would this sick bitch torture me, abuse me and rape me, but she
would have me beg for such abuse.� For
the moment, my revere of her was broken and reality returned full force.� Defiance
welled up inside of me.� There are two
forms of survival in life.� There is the
survival of your physical body, which demands a great deal.� But there is also the survival of your
concept of the self.� Sometimes, the
survival of the self requires that a person sacrifice their body to maintain
that identity.� But that sacrifice of the
body requires a great deal of strength.�
It was not a part of my identity to beg to be raped by a woman I had
only just met, or by any woman.� I would
muster the strength to sacrifice myself up for punishment to maintain that
identity.� Perhaps she would put that
thing inside me, but it would not be at my request.

�No, bitch,� I murmured with a horse throat, thinking
perhaps the bitch part was a bit over the top.

She simply sighed.�
Her stroking of my scrotum continued for a minute more.� I almost imagined that she was sad; perhaps
she had some emotion after all.� Perhaps
this was some sill prank and she thought I was actually turned on by it and my
violent rebuke had upset her.� She would
untie me and I would give her a kiss on the check and tell her that it had been
a nice try, but I really wasn�t into the dominatrix thing.� How amusingly wrong my inane happy thoughts
were�

Her hand, instead of tenderly stroking grabbed my balls
like an iron vice and twisted them around one hundred an eighty degrees if it
was a single.� My mouth opened wide in an
attempt to scream, but no sound came out.�
Her other hand grabbed my hair and yanked my head back as far as it
could go given the restriction of the collar.�
Her body pressed over mine, I could feel her naked tits on my back, but
it was the least of my concern at the moment.�
I also felt the head of the device between her legs pressing against my
virgin anus, but even that was the least of my worries.� What was primary on my mind was the pain
shooting through my testicles and her words that chilled me even worse.

�You do not have the right to refuse me ever again.� You will do what I ask, when I ask no matter
what I tell you to or you will be plunged into a nightmare that you will never
wake up from.� You are mine to do with as
I please.� If I tell you to suck your own
dick, you will do it or die trying rather then displease me.� The next time I tell you to do something and
you refuse me I�ll cut these balls off, burn the wound closed with a hot iron,
shove the useless organ in your mouth and tape it shut to let them rot inside
you.� Then I will sever your cock, fuck
you with your own dick and strap that
into your ass so it can also rot inside your body. Are we perfectly clear?�

Terror and pain produced an immediate response which
came out as a gasp, �Yes Mistress.�

She released me from the horrifying hold she had and
returned to gently stroking my balls, which were now almost numb with pain,
�Good� now, beg me to fuck your ass, slave.�

My sense of self simply shattered, �Please�� I murmured
at first, to which she gave a slight twist of my scrotum to implore me that
this was not enough, �Please Mistress� fuck my ass��

�You want me to fuck your asshole with my strap on?� she
coyly responded.

I had no choice but to play her foul game, �Yes,
Mistress.� Please fuck my ass with your
strap on, Mistress.�

I could tell she was smirking again and the head of her
tool loomed against the bud of my anus, �How badly do you want me to fuck your
asshole?�

I shivered slightly and continued, �I want nothing more
then for you to drive that dick into my ass,� I stumbled over each word and
they were without emotion, but I managed to utter them.

She made a soft humming noise as if she was considering
it, �Alright slave� I supposed I�ll fuck your ass, unfortunately your spit has
all dried and I have no lube,� the moment the words left her lips my eyes
widened behind their blindfold with terror, but she gave me no respite.� With sudden, brutal efficiency, the entire
length of the tool was driven into me.� I
may have been an anal virgin until her forceful invasion, but she used me as if
I was the town whore.� She did not spare
me an ounce as she violently raped me.�
Was it rape?� I had begged for it�

I had to drive those thoughts from my mind; I had to
affirm my sense of self again.� I had not
really begged for it.� She had made
me.� This was undoubtedly rape.� I was the victim here, not some willing
participant.� I had to remember that fact,
no matter how she twisted my mind or emotions.�
Still, through all the pain, I would not deny that my dick twitched in
yet another attempt to get an erection that most likely would never come again.

She used me until she had climaxed at least once, but perhaps
twice.� With that she yanked the device
out of me.� I gasped in unholy pain as it
was pulled out and felt the distinct wetness of blood running down my body.� A part of me was shocked to be alive.� I could hear the sounds of metal and leather
and the device clattered to the floor.�
She moaned another time before the click of her heels found their way
around to face me once more.� Once again
I could smell her sweet sex in my face, this time stronger then ever.� It was positively intoxicating.� For the moment, all thoughts of torture ebbed
away from my mind and instead I wanted her to release me from my bondage simply
so that I could fall to my knees willingly and pleasure her.� I was certain however, that she had other
designs in mind.

�My slave� that was quite nice, but now I�m a mess.� I do believe you should clean me.�� Her leather clad hand found
its way into my hair and she gripped my head as she pressed her crotch into my
face.� I was in heaven for a
moment, but her voice pulled me away from there, �Clean me only.� If your tongue penetrates me in any way this
pretty mouth will be physically glued around the cock of one of my studs whom I
actually allow to orgasm and for a solid year you�ll only get nourishment from
milking him.�� I diligently began my
task, desperately wishing on some level that I could dip inside her for just a
second.� I was horny beyond measure, but
all thoughts of my dick inside her were gone.�
The thought of being allowed to actually have sex with this sadistic
angel whom I had never even seen was incomprehensible.� I simply wanted to bury my face into her sex
and pleasure her until the end of time.�
I knew what it was forbidden though, for some reason it was what I
desired, so it was denied me.� But while
I licked her crotch clean of sweat and her juice she continued to muse to me,
�Perhaps, if you are a truly good slave, some day you�ll be one of those slaves.� Of course, they only cum inside the mouths
and assholes of slaves like you.� The most well behaved straight ones, though
by the time I�m done with most of my charges, they don�t even know what
straight is anymore, get a female to deposit inside of; the others are forced
to become homosexuals.�� She almost
seemed to giggle slightly, �Only the very elite of my property ever knows what
it is like to be inside me.� I doubt you
will ever be good enough to be one of those.�

Certain desperation filled me.� I needed to be that good.� I longed with every fiber of my being to
prove that I was worthy of such reward now that I knew it was possible.� To have a single moment naked in bed with her
consumed my very soul.� Even if I was
still collared and enslaved, to lay with her as her lover for just a moment was
all I wanted.� Indeed the more I lapped
at her cunt, the more the idea of freedom seemed
incomprehensible and even undesirable.�
As if her juice was some kind of horrible, addictive drug that filled me
with a desire to debase myself for her.�
I loved and loathed it.

Once she had decided I was finished, she pulled away
from my body and left me wanting, though away from her scent and her taste some
of my faculties began to return.� Still I
was consumed with a million questions, most of which dedicated to her and not
my own fate.� One plagued me most of all
though.� But I was forbidden speech.� Perhaps it would be worth any possible
punishment.

�Mistress, may I ask a question?�

She moved about me silently, chains and rattling filling
my ears as I did so.� She giggled again
lightly and I felt something against my asshole once more, �Of course not,
slave.� And that merits a punishment, but
I am too tired so I will simply remember to punish you later.� Fifty lashes I believe that warrants.�� With a single swift shove I felt a phallus,
bigger then the one she fucked me with grind home all the way into me.� I gasped and awaited the horrific fate of
being fucked again.� But it did not
come.� Instead the device stayed buried
into me all the way up to a series of leather straps and buckles that locked it
into my orifice, which she secured tightly to ensure that I would be most
uncomfortably penetrated.

I could only formulate a single response, �I�m sorry
Mistress.�

She chuckled again and I could hear a slight creek of
leather as she knelt down in front of her face.�
When her lips touched my own I was filled with fire and
electricity.� A single kiss from her was
more divine then any orgasm any woman before has ever given me.� Blood rushed to my member, but it�s only reward
was agony.� I whimpered into her embrace
and I could tell it made her smile.� The
moment her lips pulled from mine the tube was forced back down into the depths
of my throat and the ball gagged followed, strapped tightly into place.

�That�s thirty more,� she said with an obvious grin in
her voice.� Apologizing to her was worth
the punishment.

With that my sadistic angel she left me alone to muse
about my predicament.� I could feel that
shattered sense of self slipping away again as I realized after only one
meeting and never even seeing my captor I was becoming hers.� I was inevitable.� With each passing moment I was further
enslaved to this torturous seraph.� She
would use me, she would torture me, she would toy with me body and emotions for
her own pleasure and I did not care.� 

I cried.� I cried
in pain, I cried in joy, I cried in resignation.� A thousand emotions filled me: sadness for
the loss of my old life, joy for my new one, desire to be with her, smell her,
touch her and please her.� The strangest
was freedom though.� It had filled me
early and I could not understand why.�
Again it coursed through me.� It
would take many years before I could comprehend why I felt freedom bound, naked
and enslaved.� I realized that a slave
knows true freedom.� They are free from
choices, from burdens, from responsibility.�
They know only a single thing: please their owners.� I thought back to the single question I had
desired to ask her as the door to my cell shut.�
How can I please you?�

Chapter 1 - Dominus

&nbsp;

As the glass door hissed closed on it�s hydraulics
behind him, Gideon surveyed the place before him.� The office building reminded him more of an
ancient palace then a place of business.�
Past the enormous glass doors was a lobby containing marble pillars, a
vaulted ceiling, and a floor polished to the point where it reflected
everything above back down below.� The
hallway like lobby extended for at least two hundred feet straight through the
building.� At the far wall form the
entrance were three bronze plated double doors that obviously served to lead
any guests to the elevators that would carry them to whatever floor their
business needed to be conducted on.� The
dozens of pillars on either side of the lobby were constructed of the same
black marble with white swirls as the floor and capped with a bronze piece at
the base and the top.� The security desk
was only a dozen feet from the door and barriers prevented you from entering
further into the room until you passed a metal detector.� From a purely architectural sense, it was
amazing.� Gideon would have actually been
impressed with it, if it were not strictly on business.

The sun had set four hours ago, but security staff still
guarded the structure as if it was broad day light out.� Each one took their turn studying the lone
figure that had entered the building before casting a knowing glance back at
each other.� Given the man�s attire and
the fact that he was arriving at the complex at just past midnight could only
mean one thing.

Gideon�s attire was an eerie combination of formal and
sinister.� He carried the appearance of a
mafia enforcer rolled into a high priced lawyer.� His suit was perfectly pressed and obsidian
black.� Where a fine pair of dress shoes
should have been, instead the security officials noticed a finely polished pair
of combat boots.� His slacks were
obviously expensive and well tailored and held firmly about his waist by a 1
inch black leather belt.� Perfectly
pressed and tucked neatly into his pants was a pure white dress shirt.� His tie was a thin black style that is
popular in movies about secret government agents.� His suit jacket was as black as his tie and
pants and left unbuttoned to move lightly with him.� The final cue to the security staff that this
figure was here for very specific business was his sunglasses: oval framed and
just as expensive as the rest of his outfit.�
Ordinarily they simply would have been tasteful protection from the sun�
but it was after midnight.

One of the two security agents rose to greet him and
nodded slightly, �Welcome to Vasser Corporation, how can I
help you, sir?�

Gideon turned his attention to the man, he had
previously ignored him completely, opting to take in the sites of the building
instead.� He simply pursed his lips and
narrowed his eyes.� His voice was soft,
but harsh and commanding.� Neither of the
two men before him could determine the origin of his accent, �I have an
appointment with Miss Vasser.�

�Of course sir,� the man nodded politely with a fake
smile and motioned for him to pass through the metal detector.

Gideon took several steps forward and passed
effortlessly through the machine.� It beeped
at him mercilessly and he curled his lip slightly as it did.� He felt a sudden touch against his person and
moved with reflexes that would shame a feline.�
A single, firm hand wrapped itself around the security guards throat and
squeezed until he could just barely feel the flesh begin to truly give
way.� The other two guards threw their
chairs back rising and drew their weapons.�
Gideon simply snarled in a sound that was unmistakably inhuman.

In a desperate attempt to keep the situation from
turning into a blood bath as well as staving off the political fallout, the
immobilized security officer waved a hand at his two partners while holding up
the other one in a peaceful gesture.� His
crushed larynx squawked out a pathetic sound, �I apologize
sir, I shouldn�t have touched you but no weapons are permitted on the
property.�

For a moment Gideon considered the situation.� He could simply eliminate all three of these
men in an instant, leave the building and report to his boss that the endeavor
was met with impoliteness and move on.�
His hand released instead when he realized the ramifications that such
an action might have.� He sighed slightly
as he considered why he was chosen for yet another diplomatic assignment.� Those were distinctly not his forte.

Instead of enacting a massacre that he was certain only
he would walk away from, however, Gideon removed his jacket and carefully
folded it on the security station.� What
the three security guards saw beneath caused their jaws to drop.� He carried no less then three firearms, two
knifes and a foldout baton under his formal attire.� While the stunned men watch he began to
disarm himself.� From a shoulder holster
he removed a Glock 18c automatic pistol, notorious
for being able to spray ammunition out of a gun no bigger then an ordinary 9mm
pistol.� Behind his back were seated two
identical Mark 23 .45 caliber hand guns, most often used by Navy Seals and
other Special Forces groups.� Each one was
mounted with a laser sight for ease of accuracy.� He simultaneously removed both knifes from
the same shoulder holster that his Glock had been
located on.� The first knife was a Gerber
Mark II combat knife and the other, the very popular Marine Ka-bar.� Gideon simply smiled a fiendish grin as he
placed them on the security station and leaned into the nearest security guard.

�My kind is rather resistant to firearms.� Bladed weapons are almost a necessity��� The officer was only capable of nodding
slightly while he attempted, unsuccessfully, to reattach his jaw to his
head.� Finally Gideon placed the baton on
the table besides the rest of his weapons and smirked slightly, �Does that
suffice?�

The security guard nodded once more in awe and Gideon
gathered up his jacket.� His shoes click
firmly against the highly polished floor as he pulled it back on and neatened
his tie.

The elevators were equally as impressive as the main
lobby.� It turned out the structure
extended dozens of floors both above and below the ground level of the
lobby.� It totaled 130 stores total, 97
of which are above ground.� That made it
the largest structure in all the city of New
  Corinth.� The
entire center of the building was an enormous cylinder shaft that ran the
entire height of the building and was capped with a huge glass dome.� The shaft ran all the way to the base of the
building 33 floors below ground where a massive cafeteria was located for the
buildings hundreds of employees.� The 96
of the above ground floors were dedicated to the various offices and business
related endeavors of the enormous Vasser Corporation. �The first floor was solely dedicated to house
the magnificent lobby which actually rose to encompass sections of floor two
and three to make room for its own enormous ceilings.� The lower 33 floors all housed the
Corporations elite in amazing luxury apartments that were usually part of the
benefits package that went along with being Vasser Corporation�s upper
management.� It also contained daycares,
gyms, stores and everything else required to provide a high class living
situation for the employees, much like its own private city within the bounds
of New Corinth.

Each floor of the building was left open to the shaft,
being separated from the view by only a single brass bar that served as a
railing.� This offered an impressive view
of glass and metal all the way up and down the complex.� The edges of each floor were decorated in
magnificent hanging plants, art work and marble pillars similar to the
lobbies.� This provided an almost Hanging
Garden of Babylon
experience to anyone who was lucky enough to witness it.� The lobby elevators, as well as all three
other sets in the building, were placed on the edge of this shaft and were made
half of shatter proof glass, allowing anyone in the elevator to study the
amazing view during the ride.

For several moments, Gideon allowed himself to witness
the breath taking view with his hands clasped neatly behind his back.� All too soon, however, the ding of the
elevator signaled its arrival on the top floor of the complex and he turned to
face the opening doors.� Beyond them he
found six men waiting at attention.� Each
one was outfitted entirely in black SWAT style combat gear and armed with an
automatic weapon of choice.� All of their
faces were concealed behind balaclavas and their heads protected by Kevlar
helmets.

Gideon smirked for a moment and tilted his head to the
side for a moment, �All this for me?� he paused and raised his chin with a hint
of pride, �Am I perceived as this dangerous?�

The security member who was obviously the spokes person
cleared his throat slightly and stammered, �Um� yes sir.�

Gideon smirked again and nodded, �Excellent� I have no
ill intentions.� Proceed.�� Gideon entered into the middle of them and
paused only a moment to lean into the first man, �But, if you have ill
intentions towards me� you die first.�

The other man swallowed hard and nodded slightly, waving
a hand in the air he shouted in an attempt to regain his confidence, �Move
out!�

Gideon studied the environment of the building as he was
escorted.� Every floor was identical in
the beginning.� The floor was a ring
carpeted in a fine red shade that circled the amazingly long drop to the very
base of the building.� Each floor also
had a brass railing that prevented unwanted spills down the shaft.� Every floor could practically be seen from
every other save for a single spot across the way from where Gideon was that
looked like black glass.� Four sets of
three elevators were located on the ring in exact opposite corners.� All offices, housing quarters, meeting rooms
and various other aspects of the building branched off from these central
rings.� Gideon had to admit silently to
himself that it was an impressive structure.

The SWAT detachment led him around the ring and down
several hallways until he found himself in an equally impressive waiting
room.� The carpet remained the same shade
of red and the furniture was fine brown leather.� Without even being offered, Gideon
immediately took a seat in one of the chairs and leaned back slightly.

�Wait here, sir,� the security officer nodded and his
team exited the room quickly, the large double doors closing behind him and the
sound of automatic locks clicking.� Whatever makes them feel safer, he mused
to himself as he prepared to wait.

It was only a few minutes before he heard the other door
to the waiting room begin to rustle.�
This one was large and wooden as well as far more ornately carved and
with all brass fittings.� The moment the door
began to rustle, Gideon rose to his feet and folded his hands behind his back.� The woman that exited from the room beyond,
however, was not what he expected at all.

To even call her a woman would have been perhaps a bit
of an exaggeration.� The girl looked
perhaps 15 and maybe 16 years of age.�
However stunning the site of a beautiful young girl in this building
was, her attire was even more shocking.�
Her hair was a shade of red that could have only come from a bottle.� It looked like an amazingly vibrant red toned
down only slightly by the color of blood.�
It was parted directly in the center of her head to frame her face and
cropped to hang just far enough to brush lightly against her shoulders as she
moved her head.� Any movement of her head
however, would have been seriously hampered by a sever
black leather collar that encircled her throat.�
It was thick and shaped in such a way as to force her head to remain in
an upright, formal posture.� A single
silver ring hung from the front for whatever devious purposes someone could imagine
and it clasped in the back with a locking buckle.� Her top was only a leather corset that began
below her bust line.� Rather then conceal
her small, but firm breasts only functioned to hold them up on display
instead.� Each tiny pink nipple had a
silver captive ring drilled through it.�
The garment buckled in the back and each strap was secured with a tiny
silver padlock, making it impossible for the girl to remove it on her own.� Her
bottom was a laughably short, pleated black leather skirt that only managed to completely
cover both her front and back when she stood perfectly still and absolutely
upright.� Her arms up to the shoulders
and her legs up to her thighs were encased in black latex that hugged her skin
fiercely and further added to the fetish attire.� Over top of those her wrists and ankles were
locked into leather cuffs which each held a ring so that the girl could be
strapped or chained in anyway someone saw fit.�
Finally, a pair of impossibly high heals covered her feet which the
young girl managed to move efficiently and effortlessly in, as if she had
undergone considerable training.� Her
face was young and stunning.� Each of her
ears was pierced with a single silver ring, as was the bottom center of her
darkly painted crimson lips.

Her mouth carried a practiced and formal smile, as if
despite her attire and obvious position in life, she was used to playing the
good corporate hostess.� Gideon had
wondered when Vasser�s notorious lifestyle would become apparent; this girl was
the first evidence.� Gideon had spent
years learning to read opponents on a battle field and had since adapted that
talent to social situations.� He knew
that despite her effortless and practiced smile, there was sadness in this girl�s
eyes.� However, her happiness or sadness
was not his concern.

She bowed as best she could in her attire with her hands
behind her back and spoke in flawless English, though her French accent was
undeniable, �Welcome to Vasser Corporation, Dominus.� I apologize for the wait.� I am Collette Reynard, but you may call me
what you wish.�

The term Dominus sealed the deal as to what this girl
actually was.� Gideon�s kind had first arisen
in the world during the height of the Roman Empire.� Where they came from, nobody was quite
certain and to this day they largely remain hidden.� However, those that have come to serve the
immortal creatures like Gideon and Vasser carry on traditions born in those
times.� Being old creatures their �national
language�, of sorts, was Latin.� The men
and women who serve them are little more then slaves and servants and thus like
in ancient Roman tradition they use the Latin words �Dominus� and �Domina� to
refer to their Masters and Mistresses.�
Only the most trusted and in-the-know of the servants are this familiar
with the secretive Vampire kind to use these terms.

�It was no wait, Ancilla,� Gideon responded with a
polite nod and choosing to use the traditional Latin address to a servant girl.� It was less derogatory then what many of his
kind called the poor wretches that choose, or were forced, to serve, but still
signified her place compared to his.

She nodded slightly and turned on her heal effortlessly
leading Gideon into the office behind her with a simple motion, �Domina,� she
announced upon entering the room and bowing, �the emissary has arrived.�

The office was lavish and served as the meeting place
for all of Annette Mirielle Vasser�s personal and private business.� The floors returned to the same black and
white marble as the lobby and the large columns made of the same stone also
lined the room.� These however, were
decorated with life sized relief status of men and women in various states of bondage
and nudity, most made to look as if they were chained the pillars themselves.� It was yet another sign of Vasser�s notorious
passions and sadism.� A huge desk sat at
the opposing end of the spacious room.�
Behind the desk was a massive window that over looked the shaft that descended
through the stories of the building.� On
further inspection, they appeared to be tined so that it was impossible to see
in from the other side.� This must have
been the location that he�d starred at as he made his way through the building
with the security detail.

Behind the desk sat and elegant looking woman that
appeared no older then 25 or 26.� Her
long black hair was tied up neatly at the back of her head and held off her
neck.� Her attire was no all that
dissimilar from Collette�s.� However, her
collar was much less strict and function and far more elegant and form. �As well, her corset covered her entire chest
and was embossed with a design rather then the simple one her servant
wore.� The skirt was not the humiliating
mockery of a school girl skirt that Collette wore either.� It went well past her knees and was slit
slightly on either side, although it too was made of soft, black leather.� Her heals were not as strict either and her
gloves, though as high and black, were made of the same soft leather as her
skirt instead of latex like Collette�s.

She motioned to a soft leather chair opposite her desk
and then watched with a careful eye as Collette took up the position she had
been trained to during these meetings.� Gideon
slipped himself effortlessly into the chair and folded his hands in his lap
while he let one eye watch Collette kneel off to the side slightly.� Her back was even
more ridged then her corset would enforce and her knees were splayed ever so
slightly.� She didn�t quite reveal what
was beneath her skirt, but she was mere millimeters from doing so.� Vasser picked up a silver padlock from her
desk and tossed it to the waiting girl, who expectantly caught it and folded
her hands behind her back.� A quiet click
told Gideon that her arms were now firmly secured at her back.� Her attention then focused on a point off in
space and she became completely motionless, as if she was a statue.

Gideon studied her for a moment and then turned his
attention to Vasser, �You feel the need to bind simple humans in your presence?�

Vasser chuckled slightly and shrugged, �No.� But I like them to know they are mine and
devoid of their own rights.� Is that not
correct pet?�

Collette didn�t even look at the pair, she simply spoke
firmly, but submissively, �Yes, Domina.�

Vasser smirked and looked back to Gideon, �Now� onto
business.� You are the emissary, Gideon,
correct?�

�That is what I am called,� He said simply offering up
nothing else.

�Do you have a last name, sir?� Vasser continued to do
the polite dance of business conversation.

Gideon was far less familiar with this kind of meeting
and he continued to respond simply and as politely as he could, �I do.�

Vasser smiled a little more, �And it is�?�

Gideon�s intense stair did not leave Vasser�s eyes as he
set about the task of reading her.� He had
to confess however, that he was slightly out of his element when it came to
her.� Her social abilities definitely outmatched
his, �No one�s business but my own.�

Vasser�s smile disappeared for only a split second as
she recovered from this slight, �I see then, Mr. Gideon��

�Gideon is fine,� Gideon interrupted slightly.

�I see then Gideon�� she stammered again as he cut her
off.� It was only a second before she
caught her balance again however and smile, folding her own hands and leaning
back, �Gideon� that is a Hebrew name is it not?�
Are you a Jew?�

Gideon smirked for only a moment and raised a brow
slightly, �My mother was of the Hebrew people,� he stated simply, however
leaving the implication that by Jewish laws that in turn made him a Jew as well.

�And your father?� she continued to pursue her polite
small talk.

�Half Greek, half Romanian,� his curt responses
continued.

�Ah!� Vasser announced with a wide smile, �And thus the
lineage traces to your House.� I
see.� I was wonder how a descendant of
your line came so far as to be in the Middle East.� I must confess you are quite a mysterious
figure.� I know little of you other then
what your reputation insists.�

�Which is?� Gideon questioned with a slightly upturned
brow.

�You emerged in the region of Judea and Palestine in the
16th century from seemingly no where, though you quickly became a
warrior of some note,� she smirked
slightly knowing full well that was quite the understatement, �You descend from
the House of Tepes, though you bear little physical resemblances
to the traditional appearance of those of your House and age.� You made a name for yourself serving as a
hired warrior to various family members of your House, but the modern era has
seen little usage for one with your talents.�

�You have done your research,� Gideon replied calmly.

�I always look into those I allow in this building.� I wonder, have you
done your research on me?�

Gideon smiled a vicious little smile for a moment and
nodded slightly, �You are Annette Mirielle Vasser: a name which I find ironic
at best given that the name Annette is a French name meaning gracious and
merciful and your reputation is one of slaking your own lust on both sexes in
what most would regard as perverted,
sadistic and depraved manors.� You take
what you want in both the material world and from people, being they willing
participants in your games or not.� To
the best of my research you cropped up in the early 19th Century or
perhaps the tail end of the 18th Century.� However, given your notorious lineage to the
House of De Sade you cannot possibly be older then two
hundred and twenty at best.� You are
considered quite pure in lineage among your House which means you are either
the direct descendant of the Marquis himself or his grand child.� The earliest records of your activities begin
in the early 19th Century around the area of Toulouse where you
reportedly attacked, raped and murdered the entire gathering of a small wedding�
of course, those events are attributed to the stress of being of such potent
lineage and so young.� I�m certain many
such stories about me circulate as well.

�After the events of Toulouse
you were said to have fled to the Americas
where you set down roots in New
  Orleans, I imagine for the purposes of best simulating
your French home.� There you began to get
involved in various money making schemes under the assumed male name of Gautier
Vasser who you pretended was your socially inept, drunken husband.� By the time women in the corporate world were
accepted, you emerged as the heir to the Vasser fortune and corporation and
moved the entire operation to New Corinth where you built this structure, the
largest structure in the city to house your operations.� Over the years you have updated and renovated
to keep with the times.� Every few
decades you have passed your fortune down to a fictional female heir and assume
her identity in public and the previous Vasser generation is said to retire to
a series of private estates that exist just outside of town,� he paused for a
moment.

�Though, I only briefly glanced over the file.�

Vasser clicked her tongue and smirked slightly, �I see
you do your homework, sir.�

�I am a soldier, Ms. Vasser.� I am taught to go into battle prepared.�

�Battle?�
she chuckled slightly, �Does this appear to be battle to you?�

Gideon pursed his lips slightly and leaned back, �Everything
is battle in one form or another, Ms. Vasser.�
Now, perhaps we could get to the matter at hand��

Vasser smirked a little and titled her head to the side,
�You said, �most would regard as
perverted, sadistic and depraved�.� What
about you, sir?�

Gideon paused for a moment a shot a single brow up, �Me?�

�Yes,� Vasser licked her lips slightly, �What do you
consider of my personal affairs?�

Gideon formulated his response for a second as he starred
into space, �I have no opinion about how you do or do not treat your servants,
nor do I have an opinion about what sexual activities you do or do not engage
in.� That is not why I am here.�

Vasser smirked slightly, �Yes� you are here because your
Master has sent his best weapon to feel me out and see if my offer is valid or
if more hostile action is necessary.�

Gideon�s hair stood up on the back of his neck and his
hissed softly, the very tips of his fangs exposed beyond his lips, �My employer
has sent me here to negotiate a deal that you
wish to arrange with him.� Perhaps we
could get to it now.�

�Your employer sent you because you are an assassin and
warrior.� If my deal is displeasing to
him you are here to eliminate me.� Let us
not play games with each other, Gideon.�

Gideon could not deny that that was within the bounds of
his orders.� If Vasser proposed something
that would be outside the bounds of prudent Vampiric
society, Gideon was to eliminate her to make his employer�s family well
regarded in the Council�s eyes.� But that
was neither here nor there yet, �Perhaps we could get to business then?�

�No,� Vasser stated simply, �I haven�t had time to
decide if I want to conduct business with you or yet.� Why don�t you stay for a few nights?� Have dinner with me, socialize.� I will decide if we can talk business.�

Gideon sneered slightly.�
The House of De Sade has always had an
annoying method of conducting business, �I�m afraid that is not in my
plans.� If we could proceed��

�I would ask your� employer
if I were you, sir,� Vasser stated simply she once again jabbed at him and his
employer�s relationship.

Gideon frowned slightly, knowing already what he would
say.� None the less, he reached into his
coat ad removed a phone from his pocket.�
After only a moment later he was explaining the situation to whoever was
on the other end.� There was a long delay
afterwards as Gideon listened.� His free
hand reached up to scratch the back of his neck in an irritated manor and he
nodded to nobody in particular, �Yes sir.�
I understand.� I will do that sir,
you can count on me.�� He clicked the
phone closed and slipped it back into his pocket.� Vasser smiled at him expectantly, �He has
said that I should do what you request to please you and make the negotiations
go more smoothly.� Therefore I am not
expected back to Los Angeles
until the end of the week.�

�Excellent!� Vasser exclaimed like a giddy school girl
and depressed a button on her phone, �Jessica� have the staff prepare our
finest suite for our guest here, will you?�

The voice on the other end of the phone stammered back
slightly, �Um� Ms. Vasser� Mr. Jenson is currently located in that suite��

�Then move him,� Vasser commanded in a harsh tone.

�Yes, Ms. Vasser� we will see to it immediately.� Everything will be ready by the time he
arrives.�

�Excellent,� Vasser responded and then lifted her finger
off the button.

She noticed that for the moment, Gideon�s eye had
drifted to her Collette.� She smirked
slightly and for several moments silently watched him watching her.� For her part, Collette was aware that the man�s
eyes were on her body, but she did as she was taught and didn�t even flinch a muscle.�
After several minutes, Vasser finally cleared her throat to regain
Gideon�s attention.

�You seem enamored by my Collette� perhaps she can� keep
you company for the remainder of this evening?�

Gideon glanced at the girl for a moment and then turned
back to Vasser, �I am paid to study everything about a situation to make the
best judgments.� This is no different and
this is not a pleasure visit.� I would
instead like to retire to my room now.�

Vasser nodded slightly with a slight frown and motioned
towards the door as the security detachment returned, �They will show you the
way.� I would ask that you remain on the
first through third floors during your stay however.�

Gideon simply nodded and rose to his feet.� His eyes fell on the young girl one more time
involuntarily before he turned to exit the room however.� Vasser caught the eyes of her charge darting
towards Gideon for only a single moment and the moment he had left the office
she cleared her throat.

�So, I see we are intrigued by him as much as he is
intrigued by you, yes?�

Collette responded quickly, attempting to avoid
punishment as swiftly as possible, �I apologize, Domina.� It will not happen again, Domina.�

�On the contrary,� Vasser smirked slightly, �The
security staff is taking him the long way.�
Hurry to his suite.� I want you to
keep him company this evening, despite what he says.� Please him in any way that you are capable of
that he desires, but find out what you can about him.� I expect a wealth of information or I�ll hang
you buy your tits for a month.� You, my
dear girl, will help me get to him.�

Collette rose to her feed and bowed slightly, �Of course,
Domina.�

The girl was used to being whored out to better entrap
the business partners of her Mistress.�
This was probably one of the less revolting of her targets.� She exited through another door in the office
that was concealed behind some elegant stone work.� Without the use of her hand still, it opened
automatically when Vasser depressed one of a hundred buttons on her desk.

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=4&gt;&lt;B&gt;Chapter 2 &amp;#150;
Ancilla&lt;BR&gt;

&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;Gideon was lead down a lengthy elevator ride to
the bottom floor.� It opened directly
into the base of the open shaft that you could see from so many floors above. A
cafeteria that served all the dining needs of the live-in employees largely
dominated the space.� Calling it a
cafeteria was a misnomer as well.� It was
elegant, with expensive tables and chairs.�
A large water complex was sprawled out through the entire floor dotted
with extensive tropical plant life.�
Indeed too, the climate seemed to be controlled to give it an almost
tropical feel.� Overall, Gideon had to
admit that the atmosphere was fairly convincing and impressive.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

Small pools were set into the stone walkways that made up
the entire cafeteria. Various built up stone structures served to act like
water falls for the extraordinary water system. �A handful of fountains even sprayed the water
into the air periodically. All manor of vegetation was gathered around and in
the water itself: ferns, palm trees, lily pads and any number of other plants
that Gideon couldn&amp;#146;t identify.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

As for the food served at the location, once again the
term cafeteria fell horribly short.�
Rather then a string of women passing out slop onto a tray, as the word
&amp;#145;cafeteria&amp;#146; inspires, almost any type of food that a patron
could desire was available.� Various
complex stands served to cook whatever was on the minds of the diners and they
took them back to their tables on expensive looking trays, to eat off of
expensive looking plates with expensive looking silverware.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

Several company employees were apparently up late
catching a snack while they burned the midnight oil and their attention seemed
to be directed to Gideon the moment he doors open.� Perhaps it was the security detail that
escorted him or perhaps his reputation had indeed preceded him that well.� Whatever the case the half dozen men and
women in the room eyed him carefully as he follow the security team through the
foliage and to the other side of the cafeteria.�
Gideon simply smirked.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

From there they led him into a wing that was obviously
dedicated to living quarters.� The number
&amp;#145;1&amp;#146; followed the letter &amp;#145;A&amp;#146; and then by an
ever-increasing string of numbers lay on each door that he passed.� He had no doubt that this somehow designed
the area and floor of such a massive complex.�
His curiosity was soon satisfied without ever having to speak to a
word.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

&amp;#147;The number designates the floor you are
on.� Obviously you&amp;#146;re on floor
one. Ms. Vasser has said that you are not confined to your room,&amp;#148; Gideon
was amused by this comment.� As if they
could confine him, &amp;#147;but she requests that you do not travel above
floor 3.&amp;#148;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

He paused for a moment, &amp;#147;The letter designates
the section.� Signs tell you how to get
to each housing section. Obviously you&amp;#146;ll be stating in housing
section A.&amp;#148; Gideon nodded slightly.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

He simply folded his hands behind his back and continued
to follow them around each turn and down each corridor, carefully taking stock
of how to get to and from this place.�
The carpet was the same nice red as all the other floors and the lights
had dimmed to give the entire place a &amp;#145;night time&amp;#146; feel.� He didn&amp;#146;t mind at all, as the lights
in the majority of this building irritated him.�
After only a few more moments they stopped at a door which was marked
&amp;#145;1A203s&amp;#146;.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

&amp;#147;The &amp;#145;S&amp;#146;,&amp;#148; the
security guard interrupted Gideon&amp;#146;s study of the hall, &amp;#147;only
designates it as a suite.�
There&amp;#146;s no room 1A203.�
Just this room.&amp;#148;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

&amp;#147;Thank you,&amp;#148; Gideon responded slightly
as he took the key from they security staff&amp;#146;s outstretched
hand.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

&amp;#147;Have a good evening, sir,&amp;#148; He
responded with a nod and the entire group turned on there heals to
exit.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

For several seconds Gideon studied the door and then the
key before finally fitting it into the lock with the familiar sound of moving
tumblers.� He turned the key effortlessly
and twisted the knob.� As he stepped in
he half expected a hotel styled suite.�
He was gravely mistaken.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

The entire place looked like a luxury apartment.� The doorway immediately led to several steps
that took you into a sunken living room.�
Leather furniture and a wide screen TV occupied that area along with a
ornate glass coffee table.� The floors
were highly polished hard wood and he could practically see his reflection in
them.� Beyond the living room and back up
onto the main level was a table and chairs that signified a dining area. The
table looked to be of a dark wood like mahogany and was elegantly made.
Separating the dining area from the kitchen was a half counter, which not only
had ample space to prepare food, but also a sink.� The refrigerator was directly behind
that.� Beyond the kitchen was a door that
presumably led to the bathroom and to the left of the living room was a door
that presumably led to the bedroom.� The
place was frankly, amazing.� It was
definitely superior living to the tiny one room that Gideon lived in back in
LA.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

It was not the room that he found most shocking,
however.� It was the sole occupant of the
room.� Despite telling Vasser that he did
not want the company of her slave girl, there she was waiting for him.� She was dressed exactly the same as she had
been when they first met and was keeling in exactly the same position that she
was during his conversation with Vasser.�
The only difference was her arms. Instead of being bound at the wrist,
she instead wore a black leather arm sleeve that bound them together from her
wrists all the way up to her shoulders and encase her hands.� In such a position she was, without a doubt,
completely helpless.� Though her head was
help up by her collar, her eyes were firmly locked on his feet the moment he
entered the room.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

&amp;#147;Good evening, Dominus,&amp;#148; she said
firmly, but submissively, &amp;#147;Mistress Vasser has determined that I
should attend to your needs this evening.&amp;#148;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

Gideon closed the door behind him and paced into the
room.� For a moment he moved around the
young girl and took her in completely.�
He was not pleased to see her in his room, however at the same time he
wasn&amp;#146;t completely displeased by her presence.� That was strange indeed.� He usually preferred his privacy, &amp;#147;I
thought I explained to Ms. Vasser that I would not be needing your
company&amp;#133;?&amp;#148;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

Collette shifted uneasily in her bonds and cleared her
throat, &amp;#147;That is not my decision, Dominus.� She has dispatched me here and here is where
I must go.&amp;#148;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

Gideon settled onto the white leather soft where he had a
vantage point of the girl from behind.�
She hadn&amp;#146;t moved a muscle to face him or look at him yet,
&amp;#147;Well,&amp;#148; he finally waved a dismissive hand, &amp;#147;go and
inform your Mistress that your services are not required and I politely release
you.&amp;#148;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

Collette stifled a cough slightly, &amp;#147;Should I
return to my Domina this evening, I will most certainly be punished for my
insolence in not pleasing you to the best of my abilities.� However,&amp;#148; she considered for a split
second before finishing her sentence as she struggled to her feet, &amp;#147;if
that is what you wish, Dominus.&amp;#148;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

Gideon watched her pull herself up from her kneeling
position despite her hefty restraint and smirked slightly, she certainly was
graceful given her situation. After another moment he finally muttered half
under his breath, &amp;#147;Wait.� You
are here to please me, yes?&amp;#148;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

Collette finally turned her attention back to him and
nodded as best she could, &amp;#147;Yes, Dominus.� That is my role.&amp;#148;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

He couldn&amp;#146;t just send the girl back without
releasing her to a painful fate, but neither did he want to abuse some
15-year-old girl for no reason.� His mind
found a middle ground that irritated him a considerable deal,
&amp;#147;Conversation would please me.&amp;#148;� He was obviously lying, and Collette knew
it.� But the girl smiled slightly as he
spared her from certain punishment.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

&amp;#147;Thank you, Dominus.� I would be delighted to engage you in
conversation,&amp;#148; she fell immediately back to her knees facing
him.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

Gideon rose to his feet effortlessly and tossed his suite
jacket back onto the couch where he&amp;#146;d once been sitting.� A single finger reached up to loosen his tie
slightly as he studied the girl further.�
Once his own comfort was ensured a little more he tilted his head to the
side, &amp;#147;You can&amp;#146;t possibly be comfortable like
that.&amp;#148;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

&amp;#147;I am comfortable in whatever position or restraints
you wish me to be comfortable in, Dominus.&amp;#148;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

Gideon rolled his eyes slightly behind his sunglasses and
sighed a forced noise, &amp;#147;First thing.�
If you are going to irritate me all night, at least stop calling me
Dominus.&amp;#148;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

Collette nodded again as best she could, &amp;#147;Yes,
Master.&amp;#148;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

&amp;#147;Not that either,&amp;#148; he nearly
barked.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

For a moment the girl looked stunned as if she
didn&amp;#146;t know what to do. Every man in her world was either Master or
Dominus, &amp;#147;Then what should I call you, Ma&amp;#133;
ummm&amp;#133;&amp;#148;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

Gideon chuckled slightly and shrugged, &amp;#147;Try
Mal.&amp;#148;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

Collette blinked a single time and actually let her eyes
meet his shaded ones for the first time ever, &amp;#147;Mal?&amp;#148;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

&amp;#147;Yes,&amp;#148; Gideon responded quietly,
&amp;#147;It&amp;#146;s a nick name,&amp;#148; he held up a stern finger and
continued with an equally stern voice, &amp;#147;and one not many are allowed
to use!&amp;#148;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

Collette smiled weakly, &amp;#147;I am unaware of how
much of this building my Domina has wired for sound.� If she caught me addressing you in such a
manor, I would certainly be punished mercilessly for such an improper address
of someone of higher station,&amp;#148; she thought for a moment and raised an
eyebrow, &amp;#147;Can we perhaps find a middle ground with the term,
sir?&amp;#148;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

Gideon nodded a little and shrugged, &amp;#147;I
suppose.� Now, as I was saying
before.� Are you comfortable?� And I don&amp;#146;t want some programmed
response where you tell me that whatever I want is what you
want.&amp;#148;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

Collette narrowed her eyes slightly. They were suddenly
treading on dangerous waters.� The
slightest slip of the tongue could wind her up in a world of hurt.� Was he trying to make her feel comfortable to
trap her?� Did he want to make her fail
her Domina so that Vasser would punish her? It was a distinct possibility.� She knew that most of Vampire kind were
sadistic monsters.� Perhaps that was
Gideon&amp;#146;s game. She knew little about his type though.� She was familiar with her Domina&amp;#146;s
ancestry. She knew that Vasser was descended from the Marquis De Sade himself,
part of his particularly cruel Bloodline that belonged to a large body of
Vampires calling themselves Domus Luxuria.�
But she knew nothing of Gideon&amp;#146;s ancestry or what their vices
and depravities were.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

Fearfully she licked her lips slightly and dropped her
attention to the floor while she thought.�
After a moment she took a deep breathe and returned her gaze to his,
taking a single giant leap, &amp;#147;No, sir.�
I am uncomfortable.&amp;#148;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

Gideon nodded a little and moved around behind her and
began to unbuckle and then unlace the restraints that held her arms behind her
back.� She flexed her shoulders slightly
with a tiny moan as he pulled the device off her body.� Gideon noticed that the tiny locks that held
her corset on her body were also removed.�
It was obvious that Vasser intended him to use this poor girl in any way
he&amp;#146;d wanted.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

&amp;#147;How about this?&amp;#148; he said running his
hand over the smooth leather of her corset, &amp;#147;And this?&amp;#148; he
said touching the strict collar that held her head.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

Collette regressed back from trusting him completely as
her own hand touched her collar lightly.�
She couldn&amp;#146;t remember the last time she was without one.� It was far too much for her to ask him to
completely remove her restraints so instead she fell back on her programmed
response, &amp;#147;Whatever pleases you, sir.&amp;#148;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

Gideon began to remove the buckles from her corset and as
soon as it was loose, helped her to slip free.�
It was tossed effortlessly to the floor along with her collar the moment
he had removed that as well.� Her still
latex clad hand reached up to touch her neck lightly, feeling flesh there for
this first time in ages.� Gideon had
turned his back on her and made his way across the living room.� She took that opportunity to stand to her full
height and reach to her side.� In a
single tug the leather tie that was holding her skirt on came loose and that
garment dropped to her feet as well.� Her
hands fell to her sides and her chin up proudly as she waited for Gideon to
turn.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

The moment he looked back at her she spoke softly,
&amp;#147;Thank you, sir.� Please take what
you wish.&amp;#148;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

Gideon&amp;#146;s eyes looked over her for a moment
passively.� Though he gave no outward
expression, something horrifying caught his eye immediately.� She was completely hairless from the neck
down and where her sex should have been there was only a metal plate.� It look liked a tiny ovular piece of silvery
sheet metal.� It covered just where her
pussy should have been and was affixed to her body by dozens of small surface
piercings, making it appear riveted to her flesh.� A tiny section of the metal was perforated so
that she could handle any business that would be required in the
bathroom.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

She barely caught his eyes focused on that from behind
his sunglasses and her face turned to worry, &amp;#147;I apologize sir, but I
am not permitted to give that.&amp;#148;�
She took a step towards him, fear filling her eyes to think that she
could not please him and that only one thing would result: punishment,
&amp;#147;But you may use me in any other way you wish!&amp;#148;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

&amp;#147;You&amp;#146;ve never&amp;#133;&amp;#148;
Gideon began, his normally stoic voice filled with a tiny mix of horror and
wonder.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

&amp;#147;Had regular sex?&amp;#148; she nodded a little,
&amp;#147;The day I turned 13.� I was
bent over a table and strapped down.�
Many of the Domina&amp;#146;s male slaves that were permitted to use
their genitals had their way with me for the better part of a week,&amp;#148;
she spoke about such a horrific event as if it was a casual affair.� Gideon was more then a little skilled at
reading people and he could see repression and trauma when it stared him in the
face.� He remained silent however, and
let the girl continue, &amp;#147;All the while, my Domina used her kinds
abilities to make the experience all that much more&amp;#133;&amp;#148;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

Gideon interrupted her while she searched for an
appropriate word, &amp;#147;Horrible?&amp;#148;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

Collette swallowed slightly and gave him an uneasy smile,
&amp;#147;No&amp;#133; wonderful.� I
would only find out days later once this,&amp;#148; she motioned to the metal
shield, &amp;#147;was attached to me,&amp;#148; the girl paused and shifted
uneasily while Gideon studied her, his gaze penetrating directly into her
eyes.� For her part, her stare could no
longer meet his and she returned her attention to the
&amp;#145;proper&amp;#146; place for her status, the floor.� Finally she cleared her throat and continued,
&amp;#147;She wanted me to know what I would never have
again.&amp;#148;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

There was an uneasy tension that filled the room for a
moment and finally Gideon broke it, &amp;#147;I&amp;#146;m going to take a shower.� Make yourself
comfortable.&amp;#148;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

Collette&amp;#146;s eyes nearly snapped up to his and
were immediately filled with pleading, &amp;#147;Allow me to help you,
sir?&amp;#148;� He looked at her
questioningly for a moment so she feel inclined to explain, &amp;#147;I hate to
feel useless&amp;#133;&amp;#148;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

Gideon scowled slightly and rolled his eyes,
&amp;#147;Fine&amp;#133; but that&amp;#146;s all your
doing.&amp;#148;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

&amp;#147;Yes, sir,&amp;#148; she said with a slight
smile and trotted after him into the spacious bathroom.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

The room was tiled in all white with gold accents.� The floor space of the bathroom was nearly as
large as the room Gideon called his &amp;#145;bedroom&amp;#146; back home.
Though in truth his bedroom was a partitioned section of his apartment with a
mattress on the floor.� There were two
full sinks, two toilets, a raised hot tub and a shower that could probably fit
six people comfortably.� Collette quickly
removed the last articles of her own clothing, her shoes and the latex gloves
and stockings that she wore.� They were
neatly folded and placed on the counter top.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

Gideon had hardly had a moment to take in the entire
surroundings before she was waiting attentively for him. Without even being
asked, she had gathered up a fluffy white towel and placed it on the counter
near the shower. Trained to service anyone&amp;#146;s needs she immediately
noticed how the lights caused Gideon to squint noticeably, even behind his
sunglasses.� Still without prompting she
made her way to an adjustment knob and turned the setting down considerably
until the room was dimly lit.� She
couldn&amp;#146;t help but deny that it made the atmosphere a little more
romantic.� Her actual mission, after all,
was to gather information and men talked better in bed then they did out of it.
Still, there was something else in her motives that even she couldn&amp;#146;t
place a finger on.&lt;BR&gt;

Gideon&amp;#146;s bank account, given his work and age
were extensive to say the least.�
However, his Spartan attitude and way of life caused him to often forget
to take care of his possessions properly.�
This was evidenced by his casual removal of his expensive tie and the
way he cast it to the floor.� Only his
weaponry was well maintained.� Almost
everything else he owned was merely a tool that could be easily
replaced.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

Collette was not so haphazard in her affairs and she
immediately stooped to gather up his tie, fold it perfectly and place it next
to the towels.� This continued with each
garment; it was removed, cast aside carelessly, gathered up and set aside
neatly. His boots were placed beneath the counter in perfectly alignment with
the edge. Though she wasn&amp;#146;t obsessive compulsive, enough beatings
could instill that kind of care in anyone.�
As soon as Gideon had removed his clothing and Collette had set it aside
he stretched slightly, looking around to get himself a towel before he noticed
that she had already done that.� By the
time he turned his attention back to her, she was already preparing the water
and adjusting it for temperature.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

&amp;#147;How do you like your water, sir?&amp;#148; she
asked just loudly enough to be heard above the din.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

&amp;#147;Steaming,&amp;#148; he responded idly while he
continued to observe the lavish suite he had been given.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

After a few moments, hot steam was pouring out from the
opening in the smoked glass that separated the shower stall.� Collette was standing by it with a practiced
smile on her face.� Gideon only nodded once
and stepped into the water, followed by the girl.� &amp;#147;I can bathe myself,&amp;#148; he
stated to her.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

&amp;#147;But why should you have to?&amp;#148; she asked
with genuine inquisition.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

&amp;#147;You aren&amp;#146;t going to take no for an
answer, are you?&amp;#148;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

&amp;#147;No, sir.&amp;#148;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

Gideon nodded a little and turned his back to her,
resting his arms and head against the wall, &amp;#147;Fine then&amp;#133; you
can wash my back.&amp;#148;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

Collette nodded and began soaping a washcloth.� For those few moments she let herself study
his physique in detail.� He was nearly
perfect, but most Vampires, she had found, were impressive physical
specimens.� She had learned over the
years that there were two kinds.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

The first were those born to a parent who is a
Vampire.� She was told this was very
rare.� If the mother is the human parent
and the father the Vampire, usually the mother dies during child birth.� Very rarely are such pregnancies even carried
to term.� If the father was mortal and the
mother the Vampire, it is nearly impossible for him to impregnate her.� In any case, she heard rumor that these
creatures were pre-born.� The moment they
are conceived they attain full consciousness and even fragmented memories of
their parents.� This is said to have a
traumatic effect on the child.� Something
else is said to happen during their development.� Something darker that taints all of their
minds, but what it was, Collette could never discern. These born Vampires were
call Pure Bloods and mature to adult hood in 15 to 18 years and they spend the
rest of their lives appearing to be in there early 20&amp;#146;s. The oldest
known of their kind stretches back to the time of the Persian Empire.
&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

The second type of Vampire were said to be much weaker,
but more common.� These &amp;#145;Half
Bloods&amp;#146;, are those normal humans who are given a chance to ingest the
blood of the Pure on three separate occasions.�
These Half Bloods cease aging at the moment of their transformation and
are said to be more stable creatures then those of a pure lineage. These can
appear in any manor that a human being could.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

Gideon was well muscled, though not overtly so.� He was more toned and lithe then anything
else.� Standing nearly six and a half
feet tall he likely weighted in at 230 lbs of solid muscle.� His complexion was ashen, like most of his
kind, though it didn&amp;#146;t seem to be quite as pallor as most. Collette
didn&amp;#146;t quite understand why.� He
had a strong jaw line and broad shoulders and was what any woman would consider
a nearly perfect male.� His hair was dark
and shaved close around the sides and back with the top only slightly
longer.� His eyes were a shade of purple
unfound in humanity and resembled a mix of animal and human more then purely
human.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

Collette&amp;#146;s hand traced over a number of slight
ridges over his back that were obviously faded scars, she had enough of her own
to recognize.� She cleared her throat
slightly and barely murmured, &amp;#147;Sir, if I may ask&amp;#133; how are
you&amp;#133; scarred.� I was under the
impression that those born to be Vampires could regenerate damaged tissue from
birth. Surely someone of your reputation is not&amp;#133;&amp;#148;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

Gideon turned to face her and lean his back against the
shower wall.� Water poured down on both
of them a dozen spouts that lined the shower stall at various heights.� He couldn&amp;#146;t deny a slight stirring
while he took in her wet, shinnying body and her vibrant hair plastered to her
face. But he refused to let any emotion get the better of him; it could only end
badly, &amp;#147;No. I&amp;#146;m not.�
We are born capable of regeneration, but there are wounds grievous
enough even for our kind to leave marks.�
Especially for my Bloodline during the daylight
hours.&amp;#148;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

&amp;#147;Daylight hours?&amp;#148; Collette inquired
with her head tilted to the side.� For the
moment she had forgotten her proper self and simply wanted to know
more.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

Gideon nodded slightly, &amp;#147;My Bloodline can move
about during the day, even in direct sunlight.�
However, from the time the sun rises until it sets we are barely more then
mortals.&amp;#148;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

Collette&amp;#146;s eyes narrowed slightly. How strange:
a vampire that could move about in the sun.�
For the moment she put aside her questions and returned to the activity
at hand.� He turned back to face the wall
and she began to scrub his body clean. Covering his entire left shoulder was an
ornate black and white tattoo.� Collette
studied it for a moment while she cleaned him.�
She finally came to the conclusion that it was a symbol she had never
seen and could not identify.� She had
heard that all Pure Bloods were born with a birthmark that symbolized their
House, or Domus as they referred to it in Latin.� It was always the same, in the same place and
appeared to be a black and white tattoo.�
Her hand instinctively ran over the ink that she had just above the
metal shield between her legs.� Her
Domina had placed her own s symbol on her body, marking her as property
effectively.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

After several moments of cleaning, Gideon turned back to
face her.� He found her gazing up at him
almost adoringly.� His hand took hers
lightly in an attempt to remove the washcloth from her grip. Instead however
the girl rested both of her small hands on his vast chest and stretched up on
her tip toes to press her lips against his.�
It was a hell of a stretch for the five foot seven inch girl, but she
managed to reach.� For a moment, Gideon
allowed her to do so.� He seemed almost
to be lost in the moment.� It was daring
of her, especially given her status in life and how little she knew him.� He could report such rash behavior to her
Domina and Collette would find herself suspended and whipped for days.� Still, the silver ring in her lip pressed
tightly against Gideon&amp;#146;s lips while her pierced tongue attempted to
pass between them.� It was then that he
pulled away and pressed his back against the wall.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

For a moment, Collette didn&amp;#146;t know what to
do.� Making a snap decision and another
bold move she dropped to her knees and opened her mouth.� Her intentions were obvious and as she moved
towards him, Gideon&amp;#146;s hand reached out to snatch her hair
roughly.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

&amp;#147;You don&amp;#146;t want this,&amp;#148; he said
with a hushed growl.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

Collette fell back on her programmed response once more,
&amp;#147;It&amp;#146;s not about what I want, sir&amp;#133;&amp;#148;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

Gideon&amp;#146;s eyes narrowed harshly down at her and
all progress the two had made seemingly vanished in an instant.� He became just as cold and distant as he had
been the moment she&amp;#146;d met, &amp;#147;Fine.� This isn&amp;#146;t what I want then.� I believe we are done here.&amp;#148;� He said nothing more as he released her and
stepped out of the shower.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

Collette rose to her feet quietly and shut off the water,
&amp;#147;As you wish, Dominus.&amp;#148;�
As if her tone and words were not enough to signal it, Gideon could
actually feel the girls mood shift.� Just
as he had pulled away from her and become distant, she reverted to her well
trained self. She was formal, polite and submissive.� Her eyes were planted to the floor as she
exited the shower.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

She immediately gathered a towel and fell once again to
her knees, her gaze always on his feet as she dried him selflessly.� For that awkward moment, not a word was
exchanged between them.� Only when she
was satisfied that he was completely dried did she fold the towel up and placed
it in the hamper.� She then stood at
perfect attention; her legs spread slightly, eyes on the floor and her hands
behind her back.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

Gideon looked her over for a moment and scowled slightly,
&amp;#147;I apologize&amp;#133;&amp;#148;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

Collette closed her eyes slightly and uttered softly,
&amp;#147;There is no need to apologize, Dominus.� I am here strictly for your
pleasure.&amp;#148;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

Gideon nodded a little and started to exit the bathroom,
&amp;#147;I believe that is all I will need this evening.&amp;#148;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

Collette nodded only once, &amp;#147;If that is your
wish, Dominus.&amp;#148;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

When he returned to the living room he noticed a black
leather backpack was seated on the couch.�
It was from his car.� He had always
traveled light, but did come prepared for most eventualities. Thankfully he had
some lighter closes to wear to bed.� Only
moments later he had riffled through it and found a pair of cotton draw string
pants that flowed around him loosely.� It
was warm enough where that would suffice for the night.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

A moment of curiosity caused him to look back into the
back and he chuckled softly.� Of course
they had removed his other assorted firearms and knifes before they dropped it
off in his room.� Still, it unnerved him
slightly that someone had gone in his car without his knowledge.� He dismissed the thought for a moment and
glanced around the room.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

Only a moment later he ducked his head back into the
bathroom to find Collette still standing there, soaking and shivering,
&amp;#147;Why don&amp;#146;t you dry yourself off and go to
bed?&amp;#148;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

Collette nodded slightly, &amp;#147;Of course,
Dominus.� Where would you like me to
sleep?&amp;#148;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

Gideon shrugged slightly, &amp;#147;Wherever you
like.&amp;#148;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

Collette sighed a frustrated noise and clenched her teeth
together, &amp;#147;I have to insist once more that my desires do not factor
into it, Dominus.� Where would
&lt;I&gt;you&lt;/I&gt; like me to sleep?&amp;#148;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

Gideon sighed slightly, &amp;#147;Would you like to sleep
in the bed,&amp;#148; he eyed the apartment beyond the bathroom,
&amp;#147;I&amp;#146;m sure it&amp;#146;s large enough for
two.&amp;#148;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

Collette wanted to scream out that she would love to
sleep in bed with him. She would love for him to do anything to her.� Every moment with him was like heaven
compared to her Domina.� But she had
learned her lesson.� If their
relationship was to continue to be amicable she had to learn they were not
friends and she could not treat him like such, not that the girl had any real
notion of what a friend was, &amp;#147;If that would please you,
Dominus.&amp;#148;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

Gideon rolled his eyes a little and nodded, &amp;#147;It
would.&amp;#148;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

Only then did the girl move.� She toweled herself off swiftly and exited
the bathroom, following a few feet behind Gideon as he made his way towards the
bedroom.� Sure enough the bedroom was as
spectacular as he imagined it would be. The bed was nothing short of a
four-poster king sized and the room itself was amazing.� The sheets that adorned the bed were
obviously silk and there was a small sitting area about the size of his
&amp;#145;living room&amp;#146; in LA.�
Gideon mused to himself how all of this was wasted on someone that
required so little.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

He meandered across the room and inspected a closet on
the opposite side.� He smirked slightly
and raised a brow.� It was filled with
all manors of devices that he had no doubt Vasser intended him to use on the
poor girl that she had sent him. Whips, chains, restraints and various leather
garments that appeared about her size filled the alcove.� Shaking his head slightly he closed the doors
and turned to see Collette looking at him expectantly. For a moment there was a
hint of hope she would perhaps have a little play.� The moment she saw him close the closet
however, her heart sank.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

He slipped into bed quietly and laid his head back on one
of the pillows, folding both his hands beneath.�
Only after he had made himself comfortable did she slip in beside
him.� For a moment she considered if she
should remain at a distance.� Ultimately
however, she decided that everyone likes a warm body snuggled up against him or
her in bed, at least she imagined.� She
had never really &lt;I&gt;slept&lt;/I&gt; with anyone before, as in over night
in a bed together.� She laid down mostly
on her side, one arm folded under her body the other resting on his chest
lightly.� Her head she placed on the
other side of his upper torso.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

For a second Gideon almost pulled away.� Instead however, he resigned to this small annoyance
and grumbled.� Why anyone would want
someone else laying in bed with him or her was beyond him, especially this
close.� For the moment however, he grit
his teeth slightly and wrapped one of his arms around her back. The contented
coo that emanated from her body signed that she enjoyed the attention and he
resigned himself to deal with it tonight.�
The only eerie presence was that he could feel the cool metal shield
that tortured her pressed against his thigh.�
The cruelty of war was familiar to him and Gideon was guilty of any
number of wartime atrocities.� But this
kind of cruelty was completely foreign.�
Cruelty for it&amp;#146;s own sake.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

Shaking his head he closed his eyes.� He would only have to put up with it and her
for tonight.� Tomorrow when he met with
Vasser he would explain that he appreciated the gesture, but that he
didn&amp;#146;t want this girl near him.�
Everything would be much simpler then&amp;#133;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;/BODY&gt;

&lt;/HTML&gt;
