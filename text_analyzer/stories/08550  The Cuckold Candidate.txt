Introduction
The inspiration for this one came to me in a pub. That&#8217;s right, people. I drink (very occasionally). Get over it.
I saw a beautiful couple sitting over on the other side of the dimly lit pub. As in, the girl was beautiful, quite sensationally so. The guy, not so much. I&#8217;ve seen my own butt in the mirror (That&#8217;s not one of my habits, by the way. I just happened to see it in passing), and the dude&#8217;s face looked worse than that. They were making out while they were drinking. They truly enjoyed each other&#8217;s company. I felt kind of warm watching them together (or maybe it was just the vodka) but the point is this- I didn&#8217;t feel jealous of the guy at all. I wanted to go over, submit myself to them and become their slave.
You see, unlike most �femdomists� or kinks or whatever the hell we&#8217;re called, I don&#8217;t consider females the superior race of human beings. Even though this site is all about �female domination� stories, the thing that makes the domme (Priya) supreme isn&#8217;t the fact that she&#8217;s feminine. I believe that there&#8217;s a sovereign class of people, consisting of both men and women. The �born winners�, the charismatic people, the leaders, etc belong to this class which is, quite simply, superior to the other classes of people.
Therefore I fantasize a lot about being slave to a couple, as you see in most of my stories like �Mistress Priya&#8217;s Cuckold Slaves� and �The Slavedog Millionaire.�
This story is another such couple domination fantasy, under construction. Which means it&#8217;s prone to drastic changes and that more chapters are coming soon. Perhaps the first thing to change is the title.
�What the hell is a cuckold candidate?� you might ask.
�I don&#8217;t know. I was trying to write a story about how a man feels so small when he sees a beautiful couple, that he goes over and begs them to take him as their slave.�
I will rename this soon, hopefully. Cheers!

A strange proposition
Rahul walked across the college campus&#8217;s empty parking lot and looked around for his cruiser, an Enfield Thunderbird, parked somewhere in the last row. It was late in the evening, and the day had long since ended. He had been late to college that morning, and that was the place where late-comers would usually end up parking.
The college ground lights provided all the light available at that time, but his silver bodied bike was still as visible as it was in bright daylight. The vehicle stood exactly where he had left it-solitary and proud as a majestic ruler. He fished out the keys from his pocket, sat down on the front seat and smiled. Just sitting on the handsome bike made him feel like a man.
He prepared the bike&#8217;s kick starter and gave it a hard, telling kick. The engine&#8217;s sound resonated in the empty college campus. It had an incredibly manly feel to it. He switched to first gear and moved the bike forward a few inches, when he saw Sanjeev running towards him from afar. �Hey, Rahul, wait up!�
Rahul turned off the bike&#8217;s engine. �What is it man?�
�Rahul, do you have a minute? I wanted to ask you a question.� Sanjeev said.
�What kind of question?�
�Umm...it's kind of long and complicated. Just tell me whether you have a minute, man.�
�Okay, I do.� Rahul said, folding his arms close. �Tell me.�
Sanjeev looked around the parking lot- it was still empty. He swallowed hard. �This is it.�
�What is it?�
Sanjeev slowly set his bag down on the sandy ground and got down on his knees. He joined his hands together and prayed to Rahul like he was praying to God. �Rahul, you are by far the greatest man in the world!�
�Umm�dude,� Rahul said, �I&#8217;m not gay.�
�Oh, neither am I, Rahul.� Sanjeev said. �But please let me finish.�
�Okay.� Rahul said.
�Now Priya is your girlfriend, isn&#8217;t she?�
�She is.�
�And you both have been together for six months. You must be the greatest man in the world to get a girl like her.� Sanjeev said, closing his eyes and praying. He then bowed down and kissed Rahul&#8217;s black leather shoe. �Rahul, you are a God among men. I bow to your greatness!�
Rahul smiled as he watched the man kissing his shoes clean. �What are you doing dude?" Sanjeev kept on kissing the shoe profusely, his ears forgot all about delivering Rahul's query to his brain. "While you're at it, kiss my other shoe. That way, I don&#8217;t have to polish them tomorrow.�
Sanjeev got up and quickly raced to the other side of the bike, bowed down and kissed Rahul&#8217;s shoe. �Thanks for letting me do this, Rahul.�
�You&#8217;re welcome.� Rahul said. �But it&#8217;s getting late, and you&#8217;ve taken much more than a minute.�
�I&#8217;m sorry. Please forgive me, your Highness.� Sanjeev said. He hugged Rahul&#8217;s legs and began to massage them. �I am terribly sorry. I will do anything to make up for it, Rahul. But I will need some more time to explain what I wanted to��
�Go on�,� Rahul said, taking a heavy breath.
�Rahul, when I see you with Priya my heart fills up with joy.� Sanjeev said. �You both are so amazing together.�
�You don&#8217;t feel jealous?�
�Not at all, Rahul. Priya should be with a man like you. Not with someone like me.� Sanjeev said.
�So you don&#8217;t dream of my girlfriend every night like the rest of the guys in our class?�
�I dream of Priya every minute of every day and night, Rahul.� Sanjeev said. �But in all my dreams, I am like a servant to her. She orders me to do things for her and I spend all my efforts obeying her orders.�
�What does this fantasy Priya order you to do?�
�She orders me to massage her legs, to clean her house, to cook dinner for her and watch her eat while I starve.� Sanjeev said.
�You&#8217;re a slave to her beauty.� Rahul said.
�Exactly!� Sanjeev cried emphatically. �You always know the exact words to say to people. I think that's what makes you a ladies' man.�
�Well, I knew it this time because Priya has tons of slaves. When she snaps her fingers, a dozen guys come running to her from everywhere, waiting to serve her.� Rahul said. �You&#8217;re not the first one in the world to feel that way.�
�Oh,� Sanjeev's shoulders sagged. �But man,� he shook his head, �You and Priya. You&#8217;re both like two supreme beings. Sovereigns. And I feel good just thinking of serving a beautiful couple like you and her in my life. I&#8217;m but an inferior being.�
�Apparently,� Rahul said, gesturing to his shoes. Sanjeev began to lick them again. �But you&#8217;re doing very well in your medical exams, aren&#8217;t you?�
�I am, Rahul. But that would be so�you know��
�Pointless?� Rahul finished. �Unfulfilling?�
�Yes, unfulfilling. I&#8217;d rather spend my life serving sovereign beings like you and Priya.� Sanjeev said.
�In that case, I am going to give you your first order.�
�What is it, Rahul? Tell me.�
�Come to our place today. Priya and I will evaluate you and tell you whether you are worthwhile or not.� Rahul said.
�Wow.� Tears rushed out of Sanjeev's eyes. �I don&#8217;t know how to thank you, Rahul.�
�Come, sit on the backseat!� Rahul said.
Sanjeev got up and sat on the cruiser&#8217;s seat. �No, wait. I can&#8217;t do this,� Rahul said.
�What, Rahul?�
�I&#8217;m a sovereign being and you are a lowly slave candidate. I can&#8217;t let you sit on my cruiser seat.� Rahul said.
�I&#8217;m sorry, Rahul.� Sanjeev said, jumping off the seat.
�Catch the bus and come over to our place�,� Rahul said. �We&#8217;ll talk then.�
Honey, I brought home a slave
 �Honey, I&#8217;m home!� Rahul said as he stepped into the large mansion. Two slaves appeared from upstairs, one to take his bag and the other to escort him to the grand dining table where they would serve him dinner.
�Really? &#8216;Honey, I&#8217;m home&#8217;? We sound just like a middle-aged married couple.� Priya said, greeting him in the living room with a luscious kiss.
�Is that so?� Rahul said. �What else should I say when I walk into our house?�
�Just� you know�� Priya mused. �Oh, never mind. I&#8217;m too tired to even think now.�
�Oh no! That&#8217;s not good.�
�Why? What&#8217;s wrong?�
�It&#8217;s just that someone is coming over to our place.� Rahul said.
�Who is it?�
�You know Sanjeev?�
�The fat geek from our class?�
�Yeah.�
�He&#8217;s coming here? Now?� Priya inquired and Rahul nodded for both. �Why?�
�He kissed my shoes and begged me to take him as our slave.� Rahul said.
�And you said yes?�
�I said we both would consider it.� Rahul said. �He seemed really genuine about his desire to become our slave.�
�So? You just said yes?�
�I did. Tell me what&#8217;s wrong with just evaluating one more guy.�
�We have tons of slaves, Rahul.� Priya said. �Look around. They&#8217;re crawling all over the place like rats. I was considering a downsize.�
�But what if this guy is better than them?� Rahul asked. Priya stayed quiet. �Think about it. Our mansion has ten floors. We could use some extra manpower.�
�I suppose.� Priya said, kissing him on the mouth. �Let&#8217;s finish dinner now.�
The couple went over to the kitchen and began to eat their dinner. Half a dozen multi-tasking slaves cooked their dinner, took their orders, cleaned up their plates and brought them their wine.
During the dinner, the doorbell rang. Rahul ordered one of the slaves to get the door. �Someone called Sanjeev, Sir?� the slave returned to the kitchen and reported.
�Make him wait outside.� Rahul said. �In the cold.�
�Understood, master.� The slave said, taking leave and going over to the front door to obey the order.
Sanjeev was informed of where he was to wait, and the slave slammed the door on his face. The hostility was understandable- the slave didn&#8217;t want his position to be jeopardized. Sanjeev went over to the courtyard and noticed a window through which he could see Priya and Rahul in their dining suite. The couple enjoyed their sumptuous meal served by swift, competent slaves, and their pleasant conversation with each other while he stood outside, shivering in the cold. The only source of warmth at that point was the love he saw between Priya and Rahul- the way he touched her shoulders, the way he looked into her eyes, the way he always made her laugh with classy humor. They were a perfect, cute couple who enjoyed everything about each other. A tear streamed down his cheek as he saw them eating and laughing- one single teardrop of joy and warmth. A strong wind blew eastwards, freezing the stream of tears as it did with everything else in its path.
Rahul and Priya finished their dessert, and then sat back to have one of the slaves use the toothpick in their mouths, just in case. Later, the couple went over to the front door and found Sanjeev sitting in the courtyard, with his hands wrapped around his body, shivering in the cold. �Get inside.� Rahul ordered.
�Thank you, Rahul.� Sanjeev obeyed quickly, getting into the mansion. He felt an instant sense of warmth inside, partly from the warmth of the central air-conditioners and partly from the glow inside, the very thought of surrendering his life to the sovereign couple. Their very presence put him into a trance, and he began to think about whether charisma like they had was a gift from God or whether it&#8217;s a practised skill, like cooking or medicine. Certainly a gift from God, he decided.
�You want to be our slave?� Priya asked. She began to climb the stairs to the first floor, and turned towards the bedroom.
�Yes, Priya. That is true.� Sanjeev said, following her and Rahul with respectable distance.
�I&#8217;m going to evaluate you tomorrow,� Priya explained, �with a variety of tests, failing which you would return to your normal life.�
�Normal is boring, Priya. I would do anything to succeed.�
�Let&#8217;s hope so.� Priya said, going into the bedroom. �Today, I just want to have sex with my boyfriend and sleep.�
�T�t�that&#8217;s wonderful��
�Kneel there.� Priya ordered, pointing at a spot on the floor next to the bed. Sanjeev did. Priya and Rahul tossed away their clothes and jumped into bed.
Rahul kissed Priya on the neck, tossing her into an instant trance. He understood her body so well, it was like he had a map of where to go and what to do at all times. Sanjeev watched them as they enjoyed each other&#8217;s warmth and seemed to have forgotten all about him, which was a good thing.
�Hey loser!� Priya suddenly called out to Sanjeev. �Have you had your dinner?�
�No, Priya. I&#8217;m starving.� Sanjeev answered, courteously.
�Good. Suck on my toes while we do it.� Priya said. �Go on. Suck them. The dirt under my toes is your dinner for today.�
�Thank you, Priya.� Sanjeev said, picking up the girl&#8217;s foot and enjoying his first taste of the good life- the right life for him.

The First Night of Slavery
Sanjeev stretched his hand forward at the darkness before him. His hands touched some of the plywood, which was less than twelve inches away from his head. There was darkness above, below, left, right, everywhere. Each time he stretched out his hands to touch something, he felt smooth, rich plywood in his hands. He examined every nook and corner of his wooden entrapment, checking for a sign of light, maybe a crack somewhere or a slit. Any source of light, no matter how minuscule. But there wasn&#8217;t any. He had never seen darkness so thorough, so engulfing. There was no telling what time it was, or how many hours he had spent in the coffin.
At some points, he thought of making a fist and punching through the wood. Sure, his hands would hurt. Sure, he might lose his very life. But it was a risk worthy of a venture- death was better than being trapped in a dark vacuum such as this. He made a fist with his hand, then stopped himself. No, he wasn&#8217;t entitled to make a noise. For he was thrown into a drawer beneath the couple&#8217;s bed after their night of beautiful, intense passion.
While the couple enjoyed each others&#8217; physical company, all he was allowed was a measly lick at Priya&#8217;s feet. The taste was beautiful, the presentation more so. And once Priya was blissfully asleep, Rahul opened up the large wooden drawer below the bed and ordered him to get in. Because, as Rahul said, the first thing the sovereign couple saw when they woke up should be each other, not a lowly slave such as himself. He wondered whether his body would even fit into the drawer, and unfortunately for him, it did. Only just barely, but it did.
Sanjeev closed his eyes and recollected the sensation of Priya&#8217;s feet in his tongue, the way his heart felt at that moment. He smiled, locked his hands together to form a makeshift pillow, placed his forehead into their clasp and tried to get some sleep. The wooden surface wasn&#8217;t conducive for such a high privilege, but it had to do for now.
Being a restless man, he had an extremely hard time staying still bonded under the supreme couple&#8217;s bed. Before this night, his life had no direction. He dreamed every night of how supreme Priya and Rahul were, what his life would be like if he could live in their servitude. Being denied of sleep and dinner and light, he wondered whether this was the right direction. But of course it was. He began to hear the couple&#8217;s loud snoring through the wood. He noticed how her snore stopped almost exactly when his started. A more perfect couple could not possibly exist anywhere- they complemented each other perfectly, even in sleep.
Eventually, Sanjeev fell asleep. He was in pain, but pain was good, pain was right for him.
An unknown number of hours later, he was awoken by some activity outside. He heard Rahul&#8217;s voice saying, �Wakey wakey, my love!� Strange, Sanjeev thought. He woke up off his own accord, without an alarm clock or any such thing. A complete, restful sleep was part of what made him the winner he is.
�Good morning!� Priya&#8217;s voice replied, with a discernible surge in her energy level.
�What do you wish to do today, Priya? How about some Yoga? Or a nice, sweaty workout in our private gymnasium?�
Priya&#8217;s voice answered. �I&#8217;d rather take a jog outside.�
It was early in the morning, he determined.
�You know what? Me too!� Rahul&#8217;s voice replied. �Let&#8217;s start stretching right away.�
The couple talked about other random things as they got out of bed, stretched their limbs and got into gear for their jog. A few more hours of silence would follow, but Sanjeev stopped himself from knocking on the wood. He thought they knew what they were doing, they had dealt with tons of slaves like him in the past. If he were to perish waiting in the darkness, that was right, too.
More hours passed. The couple returned and fondled with each other, conversing about how cold the weather was. It took a while for Priya to finally think of the human under their bed. �Hey, didn&#8217;t we have a slave in our room last night?�
�Oh, that&#8217;s right. Sanjeev was here.� Rahul said, making for the bed&#8217;s drawer. He pulled it open, and there he was, lying face-down, flat on the wooden surface.
�Hi!� Sanjeev greeted them with his eyes closed. The bedroom light seemed to poke into his being through his eyes. He blinked a few dozen times to get himself accustomed to light again.
�Sanjeev.� Priya said, shaking her head. �The bright geek from our very own class. What the hell happened to you?�
�Priya. A profound realization came over me.� Sanjeev said. �I saw you everyday, so beautiful, so rich and just such a winner in everything you do. I saw Rahul, an icon of a man himself.�
�We are, indeed, awesome people. Born winners and sovereigns.� Priya said, giggling and sharing a little high-five with Rahul. �But that doesn&#8217;t explain why you&#8217;re here.�
�The last few days, I have considered how much better my life would be if I just became a slave to the two of you.� Sanjeev said. �I am a slave-class human, a subservient.�
�Let me see if I understand you correctly.� Priya said, gesturing to a spot in front of seat in the bed. Sanjeev crawled over and knelt where she pointed. �Now, hold my leg and raise my foot up to your face.�
Sanjeev respectfully picked up the girl&#8217;s foot and brought it right before his face.
Priya began her paraphrase. �You, Sanjeev, with your brilliant, gifted mind could become a great doctor and save people&#8217;s lives. But you would rather spend your life serving at my feet, because you feel like you aren&#8217;t entitled to a good life?�
�Serving you would be the good life, Priya.� Sanjeev cried.
Priya took her foot back and then pushed it into his face with telling force, nearly breaking his nose into two pieces under her wet, muddy jogging shoes. �There, I just kicked your face. Tell me that didn&#8217;t hurt.�
�It did hurt, Priya.� Sanjeev shook his head, nursed his nose and sat back up. �But it was beautiful. Thank you so much, Priya.�
�You&#8217;d rather have that in your life, than the greatness that someone of your intelligence could have?� Priya asked.
�Yes, Priya. Please feel my heart, feel how excited I am to receive that kick from you.� Sanjeev said, grabbing Priya&#8217;s hand.
She brushed him off and slapped him on the head. �Hey, get away from me, you filthy inferior soul. I don&#8217;t touch my slaves, much less a slave candidate such as yourself.�
�I&#8217;m sorry, Priya.� Sanjeev said.
�You do know that my slaves aren&#8217;t entitled to food or clothes and receive harsh punishment from me and Rahul?� Priya asked. �Many of my slaves die for me in less than a month of service.�
�That would be the right life and death for me, Priya.� Sanjeev said. �Please grant me the chance.�
�What do you say, Rahul?� Priya asked. �You&#8217;ve been awfully quiet.�
�Oh, I&#8217;ve got nothing to say.� Rahul said. �You decide this one&#8217;s fate, honey.�
�Alright, Sanjeev.� Priya said. �You seem genuinely serious. But I&#8217;ll give you one last chance to back out of all this and return to your normal life. Last chance.�
�I won&#8217;t take it, Priya. For once in my life, I&#8217;m truly sure of what I want.�
�In that case, run to the cellar under the stairs and fetch me slave72. We are going to give you your very first test now.� Priya said.
�slave72 ?�
�My fastest and strongest slave yet. I&#8217;m going to put the two of you in a few contests. If you prove yourself successfully, we will take you in as our slave.�
�I&#8217;m ready, Priya.� Sanjeev said, making for the door. �I&#8217;ll go fetch you your slave.�
�But wait just a minute.� Priya said. She gestured for him to return to the kneeling position before her feet. �You see, I&#8217;ve got tons of slaves. So when you bring him back, I might get confused about which one of you is the slave and which, the candidate.�
�But you can recognize me by my face, Priya�� Sanjeev said.
�Why should a sovereign being like me care about my slaves&#8217; faces?� Priya laughed. �Remembering who they are and what they do� that&#8217;s too much effort for my mind.�
�That is true, Priya.� Sanjeev surrendered his forehead before her feet and kissed the ground.
�By the way, you aren&#8217;t even supposed to show me your face.� Priya said. �Keep your head low.� Sanjeev obediently hung his head low.
�Since I don&#8217;t care about my slaves&#8217; faces, nor do I ever look at them, I use marks to indicate their position. For example, a mark on the neck differentiates a slave from a candidate.� Priya said. �My slaves would have a mark on their chest.�
�Should I fetch you a marker pen, Priya?�
�No.� Priya said. Her foot landed heavily on the candidate&#8217;s neck. �I&#8217;m going to carve it out with my sharp toenail.�
�Please go ahead, Priya.� Sanjeev tightened his neck and his skin, ready for the branding. The toenail landed vertically on his neck and crushed down into his skin, The sharp edge of the toenail ran smooth through his skin and made its way toward his neck bone. Priya wiggled her toe around to make a deeper incision into his skin. Sanjeev felt his own blood ooze out of his neck, but kept himself restrained in still surrender. A deep, visible cut was now on his neck.
�That is how I brand humans who are &#8216;not yet my slave&#8217;.� Priya giggled.
�Thank you, Priya.�
�You can go now. Fetch me my slave72.� Priya said, letting go of her candidate&#8217;s neck. �Let&#8217;s see how you do��


Throwdown
Sanjeev felt a glow take over his soul as he crawled down the marble stairs in Priya&#8217;s house. It wasn&#8217;t that he had the job of his dreams yet, but he was being given one chance at it. If he won a contest of the Royal couple&#8217;s choosing with a slave named 72, he would become their new slave for life. He had dreamed of this job for much too long- whatever the test was, he was going to put his heart and soul into it. Of course, the other slave would do the same, so would boil down to a matter of who had more soul, who wanted it badly enough. That created a bit of optimism in his heart- nobody could want to serve Priya and Rahul more than he.
He felt a little awkward climbing down the stairs on his hands and knees, but got used to it quicker than he&#8217;d thought. Soon, he was down at the bottommost of the circular flight of stairs, so he turned around towards the cellar. He ventured into the little room, wherein he found six naked slaves, each with their hands and legs tied together, each having starved the whole night as they had several nights before, each living and breathing with one sole purpose.
�72?� Sanjeev called out.
�Me, me!� One of the slaves said. Sanjeev took a good gander at the slave- he had a strong, muscular frame which supported his tall, athletic body. His heart sank at the very sight of his adversary. If each of Priya&#8217;s slaves were this well-built and trained, what were his chances of his equaling him, much less beating him in a contest?
�Priya is calling you up.� Sanjeev said, untying the slave&#8217;s ropes and stepping away. The maverick stood up and shook his shoulders ready, proud and naked. The slave had an intimidating build; he was nearly as muscular as Rahul himself. The dream of becoming Priya and Rahul&#8217;s slave drifted farther away every moment.
Sanjeev decided to stop looking at the slave. He turned around and headed up the stairs, remembering to crawl on his hands and knees. Step by step, he climbed up as fast as he could, but was quickly overtaken by slave 72. Priya was obviously not kidding about him being the fastest and strongest slave she had. He began to wonder how a man like that could accept a life as her slave, when he might just as well take Rahul&#8217;s place as her boyfriend. Being her boyfriend was the best thing in the world, and being her slave was the second best- a life without her was as mundane as death itself, he supposed this was the thinking behind a strong, muscular man being her slave.
Sanjeev entered the bedroom, far behind the slave. He considered it a good strategy to save up his energy for whatever contest she had planned out for him. Priya and Rahul were waiting for him as he entered, hands on their hips, angry expressions on their faces. �What took you so long?� Priya asked, breathing a fire with her voice.
�I&#8217;m so sorry, Priya.� Sanjeev said.
�As a candidate, you need to show a lot more eagerness than that.� Priya warned.
�I&#8217;m ready, Priya.�
Priya&#8217;s frown suddenly faded into a blissful smile. �You saw our slave 72? Had a good look at him?�
�Yes, Priya.�
�And how do you feel now?�
�Really scared, Priya.� Sanjeev confessed, turning to her feet. �He is much bigger and stronger than I would expect your slave to be.�
�I need the best, strongest and quickest men at my feet all day.� Priya said. �How dare you expect any less?�
�I didn&#8217;t mean it that way, Priya.� Sanjeev said, staring at the slave&#8217;s structure from top to bottom. �It&#8217;s just that slaves are supposed to be lowly, desperate souls with no other option. This guy doesn&#8217;t look the type at all.�
�My slaves are amazing men who can&#8217;t have me.� Priya stated. �And I only pick the most amazing among them.�
�True, Priya.�
�Do you think you&#8217;re better than him in any way?� Priya asked.
Sanjeev considered for a few moments, looking at the Adonis before him. �Physically, there&#8217;s no contest.�
�Then go home.� Priya said. �I want a strong slave, just like him and you just aren&#8217;t what I&#8217;m looking for.�
�Please, Priya. Is there no other factor on which I might beat him?�
�My slaves would clean my house, move heavy objects, take nasty whipping sessions from me and Rahul whenever we feel like it.� Priya said. �So yes, I&#8217;m not looking for a medical genius slave, or a mathematician slave. I want a strong slave.�
�In that case,� Sanjeev knelt before his dream couple, �I will take him on.�
�Now you sound like someone we could use,� Priya giggled with Rahul. �I want to hear you challenge him directly.� Sanjeev turned towards the large man and gulped. �Go on.�
�I think I can beat you,� Sanjeev said, his tear ducts separating in an instant.
Priya and Rahul bowled over with laughter, as did slave72. �You think you can beat him? Think?�
�I can beat you.� Sanjeev said. �And I will.� He said the last sentence with such force, that they all stopped laughing.
�No you can&#8217;t.� slave72 said. Priya and Rahul watched them, with eyes lit up.
�I am going to beat you and there&#8217;s nothing you can do about it.� Sanjeev said.
�You better take that back and go home. Before I beat the life out of you.�
�It&#8217;s your life that&#8217;s going to get beaten out of you.� Sanjeev said.
�Alright, that&#8217;s enough from both of you.� Priya said. �You&#8217;re both going to fight to the death. The last man standing will get to work as our slave. The loser will, of course, be dead.�
�I accept.� slave72 said.
�I accept.� Sanjeev said.
