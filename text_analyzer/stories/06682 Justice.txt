Synopsis: a young girl is killed by a drink driver, the court sets sentence, but Stuart provides Justice






Stuart sat at the back of the court listening to the judge&#8217;s decision. The defendant was given a large fine, banned from driving, and a hundred hours community service. Stuart shook his head in disgust.

Lily had been seven years old when this bitch had hit her on the street where Stuart lived. Another victim of drink driving, just one more statistic. And the judge had released her back into the world, instead of locking her up.

There was no justice, or so it seemed.

Stuart had heard the screeching of the tyres, heard the thud as the car ploughed into Lily, and had cradled the dying girl in his arms until the ambulance arrived. And this bitch was getting a slap on the wrist. The was certainly no justice, but Stuart had already decided to even things up. He may not be able to bring little Lily back, but he could do something about the bitch that had taken her young life.

For the next three weeks Stuart followed the girl wherever she went. Picking up her patterns, watching as she caught buses instead of driving. He had sat for hours in bars, watching her, but without being seen. And his plan was finally taking shape.

The bitch would remember Lily for the rest of her days.


Sally breathed a sigh of relief as the judge passed sentence. She accepted the fine and the community service with grace, but the ban? Without the car her social life would be ruined. Surely the fine and community service were enough?

Well, okay, the little girl had died, but she shouldn&#8217;t have been playing in the street anyway, it was her own damned fault. And it wasn&#8217;t as if Sally had ran off or anything. She had stayed and accepted her punishment. But to be banned from driving?

She asked her solicitor if there was any chance of an appeal against the ban, but he had simply shook his head, and told her to think herself lucky she didn&#8217;t get a custodial sentence.

Sally shook her head in disbelief. Friday night was party night, but without the car it was going to be a nightmare. Buses and taxis everywhere. And what of her mates? They relied on her for transport. She did consider ignoring the ban, but her solicitor had warned her that if she were caught driving while banned, she would get a prison sentence. 

At least she had taken the precaution not to drive to the court, so she wasn&#8217;t going to get arrested leaving there. 


Stuart considered Friday night to be the best for his plan, preferably a rainy night. 

It was the third Friday that his wish was granted. The bitch was wearing a short dress, high heels, and a thin coat. By the time she got a taxi from the rank, she would be almost drowned. Placing the �Taxi� sign on top of his car, he drove slowly past her, hoping that she would flag him down, even though private hire cars were not supposed to stop.

As he began to drive past her Stuart thought she was going to ignore him, but at the last second, her arms went up and she called for him to stop.

As she leant into the car, Stuart could smell the alcohol on her breath, a disgusting smell, but he smiled at the girl and asked if she needed a ride. The girl willingly accepted, climbing into the back seat, flashing her underwear as she did so.

The address she gave was garbled, but Stuart knew where she lived, not that she was going home. Stuart had other plans for the bitch.

Within minutes of getting into the car Sally was slumped over. Her eyes closing. Once more. She had drunk far too much, but that was going to help Stuart. He drove to an old wooded area, bringing the car to a slow stop, so as not to waken his passenger, and then took the syringe from the glove box, turning in his seat to face her.

She made no move, her eyes still closed, hear breathing steady. He doubted she even felt the needle enter her arm, as Stuart pumped the drug into her. 

�Now you are mine, bitch� Stuart spat the words out. As he restarted the car and drove towards his destination.

It was over an hours drive, but the girl would not wake up for some time yet. Even if the alcohol wore off, the drug wouldn&#8217;t. 

They were heading for an old abandoned hut Stuart had found one day when on a fishing trip. He had slept there overnight when the weather had turned bad on him, and knew it to be dry, even if it was more than a little dirty. There were no recent tracks heading towards the hut as Stuart pulled up and stopped the car. The chances of them being disturbed were minimal.

Opening the back door of the car Stuart man handled the girl out, and threw her over his shoulder, carrying her the last few feet to the hut. Unceremoniously he dumped her onto the ground, and went back out to park the car out of view of anyone who drove past on the top road.

Satisfied it could not be seen, Stuart returned to the hut, and Sally.

She was still lying where he had dropped her, her dress riding up her legs, flashing her underwear. Frilly black knickers, but no tights. Not that the dress of any other item of her clothing was going to last long. Taking a knife from his pocket, Stuart began to cut through her dress, tearing the shreds from her body, before cutting away her bra and knickers. Naked, the girl lay at his feet, and at his mercy.

He still had a few hours before she awoke, but seeing her naked and sprawled on the floor made him feel horny. She may never know what happened next, but Stuart dropped his trousers to the floor and knelt between her open thighs. His cock was already hard, and it took only a few seconds to get the head of it inside her pussy. 

There was no finesse, Stuart wanted her, and took her hard, his cock disappearing deep inside the girl&#8217;s pussy. It took only a few minutes, but Stuart was content, as he felt his cock jerk inside her, and his juices flooded her pussy. 

She may not know about that one, but Sally would know about it in future. She had taken little Lily&#8217;s life, and so, to Stuart, her life was forfeit, which meant he could do what he wanted to do, and he fully intended to do so.

Grabbing the naked girl, Stuart carried her to a high backed wooden chair placed in the centre of the hut, and dropped her into it. Opening the bag he had left there the day before, he started to pull out a selection of ropes. The first rope went under her tits and around the back of the chair holding her upright. A second rope went around her stomach, and also around the back of the chair, holding her still. Placing her hands on the arm rests, he secured them ah the wrists, and elbows, and then using another piece of rope, used it to pull her elbows closer together around the back of the chair, and preventing her twisting her arms to attempt to escape.

Lastly he tied her legs to the legs of the chair, at the ankles and just below each knee, her legs held open, displaying her pussy.

Checking his watch he knew she would awaken soon, and didn&#8217;t want her screaming out. Using remnants from her own torn clothing, Stuart began to stuff pieces into her mouth, filling it as much as he could. Then using a long piece tied around her head to hold it all in place. There would be no discernible sound from her now.

Standing back to admire his handiwork, Stuart was happy that she could not get free, and could not bring attention to herself. Only now was he satisfied that he could leave her alone and return home. She would still be there in the morning.


Sally&#8217;s head hurt, but no worse than any other Saturday morning after she had been out on Friday morning. Opening her eyes, something was wrong. It wasn&#8217;t Saturday, it was s till dark. She tried to stand up, but could hardly move. Her mouth felt dry, and aching, she tried to speak, but again, something was wrong.

Sally began to panic just then the moon shone through one of the dirty cracked windows of the hut, and Sally saw the ropes for the first time. again she tried to scream, but her mouth felt full, her tongue trapped under something dry and material like. She struggled in her chair to get free, but her arms refuse to move, her legs, also.

She tried to think back to what had happened after she left the club. It was raining, she remembered that. She had no umbrella, and was getting soaked to the skin, her clothes sticking to her. then the taxi. That was it, the taxi stopped and she remembered getting into it, not try as she may, she couldn&#8217;t remember getting out of it. But where was she now, and why was she tied up?

Time and time again, Sally tried to struggle free of her bonds, but they were unyielding, simply doing their job, and holding her in place. She was going to kill whoever did this to her. she tried to think who it could be. Jane? No!, Jane may be crazy, but she wasn&#8217;t stupid, and only a stupid person would think that when the party was over, Sally wouldn&#8217;t absolutely kill them.

Mark? It was the sort of trick he would play. But, Mark was away on holiday in Greece. So not Mark either.

She ran through her friends in her mind, but couldn&#8217;t think of a single one who would be stupid enough to do this to her. so if not one of her friends, if not a joke, who? And why?

It suddenly dawned on her that she was sure she had seen the taxi driver before, but couldn&#8217;t for the life of her think where. But the more she thought about it, the more she was sure she had seen him. Perhaps he was behind this. Had she forgotten to pay the fare or something?

The sound of a car engine broke into her thoughts, and again she attempted to scream out for help, but the muffled sound barely travelled past her lips, let alone to anyone outside the hut.

Footsteps heading her way. Now she would see who was behind this, and they had better watch out. Sally in a bad mood was not something they wanted to experience.


Sally stared at the door, watching as it slowly opened, to reveal&nbsp; a man in his forties, dark hair, clean shaven, and carrying two large leather&nbsp; bags. Closing the ddoor he put the bags on the floor, and leaned with his back on the door.

�So, bitch, you&#8217;re awake. Welcome. I know you want to find out why you are here, and what is happening, but rest your mind. I intend to fill in all the blanks for you. Your presence here is no accident, and I am the architect of your fate.�

Stuart could see the wild look in her eyes.

�I know bitch, you want to get up from the chair, and attack me. But that isn&#8217;t going to happen. In fact, you will never leave that chair again. By the way, while you ere unconscious, I fucked you. Shot my load deep into your guts. Shame you weren&#8217;t a virgin really. I have had better shags, but, what the hell, ity was the last one you will ever have.�

He walked closer, carrying the two bags with him, and placing them on the ground either side of the chair.

�Have you ever given blood, bitch?� he asked.

Sally looked quizzically at him.

�You know what I mean? Have you ever been a blood donor?�

Sally shook her head, the hate filled eyes following the man&#8217;s every move.

�Well, you are going to do so now. in fact, you are going to donate all of your blood. That&#8217;s twelve pints of blood, more or less.�

Stuart began pulling things from the bags, starting with four large needles, and a selection of tubes. Placing these on the ground he pulled four collapsible stands from the other bag, and began assembling them, placing two to each side of her.

�I want to tell you a&nbsp; story� said Stuart, as he continued to work.

�A little girl is playing in the street one day, when a car careers towards her, hitting her, and causing massive internal bleeding. The driver has been drinking, and stalls the car when she hits the little girl. Instead of getting out of the car to see what she had done, the driver began cursing the car for having stalled. A man, who had seen the accident, cuddles the little girl, waiting for an ambulance, as her life slowly ebbed away. Over a year later, the driver is finally taken to court, and is given a fine, a driving ban, and community service from a pathetic judge. Instead of the life imprisonment that the bitch of a driver deserved.�

Stuart looked Sally straight in the eyes.

�Does this all sound a little familiar bitch? I was the man who watched that innocent girl&#8217;s life ebb away in my arms. Seven years old, and suddenly gone for ever. While you carry on your partying, still getting drunk and driving. Then getting less that a slapped wrist off the courts. Well, bitch, the courts may have tried you, but I am going to give you justice. Her life ebbed away in My arms, yours will ebb away because of My arms.�

With this Stuart picked up the first of the four long needles, with the ropes on her wrists and elbows, it was no hardship to locate one of her veins, forcing the needle into it, then placing a small amount of tape to hold it in place. Moments later, and her other arm was dealt with the same way.

The last two needles found their way into veins on the inside of each thigh, and again, were held in place by tape. Satisfied, Stuart began to connect the needles to tubes, leading to a collection of clear plastic bags, much the same as were used at blood donor centres.

�Now bitch. When I turn on the valve, each needle will slowly begin to take blood from you, filling these plastic bags slowly. You will even be able to see them filling, knowing that as they do so, they are slowly taking your life from you. I want you to think back bitch, to the day your stupidity forced a young girl&#8217;s life to slowly drain away, and feel yourself getting slowly weaker, as your own life follows suit.�

Stuart stood up and headed for the door of the hut.

�I would like to stay and chat with you for a while, but I have more important things to do, and besides, one way conversations were never my style. Oh yes, by the way, the plastic bags are all interconnected. As one bag reaches capacity, the next one begins to fill, so please, don&#8217;t build your hopes up too highly that it will stop after four pints have been drained. You will probably lose consciousness after around six pints, perhaps a little more, but don&#8217;t worry, the operation will continue to run until the end.�

With that Stuart left the hut and closed the door, adding a padlock to ensure it stayed closed. He would return in a few days to dispose of the body, but he had another court case to watch on Monday. He hoped that, for once, justice would actually be meted out by the courts, and not by people like him.
