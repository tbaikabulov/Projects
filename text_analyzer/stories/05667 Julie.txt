JULIE�� 

Julie
was a submissive. 

Julie had always been a submissive, but if you ever asked when it
started, she would not be able to tell you.�
I remember her once telling me that the first time she was ever tied up,
was in a college play, when she played Joan of�
Arc, and was tied to the stake. She told me that she had a strange
feeling about it, but had no idea what it meant.� Her next role was as a roman slave girl, and
yes, she was tied up again. In fact, in most of her roles she was
tied up in some way or other. A gangster's moll, a kidnap victim, anything that
required a girl to be tied, Julie was the first to volunteer.� But there was nothing sexual in this, it was just something she seemed to enjoy. A lot!� The first time she was tied up in sexual activity
came one night when she and her boyfriend of the time had been out for a meal,
and had drank a bottle of wine. That she had drank more than he had was incidental. Or so she tells
me.� Apparently, they had been fooling
around when they got home, and he had told her he was going to teach her a
lesson, as she was teasing him at the time. 

Grabbing
some old school ties, he fastened them around her wrists, as Julie howled in
laughter. Even when he fastened the ties to the bed, so she could not use her hands
to defend herself, she still could not control her laughter.� True, when they started to fuck, and she
still could not use her hands to hold him, the laughter stopped. But it was
replaced by the biggest orgasm he had ever given her, but both of them put it
down to the brilliant night they had
just had, not to tying her up.� A few
weeks later they split up, and he had never repeated the tying up. Neither had
he brought about the same intensity of orgasm after that night.� The next time Julie was tied, was at her own
direction. She was with a man, a married man, and one night when he came over
she suggested that he tie her hands up, as she had done it once before, and
enjoyed it.� The man obliged, using some
washing line that Julie supplied. Tying her hands behind her, and then lowering
her to the bed, before making love, seemed a strange thing to do, to him, but
he did it. The act of love lasted
longer for him, as he was able to control himself, without Julie pulling at
him, but for her, it was magnificent. She started to cum in minutes, and just
couldn't
stop. Orgasm after orgasm flooded the bed beneath her, until, at last, her man
friend finally exhausted himself, and finished.

Over
the next few weeks they re-enacted the scene, but it was always at Julie's
insistence. She just wished that once,. just once, he would come over, say nothing, and tie her up.
But he never did. True, he did once come over and &quot;ASK&quot; if she wanted
tying up. But she didn't want to be asked, she knew she wanted to be
taken.� Eventually, the man told her that
he wanted to make a go of it with his wife, and that he was going to have to
stop seeing her. At first she was upset, and really did cry. But it didn't take
long to get used to the fact that he meant it, and just never came back.� This now left Julie in a quandary. She had
found something that she really liked, and wanted, but she had no-one to give
it to her. You could hardly go up to a man in a bar and ask
him to take you home, tie you up, and have sex. The taking home and having sex
was not the problem, but she wanted tying up, she wanted sex to be
&quot;GIVEN&quot; to her, not shared &quot;WITH&quot; her.� One day she was surfing the net when she
found a site that amazed her. It was a chat room, and whilst she did not join
in, she watched the things appearing on her screen, and started to feel very
damp. There, in front of her, were others talking about bondage, and how they
would have sex with someone whilst they were tied up and defenseless.



� She had never dreamed that this really
happened outside her own ideas, and to find that others were of the same mind,
surprised the hell out of her.� For over
a week she logged in to the chat room, and never typed a single word. Just watched. Every time she visited, there was someone
talking about bondage. She watched a two way conversation between a man and a
woman, where the man was telling the woman what he was going to do with her,
and to her. To Julie's surprise, the woman seemed to be egging the man on, and
again, Julie felt that strange warmth she had felt every time she had been tied
up, all the way back to Joan of Arc.�
Suddenly it dawned on her that it was exactly what she wanted for
herself. For someone to TELL her what they would do, and then do it without her
being able to resist. The next night she
logged on, and typed a message. She sat for ages looking at what she had
written, not pressing the enter key. What would happen if she sent the� message?

�All she had to do,
was press that key, and it would appear on screen, and on the screen of everyone
logged on. Then everyone would know. What if it was
someone she 'KNEW'?� For what seemed a
lifetime, the message sat in front of her, the cursor blinking at the end of
the line, as if begging her to send it. She closed her eyes. It still wasn't
too late! All she had to do was delete the line, and it would not be sent. But
she knew that she HAD to send it. It was fate that he'd brought her here, and
she knew what she had to do. With eyes closed, her finger found the key, and
pressed.

Seconds
later, it was there on the screen in front of her.� &quot;25 year old woman wants tying up.
Please help!&quot;� Perhaps the others in
the chat room had not seen it! Maybe it only showed up on her own screen, and
it would never be seen!.� She watched, horrified at herself,
but knowing she had no choice. For over a minute there was no activity on
screen, as if her message had stopped
the world.� Then something happened. A message,obviously for her. just three words, and she could ignore them, couldn't she.
NO, she could not. She knew in her heart the message was for her. Just three words. &quot;Can I Help?&quot;� 

This
was the moment. Decider time. The final kick in a superball game, that decided who won the big game.
If she answered, who would be the winner? If she didn't, would she be the loser.
But as if she had no control over her hands, the answer appeared on her's, and everyone else's screens.&quot;Yes
please&quot;� 

Did
she write that? How could she?�� Then another message. &quot;Tell me about
yourself&quot;.� 

About
herself.? What was there to say? 

That
she liked to get tied up before having sex? That she wanted someone to take
control, and Make her enjoy it. That she wanted to be raped? All of these were
true, but was that what he really meant?�
As she didn't answer for a minute or two, another message flashed onto
her screen.� &quot;I ASKED YOU A
QUESTION!&quot;� 

This
really looked as if the sender was shouting at her, and she immediately began
to type her life story into the computer, not knowing why, but knowing she
must.� For over three weeks the exchanges
took place between her, and her internet Master, Yes, she had started to call
him Master, at his insistence. But she somehow felt at ease with this, as if it
were natural.� Then came
the message she had been both wanting to see, and dreading. The Master would be
in the same city the next week, and would want to see her. He gave her a list
of things to but, and wear, and told her when and where to met him, but not to
be one second late, or he would leave, and she would never hear from him again.

&nbsp;

Her
heart missed several beats. She couldn't lose him, now. Even though she had not
met him, she wanted him, and only him. She sent an answer saying that she would
appear,on time. To which he
re-iterated what she was to wear, and nothing else.� The next few days were shopping days, as she
had none of
the stuff he had told her to wear.� Nylons, not tights. Short black skirt.
Tight fitting black top. Red velvet
neck collar. Black high heels, and to bring with her
two pairs of handcuffs. This last item worried her most, but she dare
not refuse. What would she do if the first thing he asked for, she had not got.
It didn't bear thinking about.� For two
days she sat at home, watching the computer, waiting for Him to say something.
But nothing came. Since telling her he was coming, Nothing! She sat looking at
the handcuffs, the cold metal somehow both threatening, and comforting. She
wanted to feel them on. But dared not. It was His job
to do that to her.� It had never dawned
on her that all she had to do was say.No, and he would
not come, and she could go back to her normal life. But what was normal?


HE was normal, to her. Her world was changing, and all that she had dreamed of
was about to come true. But had she the courage to let it. It was still not too
late. It wouldn't be, until she let him use these handcuffs. She toyed with
then again and again, but they still had the air of both threat and something
else. LOVE!.�
The days passed.Slowly.
Why did she have to wait so long? Was he married? What did he look like? Why is� he not here now,
when I need him.� It had occurred to her
on many occasions that she had already given herself up to this man, and had
never even seen him. But she felt that it was right. Felt at ease with it,
though with some trepidation. She just
put that down to the unknown factor. But she knew it was more. Every time she
thought of him,


she made her panties wet, and he hadn't even touched
her yet.� It was Friday. This was the
day. Julie was up early, wanting to be ready in plenty of time.� he showered, and ate
breakfast. Showered, and dressed. Showered again, as if all
this would bring the time to three pm quicker. But her watch must have
stopped, or slowed down. Why was it not time yet? Was it really only eleven.
God! four hours to go

Julie
checked her appearance again. The skirt showed almost all of her legs, and the
high heels seemed to make them even longer. The black top was really tight,
showing off her tits underneath it. She had no bra on, as he had said not to
wear anything other than what he had told her to wear. She just hoped there
would not be a strong breeze before she reached the meeting place, as he had
not mentioned knickers to her either.�
Slowly, the clock�
oved
forwards. Three hours to go. She could still change her mind. It was not too late.
But Julie knew she would not, could not change her mind. She needed to KNOW. 

&nbsp;

Was this
what she really wanted.? If she didn't go, she would
never know for sure.� Two hours, and her
stomach had hundreds of butterflies beating a tattoo inside her. Again and
again she checked her appearance, not wanting anything to be wrong. She held
the back of the skirt against her legs, sure that people would see that she had
no knickers on. But was this part of the test? Did she have to show him that
whatever he said, would be obeyed. Or had he simply
forgotten to mention them. Such a dilemma!�
One hour. Should she go, or should she leave a message to tell him that
something had come up, and would like to postpone the meeting. But she knew
that there would be no postponement. If she was late, or didn't arrive at all,
that would be the last she heard from him. She had to go. 

&nbsp;

�The walk to the meeting place was a bare ten
minutes, but Julie left home early, trying to make
sure that she was not late. It was a sunny day, and would have looked silly if
she had worn a coat to cover up the short skirt. But the Master had not
mentioned a coat anyway, so he obviously wanted her to
walk through the streets like this. She just knew that everyone was looking at
her. Did they know she had no drawers on? 

&nbsp;

Mr Dickson had never smiled like that
before. His eyes had never left her chest, watching it bounce without the bra
that normally supported her breast� Suddenly, she was there. She was
early, but rather that than late, and find Him gone.� She moved to the third bungalow, and knocked
on the door. There
was no answer, but the door was already standing slightly open, so Julie pushed
it wider, and with one last sigh, entered...................................
......



&nbsp;

As she entered the room, Julie held her
breath, not knowing what to expect.� She
stood, halfway through the door, thinking of what she was doing, but knowing
she had no choice. Seconds later, and one step, and she was� through the door.� 

&nbsp;

A soft voice from somewhere to her left,
told her to close the door, and not
look around.� The voice startled her, but
she amazed herself by obeying, wanting more than anything to look, to see what
he was like.�� The voice told Julie to
walk into the centre of the room, and undress, facing the far wall. Panic
suddenly set in, and Julie could not move, frozen to the spot, knowing that if
she obeyed, it would be out of her control.��
The voice came again, almost a whisper, but she knew it was an order 

&nbsp;

&quot; UNDRESS&quot;� 

&nbsp;

Immediately Julie's hands moved the her thin top, and without another thought, pulled it
upwards and over her head, baring her breasts for the still unseen Master. The
skirt followed, leaving her naked in this strange place, unable to run, yet not
wanting to do.� &quot;Sit on the
chair&quot; said the voice.�� Julie had
seen the chair, a wooden one with arm rests, and moved towards it, not daring
to turn around. Still with her back to the voice, she sat in the chair,
wondering just what was going to happen now. Did the man like what he could see?
Was she too much overweight? Did her breasts sag too much for Him?� Julie heard a movement behind her, and
something dark covered her�
yes blocking her vision, It took a second to realise that the man
was� lindfolding
her. She wanted to move, to leave, but she could not, not now!� 

&nbsp;

Once the blindfold was in place, the man
gently took her left wrist, and she felt something like a rope pass around it,
Seconds later, her wrist was secured to the arm rest of the chair. Again she
panicked. What was he doing to her? What would he DO to her.� She wanted to scream out to him to stop, but
as the man took her right wrist, and secured this also, she said nothing. As he moved to her ankles. Julie meekly let him secure them
to the chair legs, holding her in place, unwilling and not wanting anything
different.� She could hear him walking
around her, and guessed that he was looking her over, His prisoner. She wanted
to please Him, wanted Him to be happy with what he could see. Afraid He would
be displeased with her.
�
A hand suddenly touched her bare breast, gently brushing against the nipple.
Julie squirmed in the chair, but with an unexpected pleasure. She had had hands
on her breasts before, but they did not feel like this. They did not seem to
raise the fire within her that was already growing.� The hand moved to her other breast, and the
fire became a blaze, the wrmth filling her whole
body, yet the man had done nothing yet!�
His voice, a soft whisper, told her that he would always want her
breasts to be available to him, so she was not to wear a bra ever again. 

&nbsp;

Even then, Julie knew that if he had
asked her to stand naked in the middle of the road, she would have done so. But
she said nothing, just nodded her head
in agreement with Him.� His hands moved
across her stomach, and Julie felt as if it was all she had ever wanted, and
without warning she felt the orgasm rip through her body, the most intense she
had ever had, and still he had done nothing but touch her.� The dampness between her legs felt like e
river,
though she knew that this was not possible, the heat in her pussy forcing her
to kove in the seat, as His hand moved lower, to meet
her thinly haired groin.� Julie raised
her hips to meet His finger, but he pulled back, and away from her. She just
knew that He was laughing at her, toying with bith
her body and her emotions, not allowing her the pleasure she suddenly craved
for, more than ever.� She felt Him move
away, and then back again. He told her to open her mouth, and as she did so,
she felt something round being pressed into her mouth, a gag. He quickly
fastened straps behind her head, and the gag was in place. She tried to say
something, but nothing but a mild groan came out, and she knew that this was
what He wanted from her.� Her mind
flipped. Was
this really what she had always wanted, ever since she had played Joan of Arc
all those years ago. He was now free to do what He
wanted, and the most that Julie could do, was moan through the gag.� Again she felt His hands touching her
breasts, fingers toying with her nipples, gently squeezing at� them. Feeling them harden achingly
under His touch.� Julie felt herself
pushing her chest out to reach His fingers, but he moved with her, so that his
fingers still gently touched and brushed the area she so wanted
him to use.� Her whole body ached with
wanting, needing, this stranger to take her. To make
her His, and control her.� Again his
hands moved to
between her legs, brushing at the damp lips to her womanhood. With no control,
Julie found herself raising her hips, trying to meet the hand of her Master,
but still he tormented her with gentleness, allowing
Himself to just touch her so gently, feeling the dampness grow again, as Julie
lost control of herself.






Julie did not need to be told that this
man was her Master.It was natural that he should be
in control, her aim to please Him more than anything in the world.� His fingers moved to find her clitoris, and
gently squeezed it, sending another orgasm tearing through the bound slave,
more intense than any other. Julie cried out as the hot feeling swam through
her like molten lava, but the gag reduced her scream to a gentle moan. He knew,
though. He knew exactly how she was feeling, what he was doing to her. The emotions running
through her as she came again, unable to control what was happening, or how she
was feeling. He knew she did not want to leave, did not want this to
stop,,,,ever.� His lips closed on hers, and Julie thrust her
tongue out to push into His mouth, as she felt His hand press harder at her
groin, a finger pressing against her womanhood, forcing its way inside her. She
found His tongue, and sucked at it eagerly.It was the
first real touch she had been allowed.�
His fingers pressed deeper into her, filling her with a wanton feeling
like she had never experienced, all of her wishes coming true at one time,� fulfilling her needss, as the finger, His finger, began to feel like
everything she had ever wanted.� Gone,
now, were any inhibitions, and she knew that she was
His, and would be forever, the most willing, and obedient of slaves. At last
