Synopsis: An unusual path to a happy marraige.






Outwardly they were the perfect couple. Very well off but not yet rich.&nbsp; She ran her own design company and was a star in the civic social scene and he was a partner in a small and highly profitable investment firm.&nbsp; Neither was strikingly handsome or beautiful, in fact further to the other side.&nbsp; Yet well groomed and well-dressed they were an impressive pair.
Inwardly the marriage suffered.&nbsp; They had survived the fifteen years of their relationship because they had the same taste, the same desires, the very same controlling instinct that had to dominate, it had to win.&nbsp; They met in college, their first romance after high school and married after they graduated from college.&nbsp; Well connected on both sides they accepted the marriage challenge confident of dominating the other.
After knowing each other and no one else for so long they both felt that , separately and unspoken, challenge was replaced by distaste; questions displaced by accusation, sex replaced by duty and communication replaced by chatter.&nbsp; They silently realized this early and sought ways to alleviate the tension.&nbsp; Night clubs led to sex clubs led to the local bondage underground.&nbsp; Bondage suited their needs since one was always in control.&nbsp; The problem came when it was the other&#8217;s turn. The more the urge to dominate and control the other the more they feared losing control to the other.&nbsp; They were emotionally trapped in an unrelenting circle, both too arrogant to concede any emotional ground to the other.
They both knew it was not just about the bondage scene.&nbsp; It had provided many, many delightful times as one ceded control to the other as they played out their secret domination scenarios.&nbsp; Mostly it was done within a very small circle, or by themselves.&nbsp; And they were both very careful about their public image.
They were running out of diversions from the central point:&nbsp; they either had to split up or one had to cede dominance to the other.&nbsp; Friends and family had noticed this from the start.&nbsp; It was not so much a marriage as a competition.&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither would ask for a divorce, which would have marked that one as the loser, a quitter, the one who lost control.
They had accepted the dinner invitation weeks ago and were tempted to bow out.&nbsp; This was a special invitation and really unexpected.&nbsp; The owner of a local &#8216;private adult club&#8217; had an interesting guest, the head of a resort on a private island in the South Pacific they had been told about.&nbsp; It was a virtual paradise for the guests, who were allowed to pursue any curious sexual experiments they desired, as long as no harm came to any guest or staff at the resort.&nbsp; The guest this evening was renowned for resolving just the sort of personal and marital problems Donna and Clark faced.
He was fascinated by their dynamic.&nbsp; �What I see is not really love and not really hate; whatever the emotional bond between you I can find a way for both of you to have peace in your relationship.&nbsp; You would need to visit the resort and commit to my program.&nbsp; I guarantee you by the end of it all you will have resolved your mutual fixation on dominating the other. � 
�However, you must agree to my method of treatment and it is not inexpensive, paid in advance.&nbsp;&nbsp; It will involve &#8216;suspending&#8217; your marriage while you are on the island.&nbsp; You will live separately and will not be allowed to communicate with each other unless under my direct supervision.&nbsp; Most importantly if you do not agree between yourselves who was to be the dominant, you will abide by my decision in the end.�
Clark stared at him in disbelief.&nbsp; �What sort of guarantee can you possibly give us to have us agree to those terms?&nbsp; We have seen all the counselors and marriage specialist in the city.&nbsp; We tried a 6 month separation with no resolution.&nbsp; We are type A&#8217;s in what my mother describes as a death spiral.&nbsp; What can you possibly have that will guarantee success, especially if it is expensive advice to get?&nbsp; And even if we agree on the island, what makes you so sure we will not change our minds when we get back?�
�As to the first question I will put on deposit $1,000,000, yours if I have not resolved all issues to your mutual satisfaction.&nbsp; As to the remaining questions they are my details to work out and not your problem.&nbsp; The island is beautiful, the guests are interesting, the amenities are first rate and the food is wonderful.&nbsp; Look at the dissatisfaction in your relationship now; you are really blocked from each other and the beauty of a real relationship.&nbsp; You both feel the wasted emotions, not happy with or without each other.&nbsp; Imagine if that block was removed, imagine how magnificent you relationship could be.&nbsp; You are both so highly successful in business; imagine if you related to each other the same way, with the same intensity.&nbsp; I can help you achieve that.&nbsp; And really, what do you have to lose.�
A week later they were drinking cocktails from coconut shells.&nbsp; The island and accommodations were first class.&nbsp; For the first day anyway.&nbsp; Their &#8216;therapy&#8217; began first thing the next morning after a very early breakfast.
�Good morning Mr. and Ms. Cousins.&nbsp; I am glad to see you have agreed to the terms.&nbsp; Before we begin anything else, you need to get a divorce, which we are legally entitled to do with our agreement with the local government.&nbsp; It is legally binding in any American court.&nbsp; At the end of your stay you will be allowed the chance to rip it up.&nbsp; Until then you will not be married and I will have your power of attorney to act on both your behalf&#8217;s know and foregoing any conflict of interest claims.&nbsp; These are agreements made under local law.&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you understand?�
They both nodded their agreement as an assistant served them some iced tea.
�Good.&nbsp; I have guaranteed you a resolution and you have agreed to pay me my fee and have further agreed to stay remain here for four weeks, or until the three of us all agree you can leave. Now my assistants will put these collars on both of you.&nbsp; You both now own a collar.&nbsp; Actually, you each own half of a collar.�
They inspected their collars, never having expected to take orders from someone else.&nbsp; The collars were made of one piece of a light, unpolished stone with a clasp in the back.&nbsp; A sweet, earthy aroma filled their noses.&nbsp;&nbsp; Clark was the first to object.&nbsp; �I did not come here for a master sub lesson.&nbsp; I am not going to walk around with some submissive symbol on my neck.&nbsp; Who the hell do you think you are?&nbsp; What makes you so damn smart? We were nuts to come here anyway.&nbsp; You are supposed to resolve��
Before he could finish his Ralston cut him off.&nbsp; �I have a PHD&#8217;s from Yale and the Sorbonne in Developmental Psychology as well as degrees in law and business from Harvard.&nbsp; I have advanced degrees in pharmacology from John&#8217;s Hopkins and the Heidelberg University.&nbsp; I have 36 patents that have made me very wealthy.&nbsp; Now if quiz time is over can we proceed?� 
�You will notice an earthy smell.&nbsp; It is a very powerful neurotoxin.&nbsp; In short doses, maybe three or four weeks, you become addicted and, for a week after it is removed you will suffer some withdrawal; after two months it will be as difficult as giving up smoking; after three months you will have an insatiable desire for that smell.&nbsp; You will do anything to keep the collar.&nbsp; The toxin will be in your cells, a complete emotional and physical dependence.&nbsp; And the only satisfaction you will get is by following the commands of your dominant.&nbsp; Only his or her command will make you feel that pleasure.&nbsp; No junkie has ever had it as bad.�
�Breathe it in, close your eyes and feel as your skin absorbs the oils from the stone.&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you feel it� listen to my voice� you want to listen to my voice... feel that intense pleasure�that aroma gives you that feeling� only with my voice�only when I speak will you focus on the aroma�you already crave that aroma�you need that aroma�you will do what I want because that is the only thing you can do�the aroma is in your head�you are a slave to the aroma�and the aroma is a slave to my voice�you want me to command you�you need me to command you� now open your eyes and look at me slaves.�
This time it was her.&nbsp; �What sort of new wave crap is this.&nbsp; Try your voodoo on someone else.�
Ralston issued a simple command.&nbsp; �Stand.�
They both felt an irresistible urge to stand.&nbsp; �Listen to what I say slave.&nbsp; Urinate.�
Donna and Clark stared at each other, then back at Ralston.&nbsp; �What?�
�I order you to urinate, right now, in your shorts, now.&nbsp; It will give you great pleasure.�
Before they realized it both Robert and Helen were standing in a puddle of their own piss.&nbsp; And smiling.
�See, I told you my commands have force and give pleasure.&nbsp; In time one of you will do anything for the feeling you are experiencing right now, even as you stand in a puddle of your own urine.&nbsp;&nbsp; I apologize for the graphic nature of the demonstration, but I needed you to see the power of the collars.&nbsp; Each collar has enough of the oil in it to last a lifetime.&nbsp; By the end of your stay one of you will wear both collars, and will then submit to his or her master or mistress.&nbsp; Craving to take their order, for only then will your hunger feel satisfied.&nbsp; One collar alone will not guarantee subservience, two will assure it.&nbsp; That is the only way this will end.�&nbsp; 
�We did not come here to be embarrassed.�&nbsp; Helen was now fuming about the humiliation.
�Too bad slave.&nbsp; Take off your shirts and mop up the urine.�&nbsp; Their first urge to resist melted away as they followed the direction, again smiling even though they knew they should be enraged at the humiliation.&nbsp; It was the intense feeling of really potent sex, five minutes of unadulterated pleasure before their senses returned. 
�I remind you about the divorce.&nbsp; If either of you tampers with the collars you will be the slave.&nbsp; If either or both run I will have you arrested when you get to the main island for breach of contract and drug possession.&nbsp; I know you will fail a drug test and that is enough proof here to have you imprisoned.&nbsp; Remember, we have a four week contract.&nbsp; I will make the final decision as to who wears the collars unless you come to an agreement on your own. �
�I should also tell you that local law does allow for the free trading of all things of value, contracts, spouses, jobs, and possessions, anything of value.&nbsp; The law is clear that a deal is a deal, so do not get caught trying to back out, it can lead to prison.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you decide you don&#8217;t wish to remarry, you can, of course, trade your contract with anyone else on the island, you are both single, there is no need for the other to know or agree.&nbsp; My job is to resolve you dominance issues but even I cannot change a deal two people enter legally. �
Both Clark and Donna got up.&nbsp; �We are so out of here.�
�And go where?&nbsp; How?&nbsp; Your passports are in my safe.&nbsp; I control the only two ways off the island. Last week you asked how I could guarantee your behavior once you left here.&nbsp; Now you know how.&nbsp; One of you will have exactly what you always wanted, a complete and lasting victory.&nbsp; The other, enslaved to their master&#8217;s voice and the neurotoxin.&nbsp; One of you will live their life in humble servitude, ever regretting this moment, the moment you got your collar.&nbsp; Even now you feel the power of the toxin sapping your will, you want to leave but here you sit.&nbsp; It is more than problems of transportation and passports and police.&nbsp; You are in the first stage of a lifetime addiction, and it feels good.�
�Your behavior will be closely watched.&nbsp; Violating rules, poor job performance, any form of insolence; all these things will count in my decision.&nbsp; I suggest you both be on your best behavior.�
 �You will go to your separate dormitories and start your chores as servants.&nbsp; I know you will do as I direct and that when you are gone you will regret taking my orders.&nbsp; That is because you have only one collar.&nbsp; If you do not obey my orders you will certainly get the second collar.&nbsp; But change your clothes first.&nbsp; Do you understand?�
Incredibly, with the words struggling to escape their throats, they both looked at each other and meekly responded �Yes.�
Once out of Ralston&#8217;s eerie control both Clark and Donna separately tried to figure out what was going on.&nbsp; This was not a South Seas vacation; it was some control freak drugging them.&nbsp; Each figured it best to see what developed, afraid to so quickly lose to the other.&nbsp; Or were they both losing to Ralston.
As the first week progressed Ralston would stop by after the meager breakfast and give each of them their commands for the day.&nbsp; Each day he would have them perform some task for him and they could feel the pleasure growing each day.&nbsp; They were becoming disgusted with themselves for it but they waited each morning for him to come by and humiliate them somehow. And each day the job seemed to be more tedious. The jobs became more demeaning.&nbsp; The staff kept making notes about all of their reactions.&nbsp; They were facing a lifetime of orders if Ralston said they would be the one with the collar.&nbsp; And that thought drove them near mad with panic.&nbsp; �Why did I ever agree to this?�
By the second week Donna and Clark were sure they had made fatal errors in offending Ralston.&nbsp; They could see him shaking his head as he would walk away.&nbsp; When they tried to catch up and talk to him the staff would order them back to work.&nbsp; Each had been paired with a partner for the chores.&nbsp; Clark had been paired with another American named Martin.&nbsp; Donna was with a 20 year old woman from a nearby island country.
Martin pretty much had to show Clark how to do everything.&nbsp; Martin came from Indiana and worked as a stock clerk at Wal-Mart.&nbsp; He was a very quiet man, just a year older than Clark, who had never been more than 20 miles from home before.&nbsp; It took a week of prying before Clark was able to get Martin to open up.
�Why are you here Martin?&nbsp; How did you end up on this miserable island with a control freak like Ralston?�
�This is the nicest place I have ever been, even if I have to clean toilets.&nbsp; Ralston has guaranteed me a way to deal with my desire to be controlled.&nbsp; He is showing me forms of self-bondage I can use in public.&nbsp; He is showing me how to be contolled at all times.&nbsp; I have a ten year contract.&nbsp; Every year he will give me something new to do to myself.�
�I don&#8217;t get it, what is he showing you now?&nbsp; How to clean up after others?�
�Today I have these ugly socks on.&nbsp; He has showed me that self-bondage can take all sorts of forms.&nbsp; I hate these socks but there is a plastic strip on the top, if I take them off he will know and punish me.�
�That&#8217;s it Martin.&nbsp; All you have to do is wear the wrong socks?&nbsp; Why don&#8217;t you just marry a control freak.&nbsp; She can make your life much worse than that.&nbsp; I got myself stuck in this collar and if I don&#8217;t figure a way out I might end up taking orders for the rest of my damn life.&nbsp; Why don&#8217;t we switch.&nbsp; My ex-wife would love to give you orders for the next ten years.�
�I don&#8217;t know her,&nbsp; I.. I.. have a problem talking to women.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t even really look them in the eye.�
�Is that what it&#8217;s all about, you&#8217;re afraid of women?&nbsp; Martin that will not be a problem, Donna loves fixing other people&#8217;s problems.&nbsp; She will give you more orders than you have ever seen.&nbsp; I have seen her Idea of bondage; she will be perfect for you.&nbsp; It will be much better than socks.�
Clark was running out of time and was convinced he was going to end up with the collars.&nbsp; He was determined not to let that happen.&nbsp; Martin and his little hang-up was his best option.&nbsp; And two days before the decision, Martin gave in.
Ralston was very careful when the two approached him with their plan to switch contracts.&nbsp; Martin was unsure but Clark was desperate.&nbsp; Ralston almost had Martin talked out of it, but he had no authority to turn down the deal.&nbsp; Clark&#8217;s collar was removed and Martin was led into another room to begin his induction.
�Well Ralston, I guess that is that.&nbsp; I know all about self-bondage, this should be easy enough.&nbsp; When can I leave?&nbsp; Or are you disappointed that you will not be able to enslave me to her?�
�Clark, please sit here and enter your email for me, and a phone number.&nbsp; I will need to be able to contact you.�
As Clark hit the enter key a camera flashed and the computer started running a flood of pictures past the screen.&nbsp; All of them children in sexual positions, all foul and disgusting perversions Clark had ever imagined.&nbsp; �What the hell is this?�
�Those are the files just used to convict 10 people in US Federal District Court of producing child pornography.&nbsp; I have added some files not used in the trial but they make you look just as guilty.&nbsp; The smallest sentence was 10 years in prison.&nbsp;&nbsp; You just emailed them to me and a dozen other people who are known pornographers asking if we want to buy more.&nbsp; All I have to do is forward them to the prosecutors and you will probably go to prison.�
Clark was enraged.&nbsp; �You think you can blackmail me with a cheap computer trick.&nbsp; There is no way you can get a conviction on weak shit like this.&nbsp; Not even a good try.�
�Included in all those photos are passwords and a secret account with over $100,000 in it.&nbsp; All&nbsp; yours.&nbsp; If you touch it, it will surely lead to a conviction.&nbsp; If you don&#8217;t, the IRS will start an investigation and the porn will come out.&nbsp; You will spend even more time in prison.&nbsp; If you do not do exactly what I demand, I will send all this out.&nbsp; Martin had a ten year deal.&nbsp; You now have that deal.&nbsp; If, in nine years and eleven months you disobey my instructions I will send this out, there is no statute of limitations on this.&nbsp; I will send you to prison.�
�One more thing Clark.&nbsp; Martin was not truly about self-bondage, a term he used in his own way.&nbsp; He was more about humiliation, things he could not get in trouble for but could not escape once he started his little scene.&nbsp; The things he tried he would always back out, even for something simple, like socks.&nbsp; He wanted me to show him legal but belittling bondage he would have to go inescapably public in.&nbsp; That is what Martin wanted and that is what you will get.&nbsp; Funny thing is that he got a woman who wants to order him around.&nbsp; He was wrong about what he wanted.&nbsp; He will be much happier wearing your collars.&nbsp; Please gather your belongings; you start work at your new job on Monday morning.�
�What new job, I have our private investment firm.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t need a new job.�
�Before you leave here you will resign your position and sell all of your shares, you just need to sign the documents.&nbsp; You will now be a greeter and stock boy at Wal-Mart.&nbsp; You will show up on time every day and you better not miss more than three days without a doctor&#8217;s note.&nbsp; Or you can always choose prison.&nbsp; All of your assets are tied up in the divorce proceedings and you need your ex-wife&#8217;s signature to get to them.�
�I never agreed to any of this, I am not about to take a job in Wal-Mart.�
�Shall I send the files?&nbsp; Maybe you can beat the rap, but you will spend all of your money proving they are not yours, not to mention even if you manage to solve the legal end, your reputation will be gone.&nbsp; Your mutual assets are tied up in your divorce litigation and if you try to tap your little reserve down in the Caymans the IRS will find out and they will get the photos.&nbsp; You can build a new nest egg from scratch or you will live in a 7&#8217; by 9&#8217; cell with a cellmate assigned by the feds.&nbsp; Your choice.�
�OK, play your games.&nbsp; Give me my socks.&nbsp; And I need to talk to Donna.&nbsp; Now.�
�Very forceful Clark, but she is not on the island.&nbsp; Donna has moved on.&nbsp; She decided to switch contracts with her partner and will now be living on her own island helping the residents in their lives.&nbsp; No phones there, no internet, no nothing.&nbsp; The irony here is that you both thought you would be collared so you both bailed out.&nbsp; Now you must live with the consequences of your decisions.&nbsp; You have a small studio apartment, and a bus pass for transportation, it is all you can afford on your salary.&nbsp; Goodbye now, I will be in touch.�
Donna had made quick friends with Elena.&nbsp; Elena had come to Ralston at the request of her island&#8217;s elders.&nbsp; It was the tradition in the tiny nation of small and scattered islands that the &#8216;island mother&#8217; would instruct all newlyweds in all matters sexual and social.&nbsp; It was the island mother alone who could make the marriage potion from the lsu tree.&nbsp; It was a powerful aphrodisiac that couples drank just before they consummated their marriage. 
She had been afraid, like Clark, that she would be forced into submission by the collars.&nbsp; Ralston had not given her any positive signs at all.&nbsp; It might just have been a case of Tahiti syndrome but when Elena said she really wanted to move away from the islands and live in a city and go to college.&nbsp; If she became island mother she would never leave the island of lsu.
Donna thought she wanted just the opposite of Elena.&nbsp; The thought of no more cars, bills, cell phones or high pressure decisions.&nbsp; The island mother could have sex with any man or woman she desired.&nbsp; On the island of lsu she had absolute authority.&nbsp; Couples would bring her gifts and she would give them the lsu potion.&nbsp; Older couples with relationship problems would come to her island and ask for her advice, and give her gifts to get a supply of lsu potion.&nbsp; It was not a difficult decision for either and Donna left Clark and the real world behind to retire as the island mother.&nbsp; She would have a house overlooking the ocean and the lsu fruit only she could have.&nbsp; From the fruit there were seeds and the seeds made the potion.&nbsp; Everyone in the nation wanted the potion.&nbsp; Donna wanted that control over so many people.
Clark did not like his apartment.&nbsp; His bedroom with Donna was twice the size of his studio.&nbsp; The only window looked out on an alley and could hear the busses running all night.&nbsp; And he had to take the bus.&nbsp; He had not made minimum wage since high school and he was only going to get $1400 a month to pay everything.&nbsp; He was making that in a day before he met Ralston.&nbsp; Now he was living in a dive apartment and working at Wal-Mart.&nbsp; �How the fuck did this happen?� was all he could think as he put on his blue nylon vest and punched his code into the time clock.&nbsp; �This cannot get more humiliating.� 
Clark got home to find a desktop computer set up for him, with.&nbsp; A note gave him a user name and password with instructions to, sign on at 6pm.&nbsp; There was a video link to Ralston in his inbox.&nbsp; �Clark, good to see you.&nbsp; How is everything?�
�You blackmailing son of a bitch.&nbsp; I will get even with you if it..�
�Yes, I understand your frustration with your new life.&nbsp; But you are not in prison so be happy with that.&nbsp; You are ready for your first lesson in public bondage and humiliation.�
�What do you call that blue vest and ridiculous job?�
�That was Martin&#8217;s life.&nbsp; Just enough to make a living.&nbsp; If you can get a better job, help yourself.&nbsp; I noticed you had a very unbalanced smile.&nbsp; Your family could have afforded braces, why did you never get your bite fixed?&nbsp; Your sister did.�
�How the hell did you know that?&nbsp; She wanted them, I didn&#8217;t, who knows, I just hated dentist.&nbsp; Nothing unusual there.�
�Well Clark, I see it as the beginnings of your failure to allow anyone else to be in control.&nbsp; But it is time to change that.&nbsp; You are fortunate; there is a program at the university that will allow you to receive some long overdue orthodontic care.�
�I can barely afford toothpaste and you want me to get braces?&nbsp; How am I supposed to get there, the university is an hour away by car.�
�It is a very special program and will not cost you any money at all.&nbsp; I was thrilled to find it for you, and it seems they are very excited to see you.&nbsp; I took the liberty of forwarding your dental records to them.&nbsp; You have an appointment tomorrow at 3 pm.&nbsp; I am sure I do not have to remind you that your cooperation will keep you a free man.&nbsp; I will talk to you next week at the same time, don&#8217;t be late.�
And he was gone.&nbsp; �How did he find out about my sister?&nbsp; Does he really expect me to get braces at age 40.&nbsp; This is just getting stupid.�
It took two and a half hours and four busses to get to his appointment.&nbsp; After a battery of x-rays and molds of his teeth he was led into see the orthodontist.&nbsp; �I was surprised a man of your age would volunteer to join our program.&nbsp; We were very excited to see you. Fifteen years ago we found an old cache of orthodontic supplies used by Dr. Parker, a former instructor here.&nbsp;&nbsp; Between 1955 and 1965 Dr. Parker kept meticulous records of his cases, unbelievably meticulous even by today&#8217;s computerized standards.&nbsp; Our program is to document the difference between his materials and methods and todays computer modeling.&nbsp; 
Your malocclusion is statistically speaking, very close to one of Parker&#8217;s more challenging cases from 1963.&nbsp; Not only did the patient cooperate fully, mind you the patient was 15 at the time, the record of treatment is very specific and beautifully documented.&nbsp; They even kept his headgear timecards, signed by his mother telling us the number of hours he wore it every day.&nbsp; Very unusual to have such a complete record.�
�I don&#8217;t understand, you are going to use fifty year old technology on me?�
�Exactly.&nbsp; We have programmed that case into our program and the program will tell us how to treat you.&nbsp; Parker got an excellent result; we expect the program will do the same for you.&nbsp; By another stroke of good fortune we are only a week away from the exact calendar start date from 48 years ago.&nbsp; It will be like reliving history.&nbsp; You will have appointments on the same days, we can even tell you exactly how long to wear your headgear every day.�
�You mean I have to wear one of those wire things that stick out of the mouth.?&nbsp; At my age?�&nbsp; 
�I was told you had the program explained and would cooperate fully.&nbsp; Is there a problem?�
�No�no problem.&nbsp; How long will this all take?�
�Well the original patient S wore his appliances for 38 months.&nbsp; We think at your age it could take maybe 20 percent longer, I guess we will see.&nbsp; It will be fascinating to use the old style metal bands, no one on staff has any real experience in using them.&nbsp;&nbsp; We were most surprised that you agreed to all the extra-oral requirements.&nbsp; Getting children to wear the appliance is difficult enough, but an adult agreeing to wear one that many hours a day only shows how dedicated you must be.&nbsp; We need to put some rubber spacers between your teeth to make room for the bands, I am told it is the most painful part of the process, and todays patients only have eight total between the molars, full banded patients have 28.&nbsp; It will make your teeth very sore for the next week, but that is to be expected.&nbsp; Initially, in about an hour you will think you are being tortured.&nbsp; Anything touching your teeth will be painful.&nbsp; I will give you something for the pain but it is all for the greater good.&nbsp; You might not make it to work tomorrow.&nbsp; We will do the full install next week.�
The bus ride gave Clark time to figure his plan to escape Ralston&#8217;s misery.&nbsp; Could a lawyer help?&nbsp; That was his best option.&nbsp; All he had to do was prove the blackmail and it was Ralston who had the problems.&nbsp; And he thought it was time to check his Cayman account.&nbsp; First he had to do something about the intense pain the spacers were causing in his mouth. 
It was past 7 pm by the time Clark got home.&nbsp; His screen was already on with Ralston looking at him.&nbsp; A bottle of pills were in front of the screen.&nbsp;&nbsp; �I thought you might like some pain killers.&nbsp; These are especially good and will afford you a good night sleep.&nbsp; You will need the rest over the next several days; I am told that those spacers are very painful.�
�What do you want Ralston?�&nbsp; Clark was in no mood for more games.&nbsp; 
A montage of pictures of local elementary schools took over his screen, some with close-ups.&nbsp; �A thumb drive with these pictures, taken with your phone, and some of the really pornographic one you have already seen are in a stamped envelope and ready to be mailed.&nbsp; Just in case you were having second thoughts.&nbsp; Were you Clark?�
A very grim �No.�
�Good.&nbsp; I will see you next week on your way to a beautiful smile.�
It took over 6 hours to get all of the ancient orthodonture into Clark&#8217;s mouth.&nbsp; �Each of these bands was hand formed and welded to your exact dimensions.&nbsp;&nbsp; The wires and band materials are actually from Dr. Parker&#8217;s old inventory.&nbsp; Even the wire facebow of your headgear and the straps are original.&nbsp; The only thing we had to change were the spring loaded force modules.&nbsp; But the new ones are actually even better for our purposes.&nbsp; These have timers in them so we can download very specific data on time and force.&nbsp; The kids hate them because we can tell exactly how long they wear their headgear.&nbsp; No one has beat the timers yet.&nbsp; Wear both the head strap and neck strap at the same time.&nbsp; Dr. Ralston wanted me to emphasize that point to you.&nbsp; He has certainly taken a big interest in your case.�
�Lucky me.�&nbsp; Clark was peering dejectedly into a mirror.&nbsp; A bad joke was staring back at him.
�Here is your headgear schedule, by date.&nbsp; He was very motivated initially averaging twenty hours a day for the first several months.&nbsp; During the summers he wore it full time.&nbsp; I imagine he stood right out in school in 1963.&nbsp; Braces have come a long way since then Clark.&nbsp; I doubt most people care about adults wearing braces.&nbsp; Maybe even headgear.&nbsp; I will see you in three weeks.�
Clark took the headgear off as soon as he was out of the office.&nbsp; Trying not to smile at anyone he expected to see Ralston&#8217;s face when he finally got home.&nbsp; �What, no smile?&nbsp; Shouldn&#8217;t you have your headgear on?�
�Fuck you Ralston.&nbsp; This whole thing is..�
Ralston broke in..�Humiliating.&nbsp; Thank you Clark.&nbsp; Those braces will certainly not come off and I will check each appointment to make sure you are wearing your headgear.&nbsp;&nbsp; Remember, you can still be wearing braces in prison.&nbsp; Goodnight Clark.�
The first few weeks made Clark as insecure as he had ever been.&nbsp; The childhood plague of wires and headgear kept him from staring anyone in the eye.&nbsp; He could hear the chuckles and feel the stares. Each day on the bus and at work he saw the double takes and the grinning children.&nbsp; His metal smile always drew a glance.&nbsp; He couldn&#8217;t do anything about it.&nbsp; 
It was his first anniversary at Walmart.&nbsp; He got an �Employee of the month� award and an invitation to join a management trainee program.&nbsp; He took the chance to make more money.&nbsp; He had applied everywhere but could not even get a call back on a real job.&nbsp; No one was hiring in the equity market and he had no other job market skills.
He got home that day with a package at his door&nbsp; and saw Ralston&#8217;s image for the first time in months.&nbsp; �See Clark, your braces aren&#8217;t affecting your career path.&nbsp; I am told you have been wearing your headgear like a good little patient.&nbsp; You might be making another $250 dollars a month soon as an assistant manager.&nbsp; And that new cashier with braces has been eyeing you, do I detect a brewing romance?.&nbsp; Mind you hers&#8217; are the latest in technology,&nbsp; and you have to look past the fact the she outweighs you by at least thirty pounds.&nbsp; But you would make such a magnetic couple.&nbsp; Forget about the new blond manager, she could barely keep a straight face when she looks at you, especially with your new clothing. Are you ready for your next challenge?�
�What?�
�Your next stage in public entrapment and humiliation.&nbsp; You did not think it was over, did you?�
�I will still be wearing this junk for another two years, if I&#8217;m lucky.&nbsp; People stare at me like I am retarded or something.&nbsp; Congratulations, I feel like a high school reject wearing this thing.�
�Old news Clark but flattery will get you nowhere.&nbsp; New year, new humiliation.&nbsp; Just in case I am wrong about the blond.&nbsp; Open the package please.�

In the box were a small, square metal box, about the size of a cell phone, a small but secure looking padlock, a package containing plastic material and some diapers.&nbsp; �What the hell is this crap?�
�The box is on a timer lock, it will open twice a day for ten minutes, and ten minutes only.&nbsp; You cannot close the box unless the key is in it.&nbsp; The padlock must be locked or the key will not come out.&nbsp; You now have two pairs of locking plastic underwear.&nbsp; They are designed for resistant mental patients and are quite secure when locked.&nbsp; Open the diapers and put one on.&nbsp; Then put on the plastic undies, lock them, and put the key in the box.&nbsp; You will do this twice a day.&nbsp; I can track the activity in the box.&nbsp;&nbsp; I will check in randomly, here and by cell phone.&nbsp; If I find you are not wearing your diapers for longer than those two ten minute periods, I will send out the photos.&nbsp; Do you understand?�
�You have to be joking.&nbsp; You expect me to wear diapers all day?&nbsp; Not a chance.�
Several ugly pornographic pictures and one of a cell door closing behind a man hit the screen.&nbsp; Clark fumbled for a minute, but managed to fit the diaper correctly, put on the underpants and locked the lock.&nbsp; �How am I supposed to use the bathroom like this?�
As Ralston started laughing Clark saw how stupid his question was.&nbsp; And then was overcome with the urge to piss.&nbsp; After a half hour of trying to find a way around the diaper, for the first time in 39 years, he wet his diapers.&nbsp; Ralston had him humiliated again.
The little box beeped promptly at ten minutes to seven.&nbsp; Ten minutes later it popped open and Clark unlocked the pants and ran to the toilet.&nbsp; In the stress he was not ready to do anything but urinate.&nbsp; He could not force any shit out.&nbsp; In frustration he put on a new diaper, locked the pants and tried to dress.&nbsp; His pants were almost too tight.&nbsp; It looked obvious that he was wearing a bulky undergarment.
The plastic pants would squeak as he shifted in his seat on the bus and was already regretting his second cup of coffee.&nbsp; Before he could punch in he let a long stream flow into his diaper.&nbsp; It was only 9am.
By the time he was on his way home he could smell his own piss.&nbsp; He was ready at the toilet and was able to empty his bowels.&nbsp; The little box beeped it was about to close as he barely managed to get the key back in.&nbsp;&nbsp; He had two large martinis for dinner.&nbsp;&nbsp; By the time he went to bed he realized the other downside of his plastic underwear, he could not touch his dick.&nbsp; He had not had sex with a woman since the first night on the island, now he could not even masturbate.
It was the second alarm from the box that finally woke him up.&nbsp; He had overslept and it was now too late to open the box and his diaper was already wet.&nbsp; After ten minutes of cursing Ralston he got dressed for his first day of management training, with a wet diaper.&nbsp; He was on the bus when he knew he needed to shit.&nbsp; He went into a stall in the bathroom at work, but there was no fighting it, he filled the diaper.&nbsp; Within an hour he knew other could smell him. 
The two women in the class, already amused by his headgear and braces, saw him bend over to pick up a pen.&nbsp; He heard one say �Oh my god, he&#8217;s wearing a diaper.&nbsp; Is this the best they can come up with around here?�&nbsp; They both laughed.&nbsp; 
Clark made a weak excuse about the afternoon class and the trainer looked more than happy to let him go.&nbsp; The bus ride home was no less embarrassing as people would see, then smell him.&nbsp; Clark was thrilled to finally close the door behind him.&nbsp; The computer flicked on.&nbsp; �Clark, how was your class, you are home early.&nbsp;&nbsp; I see you missed your morning diaper change this morning, was that a problem?�
�Look, Ralston, this has to end.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t live like this.&nbsp; I have shit in a diaper and I can&#8217;t even change it.&nbsp; Women are laughing at me.&nbsp; This is ridiculous, you have to change something.�
�No, I don&#8217;t.&nbsp; You will adjust to the diaper schedule.&nbsp; If you don&#8217;t think you can get home in time, start carrying a diaper bag.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t forget, you never know when I might be watching.&nbsp; Remember to use the baby powder.�
It was not a good sign when the training manager approached him before class the next morning.&nbsp; There was a brief discussion about the class being overcrowded and unfortunately he would need to wait until the next session.&nbsp; He was also asked to review the company handbook on personal hygiene.&nbsp; �Some of your classmates made comments yesterday that you need to, um, present yourself better.&nbsp; Do you have any health issues we need to know about?�
Clark was turning red.&nbsp; �No, um, it was just a bad day.�&nbsp; Like that somehow explained things.
�Also, if you don&#8217;t mind me asking, do you always wear that headgear.&nbsp; It does not really project &#8216;manager&#8217;, if you know what I mean.&nbsp; These personal matters are important to us here.&nbsp; Maybe you can take one of our supervisor classes until you get a feel for our company.&nbsp; Do you understand Clark?�
Clark understood.&nbsp; He was now a marked man, some sort of freak who would never even make it to assistant manager.&nbsp; He stopped at a local bar on the way home, he needed a drink.&nbsp; He put his headgear in his jacket pocket and walked into the bar.&nbsp; After a second drink a well dressed woman sat down next to him,&nbsp; amused by his braces.&nbsp; She had been drinking at the other end of the bar and ordered a round for both of them.&nbsp; A couple of shots followed.&nbsp; 
Clark could feel his dick hardening as she rubber her hands up and down his back.&nbsp; She whispered in his ear �do you live close by?�&nbsp; As leaned over to kiss her she pushed her hands down into his pants.&nbsp; And immediately pulled back.&nbsp; �What do you have down there, diapers?�&nbsp; What started as a joke became a realization as she saw the look on Clark&#8217;s face.&nbsp; �Sorry, have to leave now, maybe I will see you again.�&nbsp; And with that she was gone.&nbsp; Clark walked home for his evening change.
Over the next year he adapted to the schedule the diaper forced on him.&nbsp; He got much better at timing his bowl movements but refused to venture in public unless he had to.&nbsp; It was now the second anniversary of his new life.&nbsp; The orthodontist promised that all was going well but it was difficult to project how much longer it would be.&nbsp; �Keep wearing you headgear, you are doing great.�
As usual, he was in no mood to see Ralston&#8217;s face.&nbsp; �Clark, happy anniversary.&nbsp; I understand your cooperation is excellent.&nbsp; A couple of more years and they will be off your teeth.&nbsp; Are you ready for the next step?�
�Anything will be better than wearing this diaper.&nbsp; I am glad that year is over.�
�A year is over, nothing says your diapers are Clark.&nbsp; Those braces will come off when the orthodontist is done.&nbsp; The diapers will stay until our contract is complete.&nbsp; You have 8 years to go.&nbsp; And I have a surprise for you, please go look in your closet.�
Clark really did not like the sound of that.&nbsp; As he looked inside he saw that his clothes had been replaced with baby styled dresses and jumpsuits.&nbsp; His dresser drawers had slips and bloomers and other girl&#8217;s undergarments.&nbsp; �I hope I got your size right, I know the colors are good for you.&nbsp; I think young girls dress too informally these days with pants and jeans and everything.&nbsp; I thought you should do without such vulgarities, so these clothes have been specially picked from the finest adult locking sissy wear line.&nbsp; The rules are the same as for the diapers.&nbsp; I will be checking. �&nbsp; 
�No, no more.&nbsp; This ends now.�
�No Clark, it does not.&nbsp; You will wear the clothes I have provided and nothing else, except your diapers of course.&nbsp; You have a month&#8217;s worth of outfits, do not repeat any of them.&nbsp; Remember, I am watching and I am entirely serious about sending you to the slam.&nbsp; I will do it.&nbsp; Now why don&#8217;t you put on that pretty blue dress.�
For the first time Clark broke down and cried.&nbsp; Sobbing uncontrollably he was pleading with Ralston �Please end this, I really can&#8217;t, I can&#8217;t go out like this anymore.&nbsp; I look like some sort of joke where ever I go. �He pulled off his headgear and threw it across the room.&nbsp; He pulled off his pants and started pulling at his underpants.&nbsp; �I want this shit to end.&nbsp; I want to find Donna and go home.&nbsp; I am so fucking sorry I ever met you.�&nbsp;&nbsp; He was on his bed crying.
�Very touching.&nbsp; I am almost moved.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the first time you have mentioned her name in two years. Speaking of movements isn&#8217;t it time to change your diapers?&nbsp; By the way, I am not sure if Walmart will take too kindly to your new style of dress.&nbsp; Just to be safe I will send you a contact, he needs people all the time, feel free to use my name.�
Clark had to make a decision.&nbsp; He was staring into the closet.&nbsp; He had to pick something but could not bear the thought of having to walk around in public dressed like a six year old girl.&nbsp; Even the shoes made him look silly, or insane.&nbsp; He picked a navy blue sailor type outfit.&nbsp; It had a concealed chain on the inside with a small lock so it could be linked to his underpants.&nbsp; As the padlock snapped shut Clark made sure his hair was right, put on his headgear and headed towards the door.&nbsp; Even his neighbor was giving him strange looks.
The manager would not even let him clock in until he changed his clothing.&nbsp; When he could not explain why he would not change, he was given his final disciplinary warning.&nbsp; With all his other problems, now he did not have a job.
Any chance of getting a real job was now gone.&nbsp; It was one thing not finding a decent job in a bad economy while attempting to promote your experience though a mouthful of hideous braces and showing a sense of style with a diaper on.&nbsp; Wearing a wardrobe of young girl&#8217;s clothing was certainly going to make sure no one would even read his application once they saw him.
Even the thought of making contact with his friends or family was out of the question until he found a way around Ralston&#8217;s plan.&nbsp; Clark would not even contemplate prison.&nbsp; His only choice was Ralston&#8217;s lead.
It was a short walk from the bus stop to the building.&nbsp; The receptionist in the lobby&nbsp; took one look at Clark, without hearing his question, said �Let me guess, another one for Fetco?&nbsp; 402, elevators are that way.�&nbsp; All Ralston had given him was an address, the receptionist apparently knew more about the job than he did.&nbsp; Even in a crowded elevator people gave Clark plenty of room.&nbsp; He was happy to get off on the fourth floor.
The sign said &#8217;Fetco Publications&#8217; and a smaller sign under it reading &#8216;Hours by appointment only&#8217;.&nbsp; He walked into a small reception area and was greeted with a nonchalant nod by the receptionist.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was on the phone as Clark looked at the pictures on the wall, all framed covers from various magazines.&nbsp; It did not take long to see that these were not magazines you see in a store.&nbsp; From men dressed in leather to women in latex, chains to curious looking chairs, all sorts of fetish wear was represented.
Done with the phone call the receptionist, the only person all day not to look weirdly at him all day, asked �Can I help you?�
�Um�A friend gave me this address and umm said you might have a job.�
�I&#8217;m sorry, we work by appointment only�.�&nbsp; He picked up the intercom as Clark turned to leave �no Mr. Raymond, no more appointments�.just a walk-in dressed like your cousin Milton�� Clark knew that was an insult to both he and Milton, whoever that was.&nbsp; He closed the door and walked towards the elevator.
The receptionist caught him at the elevator.&nbsp; �Mr. Raymond can see you.�
�Ray Raymond, have a seat.�&nbsp; He had not even looked up yet.&nbsp; When he did he just stared for a moment.&nbsp; �How did you know we were having a call, who sent you?&nbsp; I told all you guys I was not going to brand this issue, I ain&#8217;t pushing anyone&#8217;s line.�
Clark did not know what to say.&nbsp; �I just needed a job, Ralston gave me this address, I don&#8217;t even know what you do.�
�If you don&#8217;t know anything how you dressed up for a shoot?&nbsp; Let me have your portfolio.&nbsp; You ever work with Chucky before?&nbsp; He lend you that stuff?�
�I don&#8217;t know what you are talking about.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any portfolio and don&#8217;t know any Chucky.&nbsp; Sorry for wasting your time.�&nbsp; He got up to leave.
�Hey buddy relax.&nbsp; Have a seat.&nbsp; I mean my model cancels the shoot at the last second and in walks a guy in a toddler&#8217;s blue dress.&nbsp; That braces thing is a little overkill, really throws off the age thing though, we don&#8217;t do the teens til next week.&nbsp; So you have to lose them.&nbsp; Good sales trick though, you are a real eye stopper dressed like that.�
�The braces are real.&nbsp; I can take off the headgear.�
�No shit, at your age?&nbsp; No portfolio either.&nbsp; Not good if you want to do anything in this business.&nbsp; Who have you worked for?�
�Walmart.�
�Hey, a Walmart gig.&nbsp; What section?&nbsp; Who got you that, that&#8217;s a tough shoot to get.�
�I was a boxboy.�
Ray Raymond just stared at him.&nbsp; �Let me get this straight, you show up here with no appointment, no portfolio and no idea what we do.&nbsp; You actually dress like that?�
Clark again started for the door.&nbsp; �Buddy, sit down.&nbsp; We can do business, relax, just checking.&nbsp; Reality is I need a model for a series I&#8217;m doing for &#8216;Scarlett Underground&#8217;, ever read it?�
�No.�
�Good rag for people with your taste.&nbsp; Gives us steady work.&nbsp; So you ready to sit for us?�
�You want me to model for some magazine looking like this?�&nbsp; Clark was stunned.
�Even without experience I will get you $500 a week.&nbsp; We can shoot around the braces until the teen issue, even the adults.&nbsp; This could be a six month promo, good work.&nbsp; Might even get you some promo work at the trade shows, I know a couple of guys would go for a natural like you.&nbsp; So we good?&nbsp; Just need the usual releases.�
�Me.&nbsp; A model.&nbsp; What would I model?�
�We can shoot you with what you have on.&nbsp; Or we can supply.&nbsp; If you like your stuff you can wear that.&nbsp; We are doing a series on soft fetishes, and a sissy like you will work just fine,&nbsp; We can shoot around the face to really give us the adult baby look.&nbsp; How about three tomorrow afternoon?�
Three years ago Clark would have laughed at the guy, but it was better money and he would not be on public display all day.&nbsp; As insane as it seemed, he took the job.&nbsp; �I have an orthodontist appointment at 2:30.&nbsp; How about four?�
�Perfect.&nbsp; My lucky day.&nbsp; I will tell Chucky.�
And Chucky was delighted as he set up the camera.&nbsp; �And diapers too.&nbsp; You sure have a lot going on honey.&nbsp; Your mistress pick your clothes?�
�I don&#8217;t have a mistress.�
�Well baby doll, let me introduce you around.&nbsp; I know Charlie at AdultBaby, he is looking for a show model for his cribs.&nbsp; You would be perfect.&nbsp; He pays right too, cash, no checks.&nbsp; And after work we can meet some people I know.&nbsp; They will just love you.&nbsp; Which sex do you prefer, or does it matter?�
�I&#8217;m straight, don&#8217;t let the clothes fool you.�
�Of course you are honey, a perfect picture of manliness.&nbsp; Smile now, let&#8217;s capture all that metal.
As it turned out, Chucky and Ray were right.&nbsp; Clark was able to make twice as much money on the side as a representative of AdultBaby.&nbsp; He was not really concerned anymore after taking the bus and walking around in a child&#8217;s dress, what did he care.&nbsp; No one he knew would see him.&nbsp; And even if his new friends had some unusual sexual habits, it beat sitting in that apartment alone.&nbsp; It was how easily they accepted him, dirty diapers and all.&nbsp; 
A year later he was still doing the AdultBaby shows.&nbsp; He no longer walked around afraid he would be seen.&nbsp; He was becoming adapted to being the odd one where ever he went.&nbsp; Even the orthodontist had him come at a separate time after some parents of other patients complained about his attire.&nbsp; But he had no choice but to live with it.
Ray had no more work and money was becoming tight again.&nbsp; Clark just stared at the box on his table.&nbsp; It was waiting when he got home.&nbsp; It had to be from Ralston and it scared him.&nbsp; At diaper changing time, the screen popped on.&nbsp; �Happy Anniversary Clark.&nbsp; I have a new present for you.&nbsp; Have you opened it yet?�
�No.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t suppose it would do any good to leave it unopened.�
�Only if you want to do the time.&nbsp; Please open it now.�
Clark pulled a dog collar with attached leash and an opened padlock from the crate.&nbsp; �Put it on and lock it.&nbsp; Then put the key in the new box.&nbsp; You can check to make sure the key works if you want.�
Clark tested the lock and it worked.&nbsp; He knew it was pointless to argue so he put on the collar and snapped the lock shut.&nbsp; When he put the key in the box he heard a loud clunk.&nbsp; The box popped open and two pieces fell out.
�I am told your braces will be off in a year.&nbsp; I will miss seeing&nbsp; you without all that gleaming steel.�
�Funny.&nbsp; What was the point of the key thing.&nbsp; You know I don&#8217;t have a choice.&nbsp; So now what happens?�
�Unlike the braces and diapers and your dresses, you can get the leash off, if you want.&nbsp; Just be sure not to damage it.&nbsp; Should not be a problem, it looks very sturdy.&nbsp; Do you want the other key?�
�Of course I fucking want it off.&nbsp; Get to the point.�
�One of your new friends has access to the key.&nbsp; That person loves to work the alternative lifestyles nightclub scene.&nbsp; Find that person and ask for Ralston&#8217;s key.&nbsp; That simple.�
�Who, what club, when?&nbsp; Give me a god damned clue.&nbsp; Or just screw it, I&#8217;ll just leave it on, who will notice on me anyway?�
�Your dog walker will notice.�
�I don&#8217;t have a dog Ralston.�
�No, but you do have a dog walker.&nbsp; Until you get that leash off your walker will take you lots of places.&nbsp; Grocery stores, restaurants, maybe even an amusement park or two.&nbsp; Where ever they want to go.&nbsp; And if no dogs are allowed some places you will stay leashed out front until your walker is ready to go.&nbsp; You will be walked at least one hour twice a day.&nbsp; You know the consequences if you misbehave.&nbsp; Time to change your nappy, isn&#8217;t it.&nbsp; See you next year.�&nbsp; The screen went black.
Five minutes after his diaper change the doorbell rang.&nbsp; A large, heavyset woman was at the door.&nbsp; �You must be Clark, they said you would be easy to recognize.&nbsp; Time to go rover, I have errands to run.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t give me any problems.�&nbsp; She grabbed his leash and led him down the steps.&nbsp; At each stop she would attach the leash to a post or railing.&nbsp; Mothers with little children would walk far around him.&nbsp; Others just pointed and laughed.&nbsp; Standing there, still wearing his headgear, in a blue chiffon dress with a dog collar attached, Clark had enough.
After two weeks of searching the bars he had gotten all sorts of suggestions and invitations.&nbsp; He had approached dozens of patrons but with no success.&nbsp; He left his third club of the night and was walking to the bus stop, when the police car stopped him.&nbsp; �We received a call about a peeping Tom.&nbsp; Can I see some ID?&nbsp; Have you been drinking sir?�&nbsp; But Clark did not have his wallet, there are no pockets in a dress.&nbsp;&nbsp; And he was not at all sober.&nbsp; �OK, come along with us until we figure out who, and what, you are.�
The desk sergeant did not even want to deal with him.&nbsp; �Book him on public intoxication and get him in front of a judge as soon as we can.&nbsp; If we put this one in a cell we will have a problem all night.&nbsp; Make sure you run his prints first.�
The judge was no better.&nbsp; �What is the charge on this one?&nbsp; And what is that smell?�
�Public intoxication your honor, he was picked up in the area of a reported peeping Tom and blew a .17.&nbsp; That smell is his diaper your honor.�
The judge shook his head.&nbsp; �Been like this all night.&nbsp; Must be a full moon.&nbsp; Any priors?�
�Not that we can see your honor.�
�Release Cinderella here on his own recognizance and give him a hearing date.&nbsp; I pity your family son.�
***
He got the usual stares at the airport and almost expected the special questioning and search at the gate.&nbsp; He had to talk to Ralston face to face.&nbsp; He wanted to see Donna again and get rid of the nightmare his life had become.&nbsp; If that meant surrendering to Donna that was fine, much better than the living the hell he was in.
***
Ralston did not seem to be the least bit surprised to see him.&nbsp; 
�Where is Donna?�
�Would you like to go see her?&nbsp; She is on her own little island out there, and with a great tan I might add.&nbsp; I will have them get the seaplane ready. �
Clark had not expected Ralston to agree so quickly or easily but figured Ralston just wanted to add on more humiliation by parading him in front of his ex-wife.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flight took eight hours on the tiny plane to reach the remote island and Ralston would not talk about what Donna had been doing.&nbsp; 
Finally they reached her tiny enclave set among the Isu trees.&nbsp; It took a moment until Clark spotted her and he had to look twice to be sure.&nbsp; It was Donna, all 360 pounds of her.
***
It had only been three years but Donna was having problems remembering what comfort was like.&nbsp; Worse, all she could taste was the Isu fruit.
Donna had gained another five pounds that month.&nbsp; She was now over 360 pounds with no sign of slowing down.&nbsp; Still she craved more of the damn fruit.
It was actually a beautiful day by normal standards and two couples needed her services.&nbsp;&nbsp; She had a batch ready for both of them.&nbsp; Her first few couples were very exciting.&nbsp; The reverence they showed her, the respect.&nbsp; She spoke and people did her bidding.&nbsp; Problem was, there was nothing to bid for, this was the most boring place she had ever been.&nbsp; 
The islands were so remote there were no tourist, no real commerce.&nbsp; Cell phones and the internet were useless, there was no signal within a thousand miles, and the islands could not afford the satellite connections, not that there were any in range.&nbsp; Any electricity came from a gas powered generator which was too expensive to run.&nbsp; And no running water, especially hot water.&nbsp; The house was warm and dry.&nbsp; It never got too hot or too cold.&nbsp; There was a storm shelter in case of a typhoon, but there had not been one in over 150 years.&nbsp; It certainly rained enough but the weather actually never really changed.
She was 1500 miles from anywhere near civilization.&nbsp; What had once seemed so romantic was now an island prison.&nbsp; Donna did not understand the reason Elena gave at the time for not becoming the island mother.&nbsp; Elena had said she could was afraid she would never travel, never see the world.&nbsp; She wanted to go to college in the United States.&nbsp; &#8216;She wants to become me&#8217; Donna thought at the time.&nbsp; Now it was Donna who wanted to be her.
Elena never mentioned the weight thing.&nbsp; She was used to large women on the island.&nbsp; All of the island mothers attained great weight eating the fruit.&nbsp; And they could never stop.&nbsp; The parasites insisted.&nbsp; As the natives learned hundreds of years before, the Isu fruit was filling and nourishing.&nbsp; But there was no way to kill the parasites once you ate, or even touched the fruit.&nbsp; So an island mother did the task and made the extract for all to enjoy, at the cost of her freedom.
Donna had tried getting away on a boat but the parasites wanted live fruit every four hours, day and night.&nbsp; They were very precise, within fifteen minutes of feeding time the pangs began and without the fruit an intense stomach ache.&nbsp;&nbsp; The boat was still an hour away from the main island before Donna passed out from the pain.&nbsp; Everyone had warned her of the danger and they brought her back to the island.&nbsp; Once she started eating the fruit again she was fine.&nbsp; Doctors had tried cures on other mothers but none had killed the parasites.&nbsp; Surprisingly no one eating the fruit ever got sick, or weighed less than 400 pounds.&nbsp; Island mothers lived long lives, even with the extreme weight
*****

It took a moment for them to recognize each other.&nbsp; Donna was over three times her size since Clark had last seen her and Clark looked like he was dressed in a bad Halloween costume.&nbsp; They stared at each other, motionless, and they both started crying.&nbsp; Three years of repressed emotions came pouring out as they hugged each other.&nbsp; Each so familiar yet now very different, and not just physically.
After five minutes they both glared at Ralston.&nbsp; �You did this to us.�&nbsp; 
�I only did what you asked.�
Almost in unison Donna and Clark screamed &#8216;by destroying our lives?&#8217;


�You wanted to come to grips with your marital problems and I agreed to help.&nbsp; Correct me if I am wrong but you both feel an intense bond right now, don&#8217;t you?�
�Look at us, look what you have done to us.&nbsp; Drugging us, blackmailing me,&nbsp; and look at Donna and what you have done to her, infecting her with parasites, what sort of sadistic bastard�.�&nbsp; Clark and Donna we in each other&#8217;s arms.
�Are you wearing a diaper?�&nbsp; Donna stared at Clark, who had missed his last change.
�We want to go home.�
�Is that true Donna?�
�You know I can&#8217;t leave.�
�Would you like to go home with Clark?&nbsp; Would you like to get married again?�
�We never wanted your damn divorce, or your neurotoxins or any of this.&nbsp; We were made for each other, I never even though of anyone else in the years we were married.&nbsp; Was it perfect, no.&nbsp; And you owe us one million dollars, don&#8217;t you?�
�Actually, no.&nbsp; I think we have accomplished everything we discussed.&nbsp; You will both live as a happily married couple I am guessing for the rest of your lives.�
�Like this?�&nbsp; Donna was screaming.&nbsp; �On this stupid island eating that damn fruit?�
�Actually, no again.&nbsp; You can leave whenever you want, you both always could.�
�And she dies and I go to prison, fuck you.�
�Again, no.&nbsp; The blackmail was a con.&nbsp; All of it has been a ruse and you both cooperated fully.&nbsp; There isn&#8217;t any neurotoxin that can do what I said.&nbsp; The collars were just theatrical props with perfume on them.�
�But you made us piss�.�
�Great effect, wasn&#8217;t it.&nbsp; We slipped you a slight hypnotic and another diuretic when we gave you the iced tea.&nbsp; The rest was just hypnotic suggestion.&nbsp; The trick has worked before.&nbsp; I was actually you lawyer, even if the pornography was real it could never have been used against you if it came from your lawyer.&nbsp; I was surprised you never followed up on that Clark.&nbsp; It was all a fraud.�
�You mean I gave up my company and all our money for nothing.&nbsp; All of the shit I had to put up with, the fucking braces and dresses�.�
�Easy Clark.&nbsp; Your investments have done very well.&nbsp; Thanks to Donna we can kill the parasites.&nbsp; In fact if she had not returned&nbsp; to the island she would have been fine.&nbsp; Once the parasites are cut off from the food source they start digesting the fat cells that have traces of the enzyme they live on.&nbsp; If she just stops eating the fruit she should be back to her old shape, won&#8217;t even have to exercise, the parasites will do it all.&nbsp; I should add that now that the parasites can be eradicated the aphrodisiac from the Isu fruit will make this island a fortune if it is marketed correctly.&nbsp; You will both get part of that money, not to mention the drug patents that will follow.&nbsp; You will be independently wealthy.�
�Why did you do it to us?�&nbsp; Donna had a confused look on her face.
�The only way to get you both to see yourselves was to separate you.&nbsp; I admit we got lucky the way it happened.&nbsp; You both had to swallow your pride.&nbsp; Once you got past yourselves you could start seeing the other as a partner, not a conquest.&nbsp; Your pride was in the way.&nbsp; Your pride has been tempered and I think you will enjoy each other in ways you never imagined.&nbsp; If you are not happier one year from today I will pay the million.&nbsp; But I feel comfortable I am right.
Remember Elena and Martin?&nbsp; I rented them your house.&nbsp; Elena has a fortune in pearls so she is enrolled in college and is doing quite well.&nbsp; Martin is her servant and has never been happier.&nbsp; She treats him badly, but only in private.&nbsp; He made assistant manager at Wal-Mart.&nbsp; You can certainly go back to your old lives but think about staying here and helping the islanders set up their business.&nbsp; They will even be able to afford electricity, maybe even a satellite link.&nbsp; You have to admit, these are some nice islands, just a bit isolated.�

POSTSCRIPT:

�Mr. Clark, we need another worker for the order desk.�
�You know what to do, see if anyone on Tonga needs work.&nbsp; We are flying to Los Angeles to close the deal tomorrow.&nbsp; There is a buyer for the house and our furniture will arrive before we get back, have it stored until the construction is done.&nbsp;&nbsp; We will be back in a week, after I finally get these braces off.�
He smiled flashing his four year metallic smile.&nbsp; Clark and Donna looked tanned and relaxed.&nbsp; Donna, a trim 115 pounds,&nbsp; was looking forward to a trip down Rodeo drive.&nbsp; The computer flicked on.
�Clark, Donna, how are you?�
�Never been better Ralston, thank you.�
�And how is the baby?�
�Coming with us to LA to see the family.&nbsp; They are still trying to get details on where we have been.�
�And what did you tell them, the truth?�
�We tried, but they don&#8217;t believe us.&nbsp; They are mad we did not cut them in on this deal.�
�And how is business?�
�Doing a million a week now, really cutting into the sales of that little blue pill.&nbsp; We will pass them in a year.&nbsp; There is a huge crop if Isu this year.�
�Guarantee filled?�
�Guarantee filled, we have never been happier.�
