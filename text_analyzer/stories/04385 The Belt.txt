I sit on the edge of my bed, turning the belt over in my
hands, thinking. &nbsp;Thinking about the last time I had seen this particular
belt. &nbsp;Thinking about the last time I had used this particular belt.
&nbsp;Thinking about the teasing I had endured from him for years because of
how I had used this belt that first time. 

&nbsp;

I haven't seen this belt in forever; it's easily been at
least three moves ago,&nbsp;when I moved from Illinois to Texas. &nbsp;At that time I was newly
married, and I put the belt away - out of sight, out of mind - theoretically
out of respect for my new husband. &nbsp;The reality was that it was a physical
reminder of a part of my psyche I had barely begun to explore before it scared
me. &nbsp;It scared me so badly I ran to the first &quot;safe&quot; man I came
across and married him. 

&nbsp;

Live and learn. 

&nbsp;

It's been a few years since then, and now I am free of the
&quot;safe&quot; man.&nbsp; I'm unpacking boxes in my new apartment, where I'm
alone again for the first time in nearly ten years. &nbsp;New town, new job,
new home, new life.



&nbsp;

With a sigh I look down at the belt in my hands. &nbsp;I've
doubled it over as I would to strike someone - myself - with it. &nbsp;The
leather is still supple despite spending the better part of a decade in
storage, and near the buckle, the stains of my momentary lapse in common sense
remain, darker now than I remember. 

&nbsp;

The phone rings and I stand up to hunt for the handset. I
leave the belt on my bed and start rooting through the assorted boxes near the
bed, getting progressively closer to the dratted handset.&nbsp; The answering
machine hasn't been hooked up yet, which is just as well as it allows me to
find the handset somewhere around the tenth ring. I answer, but no one is there
now. &nbsp;I start laughing - of course whoever it was gave up just as I
finally find the darn phone. &nbsp;I check the caller ID out of habit, and the
laughter fades as I see his number staring back at me, mocking me. 

&nbsp;

As usual, my timing is off. &nbsp;Immediately I call back
and am answered with only the ceaseless ringing of the phone on the other end,
reminding me that his availability is sporadic at best. 

&nbsp;

I sit among the half-unpacked boxes, suddenly drained.
&nbsp;I'm tired, oh-so-tired, both physically and emotionally. &nbsp; It hits
me when I least expect it, and the only thing that seems to help is sleep.
&nbsp;So I stumble back to my bed and lay there, waiting for sleep to overtake
and heal me. 



&nbsp;

But the one time I crave it, need it desperately, sleep
fails to come for me. &nbsp;I lay there, exhausted, too&nbsp;tense
to&nbsp;sleep. &nbsp;Relax, I try to tell myself, just relax and sleep will
follow. 

&nbsp;

Twenty minutes later and not only am I drained, I'm
frustrated as well. &nbsp;My mind is racing and it won't let go of the thoughts
enough to let me sleep. &nbsp;It doesn't help that those thoughts center around
him and the complexities of our relationship, the bad as well as the good.
&nbsp;Every little thing I've ever done &quot;wrong&quot; (at least in my
mind); every little word of praise and affection and yes, love, from him. 

&nbsp;

I sit up, dangling my legs over the side of the bed, and
realise I'm still playing with the damned belt. &nbsp;Still turning it around
and around, doubling it this way then that, listening to a&nbsp;voice - his
voice -&nbsp;remind me with a smile to not use the buckle end. &nbsp;I smile to
myself, still feeling a bit silly about that after all this time, but I promise
it made sense at the time . . . that, and it felt good. 

&nbsp;

Even now I can remember sitting on the edge of a different
bed, in a different town years ago with this same belt, arguing with myself.
&nbsp;What person in their right mind would whip themselves on the mere say-so
of another person?&nbsp; There must be something wrong with me, I thought, only
to correct myself the next moment: maybe there's something right with me and
this is merely a test, a tool to discover that something. &nbsp; The debate within
me raged for what seemed like hours, the taboos I'd been taught to hold sacred
by society warring with the reality I was experiencing.

&nbsp;

In the end, I stood up, stripped away my clothes and (at the
risk of sounding too clich�) my inhibitions. &nbsp;Even though I wielded the
belt myself, I felt his hand as each stroke landed on my back. &nbsp;I remember
being surprised at how aroused I became, how wet my pussy was when I finally
stopped, how the barest touch of my fingers to my clit pushed me right over the
edge and left me collapsed in a heap on the floor. 

&nbsp;

It wasn't until later, once I had returned to myself, that I
even noticed the blood on the belt. &nbsp;I was surprised, then shocked. �I couldn't figure out where the blood had come
from at first, not until I took a shower and watched the water turn
reddish-pink.� My first instinct was to
assume my period had started, but I knew better, especially as the hot water
made the wounds left by the belt sting. &nbsp;There wasn't a lot of blood, just
enough to let me know I would have a couple scabs to deal with, reminders of
the day's events. 



&nbsp;

I think the most embarrassing part of my first
self-flagellating experience was admitting to him what I had done, how without
thinking I had drawn blood. �He teased me
then, though I knew he felt it a failing on his part for not giving me more
specific instructions. �He's since teased
me off and on for years about it, most recently as a frame of reference for my
seemingly high tolerance for pain. 

&nbsp;

All of this runs through my mind as I sit on the edge my bed
in the here and now, still playing with the belt. �One hand lets go of the belt and traces the
lines of the physical scars that remain on my back all these years later. �I hear his voice in my mind, admonishing me
gently to not use the buckle end. I look again at the belt and see the stains
near the buckle, and for the first time I don't associate the stains with the
embarrassment of old, but rather with the empowerment of knowing what I am . .
. who I am. 

&nbsp;

As I did
that day so many years ago, I stand and strip my clothes away, though this time
my inhibitions are no longer a hindrance. �I run the length of the belt across my
breasts, my nipples hardening as the leather caresses my skin. �For a brief moment I cinch the belt tight around
my chest, binding my breasts, then let&nbsp;the belt&nbsp;dangle from my hand
before I draw it between my legs. �It
scrapes against my swollen pussy, teasing with the promise of the pain to come.


&nbsp;



I close my eyes for a moment and let my mind concentrate on my body,
these last few moments before the belt marks me. �My body shivers in anticipation and
unconsciously tightens against the onslaught to come. �I take a deep breath and open my eyes, willing
my body to relax, and without preamble or preface land the first blow on my
back. �A gasp escapes me, a mixture of
pain, pleasure and release. �The second
and third blows follow quickly, and I find myself moving into a rhythm: my
back, my legs, my ass. 

&nbsp;

I can feel
the welts rising as the intensity of the blows varies. �Each welt in turn a caress, a mark, a
reminder. �It's difficult to concentrate
on keeping tally of the blows, so lost am I in the sensations, but I finally
reach twenty and the belt stops. �Stopping
just long enough to catch my breath, I reach for the belt again. �This time it is simply to bind my breasts just
enough to make them tender to the touch, no marks today. 

&nbsp;

I try to
resist the temptation to touch myself, to push myself over the edge. �I want to make this indescribable set of
feelings and sensations last. �In the end
I give in to temptation, and as before, just the barest, lightest touch sends
me flying. 

&nbsp;

Later, when
I take my shower, I'm not surprised to see the water turn a reddish-pink. &nbsp;Some
things never change.
