THE SLAVE WHISPERER: PROLOGUE - Pilot Episode

It may have been night, and the town car may have been black, but anyone that had spotted it would have noted right away it did not belong in this quiet, suburban neighborhood of single floor and two story houses. It appeared to be a Cadillac, but it was not: it was rather unique, designed by somebody, built by somebody else, like the owner who was sitting serenely in the back. By her chosen desire of clothing, she appeared to be a pure fetishist, even perhaps a dominatrix, and that would be a fair guess. She looked and was shaped young, not in need of the corset she wore anyways. In her face she expressed power and coldness found in the darkest of bitches in the world. However, like the car that appeared to be a Cadillac, looks were deceiving.

The car pulled into the driveway of a two story home with plenty of yard but had no children&#8217;s toys in it: the owners, young, had no children yet, but that was not the purpose of the visit. The driver, a very tall blonde woman in a slick, crisp vinyl chauffeur&#8217;s uniform, stepped out and opened the rear passenger door, and offered her gloved hand. Her boss placed her own glove hand into hers and once getting her dick-skewering heels down on the pavement under her she was helped out of the car. The style of her clothing became more pronounced, a rather Victorian-design to it on the outside save there was no powdered wig and powdered face: combinations of leather, rubber, vinyl, and latex; intricately layered in unique ways with their own purposes.

For now, she sighed contently and said to the driver, �Bother, this brings back some memories, Hershel.�

That was not her real name, but the driver was not paid to have a real name. The woman called &#8216;Hershel&#8217; said, �Then why bother with it, Mistress, if you don&#8217;t mind me asking.�

�I&#8217;m bored,� said the Mistress lazily. �Like I explained to everyone at the club what is the point to my life style? Self-gratification, certainly: we are creatures of access and excess. Yet my pussy does not drip as it did before. I feel no satisfaction in what I have been doing for more than thirty years, not like it was. But when I helped those &#8216;new borns&#8217; at the club, the excitement came back.�

�Breaking the cherry of two college girls at the same time is the fountain of youth for anyone,� mused Hershel. �The others just hated you for pulling that one off.�

�It was not just that.� She waved her hand and said, �I know it. I just have to do this to confirm it.�

�I know, Mistress.� The Mistress offered her hand to the driver, and Hershel kissed it. Hershel said, �Call me on the cell when you are done.�

�Thank you, dearest Hershel.� 

The driver got in the car and pulled away; the Mistress walked up to the door. And that walk was thrilling for her; she felt like that nineteen year old little girl she was once that could not string two sentences together to ask a prominent Goddess to show her just a little of the life style she fully lived now. That other life was an experience all its own, filled with its own heartaches and climaxes; she had to live it for a few years, not just a few weeks or months like others had, to become the dominatrix she was, both renowned and respected in tight, exclusive circles; thus why she lived a life of privilege and rewards. She knocked on the door, and the review of her life ceased. When the door began to open she became who she was and will always be.

The door opened fully, and in the light was a pretty young woman in a silk robe that barely covered her. Once she noted the guest, she lowered her head and said, �Yes.�

�I am Mistress Dominique MonChere,� said the attractive, middle age woman. �You have been expecting me. And child� and here, her voice was strong to make the woman, who was clearly being submissive, to look up �I am not your mistress, so if you could please just invite me in so we can become friends and deal with why I am here.�

�Sure,� said the female, and she smiled and let Mistress Dominique in. Under the full light of entryway, the female was more visible for inspection: her silk covered her naked body, but not her leather collar and appendage bracelets. �I am Kathy.�

�Katherine,� said Mistress Dominique, letting a smile touch her face. �So far it is nice to meet you. Your house looks lovely. And where is your husband.�

�He&#8217;s coming�.or rather he&#8217;s COMING, you know,� she blushed and nervously chuckled through her response, �He&#8217;s upstairs. Oh, here he comes.� She bowed her head, as all good slave girls do in the presence of their Master. Mistress Dominique measured the young woman, noting things such as her kindness and obedience, even when not in a Scene.

�Master, I present to you Mistress Dominique MonChere,� said Kathy.

The man smiled, sporting black work pants and a black &#8216;wife beater&#8217; shirt, and dark hair. He took up Mistress Dominique&#8217;s hand, kissed the back of it, and said, �Thank you for coming, Mistress. I am Paul.�

�Thank you for inviting me, Paul,� said Mistress Dominique. �As I mentioned to your wife, your house is lovely.� She noted him, and his wife, and then him again and said, �Master Paul, if you would be so kind, would you let your slave out of the hold of bondage. I would like to engage you both as a regular couple.�

�Oh?� Paul looked confused. �Oh, okay. Honey, you can stop.� Like magic, Kathy was no longer too quiet and too submissive�.at least to the untrained eye. He gave her a one arm hug and kiss. �I had thought�.maybe�.�

�That I would come in here and in a marvelous display of clich�s instantly beat the problem you two have with my whip?� Mistress Dominique smirked, which barely betrayed her wrinkles. She held up her gloved hands and noted, �I have no whip.�

The couple laughed with her, and after getting the gist they showed their guest to the living room. It was quite large, not out of the norms; having someone like Mistress Dominique in it, however, did not throw the look off as the owners of the home did. Mistress Dominique gave them both a presentation of eloquence and sophistication, and they were not wrong in assuming that, only that she would be the first to correct them that she was born this way, and quite frankly she would be happy eating hotdogs with the works on it in Chicago than some fancy feast in Paris.

Taking the offered chair, Mistress Dominique waited for the two to seat themselves across from her. Paul had to ask, �Was it�.wrong then for us to dress up?�

�Oh no: who am I to say what you should wear in your own home,� Mistress Dominique clarified. �It is a convenience for what we may do later, it does save time.� She looked to Kathy. �Are you comfortable, my dear?�

�I have to admit, I never showed off like this to anyone,� said Kathy, playing with frail silk and her leather bands. �Someone like you must think it&#8217;s silly.�

�We cannot all be exhibitionists,� noted Mistress Dominique. �And I am not afraid to say some of us should not be. The convention that we in the alternative life style are all &#8216;open&#8217; is a myth, and I will not live by it: it is hypocrisy, and I am not a hypocrite. To live by &#8216;to each their own&#8217; is a lie more treacherous than adultery.� She smiled and noted, �But I am not here to give a sermon. I am here because you have answered my challenge on Baron Graves&#8217; blog.�

�About that, if you don&#8217;t mind me asking,� began Kathy meekly; Mistress Dominique noted that. �I kind of understand what you said in the blog entry, but I don&#8217;t get all of the context.�

�I don&#8217;t quite either,� said Paul. �It&#8217;s probably why are response stood out from all the others, huh.�

�Indeed: everyone else thought I was offering my services in the &#8216;traditional&#8217; sense of bondage and discipline,� said Mistress Dominique. �Contrary to what you have seen of me and heard of me, I am not a mistress of words. Allow me, given how you greeted me in the beginning, what I am trying to do here.�

Mistress Dominique pushed herself towards them, leaning forward in her chair, and said, �I had an epiphany a few weeks ago: if I found no meaning in this, I was going to leave BDSM for good. Having lived this life I have for so long it is worse than quitting smoking, and I ought to know I quit smoking easily. That epiphany came in the form of a conquest I had. Being a lesbian dominatrix, I had the pleasure of enslaving these two curious females who had never lost their virginity, and had wondered what the &#8216;hype&#8217; was all about with sex, S and M, girl on girl, and all that. Well, I showed them, and since I was the one who was going to collect their virginity I did not charge them.

�Needless to say, I had a workout: these were virgins after all, but never in all my years have I ever met inept females. I had originally only planned a few hours with them, but I convinced them to stay a whole weekend so I could show them everything they were doing wrong. They had kissed boys before, been touched, but even children could have better skills than these two. Before this, I was growing dull of what I was doing; after this, I was elated again with the whole life style.

�Now what gets lost in the fog of words is what I did. It was not just doing what I usually do best; it was getting to the heart of the problem by feeling out what it is, what the causes of it were. See, I grew bored with expectation: everyone comes in, I tie them up, they lick my shoe, I beat their ass blue: suck, fuck, repeat, and piss in their mouth. The funny thing is I know this like I know my slaves, but what I was seeing in others was a ho-hum approach to everything. Gay man comes in, there is an expectation that he wants something gay man related in sexual context. Well, suppose that is not the case: suppose that is the day he wants to actually fuck a woman?�

Mistress Dominique put her hands together and implored, �I know that is not the best example, but the other day I read that in a gay friend of mine. He honestly wanted to fuck me, a straight fuck, a basic screw. But he did not know how to ask, which was a reflection of inability to do it. I never took him up on his offer, but it reminded me of two-virgin conquest, of their inability to do anything right. So, I decided, that is what I want to do. I have seen it all, and I have just about done it all. Instead of being the one that drives the horse &#8211; and I am not talking pony play here &#8211; I want to be the one that instructs the driver to drive the horse, but after I assess their ability to drive. I want to be a teacher of bondage and all, but�.my approach will not be so hands on.�

She made a poor face and asked, �Does it make sense to you?�

Paul and Kathy shared a look, and Paul said, �So what you do is, I think, you don&#8217;t participate, but you tell us what to do? You&#8217;re there, but you&#8217;re not?�

�I know, strange: it&#8217;s like being a peeping tom and offering whoever you are peeping tips to make your peeping easier and more fun,� said Mistress Dominique. �See, everyone else did not get that: they just assume I want to set up a Scene. It is not that at all. What I want to do is analyze a problem in alt relationships. Your private response to me was the one that stood out from the others, the very example I was looking for.� She held up a finger and said, �Perhaps it will make sense to not just, but to me too, if you explain what is going on again.�

Mistress Dominique raised a finger on each hand and interjected quickly, �However, let me make some things clear. First, I am not a shrink. I can give good advice like the next person, and my area of expertise is based on years of experience with many people, but it is not perfect. If you have a pre-existing physical or psychological condition, then I cannot help you. Secondly, after you have told me your confidences, and if I decide I can help you, you must do everything I say. You must obey me. You must do so without question. Failure to comply ends our session, and you will never see me again. Is that understood?� The couple nodded together. �For now, you are just Kathy and Paul to me, but that will change. Let us begin.�

Kathy looked to Paul, and of course Paul took the lead. �Well, we were into dominance and submission the moment we met. She&#8217;s always been the bottom, prefers it really.�

�Most straight, non-curious women do,� stressed Mistress Dominique.

�I have always had this fantasy about a subservient slut, and Kathy has always, always been game.�

�Yes, I love it,� said Kathy with a smile. �It&#8217;s been wonderful�but lately�..�

�It is alright, Kathy, go ahead,� stressed Mistress Dominique, �We will not get to the problem if the both of you do not discuss it.�

Sighing, Kathy said, �I get wet thinking about being his slut. I do. But there&#8217;s been times my body just�.just shuts down. It does it right in the middle of the action. I&#8217;m not quite sure why because I love what he does to me. He loves me, I know it, and we love doing this, however he knows when I stop being in the mood.�

�It is not one thing either,� said Paul, his face flashing embarrassment. �Last night I rolled over for a &#8216;fuck snack&#8217; and her pussy was drier than a riverbed in Death Valley. No matter what I did, nothing happened. I went to lubricant, but all that did was get me going. I couldn&#8217;t find her clit anywhere.� He shook his head. �I don&#8217;t want to be the only one getting any satisfaction out of this.�

�A couple of weeks ago, he stopped cumming too,� noted Kathy, her face flushed. �I think he fucked me for an hour, and I was just so unresponsive. I love him too much just to say we don&#8217;t feel anything for each other, but�.like he said, we shouldn&#8217;t deny ourselves our respected satisfactions.�

�Unless you are playing orgasm denial, no,� said Mistress Dominique. She thought for a few moments and asked, �And you have played games since you have met?�

�Yes,� said Paul. �Does that have anything to do with it?�

�I will not say either way,� said Mistress Dominique. She eyeballed them further, thinking what was said, comparing it to the couple collectively. She felt something, and so acted on it. �What I want you to do, right now, is get in a Scene for me. I want to watch what is typical for the both of you as master and slave. It does not matter, really, where it starts, or what you do, but I stress the most basic, the better.�

Paul nodded, but Kathy said, �I�.never done it in front of others before.�

�I know it is difficult,� said Mistress Dominique. �But it must be done, Katherine. I will not be participating until I say something. Assume I have no authority until then; think of only your master, your husband.� She sat back in the chair, crossed her legs, and folded her arms. She commanded, whether they were ready or not, �Anytime, Master Paul.�

Paul had an idea, and he too sat back on the couch. He said, �Slut, disrobe!�

�Yes Master.� Nervously at first, Kathy removed her robe; a young healthy body was revealed with a naval piercing. The lesbian dominatrix eyed her body, but said nothing; her crotch, on the other hand, began to moisten under the latex panties.

�Turn around, face me on your knees,� instructed Paul.

�Yes Master.� Kathy did as she was told. Paul expected Mistress Dominique to be looking at his wife&#8217;s ass, but instead she was staring at couple intently.

Moving forward from his seat, Paul played with Kathy&#8217;s mouth with his fingers, toying with her lips, teasing her with the promise of having her suck them. He mused, �So, are you still my willing slut?�

�Yes Master.�

�Say it, then.�

�Oh Master, I am still your willing slut.�

�Let&#8217;s see you prove it.� Paul began to undo his pants. The belt was undone. The button soon follow. The noise of the zipper was enough to cause his dick to jump. With no underwear on, it came out slowly, growing in anticipation. �You are a cock whore, after all, what are you waiting for an invitation!�

Kathy obediently bent forward, putting both hands on the base of his cock, and slowly began to mouth the tip. The movement caused her to move forward, which drew Mistress Dominique&#8217;s head down to the back of her legs. Paul saw this as the Mistress admiring his wife&#8217;s tight holes, and so his cock got a bit larger than usually expected. His hands drifted right to Kathy&#8217;s head and he began to make her give him head. Her lips responded, wrapping around his swollen shaft, teasing the blood vessels just under the skin, mindful not to use her teeth until he told her to. He progressed, tugging at her hair, forcing her downward, and she complied with eager noises and very audible sucking.

After a time, Mistress Dominique said, �Stop!� Kathy did, but Paul felt a bit cheated and pulled her down on last time on his cock. �Stop!� He did on her second request, and he let Kathy remove her mouth. �Slave, crawl over here.�

�Yes Mistress,� said Kathy, just remembering what was agreed to in the beginning. She crawled on all fours and sat on her knees, head bowed, awaiting instruction.

In a kind voice, Mistress Dominique gently said, �Lay her head against my leg. That&#8217;s it, good girl.� Kathy did, and the Dominatrix proceeded to caress her head. �Master Paul, would you take a look at the time. No, leave your cock out.�

Paul was about to button up his pants when the order had stopped him. As he agreed he complied with the order and looked at the clock hanging on the wall. Mistress Dominique pointed out as she caressed Kathy&#8217;s head, �Your dick is limp, and she had been sucking continuously for fifteen minutes. Do you know when you started having trouble responding?�

�I couldn&#8217;t tell you,� admitted Paul.

�Well, that&#8217;s typical of any dominate,� said Mistress Dominique. She rubbed the back of Kathy&#8217;s neck affectionately with her right hand. �As we know to apply the term SubSpace to a submissive who loses themselves in the action, a dominate falls into the action themselves. There is no term for it because in a perfect world a dominate never loses control. The worst of dominates do, becoming too hell bent on literally breaking someone, no longer content for example with reddening an ass with a crop they go so far as to break the skin to achieve their satisfaction. They do not realize it because once they lose control like that, for even a second, it is too late. So how does Subspace, or in this case DomSpace, happen? It is one in the same answer: to lose control in order to achieve missing satisfaction.�

Mistress Dominique ordered Kathy, �Slave, go have a drink of water, and then come right back here and sit by my legs.�

�Yes Mistress,� said Kathy.

�Good girl,� affirmed Mistress Dominique. She continued as the Slave left, �We all have that issue, loss of control, from time to time, it happens. We have to realize, though, to correct it. The best authority on that is our slaves. Remember, Master Paul, that even if you had my experience, in play we can only do what our slaves allow us to do in order for the both of us to achieve satisfaction. That relies on constant and good communication.�

�We talk about it,� said Paul empathically. �A lot.�

�But are you speaking the right language, or better yet translating the proper language.� Mistress Dominique watched Kathy return. Kathy sat by her legs, and once again her head was rubbed. �Good girl. Now, what I am saying is this, Master Paul, and Slave Kathy, is that we have the verbal language, and then there is body language. Like any two different languages neither really is in line. There are differences between American English and what is spoken in England. Between the both of you: you speak English, but your bodies speak�.I don&#8217;t know, say that what I saw your bodies are speaking Russian, and soon will be speaking the Christ language of Aramaic. Do any of you know how to speak Russian?�

They both looked at her and shook their heads. Mistress Dominique said, �We do not know how to speak other languages, but in situations where we do not we read the body language. In absence of our ability to put anything into words, we use action. The both of you expressed more than you may ever think you know through your body language, even before the Scene was played out. Let us start with the particulars: the both of you have an acceptable relationship with one another, a good one, an established one. The both of you know what you want, at least in mind, and have accepted your roles.�

Mistress Dominique lifted Kathy&#8217;s head up by the chin to make her look at her. She smiled at the Slave, and Kathy smiled back. The Mistress said, �Master Paul, you have a very willing wife here. She is the perfect submissive, obedient to your established whims, she plays her role well in both your regular life and in your sex life. Some obedient slaves show some reluctance, and for example they do so when it comes to sucking cock. Not her: Katherine is who any man would want in a woman much less a slave woman when it comes to their prick. She swallowed your manhood like a famished dog on a treat.

�I watched, though, things that altered that dynamic from the both of you. First off, Kathy is a willing submissive, not a reluctant. She is more than willing to do as you ask because it does make her wet. It makes her wet just thinking about it.� She rubbed the back of Kathy&#8217;s neck again; the female was becoming very used to the touch now. �But you are not affirming her willingness, which in turn does not validate her existence not just as a slave, but as your wife. It is a form of complacency: you have this expectation of her that she will do as you command. In mind she will do it; her body just will not respond the same way to it. It becomes a chore for her, no fun at all. She puts this vibe out, and it has an affect on you just as it does on her. She is not a bad slave: do not treat her like one. This is not a fantasy where you have to force her to do it, she does it.

�The bad vibe is infectious and it spreads to you. It affects her performance as a slave, so you feel instinctively that she needs to be corrected. You do not say this: you do it through your actions.� Mistress Dominique grabbed Kathy by the back of her head by the hair and tugged her, forcing her look up at her. But she then caressed Kathy&#8217;s forehead. �So you grab her, and you force her to suck you. This changes the dynamic again: she is no longer sucking your cock, you are fucking her mouth, which she does not like. She can have her hands on you, she can be stroking the shaft, but in the end you are still making her do it with using your hands. If I had my strap on, I would demonstrate exactly what you were doing, which was wrong to do to such a willing and able cock slut. Have you ever been punished into your service?�

Kathy said, �No Mistress.�

Paul said, �If you mean scenarios where I spank her or clamp her nipples, no. Like you have said, she&#8217;s a very compliant slave. And I really don&#8217;t play it like that.�

Mistress Dominique got up, and she gently tugged at the ring on Kathy&#8217;s collar and ordered, �Come on.� She lead her back over to Paul, and then after ordering the Slave to sit she had the Master pat his Slave&#8217;s head. �A Master&#8217;s hand must be kind as it is cruel: in your case, far more kind than cruel. She reacts best when she achieves your affirmation. By your commands she does your bidding: that is her limits.�

�But what about pushing limits?� asked Paul, as he continued to stroke her head. �Isn&#8217;t that the point to bondage?�

�There is a myth that bondage is about going past &#8216;the norm&#8217;. Ask yourself, though, what is &#8216;the norm&#8217;? Some already are being fucked in the ass: to some that is not normal, to others it is. So what&#8217;s beyond that as &#8216;the norm&#8217;? We get the debate about that convoluted by what is normal and what is not, and if we seek it in that sense we get lost: we end up either not knowing what we want, or getting into areas of sexuality that are truly off limits. Slave Kathy enjoys pleasing you this way: that&#8217;s it for her. Does it mean she&#8217;s ready for a rape fantasy? My experience says absolutely not! So why, without talking about it, do a pseudo-version of it by making her do what she is already doing so well?�

Mistress Dominique could see she had Paul thinking. She reached down and patted Kathy on the head again to get her attention. �Going back to that lack of affirmation, it affects your performance and the way you carry on. In this example, because what he did, you &#8216;mailed in&#8217; your performance. Oh God, I always wanted to say &#8216;mailed in&#8217; ever since I heard it on ESPN!�

After the little laughter, Mistress Dominique just placed her hands on Paul&#8217;s cock. She explained, �I am about to betray the woman&#8217;s common trust to a man: she is cheating you!� She held up a hand, �Do not get angry with her unless she begins to do it again. I promise though she will not once we get some of the earlier issues out of the way. Slave, open your mouth.� Kathy did, and Mistress Dominique gripped Paul&#8217;s cock at the base. �Now throat his sword, and do not stop until you kiss my hand.�

It took Kathy a little time to think about that, but she slid her mouth over her husband&#8217;s dick and went down until her lips met the Dominatrix&#8217;s gloved hands. The hands were together, grabbing it as one would grab a pole to slide down.

�Good girl, stay right there and do nothing,� instructed the Mistress. �As you can see, Master Paul, she is only sucking two inches of meat at this point of your erection. When it gets bigger, she will slide one of her hands up, like this.� Mistress Dominique slid her left hand up; like a good girl, Kathy slid up to accommodate. At this time, Kathy was completely off his penis; the head barely poked through the latex glove holding it. �As you can see, it takes a couple of inches more.�

Paul eyed his wife and said ruefully, �You conniving slut.�

�Sorry, Master, I did not know,� said Kathy, honestly ashamed.

�She is right, she did not know.� Mistress Dominique let go of Paul&#8217;s cock and soothed Kathy. �Your bad vibes were transforming her into a reluctant. Remember, that is not her style, she is s a willing slave. Everything, you see, cascades: no affirmation becomes a turn off for Kathy. Kathy in turn goes through the paces, not even being turned on by what she is doing. You do not pick up on her cheating, but you do on her lack of effort in performance. Sometimes you cannot help to have an orgasm; other times all you have to show for it is a wet dick.�

Standing erect, Mistress Dominique concluded, �You cannot forget what works so well and you cannot force what does not work. You are not a forced orgasm guy, Paul, any more than Kathy is a reluctant player. You two are players, I will give you that, but you are not hard core, or hard for that matter. I am not saying you should stop, what I am saying is you should stick to what works, for you have defined your limits to one another already. Complacency is a problem, though. However, tweaks here and there can fix it and salvage a great bondage relationship.�

Sitting back down, Mistress Dominique looked to Kathy and asked, �Slave, do you have a leash and a means to bind those hands together? Good, go fetch them.� As Kathy left, she looked across the way. �Paul, I want you to button up your pants and stand up. For now on, unless you are licking her pussy, you stand up for blow jobs. This will be more for her benefit than it is for yours. Also, you keep your pants on; you will see why momentarily.�

�Okay,� said Paul as Kathy returned with a leash and leather straps that snapped on her leather cuffs.

�Master Paul,� began Mistress Dominique, �what do you say to your slave?�

�OH, good girl.� Paul was embarrassed, forgetting already to compliment his good slave for her good work. He put the leash on her.

�Now turn her around and fasten her wrist cuffs together,� instructed Mistress Dominique. She wondered, �How often do you use restraints?�

�When I lick and tickle her,� said Paul, snapping the straps to the D-rings in the cuffs on her wrists. �She&#8217;s a real squirm monster.�

�Good thinking. Anyways, we need to get her away from these bad habits she developed from the bad vibes we are trying to eliminate.� Mistress Dominique walked over, grabbed the leash, and gave it a kind tug. �Down on your knees, Slave, good girl.� She gave the leash to Paul once Kathy was on her knees. �As you can see, even with a willing slave, you can still use a leash and tug. It is all how you use it. You will find this is better than yanking her hair. Now��

Mistress Dominique got behind Kathy, her legs straddling around the Slave&#8217;s legs, and patted her head again with affection. She said, �Slave, if you want your Master&#8217;s cock, you are going to have to pull it out with your teeth. Just unzip his fly, and when he is ready he will present it to you, one way or another.�

Kathy licked her lips and bent towards Paul&#8217;s pants. It took her a few moments, for his pants had a small zipper that was tucked behind fabric. She got hold of it and tugged. While this was happening, Paul was getting an errection and Mistress Dominique was urging him to say something.

�That&#8217;s it, Slave, work on it! Show me you want to suck me! That&#8217;s it!� Paul noted Mistress Dominique&#8217;s approval. Kathy managed the zipper just about down when his penis came out and nearly poked her in the eye. On instinct, Kathy tried to use her hands to get the rest of the penis free, but she struggled against her bonds.

Mistress Dominique chuckled and mused, �Silly nilly.� She reached over and undone Paul&#8217;s pants the rest of the way. She said to Paul, �If you want your whole shaft sucked, then you must unbuckle totally. Drop your pants completely.� As he did that, she bent down and helped herself to Kathy&#8217;s unsuspecting crotch. She toyed with it just once, making the woman jump. She came up and showed a shiny, wet glove. �This is promising.� She pressed her hand towards Kathy&#8217;s mouth and said, �Clean please.� Kathy complied, sucking her juices off. �Good girl.�

With Paul naked now, deciding to shed his top, Mistress Dominique pointed out, �As you can clearly see, with her hands bound, she cannot trick you. From here, you may feed her your cock by guiding it to her mouth. Or, for now�.�

Getting the gist of it, Paul barked, �If you want my cock, Slave, use your mouth. That&#8217;s it, open up, maneuver��

Upon command, Kathy had wiggled forward and maneuvered her head, leading with her mouth, in order to dock with Paul&#8217;s growing erect penis. The effect was something else visually, as it appeared the cock had a mind of its own trying to find a hole to insert itself as she made her attempts at catching it. Her lips brushed the head of the penis, and she brushed it again until she made it by throwing her mouth open wider and using the inside of cheek to catch what she sought. Once she had captured it, she found herself working the dick over right away at a modest pace, sliding downward, and finding that her hands were not there to stop her.

�Keep your eyes open,� instructed Mistress Dominique. She put an authoritative finger under her chin and lifted her whole head slightly upward. �Look up at him. Do your best to look into his eyes. Acknowledge his authority, and his greatness, by doing what you are doing now.� She leaned closer and whispered. �Slowly. Slowly now. Ease further downward. To appreciate your station in this relationship, you must love the cock. Appreciate it with your lips; slurp here, that&#8217;s it, good girl. Be ready to use your tongue when he tells you. Do not be jealous of his cock; swallow it down. Deeper and deeper, let it slip past your wisdom teeth. Keep looking up at him, into his eyes. Show him how much you care about him by worshipping his so hard cock.�

Kathy did what she was told to do, moving in, moving deeper with each pass. Whenever Paul made a face, it made her push herself to satisfy him. Whenever he looked away, instead of negative feelings, her pussy began to drip. Paul, stuck in the throes of ecstasy, had to move sometimes to keep his knees from buckling and his eyes from crossing. The positive affect on him in mind and body translated right down to the very end of his rod, and she felt it, and it electrified her crotch. For the first time in weeks her nipples hurt like hell, begging for a sucking on, which drove her to increase her pace and go deeper on the shaft until she could not physically do it. That meant for her to keep trying, because she hoped that as soon as he came he would do something to her breasts as a bonus.

Mistress Dominique stepped past Kathy and stepped behind Paul. She pressed herself against his back, and she grabbed his wrists and made his lay his hands on Kathy&#8217;s head. She whispered gently, �Stroke her head. Compliment her. Do not force it. Keep your hips under your shoulders.�

�Ah God, ah, it&#8217;s impossible!� cried Paul.

�You are her Master!� spat Mistress Dominique, grabbing hold of his waist and showing she was ready to keep him from thrusting forward. �You are the strong one here! You are her sword and her shield! She worships you! You are her protection, her reason for existence! She looks up to you! And you have the audacity to want to sit as she sucks your cock?!? You are a man! And more importantly, you are HER man!�

She pressed her lips against Paul&#8217;s left ear and whispered, �She&#8217;s got a puddle of juice under her right now, soaking into your fine rug, because all she is doing is just gorging on your cock. That is a sign of happiness, of fulfillment, for women, for her.� She purred, �You&#8217;re making me wet, too, being a man today, standing here, being serviced by your Slave like this. It&#8217;s so fucking hot!�

When Paul grunted, Mistress Dominique grabbed his wrists and forced his hands on Kathy&#8217;s shoulders. She watched, happily, Kathy slow right down to the point where she tried to go all the way to base of the cock. She choked and backed off. After some sucking on his tip, she slid down again, closing her eyes this time. She squeezed, exhaled through her nose, and still came up short. As she backed off she had to take a breath; Paul&#8217;s cock did not go anywhere, throbbing all to hell.

Mistress Dominique said nothing as Paul grabbed the leash, gave it a kind tug, and as Kathy began working his dick again he placed his hands on her shoulders. Kathy was making noises as she worked it over and over, assuming in her mind that this was something delicious, something to savior, something to enjoy over and over again. And then it happened: her lips kissed the base of his pelvis, the first and last time she was able to do it. She retreated again, and she noted how big Paul&#8217;s cock really was at the moment; she had never imagined it could get so big!

Again, Paul tugged at the leash, and again Kathy complied. She started licking at first, then kissing the shaft randomly. It was driving Paul nuts, but he maintained his hand position and where he stood. He just knew, if he waited patiently, she would go back to sucking him, and when she did he would be spent; he was nearly ready to burst!

Kathy nuzzled the tip of his penis before she mouthed it. Instantly, Paul said, �FUCK! FUCK, I CAN&#8217;T! FUCKKKKKKKKKKK!� Knees buckling, hips flexing, and hands squeezing, Paul came in Kathy&#8217;s mouth. She did her best to hold it, but some of the pressure from the cumshot had hit the back of her mouth and made her cough. She did her best to use her mouth to catch the rest of it, and clean his dick.

�Good, now make her lay down!� ordered Mistress Dominique. �Quickly, Master, quickly! Reward her with a good tit suckling!�

Paul tugged on the leash, making Kathy lay on the carpeted floor. He was over her, and his mouth ravaged her left breast nipple. She buckled and moaned and screamed as he sucked one breast and pinched the other with his hand, but he went on rubbing them. On instinct, he stuck his penis between her breasts, and suddenly her breasts and face were hit by late-departing cumshots, the last remnants of the blow job. This caused her to shudder, and she had her climax.

For her part, Mistress Dominique had sat down as her own crotch was on fire and it made her knees weak. As she watched the couple pant and kiss, she realized she was right; this act of romance and hot fetish action, brought forth by her tweaks in it, was what she had been looking for. A part of her, a giant part of her, wanted to sneak in there and begin fucking Kathy. That small part of her instead reached for her cell phone within her clothing folds. She speed dialed a number and said, �Hershel, come.�

�Yes, Mistress: I can be there in five minutes,� said Hershel.

Putting her cell phone away, Mistress Dominique leaned in the chair and asked, �How was that?�

The couple laughed and Paul said, �Fantastic!�

�I knew it would be,� said Mistress Dominique. �What you two have is very natural, so there is no reason for either of you to force it. You know your limits, now. Stay within them, and you cannot go wrong. Maybe you will go deeper into bondage, maybe not. Again, do not force it. Baby steps, baby steps through and through.�

Standing up, Mistress Dominique sighed with content and assured, �Do not get up, fine people, it is time for me to go. I know the way out. You should go somewhere, and try the tweaks out on other sexual practices you both enjoy.�

�Do you have it in you, Master?� asked Kathy shyly.

�I don&#8217;t know,� said Paul.

Mistress Dominique narrowed her eyes and said, �Oh, he does. He just does not know yet. I can tell: all he needs is coaxing. A shame I have no whip.� She put her right index finger on her right brow and flicked her finger away from the brow in salute. �Kiss an angel with that mouth, Katherine. He will fuck you for a good, long hour.�

As the Mistress turned and walked away, Kathy remarked from her laid down position, �You&#8217;re just like that Caesar guy on cable that knows dogs. You just know, you know. A regular slave whisperer.�

Mistress Dominique turned, smiled, and said, �Catchy.� But she rolled her eyes and said, �Nah, too superhero.�

Upon her departure from the house, Mistress Dominique&#8217;s car arrived in the drive way, on time. Hershel stepped out, stood at attention by the rear door, and opened it. �Did it work?�

�Splendidly,� said Mistress Dominique. She stopped short of the door and purred, �Take us home, Hershel.� She then teased her driver&#8217;s chin with her gloved finger. �And when we get there, we shall have a &#8216;refresher&#8217; course on how you are to &#8216;kiss my ass&#8217;.�

As Mistress Dominique sat down in the car, Hershel let a wicked grin grace her face as she closed the door. She sung, �Oh yeah, she&#8217;s dripping hot for fucking.� And knowing those were great times ahead, Hershel got in the car, and drove home as fast as she could.
