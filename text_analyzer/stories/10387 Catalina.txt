Synopsis:  Catalina is a shy girl easily overwhelmed with life\'s choices. Until she meets someone who takes those choices away.






With a flip a switch, 4 bright florescent lights flickered to life, drowning out the single bulb that has been casting a weak light over the room. A girl in a cage set in the corner of the room turned her head away from the brightness. He walked over to the cage, there was no need for a lock. The girl crawled out, the stiffness in her movements evidence of the hours spent in the small cage. No words were spoken, she knew what was expected of her. On all fours, eyes downcast, she waited. Hooking a leash to a collar, he turned to lead her out of the basement. The cow bell attached to the collar the only noise heard and she crawled behind him, her heavy tits swaying back and forth, the elongated nipples almost brushing the floor.
He lead her up the stairs and into the kitchen. Dropping the leash in the middle of the room, she immediately stopped following and sat back on her heels. He pulled out a cake, �Happy fifth anniversary, pet!�. At being addressed, she looked up and smiled. He cut a slice of cake and placed it on a plate for himself, and then another slice into a bowl that he sat down before her. She buried her face in the bowl, her dark red hair pooling on the floor on either side of the bowl. As he watched her eat he began to drown hard. Setting his plate aside, he walked around behind her to admire the ass thrust up in the air. He could see that she was wet, her juices beginning to run down her thighs. Dropping his pants to his ankles, he knelt behind her. She shivered as he ran a finger between her wet lips, a bigger grin crossing his face. Lining up his cock, with one deep thrust he was buried in her cunt. For a few moments he enjoyed the warm tightness before he slow started sliding in and out. As he picked up speed, she began to let out moans that were half pleasure and half pain and the furious speed. Soon he was filling her cunt with his cum. He slid out and she quickly turned around to suck any remaining juices from his cock, ignoring the cum running down her thighs.
�You know, I think it is time that you shared your story�, he said as he picked up the leash and led her to his office...


My name is Catalina, and Master has asked me to share my story with you. I am not a great story teller, and I am not even sure this is a story that you wish to here, but I will do as I am requested. We met a little over five years ago. I was 19 at the time, in my third year of collage. Always a year younger than my classmates, I tended to be a quiet observer. I was not unhappy with life, but I found it to be overwhelming most of the time. So many things to do and see, that it was almost overwhelming for me. I had a great counselor who made sure I had the classes I needed for my degree and eased the anxiety there, but there was times that such small decisions such as what to wear or where to go for dinner caused me great stress. To avoid these issues I had created a very rigid routine that did not mesh well with the spontaneous life of my classmates. This has left me with a lot of alone time which did not bother me all that much. Dear reader, I don't tell you this to gain your sympathy, but to give you a glimpse of my life. As I said, I was not unhappy. I had a few close friends, my classes, my hobbies.
Thanks to scholarships, amazingly helpful parents, and a few loans, I did not have to work. This gave me a lot of free time between classes which was spent either in the library studying or out on the green working on my latest crocheting project. That Monday, it was late summer, cool enough as long as I was sitting in the shade. I was working on an afghan when a shadow fell across me. I looked up to see a handsome face smiling at me. �Mind if I join you? My name is Malcolm�.
I gestured that it was OK, and he sat down at the edge of my blanket. �Please, continue with your work.� he instructed more than asked. �I don't want to be a bother. You looked so peaceful, and I just wanted to sit with you and maybe see if some would come to me.�
I went back to my afghan, but I couldn't concentrate. I began to miss count or drop a stitch and would have to unravel part of a row to start over. After less than 10 minutes with him, he smiled and stood up. �I apologize for distracting you. I'll see you Wednesday�. With that, he walked off. I couldn't get him out of my head. It was hard to gauge, but I was sure he had to be at least 6'2. He was built strong, someone who either worked out a lot or did manual work for a living. Dark brown eyes, black hair that looked to be normally short but had not had a cut recently. I saw it all clearly whenever I closed my eyes.
After that, he became a regular part of my day three times a week. Mostly he would just sit and watch me crochet, but other times he would chat. I learned that he was 26 and owned his own construction business. He was doing well enough, but he was looking to expand. He felt that it would be a good idea to receive some education in business management to ensure that he succeeded. He had been returning to work after his morning classes when he had noticed that I was a regular presence sitting on a blanket, which he decided would be worth waiting a little bit before getting back.
I quickly grew to enjoy his company. I could tell he had a good-nature and was fair, someone people would enjoy working for. It was also evident that he was used to being the boss. He had the bearing of one used to giving instructions that were quickly followed.
Summer turned to fall before he asked me to spend a full Saturday with me. I agreed, my stomach instantly filled with butterflies. �I'll pick you up here at 8am. Oh, and wear a skirt�. I felt like I was on cloud nine. Rarely had I been on dates and not with someone of this caliber.
I dressed carefully Saturday morning, in a skirt of course. I had spent the night before scrounging the internet for fashionable ideas and digging through my closet. I finally decided on a deep maroon skirt that came just below my knees. A cream shirt that showed a bit of cleavage and hugged my curves. A half jacket that tied underneath my breast, which was less of a cover and more of a frame that made my D cup breast seem larger. Some chunky necklaces and brown suede boots that came up my calf and added a couple of inches to my 5'5 topped off the look. I was outside of my comfort zone, but decided to fake it until I made it.
I was at out usual meeting place 10 minutes before 8. I didn't have to wait long. It was an amazing day. First there was breakfast in a little off the road cafe, followed by a trip to an art museum. Next we picked up lunch for a deli and drove to the river to have a picnic. Next he took us to a parking lot just outside of the city before catching a cab downtown. We walked around site seeing and chatting. In all things he took the lead. From picking out where we ate to leading me through crowded sidewalks. I knew that if I had voiced dissent or concern he would have listened, but I was most comfortable letting someone else lead and I had no complaints.
Next was a play, and then we had a late dinner in a place that I was clearly undressed for. He didn't even let me look at the menu, but I am positive that the meal cost more than what I spent a week on groceries. It was divine. A steak so juicy that it seemed to melt in my mouth. A wine so delicious that I drank a little more than I should have. It was getting late, and the city shown in the dark with all the glow of all the lights as we left. Arms linked, I leaned my head against his arm as we walked down the street. I was tired, but didn't want this day to end.
I paid little attention to our direction, content in letting him lead as he had done all day, that I didn&#8217;t notice that we had left the crowded area of downtown. Not until he made a quick left and led me down a dark alley did I realize that we were alone. I trembled as I looked up into his dark eyes, my back pressed against a brick wall. He ran a finger down my jaw line as he leaned in for a kiss. A kiss that I willingly responded to.
Leaning close to my ear, he whispered, �If at any moment you are not 100% comfortable, let me know. I will stop as soon as you 'No',� he assured me. I nodded that I understood. He turned me around and I placed my hands on the wall. The touch of his finger running up my thigh made me shiver. I was nervous, my heart beating a thousand beats a minute it seemed, but I trusted him. I didn't say �No�, and it didn&#8217;t even cross my thoughts to say it.
He hooked his thumbs in my panties and pulled them down to my boots in one swift motion. I didn&#8217;t see his smile when he slide his finger between my lips and found me soaking wet. Pulling my hair aside with the other hand, he leaned against me and began kissing on my neck as he played with my clit. There was a little voice in my head telling me that this was madness; that it would be much safer to take this back to my apartment or to his house. I ignored the voice; I wanted this now, and I didn&#8217;t care that it was in a dark alley downtown.
I let out a whimper when he withdrew his finger, but it was quickly replaced with his cock. I pushed back against his hard cock, grinding it between my soaking slit. �Are you sure, my pet?� he whispered in my ear. �Please�, I managed to choke out. That was all he needed to hear before he buried his cock in me with one deep thrust. He covered my mouth with his hand to stifle the moan that I let out. �Quietly�. When I nodded, he removed his hand and moved it to my clit as he began to slide in and out of my sloppy wet cunt. I bit the back of my hand to silence the moans I so wanted to release as I felt my orgasm begin to build. Soon, my body is overcome by wave after wave of pleasure are my orgasm takes over my body, my cunt convulsing around his hard cock. He can't hold it anymore, and he begins to fill me with his hot cum.
We lean against the brick wall, catching our breaths for a moment before he pulls my panties back up. Linking arms once more, I let him lead me out of the alley, my legs wobbling. �Come on, let's get you home, my pet�.


The girl kneels on the floor, her head resting in her Master's lap as he gently strokes her hair. �Well done, my pet.� he tells her. �I will give it a once over in the morning, and then post it to a couple of sites. We will see what type of response it receives. For now, it is time for bed.� She drops to all fours and he picks up the leash and leads he back to the basement.
