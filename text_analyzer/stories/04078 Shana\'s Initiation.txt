Shana: 


I first met him when I
moved to Seattle. He was in my economics class my freshman
year of college, and I noticed him from the first day. I was completely
overwhelmed by the experience of starting a whole new life in Washington. The only reason I was there was
financial...I was simply offered a scholarship to the college that I could not
afford to refuse. He was sitting in the back of the classroom, simply observing
the comings and going of the students trickling into the classroom. His green
eyes seemed to briefly look me over, forget about me, and then go back to some
deep musing known only to himself. Taking a deep breath, I walked over to the
empty seat beside him. 
I attempted to be
cheerful and animated, &quot;Hey! I'm Shana. What�s
your name?&quot; 
He looked slightly
startled and bemused that I had clearly sought him out, but smiled as if he had
thought of some private joke, and said, &quot;Brian. I�m a Senior.
Nice to meet you. You a native of Seattle, or are you just going to school
here?&quot; 
Relieved that he didn't
seem to be irritated by my introduction, I smiled. &quot;I just got here last
week. Everything is going all right so far...I'm trying to adjust and meet
people. What about you?&quot; 
&quot;I'm a born and bred
Seattleite...&quot; He continued talking, but I wasn't concentrating on his
words. I stared at his lips, they were bottom heavy, and I wanted to lean over
and just take a bit of his lower lip. His mouth continued to form what I could
only assume were words, but how was I supposed to pay attention? He ran his fingers
through his hair, leaving behind mussed locks of black hair. I wanted to touch
the silkiness of his hair and smooth it down. 
&quot;....about
you?&quot; 
I blinked, startled out
of my reverie. &quot;What?&quot; I said, trying not to sound as if I had been
fantasizing about him. &quot;I'm sorry, I was spacing out for a minute.&quot; 
&quot;How about you?
Where are you from?&quot; He waved a hand in front of my face. &quot;You there?&quot; 
Well that was just
perfect...turns out his hands are just as appealing as his face. He had long,
smooth fingers. I knew the sayings about guys with long fingers, and wondered
if they were true. I could just imagine his cock being as graceful and inviting
as his hands. I wanted to put my hand down his pants, touching what was sure to
be a musky hardness. &quot;I'm from Florida. Boca Raton. Ever been there?&quot; 
&quot;I had a girlfriend
who lived there. I used to go visit her during breaks. She lived in Miami. Bitching heat
there.&quot; 
The word 'girlfriend'
snapped me back to reality and I started to remember that I was shy. &quot;Yeah. It gets hot there. Well, it was nice--&quot; 
The professor walked in
at that second. &quot;All right class. Please open your texts to page seven. I
assume you have read the introductions. So lets
continue on from where you stopped reading. The current state of American...&quot;

I opened my notebook and
glanced at Brian from the side of my eye. He was so beautiful, and I had an
overwhelming urge to sit on his lap and touch him everywhere. I wanted to kiss
him so hard our teeth would grind. I wanted his hands to splay across my back
and pull me tightly against him. His cock would stiffen and push against my
hip, just asking to be ground upon.&nbsp; I was getting wet imagining him
fucking me until I screamed. His vague aloofness only made him more appealing
and irresistible. I blushed at the thoughts I had been having about Brian, and
looked back at the professor attempting to concentrate. 
Unsurprisingly, I was
unable to comprehend what the professor was saying on account of the tingling
sensation in my pussy. I turned my head and attempted to give off a 'I'm just casually glancing around' look. At the exact
moment I turned, his eyes met mine, and he slowly lifted just the corners of
his mouth and gave me a half smirk, half smile. I suddenly became highly
interested in my notebook, and didn't have the nerve to look up for the next
fifty three minutes. For the next hour, I could feel my thong being soaked
through as I cooked up elaborate sexual fantasies in my head. My cunt steadily leaked juice and I squirmed uncomfortably in
my chair, knowing that there was nothing I could do about it. When class ended,
I practically ran out of the room, not knowing how to continue our conversation
with my whole body practically exploding. 


Brian: 


When I met the woman who
would change my life, I was completely unaware of it. People assume that when
they meet the person who will shape their future, bells would ring. Perhaps
fireworks would spontaneously combust, and a voice would say, &quot;That
one.&quot; The only fireworks going on were the ones of my brain synapses
wilding firing, and the blood rushing to my rapidly stiffening cock. 
I had noticed her from
the time she walked into the room. She seemed shy, but moved with a sensuality
I found appealing. Her hair flowed fluidly with the sway of her body, and the
auburn color seemed to sparkle and shimmer as the light bounced off of it. Her
softly rounded breasts shifted slightly as she surveyed the room, looking
intimidated and a little lost. I wondered what her breasts looked like freed of
her maroon shirt and bra. Maybe she had tiny pink nipples which begged to be
bitten and sucked on...I wanted to touch them, shape them, squeeze them until
she grimaced with pain...and then I wanted to suckle on them until she begged
me to fuck her. I wanted to shove my cock down her throat and feel her choking
on it. Jesus, I wanted her. Realizing that I was staring, I looked away, not
wanting to scare the shit out of her, (at least, not yet).&nbsp; I figured
everyone in the room could hear my thoughts, they were so intense. 
As she moved down the
classroom towards the back, I silently telegraphed commands. &quot;Sit here.
Sit here.&quot; 
Amazingly, she did. The
conversation that followed was a blur. All I remember is introducing myself,
and trying not to blurt out that I wanted to unzip my pants, place her face in
my lap, and tell her to suck. Now I had a name to attach to my fantasies...Shana. Her name suited her. She seemed a little naive, a
little insecure, and a hell of a lot sexy. Class started, and I continued
fantasizing about her. I wanted to flip up her frilly white skirt, yank down
her underwear, and smack the hell out of her ass until it turned a satisfying
red. I wanted her begging to have my cock inside of her, and then to hold her
afterwards and protect her from the world. 
All through class I
attempted to watch her without seeming to be some crazy stalker. It was easier
than I thought it would be, as she seemed to be staring at her notebook as if
attempting to bore holes through it with her eyes. Her occasional slight
shifting caught my attention as I slowly went insane with lust. 
When class ended I wanted
to talk to her again, maybe get a cup of coffee together, maybe fuck the hell
out of her...but I figured I was more likely to get the former. However, the
moment the professor ended the seminar, she quickly got out of her seat, and
half walked, half ran out of the classroom. 
I couldn't get up right
away... if I did, I would be sharing more about myself
than I wished with my fellow students. I sat at the desk for a few more minutes,
thinking about baseball stats and willing my hard-on to fade. 
That night, I went to my
apartment, which I shared with another guy, David. As I walked through the
door, I decided to inquire about my mystery girl. 
&quot;Hey, have you seen
a girl named Shana around? Freshman?
New?&quot; I asked. 
&quot;No clue, man. What
does she look like? he said, &quot;She hot?&quot; 
I whistled and nodded
affirmatively. &quot;C'mon, you must have seen her around. She's hard to miss. Auburn hair, hazel eyes, killer body, she's from
Florida, looks shy...&quot; 
&quot;Oh yeah! I saw her
at the registering booth! I wouldn't mind fucking that--&quot; Suddenly
noticing the predatory gleam in my eye, he came to a halting stop. &quot;I
mean...Uh...forget it. Brian, you've got it bad.&quot; 
Later that night, as I
was walking to the library, I saw her walking towards me. She seemed lost in
her own world, and didn't notice me until I planted myself in her path, causing
her to bump into me. Damn, her body felt good against mine, even for that split
second. Her soft breasts crushed against my chest as I grasped her arms to
steady her. As she caught her balance, her hair fell over her face, smelling
like fresh flowers and conjuring up vivid fantasies about her hair swirling
over my body...or flowing down her back as she kneeled--I caught myself and
forced my thoughts to a halting stop, before I embarrassed myself. 
&quot;Oh my God, I'm so
sorry. I wasn't watching... I'm so sorry,&quot; She continued stammering and
babbling nervously, &quot;I'm not usually such a klutz.&quot; Up close, her
eyes were fucking amazing. They were pure green in the middle, with a circle of
golden brown on the outside. 
&quot;Don't worry about
it.&quot; I smiled down at her. Suddenly realizing she was trying to step
backwards, I quickly let go, not wanting to frighten her. 
&quot;Where are you headed?&quot;
I inquired. &quot;You probably shouldn't be walking by yourself at night. Its a fairly safe campus, but you never know.&quot; I felt
protective towards her, she didn't strike me as particularly street-smart, and
I didn't want her coming across some drunken fraternity asshole who was looking for a good time. 
Cautious alarm suddenly
flashed in her eyes, as she took note of the situation. She was alone with me,
it was dark, and there was no one around. Shit, I hadn't meant to scare her,
only to give her advice. I took a step back and smiled reassuringly. 
She gave me a small
smile, briefly flashing white teeth and an adorable dimple. &quot;I'm trying to
get to the library, but I've been wandering a bit. I ended up at the science
lab. My sense of direction is terrible. Would you mind telling me where to
go?&quot; 
&quot;I'm going there
myself, just walk with me. I swear, I'm not your
friendly neighborhood rapist. I'm really going to the library. I've got books
and everything,&quot; I said, motioning to my book bag. &quot;You met me in class,
remember? I'm Brian.&quot; 


Shana: 


I smiled involuntarily at
the idea of forgetting who he was. I had been thinking about him all day, and
running into him almost gave me a heart attack. If only I was more like my
friends, maybe I�d boldly ask him to my bedroom, and then�well, I wasn�t quite
sure. I�d never initiated sex, and my shyness was kicking in. All right, so we
would never end up together, but he was sure as hell fun to look at! 
�Lead the way.�&nbsp; I
said. 
We walked to the library
and made small talk about the weather and our classes. As we reached the steps,
I assumed we would go our separate ways, and I inwardly sighed with regret. 
�Thanks so much for
walking me here.&nbsp; I really appreciate it.� 
He looked at me and said
in a teasing voice, �C�mon, Shana. Sit with me. I
won�t disturb you, will I?� 
Oh God, sitting with him
would do a lot more than disturb me! It just might kill me. �Oh, of course you
won�t disturb me.� 
He winked at me and said,
�Great. Lets go sit over there. Its
quieter.� He pointed to a corner of the library that was currently unoccupied.
Actually, most of the library seemed to be empty, I guess it was late to be
sitting and studying. After all, the library closed in an hour. 
As we headed towards the
table, he casually placed his hand on the small of my back, lightly guiding me.
The moment he placed the palm of his hand on my body, I started getting wet. I
stumbled slightly but recovered my balance before he did anything drastic, like
touch me anyplace else, which might have led to spontaneous combustion. 
We sat down at the table
and spread out our books. The chairs were armless, and we were sitting in such
close proximity that our thighs were an inch away from touching. 
We started our respective
studies. Or rather, he did, as I sat there dumbly looking at the papers in
front of me. He was too damn close. It was making me itchy, slightly irritated,
and turned on. He just took up so much damn space! If he would just move over a
little bit! I was convinced that he only wanted to be friends with me, which
made the whole situation more frustrating. 
As I started looking at
my papers and attempting the concentrate, Brian casually placed his hand on my
upper thigh and started rubbing. I stopped pretending to study and gaped at
him. 
He smiled at me and said,
�Relax. It will be fun. Don�t say anything, just look at me.� 
I continued to stare at
him, not quite sure what to do. His hand was slowly moving upwards, now
slipping under my skirt and touching me just below my panties. I shifted in my
seat, trying to get away, yet wanting more of his touch. 
He said sharply, �Don�t
move. Just stay still.� 
I froze, and kept in my
position. His hands slowly started rubbing the front of my panties, directly on
my pussy. I couldn�t look at him anymore, and dropped my eyes to the floor.
Spears of pleasure were shooting though me, but at the same time I was torn. I
didn�t even know his last name! I felt like such a slut, yet I couldn�t bring
myself to pull away and leave the library. 
�Spread your legs.� Brian
murmured. �If you don�t, I am going to stop.� 
I hesitated, and Brian
halted the magical movements of his fingers. I slowly spread my legs and
blushed. Brian�s lifted the side of my panties with his hand, and slid two
fingers into my gushing cunt hole. He slowly moved
his fingers in and out�excruciatingly slowly. My nipples instantly hardened
into sharp points, and a throbbing started to fill my body. I wanted him to
start finger fucking me, deep and hard. If only he would shove a few times into
me,&nbsp; I would most likely cum within a few
seconds. But how could I let this happen? It was practically rape, except I was
letting him.
�You like this, don�t
you?� Brian said. �Tell me that you love this. Say that you love my fingers
going deep into your hole. I�m filling you up in the library, and you are such
a slut that you are practically cumming on my
fingers.� 
�I don�t�I don�t
know.�&nbsp; Tears started to fill my eyes. �I can�t�� 
He stopped touching me
and withdrew his hand from my pussy. As he took out his fingers, my cunt made a popping sound, and I wanted to sink into the
floor. Brian merely patted the front of my thong, making heat gush into me once
more, and continued studying. I could hardly believe what was going on. I
couldn�t even gather up my things to rush out�rather I just pushed back my
chair, leaving my book bag behind me, and walked unsteadily out. 
When I got to the library
steps, I started randomly walking, as I was not quite sure which way to go to
get back to my apartment. Even if I got lost, it would be better than the
humiliation I suffered in the library with Brian. I had no idea what was going
on, and my mind was in chaos. 


Brian: 


Fingering Shana in the library had been almost the ultimate high. My
cock was so stiff, I could barely stand, and my entire body was urging me to
run after her, shove her into a wall, and fuck the shit out of her. But that
didn�t seem like a very good plan, seeing how she was rapidly walking away. She
was actually walking in the opposite direction of where she should be�seeing
how she was rapidly heading towards the Science Lab, once again. Carrying her
and my books, I followed her. Admittedly, I had fucked up. I hadn�t handled it
well. I had known I was taking a chance,&nbsp; but
couldn�t resist. It was like having two queens in poker. Not quite good enough,
but tempting enough to lose your head. Her momentary submissiveness had made me
want to push for more and more, but I knew she was na�ve, and fingering her in
the library had clearly pushed her too far. 
I caught up to her and
said, �Shana, wait!� 
She turned and looked at
me with a tear-stained face, and said, �What do you want? To humiliate me
more?� 
�Shit. No. I don�t mean
that at all. C�mon. Think about the way you felt while I was touching you.
Didn�t it feel good?� I held my breathe, fearing that
her answer would be an adamant �No!� 
��Yes.� She admitted in a
small voice. �But, I�m not used to things like that. I just�� 
�You want to take it more
slowly?� I inquired. 
�Yes. I just don�t feel
comfortable enough with you.� 
I knew she was submissive
at heart. There was no way she would have been so turned on in the library had
she not enjoyed the prospect of being forced to submit to my sexual desires.
Her juices had been coating my hand, and she had been practically whimpering
with delight. She just wasn�t able to admit it. 
I grabbed her and kissed
her. If this failed, I knew she would never go near me again. But hell,
sometimes bluffing was a good strategy. I ground my mouth against hers, feeling
her go slack with shock. As she opened her mouth to protest, I quickly shoved
my tongue into her warm mouth, probing the sweet depths of her. Suddenly, she
shoved her hands up and attempted to push me away. I grabbed her wrists and
placed them behind her back, holding them tight and not allowing her to
struggle. She slowly started to respond to my urgent kiss, and started pressing
into me, and tangling her tongue with mine. Her breasts leaned against my
chest, and I gripped both her wrists with one hand, and used my other hand to
squeeze her tits. They were luscious and ripe, just waiting to be bitten and
fondled. I squeezed one nipple hard, and her body tensed with pain. 
�Now Shana,
you like this, right?� I said. �I can tell, don�t even bother to lie. I bet you
are soaking wet right now and want me to fuck you. If you really want me to
stop, say my full name. Brian Mitchell.� 
Her large hazel eyes
stared up at me, practically begging me to shove her to her knees and suck me
off. �Let go of me, you asshole!� 
I grinned at her
infuriatingly. �No.� 
I took my free hand and
shoved it up her thighs, reaching the warmth of her cunt.
I teasingly massaged her dripping hole, and said, �So, Shana�do
you want it now? I know you do. You might as well admit it.� 
�All right,� she groaned.
�I want it!� 
�Step out of your thong.
I want to see your cunt begging my cock to ram into
it. Take off your panties, and lift your dress up to your neck. Do it now.� 
She looked up at me,
seeking warmth and reassurance, but I merely stared sternly at her. �Do it.�
She worked her thong down
to her ankles and stepped out of it. Looking at the ground, she worked her
dress up until her neck. I could see her bush, glistening with wetness, waiting
to be rubbed and fucked. Her thighs trembled as she awaited my next move. Her
tits stood proudly out of her chest, with tiny pink nipples thrust into points.

�Now take off your dress,
spread it on the floor, and kneel down on it. I want you to suck me off.� 
She wavered, and decided
to disobey orders. She dropped her dress down, covering herself, and stepped
back. 
�Now you�ve done it.� I
growled. I grabbed her and carefully dragged her to a bench. As she kicked and
struggled, I merely placed my hand over her mouth and placed her over my knees.

�WHAACK.� I brought my hand down over her sweet ass
before she had a chance to comprehend what our new position meant. With the
first stroke, she started crying and pathetically whimpering. 
�SMACK.� My hand was no longer over her mouth, and
I warned her that screaming would result in a worse punishment. I made sure she
had the option of saying the safe code, as I did not want this to be assault.
Rather fulfillment of a fantasy. �SLAP.� 
�WHAACK.� The palm of my hand stung her ass yet again. She
clenched up her cheeks and continued crying. I ran my fingers down the dark
cleft of her ass, until I reached her pussy. Liquid was dripping out,
reinforcing my certainty that she was enjoying this as much as I was. When I
reached her cunt hole, I held my hand still, as her
pussy tightened with the need to be filled. 
�Ah ah
ah�� I said mischievously. �Not until you are
punished for disobeying orders.� 
�Please, Brian.� She
sobbed pitifully. �Punish me in some other way. This hurts too much.� 
�Oh okay. I�m happy to
help you out. No more spanking.� I grinned, knowing that she had no idea what
was coming. Her body went limp in relief, thinking that anything was better
then the spanking. I lightly ran my fingers back up her ass, stopping somewhere
along the middle of her now burning cheeks. �Relax your ass,
I want to see your asshole!� I commanded. 
Her body bucked as she
realized what I was about to do. �No! No one has ever�� 
�WHAAP!� I brought my
hand down with all my might. She quickly unclenched her butt-cheeks and I
started worming my finger towards her asshole. �Now, take your hands and spread
your ass cheeks for me. I want you to display your asshole for me. Sluts love
obeying their Masters. You are a slut, and by showing me your asshole, I am
going to become your Master. Now do it.� I felt a wave of tenderness come over
me. She was so fucking pretty and vulnerable. If I wasn�t certain that she was
getting as much pleasure from this as I was, I would have stopped immediately. 
As she hesitated, I said,
�Don�t make me slap you again. You will not even be able to sit down tomorrow
if your disobedience continues�� I let the threat hang in mid-air. 
She slowly brought her
hands behind her back, and placed them on either side of her ass-cheeks. Taking
a deep breath, she started spreading them for me. Her tiny brownish pink
wrinkled hole peeped shyly into view. 
�Keep going,� I said. 
She continued to expose
her anus to me, until it winked open for me and began to open. I licked my
finger, and started to massage her tiny hole. It was tight as hell, and I could
tell that no one had ever played with her from the backdoor. There was no way a
cock or finger had ever shoved its way up her tight little anus. Just to make
sure, I started to quiz her. 
�Shana,
I need you to answer honestly. If I think you are lying, there will be
immediate punishment. Do you understand?� 
She nodded yes. �That�s
not good enough. Answer me. Remember, I am now your Master. You
will address me as such.� 
�Yes. I understand.� She said, still sniveling. 
I quickly jabbed my
finger an inch into her asshole, jolting her. �Yes, MASTER. I don�t think you
understand your new position. You always address me as Master or Sir. Now try
again.� 
�Yes, Sir.� 
�Have you ever had any
guy touch you in your anus?� 
�No, Master. I swear. You are the first.� 
�Good.� I rewarded her by lightly stroking her hair in approval.
�Now, relax. It will be less painful.� 
I started prodding my
finger deeper into her rectum, feeling the walls of her anus spasm tightly
around my finger. I moved my finger back and forth, meeting resistance, but
stretching her out. I jammed another finger into her, causing her to jerk her
body violently against me. 
�Don�t worry. This is all
I�m going to put up your asshole�for now. Just calm down.�
I soothed her. 
I used my thumb to start
stroking her pussy. By now, her juices were flowing onto my pants. I shoved two
fingers from my other hand up her fuck-hole, and she
hovered on the brink of orgasm. I rapidly massaged her clit, causing her to
rapidly orgasm into bliss. As she jerked against me, I brought my fingers in
and out of her two holes, making pain and pleasure meld into one indefinable
feeling. 
I sat there, breathing
heavily, wanting nothing more than to bend her over the bench, take out my
cock, and fuck her until she screamed. But I knew this wasn�t the time. If I
wanted our relationship to progress to a higher level, I needed to reassure and
praise her.&nbsp; This was a completely new experience for her, and I wanted
her to enjoy it, not fear it.
