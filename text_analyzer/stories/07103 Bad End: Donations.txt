 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was the only major sin Rachel Drum had ever committed, but she convinced herself long ago that it was justified.&nbsp;&nbsp; The collection bin was not just for the priests, after all, but for charity.&nbsp; There wasn&#8217;t the slightest thing wrong with pilfering the jar for school supplies for a poor, pious young woman such as herself.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;However, never underestimate the ability of a jealous and petty nineteen year-old to rationalize her actions.&nbsp; Those school supplies soon included new clothes, gas money for her car, or the occasional piece of jewelry. Her mother never asked any questions; she was too busy working in the wake of her husband&#8217;s death to keep up with the bills. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The priests and sisters of the church had no idea she was commandeering their supplies as her own.&nbsp; They probably didn&#8217;t even have a clue that any money was missing at all.&nbsp; All she did was pocket a few fives, a ten, or a twenty each week as it sat in the back office after mass.&nbsp; Her mother had always wanted her to volunteer at church, after all.&nbsp; After year of frequent petty theft, she no longer thought anything of it.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The sins of theft and the desire for objects that did not belong to her were the only sins that marred her soul.&nbsp; She continued with her life, and was, by all other measures, a perfect daughter and student.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;However, all debts must be paid eventually, and all sins must be punished.&nbsp; Though most are reserved for after death, some people can get punished here, in the world of the living.&nbsp; 

Rachel had no idea that her serene and peaceful life would soon transform into a living nightmare.


 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rachel Drum took one last look into the mirror.&nbsp; She wore green corduroy pants, a red turtleneck, and a small golden cross around her neck.&nbsp; Her orange pigtails hung past her neck, tight as ever.&nbsp; Convinced that everything was perfect, she hurried down the stairs, backpack slung across her right shoulder.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Bye Mom,� she said as she grabbed the sack lunch from the fridge.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�When do you think you&#8217;ll be back?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I dunno.&nbsp; I might stay at the library to get some studying done.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Just be careful, okay?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Don&#8217;t worry, Mom.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll be fine.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can&#8217;t baby me forever.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Just be home before dark, okay?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Fine, Mom,� she said only to appease her mother.&nbsp; There was no reason to be home by dark.&nbsp; She had a car, so there was nothing to be afraid of.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was sitting on a bench between lectures at the community college taking bites from the ham sandwich she had packed that morning before class.&nbsp; The campus was crowded, but she spoke to no one, too shy and socially awkward to approach even the other girls&#8217; she had attended the Catholic High School with.&nbsp; A tall man with short black hair sat on the bench beside her, but she did not pay much attention to him until he spoke.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I know your secret, Rachel.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She quickly turned her head to him.&nbsp; It was Keith Mavis, a local businessman that Rachel recognized from church events.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What are you talking about?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Keep looking forward.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She turned her head and stared straight ahead, focusing on nothing.

�Stealing from the church?&nbsp; I thought better of you.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her heart froze.&nbsp; How did he know?&nbsp; �I��

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Come to my house after class, unless you want me to tell everybody in town.&nbsp; Tell nobody about our encounter.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With those words, he stood and left Rachel to contemplate her options.&nbsp; She knew he was up to something, but she could think of nothing worse than having her secret exposed. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unfortunately, Keith could think of something worse, something much more so. Rachel continued her day, intent on visiting Keith the moment she was free, unaware of the life changing trap that was about to be sprung.




 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rachel drove straight to her blackmailer&#8217;s after class.&nbsp; His house was on the outskirts of town, into the woods where few cars traveled.&nbsp; She had only ever been there once before, for a brief meeting with a church group, but that was years ago when she was still in junior high.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The house was exactly as she remembered it from her childhood except for the decaying effects of time and weather.&nbsp; Paint peeled, weeds overgrew, and surrounding trees loomed dangerously close to walls and windows.&nbsp; It was the house of a man that had truly let everything go.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rachel felt a tinge of sadness when she realized the cause of such disarray.&nbsp; It must have been sparked by the death of Keith&#8217;s wife.&nbsp; Delores was a figurehead in the church community, and it was no surprise that his involvement had completely dissipated when she died.&nbsp; The nuns and pastors at church had remarked on his pitiable state, but without having seen the devastation of loss first hand, she was unable to create a true mental picture.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She parked her car in the middle of the dirt drive and ascended the stairs to the front door.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good, you&#8217;re here,� greeted Keith Mavis.&nbsp; He held the door open and ushered in the college girl.&nbsp; �Please, take a seat.&nbsp;&nbsp; We have a lot to discuss.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rachel took her seat on the plaid couch, a dusty relic of a decade past. �What do you want from me?� she demanded with forceful assertion.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I don&#8217;t know, what will you do to keep things under wraps?�&nbsp; He slouched down and spread his legs, accentuating his slide with a slight thrust of his pelvis.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She didn&#8217;t like what he insinuated.&nbsp; �Disgusting.�&nbsp; She stood and grabbed her purse, ready to leave, unwilling to sink to his perverted level.&nbsp; �They won&#8217;t even listen to you, anyways.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Wait!&nbsp; I have photos.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She froze in her tracks.&nbsp; Photos?&nbsp; There would be no rejecting such evidence.&nbsp; �I� I don&#8217;t believe you.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Come, let me show you.�&nbsp; He led her from the front room and led her down the hall.&nbsp;&nbsp; He opened the door, turned on the lights, and entered.&nbsp; �Come on, they are in here.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But what she saw in that room was not right.&nbsp; Despite being day, the room was dark, as if no light flowed in from the windows.&nbsp; She looked to the windows.&nbsp; Wooden boards peaked from the frame&#8217;s sides.&nbsp; A single bed rested in the corner.

�I have to go�� she said as she stumbled backwards. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I don&#8217;t think so!�&nbsp; He grabbed her with one arm around her neck and one around her waist and forced her to the ground.&nbsp; �We&#8217;re not done here yet!�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Let me go!�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Not until we come to an agreement. �

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rachel could already tell that the agreement would be far from favorable.&nbsp; She shook within his grasp and struggled to be free, but he forced her to his knees with one hand and undid his belt with the other, revealing a bulge beneath his solid blue boxers.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�All you have to do is this one little thing, and I&#8217;ll let your thievery disappear silently, forever.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She stared at the monstrous protrusion.&nbsp; Its tip soaked through the cloth.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I��

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Have you ever seen a cock before?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She gulped.&nbsp; �No��

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well, there&#8217;s a first time for everything.�&nbsp; He slipped his fingers behind the boxers&#8217; band and pulled them down to his thighs.&nbsp; His stiff cock sprang from its bounds and stared at Rachel.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It took only a single look to terrify her.&nbsp; Fantasies of sex had long filled her dreams, but she had no intentions of acting out on them.&nbsp; She tried to stand, but Keith held onto the sides of her head firmly.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It&#8217;s too late to back away, Rachel.&nbsp; Remember, I have photos of what you did.&nbsp; Can you imagine how grand it would be to get shamed and disgraced in front of the church?&nbsp; Hell, I&#8217;ll take out an ad in the bulletin with your picture.&nbsp; Nobody in the entire parish will ever trust you again.&nbsp; But, hey, I can&#8217;t blame them.&nbsp; You&#8217;re a thief, after all.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She looked up at him with absolute contempt, compelled to tell him to fuck off, that she was okay with being labeled a thief if it meant keeping her honor.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But she wasn&#8217;t.&nbsp; The perceptions of others mattered too much.&nbsp; She turned her head back down towards the stiff dick in front of her, then leaned forward and accepted it into her mouth.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was disgusting, tasting unlike anything else.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She closed her lips around it and slid back and forth, unsure of what the purpose of it was.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Keith sighed.&nbsp; �Wow.&nbsp; You&#8217;re terrible at this.�&nbsp; He grabbed her head tighter and guided it along his length, slowly but firmly.&nbsp; �Listen, there&#8217;s actually more to head than it seems.&nbsp; Lick your lips.&nbsp; Keep it lubricated.&nbsp; Create a seal.&nbsp; Suck.&nbsp; Use your tongue.&nbsp; Work the rest of the cock with your hands.&nbsp; It isn&#8217;t hard, just do it.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rachel knew she didn&#8217;t have a choice.&nbsp; As degrading as the perverts requests were, she thought that pleasing him would be the easiest route from his grasp.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was wrong.&nbsp; She sucked and licked at his disgusting, rock hard cock, but he did not free her head from his hands.&nbsp; He pulled her head down the length of his cock harder until its head poked against the back of her mouth.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Mmffff!� she screamed into his cock.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He panted heavily, the girl&#8217;s amateur skills still enough to bring him close to what he wanted.&nbsp; His cock jerked, each time shooting a blast of cum into the back of Rachel&#8217;s mouth and down into her stomach.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She wanted to scream for help and to cough up the vile spunk that filled her mouth, but his hands held her tight until his cock came to halt.&nbsp; �Suck it clean,� he commanded.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tears streamed down her cheeks and a whimper escaped her throat.&nbsp; She had just done the filthiest, most disgusting, sinful deed she had ever committed in her life.&nbsp; But, she knew that he still held the power, that he could reveal the photographs if she didn&#8217;t follow his every command.&nbsp; She took one last deep breath and swabbed the head of the penis with her tongue, fulfilling his command.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good, good,� he said as he let go of her head.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rachel Drum collapsed to her side, leaning her weight onto her right forearm.&nbsp; She cried freely now and gasped for air, all the while coughing up the translucent white material that filled mouth and throat.&nbsp; Spunk splashed against her tight red turtleneck and soaked into the old, smelly brown carpet.&nbsp; It was finally over.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Or so she thought.&nbsp; Keith glowered over his triumph with a smug grin before giving his next command.&nbsp; �Stand up.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But she ignored him, still coughing into her sleeve.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I said &#8216;Stand up&#8217;,�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rachel turned towards him and stared with pure hatred, her long orange pigtails trailing off past her shoulders.&nbsp; �No.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No!&nbsp; I did what you asked.&nbsp; I&#8217;m leaving.�&nbsp; She rose to her feet and walked for the closed door to the hallway.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Keith stepped in front of her path.&nbsp; �No?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She moved to avoid him, but he grabbed her shoulders.&nbsp; No matter how hard she tried to shake free, his grasp held.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�We&#8217;re not done here,� he scowled.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You said I could go!�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Keith laughed and pushed her back towards the bed.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m sorry, Rachel, but I&#8217;m not going to do that.&nbsp; Ever.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She knew immediately that he meant what he said.&nbsp; Despite their little game of blackmail, he was playing for keeps, and the very thought of being taken as his forever chilled Rachel Drum to the very core of her being.&nbsp; With newfound strength, she swung her feet off the bed and leaped to the side.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She thought she had made it beyond his grasp, just feet away from the door, but her head jerked back, her feet swung forward, and she collapsed into a heap on the floor.&nbsp; He had grabbed one the long red braids that had trailed behind her as she ran.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Ahhhh!� she screamed as he lifted her up and threw her back onto the bad.&nbsp; However, this time he straddled her, placing each of his knees on opposite sides of her abdomen, pinning her down.&nbsp; One by one, he grabbed her ankles and wrists and locked them into the thick black cuffs chained to each corner of the bedpost, his weight and strength easily overcoming hers.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Let me go!� she screamed, her roar shaking the walls.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You think I&#8217;m going to let a prize like you get away?&nbsp; Not a chance.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve spent far too long planning this to make it a catch-and-release.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His words stung deep into her soul.&nbsp; He planned on keeping her forever, the true horrors of which were beyond her comprehension.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her voice shook with fear.&nbsp; �You won&#8217;t get away with this!&nbsp; The police will catch you!�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I don&#8217;t think you understand your situation, Rachel.&nbsp; You came here of your own accord, and not a soul in the world knows that you&#8217;re here, except me.&nbsp; And that is way it shall remain.�&nbsp; He rifled through her purse and plucked out the car keys.&nbsp; �Perfect.&nbsp; Now I just have to hide your car.�&nbsp;&nbsp; He slipped out of the room and locked it behind him, leaving Rachel screaming in the dark.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No!�&nbsp; she yelled, louder and louder until her voice died.&nbsp;&nbsp; �No��&nbsp; What the man said was true.&nbsp; She had no recourse.&nbsp; She was so secretive in her desire to hide her lies that she had burned any possible bridges to salvation.&nbsp; The house was out in the woods, where not another soul could hear her scream.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He returned minutes later, a foolish grin spread across his face.&nbsp; �And it&#8217;s done.&nbsp; Parked in my garage.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217;ll disassemble it, piece by piece. Nobody will ever find it.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What are you going to do with me?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh, so much, Rachel.&nbsp; So much.�&nbsp;&nbsp; He sat on the side of the bed and placed his hand on her thigh.&nbsp; �Do you have any idea how long I&#8217;ve been waiting for this?&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217;ve had my eyes on you for lord knows how long.&nbsp; Every week, you showed up to church without fail, devoting your free time to the benefit of others.&nbsp; I followed you around, and you never noticed, not even all those days I stared in through the window as you took what did not belong to you.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rachel looked away, ashamed of her thieving and negligence.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I couldn&#8217;t believe my eyes, at first, but it soon dawned at me that you weren&#8217;t the perfect little Christian girl that you pretended to be.�&nbsp; He reached over and cupped Rachel&#8217;s left tit in his right hand.&nbsp; �Beneath your conservative clothing, pale skin, and kind demeanor rests a sinful human being just like everybody else.&nbsp;&nbsp; Were you ever really volunteering with pure intentions, or were did you do it because it made you feel superior?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She shirked his hand away from her body.&nbsp; �I am not like that,� she yelled.&nbsp; She drew in her legs closer to his chest to block his prying hands.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He only smiled in response.&nbsp; �Why do you continue to play hard to get, Rachel?&nbsp; It&#8217;s already over.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No!�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Accept it, Rachel!&nbsp; You&#8217;re mine to love and cherish for ever.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She continued to yell, hoping that somebody, anybody, would here her screams for help.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I sound proofed the room, just for you.&nbsp; Not like anybody ever comes out this way.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Let me go!� she bellowed, this time louder, longer, and more strained.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�� but that doesn&#8217;t mean I have to put up with you.�&nbsp; He brandished the scissors and brought it closer to her neck, pressing its steel against her flesh.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No� I� I promise, I&#8217;ll be quiet.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I can take precautions, if you won&#8217;t cooperate.&nbsp; Your skin is so pure and smooth.&nbsp; It would be a shame if it got nicked up by a careless blade, wouldn&#8217;t it?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A chill ran down her spine.&nbsp; It was his first outright threat to wound or maim her, and she believed he would actually do it.&nbsp; The community member she met years ago at church had grown unhinged since his wife&#8217;s death, the void in his life filled with obsession for a formerly unobtainable prize. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The blade slid beneath the hem of her corduroy pants.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Snip.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Snip.&nbsp; Snip.&nbsp; Snip.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The scissors worked up and down her legs, the cold blade pressing briefly against her screen with each cut.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her terror brought silence.&nbsp; Her body shivered lightly, scared of what may happen should his blade slip.&nbsp; She only closed her eyes and breathed as slowly as she could, until both her green pants and dark red shirt were shredded.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Better than I had ever imagined.�&nbsp; He looked down across her body.&nbsp; �It&#8217;s so smooth, and perfect.&nbsp; And such plain underwear, as if you never expected anyone else to ever see it.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was true.&nbsp; She had barely been on any dates, let alone been to second base with a guy.&nbsp; Her church did not allow for premarital sex, and it was a rule she intended to follow.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If only she had followed the rules against stealing, too.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His hands slid up and down her thighs, exploring her body.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You&#8217;re so perfect.&nbsp; So much nicer than Mary ever was.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her calm boiled away in an instance when his hands reached her breasts.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No! No, no, no!� She thrashed within her restraints and wailed uncontrollably.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Damnit, Rachel, I told you to quiet down!�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But her screams continued.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Fine. I didn&#8217;t want to have to do this.�&nbsp; He mounted her chest with legs on either side and brought the blade to her cheek.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She truly believed he was going to cut her, but was surprised when the blade passed her face.&nbsp; Just to the side of her left ear, she could hear a snip of the scissors.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He dangled his target just in front of her face.&nbsp; It was the foot-long pigtail she had grown and maintained for years.&nbsp; He held it for a brief moment for her recognition, folded it in half, and shoved it into her mouth.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Mmmmm?� she moaned.&nbsp; Her eyes fell onto the tied strands of orange hair that spilled from her mouth in a rudimentary gag.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I told you to be quiet.&nbsp; I rather liked your pigtails, too.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Fff!�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He paid her gagged words no heed and returned his attention to her young body.&nbsp; He playfully slipped his fingers above her bra and pulled down the cups just enough to reveal her pink and round areolas.&nbsp; His fingers twirled their tips, all the while as he grinned sadistically.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She shook her head back and forth, trying to shake loose the gag, but it was shoved in too far.&nbsp; Though his actions horrified her, the slight pleasure from his hands chilled her more.&nbsp; Is that what she was?&nbsp; A girl that got off on being sexually assaulted?

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The shame and guilt distracted her from Keith&#8217;s actions, and she didn&#8217;t notice as he backed away from her chest and crawled below her waist.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The palm of his hands landed right across her pussy.&nbsp; �Good, you&#8217;re ready.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh, o oh!�&nbsp; She was not ready.&nbsp; She would never be ready.&nbsp; Something horrible was about to happen, and she could think of nothing that could save her from that ultimate disgrace.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Two more snips of the scissors, and her panties unfolded. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It finally began.&nbsp; He grunted quietly as he pulled in and out, digging his hands into her thighs for leverage.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It hurt more than she had ever imagined possible.&nbsp; His cock probed at untouched depths without concern, poking her insides at erratic angles as their bodies thrashed together.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Unn!�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He grinned and panted, paying no heed to her muffled words or cries of pain.&nbsp; His attention rested solely with her flesh and its sensation against his cock.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Stop, stop, she tried to scream, but her words meant nothing. Everything about the assault hurt.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The grip of his hands against her legs and waist.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The chaffing of their skin as he pumped in and out.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The feeling of his long and thick cock inside her.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In her dreams, she imagined herself meeting a charming young man, getting married and raising a family, always fulfilling the lord&#8217;s wish copulate only for reproduction.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But now, on her back in a dark and smelly room, she knew those dreams would never come true.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His assault grew more violent.&nbsp; He rammed in harder and deeper, his hands pulling her body closer to him with each thrust.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She cried for help, but none came.&nbsp; From that soundproof room within Keith Mavis&#8217; isolated home, none could hear her screams.&nbsp; Not now, not ever. Her wails of pain were only for herself and her tormenter.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Ah, aaaaah�� he moaned as he neared the end. He took one last deep breath as he slid his cock out of her, then crawled up the bed and knelt besides her face

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cum splashed across her features in spurts, sticking to her lips and nose and draining slowly towards her eyes. Its warmth frightened her, for it felt nothing like anything that had ever touched her skin.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He left the room without speaking another word, his newfound victim still chained to the bed, cum across her face and the remnants of her left pigtail sticking from her mouth.





 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And that is how the life of Rachel Drum ended as she knew it.&nbsp; Without a trace of evidence linking her to her sadistic captor, there was not a thread for investigators to follow, no glimmer of hope for those in search of the missing woman.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How long has she been kept in that windowless room?&nbsp; Weeks?&nbsp; Months?&nbsp; Years?&nbsp; Without the seasons or sun to keep her bounded to reality, she slips away into a perpetual daze, only springing back when her master has use for her.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He reads her newspaper articles about the investigation, leaving out details that would allow her a reference point to her abduction.&nbsp; But� is that the right word?&nbsp; She entered his trap of her own volition, and agreed to his perverted demand to keep her evil deeds hidden.&nbsp; And, that is what he did.&nbsp; He accepted her body in exchange for his silence.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was unjust, unfair, and completely disproportionate to the sin she committed.&nbsp; But it was also preventable.&nbsp; There were countless ways that she could have done things differently, either by confessing her sins or not being a thief in the first place.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To this day, Rachel Drum lays in the darkness, waiting for a salvation that will never come.
