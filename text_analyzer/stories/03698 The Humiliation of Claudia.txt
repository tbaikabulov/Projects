1. Rajani 
I felt triumphant as I walked through the glass entry doors, buoyed by victory
  and smiled at Cherry, the receptionist. 
�Congratulations Ms Somerset,' Cherry called as I strode past. I gave a gracious
  wave, walked into the inner office as Maurice, the Managing Partner stepped
  from his office to greet me. 
�Claudia,' he smiled broadly, �congratulations.' 
He was immaculate in a three piece pin-striped suit and a white shirt that
  was so bright one almost had to squint against the light. His cologne was subtle
  and the tie was perfect so I knew his wife had selected it for him. 
Maurice pecked my cheek and I grinned. �Thank you.' 
�This is a fine way to begin the week. A superb piece of work, the client's
  happy and we make money � rather a lot of money! You're gaining a rather splendid
  reputation in the legal community.' 
�Thank you again. It was an interesting case.' 
�Congratulations, Claudia,' Ben called from his office and I waved to him. 
Ben looked so sexy with his suit coat off, shirt sleeves rolled up and a pencil
  behind his ear. Big strong hands and steel grey hair, perhaps I should
  give him a few signals? I haven't had a man for a while. 
�We've already had enquires from potential clients,' Maurice enthused. �You're
  going to be a busy girl. I've organised champagne in the conference room at
  five to celebrate. Well done.' 
Maurice walked off and I watched him talk to Mary, his secretary before vanishing
  into his office. 
One day , I thought, I'll have an office like that! 
�Congratulations Ms Somerset,' Tim said shyly as he walked by me. 
Tim was a young man who had joined the firm just six months ago and had fallen
  for Roberta, one of the secretaries. The office girls were agog with the office
  romance especially as Tim and Roberta were getting married in a few weeks time. 
�Thank you, Tim and all the best for the wedding.' 
Peter and Roger, the senior partners also congratulated me and several of
  the junior solicitors softly applauded me as I walked towards my office. 
I smiled at Louise, my secretary and slumped into my office chair, kicking
  my shoes off and rubbing my toes through the nylon of my hose. 
�Everyone's talking about it, Ms Somerset,' Louise said, grinning broadly, �everyone
  is so  proud.' 
�Thanks Louise,' I said, looking through the open door at the pink dress in
  clear plastic that was hanging on the wall behind her desk. Louise was one
  of Roberta's bridesmaids and there had been momentous discussions on the style
  and colour of the dresses. �Any messages?' 
She consulted her pad. �Solicitors from the Justice Department wanted a chat
  so I squeezed them in at four thirty. And Roberta wants to know if you're coming
  to the Girls night on Friday?' 
Being the only female Barrister had its disadvantages. The blokes all went
  to the Bachelor night and bonded, probably did deals while I was supposed to
  go with the secretaries and the girls from the typing pool to giggle at some
  overweight male stripper! �I think I'm busy,' I lied, �a family thing I can't
  get out of.' 
�Oh,' Louise said, looking disappointed, �that's a shame.' 
�I know,' I shrugged, �but families can be difficult�' 
�I know.' Louise rolled her eyes. �Poor thing.' 
She left and I began to massage the cramped toes of my left foot. The high
  heels were Italian, outrageously expensive, uncomfortable in the narrow toes
  and the stiletto heels were downright dangerous to walk in. 
I always insisted on wearing the best and being at the height of conservative
  fashion. It was costly but I always created a good impression in my designer
  skirts and jackets which showed off my figure in a restrained manner. I saw
  many a Judge's eyes pop a little when I walked into the courtroom. 
Of course, it didn't work on the female judges � Emily Wilkinson always scowled
  at me and made it all very difficult for me but, thankfully, female judges
  were few and far between. 
I spun my chair around as I continued to massage my toes and watched the drizzle
  run down the window glass. 
Although I knew I should be looking through files for tomorrows appointments,
  I resisted. I was mentally exhausted and I had one appointment in fifteen minutes
  and then a few celebratory champagnes. 
Funnily, the idea of the champagne didn't excite me and I dreamed of my soft
  and warm bed. I had worked all through the weekend and even though it was Monday,
  I was already exhausted. 
A tap on the door, I spun around in the chair and saw Louise in the doorway.
  'Your four thirty appointment is early; do you want�?' 
�Yes,' I said, slipping my shoes back on, �I'll see them now. Did you offer
  a tea or something?' 
Louise shook her head. �Didn't want anything.' 
I nodded, Louise stepped back and ushered a woman into my office. The woman
  was about my age but we could not be more different. I was blonde with fair
  skin and considered by many to be a statuesque beauty. She, on the other hand
  was dark � obviously Indian or of Indian descent � a little shorter but wore
  comfortable court shoes which made her appear shorter and was dressed in a
  plain charcoal business suit � knee length skirt, jacket and blouse. She peered
  at the world through black rimed sensible glasses which gave her a serious,
  almost bookish air. 
�Hello,' I said with a smile, �I'm Claudia Somerset. Please sit down.' I looked
  at her a little more closely. �Have we met?' 
She smiled thinly and nodded. �I'm Rajani Patel. I was assisting the Prosecutor
  in today's case. Congratulations on your win.' Rajani inspected me, her dark
  eyes appearing large through the glasses. 
I vaguely remembered some Indian woman seated at the Prosecution's bench and
  pasted another smile, trying to be the gracious victor. �Thank you, it was
  a difficult�' 
�Does it bother you that your client was guilty and yet you freed him on a
  technicality?' 
I blinked at her calm words. �The law is  technical and the court
  decided my client was innocent�' 
�Correction,' Patel said calmly, �the court said a mistake had been made in
  the Prosecutions case and some evidence was inadmissible. That does not mean
  your client was innocent.' 
�The result was appropriate,' I said coldly. �What is it, exactly ,
  that I can do for you, Ms Patel?' 
�It's more  what I can do for you. You might wish to shut the office
  door.' 
�Whatever for?' I said coolly, tapping my long finger nails on the top of
  the desk. 
�The matter I wish to raise with you is of a private nature. However,' she
  shrugged, �if you have no secrets from your secretary, I am happy to discuss
  the issue. Tell me, do you remember Tom Effingham?' 
�Tom? Yes,' I said slowly, �I dated him a few times�' 
�He was my  boyfriend until you sashayed in, wriggling your bottom,
  displaying your legs and bosom. Do you feel any qualms when you use your sexuality
  to seduce men and influence judges?' 
�I think,' I said icily, �it is time for you to leave�' 
�How long did you stay with Tom � two weeks? I was with him for almost six
  months until you decided you wanted him. He was devastated when you threw him
  aside and he ran away to Canada.' 
�I see no benefit in discussing this,' I said as I tried to remember how long
  I had dated Tom. Was it two weeks?  He became boring after a while
  and I tried to remember how I had broken it off. 
�You think you are so  successful,' Rajani calmly continued, �but
  it is always easier for an Anglo, especially one that looks like you and is
  happy to display her body. It is much more difficult for me � people whisper
  and call me Paki behind my back. Anglos cannot tell the difference between
  those from India or Pakistan � but I am still successful in my own way.' 
�I'm sure you are,' I said coldly, standing to indicate the meeting was over
  and gestured at the open door. �I'd like to say it's a pleasure meeting you
  but that would be a lie�' 
�And you are very good at lying, aren't you?' Rajani said blithely, opening
  the folder that had been resting on her lap. �I would rather like to discuss
  the matter of Colleen Stevenson.' 
Her words assaulted me and I felt as if I had been punched in the stomach. 
�Who?' I said weakly. 
Patel smiled at me impassively and those big dark eyes seemed to bore into
  me. �Are you sure you don't wish to shut the door, Claudia?' 
Mutely, I walked to the door and smiled nervously at Louise who was seated
  at her desk and obviously chatting on the telephone. �No calls, thank you,'
  I said shakily and shut the door. 
�I don't know what�' I tried to bluster as I sat behind my desk but Rajani
  smiled coldly. 
�We both know you do, Claudia.' 
I felt a flicker of fear at the way the woman was calmly treating me, the
  way she confidently used my name and her cold but condescending eyes � dark
  eyes that suddenly appeared to be a little predatory. 
�I�' I spluttered weakly but she ignored me, reading from the file. 
�Colleen Stevenson, born in Liverpool on the 15 th December�' She looked up
  and smiled. �When is your  birthday, Claudia?' 
�I'm guessing you already know it's December 15 th �' 
�How interesting; Colleen was a bit of a lass, wasn't she? I see she was arrested
  and convicted for possession of narcotics and suspicion of possessing narcotics
  for purpose of sale. And what's this? Convicted for soliciting; Colleen was
  a prostitute?' 
�Look�' 
�Very ingenious of you to change your name and your background so you could
  start again, have a clean slate, so to speak. Colleen Stevenson morphed into
  Claudia Somerset who sailed through University apparently and graduated with
  Honours. And then you're the youngest woman called to the Bar? Extraordinary
  - a script from Hollywood!' 
�I don't know what you're playing at�' 
�I'm not playing, Claudia,' she said mildly. �I have all the evidence here,'
  Rajani said, patting the folder, �and copies elsewhere. Lot's of lovely documents
  and photographs. The photographs from the police files are very grainy but
  it is plainly you. Time to confess, Claudia!' Rajani said evenly and I swallowed. �It
  was you wasn't it, Colleen ?' 
I stared at her calm dark eyes for a long moment and then looked down at my
  desk. 
�Yes,' I whispered, �it was me.' 
�You didn't answer my earlier question. Was Colleen a prostitute, Claudia?
  Were you  a prostitute?' Rajani smiled slightly. 
�No,' I protested, �I had a lot of money on me and the police thought I had
  more than the value of the drugs so they slapped me with prostitution�' 
�How thorough of them,' Rajani cut me off and smiled coldly. �We are rather
  old fashioned in this country, aren't we? A Barrister can not practice if he
  or she has been convicted of a felony. I imagine the glorious career of Claudia
  Somerset would implode if this information was made available to the Bar Association,
  the police and the media?' 
My stomach churned at her relentless words. 
�You would be disbarred immediately, sacked from this firm and probably charged
  with perjury for lying about your past in official documents of the court.
  I suppose a number of your clients would also be involved in mistrials as it
  could be claimed you weren't able to rightfully represent them. It would be
  a divine mess, wouldn't it?' 
I gritted my teeth and tried to outstare this calm dark women but she would
  not be deterred. 
�And then there would be the question of your degree. How did you graduate
  with Honours? Did you sleep with all  of your professors? Or was it
  just furtive blowjobs in the tutor rooms?' 
�What do you want?' I muttered. 
�Whatever I want,' Rajani said steadily as she closed the folder. 
�How much�' 
Rajani laughed as she stood up. 
�I don't want money, Claudia. That is so  short sighted of you. Here.'
  She dropped a card onto the desk. �This is my address. Be there at seven tonight.
  If you arrive at one minute past seven, I will distribute the evidence immediately.
  Believe me, in this age of electronic mass communication, I only have to press
  the send button once!' 
Jumping to my feet, I desperately asked, �I'll pay�' 
�Weren't you listening? I'm not here to blackmail you for money. I want something
  far more worthy.' 
�What?' I asked weakly. 
�You'll find out tonight. I'll leave the folder for you to look through but
  if I were you, I'd be very careful with it. It would be so  unfortunate
  if it fell into the wrong hands.' 
Rajani smiled and calmly opened the office door. �Is your firm celebrating
  your momentous victory?' she asked in a polite and somewhat conversational
  tone. Louise turned to look at us and smiled. 
�Yes,' I replied in a small voice. 
�Champagne all round, I expect. Enjoy it but don't linger. It would be simply
  awful for you to be late for your seven o'clock appointment.' 
Rajani stepped through the door, smiled at Louise and paused. �That is a lovely
  dress,' I heard her say, pointing at the bridesmaid's dress.' 
Stunned, I numbly groped my way back to my desk and collapsed into my seat. 
I thought it was all in the past! All gone and long forgotten! 
My fingers trembled as I opened the folder and winced as my younger self sneered
  back from the police photographs. Taking a deep breath, I tried to rehearse
  excuses, reasons, anything for when it all came out but knew there was no excuse. 
That Indian bitch was right!  I would be disbarred, my job would
  vanish, I could no longer afford my house, car � anything! And I would face
  public ridicule and, worse, prison! 
I sat there for sometime, staring at the photos, my mind racing with possibilities,
  searching for a way out but, I realised, there was no easy way out of this! 
�Excuse me, Ms Somerset,' Louise ventured, �but Maurice wants you in the conference
  room.' 
�All right,' I said slowly, sliding the folder into a drawer and carefully
  locking it. 
�Are you alright, Ms Somerset?' Louise asked, concerned. 
�Yes,' I said softly, feeling my forehead, my stomach doing somersaults, �I'm
  just worn out; it's been a terrible day.' 
Maurice gestured at me with a champagne glass, smiled and announced, �here
  she is � the scourge of the Police Prosecutor's Department!' 
Everyone burst into applause and I willed a smile to my lips, accepted a glass
  of champagne and accepted hugs, pats on the shoulder and small kisses as I
  walked through. 
�Well done,' Ben said with a smile and I looked into those twinkling blue
  eyes. �Quite an accomplishment.' 
�Thank you,' I said softly. 
He leaned closer and I could smell his cologne. �I'll have to keep an eye
  on you; you are a lady with exceptional talent.' 
An hour earlier and I would have lapped up the compliments, flirted with him
  and probably ended with him in my bed. Now, I was sick to the stomach and just
  wanted to get out of there; run away to my bed where I could feel safe and
  warm. 
You can never feel safe and warm again!  A cruel mental voice reminded
  me again of my situation and I felt my lips tremble. Don't cry , I
  warned myself, don't let on to anyone! Act � just like you've always done! 
�I heard you were fabulous, Ms Somerset,' Tim said, his face a little pink
  and I guessed he had a glass or two of wine or beer before I arrived. 
�Thank you, Tim,' I said as Roberta appeared, slipped her arm protectively
  through Tim's and smiled at me. 
Women are very protective when another female, especially one they perceive
  as predatory, appears near their man. The gloves are off, sweet smiles with
  firm, possessive grips and the poor men have no idea what's occurring right
  before their very eyes. 
�Roberta,' I said sweetly, even though my stomach was churning with the thought
  of the seven o'clock appointment, �everything in order for the big day?' 
�Yes, all under control. You can't come to the Girls night?' She feigned disappointment
  and I tried to appear vaguely distraught at the loss. Roberta was always the
  smart one. 
�I'm soo  disappointed,' I smiled falsely, �but I have a dreadful
  family function.' 
�Really? I always thought you were an orphan?' Roberta smiled brightly. There
  was the evidence that she was, indeed, the smart one in the typing pool, the
  one to watch and Tim was putty in her hands. 
�That's true, Roberta,' I said evenly, �but I still have distant family who
  seem to take an interest in me.' 
�How nice.' 
�Claudia!' Maurice appeared and steered me towards the male partners, �time
  to celebrate with the big boys!' 
He winked and I smiled weakly as he guided me towards Ben and the other senior
  partners, Peter and Roger were also there, holding glasses up in a mock salute
  and I suddenly thought how tiresome it all was. I had to get out; had to run
  as I had bigger problems. Suddenly, the great  celebration seemed
  fake and insincere and I didn't want to be there anymore. 
Excusing myself, I slipped into the ladies bathroom and stared at my reflection
  in the wall mirror. My mind was reeling and my stomach turned over and over. 
What was I going to do? That Indian bitch was going to reveal my past;
    it's over! Unless I persuade her not to! Money! What can I give her? What
    does she want? 
I managed to glide through the celebration and then feigning exhaustion, exited
  and almost ran to my car. As I settled into the leather seats, my stomach churned
  again at the thought I would have to give it and everything else up. 
Rajani lived in a middle class area in a small townhouse and I parked outside
  at five to seven. Taking a deep breath, I stepped from the car, locked it and
  clutching my handbag, walked up the stairs and rang the bell. 
I waited. Maybe she's not here; maybe she's already distributed the evidence ?
  I rang the bell again and this time I heard footsteps on the other side of
  the door. 
The door opened and Rajani smiled coldly at me. �You're a little early,' she
  said, �eager, are we?' 
Rajani turned and gestured for me to step inside and closed the door behind
  me. 
The townhouse was well furnished and I saw bookcases lined with many books
  against one wall of the living room, a comfortable sofa, classic coffee table
  and a fireplace. The fire crackled and I longed to stand in front of it in
  order to warm myself and to stop the trembling. It wouldn't help as I was shivering
  from fear, not cold. 
Rajani sat down and crossed her legs. A crystal wineglass half-filled with
  red wine stood on the end table and she studied me carefully. 
�Sit down, Claudia. And I might point out if you have any ideas of threatening
  me or inflicting violence, it would be a waste of time. If I am hurt in any
  way, the evidence will automatically distributed if I don't sign in within
  forty-eight hours. You'd better pray I'm not involved in an accident and confined
  to hospital.' 
I sat down and perched on the edge of the sofa, handbag in my lap. �What do
  you want?' I asked in a low voice. 
�Straight to the point,' Rajani said, sipping wine. �At least you're not offering
  money anymore.' She carefully placed the wineglass on the end table and stared
  at me through her glasses. �I don't like you Claudia,' she said evenly, �in
  fact, you represent everything I despise. I am going to punish and humiliate
  you�' 
�What?' I mean�' I stuttered. 
�Silence! I am going to punish and humiliate you,' Rajani repeated firmly, �and you  are
  going to help.' 
My mind spun and I gaped at her as she picked the wineglass up again. I noticed
  her hand trembled and guessed Rajani was also nervous. 
Why would she be nervous? 
�I've been watching you for sometime, watching as you wiggled your way through
  courtrooms and dazzling men to get what you want, stealing other women's boyfriends.
  I saw many a sweaty old judge ignore proper legal argument while trying to
  peer down your blouse.' 
�You've been watching for ome time?' I found myself asking. 
�Yes,' Rajani laughed dryly, �you didn't see me, of course as I tend to merge
  into the background � Anglos don't see Pakis!' Her tone was sharp and I shivered
  at the resentment in those words. �And of course, what you did with Tom!' 
�Tom was�' 
�Be quiet! Your behaviour made me very angry and I used my position to enquire
  into your background. Very naughty of me but I was a little cranky. On the
  surface, you looked very proper but I do have great attention to detail and,
  after a time, discovered the real story!' She replaced the wineglass. �Of course,
  that made me even angrier. I suppose your qualifications aren't even valid.' 
�That's not true,' I said hotly. �I worked hard at University�' 
�Very commendable of you but that is required at University. No, I want to
  punish you and humiliate you. Of course, if my carefully accumulated evidence
  is released, you will suffer public humiliation but I decided that wasn't enough.' 
My ears had pricked at the word if and I hopefully seized on it. Maybe
    she wasn't going to release the evidence if I play along. 
�I want to make you pay for all the awful things that have been said and done
  to me; for how hard I had to work while you have manipulated men with coquettishly
  displayed flesh. No,' she said calmly, although her fingers still trembled
  slightly, �I'm going to inflict private humiliations and it will always be
  your choice.' 
�Choice?' I croaked. What choice did I have? 
�Yes. I'm going to tell you the rules and I suggest you listen very carefully.
  Are you listening?' 
I nodded, heart pounding. 
�Rule number one � you will never lie to me. It will only be a matter of time
  before I discover your lie and I will immediately distribute the evidence of
  your misspent youth to a rather extensive list of interested parties, including
  the tabloids. Is that understood?' 
�Yes,' I said softly. 
�In case you think you can fool me, may I point out that I am an expert in
  discovering falsehoods and my reaction will be swift and absolutely merciless.' 
I swallowed, blinked at her dark eyes as she carefully watched me and knew
  she wouldn't hesitate to destroy me � perhaps she was even looking forward
  to it. 
�Rule number two - it will always be your  choice to do what I say.
  I will ask you to do some rather humiliating things and it will be your  choice
  as to whether you do them or not. If you choose to perform the tasks, that's
  all well and good but if you choose not to, I will accept your decision and
  simply distribute the information.' 
�That's blackmail!' 
�No,' Rajani said mildly, �I don't think so as it's hard to see what benefit
  I am receiving in this enterprise.' 
�That's semantics! There must be something you�' 
�Obviously, there is no monetary value, just the sheer enjoyment of watching
  someone I despise humiliate themself.' 
I stared at those dark unforgiving eyes. �What sort of things?' I finally
  asked in a low voice. 
�All in good time. Rule number three � when we are in public, you will treat
  me as a friend and I will do likewise; two colleagues in the legal profession
  who have become friends. You shall call me Rajani and I will call you, my soon
  to be best friend, Claudia. If you appear to be sulky, mischievous or rude,
  I will end the friendship through distributing the information. I'm sure you
  and I will be such good friends!' 
Miserably I stared at my shoes and waited as my stomach churned. She's
    mad , I thought wildly, really insane ! 
Rule number four � you are perfectly free to tell anyone about your situation
  including the police. Of course, the moment you do, I will�' 
��distribute the information!' I finished and she smiled. 
�Such a fast learner � perhaps you really  did do all that work in
  university.' 
I sat waiting as Rajani sipped her wine again. �Rule number five?' I asked
  after a moment. 
�There isn't one,' she smiled. �Do you understand the situation � completely
  understand?' 
I was in a fix and I knew it. 
What could I possibly do to escape her clutches? There was no doubt in
    my mind that she was ruthless and hated me. My life � my entire world � would
    be destroyed if that information was distributed. I would lose everything!
    I was poor once; I don't wish to be poor again! 
She had me and there was nothing I could do about it! 
�Yes,' I murmured sadly. 
�Are you sure?' 
�Yes.' 
�Excellent.' Rajani placed the wineglass down with a shaking hand. �I've always
  wanted to say this; your time starts now!' She smiled nervously and said, �let's
  have a demonstration. Take off your clothes.' 
I gaped at her, shocked as this was one element I had not considered! 
Rajani smiled wryly. �It appears you choose not to strip for me. The experiment
  didn't last so long after all.' 
�No! Wait!' 
Those dark eyes watched me through her glasses. �Wait?' she said coolly. �I
  think you have made the decision not to remove your clothes. Goodbye, Claudia,
  I will read about you in tomorrow's newspapers.' 
I quickly stood up, kicking my shoes off. �I'll do it�' 
�No, I think you've had your opportunity...' 
�Please�' 
�Unless you ask me to watch you take your clothes off.' 
Ask her? But�if I didn't�if I didn't� 
My face burned brightly and I felt hot and weak. �Please watch me take my
  clothes off, Rajani,' I murmured. 
�What a good idea,' she said sarcastically. �Completely naked,' she added
  in a calm voice and I slipped the jacket off. 
�That looks rather expensive,' Rajani said conversationally, �what designer?' 
�Valentino,' I said, pulling my blouse out of my skirt. 
What I am doing, my mind silently screamed, stripping in front of another
    woman! Is she a lez? Wait, didn't she say Tom was her boyfriend? Bisexual
    then? 
�It's lovely. Are you a natural blonde?' 
I was about to automatically answer when I remembered the rule about lying. �Not
  really,' I said as I slowly unbuttoned the blouse. 
�I suppose I'll see in a moment,' Rajani said with a sly grin, reaching for
  her wineglass and I blushed even more deeply. 
Taking a deep breath, I peeled the blouse off and dropped it on the sofa.
  Immediately, I felt exposed as Rajani looked at my La Perla bra but I tried
  to ignore her, telling myself to treat this as if I was at a medical examination. 
�A lovely bra,' Rajani said, �expensive but tasteful. What I rather hoped
  from you - rather than something tawdry and overtly sexual.' 
Unzipping my skirt, I stepped out of it, placed it on top of my jacket and,
  face now very hot, stood in front of my tormentor in bra, knickers and pantyhose. 
�Pantyhose?' Rajani said with some surprise, �For some reason, I had thought
  you would wear stockings and a suspender belt. Do you wear stockings?' 
�Sometimes,' I mumbled. 
�Ah, when you want to bedazzle some poor unsuspecting male? A little flash,
  a small peek and they'd be putty in your skilful hands.' 
Was she laughing at me? 
Another deep breath and I peeled the hose down; sitting on the sofa to remove
  it completely. Staring fixedly at a point above Rajani's head, I unclipped
  the bra and it joined the other clothes on the sofa. 
�I thought you were larger,' Rajani said conversationally, eyes fixed on my
  swinging breasts, �but you're about a C-cup?' I nodded, face red and fought
  the urge to fold my arms. 
She had a slight smile on her face as I peeled my knickers down and off; standing
  with my hand in front of my groin and the other across my breasts. 
�Don't be shy,' Rajani teased, �I want to see all of you; hands on head.' 
I blinked small tears back and placed my hands on my head while my tormentor's
  eyes swept over me. 
�Such white skin,' she said softly, �and I see you trim down there?' 
�Yes,' I mumbled, face still hot and eyes lowered. 
�Attractive. Rather a neat kitty,' she said casually, �but the outer labia
  are reasonably prominent.' 
I hated her!  There she was casually discussing my private bits while
  I stood exposed. I had never felt as vulnerable before as I did at that moment. 
�Your nipples are hard � are you cold? Stand in front of the fire.' 
I kept my hands on my head and walked, conscious of my jiggling, loose breasts,
  to stand in front of the fire. 
There was no sound in the room apart from the crackling fire and my own distraught
  breathing. Awash with shame and humiliation, I stood facing the fire, hopeful
  she wouldn't order me to turn around. 
She didn't but what Rajani did say was much worse. 
�Bend over.' 
I gulped but did as she said; my breasts hanging like udders, my hands still
  on my head and my face alive with embarrassment. 
�Tight bottom � do you exercise?' 
�Yes,' I mumbled, �three times a week.' 
�How disciplined.' I heard her giggle. �You can stand up, turn around and
  drop your hands.' 
Rajani was grinning at me as I lowered my hands and something made me not
  cover myself � what was the point � it would just emphasise to her just how
  vulnerable I felt. 
�When did your period finish?' 
�Last week,' I muttered, looking everywhere but her smiling face. Why
    was she asking these questions? 
�What birth control do you use?' 
�The pill,' I murmured. 
�Well,' she said, sipping her wine, �this has been very educational. You don't
  look so powerful without your knickers on, do you?' 
�I suppose not,' I muttered. 
�You look vulnerable. Do you feel that way?' 
�Yes,' I answered softly, wondering how she saw so easily into my thoughts. 
�You can get dressed.' 
Quickly, I scrambled for my clothes and dressed while she watched. �I think
  you understand everything Claudia,' Rajani said calmly as I stepped into my
  shoes. 
�Yes,' I murmured bitterly, tucking my blouse into my skirt. 
�Everything is your choice; you have the right to say no to me.' 
�Yes, and then my life is over!' 
Don't cry , I told myself, don't cry in front of this bitch ! 
�Every action has a consequence, Claudia,' she said gently. �Even those actions
  which occurred many years ago. I think,' she said evenly, eyes holding mine, �we
  should have lunch together. Why don't you telephone me tomorrow?' 
It wasn't a request, I knew that, and I nodded dumbly, standing and waiting. 
�Goodnight, Claudia,' Rajani said calmly, �you can see yourself out.' 
Fighting the tears, I almost ran down the corridor, out the front door and
  to my car. The tears began to flow when I was safely inside my car and I sobbed
  quietly for a few moments, head against the steering wheel until I could regain
  control. 
That bitch! She enjoyed it; I know that she did, the evil kinky Paki bitch! 
Her voice murmured softly within my reeling mind. People whisper and call
    me Paki behind my back. Anglos cannot tell the difference between those from
    India or Pakistan. 
Guiltily, I glanced at her front window, started the car and drove away, wiping
  my eyes with one hand, the other on the wheel. 
I have just stood naked in front of a woman who inspected me as casually
    if I was a kitten in a pet shop! 
What am I going to do? 
The tears began again and I cried as I drove as I knew I could do nothing.
  What was more frightening was the thought of what she would make me do next!

Note from the Author. 
This is the first chapter from my recently published e-novel, The
    Humiliation of Claudia. 
This is my first attempt at a story focussing on female domination of another
  female. It was an experiment, one I'm not sure if I will repeat. 
I experimented with a D/s story where the male is dominant and the female
  submissive ( Kryztal ) and the response to that was not large. 
Thank you for reading and, as always, enjoy your comments.
