Synopsis:        What to feed your pigs and slaves.










�Many of you have asked me for a really good recipe for a meal for a slave or pig. While most anything will do for the fucking hole, it can be advantageous to keep him/her healthy and alert, so they will stay sensitive and aware enough to feel the full effect of any pain or torment you may wish to visit upon them. I have seen dull obedient slaves, and their lack of energy and sickly appearance sometimes turn me off. While I want a pig to be fucked up mentally and think of nothing but serving my dick, I do like it if he/she is alert and attentive to my needs. Thus a good diet is important.�
�� � �For my pigs, breakfast usually consists of a bowl of dry cereal. I often put fruit in it as fruit is a part of �even a hole's daily nutrition requirement. Instead of milk however, I piss on the cereal in front of the slave. Therefore even the very food he/she eats to exist comes partly from my dick! Sometimes for variety I will use dog piss or the piss of a friend. I may even have the slave piss on his/her own cereal. �
�� � For lunch I get a bit more creative. First, lots of lettuce. Then carrots, beans, perhaps tomatoes for a healthy salad. I will throw in some raw eggs. Then for a salad dressing a carefully prepared mixture. �I always pay attention when any of my buddies get colds. I save a big jar of snot and buggers. I blow my nose in the jar as well, until it is quite full. �Now for the salad dressing, I mix equal parts snot �and phelgm. I also collect the spit of friends. When buddies come over for a sex party, I have them spit in this jar for me. This then forms the basis of the dressing. I always try to include some loogies and buggers.�
�� � �Another wonderful dressing is dog cum or horse cum. I have even gotten bull sperm from farms where the bulls are bred. Always make sure the slave knows what the dressing consists of. It makes it more fun.�
�� � For dinner, I usually give the slave a big bowl of dried dog food, mixed with my piss and sometimes I put a healthy dollop of cum on top. I am a firm believer that a slave should never be very far from my body fluids. �At least once a month I include some shit in both the lunch and evening meal. Sometimes it is my own, sometimes a buddy's and sometimes dog or horse shit. I �know many of you are repulsed by scat, so this is a matter of taste. I too am repulsed by scat, but not as much as my slaves, so you can imagine the effect on them. I use shit as a training tool.�
�� � �For variety, if I get two pigs together. I will make a kind of gruel or oatmeal out of dog food, cum, spit, piss, snot etc. Then I will force the gruel up the slaves asses. Then I will make them hold it up their asses for at least thirty minutes. And then, I will have them suck the food out of each other's assholes. I especially enjoy making teenagers do this.�
�� � I have also inserted thick hot dog wieners up the assholes of boys and up the assholes and cunts of girls, and then made other slaves eat them out of the orifices.�
�� � A special treat for a slave can be a master's puke. �I am sure during a sex party when everyone is drinking too much, you have seen some hunky dude vomit all over the face of a slave. Perhaps you have done this yourself. Well, it is lots of fun to watch a slave lick puke off the floor, isn't it? Why not prepare a special meal of puke and have the slave lick it out of a bowl or right off the floor. I use doggy bowls as most of you do for slaves, but I have come recently to enjoy just dumping the food on the floor and having the slave lick it up. This also gets the floor clean. For a holiday like Christmas, I will sometimes allow a slave to eat leftovers or things like baked potato skins. I know I am a softie and many of you may think me too easy on my pigs. I sometimes also have a slave eat a meal of food chewed and spit out into a bowl by my buddies.�
�� � �I mustn't forget desert. �A banana eaten from someones ass is great. Perhaps a banana covered with shit or coated in cum. You would be amazed after a while what a treat this can be for a pig.�
�� � Spit with loogies makes a really good glaze for almost anything. It's during those times you have a really bad cold or flu that you can accumulate lots of sauce in jars to later serve your slave.�
�� � I usually keep a bowl of old dog or horse piss on the floor so the slave has something to drink at all times. You don't want dehydration. Yes, yes, yes, the slave also needs water. Piss alone is not enough for his/her system. Lots of water. You can have your slave drink all of his/her water right out of the toilet. And while they are down there, have them lick the toilet clean.�
�� � If you get a bunch of your pigs together, you can have tons of fun with their party foods. Have them shove the food up each others cunts and assholes. then have them squat over each others' faces and shit the mixture into their mouths. But they are not allowed to swallow. They must then pass it back and forth from mouth to mouth.�
�� � Another fun party meal for pigs is to make them eat and swallow whatever you make for them. Then puke it up. Then have another slave eat it, and then have that slave puke it up. In between, you have your guests jerk off and cum on the puke meal. This slop may be swallowed and puked up over and over again by various pigs.
�� � Of course having slaves eat their meals off of each others naked bodies can always be fun. I love to see a cute teenage boy licking snot and phelgm off the face of another boy or girl. I also enjoy giving a boy a milk enema up his ass and making him hold it for an hour or more and do exercises. He will be in extreme cramps. The he squirts it into the mouth of another pig.�
� � � I would be interested in any of you out there with slaves offering me recipes from your kitchen. I am always looking for variety for my pigs.
