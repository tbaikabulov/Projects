-----------------------------Chapter 1---------------------------------- 

It was her anniversary today... Elizabeth
thought to herself. 

She should be out at a nice restaurant with
soft music and maybe some candle light. Instead she was kneeling on the soft
carpet of her living. Wearing thigh high white stockings and
a shimmery white push-up bra (or a least most of one)
and nothing else. 

Except for the ropes.
Elizabeth couldn't forget about the ropes, or the
blindfold. The Blindfold made it impossible to see anything, and the ropes made
it impossible to move without help. At least she wasn't buckled to the spreader
bar anymore. 

He had tied the ropes to her, and it had all
happened so fast. 

When Elizabeth
walked in the door from work he had been standing behind the door, making it
impossible to see him. 

He had quickly put the blindfold on over her eyes
and using her frozen state of shock had thrown a ball
gag in her mouth before Elizabeth
could make a sound. 

Elizabeth
had then felt his hands move over her body, restraining her hands with a nylon
rope that she had kept in her own apartment. 

Almost immediately the rope started to turn her
on as it tightened around her wrists. The surface was smooth and almost soft,
even now as it bit into her skin slightly. 

Without a word He then started to strip her. Elizabeth
felt the brush of his fingers as He lowered her knee length skirt and then her
white panties with the little pink bow. 

Elizabeth
was thankful she hadn't worn anything special. she
could hear and feel the scissors as He started to cut away the flimsy material
of her blouse. 

The air in the apartment was cold on her near
naked flesh. A small breeze made her nipples start to poke out of the sheer
bra. Or maybe it was the effects of His warm breath on the back of her neck. He
was standing directly behind her. 

His fingers trailing up over
her body, barely touching Elizabeth, so that her skin instantly left a trail of goose bumps. 

Elizabeth
was shocked to feel her own excitement as her juices dribbled on to her thighs
as He led her to the living room. Elizabeth
guessed that they were standing close to the couch, right about where the
coffee table should be. 

She was forced to spread her legs. Elizabeth
wished she still had her panties on, knowing it was quite clear to him that she
was turned on. 

Elizabeth
thought that she heard a chuckle, but was distracted by his hands forcing her
legs further apart and forward. This made her come in contact with cold metal,
as a muffled gasp escaped her gagged mouth. Elizabeth
could feel a leather material being bound around her ankles. Straps were being
buckled into place and Elizabeth
realized she was bound and helpless to his touches. 

Without sight, and very little sound, it all
became about touch as Elizabeth
stood with her hands behind her back, her legs bound to a spreader bar, and
practically naked with just a shear bra and thigh high white stockings. 

The cool air of the apartment made her nipples
stand out against the thin material. 

Elizabeth
felt his hands lightly trailing over her abdomen, causing shivers to travel
through her body. The shivers traveled between her legs, causing a whole new
reaction. She knew her face was turning red from embarrassment; she could feel
the heat on her cheeks as she tried to look down and hide this reaction. His
hands slid around Elizabeth as he
moved to stand behind her. Elizabeth
held her breath as she felt him reach up to hold onto her long ponytail. His
hands brushed through the full length before pulling the ponytail back and
down. Then he tied another rope close to her scalp where the elastic was
holding her hair. He pulled a few times making Elizabeth
gasp, not just in pain, but also pleasure. She hoped that he would not notice. 

Elizabeth's
head was pulled back one last time and held as the rope was tied to her
ponytail and then the other end of the rope tied to her wrists. This forced her
arms back further, her breasts out, and exposed her blushing cheeks. 

Elizabeth
could hear his footsteps walk away into the other room. Almost right away the
footsteps returned. There was a flash. Then another and
another. He was taking her picture. Elizabeth
blushed a darker shade of red. 

After a few more pictures, Elizabeth
felt his hands on her bra. Something cold and hard pressed against her breast.
Then the sheering of scissors filled the room as the material covering her
vulnerable nipples was slowly cut away. He moved to the second breast, when he was
done, the under wire and straps remained, but practically nothing else. 

Again he took pictures, moving around her at
different angles. Elizabeth was
sure that she was blushing over her entire body by now. At one point he must
have put the camera on a timer because Elizabeth
felt his lips on her breast. Then she felt his tongue tickle and teas her
breast. Then a flash came from across the room. Then his mouth was gone. 

Elizabeth
could still feel his tongue, as if it was still sliding over the dimpled nipple.
The light breeze in the room and the wet area on her breast combined and Elizabeth
fought a losing battle as a moan escaped her mouth. If it hadn't been for the
gag she was sure it would have been quite loud. 

Elizabeth
was happy to feel his hands move back to her hair as he loosened and removed
the rope. Her head and arms were able to move back to a more relaxed position,
and she quickly looked down, hiding her face the best she could. 

He then moved closer, brushing Elizabeth's
hair out of the way. Her breath caught as his warm breath moved closer and
closer until his lips met with her tender skin at the base of her neck. 

Elizabeth
instinctively tilted her head to the side and was sure that she could feel him
smiling! 

She knew that he had her where he wanted her. To
prove her thought correct he moved his right hand over her curves to slide
between her legs. His left hand went to her breast, brushing the underside of
her delicate skin, then his fingers moved to play with
the nipple before pinching the dimpled skin. 

Elizabeth's
legs were jelly. She was moaning into the gag, and her neck was tingling! 

This isn't how she should be reacting! Elizabeth
thought to herself, or should it? 

As his fingers started circling her sensitive
clit, Elizabeth felt a familiar
feeling as her skin flushed, her muscles began to tighten in anticipation. Elizabeth
moaned into the gag and leaned against him as an orgasm washed over her. 

He continued to explore her body as she orgasmed,
causing Elizabeth to have multiple
orgasms for about 5 minutes straight. 

When he stopped and just held her, Elizabeth
sighed in relief. He had had his amusement. Maybe he would untie her and leaver
her be? She hadn't seen his face yet. She couldn't cause any trouble for him. 

Elizabeth
felt his hands move down her body, over her abdomen, over her hips, and down
her thighs. She had no idea what his intensions were, but her body was already
responding to his touch. It was strangely gentle, erotic and demanding all at
once. 

His hands moved down to the back of her knees and
forced her down onto her knees. Elizabeth
had a bad feeling that she knew what he had planed next. 

As he moved around her, Elizabeth
heard the zipper, as if in slow motion, as he undid his pants. 

He was going to make her give him head. Elizabeth
hadn't done that since high school! 

After removing his pants, Elizabeth
felt his hands on her cheeks. She struggled to keep the gag on! If she was
gagged she couldn't give head. Right? 

Suddenly his hand struck her cheek! It wasn't very
hard, just enough to shock her and leave a tingly feeling on her skin. 

Stunned, Elizabeth
stopped struggling. He quickly removed the gag before she could resist again. 

&quot;It would be better to just get this over
with,&quot; Elizabeth started to
think. The slap made her realize he could hurt her anytime he wanted, and she
didn't want that. 

One of his hands grabbed onto her ponytail and
pulled her face closer to him. Elizabeth
felt the smooth hardness of his penis for the first time that night, as he slid
it from one cheek to the other. Over her sensitive lips.
She could feel the sticky trail he left on her skin. Without realizing what she
was doing, Elizabeth's tongue
snaked out to lick her coated lips. 

He groaned and pressed the tip against her lips
and tongue. Elizabeth was shocked
and closed her mouth firmly! This wasn't right! She didn't even give her
husband head! 

Elizabeth
heard a click and almost immediately saw a bright flash around her blindfold!
It was then that she realized the camera wasn't set up on a timer, but on a
remote and he was taking pictures of his cock pressed against her lips! 

Elizabeth
didn't even realize she had opened her mouth to gasp, but he had! He forced his
thick cock into her mouth, over her tongue and right to the back of her throat,
causing her to cough before Elizabeth
could think of fighting back. 

His hand on he back of
her head pulled Elizabeth off her
penis as he pulled back at the same time. Then forced her
head into him as he thrust his hips into her face. 

Elizabeth
could hear him starting to breath hard as his second hand went to the other
side of her head. His whole body seemed to be forcing her to give him head as
his hips moved forward and back in rhythm with his hands forcing her head back
and forth. 

His cock filled her mouth and throat as it easily
pumped in and out. Elizabeth found
herself wondering what it would be like inside her other holes and was already
dripping wet again! 

There was no way she could be enjoying this. Was
there? And yet Elizabeth definitely
was. 

Elizabeth
hadn't even noticed that the grip of his hands had relaxed and she was freely
bobbing her head up and down on his penis. Her tongue had started sliding over
the intruding object, exploring the slight bumps and veins. 

He was roaming and breathing very hard. Elizabeth
was actually enjoying the sounds he made and tried moving her tongue in
different directions. Up and down, site to side, and at one point pulled back
to circle the head of his penis. This last one got the biggest reaction so she
alternated between bobbing up and down and pulling back to tease him. 

Elizabeth
had no clue as to how long this went on. In fact she had become so involved she
didn't notice the flash constantly going off! 

His hands tightened on the back of her head
again, suddenly, as he forced his cock deep into her mouth and throat. He held
her there as he let out one last loud moan, snapping Elizabeth
back into reality. 

She tried to fight and pull back as he came in
her mouth, but his grip was too strong! She was forced to swallow as his cum
filled her mouth. 

He let go of his grip on Elizabeth, pulling out
of her mouth, still semi hard and a trail of cum dribbled from the corner of
her mouth. Another click and a flash as he moved away.


Elizabeth
was shocked to find she felt disappointed about him moving away, and she
strained to listen to his movements. 

It sounded like he was moving furniture around
for a few minutes and then he just sat back down on the couch in front of her. 

They sat/knelt in silence. Elizabeth's
hands were still behind her back and as she struggled to rest her arms in a
more comfortable position, she had no clue that her breasts were jiggling just
right for his pleasure. 

The silence was driving her crazy. What if her
husband came home and she was still sitting like this? One look at her and he
would know she enjoyed at least part of it. How could she explain that away? 

&quot;Please just let me go. I won't tell anyone
about what happened. I'll shower in front of you so that you can see nothing will
be left to show you were even here. Just don't let anyone see me like
this!&quot; 

Elizabeth
started begging and babbling to Him. 

Still He sat in silence. 

&quot;Please,&quot; she was crying now,
&quot;I'll do anything, please!&quot; 

He moved forward, drying her tears with a handkerchief.


----------------------------------------------------------


&quot;Where were you?&quot; a distant voice
demanded, &quot;I tried calling and waited for over two hours!&quot; He sounded
upset. 

Elizabeth
slowly started to sit up, moving her wet hair from her face. &quot;
W what..?&quot; 

&quot;What do you mean what?!&quot; her husband
was standing over their bed, looking down on her. &quot;Our
anniversary dinner! That's What! So where were you?!&quot; he demanded. 

Elizabeth
sat all the way up, trying to clear her mind. Was it all a dream? No her wrists
were sore and she could still taste his cum in her mouth. 

But she was in bed, freshly showered. The last
thing she remember was Him whipping her tears away...
&quot;Oh man!&quot; she thought, &quot;He drugged me!&quot; She had to think
quickly. In her state that wasn't easy! 

&quot;I'm sorry Hunny.
I came home not feeling well and not wanting to ruin our night I just took some
gravol to make me feel better. I guess I must have
taken too much and fallen asleep after my shower.&quot; 

Obviously her husband bought it, because he sat
down on the bed, put his arm around her and said, &quot;Why didn't you call and
tell me? I would have come home and taken care of you!&quot; 

Elizabeth
hugged him close. She was just happy she would never have to tell him.
&quot;I'm sorry, I should have.&quot; 

&quot;It's ok. You just go back to sleep. I�ll
take care of you.&quot; He tucked her in and left the room. 

Elizabeth's
last thought was &quot;at least it's all over now.&quot; and curled up I the
blankets. 

&nbsp;






-----------------------------Chapter 2---------------------------------- 

Elizabeth's face went whit as she opened the envelope that was sitting on
  her desk when she got in. It was one week to the day of her encounter. 

Looking at the contents, Elizabeth knew it would never be over... 
Elizabeth sat in the corner office, flushed. She had been having an average
  normal day until she had walked into the office late and found that envelope
  sitting on her desk. As soon as she had opened the seal and pulled the pictures
  out she had gone white. 

Then Elizabeth had quickly locked her door. Reviewing each of the pictures
  one by one she hoped to figure out who the man was. He had edited the photos
  before sending them. His face was gone. There was little more than his penis
  and hands in each of the pictures. 

Elizabeth flipped through the pictures quickly. There she was standing with
  her head tilted back, her arms bound behind her back, her breasts thrusting
  outwards. Then she was sitting, resisting the penis pressing against her lips.
  The shocked look on her face in the next picture must have been when she gasped
  at her photo being taken with the penis pressed against her lips. 

That hard, smooth skinned penis! Elizabeth started remembering as her head
  was being forced up and down on its length. She could almost feel it slipping
  in and out of her mouth, the length caressing her tongue. 

Elizabeth's hand slipped under her skirt, pushing aside the thin material
  of her panties. She leaned back in her leather chair as her eyes closed, and
  she imagined He was forcing her to give Him head. She could almost taste the
  saltiness of His pre-cum in her mouth as her thumb teased her clit and her
  middle finger began to slip inside. 

The feeling washed over her as she remembered Him taking pictures as Elizabeth
  started to willingly give Him head, her thumb was hitting all the right spots. 

Elizabeth's body arched as she gave herself an orgasm from her fingers and
  the thought of Him cumming in her mouth and holding her in place so that she
  had to swallow most of it! 

Gasping and fighting to get her body back under control Elizabeth found herself
  glad that it wasn't over, and yet so ashamed that she would feel this way!
  It was wrong! 

That day Elizabeth worked well into the evening to avoid going home, not wanting
  to look her husband in the face knowing another man had turned her on so much
  she had touched herself AND given herself an orgasm.

-----------------------------Chapter
3----------------------------------

&nbsp;

����������� Elizabeth
awoke suddenly as her husband, William, shook her.

�Are you ok? You were moaning and
crying out in your sleep.�

�I.. I
was?� Elizabeth was groggy and half
asleep. William moved closer, his hand moving over her waist in a petting
motion.

�You were, and to be honest it was
starting to turn me on,� William�s hand moved up over Elizabeth�s
soft skin to tease the sensitive underside of her breast as his hot breath
tickled the hairs on her neck.

Elizabeth
moaned slightly as her body began to respond and turn sensitive. Her dream came
back as images of mysterious hands trailed over her body and bound her hands
behind her back.

William took her moaning as a sign
and moved his finder tips over her nipples teasing the tip into a hard nub. As
the nipple hardened under his fingers, William began to kiss the sweet soft
skin at the base of Elizabeth�s
neck and pressed his pelvis suggestively against her bottom.

Elizabeth,
fully awake now, reached up with her hand to caress her other breast, now
openly moaning, but not just because of her husbands� touches, but also because
of the images in her mind. That night had greatly affected her, more than she
would like to admit. Those pictures showing up certainly didn�t help to push
that night from her mind.

Releasing her nipple, William moved
his hand down over his wife�s smooth stomach and moved his pelvis away from her
body. Elizabeth�s moans and pleas
brought a smile to his lips. William moved his hand
even lower to sit just above the small triangle of pubic hair, turned on from
the way her body moved and seeked out his.

Moving his hand away suddenly
William said, �I�m sorry, love. I shouldn�t have started this. We both have
early mornings tomorrow, and I should let you sleep.� With that he kissed her
cheek and rolled away from her to lie on his back.

�No, please dear. It�s ok. I can
get by on very little sleep, and I�m sure you could too.� Elizabeth
rolled onto her side, looking at him in the dark, her hand resting on his
chest. �Is there anything I could do to change your mind?�

Silence hung in the room as William
pretended to think. �I don�t know,� his voice seemed hesitant, �I know what I
would like. At the same time, I also know that you don�t enjoy it. How could I
possibly ask you?�

�Hun, how could I deny you?� Elizabeth
asked sweetly as her hand trailed so low her fingers tangled in he pubic hair. All she was thinking about was sweet release
from this feeling of horniness taking over her body.

�Well, in that case�� he kissed her
softly on the lips, leading their embrace into a hot steamy kiss, leaving them
both breathless. His fingers then slid down her body to tease her clit, wet
from her excitement. William whispered into her ear as he nibbled, �give me
head my dear and I�ll make love to you till you scream.�

Shocked Elizabeth
pulled back. He knew she hated to give head! Did he know about the stranger? No
he couldn�t.

The feel of a hard cock moving
between her lips jumped into her head and she was even hornier! She couldn�t
admit that to William, though, or he would know something had happened.

Elizabeth
forced herself to act repulsed and said, �I can�t do that. You know I don�t
like to do that.�

William used his fingers, still
between her legs, to flick the tip of her clit and without saying anything
leaned forward to lick just the very tip of her nipple.

�Well,� gasping a soft moan, Elizabeth
breathed out the words �ok� but no sound would come out.

Smiling a secret smile, William
pushed of f the covers, his penis standing straight up, harder than Elizabeth
had seen it in a long time.

Elizabeth
licked her lips as she moved her body down between his legs.

Her lips felt like silk, her breath
warm and her tongue wet as her mouth moved over the head of his penis. William
was in heaven. No feeling could match the one of your wife giving you head.

Elizabeth
tried to remember what she had done for the stranger. She closed her eyes and
imagined it was �his� cock between her lips ash she moved her mouth up and down
the shaft. She could feel a tingle between her legs, telling her she was
enjoying this.

William reached down to play with
her hair, this night was turning out better than he could have imagined.

Elizabeth
imagined it was �his� hands in her hair, forcing her to give him head, forcing
his cock down her throat. She moaned and began to use her tongue more
vigorously, the suction from her lips tightened and she felt his cock start to
swell. She was doing a good job. She then deep throated his cock and moaned
again as her sensitive nipples brushed against the hairs on his legs. The
sensations were too much and she began to orgasm.

William was so caught off guard by
her orgasm that he cam in her mouth almost instantly. He was a little scared
that Elizabeth would be upset;
instead he was shocked again to feel her swallowing around his penis!

Turned on by this William moved out
from under her, flipping her onto her back, pulling her to the edge of the bed
and grabbing her legs, placing them on either side of him over his shoulders.
William drove into his wife�s dripping pussy so hard he could her the slapping of their skin meeting.

He couldn�t help himself and she
was obviously enjoying this as another orgasm rocked through her body.

They made love the rest of that
night, and both had to call in sick the next day as they made love all the next
day as well.

William never knew his wife could
be so sensual.

Elizabeth
couldn�t help herself.

The next day, things were all about
to change, and Elizabeth was in for
a big shock.

-----------------------------Chapter
4----------------------------------

&nbsp;

Amongst her mail that day, Elizabeth
found a large vanilla envelope, addressed the same way as the pictures had been
only two days prior. Jumping up she closed and locked her office door.

����������� After
opening the envelope she found similar pictures to the ones before, her
blindfolded face as she was giving head to a complete stranger. Her hands bound
behind her back with her hardened nipples standing out. One photo even caught a
shine of light glinting off of the metal bar holding her feet apart. Then the
last picture threw her for a loop.

She was on her back,
the expression on her face was that of complete bliss as she orgasmed with her
husband penis buried deep with in her.

This time there was a note after
all of the pictures. She read it slowly.

&nbsp;


 
  
  �Elizabeth,
  ����������� My wife, if I had known that
  selling you off to the highest bidder at a BDSM auction would have sparked
  the passion I felt from you yesterday, I would have done it a long time ago.
  &nbsp;
  William.
  &nbsp;
  P.S. You look
  absolutely ravishing while sucking my cock.�
  &nbsp;
  
 


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

What? Her
husband? He set her up? He had pictures?

So many thoughts and emotions ran
through her mind. She didn�t know where to begin, what to do� how to feel!
