Synopsis: Another couple story. It isn't so "direct" as my other stories. In this story, the male is in control. The story is fiction.Chapter 1: At the tearoom of the airport. 
In the evening, Sylvie and Rick sat down at the tearoom of the airport. They
  didn't intend to catch a flight. They just enjoyed the view of planes landing
  or parting. And to have a drink of course. They were a couple for only two
  months. Still much exploring to do. 
�So when did you have your first sexual experience, Rick?� 
�Whoa! Sensitive subject. I lost my virginity at the age of eighteen.� The
  man admitted. 
�There's no shame losing your virginity at such age. I lost mine at the age
  of sixteen.� The tanned brunette said with a smile. Rick felt a little uncomfortable
  but he didn't want her to know about it. �I have made love of three guys in
  total. But actually the first guy didn't count because we broke up too soon.� The
  greened eyed woman honestly said. 
�I understand.� Rick was less experienced and was a little ashamed to admit
  it. He didn't mention his sm feelings on purpose. The tanned sportive man with
  dark hair was scared she would leave him just because of his hidden feelings.
  His concerns may be justified or maybe not. He wasn't ready to talk about it.� 
�Do you think I have beautiful boobs?� Sylvie asked, almost girlish. If she
  giggled, you would think she wants sex for the first time. 
�Honey, you know as I do, I think you have beautiful breasts. Why should a
  man have more than a handful?� Was his daring reply. 
�Oh I don't know, I want bigger breasts.� Sylvie felt unsatisfied. Rick realized
  she had sometimes immature manners but he learned to look past that. Her manners
  were of course fabricated. 
�What should I do to prove it to you?� He asked a little bit agitated. 
�Let's go home, it's getting late.� Sylvie said. 
They drove home in silence. Rick was wondering she wasn't visiting too much
  tanning salons. He didn't use tanning salons. Sylvie was wondering how to improve
  their sex life but couldn't imagine something. 
Once at home, still agitated, Rick said he wanted to go to bed. Sylvie agreed.
  After all, they were both tired. In bed, Rick switched off the lights and started
  to caress Sylvie. She was a bit shocked, he never tried it with the lights
  off. �At least it's something different.� Sylvie thought. Perhaps Rick did
  it was because was still angry or perhaps he was fed up to hide his feelings.
  Either way, he wished he bought a glowing condom, he did have some trouble.
  But it was fun. 
While cuddling afterwards, he all of the sudden said �And tomorrow we'll play
  pirate.� 
�Will you amputate my leg and put a parrot on my shoulders?� She laughed in
  a friendly way. 
�You'll see.� Was his mysterious answer. Rick hoped she wouldn't understand
  his subtle hints but in a bizarre way he did wish she would guess. He often
  didn't understand his own emotions. Although women are smart, Sylvie didn't
  read his subtle hints. 
Chapter 2: The next day in the bedroom. 
�Will you again switch off the lights?� Sylvie asked. 
�No, I just get this towel and let's have some fun.� 
�A towel?� Sylvie asked like she misunderstood him. 
�Yes, Darling, a towel.� Rick replied. �Let's put it on one eye and tie it
  at the back of your head. Then it looks like you're a pirate.� 
�Ok.� She didn't understood where he was going at. She thought he had some
  strange fantasies. But she wanted to play along. It was new, so she didn't
  objected. 
They made love and Sylvie felt strange and she was wondering what he had next
  in mind. 
�Let's play Dark, Sylvie.� He said. He blindfolded her. All of the sudden
  his girlfriend realized what he was getting at. It all seemed so harmless.
  He started very subtle: the lights off; playing pirate. This was the moment
  when Rick exposed his hidden secret without mention the word �sm�. He always
  wanted to avoid using terms like �sm� �bondage� �maledom�. He hated how people
  put labels on everything and everybody. Like everything or everybody needs
  a word tattooed on their forehead saying �hunk� or �hooters� or �likes femdom�. 
�He'll not hurt me,� she decided. �I can still stop him if I want to.� She
  felt comfortable. Sylvie was happy he didn't push it and he took it slow, one
  step at a time and he had some funny names too. She knew Rick dislikes labels
  but the names were so funny you could hardly call it a label. Some things you
  still have to label� 
He took the towel away and said to Sylvie: �Wouldn't it be fun to handcuff
  just one hand, not tied. You can still make it loose with your other hand.� She
  nodded. They continued to make love and Sylvie was enjoying it. Not only did
  they play �Pirate� and �Dark� and now, she was �handcuffed� with a towel. The
  thought of not getting away, excited her somewhat. She has never done these
  things before. Sylvie never really thought about sm. She thought it was all
  so scary, hurting people but what my boyfriend is doing feels good. 
Sylvie pretended she escape him by �struggling� to remove the �handcuff�.
  It was all played. She liked it. Once she was �free�, they made love. 
�I don't mind you being a little more dominant.� She said afterwards. Sylvie
  imagined being controlled by her good looking boyfriend. She liked the thought. 
Chapter 3: Bondage 
The next day, Sylvie was waiting patiently for Rick to come home. When he
  arrived, she dragged him into the bedroom. Could this be interpreted as she
  being dominant? It wasn't Sylvie's intention. She gave two towels to him. Rick
  immediately knew what he's suppose to do. Without one word, Sylvie's boyfriend
  tied both hands to the metal framework of the bed. 
�You'll not escape this time, honey.� Rick said teasing. The �handcuffs� were
  harder to remove but Sylvie didn't objected. She wanted to explore, to experience
  new things. She was controlled by her boyfriend. Being controlled felt good
  in bed. The feeling of surrendering your feelings to someone was exciting,
  not in the erotic sense but in the psychological sense. 
�This must feel how to be dominated feels like.� She thought. �Is this the
  true nature of women? To be submissive? Isn't it better to find a balance between
  all things? Rick always treated me well, I shouldn't make it hard for him.
  My boyfriend was always there for me.� Sylvie reflected. 
�Please take me, Rick.� The brunette said without reasoning. It just came
  out her mouth. Her boyfriend didn't expect such language. He was happy she
  didn't have a problem with his desires. They made love, encouraged by Sylvie's
  words, Rick made harder moves. It was quite a change for him, he used only
  slow moves before. Despite his lack of experience, he managed surprisingly
  quite well. 
�Dark.� She whispered. Her boyfriend knew what he had to do. Rick made a move
  to remove the handcuffs but she stopped him. 
�Let's do both handcuffs and Dark.� Almost begging she answered. 
Rick did what Sylvie was expecting. Sylvie didn't want to see his face. She
  imagined to make love with a stranger. She knew of course Rick was in the room.
  But because of playing dark, she could secretly use her imagination. Perhaps
  she was tired of only having sex with Rick. When she was young, she always
  had many boyfriends. But Rick was her first real boyfriend. Maybe she has nostalgia.
  She still had her youthful looks but somehow, she doubted she still could seduce
  other men. Maybe she was a bit insecure. 
They played. They caressed each other after sex. More and more, he felt comfortable
  in bed. Since he was young, he wanted to dominate women, although he never
  acted on those impulses. Most of all, he was happy, he could push it to the
  next level. 
Chapter 4: Stretching 
�I bought a little surprise for you, Sylvie, I'll be gentle. Let's call it
  pressure.� His girlfriend was excited, she couldn't see what he bought because
  they played �Dark�. 
�What could it be?� She wondered. �Ice cubes? A vibrator? Perhaps therapeutic
  massage oil?� 
�Just relax. It's important not to get excited, it may hurt.� Sylvie did get
  excited but it didn't matter. Slowly, Rick licked her anus. 
She laughed. �What are you doing?� 
�You'll see.� Was his typical answer. 
Gently, Rick continued. His girlfriend seemed to enjoy it more. Now and then,
  a soft moan was heard. He was careful, he didn't want anything to happen to
  her. Sylvie was wondering he would do next. 
�Why did you stopped licking me, honey?� She demanded. �I liked it.� 
He kissed her. And said: �It's time to get acquainted with a new toy. Take
  a deep breath.� 
Slowly but firmly he inserted a buttplug into her buttocks. You could tell
  she was surprised. She made a moan when the new toy was fully inserted. She
  enjoyed the pressure on her sphincter. Sylvie never knew it could be so much
  fun just to feel such pressure. The idea of stretching her anus was exciting.
  Secretly, she wished to stretch her sphincter more and more. She didn't want
  Rick to know but he could read her mind like a charm. She moaned more. 
He replaced the new toy with a more advanced model. It was longer and a bit
  thicker. Sylvie liked it. She liked the pressure even more. It's getting stretched
  more and more. She moaned. She enjoyed it. Soon it'll be stretched enough to
  accommodate a penis. 
�Do you want sex with your toy?� Her boyfriend asked. 
Sylvie didn't answer. She looked into his eyes and he saw an expression he
  never saw before. She looked determined. Sylvie took the plug and slid it carefully
  in and out. At first she did it slowly. Progressively, she was determined to
  slide it faster and faster. 
�Come here, Rick! Make love to me.� She said determined. 
Rick was surprised. To make love anally was not his intention. He proceeded
  carefully. 
�A little harder wouldn't hurt me.� Sylvie said shyly. 
They caressed and kissed each other afterwards. Sylvie loved her husband because
  of his renewed sexual ideas. Playing �Dark�, �Pirate�, �Handcuff�, �Pressure� she
  liked it all. She looked forward to explorer it more deeply.
