"Three Ponies" 
����� byAbe 

My fiance&#8217;, Benito, was very busy before the elections,&nbsp; both at the restaurant and as a block captain for the Conservative Christian&nbsp; Party. He promised me we would get married as soon as possible after the&nbsp; election. I spent my lonely nights watching TV, especially Paola, Fredericka,&nbsp; and Bianca, female "talking heads" who always took the Leftist view. No party&nbsp; won a majority, but the CCP got enough seats in the parliament that they were&nbsp; accepted into the coalition government. Their price was two ministries, Justice&nbsp; and Defense. Soon Paola disappeared. The Ministry of Justice said that&nbsp; her clothes had been found in a small boat drifting in the Adriatic, and she was&nbsp; presumed drowned, either by accident or suicide. Two days later, Fredericka, the&nbsp; one with the bleached blonde hair, disappeared from the TV, and the tabloid&nbsp; newspapers, citing unnamed official sources, said she had embezzeled money and&nbsp; fled to Russia. A week later, Bianca, probably the prettiest of the three,&nbsp; disappeared. It was said that she had abandoned her husband and children and run&nbsp; off with a wealthy Argentinian capitalist. Of course there was a lot of gossip&nbsp; about immoral communists, but most people, on the right and the left, seemed to&nbsp; accept that these strange coincidences happen. 

The next month, Benito&nbsp; and I were married, even though I had a cast on my leg from a nasty fall. He had&nbsp; arranged a honeymoon at a remote island resort. After a change of planes, we&nbsp; arrived by boat after dark. I could see that there was an ancient looking&nbsp; village with a castle on the shore of a small harbor, very picturesque. We had a&nbsp; little cottage, very private, and Benito went out of his way to make our wedding&nbsp; night pleasant and memorable. We skipped breakfast, but Benito said we must get&nbsp; up to attend a lecture on the Duties of a Christian Wife. It was then I realized&nbsp; that our visit had strings attached. The whole island was owned by the&nbsp; Conservative Christian Party, and everyone we saw or met was active in the&nbsp; party. It was kind of spooky, especially when we went to dinner, the noon meal.&nbsp; The meal was buffet style, but all the workers, in the kitchen or carrying food&nbsp; to the dining room, were women, dressed in identical black dresses, not really&nbsp; dresses, more like burlap sacks, a very rough fabric, with holes cut for neck&nbsp; and arms. They were ankle&#8209;length, and the women, whether teen&#8209;age or middle aged&nbsp; or something in between, were barefoot, and they all had wedding rings! When I mentioned it to Benito, he explained that all the workers were&nbsp; wives of party members who needed remedial instruction in their wifely duties.&nbsp; That really made me shiver.

Our schedule was all mapped out for us.&nbsp; Apparently all the honeymooners get the same itinerary, visits to shrines and&nbsp; monuments and lectures. However, I couldn't walk up to the hilltop shrine of St.&nbsp; Basil, so Benito said he'd get us a pony cart. The cart was metal, a&nbsp; bench seat for two with a foot rest and wire&#8209;spoked wheels, like a motorcycle's.&nbsp; A tubular shaft went forward to a crossbar, where the ponies were hitched. The&nbsp; surprise was that the ponies, three of them, were women! They wore leather&nbsp; helmets which also covered the upper part of the face, with only a sort of oval&nbsp; tube in front of the eyes, which would allow the "pony" to see directly ahead&nbsp; and down. The helmets were decorated with plumes, red, blue, and green, the&nbsp; names of the ponies. The helmets also had bridles, with an iron bit in the&nbsp; mouth. I wondered why a bit but no reins. Benito noted the bit made speech&nbsp; impossible. Each woman wore a wide, tight black belt around her waist. Her&nbsp; wrists had leather cuffs which attached to the belt above each hip, so her arms&nbsp; were useless. Her lower legs were enclosed in black boots of a strange style.&nbsp; Judging from the length, the woman's toes were pointed down, like with very high&nbsp; heels, but the foot of the boot was not shaped like a foot. Rather it resembled a&nbsp; horse's hoof,&nbsp; and I wondered if it was possible to walk in them, unless one was&nbsp; held upright by the cart harness, for it would have been like walking on stilts.&nbsp; The harness was simple. The tubular crossbar pressed against the back of the&nbsp; thigh, just at the crease of the buttocks, and from there a wide leather strap&nbsp; &#8209;&#8209;&#8209; it smelled of urine &#8209;&#8209;&#8209; went forward between the legs and attached at the&nbsp; belt. The strap covered the genital area and, I was certain, when the&nbsp; pony pulled forward, that the propulsive force must come from the pressure of&nbsp; her vulva against the strap. The anal region was covered by a horse&#8209;like tail,&nbsp; red, blue, or green, which, it seemed, must be attached to some sort of object&nbsp; embedded in the rectum. There would be no need to clean up pony manure.&nbsp; Otherwise the ponies were naked, except for the breasts. The central part of&nbsp; each breast was covered by a black metal cup, bullet shaped, which seemed firmly&nbsp; attached, but it was not evident how. I thought of glue, or perhaps a vacuum&nbsp; holding the cup against the breast. Benito said it was possible they were&nbsp; mechanically attached, as with nails driven into the breast tissue. I shuddered&nbsp; to think of it. There was a buggy whip in a socket next to the seat, but there&nbsp; was no need to use it. The ponies, muscular, sun tanned, were well trained, and&nbsp; it was only necessary for Benito to say, "Take us to St. Basil's", and off they&nbsp; went. For most of the way, there was a smooth path, a bit wider than the&nbsp; cart. They moved out at a good pace, where the path was fairly level, but when&nbsp; we came to a hill, the three of them had to lean into their work to pull up&nbsp; uphill. I marveled at their well developed thigh muscles as they strained to&nbsp; pull us. The slope was so steep that we were tilted back in our seats, and I&nbsp; wondered if my skirt preserved my modesty. A Christian woman does not wear&nbsp; garments which "divide the legs", and I couldn't have put on slacks over my&nbsp; cast, anyway. I kept my knees pressed together. Near the top, sweating with&nbsp; exertion, the ponies stopped for a moment, taking deep breaths. I could only imagine the effect, pain or pleasure, of the pressure of the strap against their genitals, but it seemed as if it must be brutal torture, so humiliating.&nbsp; Benito impatiently cracked the whip, first in the air&nbsp; and then against Blue's bare buttock, which bore the marks of previous whippings. The ponies resumed their work. At&nbsp; last we came near the shrine, but the path went no further; there were steps&nbsp; which blocked the progress of the cart. Benito jumped out and said, "Julia, my&nbsp; dear, you can't possibly climb the steps. Wait here while I go and see the&nbsp; shrine." The ponies just stood there, balancing on their hooves, nearly&nbsp; motionless.

As soon as Benito was out of sight, I climbed down, and&nbsp; hobbled toward where I could get a better view of the sea. Blue, as I passed,&nbsp; started to cough and gag, heaving her metal&#8209;clad breasts as if she couldn't&nbsp; breathe. With the metal weights on them, they swung like bells in a wind storm.&nbsp; Concerned, I loosened Blue's bridle and bit, which instantly solved her&nbsp; breathing problem. "Thank you so much," she said. "The bit is so uncomfortable."

"Somehow, I didn't expect you to speak," I said,&nbsp; stupidly. "How did you come to have a job like this?"

"I used to be a&nbsp; television personality. I was known as Bianca. The fascists kidnapped me and&nbsp; told me that a communist, who was always concerned for the working class, was a&nbsp; hypocrite if she earned a huge salary for talking. I should experience work&nbsp; myself. Red is Fredricka, and Green is Paola. They say we will never leave this&nbsp; island. Since our faces are covered, very few know who we are, and they won't&nbsp; tell." It dawned on me that, if one controlled the Ministry of Justice&nbsp; and all the police, such a thing was possible.

"They just put you into harness?"

"No, we were broken, first." I nodded to her to go on. "I woke up naked,&nbsp; with my head and body hair all shaved, suspended by my wrists from that&nbsp; gallows&#8209;like frame you must have noticed in the plaza, by the harbor. My head&nbsp; was covered, as it is now, but with my eyes covered, too, so I could not see,&nbsp; but I could hear people, men, all around me, talking, calling me a communist&nbsp; slut and things like that. I was so embarrassed, naked in public like that. But&nbsp; it got worse. They forced me to drink castor oil, and as I hung there in the&nbsp; sun, with my ankles tied together, I could not help shitting, soiling myself&nbsp; while the men laughed. After that, they took me down and spread&#8209;eagled&nbsp; me on a gridiron, criss&#8209;crossed iron bars, and they put me into the harbor, with just my head above water. It was awful. I could feel&nbsp; eels slithering across my body. Starfish crawled over my skin with their little&nbsp; sucker feet, and crabs. A squid wrapped its tentacles around my breast and tried&nbsp; to eat my nipple off, but somehow it couldn't. You know how octopuses hide in&nbsp; cracks in the sea floor? An octopus took up residence in my vagina! I could feel&nbsp; it going in and out as it ambushed it's prey and then retreated to it's hiding&nbsp; place to eat. They left me there all night. In the morning, I was desperately&nbsp; thirsty, and my skin was all wrinkled from immersion in the sea water. They&nbsp; laughed and hosed me off and said I could have a drink, up the ass. They put the&nbsp; hose against my anus and forced water into me until I thought I would burst, and&nbsp; I could hear men joking about how much I could take. Then, of course, I expelled&nbsp; the water in a great gush, and the men laughed and laughed and made my torturers&nbsp; do it over and over.

"Then they took me to a sort of barrel or pipe on&nbsp; short legs. They bent me over and pushed my upper body into the barrel, pulling&nbsp; my breasts through holes in the wall of the pipe. They put rope nooses over my&nbsp; breasts so I couldn't move. My hips and bottom, of course, were obscenely&nbsp; displayed, and they forced my legs apart and tied them, so any spectator could&nbsp; see my most private parts. Then they brought out a big dog and sprayed my&nbsp; bottom with bitch scent. I couldn't see the dog, but he must have been huge, for&nbsp; he got up, his forelegs grasping the barrel, and pushed his huge cock into my&nbsp; vagina. At first, it was only uncomfortable, and very humiliating, to be raped&nbsp; with a dog's penis the size of baguette, but when it swelled up, so big he&nbsp; couldn't pull it out, I was in real pain. It seemed forever, that he ravished me&nbsp; and squirted semen into me, while the men joked and laughed. He could&nbsp; not, you see, remove his penis until the swelling went down. I didn't think&nbsp; anything could be worse than that, but they brought out another dog, and they&nbsp; pressed his long, pointed penis against my anus. I was, by this time, sobbing&nbsp; hopelessly and crying that they were tearing my anus, but of course that didn't&nbsp; stop them.

"When the second dog was finally able to pull out, I was&nbsp; convinced they would stop torturing me, but they had other ideas. They brought&nbsp; out a small horse and induced him to mount the barrel as he would a mare. His&nbsp; member must have been the size of my forearm, and it would surely have torn my&nbsp; uterus loose, if he put it in my vagina. However, they steered it into my ass,&nbsp; and he must have pushed 50 centimeters into my bowels. I was bleeding and almost&nbsp; insane with pain when he finally withdrew; my anus was torn and gaping open.&nbsp; They packed it with medicated gauze and led me to the stables."

"The&nbsp; three of us live in the stables, sleeping in the straw of our stalls. By day we&nbsp; pull this cart. By night, we are fucked by many men; we never see their faces.&nbsp; They say that if a pony complains, they'll give us to the stallion again. I will&nbsp; do anything to avoid that. My anus, now, is about 4 cm. in diameter, with&nbsp; nothing plugging it, and the tail I'm wearing, day and night, is attached to a&nbsp; plug about 8 cm. in diameter, at the opening, bigger inside. Normal defecation&nbsp; is impossible, but they hose us out every day, before they put the tail back in&nbsp; for the day." 

There were so many questions I wanted to ask, like about&nbsp; the metal breast covers and if they ever released her hands and did she have a&nbsp; chance to bathe, but I saw Benito coming, and I had to put the bit back in her&nbsp; mouth before he saw what I had done. The downhill ponycart ride was&nbsp; uneventful, if you think that watching the women leaning back against the crossbar&nbsp; and seeing their breasts swaying, and imagining what their clitorises must be&nbsp; like after all that rubbing with a rough leather strap is not an event.

When we&nbsp; got back to Rome, I made an excuse to visit my mother. I dare not tell my story,&nbsp; that I know where the three leftist news readers really are. I don't think I want to go back to my husband, Benito, but the CCP&#8209;run Justice Ministry has made&nbsp; it almost impossible for a wife to leave her husband, and I know that, if I&nbsp; tried to escape and failed, Benito would not hesitate to send me for&nbsp; "re&#8209;education" on the island. The thought of that rough fabric rubbing my&nbsp; nipples while I wash thousands of dishes is enough to make me submissive, as a&nbsp; good Christian wife should be. 

&#8209; The End &#8209;
