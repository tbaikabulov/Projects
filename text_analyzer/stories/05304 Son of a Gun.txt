Son of a Gun

Part One

&nbsp;

by Velvetglove

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The blade slid silently across
young Grommet�s throat.

�What you looking at, boy ?�

The Ship�s Lad froze in terror at
the unexpected sound of the Second Mate�s growl. The
erection, which the fourteen year old boy had been fisting through a slit in
the inside pocket of his breeches, softened almost instantaneously in shock.

But not fast enough.

The iron grip of Master Wallis, the
Second Mate, spun the fourteen year old lad around effortlessly.

With a wordless snarl, the
bear-like older man stared coldly down in amusement at the petrified young
voyeur�s bulge, then he quietly leaned forward so that
he too could take a turn peeking through the hole.

Left-handed, he kept the sharp
gutting knife poised in position, still pricking the vulnerable underside of
young Grommet�s neck, while he pressed his right eye against the wood.

They were below decks in a dark,
dingy storeroom adjacent to the most privileged part of the vessel; the
passengers� quarters.

The tiny eyehole looked into the
cabin of the only male and female couple on the voyage.

Wallis grinned at the display of
Sir Rufus and Lady Rigby enjoying a cramped, afternoon fuck on the narrow
double-cot. It was their honeymoon, after all. They were on their way to
start married life together in South Africa.

He studied them, guessing the
red-headed, red-blooded male was older than his wife, at around thirty. His
�Sir� was an inherited title. The young fuckwit
obviously hadn�t done anything himself to merit an honour except hunt, shoot,
fish and screw scullery maids. He was still wearing his cream silk shirt,
riding up his back, as his pale buttocks hammered up and down on top of his
young, nubile love. 

The new Lady Helen Rigby was no
more than twenty two, with a lovely glossy skinned face totally devoid of
pockmarks and blemishes, a tousled mop of toffee coloured curls, brown
doe-eyes, and tits like ripe grapefruits that were barely confined by her
bodice.

Wallis couldn�t see her face at
that moment but the position of her ankles drumming her husband�s back
suggested the slut was probably enjoying her new afternoon pastime.

Wallis slowly pulled his eye away
from the hole and stared back down at the anxious lad.
He chuckled, sheathed his knife and ruffled the teenager�s hair.

�Run along, boy.�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

*** *** ***

&nbsp;

I laid the knife meaningfully along
her throat.

Her lovely emerald eyes stared back
up at me, saucer-wide and evidently full of terror.

�Open wide.�

My knees were planted firmly either
side of her shoulders, my butt across her ribs, my sweaty balls bouncing on her
cleavage. I was holding the knife in my right hand so that I could pump myself
in a frenzy with my other fist.

The piece of cutlery I was pressing
into her skin was blunt but she parted her jaws and hesitantly opened her plump
red lips regardless.

I literally laughed aloud as the
first huge rope of pearly semen uncoiled out of my cockslit
and landed with an audible splat on her forehead, backfilling along the bridge
of her nose, upper lip and into her gaping mouth.

She shut her eyes but not fast
enough. A second jet pulsed in a straight line directly into her right eye then
hosed her cheek.

She gasped as her eye stung,
instinctively wriggling to try and use her hand to wipe it, but I had pinned
both her arms still by her side.

In the throes of my orgasm, I
couldn�t help her, even had I�d wanted to. I kept
frantically jacking my dick with my left hand, aiming for the other side of her
face, watching the third of my customary �big three� dollops land in her other
eye socket, leaving a trail from her chin to her eyebrow.

Oh boy, do I love a face
painting session !

My balls still had a couple more
bullets in the chamber. Not as messy as the opening triple torpedo salvo but
just as tasty. I concentrated my firepower into her mouth, looking down as it
coated her tongue, gums and palate.

A few seconds later, I was done.

�Phew !� I
exclaimed, lifting a knee, climbing off her chest and collapsing on the
mattress beside her. �Pheweee.�

I glanced up at the digital clock
by my side of the hotel bed. The green numbers told me I�d timed everything
perfectly. The pay-per-view movie I�d selected was starting at seven.

She was reaching out to her bedside
table for a tissue. Her fingers fumbled about, eyes shut tight due to my
stinging juice.

I watched her a moment, getting my
breath. At last she found the box and extracted a tissue, pulling it over to
her face.

�Let me.� I said, softly.

I used my fingers to scoop as much
of my coagulating spunk as possible into a puddle and eased it onto her upper
lip.

�Open up.�

Obediently, she made an �o� with
her mouth.

I tipped the goo
in and only afterwards used the tissue to mop up the residue from her eye
sockets and nostrils. I laid the useless knife on my bedside table. It was one
of those cheap, blunt ones that airlines used for meals before 9/11, and hotels
still do. It had come with our room service tray of tropical fruits, fresh
breads and a wonderful cheese plate.

Cautiously, she blinked open her
eyelids. Her mascara had smeared into a detonation of dark streaks.

We smiled at each other.

This was a special holiday. We both
knew it. Chances were we would return to London engaged,
unless something went very wrong. I�d spent over ten years looking for �the
one�. And my numerous adverts had finally found me Misty; stunning, sexy,
fascinating, funny, bubbly, inquisitive, only 22 but adult beyond her years.

And -
obviously above all - kinky and submissive.

I turned on my side and ran my hand
down from her smeared face, over her elegant neck, between her ample breasts,
stretching my fingers over to thumb her erect, hard nipples, then across her
flat stomach to her tousled pubic curls. We�d already done the shaved pussy
thing and now I�d let her grow it back into a luxuriant dark triangle.

I teasingly fingered her aroused
clit.

She gasped and tilted her head back
fractionally. �Facial rapes� never failed to get Misty going.

�You want to come, baby ?�

Her eyes rolled gently.

�Please ��

I glanced over at the clock. 

18:59. Movie time
! She loves it when I deny her release. Makes her
do all sorts of things to earn it.

I pulled away from Misty�s clit and ruffled her hair.

�Well, you�ll just have to wait.
Run and fetch the TV remote.�

&nbsp;

*** *** ***

&nbsp;

The year was 1859.

Exciting times. Around the globe, the French Navy�s �La Gloire�
was being launched as the world�s first ocean-going ironclad warship, Oregon
had been admitted as the 33rd US State and John Brown�s raid on
Harper�s Ferry in Virginia was about to signal a general slave rebellion and
thus indirectly trigger a Civil War in America.

Meanwhile, in Second Mate Wallis�s
home port of London, the great bell Big Ben had just chimed for the first time, and the
British Naturalist Charles Darwin was putting the finishing touches to his book
�The Origin of Species�.

In the Spring
of that year, a Merchant Packet Ship, The �Descendant�, had left Southampton, pausing in Lisbon, and it was
now on its way to Port Elizabeth in South
  Africa, carrying a
cargo of equipment, dry goods, port wine, and a small number of passengers,
brave or foolhardy enough to make the journey.

They included the aforementioned
honeymooners Sir Rufus and Lady Rigby and the good knight�s younger sister,
Rose, whom he was escorting south to join up with her fianc�, Major Seaton of
the British Army. The other three passengers were all male, all ordinary, and
shortly never to be heard of again.

The �Descendant� was an honest
merchant ship of sturdy construction, with three officers, namely Captain
Bates, First Mate Lubbock and Second Mate Wallis. Her crew comprised a cook, a
carpenter, a boatswain, 11 able seamen and 12 ordinary seamen. Plus one Ship�s Boy.

Like most of her journeys, this one
had been uneventful so far. She rode out the few storms, negotiated the
Doldrums, and was making good time in a strong breeze for Port Elizabeth when
disaster struck.

Just before dawn on the morning
after Second Mate Wallis had spied on the happy couple making love in their
quarters, the ship shuddered to a halt with an ear splitting crash.

The �Descendant� had become
helplessly impaled on an uncharted rock. Her hull was opened up as completely
as Grommet�s throat might have been by the Second Mate�s blade. Seawater gushed
into the engine room and then a freak wave twisted the knife, condemning the
ship to the depths.

There was only sufficient time to
launch two of her three lifeboats. The First Mate, three passengers and eight
of the crew clambered into the first.

The Second Mate, three passengers
and another eight crew had a few moments to gather
some equipment and belongings before jumping into the second.

Captain Bates himself went down
honourably with his ship, while the remaining crew flailed in the foaming water
until the sharks put an end to their suffering.

A century and more later, the �Descendant� had become one of South Africa�s ten most popular diving wrecks.

&nbsp;

It is not known what happened to
the first lifeboat. There is no historical record of a First Mate called Lubbock surviving
nor any of other the three passengers who climbed into his boat.

But the second lifeboat made it to
land. Of sorts.

It drifted for 30 hours, as the
ocean swell raged, then dwindled into steady rollers under a gentle rain.
Inside the boat the ten men and two women huddled dejectedly on the floor. The
men stared at their feet glumly and the traumatised women wept, then slept.

Wallis surveyed the motley crew and
decided he was �Second Mate� no more. The Captain had gone down and Wallis
doubted he would ever set eyes on the First Mate again. He studied the sole
male passenger, Sir Rufus, and surmised that any leadership skills the man
might have were suited to shiny redcoats, cavalry charges and a formal military
structure.

No, in this situation, Wallis
was definitely in charge.

Mid-afternoon on the second day,
young Grommet, taking his turn as watch, spied a solitary island. It emerged
slowly from below the endless horizon, until they could all make out a
silhouette resembling a fat man floating on his back in the water.

As they drew closer, Wallis saw
there was a mountain rising like a paunch, covered in lush foliage, and a
second smaller hill reminiscent of a head, with sandy beaches and palm trees
fringing the entire island.

Without consulting anybody, he
formally assumed command.

�To starboard.� He bellowed, peering into the crystal clear waters for any sign of
rocks as they navigated to shore.

His lifeboat crew comprised several
of his best mates; Greaser, Donkey and Stoker from the boiler room, and Limey
Jack, an able Seaman. Only �Doc�, who was the Ship�s Cook, and the old
carpenter and another crewman were unknown quantities.
Grommet, the Ship�s Boy would do as he was told. The men paddled using the two
oars combined with other bits of equipment to row the longboat towards the
shoreline.

The three passengers, Sir Rufus,
Lady Helen, and Rose huddled in the back of the boat and behaved as if they
still believed they were paying passengers. Wallis growled.

�You !� he
snapped at Sir Rufus. �Get your head down that side of the boat and look out
for rocks.�

The pompous, carrot-topped, freckled
face looked up at him aghast.

�Do it. Now.�
Wallis roared, snarling until the man obeyed.

Carefully, they made it ashore and
beached the longboat.

&nbsp;

Wallis, accompanied by Greaser, the
engine room oiler, took a tour of the island. It
covered a few square miles and was almost completely surrounded by white sandy
beach. They managed to use their cutlasses to hack through the scrub forest
that covered most of the inland ridge and there, to their immense relief, was a
natural spring stream running along the side of the mountain. They also spied a
few goats, rabbits and a mass of wild berries.

As they were walking back to the
beach to convey the good news to the other members of the party, they spotted
the two women who had removed their sodden dresses and were drying them behind
a clump of rocks. They were sharing a woollen blanket that Lady Helen had
produced from her sack of possessions.

Greaser exchanged glances with
Wallis.

Both men smiled stained and gap
toothed grins.

&nbsp;

But there was no rush. At first there
was too much to do.

Wallis organised them into pairs to
perform the most suitable roles.

The carpenter had brought a few of
his tools with him in the lifeboat. He and a crewman set to work constructing a
shelter.

Greaser and Donkey collected wood
for the hut and also built a fire.

Stoker and Limey Jack strung bows
and cut arrows, with flint tips, and took them and the cutlasses to catch food.

Wallis and Doc completed a thorough
inventory of everything they possessed; each individual crewman�s possessions
and the general supplies from the boat; knives, bowls, rope, needles, thread,
candles, cutlery, seeds, a mariner�s clock and a compass.

And there was a single firearm that
Wallis kept for himself; a fine 12-bore sidelock
hammer pigeon gun that could be used to shoot animals - or man - as required.

With water, some food, their
equipment, and luck, they had a chance of survival, as long as another ship
came by to rescue them within a few weeks, or perhaps even months.

In the meantime, Wallis studiously
ignored the three �passengers�. Their fare had run out when the ship went down.

Now they were on their own !

&nbsp;

That first meal of goat and
berries, and freshwater, tasted as good as any ship�s rations. The men stood
around in a circle, grinning as the bloody meat soiled their straggly beards
and rags.

Eventually Sir Rufus approached.

�Er � may
we � join you ?�

Wallis looked at him coldly. �You
want to share ?�

�Yes, rather.�

�Sure.� He said eventually. �We�ll
all share everything then.�

Wallis watched him start to pull
off a leg of goat meat to take it over to the two women huddled together thirty
yards away.

�Nah. Tell them to come over here, nice and warm like, by the fire.�

The man�s eyes sparked in the
firelight. �But they are not dressed properly !�

There was a tense hush. All of the
crewmen had stopped eating.

Wallis allowed ten, fifteen awkward
and menacing seconds to pass before he replied.

�No. They�re not are they ? Okay, you take them some food. Tonight.�

&nbsp;

The next morning, Wallis pulled the
old carpenter over to one side.

�Choice, old
timer. You for me or against me
?�

The old man�s rheumy eyes glanced
at him. He didn�t need to speak. The eyes said �for�.

Wallis drew with a stick in the
sand. He smiled.

�Can you build these.
Nice and sturdy ?�

The carpenter nodded silently.

&nbsp;

The second evening, they had found
wild yams and Greaser had fashioned a harpoon with which he had speared a fish.
Alongside a rabbit and more berries, it was a veritable feast.

Rufus approached again.

�I�d be ever so grateful ��

Wallis interrupted him.

�Bring them over here.�

�But ��

�They don�t come here, then none of you eat.�

With a gulp, Sir Rufus Digby turned around. Wallis spat out a fishbone. Take
these pompous lords and ladies out of their fancy houses with no servants and
see how they cope.

Slowly the two young women in their
sun-dried dresses came over with their chaperone.

Wallis scratched behind his ear.

Lady Helen and young Rose
hesitantly stepped into the circle around the campfire. The crewmen took just a
step or two back, no more.

�Last night,� Wallis said, grinning
at Sir Rufus, �we all agreed to share everything, right ?�

�Well ��

Without warning, Wallis seized Lady
Helen by her collar. There was a shout of approval from his men and an
anguished groan from Sir Rufus. Rose screamed and tried to run from the
enclosure of burly men but she was caught by Limey Jack, who had been ready, on
account of the sign Wallis had given by scratching his ear.

�Well, then you are going to share
your wife with us !� Wallis announced over the
tumult, hurling Lady Helen down into the sand, ripping her dress.

�Noooo��
Sir Rufus roared, charging, but a cudgel blow to the head knocked him
unconscious. When he awoke, the world would never be the same again.

Son of a Gun

Part Two

&nbsp;

by Velvetglove

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

They waited the necessary few
minutes until Rufus had regained consciousness. By which time however, he had
been tied between two sturdy wooden posts that the carpenter had buried deep
into the sand.

His own clothes had been ripped
from his pale body and then strips of rags torn from them, soaked in seawater,
were used to tie his wrists and ankles to the posts, leaving him spread eagled
and totally naked. His shrivelled penis hung down limply in a tangle of ginger hair.

Next to him, his screaming,
frantic, 21 year old sister Rose was tied in exactly the same dire predicament,
except that the strips tying her had also been made of her dear brother�s
clothes. She had been left wearing her creased and soiled dress. For now.

Meanwhile, Lady Helen,
was staked out in an �x� on the sand, her delicate wrists and ankles tied to
four wooden pegs, and her upturned, sobbing face was almost directly underneath
her husband�s widespread feet. Her feet were near the fire so that its crackling warmth and light could cast a special glow on
the forthcoming event.

Wallis finished chewing casually on
a rabbit bone and gestured for his men to all kneel in the sand either side of
Lady Helen, so close they could reach out and touch her when the moment was
right. They arranged themselves so as to leave two gaps, one for the flickering
firelight to pass through, and the other to allow Sir Rufus an unencumbered
view.

Wallis wandered over to Lady
Helen�s husband, leaning into his ear.

�I�m not an unreasonable man �
Rufus.� He made a point of leaving off the man�s title. �Back home was your world.
But this is my island, and so you will learn to call me King Wallis. And
on my island, we all share and share alike. So, when you want to share your
wife with us, you can. But from now on you rank the lowest of all the males
here.�

Wallis looked round and smiled.
�Yes, even lower than young Grommet there, the Ship�s Lad. Once he�s had his
regular daily turn on your missus, if you ask nicely, you can follow him. Is
that understood ?�

Wallis paused calmly to wipe the
saliva off his face. Rufus had turned his head and spat a thick, insolent wad.

He shrugged. �You will regret that,
I assure you. You see, I only brought a few things off the ship with me. But one
of them is being held by my mate Greaser there.�

The gormless and disfigured crewman
held up a six feet long, leather �cat �o nine tails�.

�So I shall fuck your missus and,
when I�m through, then I�ll flog a little sense into you while we both watch
our friends here enjoying a little party.�

&nbsp;

Wallis took his time gutting every
last shred of dress and undergarment from Helen. She wailed and cried, and
twisted and writhed, as all around her hungry male faces grinned down. Hands
and fingers curled out round her young and perfect, ample breasts as they
flopped and jerked, while foul breath enveloped her face and nostrils.

Wallis splayed open her labia with
his left hand, lifting his index finger to taste. She was salty from washing in
seawater.

Salty and
tight. 

It had been a long time since he
had fucked anyone so young and never so fancy and flawless.

He was 44. Never married although
he had a couple of �wives� in ports he no longer visited. A sailor�s life was
not suited to romance and he had spent more evenings with loose women and even
looser whores than he cared to remember. Maybe it was time to settle down ?

In truth, it was Rose, the other
lass he preferred, more for her demure attitude and manner than any advantage
in looks. Both women were lovely.

He could tell this one had barely
been fucked.� Probably
a virgin right until her wedding night. Her mound was covered in a
pretty triangle of brown hair, her tender flesh brackish, soft and sandy; her
cunt bone dry.

He let a drool of his saliva curl
down from between his moustache and beard to land between her thighs. Then he
sensuously worked the fingers of his left hand to smear it up inside her.

Finally, taking a moment to grin up
at Rufus, he crouched over her and eased his stiff, engorged helmet into the
entrance to her cunt. It had been a long frustrating voyage after Lisbon and
especially since the moment he had watched this minx in her cabin with her
husband.

The crew�s raucous cheer was even
louder than the terrible wails and groans from all three passengers as Wallis
plunged his arse downwards and sunk himself up to the hilt inside her mutinous
but helpless flesh.

&nbsp;

*** *** ***

&nbsp;

�Where do you reckon they come from ?� Misty asked.

We were sat on our balcony, staring
out at the sea and sky, two virtually identical shades of blue, one sparkling,
the other cloudless.

�You know,� she continued, �your
dominant drive, my sub feelings.�

It was a question we�d touched on a
few times in the past, in different ways, never probing too deep. I�m no
psychoanalyst. I mean, it�s interesting, in a way, but ultimately no more
significant than why I prefer wine to whisky or big tits to poached eggs. We
all are who we are. She liked to ask a lot of questions. I liked to humour her.
For a while.

�Nature or
nurture.� I replied, sipping my coffee. �I
suspect it�s a bit of both. I must have been born with a natural predisposition
to sexual dominance and I expect things in my life have developed that innate
urge more fully. Not that I�ve a damn clue what those things were. Same for you,
in reverse, I guess.�

She was silent a moment, enjoying
the sunny South African morning and endless horizon. I caught her lovely
profile, with classic bone structure and a delicate jaw, softly framed by her
mane of hair, tumbling over the towelling white robe she was wearing.

�But have you ever thought if your
parents were the same ? Or one of them
? Or a grandparent ? Maybe my grandma
desperately wanted to be spanked, say, and be forced to give sluttish
blowjobs.�

I chuckled, enjoying her laughter
as much as the idea.

�Do you know much about your
ancestors, Ben ?� she asked.

I shrugged, ignoring her cheeky use
of my nickname.

�No more than I�ve told you before,
really. We are originally Scottish or English. Apparently Gunn is a name that
exists in both countries. And Norway too, for that matter. But somebody emigrated to South Africa in the middle of the last century. It was only during apartheid
that my parents moved back to UK, where
I was born.�

She took my coffee cup and got up
to refill it.

�There you are.� She replied
triumphantly. �Somebody ! You said somebody emigrated to South Africa. It�s strange how the most important people in the world to us are
our own children, our parents, our grandchildren and grandparents. Yet travel
just a few generations forwards or back and we don�t give them any thought. I
mean, your great-great-grandparents, say, and you don�t know anything about
them, or care !�

I looked at her. Her robe had
slipped open revealing a tit.

�Don�t worry.� She continued,
sitting back down. �I�m the same. That�s the problem with the future though.
Things like Government Debt and Global Warming. If it were our own
great-grandchildren we specifically thought about having to pay for our current
borrowing or pollution, we�d care more. Yet somehow just a few generations
ahead and our�
bloodline ceases being important to us. A few generations back
and we don�t care what terrible things might have happened to our forbears.�

I looked at her again. I had other
things on my mind. She was correct. Go back 150, 200 years and, right, I didn�t
give a shit. But she was on a roll. Only one way to shut her
up.

I pulled my robe apart. I was rock
hard.

She was about to continue her
diatribe. Her green eyes glanced down and she didn�t speak. Her mouth made an empty
�pop� as the word died in her throat. We had a rule.� 

She jumped out of her chair as
elegantly as a cat and dropped to the balcony floor at my feet, her head
rubbing gently against my inner thighs.

I felt my guts churning the
breakfast I�d eaten and coffee I�d drunk.

But I slapped my erection against
her cheek.

Time to see
exactly how much my girlfriend wanted me.

&nbsp;

*** *** ***

&nbsp;

Rufus hung in his bonds, his chin
lolling forwards onto his chest. By the standards of the mid-nineteenth century
fleet, it had not been a brutal flogging. But a cat is a cat and, applied to
the soft flesh of an aristocrat, it was highly effective.

The crew laughed as the lashes soon
changed the arrogant passenger�s tune; one minute cursing and blinding them,
the next sobbing and begging them to do as they all they wished with his lovely
lady.

Wallis gave him �nine nines� across
the back; nine strokes with nine tails based on the trinity of trinities that
all good Christian sailors considered a harbinger of good fortune, then a further
three strokes across his front. With his back shredded, the vicious leather
opened up the young man�s stomach, groin and genitals ensuring that it would be
weeks before he could bear to touch himself there, even for the purposes of his
own relief.

Meanwhile, in keeping with the
numeric symmetry, the hapless Helen endured nine fucks. Her
own �trinity of trinities�. After Wallis had finished with her, the
other eight crewmembers lustily followed him. It is likely that, in different
circumstances, one or two of the individual men might not have so dishonoured a
lady. But a combination of mob mentality, certain death if they objected, and
the appetite engendered by a long sea voyage, overcame any misgivings they
might have felt. The last to go was young Grommet, the embarrassed but visibly
excited Ship�s Lad.

�Another round ?�
Greaser asked Wallis afterwards with a leer.

The ugliest member of the engine
crew had insinuated himself into the position of Wallis�s deputy. He was sinewy
but strong, with puckered skin down one side of his face and torso, from an
engine fire many years earlier. He looked stupid yet had uneducated cunning.

�Help yourself.� Wallis replied,
shrugging. �She has to learn to satisfy all her new �husbands� properly
so she might as well start now.�

�What about the other lass ?� Greaser nodded at Rose.

Wallis turned. �King�s
privilege, my friend. For a while.�

Greaser made a disapproving face
with his skewed lips turned down, as if to object, but catching sight of
Wallis�s glare, he merely grinned.

�Suppose there�s no problem us all
sharing just one woman if she can�t ever say no.�

Wallis nodded magnanimously.

&nbsp;

The first round had been a quick
gang rape; an impatient flurry of dick after dick buried in the increasingly
soupy mixture between Helen�s parted thighs, punctuated by frantic grunts,
groans, moans and �aaahhhs�.

Steadily all resistance was pounded
out of her and she lay deadpan in her bonds, mouth gasping quietly for breath
like a landed fish dying on deck, eyes glazing over.

The second round was more
leisurely. Relieved of their heavy loads, the men were able to enjoy it more,
encouraging each other, patient and good humoured, as each casually took his
turn. The only thing missing was a keg of rum. This time they were gentler too,
taking their weight on their elbows, allowing Helen to breathe, although she
appeared only half-conscious in the firelight. They drove their erections into
her at different speeds and angles, cheered on by their mates, in the misguided
impression that somehow their skills could make the act more enjoyable for the
young lady.

Eventually she became so sodden and
slack that the last few men could not get sufficient purchase to reach orgasm.
After some frustrated banging away the men climbed astride her chest and
masturbated themselves over her face, hair and into the sand.

After the second round had finished
and each man curled up round the fire to sleep, they left her tied in an �x�,
with a blanket thrown over her. During the night, several times, various men woke
and took their third turn with the woman who had once been Lady Helen Rigby.

&nbsp;

The next morning, she was marched
naked down to the sea to wash in the salty breakers. Greaser had knotted a rope
round her neck and he held her like a bitch on a leash as she wiped her body
clean as best she could.

Next she was put to work. She was
made to perform the menial duties around the shelter and camp; clearing up the
bones and detritus from the evening meal and arranging the pile of wood into a
new campfire for later.

The men also washed themselves in
the sea, hunted and cut trees, but they still had time for lying under palm
fronds and relaxing.

Greaser used his knife to carve a
rota into the trunk of a tree; each notch represented an hour�s segment of the
day. He cut nineteen notches to represent eighteen �one hour slots�. The
remaining six hours of darkness were reserved for Helen to sleep.

Each man drew twigs of different
lengths to rank them in order. Then, the nine of them chose one available
�early slot� from dawn to early afternoon, and one �late slot� from afternoon
to midnight.

As soon as the rota had been
finished and initials carved into the palm tree, the brass ship�s clock was
placed under it as the official timepiece.

With a whoop, Limey Jack clicked
his fingers at Helen to let her know she was his �wife� for the remainder of
that hour.

She wailed in despair and started
to shiver, then beg, to no avail.

Fucking was all very well but Limey
had a penchant for a woman�s mouth. Using a clump of her hair as a handle and
his other palm to slap encouragement into her face, he taught her the rudiments
of oral sex.

It was only the first of many times
Helen would learn that lesson.

Naturally, it had been a long time
since most of the crew had visited Senhora Amizade�s friendly bordello in Lisbon during the
stopover. Her raddled putas were experienced and
cheap but they didn�t compare with the lovely young English aristocrat who was
inexperienced and free.

For many women coping with one horny
husband is a challenge enough. But life for Helen was to become one long relay
race. No sooner had she satisfied the amorous attentions of one of her
admirers, than another rigid baton full of stamina was lovingly placed in her
palm.

&nbsp;

Meanwhile, that first morning,
Rufus hung where he had been tied, in the searing midday sun. The
rays had broiled his pale skin to a bright lobster red. Saltwater had been used
to cleanse his wounds and now his lips were parched and cracked. In agony, he
had croaked his eternal allegiance to �King Wallis� who was considering his
apology, along with that of his younger sister Rose�s.

Wallis himself was lying under a
shady tree, a few hundred yards from the rest of the camp. He had begun to
create his own �King�s Quarters� separate from the main camp. He had a good
view of Rufus, and of the crew enjoying themselves with Helen. But the view
that particularly interested him at that moment was only a few feet away.

Rose Rigby, fianc�
of Major Seaton, hung by her delicate wrists from the horizontal branch of a
gnarled baobab tree. She was naked except for her creased and soiled dress and,
underneath it, her drawers.

Wallis lay whittling a long stick
into a cane with his knife. The cat was good for the likes of Rufus but the
ladies required a more subtle instrument. Eventually the thirty inches long
cane had been trimmed to his satisfaction.

He stood up and planted his feet
directly in front of her. He was naked but for a torn shirt he had fashioned
into a loin cloth round his ample girth.

�Rose. We can do this the easy way,
or the hard way, my dear.�

She whimpered, seemingly too
terrified to speak.

�Cat got your tongue
?� he smiled. �The cat certainly took away your brother�s tongue.�

�Please ��

He raised his knife to the top of
her dress. Her breasts were smaller than Helen�s but not by much. The pleated
fabric crushed them together exaggerating her cleavage.

�One way, you get to be a Queen.�
He said. �The other, a whore.�

�No. Please. I beg you Sir ��

He grinned, revealing his stained
and gapped teeth. �Well, that�s a start, lass. You�ll be doing plenty of
begging whichever way.�

With a skilled twist of his blade
he popped the top button of her dress and opened up a breach. With barely a
pause, he carved downwards slicing the fabric to her navel.

�Let�s have a look shall we ?�

He tucked the knife in his belt and
seized each side of her dress with his hands, then tore it asunder, unleashing
her tits like oranges from a knocked over basket.

�Noooooo.� Tears sprang from
her eyes.

He stood back to admire her
perfection. As he suspected. For his
taste, better even than the Helen bitch.

He drew his knife and touched the
sharp point to her left tit. The shock focused her attention, dried her eyes.
She gawped at him.

�That�s better. Now, I want some
answers.�

Slowly, she exhaled and nodded.

�Are you a maiden, lass ?�

She stared, then
her eyes closed. He pushed slightly on the knife and they fluttered open.

�A maiden. I shall make myself clear. Are you a virgin ?�

She nodded.

�Are you just a legal virgin or the
real thing, lass ? Have you ever had any form
of sexual relations with any man ? Have you touched a
male organ with your fingers or mouth or any part of your body
?�

Wide-eyed, she looked at him and
nodded again.

�The real thing
?�

She stayed nodding, confirming his
dearest wish.

�Your fianc� was a patient man.�
Wallis observed with a smirk. �Just holding hands and maybe a stolen kiss, right ?�

Flushing crimson, Rose bit her lip and nodded.

Wallis let his knife wander down
her skin and then he carved open another length of her dress until it was
splayed to the top of her drawers.

With a fierce wrench he opened it
up completely until the fabric was in two separate pieces and it fell into the
sand, puddled at her feet. She stood,
arms above her head, in just the off-white undergarment around her middle.

Phew. Wallis exhaled with approval and lust. Her waspish waist and
porcelain skin were perfect. She had the kind of curved but slim body that made
one wonder exactly where a large erection was going to fit once it was inside
her. 

�Please, Sir, do not treat me so. I
am engaged. I � please ��

Wallis guffawed. �Yes, my dear, you
certainly are engaged.�

He gently eased the hem of her
undergarment down over her hips until her mound was revealed, then peeled it
over the top of her thighs, before a flash of his knife sliced the fabric in
two and he tore it off to reveal her complete nakedness.

�Dadaah !� he said, like a
conjurer finishing a trick.

Rose stood in stripped despair,
eyes rimmed with tears.

He showed her his stubby left middle
finger, licked it in front of her eyes, then lowered and inserted it between
her downy-haired cunt lips.

�Tell me, lass, do you ever masturbate ? You know, diddle yourself.�

She edged back as best she could,
avoiding his probing digit. �Nnagh !�

�No ? Really ?�

�Never S� Sir.
I assure you, on my mother�s honour, I would never do such a thing.�

Mercilessly, Wallis pushed his
finger upwards until she could resist no more and he penetrated her to the
second knuckle. Two inches or so.

He grinned and leaned forward to
nuzzle her tit in his mouth, clutching her round the bottom with his right
hand, pulling her to him.

�Aaahhh �
nooo � please �� she wailed again.

Impatient, he pulled his left hand
from her cunt and slapped her across the face, then a backhander that split her
lip.

Her head spun and she gasped but
then she suddenly became silent.

�That�s better.� He announced. �As
I said, we can do this the easy way, or the hard way. Your
marriage is off, young lady. I don�t know if you have noticed but you are stuck
on a desert fucking island. You are no longer engaged to your stupid army
officer. You are now engaged to me. Fucking King of this fucking island !! Got
that ?� he roared into her face. She winced at his rage and foul breath.

�And I�m not bloody well satisfied
with holding hands and pecking your cheek, miss. Your have a choice. Now !
Either you will willingly make love to me, your King and husband, as
often and whichever way I like. Or you will unwillingly be fucked by me and
my men as often and however we like. Do I make myself fucking clear ? Those
are your two options. Decide now.�

She shook her head, trying to clear
it, attempting to understand what she had just heard, the awful language and
dreadful images.

He picked up the cane her had
prepared earlier.

�I think a bare breasted whipping
will concentrate your mind wonderfully.�

His erection had loosened the loin
cloth he had fashioned round his gut. Unashamed, Wallis tore it off so that he
stood as naked as his �fianc� and she could see the manhood he was offering to
pleasure her with.

�No, I beg you kind Sir, have mercy
��

The whip hissed with a whoosh
through the sultry air and then smacked loudly across her flat stomach.

It took only four strokes before
she was wailing, shrieking, begging, offering herself as wife, mistress, whore,
whatever.

But Wallis was in a grim mood now.
The cane rose and descended in a fearful barrage across her upper legs, thighs,
abdomen, ribs and breasts. No blood was drawn, no flesh torn, but the light
cane turned her skin a deep crimson as it seared a livid memory into Rose�s
mind forever.

Then, before she had realised what
was happening, he was stood directly in front of her, lifting her firm buttocks
in his palms, jabbing his swollen erection between her thighs.

She gave one last heartrending wail
and then gasped as he penetrated, hitching her into a more comfortable position
for him, up on her toes. Two of his fingers penetrated her anus and he shoved
them deep. A heck of a way for a lass to lose her maidenhead.

He was so ready, so full, the
feeling so good, that it took only a few moments before he released his seed
and properly consummated their union.

Son of a Gun

Part Three

&nbsp;

by Velvetglove

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

�Question Seven.� I announced.
�Explain the phrase, to kiss the gunner�s daughter.�

I watched Misty suck seductively on
the pencil and then scribble.

It was a game we sometimes played.
I would give her �homework� and then test her on it. A sort
of �school teacher and pupil� scene.

The only thing was that a real
teacher would be rightly locked up for inflicting any of the punishments for
bad marks that I made Misty suffer when she got answers wrong
!

Not that she disliked the game. It
had the added benefit of preventing her wasting her evenings and weekends with
watching rubbish on TV or reading crappy novels. I always chose what she
watched and studied and insisted she score high marks in every test.

As a keen footballer, sailor, diver
and sportsman generally, I naturally gravitated towards improving Misty�s
understanding and knowledge of my world. Thus she had brought two books
with her on this trip; The �Complete Almanac of Football Facts� that she
had already studied and scored 87% in a test of names, dates and useless data
over 130 years of soccer history.

Now she was struggling through a
turgid but informative 350 page tome entitled �The Authoritative History and
Dictionary of World Navies; 1745-1945�.

Not, I grant you, A light read to
pack in your vacation suitcase, but much more useful than the latest thriller
or some glossy fashion magazine.

�Question Eight.� I continued.
�Where does the phrase, �no room to swing a cat come from� ?�

I smiled at her grin of recognition.
My questions were �topical� to our own interests. To �kiss the gunner�s
daughter� meant to be flogged. Sailors were lashed face down over the breech of
a gun or canon to receive the cat.

We all know that �no room to swing
a cat� describes a small space. But it doesn�t refer to a feline with four
legs. It refers to the cat of nine tails that was six feet long including the
handle and the lashes. When swung in a full arc by a man�s arm a further three
feet of space was required to flog somebody. Thus any room smaller than nine
feet by nine, was deemed as �too small to swing a cat�.

Time to move on. Here was a favourite. Popular on certain websites
and nowadays more commonly known as the Spanish Donkey. But in naval
times to �ride the Spanish Mare� meant the culprit of a crime was put astride a
boom with the stay slackened off as the ship sailed along in a strong breeze.
If the person survived the perilous ride, he was released. If he fell off �

�Question Nine. What was to ride
the Spanish Mare ?�

I checked my watch. I�d give her
twenty questions with a pass mark of twenty out of twenty. If she failed and
got even one wrong �

&nbsp;

*** *** ***

&nbsp;

Gradually, the days settled into a
routine. It became clear that the island had been visited by mankind sometime
before, which gave hope for eventual discovery. They found an empty ship�s
chest on the far side of the island and animal bones and a rusted blade from a
cookout.

Meanwhile, Wallis and the carpenter
constructed a timber �Palace� for Rose and him to live in, while the main
shelter housed Helen and her crew.

A cage was constructed for Rufus to
be tethered into during the cold nights. 

During daylight hours, the three
ex-passengers were made to earn their rations. Helen as communal skivvy and missus to her various �husbands�, including
Wallis, who often visited the main shelter to take his own turn astride her,
alongside the crew.

Rose stayed a few hundred yards
along the beach, a so-called Queen on the island but in reality a slave to her
mate, performing every demeaning and lewd duty. She was frequently threatened
with being �turned over� to the crew if she didn�t do her utmost to please
Wallis.

Meanwhile Rufus was granted the
role of the island�s �Chief Sewage Officer�, meaning he had to dig, clean and
care for the latrine system.

He had dug pits behind the fencing
built by the carpenter for the mens� privacy. There
was a tin bucket installed as a urinal and also two wooden �seats� above the
pits for more serious matters. Each morning Rufus had to empty the pits and,
escorted by two crewmen, transport the ordure to a compost heap set up in the
middle of the island.

However, the Ladies �bathroom� was
not afforded the same degree of privacy. Both women were obliged to squat over
a wooden rail set up on the beach in the open air. The men would quite often
stop their whittling or games to escort Helen down to enjoy her shame at
performing all her ablutions in public.

But it was the decree given by
Wallis on their fifth day on the island that caused the women most grief. He
declared the fresh spring water to be a rare commodity and instructed that
Helen, Rose and Rufus would quench their thirst only on �second hand� fresh
water from then on.

Thus it was that the tin bucket
urinal became the only source of drinking water for the �paying passengers�.

At first, naturally, they baulked
at the idea but, the madness of thirst being what it is, it took only a few
days to train them to slurp the fetid and sun-broiled amber nectar and be
thankful.

In time, Wallis relented and allowed
the two ladies to drink fresh water, as they steadily earned his approval by
being a good and obedient wives. Rufus survived solely
on piss until the end.

&nbsp;

Each day, men took turns at the
watch in a crow�s nest constructed in the roof of the baobab tree that gave a
360 degrees view of the horizon. They had constructed a bonfire to light in the
event that the mast of a ship was espied in the distance.

Needless to say, the three
�passengers� were caught between a sharp rock and a very hard place. The �rock�
was staying on the island but alive. The �hard place� was
knowing that if a ship did appear it was unlikely all of them
would be allowed to live.

&nbsp;

Two months into the daily and
nightly orgies, during which Helen lay on a coarse blanket on the sand and received
all her husbands one after the other, she awoke one
day and was sick. The next morning she was sick again. On the third day, the
crew knew enough for it not to be a coincidence.

Their communal wife was going to
have their child.

&nbsp;

*** *** ***

&nbsp;

Misty held up her glass.

�Cheers !�
I said, holding my own champagne.

She stared at hers. This was a
first; drinking my urine. I had pissed over her several times in the shower
before but never in her open mouth. Now the moment had come. But rather than
pee my fresh and frothy brew between her lips I had wanted to crank up the
challenge. So my darker, dawn urine had stood in the room�s mini bar all day
and it was now cold and stale and, frankly, extremely unappetising.

Meanwhile I had ordered a bottle of
South African fizz and a plate of cheese nibbles for myself before dinner.

�Cheers.� She replied
unenthusiastically.

Why is it that seeing somebody
swallow your piss gives such a sexual buzz ? After
all, it�s not like your dick is in their cunt, or mouth or arse. You are not
connected to them by any direct sensations. I guess that�s why the �vanilla
crowd� don�t rate it. Their lovemaking is all just touchy-feely.

I studied her as she lifted the
glass to her lips.

�Not in one, baby. I want you to
savour it. Sip it. Taste it.�

I took a small swallow from my own
glass, swishing the bubbles across my tongue noisily.

�Delish !�
I murmured.

She tilted her head back slightly
and sipped. I watched a dollop of my liquid waste enter her mouth and
disappear. Her nostrils betrayed her, flaring with distaste, just as her green
eyes glinted with excited shame.

�Delish.� She echoed hollowly.

I waited until she repeated the
cycle, tilting, sipping, swallowing, several times.

�Please tell me that�s
unpleasant.� I said.

She grimaced. �You want the truth ?�

�Oh yes. One
hundred per cent.�

�It�s horrible. Chilled, but I can
still taste the brine. I can�t decide if it would be worse hot and fresh or
like this.�

�Don�t worry,
you�ll get the chance to compare.�

She stuck out her tongue, not
insolently, just in silent, obedient reply.

�It thrills me that you will do
this.� I said.

She took another, longer slug, her
glass now less than half full.

�Well that�s all I ask for then.�
She replied.

I reached for the jug. �Here, let
me top you up.�

&nbsp;

*** *** ***

&nbsp;

Helen was five months pregnant when
she heard the shout from the top of the boabab tree.

She was down on all fours in the
sand so that the man called Limey Jack could fuck her from behind, now that her
belly was swollen.

�Ship Ahoooooyyy !�

And even then, instantly, she
feared for her life, and Rufus and Rose. And above all for
the life of her unborn child. She knew already she would offer anything
for her and her offspring to be allowed to live.

She felt Limey Jack jerking his
slippery thing out of her and running to join in with the shouts and frantic
waving. There was a crackle of arid wood and seconds later the bonfire tower
burst into flames.

Then she caught sight of the blur
of Wallis running down the beach towards them all, dragging Rose after him.
Rufus�s sister was two months behind Helen and her stomach had only just
started to show. And at least Rose knew who the father of her child was.

�She�s turning !�
came the next euphoric cry from the crowd of men behind her, clustered on the
shore. �She�s seen us !!!!�

It was only now that he was close
enough to them that Helen�s eyesight was able to focus on Second Mate Wallis
clearly.

He was carrying the gun.

&nbsp;

*** *** ***

&nbsp;

We are both lying on the beach,
dripping seawater, sweat and suncream onto the edges
of our books. I am enjoying the late afternoon Southern Hemisphere sun and
flicking through Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson. It�s an old copy that Misty found in
some second hand bookshop in England
and brought out here with her. She has inscribed inside it �To my Master and
Lover, Ben, with all my love, March 2007.�

Ben isn�t my real name, of course.
But when I began my internet dating career in search of submissive women, the
moniker I chose was �Ben�. It�s been my nickname since I started at
school. With a family name of Gunn and my liking for cheese, it didn�t take a
particularly sharp schoolboy to come up with �Ben Gunn�, after the character
marooned on Treasure Island.

Of course, �Misty� isn�t her
real name either. �Shrouded in the mists� was the name that Mary chose as her
internet moniker. Our first emails and phonecalls
were all done from Ben to Misty and vice versa. Her name has kinda stuck, especially when there�s just the two of us.

She is lying next to me now, her
arm on her forehead shielding her eyes from the rays, studying the dreaded �Authoritative
History and Dictionary of World Navies; 1745-1945�. Occasionally she reads
me titbits.

Tomorrow I am planning another test
on the second half of the tome.

She looks over at me quizzically.

�Can I read you something interesting ?�

�Sure.� I close my own book and
pull my sunglasses off my nose. They are prescription lenses to bring things in
the distance into sharp focus. My family�s all got slightly dodgy eyesight.

�Have you ever considered this ? Apparently, the term �son of a gun� comes from a time
when women were allowed on ships and if they gave birth at sea it was usually
in the wider part of the ship, under the big midship
gun.�

Her green eyes squint over at me,
and she�s smiling.

�So ?�

�Well, if paternity was uncertain,
the child would be entered in the ship�s log as the �son of a gun�.�

She�s giggling now, mischievously.

�So ?�

�Well do you think there�s any chance
that�s where your family name Gunn comes from ?�

Sonofabitch ! I mull over her comment for a
full five seconds.

�Are you by any chance calling me a
bastard, Misty Shrouds at yahoo dot com ?� I
ask, putting down my book and sunglasses in the sand and preparing to give
chase.

�I guess so, Big Ben at hotmail dot
com. In fact, a complete and utter bastard !�

And with that she is off,
scrambling along the beach, and I�m after her, knowing that when I catch her
will be �the moment�.

The moment I will
ask her to become the newest member of the Gunn family tree.

&nbsp;
