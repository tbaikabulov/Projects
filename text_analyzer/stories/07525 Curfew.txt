Synopsis: 






This story takes place After my other story, "Auction". You don't have to read that one first but it gives a backround. Thanks!



He signed on line from work, tired after a long day and quickly angered when he saw she was on line. She was up past her curfew Again. Not only was she up but she was on chat as well.. which was breaking yet Another part of her curfew. No... he wasn't going to tolerate it. "Now Kitten. Be in position when I get home." he typed, not even saying hello, and saying nothing else but waited for her to sign off which she did instantly, and turned his computer off to finish things in his office before going to deal with his disobedient slave.

* * *

She signed off right away ashamed at disobeying her Master. She placed her wrist and ankle cuffs neatly on Masters bed and grabbed her leash. She moved to the front door, off to the side and knelt, naked save for her thin leather collar, sitting back on her heels with her knees spread, laid her leash neatly in front of her without attaching it, clasped her hands behind her back and bowed her head, waiting for her Master to come home with her punishment.

* * *

He calmed his anger on his way home from work. He pulled in and walked in the front door, immediately seeing his disobedient slave kneeling in front of him where he ordered. He took his coat off and hung it himself, not permitting her to get up and help him. He walked past, ignoring her and went to get a cup of coffee he smelt brewing. He was slightly pacified when he saw she had brewed a new pot for him. He sat at the table, sipping his coffee, watching her, knowing she would feel his stare and waiting to see if she would move.

* * *

She knelt feeling a little pain when he did not allow her to help him, completely ignoring her. She wondered how long it would be, how long he would leave her there without acknowledging her. She stayed there, unmoving as she felt his eyes digging into her naked back. Eventually she heard his footsteps moving towards his bedroom. "Come." he said. She stood and bent to pick up her leash. "Leave it." he stated. She hesitated, wanting her leash but stood with her head bowed and walked past him into his room. She stopped in the middle of the room looking at her cuffs on the bed. He saw where her eyes were, glanced over at her cuffs and back at her. He put his hand under her chin and raised it up for her to look at him, purposely not using her collar to raise her face. "You really think I would allow you your cuffs after you've misbehaved and disobeyed me yet Again? You're sadly mistaken." he said, let go of her, and grabbed her wrist pulling her towards the door across the room......

* * *

He led her through the door, into the private "office" that had been converted into their Playroom, only accessible through his bedroom. He knew she wouldn't enjoy her punishment. She hated being left alone and was slightly claustrophobic. "No, she will not enjoy this, not at all." he thought, as he pulled her further into the room.

* * *

She was pulled by her Master into their Playroom. She scanned the room with her eyes lowered, wondering how her Master was going to punish her. He was silent. That did Not bode well. He pulled her over to a corner of the room they had never used before... for all that it Wasn&#8217;t empty..... the cage was over there.. the small cage, large enough for her to sit, even to curl up on the floor. It was made of metal, and had a large, ominous lock on the door. "no...no no no no No" she thought, resisting against his pull instantly as soon as she saw what they were headed for. He turned and pulled her closer to him, grabbing both of her arms. "You&#8217;ve disobeyed me. Again. Other punishments haven&#8217;t seemed to work, for you Keep disobeying me, ignoring the rules I give at your whim. Its Not acceptable. Its going to stop Now, whether you remain mine or not."&nbsp; With that he spun her around and unbuckled her collar, removing it. It was the first time her neck had ever been completely bare since he had bought her at that auction. She froze, instantly felt alone and afraid, not knowing what was happening. She didn&#8217;t resist as he pulled her the rest of the way, stood perfectly still as he opened the metal door. He gestured for her to get in but she just stood there shaking with tears beginning to run down her face. ".........Now Kitten. I'm not going to repeat myself." he stated, watching her. She knelt, trembling, and crawled into cage. As soon as she did he shut the door behind her and twisted the noisy lock closed again. She turned around and pulled her knees up to her chest hugging herself as she cried. He walked away and stood at the door of the Playroom for a moment, just staring at her blankly. She watched him through blurred eyes as he turned and left, seeing him pick up her cuffs in one hand, her collar dangling in the other as he turned back and shut the door, cutting off the last thing she had connecting to anything. She curled up unable to stop crying, terrified he would give her up, wouldn&#8217;t love her, or want her anymore.

* * *

He walked out of the room and settled down in his den. He had taken her collar off with a heavy heart. He didn&#8217;t Want to. But she didn&#8217;t deserve it at this time. In no way was she being the Kitty she knew he expected of her. He went to his locked cabinet and took out a package he had planned to gift her with. A new set of cuffs, thinner, more delicate ones, a soft silver instead of the leather. They would form to her perfectly. They were engraved with delicate roses and vines on the front, the other side, the side closest to the Inside of the body.. was engraved with their names. Under their names was a small keyhole for them to be taken on and off. These weren't meant to be taken off. These were for Permanence. Once these went on.. they weren't coming off again. Not if he could help it. If she showed she could learn... showed she was sorry... truly sorry... he would keep her and she would be his forever. If not............. he didn't want to think about "if not". After three hours he slowly walked back into their Playroom. He walked over to the cage, not hearing a sound. He crouched down and saw his lovely little slave curled up into a tight ball on the floor of the cage, arms wrapped around her and tear tracks running all over her face. He unlocked the door, opened it, left a note and walked back out.

* * *

She woke up to the sounds of his footsteps. She was scared to look up and see his disappointed face again. After a few minutes she willed herself to open her eyes and look for him. He wasn&#8217;t there. Instead she saw both the door to the cage and the Playroom wide open. And a note laying next to her with a single rose next to it. She picked up the rose, smelling its beauty. She picked up the note and read it: "Kitten.. you&#8217;ve disobeyed me much. But I love you. If you want to leave, I will allow you. You don&#8217;t even have to say it. Merely give me the rose back. If not, and you still love me, still wish to remain my dear submissive, my Kitten, my slave, my Love.... then come to me." She crawled out of the cage slowly, standing on unsteady legs. She waited a moment, walked out of the Playroom and placed the rose on the dresser. She slowly found her way through the house, walking into the den in search of her beloved Master. And there he sat.. on his chair, waiting for her, tense. She kept her head bowed without looking up at him and walked up to him. "Kitty?" he said, with question in his voice. She looked up at him and nodded once slowly, knowing what he meant. He didn&#8217;t say it.. but his voice asked if she was okay, if she was unhurt, and lastly... if she was still his Kitten he loved so much. She was. She was his slave. She'd love him forever. She knelt in front of his chair. "No kitty.. up here." he said, and leaned over to raise her up. She stood and sat down on his lap almost tensely. "Kitten........" he said. She looked up to see his arms spread wide, welcoming her. She teared up, curled up against him and sobbed into his chest, letting all the hurting go. He held her tight, rocking her, comforting her as she cried. As her tears slowed dried, and her breath slowed, he stated quietly, "I love you Kitty."

* * *

He held her and rocked her as she sobbed out her fears and insecurities into his shoulder. He rested his chin on the top of her head and rubbed her back, proud of how well she handled her punishment, knowing it was extremely difficult for her. He just sat there, holding her as she finally began to calm down again, loving her more than ever as she gave even more of herself to him. He pushed you back slightly as her breathing calmed and reattached her collar. He took her leash from his pocket and locked it back onto her collar. He held it right where it was attached and pulled her close to kiss her forehead. He stood, placed her feet on the ground, tugging her collar once to be sure she would follow. He walked across the room and motioned for her to sit on the couch, placing the end of her leash in her hand. As she sat, he when to his closet and pulled out an elegant box. He walked back, sat next to his slave and opened the box for her to see, smiling as he saw her eyes light up with pleasure.

* * *

He woke up with his slave tucked in his arms against his chest. He felt her smooth, warm skin against his and dipped his head to kiss her shoulder. As he leaned up on his arm to allow his eyes to caress her she turned slightly and rolled, so he got to see her long slender back, moving until she was on her other side, and he let his eyes roam over her slender, firm stomach, the long, lithe arms, her toned legs. Her perk, firm breasts and smooth nipples waiting to be sucked. But he didn't take them into his mouth. Instead he stared at her face, seeing the ease on it, the slight smile. He lowered his eyes to see her collar. His collar, the sign of His ownership, His protection, His love for this special, unique slave of his. It was perfect for her. He was glad he took to her preference and picked the thin collar, instead of a thicker, sturdier one. This was Her. It was perfect for his slave. His eyes now drifted down to her wrists, her ankles. His new gift lay there. The lovely cuffs he had made specially for his Kitten. He had designed them himself. Took All he knew of her into account and came out with this gift, which was Just right for her. They were a sign of all he was for her, all she gave to him with her submission. Showing that he would Always be there for her, that she would always be His, A promise, from her to remember to share things with him. He would not have his Kitten have a load so heavy without sharing it. He would not have her stressed, or upset, at least not without him knowing all and helping her as much as he could. She was his Kitten. If it was in his power she would Never be upset again. She rolled onto her back, beginning to awake. He leaned over and began kissing her softly. Soft lingering kisses spreading over her chest, stomach, arms, back to her chest and finally her face as she slowly opened her eyes to see him hovering over her and smiled lovingly up at him. "Good morning love" he said as he leaned down and kissed her lips soft and long, the kiss of a lover with the knowledge of a sweet beloved Master. "If only everyday could start like this",&nbsp; they both though mutually as they fell into each others arms again.
