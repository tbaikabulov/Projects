Synopsis: The pursuit of love in Mythica.THE SPIDER'S BRIDAL BED By C  
(Contains: amorous fairies, a big spider, non-consensual &amp; semi-consensual
  fairy-catching, plus lots of tears, screams, panties, and erections.)  
Tom would never forget that summer he first stayed at Grandpa's farm. Of
  all the memories he cherished from that visit, there was one thing he dwelt
  on more than any other: the Spider's Bridal Bed.  
It was the summer after Tom's eighteenth birthday, and his first year of
  college had not gone well. He didn't relish confronting his parents and feeling
  the sharp edge of their anger, so it seemed nothing less than a miracle when
  Grandpa called.  
&quot;I'm getting on, and I could use some help around the farm,&quot; the
  old man said. &quot;If you don't mind a little backbreaking labor, why don't
  I put you up till your mom and dad have calmed down a bit?&quot; Tom jumped
  at the offer.  
It was hard work, but it was all work with your hands and your back, the
  kind Tom was good at. Within weeks, he and Grandpa had caught up on everything
  that needed to be done. There remained plenty of daily chores, of course, but
  they now had more time to talk, and more time to roam the several acres of
  Grandpa's property just for the sights and the fresh air.  
It was a fine Sunday morning in mid-July, not too hot, when Tom first saw
  the Bridal Bed. Grandpa was a freethinker, so after a big breakfast, he joked
  with Tom about all the folks who went to church. Then they went for a stroll
  through the meadow at the northern end of Grandpa's farmstead. In the meadow
  stood a small pine tree. When he first saw the tree, Tom was surprised to note
  that it shimmered. &quot;What's that?&quot;  
Grandpa smiled and said: &quot;Go take a closer look.&quot;  
So Tom strode up to the tree and discovered what was really shimmering: a
  sheet of silver-gray webbing, about five feet across, stretching down at a
  45-degree angle from the top branches of the tree to the ground. &quot;Is that
  a spider web?&quot; he asked.  
&quot;Kind of,&quot; said Grandpa. &quot;It's called the Spider's Bridal
  Bed.&quot;  
&quot;What size spider makes a web like that?&quot;  
&quot;Not that big,&quot; said Grandpa. &quot;About the size of a large dinner
  plate, I'd say.&quot;  
&quot;Wunh,&quot; said Tom, looking anxiously down at his feet.  
&quot;Don't worry son; they don't hurt humans.&quot;  
&quot;What does a spider that big eat? Birds? Gophers?&quot;  
&quot;Let me show you,&quot; said Grandpa. He picked up a stone and tossed
  it at an oddly shaped tuft of grass about twenty feet away. The stone hit dead
  on, and five of the largest butterflies Tom had ever seen came fluttering up.
  They followed an erratic path, as butterflies are wont to do, and then circled
  several times around Tom and the old man. To his astonishment, Tom saw now
  that these were not butterflies. The first three looked like human girls in
  their early twenties, about a foot long, with butterfly wings! The last two
  were twenty-something, butterfly-winged boys! The wings of each had a different
  color: red, green, yellow, blue, and turquoise. All were clothed, and the colors
  of their outfits matched their wings. The girls had sleeveless shifts, and
  panties, and high heels; the boys wore long-sleeved shirts and knee-length
  boots, but had nothing on their bottoms. Tom could see their little cocks,
  which were very erect. After a fifth or sixth pass, the creatures flew off.  
Feeling somewhat dizzy, he sank to his knees in the grass and said: &quot;They're
  . . . they're . . . . &quot;  
&quot;Fairies,&quot; said Grandpa, &quot;Winged Fairies, the most common
  kind of Fay.&quot;  
&quot;I think I need a drink,&quot; said Tom.  
&quot;Sorry, you're not legal yet. Let me try to explain. The world you usually
  live in, Tom--the world your parents always live in--has a pretty firm boundary
  between it and the Land of Mythica. In some places, though, the boundary gets
  shifty. This part of the country is one of those places. I've oftentimes gone
  out into the meadow and found myself in Mythica. In fact, I've been up and
  down Mythica many a time, and I've seen a hell of a lot. Well, it works both
  ways. What lives in Mythica can and does come here. Just a few years ago, those
  fairies started coming here; in fact they infested the place, which was a problem.&quot;  
&quot;Why?&quot; said Tom, still feeling dazed. &quot;They're beautiful.&quot;  
&quot;Unfortunately, they're as bad as they are beautiful. They blight crops.
  They make livestock sicken and die. They can drive humans who are weak in body
  or mind crazy, even make them kill themselves. I've seen it happen. I felt
  a special responsibility, because I thought my wanderings into Mythica might
  have attracted them here. So I took one last trip. You see, for every pest,
  there should be a pesticide. I figured folks in Mythica would know what made
  these bad little critters turn their toes up. And they did know! They were
  very helpful in fact, and it wasn't long before I came back with a knapsack
  full of samples.&quot;  
&quot;Samples?&quot;  
&quot;Eggs, mostly, but some adults, too.&quot;  
&quot;You mean . . . spiders.&quot;  
&quot;That's right. I got the most aggressive species, but only ones that
  weren't poisonous to humans. My favorite is the lady who makes the Bridal Beds:
  the Golden Wolf Spider.&quot;  
&quot;But Grandpa, if those fairies are what they look like, they're . .
  . they're human beings! This sounds like murder!&quot;  
&quot;They're evil, Tommo, and they're not human! Don't be misled by appearances.
  In this case, it could kill you.&quot;  
&quot;So,&quot; said Tom. &quot;These fairies blunder into this . . . this
  Bridal Bed, and a giant Wolf Spider gobbles them up?&quot;  
&quot;Not quite,&quot; said Grandpa. &quot;Fairies are a lot smarter than
  any bug. They're not going to 'blunder into' anything as big and obvious as
  this sheet of webbing here. No, the Wolf Spider gets her prey on the hoof.
  This is where she displays what she's already caught. And this is where fairies
  come when they . . . decide to die.&quot;  
&quot;Decide to die?&quot;  
 &quot;That's right. Let me explain.&quot;  
It was mid-July and mating season was drawing to its irrevocable end. Just
  two more weeks, and Irana and Serena must either be bedded or . . . it didn't
  bear thinking about. The two friends got spruced up for yet another fairy mixer.
  They did each other's hair and made sure their white shifts and panties were
  spotless. Then they crossed their fingers, laughed a little ruefully, and set
  out.  
Irana and Serena were plain Janes by fairy standards: both had overly serious-looking
  faces, straight, nondescript brown hair, spindly legs, and white wings devoid
  of ornament. Irana was a little too thin; Serena a little too plump. Ordinarily,
  such imperfections wouldn't keep a girl from finding a good (if not quite breathtaking)
  boy.  
Unfortunately, these were not ordinary times. The &quot;Princess&quot; had
  heard about these green pastures just beyond the border of Mythica, where the
  humans were abundant and stupid, and the predators were still scarce. She wasn't
  really a princess; just a cousin some number of times removed from the Royal
  Family. But Titania had the looks of fairy royalty, including their bright
  red hair and wings. She complimented these with a red shift and red high heels.
  Her one departure from sartorial tradition: her panties weren't red, but rather
  a dazzling white that almost blinded the viewer. In addition to beauty, she
  seemed to have a malevolent magic. Whenever Titania came to a fairy soiree,
  all the males there immediately swarmed around her. She now had forty or more
  permanent suitors, who followed her everywhere and doted on her every idiotic
  word. She wasn't completely stupid: she never tried to steal a boy who was
  already hitched, as that might prove fatal. But she now monopolized the attention
  of everyone else. It was cruel, and not just to unattached females like Irana
  and Serena. Instead of announcing her choice, she continued to lead on every
  one of these poor boys. When the inevitable rejection came for all but one
  of them, the unlucky ones might not have time to find a mate. They'd cry then,
  and not just from unrequited love.  
The two friends flew out into the meadow and, as always, shuddered a little
  when they passed the Spider's Bridal Bed. At least it was empty tonight. It
  might seem strange to others, but fairies always celebrated near one of these
  Bridal Beds if they could. It reminded them to importune life for its pleasures
  while they still were able. They saw the strangely tufted grass that indicated
  a fairy encampment and flew in.  
There were several fairies, boys and girls, drinking wine from buttercups
  and laughing at some joke or other. The sisters took a closer look: to their
  great disgust, but unsurprisingly, every one of these boys was one of Titania's
  thralls. If the girls flirting with them thought they were going to get anywhere,
  they had another thing coming. Just then, the &quot;Princess&quot; appeared.
  Sure enough, the other ladies were abandoned in mid-sentence. All the males
  in the place surrounded Titania and would not take their eyes off her. Their
  erections even seemed bigger than the usual for mating season. ("This sort
  of thing reminds you of why they can't wear underpants," said Irana with a
  snort.)  
&quot;We've got to talk to her,&quot; said Serena. &quot;Maybe she'll be
  reasonable.&quot;  
&quot;You have to have a brain first before you can be reasonable,&quot; said
  Irana, &quot;but we might as well try.&quot; So they went over to where Titania
  and her admirers sat.  
&quot;Uh, Titania dear, you remember us, don't you?&quot; said Serena.  
&quot;No. Should I?&quot;  
&quot;I'm Serena and this is Irana. We were part of the welcoming committee
  when you first showed up. Could we, uh, speak in private?&quot; Titania turned
  to her boys and said: &quot;Go away.&quot; They did. &quot;Is that private
  enough for you?&quot;  
&quot;That's fine,&quot; said Irana. &quot;Titania dear, it's like this.
  We don't mean to be pushy; but it's crucial for the well-being of our community
  here that you announce your choice of a mate as soon as possible. The deadline
  is just two weeks away. It would be dreadfully unfair to most of these boys--not
  to mention some girls--if you waited till the last minute.&quot;  
Titania just stared at them for what seemed a very long time. At last she
  spoke, and the disdain in  
her voice was palpable. &quot;I feel I have to explain something about myself,&quot; she
  said. "I matured just before the last mating cycle. When it came time to mate,
  I discovered that I was simply, well, irresistible. And that's not all: when
  I reject a boy, he doesn't rush off to some inferior female for consolation.
  He just cries, carries on, and pines until the time comes to give himself to
  a spider. That's the way it is. I can't change it.&quot; If the smug look on
  her face was any indication, she didn't want to change it.  
&quot;But this is dreadful!&quot; said Irana. &quot;For the sake of the fairy
  community, you must seek help to alter this destructive body chemistry of yours.
  You must!&quot;  
&quot;The only thing I must  do,&quot; said Titania, &quot;is
  what it suits me to do. Now here's what's going to happen: two weeks from now,
  at five minutes before midnight, I'm going to announce my choice to my darling,
  doting boys. The losers will then burst into tears and beg me to reconsider.
  (Let me tell you: the only thing prettier in my mind than an aroused fairy
  boy is an aroused fairy boy crying his eyes out!) I'll say no. Then the Gong
  of Gordion will strike twelve times. The losers in my little lottery will fly
  out into the night, sobbing and cursing their infatuation, now that it's too
  late. You'll be sobbing in your beds at about the same time, I expect. I will
  then lie down with my chosen one. The next day, we'll take a leisurely tour
  of all the Spider's Bridal Beds in the neighborhood. We'll see my poor, unsuccessful
  suitors. And we'll see you. You'll all be a kind of monument to my beauty and
  my allure. Perhaps we'll make love right in front of you.&quot;  
In a low voice, Serena said: &quot;You treat your own kind as if they're
  . . . human beings or something. Despicable!&quot; With that, the two friends
  stalked out.  
Later, Serena and Irana discussed their strategy, or rather the lack of it.  
&quot;I never thought I'd say this,&quot; said Irana, &quot;but it's possible
  to be too  evil.&quot;  
&quot;Can we kill her and claim self-defense?&quot; asked Serena.  
&quot;No. I checked that with a fairy lawyer: we have to be dead-bang certain
  we're going to die if we don't act immediately.&quot;  
&quot;We are certain!&quot;  
&quot;Not certain enough. We could always move to a new community.&quot;  
&quot;With a different dialect and different customs? We'd never fit in in
  time!&quot;  
&quot;The lawyer was adamant: if we kill her, we'll be executed, which sort
  of removes the point of killing her.&quot;  
&quot;Any insight into what this strange magic of hers is?&quot;  
&quot;No. None at all. There's nothing like it in the clinical literature.&quot;  
&quot;We're sunk then.&quot;  
&quot;Yes,&quot; said Irana. &quot;We're sunk.&quot;  
Weeping, they held each other tight. Serena then whispered in Irana's ear: &quot;Take
  your panties off, my dear.&quot; &quot;All right, darling,&quot; said Irana.  
Having resigned themselves, the friends took great pleasure in their last
  two weeks. About half-way through the second week, Serena said: &quot;Have
  you seen the Bridal Bed in the meadow lately?&quot;  
&quot;Not since that night at the mixer,&quot; said Irana.  
&quot;I saw it today. It's been decked out with wildflowers.&quot;  
&quot;How nice,&quot; said Irana bitterly. &quot;The spider's welcoming us.&quot;  
&quot;It's the biggest Bridal Bed in the region, isn't it?&quot; said Serena.  
&quot;Yes.&quot;  
&quot;It looks comfy.&quot;  
&quot;Yes, it does.&quot;  
They stared into each other's eyes. &quot;It's settled then,&quot; they said
  together.  
The last night came. Serena and Irana lay in bed together, holding each other.
  Even though they were expecting it, both screamed when the Gong of Gordion
  began to strike: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
  eleven, twelve. The two fairies got slowly out of bed. Together they recited
  the customary prayer: &quot;Oh Dark Lord, we are heartily sorry for having
  offended you by our failure to mate. We pledge to you that tomorrow, at our
  earliest convenience, we will put ourselves in the path of a predator, so as
  to pay the penalty laid down by your Law.&quot; They lay back down and listened
  to the night. Soon they could hear, from several points of origin, the sounds
  of weeping.  
The next day, after a surprisingly restful sleep, they flew out to the meadow.
  The Bridal Bed was bordered with flowers, as Serena had said. They were unsurprised
  to see that it was already occupied. Coming in for a closer look, they saw
  five heartbreakingly handsome fairy boys, lying on their backs in a row, their
  faces wet with tears and their cocks very stiff.  
&quot;Hello,&quot; said Serena. &quot;Some of Titania's victims, I presume?&quot;  
&quot;Y-yes,&quot; said a beautiful blond. &quot;Paying the just price for
  our foolishness.&quot;  
&quot;You were driven out of your senses by her magic. How could you know?&quot;  
&quot;We . . . we've said that . . . a dozen times to one another this morning.
  It's not . . . much of a consolation. I'm M-Miko, by the way.&quot;  
The other boys introduced themselves: &quot;S-Sato,&quot; &quot;Al . . .
  (ow!) Alcuin,&quot; &quot;B-Brito,&quot; &quot;S-S-Sanjil (oh, it hurts!)&quot;  
&quot;Hurts?&quot; said Irana. &quot;Have you already been stung?&quot;  
&quot;Only by T-Titania,&quot; said Miko. &quot;While we were in her thrall,
  she made it . . . a strict rule . . .that we could have no relief . . . till
  she . . . made her choice. Now . . . we can't get relief on our own. I fear
  we'll . . . explode before the spider comes!&quot;  
The girls looked down and, sure enough, the boys' pouches were red and swollen
  beyond their normal size. &quot;You poor dears!&quot; said Serena. &quot;You
  poor dears!&quot;  
&quot;Serena darling,&quot; said Irana, &quot;it's time to lie down now.&quot;  
&quot;Not yet! They're suffering because of that cruel bitch; we can't just
  stand by!&quot;  
&quot;What do you propose?&quot;  
&quot;Watch me.&quot;  
Serena quickly stripped off her panties and tossed them away. (And why not?
  She no longer needed to mask her scent.) She then lowered herself towards the
  web, being very careful not to entangle any part of her wings or body in the
  sticky threads. Miko seemed to be hurting the most, so she placed herself just
  inches above his groin. She grasped his cock in both hands and tugged back
  his foreskin. Miko screamed.  
&quot;Do you want me to stop?&quot;  
&quot;No!&quot; he gasped. &quot;No.&quot;  
With no further ado, she impaled herself. Miko cried out again, this time
  with a more even mix of pleasure and pain. &quot;Come on, Irana,&quot; she
  said. &quot;I don't think any of them will object.&quot; Being very careful
  not to entangle herself, Irana shed her panties and descended on Sanjil.  
And so it went, till the two friends had served, and been served by, all
  five. When it was time to come, each boy cried out repeatedly and unashamedly
  as he sent one gout of boy-honey after another into his angel of mercy. The
  girls cried out along with them. In too short a time, boys and girls had complete
  relief.  
Serena was sighing with perfect contentment when Irana said: &quot;Darling,
  I hate to be a bother, but . . . .&quot;  
&quot;I know.&quot;  
They lay down on the web on either side of the five boys: Serena next to
  Miko, Irana next to Sanjil. The magic of the web was such that their shifts
  were immediately fastened to the surface with sticky strands, and their arms
  were pinned at their sides. Their legs and bottoms, however, could still move
  freely. This was for the spider's convenience. It was comfy. All anyone could
  do now was wait.  
The sun was hot and it made Serena drowsy. She nodded off for a while, only
  to be wakened by a strange rhythm. The web was pulsing! She and the others
  looked out between their feet at the bottom edge. The builder of the Bridal
  Bed, a female Golden Wolf Spider, was striding up toward them! She was covered
  with thick, dirty-yellow fur. She had eight powerful legs and eight yellow
  eyes; but her fangs were the most terrible thing about her: two recurved needles
  that glinted as if made of steel. Clutched in these fangs was a fairy, bound
  tightly 'round the middle with strands of silk. Fastened to the spider's back
  was another fay, similarly trussed.  
When they saw her, the seven captives couldn't help but scream with terror. It's
      my time!  they all thought. But not quite. The spider dropped
      her new victims onto the web, next to Irana, and then . . . went away!
      These new arrivals turned out to be Titania and her chosen boy-toy, Rilchiam!  
&quot;It's not fair! It's not fair!&quot; Titania shouted. &quot;That stupid
  spider snuck up on us!&quot; Rilchiam, who'd taken a larger dose of venom than
  his paramour, just looked dazed.  
&quot;They've been known to do that.&quot; said Irana.  
&quot;Devil preserve us!&quot; said Titania. &quot;I remember you! I remember
  your mopy friend, too! Can't a person have good company at least?&quot;  
&quot;I'd say you're responsible for the company you're keeping,&quot; said
  Serena from the other end of the little group. &quot;In fact, I've an inkling
  it's no accident you're here. Two weeks ago, I sent a message to the Temple
  of the Dark Lord, outlining your interference with the free mating of fairies.
  I reckon this is his response.&quot;  
&quot;You . . . bitch! You worthless bitch!&quot; screamed Titania, struggling
  vainly against the threads that held her like a fly on flypaper.  
&quot;Save the screams for when you'll really need them,&quot; said Irana
  in a quiet voice. &quot;She's back.&quot;  
......................................................................................................................................................  
Two weeks after their first visit, Tom and Grandpa returned to the meadow. &quot;This
  isn't the only Bridal Bed in the area,&quot; said Grandpa. &quot;But it's the
  biggest and most beautiful. Since the deadline for mating has just come and
  gone, we should see something interesting this time.&quot;  
&quot;It's got flowers on it,&quot; said Tom.  
&quot;Considerate of the spider, don't you think?&quot; laughed Grandpa.  
They came closer. Sure enough, lined up on the Bridal Bed in a neat row were
  nine fairies. Tom looked even closer and saw, from his left to his right: one
  female, pretty but a little plump; five males, as handsome as any fashion model;
  one female, pretty but a little thin; another female, a redheaded knockout;
  another matinee-idol male. Of the females, oddly enough, only the knockout
  was wearing panties. Their eyes were awash with tears, their mouths were all
  wide open, and Tom  
could hear shrill little screams. This wasn't surprising, because the largest
  spider Tom had ever seen was strolling towards them from the bottom of the
  web! It looked as if it could move very fast if it wanted to, but it wasn't
  rushing now. It came to Tom all of a sudden (though how he knew it he could
  never say afterwards): the spider enjoyed the impression it was making on its
  catch! Tom knew he should be horrified, and in a way he was. But he was also
  aroused--more aroused than he had ever been before in his life.  
&quot;Makes me want to cream my jeans, too,&quot; said Grandpa. &quot;And
  you know what? It's not like sex in the so-called real world. It's just as
  exciting the thousandth time as the first. Keep looking.&quot;  
At last, the spider reached the line of kicking, crying, screaming fairies.
  It surveyed them for a short time, moving its head back and forth; then it
  went to the plump, pretty girl on the left. Tom had to see, so he brought his
  face right up to the edge of the web. Neither the spider nor the fairy seemed
  to mind. The girl was kicking frantically, as if her little high-heeled feet
  could make the monster go away. Suddenly the spider leapt forward with dazzling
  speed and grabbed her legs. Then it forced her thighs back, till they were
  right up against her chest. Now it quickly drew out a line of web from its
  rear and used this to bind the girl's thighs there, so that her feet kicked
  upward and harmlessly. The girl's snatch was exposed now, and Tom had to say
  it was the prettiest he had ever seen: a delicate pink mouth with no border
  of pubic hair to coarsen the effect. The spider reared back, pausing for a
  moment, then plunged its fearsome needles into the plump flesh on either side
  of the girl's labia. Her scream now was long, piercing, and heartbreaking.
  Tom felt the strangest mix of lust, fear, and grief.  
Apparently, venom from the fangs was starting to have an effect: the girl
  kicked more and more furiously, moaning audibly with the effort. Finally, she
  threw back her head and emitted a loud half-groan, half-wail of painful passion.
  At the same time, a clear liquid spouted from her cunt. She would do the same
  thing five more times over the next half-hour. At last she was still.  
The spider then moved on to the boy next to her. Its procedure was essentially
  the same, except that here it plunged its fangs into his perineum, just below
  his pouch. He screamed and groaned and wailed every bit as much as his lady-companion.
  Instead of a clear liquid, he spouted a thick, white cream, tinged with pink.
  When he was done, the spider just went on relentlessly to the next boy, and
  the next, and the next, and the next. Then it took the thin girl. Somehow,
  Tom knew that she and the plump girl were the best of friends.  
Then came the redheaded bombshell's turn. Tom had a new intuition, as mysterious,
  but as certain, as the others: this girl hadn't resigned herself to dying as
  her companions had, as much as they cried and carried on. It was going to be
  harder for her. Tom could hear her pitiable appeal, repeated over and over: &quot;No!
  Dear Devil, no!&quot;  
This time the spider had panties to deal with. Obviously no problem: after
  forcing her thighs back, it tugged her pants to her knees in no time at all.
  Another stunning snatch; another assault by cruel fangs; another long, despairing
  scream.  
The last boy put on as good a show as his fellows. Finally it was over, and
  the sun was setting.  
&quot;Here's where she gets down to feeding,&quot; said Grandpa. &quot;She'll
  drain the magical essence out of each of them. Then their bodies'll crumble
  into a fine white powder, and the powder'll blow away. So . . . you've seen
  the spider bed her little brides and bridegrooms. What do you think?&quot;  
&quot;It-it's overwhelming,&quot; said Tom.  
&quot;It sure is. Nothing wrong, though, is there, with fighting evil and
  having fun while you do it?&quot;  
&quot;I suppose not,&quot; said Tom. "It's strange: I was feeling this .
  . . intense pleasure, seeing them die; but I was sad . . . hurting almost,
  at the same time."  
Grandpa scratched his head. "Well, they're bad and they're getting their
  comeuppance. That's part of the pleasure. But of course there's more to it
  than that. I've a notion, Tom, that for them, everything  is
  sex (I think that may be why they're so cruel). Anyway, even dying is a kind
  of sex for them. But it's still dying: it hurts . . . and it scares them. Now
  when you're near them, they make you feel some part of what they're feeling.
  So when they're caught, you feel some of the pleasure, and  some
  of the sting, of their dying."  
For a while, neither of them spoke. Then Grandpa said: &quot;You know, Tom
  . . . I could sure use someone to help with the farm full-time, and maybe inherit
  it when I'm gone. It isn't just a farm, as you can see.&quot;  
&quot;It's the gateway to Mythica,&quot; said Tom.  
&quot;Just one of them,&quot; said Grandpa with a laugh. &quot;Just one of
  them.&quot;
