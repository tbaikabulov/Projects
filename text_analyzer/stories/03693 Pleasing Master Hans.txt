  Pleasing Master Hans 
  Congressman Roger Malvern exited the Ethics Committee meeting and 
  walked to where his office was. It had now been three days since 
  Simone had put that damned thing on Roger's cock! Sheila had taken it 
  pretty well when he'd shown it to her at home. Curious, really. &quot;You 
  like having this thing on your dick, honey?&quot; Sheila had asked as she'd 
  lifted the plastic cock-device up and ran her fingers along his 
  testicles. 
  Roger had patiently tried
  to explain Simone's ideas. &quot;I think she's 
  being a little ridiculous to have a chastity device put on me, it's 
  not as if I'm some sort of tom cat, you know.&quot; Sheila looked at him 
  suspiciously. &quot;You better not be! I can't believe I'm not more upset 
  that you let this woman take your pants down and lock this thing on 
  your dick,but I guess you didn't really have sex,
  did you?&quot; It had 
  actually grown rather painful having Sheila poke and prod Roger's 
  cock, as she was in her beige bra and panties at the time. Roger had 
  begun getting rather excited, and they'd begun necking like teenagers, 
  but as he forced Sheila down for a screw, he realized he couldn't take 
  off the belt, and Sheila had laughed. 
  Roger had ended up going
  down on Sheila that night, because he had to 
  have some sort of sexual outlet. He'd &nbsp;licked
  her all over, her 
  breasts, her neck and flat little stomach and her inner thighs, as his 
  cock had surged frustratedly against the cruel plastic device, and 
  then he'd returned again and again to the vagina to give Sheila five 
  or six orgasms. &quot;I am starting to like that plastic thing!&quot; Sheila
  had 
  crowed, &nbsp;and Roger had grunted, and then he'd
  turned over and gone to 
  sleep,or hoped to,but as his contented wife had snored, Roger Malvern 
  laid awake, his poor, bloated penis swelling against the annoying 
  metal and plastic device and oh, was it awful! 
  And the security guards
  had given him quite a time when he'd enter the 
  metal detectors at the Dirksen and Hart and Longworth buildings. &quot;I 
  just have metal in my shoes.&quot; he'd begun as the electronic gates would 
  go off, sensing his metal prison...and then he'd gone through with no 
  shoes on, and then of course the cock lock had continued to make the 
  sensors beep until Roger had bribed his doctor to give him a note 
  stating that he had metal plates in his head from Vietnam. All this, 
  in the space of three days since Simone had returned to town! 
  Now Roger entered his
  office, and Mitzi, his aged secretary, looked up 
  at him. &quot;You have a &nbsp;visitor in the next
  room, Congressman Malvern. A 
  nice young man.&quot; Roger looked at Mitzi suspiciously. &quot;You let
  someone 
  in my office? Is he a lobbyist?&quot; Mitzi smiled. &quot;No, but he said he
  was 
  on your Blue List, and so as you've often said, Blue Listers are 
  allowed to enter your office at will, isn't that right sir?&quot; Roger 
  breathed. He had created the Blue List for &nbsp;the
  various women he'd had 
  sexual liaisons with--call girls would drop by and he'd frolick with 
  them, occasionally he'd have a domme come in and tie him to the office 
  sofa to give him a little harmless &quot;torture&quot;. 
  Simone had been on the
  &quot;Blue List&quot; for years, and when she'd been in 
  town, quite often she would come by and behind closed doors, some 
  quite interesting activities would ensue--hell, to have her over, 
  Roger would cancel any business meetings he had to get some marvelous 
  &quot;punishments&quot; from the raven haired vixen. But she hadn't been by,
  as 
  far as Roger could tell, he wouldn't be seeing her until next 
  Wednesday, when he and Sheila were showing up for their &quot;session.&quot; 
  Certainly a man had never been a Blue Lister. 
  &quot;I'll get to the
  bottom of this!&quot; Roger said, annoyed. &quot;He seemed like 
  a very nice young man.&quot; Mitzi said mildly as Roger opened the door and 
  strode into his inner office. Sitting at his desk was a tall young man 
  with a blond crewcut, having a bit of Roger's port in one of his 
  brandy glasses.&quot;You are a bit late, Congressman Malvern&quot; the young
  man 
  commented in a thick German accent. &quot;I have been sitting here awhile 
  now.&quot; 
  &nbsp;&quot;Excuse me, who are you?&quot; Roger asked. &quot;What are you
  doing in my 
  office, drinking my liquor?&quot; 
  &quot;I am Hans.&quot; the
  young man replied smoothly. &quot;I was sent here by 
  Simone Kendall. She is displeased with you, sir.&quot; Roger was startled. 
  &quot;Simone-Simone sent you here?&quot; The young man laughed, and flexed
  his 
  shoulders. He was an extraordinarily well built young fellow, nicely 
  clad in a jacket and turtleneck sweater. &quot;Mrs. Kendall is disappointed 
  in you, sir. You were to deliver her 1,000 lines yesterday, and they 
  were to read &quot;I will learn to be an obedient chastity slut&quot;. and Mrs. 
  Kendall states that she only received 884 lines, sir.&quot; 
  Roger's face burned as he heard the &quot;obedient chastity slut&quot; part.
  Who 
  the hell was this kid to tell him what to do? He'd done the 1,000 
  lines the first two days perfectly,and what a drag
  it had been--hell, 
  today's lines had partially been written while he'd been in the damn 
  Ethics Committee hearing. The witness had looked somewhat alarmed as 
  Congressman Malvern had been scribbling, thinking these copious notes 
  were going to do the witnesses cause some harm,but indeed all it had 
  been was over and over again, &quot;I will learn to be an obedient chastity 
  slut&quot;, &nbsp;and certainly, Malvern had been terrified one of his aides 
  might look over his shoulder! 
  Roger coughed. &quot;Well,
  uh, I have 1,000 lines today, if that will be 
  any help.&quot; He smiled and proffered the sheafs
  of paper to the young 
  man. &quot;How's this? I'll do another two hundred tonight and you can take 
  these to her now?&quot; Roger gave Hans his charming grin that had 
  bewitched Wyoming voters for fifteen years. Hans
  held up his hand &quot;No, 
  you can certainly send those lines by courier, Congressman 
  Malvern--they are your lines for today. But there is still the account 
  from yesterday, and Mrs. Kendall has instructed me to deal with it. 
  Disrobe, please.&quot; 
  Roger Malvern stepped
  back. &quot;What?&quot; He gritted his teeth. &quot;Look here, 
  young man, I'm not up for a bunch of games from you.&quot; His voice rose. 
  &quot;I'm a very busy man, and Simone is a dear friend of mine,but I hardly 
  think she would have the nerve to send a young pup like you--to--&quot; The 
  young man arose, still smiling. &quot;Mrs. Kendall felt that you should 
  understand, sir, that if you cannot comply with her policies regarding 
  the counseling, that she will terminate the relationship and return to 
  the Island. Indeed, she will return your
  deposit, should you not be 
  interested in further dealings,but if you wish to
  continue, you must 
  disrobe now, and accept your punishment for not finishing your lines 
  from yesterday, sir.&quot; 
  Roger gasped.
  &quot;But-but why isn't Simone herself here?&quot; That would be 
  nice, being punished by his hot Miss Simone. Certainly, her 
  punishments were painful and at times quite unpleasant,but
  &nbsp;Simone was 
  at least, quite a beautiful woman! &quot;Mrs. Kendall believes that a male 
  punisher will keep you from being so distracted--I-my English&quot; The 
  young man shook his head apologetically. &quot;She say you will be made to 
  listen if your dick not-ah.&quot;Hans shook his head again. &quot;I 
  understand.&quot;Roger shook his head. What the bitch meant was, it would 
  be a much worse punishment for him coming from this sexless young 
  man...not to mention that Hans looked quite strong! 
  Roger looked into the
  outer office, giving Mitzi and George, his chief 
  of staff the pleasing news that they could take the afternoon off. 
  &quot;Just go out for about three hours, or do as you like for the rest of 
  the day.&quot; Roger locked the office door and looked at the smiling young 
  man, and sighing, he undid his tie, and then took off the rest of his 
  clothes, stripping down to the hated chastity device. Hans smiled and 
  motioned Roger to approach him. &quot;Mrs. Kendall has required that I 
  examine your cock device, sir, so you will have to be handcuffed. 
  Roger sighed, and put his hands behind his back, where Hans clicked 
  them. 
  Hans then unlocked Roger's
  chastity belt and took it off, and dropped 
  to one knee and began touching and stroking Roger's cock. Mortified, 
  Roger tried to close his eyes, ignoring this very homoerotic 
  experience. But he felt his cock growing hard under Hans's nimble 
  fingers. 
  As Hans carefully examined Roger's dick, Roger tried once again to 
  pretend it wasn't happening. But his erection, having been neglected 
  for three nights of servicing Sheila with no release was in full 
  flower now. Hans had a surprisingly gentle manipulation of it as he 
  pulled and stroked Roger's shaft softly. &quot;Are you homosexual?&quot; Hans
  
  asked Roger curiously. &quot;No! Not at all!&quot; Roger replied stiffly.
  &quot;You 
  seem to enjoy thees. You would like to suck my penis?&quot; Hans smiled up 
  at Roger, who blanched. &quot;No! No, that's not my thing, I'm afraid.&quot; 
  Roger laughed hollowly, willing his penis to deflate. 
  &quot;Well, your dick
  looks to be unharmed by chastity belt, I put this in
  
  report to Mrs. Kendall.&quot; Hans said with some satisfaction. &quot;Now is 
  time for punishment.&quot; Roger watched with some trepidation as Hans 
  arose, removing his tweed jacket and turtleneck sweater. In a tight 
  white T-shirt, Hans was a model of muscle, not bulging, but certainly 
  in excellent form. He would give, Roger expected, a much more 
  energetic beating than a woman like Simone could�though her floggings 
  were quite vicious and &nbsp;had often brought many
  tears to his eyes! 
  &quot;It's all in the wrist�like fly fishing&quot; Simone had explained once
  at 
  the Volcano Bondage Society when she'd been doing a &nbsp; Flagellation 
  Seminar demonstration on Roger with a cat o' eighteen tails. 
  Hans reached into an open
  suitcase sitting on Roger's desk and pulled 
  out a large, thick wooden paddle. &quot;Eh&quot;?&quot; Hans nodded
  approvingly 
  towards the paddle, smiling as if he were trying to sell Roger a 
  sailboat. &quot;Is called the &nbsp;Thudder, this
  paddle.&quot; Hans waved the 
  Thudder experimentally through the air. Roger winced. It had been many 
  years since he'd had a session, a real session that wasn't just play 
  acting with a hackneyed blonde pseudo-domme hooker. This looked fairly 
  serious, Hans and the Thudder. 
  What could
  &nbsp;he do to get out of this? My God, what if the press burst 
  in? Him standing naked, with his dick hanging out in front of this 
  muscular German waving &nbsp;the paddle around.
  Congressman Roger Malvern, 
  who had been assuring the public on C-Span just the night
  before that 
  the Democrats really were family values oriented�Malvern who blasted 
  gay marriage? Oh God. If this were discovered, it would be one helluva 
  &nbsp; headline for the Drudge Report. Roger watched Hans with trepidation 
  as the young man waved the paddle back and forth happily. 
  Hans was such a German
  type with his Aryan looks and blond crewcut, 
  Roger Malvern thought. With growing horror Roger remembered confessing 
  once to Simone that his grandfather had been an Austrian rebbe fleeing 
  from the Nazis. &quot;Although my dad converted us to Episcopalianism when 
  he married Mom, an Irish Gentile, I've always had nightmares about the 
  SS and concentration camps.&quot; Roger had told the sympathetic Simone. 
  But Simone remembered everything, and had always had a pipeline to 
  Roger's terrors. 
  Roger recalled Grandpa
  Malwicz's contempt when Dad had changed their 
  names to the more Gentile sounding Malvern. &quot;You cannot hide from your 
  past, my cowardly son&quot; the old man had said. &quot;It will come after
  you.&quot; 
  But the voters had never questioned Roger's roots, nor had his 
  father's business associates�but now his past was coming after him, in 
  the form of this friendly, grinning Aryan waving the thick wooden 
  Thudder. 
  Hans came close to Roger,
  smiling even more. &quot;Now you will bend over 
  the sofa.&quot; Hans gestured to the armrest of Roger's couch. Roger's 
  stomach somersaulted. &quot;Look here, Hans. What would it be worth to you 
  just to let this thing go---&quot; Roger laughed heartily, but it had a 
  hollow sound. &quot;I mean, this isn't fun kinky punishment at all, and I'm 
  not enjoying myself. What say I give a donation to your favorite 
  charity, got lots of greenbacks in that desk of mine---PAC money.
  And 
  you just tell Simone you gave me a thrashing?&quot; The Congressman smiled 
  gamely at Hans. 
  Hans smiled back at Roger.
  &quot;You would like to give me money? It is 
  here in this desk?&quot; Roger grinned back. &quot;Yes, &nbsp; most &nbsp;definitely. Just 
  unlock me, and I'll get dressed and give you two hundred�no five 
  hundred! Five hundred dollars &nbsp; that I just got the other night from 
  the North &nbsp; American Fuel Alliance.&quot; Now he was in control of 
  everything, Roger Malvern thought. I'll get this lunatic out of here, 
  and what will Simone know? Nothing, if the Kraut keeps his mouth shut. 
  &quot;Where is key?&quot; asked Hans. 
  Roger smiled, showing his
  teeth. &quot;Well,why don't you use your key to 
  unlock me first?&quot; What was truly troubling was that Roger was still 
  quite erect. His penis hadn't gone down a bit. &quot;No, you give me key to 
  drawer!&quot; Hans said, with a bigger smile. Leaning over, Hans slapped 
  the Thudder across Roger's left cheek WHACK! Oh, the sting! Tears came 
  to Roger's eyes. He wasn't sure but a splinter from the damn thing 
  might have lodged itself in his cheek. 
  &nbsp;Oh, Jesus. Anything
  to get out of this. &quot;The key is in my suit 
  jacket, over there.&quot; Hans went over to where Roger had discarded his 
  clothes, and went through Roger's jacket, finding a set of keys, and 
  tried them in the drawer, finding the right one on his second attempt. 
  &quot;This is the right drawer, Congressman Malwicz? I mean Malvern?&quot; Oh
  my 
  God. &quot;Yes, yes.&quot; Roger stuttered. He might not get out of here
  alive. 
  She'd told him! Roger had read in horror of neo-Nazi shit in the 
  papers, and God knows what would happen here if he didn't give this 
  lunatic the money and get un-handcuffed FAST. 
  Hans pulled out a white
  envelope which contained two thousand dollars. 
  Roger's intent had been to take five hundred out of it, and present it 
  to Hans, and then to dismiss him quickly. But Hans opened the envelope 
  and looked at the cash, and then put the entire thing in his pants 
  pocket. &quot;Thank you so much, Congressman.&quot; Roger huffed, &quot;Well,
  wait 
  you can't�&quot; Hans waved the paddle again, landing it once again on 
  Roger's right cheek this time WHACK! &nbsp;Roger gritted his teeth. &quot;You
  
  talk much too much, Congressman Malvern. American politicians are how 
  you say? Long winded?&quot; Hans smiled. 
  &nbsp;&quot;So now you'll
  unlock me? Why don't you..&quot; Malvern choked &nbsp;as Hans 
  once again gesture to the arm-rest. &quot;Now you will bend over the
  sofa.&quot; 
  Malvern almost shrieked. &quot;But I just gave you two thousand dollars to 
  unlock me? What's wrong with you?&quot; Hans looked confused. &quot;No, no
  you 
  say you want to give money to my favorite charity. I give to 
  Children's Hospital, which helped my baby seester with cornea 
  operation. Is that not what you wanted?&quot; Hans' blue eyes were open in 
  seeming astonishment. Roger tried to smile. &quot;No, that's a nice way of 
  saying I'm giving you a gift, in return for your cooperation in 
  letting me loose, don't you know?&quot; Roger was sweating now. Was this 
  man a complete idiot? 
  &quot;Oh, you bribe
  me.&quot;Hans nodded, still smiling. &quot;Yes!&quot; Roger said, too 
  eagerly. &quot;And-and maybe there's more where that came from�some
  time.&quot; 
  If he could just get unlocked and his clothes on, he'd call security. 
  This was insane. But as Roger looked down, his cock was near to 
  bursting. Hans looked at Roger's cock too, and smiled still more. 
  &quot;Miss Simone authorize me to give you fifty
  whacks with Thudder. That 
  is suitable punishment for not writing all your lines.&quot; 
  &nbsp;&quot;But she say, if you threaten or bribe, it is one hundred whacks,
  and 
  another twenty-five with cat.&quot; Hans looked in the suitcase and pulled 
  out Simone's old coiled cat o' eighteen tails. Roger remembered it 
  well, he'd almost gone into shock at the
  Flagellation Seminar and had 
  later gotten four stitches on his inner thigh. And she'd only hit him 
  ten times with the cat o' eighteen tails then. (Of course ten times 
  eighteen is oh God) 
  &quot;So, is bribe or gift
  for my charity?&quot; Hans asked again, smiling. &quot;Oh, 
  a gift, Master Hans.&quot; Roger said hurriedly. &quot;I am fully in support
  of 
  Children's Hospital, and I hope you can donate it to them, and of 
  course I expect my full punishment of only fifty whacks, sir.&quot; 
  Perspiration ran down Roger's face. He breathed a sigh of relief when 
  Hans put the cat back in the suitcase. &nbsp;Roger sighed as Hans picked up 
  the paddle again, waving it sunnily, his cheerful smile once again in 
  evidence. Roger moved to the armrest mechanically, bending over. Oh, 
  he hoped it wouldn't be too miserable. 
  &quot;Ach, I forget
  some-sing&quot; Hans said in his odd pronunciation. &quot;Stand 
  back from couch, please.&quot; &nbsp;Hans halted Roger with his hand and &nbsp;went 
  into the suitcase, pulling out a peculiar looking chain in a Y shape. 
  Two longer ends of the chain enjoined into one thicker end, and at the 
  ends of the first two chains were vicious little clamps. &quot;Oh, I can't 
  do clamps&quot; Roger protested feebly. &quot;My nipples are too sensitive
  now. 
  Simone used to use them on me quite frequently, but my doctor�I can't, 
  really.&quot; Roger backed up as Hans approached with the chains, still 
  smiling. 
  God, he has such a ghastly
  smile, Roger thought. Suddenly, Hans 
  reached out and grasped the middle aged legislator tightly by the 
  scalp and pulled him close. Grinning, Hans whispered. &quot;You are quite a 
  taxing submissive, Malwicz. You irritate your Uncle Hans, Ja?&quot; Roger 
  choked. &quot;You must stand still for the clamps now, sir.&quot; Goddamnit,
  he 
  didn't have to take this. He was a United States Congressman. &quot;Look, 
  I'm going to scream for security. Are you aware of my position?&quot; 
  Hans grinned widely and
  tightened his grasp on Roger's scalp,pulling 
  it back so Roger had to stare up into the fluorescent office lights. 
  Just as Roger's eyes were starting to sting, Hans turned Roger's head 
  towards him. Smiling, Hans said softly, &quot;Perhaps I
  &nbsp;push you out in 
  hallway of House Longworth Building for all the other congressmen and 
  congressional aides-- pretty office girls to see�what a crybaby you 
  are. That will help in next years re-election,
  ja?&quot; Roger could hear 
  Hans' German accent thickening as the young man spoke even more softly 
  in his ear. 
  &nbsp;&quot;You don't know how much trouble you are in, son.&quot; Roger
  said, using 
  the steady tone he'd used with Arafat, Edwin Meese, Bork
  &nbsp;and so many 
  other so-called threateners. Roger felt his head turned even closer to 
  Hans' leering face. Hans spoke again &quot;I am diplomat's son and Phi Beta 
  Kappa graduate of Georgetown University, it is doubtful that I am 
  deported or even jailed for making a fool of you.&quot; Hans considered. 
  &quot;Perhaps I take pictures of you to send press, yes? Or will you stand 
  still for clamps like a good boy?&quot; 
  Dumbly, Congressman Roger
  Malvern held still for the clamps, which 
  felt as if they would tear off his nipples as Hans carefully put them 
  on. Then, Hans attached a five pound weight to the single chain that 
  enjoined the clamp chains, and Roger had to close his eyes, muttering 
  Buddhist chants to withstand the horrific drag on his tender tits. 
  Roger felt as if his chest was about to be ripped into the ground. 
  Suddenly, his eyes still
  closed, Roger felt an especial drag on his 
  nipples, and opened them in horror to find Hans gaily hitting the five 
  pound weight with the paddle he called the Thudder. As Roger batted 
  the weight, Roger struggled in vain against his cuffs. &nbsp;&quot;I practice
  my 
  tennis serve&quot; explained the boy happily. &quot;Please�Master�Hans�mercy,
  
  Sir.&quot; Roger got out in a hoarse voice. Finally, Hans stopped swinging 
  the Thudder. 
  Clapping Roger on the
  back, which of course jounced the weight yet 
  again, Hans explained &quot; You see, Congressman
  Malvern, when Mrs. 
  Kendalls says she demands 1,000 sentences a day, that is what she 
  wants. She is a woman of her word.&quot; Roger nodded silently, a tear 
  rolling down his cheek. &quot;Now you will bend over the couch please.&quot; 
  Hans gesticulated again, and Roger moved slowly to the couch and bent 
  over once more. 
  Hans moved slowly to
  Roger's back, and noted his erection was pressing 
  out between his legs. &quot;Oh, this is not good. Mrs. Kendall did not want 
  to have this be a sexual experience, she say, and
  your pee-pee is 
  still hard, even though a man is here disciplining you.&quot; Hans shook 
  his head. &quot;You must be somewhat of a faggy-boy, Congressman.&quot; Roger
  
  didn't bother to deny this, it was all too much. &quot;Can you make this 
  penis soft for Hans, please?&quot; 
  Roger tried hard, thinking
  of baseball scores, Subcommittee hearing 
  testimonies, various filibusters he'd sat through, Orrin Hatch's face, 
  but nothing seemed to be calming his rampant erection. &quot;You are not 
  obeying Hans.&quot; The young man sounded displeased for the first time 
  since he'd come in the office an hour before. Hans walked to where a 
  chart and pointer were sitting, and picked up the pointer, slashing it 
  through the air. He then moved back to Roger's behind and took Roger's 
  erect, large penis with one hand, toying with it, and then let go of 
  it and SWACK SWACK SWACK! 
  Hans had perfect aim, it
  seemed and the pointer landed three times 
  sharply, right on Roger's glans, at the very tip of his penis. Roger's 
  eyes rolled back in his head and he screamed. &quot;Oh no, you mustn't 
  shout.&quot; Hans went into the suitcase again and pulled out a ball gag, 
  locking this around Roger's head. &quot;That is all we need, a lot of 
  disruption.&quot; Hans gagged Roger and returned to operations with the 
  pointer. SWACK SWACK SWACK SWACK! Finally Roger's penis was limp, and 
  Hans seemed satisfied. &quot;Very good. You understand &nbsp; Mrs. Kendall 
  cannot have any sexual pleasure coming from this.&quot; Hans explained this 
  earnestly. 
  &quot;And now, finally, we
  give you the Thudder.&quot; Hans picked up the thick 
  wooden paddle and lifted it above Roger's quivering bottom. WHACK! 
  WHACK! WHACK! Hans methodically landed the paddle fifty times, 
  alternating from the right cheek to the left, and words cannot 
  describe Roger's pain. In addition to the slams from the paddle, the 
  jouncing of Roger's body was causing the five pound weight at the end 
  of the chain from his nipples to bounce, and he screamed in vain 
  against his gag. After twenty-five whacks, Hans paused. &quot;My goodness, 
  your bottom looks very red, Malwicz.&quot; Roger winced at the name. 
  &quot;Are you ashamed of
  your heritage, Malwicz?&quot; Hans chucked Roger under 
  the chin as he bent over the couch, weeping through his gag. Hans 
  strolled over to the suitcase and pulled out what looked to be a 
  beanie cap like Roger had worn as a freshman in Alpha Tri Zeta, back 
  at Princeton in 1964. &quot;This is yarmulke,
  my Raveh.&quot; Hans said gently. 
  Roger gasped. Raveh had been his Hebrew name just before he'd 
  converted with the family to Episcopalianism! But he wasn't Jewish, 
  Roger wanted to protest, his mother was a Gentile so he wasn't 
  technically�He could see his grandfather's contemptuous look again. 
  Roger felt Hans put the
  yarmulke on the back of his head, and return 
  to his behind. Hans lifted the paddle again, and gave Roger the final 
  twenty-five whacks. SLAM! SLAM! WHACK! WHACK! Finally, it was over. 
  Hans put the Thudder back in the suitcase, and gently helped Roger up, 
  his face looking concerned. &quot;It was a harsh punishment, ja?&quot; Hans 
  unlocked Roger's handcuffs, and removed his ball gag tenderly, and 
  took off the nipple clamps. &quot;You must stand still while I replace the 
  cock-cage.&quot; Roger stood still and Hans locked the cock cage back on. 
  Hans stood up again. &quot;Was it so bad liebchen?&quot; he asked 
  affectionately. 
  Roger began crying softly
  and Hans took Roger's silver head in his 
  hands. &quot;I-I'm so sorry I didn't do the lines, Master.&quot; Roger sobbed
  as 
  Hans stroked his hair. &quot;There there, Raveh, you are a goot boy, no? 
  This help you learn what your priorities are, yes? You will not 
  neglect lines again, Raveh.&quot; Roger nodded and sobbed against the 
  German's shoulder. It was such a relief�he hadn't cried like this 
  since his tenth year. Certainly his parents had never physically 
  punished Roger; indeed, they'd given him whatever he liked�this was a 
  new experience. He was contrite. 
  &quot;Now you will write
