Synopsis: waiting to meet her online friend not realising just how much she will change






it was my own fault i suppose i should never have laughed at that scruffy little table he seemed so proud of.it sat there in the middle of the room,looking so out of place.the room was spotless the wall mounted flatscreen dominated half of one wall,the furniture so modern,yet pride of place went to a scuffed chunky table,so strange.
&nbsp; i was excited he was coming all the way from america on business and hed had made time for us,he had rented a house for us to spend the month together.so here i was giving it the once over before collecting the keys to hand over to him when he arrives on friday.2 days to go i couldnt wait.anyway the house was perfect and as soon a the owner left i was hiding that damned ugly table
&nbsp; "mrs johnstone if youd come this way.." i looked up realising he meant me,it wasnt my name, he had insisted i used his.i followed him upstairs,strange id thought we had viewed all the roomshe led me back to the guest bedroom,i t was totally bare,i had thought that strange but i smiled to myself as i knew we would only need the master bedroom.he opened the cupboard door "i better show you this before i go"i looked in ,puzzled it seemed as bare as the room.i felt a sudden pain in my shoulder,it seemed totally unreal,hed grabbed my arm and next thing&nbsp; i knew i was staring and my hand cuffed to the hanger rail.i felt something being stuffed into my mouth ,that was when i started to struggle,too late far too late.it was such a shock i hadnt even uttered a sound.i tried screaming at him "what the fuck are you doing"it didnt come out that way more a muffled blaaaah,but i could tell by his grin he knew what i meant.i didnt think i could be any more scared but i was wrong,when i heard the second sets of cuffs click shut on my wrist then roughly jerked up to join my other hand attached to the rail,i kicked out satisfied to hear him grunt in pain.it was a mistake,he hooked my legs away from me.i collapsed but only so far my shoulders wrenched and my wrists felt on fire as they suddenly took my full weight.he grabbed my face and glared at me.he never said a word but i knew i wasnt going to kick him again
&nbsp; suddenly there was total blackness hed slammed the door shut on me,i was locked in the cupboard,trying to scream kicking at the door.the door jerked open,i got the glare again,i stopped struggling but started sobbing instead.blackness came back
&nbsp; id totally lost all sense of time i had no idea how long id been here when suddenly blinding light,hed opened the door and the bare bulb dazzled me.the blinds were drawn,was it dark outside? omg that meant it had been at least an hour since this started.his hand flew to my face,i jerked back screaming,puzzled why i hadnt felt the slap. i jumped i heard my name being spoken,but his lips never moved,then i realised,he was holding a phone to my ear."sandra,our friend has pressed a key i heard it beep which means i know youve heard me,now nod....good,if i dont hear the beep it means youve not followed my instruction and i will hang up ,nod if you understand......very good" omg he knew what was happening he wasnt going to come rushing to save me omg omg omg "you thought we were just playing games online,but guess what you were wrong,those games are about to become very real" i was panicking ,he had made me do some outrageous things online "our friend will let you speak in a minute,you will be allowed to ask him to free you and he will drive you home and just in case,i have to warn you he has an alibi so it would be pointless reporting this, and we will never meet either here or online ever again,or..................."
&nbsp; he stood there silently waiting till i finished sobbing,my mouth dry,from the discarded rag.i stared at him hating him i so wanted out of here ,fuck him i was going to report both of them.i looked him in the eye never having hated somebody so much in my life,then i lowered my head and whispered "please sir can you help me prepare for my master".he laughed as he kicked the door shut in my face,i heard his footsteps as he left the room,i started to sob again.the light dazzled me yet again.i screamed as i saw the scissors approach.i screamed at him to stop omg he was slicing my blouse to ribbons it had cost a small fortune,i loved this top.i couldnt believe it my top was just a pile of rags on the floor,the bastard,he was cutting my trouser to pieces too,he could have just simply pulled them off me,ny legs werent tied,he was enjoying this he stood back enjoying his handywork.i had given up struggling i just stood there letting him watch.he reached out and yanked one of the cups down on my bra.i never realised his hands were so big,it covered my boob squeezing i tried not to react but he knew he pinched my nipple and pulled,his other hand replacing the rag in my mouth at least it stifled the scream. i never even realised hed released my other breast until i felt the searing pain in my other nipple.the sudden lack of pain was such a relief i never even worried as the scissors did their work on my bra.again he destroyed it.i jerked upright as his hand suddenly clamped onto my crotch,without warning he grabbed the material of my knickers and yanked.i actually felt myself open as the cloth pulled into me then intense pain as it dug deeply into my sensitive parts. the relief as the scissors cut them open the pain stopped as they no longer dug into me.it was so embaressing they had been pulled so tight into me that even though hed pulled his hand away,they were still held between my lips. i could no longer look at him. why oh why hadnt i escaped when i had the chance.my face was grabbed again,i felt the rag being removed " dont say a word. drink" he stuck a water bottle to my lips i guzzled on it&nbsp; my mouth felt so dry,he didnt remove it till id finished.he wandered off to come back minute later with two yoghurts "eat" for someone who had been so rough i found it hard to believe how gentle and patient he was feeding me. it didnt last though he was soon away,i started to worry he was away ages but again my abductor came back,this time with a holdall.he knelt in front of me and pulled the holdall closer.i watched i was beyond worrying now i accepted my master had plans for me now , he pulled out the leather cuffs and buckled them onto my legs,they didnt look cheap, omg i was actually proud of the trouble they had went to.i yelped as he grabbed a hook on the left cuff and yanked my leg to the side,i heard a click and realised somehow my leg was locked up to the wall of the cupboard,my other leg was suddenly yanked sideways and again the clicking sound,i was spread too far,my muscles ached but i knew he wouldnt listen even if i could talk.he laughed,"you finally dropped you knickers for me then" he stood back up facing me "not just yet darling" i yelped he used a finger to push the material inside me.he released one of the hancuffs i was too tired and sore to struggle,and he replaced it with matching leather cuffs.again a click,my wrist was locked to the wall
&nbsp; he finally finished and stood back admiring his work "almost done" he took the phone from his pocket but instead of calling the flash suddenly lit up the room.omg hed taken my picture "i think your american friend will enjoy this" he sent it, the phone suddenly rung,he listened then held it to my ear "cant wait till friday" then he hung up.again the sudden darkness which bothered me less and less,how long this time,i still didnt know,then the blazing light and a weird clanging noise. my muscles were really aching now but he didnt care, "better get rid of this i suppose" i felt the thin cloth being pulled out of me,i was so thankfull then suddenly the darkness again.i heard his muffled voice through the door, you better have a good aim anything out of the bucket you will be cleaning up. oh god no he wasnt letting me go, i hadnt thought about going to the toilet,but suddenly now it was all i could think of. 
&nbsp; i tried to hold off as long as possible but who can tell how long, the sound was so loud it actually startled me,i wished i hadnt drank the full bottle. i knew i was in trouble, i dont think it all went in the bucket .my mind was racing,there must be some way i could prevent him punishing me. i remembered the almost permanent bulge in his trousers as he prepared me....maybe when he ungags me i can suggest a few things...............well i still have two days to wait on master, i think i can make the wait easier..........
&nbsp; later i hear footsteps, i grin to myself......










Chapter 12.&nbsp;&nbsp; Enslaved Professionals


One day, at the �facility�, my trainer said the words I had been waiting to hear.&nbsp; These were words I feared, but also words that meant the end of the endless repetition of exercises designed to prepare me for my future. 

�Stephanie, your new life is about to begin.�

I remembered clearly that I had once been proud, that I had once possessed freedom and dignity.&nbsp; I had been able to choose what college to attend, what profession to prepare for, what employment offer to accept, what men I would date, with whom I would have sex.&nbsp; All these things were a distant memory now.&nbsp; Since the jury verdict at my trial I had been stripped of all that even as I was stripped of my clothing.&nbsp; They told me it would �only� be for ten years!&nbsp; Then I would be restored to my freedom.&nbsp; So they said.

I had been trained at the Richmond Slendabond facility to obey orders from anyone placed in a position of authority over me.&nbsp; While I still had a will to disobey any ability to disobey had been systematically trained out of me.&nbsp; Escape was impossible due to some device they had implanted in my neck.&nbsp; I had no standing to appeal to any court concerning my status as a slave.&nbsp; Disobedience was pointless since, if I were slow to obey, they would just take over my body in some mysterious way and cause my body to do what they had commanded independent of my will.&nbsp; If they wanted me to suck a penis I would suck a penis whether I did it of my own volition or my body just did it against my will.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t for me to know how they did these things to me.

When they spoke of my �new life�, all I knew for sure was that it would somehow involve me working at my profession as an accountant.&nbsp;&nbsp; I could not even imagine what it would be like to apply my professional knowledge and skills under conditions of slavery.&nbsp; Would I be able to speak freely my professional opinion about how best to carry out the tasks assigned to me?&nbsp; Probably not.&nbsp;&nbsp; Could I refuse an assignment if I found it morally repulsive?&nbsp; Almost certainly not.&nbsp; Would I be forced to have sex with my business superiors and their clients?&nbsp; Does the sun rise in the morning?

The day for me to leave the &#8216;facility&#8217; finally came.&nbsp; I was brought down to the loading dock where I waited, my hands securely cuffed behind my back.&nbsp; They could have controlled me quite easily without the cuffs, so I supposed that was done mostly to impress upon my mind that I was no longer a free girl.&nbsp; They had dressed me in low-rise blue jeans that fitted me like a glove, leaving little of my lower form to the imagination.&nbsp; Much of my midriff was bared by the low cut of these jeans together with an abbreviated and tight fitting t-shirt they put on me.&nbsp; The contours of my firm breasts were visible through this t-shirt as were my nipples.&nbsp; When I used to dress like this in college guys would often tent their slacks. 

Shortly two more young people were escorted to the loading dock, similarly cuffed.&nbsp;&nbsp; I soon realized that these two were people I had known during my physical training in the gym.&nbsp; There was Jennifer Marston, the blonde ballerina from the National Ballet of Capitallia.&nbsp; She was nearly as slender as I and had been similarly dressed in low-rise jeans and midriff baring t-shirt.&nbsp;&nbsp; The jeans revealed her highly muscled legs while the t-shirt revealed how thin and fragile her upper body was.&nbsp; Her breasts and nipples could also be quite clearly seen through the translucent t-shirt.&nbsp; The other one to join us was Harold, the lawyer, clad in tight fitting jeans and a tight t-shirt that showed his biceps, shoulders and bared six-pack abdomen.&nbsp; An impressive bulge could also be seen in his jeans at the juncture of his muscular thighs.

Soon an extended body SUV pulled up and two smartly uniformed female security guards got out and approached us.&nbsp; They wore badges, stun guns in holsters and their uniforms proclaimed them to be working for Richmond SlendaBond.&nbsp; They announced that we would all be going to our new owners. We all nervously eyed the controller devices on the wrists of each of these guards.&nbsp; We knew only to well that either guard could render any of us unconscious at the touch of a button.&nbsp; They opened a back door of the SUV and we were escorted in to a carpeted and upholstered space where there were two long padded benches, one on each sidewall.&nbsp; As each of us took a position on one of the benches a guard shackled our feet and one wrist to convenient eyebolts attached to the wall and floor of the truck, then belted each of us in with seat and shoulder belts.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

There were no side windows so we would not be able to see where we were going, though there was a long ceiling window that admitted plenty of light.&nbsp; This space was evidently designed for carrying human cargo and was completely walled off from the cab up front where the guards would ride.&nbsp; I noticed a video camera that would enable the guards to keep an eye on us.&nbsp;&nbsp; We were all dying to ask one of the guards where we were being taken but no one did.&nbsp;&nbsp; We had all been voice trained.&nbsp; One of the female guards announced that we had permission to speak freely during the trip but only to our fellow slaves.&nbsp; The rear doors were closed and locked and the SUV began to move.

The trip took about two hours.&nbsp; I suspected we had been heading toward New York City, and this was confirmed when I heard one of the guards announce our first stop.

�This is your stop, Jennifer.&nbsp;&nbsp; We are at the stage entrance to the Montmarcy Theatre, home of the National Ballet of Capitallia.&nbsp; You will be one of a growing number of professional dancers who will work at your craft while enslaved.&nbsp; Enjoy.�

�This is wrong�, Jennifer muttered under her breath, �they can&#8217;t make me dance for them if I am not free!�

Jennifer was unshackled from the bench and escorted out of the SUV where a uniformed male guard from the ballet company came out to meet our guards.&nbsp; I heard some conversation about Jennifer and then the ballet company guard was talking with someone on his cell phone.&nbsp; He then announced that Jennifer was not expected here until evening rehearsal.&nbsp; Our guards indicated that Jennifer would be escorted on to her day job and returned to the theatre in time for the evening activities.&nbsp;&nbsp; So that was how it was going to work, I thought.&nbsp; None of us would have any say about who used us or when or how.

The SUV began moving again and after about 15 minutes we sensed the vehicle going down a ramp into an underground parking garage under some office building.&nbsp; When we came to a stop we were all unloaded.&nbsp; Another SUV had pulled in to the parking spot next to ours.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the side of this one was written �Maxim&#8217;s Slaves� and �We Specialize in Full Figured Types�.&nbsp;&nbsp; A man of perhaps 40 years with a rather portly pear shaped physique and a slave collar around his neck was being led out of this vehicle.&nbsp;&nbsp; If he was Maxim&#8217;s typical product I thought, rather irreverently, then they might as well rename their business �Porkers-R-Us�.&nbsp; Evidently his future owner would be valuing him more for his mind than for his body.&nbsp; They had given him baggy jeans and a baggy shirt to wear.&nbsp; This was the man we would later know as Edgar, the economist and statistician.&nbsp; After he disembarked there was also a woman getting out of that SUV who could accurately be described as �full figured� but certainly not obese.&nbsp; Our respective guards then herded all of us from both vehicles into an elevator.
 
When the elevator stopped I was amazed at the sight before us.&nbsp; It was a very large gymnasium that was currently being used as some kind of processing center for physical exams.&nbsp; There were lines of naked people everywhere queuing up to stations where doctors and nurses were examining them.&nbsp; A pair of orderlies in white coats met us.&nbsp; Our SlendaBond guards announced that the clothing we were wearing belonged to SlendaBond and must be returned.&nbsp; Maxim&#8217;s guards said the same to the portly man and the full figured woman.&nbsp; We were all instructed to undress.&nbsp; I did not feel comfortable doing this in such a large space where so many people could observe us, but I knew better than to disobey or even to hesitate.&nbsp; In no time we were all naked.&nbsp; Then the orderlies cuffed our hands behind our backs so that we could not even protect our modesty.&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought this gymnasium looked vaguely familiar.

We were guided into the first of several lines.&nbsp; I noticed from their collars that some of the people in the line were slaves like us.&nbsp; There were other naked people in line, however, who did not have slave collars but had, instead, those non-citizen wristbands.&nbsp; When we reached the table a nurse checked our blood pressures, listened to our hearts, drew blood samples, and had us produce a urine specimen.&nbsp; There was no privacy here.&nbsp; We had to produce a specimen in full few of several hundred people.&nbsp; If you couldn&#8217;t produce one, they had an electric probe that would make you urinate.

As I was leaving the first table and getting into the second line I looked up.&nbsp; There was a kind of balcony or mezzanine overlooking the gym and there were fully dressed people up there looking down at all of us in our nakedness.&nbsp; Suddenly I knew where I was.&nbsp; I looked more closely at the people up there and I spotted my former co-workers June and Lacy.&nbsp; They were looking directly at me and smirking.&nbsp; They had just seen me forced to urinate into a cup.&nbsp; I had once stood up there on that balcony looking at the naked non-citizens on my first day on a new job.&nbsp; This was the facility of my former employer, Masterson Automotive!

There were several more lines to go through and more indignities.&nbsp; At last Harold, Jennifer and I and the �fat guy�, as I then thought of him, had completed the processing and were waiting in one corner of the gym for further developments.&nbsp; We did not have long to wait.&nbsp; A guard wearing a company uniform came over to us.&nbsp; Steel collars were placed about our necks and locked shut with some sort of special tool.&nbsp;&nbsp; The collars bore the inscription �Property of Masterson Automotive� and each had multiple attachment rings to which a leash might be attached.&nbsp; June and Lacy came down to collect us.&nbsp; I noticed the two of them were really looking over Harold&#8217;s naked body, his six-pack abdomen, his most impressive low hanging balls and his thick uncircumcised penis.&nbsp; I had seen Harold naked before at the training facility but he was a novelty to my former coworkers.&nbsp; Our fat fellow traveler stood by self-consciously with his pear shaped obesity, his love handles his rather small penis and a tight scrotum that had not fully descended.&nbsp; I felt sorry for the guy.

Lacy and June attached leashes to each of our collars and took the four of us, still naked, up the elevator to the floor where I had worked when I was still employed by Masterson Automotive.&nbsp; I was most unwilling to step off the elevator but I had no choice.&nbsp; I thought I would die to be seen naked and collared by all my former coworkers and by my former bosses.&nbsp;&nbsp; All four of us would have covered our genitals if we could, but of course we all still had our hands cuffed behind us.&nbsp; I felt a warm flush on my face and breasts and that my nipples were getting stiff.&nbsp; I told myself that it was because I was cold but the truth was I was feeling some degree of sexual arousal being paraded naked before everyone I had known at this company before I was fired.

My two former coworkers escorted us all down a well-remembered long corridor, plushly carpeted and with tasteful artwork, to an office that was all too familiar.&nbsp; There was that same spectacular view of the New York City skyline that I remembered from the day I had first come here for a job interview.&nbsp; There was Jeff Duncan, Human Resources Director, seated behind his elegant desk, speaking for a moment to someone on the phone.&nbsp; We all stood and waited.&nbsp; He acted as though it were the most natural thing in the world that there should be four naked and collared slaves standing in his office and waiting on his pleasure.&nbsp; After what seemed an eternity he finished his call, motioned to Lacy and June that they should disconnect our leashes and leave.&nbsp;&nbsp; He did not invite us to sit and he made no move to unlock our handcuffs.&nbsp; Evidently he wanted to make a point that none of us were free.

�Well, my most exquisite &#8216;human resources&#8217; have arrived at last!� he said expansively.&nbsp; As a �Human Resources Director� I have long aspired to have the kind of human resources which you four represent!�

�Stephanie, Jennifer and Harold, meet Edgar who comes to us from an academic background in economics.&nbsp; You are probably wondering why you are here and what sort of work we have in mind for you?� he continued.&nbsp; �You all have permission to speak freely.�

�Yes sir, we all did wonder that� Harold replied.

�Well you slaves should all know that Stephanie was with us as a well paid employee up until two years ago.&nbsp; Now she will be here again under rather different terms.&nbsp; It seems she got a bit uppity with Tom Jenkins, one of our department managers.&nbsp; Nearly all our female employees are smart enough to know that if a department manager wants to fondle their legs, they are obliged to submit to this.&nbsp; But not our Stephanie.&nbsp; Oh no!&nbsp; She was too full of herself for that.�&nbsp; 

�She even went so far�, Duncan continued, �as to file a sexual harassment claim against Tom.&nbsp; Naturally I filed that in my circular file.&nbsp; We don&#8217;t keep our female employees in line by investigating sex harassment cases.&nbsp; The general feeling of management here is that harassing the female employees is a perk that goes with any management job.�

I felt the anger rising in me.&nbsp; My heart started beating faster and the muscles of my arms, shoulders, neck and upper back all began to tense.&nbsp; Duncan seemed to notice this and said something to me that didn&#8217;t make any sense &#8211; something about �green moon�, then �forget fourteen�.&nbsp; For some strange reason I began to relax after he said that, and a short time later I couldn&#8217;t even remember what I had been angry about.&nbsp; But I glanced at Jennifer and the two men and saw they were all still tense.&nbsp; That puzzled me.

�But lets get Tom in on this discussion� Duncan continued.&nbsp; �After all the four of you will be working for him now.&nbsp; And I assure you that, since you are all slaves now, Tom will be able to fondle much more than just legs.&nbsp; He is bi-sexual and may find interest in all parts of all your bodies!�

In my newly relaxed state it did not seem odd that a manager would have such access to my body or the bodies of the others who reported to him. 

Duncan made a call.&nbsp; Tom Jenkins soon entered the room and took a seat.&nbsp; He openly stared at my naked body, at my firm breasts, my erect nipples and most particularly at my crotch which, still being handcuffed, I was powerless to cover.&nbsp; I was embarrassed of course, yet it did not seem wrong that the man who would be my superior would take such interest in my body.&nbsp; It was his prerogative after all.&nbsp; Duncan had said so.&nbsp; Yet this man Jenkins seemed vaguely familiar to me.&nbsp; I felt that I had known him in a past life that was now beyond recall. 

�We have a project in mind�, Duncan continued, �on which the four of you can collaborate.&nbsp; The New York State legislature has recently passed a new Apprenticeship Law. There was a widespread belief in our society that too much idleness has a corrosive effect on our youth.&nbsp; Teenagers have way too much time on their hands and this often leads to juvenile delinquency and the use of dangerous recreational drugs.&nbsp; It also often leads to young people entering the labor market with poor work habits or no work habits at all.� 

I found myself in general agreement with these points.&nbsp; I had long thought much the same myself.

�By contrast� Duncan continued, �in the early history of the United States most teenagers were either doing chores on the family farm, helping their families run small businesses, or were learning a trade after being bound as an apprentice to a master in that trade.&nbsp; It was not uncommon for a young boy to be indentured by his parents to a master printer, bookbinder, candle maker, blacksmith or any of dozens of other trades.&nbsp; The boy would be under contract to the master for a term of years at a very low wage, or perhaps for board and room only.&nbsp; In return the master would teach the boy a trade so that when the apprenticeship was up the boy, now a man, would be qualified as a journeyman in that trade and would have a marketable skill which he could freely offer to any employer.&nbsp; It was a good system.&nbsp; Many a boy got an education his parents could not have afforded to buy for him and learned to earn his livelihood in this way and eventually became a master in his own right.�

Harold, our attorney colleague, raised his hand and was recognized to speak.

�Are you saying that the project we will be working on has something to do with this new law?�

�Yes, Harold� Duncan replied.&nbsp; �You see Masterson Automotive wants to be a pioneer in taking full advantage of the new Apprenticeship Law.&nbsp; The new law allows boys and girls to be apprenticed under indenture from the age of 12 up through the age of 19.&nbsp; Contracts are initially written to go from age 12 to age 16, with an option for the 

apprentice, having reached the age of majority, to extend the apprenticeship to age 19 if both parties agree.�

�Would the child be free to quit the apprenticeship at any time?�&nbsp; Harold asked.

�Not at all� Duncan replied. �You see the employer makes quite an investment in providing a child with a useful education and is entitled to something in return.&nbsp; He is entitled to have full control of that child during the agreed contract term, so as to be able to fully exploit the labor of his pupil to his own advantage.�

�So there could be all kinds of abuses, just as there were with the historical system of apprenticeship!�&nbsp; Harold exclaimed.

�Well not quite.�&nbsp; Duncan responded.&nbsp; �Our new law is called �The Kinder and Gentler Apprenticeship Law�.&nbsp; It implicitly recognizes that apprenticeship does create a kind of slavery for the young pupils, and so they need all the same kinds of protections that we afford to adult slaves under the Kinder and Gentler Slavery Law.&nbsp; For example no corporal punishment may be used, the hours of work are limited to 20 hours a week so that the child may attend regular school classes, the best medical and dental care must be provided, good nutrition, opportunity for the child to exercise, and a small trust fund setup that will be under the child&#8217;s control when he or she becomes an adult.�

�What about sex?� Jennifer asked. �Are the children ever used sexually by their masters or mistresses during the apprenticeships?�

�The new law absolutely bars any sexual contact between master and apprentice while the apprentice is below the age of consent.&nbsp; In New York the age of consent is 16.&nbsp; So the question of sex would only arise if the apprentice freely agreed to extend the apprenticeship for an additional 2 or 3 years after reaching age 16.&nbsp; Such extension would give the master free reign, sexually speaking.�

�But if a child doesn&#8217;t agree to extend his or her apprenticeship after reaching age 16, then would that child would have to enter the labor market at that point?� Jennifer persisted.

�True� Duncan replied, �but a 16 year old boy or girl entering the labor market with at least a basic apprenticeship training accomplished would command a much better wage than if he or she had to enter the labor market at age 12 with no such training.�

�Nevertheless� Jennifer continued, �there would be quite a bit of pressure on the 16 year olds to sign off on the sexual consent business to get the benefit of the extended apprenticeship training!�

�I won&#8217;t work on a project where 16 and 17 year old boys and girls can be forced to have sex with their teachers!�&nbsp; Harold declared.

�I feel the same way.&nbsp; I won&#8217;t do it either!�&nbsp; Edgar said.

�No fucking way anybody is going to make me do work like that!� Jennifer expostulated.&nbsp; 

�Your freedom of speech can be taken away, Jennifer, if you abuse it!&nbsp; Do not forget who and what you now are, Jennifer, Stephanie, Harold and Edgar.&nbsp; As slaves you don&#8217;t have any choice about what projects you work on any more than you have a choice of your sexual partners!�&nbsp; Duncan exclaimed as he pounded his fist on the desk.

I could see the muscles in the backs and shoulders of the other three tightening up and their faces turning red with anger.&nbsp; I remained strangely relaxed about the whole thing.&nbsp; But of course Duncan was right.&nbsp; None of us had any choice about anything anymore.&nbsp; We could be commanded to do anything and we must obey!&nbsp; 

�Keep in mind�, Duncan continued in a more conciliatory voice, �that in Capitallia there is no system of publicly funded education beyond sixth grade.&nbsp; Even the K-6 program will eventually be eliminated as other ways are found for private financing of education.&nbsp; Children of poor families have, until the recent legislation, often found it necessary to enter menial jobs immediately after completing sixth grade.&nbsp; Now there is a way for such children to continue their educations and prepare for much higher paying occupations &#8211; all without being a drain on the taxpayers.�

�When you put it that way it sounds like we will be helping these children� Harold remarked.

It sounded like child prostitution to me, but obviously my opinion would not matter in the least.&nbsp; Duncan would only respond that 16-year-old youths were hardly children anymore and that, in any case, they were not being asked to turn tricks.

�Another point to consider is that all apprenticeships are entered into initially as a contract between a child&#8217;s parents or guardian and an individual teacher and practitioner of the skill the parents want that child to learn.&nbsp; Children are never apprenticed to impersonal corporations or passed around from person to person.&nbsp; The individual practitioner may well be working as a highly paid professional employee of a corporation when the apprenticeship begins, but if that individual moves to a different corporation, or goes into private practice, his or her apprentice moves with him.&nbsp; A special, and very personal relationship exists between teacher and student that is often consummated sexually when the student has reached an age of suitable discretion and consents to do so.&nbsp; Not every apprenticeship will work this way, but many do.�

�Where do our respective professional skills fit in to such a project?�&nbsp; Jennifer asked, a puzzled expression on her face.

�Let me address that one, Jeff� Tom Jenkins interjected.&nbsp; �What we need is a study of the legal, psychological, economic and financial cost control implications of filling literally several hundred key skilled positions with apprentice labor.&nbsp; Harold, you will contribute your legal expertise to make sure that the plans we formulate are in full compliance with the new kinder and gentler apprentice laws.&nbsp; Jennifer, you earned a degree in psychology as well as in dance, so your day job will be to help us to work out the psychological ramifications of how we can best assist our professional masters and mistresses to motivate and control their apprentices.&nbsp; Evenings and weekends we will loan you out to your old dance company.&nbsp; Stephanie, you will contribute your cost accounting expertise to help us figure out how much money could be saved by using apprentices.&nbsp; And Edgar, we are going to want you to use your training as an economist to take a look at how such a program will impact the price of labor generally.&nbsp;&nbsp; We will want to be sure that we are not bidding against ourselves for apprentice labor or that we are not excessively depleting the pool of unskilled child labor.&nbsp; We will also want you to look over Stephanie&#8217;s shoulders to make sure all the economic assumptions she will be making in her cost accounting are valid.&nbsp; Any comments slaves?�

We all sat in stunned silence.&nbsp; They were actually going to force us to work on a project about which we had serious moral qualms.&nbsp; I was also becoming ever more conscious of my nakedness and wanting some clothing to cover my body.&nbsp; Duncan anticipated me on this.

�I know you four probably would like some clothing� he continued, �but, with a couple of minor exceptions, that is not part of our plan for you.&nbsp; Instead you will spend nearly all your time with us essentially naked.&nbsp; The only exception will be that for you women high heels and certain required jewelry will be worn during all working hours.&nbsp; For you men black bow ties will be attached to your slave collars and you will also wear mid calf leather boots during all working hours.&nbsp; The footwear will both call attention to your nudity and improve the lines of your legs.&nbsp; We feel that your constant nudity, while interacting with colleagues, superiors and visitors who are fully clothed, will go a long way to maintain an awareness in your minds that you are not free and are not equal to the others.&nbsp; We will issue you clothing only when needed for protection from job hazards or from inclement weather.&nbsp; That will be entirely at Tom&#8217;s discretion, and any clothing issued to you will be of a type or design he approves and be available to you only as long as actually needed for such protection.�

As I stood there, naked and handcuffed, listening to Duncan I began to feel quite chilly and my muscles began to shiver from head to toe.&nbsp; 

�You will live in barracks style accommodations on another floor of this building.&nbsp; You will be under constant surveillance.&nbsp; You will be forced to exercise daily to keep those bodies toned.&nbsp; We will use sexual frustration and sexual pleasure as the primary means to motivate the four of you to do what we want you to do.&nbsp; In general you will be denied sex, even masturbation in order to maintain you always in a state of sexual tension.&nbsp; When we wish to reward you for a job well done we will permit you to masturbate or even arrange for you to have a full sexual experience with a partner of our choosing!�

Again I could see the muscular tensions in the bodies of my three colleagues.&nbsp; Naked people find it very difficult not to show their emotions through their muscular responses!&nbsp;&nbsp; Nakedness denies a person not only physical privacy but psychological privacy as well!&nbsp;&nbsp; I had accepted, since some point earlier in our meeting, the idea that my life, my body and my sexuality were at the disposal of my corporate masters, so again I remained strangely relaxed at this particular time.

�The good news for you slaves� Duncan continued, �is that you will be permitted at least 4 hours of leisure every day and all your medical needs will be covered.&nbsp; Your primary care will be from our own company doctor.&nbsp; Should you ever need the services of specialists or hospitals, a medical insurance program the company maintains for all its slaves will cover these.&nbsp; Coverage is more comprehensive, in fact, than what the company provides for its free employees.

Duncan at last noticed that I was shivering from exposure.&nbsp; 


�It is not our intention to make you suffer physically from exposure to cold or drafty air.&nbsp; We have a solution for that.&nbsp; Tom, why don&#8217;t you take charge of these four, get them settled in and begin briefing them in more detail on the project?�

Tom Jenkins then led the four of us out of Mr. Duncan&#8217;s office and down the hall into the large high ceiling open office area where I had worked here when I was a free employee.&nbsp; Coworkers I had known from then stared at my companions and me.&nbsp; Some smirked.&nbsp; Someone called out to me �How do you like your new life, Steph!�&nbsp; This was all just too humiliating for words.

Then I saw something that had not been in this area before.&nbsp; It was an oval shaped conference room formed entirely of clear glass panels, about 15 feet by 25 feet, elevated on a platform about two feet higher than the surrounding open office area.&nbsp; Inside this glass room was a glass conference table and 8 chairs, and all along the back wall of the oval room was a series of 7 glass cubicles.&nbsp; There were major traffic aisles passing both in front of the oval room and behind the row of glass cubicles.&nbsp; Any of the 40 to 50 employees of the accounting department plus visitors to the department would be passing regularly back and forth along these traffic aisles many times a day.

�Here are your new office accommodations� Jenkins said, clearly sweeping his hand toward the raised platform.&nbsp; We call this the &#8216;fishbowl&#8217;.&nbsp; It is all glass so that many others will have opportunities to view you as you work naked here everyday.&nbsp; It is all temperature and humidity controlled to make nudity practical.&nbsp; The glass enclosures will protect you from drafts and there are adjustable infrared heaters in each cubicle you may adjust to your comfort level.&nbsp; He proceeded to unlock all our handcuffs after extracting a promise that we would not use our hands to cover ourselves.

�Stephanie, you take cubicle number one.&nbsp;&nbsp; Jennifer, you are in number two.&nbsp; Harold, you take number three, and Edgar, number four.&nbsp; Now up you go!�

We each found that we had to climb three steps to get up to our new �offices�.&nbsp; I soon became aware that lighting had been arranged so that I would always be highly visible in my cubicle to all in the room and to any passersby.&nbsp; Also I became aware that the only furniture was a specially designed seat consisting of a backrest and two padded thigh supporters, but no center part to protect my modesty.&nbsp; The first thing my eyes took in was a computer monitor suspended from the ceiling, so oriented so that when I sat facing this monitor I would be facing one of the major traffic aisles.&nbsp; Also suspended, next to the monitor, was an �air mouse�. Underneath the monitor were two stirrups for my feet with leather locking bands.&nbsp; There was also a web cam and headset.&nbsp; No printer, no filing cabinet, and only one small drawer for personal things located near the ceiling so as not to obstruct sight lines.&nbsp;&nbsp; There were three video cameras in the cubicle to monitor me from different directions.&nbsp; The chill I had felt in Duncan&#8217;s office soon melted away as I felt warmth from an infrared heater which I could control.&nbsp; Jenkins had disappeared into his office.

Someone from Human Resources came in and fitted us women with our high heels and jewelry, and fitted the men with their leather boots and bow ties.

Suddenly there was a message on my computer screen:

�All of you sit down, place your feet in the stirrups provided, and put on your headsets!�
As soon as I had obeyed this directive I felt the leather locking bands electrically lock my feet into the stirrups.&nbsp; It would now be impossible to get up from this seated position until or unless someone sent a signal to electrically unlock the stirrups.&nbsp; More messages appeared on my screen accompanied by their verbal equivalents in my headset.

�You will notice that your feet are now locked in place�, Jenkins voice continued through our headsets, �and that, for you females, the stirrups also raise your knees to approximately nipple level.&nbsp; Should you have a need to arise from your seated positions to go to the bathroom or for any reason you must seek permission from myself or from one of my two assistants.&nbsp;&nbsp; The stirrups are designed to keep your feet well separated.&nbsp; There are also sensors that will detect any attempt to bring your knees together and deliver a verbal reprimand should you attempt to do so.&nbsp; You may not use your hands to conceal any part of your bodies at any time.&nbsp; This is now a paperless office.&nbsp;&nbsp; Everything you will need to do your jobs should be available to you through your computer terminals.�&nbsp; 

�Your bathroom�, he continued, �is the seventh glass cubicle at the end of your row.�

We all groaned inwardly.&nbsp; The company meant us to perform even our toilet activities on display to the world.&nbsp; No doubt there would be video cameras and microphones there too, that no one in the entire building should miss out on the sight and sounds of our humiliation.

�At this time slaves�, he continued, �you will all watch a twenty minute training video on your monitors to acquaint you with the programs and services available through your personal computers.�

After the training video we were ordered to convene in the glass conference room to receive our first briefing on our first assignment.&nbsp; We all used electronic notepads to take notes on the briefing that were saved back to our personal computers.&nbsp; I felt this was all coming on too fast.&nbsp; I was overwhelmed with all that had happened to us this day.&nbsp; Nevertheless I opened the �Notepad� program so that I was ready to take notes.

First Jenkins introduced one of his two assistants, Sally Rogers, who would sit in on the meeting.&nbsp; I noticed that she carried a riding crop attached to her belt.&nbsp; No doubt a symbol of her authority.&nbsp; She sat down next to Edgar, our portly economist.

�Sometimes� Jenkins began, �you slaves may feel the sting of Sally&#8217;s riding crop on your bare legs or buttocks when she wishes to quicken you in the performance of some task.&nbsp; This is not intended to physically hurt you but to remind you of your station here and of the need for prompt obedience.�

�Masterson Automotive has long been tempted� Jenkins began, �by the idea that we could use enslaved professionals like yourselves to perform key professional and managerial roles within our firm.&nbsp; The advantages would be lower cost per hour and the fact our investment in training slaves could never be lost due to worker attrition.&nbsp;&nbsp; Slaves would not be able to leave their work with us and go to work for our competitors, taking our trade secrets with them.&nbsp; We have to feed slaves and provide for their medical care, but the costs of housing slaves in barracks style facilities is much less than the costs incurred by free employees for maintaining their own homes, commuting and the like.�

Sally Rogers at this point casually used her riding crop to poke at Edgar&#8217;s love handles and to lift his small penis up.

�Does this little thing actually work?�&nbsp; she demanded.

�Yes ma&#8217;am, it did the last time I tried it.�&nbsp; 

�And how did you &#8216;try&#8217; it?&nbsp; Did you fuck a woman?�

�No ma&#8217;am.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t get many opportunities to do that, being as fat as I am and as shy as I am.&nbsp; If you must know I masturbated, ma&#8217;am.�

�Perhaps I will require you to demonstrate that later on� she replied.&nbsp; 

Edgar&#8217;s face was turning red and he looked away to avoid eye contact with Sally or any of the rest of us.

�We are not going to let you use it or play with it for quite some time now� Sally continued.&nbsp; �When you have impressed us with some spectacular results on your project we will then let your �little economist� come out and play.&nbsp; We will then reward you by providing you the use of various female bodies for your pleasure, including, quite possibly, the va-jay-jays of your two female colleagues here in this meeting!� she said, looking meaningfully first at Jennifer and then at me.

I caught a fleeting expression from Jennifer that said &#8216;when hell freezes over&#8217;.&nbsp; My own feelings were somewhat more complex.&nbsp; I felt so sorry for poor Edgar, to see him mocked so.&nbsp; I instinctively liked Edgar as a person, though I was not physically attracted to him and probably would never have given him my phone number if we had met when I was a free woman.&nbsp; Nevertheless I was beginning to feel some solidarity with him in our common predicament and it would give me great pleasure to give him pleasure.&nbsp; If ordered to fuck him I would do it with good grace.

�Your team assignment slaves�, Jenkins continued, �will be to explore a variety of different skilled jobs within our organization and determine the extent to which indentured apprentices would be practical in these jobs.&nbsp; For starters I am going to take you all on a tour of one area of our factory where printed circuit control boards are assembled.&nbsp; Workers in this area must be very detail oriented and possess high finger dexterity.&nbsp; We find that adult female workers and teenage girls generally work out best.&nbsp; There is an extended training process for these jobs and we have often lost our training investment because of fairly high employee turnover.&nbsp; If we could replace �at will� employees with indentured youths we might cut out much of that turnover expense.�

�If you will all follow me we will begin our tour.�&nbsp;&nbsp; So saying he led us to an elevator and took us to one of the manufacturing floors.&nbsp; 

When we stepped out on the 4th floor we were told we would be entering a clean room environment and we had to all take showers and step through a large blow dry machine.&nbsp; Jenkins and Ms. Rogers each donned a special clean room suit.&nbsp; The four of us had to leave our footwear outside.&nbsp; Then we all walked out on a very busy assembly area.&nbsp; There was row after row of benches where naked workers were assembling circuit boards.&nbsp; No one seemed uncomfortable, as the room was draft free and temperature and humidity controlled.&nbsp; Also there was an infrared light aimed at each worker to simulate the warmth of sunlight.&nbsp; Each row consisted of twenty teen-age girls and a male or female supervisor.&nbsp; Each supervisor wore a slave collar but the girls, who were between the ages of 12 and 16, were obviously not slaves as each wore the non-citizen wristband.&nbsp; I marveled at how uniformly thin their bodies were and how their nimble fingers seemed so well adapted to the assembly of tiny components onto the boards.&nbsp; I noted the immaturity of their young bodies, breasts that varied from small to none and rather well defined ribcages.

�Why are they all naked?�&nbsp; I asked.

�It is mainly because this is a clean room.&nbsp; All workers have to shower and blow dry just as you did before entering this room.&nbsp; Management felt that not permitting clothing would eliminate the risk of lint and dirt particles contaminating the finished boards.&nbsp; Also it made it simple for the girls to take an exercise break in the swimming pool mid morning and mid afternoon and return to work without the hassle of wet clothing, lockers, etc.&nbsp; Then too it was felt that all this nudity would be aesthetically pleasing when we bring customers and other visitors through.&nbsp; I can assure you these girls are not being subjected to anything of a sexual nature, except possibly for some of the sixteen year olds who consent to sexual service for extra pay.&nbsp; These girls are all free employees with permission from their parents to work a 15-hour week so as to not conflict with their schoolwork.�

Jenkins then approached a thirty-year-old slender woman with a slave collar who was obviously the supervisor of the first 20 girls.&nbsp; He caressed one of her impressive breasts and toyed with the nipple briefly, then engaged her in conversation about how production was going.&nbsp; She dutifully reported how many boards had been turned out in the last 4 hours and how many rejects there had been.&nbsp; He introduced her as Rebecca to the 4 of us and explained to her that we were slaves like herself and would be doing a study and might need to ask her many questions.

�Rebecca, what did you do for a living when you were free?� I asked her.

�I worked as a production line manager for a competitor of Masterson Automotive� she replied.&nbsp; �Then the mortgage company raised the interest rate on my mortgage and I could not meet the new payments.&nbsp; I was enslaved for debt.&nbsp; Masterson bought me and I have been here these last 6 years.�

�What sort of problems have you experienced in your job as a supervisor here?� I asked.

�The limited hours these teenagers can work and the constant turnover.&nbsp; I am constantly training new girls.�

�I am sure Stephanie will be coming back to spend more time with you, Rebecca, after she gets her feet on the ground� Jenkins said.&nbsp; �For now we need to proceed with some of her other orientation.�

Tom Jenkins then led the four of us back to our fishbowl.&nbsp; He indicated that I should accompany him back to his private office, while the others were to get more familiar with their computer terminals.&nbsp; When we entered his office he locked the door and motioned me to lie down on his couch.&nbsp; He proceeded to take all his clothes off and came and lay down on top of me.&nbsp; His intention was becoming all too clear.

�I have been waiting a long time for this!� he said rather excitedly.

I wasn&#8217;t sure what the big deal was.&nbsp; If he wanted to use me sexually that was his prerogative.&nbsp; He was, after all, my corporate superior.&nbsp; I felt his hardness against my thigh, then against my vulva.&nbsp; When he had lubricated himself, he then positioned his penis and was soon inside me.&nbsp; Although I felt no particular attraction toward this man, the sensation was pleasant enough as he began pistoning in and out of me.&nbsp; His penis was thick and made my vagina feel very full.&nbsp; I did not want him to stop.&nbsp; Soon I began to meet his thrusts and was lubricating copiously.&nbsp; I felt my clitoris becoming quite engorged and sensitive.&nbsp; The muscles of my pelvis and legs were contracting rhythmically as I began to reach my own climax in time with his approaching climax.&nbsp; Then I felt his seed reach my womb.

At that moment he said something that made no sense to me at the time.&nbsp; He said �Bright Eyes!�&nbsp; Then everything changed in an instant.&nbsp; I suddenly remembered who this man was.&nbsp; 

�You bastard!&nbsp; I shouted as every muscle in my body began to tense.

He was the one who had tried to fondle my leg when I was a free employee of this company.&nbsp; He was the one against whom I had filed the sexual harassment claim!&nbsp;&nbsp; It was his viciousness that had cost me my job and led to the poverty that ultimately cost me my freedom.&nbsp; And this bastard had the nerve to penetrate me and come inside me and, in fact, still had his half hard penis inside me.&nbsp; I wanted him out of me, but he would not withdraw.&nbsp; He intended to enjoy the sensations my body could provide to his penis for as long as possible.

�Do you know why you were enslaved, Stephanie?�

�Because of my debts� I said

:�Not just that, girl.&nbsp; Lots of people have over $10,000 in debts and don&#8217;t get enslavement petitions filed against them.&nbsp; You did because I wanted you enslaved.&nbsp; After you filed the sexual harassment claim against me I knew I had to have you, had to be inside you.&nbsp; Had to become your absolute master.&nbsp; It was a matter of simple sexual justice.&nbsp; So I went to Greg Masterson and persuaded him to start the ball rolling.&nbsp; You didn&#8217;t even owe the minimum $10,000 so I had to call in some favors to phony up some additional debt for you to clear the statutory hurdle.&nbsp; But it all worked out and here you are.&nbsp; My sex slave for the next ten years!�

�Pull out!&nbsp; Get off me!�&nbsp; I wanted to throw him off.&nbsp; I knew that I was in better physical shape than he was and my muscles should have been able to throw him off easily.&nbsp; But somehow my muscles would not do as I bid them.&nbsp; I was helpless physically to resist him.

�Better watch your manners, girl!&nbsp; I can fuck you six ways from Sunday anytime I want.&nbsp; Or I can keep you in a perpetual state of sexual frustration.&nbsp; For now I think I will just stay inside you and enjoy the sensations.�&nbsp; He began to fondle my inner thighs, my labia and my clitoris.
I absolutely did not want to feel any more arousal because of his fondling or his presence inside me.&nbsp; So I began to think about the national debt and accounting problems.&nbsp; It seemed like an hour, but eventually he pulled out.&nbsp; Then he penis whipped my face and dried his penis off in my hair.

�Clean yourself up, girl.&nbsp; Then I will expect to see you back in the fishbowl for another staff meeting in fifteen minutes.�
