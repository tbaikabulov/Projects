Smiling eyes

I came by the house to drop of some things, but no one answered the door.&nbsp; Knowing garage is usually open, I sneaked in, making my way up to the main floor.

Without warning, like a blur he runs down the stairs, not seeing me.&nbsp; The bundle in my hands lands on the thick carpet as I stop the head on collision by grabbing his towel wrapped hips. Startled, he comes to a halt catching his balance with a hand on the railing, his eyes wide under the fringes of wet curls. Moment lasts forever while I drink in the site of wet Adonis, man-child, droplets of water on his bronze skin, clean, warm smell filling my lungs.&nbsp; I should let go of him, half my age, he could be my son.&nbsp; But, I have been watching those smiling eyes looking at me for so long.&nbsp; I have seen him taunt that young flesh one to many times.

I&#8217;m standing still, waiting.&nbsp; He moves, slowly, as if afraid to startle me, brings his hand to my face and bends over. His lips are soft and sweet. Tender, innocent.&nbsp; His eyes open, frighten, unsure. I can feel butterflies in his stomach as if they are my own.

Breaking the kiss I ask: �Where is everybody?�
�At work.�
�Where&#8217;s your mother?�
�She is visiting with her sister.�

I let go of him and start moving away.

�No! Please. Wait. She won&#8217;t be back before supper. Please �don&#8217;t ��

I am looking at him, battlefield in my head.&nbsp; �Suffer no fools!� my Succubus screams. There is too much on the line here, and my head is not where is should be. He is to close, pulsing, trembling � begging �

I step up closer, just a breath away, holding him still with my gaze. �Are you still a virgin?�
Shudder runs through his body and he sucks in the air.
�Do not lie to me!� my whisper cuts him.

Reluctantly he shakes his head �No, not any more.�

Laughter bubbles in my stomach: �You, naughty boy!�.&nbsp; My fingers brush his smooth chest and slide inside the towel. I grab on it like a leash and pull him after me to the basement. 

�Down. Lay down on the floor. On your back.� I watch as he stretches on his back, towel riding higher, he uncertain what to do �
�Hands up, above your head.&nbsp; Leave the towel alone.�&nbsp; I lover myself on my knees next to him, admiring the perfect fullness of youth.&nbsp; My fingers trace silky skin over taut arms, tickling his underarm eliciting chuckle and bringing smile back to his warm dark eyes. Hand lingering over his hot skin, not touching, just feeling, than playing with few droplets of water still clinging to his chest � I bend over, closer to him drawn by the site, smell � Perfect little nipple, pleading to be licked! His eyes flutter shut at the flicker of my tongue, his arm reaches for my head �

�Don&#8217;t touch! Don&#8217;t move!� I hiss against his skin and he tenses, breath interrupted. 
�Keep those hands stretched out there.&nbsp; I touch. You � feel.� Stomach muscles tighten as he obeys. I listen to his breathing, rhythmic beat of his heart � fast. ~~~ Are you afraid?&nbsp; What are you afraid off? ~~~ His skin is warm, almost hot on my cheek rubbing against it. Towel twitches.

�Mmm � what have we here?� slight pull and the wrap happily falls away.&nbsp; �Nice. And, hard.&nbsp; Just the way I like it.� the thoughts come out loud and he chuckles. ~~~ Tee-hee. No chuckling allowed! ~~~ I squeeze it at the base, forcing rush of blood into already purple head and eliciting gasp from un-expectant recipient of my less than gentle attention. Allowing my long hair to spill and drag over his stomach, I shift between his legs, prying them apart.&nbsp; 


� to be continued.
