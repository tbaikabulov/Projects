The world felt as if it had shattered when you left.&nbsp; Being no longer yours, a void opened, and I could not find peace or satisfaction. It had been weeks, my house a wreck. I hadn&#8217;t even showered that day, curled in my blanket on my favorite chair I watched romantic movies endlessly and let the tears fall where they may. A cozy blanket wrapped around me, but it brought no comfort, but at least it was warm. 
I opened a pizza box to find none; I sighed, and looked in all my cabinets for food, again disappointed. I started to put myself together to leave, when there was a knock on the door.&nbsp; I looked out the peep hole, and there in the stair well you were.&nbsp; I held my back to the door and gasped another knock. I shut my eyes, and swung opened the door with a smile, �Hi!� my arms blocking the entrance. You looked me up and down but no words were said as you walked past me, and my arms fell without hesitation, the smile fell from my lips, the door still open, I said nothing. I stood and watched in embarrassment as your eyes scanned my apartment.
Without facing me you signaled behind you to shut the door, quietly I did as requested. �This is the way you live?� The words echoed your back still to me, I stayed quiet. �Kneel,� as if second nature I did. You left me, but my heart never did leave you, I thought, but to say those words would start my tears. Why were you here? As if you read my mind, �I missed you, but this,� you motioned your hand around my trashed apartment, �was not what I was expecting.� You started to walk around me, �Up,� I Stood; your hands gently lifted my chin. �Will you listen? No more disobeying?� 
I started to treble with anticipation, �yes, Master.� Your lips went closer to mine; I puckered my lips to receive your kiss, my eye closed as you turned from me.
�Then you will change,� your hand left my chin and you turned to go into the kitchen �and you will listen,� you opened all of the dishes cabinets �but I won&#8217;t accept a submissive living this way.� All the cabinets were open I looked on, being still. �Clean up this mess, and when you&#8217;re done you will wash every dish, clean or not!� I started to move towards the kitchen and grab a trash bag, as you blocked m path, I looked up into your eyes, �I will return for you,� My lips parted again with the release of an infatuated sigh, you smiled with the response and kissed me on the cheek, �continue.� You walked out the door, pausing as you watched me start the cleaning process before shutting the door leaving me alone again, but this time with hope. 
I picked up the stale pizza boxes and the trash, from bottle to can, from beer to soda, dusting the television vacuuming my home and I started to feel like myself again as my apartment emerged. I started to put the dishes in the dish washer when I heard you enter you were carrying grocery bags, �what are you doing?� You said abruptly, I turned to look at you, confused but I did not respond. You picked up a dish from the dishwasher, �you do not get the privilege of using this machine, wash them with your hands,� you handed me the dish. 
�Yes Master,� I responded as I started to do them by hand.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*

As I watched you put away the groceries I saw a box of oatmeal, I was surprised you had bought it; you knew it was something I liked. My spirits lifted but after hours of being on my feet they had started to swell, my hands were pruned and sensitive to the touch. Only a few more I thought as I looked at the pile of was clean soon to be cleaner dishes. I thought of your joy, I thought of the chance to get you back. I would not let this task deter me, I would do everything you asked, release my own mind and allow you in it. I dried the last dish and placed it in the cabinet closing it softly. �Very good pet, now the floor,� you threw a sponge down to the ground and I fell, partly from exhaustion and hunger, it was nice to relieve the pressure from my feet. The sponge had a steel wool top, it felt as if it were cutting my pruned fingers as I scrubbed each inch of the kitchen floor. 
I was tired, hungry but I worked past it just feeling your presence was enough. You were relaxed on the couch watching television as I finished. I crawled to you and placed my head in your hands, �finished,� your voice was gentle and sweet as you caressed my hair. �Up,� you commanded, I did not look at you as I stood, I did not want to show you my exhaustion.&nbsp; You took me by my hair; you pulled me to the bathroom. You moved the shower curtain out of the way. �Strip,� you said as you watched me undress I was now naked; you touched my breasts gripping them in your hands. Your hand then traced my sides to my hips as you moved them on my body to my run them to my thighs, I started to pant with ecstasy as your fingers traced my thighs �spread them,� I moved my legs apart as you knelt down to look at my pussy, your hand clasped it as you stood, and moved past me releasing my pussy from your hands, I gasped and heard the water turn on behind me. 
The shower came on and you moved past and rested your shoulder on the door frame your arms crossed as you watched me. �Get in,� I went to close the curtains, �No, I did not say it you do not do it.� Being naked as you watched me bathe made me feel vulnerable, I shyly washed my body and turned from you, you laughed, �turn towards me so I can watch you.� I smiled feeling a bit more at ease knowing you were enjoying it. As I finished, you commanded �turn off the shower, pet� I did and you already had a towel wrapping it around me and hugging me tightly, �dry off and meet me in the living room.� I dried off and went to get dressed when I remembered your words, I stopped and stayed naked. 
I walked out to the living room and there you were watching television lounging again on the couch as if you were never in the bathroom with me. I stood in front of you, you moved your head to continue watching your show, �make me dinner, I have steak in the fridge.� I made it the way you liked it, medium seasoned perfectly set the table for one the smell made my stomach ache, and turn.
 I placed it at the table and stood beside it, �your dinner is ready.�
 
�Thank you,� Now let me make you dinner, I heard the microwave come on and you mixing in a bowl. You placed it on the floor, it was oatmeal! I knelt down knowing since there was no fork what you wanted me to do, and waiting for your command. You sat and started to enjoy your dinner, �eat pet.� I lapped it up with my tongue it was tasteless, but I was so hungry that I was just glad it was something. As you finished, you leaned down and picked up my bowl, I had not finished half of it but I let you take it. I did not dare complain about the hunger. You stacked them �up,� I rose, �dishes,� you said as you handed them to me. 
�Yes, Master.� I again started to do the dishes and you came up behind me, starting to kiss my neck and feeling my naked body, your hands exploring every inch of me slipping your figures in between the lips to reveal to you my wet pussy. You brought your wet fingers to my lips letting me suck it off of them, you placed your hands on my shoulders and lead me to my knees unzipping your pants and taking out your cock, �Adore it pet.� You said as you released it into my hands. My hands slowly entangled your shaft and I started to kiss and lick up and down your perfect dick. My lust to want it in my mouth grew as I my lips moved to each side of its thick round body, massaging each inch with my tongue. Licking up and down the shaft I started to pant with pleasure, the breaths echoing off of your dick back into my mouth with each stroke of my tongue. Your sounds let me know of your enjoyment as I inserted your cocks head past my lips into my wet mouth, moving along it massaging it with my tongue caressing it with my quivering lips. Just having you so close to being inside of me was bringing me closer to explosion. 
You stopped me and picked me up off the ground roughly moved me over the counter, my tits pressed against the counter top as you spread my legs wide. You entered me without warning, �you&#8217;re so wet, filthy girl!�&nbsp; you moved inside of me, I started to pulse on you, and my moans became louder as you grinded inside of me harder, your cock grew in size and just before I was about to feel release you pulled it from my cunt pushing me back to the ground and shoving it into my mouth. I sucked and sucked until I felt you cum, I wish I could have cum with you, but doing what you asked was more important, I was only hoping one day you would let me feel release again. Picking me up by my hair your breath still fluctuating from the passion, �you cum when I want you to cum and not a moment sooner.�
 You released my hair, and went to the living room; I dropped to my knees wishing that I could feel that same release. �Come,� your voice was quiet but to me it was bellowing. I stood without hesitation and walked to you. You caressed my breasts slowly and passionately, brushed my hair from my face behind my ear, and kissed me softly, �I&#8217;m tired pet. Lay down,� looked around trying to find out where you wanted me, and with a malicious smile, �on the floor, on your tummy.� Your hand did not leave my hair until I was too far away from it. �Now get comfortable, however you&#8217;d like as if you were sleeping here.� I curled into a ball on my side as if I were sleeping, �good girl, now stay there.�&nbsp; 
You returned with ropes and tied my feet and wrists. Then securing them together so I could not move from my ball I had found myself in. �you look almost perfect,� you examined your work only to leave again, and come back with the panties I was wearing when you had first came to my home. �Open,� you said I did as you waded them and pushed them far into my mouth. You covered me with my blanket, and kissed me on the forehead. For awhile you sat with me on the floor and expressed the importance of precise listening. Expressed your feelings for me, and it ignited passion to continue, I had to make a choice, is this the life I will lead for you? Without love it could never be my choice, but with the love I have for you there was nowhere else I would rather be then on the floor exhausted, wanting nothing else but to please you. 
I don&#8217;t know if my eyes told you or you had just realized it, you cuddled with me on the floor for a moment. Your arms around me brought a comfort, my soul open my breaths slowed and became meditative. You rose onto your side, �good night, pet� kissing me on the cheek you rose and left me there on the floor in the dark, with my thoughts and dreams of being next to you. 
Bright and early you were awake, and I woke up to my bedroom door opening, I tried to stretch forgetting I was tied. �Good morning baby,� gagged it was hard to smile or respond. You pulled out a pocket knife and cut the bonds pulling the panties from my mouth. My mouth dry I craved moister, �go get some water and get ready so our day can begin; stay naked, but do yourself up, and I will see you back here shortly.� With those words you were off again. After doing my hair and makeup I knelt by the door waiting for you to come back. I did not care to watch TV or read or sit in a chair or couch, I just waited, until the door knob turned and you entered. 
�You look beautiful darling, up,� I rose and my arms flung around you my bare body pressed against you, your hands wrap around me and your lips pressed onto my forehead. The sweet encounter was brief, and your first order was sent. �Straighten up, clean the bathroom to match the kitchen, make us breakfast,� a smile crossed your lips and mine as you paused, �and we will see what else is needed of you.� 
I made the bed, moved the laundry to the hamper, and tidied the room. And move to the bathroom to continue cleaning, after I was finished I went to get the mop from the kitchen, �what are you doing!� your voice filled with frustration and aggravation. I stopped and dropped the mop back inside the cleaning closet, and bowed my head. �Listening is key,� you started but your aggravation stopped your words. Just hearing your frustration I started to become aggravated myself, I felt as if I were displeasing, that I would never be what you want me to be, but arguing about not being perfect is what got us to this point to begin with. I stood silent trying not to take things personally, only wanting to please you. 
You grabbed my hair without warning and pulled me to the bathroom because of your speed I was walking backwards to the bathroom with my hair tightly in your grasp. I kept trying to keep up with you so the pulling would stop, but to no avail. You turned me around, �kneel,� I was again in front of you in a perfect position to accept you into my mouth. �Close your eyes,� I could not see a thing, �now open your mouth,� I opened wide, and didn&#8217;t even feel your finger as it hovered over my tongue, �suck.� I started to suck but it was not just your finger, I could taste the soap on my tongue and it bubbled in my mouth, but I had hit a breaking point there was no resistance, it was not a fate it was a choice, a choice to be yours, I sucked harder my eyes remained lightly closed. A sigh of relief left your lips, �open your eyes,� as I did you removed your finger. You picked me up so I could reach the sink, without the presence of your finger it almost lost its powerful meaning, but the way I was, the doll you had created, the bond in which was unbreakable, lifted me. �Rinse� I washed the taste out of my mouth, and I could not help but smile at you. 
That night you used every part of my body, and left no area of me untouched, and as I was yours you were mine, and you let me cum over you, over and over, each day I serve you and each day I find my place perfectly by your side, as I do by your feet.
