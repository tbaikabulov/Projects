Chapter I

&nbsp;

Missy&#8217;s last hour of freedom began when=
 she
rolled out of bed, up onto her feet, and padded downstairs to get a glass of
water. She ran her hand through her shaggy-blonde hair, and knuckled some of
the sleep from her eyes, yawning happily as she descended. She never bother=
ed
to dress at times like this, she strode as though she would not have cared =
if
anyone could have seen her. The curtains were drawn, of course, but she lik=
ed
the feel of fresh air upon her skin nonetheless. Cold water flashed onto her
skin as she accidentally turned on the tap. It was going to be one of those
days.

&nbsp;

She idly wandered upstairs again, took a sip =
of
water, then lay back down on the bed. What could=
 be
better than a lovely lazy day? Her hand drifted, as it often did, across her
naked body, circling her navel, and debated whether to move upwards or
downwards. It moved upwards, it had done for a week or two, ever since she
suspected that her breasts felt differently. There was no lump, thankfully,=
 but
they seemed to be a little swollen. It wasn&#8217;t just her imagination ei=
ther
- her blouses felt a little tighter, but the waistband of her skirts were s=
till
as uncumbersome as ever. She had checked yesterday, and could still slide h=
er
hand down the front of her skirt without having to unbutton it, so she
certainly wasn&#8217;t plumping up. She did that more and more, since her l=
ast
boyfriend had gone. 

&nbsp;

She would tell her doctor about it the next t=
ime
she saw him, and sighed when she realised the old bastard would probably te=
ll
her to take her top off again. She didn&#8217;t mind, he seemed like a nice
guy, and he wasn&#8217;t that old either, maybe thirty, thirty-five. Why not
give the guy a thrill if it meant she got extra attention? She certainly
appreciated the specific care with which he prescribed her medicines, produ=
cing
pills from his own desk and telling her to take one, four times a day, and =
the
listless whiteness of her eyes (which he had personally diagnosed during a
routine check-up) would be cured.

&nbsp;

That reminded her &#8211; she opened her beds=
ide
cabinet drawer and pulled out the pill-bottle, took out two pills, and
swallowed them with another sip of water. Sure, it was twice the recommended
dose, but it would get her better twice as fast.

&nbsp;

She wandered to the shower, which was in a sm=
all
en-suite room linked to the bedroom, and turned it on. Hot, hazy jets of wa=
ter
splashed off her milky-white skin, and she lost herself in the pleasant
sensation.

&nbsp;

She did not hear his van pull up. She did not
notice when her back door was opened &#8211; she often left it unlocked on a
Wednesday &#8211; and she was completely unaware when he crept into the
bedroom, locked the door behind himself, and pocketed the key.

&nbsp;

He had a hand over her mouth before she even =
had a
chance to scream. He had burst into the shower, and rammed an elbow against=
 her
throat, forcing her back against the tiles. She recognised him after a blin=
k,
and her frown was not out of fear, but incomprehension. 

&nbsp;

&#8220;Get off me!&#8221; she said, as calmly=
 as
she could. He slapped her hard across the face, and she knew she was in
trouble.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Say another word and I hit you again.&=
#8221;

&nbsp;

&#8220;Fuck you!&#8221; she snarled, and ran =
at
him.

&nbsp;

He pushed her back into the shower, and then =
hit
her with the back of his hand this time, then turned the hand to a fist and
punched her hard in the stomach. Hot water continued to drizzle onto her bo=
dy,
and she spluttered and spat as the after-effects of the punch shook her.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Get the fuck out - mmm!&#8221;

&nbsp;

He had put his hand over her mouth, grabbing =
the
back of her head with his other hand. She would always regret that it was n=
ot
until this moment that she realised she could fight back. She punched him h=
ard
on the nose, he barely flinched, but he did throw her to the bathroom floor.
She banged her head on the wash-basin on the way down, but remained conscio=
us.
He jumped on top of her before she could get up, his legs astride her waist,
his knees pinning her elbows down.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Heeeeeellllp!&#8221; she screamed, but=
 it
sounded weak and exhausted, and was stopped by a third slap across her face=
.

&nbsp;

He began to bounce up and down on her stomach,
winding her repeatedly, trying to sap her strength as much as he could.

&nbsp;

&#8220;What do you want?&#8221; she asked mee=
kly,
dreading the answer. She had now realised that the fact that he had shown h=
is
face to her meant that he was not expecting her to be able to tell anyone a=
bout
it, anytime soon. Again he ignored her, but kept bouncing upon her. He star=
ted
to slap her breasts, with wide, momentum-filled swings of his arm, alternat=
ing
left and right. Her large, firm breasts bounced off each other, becoming pi=
nker
and pinker.

&nbsp;

He seemed to be focussed on his task, he was =
not
distracted or obviously aroused by any wriggling she did, even though she w=
as a
phenomenally pretty girl. He appeared to want to keep sapping her strength
until a key moment was reached. When she sighed plaintively at him, almost
resigned to her forthcoming fucking, it was time. He got up, grabbed her by=
 the
hair, hauled her to her feet, and hurled her against a wall, never letting =
go.
Then she was cast onto the bed, face down, where he pulled out a pair of
handcuffs and pinned them upon her. Pulling up her heels to her hands, he l=
aced
another pair of cuffs around her ankles, chaining her into a makeshift hogt=
ie.

&nbsp;

She began to scream again, perversely because=
 he
could not enter her in that position. This meant that he had something else=
 in
mind, and in her mind, it would be much worse. This was no ordinary maniac.=


&nbsp;

&#8220;Let me the fuck out, you cunt!&#8221;

&nbsp;

Again, he did not respond, except to kick off=
 his
shoes, and tug off his socks. He picked them up, moved over to Missy&#8217;s
face, and her eyes widened.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Open your mouth, Missy.&#8221;

&nbsp;

&#8220;Fuck off!&#8221;

&nbsp;

He did not ask twice. He held her nose hard b=
etween
finger and thumb, twisted it painfully, and when she opened her mouth to
breathe, he popped one sock into her mouth. She tried to bite his fingers, =
but
he was too quick, and then she tried to spit out the sock, but his hand was
already clamped over her mouth, holding it in place. When her struggle stop=
ped
for a brief moment, he pushed the second sock into her mouth, filling it
entirely.

&nbsp;

He had come prepared. He pulled out a role of
duct-tape, and began to wrap it around the bottom of her face, being careful
not to get too much stuck on her wet, blonde hair.

&nbsp;

Only then, after all of that effort, could he
relax. He looked at Missy, lying on the bed, wriggling, turning her chin to=
 her
shoulder to try to peel the tape from her face. He smiled evilly when he mu=
sed
that she would be thinking that things could not get any worse than this. 

&nbsp;

With her secured, he could finally clean up t=
he
house. He turned off the still-running shower, turned off the gas and
electricity, and went to his van. There he pulled out a heavy-duty plastic
cage, a two foot cube. He found it ugly, but it was sturdy, and would hold a
chained-up woman with no problems at all.

&nbsp;

When he returned, he saw that Missy had bounc=
ed
herself to the edge of the bed, and was looking over the edge, wondering wh=
ere
it would get her. He smiled a little, it was muc=
h more
fun when they were feisty.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Very well, let&#8217;s see how this wi=
ll
work.&#8221;

&nbsp;

He placed the cage, open, at the edge of the =
bed on
the side where Missy wriggled, and placed a pillow in the base of the cage.=


&nbsp;

&#8220;Get into the cage,&#8221; he said.

&nbsp;

Missy said nothing. She stopped wriggling,
she decided that playing dead might work.

&nbsp;

The doctor removed his belt, and unfurled it.
Without asking a second time, he thrashed it against the left flank closest=
 to
him. Missy jumped, but made no sound. He hit her on the right, with a simil=
ar
reaction. It was fun to beat her this way, but he was a busy man, and had to
expedite matters.

&nbsp;

He stepped in front of her, and pulled a smal=
l box
out of his pocket. She looked up at him, confused, and saw that it was a bo=
x of
thumbtacks. He smiled down at her, and began to push pin after pin into his
belt. She looked up at him, and her eyes flashed with disbelief. Surely he
wouldn&#8217;t&#8230;

&nbsp;

After a dozen pins were pushed through the be=
lt, he
poured the rest of the box into the cage, onto the pillow. Then he stood ba=
ck.
Again without warning, he lashed Missy&#8217;s left flank. The pins scraped
across her skin, causing thin white scratch marks. She roared in pain, even
behind the socks it was a blood-curdling scream, but he showed no mercy. He
walked to her other side, and brought the belt down on her right buttock. H=
er
arms had moved over to the left side to feel the pain, and had left her rig=
ht
side unprotected. He got in another blow, the first time her skin was broke=
n. A
drop of blood trickled down her side, onto the bed. She realised she had no
choice. She edged forwards, expecting the beating to stop as she did so,
because she was finally obeying. She was wrong. He brought the belt down ag=
ain,
this time on the back of her arms. She began to weep, and inched forwards. =
She
was on the point of toppling into the cage, when he tilted it a little, so =
she
would not fall forwards two feet onto the base, she would slide down the ba=
rs. 

&nbsp;

In no way was she grateful. She hated that he=
 cared
for her about potential broken bones, yet was quite comfortable with beating
her until she bled. She leaned forwards, and slid into the cage, landing
breasts-first, and half a dozen pins pecked into her skin. Tears flowed down
her cheeks and gathered at the tape around her mouth. Angry snot welled in =
her
nose, making it difficult and messy to breathe. The lid of the cage was loo=
ped
over the top, and locked in place.

&nbsp;

He lifted her up, and began to drag her down =
the
stairs to his van. Even at this early stage, he admired her defiance. Even =
so,
he wanted to see if she learned the lesson. If she obeyed, she would get so=
me
pain. If she didn&#8217;t, she would be punished.




Chapter II

&nbsp;

The doctor pulled up his long, secluded drive=
, and
backed the van into the garage. He got out, and entered the house. He was i=
n no
rush to get her inside, he had all the time in h=
er
world. Besides, there were preparations that needed to be made. The guests
would arrive in six hours. 

&nbsp;

He called his contact at the police departmen=
t, who
pledged to ensure that any missing-persons call for Missy would be given a =
low
priority, then he incinerated the clothes he was
wearing when he was at Missy&#8217;s house, just to be safe. He was a stick=
ler
for preparation.

&nbsp;

Inside her cage, in the darkness in the back =
of the
van, Missy whimpered. She had not managed to get comfortable, despite the
pillow, and each time she tried to wriggle a pin free from her breast, she
would find herself rolling her bottom onto two others.

&nbsp;

In a way, she was glad that she could not see
herself, for she would have winced at the spots of blood that covered her b=
ody,
cried at the sight of the marks on her wrists and ankles where the cuffs and
bitten into her, and broken down completely at the guilt she felt for allow=
ing
herself to be captured. She had replayed the brutal scene again and again,
trying to imagine where she could have struck him and escaped.

&nbsp;

The minutes passed, and there was no sound at=
 all.
She hoped, she really began to expect the police=
 to
have caught up with him, and be interrogating him now. He would crack, the cowardly bastard, and then she would be back
home. 

&nbsp;

At the exact moment Missy dreamed of the doct=
or
admitting his guilt to the police, the doctor made a decision.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Three &#8211; eight &#8211; fifteen,&#=
8221;
he said aloud.

&nbsp;

Missy had sank int=
o a
meditative state, relying on positive visualisation to see her through, but
stirred when she heard someone approaching. The stale sock in her mouth was
turning to mush, and she braced herself to greet her rescuers with the bigg=
est
smile she could muster.

&nbsp;

The door of the van opened, and she whined as
though all her hopes had gone. It was him, the doctor, and he held a set of
shackles.

&nbsp;

He opened the cage inside the van, and pulled=
 her
out, laying her on her front. He brushed off a few of the pins, but only th=
ose
that he was in danger of pricking himself with. 

&nbsp;

The shackles would go on the front of her bod=
y, so
he put the ankle restraints on first, then rolle=
d her
onto her front. She struggled, pulling her legs apart, then together, clank=
ing
the cuffs against each other, but knew it was pointless. She would have to =
take
advantage of the moment where her wrists were free. 

&nbsp;

He knew this.

&nbsp;

He grabbed her by the back of the head, held =
her
head in place, and slapped her face three times with his right hand. She oomped a cry of pain after each one. Then he chang=
ed
hands, and slapped her left side. More oomps.

&nbsp;

He did not say a word, he
hoped the message had got through.

&nbsp;

It had, it was there already, but her survival
instinct told her that she HAD to fight back. She would be defiant, no matt=
er
how much it cost her. He undid one of the cuffs, the right, but held hold of
it. Instantly, she tried to bring her fists up, first the left, then the ri=
ght.
She managed to get two blows in on him before he had hold of her wrists aga=
in.
He pinned them down with his feet, and then &#8211; after a great effort
&#8211; got the heavy cuffs onto her.

&nbsp;

He admired her resilience; many other girls i=
n a
similar situation would have been more compliant. Others might actually be
trying to find as much enjoyment as they could from the situation. Not this
girl, this one was proud. He smiled when he thought of how she would feel a=
fter
tonight. She lay on her back, wrists held togeth=
er
with a one-foot chain, ankles held the same distance apart, with a third,
three-foot chain linking the other two.

&nbsp;

He knew she would not move unless forced to, =
so it
was certainly time for the collar, an inch-wide steel band, the perfect size
for her neck, having measured it during a &#8220;routine&#8221; examination=
 two
months earlier. It wrapped snugly around her neck, and neatly locked into p=
lace
with a firm click. It was expert craftsmanship &#8211; there was no obvious
keyhole, and eight tidy eyebolts were spaced evenly around its circumferenc=
e.

&nbsp;

He still had not said a word to her. This was=
 quite
deliberate, he knew that it would unnerve her. I=
n a
hostage situation, it was the kidnappers who said little who inflicted more
fear on their captives.

&nbsp;

He carefully eased the duct tape from her fac=
e,
ensuring he did not rip any hair out of her &#8211; her hair being a reason=
 he
had chosen her. Not the primary reason, that was her delicious body, but qu=
ite
high on the list.

&nbsp;

Missy spat out the socks, and yelled &#8220;A=
aaaaaaaaarghhhh!
Hellllllpppp!&#8221; but guessed it was pointless. If there was anyone remo=
tely
within earshot, she doubted they would come to her aid. Still, it felt good=
. 

&nbsp;

The doctor watched with apparent disinterest,
though inside his trousers, a large erection was stirring. The screams of a
hurt young woman were music to his ears. He put his right hand into his poc=
ket,
and pulled out a leash.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Why, why are you doing this to me?&#82=
21;

&nbsp;

With a sigh, he approached her, and clipped t=
he
six-foot-long leash onto the centre of the collar.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Let me go, I won&#8217;t tell anyone, I
promise. W-what have I done to you?&#8221;

&nbsp;

Then he walked slowly away, holding the colla=
r.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Where-where are you going?&#8221;=


&nbsp;

Missy lay motionless, until the leash became =
taut. 

&nbsp;

&#8220;Erk!&#8221; she grunted.

&nbsp;

He continued to walk away, and she realised h=
e had
a strength that was not apparent from his appearance. She was forcibly drag=
ged
to the edge of the inside of the van, and realised she would fall.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Wait!!&#8221; she cried, positioning h=
erself
so she would land on her feet. The doctor did not wait, but grinned to himself that she had realised that obedience was good =
for
her.

&nbsp;

The clankity-clank of her shackles was deligh=
tful
as he led her out of the garage, into a hallway. She looked around for clue=
s as
to his motives, and tried to discern escape routes, but one thing she did
notice was the restrained but obvious wealth. She could not see out of the
front door, but knew that there would be vast grounds surrounding the build=
ing.
Her heart sank. She could scream all day and all night, and no-one would he=
ar.

&nbsp;

No-one but him.

&nbsp;

He led her into a room directly off the hall.=
 It
was a small sitting room, about fifteen-feet on each wall, with a couch on =
two
of them. Aside from that, there was nothing particularly strange about the =
room,
thought Missy, until she saw the eyebolt in the floor.

&nbsp;

The doctor stood over the eyebolt, the leash =
still
at its full length. The naked girl looked at him, not moving, and he was ju=
st
about to pull on the leash to bring her closer, when he had an idea. With a
padlock that both of them expected him to use, he locked his end of the lea=
sh
to the eyebolt in the floor, leaving her with a six-foot radius in which to
move, which surprised her.

&nbsp;

Then he left, shuffling past her before she c=
ould
even speak to him.

&nbsp;

He walked to the van, picked up the belt with=
 the
pins in it, and walked back to the room. Missy had not moved from her posit=
ion,
even choosing to face away from him, and not acknowledge his return. He drew
back the belt, and whacked it across the back of her thighs.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Nyaaaaaaaaa!&#8221; she roared. &#8220;Fucking hell!&#8221;

&nbsp;

He hit her again, lower this time, on the bac=
k of
her knees.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Nooooooooo!=
 All right!&#8221; she yelled at=
 the top
of her voice. &#8220;I&#8217;ll move, I&#8217;ll move.&#8221;

&nbsp;

She hobbled forwards, and knelt gingerly befo=
re the
eyebolt. It was not exactly where he wanted her, but knew that it was all he
could expect. She could not have known that kneeling would be too high a
position.

&nbsp;

He crouched beside her, and unlocked
&#8216;his&#8217; end of the leash from the eyebolt. She sobbed patheticall=
y,
tears streaming down her cheeks, as he tugged on &#8216;her&#8217; end, pul=
ling
her to a face-down position. There, he padlocked the eyebolt directly to her
collar, giving her zero movement. Her breasts squished underneath her body,=
 and
she had to pull her ankles up a little, raising her bottom into the air.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Please, why are you doing this to me?&=
#8221;
she cooed, trying to lay a guilt-trip on him, correctly guessing it would n=
ot
work.

&nbsp;

He strode to the sofa, and pulled out a sturdy
metal bar. Typically, it was expertly crafted, containing four holes evenly
spread across its thirty-inch length. The middle two holes fit evenly around
her wrists, and he locked them on before removing the other restraints. The
outer two holes went over her ankles.

&nbsp;

He left, heading upstairs to wash, shave and
change. The time was six o&#8217;clock. His guests would arrive in an hour.=


&nbsp;

Alone, Missy considered her position. She cou=
ld not
help but think of how she had come to be like this, and what she would do to
him if she got the chance. Not normally a violent woman, she daydreamed of =
the
tortures she would inflict on him. 

&nbsp;

Such thoughts did not help, and as the time d=
ragged
on, her body began to betray her. She squirmed uncomfortably, trying to get
into a position where there was no strain anywhere, but found it impossible=
. If
she reached her arms downwards, she would push forwards on her shoulders,
causing her neck to lift up. If she tried to pull up her knees, her thigh
muscles would strain abominably.

&nbsp;

She wondered if it was wrong to wish for some=
thing
to happen, for something to take her mind off her situation.

&nbsp;

She got her wish, when she heard the doctor&#=
8217;s
voice for the first time in hours.

&nbsp;

&#8220;She&#8217;s in here,&#8221; he said, l=
eading
three people into the room. &#8220;She&#8217;s been dying to meet you all.&=
#8221;




Chapter III

&nbsp;

Three people followed the doctor into the roo=
m.
Missy thought they were the most extraordinary people she had ever seen, but
only because of the third person. Leading was a married couple,
him dressed in a casual shirt and a pair of slacks. He was about thirty,
clean-shaven, slightly receding hair, and looked like a middle-manager in
marketing. Next to him was a devilishly pretty redhead, slim, also thirty, =
with
a tight black blouse and a flimsy skirt that ended above the knees. She was=
 probably
an inch or two smaller than Missy, maybe 5&#8217;5&#8221;, but the short sk=
irt
made her look taller, and her bare legs snaked down to calf-length boots, a=
lso
black. Missy could not see from her position, but guessed that she would no=
t be
the type who wore underwear.

&nbsp;

The third person was the reason why Missy did=
 not
even bother to cry for help. It was a young woman, maybe twenty, thin,
brunette. Her breasts were small, but suited her diminutive size. She was n=
aked
and barefoot, and had a compliant peace in her eyes. She was unrestrained, =
save
for a collar similar to Missy&#8217;s. A chain led from the collar to the
redhead&#8217;s hand.

&nbsp;

The redhead cooed excitedly when she saw Miss=
y.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Oh look at her! Congratulations, you m=
ust be
so pleased.&#8221;

&nbsp;

The doctor spoke. &#8220;Yes, Dinah, I do lik=
e big
breasts. It&#8217;s the biggest thing wrong with Scrap.&#8221;

&nbsp;

The brunette cast her head to the floor,
crestfallen. Dinah pulled the leash, and Scrap padded over to her.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Nipples,&#8221; said Dinah, handing Sc=
rap a
piece of sandpaper.

&nbsp;

Missy&#8217;s mouth dropped open when she saw=
 Scrap
take the paper, and rub it hard on her nipples. She could actually see the
breast gradually become red, Scrap&#8217;s hand was a blur, and her elbow w=
as
cocked in a way that Missy could see the force she was putting into it. Aft=
er
fifteen seconds on one nipple, she moved to the other. She continued to do =
so,
biting her lip and blinking away tears. &#8216;Why was she doing that to
herself?&#8217; thought Missy. 

&nbsp;

Away from the women, the two men were discuss=
ing in
low voices. Missy could not hear, though the gesticulations they made were =
not
comforting. She returned her gaze to poor Scrap, just as the first tears be=
gan
to drift down her cheek.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Cuntlips,&#8221; said Dinah. Scrap sna=
pped
her hand quickly from her nipple to her pussy, leaning forwards to get a be=
tter
angle. Again, she rubbed herself hard, back and forth, changing hands when =
she
got tired. Missy was too far away to see any effect on her pussy, but looki=
ng
at the deep red scratches on her breasts made her wince.

&nbsp;

Dinah turned to look at Missy, and smiled.
&#8220;Clit,&#8221; she said.

&nbsp;

Scrap clenched her eyes shut for a second, th=
en
opened them again, as though it was wrong to shut them. Missy knew that Scr=
ap
would look delectable if she was doing this in a shower, with no sandpaper,=
 and
water dripping down her skin. As it was, she looked pitiable. Missy could n=
ot
feel too much sympathy for her, because she was saving as much as she could=
 for
herself.

&nbsp;

Scrap began to sob, but Dinah had still not t=
aken
her eyes off Missy. Missy realised that she was the only one watching the p=
oor
slavegirl, so turned her head. Perhaps if no-one was watching, Scrap would =
be
able to stop.

&nbsp;

The &#8216;scrit-scrit&#8217; sound of sandpa=
per
against skin continued.

&nbsp;

Dinah had joined the men in their quiet
conversation, so Scrap was completely ignored. She continued to rub her cli=
t,
as ordered.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Stop,&#8221; said Dinah, eventually. S=
he
took the paper from Scrap, and put it back into her handbag. Then, and Missy
guessed it would happen, she slapped Scrap hard =
on her
pussy. Scrap yelped aloud, a stifled yell. She was slapped again, a harder =
blow
this time, but she made no sound this time. Dinah, obviously satisfied, sat
down on one of the sofas. &nbsp;Her
partner was already seated. Scrap knelt at their feet. The doctor was stand=
ing
and smiling.

&nbsp;

&#8220;I haven&#8217;t trained her yet, I wan=
ted
you to see her as she is. She&#8217;s been quite the fighter, I have to
admit.&#8221;

&nbsp;

Dinah smiled. &#8220;Scrap was relatively wil=
ling.
Poor thing lost her defiance early on. Still, this should be good for her,
y&#8217;know? Be nice to see where she was six months ago.&#8221; 

&nbsp;

&#8216;Six months?&#8217; thought Missy. They=
 had
her six months? Even worse was her obedience. Would Missy be that obedient
after six months? She promised herself that she would resist. They would ha=
ve
to fill her with tranquilizers to get her to comply.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Can I ask for Scrap&#8217;s remote con=
trol
for this?&#8221; asked the doctor, and Dinah readily handed it over. It was=
 a
small, sturdy black box, about an inch and a half long, and an inch wide, h=
alf
an inch high. It had two large buttons on the front, one of which had an
&#8220;A&#8221; written on it, the other had a &#8220;C&#8221;.

&nbsp;

The man said his first words. &#8220;Scrap, k=
neel
two feet in front of Missy. Knees apart.&#8221;

&nbsp;

Scrap got to her feet,
head bowed, and scuttled to the required point. When her knees were apart,
Missy could see the scarring on her, that the
sandpaper had caused. There was severe redness, contrasting hard against her
bright-white skin. This was not a girl who had seen much sun for a while.

&nbsp;

The doctor crouched next to Missy&#8217;s hea=
d, and
placed the remove control under her chin. Dinah clapped loudly, then cheered when Missy tried to bite the doctor&#8217=
;s
hand.

&nbsp;

&#8220;A demonstration,&#8221; said the man. =
The
doctor nodded, and pushed Missy&#8217;s head forwards, so her chin pressed =
on
both buttons.

&nbsp;

Scrap&#8217;s reaction was astonishing. Missy
expected to see some discomfort, but Scrap convulsed as though she was on f=
ire.
She roared a yell that echoed around the small room, leaning back, placing =
her
hands on her knees to keep them apart. 

&nbsp;

Missy tried to lift her head, but the doctor =
had firm
hold of it. Her eyes were staring at Scrap, darting over her pretty, jiggli=
ng
body, flashing up to her face, but quickly looking away, guiltily. She wond=
ered
what that pain would feel like, what with Scrap not making a sound with the
sandpaper.

&nbsp;

Finally, the doctor let go, and Missy raised =
her
chin. Scrap&#8217;s wriggling stopped, she breathed in, then out, then in, =
and
it was then that the emotion overcame her. She began to sob, lumpy tears
falling from her face, onto her chest and thighs. Missy wondered if Scrap&#=
8217;s
reaction was because of her, because she was witnessing her own first night,
and reliving her own experience.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Eddie and I were wondering,&#8221; sai=
d Dinah
to the doctor. &#8220;Have you talked to young Missy yet?&#8221;=


&nbsp;

&#8220;Barely a word.&#8221;

&nbsp;

&#8220;Good.=
&nbsp;
That&#8217;s where we went wrong with Scrap, we talked to her too mu=
ch
too early, didn&#8217;t we, Scrap?&#8221;

&nbsp;

&#8220;Yes mistress,&#8221; said Scrap.

&nbsp;

&#8220;&#8217;Yes mistress&#8217;&#8221;, ech=
oed Dinah,
imitating Scrap&#8217;s timid response. Missy saw the reaction that this ge=
ntle
mocking had on Scrap, it was like a slap in the face. 

&nbsp;

Missy chose to concentrate on herself. The on=
ly
thing she did to think of Scrap was to keep her head raised as much as she
could, but she no longer wanted to worry about her. She closed her eyes, and
went through a routine where she flexed each muscle in an attempt to get
comfortable. The strain on her arms and shoulders was particularly difficul=
t to
bear, but her breasts felt tender, with the weight of her upper body pushing
them against the carpeted floor.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Eddie? Can you help here a second?&#82=
21;
asked the doctor. Eddie got up quickly, and stepped to Missy&#8217;s feet.
&#8220;That&#8217;s it, lift her up.&#8221;

&nbsp;

Missy felt herself being lifted up by the bar=
 that
held her ankles and wrists. The first problem with this was that it forced =
her
head forwards, and she could not help but put her chin on the remote contro=
l,
though only on the &#8220;C&#8221;. Scrap began to scream immediately. Missy
ignored her, she wondered what was happening to
herself.

&nbsp;

The doctor placed a mat underneath Missy&#821=
7;s
chest, and upon doing so, Eddie lowered the bar to the floor.

&nbsp;

Missy whimpered in pain: the mat had dozens of
sharp quarter-inch pinpricks on it, and suddenly she wished for breasts like
Scrap&#8217;s. 

&nbsp;

&#8220;Nooo,&#8221; she sighed. She had vowed=
 not
to give Eddie and Dinah the pleasure of begging, and was pleased that Dinah=
 did
not seem as interested in her as when she first arrived. She lifted her hea=
d,
and Scrap&#8217;s torment ended for the moment.

&nbsp;

Missy took a deep breath. She suspected somet=
hing
was about to happen to her pussy, because her mouth was too low, and her
breasts had been taken care of. She wondered how she would deal with being
fucked in this position.

&nbsp;

And then, then something happened that was wo=
rse
than she had feared. It was a glob of spit onto her asshole. 

&nbsp;

&#8220;Nooo!!!&#8221; she yelled.

&nbsp;

The doctor ignored her, and forced a finger i=
nto
her anus. Missy&#8217;s hips wriggled at the discomfort, she had never put
anything up there before, and now, in full view of three strangers, her doc=
tor
was about to&#8230;

&nbsp;

She blocked the thought from her mind. Surely=
 he
wouldn&#8217;t? &#8220;Wahaaaa!&#8221; she cried as a second finger entered
her. 

&nbsp;

&#8220;Remember this, Scrap?&#8221; Eddie cal=
led
out.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; mused Scrap
unenthusiastically.

&nbsp;

The doctor began to slide his fingers in and =
out of
Missy&#8217;s unprotected rear, gradually quickening the pace, and deepening
the stroke. He was peering with interest at her reaction, judging the right
moment to stop.

&nbsp;

Dinah and Eddie cuddled up together, watching=
 the
show, silent with anticipation.

&nbsp;

Missy again worried &#8211; nothing was happe=
ning.
The fingers had stopped, and had been removed. She felt her ass pulse, and =
the
feeling was unfamiliar and uncomfortable. She was saving her energy for the
moment she knew would come.

&nbsp;

When the doctor unzipped himself, Missy had h=
er
eyes clenched shut, but heard a gasp from Scrap, and a rustle of clothes fr=
om
the direction of the sofa. Then he placed it at the entrance to her ass, and
she exploded.

&nbsp;

&#8220;No, NOOO, get the fuck off me, you cunt
bastard!&#8221; she called, wriggling and jiggling. It was a huge effort to
move even half an inch, but she bounced up and down in her bonds, feeling t=
he
pinpricks enter, leave and re-enter the skin on her sore, bleeding breasts.=
 

&nbsp;

The doctor laughed at her reaction, knowing h=
ow
pointless it was. He waited, stroking himself while keeping half an eye on
Scrap, who was jerking wildly as both buttons were pressed by Missy&#8217;s
chin.

&nbsp;

When the explosion happened, he originally pl=
anned
to wait it out, but realised that was unambitious. So, placing a firm hand =
on
each buttock, he held her solidly in place, instantly reducing the violence=
 of
her protest. He placed his cock at her ass again, and this time he did not
wait. He pushed himself in.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Aaaaaaahhhh,&#8221; he sighed loudly, =
as
inch after inch filled her.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Noooooooooooo!&#8221; Missy roared.=


&nbsp;

Poor Scrap appeared to be on the point of pas=
sing
out, but no-one paid the remotest bit of attention to her.

&nbsp;

The doctor forced himself as full as he could=
 into
her, six inches, then he let go of her back. She felt the release, and bega=
n to
buck more. Her wriggles helped him get a rhythm going, and he started to fu=
ck
her properly.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Mmmm,&#8221; he purred appreciatively.=
 

&nbsp;

Missy&#8217;s submission was complete. She so=
bbed
again, and though she had had nothing to eat or drink all day, the tears ke=
pt
flowing from somewhere. She decided to be brave. She lifted her head. =


&nbsp;

Dinah saw this, and roared with laughter at t=
he
absurdity of it all.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Thank her, Scrap,&#8221; she called ou=
t.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Thank you, Missy,&#8221; said Scrap, w=
ith a
smile of genuine appreciation.

&nbsp;

Meanwhile, the doctor had started to increase=
 the
intensity of his penetration. He placed a hand on her back to steady himself, and found it slipping on her perspiration. 

&nbsp;

&#8220;You enjoying this, Missy?&#8221; he as=
ked.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Fuck you,&#8221; she snarled, which pr=
oduced
a wince from Scrap, because she knew that Missy would pay for it.

&nbsp;

The doctor was pleased with her reaction,
it proved that she had received no training. Excited, he fucked her ass with
three deep strokes, then fell over her as he cam=
e into
her.

&nbsp;

Missy did not know whether to scream or not. =
She
was disgusted that he would leave his cum inside her, but hoped that her
torment would be over for the night. He withdrew his cock, and stood up.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Scrap, clean him,&#8221; said Eddie. S=
crap
shuffled over to the doctor and began to lick the juice and sweat from his
member.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Very kind of you,&#8221; the doctor sa=
id to
Eddie. Then, and purely for Missy&#8217;s benefit as each of the others knew
it, he added &#8220;Eventually I&#8217;ll get Missy to do it, but she&#8217=
;s
probably in a bit of a bitey mood at the moment.&#8221;

&nbsp;

Missy felt her ass clench, and it squeezed ou=
t some
of his cum, which dribbled down her inner thighs.

&nbsp;

&#8220;P-p-please, no more,&#8221; she whimpe=
red.

&nbsp;

&#8220;My dear, we have barely started,&#8221;
replied the doctor, his large cock getting hard again in Scrap&#8217;s small
mouth.




Chapter IV

&nbsp;

After he had cum in her pussy, following an e=
qually
brutal screwing, the doctor suggested that it was time for the second part =
of
Missy&#8217;s introduction. He attached the chain to her collar, and unfast=
ened
the leg-holes of the bar. Missy realised that she effectively had a weapon =
now,
but chose to bide her time. She walked behind him, her arms relaxed in fron=
t of
her, not quite letting the leash get taut.

&nbsp;

Then she swung. She drew back her arms, ready=
 to
hit him on the back of the skull, when she was tackled from behind.

&nbsp;

It was Scrap.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Good girl, Scrap!&#8221; beamed Dinah.=


&nbsp;

The doctor looked furiously at Missy. He reac=
hed
down, grabbed the bar with one hand, and pulled her quickly into another ro=
om.
This one was the same size, but looked more ominous than the previous one. =
No
sofas, in fact, no anything, save for a large chest that filled the base of=
 one
wall, and various bolts and hooks on the solid ceiling, brick walls and con=
crete
floor.

&nbsp;

Dinah, Eddie and Scrap held back. It was impo=
rtant
for the doctor to stamp his authority on Missy before they continued. Missy=
, in
turn, wanted to undermine that authority, so spoke first.=


&nbsp;

&#8220;A little fucking girl like Scrap saves=
 you,
are you proud of yourself, huh? Cunt. And what now? I suppose you&#8217;re going to slap me =
when I
can&#8217;t move my fucking hands, aren&#8217;t you? Fu=
cking
coward.&#8221;

&nbsp;

He did something that surprised her. He unloc=
ked
her arm restrictions. Turning around, turning his back on her, he placed the
restraint on the floor. 

&nbsp;

&#8220;If you beat me, you can go,&#8221; he =
said.
And he meant it.

&nbsp;

She had no choice, she attacked him. He dodge=
d her,
and tripped her up, she scuffed her knees on the
concrete floor, but was up quickly, breasts bouncing angrily, and ran at him
again. He grabbed her by the wrists this time, and dragged her to the floor,
where he pinioned her in the same way he did that morning.

&nbsp;

This time, however, he fixed her wrists toget=
her
with one hand, and placed the other hand on her neck. And then, then he
squeezed.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Achhh, urkkk,&#8221; gurgled
Missy.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Do you admit defeat?&#8221; he asked h=
er.
She shook her head, so he kept his hand in place &#8211; if it were any
tighter, it could have crushed her throat. Even so, it still restricted her
breathing enough for her to lie defiantly for a minute or so, before noddin=
g.

&nbsp;

&#8220;You admit defeat?&#8221;

&nbsp;

Nod.

&nbsp;

&#8220;You had your chance to escape, but I b=
eat
you?&#8221;

&nbsp;

Pause. Tears. Nod.=


&nbsp;

He stood up, and told her to kneel. She knelt=
. &#8220;Arms behind your back.&#8221;=


&nbsp;

Missy limply held her hands together. For the=
 first
time that day, she was unrestrained. No-one held her le=
ash,
no-one had hold of her hair, neck, arm. But still, still she knelt.

&nbsp;

The doctor walked to the cabinet, and opened =
it,
pulling out a long black tube. He walked back and wrapped it around her arm=
s.
It began about four inches above the elbow, and went all the way down around
her hands, with lace holes all the way down. The doctor efficiently tighten=
ed
the binder, evenly all the way up her arms, careful not to pull it too tigh=
t,
as Missy would be wearing it for a while. It would be most inconvenient if =
she
had a dislocated shoulder or circulation problems.

&nbsp;

Missy, however, thought it was appallingly
uncomfortable. Her elbows were virtually together, her wrists were together,
and her breasts jutted out obscenely and invitingly. Dinah could not hold
herself back, she stepped up and gave them a squeeze, then walked away, bac=
k to
Scrap with a frown, giving Scrap&#8217;s face an open-handed slap. No words
were necessary, Scrap knew why she had been slap=
ped.

&nbsp;

The binding was complete,=

Missy&#8217;s hands were in an inverted prayer, which was probably appropri=
ate.
She was dragged to the centre of the room, underneath the largest hook. To
everyone save Missy, it was clear what the position was going to be. 

&nbsp;

Firstly, Missy&#8217;s ankles were spread by =
a bar,
not uncomfortably so, only three feet, but it certainly left her in an even
more vulnerable position. Then, a pulley was attached to the hook, and a ro=
pe
looped through it. It was tied around Missy&#8217;s wrists, and pulled. Mis=
sy
leaned forwards and went up to the balls of her feet, but that was not high=
 enough.
They pulled an inch or two more until her arms were dangerously slanted, ri=
ght on
tip-toes.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Time for dinner, I think,=
&#8221;
said the doctor, as he tied her firmly into place. He went to the cabinet, and pul=
led out
a large bag, which he tossed to Scrap. He was a stickler for formalities, so
said nothing, waiting for Scrap&#8217;s owners to tell her what to do.=


&nbsp;

&#8220;Scrap,&#8221; said Eddie, &#8220;put a=
ll of
those pegs on her body. The doctor tells me there are some clamps in there =
too, I want those on her nipples and cunt. Do not put =
any on
her bottom. You may not speak.&#8221;

&nbsp;

Scrap nodded.

&nbsp;

The doctor smiled. Missy had shown some
subservience, so he felt he could speak to her a little more. He wanted each
word to hurt.

&nbsp;

&#8220;I saw Scrap looking at Missy before, I think we have to remove the temptation.
Missy&#8217;s cunt could turn Scrap&#8217;s head, couldn&#8217;t it?&#8221;=


&nbsp;

&#8220;I agree,&#8221; sniffed Dinah. &#8220;=
But
Scrap has licked a lot of ass in her time, and we&#8217;d want to take that
possibility away too.&#8221;

&nbsp;

The doctor had already pulled out the required
items from the cabinet. He held the first one in front of Missy, untangling=
 the
straps. Missy winced, it was at least four inches long, and if she had
something that big in her pussy, she knew it would not be comfortable.=


&nbsp;

&#8220;Open your mouth,&#8221; said the docto=
r.

&nbsp;

Missy did so automatically, and gasped when s=
he
realised why. The gag was forced into her mouth, and quickly tightened. Her
mouth was full of foul plastic, and she had to concentrate hard to avoid
choking.

&nbsp;

She was thinking so hard, she did not notice =
the
doctor approaching her back, where he placed a large plug at her asshole. It
was still a little loose after the thorough reaming it had had, so the plug
slid in more easily than it would otherwise. But then she heard a
&#8216;shh-shh&#8217; sound, and felt the plug grow inside her. =


&nbsp;

&#8220;Mmmmnng!&#8221; she whimpered.

&nbsp;

Next, a dildo was shoved inside her. This had=
 a
slightly unusual shape &#8211; a large, firm head on top of a flexible stem=
. It
felt like a billiard ball being shoved into her with a lot of force. This t=
oo,
was inflated, and she felt absurdly stretched. The doctor pushed two fingers
into the base of her belly, and showed Dinah the outline of the &#8216;bill=
iard
ball&#8217;, visible through her skin.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Mmmm!&#8221; drool=
ed
Dinah.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Mmmmnn!&#8221; fro=
wned
Missy.

&nbsp;

The three clothed people laughed, and left. 

&nbsp;

Straight away, Scrap set to work. She pulled =
out
some clothes pegs first, and began to place them on Missy&#8217;s breasts. =
They
seemed like ordinary pegs, but still caused a grunt from Missy as each one =
was
placed on. And then&#8230;

&nbsp;

&#8220;MMM!&#8221; she squeaked, as another w=
ent
on.

&nbsp;

Scrap looked closer at the peg, and silently =
held
it up for Missy to see what the problem was. Missy saw that it had a thumbt=
ack
pushed through it, so the tip poked through. Scrap then put it back on Miss=
y.

&nbsp;

As more and more pegs filled Missy&#8217;s br=
easts,
it became apparent that about one peg in four was spiked. Missy&#8217;s head
lolled as she looked down at the pinched, pained flesh under her. She felt
emotion rise within her, but it was not fear or self-pity, it was anger. She
lifted her head and stared at Scrap, mouthing obscenities at her. She did n=
ot
blame Scrap for the pegs, but she certainly wanted to know why Scrap had
stopped her hitting the doctor.

&nbsp;

Scrap looked demoralised and guilty, but knew=
 she
could not speak. Missy continued swearing at her from behind the gag. And t=
hen,
then something absolutely amazing happened. Scrap spoke.

&nbsp;

&#8220;If you had hit him, we would both be d=
ead by
now,&#8221; she whispered.

&nbsp;

Missy&#8217;s stifled shouts stopped. Scrap
continued to place peg after peg on Missy&#8217;s skin. The breasts, as big=
 as
they were, were now full, so more pegs went on the upper arms, the sides of=
 the
body, and the inner thighs.

&nbsp;

Finally, the pegs ran out. But there were sti=
ll the
clamps. Scrap upended the bag: four clover clamps and two alligator clamps
tinkled to the floor. She picked up the clover clamps first, and knelt at
Missy&#8217;s side, pulling the cuntlips out from around the sides of the d=
ildo
that stayed deep inside her. She knew there was no easy way to do it, so op=
ened
the clamp and put it on quickly. Missy&#8217;s legs shook in pain, and
plaintive cries came from behind the gag.

&nbsp;

The second, third and fourth clover clamps we=
re
added, two on each cuntlip. She had saved the worst till last, because it m=
eant
that they would be on her for the least amount of time. She stood again, re=
ached
inbetween a dozen pegs on Missy&#8217;s left breast, pulled on the nipple,
giving it the tiniest tender tweak, but then dug the alligator clip in, und=
er
the base of the nipple, and let go.

&nbsp;

If she had not been restrained in such a way,=
 Missy
would have fallen to the floor. The pain was excruciating. It felt as though
someone had forced two forks either side of her nipple, and was pushing them
together. The second was worse, because she knew what was coming. Again,
muffled conversation came from her mouth, but this time Scrap was silent.

&nbsp;

Scrap then did something that puzzled Missy. =
She
walked to a corner of the room, knelt, and placed her head in the bottom
corner, her forehead on the cold concrete floor. Missy guessed correctly th=
at
this was Scrap&#8217;s &#8216;default&#8217; position, the pose she had to
adopt when she had not been told otherwise.

&nbsp;

Again, Missy frowned. Scrap had clearly been =
taken
against her will, and been kept in captivity and trained to such an extent =
that
she would obey someone even when they were not able to see her. It sent a h=
ard
shiver down Missy&#8217;s spine when she realised that they would expect he=
r to
end up like Scrap.

&nbsp;

It felt like forever, but it was probably onl=
y five
minutes before the three returned. Dinah looked particularly happy, and Mis=
sy
could see some redness on Dinah&#8217;s inner thighs. She hoped it hurt.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Look at this!&#8221; said Eddie, impre=
ssed.
&#8220;Scrap, come here, look at your handy-work.&#8221;

&nbsp;

Scrap stood up, and turned. Missy noticed that
Scrap could not bring herself to look in Eddie&#8217;s face. Eddie noticed
this, and his smile stopped.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Did you disobey us?&#8221; he asked.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; frowned Scrap.

&nbsp;

&#8220;What did you do? Did you speak?&#8221;=
 asked
Eddie, in a calm voice.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;

&nbsp;

He tutted, disappointed. Then he acted, compl=
etely
without anger. He grabbed her nipples, and pulled her up to tip-toes. She
breathed faster, little semi-pants, but made no sound. He pushed her roughly, she stumbled to the floor, then immediately s=
tood
up before him. This time, he reached for her pussy, sliding a rough finger =
into
her, before grabbing and twisting her clit. She mewed pathetically, but did=
 not
try to block him, even though both her hands were free. She began to cry ou=
t a
little, the twisting and tugging intensified, and then she screamed. Still =
he
held onto her clit, digging his thumbnail into it. Her scream became a non-=
stop
whine.

&nbsp;

Finally, he let go.

&nbsp;

Then, to make matters worse, Dinah took his p=
lace.
She handed Scrap two pieces of card. One was the sandpaper she had used before, the other was thicker card, sharply studded.

&nbsp;

Dinah&#8217;s instructions were clear and
confident. &#8220;Scrap. Go into the room where we began the evening. Turn =
off
the lights and then stand in the centre of the room. Rub your nipples, cunt=
 and
clit with the sandpaper, holding the other card against another area of your
skin. Do this for five minutes, then rest for ten minutes. Go.&#8221;

&nbsp;

Scrap nodded, and left, not looking back at M=
issy.

&nbsp;

The doctor shrugged, and said to Eddie &#8220=
;They
always feel they have to protect the new slaves, don&#8217;t they? I&#8217;=
ve
had the same problem myself before. I&#8217;ve never found a way around it.
What are you going to give her for that?&#8221;

&nbsp;

&#8220;Two days in her crate without food, I =
think.
Let her think about it.&#8221;

&nbsp;

&#8220;Three this time, I think,&#8221; added=
 Dinah.
&#8220;That was embarrassing, I do apologise.&#8221;

&nbsp;

&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about it,&#8221; sig=
hed
the doctor, as though Dinah had spilled a glass of wine.

&nbsp;

Missy was not grateful when the attention tur=
ned to
her.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Aww, look at her cute little face!&#82=
21;
cooed Dinah. &#8220;Those blue eyes, and all those pegs.&#8221; =


&nbsp;

Dinah reached up to tug on the alligator clam=
ps on
Missy&#8217;s nipples, and Missy struggled. It felt as though any pressure =
or
pulling would tear off the nipple completely. Dinah giggled, and stepped ba=
ck
to let the doctor play with his new toy.

&nbsp;

He unlaced the gag from behind Missy&#8217;s =
head,
and pulled it off. Missy had found a little more defiance, and spat some of=
 the
saliva that had built up, onto his shoes. He ignored it for the moment.

&nbsp;

He went to his cabinet and pulled out a metal=
 device
that looked vaguely dental. 

&nbsp;

&#8220;Open your mouth.&#8221;

&nbsp;

Missy decided not to be disobedient twice in =
a row.
She opened her mouth, and the device was inserted into her. It slipped over=
 her
upper and lower sets of teeth, then pushed them apart, leaving a gaping,
vulnerable gap. Missy frowned and gurgled. The doctor pulled out his half-e=
rect
cock and began to massage it to full hardness. For the first time, she real=
ised
that in her position, bent horizontal at the waist, she was at the right he=
ight
for him.

&nbsp;

He held himself with one hand, and ran his fi=
ngers
across the pegs on her breasts, producing an effect similar to wind on a
cornfield &#8211; pretty patterns circling around the field of pegs. This
seemed to help him become fully hard.

&nbsp;

He placed a hand on the back of her head, and
inserted his cock into her unprotected mouth. Even though her teeth were sp=
read
wide apart, he was big enough such that it was impossible to get inside her
without touching the brace.

&nbsp;

He was not gentle. On the first thrust inside=
 her,
he pushed himself to the back of her mouth, holding it until she gagged. Di=
nah
purred at the sight of Missy&#8217;s stomach muscles contracting in the
discomfort. 

&nbsp;

He pulled out, pleased with the dirty trail of
thick saliva that linked her mouth to his cock, and placed a swimmer&#8217;s
nose-clip on Missy. Then he re-entered her, this time fucking her with long,
sweeping strokes. He withdrew until the head of his cock was level with her
lips, and pushed inside, deeper each time. At first, she tried to push him =
out
with her tongue, but realised that it was more practical to remember to bre=
athe
when she could. When his cock was at the entrance to her throat, she had no=
 air
at all. It was only when he was pulled out that she had little gaps with wh=
ich
to get some oxygen.

&nbsp;

He knew this, they all did, and so he held hi=
mself
at her throat until she bucked dangerously, eyes bulging, cheeks
red. Only then did he withdraw and let her breathe, coughing and spluttering
around him, something he loved.

&nbsp;

He turned to Eddie. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it gre=
at
when their mouth collapses on you like a tight little cunt?&#8221;

&nbsp;

Dinah blushed as Eddie held her hand and agre=
ed.

&nbsp;

Missy&#8217;s brutal face-fucking continued, she felt faint and could no longer determin=
e when
she was able to breathe. She was completely at his mercy, and she knew it. =
For
the moment, her defiance was put to the back of her mind, this was just abo=
ut
survival.

&nbsp;

Something in her stirred,=

an idea. She curled her tongue in her mouth, and ran it along his shaft as =
he
fucked her. 

&nbsp;

&#8220;You won&#8217;t believe this,&#8221; s=
aid
the doctor to his friends, &#8220;she&#8217;s trying to make me cum! Little
slut isn&#8217;t trying to spit on my shoes now, is she? Let&#8217;s see how
rough she likes it.&#8221;

&nbsp;

He slammed his cock into her, and this time i=
t did
enter her throat. She gagged and struggled, but he kept it in place. She we=
nt
dizzy, her tongue lolled, spit dribbled out of her mouth and down her chin,=
 and
just as she was about to faint, he withdrew, and came onto her. A full spurt onto her face, then a second on the inside of her
mouth, not deep enough for her to swallow it. It stayed on her tongu=
e, then sloshed out along with the spit.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Dirty little cum-bucket!&#8221; laughe=
d Dinah.
&#8220;She must feel less than worthless right now.&#8221;

&nbsp;

&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; smiled Eddie, turning to =
face
his wife. &#8220;I bet you&#8217;re already thinking of what to do with our
next sub, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;

&nbsp;

The words were as bad as the slaps. These peo=
ple
were sick, she thought. How long have they done this? And they seem so
blas&eacute; about it too, it was horrifying. Pleading to their better
instincts would be useless; she just had to survive and try to escape when =
she
got the chance.

&nbsp;

The doctor grabbed a handful of Missy&#8217;s=
 hair
and wiped himself on it, then he zipped himself up. Missy moaned pathetical=
ly
as he went to the cabinet again, but this time he did not pull out anything=
 for
her. He pulled out a small blackboard and a piece of chalk. He hung it on a
hook, and wrote down the numbers he had thought of earlier in the kitchen.

&nbsp;

&#8220;I reckon it&#8217;ll be three &#8211; =
eight
&#8211; fifteen,&#8221; he said.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Put me down for one &#8211; four &#821=
1;
ten,&#8221; Eddie added.

&nbsp;

&#8220;I&#8217;ll split the difference. Two &=
#8211;
six &#8211; twelve for me,&#8221; Dinah concluded. The doctor wrote down th=
ese
three sets of numbers. He turned to Missy, brushing the chalk from his hand=
s.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Missy, I&#8217;ll only say this once. =
I will
never lie to you. I only lie to save people from feeling bad, and I don&#82=
17;t
have to do that with you. You spat on my shoes before, which means I will
punish you. I was going to whip you anyway, but now your reaction to the
whipping will determine your punishment. The longer you can hold your tongu=
e,
the longer you make no sound, and don&#8217;t cry, the easier your punishme=
nt
will be. If you start whimpering like a cowardly schoolgirl after the first
stroke, you will regret it. I want a brave slave. Do you understand?&#8221;=


&nbsp;

Missy made no reaction.

&nbsp;

&#8220;I&#8217;ll take that as a yes. You&#82=
17;ll
get the cat o&#8217;nine tails. Eddie, you want to help me pick one out?&#8=
221;

&nbsp;

Dinah shuffled with excitement, rubbing her k=
nees
together at what was coming. The doctor and Eddie walked to the cabinet, and
their conversation as they examined unseen whips in the cabinet, was
half-audible and all-petrifying to Missy.

&nbsp;

&#8220;No, that&#8217;s too easy&#8230; this =
one?... Dinah would remember that, ha ha!...
yeah, that&#8217;s a good one, but it does cut them up quite badly&#8230; t=
hat
one? Yeah! It does lovely red stripes. Perfect.&#8221;

&nbsp;

As he walked back to Missy, the doctor held t=
he
whip in his left hand, and began to whirlwind his right arm to loosen it up.
Eddie and Dinah sat on the cabinet. Dinah sat on Eddie&#8217;s left side,
draped her right leg over his knee, and he slid his left hand under her ski=
rt.

&nbsp;

Missy breathed through her mouth, head now cl=
ear, half-closed her eyes, and wanted to wake up from the
nightmare.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Remember,&#8221; said the doctor. &#8220;Silence.&#8221;

&nbsp;

THWACK!

&nbsp;

Missy stuttered forwards, almost snapping her=
 arms
behind her. Nine thin strands of leather lashed her bottom, and the sharp t=
ips
dug into her flesh. She realised why Scrap had been told to keep this area
free. A moment after the initial hurt, the after-shock hit her and she shook
violently. Several pegs dropped onto the floor.

&nbsp;

THWACK!

&nbsp;

This was worse. It was no harder, but it was =
at a
different angle, and the strands criss-crossed a=
gainst
the red marks that were already on her. She would have bitten her lip if her
mouth wasn&#8217;t clamped open. Instead, she shook her head, sending the l=
ast
remaining droplets of cum and spit to the floor.

&nbsp;

Eddie&#8217;s fingers slid deeper into Dinah&=
#8217;s
pussy as they watched, enthralled.

&nbsp;

THWACK!

&nbsp;

&#8220;MMMMMMMMMMMMM!&#8221; roared Missy as =
the
third blow hit home. She could hold it no longer. At that point, Dinah stoo=
d up
and took the rope from the pulley, untied it, and stood back, holding it. M=
issy
was still on tip-toes, but if Dinah let go of her end of the rope, Missy wo=
uld
fall to the floor. Eddie walked to the blackboard, picked up the chalk, and=
 put
a tick next to the doctor&#8217;s &#8220;three&#8221;.

&nbsp;

Missy whimpered &#8211; she was just a game to
them. She wondered what &#8220;eight&#8221; and &#8220;fifteen&#8221; meant=
. 

&nbsp;

THWACK! THWACK!

&nbsp;

The doctor aimed the next two blows on the ba=
ck of
Missy&#8217;s thighs. Some strands looped and marked her sensitive inner thighs, others whirled round and hit her square on the=
 back
of the hamstring. She felt her legs weaken.

&nbsp;

THWACK!

&nbsp;

After the sixth blow, and for the first time =
since
she entered the room, she began to cry. Long, siren-type moans came out. &#8220;Waaaaaaaaaa!&#8221;

&nbsp;

Eddie smiled and placed a tick next to Dinah&=
#8217;s
&#8220;six&#8221;.

&nbsp;

THWACK!

&nbsp;

Missy became dizzy.

&nbsp;

THWACK!

&nbsp;

Strength sapped from her, she could barely ke=
ep her
arms in position, and her legs would have buckled entirely without the
restraints. If only she could lie down, just for a moment.

&nbsp;

THWACK!

&nbsp;

Her bottom felt like it was on fire. She coul=
d feel
several areas that were throbbing savagely, as though she had been branded.
Other areas were just numb. It was too much to bear. She tried to breathe
through it, though even that was difficult now.

&nbsp;

THWACK!

&nbsp;

She roared one last time, a guttural, primal =
roar. An animal cry. It was the last sound she made that nig=
ht.
Her head bobbed forwards and her neck hung limply. She had fainted. 

&nbsp;

Quickly, Dinah lowered the rope and Missy dro=
pped
to the floor, face first, unconscious. Most of the pegs flipped off her und=
er
the pressure of her body weight. The doctor felt for her pulse, then checked
her upper arms and shoulders for any damage. Upon his short pronouncement t=
hat
she was ok, Eddie sighed and placed a tick next to his &#8220;ten&#8221;.

&nbsp;

&#8220;A tie. Kind of appropriate, don&#8217;=
t you
think?&#8221; he said. Dinah skipped to his side again, and asked the doctor
how long Missy would be out for.

&nbsp;

&#8220;About thirty minutes, I think,&#8221; =
he
said, unscrewing the brace from Missy&#8217;s mouth, removing the nose-clip,
and picking up the gag again.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Enough time to put her to bed?&#8221;

&nbsp;

&#8220;Of course,&#8221; =
grinned
the doctor, inserting the gag into the lifeless mouth of the blonde woman.

&nbsp;




Chapter V

&nbsp;

&#8220;Oh no,&#8221; she said to herself.

&nbsp;

She awoke and realised that it had not been a
dream. In fact, it had probably got worse. The first thing she felt, even
before she opened her eyes, was the armbinder, still on her, just as tight,
just as uncomfortable. Then she opened her eyes, and almost blinded herself=
, it
was so bright. Groaning, she tried to stand up, but banged her head on metal
bars before she got to her knees. Blinking, she gradually accustomed hersel=
f to
her room. She was in a cage, about three feet on each side, maybe an inch or
two more but not much. The base of the cage was flat me=
tal,
the bars were solid painted black metal.

&nbsp;

The surrounding room was concrete, grey, and =
very
close. The entire room was small, claustrophobic, with about three feet of =
room
each side of the cage, with an imposing iron door on one side, and a less
dramatic wooden door on the other, but it was brightly lit. It was easy to =
see
the details of the room &#8211; there were none, except for three cameras
&#8211; a digital camera that clicked at her every so often, and two
closed-circuit TV camera, mounted halfway up opposite walls.

&nbsp;

She wondered how long she had been kept in the
cage, how long she had been out, and guessed it had been many hours. She lo=
oked
down at her bare breasts, and the marks on them had faded a little. She loo=
ked
further down at herself, and realised she was still plugged in both holes,
though it did feel that they were a little smaller. The previous night, the
plugs could have worked loose &#8211; this time they were fastened into her
with a tight leather chastity belt. 

&nbsp;

The strange thing was &#8211; nothing was
happening. There were the bright lights, naked girl trussed-up in a cage, b=
ut
she was alone. 

&nbsp;

Time passed slowly. She struggled against her=
 bonds
for a few minutes, then rested, then struggled again. She frequently wiggle=
d to
try to get more comfortable, never really finding a nice place. She estimat=
ed
that she had been there for an hour, when the iron door opened.

&nbsp;

The doctor entered. In his left hand, he held=
 a
two-foot prod, at which Missy widened her eyes. She correctly guessed, but
could not be sure, that it was a cattle-prod. He leaned the prod against a
wall. In his other hand, he was holding a pot of black paint, and began to
write on the walls.

&nbsp;

With a neat hand, he wrote: &#8220;You will o=
nly
eat if you are clean and well-groomed.&#8221;

&nbsp;

Missy watched, unimpressed. She was determine=
d to
make a stand, she had to say what she had been
thinking ever since her capture.

&nbsp;

&#8220;I&#8217;ll never love you,&#8221; she =
cried.

&nbsp;

He surprised her by responding to her directl=
y. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t want you to love me, honey. If I wanted that, I&#8217;d buy you
diamonds and pearls and make you a proper little whore.&#8221;

&nbsp;

&#8220;What do you want?&#8221;

&nbsp;

&#8220;I want what you do not.&#8221;

&nbsp;

Missy mused this for a while. &#8220;I do not=
 want
to be set free.&#8221;

&nbsp;

&#8220;Nice try,&#8221; he said, and placed t=
he
cattle-prod against the bars of the cage. He paused for a second, watching =
for
Missy&#8217;s reaction. She stared at him defiantly. Then he turned it on, =
and high-voltage
surged through the bars. Missy roared, and did an electric jig of pain. Her
blood felt like it was boiling inside her, her skin itched like it was on fire, her eyes began to shudder in their sockets. 

&nbsp;

&#8220;NoooOoooAAAA!&#8221;

&nbsp;

He stopped the prod.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Now,&#8221; he said, as she panted for
breath. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want you to promise me anything. I don&#8217;t
want you to tell me you&#8217;re going to be a good little girl, or a wife,=
 or
a cunt or a slave or a whore. I just want you to understand that nothing you
say will help you. You are mine now.&#8221;=


&nbsp;

He turned on the prod again, and electric cur=
rent
raced through the bars of the cage again. Then, for a brief second, she tho=
ught
her torment was over, but unfortunately he was only moving around. He found=
 an
unprotected spot on the side of her waist, and placed the prod directly aga=
inst
it.

&nbsp;

&#8220;AAAAAAAAAAA!&#8221;

&nbsp;

As bad as the electrified bars felt, the feel=
ing of
the prod against her flesh was even worse &#8211; it was as though all the =
pain
was concentrated on one spot.

&nbsp;

&#8220;You might ask if I am going to keep yo=
u in
this cage forever. Not quite. But you will spend a lot of time in here, so I
want you to get used to it. Now, do you understand why I&#8217;ve written t=
hat
on the wall?&#8221;

&nbsp;

&#8220;Y-yes,&#8221; she whimpered.

&nbsp;

&#8220;You do not understand at all, I&#8217;=
ve not
told explained anything. You should not lie to m=
e,
Missy.&#8221; 

&nbsp;

He turned the prod on the bars again, but thi=
s time
left it on a slightly lower setting. Missy wailed nonetheless, because the =
prod
was not stopped &#8211; it stayed firmly wedged against the bars for several
minutes. She shook, her head shivered, and she tried to jump from her knees.
She begged him to stop, she screamed at him and apologised and promised him
everything. She would have told him anything, just to get him to stop.=


&nbsp;

Only when she said &#8220;P-p-please explain =
what
the words m-mean&#8221; did he stop. This was what he wanted to hear. A
&#8220;sir&#8221; would have been nice, but it was not essential.

&nbsp;

He opened the cage, and removed her plugs and
bonds. She was still panting, but had recovered quickly. She looked at him
suspiciously, but did not try to fight him. He cleared his throat, and spok=
e.
&#8220;Through the wooden door is a bathroom, containing a shower with a ra=
nge
of shampoos that I took from your house earlier today. There are cameras
covering all areas of the bathroom, and no windows. You will go in there and
clean yourself up each morning. If you do not meet my standards, you will go
back into the cage and we will wait until tomorrow before you are fed.&#822=
1;

&nbsp;

The words were delivered calmly, and Missy no=
dded
when she heard the last one. She had a terrible hunger after all her exerti=
ons,
it was at least 24 hours since she last ate or drank anything. Today she wo=
uld
do as he asked, then after she had eaten, she wo=
uld
have a bit more strength to know what to do.

&nbsp;

She wandered into the shower and looked at the
safety razor. There was a temptation to slash her wrists, and she actually
giggled to herself morbidly when she realised she would be punished for it.=
 

=
&nbsp;

To her surprise, the shower had hot water, an=
d it
was refreshing to feel alone and clean, until she looked up and saw a camer=
a swivel
in her direction, which depressed her again. It happened just as she was
feeling her breasts, checking to see how swollen they were.

&nbsp;

Hunger was a great motivator, and when she ca=
me out
of the shower, she was relieved to see him smile. She hated him, but if she
didn&#8217;t want to starve, she would have to do one of the things she was
best at: look beautiful.

&nbsp;

When she emerged from the shower, there was a=
 large
bowl of porridge on the floor. It looked mouth-watering, but she knew there
would be a catch. 

&nbsp;

&#8220;Arms.&#8221;

&nbsp;

Missy put her arms behind her back, and the b=
inder
went back on. Now she had no choice, she would have to wait to try to escap=
e.
He slipped two fingers into her pussy, then two into her ass, apparently
testing for internal bruising. &#8216;Fortunately&#8217;, he appeared
satisfied, and re-inserted the double plugs. Missy could see, before they w=
ent
back in, that the dildo was about four inches, and the plug was three. This=
 was
mixed news, because they were small enough to be kept in for long periods.

&nbsp;

He nudged the bowl with his foot. &#8220;This
contains special nutrients, which you have already been taking in those pil=
ls I
prescribed for you. Have your breasts felt fuller recently?&#8221;

&nbsp;

&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, sceptically.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Good. Stick out your chest.&#8221;

&nbsp;

Missy did so. For a moment, this was just a n=
ormal
examination by her doctor. The doctor gave each breast a gentle squeeze. Mi=
ssy
winced, not because his touch was harsh, but because they were so sensitive=
.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Yes, another few days, I think. Then
you&#8217;ll see.&#8221;

&nbsp;

&#8220;See what?&#8221;

&nbsp;

She was ignored. The doctor went into the bat=
hroom
to check that everything had been tidied away correctly. This angered Missy,
who hated to be ignored.

&nbsp;

&#8220;See what?&#8221; she repeated with a s=
narl.
&#8220;I&#8217;m not eating a fucking mouthful of this, or&#8230;&#8221;

&nbsp;

&#8220;Or what?&#8221; asked the doctor
quizzically. &#8220;What else will you eat?&#8221;

&nbsp;

&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; she sniffed like a pet=
ulant
teenager.

&nbsp;

He felt that he wasn&#8217;t getting through =
to
her. He took her bowl, and emptied it onto the concrete floor. Then he slip=
ped
his fingers inside the back of her collar, and forcibly dragged her to the
floor, holding her mouth over a chunk of the food. Missy closed her eyes and
stuck out her tongue, lapping up the porridge.

&nbsp;

&#8220;You will eat whatever I want you to ea=
t.
Understand?&#8221;

&nbsp;

&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she mewed.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Yes, what? The word you&#8217;re looking f=
or is
&#8216;sir&#8217;.&#8221;

&nbsp;

&#8220;Yes&#8230; sir,&#8221; she said between
gritted teeth.

&nbsp;

She did not realise that this would be the
highlight of her day.

&nbsp;

The doctor had given her a lot of excitement =
in her
first night, he wanted to calm her down, so a ro=
utine
began. He would wake up at seven in the morning, put on a robe and walk dow=
n to
her cage. There, he would open her cage, take off her restraints and plugs,=
 and
tell her to wash. While she showered, he prepared her porridge. Once out of=
 the
shower, he would tell put her restraints back on, except for her gag.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Kneel,&#8221; he would say.=


&nbsp;

She knelt.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Open your mouth.&#8221;

&nbsp;

She opened her mouth, eyes filled with hatred=
.

&nbsp;

&#8220;If I feel any teeth on my cock, you
won&#8217;t eat for two days.&#8221;

&nbsp;

She took this threat seriously, and the diet =
she
was on was not enough for her, so opened her mouth even wider. He then bega=
n to
fuck her, smiling at her and holding the back of her head, holding her mouth
around the base of his large, plump cock. 

&nbsp;

&#8220;Don&#8217;t you dare struggle, cunt,&#=
8221;
he warned as she began to gag. Then he would withdraw, and ejaculate over h=
er
face. She would whimper and begin to cry now, and then be forced to eat her
porridge with her spit, her bile, and his cum dripping into it. After the l=
ast
mouthful, her pink ballgag would be replaced, she would be returned to the =
cage
with a whimper, and he would leave for work.

&nbsp;

This was her morning. 

&nbsp;

She would then be alone with her bondage, in =
the
small cage, until he would come home that night. That would be bad enough, =
if
it was not for the bright lights and the cameras, and the electric cord that
ran from the base of the cage, out under the iron door. That was what she h=
ated
most of all.

&nbsp;

Throughout the day, between patients, the doc=
tor would
flick on his internet, go to a personal website, and check up on her. There=
 she
was, lying still, hunched over, trying to shift her weight so to ease all t=
he
strains in her muscles. With a few taps on his keyboard, the camera would w=
hirr
and zoom in on her face, focusing in so closely that he could see the drool
seep out of the side onto the base of the cage.

&nbsp;

At this point, he would make a keystroke and =
she
would begin to shudder in her cage as the electricity hit her. Then, after =
five
seconds of this intense torture, it would stop, and begin to bawl into the =
gag,
struggling with the frustration she was feeling, the helplessness. 

&nbsp;

Sometimes she would notice the camera and vis=
ibly
brace herself. When this happened, he would wait for her body to relax... a=
nd
then press the keystroke, or sometimes not press it at all, leaving her to
whimper, expecting and visualising pain that wasn&#8217;t coming. &nbsp;She was used to having attention pa=
id to
her. As she lay in her cell, she knew that she was only getting attention f=
or
ten seconds an hour, and all of the attention was unwelcome.

&nbsp;

When he got home, he would change, eat, and p=
repare
her meal, and then take her from her cage. If she had made any mess, or her
crying had made her unattractive and puffy, he would permit her a quick sho=
wer
to clean herself up. The gag would be removed, and she would hungrily eat f=
rom the
large bowl of porridge. It was not a starvation diet, but it was not pleasa=
nt,
particularly as she had so long to think what the &#8216;nutrients&#8217; c=
ould
be.

&nbsp;

Depending on his mood, he would then take eit=
her
put her back in the cage, or more likely slip a leash on her collar, and le=
ad
her to the room with the sofas. Here he would restrain her in a way where he
could fuck her mouth, cunt or ass, depending on what he wanted to do that
evening. The blow-jobs were the worst &#8211; his cock was too big to hold =
in
her mouth, and he forced himself to the back of her throat, holding her hea=
d in
place with both hands until her face went red. When he withdrew his cock, it
would be coated in spit and bile, which he would wipe over her face and hai=
r,
making her feel degraded and weak.

&nbsp;

Whichever hole he =
chose, the
other two holes would be firmly plugged. She never showed any sign of enjoy=
ing
any of this, nor did he want her to pretend. She just lay there and accepted
it, because she had no choice. But she knew she would fight back when she
could, and occasionally swore angrily at him, or spat at him, in the brief
moments when she was gagless.

&nbsp;

Twice he chose to torture her, both times he =
put on
a glove that had pinpricks on the palm and fingers, and would squeeze parts=
 of
her, including brief but appalling spankings. He left her breasts untouched
each time, but she never realised the significance of this. 

&nbsp;

After he had had his fun, he returned her to =
her
cage, all three holes filled, arms behind her ba=
ck.
The one comfort was that he would be asleep, so would not be able to shock =
her,
but the lights, the plugs, the gag, and the bondage made it impossible to s=
leep
well.

&nbsp;

This was her routine.

&nbsp;

Except, after the fifth day of this routine, =
when
he led her from the cage after she had eaten, he took her to a different ro=
om.




Chapter VI

&nbsp;

On this day, Missy was taken out of the cage =
as
normal. She was so relieved to be out of her cage after ten hours that had
dragged worse than ever. After about three hours, she had an annoying cramp
around the elbow that refused to go away &#8211; each time she got settled,=
 the
electric shock would hit her and she would be reminded of the pains and ach=
es
she was suffering.

&nbsp;

She knew she looked dishevelled, but was not =
asked
to shower, which should have been another clue that something was going to
happen. She was told to eat as usual, but without her armbinder on. Then she
was led out on all fours, plugless and gagless, crawling after him, being
pulled on a leash. She actually turned into the usual sofa room before
realising he was heading one room further down. This room completed the
concrete wing of his house &#8211; like the other two rooms, it was brick a=
nd
stone on all sides, and bereft of any normal furniture. This room had two
eye-catching features. The first was a pillory, about three feet off the
ground, made of wood, with smooth holes for the head and wrists. It was
lockable, but otherwise appeared to be unimpressive. The other item was sit=
ting
in the corner of the room, and was covered by a dust-blanket. It looked bul=
ky,
about two feet high, two feet wide, and four feet long.

&nbsp;

He opened the pillory, and she feared a brutal
whipping like the first night, so struggled this time.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Get the fuck off of me,
I won&#8217;t obey you, y&#8217;cunt.&#8221;

&nbsp;

He grabbed her leash three inches from her ne=
ck,
and swung her round. She skipped over, scuffing her knees on the floor, whi=
ning
and choking as he tugged up on the leash again, dragging her to her feet. S=
till
she struggled, aiming a kick at him which hit him on the inside of the thig=
h, a
foot from his balls. He put his foot down on her toes, and she yelled with
pain, and he slapped her face, which made her reel and rock. She knew the
moment was over, but spat at him anyway.

&nbsp;

He spun her round again, and again, letting h=
er
fall, get up and whine, until he finally wore he=
r out.
He got her in the pillory, and locked it shut.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Good effort, Missy,&#8221; he said, bu=
t he
had been a little scared there. He was certainly angry. He left her to wash=
 his
face, and returned with the cattle-prod. &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t planning on
hurting you at all tonight, but as they say, to the winner, the spoils.&#82=
21;

&nbsp;

He placed the prod on the back of her right l=
eg,
and turned it on. Missy almost collapsed, she would have fallen to the floor
had it not been for the sturdy pillory. He moved the prod to her other leg,=
 and
she kicked out wildly like an electrocuted frog in a science exhibit. =


&nbsp;

&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;m sorry,&#822=
1; she
whined. &#8220;Sir, I beg you, I do.&#8221;

&nbsp;

He kept up his promise of never lying to her.
&#8220;You angered me tonight, Missy. I need to get my revenge. I wonder wh=
at
the prod will feel like on your cunt.&#8221;

&nbsp;

&#8220;Nooooooooooo!&#8221; she called. Someh=
ow,
like when the camera whirred in her direction, knowing something awful was
going to happen was worse than it happening unexpectedly. He placed the met=
al
prong at her dry, clean cuntlips, and turned it on. A charge went through t=
he two
tips, and Missy thought her pussy had been pierced and branded at the same
time. She concentrated hard to keep her mouth screaming so she wouldn&#8217=
;t
clamp her teeth down and bite her lip or tongue. It only lasted two seconds=
 at
most, but she would never forget that moment.

&nbsp;

He placed the prod on the wall in front of he=
r, as
if to remind her not to anger him, and then he left to fetch the largest pl=
ugs
he could find for her. She barely noticed the one in her pussy,
it was numb with the aftershocks of the pain. She was not gagged, which
surprised her.

&nbsp;

He reached for her breasts, squeezing them as=
 he
did each day. They had felt more and more swollen, which she thought was the
after-effects of the first night&#8217;s beating, though wondered why they
would still be so after nearly a week. He did appear to be particularly
fascinated with them this time, and she frowned, realising how vulnerable t=
hey
were in this position, hanging down the way they did. Then he placed his fi=
rst
and second fingers either side of her left nipple, and
squeezed a stream of white liquid into his other hand.

&nbsp;

&#8220;What is that?&#8221; Missy screamed.

&nbsp;

The doctor sniffed the liquid, tasted it, and=
 then
held it to her mouth. 

&nbsp;

&#8220;Taste it.&#8221;

&nbsp;

Missy turned her head as much as she could, b=
ut
then realised that it would only cause her more pain. She&#8217;d guessed w=
hat
it was, so stuck out her tongue. It was milk, a little sweet, but definitely
drinkable milk.

&nbsp;

&#8220;A-am I pregnant?&#8221;

&nbsp;

&#8220;No, no,&#8221; laughed the doctor.
&#8220;You can produce milk because of all the nutrients in your food.
They&#8217;ll cause no other effects, cunt, and remember that I never lie to
you. If you stop eating your food now, I will be very angry.&#8221;

&nbsp;

He turned without waiting for her reply, and =
pulled
the blanket off the lump in front of her. Her eyes glanced over it &#8211; =
two
large suction cups facing vertically, two sets of bellows underneath, and a
quaint metal pail at the bottom, into which a tube drained.

&nbsp;

&#8220;You&#8217;re not going to &#8211; you
can&#8217;t! You won&#8217;t, I won&#8217;t let you.&#8221;

&nbsp;

The doctor looked at his watch. &#8220;For on=
ce I
agree. I have a prior engagement anyway. But you&#8217;re a bitch full of m=
ilk,
and bitches like to be milked. If they could speak, they would beg to be
milked. Particularly, as will be the case with you, if =
you
are not milked for two more days. Imagine how your udders will feel
after that? Anything stronger than a light brush, and
you&#8217;ll be in agony.&#8221;

&nbsp;

This thought must have aroused the doctor, be=
cause
he walked around to her unprotected mouth, and gave her a vigorous
face-fucking, much more severe than normal because he did not have to hold =
the
back of her head &#8211; there was already the firm pillory holding her in
place. His hands were free to take off his belt. She could see him doing th=
is,
and began to sob. The man was relentless, she knew now that he had no reaso=
n to
choose her. If it hadn&#8217;t been her, it would be some other poor woman =
in
her place.

&nbsp;

This time, she gagged so hard on him that she
thought she was going to vomit, it took a lot of
effort to hold it back. When he pulled out, she spat onto the floor, tears
dripping. She was removed from the pillory, and led back to her cage.

&nbsp;

The doctor was right. After one more day, Mis=
sy
found it hard to wash, the hot water was sensiti=
ve on
her breasts. The second day was even worse. When she leaned forwards to eat=
 her
breakfast, her breasts brushed against the floor and she recoiled. The doct=
or
noticed this, and smiled.

&nbsp;

That evening, he told her to make herself
particularly pretty, sending her back into the shower because she hadn&#821=
7;t
shaved properly. When she dropped on all fours as usual, he wrapped a small,
poignant cowbell around her neck.

&nbsp;

As she crawled to the pillory-room, the bell
tinkled and echoed down the corridor, sounding more and more ominous with e=
ach
step. The cattle-prod was still in the room, so she decided it was wise to
obey. Besides, she DID want to be milked, if it would ease the uncomfortable
swelling in her breasts.

&nbsp;

She looked anxiously as she stood, breasts ha=
nging,
but he did not take the sheet off the machine. He approached her with a sma=
ll
metal instrument, and almost began to cry even before it touched her. It wa=
s a
pinwheel, simply a firm spiky wheel at the end of a handle. He placed it on=
 the
top of her chest.

&nbsp;

&#8220;P-p-ple-please...&#8221; she begged.

&nbsp;

He moved the pinwheel, which rotated over her
swollen, tender breasts. It was as unbearable as anything she had suffered,=
 and
she wondered how many more ways he could torture her. In fact, he was just
waiting for her to take the lead.

&nbsp;

&#8220;P-please, m-milk me.&#822=
1;

&nbsp;

The pinwheel slowed, but continued. This was =
the
doctor&#8217;s way of acknowledging that she was on the right track.

&nbsp;

&#8220;S-sir, please milk me, sir.&#8221;

&nbsp;

The pinwheel slowed further, as though to ind=
icate
that Missy had said the right thing, but also to indicate that this did not
mean that he would stop. He criss-crossed all around her, never going near =
the
nipple, but occasionally pushing in hard with the wheel, and twisting.
Missy&#8217;s head lolled, and she begged again =
and
again for him to be milked.

&nbsp;

He placed the pinwheel on the floor by the
cattle-prod, and tugged the sheet off the machine. He eased it under her
breasts, and the two large cups were squarely under her. With surprising ca=
re,
the doctor raised the cups until they were around her breasts, then quickly turned it on.

&nbsp;

It felt like two plungers had been simultaneo=
usly
placed on her, and were sucking hard, as though they were trying to rip the
breasts from her body. But the undeniable truth was that it was sucking mil=
k,
and the painful swelling began to go down. She was used to pain now, it was
horrible, but she was swapping one pain for another.

&nbsp;

The doctor loved a good milking, and could re=
sist
her no longer. He ripped out both of her plugs, and slid his cock into her
pussy. The days of being plugged with a four inch dildo did not prepare her=
 for
his monster, and she found herself being rammed forwards, almost jolting her
breasts apart from the harsh suction.

&nbsp;

He came in her pussy, withdrew, wiped himself=
 on
the back of her leg, and leaned forwards to switch off the machine. He held=
 up
the pail of milk &#8211; there was about half a pint in there, which he too=
k to
the refrigerator. He returned holding a riding crop, idly THWACKED her with=
 it
on the way past, then picked up the cattle prod.=
 She
tried to back peddle, then turn her entire body =
to the
left as he passed her on the right. But he did not use the prod, nor the crop.

&nbsp;

&#8220;From this moment on, you do not speak.=
 If
you speak, I will hit you with the cattle prod. You are a dog, a dog that n=
eeds
to be trained. Do you understand?&#8221;

&nbsp;

She almost said &#8220;Yes sir,&#8221; but st=
opped
herself, and nodded. She hoped this was acceptable: it was. He smiled, patt=
ed
her head, and unhooked the machine from her.

&nbsp;

He led her by the leash outside. It was near =
the
end of a hot, sunny day, and Missy winced &#8211; it was the first time she=
 had
SEEN outside &#8211; let alone BEEN outside &#8211; for well over a week. He
stopped about two yards on the grass, which spread half a mile in each
direction.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Sit,&#8221; he said. Missy gracefully =
bent
down and sat. The doctor moved towards her, and whacked her twice with the
riding crop. &#8220;Not fast enough. Stand.&#8221;

&nbsp;

She scrambled to her feet. He hit her again.
&#8220;Not fast enough. Kneel.&#8221;

&nbsp;

She leapt forwards to her knees. &#8220;Not f=
ast
enough.&#8221;

&nbsp;

After this one, he approached her, on all fou=
rs,
pulled out the large plugs in her ass and pussy, and replaced them with two
small, metal balls. He was being fair &#8211; it would be difficult for her=
 to
sit quickly with two huge plugs &#8211; she could cause herself internal
injuries, which was not his aim. But there was another advantage to the bal=
ls.
He pulled out a similar remote control to the one that had been linked up to
Scrap.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Stand,&#8221; Missy bounced up quickly=
, but
stumbled. &#8220;Not fast enough.&#8221; 

&nbsp;

He pressed the buzzer, and Missy squirmed
&#8220;Errgg-ahhh&#8221;.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Supine.&#8221; Missy rolled to her bac=
k.
&#8220;Not fast enough.&#8221;

&nbsp;

&#8220;Yaaw,&#8221; Missy mewed.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Stay.&#8221; Missy had started to get =
up on
the &#8220;st&#8230;&#8221; of &#8220;Stay&#8221;, thinking it was going to=
 be
&#8220;stand&#8221;. For this, she got called a dumb fucking dog and got a
double-dose of pain.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Stand. Not fast enough. [Buzz] Stay. G=
ood.
Sit. Not fast enough. [Buzz] Stand. Not fast enough. [Buzz] Supine.&#8221;

&nbsp;

Exasperated, she violently threw herself to t=
he
floor. To her astonishment, he did not say &#8220;Not fast enough.&#8221;
Rather, he approached her and rubbed her shaggy hair. &#8220;Good girl,&#82=
21;
he said with a smile. &#8220;That was fast enough.&#8221;=


&nbsp;

She blinked at him, she hadn&#8217;t expected=
 this,
and then she remembered &#8211; he never lied to her, and he wasn&#8217;t l=
ying
this time. He stepped back, and said &#8220;Lie face down.&#8221; She turned
over. &#8220;Not fast enough.&#8221;

&nbsp;

She whimpered again as the buzz began in her =
pussy.
As she lay face down, she heard a different noise, a mobile phone going off=
. He
pulled out a phone from his pocket, flicked it open, and took the call.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Dinah!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Thanks f=
or
calling. Listen, about next week, I can&#8217;t make it...&#8221;

&nbsp;

He continued, and Missy permitted herself a q=
uick
look up at him. He was not paying her any attention at all; in fact he turn=
ed
away from her to concentrate on the phone. She got to her feet and began to=
 pad
silently away from him, then quickened her pace, then began to sprint. She =
was
naked, she still had the balls inside her, but she knew that this would not
stop her, even if she was still in range. She heard him call out to her
&#8220;Hoi! Come back, Cunt&#8221; but she didn&#8217;t respond. She was
heading for the nearest exit, which appeared to be about a quarter of a mile
away, through the forest.

&nbsp;

Her legs tired quickly, she was out of shape =
after
her week in the cage with no exercise, but she forced herself to keep runni=
ng.
She slowed to catch her breath, taking the opportunity to delve a hand into=
 her
pussy and wrench out one of the balls, and a single finger in her ass got o=
ut
the other ball. She tugged at her collar, wanting to be rid of that too, bu=
t it
was locked on. She would remove it later, when she was free. She just wante=
d to
see someone, to call for help. She would take her chances with the grimiest=
 truck
driver, she would be so happy to see him that she would do anything to him,=
 if
only he set her free. But first, first she had to get through the forest an=
d...

&nbsp;

And she hit a fifteen-foot wall, sheer with no
footholds. She looked around for trees that she could climb to get over it,=
 but
there were none, and the razor-wire across the top was equally imposing. She
began to scamper along the length of the wall, looking for a weak spot. Nothing. Frustrated now, tears forming in her eyes, she
tried to jump at the wall, throwing her shoulder at it. 

&nbsp;

Another idea came to her. If she could hide o=
ut
until night-time, she might be able to sneak out through the front gate.
Anything was better than returning. She was not going to give up. She found=
 a
hiding place, a heavy rock with a large bush beside it, and sat there, thin=
king
and dreaming.

&nbsp;

The doctor smiled. The transmitter in her col=
lar
was working perfectly, just as it had when he had tested it that morning. He
was looking at the flashing dot on his PDA as he changed into a heavy black
outfit. He had thought of recapturing her sneakily, but that would not be
right. He had to convince her that he did not care for her, and he could do=
 as
he wished.

&nbsp;

He jogged to the forest, about fifty yards fr=
om
her, and then began to walk quickly in her direction. He put on a helmet
&#8211; worried she might brain him with a stone &#8211; but was otherwise
normally dressed, and certainly alone. He had spent many happy afternoons
hunting Scrap at Dinah and Eddie&#8217;s house, but this was more of a
challenge, there was more at stake. 

&nbsp;

He set up a tripwire close to her, shuffled a=
round
to the other side, and noisily approached her. She looked up, knew that he
would be able to see her, and fled. When she reached the tripwire, he was
twenty feet away. She stumbled over it, yelling and cursing, before scrambl=
ing
to her feet. He was now six feet away, and closing. She felt a hand waft ac=
ross
the back of her hair as she ran, once, twice. The third time, it caught her.
The hand grabbed her hair and pulled her back and down to the floor. She ye=
lped
and swore at him, not caring about any instruction, before melting into a m=
ess
of frustration.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Why... why are you doing this to me?&#=
8221;
she cried.

&nbsp;

He ignored her, but felt that his point had b=
een
made. He put a leash on her, and dragged her back to the house. He took off=
 the
leash at the point where she had been training a moment earlier, and left h=
er
there, sobbing on all fours.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Supine,&#8221; he said calmly.

&nbsp;

Slowly, completely dispirited, Missy rolled o=
ver
onto her back, still crying, covering her eyes with her hands. He approached
her with the cattle prod. &#8220;Not fast enough,&#8221; he said without
malice, and jabbed it into her belly-button.

&nbsp;




Chapter VII

&nbsp;

The evening after her escape, she expected to=
 be
taken back to the cage for bed. He had a different idea in mind for her.

&nbsp;

&#8220;I think today&#8217;s escape was just
because you had a little too much energy, don&#8217;t you? I think we can
control that.&#8221;

&nbsp;

He placed the armbinder on her, and also put =
on a
pair of blinkers. She was plugged and gagged as usual, though worried at the
metallic plugs that were used. Then came a surpr=
ise
&#8211; a bra, an actual bra, black leather, full-cupped, supportive. She h=
ad
not been given any other clothing at all in her time with the doctor, so th=
is
was viewed with suspicion. It did not take long to find out, as he put it o=
nto
her. 

&nbsp;

&#8220;Owww,&#8221; she whined. She remembere=
d not
to talk. Pinpricks on the inside of the bra pointed at her, pinching into h=
er
flesh. Fortunately, he did not tug the bra tight onto h=
er,
there was a fair bit of freedom, though it certainly would not come off.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Good,&#8221; he said. He took her arou=
nd the
outside of house, into a small field which had firm hedges on each side. Ea=
ch
side of the field was only about twenty-five yards long. &#8220;Do you see
those boxes in the corners? You see the lights on top of them?&#8221;

&nbsp;

Missy nodded, though she had to turn her head=
 fully
because of the blinkers. She was not tempted to run: her arms were restrain=
ed
and he was holding the riding crop in one hand, and the cattle-prod in the
other. The boxes, which were encased in wire mesh, were about a foot high, =
and
each had a single light bulb at the top. None of the bulbs was lit.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Good,&#8221; he said again. &#8220;Sta=
y here
until the first light comes on. Then you can go and turn it off.&#8221;

&nbsp;

He did not say another word.

&nbsp;

Missy looked at him as he left, watching him =
take
up a position outside the field, where he could see her clearly, despite the
darkening sky. Quickly, she became aware of a pain in her pussy, a growing,
increasing pain. She looked around. Behind her, a light was on. She walked
towards it, and the pain increased further, making it difficult to walk.
Wrongly guessing that the nearer she got to it, the worse the pain, she wal=
ked
away, but the pain got worse anyway. There was no choice. She hobbled as be=
st
she could, wincing as the shock in her pussy grew and grew until it was alm=
ost
as bad as the cattle-prod, and reached the bulb. There was a large rubber m=
at
on the floor. She put one foot on it, and nothing happened. She put a second
foot on it, and the pain stopped immediately.

&nbsp;

She turned to see his reaction, but was distr=
acted
by another light switching on to his left. This time, she did not wait. She
sprinted towards the bulb, and had to slow herself. The bra! Each time she
bounded a step forwards, her large breasts bounced upwards, and then down o=
nto
the sharp inside. That cunt of a doctor knew that by tying the bra on loose=
ly,
it would cause her much more pain than a snug one. She had no choice, the plug in her ass was throbbing now, becoming
stronger and stronger. She had to get to the light, she quickened her pace,
tears of frustration forming in her eyes, wondering whether she would stumb=
le,
or twist her ankle, or die with the pain, wondering how anyone could live l=
ike
this. She looked to one side, and saw that the doctor had turned and was
walking back to the house, apparently happy that his scheme was working
correctly. She landed on the mat, and let out a primal roar of relief as the
electricity stopped inside her.

&nbsp;

And a moment later, a light in the opposite c=
orner
of the field came on.

&nbsp;

By the time morning had come, Missy was cover=
ed in
grass-stains. The field was fairly flat, but running in the middle of the n=
ight
with only a single distant light-bulb was difficult. The prongs inside her =
were
merciless. She noticed that every fifteen minutes or so, there were no ligh=
ts
for a few moments, just to give her a chance to catch her breath, and then
inevitably another would pop on. She got slightly used to the pain, and fou=
nd
that a gentle jog would be enough, but sometimes she would lose concentrati=
on,
realise how much she was being hurt, and have to sprint to stop it. And that
would cause the breasts to be spiked harder than ever, pain upon pain.=


&nbsp;

The sight of the doctor slowly approaching ga=
ve her
a little relief, but then he turned to make a phone call, and went back into
the house. Missy swore and swore again at him. When he finally arrived, all=
 he
did was walk around the four boxes, unlock a panel on the back, and flick t=
hem
off. It took him three minutes. Three minutes to end a futile task she had =
been
doing for eight hours. She shook her head, dropped to her knees, rolled onto
her back, and wanted to fall asleep and never wake up.

&nbsp;

He put a leash on her collar, undid her armbi=
nder,
and dragged her to all fours. &#8220;Crawl.&#8221;

&nbsp;

Slowly she placed one sore knee in front of
another, and followed him, crawling all the way to her cage room, heavy bre=
asts
already refilling with milk, swatting against the brutal leather.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Strip. Shower. You have an extra ten
minutes.&#8221;

&nbsp;

She took every second of those ten minutes, t=
rying
desperately to rub the aches and pains from every part of her body, but the=
re
were just too many. After breakfast, and when she was returned to the cage =
for
the day, she tried in vain to sleep. Unfortunately, the camera would whirr,=
 and
the shock would begin.

&nbsp;

This became her new routine. She lost count o=
f the
number of days, it must have been ten, but each day would follow the same
procedure. Only the hour or so when he played with her, after her milking a=
nd
before the running,.. only
that provided her with a break from the monotony.

&nbsp;

She found herself struggling less. When she b=
egan,
she was constantly fighting back. But the crop, the prod, the cage and the
pinwheels were convincing her. She still fought back, but it changed from o=
ne
time in three, to one in six, to one in twelve. Any time she was unrestrain=
ed
&#8211; usually moving from one bondage to another &#8211; that was when she
would fight, and she would fight hard, and she would fail, and she would be
told that she would not be milked for three days, and at the end of those d=
ays,
she would promise him that she would do anything if only he would milk her.=


&nbsp;

And then, after one such milking, he stepped =
in
front of her, and said quietly. &#8220;I am going to take you to a bar toni=
ght.
You will not try to escape, or you will go six days without milking, do you
understand?&#8221;

&nbsp;

She paused, and nodded, before being led to t=
he
shower with instructions to make herself particularly pretty. The two metal
plugs were inserted into her, and then she was given a dress and shoes &#82=
11;
HER dress and her shoes, that had clearly been taken from her house.

&nbsp;

The dress barely fit over her breasts, but it=
 was
painless, short, and sexy. For the first time in a month, she felt like a
woman. The shoes were uncomfortable, she had spent so long barefoot, heels were difficult to manage. She did not complain,
however.

&nbsp;

She still wore her collar, and he put her in =
the
back of his van, linking her to the roof of the van by a foot-long chain, so
she rocked back and forth as he sped around the corners, on the way to
Eddie&#8217;s bar. Eddie had been forewarned, of course, and there were sev=
eral
knowing regulars in there, but some random public people were also drinking
innocently in the bar.

&nbsp;

The doctor dragged Missy from the van in the =
car
park. &#8220;Now, listen up, cunt.&#8221; You are going to go in there, and=
 you
are going to suck off as many guys as you can. It doesn&#8217;t matter if t=
hey
are with their girlfriends, you are going to ask=
 them
three times each. Only if they say no are you to move on. Understand?&#8221=
;

&nbsp;

Missy nodded.

&nbsp;

&#8220;You can talk, cunt.&#8221;

&nbsp;

&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; she said. Aside from =
when
she was defiant, they were the first words that she had spoken since she had
been milked for the first time.

&nbsp;

&#8220;You may remember Eddie behind the bar,=
 he
will be watching you. I&#8217;ll have my eye on you too on the closed-circu=
it
cameras. I warn you that you should not try to escape.&#8221;

&nbsp;

&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; Missy sighed.

&nbsp;

He led her to the door, and pushed her inside=
. Instantly,
she was repulsed. As average-looking as the doctor was, he was an Adonis
compared to some of the men in the bar. She stood still for a second, before
feeling a reminder in her ass, as the plug was turned on. 

&nbsp;

&#8220;Okay, okay,&#8221; she said to herself=
.

&nbsp;

She walked up to a fifty year old bald man,
standing at the bar alone.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Sir,&#8221; she said with a smile.
&#8220;Can I suck you off, please?&#8221;

&nbsp;

He looked around the bar, not being one of th=
ose on
the &#8216;inside&#8217;, he wondered who the lovely girl was. Eddie hovered
just within earshot, polishing a glass. &#8220;Go on, Ted, you have yoursel=
f a
bit of fun,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re all adults here, aren&#8217;t
we?&#8221;

&nbsp;

Ted frowned at Missy, and she took a moment to
realise that there was someone who was concerned for her. She had to gulp t=
hree
times to avoid crying, and confessing that she was being held against her w=
ill.
&#8220;Sir, I really want to suck you, I need a cock in my throat right
now.&#8221;

&nbsp;

Ted shrugged, the woman was buzzing with appa=
rent
arousal, her hands placed on her pussy, rubbing it through her dress. He co=
uld
not see that it was burning inside her, and the only thing that would stop =
it
was him. He faced the bar, unzipped himself as she knelt in front of him, a=
nd
took out his cock. He was not as well endowed as the doctor, but it was sti=
ll
big enough to go to the back of her mouth. She put her hands up to his, and
ushered them to the back of her head &#8211; it was the only way that she c=
ould
deep-throat someone, to be forced to do it.

&nbsp;

The other patrons in the pub watched in disbe=
lief.
Two couples left, but three walked in. Missy would have a busy night on her
hands. As the first splash of hot, sour, beer-tasting cum washed down her
throat, she nodded to herself. This time, she would do as he asked,
go back to the doctor, and his cage and his field and his milking. The next
time, the next time she would escape. She was sure of it.=
