Synopsis: A submissive wife is brought to a club where she and her husband will perform for an audience.Shall We Dance? 
Fresh from the shower, I pad out of the bathroom naked, trailing wisps of
  steam. I head toward the bedroom to see what you've selected for me this evening.
  The garter belt and stockings are no surprise. The dress you've selected is.
  It's a slinky cocktail dress with an off-the-shoulder black lycra top that
  clings to my curves and then flares into a short, flouncy, skirt that barely
  falls to mid-thigh. I haven't worn that since New Years. The shoes next to
  the bed are the Brazilian pair, dark, with short sturdy Cuban heels, just tall
  enough to lift and accentuate the curve of my bottom but comfortable enough
  for a long evening. I didn't even bother looking for a bra or panties, they
  wouldn't be here. 
I put on the garter belt, roll the stockings up my legs clipping them onto
  the garter belt and then slip into the dress thankful that it still fits. With
  a giggle I playfully twirl before the dresser mirror, the skirt swirls up.
  I'd be ever so revealed to anyone watching. With a grin I sit before the mirror
  and apply the rich red lip-gloss you've left out, you leave me no other makeup
  for the evening. 
I look up and see your reflection in the mirror. You're standing in the bedroom
  doorway watching; for how long? . The clothing you wear is much more casual
  than mine is. You're dressed in tan slacks, a light blue dress shirt open at
  the neck, and a gray sports coat. When I stand, you close the distance between
  us until your body nearly presses against my back, your breath warm against
  my neck followed by the gentle flutter of a kiss. &quot;We're ready? &quot; you
  ask but you really don't mean it as a question and you don't wait for me to
  answer. I merely follow behind you, out of the bedroom, down the stairway and
  out to the car. 
Ever the gentleman, you hold the car door open for me. I am very careful not
  to sit on my skirt. I shiver, my naked bottom coming to rest on cool vinyl
  as I settle into my seat. You bend down to kiss me. Your lips possess mine
  fully, hungrily, before you tie a black blindfold firmly into place and close
  the car door. I listen as you enter the driver's side; you adjust my seat belt
  and your arm gently brushing against my breasts. Too quickly you pull away
  and the car starts. 
This is how it has always been. We only go to the club on weekends, at night,
  and I am always blindfolded. I could not tell anyone where the club is or even
  how long it takes to drive there. I sit quietly with my hands folded on my
  lap. I'm excited of course, feeling a bit like a bad little girl trying so
  very hard to be good. The drive is mostly in silence, reflective. The radio
  plays soft gentle music, a soothing backdrop for my inner turmoil. You tell
  me casually we will be performing tonight, it makes me even more uneasy. Will
  I be clumsy? Look bad? Make you look bad? 
I don't say a word but you understand my fear. You try to reassure me. 
&quot; You just have to follow my lead, It's my job to show them how beautiful
  you are.&quot; 
A grin crosses my lips, reassured that you will help me perform well. 
We are an odd couple you and I. You are my master and yet for nearly a year,
  you've forbidden me the use of that particular word. It's my own fault. I am
  the one who would use that word inappropriately, without thinking, and often
  I embarrassed you. When I unwittingly called you &quot;Master&quot; before
  my own parents it was the last straw. 
My mother looked from me to you at first with shock and disbelief that slowly
  turned to a bemused smile. I flushed with embarrassment; I could feel your
  rising anger without even looking at you. My father barely noticed; thinking,
  no doubt it was a rare case of sarcasm on my part. 
When we arrived home that dreadful evening you vented your pent-up anger.
  You tied me face down on the bed and you thoroughly punished my poor bottom
  with a leather belt. It was the only time I've ever seriously thought about
  using my safe word. I wonder if you would have stopped; I think so, but I'll
  never know. Since that night I've not been allowed to use the word &quot;Master&quot;. 
You can forbid my saying the word but my thoughts will always know the truth.
  I am yours' a devoted slave and yet you use me like one all too rarely. In
  our ordinary lives I must play the role of your independent wife, on these
  special evenings I can become what I'll always long for, what I was meant to
  be: yours completely. 
The car continues through the night. Later, I really don't know how much later,
  perhaps a half-hour, no more than a full one, the car stops and we are there.
  Your warm patient hands guide me from the car and finally you remove the blindfold
  once we are safely inside. 
It is a private club; we usually come here every week, but we've come at least
  twice a month, for years now. It's always at night, always on a weekend. You
  head toward our table and I follow behind. Miss Ruth waves a casual greeting
  from across the room and heads toward us. 
Her two man-servants flank her. They were obviously selected for their looks.
  Both are tall, muscular, and completely shaven. They could almost be brothers
  except that one is the darkest ebony and the other is such a pale white that
  he seems almost bloodless. 
Everyone calls them the twins, Mistress Ruth has never revealed their true
  names. They both wear nothing but leather chaps. The dark one dressed in glossy
  white leather and the other wears burnished black. I peek at the open juncture
  of the leather leggings when I think (hope) no one is looking. They're nearly
  identical there as well. Neither shows the least sign of arousal, they are
  much too well trained. It is said that with a snap of her fingers they will
  both become rock hard for Ruth, and if she orders them to they will cum spurting
  into the air with no stimulation other than her command. It is something I
  would love to see some day. 
The club is hers of course; I don't know its name or even if it has one. Some
  of those I've heard talking here refer to it as &quot;the power exchange&quot; which
  seems apt but is probably more a description than a title. 
She is nearly at our table now. I look away toward the stage my eyes stealing
  one last glimpse of the two men who remain a respectful pace behind her. On
  stage a demonstration of safe suspension techniques is taking place. A tiny
  oriental woman who I think is called Annie is bound to a massive eight-foot
  high tripod constructed of metal poles and tubing. She is wearing nothing but
  her wrist and ankle bracelets and a pair of impossibly tall high heels but
  with her hands bound high the heels barely allow her feet to touch the ground.
  A small crowd has gathered below the stage to listen as her owner explains,
  gesturing at her using his riding crop as a pointer. 
&quot; Mark! How delightful! You'll be able to use the stage in about a forty-five
  minutes. I hope that will be acceptable?&quot; 
You offer your assent. We sometimes perform on stage; it terrifies and yet
  perversely excites me to be displayed naked before these people we barely know.
  More importantly you want to reveal my submissiveness to them and that alone
  allows my pride to swell. Last week I was allowed to grovel naked at your feet,
  my lips servicing you while you watched others perform on stage. Tonight we
  will perform for them. 
My belly clenches as I feel Mistress Ruth's eyes turn toward me. &quot; My,
  Miss Sarah, you look positively ravishing tonight.&quot; I can not look at
  her; I dare not answer her. She always addresses me with this exaggerated politeness,
  pretending she doesn't know I am a fraud. I sit at the side of my lover clothed
  as if I was a free woman. It is what you want, but my discomfort certainly
  amuses her. 
She may be the one person who recognizes the true irony of my situation. You
  are my master and you want me to act as an independent woman, it is what you
  demand of me. Because I am your slave I acquiesce to that absurd demand. Why
  you must pretend that the woman who surrenders herself to your demands is free
  I do not know. I will play that role as long as you want me to. I would rather
  be kneeling naked at the feet of my master, like so many others at this club
  are allowed to do. You indulge me sometimes but what I desire is of no real
  consequence. You know I wish to wear your collar, you deny me this for your
  own reasons. I will do as my Master wishes, I will even pretend I can refuse
  you. 
&quot;Can I get you a drink Mark?&quot; Miss Ruth asks. 
&quot;Yes please, my regular.&quot; Master replies 
&quot; And Miss Sarah,&quot; her eyes swing toward me again and I hold my
  breath. 
&quot; Perhaps I can get you a cup of tea to sooth those frazzled nerves.&quot; 
She certainly doesn't expect me to respond; she knows my true nature. I should
  sit silently and accept whatever her servants bring me. I should demure to
  her desires. I definitely am not expected to speak up. 
&quot; No thank you Miss Ruth.&quot; I boldly proclaim,&quot; My nerves are
  quite fine and your tea might just makes me need to pee at an inconvenient
  time.&quot; 
God what is wrong with me? Her cloying manner just goads me on; I can't deal
  rationally with this woman. Mistress Ruth's eyes flash with anger and amusement,
  she seems to enjoy the challenge of my little rebellion. She turns to the pale
  twin and instructs him to fetch my lover's regular drink. He returns with Mark's
  bottle of 12 year old Scotch and a glass. He pours about four fingers into
  the tumbler. His duty finished he steps back to his place behind his Mistress
  leaving the bottle behind. Mark offers Ruth a drink but she declines. He raises
  his glass to salute me and I blush. 
&quot;You know Mark, you really ought to put a collar on that cute little
  bitch before someone else does it for you.&quot; Miss Ruth speaks casually
  about me as I fidgeted under her gaze. 
&quot; That cute little bitch is my wife Ruth so don't even think about tossing
  your collar on her.&quot; Mark answers showing a flash of the possessiveness
  that I long for. 
&quot; Oh I wasn't thinking about myself. There are others here who wouldn't
  be the least bit hesitant, married or not. But now that you mention it, maybe
  we could work something out between the two of us� if you'd like.&quot; 
Her eyes sweep over me hungrily and I shrink down into my chair. I should
  be grateful, I suppose, for Ruth is arguing for exactly what I desire! I should
  be kneeling at my lover's feet. I want to wear his collar. Somehow the woman
  manages to be irritating even when she speaks up for what I desire, but dare
  not plead for myself. The two of them continue to discuss me as if I can't
  hear them or more truthfully as if my hearing their thoughts about me is of
  no consequence. 
The demonstration on stage is in full swing now. The little Asian sub is suspended
  off the floor her wrists bound to one leg of the tripod her legs splayed wide
  with ankles bound to the other two legs. She is wearing a belt-like leather
  harness around her waist now that is attached to the chain dangling from the
  top of the tripod and it takes up some of her weight as her body sways suspended.
  The handle of her owner's crop is delving between her legs and she squirms
  delightfully. 
&quot; Gentlemen,&quot; Ruth addresses her two servants, &quot; Would you
  be so good as to take Miss Sarah to the Red room and prepare her. Perhaps give
  her some of that ginger peach tea to help calm her. Make sure she is properly
  attired, I'll expect you to have her on stage in&quot; Their Mistress glanced
  at her watch &quot; about a half hour.&quot; 
They stand behind my chair now waiting for me to rise. The dark one pulls
  my chair back for me as I stand and they both follow me into the changing room.
  Privacy is hardly a concern for me now. When the door to the red room closes.
  The dark twin stands at my side collecting my dress as I pull it off over my
  head. He carefully folds it over the back of one of the spare chairs. The pale
  twin has begun heating water in a hot pot, Mistress Ruth will see that I have
  my tea, one way or another. 
I must remove my garter belt lest it become tangled during our presentation.
  I toss it onto the chair next to my dress. The dark twin kneels and slides
  an elastic garter up my left leg to hold my stocking in place. My legs tremble
  at his intimate caress. His hands reach my upper thigh but he seems unaware
  of my discomfort. He moves over to my right leg. I barely keep from brushing
  my hands over his bald scalp. With my stockings secure I stand stripped before
  these two uncaring men holding out my wrists to be cuffed. The dark twin buckles
  fur lined leather cuffs onto my wrists and then kneels once more to attach
  the ankle cuffs. His head is only inches from my bare pussy I perversely want
  to grab his head and grind myself against it, but he is oblivious. He is ever
  so careful not to put a run in my stockings as the cuffs are tightened around
  my ankles. With a nod I am directed to sit at the small table. 
My tea is ready and the two of them stand arms folded over their chests watching
  me sip the hot beverage. The tea is actually quite good with a touch of honey
  in it and I sit quietly sipping without complaint. I'm sure the two of them
  would probably force the stuff down my throat if I refused it. Their Mistress
  gave them an order and they will no doubt go to any length to obey. I don't
  want to cause them any trouble. When I'm finally done with the tea the time
  passes in agonizingly slow silence. 
At last it is time. The pale one gestures for me to stand and pulls my wrists
  together clipping them together behind my back. The dark one drapes a short
  cape over my shoulders closing it around my neck with a clasp that holds it
  in place. A blindfold is placed over my eyes and darkness swallows me once
  more. I am shivering now as I'm led back into the main room where our audience
  waits. 
Two pairs of hands guide me forward; I mount the stairway leading to the stage.
  The darkness still engulfs me but I know what lies ahead, the eight-foot high
  tripod still commands the center of the stage. The hands stop me and unhook
  the cape that covers me from neck to thigh. It carelessly drops to the floor.
  My breath becomes shorter and faster. 
They applaud though most have seen me naked before. They saw me transformed
  from wife to slave just last week when I knelt naked at your feet. Now, I stand
  nearly naked in my gartered stockings, and my ever so sensible Cuban heels.
  You have put me on display for them. They applaud in appreciation. 
This is more than a private transformation that I perform for my lover; this
  is panic-filled breathing in the darkness as these strangers drink in my nakedness.
  Their eyes claim me. I feel a trembling dread as they clap for me, I become
  theirs for this moment, prey to their whims. The applause slowly fades. They
  are ready. I'm not sure I'm ready but I vow to you, I won't embarrass you. 
The two pairs of unseen hands turn me away from the impatient crowd and I
  feel the heat of spotlights on my back. They walk me forward until my feet
  nudge the low metal crosspiece that braces the long legs of the tripod, The
  bar is about three or four inches off the ground which allows me to slip my
  feet underneath it, two points of support, a hard piece of reality. It's comforting.
  One of the twins kneels down, pushes my feet a little further apart before
  he attaches my ankle cuffs to the bar. 
My thoughts are coming in quick gasps now, rapid and scattered like my breath.
  All too soon these flickering thoughts will be forcefully driven away and I
  will only feel. Now I can feel sheen of sweat forming along my back even as
  I shiver. The leather cuffs that hold my hands bound behind my back are uncoupled,
  but only to bring my hands forward. The two men separate. The one in front
  of me gathers up my hands pulling me forward as he raises my arms toward the
  chain that dangles from the peak of the tripod. I'm forced forward but a second
  crosspiece just shy of hip height forces me to bend at the waist: my balance
  is shifting, breasts swaying and my upper body tips downward only to be pulled
  up short by the length of chain. The other man behind me stands and his hands
  grasp my naked hips, He pulls me back toward him but his only interest is to
  steady me. I am pulled back off the cross bar and forced to stand bent forward. 
It is disconcerting to have these two men handle my body with such indifference.
  A woman should be lusted after when she is bound naked and helpless in the
  hands of these men. If their Mistress gave them the slightest signal they would
  both be instantly ravaging me, pummeling my depths with enthusiasm while my
  helpless body is buffeted between them. They would do this to me, not for their
  own pleasure and certainly not for mine, but only for the pleasure their Mistress
  might derive from my helpless plight. 
I shudder. It is something that I need not fear. You would not allow it. I'm
  not sure if my shudder is for my ephemeral cravings, or actually for the guilt
  I feel for those passing desires. 
I envy these two men that bind me. I envy them the discipline they posses
  and the discipline they endured to gain it. I smile inwardly knowing that only
  a true slave would envy these two slaves. My wrists are secured now and they
  move away. 
The chain is attached running up the front of each wrist cuff. I grasp the
  cold links pulling them hard against my palms. The chain supports my upper
  body's weight. It becomes another bit of cold reality. This too is comforting.
  I adjust my footing as much as my binding allows. I am keenly aware that my
  torso and hips rock seductively as I sway bent forward before my audience. 
There will be only forty lashes; I've handled that before. The club has its
  rules. Only my shoulders and bottom will be struck. I wish it were happening
  already. Where are you? Why are you making me wait? 
Chairs scrape against the hard wood floor, more people gather to watch me
  perform, someone coughs. They are growing impatient at the delay too. Will
  they want to hear my anguished shrieks as the flogging makes me writhe in agony? 
Undoubtedly! 
Will you want to wring those dreadful screams from me as I twist and turn
  under your lash? 
Dark panic and thick sickening fear engulf me as I realize I don't know what
  you want. 
I will not, I can not, fail you. 
A recollection of your words 
&quot;� follow my lead. It is up to me to show them your beauty.&quot; 
Relief! A weight is lifted with the memory. A flicker of a smile crosses my
  face with this newfound certainty. I have no need to worry. You will lead me. 
It is a gift you've given me, like my safe word. A precious present that you
  bestowed on me. I will cherish it but I know I will never need to use it. I
  hope you choose the crop, it will hurt a bit more than the six-tailed flogger
  will but the crop is much more accurate and precise; far easier directions
  to follow. 
The crowd is making restless noises, I strain to hear your approach but I
  can only hear my own ragged breathing and the wild beating of my heart. A hand,
  your hand, reaches over my leaning back and brushes against my swaying side.
  I gasp joyfully. You are beside me now, so close I can feel your body's heat.
  Your hand brushes along my back and over the curve of my squirming bottom.
  Unbidden, moisture seeps between my lower lips and my body quivers at your
  touch. Surely you can smell my desire as you bend closer. I feel the six thin
  leather straps casually caress my thigh. Your free hand is beneath me now running
  along my quaking belly, soothing, petting, and preparing me as it descends. 
It is too much; I want you, no need you, to begin. My heart thumps louder
  and I can barely hear your whisper before you step back. 
&quot; Shall we dance?&quot; 
and we dance. 
The whistle of the knotted leather tips slicing the air gives me a fraction
  of a second to prepare, muscles begin to tighten and my bottom clenches. Pain
  shrieks out slashing from right to left and my hips twist instinctively away
  to the left. I can hear the crowds murmur but before I can steady myself and
  return to my center the leather lashes from left to right with your backstroke.
  My body lurches to the right as I cling to the chain that holds my torso up.
  Already tears are forming but I've yet to make a sound. Again you lash out
  from left to right then back again. My body twists at your command And I gasp
  at the sheer agony, but you follow without letup another pair of blows and
  at last I cry out in pain as my body swings wildly back and forth. 
With a few flicks of your wrist you have reduced me to an unthinking primal
  creature. Your will is all I respond to. You have demonstrated your ownership
  to all these others even if you won't admit it to yourself. You can make me
  cry out on so many levels. I am yours to do with what you will. I accept this
  at the most visceral level, one that is beyond all thought. I have known this
  for as long as I have known you, but it is only times like these when I can
  truly feel it. 
You must be standing directly behind me, blocking their view of my glowing
  bottom except when I twist from side to side. You allow me just a moment, time
  enough to fill my lungs. You follow with two more hard blows and I cry out
  pitifully, again a moment's respite while I beg for your forgiveness. Your
  whip flicks out, another pair and I'm reduced to a blubbering sob as I try
  to regain my breath and remember a moment before this darkness and pain. 
And then you stop. 
You are next to me, your cool hands roaming across the tender, burning flesh
  of my bottom. You are whispering in my ear but it takes me a few moments to
  concentrate, and your precious words are lost. The crowd is a buzzing noise
  far off in the background, Your hand is coolness and heaven and my bottom greedily
  follows it squirming in delight as your fingers caress the throbbing heat.
  A finger probes lower and I raise myself toward it pressing back with a wanton
  hunger. I haven't begun to make sense of your words but your tone is full of
  desire and need. If we were alone I'm sure you would be inside me by now. The
  whipping interrupted for a moment to allow you to slake your desires. I whimper
  my own need but you have already stepped back. 
We are here for the others now, not ourselves. 
Again the whistle of knotted leather, from my left this time. My legs stiffen
  muscles tense and then a gasp of surprise. Agony erupts in my right shoulder
  as the knotted tips rain down. I whimper and twist as the whip pulls away.
  Time hangs silent for a moment then the whistle comes again, I am prepared
  now as pain explodes across my left shoulder. My chest twists downward, breasts
  sway below. I am gasping as the breath is driven from me. And I hear the damnable
  whistle of leather again. I brace myself for the pain but the leather bites
  into my bottom from behind, just above my straining thighs. My legs tug against
  the ankle cuffs as I bounce upward and lurch forward. You will give me no peace,
  no chance to prepare. I will dance as you see fit. The crowd seems pleasantly
  amused, Some are clapping at what seems a slow rhythmic pace shouting words
  of encouragement to you and bellowing out suggestions that are both imaginative
  and obscene. 
For now I do nothing but feel the pain and react as best as my limited movement
  allows. You linger a bit now, allowing some time between the flicks of your
  flogger. It strikes with a harsh anger that marks my flesh without breaking
  the skin but at this moment I could hardly swear to that. I'm sure I can feel
  blood dripping from my lacerated back and bottom though it is in fact only
  my dripping sweat. 
Most often the whip manages to fall exactly where I don't expect. If there
  is a pattern you follow I never will figure it out. I have lost all track of
  the number of blows. The flesh of my upper back and my shoulders is ablaze.
  My bottom and upper thighs scream out in hot desperation. I am sure this agony
  will never end. A particularly vicious blow lands across my buttocks pushing
  me forward as I cling to the chain that holds me up. Without pause a second
  then a third blow land across my bottom. Each blow sends me lurching forward,
  my thighs banging against the cross brace. My screams are a primal plea but
  I still push my bottom back toward you each time. There's a split second pause
  then the fourth angry blow and I howl like a wounded beast. 
&quot;Forty&quot; 
The voice is one of the twins they have never left the stage and have been
  silently counting while I twisted under the lash. The crowd mutters its disappointment
  that my torment is ending, but many continue to applaud our performance. I
  hear the whip clatter to the ground as you drop it and then you are behind
  me holding me gently, cool hands gingerly caress my breast supporting me raising
  me from below with your strength while you try not to brush against tender
  bottom. Slowly you straighten me while four hands swiftly go to work loosening
  my cuffs from the metal structure. 
When I am free and standing upright I lean backward pressing my burning skin
  against you. I sigh feeling the rough scratchy texture of your clothes on my
  punished flesh. I tilt my head backward my neck arching as my head comes to
  rests on your shoulder. You tenderly kiss my proffered neck. I can feel your
  body tremble with your desire. You grip my shoulders and turn me toward the
  crowd. 
About twenty people have gathered in front of the stage, near the stairway.
  With a little prodding you make me bow to them. I don't want to look, I really
  wish I could close my eyes and ignore this noisy group but they continue to
  clap, stamp, and whistle until I'm blushing. My face must be nearly as red
  as my bottom. The twins move past me clearing the crowd from the stairs. You
  have released your grip and stand behind me. I don't want to move down into
  the crowd but there is no choice. 
With a courage I don't really feel my feet move forward, one step at a time
  I approach the stairs leading down onto the floor. I glance back and you are
  there, following a pace behind me. When I turn my head toward the crowd again,
  it has grown and there seem to be about thirty people crowding the base of
  the stage arms outstretched trying to reach me. The twins have opened a narrow
  passage for me and I descend into the waiting throng. 
Hands reach for me, there is no stopping it. People are petting, grabbing,
  and stroking my abused body. I truly do belong to them now. In my helpless
  nakedness I am now stripped of my last shreds of pride. Some wish to feel the
  warmth of my glowing flesh, others feel a need to add a final swat to my bruised
  bottom. These strangers feel no compunction about my dignity as the grab at
  my breasts, twist my nipples, and poke fingers at my most intimate openings. 
I silently pray for rescue but you allow this. Coming up from behind me you
  bend me forward holding my hips in place, your foot pushing my legs apart.
  Opening me to make their exploration easier. My tears flow, not for the shame
  you are forcing upon me but for my reaction to it. 
While my legs may be trembling it is with desire not fear. My swollen lower
  lips part as moisture weeps from them. My hips twist and jerk spasmodically
  as they search for new hands willing to caress me. I feel shameless and at
  the same time I'm full of shame. I have followed your lead, I am what you've
  created, and I've become your willing slut. 
Even the other subs feel entitled to abuse me. I watch a naked young woman
  crawling to my open legs her tongue licking the length of my upper thigh. I
  cry out in yearning and despair. 
You are in front of me now, taking my right hand. You lead me forward, through
  the crowd of groping hands toward the safety of the changing room. You are
  anxious, and swiftly you rush me into the room closing the door sharply on
  the final few followers. I anxiously fall to my knees before you and struggle
  to undo your belt You gently push me back and loosen your pants letting them
  drop and then step free of them. I lean forward, my ravenous lips demanding,
  but again you restrain me. 
I feel hurt and perplexed until I realize you are lowering yourself to the
  ground, stretching out on your back, Your thick shaft throbbing as it waits
  for me. I joyfully straddle your hips. My hand reaches down between my legs
  to guide your firm flesh toward my hungry lips. Your cool hands are on my throbbing
  bottom supporting my weight. I try to sink down on you but your hands are unyielding.
  I groan in frustration. 
You arch your hips pushing upward and I feel you deep inside, slowly you slide
  out again teasing me. I try to understand but my lust is making it difficult
  to concentrate. Your hands still support my bottom preventing me from sinking
  down, keeping me from danc� 
At last I think I know what it is you want. I raise my arms my hands joined
  behind my neck. This pose always shows my breasts to their best advantage.
  Your smile is one of delight and I am rewarded. Your hands reach up to support
  my breasts and I slowly sink down. You fill my every need. 
And we dance once again.
