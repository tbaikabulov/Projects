AURA GOES TOO FAR

By Tcheser

5/2006

&nbsp;

Dedicated to my sexy new friend Aura Maria Gabriella
Rodriguez.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Mark and Aura had been married and living happily together
for several years. They had a nice home but had no children yet. Mark was eager
for a family, but Aura wasn�t ready. She said she was having too much fun at
the moment and that could come later, which was okay with Mark. He could wait. He
loved Aura. She was beautiful and witty and full of life. She wasn�t perfect of
course. She had faults like everyone else. For instance she dressed far too provocatively,
didn�t seem capable of taking care of the house and had a hard time remaining monogamous,
but Mark could forgive her anything it seemed as long as he knew she loved him.

&nbsp;

That is until one day she went too far. She had gone in to
church early one Sunday without Mark to deliver some donations for the poor.
Mark arrived a bit later. He however found her not in the chapel as planned
however. Rather when he went to hang up his coat he found her in the closet snogging
and groping with one of the Vicars. Aura�s had her top pulled down exposing
nearly all her womanly charms and the Vicar�s hands were everywhere they
shouldn�t be. Mark was blown away. His wife was making out with a man of the
cloth in a church on Sunday no less. 

&nbsp;

Mark didn�t know what to say or do at first. He thought
seriously about decking the Vicar, but knew no matter how much he deserved it
that wouldn�t solve his problem. So he just went about separating them. He
pulled his oblivious wife out of the closet first startling her something awful
and then grabbed the Vicar by his arm and pulled him to his feet. Realizing who
Mark was the Vicar apologized profusely and begged Mark not to hurt him or tell
anyone else what had happened, especially not anyone in the church. Mark agreed
as he didn�t see how that would help anyone but told the Vicar to never even
think about coming near his wife again. The Vicar promised and said that had
she not been teasing him with her short skirts and suggestive looks and
comments it would have never gotten this far. Mark pretended he didn�t hear
that and told the Vicar to get out of his sight. He didn�t want to hear anymore
of his reasons or excuses for his foul behavior. The Vicar nodded and hurried
away before Mark changed his mind.

&nbsp;

What the Vicar said once again confirmed what Mark had been
thinking for quite some time though. Aura just couldn�t control herself. If she
could she would have never gone into the closet with the Vicar. She just didn�t
know how to behave, how to be a proper wife, how to not get him in trouble. She
needed help. She had practically goaded the Vicar into fooling around with her
after all. She thought it was a thrill. He could see it in her eyes. 

&nbsp;

Mark still asked her why she had done it though and she
responded simply that she had never meant it to go that far. She was just being
nice to the Vicar. She knew he was new in town and all. She was just being
friendly and he apparently liked what he saw and couldn�t keep his hands off
the goodies. Before she knew it they were in the closet. She said she was sorry
and for the hundredth time said it wouldn�t happen again. She then went about
fixing her makeup and straightening her waist length hair and clothes in a
gilded mirror nearby. 

&nbsp;

Aura claimed it wouldn�t happen again, but he knew it would.
It always happened again and it just seemed to be getting worse. This time it
was at their church with a man of the cloth and she didn�t even really sound
sorry or even concerned. That hurt and considering what she was wearing Mark
had a hard time believing it wasn�t premeditated. She looked like she was
trolling nightclubs for a cheap fuck in what she wore to church that day; A tight
leather bustier that barely contained her luscious breasts and did more to
display them for all to see then cover them, formfitting hipster leather pants
that left very little of her long shapely legs a mystery and a pair of very
expensive matching black Italian stiletto heeled boots. With her slender and
graceful yet curvaceous figure and flawless skin, enchanting bedroom eyes,
pouty lips covered in wet looking lip gloss and long dark flowing glossy hair
down to her waist Mark had a hard time blaming the Vicar. He had a hard time
blaming any of them. Aura however knew what she was doing and was totally
unrepentant he realized. Who would it be next time he wondered? Someone from
his work? That good looking young doctor she went to who always devoured her
with his eyes? His young office girl who seemed to share a special moment with
her every time she visited his office?

&nbsp;

That�s when Mark snapped. At that moment he realized what
had to be done. He grabbed Aura by her long silky hair eliciting a little yelp
of surprise and pain and led her out of the church and to their car. She
struggled the whole way and called him many unflattering names. Asshole. Fuckhead.
Jackass. Motherfucker. When she wanted to she could swear just like a sailor. She
knew all the foul words and put them to good use. 

&nbsp;

Outside in the parking lot she then broke away from him and
demanded to know what he was doing. Mark told her simply that they were going
home. He didn�t want to make any more of a scene here then he already had. She
could leave her Porsche in the church parking lot for now and ride with him. Never
particularly liking church Aura was fine with that. She slipped her designer
sunglasses on and strutted over to Mark�s car like nothing was wrong.

&nbsp;

Something was wrong however and Mark drove them home in
silence. They arrived to find Mark�s sisters, Clara and Rose; they attended the
same church but had gone to an earlier service. Now they were hanging the
laundry and cleaning the house. They actually lived down the street but stopped
by whenever Aura needed a hand with things. They wouldn�t allow their beloved
brother to live in a dirty or disorganized house. Both were housewives for the
most part and generally looked it wearing simple housedresses and jumpers. Like
Mark they were both tall and athletic.

&nbsp;

They were very industrious as well. In addition to helping
Aura and running their own households Clara was also a part time health teacher
and Rose worked at a local motel. They knew keeping house was not Aura�s strong
suit and as their kids were pretty old at this point and didn�t need their
mothers around all the time they didn�t mind helping Aura and their brother out
sometimes. Or most of the time as it had become in the last few months. Between
her salon visits, time spent at the gym, shopping and spa trips Aura rarely had
time to do anything around the house. 

&nbsp;

They were only somewhat surprised to see Mark and Aura home
early from church. He seemed very angry and Aura looked more haughty then ever.
She stormed away from her husband and entered the bathroom as soon as they came
in the door. Privately Clara and Rose asked Mark if something was wrong and he
told them in very plain terms what Aura had done. They feigned shock, but they
weren�t really surprised. Clearly the honeymoon was over. Mark told them he had
reached the end of his rope with her and asked them if they would help him straighten
Aura out. They readily agreed. It was high time Aura was brought down to earth
and they had some good ideas how.

&nbsp;

So when Aura finally came out of the bathroom they led her
into the living room where Mark had her sit on the sofa between his sisters
while he stood before her and explained what was going on. He had been pushed
beyond his breaking point he told her. He could no longer tolerate her flirting
and infidelity. If she wished to remain his wife and live in the house he had
provided for her then things were going to have to change. They were going to
have to change a lot and she was the main thing that needed to change. Mark�s
sisters voiced their wholehearted agreement. 

&nbsp;

Aura felt very alone and outnumbered. Worse still was that
with Mark�s sisters around it was very awkward for Aura to try and seduce Mark
out of his intentions as she would have liked to do. Had they not been there
she would have cozied up to him purring seductively and coxed his snake out of
his pants. In her experience at that point it would be two minutes before he
took a very contented nap and forgot what he had been mad about. His sisters
were there though so Aura unfortunately didn�t have that option this day. 

&nbsp;

She didn�t want to leave Mark either. She loved him even if
she wasn�t the most loyal of wives and she didn�t have anywhere to go. Any
money either. She had blown all the money her husband gave her on shopping as
she always did. Reluctantly she agreed to do whatever Mark asked. Aura was
about to say something else when Mark angrily silenced her. He said he had
heard enough of her excuses and evasions and lies. If she opened her mouth
again he would cut out her tongue. In truth Mark would probably never do so a
thing, but after what Aura knew deep down she had put him through recently she
was afraid he might.

&nbsp;

That settled Mark had Clara lock the door and Rose close the
blinds. He told Aura she wasn�t probably going to like what was going to
happen, but it was necessary. He wanted her to know that he still loved her and
if she wanted to stay with him it had to be done. Since all his attempts to
engender some decorum and fidelity with words had failed he had come to the
conclusion that he had to make her a decent woman from the outside in. She was
just too damn desirable he explained and that had to change.

&nbsp;

That said his sisters each took her by an arm. Then very
methodically they stripped her of all her fine designer clothes. Dior boots, leather
Jitrois pants, and Minkvox bustier were all removed despite Aura�s struggles.
Then to her horror her clothes they were thrown carelessly into the fire Mark
had made in the fireplace just for this. Then before she had a chance to see
them burn, her expensive Victoria�s
Secret panty and bra set was stripped off as well. Watching hundreds of dollars
of expensive clothing go up in smoke made Aura defiant though and she cursed
them all. Loudly and spitefully. She squirmed so much as they stripped her that
her underwear was ruined before it had even reached the fire. Torn to pieces as
the sisters tried to get if off her. 

&nbsp;

The sisters then began spanking and slapping her exposed
bottom and pinching her delicate nipples. They had treated Aura like a sister,
covered for her and stuck up for her and now they felt betrayed by her
continually shameful and lewd behavior. They delighted in disciplining her like
the naughty lazy little bitch she was. Each having had several children they
were well experienced in this area and Aura could find no way to stop their
stinging hands from connecting with her delicate posterior. If she tried to
move away from Rose she ran into Clara. They called her a whore, a slut, a
jezebel, and worse. Aura disagreed but was in no position to argue with them.

&nbsp;

And while his sisters warmed Aura�s naughty little backside
Mark told her how she was never going to wear such provocative clothes again.
No more skin tight pants, cleavage baring tops and sky high heels. No more
silky stockings, sexy mini skirts and daring halters. No more Juicy, Chanel, and Calvin Klein. Nope.
What hadn�t already been destroyed and his sisters didn�t want was going to be
donated to the Salvation Army. This naturally sparked a great cry of anguish from
Aura. She begged for mark to reconsider. She loved all her fine sexy designer
clothes. Mark was resolute though and for her outburst Rose took Aura over her
knee so she could really lay into her defenseless rear. As her hand didn�t seem
to be doing the job Rose used a large wooden hairbrush Clara found for her.
Aura had never been really been so thoroughly spanked before and reacted with a
great amount of kicking, bawling and tears. That didn�t stop the sisters from
spanking her though. Her cries and tears were music to their ears and they
alternated holding her and spanking her so they both got a chance to punish the
little tease.

&nbsp;

Only when mark saw that Aura�s bouncing bottom was suitably
red and blistered did he tell his sisters to stop. Feeling she deserved more
the sisters reluctantly let Aura up. She stood before her angry husband in
visible pain and quite unsteadily. She was naked and shamed and without her
heels he towered over her. Mark then announced that Aura was ready for them to
really begin. He told her that the way she was behaving was shameful. It
certainly wasn�t the way a proper wife should behave. He saw now that simply
taking away her sexy clothes wasn�t going to be enough though. They needed to
radically alter her lifestyle to teach her some modesty and humility. 

&nbsp;

To begin with from now on she wasn�t to leave the house
without his express permission. If he wasn�t available she was to ask Clara or
Rose for permission to go out. If it was an emergency and she couldn�t contact
any of them it was fine for her to go out, but it had better be a real
emergency or her poor behind would pay for it. As he spoke he removed her
Cartier bracelet, diamond necklace and all her rings except her wedding band. Her
flashy little red sports car was also off limits from now on. She didn�t
deserve it and he was tired of making the payments on it. If she needed to be
somewhere she could walk or take the bus.

&nbsp;

Despite previously submitting to their will Aura loved her
Porsche too much and couldn�t help but respond indignantly. She thought this
whole matter was unfair she said and refused to give up her beloved sports car.
She wouldn�t walk. She wouldn�t take the bus. Only losers took the bus. And
come to think of it she refused to be treated like this. She was an attractive
grown woman. She didn�t need Mark�s permission or his sisters to do anything!

&nbsp;

For this she was again spanked. This time draped over the
end of the sofa with her already red and blotched derriere high in the air for
all to observe. The sisters used both their hands and the hairbrush and soon
her righteous anger began to give way to total contrition. She howled in pain
and regret and apologized profusely for her behavior and her outburst. Remorse
poured forth from her like a torrent as her cheeks were covered in her hot salty
tears. Finally when the sister�s arms began to tire she was again let up. She
could barely stand and was not allowed to rub her sore bottom. She promised contritely
that she would behave from this point on and go along with whatever they had
planned. In reply Mark shrugged and said simply that she had better or else she
would just receive another dose and she certainly didn�t want that.

&nbsp;

Mark then told her he didn�t think all her various piercings
were appropriate. He looked to his sisters and they agreed Aura�s belly ring
and triple ear piercings looked cheap and tarty. That settled Mark removed the
offending adornments. First her belly button ring, which went in the trash, and
then the three in each of her lovely ears. She wasn�t sure but she felt he
twisted her ears more then was necessary and she cried out in pain as each was
removed. These, including a very expensive pair of white gold diamond earrings,
went into Mark�s pocket.

&nbsp;

She also wouldn�t go around made up like a streetwalker mark
told her. All her eye-shadow, liner, lipstick, blush and mascara had to go so
they dragged her into the kitchen to clean her up. Clara was the stronger of
the two and armed with a wash rag and cold cream took this upon herself. Rose
meanwhile gathered up all of Aura�s makeup from the bathrooms, bedroom and all
the other places her sister in law had stock piled it. She had quite a hefty
bag when she finished gathering it all up. Mark told her she and her sister
could have what they want and they would throw out the rest. By then Clara had
finished divesting Aura of the last remnants of her carefully applied
cosmetics. She looked much different with all the makeup to bring out her
features. She looked washed out, tired and defeated. 

&nbsp;

It was then time for her to put some decent clothes on. She
had run around naked enough for one day. So out came a selection of clothes
Mark had gathered while they had been cleaning Aura up. They looked like his
Aunt Myrtle�s old things which was weird to Aura as she knew there was no way
Myrtles things would fit her. Mark�s aunt had been more then a bit overweight
when she finally had to go into managed care. Before she was allowed to slip
them on though Mark and his sisters had some special undergarments they wanted
her to wear. First in place of the thong panties she usually wore she was given
a very large awkward Lycra undergarment. Turning it around she realized it was
a full coverage brief, what made it special though was that it was padded. It
had four pouches that contained foam pads. It was made to give a woman or
perhaps a transvestite a more womanly shapely figure. It was very tight and
difficult to get on she found. Once Aura had it on she found it did something
else for her though. As she was already quite shapely and curvy the added pads
made her thighs and rump look huge. It was like she had suddenly gained 25
pounds!

&nbsp;

Then came the piece de resistance. Aura didn�t know where
Mark had found it but he produced an odd garment Aura couldn�t identify. It was
shaped like some sort of large sleeveless smock and made of a heavy taupe
colored material. Just to torment her Clara held her hand over Aura�s eyes
while Mark and Rose wrestled the odd garment on her. As they snapped it in
place and cinched it here and there Aura became increasingly uncomfortable.
Whatever they were putting on her had weight to it and she had to shift her
stance and posture to remain standing. She felt it increasingly in her lower
back and when they finished it also constricted her awkwardly across the chest.
She begged for them to let her see what they were doing and finally they did. 

&nbsp;

She looked huge. Like she was pregnant almost! Which she
finally realized was what the garment was for. It was an empathy belly
pregnancy simulator. She had heard about them on the news. Some schools and
groups used them to teach teens about pregnancy and deglamorize it. They
figured that if they knew what being pregnant was really like they would be
more careful in avoiding it. Aura didn�t need such a lesson though. She had
already been avoiding pregnancy because she didn�t want to put up with all that
came with it. Now here she was with a big round belly and enlarged sagging
breasts pulling on her and restricting her breathing. 

&nbsp;

She didn�t quite really look pregnant though which puzzled
her until Mark explained. He told her that as she wasn�t pregnant he didn�t see
why she should enjoy the attention an expectant mother would receive. So he had
modified the empathy belly somewhat. He had removed the weights and balls
within the belly that simulated the movement of an unborn child and filled the
interior instead with a large silicone filled bladder. Then he modified the
belly so the bulk was more evenly distributed around her midsection and
protruded less. The end result was that she looked much heavier, but not with
child. The silicone weighed a bit more as well, but with a smile he added that
Aura needed to be slowed down anyway.

&nbsp;

Aura begged for them to let her take it off. It was already
becoming hot and uncomfortable, but Mark said that wouldn�t be happening. She
would get used to the added weight and dimensions he promised and then told
Clara and Rose to go ahead and finish helping Aura dress. Amused greatly by the
whole ordeal the sisters happily obliged and continued dressing Aura in the
clothes mark had provided. For Aura though it was just humiliation after
humiliation. She particularly didn�t like the restrictive minimzer bra they
pulled over her breasts or in actuality the false breasts of the pregnancy
simulator. The plain utilitarian garment was huge and white and had no less
then five hooks in the back. It made it hard to breathe and made her wonderful
breasts look positively tiny. Between the tight padded panty brief, the awkward
and heavy empathy belly and the torturous bra Aura didn�t think she could be
less comfortable. They weren�t even finished yet though.

&nbsp;

Over the padded brief she was then given a pair of very
heavy duty taupe colored support hose. They were like nothing she had ever worn
before. Only old women and cleaning ladies wore hose like this she thought. They
were awful and came up over her fake belly button to her new waist care of the
expandable tummy panel. They were very sturdy with ugly reinforced toes and
heels. Aura very much doubted she could put a run in them if she tried.

&nbsp;

On top of everything else she was then dressed in a plain white
nylon slip that came down to her knees. Further then any of her skirts ever
went. With it and the maternity hose on Aura realized the padded panties and
pregnancy simulator were well concealed. Anyone seeing her now would actually
believe she was as heavy as she looked. A real heifer of a homebody they would
call her she imagined. This was a horrible blow to Aura who exercised fanatically
and stressed out about maintaining the perfect weight. She had always freaked
when she gained a pound or two during the holidays and now she looked at least
half again her own weight. 

&nbsp;

Clara had struggled with her weight for years and Aura never
let her forget she wasn�t a size six anymore. Clara delighted in finally being
able to return the many rude comments Aura had heaped on her as Aura now
appeared to be the heavier of the two. Aura couldn�t take this and cried for
Mark to punish her some other way, but to Clara�s pleasure he refused. He then
even added that Aura would wear this whole contraption until she had gained
enough weight that it wasn�t needed anymore. The worst news by far for Aura and
she again broke down sobbing, mourning her lost figure.

&nbsp;

Her ordeal still wasn�t even over yet though. She was sat next
in a straight backed wooden chair atop several phone books. Then she had listen
nervously as the matter of what to do with her hair came up. It was next on the
agenda and she was horrified. The sisters loudly discussed what to do next as
they ran their hands through her crowning glory. At one point Clara mentioned
just shaving off all of Aura�s hair. She then wouldn�t be able to toss it
around seductively anymore and wouldn�t have to spend all that time and money
at the salon either she reasoned. Hearing this made Aura really nervous. She
got down on her knees and begged them not to cut her beautiful hair off. She
had had it forever. She had never cut it much and loved it more then anything. More
then her fancy little red sports car. More then her designer clothes and
jewelry. More then anything. It was her pride and joy and she didn't think she
could go on without it. She couldn�t be bald.

&nbsp;

The Sisters seemed thoughtful for a moment after hearing all
this. They certainly didn't want Aura to be that bad off they decided. So Rose
offered her an alternative. They wouldn't cut of all her hair as long as she
agreed to maintain whatever hairstyle they finally choose. Eager to save her
crowing glory Aura quickly agreed. As long as they didn�t shave her bald she
would be live with whatever hairstyle they decided was best. She would have
agreed to anything at that point to save her hair and was relieved when they
said they wouldn�t shave her bald. 

&nbsp;

So after some more discussion the sisters finally decided to
give Aura a perm. A nice tight respectable looking perm it would be too. They
said permed hair would look more respectable and be more in keeping with her
new lifestyle. It would take much less care and styling allowing her to spend
more time at home. Mark agreed it was the best option and excused himself to
work on something else. He didn�t care for the smell of the perm solution.
Everyone chuckled except Aura who wished they would just get on with it. The
sisters sensed her impatience and Rose whispered in her ear that she might not
want to be in such a hurry. She might want to savor these last moments with her
stunning locks. That sent chills down Aura�s spine and she nearly bolted from
the chair. She hesitated a moment too long and missed her chance though and
they surrounded her and laid a sheet around her to catch the cut hair. Then
Rose produced her hairstyling tools and to aura�s horror they began in earnest.

&nbsp;

First they had to trim her long gloriously glossy hair a bit
they decided. So they wetted down her hair and combed it out straight so they
could pare it down. Rose seemed very adept with the scissors Aura noted and
then she recalled Mark saying that she had worked in a hair salon during high
school. Aura was glad at least that Rose knew what she was doing, but hated her
for daring to cut her gorgeous hair. She didn�t just trim her hair either. She
pulled it back into a ponytail and with an ego crushing SSHHNNIICCCKKK very
deftly cut nearly all of Aura�s hair off. Only 3 or 4 inches remained when she
was finished cutting. Aura could see her dainty little ears fully exposed for
the first time in forever it seemed. She had always had such long hair after
all.

&nbsp;

The cut hair was all over the place by now. It was on the
floor, on the chair and on Aura. They picked up most of it and bagged it. They
figured they could have it made into a wig. Just because Aura didn�t deserve
didn�t mean someone else couldn�t appreciate it. Still there was hair about
though as there always is when someone gets their hair cut. Clara solved this
problem using a feather duster to clean Aura off.� This made Aura sneeze repeatedly, which they
both thought was very funny. So Clara brushed her face off again making her
sneeze even more. Then before she had truly recovered from her sneezing fit the
sisters began rolling her remaining hair up in a multitude of pink and blue
rods and then applied some foul smelling chemicals to it. 

&nbsp;

While the perm solution did its thing the sisters turned
their attention to another area. To her dismay they found fault with her nails.
They said a proper housewife would never be caught dead with colored talons
like hers. So despite her fervent objections they clipped off her very
expensively manicured inch long nails and cleansed them of all the carefully applied
sultry red nail polish.

&nbsp;

They then went back to her hair and removed all the rods.
What remained of Aura�s gorgeous hair was then revealed. She couldn�t see it
but grew very fearful of what she might find from the excited noises and
mocking laughter she heard behind her. She asked for a mirror, but the sisters
told her to wait. The sisters still had to shape it a bit. When they were
finished clipping, fluffing and trimming it though, they still denied her a
mirror. Instead they called Mark in to see what they had accomplished. Aura
could tell Mark didn�t like what he saw, but he acted delighted just to torment
her and complimented Rose and Clara on their skills. He said it was a Herculean
task making a disgraceful slut like Aura look halfway respectable.

&nbsp;

Mark then finally gave into Aura�s pleas for a mirror. He
brought in the big mirror from the bedroom and set it in front of Aura so she
could see how she looked. A moment later she wished he hadn�t bothered. Her
hair looked horrible. She looked like she was wearing a bad wig of short very
tightly curled hair made from the beautiful hair she had sported that morning.
Aura had previously thought she could live with a perm, anything to allow her
to keep her hair she had reasoned, but now she wondered if she wouldn�t have
looked better with no hair at all. Her new head of hair had no style. It didn�t
suit her at all. It wasn�t her she saw in the mirror. It was a stranger. A sad
looking stranger with a horrible hairdo. 

&nbsp;

Nearly in tears and stunned by what had happened to her hair
Aura was like a zombie for the rest of her ordeal. She said and did nothing
when they pulled her up off the chair, whisked off the sheet covered in hair
and dusted her off. She just stood there in shock as they finally dressed her
in a dreadful looking gown of blue on white floral homespun fabric with long
sleeves and a modest round collar. It came down well past her knees and looked
like something she had seen on the women of religious sects that practiced
plain dressing. Clunky wheat colored orthopedic shoes and an old brown cardigan
completed her ensemble.

&nbsp;

Led in front of the mirror again she could see she certainly
wouldn�t be turning men�s heads anymore. With her awful short brillo pad-esque
permed hair and seemingly overweight padded out body with huge hips, belly and
ass she looked like the frumpiest little hausfrau imaginable. She wouldn�t be
tempting and teasing men into closets like this and knowing Mark this was going
to last as long as necessary. To fill the days she had been previously spent
shopping and pampering herself Mark said she was now going to throw herself
into housekeeping and maintaining a respectable household. Resigned now to her
fate Aura simply nodded. 

&nbsp;

Continuing Mark told her that her days of lounging about and
depending on his sisters and himself were over. She had wrecked that gravy
train with her scandalous behavior which had made them all look bad. To make up
for it she would make herself available to Clara and Rose whenever they needed
her. If they needed a babysitter she was it. If Clara needed help at school she
was her assistant. If Rose needed someone to fill in at the hotel she was their
designated chambermaid without complaint. 

&nbsp;

She was to a helpful, modest, unassuming housewife from now
on. If she was ever found to be something other then that or found flirting
again or dressing in her old provocative style she would be punished. Mark
didn�t say how but it was clear she wouldn�t like it. Further Clara and Rose
would also be watching her and had his full support in disciplining her as they
saw fit should she be found wanting. She would maintain her current appearance
until told otherwise and do as she was told or she could leave. Mark didn�t
know if he would ever change his mind about this, but he did know that if she
disobeyed him on this he certainly wouldn�t.

&nbsp;

Aura reluctantly agreed. She would be the plump dowdy
looking hausfrau from now on. She would follow orders and be respectable. She
would dress like a fashion challenged babushka and wear hair shawls and get
terrible perms. She had gone too far. She realized now she had gone and ruined everything.
She had lived a perfect charmed life up until now, but because of her arrogance
and thoughtlessness it was over. She would have to accept no longer being a
sexy pampered tease who wore sexy designer clothes and was drooled over by men
and be Mark�s simple little housewife.
