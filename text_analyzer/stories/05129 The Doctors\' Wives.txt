Sylvia
had promised that she would lay out Jodi�s cocktail outfit for her on the bed,
and there it was as promised. Jodi stood by herself in the back bedroom looking
nothing more than a small pile of lingerie. The long afternoon sun streamed in
the west window and cast a bright ray across the bed, highlighting the
comically-skimpy waitress outfit that Sylvia had selected for her to wear to the
evening�s gala event. 

&nbsp;

At first Jodi looked underneath it, thinking there had to
be some mistake. She pulled the covers back and checked under there, but of
course there was nothing more. She even tried looking under the bed. Finally
she gave up and gathered up the underwear, storming out into the kitchen with
it to look for Sylvia. 

&nbsp;

Sure enough Sylvia was there, busy yelling at the cooks�
complaining as usual about the bitterness of the consomm�, the temperature of
the wine, silverware and a hundred other things that rich hostesses love to do
while they�re not actually doing any work. Jodi
marched right up to her, indignantly holding up the handful of underwear in
front of the kitchen crew and wait staff. �This?
This is what you want me to wear
tonight?� she said hotly, shaking the lingerie menacingly in Sylvia�s face.
Sylvia�s face flushed red for just an instant, and wasting no time she composed
herself enough to grab Jodi by the arm and escort her to the other room. She
pinched Jodi�s arm painfully, lifting upward and making it hard for Jodi to
keep up. 

&nbsp;

Reaching the other room, Sylvia whirled around and slapped
her. Hard. Jodi rocked back, instinctively bringing a
hand to her face. �That�s right, honey,� Sylvia hissed at her, just softly
enough for the staff not to hear. �And if you don�t like it, you can leave
right now, back to your shitty little life� without pay. Otherwise, put it on
and grab a tray. I�m not paying you to embarrass me like that!� Jodi recoiled,
frightened at how quickly Sylvia had turned on her. She started to cry, then decided not to give her the satisfaction. Sylvia turned
to go, then turned back. �And I�ll tell you something
else, you little slattern� she
continued, her words dripping venom. �You�ll never make this much money without
lying on your back. And you know it.� 

&nbsp;

With that she simply left Jodi cowering, turned, and
resumed her verbal assault on the kitchen staff without missing a beat. The
staff� having been noticeably silent throughout their conversation as they
strained to hear� resumed their work abruptly, banging their pots and pans and
continuing as if nothing had happened. Whatever else, Jodi knew that she could
expect no help from them after that. 

&nbsp;

She returned to the bedroom, threw the underwear in a pile
on the bed and turned to leave. Reaching the door she reminded herself that she
needed money very badly if she was to stay in college, and that no matter what
else happened she might as well walk away from this job with something to show
for it. She walked back over to the bed and examined the lingerie, noting that
it must�ve cost a fortune. She began to undress, deciding at last that it was
worth it, if only for this one event. 

&nbsp;

Jodi finished dressing and sat alone on the bed in her
humiliating new outfit for over an hour, waiting for the house to fill with the
party guests. She felt naked� naked and dirty, hoping against hope that the
guest list didn�t include anyone she knew. There was a nightstand next to the
bed; she passed the time looking through the drawers. In one of them she found
an expensive-looking locket, obviously an antique and with a beautiful chain.
She stashed it in her purse impulsively, assuring herself that Sylvia owed her
at least that much for having put her through this whole grotesque
embarrassment. The locket fell to the bottom of the purse where it clinked
innocently with her car keys; she saw a faint glimmer of gold and snapped the
purse shut. 

&nbsp;

Presently the guests arrived one by one; she waited until
there were a fair number of ladies present and they were all seated before
coming out to work. Taking a deep breath, Jodi strode through the swinging doors
and out into the roomful of women, wearing only what she�d been given: black
heels, stockings, a revealing bra and black silk panties. She almost looked
down to check her bra and suddenly thought the better of it; it didn�t cover
her nipples anyway. The guests paused their
conversations and looked her over approvingly, smiling at each other. They were
extremely well-heeled; the room smelled of expensive perfume and clothes. She
walked through the room to the kitchen, keeping her eyes fixed on the doorway
to that room and intent on doing a job satisfactory enough to demand money from
Sylvia later. The rich women quietly watched her strut through the room, each
of them smiling to each other as she went by.�


&nbsp;

Jodi dutifully carried her tray of drinks to the first
table and tried to be as businesslike as she could under the circumstances. The
rest of the wait staff giggled and nudged each other; she felt her face grow
flush from embarrassment, though they knew that this was an exclusive party
indeed and they quickly went back to their jobs. Jodi hastily made her way to
the first table near the wall, anxious to get out of the middle of the room.
She felt eyes on her as she did, and heard whispers as she passed by. She
couldn�t even imagine what they must�ve been saying. 

&nbsp;

The first lady at the table put her hand on top of hers
reassuringly. �I know how it must be for you, sweetheart,� she said, reaching
in her expensive purse and sliding a bill under Jodi�s with her other hand.
�But you look beautiful.� Jodi picked up the bill with a stray napkin and
hastily put it on top of the drink tray, noticing out of the corner of her eye
that it was a hundred. The older woman smiled warmly up at her. �I�ll have a
tonic, honey.� With that, the woman simply returned to her conversation. 

&nbsp;

Jodi noted the woman�s drink order on a pad and moved
around the table, quietly asking the ladies whose glasses were less than
half-full if they�d like another. Some did and some didn�t; when Jodi had
completed the table she headed for the safety of the kitchen to get their
drinks. She resolved to keep her mind on that hundred-dollar bill and off of
everything else. 

&nbsp;

The first real incident came about half an hour later, as
she was setting down a drink for one woman and another pulled down her
underwear from behind� all the way to her knees, giving the table a perfect
show. Jodi set her tray down and hastily pulled them back up, flush with
embarrassment. The woman grabbed her wrist as she did, pulling her close.
�Leave them off. From now on.� came the admonishment,
in the same tone Sylvia used on her earlier. Jodi didn�t know what to do, but
continued pulling her panties up. The woman grabbed them by the back and yanked
down hard, ripping them out of her hands, tearing the waistband as she did. The
panties, now ruined, wouldn�t have stayed up now anyway. The rest of the ladies
at the table looked on in innocent amusement, smiling secretly at each other as
this little contest of wills played out. 

&nbsp;

�Give them to me.� The woman glared at her as Jodi was
forced to make her choice. She could either run away screaming out the door,
attack this woman� or simply surrender her panties and face a whole evening of
bare-assed cocktail service in front of all the other women. The idea that this
humiliation might be just part of the show was not lost on her; she looked
around the room and was suddenly aware that the entire assembled party had gone
nearly silent, expectantly waiting to see what would happen next over at table
number four. Suddenly Jodi felt very dirty, worse than if she were at a bachelor party in front of a bunch of drunken,
leering men. However, the money she made from Sylvia�s little gigs was
irresistible, so she made her decision� her face burning with shame as she
stepped gingerly out of the panties, picked them up with the toe of her shoe
and handed them over to the woman. Victorious, the woman simply stuffed them
casually into her purse, looked triumphantly around the table, then innocently
resumed eating her chef�s salad while Jodi stood there fuming. The other women
in the room drew in a breath as she pulled her panties off, watching each other
expectantly to see if it were suitable to applaud, then
abruptly returned to their own meals. The whole spectacle had been a big joke
on her, but if it wasn�t her standing there it would be some other college
hussy who�d walk out of there with a wad of hundred dollar bills. Her hundred dollar bills. 

&nbsp;

Jodi spent the rest of the evening in abject humiliation,
working the tables as before sans underwear, well aware that she was being
watched from all angles. The women watched their nude servant appreciatively,
savoring her the same way they did their beef Wellington and Cristal. At least
the tips went up after that; each time she brought a new drink she was
handsomely rewarded with a hundred-dollar bill, a fifty or at least a twenty.
She stuffed the bills in her purse, which at one point in the evening she�d
moved from the bedroom and stashed in a kitchen drawer, on each return trip
watching the stash grow each time she returned with more bills. The gold locket
winked at her each time she returned; eventually she got so busy working that
she failed to notice on her last trip that it was gone. 

&nbsp;

Returning to the kitchen for drinks turned out to be the worst
part, exposed that way in front of the staff. If Jodi had been a regular drink
waitress, she�d have made it a point to meet them all and find out where the
party would be afterward. In this peculiar situation, the staff hushed their
conversations each time she returned; she could only imagine what they were
saying about her, the house �entertainment� for a group of spoiled wives.
Possibly the same things she was thinking about herself. 

&nbsp;

Other than being stripped naked and humiliated in front of
fifty aristocratic, spoiled doctors� wives, Jodi really hadn�t been expected to
do much else. The bulk of the cocktails were brought regularly by other staff
members specifically working that job, the water and other beverages were
filled by a �real� wait-staff girl (who, working for the caterer�s, had much
more to wear than Jodi). Jodi continued to circulate through the room, anxious
to stay away from that one woman but afraid to avoid her table entirely for
fear of drawing further abuse from the others at that table. After that one
incident, however, they were as genteel to her as ever, tipping her after each
round with exaggerated generosity. 

&nbsp;

Eventually the party wound down and the women left,
bidding each other goodbye with faux European two-cheek kisses and paying no
other attention to her. Jodi stood by awkwardly with her drink tray and
patiently waited for them to depart, ready to put her clothes on and get out of
there. 

&nbsp;

The last guest left and Sylvia shut the door, turning on
her. Her enduring expression of kindness, reserved for the guests, melted away;
she was dealing with the same Sylvia who�d slapped her now. �There is just one
more thing, sweetheart: I know all about the locket. And now you�re going to be
punished for stealing it.� With that she stepped forwarded and seized Jodi�s
wrist, gripping it tightly as she dragged her out of the room.

&nbsp;

Jodi�s heart leaped to her throat.

&nbsp;

Sylvia took her by one wrist and grabbed her ponytail by
the other, as she marched her briskly out of the foyer, past the stunned wait
staff in the living room. Instead of being led to kitchen to call and wait for
the police as Jodi expected, Sylvia instead steered her toward the basement
stairs. Too late, Jodi tried to grab hold of the doorframe on the way down but
Sylvia was just too strong for her. The doctor�s wife just dragged her down the
basement stairs like a rag doll, into the darkness without saying a word. For a
rich bitch she was remarkably strong. 

&nbsp;

Sylvia marched Jodi over to the corner of the basement; Jodi
felt the carpet under her feet give way to hard concrete. Her eyes began to
adjust to the light and she saw huge water heaters and a tentacled
metal cube that was probably the furnace. Finally Sylvia put her hands on the
girl�s shoulders and forced Jodi to her knees, saying only: �Hands.� Jodi
looked up quizzically at her, having no idea what she meant; her mind raced.
Her heart pounded; her adrenalin-charged muscles quivered. 

&nbsp;

Seemingly out of nowhere, another figure emerged from the
darkness; Jodi recognized the woman from the party who had pulled down her
underwear. She sauntered up and stood before Jodi, then leaned over and took Jodi
by her chin. �So, it�s a little thief, is it?� she asked, staring mercilessly
into Jodi�s eyes. �I think with a locket that valuable, it�s surely a felony�
isn�t that right Sylvia?� she asked casually, smiling a little up at Sylvia, in
a very condescending tone as if speaking to a child. 

&nbsp;

Jodi tried as hard as she could to get up, but Sylvia
snatched a handful of her hair from the back, pulling down hard enough to take
the fight right out of her. Jodi tried as hard as she could to get away,
throwing herself to the left or right, but each time one or the other woman was
able to corral her and put her back down. 

&nbsp;

In the end they overcame her easily, working together with
one woman forcing her down by a handful of her hair, the other pressing down on
her shoulders. Sylvia jerked Jodi�s head up, the other woman commanding her
simply to �Open.� Jodi fought for another minute, then finally relented and
opened her mouth; the woman stuffed her cheeks with a wad of cloth, pressing in
with her hand. Jodi felt herself nearly choke as those long, manicured
fingernails jammed the cloth deep into her mouth. Had the light been on she
might have recognized exactly what was going in her mouth. �Bite,� the other
woman said, and Jodi did. �Hands,� Sylvia commanded sternly, lifting Jodi�s
wrists up and flattening her palms out for her, posing the girl as if she were
holding an invisible serving tray. 

&nbsp;

Sylvia let go of her wrists and took out a long strip of
cloth� which must have recently been removed from one of the straps from the
cooks� aprons� and doubled it over both of her fists. She pulled the strip
between Jodi�s teeth and wrapped it once around her head, pulling it tight and
cramming the cloth into her mouth. Her strong hands held it there secure,
pulling hard like the reins on a horse and forcing Jodi�s head back. Jodi
fought back the urge to choke, biting down hard on the strap and pushing her
tongue up against the wad of cloth packing her mouth. She looked up at Sylvia,
her eyes wide and sparkling, then down her nose at the other woman. 

&nbsp;

Jodi did as she was told and kept her hands up obediently,
watching with horror as the other woman pulled out a long, flexible wand of
some kind and whickered it through the air� obviously practicing, warming up
before doing something to Jodi with it that was sure to be very painful indeed.
Jodi�s heart pounded; she�d never faced anything like this before. It seemed
surreal, like a bad dream. Jodi had never been put through any type of corporal
punishment in her life, and here she was� kneeling on Sylvia�s cold basement
floor, about to receive what was surely going to be a very painful punishment. 

&nbsp;

�The woman finished
a few practice strokes with the wand through the air, then put her finger over
the other end of it and slowly bowed the wand that way between her hands. She
looked down at Jodi menacingly. �That locket was Sylvia�s grandmother�s. You�re
about to get a lesson in respect for other peoples� property. You can either
hold out your palms for twenty strokes�� she said, waving the wand. �Or we can
summon the police, whom I�m sure would be interested to learn about your little
�activities� here in this house. Isn�t that right, Sylvia?� The women paused,
obviously waiting for some response from Jodi. She kept her hands up,
indicating that she would submit to the beating� also knowing that women as
rich as these surely had connections with the police as it was. Her eyes darted
from Sylvia to the other woman, nervously aware that cops aside, having her
palms beaten with that little wand was going to be very unpleasant. 

&nbsp;

Finally, the woman reached in her pocket and pulled out
the locket, its golden chain sparkling in the dim light as she briefly dangled
it before Jodi�s eyes, after which she fastened it carefully around Jodi�s
neck. They made her sit that way for a few minutes, gagged and perched with her
waiting palms outstretched, as the woman before her prepared to deliver the
beating.

&nbsp;

There in the basement, with the dim light of the outdoor
security light streaming in the window, Jodi received twenty strokes across her
palms, just as Sylvia had promised, from that thin little switch. The wand
whickered viciously through the air, coming down on her soft palms over and
over again, followed each time by a muffled scream from Jodi. Whatever the wand
was made of burned like fire coming down on her hands, worse with each stroke,
as the woman delivering her pain stepped gracefully around her, whipping it
expertly up and down on the girl�s outstretched palms. She raised welt after
welt across her hands, patiently waiting for her to recover and lift them back
up before coming down with the next stroke. She seemed to know exactly when to
hit her, catching her off-guard every time. Sylvia stood behind her all the
while, pulling down hard on the strip of cloth in her mouth, holding Jodi�s
head back and pinning her legs together between her feet. 

&nbsp;

The whipping seemed to go on and on, her muffled cries
growing louder toward the end. The walls echoed the last few strokes as she
screamed out, trying desperately to keep her hands up for the strokes. Finally
she reached twenty and they released her. Realizing it was over she put her
head down and cried softly to herself, slowly drawing her beaten palms into her
chest as she did. The loose apron strap dangled from her neck; she kept the
cloth in her mouth, afraid to spit it out yet. She sat that way for a few
minutes, the locket swinging from her neck as she sobbed, while the women stood
over her and exchanged satisfied glances with each other. 

&nbsp;

After a short time the women each took her up by an arm
and abruptly stood her up. They walked her that way to the side door of the basement,
which was beautifully finished on the other side of the stairs. Unceremoniously
they marched her out the side door into the night, giving her a final push out
into the side lawn. She nearly stumbled, trying to get her footing in the soft
grass in her high heels. Sylvia tossed Jodi�s purse at her, which fell in the
wet grass. Still wearing only her stockings and bra, she turned without a word
and made her way to her car out front, gingerly picking up her purse with her
fingertips as she was unable to grasp anything in her hands� nor would she be
able to for quite some time. She realized in her daze that she still held the
wad of cloth in her mouth, but dared not spit it out on the lawn, fearful of
what the penalty might be around there for littering. 

&nbsp;

Sylvia, obviously not having forgotten the earlier
confrontation, called over her shoulder as she made her way up the side yard to
the driveway, �Next time, you�ll be wearing even less.�� 

&nbsp;

Jodi broke into a run as she hurried down the deserted
driveway and along the sidewalk to her car, her tall heels clicking on the
pavement as she went. She fumbled her keys out of her purse and unwound the
loose apron strap from around her head, spitting the rag out on the front seat
as soon as she had the door open. When the dome light came on, she realized
with horror that the cloth had been the black silk panties in her mouth all
along, the same panties that had been stripped from her earlier in the evening.


&nbsp;

She got in the car, put on her seatbelt and dumped her purse
out on the passenger seat; all told, she�d cleared almost six thousand dollars
for that little gig. Looking up, Jodi caught sight of her reflection in the
rear view mirror; the little gold locket still hung from her neck; apparently,
it was just another gift from Sylvia at this point... what once was stolen now
paid for in full. She made a note to herself to fling it out the window when
she got far enough away from the house. She left the money there in a pile,
crying hysterically for a few minutes. Once her tears had stopped coming she
started her car, put it in gear and steered for her apartment� driving
gingerly, using only her fingertips and the sides of her beaten hands� swearing
to herself that she�d never see these people again. 

&nbsp;

However, she knew full well she�d be back, which was
possibly the most upsetting thing of all.
