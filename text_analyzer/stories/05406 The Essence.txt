The Essence

By Darqside

&nbsp;

It�s been at least ten years since the incident we
experienced.� Back then we were young, in
love, and completely infatuated with the idea of having sex.

&nbsp;

Sexual gratification was indeed the very core reason why we
even met each other in the first place.

&nbsp;

She was once a student at Yale University,
in fact she even taught there for a time, her major being Psychology with a
minor in World History.� At the time I
was working as an archeologist for a local religious scientific group.� We didn�t know who our benefactor was, but
our goal was clear:

&nbsp;

To determine the truth behind statements found in the Bible
and other ancient pieces of text.

&nbsp;

Needless to say I ended up working with her, seeing as her
knowledge of Sumerian text was invaluable.

&nbsp;

We were currently on assignment in the northern mountains of
old Mesopotamia, when I uncovered an ancient
block of text that seemed to be embedded in a shell of old volcanic rock.

&nbsp;

After cleaning it up a bit and some deciphering�she gave out
a rather excited cry.

&nbsp;

�This is it!�

&nbsp;

�Considering I can�t read Sumerian, do you mind
elaborating?�

&nbsp;

�Oh, of course!� You
see�this is a fragment of the Torah, basically the Bible�s equivalent of the
Old Testament�only�.there�s something a bit different than what I�m used to
reading��

&nbsp;

Instantly she ran back to her notations while I began to dig
again.

&nbsp;

�Well that doesn�t make sense��

&nbsp;

�What are you going on about?� I asked, somewhat distracted
by the current project at hand.� I hadn�t
noticed at the time, but her voice sounded extremely attractive to me, and she
was no slouch when it came to appearances either, but her intelligence somewhat
directed me to keep it professional.

&nbsp;

�This piece of text seems to be talking about a chapter in
Genesis�but I don�t think it�s a chapter any of us has ever read before.�

&nbsp;

�What are you saying?� I�ve read that book in the Bible from
start to finish, but to think that something might have been left out might
seem sacrilegious to some.

&nbsp;

�This chapter�the pattern of writing and formality match the
context�if I was to match it up with any of the chapters, I�d say it would fit
between Chapter 2 and 3�a hidden chapter as it were.�

&nbsp;

She feverishly began to study her notes and translate the text;
she would mumble things incoherently whenever she found something that
intrigued her.� I didn�t want to disturb
her, but it was getting late in the afternoon, and the sun would be going down
soon.

&nbsp;

�Listen�it�s getting late, I�m heading back to camp�.are you
going to stay here tonight?�

&nbsp;

She jumped up�almost alarmed at the thought of her nose
stuck in a book.

&nbsp;

�Oh, I�m sorry!� I do
so love finding and solving a good mystery, but I suppose it can wait until
tomorrow.�

&nbsp;

She began to nervously twirl a curl in her long blonde hair,
it shined a deep gold in the sunset, and at that moment I couldn�t help but
find her immensely attractive.

&nbsp;

�Hello?� I said I�d be
down in a minute�I�ll gather my notes��

&nbsp;

�Oh!� Um�yeah, okay,
I�ll wait at the foot of the hill for you.�

&nbsp;

I couldn�t believe I spaced out on her like that!� I think I must�ve been beet red after that,
and so I tried to avoid looking directly at her for the rest of the evening.

&nbsp;

That night I stoked the fire, mainly because I have a
problem with insomnia and needed something to do.

&nbsp;

It completely caught me off guard when she suddenly appeared
behind me.

&nbsp;

�Whoa!� Didn�t mean to
scare you there��

&nbsp;

�It�s�it�s alright, I�m just not used to seeing other people
up this late��

&nbsp;

�You mean, besides yourself?� she had a slight giggle in her
voice.

&nbsp;

�I guess so��

&nbsp;

�Sleep apnea, isn�t it?� She said almost smiling.

&nbsp;

�Huh?� How did you
know that?� I was rather surprised she could tell that just by looking at me.

&nbsp;

�I�m a Psychologist, part of our job is determining more
than just mental, but physical reasons for behavior.� You can�t breathe properly when you sleep,
and so you don�t get proper R.E.M. Sleep.�
Am I right?�

&nbsp;

�Well�yeah�but how can you tell that just by looking at me?�

&nbsp;

�It�s not that I just �look at you� you know�I heard your
irregular snoring in the tent last night�kept me up as well.�

&nbsp;

��Err�sorry about that�� By now I was very embarrassed.

&nbsp;

�By the way�I didn�t catch your name when we started this
research expedition?�

&nbsp;

�Adam Abrams�just call me Adam��

&nbsp;

�My name is Eva Saran�.Adam and Eva huh�kind of ironic don�t
you think?�

&nbsp;

�Heh, I suppose it is.�

&nbsp;

Strangely enough, she was very interested in me, although I
don�t recall giving any major hints that I was attracted to her.� I sincerely hoped it wasn�t my sleeping
habits.

&nbsp;

�So�Adam, I noticed you seem to take a shine to my hair�do
you like it?�

&nbsp;

�W-what?!� It was amazing�almost like she read my mind�

&nbsp;

�Well, it was pretty obvious you were staring at me blankly
this afternoon�well�I suppose I�m not bothered by it�not many men have given me
attention much anyway.�

&nbsp;

�I�m sorry if I offended you, Eva�I�I didn�t mean to��

&nbsp;

�So answer the question�do you like me or not?� she looked
at me, dead serious.

&nbsp;

�Well I�I suppose I do but��

&nbsp;

�But what?� Why so
nervous?�� Again, Eva was seriously
asking me�it was hard for me to handle.

&nbsp;

�But I always thought women preferred to do things
professionally�I mean�I don�t want sexual harassment if you know what I mean��

&nbsp;

�Oh you can hardly call it that�you never laid a finger on
me�but as for me��

&nbsp;

She quietly sat down on a log next to me, and slowly and
gently kissed my cheek�jolting me for a moment.

&nbsp;

�You�re sweet Adam�a trait I�ve never found in other
men.� You�re respectful, you�re kind, and
you�re not aggressive either.�

&nbsp;

I don�t know why it came out�maybe it was because she was
very forward with me that night�maybe it was because I wanted her to know I
really liked her.� I�m not sure.

&nbsp;

�You know�I think you�d look really beautiful in a latex
dress.�

&nbsp;

Before I knew what I had said, I covered my mouth in
shock�and quickly apologized.

&nbsp;

�Wow�I�m impressed��

&nbsp;

�Say what?� Now it was her turn to shock me.

&nbsp;

�You�re very honest and direct.� I like that in a man.� She giggled again.

&nbsp;

�I�didn�t mean to be so�� I stammered�I couldn�t think of
what to say short of wanting to have sex with her right there, out in the
wilderness.

&nbsp;

�I suppose it�s my fault�my mother always told me I was in a
hurry to do things.� And I suppose I
triggered your Libido as well�oh dear��

&nbsp;

The lump in my crotch was swelling, but try as I might, I
couldn�t stifle it.

&nbsp;

�Maybe I came onto you a little fast��

&nbsp;

�No�no, it�s alright�I mean�I like you too.�

&nbsp;

�Listen to us�apologizing back and forth like mocking
birds�� with that she laughed softly�and this seemed like music to my ears.

&nbsp;

�Well, instead of apologizing, I think I should just admit
how I feel about you�� I couldn�t believe what I was saying to her�and this was
literally the first time we�d introduced each other!

&nbsp;

�Adam�do you believe in love at first sight?� She asked
abruptly.

&nbsp;

�I�ve heard in the Bible that Adam fell in love with Eve the
minute he saw her��

&nbsp;

�I�take a rather analytical approach to love�but not just
love�sex.�

&nbsp;

She was admitting to me her deepest thoughts�and I�ll admit,
at the time I was a little scared.

&nbsp;

�I�ve always wondered what purpose, aside from land
contracts and other aspects�that Marriage holds�I mean the origin of man and
woman.� It�s been on my mind the day I
first heard my description �womb-man�.� I
mean�a lot of women complain about the idea of having children being a burden,
and the idea of being a sex object for men�but I�ve always thought the
opposite�you know?�

&nbsp;

�I�m not sure I follow you.�

&nbsp;

�It starts off with the idea that men and women desire each
other, you know�like we feel incomplete.�
But men are always depicted as domineering and women as being passive
and used for coitus.� But I wonder if
this isn�t just natural�I mean�I�ve got a hole and that hole needs to be
filled�.by something.�

&nbsp;

�I suppose it has to do with the idea that humans by nature
don�t like being forced into what they deem to be as stereotypical�which is
silly in my opinion.�

&nbsp;

�You really think so?�

&nbsp;

�It�s like the old saying�if you�ve got legs to walk�you
might as well use them�why fight that aspect of yourself.�

&nbsp;

She laughed, �A lot of homosexuals would defiantly disagree
with you on that point�.but that�s another thing�even homosexuals and bisexuals
need that fulfillment�it really is a mystery.�

&nbsp;

�Wow, you really are interested in sex�er�that came out
wrong.�

&nbsp;

She laughed, and then I laughed for some reason.

&nbsp;

�I suppose I should be very up front with you�now that we�re
�sexually and emotionally initiated��I�m straight as an arrow, although I�m
willing to experiment in different styles of sex�also, I prefer natural sex
over condoms�finally, I am a clean virgin.�

&nbsp;

�You prefer �morning-after� pills?� I asked, curious.

&nbsp;

�Well, if you�re asking me my moral stance on them�I see it
this way:� Chickens lay eggs all the time
and nobody complains about cooking and eating them�except maybe vegans�aside
from that though�actually I�m impotent.�

&nbsp;

�So�you can�t have children?�

&nbsp;

�Yes�I know; I�m an embarrassment to my ancestor Eve�big
deal.� As far as I�m concerned, it�s a
blessing�as I don�t really want kids anyway.�

&nbsp;

�I�m�not concerned about that either�� It felt like a completely
natural conversation, actually, at least until she shocked me again.

&nbsp;

�As for your statement earlier about me in latex�well�to
what extent are you referring to?� Don�t
be shy now�and don�t worry, I won�t psychoanalyze you or say you�re weird or
anything�I promise.� She smiled a very wicked smile�but it seemed comforting to
me.

&nbsp;

�Well�� I fidgeted for a moment�until she kissed me on the
cheek again, which turned away all feelings of doubt.

&nbsp;

�I guess you could say I�m into latex as a form of fashion,
I�m not into getting whipped or bondage, really, no piercing either�I just find
wearing it�especially women wearing it�to be sexy.�

&nbsp;

�Well I suppose I wouldn�t mind�if you had something in mind
that is��

&nbsp;

About then I began to have very deliciously dark thoughts of
her being my dress-up doll�I don�t know why, but it just became something of an
obsessive thought to me.

&nbsp;

�Well I�ve always had this thing for 17th century
hoop skirts and bridal gowns�but, the thing is�I�ve always wondered what it
would be like for an attractive woman to wear latex versions of them.�

&nbsp;

�A latex bridal gown?�

&nbsp;

�Something like that�yeah�black, or white, doesn�t matter��

&nbsp;

�Adam, you are a very intriguing man�I�ll have to think
about this for some time��

&nbsp;

It was strange, but I felt even more impulsive with her
around.� Instinctively I grabbed her hand
in mine.

&nbsp;

�Wow�sunrise, already?� I suddenly asked.

&nbsp;

�Not a very romantic statement�but true none the less�� she
smiled.� I was getting addicted to that
smile.

&nbsp;

�Adam�are you tired?�

&nbsp;

�Not really��

&nbsp;

�Neither am I�let�s go back to that dig site�I have a
feeling we�re going to find something interesting there today related to our
conversation.�

&nbsp;

�About sex?� I asked, aghast.

&nbsp;

�Precisely�I didn�t tell you this, but I think I may have
found a lost key to the origin of angelic beings!�

&nbsp;

�Angels?! The origin of angels?�

&nbsp;

It was strange, all the talking we had just done and we
weren�t even tired�we practically ran full-sprint back to the dig site.

&nbsp;

She scattered her translated notes�filling in the holes she
had began in her notation the previous day.

&nbsp;

�Okay�let me read what I�ve found so far��

&nbsp;

�And before mankind was created, God created Nehalem, those
that are called Angels�neither male nor female created he them, but both�for
they are one and the same flesh�born of the orb of union that speaketh through
the mouth of life.� They are the
predecessor to Adam and Eve but are also called man but are also gods below
God.�

&nbsp;

�Wow�that�s amazing�but what does it mean��

&nbsp;

�Angels are born from some kind of object that unites�I�m
not sure what that�s referring to.�

&nbsp;

�Let me read more��

&nbsp;

�God wished for man and woman to populate the Earth and
dwell upon it as a countless number.�
After man�s fall away from God�man and woman could no longer satisfy
themselves and instead chose to use the Orb of Union.�

&nbsp;

�Because this went against God�s command to procreate the
Earth, God hid the orb so that no Nehalem could be born.�

&nbsp;

�Anything else in that piece of text?� I asked, dusting off
more rocks in the ruins.

&nbsp;

�That�s all there is to it�and I can�t find any other
fragments either��

&nbsp;

As I was dusting away a large layer of strata I couldn�t
help but notice the ground beneath me was rather soft compared to the rocky
terrain I had been used to treading for the past few days.� Curious, I decided to use a bore to see how
deep the soft rock went.

&nbsp;

�Find something?�

&nbsp;

Again she surprised me by leaning over and kissing my cheek
again.� Startled, I dropped the bore�but
when it hit the ground�the earth began to crumble away.

&nbsp;

�Get back�it�s a land-slide!� I yelled�but before my own
body could react, I slid down a large crack in the earth along with dust and
debris.

&nbsp;

�Adam!� Adam!� Where are you?�

&nbsp;

I was crawling around in the dark when I heard her voice
echo above.

&nbsp;

�I�m down here!�

&nbsp;

�I�m sorry Adam�if I hadn�t have startled you�you wouldn�t
be in this predicament�I�ll see if I can find a way down there to you!�

&nbsp;

�Eva, be careful, the rock formations are unstable!�

&nbsp;

Before I finished warning her, almost as if it were fate,
she slide down the hole with me�I could see her silhouette in the shadow of the
crack of light above.

&nbsp;

�I�m such a klutz!�
Now how do we get out of here?�

&nbsp;

Almost as if it were pure luck, I had found a torch on a
wall nearby�perhaps I should�ve never lit it�but�I guess it�s too late for
regrets.

&nbsp;

�What�is this place?��
She gasped in shock.

&nbsp;

As the light filled the room of ancient Sumerian stonework�I
couldn�t help but realize that we had just come upon the discovery of the
century!� A thousands year old Sumerian
tomb it seemed.

&nbsp;

�The text is all written on the walls�amazing�it�s a
combination language of Sumerian and Egyptian!��
She was immediately enamored with this find.

&nbsp;

�Well the architecture is Egyptian, but what does it say��

&nbsp;

It was strange, because the room itself did not even look
like a tomb�more like a storage area�the walls were lined with text, but no
coffins, not even pottery were found here.

&nbsp;

�The antechamber of the forbidden mouth of God�� she read
aloud�

&nbsp;

�You serious?� I asked, taking in all the text�

&nbsp;

�This can�t be related to that piece of text we saw
earlier�could it?�

&nbsp;

Of course she was on to something, but what it might be, we
were far from capable of understanding.

&nbsp;

�If this is the antechamber�then the path is��

&nbsp;

She grabbed the torch from its stand and began to read more
of the text.

&nbsp;

�Adam�help me out�there are 6 bricks here that are loose in
the wall�like something is blocked up in it.�

&nbsp;

�Okay�� using the bore that had fallen down with me, I dug
at the bricks, which were heavily set into the face of the wall.

&nbsp;

When the wall finally gave way�a single little holding
chamber was revealed�and within the chamber was a round black object.

&nbsp;

�What is this I wonder?� I pulled the object out of its
container.� It was black and shined like
obsidian, but was as big around as a bowling ball.� As I held it in my hands it felt light to
carry�but solid like a round ball of rubber.

&nbsp;

�That can�t be�!� Her eyes widened in shock.

&nbsp;

�You mean this is�the orb of union?� I asked.

&nbsp;

�There�s�there�s no way��

&nbsp;

She shone light from her torch upon the orb and it silently
reflected back the flame from the torch.

&nbsp;

�Do you want to see it?� I asked, �It�s pretty light��

&nbsp;

After putting the torch back in the holder so that we could
examine the object, I carefully gave it to her, so as not to drop it.

&nbsp;

The minute it came into contact with her hand, however,
something devilishly dark began to happen�the orb began to melt away in her
hand.

&nbsp;

�What�s�what�s going on?� She asked, worried.

&nbsp;

The orb began to melt around her hands and actually looked
like a second skin.

&nbsp;

�What�s happening!!� Her voice was suddenly filled with
terror.

&nbsp;

I tried to take the melted portions off her hands, but they
remained like a sort of glue.� I couldn�t
even find purchase for my hands to get a proper grip.

&nbsp;

�It�s covering my arms!!� she shrieked.

&nbsp;

And as though it were a living creature, it began to slowly
creep up her arms, and shoulders, as though her body were slowly becoming
laminated.� It melted around her breasts
in such a way as to make them stick out larger and further away from her body
than even possible!

&nbsp;

�Why won�t this stuff get off me!� She started to cry.

&nbsp;

As the black ooze began to slither down her waist, it then
almost intuitively pierced her crotch�and she it the floor and doubled
over�.moaning.

&nbsp;

Between moans, I was barely able to make out that it had
invaded her most private parts�front and rear.

&nbsp;

I held her hand back up as she continued to grit her teeth
as the ooze proceeded through her backside, so much so, there was no longer any
seam to her buttocks�her butt now looked like a round bulbous orb shining the
reflection of the flickering torch in the darkness.

&nbsp;

As it crept down her legs, she could feel her thighs
solidifying in a sort of lock-knee stance, forcing her to arch her back to
maintain balance�which of course locked her spine into place like some dark
corset�when it reached her feet.� It ate
away at her excavation boots like a diabolical acid�.turning her feet into 6
inch seamless high boot heels.

&nbsp;

I couldn�t help but feel intensely attracted to her, even in
this sad series of events.� But almost as
though it were reading my thoughts�it had saved the best for last�

&nbsp;

In my demented mind, I observed her helplessly clawing at
the black ooze as it began to trickle upwards around her throat, solidifying
tightly so that she could barely turn her head�and in an instant it flooded her
mouth and throat�forcing her to gag for a brief moment, continuing up her nose
so that her nasal passages were blocked, yet somehow she was able to breathe�.then
the solid black latex that filled her mouth and throat morphed into a perfect
casing for her black shiny lips�but try as she might�she could not open them
and muffled in protest.

&nbsp;

Slowly but surely, as her muffled screams continued�it
slithered up and through her eye sockets and around her eyes�making her muffled
screams reach a peak�the screams stopped shortly thereafter and afterwards I
saw only black orbs staring back at me, helplessly.

&nbsp;

It slithered through her ears up to the point that they were
no longer visible, although strangely she was able to hear me�it continued onto
her scalp and up through each strand of her hair and follicles�her hair
literally began to grow to a very long attractive length as a result�black
shiny hair that went down to her buttocks.

&nbsp;

I was both over stimulated and astounded.

&nbsp;

�Can you�can you see me right now�?�

&nbsp;

She tried to muffle a response, but decided to nod �yes�
instead.

&nbsp;

�The black orb seems to have created a symbiotic reaction in
you�and for some reason has formed into something akin to what I had pictured
you as�� I tried to come up with a logical explanation�

&nbsp;

But almost impulsively, I thought that it wasn�t quite what
I had in mind.

&nbsp;

Instantly several tendrils snaked out around her waist at
her sides and formed a tremendously long seamless hoopskirt�as though in sync
with my thoughts.� The perfect woman of
solid black.

&nbsp;

�This is kind of bothersome that I can�t talk to you
normally�� I muttered.

&nbsp;

And just like before, the substance reacted�albeit not in
the way I expected.

&nbsp;

Her lips were still sealed shut�but as she mumbled, I heard
her voice drifting�as though her voice box were being moved from the throat to
somewhere else�

&nbsp;

�I don�t�understand��

&nbsp;

�Huh?�

&nbsp;

It was stunning, her Vulva had reformed itself outside of
the dress at the pelvis, but what occurred next was even more surprising�it
took the form of two sideways lips�just like the rubbery lips on her face
above.

&nbsp;

�Why is this�happening��

&nbsp;

Her voice sounded weak, as though it had been dissolved and
reformed and that she had to learn how to speak all over again.

&nbsp;

I crouched down to make sure I wasn�t seeing things�

&nbsp;

�This is�this is insanity�� Her vulva spoke!

&nbsp;

Almost in disbelief I stood up and touched her face with my
hands�there were no seams to her lips!�
Like some sort of rubber mask.

&nbsp;

�I can�t believe this!�
I�m talking through my vagina!�
What the hell is wrong with me!�
I�m a freak!�� I heard the voice
cry out below.

&nbsp;

She put her hands on her face, and I could tell she was
crying.� I put my hand to her face to
wipe the tears away�but as I noticed�the tears were black liquid, and smelled
of rubber.

&nbsp;

Her face re-absorbed the tears like some kind of symbiotic
sponge.� It was as though she hadn�t even
cried at all.

&nbsp;

�I�I don�t know what�s going on here�� I said to her. ��It�s�it�s as though the orb is reading my
mind and using my thoughts and imagination and making them reality through your
body.� I guess�I couldn�t help myself�I
mean, picturing a woman talking through a vagina is pretty twisted I guess�but
it was what I wanted��

&nbsp;

�It was�what you wanted, Adam?� she asked.� Her voice already seemed to have gotten
accustomed to speaking down there.

&nbsp;

�I just wish I understood what was going on with you and the
orb�I wish I knew��

&nbsp;

And as if to answer my question�and strangely enough this
was also equally attractive�her body began to morph once again.

&nbsp;

Four lumps appeared underneath her arms which slowly
slithered outward and formed arms and hands, identical to her own�and she
seemed to have motor control of them like some kind of woman spider.

&nbsp;

Then at the apex of her forehead, a third eye appeared,
identical to the black orbs of her own eyes.�
And then, to my astonishment, two pairs of lips appeared at the tips of
her breasts.

&nbsp;

�What�s going on!?�
What are you thinking!?�

&nbsp;

�I didn�t think this, Eva!�
I just wanted to know what�s going on!�

&nbsp;

Suddenly, with exception to her talking �lips� she lost
control of her body.� The three eyes on
her face focused on me�and the 6 hands took various positions and stances�like
some sort of Latex Shiva goddess.

&nbsp;

Her breasts began to speak to me, and apparently to Eva as
well.� The voices that came from her
breasts were in unison, as though a god were speaking through Eva�s body.

&nbsp;

�Mortal�thy love for this woman has pierced her soul and so
thou hast become one spirit with her.� If
thou wilt, thou may become one flesh.�

&nbsp;

�One�spirit?�

&nbsp;

�This woman is now bone of thy bones and flesh of thy flesh,
and so a man will leave his mother and father and become one flesh with one
woman.� She is the object of thy desire.�

&nbsp;

I hadn�t admitted it, yet, but indeed, she had become
precisely what I desired, and perhaps even beyond my own limited imagination.

&nbsp;

�I�ve�become�something that�he desires�?� Her �lips� spoke.

&nbsp;

�Woman was made as a help made for man, she is so that he
may not be alone.� But thy purpose in
this world was to be fruitful and multiply�if thou hast no means in this�and
the man thou lovest has no purpose in this, you may yet be useful as an avatar
of the Lord.�

&nbsp;

Yet another thing I hadn�t admitted.� I was also impotent�and the idea of having
sex with a woman who might expect kids from me�well that was an
embarrassment.� But if she was the same
as me�perhaps we could still love each other�but this�this was different.

&nbsp;

�Thou dost understand thy purpose now�it is now thy choice��

&nbsp;

And with that�the lips on her breasts, the third eye, and
the arms vanished.

&nbsp;

�Is it just me�or is the torch blowing out�?� I muttered.

&nbsp;

�Adam�why didn�t you tell me�?�

&nbsp;

�Maybe because I didn�t want to admit it myself�maybe
because I�m just like all those other perverted men out there�I lust, I
desire�but now�now we�re on the brink of making an angelic being��

&nbsp;

Black tears came out of her eyes and were once again
absorbed into the shiny abyss of her face.�
But those tears were for me.

&nbsp;

�The truth is Adam�I�ve desired you since the day I first
met you at the University�I kept feeling like I was pathetic for thinking that
way�that other women would think I was pathetic for wanting to become something
I wasn�t just to please a man I fell in love with��

&nbsp;

�But it�s my fault, Eva!�
It�s my fault you�re talking through your Vagina�it�s my fault you�re
encased in Latex from hell.� I even lied
a bit when I said I didn�t care so much for bondage.�

&nbsp;

I needed to sit down�even if it was in the dirt of that dark
dank old tomb.� I needed to think.

&nbsp;

As if to change the subject, she sexily sauntered up to
me�her talking pussy at my eye level.� I
could see her rear end bounding back and forth as she strode toward me.

&nbsp;

�The truth is�I�m just as perverted as you, Adam.� I want sex just as much as any other woman
does.� In fact�to be honest, although it
caught me off guard�I like what I�ve become.�

&nbsp;

To prove her point, she sat down and spread her legs
wide�bending forward like some kind of strange rubber band, she slid both her
forearms all the way up into her pussy.�
Moaning and stretching it further�she even managed to slide her head
inside it�rolling backwards and folding her knees forward, she even managed to
stretch the lip so that her legs fit inside completely as well.� As if to compensate her attempts�my
imagination assisted her�her lips completely enveloped the remainder of her
body in such a way that she now looked like a gigantic black ball with lips.

&nbsp;

�Howth thoth?�
She mumbled with black drooling lips.

&nbsp;

My mouth was agape and my eyes went wide.� She literally was disappearing inside
herself!

&nbsp;

�I better get you out of there before you collapse in on
yourself!� I yelped.

&nbsp;

�Nowwh Powabwem!�
Another mumble.

&nbsp;

She literally melted before my eyes, and like some kind of
liquid shape shifter�became her original�well�mostly original�form.

&nbsp;

�My, but that was fun!� Her �lips� smiled�although they had
no teeth, but of course picturing a pussy with teeth was downright scary for
me.

&nbsp;

�Listen, Adam�you�re the only man for me�and I�ll be
whatever you want me to be.� Just think
it, and I�ll be it.�

&nbsp;

�I have this big fear that if any other women found out
about this�they�d kill me.�

&nbsp;

�Then you don�t understand women very well do you�� She
giggled�although it sounded rather weird coming from her pelvis.

&nbsp;

In a very abrupt fashion, she spread her legs around my
waist, hoopskirt and all�and wrapped her arms around me, with my face facing
her enhanced black rubber breasts.

&nbsp;

�Women are just as scared as men when it comes to
relationships�they don�t want to pick the wrong guy, and they don�t want to get
their feelings hurt either.� The idea
that women don�t like being told what to do or what to be is identical to that
of a man�s desire to live his own life.�
That�s how we all are.� There are
women out there who don�t want to be bound to any man�just like there are men
out there who don�t want to be bound by women.�
But in the end, it doesn�t matter what we want or what we don�t want��

&nbsp;

�Why�s that�?� I said, rather distracted.

&nbsp;

�Because we�re incomplete without each other.� What I want ultimately leads me to a man�and
what a man wants ultimately leads him to a woman.� Even if it�s something we don�t want to
admit, it�s a fact of nature.� It�s why
some women desire to be men and vice versa.�
Because they don�t feel complete otherwise.�

&nbsp;

�So why is there such a big wall of defense against men
nowadays anyway?�

&nbsp;

�Because women out there want to feel like there�s more to
life than sex.� And while that may be
true to humans, it�s common nature for everything else.� To a male and female animal�sex, food, and
water might be everything.� Women cover
their breasts because men find them highly desirable, and a great
compliment.� Men fight over women, even
women who�ve been taken by other men.�
Because we value life, we avoid fighting as much as possible�and so
women get protective of their bodies�even though it�s perfectly natural to be
desirable.� In fact some women think it
best for some men to cover up to prevent the same occurrence from happening.�

&nbsp;

�That�s quite a mouthful�even for a pussy.� I smirked.

&nbsp;

�Oh you!�

&nbsp;

�I guess�for a long time I was afraid of what women
thought�so I stayed away�but I always had a wild imagination, because that�s
all I had to go on.�

&nbsp;

�But now I exist as your imagination!� It�s actually something I�ve always wanted to
do�to be the very best thing for the man I love.�

&nbsp;

�Even if the man you love is somewhat twisted and perverted
and has an infatuation for latex skin?�

&nbsp;

�Whether or not it�s perverted is a misnomer�maybe not
everybody likes it, but I do�isn�t that enough?�� It was strange, but at that moment, I felt
her kiss me on the cheek again�and it felt as though it were her normal lips
this time.

&nbsp;

�Yeah, and I guess that�s all that matters.�

&nbsp;

�So�I suppose God wants us to become one flesh then?�

&nbsp;

�I�m not sure I fully understand it, even though it was
explained to me.�

&nbsp;

She and I stood up as Adam and Eva�no�more like Adam and
Eve�she was now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh�even if that flesh was shiny
black latex.� The flame from the torch
reflected itself in twisted dances around the curvatures of her body.� I could feel the swell fall from my chest to
my crotch.

&nbsp;

Her latex dress swept near me, and she slowly undid my pants
and even took off my shoes and shirt tenderly�even in the darkness of the tomb
we were in�she still had eyes for me�the black orbs staring at me with love.

&nbsp;

I stood before her�bare naked and unashamed.� And even though she was only partially
naked�she stood unashamed as well.� We
loved each other.� Even amongst the dust
and dirt and shadows.� I could not take
my eyes off her seamless rubber obsidian body�and her me, even though it was
natural skin.

&nbsp;

I touched her rubber gloved hands and enveloped them in my
own, slowly drawing her towards me�our hands were brought down and slowly moved
around our wastes, I placed my lips on her rubber face and kissed her.� Her eyes continuing to shed rubber tears that
seemed to drip over onto my face as we kissed.

&nbsp;

Then, I pierced her with all my being.� Her lower lips enveloped my pelvis with
addicted abandon, I could feel her legs snake themselves around me�once,
twice�she had attached herself to my body!

&nbsp;

I did not care�for I wished to swallow her Essence
whole.� I could feel the hard curves of
the heels on her legs as she wrapped her legs up to my hands.� My scrotum and penis disappeared into her
black void, never to return.� Her voice
became watery muffles of glee�as if drinking sweet nectar.� I writhed on a wild black ocean, swaying
amidst the waves of darkness.� My eyes
seemed to close permanently of their own accord, but it was beyond my capacity
to care.� My senses were pleased and that
was all that mattered.

&nbsp;

Her dress began to wrap rubbery black wings around me, her
breasts melting around my body.� I felt
myself begin to disappear and reappear in consciousness.� The last thing I heard was her pleasured
squeal and laughter of delight�..

&nbsp;

When I awoke from slumber, and my eyes got adjusted to the
darkness within I had once slept, I stood up to find that Eva was gone.� The tomb was empty.� And I was alone.

&nbsp;

Or at least, I thought I was�

&nbsp;

In a sudden wave of nausea, I hit my knees only to find that
my body had been encased in the same black rubber that she had once been
in.� My clothes lay in a pile near the
entrance to the tomb, and it seemed as though the orb lay on the ground
casually by the entrance having fulfilled its purpose.

&nbsp;

I took a good look at myself in the light of the torch.� It seemed that in the night I had obtained
Eva�s breasts, long hair, dress, curvy body, six inch heels, as well as her
seamless butt plug�in fact it felt as though I had no major orifice at
all�until a familiar voice spoke.� It
spoke inside my mind as though now fused with it.

&nbsp;

�We are now one body and one flesh�we are one love, one
spirit, and one mind.� And we are the
descendant of the Lord.�

&nbsp;

�Eva is that you?�

&nbsp;

In response to my question�a pair of lips appeared at where
my crotch had been, my own personal talking vagina.

&nbsp;

�Adam�I love you, and I will always love for all eternity.�

&nbsp;

�Eva�I will always love you as well�.forever.�

&nbsp;

Walking out to the opening at the top of the tomb, we
stretched our rubbery arms a bit to absorb the light shining down.� Using our will, we created great rubbery
wings and took flight to the sky.� Our
wills would be forever.

&nbsp;

It has been ten years since the events we experienced.� And we have never been happier.� We do not hunger, we do not thirst, we do not
experience pain or sorrow, and we do not need to relieve ourselves.� It has been ten years since we had the urge
to have coitus.� All our needs have been
met.� We ride the clouds forever unto
eternity.� The world is not perfect, but
the Lord has told us that someday it shall be, and that man shall continue
onward.� We shall continue on.

&nbsp;

We are whole.

&nbsp;

We are one.

&nbsp;

The End?
