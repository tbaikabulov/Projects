Martina's Struggle
Provided By: BDSM Librarywww.bdsmlibrary.com
Synopsis: Against dreams of rape and injury, Martina battles to gain control of her life, and silence her subconscience. Martina Gonzales was late getting home from work. It had been an extremely long
  fourteen-hour day, and her feet were sore to the bones from walking back and
  forth from the dining room to the kitchen. She was covered with splattered
  food that had hit her when putting the plates and glasses into her bussing
  tray, and her uniform would need at least one trip into the wash. To make things
  worse, the wait staff had tipped her poorly. At least when she turned twenty-one
  next month, and could start waiting instead of bussing the money would be better.
  She was going to have to buy books next week for the coming semester as well
  as keep gas in her car. 
When she had arrived at the small red brick town house the only thing that
  kept her moving was, knowing that her roommates Shelly and Tara were gone.
  They had gone home over the summer break while Martina slugged away in the
  summer schedule. Their parents gave them all they needed, and had no idea what
  it was like to have to cover part of your education, as well as room and board.
  At least the bitches paid their share of rent while they were gone. 
She opened the front door wearily, taking three attempts just to get the key
  in. Half stumbling, half removing her offending work shoes, she managed to
  squeeze her five-foot frame through the door. She was small in almost every
  respect. She only weighed one hundred and ten pounds. Which was just enough
  to actually have boobs and an ass that were big enough to cover her ribs and
  hipbones respectively. Tonight since she was working she had her thick black
  hair pulled back tight and braided in one thick strand that stopped just below
  her belt line. Her skin was unblemished, and the light brown color typical
  of Latin women. Martina's eyes were dark and intelligent, surrounded by a slightly
  round face with striking cheekbones, and well-maintained eyebrows. 
Martina couldn't even put her tiny purse down before he was on her. His grip
  was vice-like on her upper arms inciting her to shout with surprise. Impossibly
  strong, he threw her across the tiny tiled entryway into the stairs. The purse
  flew away from her, and she hit her head on one of the stairs as her body collided
  with them. Fireworks went off behind her dark brown eyes, and her left knee
  throbbed from it's own blow on the tile. 
He switched the deadbolt into place, and rapidly pulled the security chain
  through its track. When he turned, Martina could make out a massive man through
  the haze that flooded her mind. Trying to pick up the pace of her memory she
  told herself. 
�White male, six-foot maybe three inches. Two hundred-fifty pounds.� 
�You better add a foot darling�for what's in my pants.� 
His voice was guttural, and menacing. 
The attacker stomped across the tile, his heavy lugged work boots making intimidating
  thuds as he approached. Turning she tried to crawl up the stairs away from
  him, but he kicked her squarely in the ass propelling her up two stairs, and
  splitting her bottom lip on a third. Tailbone throbbing, and lip spurting blood,
  she tried crawling up, away from the madman. 
�Where do you think you're going honey? Oh, I see you want to take me to bed.
  Don't worry sugar, I'll fuck you good.� 
He was conversationally threatening her. And she was pulled involuntarily
  to her feet when he grabbed her braid and yanked her up. Martina was half dragged
  half walked up the stairs. Balance was not hers anymore; it belonged to the
  man's grip on her hair. At will he could pull her down, or leave her on her
  feet. She spat blood from the busted lip, and her work shirt was now covered
  in plasma, as well as food. 
Once at the top of the stairs he shoved her forward and Martina fell to her
  knees spitting more blood. He moved to her side and gave her a swift kick in
  the ribs. 
�Plenty of time to be on your knees later hon.� 
Now he had her by the waistband of her pants, and she tried kicking him like
  a mule, but the foul man caught her ankle with his boot, and stepped down hard
  on it. A lightening bolt of pain ran up her leg, and a sick crunch was heard.
  Her right ankle gave way and shattered beneath the boot. 
�Now that's no way to welcome your lover.� 
He was breathing a little harder now. 
�Suppose you just can't wait to get me to bed. At least your friends are gone,
  we can just get started right here seeing as it's gonna be private.� 
Squealing with agony the entire time, she was thrown onto her back. She tried
  to move, to find purchase, but he was straddling her too quickly. When she
  tried to claw him off he pulled back a large hand and slapped her repeatedly,
  spraying fine droplets of her blood on the wall each time. Finally he caught
  her hands, and wrapped both wrists with his immense left hand ending her struggle. 
Martina could feel his sweat mixing with her, and he leaned down and licked
  her lower lip. His saliva burned in her open wound, and she started screaming
  for help. 
�No help for you sweetheart, it's well past everyone else's bedtime.� 
As the whimpers began escaping her lips, he took a large hunting style knife
  from somewhere behind him and eased it under her shirt, concluding by savagely
  ripping it back to him leaving her white work shirt in tatters. Through tears,
  she saw that he was now doing the same to her sports bra. 
�Beautiful darlin. Just beautiful.� 
Still holding her arms he moved his weight back to her thighs and cut her
  belt off, then he cut the buttons out of her button down fly jeans. 
Putting the knife to her throat and pressing enough to cause a crease in the
  skin on her neck he spoke sweetly now. 
�I'm going to let go of your hands now darlin, you just take those pants down
  while I smell your hair, if you try anything I'll cut your nice smooth throat,
  and you won't be able to know what it was like to fuck me.� 
He moved his hand back to the braid of her hair, and leaned his nose to her
  ear. Martina could smell his rancid breath, and feel his respiration in her
  ear. Sobbing now she slowly moved her hands to her pants, and underwear, moving
  them together she lowered them just below her knees. That was as far as she
  could go with out cutting herself on the blade. Crying, she laid her hands
  on the floor by her head. 
�That's it darlin just whisper into my ears. He said when she croaked with
  the perversion and disgust. 
He slapped the insides of her legs, until against the agony of her broken
  ankle she separated them, then he reached down and with his free hand and undid
  his pants. Using her right breast brutally as a handle he kept the blade on
  her and aimed his penis to her crotch. It took him several tries, but finally
  he found the entrance, and started pushing. 
The barbarian hadn't lied much about his size. He was huge, and as he pushed
  more of it into her she felt like she would burst. There was no compassion
  in him either. He never backed up, just kept going deeper and deeper until
  he hit her cervix. Then he lay still a moment and spoke to her soothing now. 
�See gorgeous, I knew you could do it.� 
Seconds later he began ramming her like a piston. Rhythmic and forceful he
  pounded her bottoming at the end of every stroke, grunting with every withdraw.
  It seemed to last for ever in and out in and out. Her insides felt like they
  would be ripped from her body. Finally she wailed, and began trembling thoroughly
  humiliated and writhing in pain. Almost as if he began feeling sorry for her,
  he stopped when she started trembling. 
�Aw darlin, I'm glad it was good for you.� 
He pulled out in one jerk, and put his knife away. Then grabbing her hair
  braid pulled her to her feet. Ankle buckling and her knees wavering, Martina
  was being held up by the man's hold on her hair and nothing else. Then he started
  moving. 
He forced her to walk, yelping and crying, tears streaming down her face.
  Blood covered her chest, and left a trail down her torso from the broken lip.
  He only dragged her ten feet, but it felt like miles to Martina. 
�Now it's my turn darlin, you just suck me good and no biting.� 
He was now tying the braid of her hair to her own bedroom doorknob. One quick
  knot that made her feel like the back of her head would explode. Then he was
  coming to her again. The knife in his right hand again, his disgusting giant
  cock in the other. 
She tried putting her hands up, but he just dropped his cock and closing his
  fist, punched her in the nose. There was a sick crack, a brief spray of snot
  and blood, and Martina knew it was broken. Blood streamed from it adding to
  the mess of her lip. Her eyes completely out of focus, and her entire head
  throbbing with pain, she relented. The fight had been beaten completely out
  of her. 
He shoved his tool into her mouth, past the split lip and through the disgust
  that now coated her face. Then in a sweet voice he added insult to injury. 
�That's it whore suck it good, so that my cum spills out when I slit your
  throat.� 
�NOOOOOO!� 
Martina screamed and sat bolt up right in bed clawing at the air all around
  her. She was covered in sweat and fear. Twice in as many nights she had the
  same dream. Twice she came to the same decision�She would die first. 
�NEVER YOU BASTARD, FUCKING NEVER!�
