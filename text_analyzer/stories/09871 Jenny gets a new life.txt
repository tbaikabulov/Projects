Jenny gets a new life
By Sarah

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jenny felt out of place at the university.&nbsp; True, she had been granted a scholarship for her track time at high school, but she didn&#8217;t really feel worthy to be deserving of a full four year scholarship.&nbsp; Still, her parents had begged her to take it, since it might be the only chance she would have to get a college degree.&nbsp; So reluctantly, she had signed the acceptance letter, and was soon on her way to the Kansas University, S.U.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The moment she had entered the town thought, she had a feeling that something was different.&nbsp; There was a fence on the inside of the river, and the town didn&#8217;t seem like it was the typical college town.&nbsp; Still, she put her concerns aside, and began to setup in her dorm room, which thankfully had come with a state of the art computer and of course some basic outfits for her track times.&nbsp; What she found strange was the outside areas around the buildings.&nbsp; It seemed like there were kennels and horse hitching posts all over the place.&nbsp; Jenny couldn&#8217;t begin to understand their meaning, but figured it was just a piece of history the school decided to leave up.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As she waved goodbye to her parents, she joined a group of girls heading to the administration building.&nbsp; She needed to register for her classes still, so she did a leisurely jog to the building.&nbsp; The administration building was only two stories tall, but it seemed to have the offices of all the campus services inside it, except the security division.&nbsp; As Jenny entered, she found her last name&#8217;s line, and got in it.&nbsp; The line, thankfully seemed to be moving forward at a reasonable clip, thanks mainly to the helpers who passed out class catalogues and offered advice to the nervous freshmen.&nbsp; Soon, Jenny found herself at the head of the line.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Name, please.�&nbsp; The woman behind the counter asked in a monotone voice, implying she was bored, and yet Jenny could tell she was examining all the girls before her.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Jenny Miller.�&nbsp; Jenny answered, looking at the woman as she typed in her name at the computer.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Let me see.&nbsp; Ah, here it is.&nbsp; Yes, we have you down as a track girl.&nbsp; Ok, we have you scheduled for basic math, basic grammar, political and military history, computer programming 1, and stable maintenance and design.&nbsp; Being on scholarship, I must inform you that failure in any class, unexcused absences, or any breach of track team rules, is automatic dismissal from the university and conversion.&nbsp; Sign here, please.�&nbsp; The woman printed out the warning page and Jenny&#8217;s schedule, and passed them to Jenny to sign.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jenny looked over the schedule, and signed the acknowledgment form, and then the woman gave Jenny a map of the campus, and sent her off to the bookstore to get her books.&nbsp; Jenny again felt like a fish out of water as she crossed the campus, but she knew she had to try her best.&nbsp; 
As nervous as she was, she entered the bookstore and handed her schedule to the worker behind the desk, who in turn scanned in all the classes on the schedule.&nbsp; �Would you like these delivered to your room, miss, or would you like to carry them?�&nbsp; Jenny was surprised at the question, but seeing as the store was able to deliver, she requested delivery.&nbsp; �Very good, miss.&nbsp; The books will be delivered in 2 hours to your dorm room.&nbsp; Good Luck.�

Jenny was beginning to relax a little, and getting over her initial nerves, so she decided to go down to the track, to do some laps.&nbsp; Running always seemed to calm her down.&nbsp; She made a light pace to the track, and wasn&#8217;t surprised to see she had the track to herself.&nbsp; She began her run with a slow pace and gradually built up to a run over the mile long track.&nbsp; As she picked up her speed, Jenny became oblivious to the outside world.&nbsp; She kept up her run for nearly an hour, not really straining herself, just keeping a constant pace going.&nbsp; Finally, she realized the bookstore delivery was only in a few minutes, so she left the track, and hustled to her dorm room.

Jenny didn&#8217;t realize she had been watched by the track coach, but the coach had seen the girl on the track, and made some discreet inquiries of the security squads, who informed her of Jenny&#8217;s status.&nbsp; The coach knew Jenny would be a great distance runner, but would she accept her fate willingly, was the question of the hour.

As Jenny got to her room, she found the bookstore crew moving down the halls, dropping off books.&nbsp; Jenny got to her room as the men came to her door.&nbsp; Jenny took the books from them, and gave them a smile and thanks as she closed her door.&nbsp; She turned on the computer and checked her email, to find a note from her parents and one from someone at the school.&nbsp; Her parents wished her luck in school and reminded her to write when she could.&nbsp; The note from the school turned out to be from the track coach, asking if Jenny would be willing to meet early, to discuss her position on the track team.&nbsp; Jenny replied to the coach, and soon a meeting was arranged for later that night.&nbsp; 

Jenny met the coach in her office at 5 that same night, and Jenny couldn&#8217;t help but be impressed.&nbsp; The coach had the legs of a runner, and the stamina to match.&nbsp; Jenny knew the look of a first class runner when she saw it.&nbsp; The coach likewise recognized the talent in the young freshman as she entered the office.

�Jenny, welcome to the school and my office.&nbsp; I am glad we could have this meeting early, as I saw you on your run this afternoon.&nbsp; Your form is perfect, and I am honored we had a good scouting report.&nbsp; The reason, however, that I called you over was to inform you that when school begins tomorrow, the penalty rules will also begin.&nbsp; Now I don&#8217;t want you to be nervous, since it seems like you&#8217;ll be ok for classes, but if you feel like they&#8217;re not going as you would hope I would ask you to come see me, ok?�

Jenny felt moved by the small speech, and she promised to come see the coach if she felt out of her depth.&nbsp; Jenny went back to her dorm room, and began washing off from her exercise, and getting ready for bed.

Jenny awoke at 7 am the following morning, and quickly began her morning ritual.&nbsp; She brushed her hair and teeth, rinsed her mouth, and began to dress.&nbsp; Nothing over the top, she decided, just some nice shorts and a tee, over her sports bra and panties. Running shoes and socks completed her outfit.&nbsp; Jenny looked at the clock, and saw it was 7:45 am, and in 15 minutes she had her first class.&nbsp; Jenny grabbed the books for the computer programming class, and made for the computer sciences building.&nbsp; 

Jenny found the classroom and entered the class, 2 minutes before the bell.&nbsp; She was surprised to see only 10 girls in the class, however.&nbsp; She opened her book, and got ready to take notes as the bell rang.&nbsp; The professor began right away, explaining the coding language C++ to the girls, who were rapidly taking notes.&nbsp; Jenny&#8217;s head, however, began to swim, trying to copy the notes and understand them.&nbsp; 

As the class ended, Jenny was still trying to understand the first lesson.&nbsp; She knew she was in trouble, as she made her way to the next class.&nbsp; That first day, Jenny felt like she was in the deep end of the pool, without a lifejacket.&nbsp; As the week progressed, Jenny felt like she was going under.&nbsp; Remembering what the track coach had said, Jenny fired off an email to her, asking if she could meet up that night.&nbsp; The coach sent a reply back within the hour, and said Jenny would be expected.

Jenny went to the coach&#8217;s office, and began to tell the coach of the week, and before long, she was sobbing, knowing she couldn&#8217;t handle the work.&nbsp; The coach came around her desk, and hugged Jenny tightly.&nbsp; Then she pulled back, and looked at the girl in the eyes as she spoke.&nbsp; 

�Jenny, dear, this school isn&#8217;t just about the classes.&nbsp; We also have other classes for girls like you.&nbsp; If you want, I can remove you from the normal schedule, and sign you up for the alternative work.&nbsp; But the choice to do that would be a last choice for you.&nbsp; Before you answer, go back to your dorm, and do an internet search for ponygirls, ok dear?�

Jenny looked back at the coach as replied �I already know what pony girls are, coach.&nbsp; Someone made a reference to ponygirls as I was leaving class, and I looked it up.&nbsp; I thought the images were faked, till I saw some of the internet postings had real people in them.&nbsp; I know I can&#8217;t make it here coach, not as a student.&nbsp; I would rather be a pony, than be expelled.�

The coach looked at the freshman girl and nodded her head.&nbsp; �Ok Jenny, if that is your decision, I&#8217;ll make the notations in your records.&nbsp; Just stand there in the corner till I&#8217;m done, and we will get you converted.�

Jenny moved to the indicated corner and stood proud and tall, just as she had seen some of the ponygirls in the photos doing.&nbsp; The coach had already done the conversion forms, so she just acted like she was typing in information for a few minutes.&nbsp; She smiled to herself, as she saw Jenny standing there, just like she was already in her tack.&nbsp; She thought to herself, this girl will be perfect.
�Ok Jenny, its time to get you outfitted and dressed.&nbsp; Come with me.�

The coach stood up from her desk and walked out into the hall, with a submissive Jenny following in her wake.&nbsp; The coach led Jenny to a storage room, where Jenny was assaulted by the smell of rubber and leather.&nbsp; She gagged slightly, then as she got used to the smell, Jenny walked into the room with the coach closing the door behind her with a final sounding clang.

The coach first had Jenny strip off her clothes.&nbsp; Jenny did so reluctantly, but she knew she had chosen this, so she picked up her pace, till she stood naked in front of the coach.&nbsp; The coach smiled at Jenny, then turned and picked up a rubber suit from the wall. The suit was colored a deep brown with some white spots.&nbsp; The coach unzipped the suit and handed it to Jenny, who began to slip it on.&nbsp; Jenny found there were rubber booties on the suit, and she worked into the suit, gradually pulling it up her legs to her thighs.&nbsp; The coach moved forward at this point, helping Jenny into the top half of the suit, including getting Jenny&#8217;s hair out the top hole in the head piece.&nbsp; The coach zipped the suit closed on Jenny, leaving the girl in a brown suit, with her face exposed.&nbsp; 

The coach then turned to the wall again, and picked up a pair of boots with hooves on them.&nbsp; Jenny lifted each foot in turn, and the coach slipped the hoof boots onto Jenny&#8217;s feet.&nbsp; As Jenny settled her feet back to the floor, the coach kneeled down and first laced then zippered the hoof boots closed.&nbsp; Jenny could feel the height the hoof boots gave her, and she teetered on them a bit, till she got settled in their feeling.&nbsp; The coach then carried over some hand mitts, which she fastened on Jenny&#8217;s hands, rendering the girl helpless. 

The coach then reached to the suit and pulled on some panels, which exposed Jenny&#8217;s B breasts and shaved pussy and ass.&nbsp; Jenny started to sound a protest, but by then, it was too late.&nbsp; The coach began to lube up an anal plug and slowly worked the plug into Jenny&#8217;s ass.&nbsp; Jenny squealed as the plug was inserted and then twisted by the coach.&nbsp; Next, the coach picked up a vibrator, and inserted that into Jenny&#8217;s pussy.&nbsp; To hold the two tormentors in place, the coach picked up a bright white harness and fastened it onto Jenny, making sure to thread the crotch strap thru the metal loops at the bottom of the two intruders.&nbsp; Jenny meanwhile was squirming and moaning, but unable to move yet without help.

The coach continued to fasten the harness on Jenny, making sure to pull her breasts thru the loops before the coach tightened the harness in place.&nbsp; The final touches were the bridle and the tail.&nbsp; The coach picked up a leather bridle and fitted it over Jenny&#8217;s head, then secured it to the helpless girl.&nbsp; Finally, the coach picked up a horsehair tail that matched Jenny&#8217;s hair perfectly, and connected it to the harness.&nbsp; 

The coach fit a bit in place effectively gagging Jenny and then she connected a leash to the bridle, and began to walk the bound girl out into the stable building.&nbsp; Jenny was shocked to see the other ponygirls and even a few ponyboys in the stalls of the stable.&nbsp; Some whinnied to the new pony, others looked at her curiously, and the ponyboys all got erections upon seeing her.&nbsp; Jenny too was turned on by the sight, and she couldn&#8217;t help but blush, when she saw the boys&#8217; reactions.&nbsp; 

The coach led Jenny to an empty stall, and put her inside for the night.&nbsp; She removed the bit gag, and then hugged the girl.&nbsp; She then turned and closed the stall door, and walked the length of the barn, before switching the lighting over to night lighting, and closing the barn door.&nbsp; 

Jenny looked around her stall, and noted some hay for a bed, and a trough for water and food.&nbsp; She turned to her stall&#8217;s neighbor, and then saw that all the ponies had moved to their beds, and went to sleep.&nbsp; Jenny had wanted to get answers, but instead, she took the cue, and settled into her hay bed.&nbsp; Maybe tomorrow she would get some answers, she thought as she drifted off to bed.

The school meanwhile continued its slow but deliberate conversions of the freshmen class.&nbsp; All the upperclassmen grinned and pointed to the new ponygirl as she made her rounds, pulling the delivery carts and other buggies around the campus and out into town.&nbsp; The brown and white pony soon became a hot topic for discussion, especially during racing season.
