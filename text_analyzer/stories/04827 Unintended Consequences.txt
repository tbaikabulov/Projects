UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES

&nbsp;

Prologue

Mohammed Al-Utaibi was having a very bad day, not that day or
night meant much to him anymore.� He
still had headaches from the explosion that had killed most of men with whom he
had worked.� His concept of time had
vanished in the weeks since the Special Forces unit had put a hood over his
face and taken him from Baghdad to Camp Anaconda to Balad Air Force Base, and from there
to an underground cell at an undisclosed location.� Though the passport was false, his Geiger counter
was real enough and members of Task Force 124 had immediately understood his
potential significance.� They did not
employ invasive throat and anal search.�
They had a scanner in the beginning that did it all.� Inch by inch, it was run over his body in
case it bleeped, meaning that he had a non-body tissue substance.� Only his mouth caused it to bleep.� They forced his mouth open and examined every
filling.� Otherwise nothing.� 

&nbsp;

Centcom runs U. S. military operations across the Middle East.�
Together, Centcom and the CIA ran TF 124.� Within hours of being captured, word had
reached senior officers at both organizations and by the time the sun rose the
next day, the President had been informed.�
Before noon, an executive order had been signed designating Mohammed as an
enemy combatant, Category Red-1.� 

&nbsp;

The United States had used the Red-1 nomenclature less
than twenty times since 2001, when it began exempting terrorist detainees from
the safeguards that the Geneva Convention offered the more typical prisoners of
war.� Legally, the designation meant that
the American government had determined that Mohammed might have knowledge of
immanent (Category Red), large-scale (Level 1) terrorist attacks.� As a result, Mohammed would be immune from
both the rules defined in Geneva and the rights that the Supreme Court
had recently designated for prisoners held in Guantanamo.

&nbsp;

In more personal terms, the designation put Mohammed in shit up to
his ankles.� The problem was that they�d
thrown him in headfirst.

&nbsp;

Of course, the nations of the international community did not
condone torture, even for prisoners like Mohammed.� Civilized nations do not torture captives,
but torture had been rather narrowly defined in the manual that specified
permissible interrogation techniques for Red-1 detainees like Mohammed.� Called the �Black Book� or �BeeBee�
because of the color of its cover, the manual alerted interrogators to
carefully calculate the harm inflicted on detainees against the potential
danger from terrorist acts.� What this
meant in practical terms was that interrogators could do anything that did not
cause �serious and lasting� injury.� The
conjunction was italicized so that the manual�s point would be clear.� Serious injuries were allowed as long as they
were not lasting.� In the same way,
psychotropic drugs were banned only if they produced �serious and lasting� brain injury or mental
illness.� The same rule applied to
sensory deprivation, restrictive confinement and denial of food and water.

&nbsp;

The acolytes of the Black Book also were informed that pain was
subjective, differing from one person to another.� Thus, just about any amount of pain within
reason was allowed as long as it did not produce �serious and
lasting� injury.� The BeeBee also ironically noted that ��pain should not necessarily be substituted
for more accepted methods of interrogation.�
The threat of being hurt is often more effective than the pain itself.�

&nbsp;

Mohammed�s journey had begun in Baghdad.�
Even while still on his knees and ears still ringing, a man in an American
military uniform had zip-tied his hands behind his back, pulled a hood over his
face and then tightened it around his neck.�
The world went black�..the hood was too tight�.he couldn�t breathe.� One shallow breath after another, he fought to
breathe and soon he was panting like a dog.�
His throat tightened as he began to panic; he was going to pass
out.� His breaths came faster and faster,
until he was hyperventilating and gravity ended, the floor seeming to fall out
from beneath him.

&nbsp;

Stay calm, Mohammed told himself as he lay on his chest.� They wouldn�t kill you this
way�.relax�.breathe.� He slowed down his
breathing.� And after a few minutes, he
realized that he was still alive.� He
focused on what his other senses were telling him; the pain of his wrists, the
smell of cordite burning his nostrils, the shouting of men around him, the
rough fabric of the hood as it touched his face, the moist areas where saliva
had trickled onto the inside of the hood.�
He was tossed in a vehicle and it took almost an hour to get him to his
first destination.� He spent an hour
sitting on a chair in a room that shuddered to the nearby hits of at least two
mortars.� Suddenly, he was grabbed on
either arm and marched to a second vehicle.�
A man sat on either side of him and this ride took only about fifteen
minutes---or was it an hour?� From here
he was marched into what his senses told him was another small room and he was
left alone for another long period of time.

&nbsp;

Two men grabbed him on either side and pulled him up.� Even though he stumbled and was helpless, a
moment later he felt an unexpected and hard punch in his thick stomach---then
more.� He grunted and fell, the pain and
surprise of the blows had been total and now he found it difficult again to
breathe.� He rubbed his face against the
floor, hoping to could drag the bag off of his head.

&nbsp;

�Allah.� Allah,�
he said, just before he felt the stick of a needle in his leg.� A silvery-white peace slowly spread to his
brain and his fear vanished, then the blackness overtook him.� When he awoke he found the nightmare hadn�t
ended after all.� He opened his eyes and
saw nothing, nothing but the most profound blackness possible.� He seemed to be swimming inside it, bathing
in a sea of ink.� The hood; he must still
be wearing the hood.� He tried to pull it
off�..and realized that his hands were still bound behind his back and now he�d
been manacled to the floor.� 

&nbsp;

And he could tell that his no-longer firm buttocks were exposed to
the cool air, for he sat upon a chair; it had no seat and his pants had been
removed.� Also, there was an odd feeling
of pressure on his right index finger as if an alligator clip had been
attached.� There was what seemed to be a
Velcro strip around his ankle too.� He
tried to rub them off, but found he couldn�t.�
And he was thirsty, very thirsty.�
He licked his lips with a dry tongue.�
�Hello.� Salaam alaikum,� he tried, his voice raspy.� The hint of an echo, but no answer.

&nbsp;

He tried again, more loudly this time.� �Alaikum
salaam.� Hello.�� And now finally a real shout, �Allahu akbar.�

&nbsp;

But no one answered, and Mohammed suddenly realized that he could
hear nothing at all.� It was as if he
were already in his grave.� Not a
sound.� Not the creak of a tree in the
wind or the chirp of a bird or the hum of traffic.� No inside sounds either, no air conditioning
or water pipes.� It was like his ears had
been filled with cotton, but they hadn�t.�
Could the Ameriki have
forgotten him here, wherever he was?�
Would he die of hunger or thirst?

&nbsp;

Mohammed pulled himself together, he knew that he needed to stay
focused.� I am a scientist he thought, I
must use my mind.� Now began a litany, an
attempt to rally his courage and maintain his sanity.� My name is Mohammed Al-Utaibi.� The kafirs
have taken me prisoner.� How long
ago?� I
don�t know.� Where am I?� I don�t
know.� They drugged me, put me to
sleep and then moved me somewhere.� Fine,
I�m not in Iraq anymore.�
He concentrated on steadying his breathing and quickly realized that
they had cut a hole in the mask that allowed him to breathe more easily.� Good.

&nbsp;

Why are they doing this to me?�
They want to know about the Geiger counter.� Of course.�
He should have left it in the room, even though the Ameriki would have found it anyway.�


&nbsp;

He tried to relax.� He wasn�t
an illiterate peasant like the others.�
They�d been cannon fodder and had served their purpose.� And he knew the Yankees had rules; they could make him wear the hood, but they
couldn�t hurt him too much.� They would
ask questions, he would refuse to answer and then they would send him on a
plane to Guantanamo.�
If they asked him about the Geiger counter, he would say��he would say
that he didn�t even know what it was.�
But first he knew that he needed a new name.� A Shia name would be best��Ali, then. �He would call himself Ali.� As long as he didn�t tell them who he was or
what he was doing in Iraq, he would be fine.� 

&nbsp;

Even though he had despised the Ameriki for their weaknesses, now it reassured him that they had
rules that they had to follow.� He just
had to stay calm and he could beat them.�
But staying calm got harder as the seconds stretched into hours.� He thought of his wife, of his sons, of the
filthy concrete and dirt floor of the lab where he had worked, of the Kaaba,
which he hoped to visit some day but had never seen except in photographs.� Of the glorious moment when he had met the
Sheikh, Sheikh bin Laden and of the less than wonderful instance when he�d met
the butcher of Iraq before he�d been betrayed and assassinated by the Ameriki and their Shia lackeys, of the
long wait for the peasants to smuggle the enriched plutonium waste from the
Ukraine through Iran and into Baghdad.�
He smiled to himself at that thought, but his thirst pulled him back
into the bleak room.� His bladder was
full�.what if he needed to move his bowels?�
Was that why they�d cut his pants off?

&nbsp;

�Bastards.� Swine!� Pigs!!� he said aloud.� �Kafirs.� My name is Ali.� Ali Al-Hauwaj.�� His voice rose, �Let me go!�� He repeated himself a dozen times, a hundred
times, until his voice cracked and his face grew red and shiny.� 

&nbsp;

Someone had to respond�.but no one did.� Perhaps the Yankees really had forgotten him.�
No, that would be impossible.�
This was a game.� They were toying
with him, but Allah would protect
him.� And so he waited, fighting his
fear, licking his dry lips, slowly counting to five hundred and back down
again.� But his dread deepened in the
continuing silence, along with his thirst.

&nbsp;

�Please,� he repeated quietly.�
�Please.�

&nbsp;

Later, he couldn�t tell how much later, a torrent of water
suddenly drenched him.� Freezing water,
painfully cold, stinging him through his hood and his clothes.� So cold.�
Yet Mohammed turned his head up to drink, thankful for even this, for
any sign that they knew he was there.

&nbsp;

�Allahu Akbar,� he
mumbled to himself.� He had asked and Allah had provided for his imprisoned
son.� He drank and continued to drink,
afraid that the water would stop and the thirst return.� But the water continued to fall and his
relief soon turned to a different misery.�
He wiggled as best he could, but couldn�t escape the falling water.� The water quickly saturated his clothes until
they were soaking wet.� Water trickled
from his stomach into his crotch and down his legs, off of his feet.� He could feel it pool on the floor and rise
to his ankles.

&nbsp;

He began to shiver.� He
hadn�t realized how blessed he had been just a few minutes ago---just to be
dry.� How he hated these Ameriki and their tricks.� They were laughing at him somewhere, he knew
this.� He knew he should be angry, but he
was only afraid and cold.� How long would
they leave him here and what would they do next?� �Allah,�
he said, �I beg your forgiveness.�

&nbsp;

Later, a needle jabbed into his lower back.� Almost before he felt it, blackness had come
again.� He woke up next on a sagging cot
in a small room made of gray concrete, a thin blanket over his body.� He sat up.�
He was naked, but he could see.�
His hood had been taken off and the room was lit by a dim ceiling
bulb.� His hands were cuffed in front,
but his feet were free.� A pile of
clothes lay on the floor in front of him, a loose shirt and soft sweatpants
with an elastic waist.� They had realized
that there was no use hurting him.� So he
had survived the infidels�.he hoped.

&nbsp;

He shivered as a cough shook his soft body.� He sat on the cot and tried to think.� He was tired and hungry, slightly feverish,
but otherwise okay.� The Ameriki wanted to scare him, but he
wouldn�t give in.� He waited a few more
minutes.� Then feeling as though he had
no choice, he stood up and tugged at the door.�
Surprisingly, it opened.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

Mohammed had kept them waiting.�
Which fit his profile, The
Interrogator thought.� They could see
him on the monitors as he sat on the cot, digging at his behind.� He was rattled and becoming ill; the various
body monitors showed that he had reacted badly to his time in the hole,
although he had slowly brought himself under control.� The
Interrogator was not surprised.�
Mohammed was a scientist, not a killer like many of the others.� The hole was dreadfully stressful to anyone
who wasn�t flat-out psychotic.� 

&nbsp;

But The Interrogator had
learned not to underestimate these guys, especially the takfirs.� Every one was
highly motivated and their faith gave them extra strength.� They never broke all at once, not the really
important ones.� They gave up a little
and then they started lying again.�
Getting everything took time.

&nbsp;

He was the lead interrogator in Task Force 124, a Delta Force
major with Master�s degree in Abnormal Psychology and another in Clinical
Psychology, both from North Carolina.�
Before he had signed on for Diego Garcia, an old Delta operator had told
him to view this job of breaking people as a test of endurance, a rite of
passage into true manhood.� He said that
in addition to doing what was needed, a tour here would be a love
affair---exotic and intoxicating---and that The
Interrogator would be changed in some fundamental, almost spiritual
way.� And that just when this hostile
paradise had seduced him, he was going to have leave and hate doing so.� 

&nbsp;

Like hell he would.� From
day one he couldn�t wait to get off of this sand pile.� Especially after learning that the old Delta
guy back in the real world had duped damned near everyone else currently in
this unit.� 

&nbsp;

He�d served six years in a small Civilian Affairs/PsyOp�s reserve
unit before he�d obtained his advanced degrees.�
Even while in school, he stayed in the reserves for the extra cash.� Upon graduating, he continued building the
small company he�d started so long ago.�
But 9/11 had changed everything.�
Itching for revenge, he had gone on active duty then; soon he�d been
awarded the necessary clearances for Delta.�
But what he did now changed a man.�
And he�d changed a lot, not necessarily for the better.

&nbsp;

His past had hardened him even before
Delta: a lying, cheating, gambling father raised him, and then left him and his
mother to fend for themselves.� He put
himself through school collecting and paying bets at a gaming tables.� �There
are two kinds of people in the world,� he always said, �croupiers and gamblers, wolves and sheep.�� The statement implicitly asked the question
of everyone he met, �Which one are you?�

&nbsp;

His had always been a voracious intellect, but it was now more
rapacious than ever.� He had studied
Islam and its offshoot, the Wahabbi fundamentalists.� He studied the Salafi�s; the true believers that wouldn�t drink or gamble or smoke
or fraternize with women.� These were the
suicide bombers and the ones that wanted to take the world back to the great
golden age of Islam, the foot soldiers of the Taliban.� These were the ones that were immediately
identifiable with their dress and behavior.�


&nbsp;

Then there were the ultras---the real ultras---the Takfirs.�
These were the ones that adopted every single custom of the West,
however much they might loathe them, in order to pass as fully westernized and
therefore harmless.� They were
clean-shaved, went to the gym, dressed in suits and were fully educated.� The ultimate chameleons, the takfirs were
full of hatred precisely because they had sullied themselves in order to pass
unnoticed among the enemy.

&nbsp;

But none of them fooled The
Interrogator.� First he watched his
subjects and then he read about them.�
Soon that person would be in his dreams and then somehow he�d begin
to�.resonate�.with that person.� The
predatory part of his mind would then take over, refined and cold and in full
pursuit, and then he would know, he would just know that person�s Achilles'
heel.� He also knew that this ability
came not from age and education, but from wit and deepening perception.

&nbsp;

He knew too that he pushed the limits of the Black Book.� Even some other interrogators were
uncomfortable around him, worried that his methods crossed the line into�..the
T-word�..a word and an idea that bothered him less and less.� Sometimes after a particularly grueling
session, he looked in the mirror and thought he might see Josef Mengele or
someone equally infamous.� The worst part
was that he didn�t care anymore, didn�t care what his parents or few friends
would think if they saw what he was doing on CNN or Fox News.

&nbsp;

But The Interrogator had
never killed any prisoners or even hurt one in a way that wouldn�t eventually
heal.� He pushed the limits and stretched
them until they almost broke, but if he wasn�t clear on whether a procedure was
permitted, he still asked one of the military lawyers that were permanently
attached to TF 124.� At their request,
the questions were never written; they didn�t want to end up on CNN either.� Still, it was hoped that their presence would
check the worst impulses of the interrogators.�
And the prisoner�s health was closely monitored, if only to make sure
that they were successful.� The
interrogators of TF 124 had questioned over a hundred prisoners and only one
had died; a massive heart attack that probably would have killed him soon
anyway.� 

&nbsp;

TF 124 interrogators had other restrictions too.� They always worked in pairs and they took
six-week long breaks twice a year.� While
well-educated, his partner was still a mean shit; they worked well
together.� Once a year they were
interviewed by military psychiatrists and took long personality tests.� The rules were supposed to prevent them from
developing God complexes---this was a real risk, he knew.� Having this much power over another human
being, not just the power to kill but the government sanctioned power to break
and to hurt with impunity---it could be intoxicating.� He had been taught in school that nothing
could be more repulsive to the civilized man.�
Yet The Interrogator understood
the urge all too well; the twisted delight in making another bare his soul when
that was the last thing they wanted to do, the sick yet undeniable thrill of
making another human being cringe and beg when the pain became too much.� 

&nbsp;

Yes, he was on a slippery slope.�
The worst part was, he knew it but didn�t much care anymore.� In the past, he�d broken the rules just
enough to get the information that he�d needed.�
But now the balance now was��disturbed.�
He�d come to enjoy his work too much---he rarely had moral qualms about
it anymore.� Recently, the nightmares had
stopped and the dreams become more seductive.�


&nbsp;

He had broken multiple terrorist leaders and disrupted several
attacks, saving perhaps hundreds of civilians.�
He didn�t know the names of the lives that he�d rescued and didn�t care
to know them.� They would never know his
either, but they were real to him nonetheless.�
And that was what drove him on.�
But he also knew that even he was done after this one; he was burned out
and there was nothing left to be salvaged.�
He was ready to go back to inactive duty, back to the small company that
he�d founded in Georgia and which was basically being run by his
secretary.� 

&nbsp;

And what of the men he questioned, the men he broke, the
Mohammed�s of the world?� They weren�t
innocents caught up in some Kafkaesque nightmare.� They weren�t farmers and simple shopkeepers
caught in too-tight dragnets and taken to Guantanamo.�
They were terrorists, real ones, who knew the risks they had chosen to
take.� The Interrogator had nothing but contempt for the Amnesty
International types who whined that any coercive tactic was unfair� If those weaklings believed that men like
Mohammed would give up their secrets over brownies and ice cream, they were
even more na�ve than he thought.� 

&nbsp;

As for the argument that his tactics shouldn�t be used because
they didn�t work, he could only shake his head in amusement.� Of course they worked�.they worked too well;
in fact, that was why they couldn�t be used by the police.� After a few days or a few weeks alone with
him, even the motivated people would tell him their deepest secrets and admit
to anything, do anything that he wanted, simply to make him stop.� 

&nbsp;

But The Interrogator
wasn�t trying to solve crimes---he was trying to stop them.� He wanted information on attacks that hadn�t
yet occurred.� The location of hidden
bombs and sleeper cells.� Real names and
addresses.� Concrete information that
could be verified and acted upon.� He
didn�t care how much they lied to him, as long as he got the truth or the
subject obeyed him in the end.� Lies only
drew out the pain, making it linger oh-so-much longer.� Eventually every detainee understood that and
when they did, they always gave him exactly what he wanted.� 

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

Mohammed walked out of his cell and into a larger room with a
table in the center.� Two big men walked
into the room.� �Sit,� one said in
English.� Mohammed saw no reason to
pretend that he didn�t understand, so he sat.�
One man stood out of sight behind him, while the other manacled his legs
to the chair.� They brought out a plate
of bread, a small bowl of hummus and a glass of orange juice.

&nbsp;

Mohammed felt his mouth begin to fill with saliva.� He could never remember being so hungry.� As he wondered if the food was safe, one of the
men dipped a piece of bread into the hummus and ate.� At that, Mohammed dipped his head towards the
table and shoveled food into his mouth with his cuffed hands.� The wonderful food filled his empty belly and
he felt a momentary rush of gratitude towards his captors, but he stifled the
reaction immediately.� Don�t thank the kafirs, he told himself, that�s what
they want.� 

&nbsp;

After he finished, the men cleared away the plates and walked out,
leaving Mohammed alone.� Suddenly he felt
strangely tired.� He wanted nothing more
than to put his head on the table and sleep, and only a few minutes later he
did just that.

&nbsp;

Snap!� The lights came on
and woke Mohammed.� He tried to shake the
fuzziness from his head.� A new man stood
over him.� Someone else shook him from
behind.� Why had he fallen asleep and for
how long had he been asleep?� The hummus
must have been laced with something!� He
felt like a fool as he tried to wipe off a line of drool trickling from his
mouth.

&nbsp;

�Wake up,� the man said.� He
was tall, with dark hair and a neatly trimmed goatee.� He set a thick folder on the table, but
Mohammed ignored it.� Mohammed shook
himself desperately, he needed to be clearheaded.

&nbsp;

To Mohammed, the man typified a predator; sinuous and quick,
remorseless.� Nothing about him was
gentle except his movements.� The man sat
across from Mohammed and took out a pack of Marlboros.� He lit one for himself, but didn�t offer one
to Mohammed.� 

&nbsp;

The man looked at him for a long moment, �What�s your name?�

&nbsp;

�Ali.� What�s yours?�

&nbsp;

�My name doesn�t matter.�
And I think that you�re lying to me.�
What�s your name?�

&nbsp;

�Ali.� Ali Al-Hauwaj,�
Mohammed said.� �I�m a farmer from Basra.�
This is all a mistake.�

&nbsp;

�You�re not even Iraqi.�
Don�t insult me.�� The nameless
man smiled a small cold smile.� �For the
last time, what�s your name?�

&nbsp;

�I told you,� Mohammed said as sincerely as he could.� �Ali.�

&nbsp;

�Do you want to go back in the hole?�

&nbsp;

Not that, Mohammed thought.�
Please, not that.� He swallowed
hard and tried to keep his composure as his interrogator tapped another
cigarette from the pack on the table.�
Mohammed tried to avoid looking at it.

&nbsp;

The man asked, �Cigarette?�

&nbsp;

�No,� Mohammed said.� Even
though he badly wanted one.

&nbsp;

The man shrugged, �Do you want to go back in the hole?� Yes or no?�

&nbsp;

�Of course not,� Mohammed said.�
�But my name is Ali.�� As long as
he stayed calm, he could outsmart this Ameriki.

&nbsp;

Now, The Interrogator
thought to himself.� Show this bastard
who�s in charge.� He opened the
folder.� �Your name is Mohammed
Al-Utaibi,� he said.� �You were born in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.�
You attended the University of Hamburg as an exchange student.� You received a bachelor�s degree in physics
and then an advanced degree.� Upon your
return to Saudi Arabia, you were hired by the government.�

&nbsp;

The tall man seemed to stop for a moment.� �Hamburg,� he said almost as if to himself.� Then he shook his head, �We�re going to have
to do something about that snake�s nest some day.� I mean the Germans and us.�

&nbsp;

Now he started listing off names, important names that were all
too familiar to Mohammed, for all were martyrs, killed in glorious battle
against the Crusaders.� �Mohammed
Al-Tewhi, Ibrahim bin Abha, Firaz Khan, Mohammad Al-Nasr�.�

&nbsp;

Mohammed shook his head at the last.� Al-Nasr had been his university roommate at Hamburg.� More than that, he�d been Mohammed�s best friend.� Mohammed hadn�t the education to attend a university like Hamburg, but he�d struggled hard nonetheless.� He�d finally been killed in Madrid when an apartment he�d been hiding in was blown up after it was surrounded by the Caribineri and BOEL (Bandera de Operaciones Especiales de la Legion).� His thoughts were interrupted as The Interrogator continued.

&nbsp;

�They�re all here, all singing like canaries.� Everyone swinging dick.� You�ll be joining them soon.� You won�t be able to talk to them, but you�ll
see them.� And you�ll know that I�m
telling you the truth.�

&nbsp;

Mohammed was shocked and his mind raced.� The information that this pig had given him
was incredible.� All of the presumed martyr�s
were alive, and if the Ameriki was
telling the truth, they were talking, giving up precious secrets.� But perhaps worst of all was that of
Al-Nasr---being a student had only been his cover in Europe; in addition to helping plan actions in North America and Western Europe, he�d actually been the highest level
coordinator of a network of European recruiters---which meant that he had all
sorts of names and procedures in his head.�
If the kaffir wasn�t lying,
this intelligence was of supreme importance and must be relayed back to the
Sheikh.

&nbsp;

Mohammed realized now that he had been foolish to carry a Saudi
passport, even one with a fake name.�
Saudi Intelligence had certainly identified him and revealed his past to
TF 124, though probably only in the vaguest terms.� The Saudi�s didn�t talk much about their
fledgling nuclear weapons program, certainly not to the Ameriki.� But the Saudi
silence didn�t matter; once the CIA knew Mohammed�s real name, the agency could
dig up enough for a psychological profile of him.� Mohammed knew that the goal was to make him
believe that they knew everything about him and that lying would be a waste of
time.� To their subjects, the best
interrogators appeared all-seeing as well as all powerful.

&nbsp;

Mohammed�s head snapped back as the man read aloud.� He had to fight to keep from retching.� How could the Yankee know all this?� �My
name,� he said desperately, �is Ali.�

&nbsp;

The man with the goatee stopped reading, stood and slapped
Mohammed across the face.� Mohammed
yelled, as much from the surprise as from the pain.� To be slapped like a woman was intolerable,
yet Mohammed knew somehow that he deserved the punishment for telling such a
stupid lie.

&nbsp;

�Don�t pretend to be such a dimwit.� Your name is Mohammed Al-Utaibi, of the
Al-Utaibi tribe in the western province.�
Your tribe is very important and yet, even though you come from the dry
branch, you still lost your government job in 2000.� Would you like me to tell you why?�

&nbsp;

Mohammed said nothing, but inside he shook.� His tribe was wealthy beyond belief, and it
WAS important in Saudi politics.� But his
side of the family had no wealth, not like that of the others and that was why
it was mockingly called �the dry branch�.� A sense of doom hovered over him, how could
this infidel know all this?

&nbsp;

�It doesn�t matter,� the man said.�
�I already know.� I know your
height and your weight---you are overweight and out of shape.� You have a resting heart rate of
approximately 90 beats a minute, and your blood pressure is 170 over 115.� You�re in poor health and you have reacted
badly to the stress you have faced so far.�
The very minimal stress that you will receive here.�

&nbsp;

�Allahu akbar,� Mohammed
muttered to himself.� His blood seemed to
have left his body and he could not control his shivering.

&nbsp;

The nameless interrogator took a deep drag on his cigarette.� �Yes.�
God is great,� he said.� �But God
has nothing to do with this.�� He leaned
over Mohammed, holding his lit cigarette close to the prisoner�s face.� �Mohammed, you�re a smart man.� An educated man,� he said.� �You know the United States has a prison camp and Guantanamo Bay.��
He waited.

&nbsp;

�Yes,� Mohammed rasped.

&nbsp;

�And it is no secret that detainees at Guantanamo are treated well.� They receive three meals a day.� They pray freely.� You may even have heard that they have
lawyers�.yes?�

&nbsp;

�Yes.�

&nbsp;

�But you are not going to Guantanamo Bay.�

&nbsp;

�No.�� Mohammed shrunk back
in his chair, blinking furiously.

&nbsp;

�I�m glad you agree.�
No.� You are not going to Guantanamo.��
The man took a last puff on the cigarette, then stubbed it out against
the table and flicked it away.� �I don�t
want to hurt you, Mohammed,� he said.�
�But you need to tell me the truth.�
And you will.� You�re going to
tell me everything that I want to know.�

&nbsp;

Mohammed found his voice.�
�There are rules,� he said.� �You
can�t��� But even as he said it, he knew
he was wrong.

&nbsp;

�I�ll tell you something I probably shouldn�t,� the Ameriki said.� �There is one rule��I�m not supposed to kill
you.� Not on purpose, anyway.�� Then he smiled.

&nbsp;

The expression on the man�s face scared Mohammed more than
anything that had happened so far.� The
man was a devil, a devil in human form.� Please, Mohammed almost said, I�ll give you everything.� I�ll tell you about the box I got from
Dmitri.� I�ll even tell you about the
biggest secret of all; where the box is now.� Anything to make this man leave him
alone.� Then Mohammed reminded himself
that he must not fear.� But maybe he
could give this man a little---anything to make the smile disappear.

&nbsp;

�Mohammed, are you listening?�

&nbsp;

Mohammed nodded.� He hated
himself for answering the man, but his will seemed to have wilted away.� 

&nbsp;

�I�m not supposed to kill you.�
But I am allowed to make you wish you were dead.�

&nbsp;

The Ameriki walked
out.� Even before the door was closed, he
felt the hood coming down over his head.�
�No,� Mohammed said.�
�Please.� Ask me something.� I�ll tell you.�� His voice became a shout.� �I�ll tell you.� Please!��
But the room went dark, and Mohammed knew that the hole waited.� 

&nbsp;

The next few weeks were much the same.� As the interrogations continued, Mohammed�s
experiences in confinement became even more terrifying; he was shot up with
adrenaline until his heart raced so fast that he believed it would explode.� He was bound in uncomfortable positions and
left alone for hours.� He was slipped LSD
and left to chase his mind around the silent room.� When he tried to sleep, lights were always
left burning and he was awakened by being hit and kicked by men he could not
see.

&nbsp;

Meanwhile, The Interrogator
lengthened the stretches that Mohammed spent outside of solitary confinement,
in order to make the contrast between the hole and the world even sharper.� He wanted Mohammed to feel the power over him
that he had; he could save him or destroy him, could turn day into night, white
to black.

&nbsp;

One time Mohammed had said something that for some reason rattled
him.� The memory of it later made him
uneasy, but he didn�t know why.� For a
moment, he�d been tempted---sorely tempted---to get it out of Mohammed then and
there, throw him up against the wall if need be.� But only his training had stopped him.� Never, never let a detainee see that they�ve
got you rattled, the instructors used to say.�
Nothing they tell you comes as a surprise because you�re omnipotent,
all-knowing---at that�s the way it�s supposed to be.

&nbsp;

The lessons were effective and Mohammed began to crack quickly,
divulging new secrets each time they met.�
The Interrogator reported back
to his superiors that once started, it was like watching Boulder Dam give way.� Mohammed
told them how he�d met bin Laden.� How he
had recruited employees at Pakistan�s nuclear program.� How he had met an American agent for al Qaeda
who was being sent back to the United States for a major attack.� He gave away over fifty Al Qaeda agents.� And finally, he talked about the plans for a
dirty bomb.� The Interrogator hadn�t expected Mohammed to give up so much so
soon; he simply wasn�t as tough as Khalid Mohammed or other senior al Qaeda
lieutenants, who had taken months to break. �Still, The
Interrogator felt that Mohammed was holding back, there was something that
even now he wasn�t willing to talk about.�


&nbsp;

But it simply didn�t matter anymore.� He was being replaced at his own
request.� Going back to Georgia.�
He was getting out of the active service; he�d more than served his
time.� Back to a normal life, where
people didn�t do these kinds of things to each other.� Hopefully, he would be able to slot back into
his life without any lasting major head trauma.�
He�d learned things about himself over the last few years that he didn�t
like very much.� The dreams that just
wouldn�t stop---they just became continually more seductive---until he saw
himself as if in a mirage doing things to other human beings that no civilized
man could ever accept.� And the worst
part was that he was always enjoying himself when he did these things.

&nbsp;

He knew that he was burned-out and that his exit interview with
the Task Force psychiatrists would be a real hurdle.� Guys like him just weren�t allowed to quit
when they felt like it.� Especially if
they�d requested it.� There were
protocols and he�d have to fool the best to escape therapy.� Hopefully, he�d be out on the streets again
soon.� No VA hospitals or analysts.� Clean.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

It was 9 AM and
The Interrogator was preparing for terminal leave from the active
military.� He was in the stairwell of a
multi-story parking garage near Walter Reed hospital, getting ready for the
first of his exit interviews.� He�d
parked on the ground floor next to a small, red sports car driven by a
twenty-year old secretary.� Beautiful
young thing; long, wavy, lustrous brown hair, tiny waist, dark blue tight skirt
and sheer white blouse, wearing tennis shoes over her stockings and carrying
her heels for comfort.

&nbsp;

She made him automatically think of the last woman that he�d had,
in his mind running his eyes over her body as he appreciated again her thighs
and the curve of her breasts, allowing himself to indulge in another of the
dark fantasies that he knew how to keep from the prying psychologists.� But fantasies were okay, as long as they
remained just that��.fantasies.

&nbsp;

He was climbing a stairwell to access one of the third-story
walkways, still indulging himself in his daydream; as he was approaching the
second level, he met a small dark skinned man coming down.� The man wore dark glasses which was odd in
the gloomy stairway.� Watch the eyes.� He tried to see the man�s eyes like his
instructors at The House had taught him, but it was impossible.� He felt an odd trickle of electricity race
down his spine, but knew that there was no real reason for the frisson of
fear.� 

&nbsp;

If the subject makes any
sudden move, assume it is hostile and react immediately.�
The man above made a move, but it wasn�t sudden; it was slow and even
graceful.� He reached inside his jacket
and suddenly The Interrogator�s
neurotransmitters were passing frantic messages about a gun.

&nbsp;

Afterward, he will not be sure if he saw a gun or heard it
first.� There is a lot he will not be
sure about at the subsequent enquiry.�
The individual details are clear enough, each one perpetually etched in
his memory.� It is the sequence that
eludes him.

&nbsp;

He�d begun to react when the sound of the first explosion
coincided with a hammering blow to his chest.�
He was pushed backward by the impact of the bullet, but the stairway was
narrow and he was still on his feet.� In
his mind he watched again in slow motion as the man took aim and attempts to
shoot a second time.� The next bullet
jammed and The Interrogator lost
count of the number of times the man worked the slide in an attempt to clear
the pistol.� 

&nbsp;

Suddenly he found himself lying on his back on the stairs and he
is aware of the sounds of men yelling and nearby traffic.� Above it all, he is aware of the grunted
exertions of the man now standing over him beating him on his skull with the
butt of his otherwise useless Browning.� 

&nbsp;

The Interrogator knows that he somehow put his hands over
his head, for both thumbs and seven fingers are broken.� What he will vividly recall is the feeling of
weight as the man comes down on top of him.�
The feeling of the man�s elbow in his throat and his manicured fingers
gouging into his skin.� The small man now
stands again and leans against the wall to maintain his balance while he
methodically stamps The Interrogator�s
chest and abdomen with the heel of one of his hand-made boots---he remembers
the pain as being tremendous.

&nbsp;

Then the man goes to work on his face, the heel of his boot
raining down blows with the cold indifference of a jackhammer.� The
Interrogator loses consciousness, though not for long if his memory is
correct.� He recalls for the inquiry
lying backwards like a broken doll with his head down the stairwell, tasting
his own blood and the gritty enamel of his shattered and jagged teeth, smelling
his own urine and listening to the sound of footsteps running away.� 

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

While emergency surgery quickly repaired the abdominal damage, it
took them almost a year to re-build his shattered face.� Surgery and then weeks to recover, before it started
all over again.� When he began to recover
from his first surgery, he went to a mall one afternoon.� The looks from the children he scared were
enough to make him stay in the hospital for the rest of the convalescence.� Photos that recorded the progress of the
painful work were not pretty.� He looked
into a mirror only once a week during that period.� The livid scars that never seemed to go away
and the perpetual bruising under the eyes, it all just added to the
psychological trauma that he had endured long before the stairwell.

&nbsp;

He didn�t need to go through the exit interviews after all.� Instead, the board of inquiry exonerated him
of any blame.� No one was ever arrested
for this assault---it seemed that Al Qaeda had somehow found out what he did---was
that what had bothered him about Mohammed? ---and some unknown believer had
taken their revenge.� The physicians had
performed near miracles in rebuilding his jaw and implanting crowns to replace
the missing teeth.� They had slowly
reconstructed his nose and his cheekbones, and then other surgeons had covered
up that surgery with grafts of skin.� And
when they had finished, they had sculpted a mask that was a faithful replica of
the original.� But the headaches were
with him all the time now.� 

&nbsp;

The skeptical doctors and psychiatrists and gray men that had
watched from the background and evaluated his mental fitness however, had
missed the hidden damage.� And no one
could repair this damage, because The
Interrogator never admitted that it had occurred�and he hadn�t lied because
he knew that he was flawed before the stairwell.� He was fine, he said, but it was not
true.� He�d already known that he was
getting out and in the end, it didn�t matter.�
Nothing mattered anymore.� He just
wanted out and to go home to Georgia.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Chapter 1: Blessed be pain.� Loved be
pain.� Sanctified be pain. . . Glorified
be pain!: Josemaria Escriva.

&nbsp;

He stood in the middle of the sterile white room, watching his
latest girlfriend slowly squirm on the bed.�
Her hair was the color of burnished copper, polished and shining,
normally hanging down from the top of her head for the first few inches before
turning into a mass of naturally wild curls that flowed down around her pale
shoulders, almost long enough to cover her breasts.� The breasts themselves were perfectly shaped
and not too large, round and smooth skinned with only a small scattering of
freckles on the upper surface of each mound; the nipples a pale translucent
shade of pink usually seen only on the hidden inner surfaces of some exotic
seashells.� Her arms were long and
stronger looking than might be expected from a woman who was barely five foot
six.� Her hands were delicate; the
fingers long and thin as a child�s, the nails neatly clipped and short.

&nbsp;

Her rib cage was high and arched beneath the breasts; the stomach
flat, pierced by a teardrop shaped navel above her pubis.� The hair covering her there was an even
brighter shade of hot copper; and in the way of most redheaded women, it grew
in a naturally trimmed and finely shaped wedge that only just covered the soft
secret flesh between her thighs.

&nbsp;

Her back was smooth, sweeping down from the long neck that was
always hidden by the flowing hair.� At
the base of her spine there was single pale red dime-sized birthmark in the shape
of a horn, resting just above the cleft of the small muscular buttocks.� Her legs were long, the calves strong, her
well-shaped ankles turning down into a pair of small, high-arched and delicate
feet.

&nbsp;

The face normally framed by the cascading copper hair was almost
as perfect as the body.� The forehead was
broad and clear, the cheekbones high, the mouth full without artificial
puffiness, the chin curving a little widely to give a trace of strength to the
overall sense of innocence that he�d noticed the first time he�d seen her.� Her nose was a little too long and narrow for
true classical beauty, topped by a sprinkling of a dozen freckles across the
bridge.� Her eyes, at least to him, were
stunning; large and almost frighteningly intelligent, a deep jade green.

&nbsp;

But right now, her facial beauty could not be seen.� Lying on her back, she was naked except for a
pair of shiny, black pumps.� They�d been
together for quite awhile tonight and he knew that she had to be uncomfortable,
hog-tied as she was; her wrists were cuffed behind her back while her ankles
had been cuffed together and then pulled tightly back and bound to her wrist
cuffs.� Lying on her back as she was, her
ass rested on her feet.� She finally
accepted the ache this caused, but to him it was wonderful it because it pushed
her hips into the air and laid her wonderfully hot pussy right where he wanted
it.

&nbsp;

Her narrow waist was emphasized by the heavy nylon belt to which
her wrists and ankles had been locked in back.�
Although seemingly going along with him at first, she didn�t seem to
like his toys now---but that didn�t matter.�
With the black, three-inch wide belt buckled in front and her efforts to
move severely restricted by the way she was bound, all of her attempts to
achieve freedom were in vain.� 

&nbsp;

Her head was encased in a shiny, tight, black rubber helmet that
perfectly replicated the contours of her face and head.� After cuffing her wrists, the hood had gone
on next, then the gag.� The rubber
covering zipped shut in the back and there was a small hole at the top for her
hair to protrude from the fitted hood.�
When her hair was tied into a pony tail like it was now, it extended
almost to the middle of her back.

&nbsp;

Saliva drooled out of the center hole in a three-inch long penis
gag that was buried in her mouth and held securely in place by straps that
velcro�d to the sides of the mask.� She
was new to this game and had never admitted a gag like this into her mouth
before; it had taken awhile to become comfortable and accept the hard, cold black
rubber.� A small, triangular opening in
the mask by her nostrils allowed her to breathe and once she�d recovered from
being fucked so hard, she again was breathing normally through her nose.� She�d been in her dark prison for a long time
now; perhaps he�d kept her there too long?�
He knew that she must be exhausted, for her thigh muscles continually
quivered now from fatigue; but he couldn�t help himself, he always wanted
more.� And the best part was that it
appeared that she had finally accepted the role that they both knew she was
born to play.

&nbsp;

He thought back to when he�d first
decided that he wanted her to do this.�
Actually, it was nothing new---he had always demanded this of his
girlfriends.� It was just that it had
taken him longer than he had thought it would to convince her of the depths of
his needs; but after an initial hesitation, she had meekly accepted the
handcuffs and donned the hood and gag.�
Almost passive by this point in their relationship as she accepted his
dominance, she laid on her back with her knees spread wide and offered him
everything in her now limited world---after some time spent manipulating her
there with his fingers, his tongue and then his mouth, he had finally accepted
her gift for the first time.� 

&nbsp;

His weight on her hips and belly must
have caused her bent knees considerable pain, because she cried out softly as
he lowered himself onto her.� He
remembered how tight she had been.� He
knew that this too must have been painful for her at first; his current lover
was not a large woman and wasn�t equipped by nature to easily handle large
cocks.� Even though he knew that he had
hurt her with his initial penetration, she reacted like a professional,
resolutely and stubbornly accepting him inch by inch until she her vaginal muscles
had stretched enough to finally accommodate his totality.� Buried in her up to his nutsack now, he
started giving her long, slow, deep strokes with his hips.� She began to let down her love juices, and at
the end he�d been sliding in and out with ease, slamming into her soft body
like an iron jackhammer designed in flesh.�
He had finally cum deeply in her vagina, jetting a full load of scalding
hot semen almost into her cervix.� The
way she jumped and shuddered beneath him when he came the first time, he knew
she was enjoying it.

&nbsp;

Her lower back and hips forced into an
arch off the bed by the way he�d tied her feet underneath her buttocks, she
bucked like a maniac at the end, grinding her hips and belly into his at the
moment of his ejaculation, thus making up for her previously uninspired
behavior.� And when he relaxed on her
sweaty abdomen to catch his breath, he discovered that she had difficulty
breathing with his weight resting on her chest and belly; but at that exact
moment at least for him, all was well with the world.� It had been great sex, and even if she hadn�t
responded as enthusiastically as he would have liked in the beginning, he knew
that the end she had taken great pleasure in being thoroughly fucked by him.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

He reveled in the now familiar tired feeling in his groin---he had
enjoyed her helplessness several times already and it was time to savor her
body one last time before the night ended.�
He was curious now because he never knew where relationships like this
would end.� There was always something
missing, but he never for sure what it would be.� It might be conversation or a companionable
silence or it might be something cruel; something�..oriental.� He was just never sure until it happened.

&nbsp;

He approached the bed and gently touched her between her
thighs.� In an attempt at coyness, she
did her best to keep her knees together, but bent and arched as she was, it was
almost impossible for her to keep them tightly closed for long.� She was fatigued and her knees shook a little
from the strain of keeping them together; he easily pushed them apart.� He imagined the triangle between her legs,
the thick hot red hair that had been so soft and silky at first, but which now
was matted and a darker red color, wet and sticky both with her fluids and his
semen as it had drained from within her.�
The area begged to be touched again and he did; and as he stroked her
there, her breathing suddenly changed as he knew it would from smooth, long
inhalations to the quick, shallow gasps of anticipation.� 

&nbsp;

After a moment, she slowly opened up more for him, spreading her
thighs as far apart as her bound ankles would allow.� He stroked the insides of her thighs with his
left hand as his right explored the delights she hid beneath her pubic
hair.� She made small, animal-like noises
of enjoyment between each quick breath as he continued to touch and stroke her
there.� Then he mounted her like a raging
stallion and slow-fucked her for at least twenty minutes before cumming a third
time in her over-flowing pussy.� He knew
she had trouble breathing with all of his weight on her, so he rolled off of
her belly and chest at the end this time.�
He lay next to her gasping; finally his breathing slowed down as he got
his wind back.

&nbsp;

His new girlfriend had tonight played modest at first, her body
language insisting that she had not particularly wanted to play the full game
of sex with him.� And she had teased him
with her supposed reluctance as he had prepared her for their tryst.� Her clothes now in tatters on the floor, she
had assumed her initial bondage on the bed only with difficulty; the position
was complicated and apparently she was not as flexible as they had at first
supposed she might be.� 

&nbsp;

Even naked, wrists cuffed behind her back and the hood on, she
still tried to be the tease as he laid her on the bed that first time.� This annoyed him because he�d gone to a lot
of trouble to ensure that everything was perfect for tonight; he�d finally been
forced to bring out The Discipline to
ensure that she understood how serious his needs were.� The
Discipline was a cord-like whip which resembled a narrow sheet of macram�;
and after he flipped her onto her stomach and used it on the sides of her
buttocks, arms and upper back for a couple of minutes, his girlfriend had again
regained her enthusiasm for him and an appreciation for the preparations he had
made.

&nbsp;

After the way that he fucked her earlier, the anticipation in his
belly and sense of urgency in his mind was gone now; the last time he had
ploughed her had been a slow and easy fuck in order that she might appreciate
it too.� Even bound as she was, he had
felt her body tense beneath his in expectation as his steel hard erection had
been slowly immersed in her belly, gradually burying itself inch by rock solid
inch in the hot, moist crease between her legs.�
Soon he was stopped only by the mysterious fleshy folds at the top of
her vagina; but even as he continued pressing and pushing at the very pinnacle
of her womanhood, she continued to groan with satisfaction.� This last fuck-session had gone on and on and
on.

&nbsp;

But he�d caught his wind now, and after
fucking her a third time, it was time to experiment a little.� She was susceptible to his persuasion and
after a few short moments of his urgings, she consented to the insertions.� He rolled her over onto her belly and worked
on her for a few minutes.� When he was
finished, all that remained to be seen was a thin, wide base plate that
prevented her anus from totally engulfing the plug.� She really did not like this and seemed to
have changed her mind, having tightly clenched her butt cheeks from the
beginning in a futile effort to prevent his success.� However, he was unrelenting in his slow,
irresistible insistence; and forced into immobility, her body had shuddered all
over as the final protective ring of anal muscles that defended her there had
eventually given in to his dominant will.�
He was thrilled at her response, for once her ultimate defenses had been
violated, she made either high-pitched squealing sounds or soft moans the whole
time he had been slowly burying the long rubber butt plug deeply inside her
rectum---it seemed the numerous one and half inch wide rubber balls on the rod
were what had caused most of her opposition, but he didn�t care at this point.� 

&nbsp;

But he wasn�t yet finished.�
Her pussy had been a little sloppy after the last fuck; so even though
her body language let him know that she really wasn�t too happy with this
either, in the end it had been easy to completely introduce her to the
vibrating dildo too.� As a result of his
second insertion, she was currently enjoying a fully buried eight-inch long
penis shaped vibrator that was an inch and a half in diameter.� Here too, she�d been almost painfully shy at
first, but had finally accepted all of it. �The length was perfect as it pretty much
seemed to fill her pussy, but he was a little disappointed in that he�d hoped
to be able to provide a wider shaft for her pleasure.� However, this was the best he could do on so
short a notice.� There were multiple soft
rubber projections along its length and the two �D� batteries that were stacked
inside it one on top of the other ensured her long-lived pleasure as it ran at
the slower of two available speeds.� 

&nbsp;

It was then that he had decided to run a
one-inch wide nylon crotch strap tightly between her legs.� It was firmly secured between her legs,
hooked in back to the waist belt and pulled tightly along the crack of her ass
with enough force to separate her butt cheeks.�
From there it went over her vagina, snugly enough to push apart her
labia to either side, and then it buckled to the waist belt in front just below
her sexy belly button.�� 

&nbsp;

The inside of the crotch strap was graced
with multiple connections for attachments, located and spaced to ensure perfect
placement over each body opening.� His
girlfriend had not really wanted this between her legs or perhaps more
realistically, what she felt it probably represented for the next several
hours; but after wearing it for several minutes, she had finally calmed
down.� 

&nbsp;

His girlfriend�s perineum was rather
small so he had been forced to use the rear snap closest to the middle to
ensure that the butt plug had remained firmly seated.� The other two snaps in front were positioned
so that they could hold a vibrator in place and he�d used the one on the end to
keep that toy firmly anchored.� The strap
worked beautifully, for now as his hand slid up the inside of her thigh and
approached that special place between her legs, he could feel the firm muscles
of her interior upper thigh vibrating at a strong, steady rate in sympathy with
the big vibrator that now filled her vagina.�


&nbsp;

She was young and healthy, and even after being fucked three
times, she had over time still fully responded to his advances upon being
plugged and strapped.� This in spite of
the way that it seemed she had initially tried to reject this particular
circumstance.� It seemed either that she
had extensively leaked from her pussy or she�d cum at least one time.� To him it didn�t matter which it was, for he
caressed the now sopping nylon crotch strap that secured the vibrator and butt
plug so firmly and so deeply in her body cavities.� Both toys had performed as desired; even so,
he still tugged on the wide strap one more time to ensure that it was tight.� And as he did so, she gave out an intensely
personal moan that seemed to come from somewhere deep in her chest.� 

&nbsp;

Her skin glistened with perspiration as he watched her begin the
latest struggle to reclaim from him her vagina and anus; those orifices which
he had conquered and now kept artificially filled for his own
satisfaction.� But as with every other
attempt, she failed this time too; and with that failure and the helplessness
that it represented, he desired this woman even more.� She was his girlfriend; she was defenseless
and vulnerable, she was perfect and she was his.� 

&nbsp;

Her beautiful chest gleamed with a fine dew of sweat as he leaned
over and slowly licked the soft skin between her full breasts.� With that salty taste still strong on his tongue,
he slowly took her left nipple into his mouth.�
She moaned in anticipation, but without vision could not know what he
planned next.� Working the nipple until
it was erect, he lifted the thin chain that rested by her side and laid it on
softly her chest.� On both ends of the
chain were clamps made vicious by small, yet sharp teeth; these he carefully
positioned near each target nipple.� He
grabbed her left breast again and with multiple smooth, firm milking motions
his cupped hand slowly progressed to her nipple in a way that made her full
breast even more engorged with blood and the light pink nipple painfully more
erect.� 

&nbsp;

Her nipple now huge, he firmly squeezed until it was almost flat
and then rolled it several times between his forefinger and thumb.� He knew that she liked this part because his
girlfriend moaned even louder and arched her back to present him even better
access to her breasts.� Finally, he
pinched hard and then applied the clamp to the waiting nipple; her flesh was as
secure now as if he had her in a vise.�
He was disappointed at her muffled scream of pain, but not
surprised---it was okay; even though she was ALMOST perfect, he knew she
wouldn�t want to see him again after this.�
And as much as it pained him to admit it, the reality was that she was
like so many of his previous girlfriends in that she just didn�t appreciate his needs.

&nbsp;

With one nipple captured, it was the work of only moments to bring
her other nipple first to attention and then to heel as he squashed it with the
second clamp.� Both nipples now
decisively imprisoned in a jail that only he controlled, he stood back and
watched as she arched her back again and again, trying to declare to him the
throbbing, wonderfully overwhelming sensations she felt.� With the gag in her mouth preventing her from
fully proclaiming her emotions, it must have felt like every sensation she
perceived was dammed up inside her body, continually building pressure as they
was unable to find release or freedom; soon she was twisting from side to side
as she sought a means to express her passion, but the wrist cuffs held her
securely in the position that was the most provocative for him.� She even rolled onto her stomach at one point
in an attempt, he thought, to perhaps rub and put more pressure on the clamps
she wore.� He cautioned her at this point
for he did not want her to permanently injure herself.� The jaws of the clamps were tight and the
teeth sharp enough that she could inadvertently remove a nipple if she
continued.�� 

&nbsp;

Finally regaining control of her emotions, she rolled onto her
side and within moments she was on her back again; huffing for air through her
nose and waiting for him with knees spread wide, offering herself to him once
more.� Only her head moved now, the
faceless black hood making deliberate and rhythmic back and forth movements
that were as cadenced as a clock slowly running down.

&nbsp;

His girlfriend was bound and helpless now and he knew that what he
planned next would be taking advantage of this situation----and it definitely
wouldn�t win him another date.� On the
other side of the room, a six-foot long piece of medium-thickness manila rope
lay coiled under a double-pulley that had been discretely anchored in the
ceiling about two feet from the wall.� A
relatively thin nylon line was already threaded through and the part hanging
down from the pulley ended in a small metal hook.� The other end of the nylon rope from the
pulley was tied off on the wall below.�
Next to it, a four-foot long piece of one-inch thick polished maple wood
with metal hooks on one end leaned against the wall, along with two short
pieces of wood that had been connected at one end by a set of jawed
hinges.� 

&nbsp;

He quickly unhooked the crotch strap from between her legs and
then gently removed the two moist and slick toys that had been buried from his
sight inside her for so long.� Her now
huge nipples showing darker bruises from the clamps, he grabbed his girlfriend
under her armpits and dragged her off of the bed, carrying her over to the wall
where he left her lying again on her back near the hemp rope.� He now ran the coarse rope under her right
armpit from the back and around her chest above her breasts before running it
back under her left armpit from the front.�
Turning her on her side, he tied the loose end to the rope at his
girlfriend�s back, resulting in a fairly loose loop around her upper body with
the free end in back.� 

&nbsp;

Taking this free end, he now made a strong loop in the end of the
rope and connected it to the metal hook of the rope that ran through the pulley
in the ceiling.� Untying the thinner
nylon line from the wall, he pulled on the rope and raised his girlfriend
almost off of the floor before he tied the rope to the waiting wall hook.� Grimacing in no little pain, he made a mental
note to buy thicker rope for the pulley next time since it would be easier on
his hands.� 

&nbsp;

She was now facing the wall and even though her feet were pulled
back and tied to her wrists, she was on her knees as most of her body weight
was supported by the rope around her chest.�
Her knees were spread in an attempt to maintain her balance against the
rope; standing in back of her, he now took the four foot long piece of wood and
ran it between her thighs from the back and angled it up so that he was able to
hook the far end into the brackets on the wall that began almost a foot higher
than her waist.� Taking a deep breath, he
now lifted up the free end of the wooden piece that ran between her thighs
until he could get the foldable legs of the sawhorse settled in under it to
support the end of the horizontal beam that he held---with this single move,
she had joined a very select club and had begun her ride on a journey that only
a few women have ever truly appreciated.�


&nbsp;

Her knees now off the ground, his lover�s body was uncontrollably
leaning forward as she wobbled on the beam supported only by the rope that ran
around her chest to the pulley; he quickly untied this rope from the wall and
pulled on it to remove any slack.� Still
leaning a little forward, this effort raised her upper torso enough that it now
forced the front-center of her crotch to rest directly on the horizontal
board.� As her full weight finally
settled onto the thin, polished board and brutally pinned her genitalia, she
inhaled mightily through her nose.� As he
watched her chest continue to expand with air seemingly forever, he somehow
sensed a charged pause as if the room itself had sucked in its breath waiting
for her reaction---suddenly her head snapped back involuntarily and she erupted
in a penetrating scream that, even though mostly stifled by the gag, in its
intensity still reminded him of the concussion from a white hot napalm
explosion as it traveled around the room cutting the charged atmosphere like a
whip.

&nbsp;

His girlfriend was a strong woman.�
Surprisingly impassive up to this point behind her concealing mask of
thin rubber, she was suddenly not aloof or emotionally removed from what they
now did together.� She was instantly
committed---her torso was drenched as rivulets of sweat immediately flooded her
white skin and bubbling screams constantly gushed forth without conscious
control as he next tied a rope to her ankles and ran it back to the sawhorse
legs.� When he tied it off, it was the
exact length to ensure that she was always leaning forward in her rope harness,
always just on the verge of viciously pinning her clitoris against the hard
wood.� But the length of the rope ensured
too that she always had a little hope---that if she were just somehow strong
enough, she could always clamp the insides of her thighs against the polished
lumber and perhaps use this anchor to rock back far enough on the board to
spread the majority of her weight over the rear of her pelvis---and as long as
her muscles didn�t give out, she could spare her genitals the public
humiliation of at least some of the pain.�


&nbsp;

In counter-point to the rope around her ankles, he now connected a
thin elastic line from the wall in front of his date to the middle of the chain
that hung from each of her nipples.� The
length of the line had been calculated with exquisite intent; if she leaned
forward as the rope around her ankles dictated, the full weight of her body
crushed her clitoris and labia against the wood.� But the more she leaned back in an attempt to
gain freedom for her sex from the wood, the more brutally her nipples were
pulled almost from her breasts.� 

&nbsp;

He watched her lean back to the point
that her beautiful breasts were dragged out grotesquely by the elastic line as
it stretched from the wall.� This must
have caused her too much pain for she suddenly leaned forward to take all
pressure off of her nipples.� But now she
crushed the front of her vagina under her pelvis and this too must have been
extremely painful, for suddenly she gave out a soft, strangled cry and leaned
back on the board and stretched her tits out of shape again.� He watched her go back and forth a couple of
more times until suddenly she stopped about half way between the extreme of
both positions and now rode the board without moving.� She was totally occupied in doing her best to
achieve an acceptable emotional, psychological and physical balance.� 

&nbsp;

He could hear the short, heaving snorts for air that she took
through her nostrils and he watched the sweat ran off her body in
torrents.� His girl was smart and she had
learned to remain motionless fairly quickly, but he continued to watch for he
knew what inevitably came next.� After a
couple of minutes, he could hear a long, sobbing heartfelt groan emanate from deep
within the bound woman and then a shudder ran through her whole body.� At this point in her ride, he knew the pain
had begun to approach a crescendo and even though the immediate physical
demands were made only on the flesh between her thighs and the nipples on her
breasts, her every slightest movement now brought new complaints from each
nerve in her body.� Now she just sat and
shuddered with every other breath.� 

&nbsp;

With a start, he realized that she was no better than the
others.� He�d helped quite a few females
become familiar with this, his favorite ride; and despite their initial
objections, none of them had ever really been much the worse for wear�perhaps a
little sore for a day or two at the most.�
In fact, a fortunate few were often much more amenable to partying after
they�d had a little taste of the lumber.�
But just like the others, this one had started bucking as soon as
there�d been a little pressure from the wood on her pussy---he wondered how
she�d handle half an hour or so of riding time.�


&nbsp;

But at least for now, she settled down and while she wasn�t moving
around like before, she was now covered in sweat and quivering all over,
shaking like a newborn foal.� Sometimes
she would rock back and forth a little, before becoming motionless again.� Even the slightest shift she made on the
timber was now accompanied by a moan.�
Her head hung on her chest from a neck no longer strong enough to
provide support and at this point, the only visible movement was the shuddering
heave of her clamped breasts as she took one slow breath after another.� He knew the insignificant rocking motion of
her hips was a feeble attempt to find some release from the pain, and he also
knew that it wouldn�t work.� Whether or
not she was one that appreciated the psychological aspects of pain, she had
reached that level on the �exquisite ride�
which begged her to delve into the restricted areas her mind had erected,
forcing her to investigate and explore their limits.� Think of the empty spot in your gums after
the last trip to the dentist and the way you found your tongue exploring the
area again and again seemingly without conscious control, always sucking on the
unfamiliar gap even though you already knew that it ALWAYS made the pain
greater��� This is where she was now, but
times a thousand.

&nbsp;

He thought back as he watched; he had actually only met his
current girlfriend just a few hours before.�
He haunted the parking lots of 24-hour restaurants and convenience
stores in a thirty mile range and was good enough to determine exactly where
the security cameras had gaps in their coverage.� He had first seen her at a truck plaza about
a week ago, walking out of a McDonalds.�
She was wearing a short white and green print summer dress with flat sandals;
her hair had been a raven�s nest of curls that cascaded down her back.� Her pretty face had shown her good
nature.� Like the predator he was, he�d
gone back several times since then hunting her and this evening she had been
back again.� 

&nbsp;

This time she was wearing tight low-rising jeans that accentuated
her long shapely legs, pumps with stiletto heels and a tight pale green top
that emphasized her flat stomach and high, full breasts.� He watched her through the restaurant windows
while she ordered her food; he watched her gather up her hair into a frizzy
pony tail as she waited in line and then capture it with a black nylon
scrunchie she pulled from her bag.� Then
she pulled out a green no-name baseball cap and slipped it onto her head,
pulling the ponytail through the opening at the back.� She had a smile on her face as she exited,
ponytail swinging from side to side as she walked; she was going home after
work and was in a good mood from her banter with the clerk.� It turned out that she was twenty-eight years
old and married---but that didn�t really affect his needs.� 

&nbsp;

It was slightly after dusk and she�d parked about fifty yards from
the burger palace in a darker area under some trees.� He watched her park her older Japanese car
and had backed his car up against the front of hers, using her car to block the
view of his.� She had her fast food now
and wasn�t paying much attention as she walked around the back of her car into
the deep shadows; it took only seconds for the taser to knock her to the
ground, her muscles cramping and spasming and her whole system shutting down as
he hammered her with the low amp, high voltage electricity.� 

&nbsp;

He waited a moment, popping his car trunk open with the remote,
then gave her the juice again.� Her body
arched a second time on the parking lot and her arms and legs played helplessly
like a marionette with the strings cut.�
Her bag of food had spilled away from her car and he could hear the
soft, mewling noises she made.� Within
ninety seconds of first frying her nervous system, she was in the trunk of his
car lying on a cheap plastic painter�s tarp; she was blindfolded, bound and
gagged less than two minutes after that.�
And with this, he took his new girlfriend
home.

&nbsp;

He eventually realized that these dates weren�t always about the
sex, although like any healthy man he appreciated knocking off a good looking
piece of ass fairly regularly.� No, it
wasn�t just about the sex, but rather it had to do with seeing how far he could
push each of his girlfriends into
jumping over the increasingly complex and bizarre sexual and psychological
hurdles that he set for them.� Having
total control over another human being was as addictive as the worst drugs;
there was no twelve-step program for him and it was a monkey that he had yet to
kick.

&nbsp;

But now it was time to end their date.� As usual, he untied the ankle and nipple
lines before he grabbed her around her chest and lifted her off of the horse,
lowering her to the floor on her stomach.�
She cried out softly as he lifted her because he had inadvertently
ground the clamps even more into her nipples.�
He untied the rope from around her chest and unhooked her wrists and
ankles from each other and from the wide belt that girdled her waist, lightly
straightening out her cramped legs.�
There was no fight left in her now; he easily rolled her unresisting
body over before he removed the nipple clamps from her breasts.� She moaned in appreciation as he carried her
back to the bed and gently laid her on her stomach.� After he had warned her to cooperate, he
removed her pumps; it was then a matter of seconds to completely free her
ankles.� From here, he slowly
straightened out each of her legs all the while accompanied by screams of pain
that were muffled by the gag.� Finally,
he uncuffed her wrists and then cuffed them at her side to the belt that she
still wore.

&nbsp;

She lay on her stomach now and he sat down beside her.� Using oil lightly scented of cinnamon and
clove, he began to massage her muscles, rubbing the backs of her cramped thighs
and calves in a manner that informed her that he knew exactly what he was
doing.� He worked a long time on her
knees; massaging and rubbing the joints and the ligaments and cartilage that
connected to the muscles above and below.�
He rubbed the bottoms of her feet and the backs of her calves before he
began on her neck, arms and her upper and lower back and then her butt.� The tight, finely pored skin of her back and
ass was a brighter red and lightly raised where he�d been forced to whip
her---he massaged the healing oils in here too.�
And when he was done he ordered her to rollover, and when she did, he
began on her thighs and feet and abdomen.�
When it came to her breasts, he was gentle, his hands soft and
knowing.� For here too, her skin was
bruised and tender.

&nbsp;

She was blind and immobilized, helpless before this man and
everything that he did to her.� Although
she had tried to be strong, it was when he began to massage the ravaged area
between her thighs that she began to sob uncontrollably.� She was bleeding a little from her vagina and
as gentle as his hands were there, the obscene way that they explored and
fondled her labia; softly rubbing the bruised femininity that he�d taken by
force as his own---the way his fingers mixed the innocent oil that would
normally smell so good to her with the devil�s own seed now draining onto the mattress
from where he had first left it in her belly---it all became too much for
her.� Unaffected by her tears, he
continued his massage and let her cry herself out.� 

&nbsp;

After thirty minutes of massaging her body, the rapist helped the
woman stand while he stripped the bedding and rubber mattress cover off of the
bed upon which he had so brutally taken her multiple times and threw it in the
washing machine.� All bedding removed
from the mattress, he now led her over to the shower stall.� Head still covered in rubber and her hands
bound to the belt around her waist, he stood in the stall beside her under the
needle spray.� Although her legs were
shaky, he made the woman stand with her legs spread while he liberally soaped
her body twice, thoroughly cleansing her of any evidence he might have left on
or inside her.� He paid special attention
to her vagina, running his soapy fingers deeply inside her numerous times
before he used something that felt to her like a large turkey baster and
performed a quick and dirty douche, flushing her with a diluted vinegar
solution that he knew would both sting and feel like an astringent.� Now to her final humiliation, he began on her
rectum.

&nbsp;

When finished, he led her out of the shower stall and toweled her
off before making her sit on the edge of the bed while he dried and then
dressed himself.� All fight now gone from
this woman, he now easily fitted her pumps back on her feet.� After wiping her shoes to ensure that he had
left no fingerprints, he then patiently walked around the room and gathered up
all of her clothing.� Checking the room
one more time, he donned an inexpensive pair of leather gloves and put her
clothes in a plastic garbage bag.� The
man picked up the bag containing her clothes and led her naked out of his house
and into the dark night.� After giving
her a final warning to cooperate, he used pieces ripped from a disposable roll
of duct tape to bind her elbows together behind her back before he removed the
handcuffs.� Standing behind her, he taped
her wrists together before he removed the rubber hood and gag, and then quickly
inserted a cheap two-inch rubber ball in her mouth.� He now used multiple short pieces of duct
tape to cover both her mouth and eyes.� 

&nbsp;

The man had previously purchased an inexpensive terry cloth robe
and he now draped this over her shoulders and tied the belt around her waist
before leading her to the trunk of his car, where he gently laid her down on
the cheap plastic tarp.� Closing the
trunk and throwing the bag that contained her clothes into the back seat, he
started the car and drove forty miles to a dark stretch of secondary road where
he left her slumped over bonelessly on a deserted bus stop bench.� 

&nbsp;

He thought about the beautiful redhead for a second and gave her a
fleeting glance as he left, then he never again thought about his nameless �date�.�
There was nothing of him on or in her, she had never met him before or
seen his face and she had no idea where he had taken her.� And even as he let her go free, he knew that
she would always be his prisoner from this night on.� The evening this beautiful woman had just
experienced ensured that he would always be alive inside her, crawling to the
surface at any moment, resurrecting yet again everything she had endured under
his guidance.� She had seen a lot of
darkness tonight in a short period of time, but his experience and training
told him that there would be dreams and nightmares.� And when they came, they would be a part of
her for a long time---of this he had no doubt.�
Depending upon how strong she was, he knew he would be fucking her every
night for much of the rest of her life; her mind would guarantee that.� But he could care less.

&nbsp;

As he left her slumped over in the darkness, he marveled at how
relaxed he felt.� He was becoming tired
now as he slowly came down from his endorphin high and he felt an enjoyable
feeling of fatigue in his groin from the strenuous sexual activity.� Driving aimlessly, he stopped at a 7-11
twenty miles from where he�d dropped her off and purchased a coffee before
throwing the bag containing her clothes into the open trash dumpster on the
side.� Twelve miles further down the
road, he stopped at another convenience store and purchased a second cup of
coffee.� Along the way, he had thrown the
cheap leather gloves and the roll of duct tape out of the window and into heavy
bushes on the side of the road.� At the
second coffee shop, he disposed of the plastic that had lined his trunk.� 

&nbsp;

Famished, he finally stopped at a local pancake house for a
well-deserved breakfast; there he ate a full stack with bacon and eggs on the
side, along with three cups of coffee.�
He thought about the night�s activities.�
He knew that while he might be thought extreme and deviant by some, he
was not unsophisticated either.� And
while many of his acts might be considered predatory, he was also well
acquainted with the more accepted concepts of adoration and love, hunger and
lust, giving and taking.� He was, if the
truth be known, no less sexually opportunistic than most other men his age wanted to be with a beautiful
woman.� It went with the territory, as
does being a closet romantic; and to him only ideologues would see a
contradiction between the two.

&nbsp;

Pleasantly exhausted now, he was ready to sleep the weekend away
after he cleaned up the room back at home, hosed the floor down, and put the
gag and rubber hood into disinfectant to soak for a day.� The room had been designed with ease of
cleaning foremost in mind and he was thankful for his foresight.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Chapter 2: We are the people that our parents warned us about; Jimmy Buffet.

&nbsp;

My given name is Christian and that�s ironic, given my past.� I�m forty-five years old, unmarried and a
private investigator.� There�s little
excitement in my life now and I like it that way.� I own a small detective agency a little west
of Savannah and this is the story about a woman that does a few things that are
considered illegal and how her life, and mine, end up being changed
forever.� 

&nbsp;

My office faces out of the ground floor of a two-story building in
a low-rent part of the suburbs.� It�s me
and Freddy, the junior partner that I feel like I�ve been training for half my
life and Nan, a secretary/receptionist that�s been with me since I started.� 

&nbsp;

My business is generally built around wealthy older women; men
still chase them for their money and believe it or not there are quite a few
divorces at that age.� To me the world is
linear, concise, symmetrical.� I don�t do
the unconfirmed fuzzy-logic trail that is created by an ethereal trip through
the data banks imprinted on the servers of a thousand search engines; rather it
was the faded ink-on-paper truth of real history that interested me.� I hire temporary help as I need it to tail
unfaithful companions, investigate the backgrounds of new or potential partners,
etc.� One thing that I�ve begun to notice
is that some of my clients, many in their upper seventies, are just too well
built.� As Dustin Hoffman had been
advised in The Graduate,
�Plastics.�� Just a different kind.� I had nothing against cosmetic surgery, but
past a certain age, discriminatory or not, it was beginning to creep me out.

&nbsp;

Some of my elderly clients learn of me through word of mouth.� Others wind up going to city employees for
help, but they rarely get it.� Because of
my work, I�ve developed a few good contacts in various parts of the city
government; the Department of Transportation, the City Comptroller, the Courts
and the District Attorney�s office.� This
is how a guy like me scares up a significant part of my business with the older
women.� A paid someone tells us early on
about a troubled someone or perhaps even one with just a few questions to which
she can�t get straight answers; we get in touch and offer to help.� Sometimes it works out and sometimes it
doesn�t; and even if it does seem a little like ambulance chasing, we still
make enough to eat and pay a few bills. 

&nbsp;

Generally, I only pay for information on cases I take.� Sometimes however, I pay for information that
I know I won�t be able to use professionally, because every now and then I have
been known to apply a little pressure to a dirtbag on the side---like I say,
I�ve got to eat.� 

&nbsp;

I�ve got a good education, but I do what I do because I like
working alone and I hate being told what to do by others�.that and I know that
I�m still not right from what happened a couple of years ago.� I�m pretty self-sufficient and I know that
I�m considered manipulative; I�m generally not very social and although not
particularly confrontational anymore, I don�t take a lot of crap from people either.� I�ve done some things for which I still pay,
mostly at night.� And if there is such a
thing as karma, it�s going to take me a long time to pay off the debt I�ve
built up.� Society draws certain lines in
order to keep civilization working; my strength and my weakness is that I�ve
found that I�ll cross in a heart beat most lines that define civilized
behavior.� So far, there have only been
few that I won�t---or at least I haven�t----broken yet.� The problem is that as I cross more and more
lines, the less humanity it seems remains inside me.

&nbsp;

Even though I have done some awful things to people innocent and
guilty, as odd as it may sound, I still consider myself as still retaining the
vestiges of an old-fashioned honor.� I
have collected many women and they will testify that I�ll fuck them in a
heartbeat and I�ll fuck you over too if necessary, but if I give you my word, I
do the best I can to keep it.� Needless
to say, I look at this as a definite weakness and try not to indulge it too
often.

&nbsp;

One of my best contacts is an old man that works as a clerk in the
DA�s office.� I throw him a few bucks
every now and then---you might call this a left handed retainer---and he calls
when he thinks that he has something that might be interesting.� If it pans out, Christmas for him comes
early.� One day a while ago he called
with some details that he overheard about a case that the DA�s office was
considering.� It involved a female
teacher that was rumored to have had sex with at least one young male
student.� Nothing had broken yet, and the
investigation was about half over; there was talk now about bringing her in for
interrogation; and depending upon the answers they got, they would consider
pressing charges.� According to what he
was hearing, the suspect was young, attractive and guilty as hell.

&nbsp;

To me, from the little that I�d been told, this particular
situation didn�t seem like it was anything with which we�d get involved
professionally---it sounded like she needed one hell of a good lawyer, not a
PI.� But for some reason, his story about
the wandering teacher interested me personally.�
I didn�t ask him anymore questions---if I followed-up, digging for more
information, I�d have had to pay him a little something�and I didn�t want him
to think that I had any interest in this case.�
So I thanked him and let it go; instead asking him about another case on
which he�d been feeding me information.� 

&nbsp;

In a way, I felt like a shark that had sensed just the slightest
whisper of blood in the water; for some reason, this woman�s difficulties
intrigued me�.a lot.� If even half of
what he told me was true, she�d put herself in a tough situation.� I knew that this would be considered taking
advantage, but my antennas were up and I was intrigued.� With any luck, I had enough from my
conversation with the old man that I could find this teacher on my own.� A young, attractive woman in trouble?� I knew that what I was contemplating was just
as low as any other thing I had recently done.�
But like I said, my morals are nothing if not flexible, so I thought I�d
spend a few hours and check her out on my own time. 

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

A little more about me; I�ve owned my own house outside of the big
city for over a decade now.� I live on
fifteen acres of land that backs up to a medium-sized lake near a small town
just west of Savannah.� The closest
neighbor is over a quarter of a mile away and I have a good reputation with the
few people that knew me semi-well.� My
face is fucked up, I have a 100% disability from the government and there is a
thirty month or so gap ending about a year ago in which I had to lease out the
house, but that hadn�t attracted any attention as far as I could tell.� 

&nbsp;

My town isn�t a tourist trap.�
The reason I live here was because I felt an affinity for the
place.� It seemed to embrace the
complexities of the soul---the contrary aspects within most of us that are
linked inextricably to the human condition.�
Subcultures of all kinds flourished here, from witches of every
persuasion to tattoo artists to gays to musicians.� Outsiders were insiders here.� Marginality ruled.� It was a great place to live for people of
my�.bent.

&nbsp;

I had to work in the city, but I didn�t have to live there.� How do
people live like that?� Cheek by
jowl.� Sounds of their lives commingled
into one vast blare.� Everyone knowing
their business and them knowing everyone else�s, without one minute�s privacy
or peace.� They all must have developed a
zoo-animal like mentality, I decided, living their lives as their instincts
compelled them without caring who saw what.

&nbsp;

I had realized one thing by the time I was released from the
military hospital; after everything I�d seen over the past few years, I was
more than ready to settle down.� Although
I also recently realized that I was tired of being alone, I had also come to
appreciate that I was also damned unlucky in finding my soulmate.� 

&nbsp;

The problem is that during that two and a half year hiatus, I
discovered that I had personality �glitches�;
I was considered �demanding� and had
a few �violent� streaks.� I have many, many flaws and these were some
of those things that I have trouble talking about.� But these defects always got in the way of
any relationships that I might try to develop with women.� 

&nbsp;

I generally avoided the BDSM groups in town because the cops watched
them a little closer than normal.� While
I have the same problems that a lot of guys these guys have, I think I just
understand them better than most.� I�m
sexually dominant and experienced enough to show this only to willing ladies
that have the same interests---or those who have no other option except to join
in.� I can play neutral for weekends or
perhaps even a little longer, but for long term relationships---this is an
issue.� Many women that are initially
interested---or even willing to be experimental---still aren�t ready for what I
want.� And I had never found one that
made me want to change.

&nbsp;

In addition to certain one night �dates of duress�, over the last year I also used my professional
abilities to pick up a few women on the side.�
I have collected only the finest examples available to a man in my
position.� I have a private museum in my
head of all of these women.� Of the women
I gathered, some were fantastic and some were unusual; and they all either
surrendered or screamed; a few times both.�
But all performed to my rigorous standards.� 

&nbsp;

It is true that these relationships ended badly, with the majority
of the women acting as if I was an animal, but to me this was a slander.� For I felt I was more like honey bee---all
that I asked was a little sweet nectar from each flower I collected, with no
lasting harm offered to almost anyone.

&nbsp;

The truth is that I wasn�t looking for a wife, just a body to help
me find release.� All of these women were
beautiful to me.� But because of the very
way that they came to my attention, I knew that many were flawed in their own
right.� I took no sense of pride in the
fact that I had used a little, shall we say �pressure� to ensure their uninhibited cooperation---and their
silence afterwards.� But after being alone
for most of my adult life, I had finally decided that if I couldn�t find my
forever and ever love, I would take what I wanted---when I wanted it.� And this teacher might very well be my next
Barbie Dream Date.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Chapter 3: I have found little that is &quot;good&quot; about human beings on the
whole. In my experience most of them are trash, no matter whether they publicly
subscribe to this or that ethical doctrine or to none at all. That is something
that you cannot say aloud, or perhaps even think; Sigmund Freud.

&nbsp;

It took me a week to find the right school.� It was full of rumors, of course, but hard
information was difficult to obtain.� And
since I was working part-time and keeping a low profile, even with the old
man�s initial clues it still took me another couple of weeks to get her
name.� The cops were certainly
investigating now and the last thing I wanted was to have my name being
bantered about in the cop�s locker room.�
Besides, once I had her name, it didn�t take long to get pretty much
everything else that was available on her.�


&nbsp;

According to her colleagues she was competent and authoritarian, a
controlling woman that always had to be in charge.� But her personality had changed over the last
six months or so.� Her confidence seemed
to have fled and she didn�t act quite as sure of herself as she had
earlier---it was as if she were under a lot of pressure or something.� Not particularly religious before, she also
began attending church again fairly regularly.�


&nbsp;

Even as she sometimes came off as a little distant to her
colleagues, the male teachers to a man found her both disturbing and
captivating at the same time.� One of the
men said that while she was still young, she reminded him somehow of the older
women in the business world that always tried to downplay their
sensuality.� As a result, she emitted
controlled vibes of extreme attractiveness, but which were oddly vacant of
sexual overtones.� My mother, I�m sure,
would have simply said that he was describing a strong willed, well-bred lady
who believed that there was a time and a place for everything.

&nbsp;

In any case, most of the female teachers that knew her wouldn�t
talk initially, for from the first moment that they met her, they hated
her.� Most women did instinctively.� To a woman, they described her as being
beautiful, but as also being totally aware of how far her beauty could take
her.� They felt as though she could take
whatever she wanted, or whoever she wanted, and they had no defenses.� I don�t think she was necessarily a bad
person, but rather the women had been afraid that she was about ready to get
rid of her husband; and if this happened, every married teacher with whom I
talked had feared that her husband would be served up next on the barracuda�s
plate.

&nbsp;

This woman was organized to a fault; I had no doubt that she was
the type that at eighteen would�ve had her future planned to the n�th
degree.� Attractive, ambitious, educated
and manipulative, she had the choice of just about any man to marry.� But after graduating from the university at Lexington, she eventually settled on an attractive
guy five years her senior.� He was
described by most of the people that knew him as nice enough, but weak; a man
that would be easily manipulated by a woman like her.� A lawyer, apparently she figured him as a
superstar, a fast riser in the corporate world.�
But drugs had sidetracked any visions of an early partnership and
eventually he was asked to leave.� Now he
was a legal hack; quite a comedown in just three or four years.� As a result, legal positions were tough to
find and even tougher to keep; they�d moved twice in the last five years, both
of them changing jobs each time.

&nbsp;

Even though she came from what I could call an �average� background, her history read
like an interesting mix of middle class values and trailer park trash,
something that might have been written by a novelist with less than mediocre
skills.� Retired now, her parents had
been hard workers, owned their own home and had attended church regularly, as
did she until her mid-teens.� Extremely
na�ve as a young girl into her mid-teens, before graduating from high school,
she had also made a couple of appearances as a model in biker magazines.� 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

It�s funny how people can plant ideas in your
head.� As a young girl of fourteen, I
remember looking down at my legs, crossed neatly under the school cafeteria
table.� I remember seeing them, crossed
primly at the ankles, and thinking; what do nice legs look like?� I smoothed down my skirt and moved my knees
apart so that I could see my thighs a little more clearly.� I turned them so that I could see the calf
and the little tautness when I flexed my feet.�
I wondered if �nice legs� looked anything like my legs.� .

&nbsp;

My mother was no help in this subject area.� I was young and you don�t have to understand
sex to want to do it.� So say the birds
and bees.� At 16, I was the worst
combination you could imagine---ignorant of the nuts and bolts and fascinated
as the day is long.� 

&nbsp;

At first the doctors tried to get me to say that it
had been a rape.� Why else would a girl
of sixteen allow five teenage boys to do something like that to her, if it
hadn�t been rape?� Unless she was crazy,
of course.� I listened to this with a
dreamy sort of puzzlement.� Why were they
focusing on that part of what happened?�
Was that part wrong too?� In the
end, I�d have saved myself a lot of problems if I agreed with them and said it
had been rape.� But that would have been
a lie.� I let them do it to me.� I�d wanted it maybe more than the boys
did.� I�d welcomed them into that van,
parked down the country lane.� 

&nbsp;

It was one of those misty summer evenings and in the
back of the van the old tartan blanket smelled of grass and engine oil.� I took off all of my clothes and lay down on
it and opened my legs.� One by one, they
got inside and took their turns, making the van creak on its rusty axles.� 

&nbsp;

�Didn�t anyone talk about protection?� the nurse
wanted to know.� But I wasn�t going to
tell her the truth, that I really didn�t know what a contraceptive was, that I
hadn�t known it was wrong, that my mother would have rather died than talk to
me about these things.� And I wasn�t
going to let her go on and on about my stupid ignorance.� 

&nbsp;

The doctors said it was all about self control.� �We all have impulses, everyone has
urges.� They are what make us human.� The key to a happy and balanced life is
learning to control them.�� 

&nbsp;

But there wasn�t much I could do then about putting
things right.� You can�t mend something
without practicing, and I knew I wouldn�t have opportunity for that for awhile.� I didn�t dare tell the doctors how much I
wished I could have a boyfriend, someone to go to bed with: I knew if I said
anything, they�d tell me my outrageous impulses were the root of a greater
evil, that I was walking around with a wolf inside me.� I listened to all of the lessons about
personal dignity and about self-respect, all the complex stuff about consent
and self-control.� But as soon as they
let me go and I wasn�t being watched every five minutes, I began my own guilty
experiments.� I soon knew how to make
myself cum, and although I never squatted over a mirror, I was sure that no
girl on earth ever had got to know the dark tract between her legs the way I
knew mine.� Sometimes I�d wonder about
the wolf.� I was afraid that one day I�d
reach down there and my fingers would brush over its wet nose.� 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

How she�d hooked up with grease like that was anybody�s guess, but
I�m sure that she�d gotten whatever it was that she was after.� It seemed that that was the way she was---as
she got older, she�d want something and then she�d go out and get it.� Since that time, she�d matured and become
more careful about everything she did, even to the point of buying back the
negatives to most of her earlier photo shoots.�


&nbsp;

Another time, she posed for a cheesy home video wearing nothing
but skimpy underwear and thigh highs.�
She�d tried to recover that too; good luck---it was already on the
internet.� Lucky for her it was dark and
grainy, and didn�t show any more of her face than the typical homemade soft
porn movie.� Now she�d somehow jumped the
rails again, but this time it was different and she was in way over her
head.� It was like a screw had come loose
and she�d gone diagonal to her previously well-controlled life.

&nbsp;

From the little that I had been able to find out so far, this
woman was clearly unhappy, maybe even emotionally disturbed.� I didn�t know why she hadn�t already divorced
her husband and moved on; hitched to a man that now embarrassed her and that
had no prospect of ever giving her the things she felt she deserved, a man she
didn�t love and didn�t respect, her life had taken turns on which she had not
planned.� I don�t know, perhaps that was
part of the reason that she�d stooped to offering herself to her students.� After I stumbled across a student that liked
hash, I�d even figured out with whom she was supposed to have done the wet and
nasty.� The more I learned of this woman,
the more complicated she became.� She
soon became a challenge and I began to spend more time than I had planned digging
into her past.

&nbsp;

In the course of my investigation, I had been able to obtain a
copy of the school�s previous yearbook.�
This gave me the opportunity to see a couple of pictures of this
woman.� Wow!� Most of the pictures were black and white;
the only color photo was of the girl�s JV soccer team where she had been one of
the assistant coaches.� The first picture
in the yearbook made her look like one of those cold Nordic-type blondes.� Later photos showed her smiling and she
looked like a different person.� 

&nbsp;

Into sports, she had shapely, strong looking legs and a nice
athletic build.� Wearing a baseball cap
in the single color shot of her in the book, her face was shaded.� While it was taken from too far away to tell
for sure, I imagined icy-blue eyes to go along with all of that white-blonde
hair.� All in all, a very attractive
woman in her mid-twenties with a look on her face that told the world she was
just starting out with her life.� A pity
she�d already fucked it up big-time.

&nbsp;

know how to lie well; Samuel Butler.

&nbsp;

It was 10 AM on a Wednesday early in December and I
was finally ready to talk with her.� The
weather was cold and blustery and threatening rain.� The wind was blowing and heavy storms were
forecast for the weekend and early next week.�


&nbsp;

I knew in the back of my mind that I�d already delayed setting up
our first meet longer than I should, since I imagined that the DA was just
about ready to indict her.� I�d had her
cell phone number for a couple of weeks now, but had held off calling until I
had all of the facts and everything was ready.�
Really, I knew that this had just been an excuse to delay.� It was safer and much more enjoyable thinking
about this odd woman than in putting my plan into action.� Despite what my past might imply, I was not
the macho type that rushed headlong into dangerous situations.� Rather, I was the type that planned and
schemed, only acting when everything possible had been accounted for.� I think she and I were a lot alike in many
ways.

&nbsp;

I knew from her schedule that she was between classes right now,
so I dialed from one of the few public pay phones that still existed.� A female answered in low tones on the third
ring.� The voice on the other end was
distinctive: precise and educated, a pleasant yet cool voice that carried both
authority and intelligence---it reminded me somehow of a young Katherine
Hepburn.� �This is Rebecca Denholm.�

&nbsp;

�Ms. Denholm,� I went on, �my name is George Langhorn.� I�m a partner in the legal firm Fisher and
Beane and I have a proposition for you that I feel would be most beneficial to
you.� Perhaps we could meet for lunch
today and we could----�

&nbsp;

Her voice now took on that cold impersonal tone that tells you the
other person is just going through the act of being courteous; that they have
already forgotten you and proceeded to the next subject in their busy
life.� �I have no idea,� she cut me off,
�of what you are talking about and have no need to meet with you or anyone
else.� I�m not sure what you�re selling,
but I�m sure that you can find someone else to listen to a proposition from
you.� But I assure you that I am too busy
and in no mood to meet with you today or any other day.� Thank you and good day, Mr. Langhorn.�

&nbsp;

Her voice was low now and firm, that of a person not accustomed to
being interrupted or questioned.� This
was the payoff.� If she responded, then
the rumors were true and she was in a shitload of trouble even if she didn�t
yet know it.� �Ms. Denholm,� I cut in
before she could hang up, �it will take ten seconds for you decide whether or
not you need to know more.� Please listen
carefully.� Right now, the District
Attorney is preparing to file suit against you for having sex with a
minor.� If this charge is untrue, then
please hang up on me.� But if this charge
has any merit at all and you want to beat it, then I suggest that you listen to
me.�� 

&nbsp;

There was silence on the phone for over half a minute.� Then she came back, �I�m�..I don�t know what
you�re talking about.�� There was no
outrage here.� Instead her voice had
changed, now taking on an uncertain quality.�
I would later realize that for the first two days that we were together,
this was perhaps one of the few times that she did not seem to be an Alpha in
every detail.

&nbsp;

Okay, I thought to myself, guilty as charged.� �Ms. Denholm, I think that my office can help
you in this matter.� I�d like to meet you
for lunch today and we can discuss your situation.�

&nbsp;

There was silence for a moment and she had recovered her composure
when she came back, �I already have plans for lunch today, Mr. Langhorn.� Tomorrow would be better for me.�

&nbsp;

I wasn�t in the mood to wait and I wanted to see how far I could
push �Becky�.� I smiled to myself because I knew that this
was a woman that would hate to be called Becky.� �Ms. Denholm, I�m sorry, but it�s either
today or we can�t help you.�

&nbsp;

After another awkward moment of silence, she answered, �Uhhhmmm,
okay.� I guess I can cancel my lunch
plans for today.� How do I recognize
you?� Where do we meet and when?�� Again, the tone of voice and the way she
asked the questions made it clear that she was used to being in charge and
wanted me to feel that she was doing me a favor by meeting with me.

&nbsp;

I gave her directions and the time to meet and then hung up.� Even if she wanted to, I didn�t think that
I�d given her enough time to go to the police with a complaint about me before
we met for lunch.� And she certainly
wasn�t going to be telling any of her co-workers about our meeting.� 

&nbsp;

This could get interesting, I thought to myself as I wiped my
fingerprints from the phone.� We�ll see
where this went at lunch and I�d play it from there.� Since I didn�t want anyone to know that I�d
met with her, I�d chosen to meet Rebecca in a small, out of the way caf� that
was about a thirty minute drive from the school on a good day.� 

&nbsp;

I drove to where we were to meet and it was a glorious day to be
outside.� Although cool and a little
breezy, the sun was shining like it had just been created.� I hit green all of the way and as I fiddled
with the radio dial, I kept hitting all of my favorite songs.� It was that kind of day.

&nbsp;

The caf� was far enough away that it was inconvenient for teachers
from her school to use for lunch, and it was quite crowded with young
housewives mixed with the not-yet fully successful business types on a quick
lunch break; the background noise was loud and quite appropriate for my
needs.� There were neither security
cameras at the caf� nor any nearby ATM�s or parking garages from which security
video might be pulled---it was perfect.� 

&nbsp;

I was seated in a small private area off to the side; the nearest
tables were vacant and my seat was such that I could watch the entrance.� The windows were mirrored so that while I
could see out, no one could see inside the caf�.� Handling only the edges to avoid leaving my
fingerprints, I�d already put one of the phony business cards that I�d had
printed between her table setting; the card indicating that I was a partner at
Liebnowitz and Fisher, a medium-sized liberal law firm in Savannah that
specialized in unorthodox and often unpopular legal cases.� 

&nbsp;

The cell phone was a throwaway, the kind you can buy in cash with
a false name and toss away after you use up your minutes.� No way to trace it back to me.� It was this phone number that I had put on
the fake card.� And if she called the
Liebnowitz and Fisher number that I�d given her to check on me, I was pretty sure
that I would be able to fool her over the phone.� My briefcase was placed fairly close to the
chair that I wanted her to take; inside was a tape machine that would record
everything that we said.� While I knew
that there had been no time for her to go to the police, I didn�t feel like
taking a chance on her thinking too clearly right now either so I planned to
push her fairly hard, keeping her panicked and a little rattled.� 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Chapter 5: Rarely
do great beauty and great virtue dwell together: Petrarch.

&nbsp;

I�d gone through two coffees (cream, no sugar) when I finally saw
her park her car and walk towards the caf�.�
I leaned over and turned on the tape recorder in my briefcase.� The breeze in the parking lot blew her hair.� As she entered, she stopped and removed her
overcoat and shook her head to re-arrange her hair.� Finally she looked around for me.� I stood and waved and she started towards me.

&nbsp;

Because of my investigations, I�d been prepared for the �Denholm lilt�.� While not apparently aware of it herself,
Rebecca�s walk was a rhythm of beauty to every man that saw it.� Even though her shoulders never varied from
facing squarely in the direction in which she moved, everything around her
belly and hips went from side to side in an intensely erotic sway; every male
at the school had discussed it at one time or another, even coming up with a
name just to describe it.� From the
front, it was just an amazing gliding motion.�
From the back, it was mesmerizing.�
Words failed me for the view from the sides.� Everyone to whom I had talked agreed that the
young girls at school had spent countless hours trying to copy it with little
success.� Most men could not watch her
walk without thinking of her naked beneath her clothes. �Most women felt her walk should not be
allowed.� It was totally natural, and she
never thought twice about it---but ten billion women would kill to have it.� But I could have told them, either you had it
or you didn�t.

&nbsp;

She was one of these people to whom the camera added ten or
fifteen pounds, so that in person she was always a little more slender than you
first thought.� Don�t get me wrong.� If she was not the most attractive woman I�d
ever met, certainly she was one of the top two or three.� But it was only in a photo that her looks
took on the quality of a goddess.� 

&nbsp;

I knew she normally tended to wear more conservative clothing to
work, and today was no different.� She
wore a rich-looking dark blue woolen skirt suit that consisted of a short slim
skirt that was vented up the back and a matching jacket over a rather sheer
white blouse.� 

&nbsp;

As she smoothly worked her between the
tables, I could see that the jacket was fitted to emphasize her slim waist and
the skirt was tight enough to emphasize her full, muscular buttocks.� I am aware that deep within their brains,
there were programmed into Homo sapiens certain body ratios that were
associated with fertility.� Men seemed to
equate these hour-glass figures with mating behavior; God knows, I certainly
knew that I found hers inspirational in that regard.

&nbsp;

Her jewelry consisted of long gold earrings that dangled and
flashed in the sun, a faux-pearl necklace and a simple gold wedding band.� Her legs were bare to the weather and the
only acknowledgement to being a working woman seemed to be dark blue pumps with
sensible two inch heals.� 

&nbsp;

She was perhaps as beautiful a woman, in an unusual way, as any I
have ever seen.� Her blouse was little
inappropriate for a teacher and I am sure she never took her jacket off while
in the classroom.� While her bosom was of
average size, her breasts appeared firm and rode high on her chest.� She had a tiny waist and a flat belly, all
leading to very long, shapely legs.� It
was winter and her skin seemed almost as pure a white as her shoulder length
hair, which was parted down the middle.�
She was wearing sunglasses, but gave off nevertheless, an immediate
impression of vitality and contained energy.�


&nbsp;

She draped her jacket over a spare chair and stood at the table
for a minute viewing me behind her sunglasses without moving so that I could
get a good look at her.� I think that she
did this on purpose; I think that she was quite vain of the way she
looked.� 

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

He�d shaken my hand as I
arrived at his table.� I felt a quick
flutter of nervousness in my stomach as I looked at Mr. Langhorn.� The way that he had pointed to the chair that
he wanted me to occupy made me think for no good reason that he was one of
those men that always had to make a point of appearing in control no matter
where they are.� He was a big man, about
six-two, and looked like he was in good shape.�
Dark hair, neatly cut, a good-looking all-American face, what looked
like well-developed arms, trim, neat, clean-shaven.� No obvious tattoos or piercings, he must have
been somewhere in his early to middle forties, but it was hard to tell because
of the smoothness of his face and the way that he wore his hair.

&nbsp;

I put my coat over a spare
chair and stood for a moment, trying to get my composure back.� The revelation that he knew anything about my
private life---indeed, that he�d been able to learn anything about my
private life almost made me gag.� I
suddenly felt cold and somehow soiled, as though I�d come into my bedroom and
found him picking through my underwear.� But
if there was a chance that he could help me get out of the fix that I had so
stupidly gotten myself into, then I was ready to listen. 

&nbsp;

I knew that cheats always looked for some sort of justification or
rationalization for their actions more than anything else.� And I knew that they usually found a way out
in their own mind so that they could justify not feeling any guilt.� But I couldn�t do that anymore.� I was in trouble---everything was my fault
and I knew that I would have to live with it.�
How could I have been so stupid again?�
Even though I was a sensual person and at one time had loved having sex
with men, I had never been the type of woman that thought with my pussy.� But I couldn�t believe how much of a mess
that I�d made out of my life because of sex and cheating.� 

&nbsp;

I had been frustrated with
my husband, but that was no excuse.� I�d
had a little too much wine to drink after work and had gone back to school to
grade some papers.� One of the boys had
come in late and we had talked; what started as a one-time physical release had
unfortunately led to a couple of other times.�
Then I�d shut it down and it was over, but that didn�t make a difference
because the gossip was never done.� I
think I loved teaching, but I felt so detached from that world now, one that
was once my home away from home.� How
simple it would be to attempt to merge back into that world and pretend that
nothing had happened.� But I couldn�t.

&nbsp;

I couldn�t justify my
actions; and even as I had achieved release in that classroom, I knew that I
was making a mistake.� Cultural taboos
generally existed for a reason, and I kept telling myself that breaking this
one didn�t bother me too much.�
Intellectually, I knew that the guilt that I did feel was the result of
nothing but the middle-class morals with which I�d been raised, but that didn�t
matter---we�re all victims of our parent�s beliefs in one way or another---and
no matter what I told myself, the guilt still felt just as real to me.� So, I�d just have to work my way through
it.� 

&nbsp;

And the boy hadn�t been
harmed.� My God!� He was considered a hero by the students that
knew.� And that was the thing that I
hated the most---the knowing eyes of some of the students.� I could lie to myself all day long making
what I had done insignificant, but it wouldn�t change a thing; I knew that what I had done was wrong
and that was all the mattered.� I didn�t
want to go to jail.� And while I didn�t
necessarily believe in God�s vengeance anymore, in a very real way I believed
that went around came around; that in the end I would someday, in some way have
to pay for what I had done.

&nbsp;

I had a younger brother and
sister.� Raised in a small rural town in
northern Georgia,
the three of us had had a good start.�
Even though we didn�t have as much as a lot of the other families, my
parents had raised us in a stable environment.�
Even so, I feel like I�ve been alone my whole life.� My father was always the one that I most
wanted to love me.� I thought of the only
photo of the two of us alone that I had kept.�
In it, I was twelve and trying to catch up to my father while I walked
in his footsteps in the mud.� I had felt
like he was all that I had, but he didn�t even know I existed.

&nbsp;

I guess it was at this time
that I developed the need to acquire things as a symbol of success.� Growing up, I was about as average physically
as a person can get---I didn�t become attractive to boys until I was about
sixteen and started to fill out a little.�
But I compensated by always being smart, very smart; but even there I
didn�t quite qualify as truly brilliant for I�ll never forget the guidance
counselor that had once described me as �marginally gifted�.� Not strongly religious, but as good rural
southerners, we�d still gone to church every Sunday nonetheless.� I guess that the religious training had taken
root more than I would ever have believed, because I was a mess.� 

&nbsp;

I�d been seeing a
psychiatrist for the last couple of months about depression and only with the
greatest difficulty had I finally been able to reveal to him the existence of
what he called my �longstanding, relatively profound,
sadomasochistic sexual fantasies�.�
I hated the word sadomasochistic; it was his word, not mine.� He was an ass!� I had never acted on any of my fantasies.� Even though I found the dreams very exciting
at the moment, I felt shamed by them afterwards.� What was quite remarkable to my therapist was
that, as opposed to other patients he had seen with sadomasochistic
relationships, my fantasies were to him �overtly,
extraordinarily fluid.��
What he meant was that it was often impossible for me to be sure if I
was the masochistic victim or the sadistic perpetrator in the fantasy.� And this was what HE piled on top of my
guilt.� God, I was a mess.

&nbsp;

I found it impossible to
talk honestly with him; even though I assume he did his best with me, I found
that I could only talk about my feelings of worthlessness without describing why
I felt this way.� I knew that I hid
things from him---it was almost impossible to give him the whole truth.� It wasn�t just that I was afraid of going to
jail; I had done some wild things when I was growing up so I wasn�t na�ve, but
I found to my surprise that I just really felt bad about what I had done.� It was a hopeless circle that I couldn�t
force myself break; I was afraid that if I told the doctor of what I had done,
he would feel nothing but contempt for me.�
But he couldn�t help me if he didn�t know the truth.� And if I talked about my feelings of guilt
after a total confession, I knew that his contempt would only intensify for
me.� I already felt more than enough
self-loathing; several months ago in desperation, I had even tried to talk to
my mother about these feelings.� But she
refused to understand my oblique references and so I had given up.� 

&nbsp;

Soon after my affair I
started having this recurring dream.� It
was dark and I was lying alone on a stone table that I think might have been in
a church; women hurried to strip, touching themselves in prelude.� Breasts were touched with consent by soft
hands.� Nipples were plucked, pubes were
stroked.� A ring of naked flesh glistened
starkly in the heat of the midnight
chapel.� Moans merged with a sacred
litany.� Before the great stone alter, an
orgy ensued---random sweating bodies joined to form an entity of its own.� Swollen, perfect breasts jutted, their
beautiful bodies glazed in sweat and moonlight.�
Legs were splayed and buttocks were parted.� Sweat-sheened abdomens sucked tensely in and
out as genitals were bared to descending mouths.� Arms were wrapped around backs; bare hips
fidgeted in a desperate plea for deeper penetration.� 

&nbsp;

The firelight raged as the
festival drew on; young boy�s bleak faces were sat upon as dominant women in
macabre glee��.� The flurry of hands
roved over sweating skin, stroking tight, heaving bellies.� Hot mouths licked off the rivulets of
perspiration; then voracious tongues trailed up my legs, up my thighs, to the
radiating, wet inlet to my womb.� My
orgasm jolted me, and it was followed by a string of smaller, yet longer
ones.� It felt as if every inch of
exposed flesh was either being caressed, licked, kneaded or sucked.� In the background, forms of other figures
seemed to squirm on the stone floor, coupling legs wrapped around backs, faces
buried between legs.� I arched again as
my own orgasms pulsed down and the contractions began to shrink.� 

&nbsp;

The images wrenched me;
they were obscene, revolting.� Wake
up!� Wake up!� I always commanded myself.� But I could not move, could not speak.� Worse, my orgasm was obvious, a wet, lewd and
clenching irony in time with the very chant of the non-existent group.� I would always awaken suddenly, out of
breath.� My nightgown stuck to me; I felt
doused in slime and the very coldness of my sweat had shriveled my
nipples.� I had cum in my sleep.� The wetness, the acute vaginal sensitivity
upon waking left no doubt.� Worse, these
dream orgasms had proved to be my only orgasmic release for some time.� Even though we continued to have sex, I
hadn�t had an orgasm with my husband for over a year.� I had become very good at faking it for him,
and he never suspected.

&nbsp;

I remember my last meeting
with Dr. Mintner like it was yesterday.�
He said that the abstractions---the bizarre setting, the emblems, the
firelight, etc---were what he called �subconscious detritus.� �Dreams,� he said, �are the outwardly symbolic
subjectivities that surround a concrete point.�
These are coded encryptions and you are here to find a way to expose and
identify them, after which we can determine how they relate to the central
notion of the dream.�

&nbsp;

But giving him too much
information allowed him too close to my hidden shame and so he went blindly
on.� �There�s a lot of guilt in you, Rebecca.� You feel guilty that you�ve put your job
before your husband, because if you did the opposite you would satisfy your
parent�s convictions of occupational failure.�

&nbsp;

I was pretty sure that I
didn�t buy that.� Nevertheless, it was
possible and I was smart enough to feel stupid for not thinking about it.� 

&nbsp;

�Since the day you left home, you�ve been torn between
opposites.� You want to be right in the
traditional sense, and you want to be right for yourself.� You want both ends of the spectrum.�

&nbsp;

No, I wanted absolution for
what I had done.� 

&nbsp;

�You�re very unhappy,� Dr
Mintner said.

&nbsp;

I know, I
thought to myself.� Pretty obvious call
there, Doc.� �I need a solution; the
nightmare is ruining me.� I�m not getting
enough sleep, my work at school is slipping and I�m always in a bad mood when I
get home.� Don�t you have some wonder
drug I could take?�

&nbsp;

�Yes,� Dr. Mintner said.� �But that wouldn�t solve any of your
problems; it would only cover them up.�
You�re having the nightmares for a reason.� We must identify that reason.�

&nbsp;

Dr. Mintner was right,
there was no quick fix.� Especially when
I wasn�t about to give him all of the facts; the truth about what I had
done.� �What am I going to do?�

&nbsp;

�The first thing you must do is be patient.� You are a very complex person.� Understanding your problems will be a complex
affair.�

&nbsp;

Tell me something I didn�t
already know, Doc.

&nbsp;

�The images and ideas expressed in dreams function in two basic
modes,� Dr Mintner went on.� �One, the evident mode, relates to the
content as it occurs to the dreamer.� And
two, the concealed mode, which is the dream�s hidden or symbolic
qualities.� Clearly, the dream is about
you at an orgy.� There are dark, hooded
figures and cryptic words.� The dream
sounds almost satanic.� Dreams of devils
often signify a rebellion to Christianity.�
Are you a Christian?�

&nbsp;

�I�m not sure.� I�ve started attending services again, but
I�m not anything really.�

&nbsp;

Then he asked a bit too
abruptly, �Have you ever
had a lesbian experience?�

&nbsp;

�Of course not.�

&nbsp;

�Have you ever wanted to?�

&nbsp;

�No.�� I was starting to get pissed.� Really pissed, Doc.

&nbsp;

�You�re sure?�

&nbsp;

I could feel myself
blush.� �Yes, I�m sure.�� I knew that I had snapped at him then.

&nbsp;

�Your dream is rife with overt sexual overtones; that�s the only
reason that I ask such questions.�

&nbsp;

�Yeah, and what might it,
or any of the dream, have to do with lesbianism?�� Now the teacher in me was giving him a
question that I knew he couldn�t answer.

&nbsp;

But he did answer it, by
making me answer it.� �The voices you heard, were they male or
female?�

&nbsp;

�Female.� I already told you.�

&nbsp;

�And the figures touching you, caressing you, were---�

&nbsp;

�All right, yes, they were
female.�� That�s
what I get for trying to play games with a shrink.

&nbsp;

His next observation
disturbed me the most.� �It�s interesting that you take such
aversion to questions pertaining to lesbianism, or potential lesbianism.� It�s interesting too, that you are now
exhibiting a guilt complex about that.�

&nbsp;

�I�m not a lesbian,� I
said.

&nbsp;

�I�m quite sure that you�re not, but you�re so strong, you�re
afraid that I might think you are.�

&nbsp;

�How do you know?�

&nbsp;

�I know a lot of things, Rebecca.�
I know a lot of things just by looking at you, by assessing the way you
structure your replies, by your facial inflections and tics, your body
language, and so forth.�

&nbsp;

�I think you grabbing for
shit, Doc.�

&nbsp;

�Perhaps.� And it certainly
wouldn�t be the first time a psychiatrist had been accused of such.� What I mean is that no mode of rapport
between a doctor and a patient is more important than openness and honesty.�

&nbsp;

�You think I�m not being
completely honest with you?�

&nbsp;

�No, Rebecca, I don�t think you have been.� You�re outwardly rebellious and defensive,
which is a sure sign of a deep sensitivity.�
You haven�t been fully open to me about the dream, have you?�

&nbsp;

Of course I hadn�t---there
was a lot I hadn�t told him.� But what
was I supposed to say now?

&nbsp;

�Are there any men in the dream, Rebecca?�

&nbsp;

�I think so.� Only a few.�
But they�re all in the background, chopping things, chopping wood.� Most are younger.� Boys, really.�

&nbsp;

�Wood.� On a fire.� But you say that the males are in the
background?�

&nbsp;

�Yes.�

&nbsp;

�And the figures in the foreground are women?�

&nbsp;

�Yes.�

&nbsp;

�And who is the center of attention to these women?�

&nbsp;

�Me.�

&nbsp;

�You.� Naked.� On a table inside a chapel.�

&nbsp;

�Yes.�

&nbsp;

�Don�t you find it interesting that the active participants of the
dream are women, while the men remain
in the background, clearly symbolizing a subordinate role?�

&nbsp;

�I plead the fifth,� I
replied.

&nbsp;

�My conclusions will make you mad.�

&nbsp;

�Doc, I�m already mad.� You�ve accused me of withholding
information.� What conclusion?�

&nbsp;

�You already know.�

&nbsp;

I felt my eyes boring into
him.� But, he was right.� I already did know.� �Tell me,� I said.

&nbsp;

�What you haven�t admitted to me is that the dream aroused
you.� Outwardly, you were repelled, but
inwardly, you were stimulated sexually.�
Am I right or wrong?�

&nbsp;

I somehow answered him,
�You�re right.�

&nbsp;

�You were aroused and you had an orgasm.� Right or wrong?�

&nbsp;

My throat felt dry.� �Right.�

&nbsp;

I hadn�t told him this,
among many other things I�d left out.

&nbsp;

�Are you experiencing an orgasmic dysfunction at home, with your
husband?�

&nbsp;

I laughed bitterly.� What difference would it make?� �Yeah,� I said.� �Sex has never been a problem for me.� I�ve always been�.orgasmic.� Until now.�
Since I�ve been having this nightmare, I haven�t had good sex with my
husband.�

&nbsp;

�But you do have an orgasm in the dream?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, every time.�

&nbsp;

�You�re afraid that an aspect of your past will ruin your future.�

&nbsp;

The words seemed to echo in
my ears, hovering around my head.� 

&nbsp;

Dr. Mintner went on, �Do you---�

&nbsp;

�I don�t want to talk about
it anymore,� I told him.� �I really
don�t.�

&nbsp;

�Why?�

&nbsp;

�I don�t feel very good
right now.�

&nbsp;

�You have a lot of fixations, the most paramount of which is fear
of seeming weak to others.� You associate
being upset with being weak.� It�s not
though.��
He was silent for a minute.� �I
think it�s important that you keep coming here.�

&nbsp;

I nodded.� And then I left, never to go back.� And so I struggled on alone, never
confronting my shame and guilt, and never feeling any relief from it.

&nbsp;

I�ve spent a lot of time
thinking about my feelings and have discovered two things.� The first is that there is a hidden nature to
shame.� I am speaking of genuine shame,
not some false modesty.� I hadn�t lived
up to the expectations of my family; and even though I knew they looked upon me
as promiscuous, grasping, materialistic and far too willing to cut corners to
get what I wanted, they would still never have expected this from me.� But this is who I am; I am this way without
thought and without effort.� Worse, I too
have recently come to resent these �qualities� in me; I am humiliated that I am
this way, and even more horrifying, I seem to have no choice in the
matter.� But I can�t help myself.� And my worst fear is that this humiliation is
or will soon be seen by everyone.� 

&nbsp;

Second, I have found that
shame is the most intolerable of feelings because it is about the self.� And since it�s an all or nothing experience,
I knew that I didn�t deserve to be happy in any way.� I was a failure as a woman, as a wife and as
a teacher.� There was no help for me, I
was totally worthless from head to foot and even though no one else knows
what I have done, I fully recognize how
much of a failure and how unalterably bad I have become---and I fear, I know
that they will soon understand it too.� I
often feel like my recognition of how repellent I am will give me a smell or
look that somehow alerts others---look
closely, here goes a bad person, here strides wickedness.� But people see with quick, careless eyes
and even then only notice the most superficial qualities.� And so they miss the real me; not only ugly
on the inside, but also the fact that I am beyond the possibility of
redemption.

&nbsp;

I wish that I could somehow
rescue myself; that I could make everything go back to the way it was.� But nothing about me will ever change and so
that can never be.� I have had these
veiled needs for as long as I can remember.�
First a young teenager�s deepest hidden desires and then those forbidden
ones of a married woman.� I fought them
as best I could, but in the end when my marriage failed I succumbed.� Ironically, the more modern and successful I
thought myself; it turned out the further I was distanced from the very beliefs
that might have saved me.� Worse, the
more I drifted the less means I had with which to secure the forgiveness that I
needed.

&nbsp;

I have made mistakes in my
life, but I have always in the past had the strength to recover.� I had been a strong woman, always the one in
charge.� But now my confidence in myself
was gone.� Even though I still acted capable
and in control, inside I felt weak and helpless---and this was so unlike
me.� A painful hidden embarrassment that
was almost a sickness of the soul festered inside me.� At the same time, I felt anger towards the
boys with whom I�d had sex.� Why hadn�t THEY
stopped it?� Why had they ALLOWED it to
happen?� I�d asked myself this a thousand
times and in the end I knew that I was only attempting to transfer my guilt to
them---they weren�t at fault.

&nbsp;

This was the final thing to
break my marriage.� I felt torn,
ambivalent.� My marriage was a failure
and my husband was weak, but he didn�t deserve this.� I knew these deeds had made me unsuitable for
a decent person to love.� And while I
could kid myself that I was likable and could even perhaps convince myself too
that I was even lovable, deep inside I knew that this was not true.� I knew inside that no matter how much good I
might do from this point on, at the same time I was also still capable of
causing great harm.� Given my flawed
genetic character, in the end this was the reason that I decided to not have
children.

&nbsp;

I knew that good people
sometimes get seduced into doing wrong things by situational forces, but that
was no excuse for what I had done.� And I
knew that given half a chance, I could be a good person again.� In some way, I�d let my personal beliefs and
values get suspended in some kind of moral disengagement, and then because of
these failures it seemed that I was lost, forever.

&nbsp;

Sometimes I thought that
justice would be better served if I just died.�
I wasn�t the type that would ever consider suicide, but it was one way
that my problems would be gone, forever.�
I snorted to myself; more objective over-analysis on my part.� I couldn�t seem to stop.� My stomach churned with acid just as it had
for over half a year.� I hadn�t had a
full night�s sleep in months.� Every time
the phone rang or someone knocked at the door I jumped, expecting to be led off
in handcuffs.� I faked it well, but I
couldn�t handle the stress anymore; I just wanted it over.� If this meant going to the police and
confessing, then so be it.� But the shame
of it all!� I honestly didn�t know if I
could handle the shame of being known as a sex criminal, a pedophile, a
pervert.� What would my family
think?� My God, what had I been doing?

&nbsp;

And then he�d called.� If this man had a way to help me, then I
would cling to him like a drowning woman to a life preserver.� I was so tired of trying to handle this all
by myself.

&nbsp;

I wished that I could be
like others I knew; the if you
didn�t speak of it, it didn�t exist and if you didn�t think of it, it went away school
of behavior.� Instead,
I looked like hell.� I had bags under my
eyes from lack of sleep and they were red from constantly crying.� I couldn�t eat; I�d lost weight and my
clothes didn�t fit anymore.� But the
worst part was my marriage; ours had been a loveless marriage from almost the
beginning, and it was entirely my fault---I�d been too needy, too grasping of
material things, too enamored of success, both his and mine, and of what it could
bring.� Finally, I knew that several
years ago we�d both crossed a line over which we could never go back; it was
only a matter of time from that point before we divorced.� I was terrible to him; back when we�d still
cared about each other, we�d fought all the time about money---vicious fights
during which I said awful, taunting things.�
And now it was my turn to pay; if he discovered this about me before we
divorced, he would ensure that he left me with nothing.� And perhaps that was only right?

&nbsp;

All this ran through my
mind in tenths of seconds as I stood there.�
I finally shifted my attention to the unfamiliar man in front of
me.� If this was to work, I would have to
be firm, right from the beginning.� I
knew that my rather clipped style of speaking was intimidating, making my words
sound even more severe to many men, but I did not have the time to play
nice.� I needed to get my point across
before the man in front of me had made any judgments of his own.

&nbsp;

After a couple of seconds,
my stomach had finally calmed enough that I was able to sit down.� I tried not to let him know how scared I was,
but for the first time in a long time even as I sat with this man, I felt a
little hope.� But first I needed to find
out what he knew.� �What,� I asked him,
�do you want to talk about?�

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I shook her hand.� She had a
strong grip and gave me a dignified look; I was pretty sure that the �stern schoolteacher� image worked well
in her job.� Finally, she moved into her
seat as smooth as melted butter.� This
woman, who had perhaps the best posture I had ever seen, turned her swanlike
neck towards me and gave me a small smile.�
�What,� she asked in a low, arrogant voice that was as slick as barbed
satin, �do you want to talk about?�� She
radiated a sense of clarity and self-assurance.�
Anyone meeting her would come away believing that she�d been born when
the world began, so impressive was her apparent confidence.� I didn�t underestimate this woman�.despite
the effort she put into making a striking female presentation with her hair and
eyes and flawless makeup, she could hold her own in any battle of wits.� She was letting me know that she didn�t need
me and that it was I that had asked for this meeting.

&nbsp;

It was interesting how she had made me seem to be the supplicant with
just one sentence.� The thought ran
across my mind; women somehow scare men
and then for some reason, but this one
was like Cleopatra and could easily rule a million men.� I have never ceased to be amazed at how most
women seem to be able to do this to us at will; to exude a crystalline-cold
front which confounds and immediately puts us on the defensive.� Irregardless of how they might actually feel,
it seems that almost any female has this ability from birth and when they use
tricks like hiding behind sunglasses, they present a front that is virtually
impenetrable to the male of the species.�
But this one was special; where most women burned with a thousands
watts, she blazed with a million.� That�s
what this woman tried to do to me, but I just cocked my head and looked at
her.� After we had stared silently at
each other for a minute, she finally took off her sunglasses.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I watched the back of the
man�s neck turn red.� In another
situation, I might have chosen to be gentler, smiling more and being less
firm.� But the current circumstances
called for a whip, and it was important that I set the tone of the
relationship.� The man�s initial
familiarity did not seem good for our beginning a relationship beneficial to
me.� I knew I had to be in total control.� In a situation like this, that was how I felt
most comfortable.

&nbsp;

I could tell that the man
didn�t like me, but I was used to that.�
That was okay, I hadn�t come here to be his friend.� When I was in high school, until the end it
had been my bearing and intelligence that had always drawn the stares and
speculative eyes.� In college, it was my
looks: the angles of my face, my hair, the way that the boys said my skin
seemed to glow.� Now at work, it was
the�.other things that I had done.� It
was always something, but never the real me.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I was right; her face was spectacular.� She had good teeth, a generous mouth and
while tired�looking, her large eyes were so light a blue that in any other type
they would have appeared almost colorless.�
She stared at me and I just let her beautiful eyes draw me in.� A man could drown in those cool, icy
pools.� Luckily, I knew how to swim.

&nbsp;

She wore little makeup but it was beautifully applied; her face
looked almost scrubbed clean.� I could
see that her complexion was flawless and her skin was the smooth, unblemished
fineness of youth and was literally vibrant in its pure, radiant, almost
porcelain whiteness of winter.� She had
high cheek bones and a finely chiseled aquiline nose; her eyebrows were just
enough darker than her hair that they could easily be seen.� As I looked at her, each feature seemed more
delicate than dramatic.� The way her
eyelashes brushed down when she lowered her gaze.� The healthy sheen of her hair, the single
silky curl that rested against her jaw.�
The blush of cold or perhaps weariness on her cheeks.� This woman was achingly beautiful.� 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Chapter 6: The most ingenious men continually pretend to condemn tricking�but this
is often done that they may use it more conveniently themselves, when some
great occasion or interest offers itself to them; Fran�ois Duc De La
Rochefoucauld.

&nbsp;

Suddenly, for some reason, this woman disturbed me more than any
other woman with whom I had ever been.�
She seemed to emit a vibration that I picked up almost like a psychic
harmonic, something that pulsed at me with each beat of her heart.� I felt a sudden shiver go down my spine, and
I cleared my throat to give me a second to think.

&nbsp;

My throat felt dry and I sipped my cold coffee before I
answered.� �You, Mrs. Denholm are
potentially in a lot of trouble.�� I�d
seen the ring she wore so I could now promote (demote?) her from Ms. to
Mrs.� �But I think that with the right
kind of legal help, you can fight this thing.�
It will entail a lot of work and your reputation might well be shredded
when we�re done, but I think that I can keep you out of jail.� Interested?�

&nbsp;

She gave a refined Katherine Hepburn-like sniff of doubt.� �Mr. Langhorn,� she replied after taking a
quick glance at my face, �I�m not sure what you�re talking about, and I
certainly have no need of legal help right now.�

&nbsp;

�Rebecca---may I call you Rebecca?�� I continued before she could answer and I
leaned towards her over the table in an attempt to establish a feeling of
earnest professional intimacy.� My earlier
feeling of union with her was gone
and I was on a roll again.� She was on my
ground here and I was in charge; it wouldn�t hurt to remind her of that.� �Here�s what I know.� You�ve had an illegal sexual relationship
with a minor.� Not only a minor, but a
minor that was in your charge at school.�
That is felony and if convicted of this charge in this state, it makes
you a sexual predator, a pedophile.� If
you cannot at least credit me with a modicum of intelligence, then this
conversation is over and you go to jail---straight to jail.� The inmates and guards would love to get a
woman like you behind those walls.�

&nbsp;

The beautiful woman sitting across from me was shaken.� It only showed in her eyes and it only lasted
for a second, but it told me what I needed to know.� She cleared her throat to answer and just
then our waiter showed up.� She ordered
green tea to drink and we both took menus.�
There was a long uncomfortable silence while we both pretended to read
what was printed there.� I watched her
menu and saw it shake slightly as she held it up.� Finally, our waiter came back with her drink
and we both ordered salads.� Me because I
like to keep my weight down and watch my cholesterol; she I think because
suddenly something had upset her stomach.

&nbsp;

With what appeared to be a nonchalant air, she began again.� �I�m not sure what you�re talking about, but
let�s say that I was interested.� Let�s
say that if this had happened, it happened because someone drugged me.� How would you help me?�

&nbsp;

This was a question that I�d thought about a lot.� �Well, first I would talk to you and get your
side of the story---try to figure out what really happened.� You would have to give me ALL of the details.� Then,� I continued, �we would investigate the
kid.� We�d dig up every piece of dirt on
him that was available.� Even though he�s
a minor, he�s not without responsibility---especially if he drugged you.� But if that was all we did, you�d still be in
jail for good one day after the trial started.�
We would also try to come up with reasons to justify your actions, or at
least excuse them.�

&nbsp;

�This means investigating your co-workers and friends, your work
environment and your home life; it will be tough on them and your husband.� You would also have to see a psychiatrist;
clearly your defense would both take time and cost money.� Finally, we�d show you as contrite and as
accepting responsibility for any errors you might have made.� In the end, if you�re lucky and we do our
job, you�d be found not guilty but your reputation would be gone; you would
have to offer to accept some kind of extended counseling and of course, you
would resign from the teaching profession.�
Hopefully, soon this would die down and you could begin to live your
life again.�

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

He said suddenly in a quiet
voice, �Do you know?� To conceal the past
is not such a hard� trick.�

&nbsp;

�What?�

&nbsp;

He regarded me
thoughtfully, as if he was thinking about a million different things.� I stared back at him, my face getting redder
and redder.� 

&nbsp;

�What did you say?�

&nbsp;

�It�s not such an unusual
thing.� It�s a trick that relies only on
silence.�

&nbsp;

�I don�t know what you�re
talking about.�� But he ignored me for
awhile now.

&nbsp;

�Fine,� I said.� He was an idiot and I wondered if I had been
wasting my time.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I was silent for a minute, �But if you lie to me or if we are even
just unlucky, it�s six or seven years in jail for you---maybe a little less
with good behavior.�� I felt kind of bad
putting it to her like this, but I needed to keep her anxious and under
pressure.� She was one of those women
that are always calculating the angles in things, and she was smart enough that
if I didn�t use maximum leverage to keep her mentally off-balance, she�d figure
out that my story had more holes in it than Swiss cheese.

&nbsp;

�Being incarcerated,� I continued, �is not like in the
movies.� Think about being in an eight by
twelve cell with one other person.�
Little fresh air or sunlight, and working at a job that a moron could
do.� The male and female guards, always
checking you out, just waiting to get you alone.� And the other inmates will be sure to take up
whatever time you have left over.� It�s
not a pretty picture.�

&nbsp;

Here pale blue eyes flashed for a second.� �Please don�t play your silly games with me,
Mr. Langhorn.�

&nbsp;

I looked this beautiful woman straight in the eyes and
snorted.� �I�m not,� I lied.� �Like I said, this is going to cost you a lot
of money and almost surely your reputation.�
But if we get started right away, without delay, I think we have an
excellent chance of keeping you out of prison.�

&nbsp;

�Mr. Langhorn,� she asked, �how do you know anything about
me?�� If it�d been me, my mind would have
been swirling with panicky thoughts and fears at this moment and I wouldn�t
have been able to think of a coherent question.�
I was right, this was one smart woman and she was stalling for time in
order to get her thoughts in order and her composure back.

&nbsp;

�Well, actually I heard about you from a friend in the DA�s
office.� She,� I didn�t want to get my
source in trouble should Denholm eventually tell the police about me, �felt
that you were getting a raw deal.� They
are about finished investigating you and will be indicting you in the next few
days.� You don�t have much time to make
up your mind.�� I didn�t actually know
this for a fact, but it never hurts to keep up the pressure on your mark.� �And the longer you take, the less time we
have to help you.�

&nbsp;

The waiter delivered our salads.�
I dug into mine while she just pushed her lettuce around.� Her voice seemed to crack and I fancied that
I heard a light tone of underlying desperation.�
But then again, I�ve always been bad at that sort of thing and for all I
knew she might just be feeling a little indigestion.� 

&nbsp;

�I�I don�t know what to say.��
She seemed to pull herself together now and continued with the cool
fa�ade that I had come to admire.� �This
is all so sudden�.without admitting anything, let�s say that I may need
someone�s help, that this is something that has been tearing me up for
months�..the problem is that I have no money at the moment.� I couldn�t afford to pay you anything.�

&nbsp;

I looked at her for a second.�
�What about your husband?� Doesn�t
he have money?�� I already knew that they
were both in debt up to their ears.�
Living beyond their means from paycheck to paycheck, five credit cards
maxed out between them and they had only a little more than a thousand dollars
in their joint checking account.� This
was going exactly according to plan.

&nbsp;

She looked at me for a second and then her eyes seemed to get even
colder.� With a vicious note in her voice,
she said, �That spineless bastard!�
There�s nothing he�d do to help me, he�s nothing to me but backwash
now.� We�re always fighting about money
as it is, and with something like this, he�d divorce me like that (she snapped
her fingers) and do his best to take everything that I have.�� I noticed that everything that they had
together was hers alone.

&nbsp;

Then she hesitated and her face changed, becoming softer as she
said, �God, how I hate reacting to things without thinking.� He�s not a bad man.� He doesn�t deserve to be described like
that.� He�s not what I thought he was
when I married him, but he�s not like I just described him either.� But that doesn�t matter, we don�t have the
money.�

&nbsp;

After several minutes of silence she continued, speaking to her
plate, never looking me in the face.�
�And how do you know,� she asked, �whether or not I even want to be
saved from whatever it is you think I�ve done?�

&nbsp;

�Well, Mrs. Denholm,� I said with a doubtful tone in my voice,
�without a retainer, I don�t think that there is much that we can do for
you.� And so we would never know, would
we?� A pity.� I�m pretty sure that we could have kept you
out of jail.�� She was tough, but the
quickly hidden look of desperation on her face told me what I needed to
know.� The confident, cool and contained
Rebecca Denholm had departed with the arrival of tea and by the time the main
course was delivered, and she had been replaced by a distracted, desperate
woman hiding behind a weak fa�ade held in place only by worry and doubt.� This was an anxious woman that saw a horrific
disaster looming in front of her; I�d offered her a lifeline and now I was
taking it away.� It would be interesting
to see how desperate she was and how far she would go to obtain my help.

&nbsp;

She leaned forward over the table towards me.� The front of her blouse opened more and I was
pretty sure that it wasn�t an accident.�
Her complexion was so light that I could see the delicate blue tracery
of veins just below the skin of her cleavage.�
As I raised my eyes, she looked directly into them as she said, �Let�s
say that I did need help�isn�t there any way that I could get you to defend
me?� I swear to God that I will repay
anything that I owe you, and I would sign anything you want me too. �Isn�t that good enough?�

&nbsp;

�I�m sorry,� I shook my head as I finished my salad.� �We don�t do charity work, and we certainly
wouldn�t take on your case pro bono---it�s,
shall we say, a little too high profile.�
We have clients that might walk if we took your case, and you want us to
defend you for nothing?� Sorry.� Can�t do it.�
Please finish up, Mrs. Denholm, the lunch is on me.�� My tone was brusque and made it clear that we
had nothing else about which to talk.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

His voice was light and
educated and easy, and did not belong to the face; it did not belong to the new
eyes.� During the last few years, when I
felt like every strength had been scraped out of me, I had learned a trick. �Around my hollowed interior, I shaped a fa�ade
of confidence, the mask of a woman unafraid, who could not be fooled or taken
advantage of.� A woman who had nothing to
lose.� I dropped this over me now, like a
shield.

&nbsp;

I had once been where he
was now---everything that he did, he did for money or power or just because he
could.� I wished that I could somehow
express what I felt to the man before me.�
The intensity of emotions and the frustration at my inability to make
him appreciate my need made me feel as if I were hopelessly lost, speaking a
different language from him as I asked him to help me save my soul.� I leaned forward in emphasis, as if my
physical nearness alone could make him feel my desperation and how much I
needed his help.� But when he told me
that our lunch was over, I felt as if someone had just shot me through the
heart.� His eyes had changed; the once
eager look altered, becoming harder, more cynical and cold-blooded.� I couldn�t help myself and I started crying
again.� Even then, I knew that I couldn�t
tell him the truth.� God, how I hated
being so weak in front of a man like this!

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I looked across the table at my beautiful dining companion.� From across the dining area she would still
appear composed, even regal; but from across the table her eyes were
tearing.� And although facing me, she
wasn�t seeing me.� It was the only real
moment of weakness that I saw at lunch.�
�My God,� she said in a soft toneless voice directed at no one, �one
time.� It only happened one time---during
a special after-school study session that I had with him---it was math.� And I think that he gave me some drugs in a
coke.� I was so embarrassed; I thought if
I just ignored it, it would go away.� I
can�t believe that this is happening to me.�

&nbsp;

I was pretty sure that I had most of the facts---and I knew that
she was lying through her teeth.� I
looked at her and decided to offer the bait.�
�If what you say is true, it offers mitigating circumstances.�� Now we would see just how desperate a woman
she really was.� �Rebecca, you say that
you have no way to pay for our services.�
This is, how do I say it, highly irregular.� But there may be one way that you could
retain my firm and me.�� 

&nbsp;

She looked at me quickly like I was already her savior.� I hesitated for a second, �There is one way
that we can perhaps make this work, one way that you can retain me.� It�s highly unusual, but I�m willing to try
it if you are.� There is a weekend coming
up.� And�I�m embarrassed to even say
this,� I tried to play the bumbling fool that was now too shy to even continue
with his indecent proposal.� �But if you
should choose to go away for the weekend and if by coincidence, I should happen
to be at the same place, why I am sure that something could be arranged.�

&nbsp;

Rebecca Denholm: wife, teacher, cold-hearted woman and likely
felon-to-be; she looked at me for a second as if she had just lifted a rock and
found something disgusting beneath it.�
Then a small smile quirked across her face.� It seemed obvious that she felt that we had
moved from dangerous legal territory and on to ground in which she felt much
more comfortable.� Her posture now became
more relaxed and she leaned back in her chair; at the same time, her face again
resumed its initial look of cold, rock-hard assurance and poise.� But this time, there was an added patina of
calculation.� This alone told me that the
woman was a man-eater and was very experienced in getting her way with
men.� With my last comment, she was
definitely back on familiar ground.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

My
looks meant nothing to me.� But all he
saw was the superficial and he was willing to trade his time for this?� I couldn�t believe it; would I be able to get
out of this terrible mess as easily as this?�
All he wanted was to take me to bed; to fuck me a couple of times and
then he�d help me?� It seemed too good to
be true; I was afraid of some kind of a trick.�
Nothing in my life as important as this could ever be that easy to make
go away.

&nbsp;

What
would I have to do?� Probably whatever he
wanted.� This man, I sensed, was the sort
of man who felt that staking a claim in a woman�s vagina also locked up the
rest of her as well.� A risky assumption,
but fortunately for me, not a rare one.�
If necessary, I�d work this to its limits with this predator.� This whole scenario seemed so typical of men
like him.� A weak man that wasn�t capable
of finding a woman on his own, but instead waited until a potential victim was
at the lowest point in her life in order to take advantage---how low could a
person get?� 

&nbsp;

A
man like this was despicable and couldn�t be trusted; he deserved nothing of
me, or of any real woman for that matter.�
But we both knew that I was desperate.�
I felt nauseous as I picked up his card and looked at it again---a chill
went down my spine for I knew that I was considering his offer even as part of
me said, don�t do it.�
My head felt like it was spinning and I couldn�t think.� I would do almost anything to get out from
under my past.� And if this was what it
took, then I could do it.� But I hated
the thought of it.

&nbsp;

Men have always considered
me attractive.� I�ve known this since I
was sixteen; so many men have propositioned me in so many ways that I�ve lost
track of the number years ago.� But this
was different.� He wanted money from me
and I desperately needed what this man offered, but since I couldn�t pay him
money, he would take his pay in flesh.�
Even as he manipulated others, this kind of man begged to be manipulated
in turn.� I knew immediately that if he
could defend me from my past, it would cost me little of myself to give him
what he seemed to want---and I also knew that deep inside I had already decided
to cooperate with him, once.� But first I
needed to make sure that I knew exactly what he wanted and what he offered in
exchange.� And that if we were successful,
I would finally be free of the worry that so hounded me now.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

Her voice was cold now, cold as ice.� �Why Mr. Langhorn, I do believe that you have
just propositioned me.�

&nbsp;

I shook my head, �No, Rebecca.�
All I did was mention that there was a way to pay your legal fees.� One that you could afford, and having met you
now, one with which you might not be entirely unfamiliar.�� This last was perhaps pushing the envelope a
little far, but I wanted her to see that even I, the bumbling idiot, could
understand a woman like her.

&nbsp;

Rebecca flushed at my last comment and her eyes flashed her
displeasure at my impertinence, but I was impervious.� Yes, I was the buffoon that was out of my
depth; the loser that was making one last attempt at grabbing the winning lotto
ticket.

&nbsp;

�Let�s say that I did need to be defended.� There is no way on earth that your firm would
handle me with that kind of down payment.��
She looked at me in the eyes as she said, �I may not be familiar with
legal firms, but I am not that gullible either.�

&nbsp;

�Rebecca,� I began, �our lawyer/client relationship would necessitate
a close, even intimate affiliation between us.�
While I am the one that would bill the firm and can therefore control
most of the legal costs, you are correct in that there would be other times at
which significant amounts of money would be required from you.� Should you decide that you liked the
arrangement that I think we might have just reached, then I would in turn be
more than willing to �lend� you the money you will need.� Of course, that means that other �payments� will be required of you at
later dates.�

&nbsp;

She looked at me for a minute without saying a word.� Then in an icy tone, she said, �Fine.� Let us be blunt about this offer of
yours.� I let you fuck me and when I�m
your whore, you and your firm will act on my behalf if I need to be defended in
a court of law?�� 

&nbsp;

Okay, I�d struck out on this one.�
So much for the time I�d wasted on this bimbo; the way she put it let me
know just exactly what she thought of me and my scam.� I was ready for her to get up and slap my
face as she departed the table when she suddenly said, �Yes, I�ll do it.� I hate to owe anything to anybody.� And since I can�t pay you the money you want,
but I will pay my own way, like I always do.��
Rebecca just stared into my eyes for a second, �In my own currency.�

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I dropped my head then
because a smile was spreading across my face and I didn�t want him to see
it.� My shoulders were quivering and I
had to put my thumb and forefinger on either side of my nose and shake my head,
relief popping like laughter bubbles in my ears.� At last, when I had stopped smiling, I
dropped my hand and looked at him.� What
an amazing thing.� To enter into a deal
with a man like this.� Isn�t it a
constant surprise the things that people will do for peace of mind?� 

&nbsp;

We sat for what seemed ages
looking at each other.� And then I
answered.� �Yes,� I said quietly.� �Yes.�
I�ll do it.�

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

In a matter of fact voice, she continued.� �I think that perhaps I can get away from my
husband for perhaps one night next week.��
Now the bitch was negotiating!�
She felt comfortable enough to try to take control of the situation.

&nbsp;

I couldn�t believe the audacity of this woman as I shook my head
slowly.� �Not good enough.� This would be far more dangerous for me than
it would ever be to you.� You are on the
verge of losing everything, but I�m not.�
If you want my help staying out of jail, I want it to be worth my while,
I want the whole weekend, Friday evening to Sunday evening.�� I hesitated, then plunged in completely.� �We�ll spend the weekend at a place of my
choosing, and you�ll do everything that I say and give me everything I want,
willingly.� No negotiations with
this---take it or leave it.�� 

&nbsp;

Here was the crux of the matter.�
Either she bought into my line or she shied away.� While I waited for her to make up her mind, I
guess that it�s about time that I shared a little secret that only a few others
knew; I wasn�t married, but I liked married women---I liked them a lot,
especially the beautiful ones.� I�d invested
a lot of time in Rebecca Denholm. �Hell,
I could have purchased a prostitute for the whole weekend for a lot less than
just the time that I indulged on this woman.�


&nbsp;

But for some reason, taking a woman like this and putting her in a
position where I controlled everything; a position in which she was forced to
willingly give herself to me for the weekend---it all felt incredibly
empowering.� Every one of the women that
I had used like this before had something to lose, and that�s how they had all
behaved.� Some cried a little and then
performed like a trained seal.� Still
others fought me before I broke them and a few were like a tame doe, eerily
resigned to their fate from the beginning.�
But one thing was for sure; if you found the right lever, they all caved
in the end.� 

&nbsp;

I knew that I was a manipulative bastard, but even so, I reflected
back upon the last year with pleasure.�
Knowing that they belonged to another man when they delivered themselves
to me under these conditions; that there were no limits---that I could do
anything that I wanted to them---it was all very heady stuff.� But the best part was that at the end of the
weekend, I could kick them out of the motel room or deliver them back to their
car or their home or their apartment and then just disappear; but they were
left to lick their wounds and bruises, repair their shattered egos and dignity,
and then face hubby.� What did they
say?� How did they explain the
discolorations, the marks, the sore areas on their body and the changed
personalities that magically appeared after a supposedly innocent weekend?� 

&nbsp;

I know that this was sick, but I couldn�t help myself.� I could always use whores, but somehow that
didn�t seem to satisfy me nearly as much.�
I had often talked to my secretary about finding a wife and even dreamed
about it sometimes, but the reality was that I needed to manipulate a woman, a
new someone that each time would bring fresh emotions, unscarred needs and
untouched weaknesses to the liaison.� It
was these things that I needed, not the companionship a wife might provide.

&nbsp;

Suddenly Rebecca intruded into my reflections; she closed her eyes
for a second and when she opened them, a smile lit her face.� Only it was the smile of a tiger looking at
its next meal.� Who was manipulating whom
here, I wondered.� �One weekend.� One weekend only.� That,� and now the smile on her face
broadened even more, �is our deal?� And
with this, you will defend me from the charges from the school?� All charges, no matter how long it takes?�

&nbsp;

�Yes,� I assured her.� �The
charges will be handled after we have finished.�

&nbsp;

She didn�t seem to pick up on my carefully parsed sentence.� �I�m sure that I can convince my husband that
my school has a weekend seminar for teachers.�
Perhaps one of the scheduled attendees is ill and I�m an emergency
replacement---yes, I think that would work.��
She was speaking aloud softly as she thought it through.� 

&nbsp;

�Where do we meet?�� She
didn�t seem at all upset by my offer and obviously seemed a lot more familiar
with doing this kind of thing than most wives I had met.� Interestingly, she now appeared ready to
depart.� Her tone at the last had been
impatient, as if the serious negotiations were done and I was a slow-witted
employee that was wasting her valuable time.

&nbsp;

I had given her question a lot of thought.� I wasn�t sure how far the DA and the police
had gotten with building their case against Rebecca, and I certainly didn�t
want to be seen with her at this point should they be tailing her.� I told her that I wanted her to meet me
directly after school on Friday.� She was
to keep her cell phone with her as she drove though the parking garage of a
large shopping mall with which she was familiar.� She was to enter from the Market Street side and then depart directly using the 15th street exit.�
I didn�t tell her that I�d be there watching to see if anyone followed
her through.� If she was followed, I
would just cancel everything---at that point she�d be on her own.� 

&nbsp;

Next, I gave her the location of a run-down strip mall that was
about a block from the bus station.� I told
her to park in front of the strip mall and take her luggage with her as she
walked to the corner.� There she was to
turn south down Connecticut Avenue and I would meet her before she had gone
a hundred yards.� 

&nbsp;

She looked at me and raised an eyebrow, �Luggage?�

&nbsp;

I looked at her and smiled, �Well, you can�t just wear nothing the
whole weekend, can you?� Besides, I want
you to wear a dress.� Wear it when we
meet on Friday.� Bring a pair of jeans
and at least four dresses or skirt and blouse combinations, and heels to
match---if you have a nice cocktail dress, bring that too.� We might be going out to dine.�� She just shook her head as she looked at me,
but didn�t say anything.

&nbsp;

�Oh, and by the way,� I continued in an overly casual tone of
voice, �bring a thousand dollars in cash too.�
This will be the only time that you will actually need to pay for my
services.�� If I purchased anything for
her to wear, I was going to make sure that it was her money that paid for
it.� She didn�t like the part about bringing
several changes of clothes and really didn�t like the part about bringing
money, but she didn�t argue with me.� I
guess that I was a lot more persuasive than I�d originally thought I was?

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I was ready to leave the
smug bastard right where he was sitting.�
I thought back to my teenage years.�
Even while attending church as a teenager, I had been fascinated by that
dreaded evil thing, sex.� I�d been young
and vigorous and found that I liked sex, and that I liked being in control when
I was with a man.� To me, even though I�d
had a couple of bad experiences, sex was still a natural and wonderful
activity.� I valued it and I was careful;
and just because I had chosen to indulge as a teenager, even then I was not
stupidly promiscuous.

&nbsp;

But honestly, the thought
of having such a tawdry affair with this particular man made me sick to my
stomach.� But the worst part was that I
knew that I was more than willing to give him what he wanted if it gave me back
my freedom, my peace of mind. 

&nbsp;

I stood up and looked at
him for a minute.� I always loved having
sex with a strong man that I could control, but I had not had good sex with my
husband in the last nine months now; I really hadn�t had any kind of meaningful
sex at all in more than seven months.�
But even as I knew that I would go through with this, I also knew that I
was sick of men right now; the thought of being pressured into having sex with
this man horrified me.� 

&nbsp;

I just wanted it all to go
away.� But it was clear that he�d put all
sorts of thought into it and had all sorts of plans already made.� The exact route and the clothes and the
overnight suitcase; it all made me wonder if I knew what I was letting myself
in for.� But in my desperation, I knew
that I had no better chance at keeping my freedom.� Finally, I confirmed with him one more time
my understanding of our deal and then I could stand it no longer---my skin was
crawling and I had to get outside before I threw up.� I turned and left him without looking back.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

Rebecca was obviously ready to leave.� She stood up and after she had put her
sunglasses on, she looked down on me for a short period without speaking.� Either she was re-thinking her agreement with
me or perhaps I was supposed to feel like I was the stable help and a minor
royalty was dismissing me.� For some
reason, I felt like it was the latter and that this tableau was rather symbolic
to her; I mean the whole �her-looking-down-on-me�
thing.� Then she confirmed the deal one
more time, �I pack enough clothes for the weekend, bring the money and meet
you.� Then you will handle my legal
issues?� That�s all I have to do, right?�

&nbsp;

I nodded, �Correct.�� She
had no idea what I had planned for her.�
This weekend had been about a month in the making and Rebecca might be a
little busier than I had described, but she didn�t need to know this right
away.� She turned on her heel and picked
up her coat as she left, and I have to admit that I enjoyed every minute of the
view.� It was then that I noticed that
her departure was also being watched by every other heterosexual man in the
caf�; that was the problem with meeting a woman that looked and walked the way
she did---no privacy!

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Chapter 8: Sensuality takes planning and work; Mason Cooley.

&nbsp;

I left using the rear entrance and walked the block back to where
I had parked my car.� The wind from my
open window blew my hair as I drove to my office.� There, I told Freddy and Nan that I would be taking an unplanned
vacation next week.� They didn�t blink an
eye because they were used to this happening at least four or five times a
year, regular as clockwork---I really did like married women.� Next I drove home and did a quick walk
through.� I looked at the living room and
the cherry book cases, the solid wood furniture and the few Persian rugs that I
could afford.� I looked out at the
combination balcony/deck that ran the full length of the back of the
house.� I went into my computer room and
checked out all of the recording equipment.�
I toured the small but functional kitchen and then I walked into the
room where I would be entertaining my guest for the weekend.� 

&nbsp;

My bedroom was large and open.�
One door led to the deck in back.�
Next to it was a closed door hidden behind a large Persian rug that I
had hung on the wall like a tapestry.� A
third door led to a large walk-in closet.�
I had a king sized bed; across from the bed was a large television in an
antique armoire.� In the corner,
separated from the master bedroom by a four foot high stone wall there were two
sinks, a toilet, a two-person whirlpool tub and a large shower.� Laid out on a chair near the bed were a few
items that I thought might come in handy.�
Some soft ropes and neckties, a set of handcuffs and a silk scarf that could
double as either a makeshift gag or a blindfold.� It was always best to start out slow.

&nbsp;

I looked and assured myself for the hundredth time that the three
camera lenses could not be seen.� One
looked down from the ceiling directly over the bed, a second had a great view
looking down at the bed from directly over the television set and the third was
located on the stone dividing wall at a height of about four feet on the right
side of the bed.� All in all, I figured
that I had pretty good video coverage of anything that we might do together.� 

&nbsp;

I then walked through the hidden closed door into the new room
that I�d just added.� This was a serious
play room and I had no plans to bring Rebecca here---at least not yet.� She and I would have a nice light, �consensual� weekend together---heavy
bruising was optional---and then she�d be out of my hair.� I entertained a whore every now and then in
this room, but it was definitely off-bounds for my weekend dates.� The Denholm woman wasn�t exactly what I would
call inexperienced, but if I tried to use some of the toys that I kept in here
on every housewife that I had to pressure to get a weekend with�well, I just
wasn�t willing to risk it.

&nbsp;

My playroom was attached to the master bedroom, but you had to go
through a small, closet-like room to enter it---I called it my �airlock�.� Two metal doors with electric security locks
allowed access to this room; one was concealed behind the tapestry and led into
this small cubicle, while the other locked door allowed entrance into my new
addition.� 

&nbsp;

The interior of the 25� by 25� add-on was spare and Spartan,
looking like the room of a crazed priest.�
An austere white on the walls and ceiling, the paint was the rubberized
type.� The floor consisted of concrete
upon which heavily glued pergo laminate had been laid---there were four easily
cleaned drains in the floor and everything in the room was easily washed.� There was one additional door in this room
that led out to the deck in back.� It too
had an electric lock that could only be opened by its own unique code.� The keys for all three doors were different
combinations of five numbers and letters and it would be impossible to open any
of them without knowing the codes ahead of time.� 

&nbsp;

The few windows in the �White
Room� were narrow and wide, and located high in the wall.� Each window consisted of rows of four-inch
thick glass bricks.� The walls were
filled with material that completely baffled and soaked up sound.� I�d told the builder that I wanted a room in
which I could practice my music without bothering anyone and the whole design
had made perfect sense to him.� 

&nbsp;

The room had its own air-conditioning unit with enough capacity to
chill a side of beef in two hours if you so desired.� There was a double bed up against a wall with
a tight wooden box that fit beneath it.�
A toilet and enclosed shower took up one corner, while the rest of the
room was filled with my playthings.� One
corner contained a stationary bicycle and a treadmill; both pieces of equipment
had been purchased second hand with cash and for some reason I�d taken the time
to remove the serial numbers.� I can
honestly say that I am not sure why I did that. 

&nbsp;

There were four pulleys set in the ceiling and numerous rings
anchored in the walls and floors at various places.� There was also a T-shaped metal track that I
myself had recessed into the ceiling after the builder had finished.� The top of the T ran along the far wall and
this in turn was bisected in the middle by the body of the T.� One arm of the T ran over the bed and the
other arm led over to the toilet and shower.�
The body of the T went down the center of the room allowing access to
the exercise equipment and my other toys.�


&nbsp;

These included a large wooden X-frame anchored against one wall, a
nicely finished sawhorse and a wooden chair that I�d special ordered from a
local �artisan.�� The last item was firmly secured to the
floor.� 

&nbsp;

The sawhorse was my own design.�
The horizontal beam was four feet of polished oak that was about four
inches wide and slightly more than half an inch thick---all the edges on the
beam had been lightly sanded.� On the
wall, beginning two feet off of the floor there was a three foot high series of
strong metal clips screwed into a 2� x 4� wall stud, each one about six inches
apart.� One end of the horizontal beam
had a wide metal hook-like piece screwed into it which would fit into one of
the wall clips.� This supported one end
of the horizontal bar and took the place of one set of sawhorse legs.� There were also several different sets of
normal sawhorse legs of varying heights for the other end.� These legs were hinged so that the horizontal
beam could be dropped in from the top and two butterfly screws would then fix
the beam to the legs.

&nbsp;

Finally, there were racks against one wall that held various
leather, rubber and steel pieces to which my �date� would eventually be introduced.� Several prostitutes had already received a
taste and I had been informed by them that there would be no repeat business.

&nbsp;

As with my bedroom, there were camera lenses placed discretely
throughout the White Room.� I had an excellent overall view from two
angles, and a good aerial view of anyone using the toilet and the exercise
machines.� There were four camera lenses
covering the bed and nothing could happen there that wasn�t recorded in living
Technicolor.� 

&nbsp;

I went to sleep that night and dreamed of satyrs and succubae and
orgies.� I got up the next morning and
although I didn�t really feel rested, I kept busy all day.� I made calls and found more people from her
youth.� I contacted one man that had
known her in college.� After a few
minutes of conversation about Rebecca, I finally asked him, �Did you sleep with
her?�

&nbsp;

There was a hesitation for a moment, then he reluctantly admitted,
�Yes, I did, but I wouldn�t say that we were lovers.� I don�t think that she thought of me that
way.� She just wanted sex, but no
accountability.� No relationships.� I wasn�t about to turn down an opportunity.� She was beautiful.� She was fun.�
And she asked me for nothing.�� He
wouldn�t say much more about her after that.�


&nbsp;

I thought about Rebecca and what I had learned about her.� As a teenager, after she�d started to break
loose, she was always looking for the ultimate experience, the doorway to
something greater and she seemed to feel that one experience or another would
get her there.� That seemed to mean
drugs, sex with men that had serious character disorders, extreme fasting,
extreme exercise, meditation---anything and everything that kissed the
possibility, even if it were dangerous.�
Her brushes with various substances had gotten her into some trouble,
but nothing that she couldn�t handle by herself.� Then she changed, becoming even more serious
about what she wanted from the world.� 

&nbsp;

I now knew much of her history and knew that she hadn�t been
truthful with me at our lunch.� Some of
it was pretty obvious.� But it was as
much what she didn�t say as what she did.�
I don�t know how I knew that, but I was sure of it.� I thought that I�d left that analytical part
of me behind, but obviously not.� There
was a connection to her inside me at a level that I don�t think I�d ever
experienced before.� It would be
interesting to see how the weekend went and how much she would open up to me.

&nbsp;

I didn�t get a call from Rebecca on Thursday, but I didn�t sleep
very well that night either.� I was up
early Friday morning and ready to go.�
Somehow I felt energized by what I hoped would happen and the day passed
quickly.� 

&nbsp;

I was parked in the mall garage early that afternoon waiting for
Rebecca to pass by.� I hoped that
everything would work out, but as usual I was also prepared to abandon my
scheme at anytime.� Although she was a
little late, Becky finally drove by and as best I could tell she was without a
tail.� That didn�t mean anything since
the police could have put a GPS tracking device on her car if they had decided
to follow her discretely from a distance.�
But I had to assume that this meant that she was still surveillance-free
at this point.� 

&nbsp;

I had the feeling that I was really pushing the timing with the
police and DA a little too close, but at this point I just didn�t care.� Have you ever had that compulsion to do
something even though you knew continuing through could lead to total
disaster---but somehow the consequences didn�t matter, if you could just make
it payoff?� That�s how it was with this
woman; I really wanted her for the weekend.

&nbsp;

I waited a couple of more minutes.�
After no one else came by, I pulled out and took a shortcut that put me
ahead of her again.� I was waiting as she
drove by still following the route that I had laid out for her.� Things looked good.� I took another shortcut and waited where I
could see her park by the strip mall.�
Rebecca got out, opened the trunk of her car and took out a medium-sized
suitcase on wheels.� She locked her car,
looked around once and walked briskly to the corner and disappeared around
it.� 

&nbsp;

Where she had parked forced me to look directly into the setting
sun and I knew that this was one part of the plan that I had screwed up.� I watched as best I could for another couple
of minutes, but no one moved or looked suspicious, so I pulled out and within
two minutes Rebecca was throwing her suitcase into my back seat.� 

&nbsp;

As usual, the weather forecaster had gotten it wrong; the weather
was warmer than predicted, overcast and a little muggy; she�d left her coat
behind, or perhaps it was in her bag.� 

&nbsp;

As I had requested, she was wearing a dress today.� Rebecca now wore a black knit dress that
buttoned up the front, but which she had opened (for me?) to display an
eye-catching plunge at the neckline.� She
showed what might be considered an indiscrete amount of cleavage for a
teacher---apparently she wasn�t concerned about playing nice for the school
right now.� 

&nbsp;

Tight on top, it flared out at the waist
and accentuated an already slender torso and shapely hips before it dropped to
about two inches above her knees.� Her
legs were bare again and she had obviously changed shoes from work, because
Rebecca now wore a pair of black pumps with what looked like three and a half inch
stiletto heels.� They were sexy and she
looked good, but it still was not what I wanted to see.� 

&nbsp;

She looked over at me as I pulled away from the curb and I could
see the same superior look on her face that I had seen two days ago---God, how
I wanted to rip that look away from her.�
I drove around aimlessly for fifteen minutes looking into the rear-view
mirror before I headed over to a new outside mall that had just opened.� I parked in the lot away from any buildings
and turned to Rebecca.� I held out my
hand and said, �Give me the money.�

&nbsp;

She slowly opened her purse and pulled out a thin envelope.� She looked at me for a second, and then
grudgingly handed it to me.� I got out
without counting the money and motioned for her to follow me---this wasn�t a
date and I sure wasn�t opening the car door for her.� She exited her seat like poured syrup and
followed me.� We walked along the front
of the stores; I was about two or three feet in front of her and it didn�t look
like we were together.� I stopped at a
shoe store and pointed out in the window a pair of sexy black strappy sandals
with five inch heels and a pair of black sling-back sandals with four inch
heels, then walked on.� 

&nbsp;

Around the corner, I told her to go back in and buy herself several
pairs.� I pulled from my pocket the
envelope that she had given me and handed her enough money to buy the shoes
that I�d liked, and then I told her to be sure to leave a good tip for the
salesman.� Her lips were as thin as nails
as she jerked the money from my hand and flounced around the corner and into
the store.� Even though she knew exactly
what she was going to buy, it still took her over twenty minutes to make the
purchase.� Sometimes I think that women
are constitutionally incapable of buying anything quickly---either that or she
was trying to punish me in a passive/aggressive sort of way.� 

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I didn�t like the fact that
he made me an offer that I couldn�t refuse---or that I appeared so weak that I
leaped at the chance to prostitute myself to him if it would give me even part
of my life back.� The smug look on his
face told me that he felt that he�d thought of everything.� And I was angry that this man took the last
money that my husband and I had and made me use it to buy something that only
eighteen year old sluts and whores would wear.�
I hated everything about this whole affair and wondered if I would ever
learn to protect myself from predators like him.� How ironic was that---me calling him a
predator?� The worst part was that no
matter what I said to him, there were certain parents that could always make
these same charges against me.� I�.I just
wanted it over so that I could go someplace new and begin my life over.

&nbsp;

It was a high-end shoe
store that he chose for me.� I walked in
and saw with a sinking feeling that there were only two male clerks working
there.� One of them immediately came over
and offered to help; when I pointed out the shoes that I wanted and gave him my
size, he couldn�t move fast enough.� He
brought the shoes back along with others of the same style in two other colors.
�The clerk, who couldn�t have been two or
three years older than the boys I taught in school, insisted on taking off my
pumps and fitting the new shoes on my feet.�
He went way too far, not missing a chance to stroke my ankles, check out
my thighs or try to look up my dress, but I felt like I was at least a century
older than him and just wasn�t in the mood to play games with children
anymore.� What is it about me that
attracts children?

&nbsp;

I gritted my teeth as I
paid for the new heels with MY money that he�d given back to me and then wore
the strappy sandals for him when we met outside.� I had not walked with the sling backs yet,
but the expensive strappy sandals he chose for me were meant much more for
display than walking.� They were
difficult to get used to and it took me a few seconds to regain my balance as I
started to walk.� And within only a few
minutes of putting them on, my feet and the backs of my legs had already begun
to ache.� I hated these things.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Chapter 9: Women have a hard time of it in this world. They are oppressed by
man-made laws, man-made social customs, masculine egoism, the delusion of
masculine superiority.� Their one comfort
is the assurance that, even though it may be impossible to prevail against man,
it is always possible to enslave and torture a man; H. L. Mencken.

&nbsp;

Now I was ready, even if she wasn�t.� I had to admit, she looked great.� This wasn�t the kind of woman that you wanted
to spend the night with, this was the kind with which you wanted to spend a
leisurely week or a month.� We went back
to my car separately; I walked behind and enjoyed the view.� The new heels forced her to throw her pelvis
a little more forward than was normal for her and it looked erotic as
hell.� The always provocative hip
movement inside the tight knit dress and the sexy high heels all contributed to
my feeling of impending well being.� She
was a beautiful woman that knew exactly what I was doing and seemed to throw an
extra amount of hip action into her walk at the end.� 

&nbsp;

The windows in my car are heavily tinted and no one can see the
occupants inside.� I opened the door for
her and after she got in, I handed Rebecca a large, finely-made black cotton
sleeping mask and told her to put it on.�
She glared at me like I was an idiot and flatly refused to comply with
my request.� I looked at her for a second
and then told her to get out.� I was
immediately pissed at this point and wasn�t very gentlemanly as I grabbed her
bicep and began to drag her out of her seat.�
She quickly struggled with me for a second before she apparently changed
her mind.� After saying, �Fine.� Okay, OKAY!� she carefully slid the mask over
her eyes and then sat stiffly upright in her seat.� 

&nbsp;

I closed her door and then walked back around and got in on my
side.� �The mask,� I said, �stays on
until we get to where we�re going.� You
have no need to know where we�re going and if you try to figure it out by
peeking, the deal is off and you can defend yourself in court.� Clear?�

&nbsp;

�Whatever,� she said in a soft, silky tone.� It was clear that she was really saying, fuck
you.

&nbsp;

Have you ever noticed how once you commit to something that�s
important to you, you tend to stick with your decision even past that point
where things aren�t going like you had planned; how you�ll unthinkingly stay the
course as if you had a kind of tunnel vision, even if you know that it more
than likely will end in disaster?� I
think that it was like this for her.� I
mean, I wasn�t taking her to a hotel and she had to know this by now; worse,
she truly didn�t like the mask I made her wear.�
I think that she realized somewhere in her subconscious that this
probably was not appropriate behavior for a man with whom she was going to
spend a weekend, and for a moment she may have even toyed with the idea of
calling the whole thing off.� Perhaps if
she�d had time to think it through, she might even have bailed on me right
there.� But finally, I could see Rebecca
nod her head and lean back in the seat in an attempt to relax.� This was all part of the first time that I
actively challenged her Alpha status and she didn�t like it at all.

&nbsp;

I drove around for almost an hour before I entered into my
driveway and parked in my garage.� She
hadn�t said a word the whole time.� After
I closed the garage door with the remote, I got out, walked around and opened
her door.� I carefully removed the mask
without mussing Rebecca�s hair and offered my arm as support for her to get
out.� She ignored me and got out on her
own, showing me a sexy expanse of thigh in the process.� 

&nbsp;

When she finally stood next to me, I leaned down to kiss her and
she turned her face away sharply as she angrily asked, �What do you think
you�re doing?�

&nbsp;

I was totally surprised by her reaction.� �I was going to kiss you.�

&nbsp;

�I don�t kiss like that with men like you,� she said.� �That�s far too intimate for me.�� 

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I was so angry.� He�d made me wear a mask for over an
hour.� I had no idea what was going on,
but it certainly didn�t seem like something a lawyer would do. Even though I
was desperate for his help, I swore to myself that I would make him pay for
this.� When we finally got to our
destination, he parked inside a garage and when he got out, he tried to kiss
me.� I had no idea what he thought might
be going on, but this was purely a business arrangement with me.� I�d do what I had to do with him, but there
was no way that he could make me enjoy it.�
There was no way that he could force me into that place in my mind and I
think that he knew it because suddenly, he became much more of a gentleman.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I couldn�t help myself; I looked at her like she was crazy.� I was going to be fucking her in a little
while, but kissing was �too intimate?�� Okay, we�ll see about that, I thought to
myself.

&nbsp;

After I retrieved her suitcase from the backseat, I escorted
Rebecca from the garage through the kitchen and into the living room, where I
offered her a drink.� She looked bored as
she agreed to a scotch and water.� A
woman that drinks scotch can�t be all bad, and I made both a little heavy.� From the living room we walked out and sat down on the balcony-type patio that ran
most of the length of the back of my place.�
The nearby door to our left led into my bedroom and the one next to that
to my playroom.

&nbsp;

It had finally cooled off again, the
weather was nice and it was pleasant out back.�
The sun was setting by now; her hair was down and it looked like a soft
feather boa.� Her face looked unmarked by
any signs of age in the dwindling light and she looked younger than her
twenty-seven years.� It was at this point
that I think she felt the need to assert boundaries or some kind of control
over our �relationship�.

&nbsp;

�Since you�ve taken my case, there are
things you should know.�� She was a smart
woman, but obtuse in surprising ways.� I
am sure that there was much which would have given my plan away, but these
subtle clues passed her by and she actually still thought that she could pay
for a lawyer�s time with her body.� As I
looked at her, it was obvious that she enjoyed having my undivided attention.� It was like she was onstage and I was her
audience.� But this persona was different
from that of the troubled teacher.� Now
she acted like she was addressing a young man she had seduced and over whom she
felt some amount of control.

&nbsp;

She continued, �There are things that I
have not told anyone, not even my husband.�
ESPECIALLY my husband!�� I thought
to myself, keep talking my dear while I get it all on tape.� She turned in her chair and I noticed that at
this angle, even with a bra I could see much more cleavage.� It was interesting, I thought to myself.� The dress she was wearing really did seem to
be an anomaly.� From everything that I
had been able to discover about her, Rebecca was actually a woman that dressed
rather conservatively by nature.� Whether
because this was truly what she liked or it was some kind of camouflage to hide
her true nature, I had yet to determine.�


&nbsp;

She sipped her scotch and looked at me
over the rim of the glass.� I thought
that I detected a combination of both anticipation and confusion, only the last
of which made sense in this situation.�
Did I see a flicker of interest?�
Her pupils were dilated; could she be looking forward to this?� I wondered how much time I�d have with her
before she realized that she�d been had?

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I
wanted him to know exactly what I expected out of this.� I kept getting the feeling that he had
contests planned within games and it bothered me.� Finally, I couldn�t help myself.� I wanted to know what he expected out of this
weekend and I began to ask him simple questions.� He was a man and I wasn�t surprised at his
answers; not surprised at all.� A little
verbal foreplay, a little truth and a little flattery and he was like any other
man that I�d ever known.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

�Do you like lingerie?� she asked.� �I mean as opposed to just nudity.� Most men, of course, take pleasure in a nude
woman.�� 

&nbsp;

I think that this might have just
answered my last question.� �Sure I like
lingerie; I�m like most men I guess.� But
you�re toying with me right now,� I replied.

&nbsp;

�Of course I am.� That�s why you brought me here, isn�t
it?� Some men think I am very good at
it.� Would you like to choose some
lingerie for me, for tonight?� Perhaps a
long black silken robe or even a teddy?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, I think so.� I think I would like that---a lot.�� Even when I felt that I should be in control
of the situation, she had somehow surprised me and put me on the defensive
again.� The inexperienced school boys she
seduced stood no chance against her.

&nbsp;

�I�d like that too,� she continued.� �I like dressing up and being appreciated by
a man.�� Then she changed the subject on
me. �You are surprising.� You seem a
smart man and I�ll bet you are good with money.�

&nbsp;

Her flattery might have worked with
another man not attuned to her nature, but I was already on guard.� There was no doubt in my mind---this woman
could bewitch a man if he wasn�t careful.�
�Is this just your opinion or have you talked to someone that knows me?�
I asked.

&nbsp;

�This is my own observation.�

&nbsp;

I looked at her for a moment, �You truly
are a fascinating woman.�� This was an understatement
by at least half.

&nbsp;

�Men find that I am intriguing.� Many women find me�.unacceptable.� Those are usually the women whose husbands
want to sleep with me.�

&nbsp;

�And what do the husbands think?�

&nbsp;

�I think that they are attracted to any
beautiful stranger.� The more mysterious,
the better.� They can�t help it.� I guess it�s like a disease in a way.�

&nbsp;

�You are definitely more attractive than
you seem to think you are.�� I didn�t
know if she was looking for a compliment or just�deeper than I had expected.

&nbsp;

�For a man,� she replied, �you have good
judgment.� But there are things about me
that you don�t know.�� Now she
laughed.� �Intelligence doesn�t take the
edge off of what you crave right now��does it?�

&nbsp;

�No.�
Actually, it sort of gets in the way; it�s more like an annoyance where
sex is concerned.�

&nbsp;

�You put it well.� You can see it happening to you, even watch
it unfold, but still you feel the desire.�
We both get something that we want.�
You, sex, me�..help.� That�s why I
agreed to come with you.� And I think it
is not at all bad.� It�s just the way you
feel, and sometimes a person should live in the moment.�

&nbsp;

�My grandmother would have said that
this was Satan�s lie,� I allowed myself a smile.

&nbsp;

She was silent for a moment as she tried
to figure out what I meant.� She switched
subjects, �My feet are cold, and they ache from the heels you seem to like me
to wear.� Would you� rub them for me?�

&nbsp;

�Of course.�� I stood up and offered her my arm.� She took it and I led her from the patio
directly into my bedroom.� We went inside
and she took a quick look around and then turned to me with a smile.

&nbsp;

�Let me get ready.�� She quickly sat on the edge of the bed and
removed the new heels I�d made her purchase.�
She stood up as she pulled her dress up to take them off.� She had on the slimmest of underwear, a small
thong, and her butt was muscular and beautiful---even with just a quick
glimpse.� The thong was tiny in front;
she obviously trimmed her pubic hair.�
When she sat down again, she let her dress ride high, but I could no
longer see her upper thighs and it frustrated me.� Then I felt a sense of panic; I was losing
control.� Even as it happened, I knew
that it was happening to me, but the reality of it was like a drug rushing
through my body.� This woman was dangerous,
she was a criminal and she manipulated men like toys.� 

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I
was of two minds.� I was disgusted that I
had to play this kind of game.� I had
been forced into a similar situation once before when I had tried to retrieve
some photo negatives and didn�t ever want that again.� At the same time, I admit to feeling some
satisfaction in being able to get him to do what I wanted; he was single minded
in his pursuit and as long as he got what he thought he wanted, he didn�t seem
to care if anything was real here---but I knew that everything I �gave� him was false.�


&nbsp;

I
admit that I played it up and by the time I finished, he was wriggling like a
puppy.� He wasn�t bad looking and after
so long without a man, I have to admit that his attentiveness was flattering to
my ego.� He also seemed like he was a man
that might not have been with a woman in a long time----he couldn�t take his
eyes off of me---it almost felt like he was a voyeur or something.� It had been so long for me too.� I wasn�t sure what to think---if I had to
have sex with a man, I guess that it could have been a lot worse than with
him.� I think that if I could just close
my mind to it all, perhaps this wouldn�t be quite as bad as I had feared, and
besides, it did feel good to have someone rub my feet again.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

She looked at me as she said, �It is
most unattractive to stare at a woman like that.� I feel like you�re drooling over me.�

&nbsp;

I laughed as I replied, �If you didn�t
want me to watch, you�d have gone into the bathroom.�

&nbsp;

�Who said I didn�t want you to watch?�

&nbsp;

When she had herself situated on the
bed, I knelt and began to give her a foot rub.�
The irony of being on one knee in front of this woman did not escape me
nor did the physical discomfort.� Her
knees were spread a little as I rubbed her foot and the view of the insides of
her thighs was slightly better.

&nbsp;

�Have you told anyone else about what
happened?� What you�ve done?�

&nbsp;

�No.�
No one,� she replied.

&nbsp;

�Why not,� I asked, �at least tell your
husband?�

&nbsp;

Her voice took on the husky taint of
contempt that I had heard before.� �We
don�t get along now.� Besides, he doesn�t
have the imagination to put himself in my position in an attempt to understand
me.�

&nbsp;

�As your lawyer,� I began officiously,
�I have to know all of the facts.� Is
this boy the only one, or were there others?�
And did he really give you drugs?��
I knew that there was more than one boy and pretty sure that no drugs
had been involved.� But I wanted to see
what she had to say.

&nbsp;

She moved uncomfortably on the bed for a
second and then looked at me.� �Do we
have to talk about this right now?� she asked in a little girl voice.

&nbsp;

I hate it when grown women do that!� Why do they think that it is cute?� �I�m not trying to change the mood, but I
need to know how difficult this case will be.�

&nbsp;

�You know everything you need to
know.� Why are you waiting?�

&nbsp;

Indeed, why was I waiting?� �You,� I replied truthfully, �are very
beautiful.�

&nbsp;

She looked at me as she said, �Do you
want the dress off or not?� You are shy.�
I don�t know how you ever get what you want.�� This was the first time in about twenty-five
years that I could remember being called shy.�
She stood and unbuttoned her dress all the way down the front.� With a shrug of her shoulders, she let it
drop to the floor, then sat on the edge of the bed again.� 

&nbsp;

Rebecca wore a shear bra that showed off
a firm, high set of breasts with small light brown aureoles and light rose
nipples.� But she still had her half-slip
on and I knew without a doubt that it was going to be very nice when she took
that off---and her panties.

&nbsp;

She now changed her thoughts again and
her voice was strong. �I want you to beat these charges against me, to get me
off completely.� Don�t underestimate me
on this.� I want this badly.� Do you understand?�

&nbsp;

I looked up at her and lied smoothly,
�Don�t worry.� We have time now to
prepare your defense.�� God, she was so
needy that I could have told her anything and she would have believed it.� I continued rubbing her feet and saw her face
finally begin to relax.

&nbsp;

She sighed, �That will be good.� It wasn�t entirely my fault, but what I did
was stupid; I would like this situation behind me.� 

&nbsp;

It seemed that I had earned my
reward.� Rebecca now shifted on the bed,
revealing a firm thigh.� �Would you like
me to take off my slip now?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, I would.�� My heart was beating hard as she teased off
the top of her slip and slowly slid it down her legs.� I felt my throat constrict and I became fully
erect.� She leaned forward and pulled me
towards her even as I was running my hand across her upper leg.� 

&nbsp;

Even as I spoke, I felt like I was in a
fog.� All of my predatory instincts
warned me to take care with this woman.�
I felt I knew her so much better than any of the others that I had
brought here before because I had spent so much more time investigating this
woman.� I knew her likes and dislikes,
her strengths and weaknesses, her history with her husband and before that in
college and high school.� I knew enough
about her to respect her for both her beauty and the intelligence to use it to
her best advantage.� And yet, when she
arose and slipped off her bra and laid it on the bed, I felt it draw me like a
mouse to cheese.� Rebecca�s bare chest
rose and fell in front of me.� I found
the movement hypnotic.� Playing with her
thong, she teased me as I undressed for her.�
When I was nude, she pulled me onto the bed beside her.� She removed her thong and I could see that
she was absolutely hairless there; from the way she normally dressed, I would
not have predicted this in a million years.�
It was obvious that she was aroused, her vagina was moist and her labia
already somewhat engorged.� 

&nbsp;

I had never seen this before in a woman
and could not believe how sexy it was to see her vaginal lips exposed to my
view like that.� Rebecca had terrific lips,
and this pair was the best.� If the
genetic cards had been cut the other way and she�d been born male, she would
have been hung like a horse.

&nbsp;

Now she began to use her hands on me,
giving me tremendous pleasure as she pulled a condom out of her purse and put
it on my raging erection.� Somewhere deep
in my mind, a thought flashed; why am I allowing this?� It should have been different---all the
others were.� 

&nbsp;

The she sat down astride me and the
sight of her made my throat dry.� She
grasped me and played with me, using her body and her hands until I felt like I
had reached the outer limits of desire.�
I wasn�t inside her yet, but I ached to achieve that release.� Instead, I reached around and grabbed two
full handfuls of her ass.� After I had
held them for a moment, I reached around with my left hand and began to draw a
tight circle around her anus.� Soon, I
had begun to insert my finger inside her rear.�


&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

Men
are all alike.� I hate it when they
played with me like that---I wasn�t their personal toy.� I was pretty sure that I could get him to do
what I wanted, but I think that was because he really wanted this weekend.� In any case, like him I had enjoyed the
preliminary rounds, but I also made it very clear that I wouldn�t go any
further unless he was wearing protection.�
I don�t think he liked that, but since he could tell that I was serious,
it didn�t seem to be too much of a problem to him.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

Rebecca stopped all motion and looked at
me with a completely flat look on her face.�
�Stop that,� she said.� �I don�t
like men doing that, playing with me like I�m a Barbie doll or something.�� 

&nbsp;

This woman was a total mystery to
me.� Professionally asexual at work, but
sexy as hell now; yet at the same time there were oddly definite lines over
which she would not venture.� It was all
very strange, but I was patient because I somehow knew that we were embarking
on a journey that would end with her investigating those lines---and many more
forbidden limits after that.� 

&nbsp;

This was without a doubt the most beautiful
woman I had ever been with.� She was here
willingly, even if under false circumstances.�
If this were fiction---the kind the author wants you to believe---I
would tell you that everything was drowned out by the completely overwhelming
physical sensations of what we were doing together.� That this gorgeous female had perfected
unnameable skills and delights, and was an Olympic champion of sex.

&nbsp;

I realized afterwards, she was okay.

&nbsp;

For the first time on a purely physical
level, a little better than okay.� Little
of the initial awkwardness.� She knew all
the things an experienced woman should know, and did them well.� Nothing she did startled me and she was quite
direct about asking what I wanted.� She
neither hid nor seemed to inflate her enjoyment, and was perhaps a little less
vocal than most of the women that I had collected over the last year.� She came fairly quickly, but did not make a
big squealing deal of her orgasm.� And
yet, while she was not self-conscious, she was to some extent self-involved,
removed.� I understood this but felt a
tang of resentment nonetheless, for even if she was not here willingly, she
still needed what she thought I could give her.

&nbsp;

Suddenly she moved to the side and began
to use her tongue on my scrotum and lower stomach, while at the same time she
stroked my erection with her hand.� She
made me feel young, and yes, powerful because even while she was in trouble,
she had still chosen to accept me as her protector.� I realized that THAT was the power that she
held over men.� And even as I felt myself
falling into Rebecca, I knew that if I wasn�t careful she would try to make a
chump out of me too.� Wanting to totally
possess a woman like her was a classic personality flaw; but at the same time,
I knew that it would be wonderful too.

&nbsp;

And then with one move of her hips, she
sank on me---I was in her and she was moving on me, moist and hot and
tight.� The sensations of her moving
against me, her ass on my thighs, her flesh engulfing mine, her muscles
grasping me and then letting go, it all sent me into a daze.� 

&nbsp;

But as intimately as we were joined,
parts of us were still separate.� She
missed subtle clues.� Some of the clues
that she gave must have been too subtle for me to follow.� Twice my cock slipped out of her vagina because
she zigged when I zagged.� I could not
totally leave my skull, my body, my identity---partly because I could tell that
she was still in hers.� I could feel it
in a barely perceptible tension of the skin, and see it in her eyes.� I could almost see her straining against the
insides of those remarkable eyes, trying to break out.� The eyes of a wolf.

&nbsp;

I felt her touch my shoulder and I
understood that she wanted me to roll.�
In a flash, I was on top and she pulled her legs up and ran them along
my flanks.� I pounded into her as hard as
I could and she either grunted or gave out a deep groan with every move of my
hips.� 

&nbsp;

My hands found their way to her throat
and I applied a light pressure, choking her at the same time as I fucked
her.� Her nails remained digging into my
shoulders, never fighting me as her face began to get more and more
flushed.� I wouldn�t let her breathe and
soon her head was moving back and forth on the pillow; suddenly she surprised
me when she reached around and clenched my balls in her hand as I was thrusting
into her.� I looked down into her arctic
blue eyes---they were slitted and gleaming, and I felt like I had conquered
all.� I let go of her neck and raised
myself up on my elbows to look down on her as she continued to stroke and
fondle my scrotum.� I was huge and as
hard as a bar of iron�..I pounded into her like a stallion, never stopping,
never slowing.� I think that I pounded
her for hours and days, and the fury in my loins continued to build and build
until I thought the top of my head would explode.� Suddenly I couldn�t keep it inside me anymore
and I poured into the condom.� I could
feel her abdominal muscles convulse under my belly again and again as she
appeared to cum at the same time too.�
And at the end, she milked me with her vaginal muscles, draining every
drop of seed that I had in me.

&nbsp;

I learned a great many things about Rebecca in a short
period.� Some were of small consequence,
like the highest note that her alto voice could reach.� It seemed to go on for countless hours this
time, and be over before it had begun.�
Compared to hers, my completion was thunderous and abrupt.� The �afterglow� period of delicious
brainlessness could be measured in microseconds, and then wham, I was back in
my own skull, meditating on well, that
wasn�t as good as I hoped nor as bad as I feared.� She�ll be doing better soon.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

God,
it felt good.� Our bodies fit together
perfectly even though I was a little rusty.�
But his love-making had been smooth, practiced and knowledgeable.� His erection was long and heavy, his flesh
rigid and I had the perfect place to put it.�
I didn�t know him, so I was determined that he would always wear
protection.� There would to be no chance
of a child and no chance of disease with this man.� I had smoothed the condom over him with no
argument; it did little to take away the immediate pleasure of the sensations
he gave me.� When I sat on him that first
time, I instantly knew that this would be a good weekend.� I would begin to see the solutions to my
problems and come away relaxed, perhaps even finding my first satisfaction in
over nine months.� God, how I had missed
that with my husband.

&nbsp;

I
moved my hips once just a little and he disappeared inside me.� There was some discomfort---it was a tight at
first since he was rather large and I was a little out of practice.� A little out of practice?� I was a lot out of practice.� But I could feel myself stretching to
accommodate him in the lubricated rubber and knew that everything would be
fine.

&nbsp;

I
soon got tired of doing all of the work, so let him know that I wanted him
driving.� When he drove into me for the
first time from on top, I could feel his thick cock pushing against the inside
of my vagina; the veins bulging from his penis as if they had been carved on the
outside of a thick rod of marble.� He
laid high on my belly and looked me in the eyes, and every time he slammed into
my pussy, there was an amazing friction as he rubbed my clit.� It was wonderful.� 

&nbsp;

As
his hands closed around my neck, I felt the sheer animal passion building
inside me.� The need for air in my lungs
continued to build more and more, but I didn�t care---the wave was coming and
it was carrying me with it.� I knew that
I should feel some guilt about this, but it felt too damn good to worry right
now.� I hadn�t enjoyed a man in so long
that I almost couldn�t remember the last time, and that definitely wasn�t like
me.� Finally, to make sure that he gave
me what I wanted, I grabbed his sack and massaged it while he hammered into
me.� At the end, he was bent over sucking
on my breasts and I was so close.� And
yet�.and yet�it was not to be.� 

&nbsp;

I had a small, rather long orgasm but pretended to
something greater that first time.� At
the end, I grabbed him with the muscles in my vagina.� This ability was a gift that I have had from
the beginning, and when I finished extracting every drop of semen from him, he
had a shell-shocked look on his face that I have come to know well.� Every man that I have ever fucked will take
that memory with him to the grave.� The
skin from his back was under my nails and I know that I hurt him, but he didn�t
seem to mind too much.� God, I still
hadn�t really cum myself like I knew I needed, but the weekend was not finished
yet.� It was wonderful enough and
enormously satisfying, but always it seemed I performed with the distance and
loneliness of someone who could never quite give all of herself.� All I
knew was that it felt good to get rid of the sexual tension that I had felt for
so long.� 

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

That evening, all we did was screw.� By midnight, we were both
exhausted.� I fell asleep with this new
woman in my arms.� Later, in an
asymmetrical way, my body woke up before my mind.� Have you ever awakened to find that you are
making love?� And that you have been for
some indeterminate time, under the impression that you were dreaming?� An indescribable experience.� 

&nbsp;

My mind�s awakening was a slow,
sequential process---a series of cumulative steps.� I am fucking.�
I live.� I am a mammal.� I�m in my home.� This is nice.�
This is good fucking I�m getting.�
Things like that.� I became aware
of Rebecca�s existence almost in the same instance that I became aware of my
own.�� My next thought was I�d like to
keep her here doing this for another week.�


&nbsp;

She was bent over my groin and although
she never touched me there with her lips, she was taking deep strokes with her
hand.� Again, she put another condom on
me and we fucked like tomorrow would never come and then, totally fatigued, I
fell into an exhausted sleep.� My last
thought was that my penis ached from all of the sexual demands that this woman
had made upon me over the last nine hours.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Chapter 10: Beauty makes us dream of both reverence and rape;
Mason Cooley.

&nbsp;

For some reason, I awakened the next morning as suddenly as a cork�s
pop from a champagne bottle.� I jerked to
a sitting position in bed, uncertain as to what had aroused me.� The bed next to me was empty.� Panicking, I looked around and finally
noticed that she was in the shower.

&nbsp;

In some odds ways, what we had done last night better defined the
barriers between us and made us even further apart then when we had begun.� Under her professionally manufactured calm,
she was terrified, scared right down to her bones.� It seemed as if she needed sex, to calm her
nerves.� And it wasn�t helping as much as
she had hoped.� But that didn�t matter to
me now.

&nbsp;

This morning was it; she had not resisted when I had choked her
last night.� Now I planned on pushing
this woman until I discovered her limits---or at least the ones that interested
me.� The brain, which is the sole organ for each of us that truly experiences
pleasure and pain, is deluged with sensory data.� To make order out of the incoming sensory
chaos, we have what is called a 'pain
gate'.� This doorway functions as a
threshold, limiting incoming sensory data to what is necessary to process for
perception.� At the same time, this
gateway also organizes sensory components, ensuring that no sensations are left
unrecognized.� All of this is automatic,
thus leaving it to the more evolved cerebral centers to accept or reject,
perceive or ignore what is let through.�
In most, but not all people, pain and pleasure are finely balanced
against each other, maintaining an almost reciprocal relationship to each
other.

&nbsp;

But just as excess pleasure can easily
begin to be eventually experienced as pain; a surplus of pain can also begin to
simulate increasing pleasure.� Over time,
the pleasure/pain pathways can sometimes begin to merge perceptually/experientially
without the individual realizing that this has even happened.� So, in a lucky few, when pleasure approaches
a maximum potential on its own, painful stimuli may then be added to increase
the sensation of pleasure far beyond what the gate can admit at one time.� In these cases, almost no matter what is
done, you may know it as pain but everything is perceived as pleasurable.� 

&nbsp;

Soon Rebecca stepped out of the shower stall and onto the tiled
floor.� As she dried her self off, she
moved the towel over her body as if in a peep show.� I couldn�t help it; as soon as the now more
familiar parts of her body were first uncovered, then covered by the towel once
more, I was hard as a rock again.� Even
as my erection stood straight up, my cock ached from all of the unaccustomed
exercise.

&nbsp;

When she glanced down and saw my erection, she hesitated for a
second and then let out a big sigh.� She
now reached for me and pushed me back a bit.�
She settled down on me after she�d put a condom on me.� As with last night, she was very tight at
first as she hunkered down, but after she�d grabbed me with her vaginal
muscles, she began to move slowly.�
Finally, I was completely buried inside her and within minutes, the
tightness of her muscles and the softness and moist heat of her vagina had
aroused me near to orgasm.� Her back
became taut and I could feel the muscles like steel bands above her buttocks as
she carefully orchestrated the level of friction between us with her pubic
bone.� 

&nbsp;

My eyes traveled up her splendid nude body; she was wearing the
smile of the canary that had swallowed the cat.�
Spontaneously, we began rocking together even harder.� God, it was as if her body were a suction cup
pulled tight to mine.� Her breathing
became strong and I tasted the salty new sweat between her breasts.� When her nipples were hard and the size of
thimbles, I took the right one into my mouth and used my tongue so that she
shuddered and moved even harder down on me.�
Then I took her breasts, one in each hand and made a continuous milking
motion as I stroked their magical softness.�


&nbsp;

Even as I became totally lost inside Rebecca, I began to work on
her body.� Trying my best to lock out
what I was feeling in my groin, I took both of her nipples between my thumbs
and forefingers and slowly pressed them almost flat before I began to twist
them.� At first I only turned them a
little, but as she continued fucking me without response to what I was doing to
her breasts, I became more and more aggressive.�
Soon, I was squeezing and rotating her nipples almost 180 degrees.� I knew that this was quite painful to most
women, for it was at this point that they would pull back and demand that I
stop.� If I didn�t, I was often slapped
in the face.� 

&nbsp;

But every now and then I found a woman that was wired a little
differently, �gating� the pain as
pleasure rather than ache.� Even when
manipulated into an unforgiving situation as I had just done with Rebecca,
these few women were the ones that not only accepted pain, but used it to take
them towards ever greater heights of pleasure and satisfaction.� The undefined boundaries that each of these
particular women possessed and which we explored together led to continually
higher plateaus of pure sexual gratification.�
In the end, these women generally wound up having few limits or
restrictions on what they would allow me to do to them; the lines over which I
might erroneously cross were almost nonexistent.� It was a powerful and sweet and heady sexual
experience.

&nbsp;

Rebecca moaned once as I began to twist her nipples, then she
closed her eyes, arched her back and let her head roll on a neck that was
suddenly slack.� Her hands dug into my
shoulders as she leaned into me and suddenly she began making a series of
small, quick adjustments on me with her hips.�
Even through the condom, I felt a tremendous moist heat enclose my cock
as her vagina grasped me even tighter and her hips continued to grind into my
belly with her jerky moves---even as I crushed her nipples, she was
experiencing the small climaxes that led up to the big explosion.� Her luscious lips assumed a moue of total
abandon as she closed her eyes to concentrate on what just she alone was
experiencing.

&nbsp;

Appearances, as they say, can be deceiving.� Sexually, Rebecca could only accept what she allowed; and by this act, she felt
she was always in control.� Eternally
cool and beautiful on the outside, when women like Rebecca were finally
awakened, they were as hot as lava on the inside; wanton and lusty and
abandoned when forced beyond their self-imposed boundaries.� Pain is like an aphrodisiac to some women and
it made them go places that they didn�t want to go.� The woman on top of me was like that.

&nbsp;

Now I pulled her down by her red and swollen nipples and put them
in my mouth.� The slickness of her flesh
made a giant quivering in my thighs and I could feel her perfect rhythm, now
like a galloping horse hard on to the finish line; and then she moaned deep and
long, and I let myself cum and I felt strong.�
So strong.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I lay awake in bed beside
him for an hour before I moved.� Smelling
like a prostitute, I decided to take a quick shower.� Even though I didn�t really want to be here
with him, I had made a deal to be his temporary whore so that he would help me;
and I would keep the bargain I had made.�
Thankfully, he was a fairly considerate lover and easy to satisfy.� Last night had been like almost every other
night in my life few years when I was with a man----I hadn�t cum myself, but I
faked it a lot and had been VERY good to him---he was exhausted.� I think that explains why he never once moved
when I got up and took a shower.� But he
was sitting up in bed with an odd expression on his face when I had
finished.� Sooooo, I admit to taking a
few liberties with the towel as I dried myself and when I was finished, I
wasn�t particularly surprised to see the obvious tent pole that he couldn�t
hide beneath the sheet.

&nbsp;

I had just cleaned myself
and wasn�t really in the mood to get dirty again, but it was clear that my host
was.� And since I was his �guest�
and that had been part of the deal, it appeared that I didn�t have a lot of say
in the matter.� I sighed to myself and it
began again; after I had protected myself from him with the rubber, I mounted
him just as I had last night.� I had no
time to prepare myself and was painfully dry.�
But the condom was lubricated and after I parted myself with my left
hand, he was able to enter me without too much difficulty.� As before, he easily filled me and�..it felt
good.� I settled on his hips and
continually rocked as I rode him; he liked this and groaned in obvious
pleasure.� We were doing the same old
thing the same old way and if I wasn�t bored, I was, let us say �currently
not interested�, but at least he�d get
what he wanted.

&nbsp;

I stayed on top and even as
I maintained complete control of our lovemaking, he suddenly surprised me.� My nipples are super-sensitive.� Every man that I have ever been with has
quickly figured this out and while most have tried to use this to give
themselves (and sometimes me if they were thoughtful) pleasure; for me there
have only been a few truly memorable rides---only a few times in my youth that
I had felt safe enough, uninhibited enough to give myself to a lover that was
also skilled enough to give me what I needed.�


&nbsp;

But instead of rubbing my
nipples between his finger tips or rolling them between his fingers or even
sucking on them like most men would do, instead he was brutal.� This man mashed them together quite hard and
then he rolled them between his fingers.�
He did this to both of my nipples at the same time; it was sheer agony
and it literally took my breath away.�
This kind of existential pain was new to me and the feelings were so
intense that it was quite shocking at first; I couldn�t believe that my first
instinct was not to scream and slap his face.�
Instead��.I can�t explain what I felt, except to say that suddenly I
felt daring and alive again and every nerve in my body felt like it was firing
overtime.� He was still hurting me and I
definitely felt the pain, but my whole body seemed to shudder and then my
consciousness became focused around what this strange man was doing to me.� 

&nbsp;

The
pain in my breasts as he brutally crushed them, the way he attacked my nipples
without mercy, the fullness I felt inside as I rode his rigid pole, it was all
connected somehow and it felt totally overwhelming.� I still felt like I was perhaps in control,
but at the same time I could feel a wave of pure abandon crashing throughout
me.� I knew that I didn�t want that with
him, not with this man, not in his bed and not on this morning.� But sometimes we have little choice in what
happens to us---you can�t choose the ways in which you are tested.� I felt paralyzed as he impaled me, unable to
move as he pulled and crushed and squeezed and fucked me.� And even as I recognized this last thought,
the little control over my body that still remained to me fled.� 

&nbsp;

My
body tingled and buzzed all over.� There
was no up or down with what he did to me, no getting close to the edge and
backing off.� He kept me on the verge,
continually floating, hovering on the brink until I was the one that threw
myself over the precipice with complete disregard for what it might mean. �And for the first time in as long as I could
remember, I abandoned myself to my body�s delights.� Much, much later, as I was still drifting in
a haze of post-orgasmic delight, I found that I was able to begin thinking
again.� But still, half my thoughts kept
wandering back to the warm liquid feeling in my stomach and the faint iron
memory of him as he slowly pushed into me�it was wonderful.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

Much of the pleasure I get out of sex is oral and Rebecca had
beautiful breasts.� Each about the size
of two fists, they were perfectly proportioned for her build; they were firm,
identical in size and she was young enough that they still rode high on her
chest.� Her aureoles were small and a
light pinkish-brown in color, while her nipples were a lighter pink color and
absolutely huge when erect.� I had never
met a woman who was capable of becoming more quickly turned on by having her
breasts manipulated and touched than she.�
When I controlled her in a rough manner through her nipples, she fought
me for only a short second and then with a look of total surprise, suddenly
gave herself to me with wild abandon.� 

&nbsp;

Regardless of how a man may feel about himself, most assume their
sexual prowess as a given.�� And like
most women, Rebecca was an excellent actress in bed.� I could never be sure how well I had
satisfied her on our first night.� But
now I knew for sure.� She couldn�t be
that good of an actress.� And for the
first time since we were together, I knew that Rebecca was not faking an
orgasm.� Once I had started her on the
long journey down this path, she couldn�t stop on her own�.and I wouldn�t let
her.� I could literally get her off
multiple times by just taking slow, easy advantage of her sensitive buds.� She would shudder and scream and then
cum.� And then I would start over and
make her scream and cum again and again.�
Her chest and face took on the tinge of the softest rose as blood
permeated next to the surface of her skin.�
Soon, if I allowed it, she would then become more pale again as it was
later flushed away.

&nbsp;

After I had made her cum numerous times, she sat upon me
exhausted.� I began to roll up on one
elbow, with a view towards walking my fingers down her belly and diddling
her.� She pushed me back flat on the bed
and continued to sit astride me.� I had
both palms full of her buttocks and coaxed her a little more forward.� �Magnificent,� I said with great sincerity as
the sweet knurled pinkness was brought more into my view.� I reached around her thighs and took each of
her lips between forefinger and thumb and tugged them gently up and out,
opening the orchid---and for the first time I truly understood what that symbol
is that we call a heart, even though a heart looks nothing like that; it was
like understanding what we admire in the butterfly.� Like gossamer butterfly wings, I tugged them
down towards me, pursed my lips and blew a stream of cool air up and down the
channel they formed.� Rebecca hissed with
pleasure.� I heard her murmur something
too soft to hear.� The bouquet was rare,
the sauce piquant, the meaty petals delicious---both separately and
together.� I feasted.� Rebecca�s fingers explored my hair and guided
me�.� Her clitoris, proportioned to match
those labia, was like a miniature penis under my tongue.� I experimented; she gulped air.� It was a working miniature.� Her thighs clamped my ears, I tasted a trace
of��.

&nbsp;

Her cues were unmistakable.�
For the first time this morning, she wanted to be on the bottom and have
me plowing into her.� She spread her
knees continually wider and always begged for more at the end.� All control was gone.� And when I sucked on her nipples after she�d
cum multiple times, they had a taste that was quite different than before; a
unique, erotic musky flavor that I tasted only on the back of my tongue and
which originated only from women that were truly orgasmic.� It was a flavor that drove me wild.

&nbsp;

Rebecca seemed to somehow sublimate for a time her need to control
her partner; we clicked into a world of our own, never getting out of bed that
Saturday except to eat.� My cock ached
from the unending physical need.� But at
the end, she too had had enough, begging me to stop---she was so sensitive all over
her body now that my attentions had finally gotten too intense for even
her.� The early evening had turned warm
enough that we now sat naked making small talk on the balcony in back, drinking
wine and eating cheese.� We were
exhausted and at the end I served her multiple strong coffees.� This made her visibly less pale, but
something about it struck me false, like the temporarily alert feeling you
might get from amphetamines.� 

&nbsp;

The last rays of the setting sun covered everything in a cast of
blood.� God, she was beautiful.� Blonde-white hair ensnaring the heavens in a
warm blanket, her face the hardness of the mountains and the softness of the
fields---she was beautiful and terrifying and comforting all at the same
time.� Her expression was one of sleepy-lidded
contentment----Buddha after a heavy meal.�
We talked a little, but not too much.�
Rebecca didn�t seem to fit the usual mold as regards small talk---I
don�t know, perhaps it was the situation.�
And finally, when it got too cold, we went back in my bedroom and
screwed some more.� 

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

Saturday still remains much
of a mystery to me, but I do know that I have never cum like that before.� All I remember is him being on top of me and
then I was on top of him.� I remember the
pleasure and the ache as he did things to me, and how I tingled all over my
body time after time.� I felt almost a
sense of euphoria when we were done.� We
ate in the afternoon and then we fucked some more.� And then we fell asleep, our arms and legs
intertwined.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I didn�t open my eyes, but
I smiled and stretched on the expensive sheets, making a happy kitten
noise.� I had slept well in his bed and I
was so perfectly comfortable that I just didn�t want to get up.� I could smell a soft hint of his
cologne.� He waited patiently for me to
rouse myself---I had needed to be spoiled and he was so good for this.� He lifted my arm and kissed the back of my
hand.� I finally opened my eyes to see
him sitting on the edge of the bed looking down at me.� I had felt him get up some time earlier, but
he was still wearing nothing.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

Sunday morning, I decided to have her dress up and we would go out
to eat as if returning from church.�
Rebecca acted differently towards me now.� Most of the reserve seemed gone and she
laughed more; it seemed she might even be honestly enjoying herself.� As for me, I think that in a way she had
bewitched me, for at this point, I honestly didn�t care if she knew where I
lived or not.� I asked her to model the
clothes that she had brought with her.�
As she laid out her things, it quickly became clear that the only
choices suitable for our excursion were the black dress that she had worn on
Friday and a sexy, short black cocktail dress.�
Knowing that no one would believe that she had worn the second dress to
church yet not caring, I told Rebecca that I wanted her to wear the short black
dress.

&nbsp;

I went into the guest bathroom and showered.� She was just getting out of the shower in my
bathroom when I returned.� After she had
dried herself off, she rubbed baby oil into her skin all over her body, but
especially concentrating on her legs and feet.�
She positively glowed at the end.�
For the first time, I noticed that her toenails were painted a light
pink color.� I have to admit that I
enjoyed just sitting and watching her do this.�
It was maybe a little too domestic, but at the same time it somehow also
felt satisfying and relaxing.� 

&nbsp;

She sat on a stool, her feet planted slightly apart and dropped
her head between her knees, spraying her hair so that when she sat up, it was
heavy and glossy against her white skin.�
Then she began applying her makeup; with her coloring, she generally
didn�t use bright shocking colors, but after she put on a light base, this time
she chose a deep red lipstick and put on heavier than normal eye makeup.� Whatever she�d done to her eyes, she was
bewitchingly beautiful.� 

&nbsp;

Except for a few quick glances, she had ignored me the whole time
she was getting ready, but that was okay because I was busy setting out
clothing for her to wear.� When she finished
her makeup, she let the towel drop and automatically began to put on a pair of
thongs.� I looked at her and said, �I
want you to wear these with your dress.��
�These� were a black lace garter belt and sheer black hose.� 

&nbsp;

She looked at me and laughed softly, �You naughty boy.�� 

&nbsp;

As a man, I guess that I don�t appreciate the efficiency of
pantyhose.� I know that they are more
comfortable to women than stockings, but pantyhose have also deprived we males
of some truly beautiful sights.� At the
same time, I also don�t appreciate thigh-highs either.� They seem too�.self-contained for me.� I like the openness, the vulnerability that
is implied by a piece of lace snugly fitted around a woman�s waist, the thin
elastic straps hanging down and supporting sheer perfection as it caresses a
woman�s ankles, calves and thighs.� And
every one of these things leads up to and only emphasizes the beauty that a
female holds between her legs.

&nbsp;

I admit to having been a leg man for as long as I can remember; my
life has been a nylon delight of voyeurism.�
I have numerous stocking vignettes, but catching a glimpse of the
stocking welt under a woman�s dress is at the top of my list of totally erotic
sights; and watching a woman put on stockings is one of the most visually erotic
encounters that I could ever experience.�
Rebecca proved this to me as she stood up and removed her thong without
a trace of embarrassment, and then picked up the garter belt.� It was black and had lace designs on the
inch-wide belt, while the garters themselves were fairly plain and unadorned
with any detail.� She stepped into the
garter belt, and pulled it up around her waist and then tightened it a
little.� Next she shortened each garter
to make sure that there would be good tension on the top of her hose.� I had not yet seen her wear stockings of any
type, but it was obvious that she had worn hose like these before.

&nbsp;

I had a selection of new satiny evening weight sheer stockings in
a box.� She chose sheer toe and heel hose
that were a light nude color because of her fair skin.� The nylons had a slightly darker lacy welt
that was about three inches wide.� Fine
designs of a darker color were worked into this.� I love seeing ultra sheer stockings on a
woman because they �glimmer� so much
more when the light reflects off them, and they feel so very smooth to the
touch when I run my hands up and down their legs.� Also, the sheer stockings give a quiet
&quot;swishing&quot; sound that drives me nuts whenever she walked or rubbed
her thighs together.

&nbsp;

Rebecca sat down on the edge of the bed and after she had rolled
one of the stockings into a bunch in both her hands, she pointed her right foot
and reached down to insert her arched toes into the hose.� Working slowly to avoid snags, she pulled the
stocking up her leg, first around her ankle and then up her calf.� Rocking her hands a little, she coaxed and
dragged the stocking to the top of her thigh.�
Still seated, she stretched her leg out straight and pointed her toes,
then tugged on the top of the nylon again to make sure that she had it up as
high on her thigh as it would go.�
Finally, she fastened the two garters on her right side to the heavier
lace top of her stocking, one garter at a time.�


&nbsp;

Finished with her right leg, she began the same procedure with her
left.� When both her legs were finally
encased in nylons, she reached over and picked up the heels that I had
provided.� They were the strappy black
sandals with five inch stiletto heels that I had made her purchase on
Friday.� Two thin straps criss-crossed
over her toes and another strap rose from around both side of the heel of her
foot.� The straps that rose from her
heels were met in back by four thin ankle straps which wrapped around her ankle
and then buckled around the front to keep the sandals on her feet.� I could see her painted toenails through her
stockings.� The sheer hose combined with
the high-heeled sandals gave Rebecca�s legs a sleek and elegant look and made a
great pair of legs look fabulous.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

He urged me to put them on,
but it had been long enough now that I had almost forgotten the feeling of
stockings like these.� I had begun to
avoid pantyhose and stockings because they made my legs feel so hot.� I hated the sweaty confined feeling they gave
me.� But if this made him happy��.

&nbsp;

On the floor was a small
box containing �my� stockings, all packages still unopened.� I knelt on the floor and tipped the box open
with one finger.� I took one to the bed
and tore the cellophane.� For a long time
I sat with the sheer stockings unrolled across my lap, my hands resting lightly
on the translucent fabric.� They were as
fine and light as a spider�s web, and without thinking what it would mean, I
finally pulled them on, allowing myself to remember the luxury of their soft,
gloved protection.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

The heels on her shoes were so high that it took her a moment to
be able to balance on them before she could move.� Rebecca now did one of the sexiest things I
have ever seen a woman do.� She was aware
of my presence, but studiously ignored me.�
I watched in rapt fascination as she put her right foot up on the bed,
slowly bent over from the waist and then wrapped both of her hands around her
ankle.� Keeping her left leg straight,
she slowly began to slide her hands up her right leg, pushing any excess nylon
ahead of her hands.

&nbsp;

When her hands had finally slid to the top of her thigh, she put
her foot on the floor, unsnapped each garter one at a time and then re-hooked
it again after tugging on her stocking and pulling up any excess material from
around her leg.� She then repeated this
with her left leg.� My control was almost
gone; the look of her bare ass pointed into the air while she took care of the
stockings on her legs had been almost too much for me to resist.

&nbsp;

As Rebecca leaned over to re-attach her garters to her stockings,
her hair hung down and covered her face.�
Her breasts bobbed as she moved, pushed together by her arms as she
concentrated on her legs, creating deep shadows in her now exaggerated
cleavage.� It was another amazingly
erotic sight, one that I would never forget.�
What a beautiful woman!

&nbsp;

We�d been fucking so much that I really hadn�t had a chance to
fully appreciate Rebecca.� She had
incredibly long legs.� Her toes were
straight and well formed, her feet small and her ankles were shapely; her legs
were slim yet well muscled, her calves seductively emphasized by the heels she
wore.� I watched the smooth interplay of
muscles on her legs, especially the small, fine ones around her ankles and
behind the knees.� In my mind, I sampled
the small shadows that played on her legs when the silky fabric of her hose
caught the late morning light.� I love
the shine and luster, the luminosity continually reflected by a woman�s nylons;
shades of darkness and pale pastels, elegant reflections of flowing light which
incessantly change as compact muscles play under soft, yet firm skin.

&nbsp;

When she turned her back, it seemed that it was only to flaunt her
beautiful, muscular ass to me.� An
athlete�s ass, round and firm and high, nothing detracted from its compact and
solid beauty.� Now Rebecca had turned to
face me again as she looked at herself in the mirror and my eyes traveled up
from the brooding lips of her naked vagina to her narrow waist and flat belly.� I realized suddenly that I was staring; if
one thought of her stocking tops as horizontal lines, the garter straps as
vertical lines and then the garter belt as a top horizontal line�..well, in the
middle they perfectly framed heaven.� 

&nbsp;

At other times and on other women, I have perceived these
identical things not as lines, but rather curves---the fit of the garter belt
around the waist and the curve of the stocking tops as they are clasped.� And if they have the proper tension, these
curves represent to me the ultimate in femininity.� At the same time, the tension of the
suspenders also sometimes suggests a feminine tumescence...

&nbsp;

The sheer variety of textures and colors that can co-exist under a
woman�s skirt (stretchy garters and the buttons on the clasps, the differing
length of the welt hinted at as the top of the stocking presses tightly into
firm thighs, the two-toned nylon color and the exposed skin above), they all
bewitch men and combine to create a sense of the stage.� They make you feel a hushed expectancy as you
wait for the curtain to rise on the most unpredictable of sets; and yet, and
yet��.� 

&nbsp;

I was always somehow disappointed in the soft pornography that
pushed these things into my face---this was far too obvious and never for
me.� I was always more
interested in an authentic or unrehearsed human experience, which I think is
much harder to find---unless you had the luxury of planning the encounter, as I
did.

&nbsp;

I shook these thoughts out of my head and sighed.� From the ecstasy that could be framed by
either lines or curves, my eyes quickly moved to her breasts, and I knew that
they were perfect.� Damn, I thought to
myself; what a waste on a young boy that could never truly appreciate the
perfection of a woman like this.

&nbsp;

I have collected many beautiful women, but this was the first time
that I had a woman in my home with her kind of beauty.� The lines of her legs, the curve of her
belly, the pouty hairless lips between her thighs, the tight lines of muscle in
her thighs, these all were incredibly sexy to me.� But none of these things mattered to Rebecca,
for she accepted these as her right.�
Heels and stockings now on to her satisfaction, Rebecca now slowly
walked back to the bed and picked up the thong and a clean bra.� I shook my head no and said, �You only get to
wear the garter and stockings under the dress.�
No panties and no bra.� My rules
this weekend.� Remember?�

&nbsp;

Rebecca smiled at me like I was an adolescent boy-child and shook
her head.� Then she picked up her dress,
raised both arms and pulled it over her head; it first covered her firm breasts
and then she tugged it on down to her waist where it bunched a little.� Thin spaghetti straps held the dress up as it
barely cupped her breasts and then daringly dived in back.� She pulled on the bottom of the dress and
wiggled her hips seductively; it settled snugly on her body.� She turned and asked me to zip up the little
remaining fabric that covered her back.�
Reaching into her overnight bag, she pulled out a black faux pearl
choker and had me fasten it in back.� The
dress showed significant cleavage and it was obvious that she wore no bra.� What wasn�t so obvious was the garter belt
and lack of panties underneath.� Finally,
she took out a tiny black sexy jacket and put that over her shoulders.

&nbsp;

I couldn�t help myself as I looked at her again.� At first glance, her face seemed unreal, like
something molded out of pure porcelain.�
Her cheekbones were like Colorado ski slopes and her eyes the color of an
over-chlorinated swimming pool.� Her long
blond-white hair flowed down around her shoulders, a glowing contrast to her
tiny black dress.� Looking at her, I
realized that Rebecca had that innate ability to dominate a room---or a
conversation---without saying a word; was that why she had this effect on me?� 

&nbsp;

She looked like royalty, but there was no
trace of haughtiness in her eyes at the moment.�
She was beautiful�and she was mine.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I could feel his eyes on my
all but naked back as I walked over to the full-length mirror on the closet
door and looked at myself.� The dress
held me closely, touching me, making me want to push back at it in places.� I felt more comfortable around him now and
the whole moment was so perfect.� Men
were like children; they were so easy when sex was involved.� That was good because even though I had had
perhaps the best sex of my life yesterday, I was still conscious of the fact
that he had forced me to do this for him in order to obtain his help.� If I had met him a few years ago under
different circumstances, I think I could have liked him and things might have
been different.� But we hadn�t and they
weren�t.

&nbsp;

Mindful that I was making
this more erotic just for his benefit, I shifted my weight and performed a
quick turn on the impossible heels that he seemed to like.� Light as a feather, the dress floated out
away from my thighs and it seemed almost transparent at that moment.� He seemed transfixed by my breasts as they
seemed to bob with my slightest move.�
Personally, I liked the way the darker stocking welts showed at the tops
of my thighs beneath the dress when I moved too quickly---men are so visually
aroused and this would make him helpless.�
As he watched me, it became apparent that he had another erection and
could do nothing to hide it.� The dress
had been exactly the right choice.� Thank God for little black dresses.

&nbsp;

I knew that this man must
by nature be a pig---he wouldn�t have put me in this situation if he
wasn�t.� I stopped for a second�..that
hadn�t been fair.� He was still a pig,
but I knew that my situation was entirely my fault, not his.� He couldn�t have done anything to me if I
hadn�t set it all up for him in the first place.

&nbsp;

I hated to admit this, even
to myself---but it had felt so good to be really fucked again by a man that I
had turned on; I hadn�t realized how much I had missed it.� He was an attentive lover and I still felt
tingly all over my body; last night had been real, not the shallow, quick,
slam-bam in and outs that I had become so used to.� And my orgasms at the finish had been deep
and real and fulfilling.� I smiled at him
as I put the small hat on.� When I wore
this, I almost felt like I was going a masquerade party, the kind of party
where no one knows anyone else.� I loved
those parties and the feeling of absolute abandon they allowed me; I was known
for this.

&nbsp;

Very carefully, I blotted my
lipstick, took out a small patent-leather clutch bag, and walked towards him,
my shoulders back, my head held high.� I
was ready.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Chapter 11: An
object in possession seldom retains the same charm that it had in pursuit; Pliny the Younger.

&nbsp;

She seemed ready to leave, but for some reason she stopped and
reached into her suitcase again.� After a
second, she pulled out a small black pillbox type of hat with what appeared to
be a short sheer black veil in front.� I
hadn�t seen anything like this in years, but it would work.� I guess that she too had been worried about
being recognized.� 

&nbsp;

She walked over to the mirror and began to put it on.� When finished, she turned to me and laughed
gaily, �I look like the Black Dahlia.��
Then she reached up and pulled the veil down over her remarkable eyes.� It worked; once her eyes had been concealed,
she could have been any one of a thousand attractive women.� She knew as well as I that her eyes were what
anyone would first notice.� And she did
something about it; by wearing this hat and using the veil when with people, it
was the veil that would draw the eyes of onlookers, not the woman behind
it.� Intelligent as well as beautiful; we
would go unnoticed.� She walked towards
me in that incredibly slinky way she had, and we were ready.� I smiled as I escorted her to my car.

&nbsp;

There was a tiny country school about fifteen miles from my house
and we drove by it on our way to the buffet.�
But suddenly Rebecca would have none of that.� With an odd, teasing smile, she insisted that
we go back.� Sunday service was about to
begin in the small gymnasium and as we parked in the lot, I could see a few
late couples and families hurrying in.�
As I watched, I happened to notice a small building in back, about a
hundred feet from the school.� It was
probably the place where they kept lawn mowers and that sort of thing.� 

&nbsp;

We sat there for a couple of minutes and then I looked at
her.� Rebecca�s veil was up, she looked
back at me and quirked her eyebrow.� With
this as impetus, I got out and went over to her door, opened it and helped her
out.� She grabbed my hand and led me
towards the shed in back.� I couldn�t
help it; even though I knew that I was the one that should be setting the
agenda, I felt like I was under her spell.�
And the more dangerous the act, the more satisfying it seemed to be to
her.� Still holding my hand, she led me
around the back of the small building where we would be out of sight.� She had difficulty walking on the grass since
her stilettos kept sinking into the turf.�
But once we there, I didn�t know what to do.� I wanted see if anyone had seen us so I
started to lean past her to peek around the corner of the building, but she
shifted and I almost ran up against her.�


&nbsp;

I didn�t know what to say.�
I stood where I was, mere inches from her face, listening to her
breathe, smelling her and the touch of perfume that she wore.� Her veil was up and I was conscious of her
blue eyes, her soft white skin.� I moved
towards her and our bodies touched.� It
was like a sudden electrical contact.� We
both stood that way a moment, then I leaned forward and our lips met for just a
moment before she turned her face away. �I could feel her unconfined breasts pressing
against me and I lost all control.� 

&nbsp;

I pushed her up against the side of the building and slid my hands
up her arms until I had her wrists pinned above her head against the
building.� I leaned in against her body
and ground my hips against her groin, but she didn�t seem upset at all.� In fact, she spread her legs and pushed back
with her hips and I knew that she could feel my erection as it pushed against
her belly.� I could barely stand the rush
of arousal that engulfed me and I fought for breath as my lips slid to her
chin, kissing her, and then down her neck and over her shoulder.

&nbsp;

She struggled for a second and I released her wrists.� As soon as I had done this, she shifted,
sighing.� I could feel her hot breath
move across my cheek as she took my earlobe between her teeth and bit down,
first gently, then more sharply.� She
pulled me towards her as she kept her hips locked against mine.� 

&nbsp;

I reached up and fumbled with the front of her dress and as I saw
her breasts finally swing free, I felt myself grow even harder.� Her hands dropped from my shoulders, tracing
a line down my chest, my stomach, then to the waistband of my pants.� She unbuckled my pants and loosened my
zipper, then slowly eased me free.� Now her
hand began to stroke me, slowly---within seconds I was in jeopardy of cumming
in her hand.� Being the expert in this
that she was, she quickly recognized my peril and pulled out another condom
from her small purse.� This time she gave
it to me and in frustration, I quickly put it on---it was like pushing a
raincoat down a telephone pole.� Now she
gently pushed me away, but I immediately pressed her back up against the shed
again.� 

&nbsp;

I gasped involuntarily as I reached for the hem of her dress, then
slid my hand underneath it and stroked from the top of her stocking to her
moist, naked vagina.� The front of her
dress now lay bunched between our bellies and our hips.� Her thighs had automatically parted for me
and I slid into her with the lubricated ease of one that had done this a
thousand times before.� Rebecca staggered
a little as I entered her, then compensated by thrusting her hips forward while
arching her back, bringing me deep inside her.�


&nbsp;

For a moment, we remained like that, eyes locked.� Then her lips parted and her head sank
backwards, exposing her neck; she let out a groan of pure desire.� She was excited by what she had made me do
and her labia were moist and hot and swollen as they engulfed me, inflamed and
engorged by the blood pulsing through them.�
I could tell that she wanted this perhaps more than I, if that was
possible; there was no way that her craving could be faked.� It felt wonderful.� The sensations were nuggets of pure joy as
the ecstasy clicked into focus.� This was
perfection.� This was nirvana.� 

&nbsp;

I wrapped my arms around her beautiful ass and stood between her
thighs and lifted as I drove up into her with all of the force that I could
muster.� I slid into her again and again,
at first gently and deliberately, and then more forcefully and finally with
wild abandon.� I pushed and she would be
forced to rise up on her toes to accept it all, then I would pull out and we
would start all over again.� I noted as
if from far away that as I pulled out one time, she accidentally hooked me in
the ankle with her high heel in the process of wrapping her left foot around my
leg.� But as I pushed into her again, she
was forced back onto her toes in order to accept all of me as I finished
slamming into her.

&nbsp;

�.And then, in a sudden flood of pleasure, it was over.� I bit her neck and she began to softly cry
out in ecstasy.� Within seconds I had my
hand over her mouth as I muffled her ever louder screams of sexual release.� She was a creature of pure instinct at that
moment, perfectly in tune with her nature in every way; and even if under false
pretenses, she was mine for now.

&nbsp;

Finally, I began to cum.� As
an ejaculation, it was insignificant, but subjectively it was the fiery
re-birth of the cosmos; my consciousness fled in all directions at once.� As I blistering hot semen was pushed into the
bulbous tip of the condom, I somehow felt split, as of two minds.� This woman seemed like both a magnet to me
and a centrifuge.� Her body and the ease
with which she handled her sexuality attracted me like a moth to flame; while
her sheer carnality, the pure morbid sexual desire with no limits that she
showed me this morning both alarmed me as well as excited me.� If only I could harness this woman�s
sexuality and keep it mine forever.

&nbsp;

It seemed hours before my body required my consciousness.� Bliss gave way to pleasure, then to simple
euphoria and then to a dreamy, slow awareness of my surroundings.� It was going to be a fine day.

&nbsp;

I had released her and she held me close now, her hands an ecstasy
of fumbling; breathing hard in my ear, her beautiful hair wild, her legs
wrapped around me, muscles contracting and relaxing in slowing spasms.� I leaned against Rebecca�s chest as I caught
my breath, then I slowly pulled out of her body.� We both stopped as we caught our breath for a
second.� But then she didn�t even look at
me as she began to repair herself: fixing her breasts back inside the dress
before pulling tissues out of her small purse; now holding her dress away from her
loins, she first cleaned her vagina and then she wiped the insides of her
thighs where clear drops of her secretions had run.� When finished, she threw these tissues to the
ground at my feet.� Then she tugged the dress
down on her hips and re-arranged her bosom again.� When she was done, she looked at me with a
quizzical smile as if wondering what was delaying me.� 

&nbsp;

I leaned against the wall for a minute to recover my blonde-addled
wits.� Perhaps I was reading too much
into it, but the symbology of her act, the expressionless face, the cool composure
so quickly regained after the heat of our encounter, the lack of emotion as she
wiped her vagina and then discarded the used tissues at my feet as if that was
all that I deserved, all of this awakened me abruptly and shook me to my core.� 

&nbsp;

She began to walk back to the car and I could see that she had
laddered her stockings against the building.�
Suddenly, I realized that I still stood there with my limp
condom-covered penis hanging out of my pants.�
I rolled the skuzzy thing off and wrapped it in my handkerchief along
the tissues that Rebecca had discarded at my feet.� I kept this with me and after zipping up my
pants and buckling my belt, I walked back to the car where she was already
waiting for me.� I avoided Rebecca�s eyes
as I got in.� Or maybe she avoided mine.

&nbsp;

I was arrogant, never once thinking about the possibility of my
being in error; never considering the chance that I might have poorly
interpreted the visual cues she gave.�
And from that comes the rest of the story---for as they say, it was all
downhill from there.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Chapter 12: All history attests that man has subjected woman to his will, used her
as a means to promote his selfish gratification, to minister to his sensual
pleasures, to be instrumental in promoting his comfort; but never has he
desired to elevate her to that rank she was created to fill.� He has done all he could to debase and
enslave her mind; and now he looks triumphantly on the ruin he has wrought, and
he will say, the being he has thus deeply injured is his inferior; Sarah
M. Grimke.

&nbsp;

Suddenly, I was angry.� I
was furious at myself for acting so foolishly over a woman like this, and even
more angry at her for being�..I guess for being the way she was.� I realized that I had stood in the shadow of
this woman all weekend; and I also knew that I was tired of doing so.� And for some reason, this last act had made
me feel like I must be done with the charade.�
Within ten minutes of first meeting her, I knew that she had withheld
much from me and now I wanted it, whatever that might be.� And I wanted it to be something about which
she cared deeply and would fight me for; it had to be something important, I
didn�t want her to give up easily.� More than
that, I wanted to humiliate and hurt her as I took it from her.� No, that didn�t nearly begin to describe how
I felt---I wanted to ruin her, to debase and disgrace her.� I wanted nothing to be easy with this
woman.� But right now, I just needed time
to think.� 

&nbsp;

I told Rebecca that I had suddenly developed a headache.� She nodded her understanding and we drove
back to my place.� I brought her back
into my bedroom and she laughed lightly as she entered it.� It seemed that I was all too predictable to
her.� She turned forcefully upon entry,
making her dress swing wide as she turned to faced me.� Rebecca knew exactly what she had done as she
looked into my eyes.� 

&nbsp;

�I think,� she said, �I will take a short nap.�� 

&nbsp;

With that, she began to push me from my own bedroom.� I was astounded and didn�t know what to say
or how to act.� Like an idiot, I
stuttered something inane and allowed this woman her own way, AGAIN!� What was it about her?� Why did I feel so stupid and act so weak when
I was with her?� Furious and embarrassed,
I walked into my study where I turned the television on with a vicious slap at
the remote.� I muted the TV as I walked
over to fix myself a drink.� It was now noon and the television was tuned to a local
channel.� 

&nbsp;

As I finished making myself a scotch, I looked at the TV set and
saw Rebecca�s face there.� Quickly, I
turned on the sound and saw the local news anchor interviewing an old-looking Savannah police lieutenant.� I listened for a second, then quickly walked
over and slid a video cassette in my old VCR.�
And after flipping through channels to find a news program where the
full report had not yet been broadcast, I began taping the show.� Finally, it was on; the police had gone to
her house Friday evening to bring her in for questioning.� But she was gone.� Her husband told them that she was at a
weekend teaching seminar, but the school denied having anything planned.� By Sunday morning, they found her car near
the bus station and discovered that she had made multiple ATM withdrawals on
Thursday and Friday to clean out her bank account.� When they discovered that she�d fled, they
issued a warrant for her arrest.� She
wasn�t considered dangerous, he concluded and they were confident that they�d
find her shortly.� 

&nbsp;

I looked blankly at the TV as it went to commercial.� Chills ran up and down my spine.� I couldn�t believe how close I had come to
getting involved in her mess.� And for
all I knew, I still might be.� I must
have looked at the television and shook my head in disbelief for at least a
minute.� But suddenly, I realized that
this gave me incredible leverage with the woman now asleep in my bed.� 

&nbsp;

Rebecca lay awake upon my bed in her black dress, shapely legs
crossed at the ankles and her arms down by her sides as I walked into my
bedroom an hour later.� She gave me a
small smile and patted the mattress beside her.�
�Are you feeling better?� she asked.�
�We only have the afternoon left together, so what do you want to
do?�� Her whole posture suddenly became
coquettish, which is rather difficult when you are lying down.� 

&nbsp;

I looked at her and a let small smile show.� �What do you think I�d like to do to
you?�� It must have appeared to her that
my small headache was much better now.�
Men are sooo predictable, don�t
you know?

&nbsp;

�I have no doubt at all about what you want from me,� she laughed
gaily.� She moved to the side of the bed,
swung her legs over and stood.� Turning
her back to me, she began to unzip her dress.�
�You are a sexy man and I have enjoyed this occasion with you.� But we have time for one more and then I must
go home.�

&nbsp;

I nodded my understanding and walked into my closet.� There I picked out the piece that I had
wanted her to wear all weekend.� It was a
black and cr�me silk corset with three garters on each side to support her
hose.� Cupless, it pushed up and
supported her breasts, exposing them for all to see.� It was heavily boned for additional support
around the waist and I had desperately wanted to see this on Rebecca.

&nbsp;

Silently, I handed the piece to her.� She looked at it for a second and then looked
at me with an arched eyebrow.� �I was
wondering,� she said, �when it would get to this.� I am surprised that it took you this
long.� After all, I gave you entr�e to
this yesterday.� You really are shy,
aren�t you?�

&nbsp;

Without another word, Rebecca finished stripping and walked over
to the sink to give herself a whore�s bath---how appropriate I thought to
myself.� From there, she went to the
mirror where she freshened her makeup.�
She was one of the few women that I have ever known that could have
acted totally natural as she did this in front of a man that she had known for
less than 48 hours; a woman that had no doubts about her Alpha sexuality, with
pride in her body and no fear of being naked in front of others.� Finished with her face, after getting out a
fresh pair of sheer black nylons, she then loosened the drawstrings in back and
stepped into the corset.� Without a word
she presented her back to me and I pulled on laces until the corset was
comfortably tight around her (if that could ever be the case).� She now sat down and put on the stockings, after
which she finished by putting on the same black heels she�d worn earlier.� 

&nbsp;

Rebecca now stood up and walked over to me.� She stopped in front of me and put her palms
on my chest and looked into my eyes.�
After a moment she asked, �Like what you see?�

&nbsp;

All I could do was groan.� I
pulled her hands off of my chest and led her to the bed.� I�d fucked her until I was black and
blue.� I was physically exhausted from
all of the sex that we�d had; my penis ached and throbbed from all of the abuse
it had suffered.� But it was flesh over
mind and I had a huge erection again.� I
put on the condom myself.� This time our
sex was hard and brutal, and it lasted a long time before I could finally get
off.� We were both covered in my sweat
and she was rather annoyed at the end since she didn�t get off this time
herself.� I rolled off of her now sweaty
belly and lay beside her, panting as I looked at the ceiling.� 

&nbsp;

Once I caught my breath, I got up without a word and handed her
some tissue with which to clean herself.�
I then went into the kitchen.� I
poured us both a glass of red wine and after I had made one minor addition, I
brought the glasses and bottle back into the bedroom with me.� I gave Rebecca her glass and clicked hers
with mine, toasting us as a way of making silent amends for my previously
brutish behavior.� She smiled and we both
took deep drinks, and then lay back upon the bed.� 

&nbsp;

I began to ask her a few questions about her case, and as we
talked I watched her eyes.� Soon she
tried to say something, but her words were slurred.� Within a couple of more minutes, she began
nodding and soon after that, she was out.�
Roofies will do that to you.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Chapter 13: Power is the great aphrodisiac.�
Power can be taken, but not given.
The process of the taking is empowerment in itself; Gloria Steinum.

&nbsp;

The next morning broke clear and beautiful.� Her purse lay emptied on my kitchen
table.� It contained the usual garbage;
nothing of importance but her billfold, car keys on a ring, a small digital
camera, a tiny shampoo from a Holiday Inn and some tampons.� 

&nbsp;

I held a cup of coffee and stood out on my back porch wearing only
a robe.� The waters of the lake at the
rear of my property were so azure and still that it seemed that God�s own
paintbrush had been dipped into royal blue to paint it.� I knew that my face was clear as I looked out
over the water.� 

&nbsp;

Rebecca had kept many things from me.� While this I guess would be considered
natural, for some reason I knew of the importance of these things to her like I
knew my own face in the mirror.� With a
small smile, I wondered if that was perhaps not the best analogy to use.� I didn�t yet have the details, only being
able read her like a novel you had glanced at once quickly.� But these would come in time.� Like all of us, this woman communicated in
multiple ways; telling me about herself in essentially non-verbal terms of
which even she was not aware.� And when
she did speak, she couldn�t help but unconsciously communicate the existence of
deeply buried desires and phobias.� 

&nbsp;

But to understand the book that was Rebecca, I simply needed time
to make her talk.� And even if she chose
to not respond, her body would speak its own language to me.� If given enough time, I would be able to
translate her deepest needs and fears into conscious forms, something that I
understand and use.� When I finally
understood what she said in metaphoric form, I could work with her images to
bring about changes I desired.

&nbsp;

I thought about what Rebecca had said over the weekend, and about
what she had not said.� This last was the
key I knew, the key to breaking Rebecca.�
Too, I thought about my earlier anger and the irrational urge I�d felt
to shame and humiliate this woman---I smiled grimly to myself and tried to be
brutally honest, this morning I felt that need more strongly than ever.

&nbsp;

I felt a thrill of anticipation as I sensed myself falling back
into my old predatory persona.� This
really wasn�t about sex now.� I said this
to myself again and again, but did I lie?�
I think that I actually believed, at least temporarily, that I wouldn�t
be having much sex with her in the near future.

&nbsp;

But I really wasn�t thinking about a
woman becoming physically and emotionally capable of enjoying the lifestyle for
which I yearned; a woman totally addicted to the very same elements of pleasure
and pain that I found so attractive.� I
didn�t picture a woman who went weak in the knees, leaked pussy juice down her
thighs, and moaned in my ear as I tweaked and twisted her nipples�a true slave
and a prospective pain slut, should I wish to push her to that end.

&nbsp;

Rather, what I felt was the thrill of an upcoming hunt.� Something I had truly missed; the delight of
forcing open every secret place my weaker prey might possess, and then
destroying them in the light of day.� The
plans I now made concerned a woman in trouble and the power that gave me over
her.� This was about an impulsive
curiosity and my desire to learn what she kept from me.� I wanted her secrets---all of them; the
secrets of her mind and the secrets of her body.� This was about the incredible joy of being
able to play at being God-like one last time.�
But this time with a woman I knew deserved the horror I would bring
her---and my challenge was about being able to make Rebecca bare her soul when
that was the last thing she wished to do.�


&nbsp;

But mostly, this was about a woman that had dominated me for two
days with the sheer force of her personality and then had behaved badly towards
me at the end; embarrassing me and acting as if she were better than me.� This would be a wonderful opportunity to
punish and debase her---to give her what she, and I, so richly deserved.� I wanted to humiliate her and humble her;
destroying her belief in herself as independent and free.� Perhaps when I was less annoyed with her
later, I would look at this differently.�
But right now, taking advantage of her weaknesses to shame and break her
was all I cared about.

&nbsp;

I was impatient for the �good stuff� and hoped that I wouldn�t
have to spend a lot of time breaking her.�
Rebecca was mentally tough and given what I had learned about her so
far, she might be surprisingly resilient---but that really didn�t matter,
because I was prepared to take as long as necessary to penetrate this woman�s
defenses and then crush her.� I was going
to force her to acknowledge the changed rules in her life.� In the process I would show that she now
existed in my world---and that at least for one in her position, my world was a
society with all of the stops off.� She
would swiftly learn that she was at the bottom now and that I got what I
wanted, when I wanted it.� 

&nbsp;

And with the leverage that I had, when I
was finished and was ready to discard her like a broken toy, there would be
nothing that she could do about it.�
Maybe she would accept it and maybe not, but that really didn�t worry me
too much right now.� All I knew was that
in the long run she would be forced to recognize my power over her and that was
all that mattered.� Once I started like
this with a subject, I would never be able to stop until one of us had given up
completely.� But that was her problem
now.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I was one of those morning
people that always awoke immediately alert and was totally aware of my
surroundings.� But when I finally became
aware of being awake, things were somehow different this time.� At first, my head felt almost like it was
insulated with puffy cotton; I was so confused and disoriented, it almost
seemed like I�d lived through some kind of a dream.� With a coppery taste in my mouth and an
aching head, I felt as if this were happening to someone else.� I tried to remember what had happened.� I�d been lying in bed and a heavy feeling had
come over me that had started somewhere in my mind.� I�d fought it, trying to remain alert but it
was no use.� My head had gone loose on my
neck and I lost all sense of time and place.�
I�d felt the pinch of something and then the close embrace of the man
next to me, but I couldn�t fight it.�
Before I could ask him what he wanted and why I was so numb, I was
flooded with a honeyed sense of enveloping darkness.

&nbsp;

This was the first instance
that I could ever remember in which I had no feel for the passage of time; I
couldn�t say whether it was still that afternoon, that evening or even the next
morning.� Worse, I had no idea what had
happened, but I knew without a doubt that something had happened.� 

&nbsp;

A terrible, terrifying
woolliness enveloped my thoughts.� My
mind was cotton and hay�..and rags, rags of memories.� Everything was fuzzy and I had what felt like
the beginning of a great headache; for some reason it was not just my head, for
I ached all over.� It was dark where I
was and I could tell was I was sitting on a chair.� Nauseous, I leaned my head forward as far as
I could to try to calm my stomach.� As I
put my head down towards my knees, I somehow sensed that I was still wearing
stockings.� But for some reason, my feet
were tucked up under the chair and I couldn�t move them.� 

&nbsp;

Suddenly, I remembered the
corset as being the last thing I�d had on.�
I still seemed to be wearing it, but now it was so tight around my waist
and diaphragm that I could barely breathe.�
I couldn�t know for sure, but it felt like it was forcing me into a
seventeen or eighteen inch waist---I was slim, but this was still far too tight
for me.� At the same time, my torso felt
as if it swelled and then relaxed with each beat of my heart.

&nbsp;

I tried desperately to
think and slipped away into a feathery limbo again.� After I sat there for a couple of more
minutes trying to breathe, my head seemed to clear a little and the pain
suddenly stopped swirling around all over my body, suddenly coming into a
horrifyingly clear focus.� While it
seemed to localize somewhere between my hips and pelvis, it was most definitely
centered on my anus.� This was the first
time that I could ever remember experiencing the strange, brassy taste on my
tongue that is the taste of fear.

&nbsp;

Suddenly, my chest and
waist felt even more constricted and it was even more difficult to
breathe.� I opened my eyes and strained
to focus.� Nothing.� I realized at last that something had been
put over my head---that was why it was so black.� I tried to lean forward again, when suddenly
a strange rippling sensation ran up my spine, then spread down my arms and
legs.� I froze, then tried to move
again.� As I stirred a second time the
feeling came again, a strange internal heaviness accompanied by what felt like
a twisting and a forced inflation of my rectum that had gone hideously too
far.� 

&nbsp;

My head snapped up
involuntarily; I finally realized the ache had always been there out on the
fringes of my consciousness.� I was so
busy trying to figure out my surroundings that it hadn�t registered as real
pain.� But now the hurting flashed
strobe-like through my head.� And as my
senses returned, I finally understood what he�d done, why I hurt so terribly;
the core of my body felt abnormally full, no---over-filled, and my rectum
dreadfully stretched and distended, as if something small and inflexible had
somehow been shoved inside me and then inflated and magnified beyond what my
body could endure.� It didn�t just ache;
God, it hurt terribly because the massively alien object had been driven so
deeply inside my lower body.� I tried to
scream and grip my stomach, little darts of pain racing across my abdomen while
my vision exploded inside my eyelids with red mist.� But I couldn�t move my hands.� And even as I tried to move my pelvis to
relieve the pain, I could feel the terrible force mount and twist within my
body with each shift I made, and then it all went black as the internal
abdominal pressure became unbearable. 

&nbsp;

Suddenly I was back, and
this time wakefulness was just as blurred and confused.� Well, perhaps a fraction less so.� For now that I realized what was wrong, I
panicked for a second and tried to stand up.�
The more I was ruled by my fear, the more I tried to struggle.� I strained to expel the attacker until I
could feel the pressure of my blood surging within my veins; until I could
actually hear the blood rushing through my body, my labored grunts to eject the
intruder going unheard in the quiet room.�
The more effort I exerted, the more my muscles wrenched themselves and
pulled at the invader, attempting to grab onto and force out what was causing
so much pain.� But I wasn�t strong enough
to either banish the enemy from my body or escape by standing and suddenly I
was forced to stop, arched and frozen in mid-motion as a tearing, burning pain
ripped through me from diaphragm to anus.�


&nbsp;

I knew that I couldn�t
continue like this; my lips contorted into a grotesque grin of pain and tears
streaming from my eyes, I tried to force myself to remain calm as I slowly
relaxed my thighs and gave up the precious little freedom from the trespasser
that I had gained in my struggles.� Thigh
and back muscles strained and fatigued, the awful feeling of extreme fullness
within my abdomen and over-extended anus slowly increased again as I hunched
bit by bit deeper back into the chair.� 

&nbsp;

Besides the pain, the worst
part was that to me everything had occurred almost instantaneously.� I had no time to build up my determination to
resist, no moment in time to build my psychological defenses; I was alert and
awake, and then unconscious.� And when I
next awoke, the chair had been presented as an accomplished fact---I had
already been crucified and left to suffer.�
There were no degrees of penetration here; it was black or white, on or
off, virgin territory and then not. 

&nbsp;

Closing my eyes and taking
long deep breaths seemed to help a little, but the transfixing pain never went
away, no matter how much I tried to ease the strain that tore at my anal
ring.� Face smarting under the cover, I
gathered the last shreds of my courage.�
A whimper arose in my throat.� The
vanishing of a small hope that I had not even known was there until it was
gone, the hope that I could somehow rescue myself from this thing, left me with
truly nothing.� 

&nbsp;

Finally fully seated again,
unbidden, another sensation washed through me like the summit of an ocean
swell, taking me to yet another subtle plateau of awareness of being in which I
could almost see myself from outside my body.�
Along with a heightened perception of the senses, I began to experience
a luminous sense of feminine anguish, as if everything that made me a woman
were somehow lit from within.� But
strange as it was, I felt no apprehension or anxiety.� Only wonder.

&nbsp;

Then, like the pop of a
bubble, that feeling was gone and I was wholly and completely back inside my
body, suffering greatly again.� But the
internal light was still too strong for my eyes and I felt my whole body
trembling.� 

&nbsp;

I tried to think.� The soft focus sharpened as the violating
pain, the chair, and the darkness within the bag blurred and almost
disappeared.� The universe of the moment
had shrunk to me sitting on this awful stool.�
Like a spark in my mind popped an image of the man.� I remembered being with George and then
nothing.� George!� He�d done this to me!� He�d tried to amuse himself with me once like
this and I�d snapped at him.� Whatever
he�d done to me now had to be from pure spite; I tried to say something to get
his attention and it was then that it cut through to my fogged brain.� My wrists were bound behind my back,
handcuffed, and there was something tight around my neck; it was attached to
the back of the stool I upon which I was sitting and it wouldn�t allow me to
move forward off of the seat.� And worst
of all, my feet were immobilized.� 

&nbsp;

Immediately, my fury beat
its way through my sheer physical discomfort.�
He hadn�t gagged me so I wasn�t completely helpless.� Throwing my head back, I howled in manic
rage.� I began what I thought would be a
constant screaming and in my anger, I rocked my body back and forth once in an
attempt to free myself.� But I froze in mid-move
as I re-affirmed again that any motion of my body only increased the ripping,
tearing pain that I felt in my rectum.� 

&nbsp;

The rage evaporated
suddenly, replaced by an all-consuming fear.�
I continued struggling, but weakly and more carefully now, trying to get
my hands or my feet free.� The pain quickly
became my master.� It never left and it
was a learning pain; one that quickly taught me how to move my upper body and
which ways to avoid.� For the wrong
movement always brought the terrible ache that threatened to shred my behind or
rupture me internally.� Too, when I
struggled, I found that I couldn�t get enough air to fill my lungs.� The bag over my head and the over-tight
corset accounted for part of that restriction, but being impaled as I was had a
lot to do with it too.� Even trying to be
still, I had to move when I breathed, and it just caused too much pain to
inhale deeply.� I began to hiccup
uncontrollably.

&nbsp;

�George?�� I whispered his name softly between hiccups
as if it meant nothing to me; there was a part of my brain that still refused
to make the connection between the man whose company I had enjoyed earlier and
the pain I felt now.� The answering
silence was both deep and profound.�
�George?�

&nbsp;

I didn�t know how long I
sat there, but it felt like it must have been hours.� It seemed as if I had just run a marathon; I
was covered with sweat and every muscle totally exhausted.� I was hot and thirsty, my lips parched.� Finally, I just whimpered as I sat alone with
my pain and my fear.� I knew then that I
was abandoned by him, that I would probably die here of internal bleeding.� Oh God, why had I been such a fool to trust
him?� 

&nbsp;

I had always been
independent, but for the first time in my life, I knew what it was to feel
totally alone, isolated in my discomfort with only my thoughts to keep me
company.� I tried to be strong, but the
pain was not linear, rather it was cumulative.�
It didn�t reach a plateau and level off, but the longer I sat there, the
worse it got.� It just kept coming and
the accumulation wore me down; soon, I was consumed by it.� I cried in my agony, rocking gently in spite
of the additional pain each move brought.�
This new pain was acceptable because it was somehow different, and
anything new seemed to give my mind an anchor to grasp.

&nbsp;

I read a lot and I had
always felt that I was the strong type that would hold up well under physical
duress.� But I had finally reached a
point now where I would have agreed to anything, would have done anything to be
free of this�.thing.� It was a huge shock
when I realized that I was no tougher or harder than anyone else; that despite
my toughness and intelligence, I too was as vulnerable to being manipulated and
forced into unwanted directions as was the weakest of my students.� Depression now settled on top of my
capitulation; all of it piled in turn upon pre-existing guilt and shame.� I truly was a worthless human being.

&nbsp;

Eventually, I sensed the
presence of someone standing nearby.� And
even though the silence between the two of us seemed to stretch on for an
eternity, in the end he had out-waited me, for I began to beg him to let me
go.� I begged again, but to no
response.� Nothing happened for what felt
like quite a long time and then suddenly, I was drowned in a deluge of
excruciatingly cold water.� It was a
ferocious waterfall at first, but it quickly subsided to a thin, steady
flow.� 

&nbsp;

My body had reacted to the
sudden cold and in reflex I tried to move to the side.� My anal muscles having reached an initial
accommodation with the intruder, the original tearing pain of the impaling
spike had finally subsided just a little.�
But that agony was re-awoken by my sudden move; now I sat immobile under
the shower of water and accepted its chilled caress in an attempt to soothe
again the pain in my rectum.� Finally, I
raised my face to the falling water and sucked on the fluid that permeated
through the material of the bag that covered my head.� 

&nbsp;

Soon, I was no longer
thirsty, but I was getting very cold, my body was now covered with goose
bumps.� But the slow, steady trickle of
cold water never stopped and I soon went from being inconvenienced by it to
dreading it.� I tried to suck in a
breath, but the freezing water filled my ears, my nose, my mouth.� I couldn�t breathe!

&nbsp;

And still the flow never
stopped.� Somehow I was still alive.� I was sure that the air conditioning had been
turned on and the room seemed freezing for now I was shaking all over.� I screamed again, then begged for what must
have been at least half an hour for either my freedom or at least to stop the
water---but there was nothing.� For what
seemed like hours there was nothing but the frigid water, and soon I found
myself gasping for air like a fish, muttering about the cold and how unfair it
was.� I was sure that he was in the room
and that he could hear me, but there was silence except for the rush of blood in
my ears.

&nbsp;

Soon, the water temperature
changed, going slowly from cold to lukewarm.�
Gradually getting hotter, soon I began to worry that he might plan on
scalding me now.� Again, the almost too
hot water continued until it seemed like torture.� I was sweltering; I felt stifled and it was
far too hot now to have the sopping hood over my head, and suddenly, like
before I found it more and more difficult to breathe.� But this was a different kind of torment,
even though like before it too seemed to go on for hours.� And as before, suddenly the temperature of
the water began to change and within minutes, I was shivering under a freezing
downpour again.� Then it stopped again.

&nbsp;

I could feel the cold steel
around my wrists; I could smell the wet hood and feel the dampness of the air
around me, hear the dripping of water somewhere nearby.� The taste of fear in my mouth made my tongue
dry, despite the drenching I had just received.�
I knew this man; I could identify him.�
He could not afford to let me go.�
The thought terrified me.

&nbsp;

Chapter 14: &quot;What has
been lost through the flesh, the flesh should pay back: be generous in your
penance&quot;; Josemaria Escriva, The Forge, p. 207.

&nbsp;

I looked at the now rather small-looking, frightened woman as she
sat on the chair hiccuping with pain and fear.�
I knew her world was so much tinier now than it had been even just a few
hours ago.� I slowly put on my right hand
the glove with the metal capped finger tips and smoothed it between the
fingers.� She jerked in surprise as I
touched her, then gave out a muffled scream as the wooden phallus claimed her
body again after the quick, unwary move.�
I clamped my hand around the back of her neck where it was covered by
the bag and forced Rebecca�s head forward and down.� I felt through the bag and selected the
correct pressure point on her spine just above her shoulder blades.� Then I stiffened my middle finger and drove
down with it.� 

&nbsp;

She jerked violently, twisting and squirming sideways, her wrists
straining at the handcuffs.� I could hear
her breath burst out of her nostrils, followed by a squeezed, grunting
noise.� My metal capped finger continued
to grind savagely against the nerve center it had found.� This was something that I�d learned in
Delta.� It didn�t leave a bruise and if I
got it just right, the recipient was actually paralyzed and couldn�t make
hardly a sound.

&nbsp;

�Thirty,� I finally said aloud.�
I drew my hand back, pulled her upright and shook the sack that
contained her head.� �Only thirty
seconds.� Is it really worth fighting
me?� You and I both know that the fear is
everywhere inside you now, deep in your chest and your stomach.�

&nbsp;

�Are you afraid?� You should
be.�� I smirked as I leaned in close and
whispered into her ear, �You accept pain because you can handle it.....but not
fear.� Suddenly, you've realized that
fear is a small cell with no air in it and no light.� It is suffocating inside, and dark.� There's no room to turn around inside it;
it's like a coffin.� You can only face in
one direction, but that hardly matters since you can't see anyhow.� There is no future in the dark, not for
you.� Everything is over.� Everything is past.� When you are locked up like that, tomorrow is
as far away as the moon.�

&nbsp;

�People can stop and tap on your walls.� They can even bang on the door to show you
where it is, but when you are afraid, you can't open it.� Just like me, they might not be who they say
they are.� They might just make things
worse.� It's safer to stay where you are,
where you know what is what, even if you can't breathe, even if you can't move.� That's how fear feels, isn�t it?�

&nbsp;

I watched her for a minute after I released the pressure, and
other than sob, she did nothing.� I
touched her spine lightly once and she jumped, then shuddered.� She was crying softly now, but remained
silent otherwise.� Okay, enough for now,
I thought to myself.� The anticipation is
half the fun.� She�s had enough for now
and it was time to put her into storage.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

God, he had
hurt me so much and I was so scared.� I�d
never felt so helpless in my life.�
Without warning, I felt a prick in my left cheek and molten metal flowed
into my veins.� Within seconds,
everything dissolved into nothing as I slipped beneath the surface of cold
black water.� Lost in what could only be
narcotics, I was unaware of anything; I didn�t even know the state of my own
body.� I just floated.� Finally, the drug began to wear off and I
awoke in total darkness, but now I was lying flat on my stomach.� I felt nauseous.� I felt a terrible throbbing ache in my
pelvis.� My insides ached with a foreign
feeling, a semi-fullness as if I had something yet hidden inside me.� Some sort of a cord or line ran from my
inside my rear end and felt like it had been taped to my buttocks.� I was uncomfortable, but didn�t feel too bad.
Whatever I lay on was extremely hard.�
Gradually my mind understood that it was not a bed.� A loose layer of what felt like a thick
plastic painter's tarp separated me from the hard, unyielding surface that was
slightly rougher in texture.� My hands
were not bound, but they were tied to my waist in such a way that I didn't have
free motion either.� 

&nbsp;

My first
thought was escape, but instantly my head crashed into an unseen surface above
me.� Wincing from the pain, I lay back
down.� After a moment, I explored around
my body as best I could.� The space I was
in---whatever it was---was very small and confined.� A space that was so tight that it would be
difficult to rollover onto my back, but I couldn't do it at this time because
of the way my wrists were constrained.� 

&nbsp;

Suddenly I
was overcome by panic.� Uncontrolled and
frantic, I couldn't stop myself from struggling and screaming.� My breath burned as I sucked in lungfuls of
air.� My head and my lungs pounded in
time to my machine-gun pulse.� After only
a few seconds of struggle, it seemed to get harder and harder to get enough air
to breathe.� I couldn't hear very well,
something had been forced into my ears.�
I thought, oh my God, somethings seriously wrong with my brain.� I could picture it all too well.� A veinous balloon swelling between two pieces
of thinking meat, waiting for just the right stress to blow like a hand grenade
buried in a dead cow's carcass.� Tearing
away vision, touch, even the sense that there was a world around me.

&nbsp;

The feeling
that I was about to go insane had been with me since I'd first come to.� There were sounds, but they came from
inside.� An internal rushing that wanted
to force its way out.� But what bothered
me most was that I couldn't move.� That
was what was driving me insane.� Despite
the fact that I was lying face down, I had the constant feeling that I was
falling.� A dizzy plummeting without
end.� Maybe it was a hallucination, a
manifestation of the fact that I was falling apart from within.� Madness was about to shatter my mind into
pieces.

&nbsp;

For a few
more minutes, I continued hyper-ventilating and my pulse raced even
faster.� By increments, I finally began
to calm down, my gasping breath slowing, pulse easing.� Reaching up behind my back with difficulty, I
probed the ceiling?
I found that it too seemed to be of the
same rough texture as the floor.� I
quickly realized that the space I was in appeared to be about a foot high, less
than three feet wide and constructed out of wood---it was a wooden box---or a
crude coffin.� Feeling slightly less
nauseous, but no less scared, I stopped for a second and tried to organize my
thoughts.� Enough time passed in the
unchanging darkness that I could think again, begin puzzling things out and
piecing them together.

&nbsp;

I knew my
clothes were gone and like my wrists, my ankles were restrained in a way that
allowed me limited movement.� It felt
like there was a Band-Aid or something on my right ankle.� As I moved, I found that there was a bottle
that had been taped to the floor next to my head.� I soon discovered it had a long nipple on it
and contained water. 

&nbsp;

Again, I had
no idea of whether it was day or night, or for how long I had been in the box,
let alone on the chair.� The CHAIR!� Thank God I was off of the chair.� The chair had hurt so much!� Suddenly, I couldn�t help myself and I
started crying.� It just started and I
couldn�t stop.� To take my mind off of my
predicament, I took a sip of water, then settled back to think.� I tried to cling to reality.� I forced myself to think.� Reason and the ability to remain calm might
give me some possible hope.

&nbsp;

I fell into
a morose and uncomfortable semi-consciousness.�
Suddenly, there was a terrible cramping pain that shot up my right
leg.� I screamed my way out of
almost-sleep and tried to grab my twitching leg, but couldn't.� My head snapped up and banged against the
wooden top; I saw sparkles for a second, but could�ve cared less.� I was in agony; my leg was cramping and
jerking so violently that I was afraid that I would break bones or pull
muscles.� Just as suddenly, the pain
stopped and the cramps went away.� I
wasn't alone, I knew this now.� There was
a thick sense of his presence around me, as if I could reach out and touch him.� I felt suffocated by this spirit feeling, as
if any second his hand might reach out might wrap around my throat, strangling
me.� Then that massive, terrible pain
came back again and destroyed my leg.�
This happened several times.�
Sobbing, I lay on my stomach and tried to figure out what had just
happened and what the crazy bastard wanted and why he was doing this to
me.� 

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

It was a great little tool for guys like me.� It looked like a semi-automatic and made a
sound no louder than an air pistol when I fired it.� But it could bring down a horse as easy as it
could a mouse.� After a long six-count, I
stopped shocking with her with the Taser whose probes had been lightly taped to
her leg; she became quiet again.� The
electrodes didn�t have to break the skin to be affective, just next to it.� Every time I squeezed the trigger, I knew
that terrible muscle spasms ran up and down her leg and she would thrash around
and involuntarily arch her back in her agony.�
I could tell this by the thumping sound that the back of her head made
as it hit the top of the wooden box each time I fed her more juice.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

At first I
just panted in fear, waiting for the next attack.� Finally, I think he left and my mind was a
blank slate writ large with gratitude.�
There were no sounds in the background, nothing that I could focus
on.� My thoughts began to roam into areas
I had always previously avoided, uninhibited by the plywood that surrounded my
body.� First I was scared, and then
angry, next brooding and feeling sorry for myself.� Finally I was afraid, really afraid.� Time passed slowly.� 

&nbsp;

Suddenly, my
attention was aroused by the almost subliminal tinkling sound of running
water.� Almost immediately, I felt a
cold, flushing feeling in my bowels and for a moment, I had no idea what was
happening.� But as the sensation inside
me continued, I began to feel a stirring, a feeling of quickly impending
fullness.� This sensation continued to
build and within seconds I suddenly began to feel cramping pains building until
they were shooting through my belly.�
Like turning a corner, I was suddenly too full---so full there was no
way I could hold it all inside me.� The
psychopath had just given me an enema.� 

&nbsp;

Suddenly, I
was furious.� The bastard.� The fucking bastard.� Just what was it that made him feel that he
had the right to do this to me, to anyone?�
What the hell gave him the right to do these things to me?� But just as quickly as it had come, the anger
was gone.

&nbsp;

I had an
overpowering urge to defecate.� My bowels
felt like they had been filled until they were as hard as granite, yet soft as
jello at the same time.� The internal
pressure was too much---I needed to bring my knees to my chest to hold it all
in, but didn't have the room.� My anus
was locked tight---I desperately ached with the struggle, but it wasn't up for
a fight so soon after the chair.� I held
everything in by urgently clenching my buttcheeks as tight as possible.� I struggled with the desire to let go,
wanting to surrender to the need for relief, but I knew exactly what I would
happen if I gave in to the urge.� After a
minute of taking deep breaths, I knew I had finally beaten that irresistible
compulsion to relax my sphincter.� I took
a deep breath and concentrated on muscle control.� Cramps shot through my belly again, but I
concentrated on maintaining control.� I
could do this.� I could beat him at this.

&nbsp;

My head
snapped up and hit the top of the box.� I
was in agony again; cramps grabbed my leg like an iron fist and wouldn't let
go.� My leg spasmed as if it had a life
of its own and it seemed like fire was running through the nerves on the back
of my leg.� 

&nbsp;

It was
enough.� It was enough to distract me,
take my mind away from what had been my primary task.� He'd timed it perfectly.� I screamed in futile anger at first, then all
I could do was sob and feel sorry for myself.�
He'd waited until I had struggled through the initial shock and was sure
I'd won, that I'd beaten him.� Any relief
I felt in my bowels was perfectly matched by my feelings of total
resignation.� I lay face down in a
rapidly expanding puddle of nasty water that at first so closely matched my
body's temperature I could barely feel it.�
Quickly, the water began to lose heat and I could soon feel the scummy
mess I was laying in.� It stunk of bowels
and aching defeat.� It stunk of
hopelessness and total failure.� It was
my life.� And he let me lie in it.

&nbsp;

By the end,
it seemed that I had been in the box for hours.�
Of course, I tried to speak to him.�
Somewhere there had to be ears and a mouth.� Every time I sensed he might be near, I tried
a different approach.� I pleaded, I
raged, I tried to be my own defense counsel and speak calmly and soberly.� Everyone has rights, I claimed, sometimes
sobbing, sometimes enraged.� Even a bound
woman has rights.� The right to know why
I've lost all my rights.� I didn't even
ask to be set free.� To start with, I
just wanted to know why I was being held captive, why was he torturing me.� That was all.�
Was that too much to ask?

&nbsp;

And when I
wasn't screaming at him or trying to negotiate, there was total silence.� He wouldn't respond and bored, I finally begin
to look within myself---and much of what I saw after a while, I didn�t
like.� But still, I didn't deserve
this.� No one did.� But if anyone did deserve this, a small voice
inside me said, it would probably be you.�
I began to see some of the truths of my life, things I�d done my best to
ignore in the past; I had made so many mistakes that it felt like it took hours
to review all of them---it wasn�t fun.�
But I would never in a million years have admitted this to him, it would
have been too much like letting him win as I lost.

&nbsp;

For some
reason, my emotions were up front and on full display.� I've always been a controlled, rational
person and I hated being controlled by my feelings.� This was so unlike me, but there was nothing
I could do.� 

&nbsp;

Eventually,
my bladder finally began to press, telling me that time had passed and that I
needed relief.� Please....not that
too.� What would happen if no one came?� Would I be forced to lie in my urine
too?� But the blackness went on and
seemed never to change.� Suddenly, there
were sounds outside followed closely by a blinding light as the lid on the box
was lifted.� 

&nbsp;

I heard him
say, �Time for a change,� as he opened the lid.�
Nothing he said made sense anymore, it must have been a true psychotic
break.� My eyes began to water and before
they could adjust to the light, there was another prick on my right hip and I
quickly drifted off to into a different kind of blackness.� Molten metal.�
Black water.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

�Welcome
back,� he said finally.� �I was wondering
when you would rejoin the land of the living.��
I lifted my head a little and looked around woozily; it was more
difficult than it should have been.�
George stood next to me; I was lying on my back in a bed in the same
White Room---a sterile, blinding white at the moment.� I had a killer headache; I put my head back
down on the pillow as I fought back an overwhelming urge to cry.� When I finally had my emotions under control,
I began a rough inventory.

&nbsp;

�I
felt,�� he said, �that you needed a
break.� Just relax.�

&nbsp;

My wrists rested on my belly and were handcuffed together, and I
smelled faintly of stale sex and sweat.�
My skin didn't feel sticky and there was no smell of bowels or urine; he
must have cleaned me up a little.� There
was a plate of finger food on a small table next to my bed, and next to the bed
a mug of what smelled like hot coffee.�
My stomach grumbled loudly, reminding me of long it had been since I had
eaten�.just how long HAD it been since I�d last eaten?

&nbsp;

I tried to
sit up and swing my unbound legs over the side of the bed, but fell back
because of sudden dizziness.� After
taking a couple of deep breaths, I succeeded on my second attempt.� 

&nbsp;

George
sounded solicitous as he asked, �Do you need to go to the bathroom?�� I nodded without looking at his face;
silently he helped me up and led me to a toilet in the corner.� The muscles controlling defecation had been
loosened by his abuse, but I had been cleaned by his enema.� I still had to pee badly and it gave me a
rebellious pleasure to think of him cleaning up after me.� But I squatted without shame on the toilet
seat now and felt immense relief as I emptied my bladder.� Wiping myself wasn�t too much of a problem
because of the way my hands were bound, but when finished I stood and let him
wash me off and then towel my body dry.�
He seemed to take inordinate pleasure ensuring that I was both clean and
dry between my thighs---I did my best to ignore him.� When he was finally done, he led me back to
the bed.� 

&nbsp;

I sat on the
edge of the bed and looked at George but didn�t say a word, instead grabbing
the mug and taking a deep drink of coffee as I surveyed the room.� It tasted wonderful, but I felt a chill of
fear go down my spine.� I had no idea of
where I was or of how the various things I saw in the room were to be
used.� I took a second sip to give me
time to think of something to say.� He'd
tortured me.� I had no idea why he'd kept
me instead of letting me go.� This scared
me, but from the few hours I�d spent with him during the weekend, even though
he was a manipulative bastard, he'd seemed a nice enough guy at the time and
good in the sack at the end.� A little on
the devious side perhaps, but I hadn�t detected the vibrations of a serial
killer or anything like that.

&nbsp;

Finally, I
looked up at George.� Trying to keep my
voice calm, I said, �What do you want from me?��
As I looked at him, I ran my manacled hands over my thighs.� Remembering the last time I�d shaved my legs
and from the stubble there now, I estimated that at least two, perhaps three
days had passed.� 

&nbsp;

He asked in
a solicitous tone, �Are you okay?�

&nbsp;

I glared at
him and almost spewed a mouthful of coffee on the floor.� �You�ve kidnapped me and you're torturing
me.� How do you think I feel?�� The bastard was insane.� He was absolutely insane, but I didn't want
him committed---I wanted him dead.� I
would enjoy that.

&nbsp;

He
hesitated, �You will start showing me some respect.� I don�t think you�re feeling that bad; I do
however think you've been spoiled, and that you�re hell of a lot tougher than
you�re letting on.�� There was silence
for a minute, then he continued.� �I know
more about you than you think I do,� he said.�
�I probably know more about you than you do yourself.� But I�ve still got a lot of questions---and
babe, I�m telling you now, you and I have a long way to travel before you'll
leave here.� Let�s talk about you growing
up.� I�m not sure you�re a naturally
nasty person---what was it like and why are you---what rotten things happened
to make you such a cold, devious bitch?�
Or was it just easier to be a natural cunt?� That�s one question.� And from the look on your face, I think I�m
going to have to get pretty serious with you to get an answer---but that�s
going to be part of the fun.�� 

&nbsp;

George
continued with a smile, �What's really happened at your latest school?� I just don�t buy your story; and because I�m
curious, here�s a follow-up; why did you leave the previous school at which you
worked?� Oh, I know what you tell
everyone, but I want to know the real reason.�

&nbsp;

I refused to
look at him as I lifted the plate of food and began to eat.� Finally, I looked up at him.� Ignoring his earlier questions, I said, �I
asked you what you intended to do.� And
it�s none of your business, but I left because I was offered a better position
at my current school.�

&nbsp;

�No,� he
said.� �You make the same amount as you
did before.� In fact, you were paid less
when you arrived at this school and only in the last six months have you worked
your way back to where you were when you left the other school.�

&nbsp;

I looked at
him in shock.� I hadn�t told him
this---how the hell could he know that?�
This made me angry; I immediately knew I�d rather die than tell him
anything else.� �No.� You�re wrong,� I came back quickly.� �Besides, what the hell do you care, anyway?�

&nbsp;

�Don't confuse
curiosity with empathy.�� He looked at me
in total silence for about thirty seconds, then continued.� �Curiosity's a basic monkey trait.� Torturers are full of it.� It doesn't make for better human beings.�

&nbsp;

I replied in
the coldest tone I could muster, �I guess you'd know.� 

&nbsp;

�Point
taken.�� George had a speculative tone in
his voice in his voice as he continued, �You and your husband don�t have any
money to your name---in fact, I just about cleaned you out when you gave me
that last $1000; you were seeing a psychiatrist and had some success.� But for some reason, you got scared and
stopped seeing him.� Do you think that
was wise?� Both you and your husband did
some heavy drugs for awhile, but you stopped after a short time while he�s
worse than ever.� You�ve been dry-fucking
school boys---and sucking them off for at least the last six months, and he�s
been banging one of your teacher friends the whole time---do you want me to go
on?�

&nbsp;

My
husband?� As much as I took him for
granted and as bad as things had gotten between us recently, I knew I still
desperately needed him and his support too.�
Every structure of substance in my world; every truth that I had thought
authentic and sincere and genuine, all threatened to come crashing down around
me.� Suddenly, I looked at the maniac I
knew as George with new eyes.� Still numb
inside, I felt my naturally aggressive nature give a slight stir, �Just who are
you, anyway?� Your name isn�t George, is
it?� And I�ll bet you�re not even a
lawyer, are you?�� 

&nbsp;

Suddenly, I
began feeling weaker, like a battery running down.� Gathering what little strength remained, I
let my voice get stronger and more shrill, �Let me go, you crazy bastard.� What do you want?�� As I began screaming, he slapped my
face---hard.� Knocked back onto the
mattress by the blow, I refused to cry.�
I lay there for a minute trying to catch my breath.� But instead of regaining my strength, slowly
my head got too heavy for me to hold up and I lay on the pillow taking deep
even breaths.� The strong sedatives he'd
put in my coffee had almost knocked me out again.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I was still
in the White Room when I next came to, but I was immediately aware that I�d
been impaled again.� Like before, the
sensation of my lower body being filled was overpowering.� Like before, it cut through me like a red-hot
spear, the ripping pain so intense I couldn't even scream.� I felt like I was falling; falling into a
ditch made of blackness, but I never reached the bottom.� My body hung suspended from the inside on
whatever he'd driven into me.

&nbsp;

These
thoughts consumed me, but this time I could see since there was no hood over my
head.� As before, my hands were cuffed
behind my back, my ankles were tied up under the chair and something around my
neck kept my head back against the chair.�
But now I was wearing an inexpensive terry cloth robe and it covered
most of my body, except where it split over my knees.� 

&nbsp;

Whatever I
was sitting on gave me terrible cramps that continuously ripped through my
abdomen.� Each stabbing pain threatened
to double me over.� But my lower body and
kidneys ached and throbbed with each involuntary movement that I made and my
anus continually attempted to clamp against and push out whatever filled it.� I couldn't breathe, whatever he had driven
inside me felt like it filled me and pressed on my diaphragm, paralyzing my
lungs.� I closed my eyes and even though
I fought it, a small, soft moan of anguish forced its way passed my lips.� 

&nbsp;

I hadn�t
felt this helpless since my fourteenth birthday.� �Please,� I whimpered softly to myself.� �Please.�
Just let me go, I won�t tell anyone.�
I promise.� Please.�� I waited another eternity, mired in my
thoughts and the pain.� 

&nbsp;

I was facing
away from him when I heard a door open.�
He entered and walked around in front of me, then just stood staring at
me without saying a word.� As much as I
hurt inside, chills still went down my spine as he finally spoke, �Yeah, I know
that you don�t want this.� And I also
know that you won�t tell anyone either.�
You say that you want to cooperate and right now you mean it, but deep
inside you really don�t.�

&nbsp;

He gave a
short, dry laugh.� �You don�t know me
well enough yet, but one thing you'll soon understand is that I can tell when
you�re lying.�� He looked at my face,
then at my hair and neck as if they had asked him a complex question.� He touched my shoulder and bolt of
electricity made my hair leap at him, wrapping itself around his finger.� He looked down at it with a long, slow
smile.� �I�m going all the way inside
you,� he said quietly.� �All the
way.� But don�t be scared, I�m going to
do it very, very slowly.� And then,
pretty quickly you�re going to WANT to tell me every little intimate detail.�

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I squatted in front of her with my hands on her knees.� �Earlier, you asked what I intended.� I intend to prevent you from leaving without
my permission.� I intend to keep you here
for as long as is necessary.� I intend to
train you in the ways of keeping a man happy---and you're going to hate that at
first.� But after weeks and months of
keeping you here, I also intend that you discover your only desire will be to
satisfy me in any way you can.� You can
shake your head no all you want to, but soon, your only desire will be to make
me happy.�

&nbsp;

I looked at Rebecca and for the first time saw real fear in her
eyes.� �As a fighter, my dear, you are
all heart and no style.�� She'd been
treated like a princess by many of the men in her life, and she was used to being
put up on a pedestal.� She'd soon learn
that she was a cunt and deserved no special treatment.

&nbsp;

I shook my head.� �You want
to resist, but you've never been formally trained.� So I'll give you your first lesson for
free.� What they teach you is, you have
to accept that you are in position from which you can't win.� Your life is over and it belongs to me, your
opponent.� There will be some pain first,
yes.� For most, it only lasts a few
hours; but for you, days and weeks.� Your
spirit will be broken and your body used.�
By then, perhaps you�ll hope that death will deliver you.� Concentrate on that deliverance, whatever it
may be.� Let your body go out and meet
it, use the anticipation of that impending rendezvous to hold out for as long
as you can.� If you can do this, if you
can detach yourself from what I'm doing to your body, that will make your mind
that much harder to reach.�

&nbsp;

I looked at her with a slight smile.� �But it's too late for you.� You're going to be squashed like a bug in the
end, and I�m really sorry that it has to be this way.� You like to think that you�re a tough woman,
but you�re not really, at least not deep inside.� No matter how much you fight me, you�ll never
learn to accept what I do to you without being fundamentally changed.� No one in your pathetic life is that
tough.� Any you see, that�s what I really
want from you---a changed woman.�� At
this point, I asked her a couple of questions again and I watched as Rebecca
hung her head and didn�t answer.� 

&nbsp;

She didn't seem nearly as self-possessed now as she had the first
time we'd met.

&nbsp;

�Please,� Rebecca hesitated, then continued after a moment in a
softer voice in which the pleading tone had become dominant.� �I haven�t done anything to deserve
this.� Stop, please�..you haven�t gone too
far yet.� I didn�t really want to leave
you this weekend---just let me go and we can do whatever you want.� I�ll stay as long as you want and I promise
we�ll have a good time.� Just let me go
and I�ll let you do anything that you want to me.�

&nbsp;

I just looked at her without answering.� Her face pleaded with me for at least a
minute.� I didn't respond, but just
continued watching her.� Suddenly, the
pleading was over and the Alpha bitch was back.�
There were about two minutes of furious ranting before I decided I'd had
enough.� I reached underneath the chair
and gave Rebecca two more inches of wood up her ass.� She broke off in mid-curse and shrieked for a
second, before she started crying again.

&nbsp;

After couple seconds of silence, she continued in a much more
reasonable tone.� �God, it's too much,
it�s too deep.� Please.�� 

&nbsp;

She was silent for another minute as I left her sitting on the now
longer spike.� �Okay, okay.� You�re right.�
I�ve been used to getting my own way for so long, and�.and I tried too
hard---I deserve you being angry with me.�
Please, whatever it is you just did, please put it back like it was,
it�s too deep.� I know I deserve
everything you want to do to me.� But we
had a good time, didn�t we?� I know that
we both did, and it doesn�t have to end this way.� 

&nbsp;

I looked at my sweet-meat for a second, then slowly shook my head
no, actions had consequences and she�d soon learn this.� Now I retrieved the Taser I'd laid
aside.� 

&nbsp;

�Still feeling a little disoriented, are we?� From that time in the box, I mean?�

&nbsp;

�Jesus,� Rebecca said.

&nbsp;

�I Tased you,� I said.�
�Or is it Tasered?� In any
event, what that means is that I put fifty thousand volts and one hundred and
thirty-odd milliamperes of electricity through your ass.� You may have noticed that this can be
somewhat incapacitating.�

&nbsp;

Now I gave her a serious look.�
�From this point on when you show the slightest idea about being
difficult, or when you refuse to answer completely and without hesitation any
of my questions, I'll Taser your ass again.�
You won't know when it's coming and it won't necessarily immediately
follow your infraction, but it'll come.�
You understand?�

&nbsp;

Rebecca nodded.

&nbsp;

�You realize that if I Taser you again for longer than even a
couple of seconds, you'll start convulsing, and if you're still sitting on that
pole when you do, you'll tear yourself up on the inside?� You know that?�

&nbsp;

She nodded quietly as a couple of quiet tears rolled down her
cheeks.

&nbsp;

I knelt by Rebecca's chair as I looked at her.� To truly collapse a person�s will, they have
to KNOW that they�d been broken.�
If they are allowed to give up without having experienced the pure,
absolutely dominating power of straight-forward, brutal, unending and
overwhelming physical coercion, sometimes that person may be unable or
unwilling to recognize how completely their reality had been broken, perhaps later
even refusing to believe that they had in fact been broken.� It was better to take them all the way down
in the beginning, leaving their life nothing but totally dominated wreckage,
thus ensuring no confusion later.

&nbsp;

Now had come the time of initial explanation and exploration of
options; I always enjoyed this stage.� I
took my time as I told her what was coming, ensuring that each detail was
explained to Rebecca.� She needed to
understand every feature, every facet; every nuance of what she was going experience.� Anticipation of what was to come gave her
imagination the time it needed in order to work overtime, building up fear and
dread.� Although Rebecca didn�t yet know
it, for her this was just the beginning.�


&nbsp;

I stayed on my knee and slowly stroked her naked thigh.� Rebecca turned her face to me, looking me in
the eyes as she continued with her silent pleading.� When I didn't react, she suddenly spit in my
face.� This was not a smart woman.� 

&nbsp;

Instead of immediately using the Taser, I leaned over without
wiping the spittle off and disappeared from her sight.� Suddenly, she quickly sat stiffly erect and
upright, then froze in her position; she'd obviously felt another deliberate
penetration deep in her bowels as I leisurely gave her another inch of polished
wood, then rotated it slowly.� Rebecca
seemed to freeze as solid as a piece of granite for a second, then bellowed her
new pain, finally ending with agonizing pig-like grunts that had to come from
deep in her belly.� She found herself
locked in a series of short exhales, totally neglecting the biological
imperative to inhale between.� At last,
with what appeared to be total helplessness, she put her chin on her chest and
began to softly cry.

&nbsp;

NOW I gave her a quick shot from the Taser and she jerked for a
second, then fell limp on the chair as I stopped.

&nbsp;

�When you're asked a question, you will respond by saying, at the
minimum, Yes, sir or no, sir.� Yes,
Master or no, Master.� Either'll be
okay.� Understand?�

&nbsp;

I noticed there was more than a little anger in her eyes, but her
fear now was clearly far worse.

&nbsp;

Rebecca nodded her head and said, �Yes, sir.�

&nbsp;

�Rebecca, do you have any questions before we start for real?�

&nbsp;

�I'd like to know what you think you're doing.�� She asked stiffly.� �Where am I?�
Why are you doing this to me?�

&nbsp;

�That's three questions,� I replied.� �You don't listen very well, do you?�

&nbsp;

�No.� Not when it's with an
animal like you.�� She replied a little
impatiently.

&nbsp;

I held up my index finger.

&nbsp;

�No, sir,� Rebecca said quickly.�
Then her eyes suddenly got wet and she started crying again softly.� I would never have predicted a woman like her
would be a crier like this.� 

&nbsp;

It was time to let her think for a little while, so I got up and
left without a word.� She was going to
have to learn to wait on me.� I was
delighted with the fight she showed so far.�
The stronger she thought she was initially, the greater the fall when I
took her apart at the end.� As Rebecca
wept, I knew that she must be thinking about the awful sensation of her abdomen
being filled by some huge artificial carved body, a giant wooden phallus that
was both foreign to her rectum and loathsome in feeling.� Her initial fuzziness upon waking was long
gone.� She was just like the others---she
didn�t dare move or try to bend over, for that brought on a pain that was too
great to even consider.� Instead, she
tried to concentrate on ignoring what I'd done to her.� 

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I knew that
I was not a good person, but I didn�t deserve this.� He treated me with total contempt, taking the
one thing that in my ignorance I had told him that I hated more than anything
else and derisively choosing this for his initial assault.� Who did he think he was?� What gave him the right to do this me?� He was a monster, a maniac; he was the one
that should be going to jail, not me!�
God, it hurt so much!� My bowels
felt compact and hard and filled, stretched until they were over-filled, ready
to tear like cheap tissue paper.� I knew
that my belly and abdomen must be visibly extended from what he'd forced inside
me.� My body still shook from the
electricity he'd shot through me with that little gun he had. 

&nbsp;

Now he'd
left me alone to explore in isolation the pain and the degradation of his
chair.� He gave me plenty of time to
think.� My mind wandered like a ship
without a captain, forced to understand, then ponder my crimes of arrogance and
what he called my 'effete snobbery'.� But
first there was self-righteous anger.� I
came up with a list of things I'd do to him if I ever had the chance, if the
tables were ever turned.� I swore to
myself I'd give him the same chair he forced upon me.� God, I just seethed with barely controlled
rage.� This was so unfair, so
unjust.� No one would have believed at
the beginning of this weekend that this could have happened, let alone happened
to me.� I didn't deserve this.� No one did.�
The anger finally began to leave and I began to delve deeper into what
might be motivating this monster.�
Why?� Why was he doing this?� Why was he doing this to me?

&nbsp;

This wasn't
my guilt I paid for, I said over and over in my mind.� It must be someone else's.� I had hoped that passage of a little time
would create some distance from the chair, but now I saw that wouldn't
happen.� Only death could put an end to
the pain it brought.� And since I didn't
want to die yet, I chose to remember what it had felt like from the beginning.

&nbsp;

It seemed
designed to solely attack my feminine identity; that which I knew had always
made me strong.� But the quiet violence
it brought me seemed never to end.� As with
the box, time dragged and it seemed that I had hours to explore the sensations
of the wood that filled my insides, and then finally, what I had done to
myself.� It seemed I spent an eternity
impaled, sitting erect on that spike, thinking about everything but what I was
experiencing at that moment.� I felt like
I led a secret life.� I knew we all did
in some way; we all laid some sort of camouflage over our secrets; always hiding
from others our sins in the night.� In
the end, I tried to be honest with myself and I ultimately came to understand
that in a way, karma required time and effort to atone for my past, for some of
the things I'd done.� No one knew where I
was, nor was my husband expecting me back at any set time.

&nbsp;

I was in so
much fucking trouble.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

�What are you going to do with me?� she asked.� 

&nbsp;

�I didn't say you could speak.�
The next time you speak without permission....�� I mimed shooting her with the Taser.

&nbsp;

Rebecca recoiled from me as if my finger were the real thing.

&nbsp;

�Are you going to talk?�

&nbsp;

Rebecca remained silent.� It
seemed as if she looked off into the distance as if to ignore me.� The room began to get too warm, so I opened
the door to let in cooler air.� She spent
hours on the chair---I wanted her to marinate in her own exquisite personal
hell.� Sometimes I shocked her on the
legs or arms, other times I flogged her upper thighs.� Each time without asking a question.� She was tough, a really tough woman.� But I could tell that everything I did was
working.� Women are so much more sensitive
to this than men in so many ways.� Women
were the race.� Men were just fighting,
fucking machines.� To be a woman was a
sensory experience beyond the male.� My
experience in breaking both sexes had convinced me of this.�� 

&nbsp;

Touch and texture ran deeper with women, an interface with the
environment that male flesh seemed to seal out instinctively.� To a man, skin was a barrier, a
protection.� To a woman, it was an organ
of contact.� Because of this, there were
certain female vulnerabilities.� And I
used them.� Every one of us has a
breaking point; and once we�ve been taken past that point, we have nothing left
to give.� For her I think, the worst part
was that there was no obvious end of which she was aware�.this mistreatment
could go on forever and no one would ever be the wiser.� A few times I threatened her with more wood,
and once I penetrated her bowels and ass another inch, only to remove it a
second later.� From that point on, the
anticipation of that deeper penetration was far worse for her than the
reality.� 

&nbsp;

Rebecca�s eyes were closed as she took shallow breaths.� Even though it must have felt like I'd run a
telephone pole up her ass, I could tell she was trying to ignore the sensations
from the wood that so deeply penetrated her lower body.� I'd ignored her muffled attempts at pleading
for over half an hour; she must have thought she would die on the stake in that
forlorn room.� Desperation was good,
since it made her more impressionable.

&nbsp;

A fine cold rain spattered outside and gurgled in the gutters and
downspout, which were close outside the door that opened to the patio.� I went over and sat on the floor where I
could feel the cool breeze coming through the doorway.� I waited awhile with my eyes closed and
taking deep breaths, then suddenly it was time to get started again.

&nbsp;

I showed her the glove for the first time, the glove that she�d
already felt once.��� She stiffened in
the chair as she looked at the cruel metal tips on the fingers and shook her
head, but never made a sound.� Now I clamped
my hand around her neck and forced her head down almost to her knees.� She shrieked with the pain in her bowels as I
did this.� My gloved hand brushed her
hair forwards, then I softly touched her skin at the same point just above her
shoulder blades with my middle finger.�
�Right there,� I said.� �Just like
last time.�

&nbsp;

Then I stiffened my finger and touched the spot again, pushing
down lightly.� Rebecca shuddered, then
wrenched her upper body violently, trying to turn away from the finger.� But nothing can save you forever.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

And now, you
bastard.� You miserable, heartless
bastard.� Here you are again, I thought
to myself.� I felt his presence near me
again and I looked up as I opened my eyes.�
He peered down at me as he asked, �Are you ready to cooperate?�� I nodded my head quickly in acceptance of his
implied offer to earn better treatment, even as I ranted inside.� I hated my weaknesses as much as I hated him;
he'd won for now and I hated it.� I
desperately wanted to believe that I would have only cooperated with him
because I had chosen to do so and not because he had forced me, but that would
be a lie.

&nbsp;

We both knew
that anyone in my situation would have said or done anything to be free of his
chair and his electrical wires.� The
ironic part was that I while I would always fight against submitting to him in
the way he desired, I was afraid I would always still wind up giving him what
he wanted, for however long he kept me.�
But I felt little satisfaction in knowing that even if I would have done
it for my own reasons; he�d forever think he'd won.

&nbsp;

Attempting
to be honest, at least with myself, I acknowledged that there was something
else.� A weakness I'd fought against my
whole life.� But the Christian �need for forgiveness� was a seed that my mother had planted so
long ago; I thought I'd rooted it out at one point in my life.� But it had firmly taken root
none-the-less.� And regardless of whether
it made sense to me or not, I still felt guilty; there was bill I owed that
still needed to be paid.� That was the
way of my existence, my karma; the only way that I could round off the corners
of the square.� 

&nbsp;

I know that
people in trouble always promised God that they'd change their ways, but God
help me, I would---anything to get rid of what I'd done.� At the same time, I couldn't help but wonder
in the very deepest recesses of my mind just how much I was rationalizing.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I'd known her type the instant I saw her for the first time in the
restaurant.� Skin the color of the first
milk of spring; the injured spirit that oozed with too much pride; a
satisfaction with her pampered life that she broadcast with every glance of her
eyes and her uplifted chin; the arrogant set of her beautiful, swollen lips
that reflected the remarkably high level of entitlement she felt.� Everything was there; resentment, pride,
weakness, indolence, intolerance for others less fortunate and a desire to be
special, always elevated above everyone else.��
But what we'd already gone through together ensured that none of that seemed
important right now.

&nbsp;

�Please, sir.�
Why---are---you---doing---this---to---me?

&nbsp;

�Come, come, Rebecca.�

&nbsp;

�Please, Master.� Please let
me go.�

&nbsp;

�I�m afraid that�s not possible.�

&nbsp;

Her abdomen was cramping, and she was doubled over as far as she
could go.� I grabbed her by the neck and
pulled her up.� I couldn�t tell yet if I
had been too hard on her or too lenient.�
She gazed back at me, her eyes radiating pain---yet still attempting to
mask a calculating intelligence.� Her
expression was almost identical to the one she had worn at our first
meeting.� 

&nbsp;

I picked up a tape recorder and walked back to Rebecca.� �Put your knees together.�� She grimaced in effort, but when she'd
finally complied, I laid it on her thighs.�
�If that tape recorder hits the floor.......�� I mimed shooting her with the Taser
again.� She quickly pushed her knees even
further together to hold the tape recorder.�
I had cameras taping this from several angles, but she didn't know that
yet.� The tape recorder made everything
real to her and gave her situation an immediacy that it had up to now lacked.

&nbsp;

�Breathe, Rebecca.� Take
long slow breaths.�

&nbsp;

�Don�t......hurt.....me......anymore.� Sir.�

&nbsp;

�I won�t,� I lied.� �But you
have to tell me what I want to know.�

&nbsp;

�I don�t......know......anything.....sir�

&nbsp;

I made my face betray mild disappointment.� I exhaled and spent a long moment sadly
contemplating the stubborn woman.�
�Please, Rebecca.� Don�t make this
difficult.� Tell me the truth, and this
entire episode will be over.�� It was
clear I hated doing this; that I wanted to be her best friend, if only she'd
cooperate.

&nbsp;

She started to cry now.�
�I�m not .....lying.� I don�t
know......what you want.�

&nbsp;

�You�ll talk, Rebecca.�
Everyone talks.� There�s no use in
trying to resist.� Please, don�t do this
to yourself.�

&nbsp;

After a long silence, I said, �You and I are going to take a
journey together.� A night journey.� Do you know this term, Rebecca?� The
Night Journey.�

&nbsp;

Greeted only by the sound of her soft weeping, I answered my own
question.� �It was during the Night
Journey that God revealed the Koran to the Prophet Mohammed.� Tonight you�re going to make your own
confessions.� Tonight you�re going to
tell me everything I want to know.� If
you tell me quickly, you'll have given yourself speedy mercy from the chair and
the Taser.� But if you continue being
stubborn, you�ll find that I'll increase your pain geometrically.� Do you understand this term?�

&nbsp;

Silence.� She refused to
look at me.

&nbsp;

�Are you ready to talk?�

&nbsp;

�Yes.�

&nbsp;

I held up my trigger finger.

&nbsp;

�Yes, Master,� she amended quickly.

&nbsp;

�No more fighting me?�

&nbsp;

She shook her head.

&nbsp;

�Say it, Rebecca.� No more
lies, no more fighting it.� Make me
happy.�

&nbsp;

�I.....will.....tell you......everything......Sir�

&nbsp;

�You�re going to tell me everything?�

&nbsp;

�Every......thing........Sir�

&nbsp;

�Tell me about the first boy.�

&nbsp;

�Which....first boy?�

&nbsp;

Tired of her game, I gave her a small shot of electricity.� Rebecca convulsed on the chair, but managed
to not lose the tape recorder still on her lap.�
Even as she writhed with the electricity going through her, the wooden
stake up her ass kept her upright and erect.�
I let her breathe for a second, before I continued.

&nbsp;

�Your first boy.� Tell me
about him.� Tell me everything.�

&nbsp;

And she did, drop by drop.

&nbsp;

�When did you have your first school boy?�

&nbsp;

�Master......I........can�t remember.�

&nbsp;

�Approximately?�

&nbsp;

�I can�t remember.� It
was........about five years ago.� Sir�

&nbsp;

I calmly looked at her.� I
had a lot of information about this boy, the first student Rebecca had
seduced.� �You�re lying to me,
Rebecca.� If you lie again, this ends and
I'll go about it by other means.� I don�t
want it to be that way, but it will, all because of you.� The next means I use will be much worse than
this.� Do you understand me?�

&nbsp;

She nodded.

&nbsp;

�Answer me, Rebecca.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, sir.� I understand.�

&nbsp;

�Good.� What did this one
look like?� Describe him for me.�

&nbsp;

�Sir, he was........thin and dark.�
About 5� 6� tall.�

&nbsp;

She gave me the details, morsel by morsel.

&nbsp;

�Now give me the boy�s description again.�

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I hated capitulating to this man.� I hated letting him think he'd won.� But then, despair flooded over me.� As I described my life to him, every transgression,
every sin seemed magnified by a thousand as he demanded every detail---details
I hadn't remembered for years.� How could
he know all these things?� I suddenly
knew that mine was the life of an onion.�
Every layer he peeled away made me weep more.� I hated him for this; he would pay.� The thoughts of what I would do to him when
it was my turn never left my mind.� And
his questions never stopped.� 

&nbsp;

*** 

I could've cared less about her petty, pitiful, pathetic life life
before me.� It was the act of forcing her
to tell me the most private and intimate details that was important; forcing
her to reveal the things that shamed her made Rebecca accept the reality of her
new position.� In the end, I stood in
front of her---and she'd told me everything I wanted to know.� The electricity and the chair had broken
her---they had gutted her will to resist as efficiently as a spider drains the
juice from a captured fly.� She'd spent
sufficient time in the White Room now and was no longer able to maintain her
belief in the exaggerated protection offered by society's rules and laws.� 

&nbsp;

The civilized world sometimes forgets how thin is the veneer of
civilization; how things always change over time and not always necessarily for
the better.�� How the venerable,
respected institutions that protected individuals in the past could be hollowed
out from within by predators and opportunists. Outwardly, nothing much had
changed. But underneath all kinds of other forces were at play, and, by the
time it's noticed, it often couldn't be reversed.� And so the protection that she'd taken
granted had suddenly been snatched away.�
She may have thought for most of her adult life that society allowed her
to send mixed messages about her sexuality, but that stopped now.� And so it began for her, the first of many
intimate experiences of being owned by another.�


&nbsp;

Rebecca haltingly described the poor choices she�d made in her
life; how she'd stolen money from her father numerous times and how he'd never
forgiven her, coming to feel that it was in her character to be a thief; the
ostracism in high school for being that worst of combinations for a young girl,
tall, gangly and intelligent, yet naive; the date rape/gang-bang at sixteen and
abortion at seventeen, about which her family still was not aware.� 

&nbsp;

It was at this time that the acting out began; the sullen
arrogance which daily wore her parents down, the slutty behavior with older
high school boys which culminated with the photo shoots with bikers� magazines,
the attempted rape at eighteen when she tried to recover the negatives from her
first photos.� When Rebecca finally
stopped crying about this, she told me about her husband and how they'd not
been a real couple for over three years; her face burned with shame as she
explained about the two young boys with whom she�d had sex at the first
school---always oral sex, never all the way and always on her terms.� Somehow, she seemed proud of this.� 

&nbsp;

She told me their names and where they'd rendezvoused.� And when the whispers started, she'd
transferred to her current school.�
Rebecca finally named the four boys she�d seduced there, describing in
detail where she�d met them and how she�d picked them.� She talked about how she allowed them to play
spanking games with her, then rewarded them with oral sex.� She always maintained complete and total
control over the teenage boys even as she allowed them to act in a
dominating manner.

&nbsp;

Any hint of arrogance was long gone by now as Rebecca admitted
that she needed help, then she talked about the remorse she felt for the way
she had treated her parents, the guilt she felt over what she�d done and how
disgusted she was with herself.� By the
time she finished, Rebecca had told me more about herself, her fears and her
self-loathing than she'd ever shared with her psychiatrist.� I appreciated her attempts at honesty all the
more because everything she said was caught on her tape recorder and my hard
drive---but how honest really was this woman, how could anyone trust her?� I already knew that much of what she'd told
me was a lie.� But I didn't have to let
her know that I knew.

&nbsp;

She was an empty husk, nothing left to hide and nothing behind
which to hide.� 

&nbsp;

�Thank you for cooperating, Rebecca.� You see, I can reward you when you talk to me
like this.�� I looked at her intensely
for a minute before I nodded my head and went to my knees next to her
chair.� 

&nbsp;

First, I unhooked her collar from its restraint and Rebecca could
move her head and upper body.� Next I
removed the handcuffs.� As soon as her
hands were freed, she began to move in a feeble and uncoordinated attempt to
get off of the chair.� 

&nbsp;

I said, �Wait.� Slow down.� Take your time.� I know feel you�ve just got to get off the
chair, but if you move too quickly, you�ll hurt yourself.�� But even as I spoke, my concern for her
welfare rang hollow in my ears.

&nbsp;

With this warning, I began to untie Rebecca�s shapely ankles from
under the seat of the chair.� When her
feet were finally freed, she slid them out on either side of the chair as
slowly and carefully as if her hips were made of rotten paper mache and then
she put her hands on her knees.� I held
my hands out to help her up, but she refused to look at me.� The impaled woman carefully pushed herself up
using her knees as she rose into a half-crouch.�
Rebecca had been used hard by the chair in the hours during which she'd
savored its embrace and now tragedy struck; after everything she'd suffered,
her knees finally gave out and she collapsed backwards.� There were no arms on the chair; leaning
forward as she tried to rise from her seat, she'd nothing to hang on to for
support.� Now Rebecca immediately cried
out in fear and horrific realization as gravity drove her back into the
impersonal wooden caresses of the waiting chair that she'd almost escaped.� I hadn't planned this---how could I?� But because she'd rejected my initial offer
of assistance, I let the beautiful, yet obviously still too-proud woman fall
backwards without trying to save her from the chair's wooden embrace. 

&nbsp;

I watched the whole drama unfold.�
I watched in silence as she began to skewer herself one last time;
crying out in great anguish as her legs finally failed and the enormous wooden
post that had moistly appeared only seconds before now disappeared as it was
again forcibly sheathed inside her lower body.�
It was like one of those ponderous and unstoppable acts of nature on the
National Geographic channel---great blue-white sheets of ice falling from the
side of an ice-berg almost in slow-motion.�
It was the same for Rebecca; once started, her physical collapse went on
to a stop-action conclusion despite her best efforts to prevent it.� 

&nbsp;

The more it entered her body again, the more erect she was forced
to sit.� At the end, she sat almost
primly upright in her seat, like a nun who had been forced to refer, however
euphemistically, to something obscene.�
The muscles around her anus had been impossibly stretched earlier by
what they'd been forced to accept.� But
these same terribly stretched and fatigued muscles now did their best to
stretch out again without tearing, while at the same time attempting to cling
to the sides of the wooden shaft as spasm after spasm tore through her
body.� Now sitting stiffly upright,
Rebecca cried out softly in horror even as she finally managed to grab the
sides of the stool and stop her descent before accepting the last few inches of
the immense wooden rod.� She looked at me
and I almost laughed.� Tears covered her
cheeks, her lips were pursed into an almost perfect �oh� and it looked like her eyes were ready to bulge out of her
head.

&nbsp;

I watched as she gathered her courage, then paused and took a
moment to catch her breath.� Finally, the
look of horror slowly changed to total determination; her face now drenched in
sweat and her lips pressed tightly together in a rictus of pain, Rebecca
supported herself off of the chair with her hands on the wooden seat as she
placed her feet more carefully under the chair this time.� After balancing herself again, she succeeded
this time in slowly standing up, revealing for the first time the full length
of the truly impressive wooden pole that she had successfully, if unwillingly,
accommodated for such a long time.

&nbsp;

Rebecca turned and looked down at what she'd been sitting on, then
closed her eyes and stood swaying, turning even more white.� Except for her eyes, the woman almost looked
like a remarkably life-like statue of alabaster.� I knew she must feel faint, because she
finally leaned against me.� She seemed to
feel better after a moment and she pushed herself away from my chest, standing
in front of me wearing only the terry cloth robe.� 

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

Suddenly my
stomach gave a lurch; my insides felt like they'd turned to frozen water that
was slowly melting; I was afraid I may have ruptured myself when my legs
collapsed.� While the torn flesh of my
rectum was cramping and it ached and throbbed from being ripped by being so
cruelly expanded, my innards were boiling and felt like they were burning hot
with acid indigestion---which I knew could not be---and something more.� I felt a detached physical emptiness, a sense
of vacancy inside as if a vacuum had somehow sucked out of me everything that
should be in my abdomen.� I was sure that
something was wrong inside me, something terribly wrong.� What he�d done to me was awful; no one should
have to go through it.� But somehow, even
as I felt anger, I also had a perverse sense grim satisfaction, of guilt
assuaged and justice fulfilled.� Even as
I'd sat again on that awful stool, there was an obstinate and contrary part of
me that just knew deep inside that I deserved whatever was done to me; I hated
him, but at that moment I hated myself more.�


&nbsp;

I hoped I
hadn�t been permanently injured.� 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Chapter 15: The rabbit snare
exists because of the rabbit.� Once you
have the rabbit, you no longer need the snare; Chuang Tsu.

&nbsp;

She was weak and without difficulty, I pushed Rebecca�s face
against the wall, then injected her in the ass through the robe one final
time.� When she next awoke, I had laid
her on the bed.� Naked again, she was
disoriented and so weak now there was no need for handcuffs.� She slowly sat up on the side of the
bed.� I had removed the phallus and was
now sitting in the chair in which she had suffered for so long, simply looking
at her.� When I saw that she was awake, I
walked over to the door that led outside and opened it.� Another front had moved in; it was cold and
dark, the temperatures had dropped into the high 30's.� The storm was in full progress and the
freezing rain was driven by the wind and fell in almost horizontal sheets.

&nbsp;

I had a small portable television/DVD player set up for her; I
turned it on without saying a word.� I�d
burned a disc with the latest news about the teacher Rebecca Denholm; it was
already loaded.� The woman being held
against her will looked at me then at the TV as it came on.� I walked over and stood next to her.� When the report started, it drew her undivided
attention.� At the end of the three
minute report, tears were running down her face.� Two extra days with me and freedom was
already a dream, a memory greatly shrunken around the edges.� As things worked out, it was clear that she
was considered a fugitive on the run, that her husband believed her guilty and
would provide no emotional support, and that her parents and family were in
self-imposed isolation, overwhelmed by it all.�
The news was devastating in both its brevity and clarity.

&nbsp;

I didn�t say a word---I didn�t need to.� No longer handcuffed, I could see that she
was still nevertheless restrained psychologically, perched on the bed and
frozen into submission by my controlled menace as I towered over her---or perhaps
it was her hopeless situation?� I grabbed
her small suitcase, carried it over to the door and placed it outside.� There was a lull in the wind and rain at the
moment.� Not a total abatement of the
storm�s clamor, but a lessening, a pause for regeneration before the next
assault.� I walked back, pulled Rebecca
to her feet and dragged her to the exit; after a moment�s hesitation, I pushed
her naked into the freezing light rain.� 

&nbsp;

I said, �Look at me.� LOOK
at me!� The nearest neighbors are about
two miles that way.� Come up with your
own excuse, whatever you can think of.�
But keep me out of it or you go to jail for most of the rest of your
life.�� I'd exaggerated about how far
away the neighbors lived and I had no idea what a jury would do to her---or
me.� But it kept her off-balance mentally.

&nbsp;

I slammed the door behind me as I went back into the White Room
without a backwards glance.� 

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I suddenly felt drained---the last few days had been tough on both
of us.� What would she do?� How would she react?� What would she choose?� What would I do?� How would I react?� I had a lot of thinking to do.� I'd been stupid.� For the first time in my adult life, I'd
allowed another person to make me act like an idiot and do truly stupid and
dangerous things.� I really didn't know
what to do. 

&nbsp;

Finally, I decided I needed a shower.� I stood under the hot needles for at least
half an hour just thinking; afterwards I fixed a cup of coffee to help me
relax.� The cold rain pounded on the roof
for at least another hour and I felt an introspective mood blanket me as I
listened to its drumbeat.� The room was
suddenly illuminated by a flash of lightning and instinctively I began to
calculate the proximity of the strike.�
The thunderclap exploded before I had reached three and my house
shook.� More strikes followed in quick
succession, and the rain hammered against the window.� The blues played softly in the background as
I finally looked out of a window and saw Rebecca in the front yard trying
futilely to shelter from the freezing downpour under a tree.� I went back to my chair and must have dozed
off.� 

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I lifted my head.� The noise
of the storm had become familiar and the sound was one that I just half-heard,
one that barely registered on my senses; it was discordant; out of place.� She must have seen me stealing a look
earlier, because now I heard pounding on the door that led to the patio in
back.� I wrapped a towel around my
waist.� I was amazed that the electricity
was still on and could enjoy a fresh cup of hot coffee.� I slowly walked over to the door.� It was Rebecca and she was drenched.

&nbsp;

The rain was lighter now, but her long hair hung in lines along
her cheeks and across her forehead.� She
was wearing at least three dresses, all of her clothing in layers, her arms
crossed over her chest.��� By this time,
her fine white skin was an overall light blue color.� Her nipples were enormous, pushing out like
coat pegs through the layers of cloth because of the cold, but at this moment I
could have cared less about her sexuality.�


&nbsp;

I held the coffee in my hand as I lazily opened the door and
looked at her.� There was a long silence,
but finally she said, �George, please.��
She tried to clench her jaw, but I could hear her teeth still clicking
and chattering after she spoke.

&nbsp;

I just looked at her and shook my head.� After a moment, I asked, �Why don�t you put
some more of your clothes on?� You might
be a little warmer.�

&nbsp;

�I don�t�.have anything�.that�s rainproof.� Everything�.I have�.would just get
soaked�.anyway.�� She hesitated for a
moment, �Please�George�.listen.� I
have�..no money.� I have nothing��nowhere
to go.� The police�..are looking for
me�.and�..and�you�ve made sure�..that�.I�.have�.nothing.� Please, God�..just let me stay�..for the
night.�

&nbsp;

I looked at her for a moment without saying a word, then told her
to stay right where she was.� As I
stepped back inside, I double locked the door in her face and then I walked
around through my bedroom and into the White Room.� After I closed and locked the door that led
to my bedroom, I opened the door that led onto the back deck.� 

&nbsp;

Rebecca was still standing by the door to the living room.� When I opened the playroom door, the sudden
rectangular blossom of light to the side attracted her attention.� She picked up her suitcase and slowly
splashed over to where I stood waiting.�
She stopped and put her suitcase down.�


&nbsp;

Rebecca stood in the open in the wind and the rain.� From my viewpoint, she was framed between the
bulk of the patio and the door post.� Her
wet clothing hid nothing; narrow waist tucked in above hips that were much
firmer and more shapely than their layered fullness now suggested.� The light in the room behind me cast the
shadow of one breast across the cone of the other, and her face was blank as
her eyes met mine.

&nbsp;

Then she started to walk past me into the White Room; I put my
hand on her chest and pushed her back.�
�God,� I said, �has nothing to do with this.�� Rebecca stood so close I could smell her wet
hair.

&nbsp;

I have been sexually dominant my whole life, as I guess too has
been this woman.� I am sure that there
are varying aspects of the dominant and the submissive in all of us.� To me, that�s only a partial explanation of
why I'd acted like a servile, love-struck weakling over the weekend---the force
of her personality had initially overwhelmed me.� But if she wanted to stay here, it wasn�t
going to be for just one night.� One of
us was going to have to change their sexual role---and I was damned if it would
be me.� I knew that I had to keep the
power in any future relationship with her; I also knew that she needed to
understand that I would keep it.

&nbsp;

She was looking at the floor in misery and I said, �Look at
me!� Look into my eyes.� If you come in here, I want it to be with
your eyes wide open and with a perfect understanding of what it means.�

&nbsp;

Now I purposively shifted the tone in my voice without warning to
something as cold as winter ice.� �First
of all, my name isn�t George, it�s Christian.�
But you�ll call me your Master.�
You have two choices, and you get to make your decision right here and
right now; you can either walk through this door or you can walk away from this
house forever.� You think you have
nothing now.� If you walk through this
door, you will have food and shelter, but I swear to God you�ll have nothing
else because I�ll take away everything you�ve got.�

&nbsp;

Rebecca looked at me like she couldn�t believe her ears.� 

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

He looked thoughtfully at my frozen legs and
gave a short, dry laugh, as if he knew a rude joke about me.� �I'm older and I want something different now.� I�ve been in many places in the world.� I have been looking for something�..� he
paused then and rubbed his fingers together, ��I�m looking for something
more---something different.� And you
might be it�at least for a few days.�

&nbsp;

�It�s all about the blood.�� He held the back of his hand to my frozen
face, making me shrink back.� �The way
the blood flows to the skin.�
Fascinating.�� He dropped his hand
and looked at me seriously.� �If you take
my offer, you�ll learn to love this.� And
after that, everyday you�ll want more and more.�

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I spoke in a voice so soft that I knew she had to strain to
hear.� �You and I are both flawed, but
we�re done with the games now.� I know
you�re hot-blooded by nature---and you've taught yourself to control your
desires.� But there's no more
role-playing now.� For you this is it,
this is the end; what you�ve been building to your whole life.� And now you get to make the decision you've
always avoided---you�ve no one or nowhere to turn for help and no one to blame
but yourself.� You�re not standing here
naked in the freezing rain because of me or the school or your students.� You�re here because you deserve to be;
and maybe some small part of you wants
to be here.�� It was hard to tell with
the rain, but I think that tears glistened in her eyes.

&nbsp;

I looked at her and shook my head.�
�I can break you, Rebecca.� I've just shown you that.� The stronger can always break the
weaker.� In every place, in every time,
the will of some man has shaped a woman's reality.� Here, now, in this room, that old rule is
still in place.� Fate, at least for you
Rebecca, is a fragile thing.� A mindless
thing, controlled by the whim of a strong man.�
Though it would take at most forty-eight hours to transform you into a
perfectly willing slave whose loyalty would never be in doubt, such a
transformation would virtually destroy the qualities that make you worth
having---all those vague words that come under the heading of spirit.�

&nbsp;

�So, instead, if you come inside I'd take my time as I worked on
you.� It'd be harder on you at first and
probably take a little longer, but it'd be worth seeing you in a......willing
and worshipful orbit around me.� I'm
telling you right up front what I'll do to you if you accept this offer and
there's not a damn thing you can do about it.�
If you come through this door, you�ll be accepting my collar and giving
up everything that you�ve ever taken for granted; and you WILL be starting over.� I�ll
take control of every aspect of your life; from when you get up in the morning
until you go to sleep at night.� What you
watch on television and when you get to watch it.� What you eat and when, and how your very day
is organized.� I�ll take away everything;
your freedom, your identity, your name.�
You will wear the clothes that I like or nothing at all.� You will no longer choose your hairstyle or
jewelry; you�ll always wear my collar around your neck.� You�ll have nothing in the beginning but what
I give you.� Nothing!� And in the end all you'll have is what I
allow you to keep.�

&nbsp;

I looked at the frozen woman harshly.� �You mouth loyalty to a string of tribal
ideas---truth, justice, freedom.� So
transferring your loyalty to a new orbit should be relatively easy, for the
idea of willingly serving me is no less vague than the idea of freedom. �Humans are, at our most basic, simple
creatures.� Like the computers fashioned
in our image, we operate on a binary code of pleasure and pain, a switch marked
ON and another marked OFF.�
In the end, finally, everything can be reduced to one or the other, everything
we love or loathe; these are what form our images of ourselves.�

&nbsp;

�If necessary, I�ll destroy you one tiny step at a time, just as a
man would break a� horse.� And then I�ll help you, train you to
understand exactly what I want from you.�
Every time you fail me, I�ll increase the penalties until you fear
failing me more than the need to maintain the fiction of any remaining �normality� in your life.� And when I am finished, you�ll be exactly
what I desire you to be---and nothing more.��


&nbsp;

Now I gave her a grim smile.�
�At the same time, I have no idea where it will end---and that should
scare the hell out of you.� There�s a
real possibility that I�ll have to almost kill you to break you, and that
should terrify you.� But I swear, however
fine or coarse the details may be, I will stay at this until you are exactly
what I want you to be.�� 

&nbsp;

Rebecca shivered all over again; she was so cold that she was
nodding off as she stood on her feet.

&nbsp;

I grabbed her shoulders and shook my head again.� I lifted her chin with my hand and made her
look me in the eyes.� And when I did, I
saw again that her eyes were the shockingly pale blue of a near albino, but it
was the aching emptiness inside that stopped me for a second.� If I could only get to it, I knew this woman
was holding a raw hunger whose depths I had only begun to taste.� But as I looked again, I could also see the
embers of resistance still burning; the calculating look was still alive. 

&nbsp;

Outside the rain stopped and started, stopped once more and started
again.

&nbsp;

I shook my head slowly as I looked at her.� �You�ve been a sexual dominant for your
entire adult life, but every dominant becomes submissive to someone at
sometime.�� I knew human nature well
enough to know that it happened all the time, the flip from Sub to Dom and
back; that the situation often wouldn�t even be sexual in nature.� I knew that it was only human and that it
never failed.� Finally, I knew that only
one of us could win here and that it would be me.� 

&nbsp;

�And you know what?� There�s
an animal part to your nature that you keep deep inside you and it liked what I
did to you over the last two days��and it�s eagerly looking forward to being
trained.� And so help me God, if you walk
through that door, I�ll drag that beast naked and screaming into the light and
make you face it and accept it.� More
than that, I�ll teach you embrace it with welcoming arms.�

&nbsp;

�No.� You can�t make me do
this!� Rebecca reacted finally.� I had
finally gotten through to the slow-working, chilled mind that inhabited the
frozen body.� Angry and cold, she was
shouting at me from what could only a lower-brain fear.� She could not admit that anything I said
intrigued her; for certain fears and reflexes are older than human
intellect.� She still refused to accept
the possible truth of anything I said about her and it showed on her face.� 

&nbsp;

She pulled her head back as I let go of her chin.� �One other thing you need to know if you walk
through that door.� There's a slut inside
you as well as a whore for pain, and I'm going to train you and fuck you until
I've brought it all out into the open for good.�
But someday you'll eventually come to understand too that this really
isn�t about sex.�� With this comment, her
remarkable blue eyes looked into mine and they seemed to blaze with the fiery
ice of hell.

&nbsp;

Now I continued in a reasonable tone and sort of pushed her back
towards the open door. �Honestly.� You
know---you�d be a hell of a lot better off with the police.�� And with this last, I began to shut the door
in her face.� 

&nbsp;

Rebecca stopped the door with her hand; her face looked like she�d
found a last reservoir of strength somewhere.�
I could actually see her gather herself for one last act of
defiance.� She looked me in the eyes and
in a clear, ringing voice said, �Fuck you, you crazy bastard.�� The fire in her soul was back as she reached
out and tried to slap me.� I blocked her
and quick as a snake, she scratched me along my right forearm.� I cursed and slapped her open-handed on the
cheek and sent her whirling to the floor.�


&nbsp;

She lay against the door jam, her knees together and calves pulled
under her, feet side by side and off to the right in the kind of position that
only women are flexible enough to achieve.�
It was normally an erotic look, especially when the woman's dress only
came up to mid-thigh, but Rebecca couldn't have looked less inviting right
now.� Her multiple layers of dresses were
soaking wet, her wet hair stringy and unbrushed, wearing no makeup and her left
hand to her cheek as she explored what the blow had done to the side of her
face.

&nbsp;

This was how mutinous women were treated in her new world.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I heard
ringing in my ears and for a moment was blinded by exploding stars.� When my vision cleared, I saw him standing
over me, wiping his hands on the towel around his waist.� I was playing his game by his rules when I
did this.� I had to be smarter, but it
was so hard to think straight.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

The flat slap-in-the-face sound hardly left an echo in the
room.� We both froze for a second, then
she slowly climbed to her feet and stepped outside with her small bag.� I shrugged my shoulders and loosened my neck
before I closed the door.� I had felt
more and more vigor as I had talked, but now I suddenly felt a crushing feeling
of malaise as she disappeared into the night.�
I didn�t have enough energy to bother cleaning up the place right now; I
was pretty sure that even if she truly left me for good, Rebecca wouldn�t go to
the police.

&nbsp;

I shook my head; this was an incredibly complex woman with some
sort of a Freudian-Jungian-Steven Kingian thing about her.� She was light and feminine, but there was
fierceness in her that I associated with the strongest drill sergeants I'd ever
known.� It was as if times of stress like
this brought out the strength in her; a steel core able to withstand, at least
temporarily, all I could do to her.� It
was survival instinct.� Something in her
DNA that went back a million years.� Oh
yes, it was all there---and I wanted it all.

&nbsp;

I was torn; I was pissed about my arm and the breath hissed
between my teeth as I put Band-Aids on the deep scratches.� At the same time, I felt a grudging sense of
admiration.� Only one thing was for
sure---I had been bluffing; the last part about me not caring what she did
hadn't been true.� I wasn�t exactly sure
what I felt for her right now; anger, a need to smash her face, lust for her
body, an urge to crush her defiance....to monster-fuck her and destroy the
assurance and confidence of a mouthy, opinionated, arrogant, feminist bitch and
replace it with fear and the utmost respect for me; all of these
things.� For only then would she truly
know what it meant to belong to another; to be at her Master's beck and call,
answering to and suffering from his merest whims for the rest of her life.� 

&nbsp;

I'd been in the BDSM scene for a number of years.� And while I've seen a few good relationships
that were out of the mainstream, these were more than balanced by a lot of �fantasy�
stupidity.� Even among those who think
they wanted to live this lifestyle, there still existed an incredible ignorance
regarding the differences between some idiot's fantasies and the real aspects
of BDSM.� As with ANY lifestyle, there
were literally hundreds of things that distinguished the reality from the
fantasy.� Likewise, it also took a lot of
work by both sides to make it work.

&nbsp;

But if I kept this woman, only one of us would be trying to make
it work and there would be no fantasies here.�
I knew that I wanted her to stay because she intrigued me; she was the
first woman that'd ever truly challenged me in this way.� 

&nbsp;

In shock, I finally realized that I wanted her.� But like a child, I wanted to know her better
in MY way, not hers; I wanted to re-make her into the exact image of the woman
that would be most pleasing to me.� My
God, was this ever a fucked up situation.�
She was as strong-willed and generally dangerous to men as a
scorpion---and here I was planning on giving her unimaginable motivation to
hurt me.� This was actually a small town;
I had a history and it was obvious that once the police knew where to look, she
could easily wind up putting me in jail for the rest of my life, and I wanted
to �know her better.�

&nbsp;

I needed to be smart about this, but she somehow still threw
me.� I had serious needs and
intellectually, I knew exactly how to do her.�
But for some reason, with this woman there'd been an instant emotional
connection that made me feel like I had entered some kind of a Disney world for
S&amp;M'ers.� It may have only been lust
at first and later I'd despised her, but I'd always wanted her.

&nbsp;

I had never kept a non-consensual for over a day; and always
before I'd kept my identity well hidden. Rebecca was the first that I had made
serious plans about keeping and I was nervous.�
It wasn't that I lacked confidence; even if I did, I would never let her
know.� I wasn't that nervous about the
police or about being able to control her.�
I'd seen enough things in my life that these things didn't really bother
me any more.

&nbsp;

The problem was that I wasn't sure what motivated me; too many
times after a few months or years of acting the role, I had seen the dominant
in many local relationships completely lose interest in controlling his
submissive.� He would, in a way, turn
vanilla on her and if she had sincere submissive needs, sexually, she would then
be right back where she was before she'd met him.� And this caused problems.

&nbsp;

I didn't want to spend a lot of time and effort on this woman and
then lose interest or become bored with her.�
I'd be damned if I'd let that happen.�
I was going to do this right---or I'd get rid of her.� And if it came to the last, I was afraid that
meant having to do something permanent, an action I wasn't yet sure I was ready
to take.

&nbsp;

I walked back into my living room and lowered myself into my
high-backed leather chair, rubbing my right arm and finishing my coffee.� I felt like it was an oasis of calm after my
last encounter with the bitch-that-used-to-be.�
The leather chair exhaled as it accepted my weight and I continued
massaging the skin of my arm, avoiding the patch work of Band-Aids that ran
from elbow to wrist.� About twenty
minutes later, I heard knocking on the window in back again; it was
Rebecca.� I got up and walked over to the
window and looked at her.� The cold rain
was still sleeting down.� She closed her
eyes for a second, then looked at me again.�
Without another word, she turned and walked over to the door to the
White Room and stood waiting for me.� I
watched her through the glass for a moment; she stood facing the door and never
looked back at me.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

The rain
never stopped and I felt cold, so awfully cold.�
The urge to sit down and go to sleep was almost overwhelming.� I felt weak and drowsy, almost like I was
peacefully sinking into a sea of warm milk.�
God, I was so tired of fighting everything and everyone.� Please come quickly, I�m dying.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I walked into the White Room and opened the door for her.� She moved sluggishly and looked at the floor
and at my feet, at the ceiling behind me, everywhere but at me.� �Same rules apply now as half an hour ago,� I
said.� 

&nbsp;

I'd made my mind up.� I
needed to give her one last piece of truth about our arrangement, then I was
going ahead with the non-con arrangement.� �And one thing more---unless you and I hit it
off real well together, never doubt that I�ll keep you in slavery until the
time comes to dump your ass---maybe when your tits begin to sag or your ass
starts to get a little bigger or maybe even just when you start to get a few
crow�s feet.�� 

&nbsp;

I shook my head at her.� �I
don�t even know what it�ll take to make me toss you out on your ass with
nothing, but I guarantee that the time will come unless you give me everything
I could ever want.� So�.make your choice
and be damned sure that you can live with it, bitch, because when you do
there�s no going back afterwards.�

&nbsp;

She still hesitated.� The
rain was pouring through the open door and I was getting cold now myself; I was
annoyed and perhaps that was why I couldn�t pass up the chance for a final dig
at her�..or maybe it was because I was more emotionally fucked up than
she.� �You bitch, I KNOW that you like it rough.�
Maybe,� I looked at her slyly, �allowing me to fuck you up will help you
to get rid of some of that Catholic guilt you carry on your back like a hundred
pound bag of cement.� You know, do some
major penance for your sins and then you can start the rest of your life over
fresh.� Or maybe, just maybe, you�re
nothing but a sick fuck like the rest of us and in the last few days you�ve
found out that you really liked what I did to you and now you want more.� Have you thought about that?� Come inside and learn about yourself; maybe
I�m the one that can give you the answers that you'll learn to look forward to
every night when you finally close your eyes.�
Two birds with one stone; get rid of your sins and a little rough
servicing at the same time?�

&nbsp;

I looked at her for a second.�
In that moment, I felt a sudden pang of guilt---but then just as quick
it was gone.� �Nah.� You�re a pervert and just as fucked up as the
rest of us.� Go on, go the police and get
it over.�� I started to close the door a
second time, but she stopped it again.

&nbsp;

For a moment, I felt an sense of hollowness.� I had run out of words and I was filled with
an uncharacteristic sense of�..uncertainty.�
Not for the first time, I wondered if she was really willing to submit
to my collar.� If she did, she would be
taking a giant step into the unknown and it was too big, too important to be a
half-assed move on her part.� I finally
faced the truth; I wanted her to understand this�.because I wanted her.� 

&nbsp;

I think I could have loved her as she was now; strong and
intelligent.� But this was the person she
would cease to be if I had my way.� And I
doubted very much if I could� learn to
care for the person she would become.� My
intentions were not romantic or honorable.�
I wanted her body.� I wanted her
zeal and her clean face.� Her poise and
her determination and her intelligence.�
I wanted it all, so that I could control it, break it and re-make it
into something that was one hundred percent mine.

&nbsp;

Rebecca looked at me as she shivered in the rain.� �I could go to the police and tell them that
you kidnapped me.� And that�s why I
wasn�t around this weekend.�

&nbsp;

�Sure,� I replied as I laughed in her face.� �Go ahead and tell the cops.� That�ll be great.� First I�ll show them a short video of us on
Saturday and Sunday---that�s right, you�re on tape.� That�ll sure convince them that you were here
against your will; I mean our fucking our brains out and all.� Sure, I'll get in a little trouble for making
the tape without your knowledge, but that'll knock your story in the ass.� Then I�ll have them check out the house.� It�ll take you at least three or four hours
to get to the cops and then get them back here, and I promise you that this
room will be absolutely clean by then.�
And I won�t have to touch the bedroom because of course we both admit
that you were there.� Finally, as a good,
law abiding citizen, I�ll be forced to give them an audio copy of the tape that
I've just edited, the one in which you tell me about all the other boys that
you�ve molested.� Or maybe I�ll just give
them the names and let them do the leg work.�

&nbsp;

I put a contemptuous tone in my voice, �Headlines at ten!� The Teacher
lied!� There was more than one!�� �Mr.
Police Person,� I continued in a mocking tone, �here I was just fucking her and it came out as pillow talk.� I was shocked, just shocked when she told me
that!�

&nbsp;

Now all of a sudden, I was angry.�
�You�d do time for multiple sexual offenses then.� Perhaps twenty years, instead of six or
seven.� And you know what?� You're fucked up in the head and deserve
every fucking minute of it!�� I gave her
a tight smile that had no humor in it.�
�So, you dumb fucking slut.� Make
up your mind.� I�m getting cold and wet
holding this door open.� In or out.� Cops and jail, or me and everything that you
so richly fucking deserve.�

&nbsp;

She seemed to drag up a last bit of her courage, a last act of
bravado before she gave in to the inevitable.�
She closed her eyes against the rain and shook her head.� �You hate me for some reason, don�t
you?�� 

&nbsp;

�Hate you?�� I asked
mockingly, then smirked slyly.� �Hate you?� Of course not---well, not too much
anyway---it's more like an intense dislike of what you represent.� But I will break you.� And even you'll admit there must be some
small training in obedience for one of your nature.� Some small humbling of pride.� Just a little.�� 

&nbsp;

My eyes held hers, and in them she finally read the truth.� She closed her eyes for almost a minute as
the rain continued to pound down on us both.�
There was no look of bitterness or self-pity on her face as she finally
looked at me again.� Rebecca shook
herself and thrust her head forward in a way that seemed almost
reptilian---defiant, angry.� �All you do
is take�..if I had anything left, I�d never allow you to do this to me.� I swear I wouldn�t allow it.� Someone will make you pay for this
someday.�� Then Rebecca inhaled deeply
and held it for a second; finally she exhaled and stepped across the threshold
of the door, committing herself to me.

&nbsp;

Edgar Allan Poe once wrote an essay called &quot;The Imp of the Perverse,&quot; one of
the most insightful and important works I've ever read.� Poe explored the importance of perversity in
human affairs: the fact that surprisingly often, people do things just because
they shouldn't.� Because these things are
wrong, or dangerous.� Or evil.� It was like that here; with that one step,
she was mine.� I never cease to be amazed
at how people can convince themselves to give up everything and accept the
unacceptable, as long as the offer is outrageous---or dangerous---or wrong
enough.

&nbsp;

As Rebecca stepped inside, she knew her freedom would last just
long enough for her to make one last comment without repercussions, �You think
you�ve won.� You think you�ve triumphed.� You think you�ve gotten the ultimate
prize.�� She shrugged, all emotions like
hope now gone from her voice and face.�
�You don�t get much with this package.�
Sorry to disappoint you.�

&nbsp;

I didn't say a word, but just started ripping her wet clothes off until
she stood naked in front of me.� Small
Taser burn marks broke the light reflected from her wet, smooth, bluish skin,
mainly around the outside of her thighs and chest, but they would soon be gone.� I told her to open her mouth.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Chapter 16: He who surrenders in the course
of interrogation, not only was forced to talk, but has forever been compelled
to accept a status: that of being sub-human; J.P. Sartre.

&nbsp;

I knew I
wasn�t thinking clearly; I was ready to tell him in
very definite terms what he could do with his offers and his demands, but the
words just didn't seem to come out.� Then
I noticed he was wearing a supercilious half-smile, and I could see that this
was what he had expected of me from the beginning.� His contempt was plain.� I sensed he thought of me as weak, as a
temporizing object, a female of no strength and little value.� My mouth was open to speak; but under that
sneering expression, different words came out.�
Even freezing, I wouldn't give him the satisfaction of being right.

&nbsp;

I had to get
inside and get warm; I would die in the rain and the darkness.� How bad could it be, I asked myself?� It couldn�t be any worse than what he'd
already done to me.� He was a sick, evil,
twisted bastard.� I knew I could handle
anything he tried to do, and once I was warm again, we'd see how it ended.� I knew now that I was capable of murder.� After what he'd done to me, as soon as he
dropped his guard, I'd do my best to gut him like a fish.� I might be discovered, but no one would blame
after I told them what he'd done to me.�
I clutched my arms tightly to my chest to maintain what little warmth I
had left; I was chilled to the bone and goose bumps covered most of my
body.� I leaned against the door as a
helium bubble expanded in the depths of my skull.� It was difficult to put words to thoughts,
but I tried.� �And here, you probably
feel like Christmas is early.�� I took a
deep breath in an effort to dispel my lightheadedness.� �You don�t get much with this package.� Sorry to disappoint.�

&nbsp;

He began
tearing at my clothes, pulling and ripping.�
Buttons flew and zippers were ripped.�
Soon I stood naked again in the room.�
I felt the cold air wash across my wet body and did my best to keep what
little warmth I still had inside.� 

He talked
quickly as he stripped me.� I didn't
understand what he meant, but he told me that from the first time he'd laid
eyes on me, he'd wanted me for his ass-candy.�
At his sharp command, I opened my mouth and suddenly he began filling it
with a long black pear-shaped gag that he'd been holding in his hand---it
seemed that he had been very sure of my response to his ultimatum.� It rested on my tongue and filled my mouth to
the back of my throat; the taste was of cold rubber wiped clean with disinfectant.� It was the taste of horror, of slavery, of
total loss of personal control and it immediately filled me with disquiet at my
decision.� My teeth instinctively bit
into the hard rubber and I closed my eyes as I somehow accepted all that it
represented.� 

&nbsp;

In that
brief instant, my mind replayed the events leading up to this second.� In vivid slow motion, I was afforded the
opportunity to regret a million moments that I could have re-written to prevent
what was about to happen.� But in the
end, I knew that it was all hopeless.�
For no matter what chances I might have been given to redo every wrong
that I�d ever done, in the end I knew in my heart that I�d always wind up
here.� Naked and freezing, standing in a
doorway as I allowed a man that I barely knew to force a gag down my
throat.� 

&nbsp;

And the
funny part was that he was right in a lot of what he had said.� Perhaps this was even justified; but I knew
it was inevitable that I would fight him in anything he tried to take from me.� But there was also a sense of the absolute
inescapability about it all; there would be huge battle of wills, but somehow I
knew I would eventually be forced to submit to this evil man, even if just to
pay for my sins as I balanced some sort of a cosmic scorecard.� And in a perverse sort of way, I hoped too
that he would be a hard master, for I knew that I deserved no less.� But if he wanted me like he said he did, I
would make him take me---he'd have to earn me, if he was strong enough.

&nbsp;

I could
barely imagine what it would be like to temporarily surrender to this man or
any man for that matter, but especially to a monster who gazed with full focus
on me as he did.� Even as we stood apart,
I almost felt the touch of his eyes on my cold skin, the hungry mouth moving
closer to mine.� But I had given over all
control to him for the moment.� And the
seductively liquid release of all responsibility to him---that was what scared
me the most.

&nbsp;

The gag
filled my mouth and finally was fastened tightly around my neck.� Then he roughly threw me against the
wall.� I closed my eyes as he pulled on
my left wrist; I heard the distinctive �snick-snick� of what I assumed was a
handcuff as I felt a constricting tightness around my wrist.� My right hand was pulled around and suddenly
I had lost my freedom.� Finally, he put a
thick, black leather dog collar around my neck and fastened it in back.� I shivered in my nakedness as my forehead
leaned against the wall; I made no sound as he finished.� There was such a sense of finality with this
act, such a feeling of inevitability�..I had voluntarily accepted a dog's
collar to save my life.....and my freedom was now gone.

&nbsp;

He dragged me
over to a long wooden plank that was bolted against the wall.� It rested at a forty-five degree angle and
had an iron ring fastened at the very top, and what looked like a cross beam at
the bottom that ended in two stirrup-like affairs, one on each side.�� Both had velcro straps that kept my feet
firmly in place in the stirrups.� Now I lay
on my back on that plank, my wrists strapped together and bound above my head
to the iron ring, my legs spread-eagled and my feet velcro'd into stirrups that
kept them immobile.� I was naked except
for my collar and alone except for the terrible cold.� The room was dark and soft blues played in
the background as the CD player broke its heart over a faithless woman; but
there was no one listening but me.� He'd
left when he finished and I'd not seen or heard him again.� The straps cut off the circulation in my
fingers and I'd lain this way for what seemed days.� 

&nbsp;

The room was
considerably warmer than outside.� But
even so, my skin and muscles felt numb, as if I were frozen solid into one
block of ice.� Even as I lived in that
gray world, I somehow knew that hours had passed, and last night had become
today; I had lost all real sense of time.�
The pain fused with the music, the ache in my upper body twinning with
the guitar riffs and the bluesy lyrics that he had playing softly.� The room was dark and the atmosphere moist
from the rain outside, but slowly it got a little warmer.� Underlying what soon came to seem the stink
of my body were the smells of a small room, overloaded with human
presence.� The only source of light was a
small light on the wall, just strong enough to reveal his shape when he came
around, a bulky shadow that moved as silently as a highlight on dark
satin.� Sometimes he came to just watch,
other times he came to jab a hypodermic needle into my thigh, causing all the
pain and terror to dissolve again into giddy warmth.� Sometimes he came only to breathe on me.� I couldn't believe that he was the same man
that I'd had sex with earlier.

&nbsp;

I tried to
ignore the cold, but it chewed its way through skin and flesh, heading for the
bones and the marrow.� I closed my eyes
and sent myself somewhere hot.� An
island, a beach, a dazzling sun.� I felt
warm water, salt on my skin, the sun burning me.� It wasn't just my body that was frozen, it
was my mind too.

&nbsp;

Sometimes
during the long periods of aloneness, I forced myself to relive the opening
hours of our relationship again and again, hoping by doing so I could somehow
will the outcome to change.� Not a
rational hope, but it was the only one I had.�
The last time we made love; that was the point at which I wanted to
change things.� I wanted to insert new
details and escape the drug-induced blackout.�
I wanted to amend the part about being kidnapped and dragged to
someplace new while I was unconscious, and the part about the wooden
plank.� 

&nbsp;

But I couldn't
change things.� My reality had hardened
like cement and I had no choice but to endure it.� A door opened and suddenly I knew that he had
returned.� Another needle, perhaps more
music.� Possibly a squirt of water from a
squeeze bottle and a marshmallow to chew on as before, and then the gag would
be put back on again.� I wondered how
much longer I could last like this.

&nbsp;

He walked into
the room and stood beside me.� I glanced
at him once and then looked away.� My
skin was ice-cold and he began rubbing me all over my chest, bringing the
circulation back, warming me.� I could
smell the very stink of his animal confidence as he leaned over; it frightened
me and made me angry at the same time.�
Soon he was finished and I knew what he planned, it was immediately
obvious.� He was naked.� His manhood stood out at an angle from his
groin as it pointed at the ceiling; and even though I was intimately familiar
with him, he looked immense from this angle, the head purple and slick and
shiny.� He must have already applied a
lubricant, because despite my dryness he plunged into me, effortlessly, silently,
burying himself into me up to the hilt.� 

&nbsp;

His huge cock
seemed to penetrate my abdomen as if I were gutted like a fish.� I couldn�t help myself, I shrieked once into
the gag in pain and anger and fear as the massive member fully penetrated me
and I felt his balls slap against my buttocks.�
But I somehow forced myself to be quiet after that---I knew how hopeless
screaming would be.� And I wanted to deny
him any possible pleasure he may have felt in the act of rape.� It's odd what goes through your mind at
times; all I could think about was how rough his beard was against my cheek and
neck---and that he would leave a rash on my skin.

&nbsp;

He started to
move back and forth, his cock sliding easily in and out of my belly, the
friction of his hips forcing my body up and down the wooden plank with every
thrust.� He drove into me, filling me in
a way that he had not been able to accomplish previously---or maybe it was
me.� He seemed to go on and on, finally
increasing the friction of his rubbing, sliding moves against my hips and
stomach until with a guttural groan of satisfaction, he suddenly came inside
me.� The shocking sensation rocketed
throughout my mind.� I was married and
had been groped and allowed inexperienced boys to fumble over me, but it had
been many, many months since I'd allowed a man, any man including my husband,
inside me without wearing protection.�
This man controlled my body and I couldn't stop him, but I also wouldn't
give him any satisfaction either as I looked away from him.� I hated the feeling of his scalding hot semen
as it wetly exploded inside me, coating me.�
I hated every part of him.

&nbsp;

When he was
done, he caught his breath for a minute while he laid on me, then pulled
himself off and walked over to the corner, then returned with two small pieces
of metal.� He leaned over me and sucked
on my left nipple for a second until it was hard, then flicked it with his
finger before he put a small clamp on it.�
The clamp had a saw-like teeth and a twist knob to tighten the
jaws.� He tightened the clamp until my
hips arched off the plank in agony.� Then
he did the same to my other nipple.� God,
they hurt so much.� Then, he walked over
to the door and disappeared for a minute.�
He was still naked when he came back, but now he held a small video camera
and carried a belt and what looked in the darkness like a stick.� He positioned the view screen of the video
camera so that I could see it, then he turned the camera on and I watched
myself being raped.� He obviously had a
camera lens above me, because I could see myself in every detail as he took
me.� 

&nbsp;

When the
horrifying video was done, he said, �Look at me woman.�� I wasn't going to voluntarily give him
anything he wanted, so I ignored him and turned my face away.� He said softly, �Not fast enough,� and he hit
me across my breasts with the belt.� I
arched and screamed into the gag, but he he hit me three or four more times
without saying another word.� There was
nothing I could do but scream and cry in pain.�
Finally, he stopped and inspected my breasts.� As he held each one up to the light, I could
see a trickle of blood running down from each nipple.� The pain was incredible.� 

&nbsp;

�Now that I've
got your attention, we go on to the main part of the lesson.�� Suddenly, he dropped the belt and began to
use the cattle prod he'd brought into the room.�
He pushed it into my left thigh and held it there for what seemed hours,
but must have been only ten seconds.� I
screamed and thrashed under the assault, but gained not an inch of additional
freedom.

&nbsp;

He started
talking to me again, �You're a beautiful woman and you belong to me now.� Look at me, my Little Slave.��� I looked at him quickly this time, but again
he said, �Not fast enough.�� I could see
by the look in his eyes that no matter what I did, no matter how quickly I
obeyed him now, he was going to hurt me again and again and there was nothing
that I could do to stop him.� This time,
he held the electric prod against my clitoris for about fifteen seconds.� When he was done, I couldn't breathe and my heart
was racing, hammering so fast I thought it would explode.� 

&nbsp;

�You disobey
me,� he said softly, �you get punished.�

&nbsp;

He shook his
head and said, �My women respond.� They
ALWAYS respond.� But you just laid
there.� You saw yourself in the camera.� Not an expression on your face.� You didn't move an inch on your own; you
actually made an EFFORT to deny me satisfaction.� Not fucking good enough by half.�� And he used the cattle prod again, this time
against my stomach.� 

&nbsp;

When he was
done this time, he looked closely into my eyes.�
�You belong to a man now.� When
you see me, you will always smile, whether you feel like smiling or not.� Learn to smile.....NOW.�� I still had his gag in my mouth and I
honestly didn't know what he wanted.� I
was confused, and when I didn't immediately react to his command, the cattle
prod came up against my right nipple and I screamed and writhed under his
punishment for at least ten or fifteen interminable seconds.� I was sweating profusely in the cold room
now, but it didn't matter to him.� 

&nbsp;

�Smile,� he
said again.� And I did; God help me, to
the best of my ability I smiled at him around the black rubber that so
grotesquely, yet so completely filled my mouth.�
�That's what I want to see,� he smiled back at me.� Earlier I thought I'd begun to know this man
a little, but I was mistaken.� He was a
monster and some day, somehow, I would kill him if I had the chance.� 

&nbsp;

�From this
point on, when you have sex with a man, your whole goal is to please him.� This is your first major lesson, learn it
well.�� And with this, he turned and
placed the cattle prod against the wall by my head and walked out of the room,
leaving me strapped to the plank as my fears swirled formlessly in my mind.

&nbsp;

He left me
alone for what seemed hours.� My vagina
throbbed and my nipples ached from the clamps he'd left pinned on them.� And then suddenly he was beside me
again.� Trying not to set him off, I
faked a passivity I didn't feel.� It was
dark outside so I knew that it must be evening of my first day with him.� Telling me to keep silent, he removed my gag
so that I could sip Gatorade from a squeeze bottle he held.� I had done nothing wrong to this man, but I
wanted to beg his forgiveness.� I wanted
to beg him to let me cooperate, to let me go----but I said nothing.� When I finished, he forced my mouth open and
gagged me again; and as quick as that, it was too late to say anything, to late
to try to reason with him.�� He ran his
hands up and down my legs and stomach for several minutes, and suddenly I knew
that he wanted me again.�� 

&nbsp;

He was quickly
ready as before, but this time had not come to me quite as prepared---there was
no lubricant now.� He'd left the clips on
my nipples and as he lowered his weight onto me, he ground them into my flesh.� He could hear me whimpering in pain and fear,
but he didn't care.� I was dry and it
took him four or five thrusts to fully enter me; he hurt me a lot when he took
me this time.� He grabbed my hair and
pulled my head back, whispering in my right ear, �Smile for the camera,
baby.� Smile for your man.� 

&nbsp;

Dread pooled
like acid in my stomach.� He went on and
on, and I was helpless.� I have never
developed a taste for playing the defenseless female and I didn't know how to
do it now.� I know I hated how it made me
feel.� Then he hurt me, and regardless of
how angry and humiliated I might have felt, I was ashamed to admit how hard I
tried to smile around that big piece of black rubber as he raped me a second
time.� 

&nbsp;

I'd once read
that prostitutes always partitioned their minds.� Anytime of the day or night, anything to keep
a part of themselves locked away, protected and private.� So I tried to do this too, tried to divorce
myself from my body, tried to convince myself that it didn't matter what a
stranger did to it.� Anything to make it
easier to deal with the pain, the humiliation, the disgust.� The alternative was panic, hysteria and
insanity.� I finally felt the stillness
as it began in my head, like an anesthetic, and spread through the rest of my
body.� The body was reduced to matter and
nothing more.� And after a couple of
minutes of being ridden, I went away into my mind and eventually, finally, it
was over.

&nbsp;

I suddenly
realized that he still had not shaved.

&nbsp;

Again, he left
to get the camera and suddenly, I was filled with mounting dread.� When he came back, the look on his face told
me all I needed to know.� Without a word,
the cattle prod went into my right breast for at least 15 seconds.� He wanted me screaming and afraid, and I
tried to refuse to give him both.� My body
arched and shuddered in a spastic reflex to the electricity running through it,
my teeth doing their best to bite the rubber gag in half.� I tried my damnedest not to scream, but
quickly I was giving him exactly what he wanted.� My chest was heaving as I sucked air through
my nostrils when he finished, my heart hammered as I tried to breathe.� I couldn't see very well because of the tears
in my eyes.� But he just looked into my
face and shook his head.� 

&nbsp;

�Not good
enough, woman.� You may be smart, but you
are definitely a slow learner.�� The prod
bit again into the soft flesh of my stomach and I spent the next 20 or 30
seconds arching and thrashing like a fish that had just been gaffed into the
bottom of a boat.� I know at the end I
must have screamed for his mercy, but I don't remember anything but the awful
pain.� My heart was beating in my chest
and I felt like I would vomit.� And then,
finally, it was over for now and he just looked at me as he rested the cattle
prod on my chest.� I stared at the awful
end of the prod and waited in dread.� The
anticipation of the coming pain was so terrible that I started sweating and
feeling the pain before it actually happened.�
It was awful; I was hurting and I could feel the pain of the prod, even
as I could clearly see that its terrible business end had not yet even touched
me. 

&nbsp;

�You belong to
me now.� I warned you about what you
would give up, but you chose this life anyway.�
Wish you could back and make that choice again?� Probably....but it's too late for that.� Now it's time to start learning what your new
life really means.�� Suddenly, the
current flashed through the cattle prod again and I was arching and screaming
and bucking as I tried to get away from the relentless shock. 

�

Then it was
over.� He slowly removed the nipple
clamps and rubbed my breasts softly.�
Before he walked away he looked at me for a long minute.� �Like I told you before, the gag isn't
because I'm afraid that someone will hear you scream,� he shook his head---�no
one will ever hear you again unless I allow it.�
No.� The gag is to instill
discipline.� You will learn to obey, and
you'll quickly learn that immediate obedience is demanded every time.�

&nbsp;

�The next time
we fuck, the gag comes out and I'm sure that you will want to cooperate in every
way.� Think about it.� Total cooperation and complete
submission....think how peaceful that could be.�
How painless and enjoyable that could be.�

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

It was light
outside again now.� He had left me alone
again for what seemed a couple of days, but was probably only six or seven
hours.� Even though I tried, I knew that
I could not stand up to anymore of the electricity.� I still felt a burning, residual anger, yet
at the same time, I was so shamed by my inability to fight his brutality that
when he came back next, I couldn't even look him in the eyes.� With shock, I realized that it wasn't
necessarily fear that would defeat me, it could just as easily be shame or
humiliation.� 

&nbsp;

I'd been
strapped to his plank for at least one, probably closer to two days.� My lower back was killing me and I was in my
own world trying to get a handle on the pain, when suddenly I was overcome by
an urge that could not be fought.�
Helplessly, I felt my bowels let go and I defecated over the plank and
my lower body.� I lay on my back on that
plank, my legs spread wide for his eventual pleasure, covered in my own filth
for hours.� First I was overcome by rage
that he would do this to me, then came humiliation and finally, I was filled with
a devastating feeling of helplessness; I knew that I was a weak person in many
ways, but he treated me as if I had no worth at all.� This had to be one of the lowest moments in
my life.� 

&nbsp;

I couldn't
smell anything anymore, but when he finally came into the room again, the smell
must have been overpowering, because he immediately opened the door to let in
fresh air.� Then he brought in a garden
hose from outside and began to wash me off.�
He didn't seem angry, just business-like.� The water was warm and felt good on my skin
as he scrubbed me clean without a word.�
He left after he'd hosed down the floor.�
He had the room warmer now and although I was still cold, I dried
quickly.� The water drained away and the
plank soon dried, but the room retained the strong taint of my shame even as he
came back in carrying a small tray an hour later.� First he ostentatiously planted the electric
cattle prod in a place that I would see it no matter where I looked.� Telling me to smile, he removed my gag, and
after plugging something into the wall, without another word, he mounted me
again and invaded my body without pretense or charm, and without warm up.� For my part, I knew I feared him, but somehow
I still felt numb at the same time.�� But
I didn't attempt my same mind trick to escape a second time, as without shame,
I moved as erotically as possible beneath him; however, I did my best to smile
into his camera this third time.� I
wanted to avoid the cattle prod, not satisfy his needs and obey his rules, but
I knew the results would look the same to anyone watching, regardless of
motivations.� 

&nbsp;

The man that
would be my Master groaned loudly as he came inside me a third time, then he
lay upon me for a couple of minutes just catching his breath.� Finally he got off and gagged me again.� I somehow forced myself to watch and as he
moved, his now flaccid penis began to shrink in the cold air and pull up into
his scrotum.� He reached under the plank
where he'd laid some things and brought out several straps.� He velcro'd one around each of my thighs just
above my knees.� Then he tied a thin rope
to the D-ring on one strap and ran the rope under the board before running it
through the D-ring on the other strap.�
When he pulled on the end of the rope that ran through the second
D-ring, he pulled my knees as far apart as they would go.� He then tied the rope off so that I lay
there, totally helpless and spread wide for his pleasure until he released
me.� 

&nbsp;

It was terribly
uncomfortable, as if my legs were being pulled from their hip sockets.� Drafts of cold air in the room brushed the
insides of my thighs and the lips of my vagina, and I felt goose bumps rising
again.� Next he ran straps from under the
plank over my abdomen and then above my breasts, and when he was finished
tightening them, I couldn't move a muscle.�
I was helpless, totally immobilized; I could barely breathe. 

&nbsp;

Finally
finished tying me down, he turned on a strong, intense light and shined it upon
my body, after which he draped a towel over my face.� He wanted to hide something from me; I
somehow knew that this too important for me not to see.� I threw my head back and forth, but could
never get the towel off.� He lowered
himself onto my stomach and I could feel fresh cool air rush in as he separated
my labia from my right thigh.� There was
a warm wet feeling as he washed me there, then a quick feeling of wet cold as
he wiped something else between my legs.�


&nbsp;

At first I
wanted to fight, I NEEDED to fight......but there was nothing I could do, my
body wouldn't move, couldn't move.� It
had shut down.� My mind had taken the
full impact of his words and his last actions like a cheap Japanese car taking
a hit from a Mack truck, and my legs received no instructions from my
brain.� It was as if the machine inside
had simply been turned off.� And then he
touched the inside of my thigh.� He did
it gently, so softly as to seem almost non-threatening, but in its damning
simplicity the gesture was enough to jolt me to my core.� I felt an electric shock pass from his
fingers into my bones.� Suddenly, my
motor impulses seemed to return and my mind was back in the here and now.� By this time the air was full of the smell
something burning.� And then with a
quick, smooth move he did it and I was marked as his property forever.� 

&nbsp;

I felt a
horrendous burning sensation pressing right at the juncture of the inside of my
thigh and my perineum.� It felt like
hundreds of refined pins of molten fire had been concentrated and then forced
into the tiniest part of my body.� I
bucked and screamed, but it didn't do any good.�
He lay on my belly and pinned my hips against the plank with his weight,
holding me almost motionless as he went about his horrific task.� Abruptly, the pressure on my belly was gone,
but the burning pain continued, even increasing as the shocked nerves that
hadn't been destroyed by his fire finally regained feeling.� It seemed that the branding iron stayed pressed into
my flesh for an eternity.� The initial
pain was tremendous as the few remaining nerve endings did their job.� Quickly though, the pain in the burned area
seemed to leave, probably since most of the nerves there were now dead.� But soon, an overall throbbing took over and
kept me in agony.� Finally he removed the towel from my face and he showed me what looked
like a small electric soldering iron.�
Barely able to see because of my tears, I raised my head as best I could
and found that the maniac had truly branded me.�
This suddenly scared me more than anything he had yet done.� 

&nbsp;

How bad could
it be? I'd naively asked myself.� I was a
fool, an idiot; and I deserved nothing less than what he had just done, even if
just to pay me back for my pathetic arrogance.�
The air smelled of burned meat, and with a sick stomach I realized that
it was my own flesh that I smelled.� The
heating iron had a small pattern worked into the flat head on the end, and it
was this design that had been permanently pressed so deeply into my skin.� 

&nbsp;

I felt myself
slipping in and out of consciousness.�
The stench of charred flesh in my nostrils was overpowering, but the man
standing over me barely noticed.� He just
opened the door to the outside and began ventilating the room.� My first reaction was to gulp desperately for
air, but the gag prevented that.� Then I
began to cry.� Not scream, not bellow,
but cry.� I have always handled pain
well; actually, I handle pain quite well.�
While it's a natural human tendency to scream at the infliction of
intense pain, I learned that night that once a single, intense sensation passed
a certain threshold, it was no longer within the cognitive scope of the human
nervous system or the brain; it simply became an ache that caused discomfort,
and most of the &quot;memory&quot; of the pain turned into shock.� 

&nbsp;

The only pain
now was in my head, the cognitive whiplash of finding myself in a situation so
far removed from that of only a few days ago.�
My mind was no longer in the place where it had been a few minutes
ago.� It was in a dark, foggy place where
normal functioning of the brain couldn't be carried out.� Somewhere deep inside this zone, I saw my
husband as I remembered him from the last time we had been together a couple of
nights ago.� I missed him terribly and
wished I could see him just one more time.�
I felt an immense regret; regret for the way I'd acted, for everything
I'd done to him and everything I hadn't.�


&nbsp;

Vaguely, I
heard sounds emanating from close by, but could barely make out the words.� The man who would be my Master looked
irritated at my lack of response, and he repeated his command more loudly,
&quot;Spread your knees.&quot;� 

&nbsp;

This time the
words were a little clearer, but their meaning still escaped me.� I shut my eyes tightly to preserve the image
of my husband, the only good thing left in my life.� It was an invitation to my assailant.� Leaning over impatiently, he slapped me on
the side of my face.� My eyes flew open
in surprise and I moved my head feebly towards what looked like a person
through the haze.� &quot;Spread your
knees wider!&quot;� 

&nbsp;

I couldn't spread any wider for him and he knew
it.� It was a cruel jest from a barbarous
monster.� He smiled as he held the branding iron about two inches from my face as
he said, �My property always comes marked with proof of ownership.�� I lay my head back down and continued crying
softly.� Even if he wasn't finished, I thought, I
was past the point of caring.� I let my
head fall back on the board and shut my eyes.�


&nbsp;

My husband was still there waiting for me. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Chapter 17: Women are an enslaved population
-- the crop we harvest is children, the fields we work are houses. Women are
forced into committing sexual acts with men that violate integrity because the
universal religion -- contempt for women -- has as its first commandment that
women exist purely as sexual fodder for men; Andrea� Dworkin.

&nbsp;

I looked down
at my beautiful little slave.� The
bloodless face, the nostrils spread wide as she panted for breath, the dilated
pupils; she was probably in light shock, and I didn't think she understood what
I'd just done to her.� Oh, she understood
the pain, but not the significance and certainly not the permanence.� Years from now when she, or any other person
for that matter, ran their hand between her legs, the small raised area of
patterned skin would always ensure that she understood the as yet unrealized
concept of property permanently owned.�
The extent of forced submission that this act implied hadn't really yet
begun to sink in.� Others would see it
however, and know immediately that another man had put his mark on her.� 

&nbsp;

No matter what
happened, no matter how hard she tried, she would never be able get away from
the permanent symbol of bondage that had been burned into her flesh this
night.� Only as I began to work with her
and on her in the near future, shaping her behavior and conditioning her body,
only then would she begin to understand the level of submission that was
required in her new life.� Finally,
suddenly, she would realize that only total compliance would bring her the
ability to survive what would be demanded of her.� Only total submission would allow her to live
up to, or down to, the permanent symbol I'd just given her.

&nbsp;

Mouth gagged
and wrists bound above her head, her feet strapped into stirrups attached to
the plank and chest tightly bound by straps, she lay helpless before me, chest
heaving as she tried to breathe through her nose.� The way she was bound only emphasized her
bust, and I needed that for the next step.�
Her beautiful nipples were raw from the clamps I'd already used on
her.� Using a soft milking motion, I
gathered one breast and stroked it several times before I made small marks with
a pen on each side a little more than an inch back from the nipple.� She watched with incomprehension as I then I
filled my hands with her other breast and made identical marks again.� 

&nbsp;

Now I put on a
pair of sterile gloves and then with a small cotton pad I washed both breasts
in a cold antiseptic---immediately her nipples became erect.� She looked at me in what could only be
mounting fear of what came next.� I
brought out the long sterile needle that would go from one side of her breast
to the other.� I didn't want to pierce
just her nipples.� I needed rather more
of her soft, beautiful� flesh for what I
had in mind.

&nbsp;

She still
didn�t understand my plan until I gathered up her left tit in my left hand and
held the long needle in my right.� Her
eyes bulged in horror and she began struggling.�
But it was too late for that; far too late.� With one smooth move I drove the needle
through Rebecca's breast from right to left so that the needle pointed out
towards her side.� Her pupils dilated
until her eyes were almost black as she stared first at me in shock, then at
her pierced breast. 

&nbsp;

Finally, it
came out and I was surprised at the intensity of her scream.� Rather, I was surprised at how loud her
scream was even through the gag.� There
was fear and more than a little humiliation.�
But mostly, there was rage.� Well,
I thought to myself.� We'll see if she
handles it better when I do the other one.�
The way I'd pierced her breast put the needle well back from the
aureole.� I knew that the female breast
should supposedly never be pierced anywhere but ON the nipple.� Well, that was not where I wanted this bitch
pierced because I had a lot of plans for how I would be using her tit
rings.� Besides, if something went wrong,
she was disposable.

&nbsp;

No change in
her reactions when I did the second breast.�
I have to say Rebecca was at least predictable in that she didn't seem
to care for my procedures at all.

&nbsp;

She was pierced
by two needles now, one through the milk-glands of each tit.� I went back to her right breast and pulled
the needle through, following the hole left behind the thick needle with a
straight golden bar that was threaded on both ends.� I had pierced the breast far enough back from
her nipple that the bar needed to be fully two inches long to satisfy my
needs.� A rather heavy horse-shoe shaped
ring went next, one that had a small loop on each end of the �C�.� After I hung this so that the horizontal bar
piercing her breast went through the loops on the ends of the �C�, I then
screwed small caps on the threaded tips on each end of piercing bar.� Liquid gold solder permanently welded each
cap to the bar, and ensured that Rebecca would never get these nipple rings off
by herself.� Her left breast quickly
assumed an identical look to the right, and I wiped both off with antiseptic
again when I was finished.� 

&nbsp;

To finish off
her new look, I used a old-fashioned looking purpose-made hand tool with
narrow, protruding jaws.� It looked like
something you'd use to punch a single tiny hole in paper---squeeze the handles
and you punched a hole at the tip of the jaws.�
I grabbed her hair with my left hand and pulled her head back.� Then I stuck the tool almost half an inch up
her nostrils, putting her nose cartilage between the tool's jaws---then I
squeezed.� As quickly as that, I had
punched through a small hole high up in her nasal septum.� By this time, Rebecca had begun screaming and
trying to thrash about; muted screams that rang of rage and frustration and
fear, but her eyes were watering so much that she couldn't see.� She tried to shake her head and turn her face
to the side, but couldn't.� Between my
handful of her hair and the crude tool that I'd used to pierce her nose, the
very same tool which still pinched her septum and kept it frozen in place, she
was helpless.� 

&nbsp;

Finally, I
removed the tool from inside her nose.�
Keeping a grip on her hair with my left hand, with my right I picked up
the nose ring that I'd chosen, easily sliding it through the hole in her nose
before I locked it.� It fit perfectly and
hung down in front just far enough above her upper lip to achieve an artful
symmetry with her freshly pierced breasts.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

God, this was a
nightmare, this couldn't be happening!�
My brain felt sluggish, like it was packed in cotton, but I knew exactly
what he'd just done to me.� He was
mutilating me!� I was in absolute terror
of this maniac and afraid to disobey; he was merciless and I was helpless.� God, what would he do next?� Every time I didn't give him exactly what he
wanted or obey him explicitly, he hurt me a lot.� Yet what had I gained by giving myself to
him?� I'd fucked him at the end as best I
could while I was on the plank, and I still hurt everywhere from where this man
had touched me.� 

&nbsp;

Leaving my
hands bound over my head, he removed the straps over my body before he unhooked
my feet from the stirrups that held them immobile.� He told me to turn over.� Not wanting to obey, I was still more fearful
of not obeying him, of getting extra lashed of the belt or tastes of the
prod.� Wearily, stiffly, with my back
screaming protests all the way, I rolled over.�
It hurt to lay on my breasts, he didn't care.� With quick, economical movements, he placed
my feet back in the stirrups and strapped them in tightly again.� Soon, it was done and I was helpless and trapped
once more.� 

&nbsp;

What he'd
already done left me filled with deep dread; I feared what might come next even
more, but I was also filled with pain.�
Every move he made maximized my helplessness and gave him even greater
advantage.� I lay on my stomach and my
breasts hurt; I was in pain from the cattle prod, the belt and the nipple
clamps, the branding and the piercings.�
Between the pain and the stiffness from being bound for so long, I knew
I could only obey for now.� But he
couldn't remain on guard forever and my time would come.

&nbsp;

Without a word,
he walked away for a second then returned to stand by my side.� Suddenly, I felt him spread my buttocks and
begin to push something huge inside me.�
My rectum had already been violated by his awful chair only a day ago; I
ached there all the time now and it was still terribly sore and tender---every
movement of my buttocks caused a new wave of throbbing pain.� But his new toy was lubricated, so no matter
how hard I struggled or bucked and clenched, my body quickly accepted the
massive object as sleekly and deeply as he desired.� In one smooth move, it felt like I was back
on his awful chair, but in another way it was totally different.� In any case, I couldn't move.� Soon, most of the awful pain went away and
all that was left was the massive discomfort caused by whatever he'd driven
inside me.

&nbsp;

He left and
I cried.� I am not a woman that cried
easily, but at this point I felt incredibly emotional, unable to control
myself.� Even as I continued to somehow
try and force myself to keep it inside, I wept incessantly; for myself and what
he'd just done to me, for my unknown future, for my sins, for everything that I
kept hidden from the world, for the wrongs done to me in the past and those I'd
done to others.� As emotionally
controlled as I normally was, my current inability to stop crying bewildered me
as I lay alone on my stomach for what seemed
another day; soaking in pain and immersed in humiliation at what he had so
nonchalantly just done to me.� That, I
suddenly realized, was what scared me the most.�
The absolute conviction on his part of his right to do this to me, and
of how little I was worth, of how little I counted in the grand scheme of
things.� The rage and anger were long
gone; now I was scared and feeling sorry for myself.� 

&nbsp;

Time
passed.� It was still dark out; no light
entered the room from the small glass rectangles set so high in the wall.� I lay on my stomach with my arms tied above
my head and my face turned towards my right shoulder.� There was little other lighting and it was
difficult to see.� But even though I
couldn't see him, suddenly I knew he was there.�
I stiffened as I felt his eyes on the back of my neck.� Men had been looking at me since I turned
fifteen; I knew the feeling.� Abruptly,
he was beside me again.� I couldn't see
him at first, but I could sense his presence.�
Without a word, he walked around into my line of sight and my heart
sank...it was obvious that he wanted me again.�
What he did to me now was as bad as anything anyone had ever done
before.� Slowly he removed the plug he
had left inside me earlier, somehow twisting it as he pulled on it in a way
that made me feel like he was unscrewing it from my body.� 

&nbsp;

I stirred,
tried to move my arms and legs, but I felt as if I'd blundered into a tar pit
and had sunk to the bottom.� Finally, he
had it out.� I struggled and tried to
scream, but even if I hadn't been gagged, every movement met an avalanche of warm
tar, stifling, smothering.� Another
touch.� A man's coarse hand moving over
the back of my calf, my thigh.� All part
of a nightmare, I prayed.� There was
nothing real here, only memories dredged up from the cellar of my mind.� I willed myself into another world, where
women were safe from creatures like this man.�


&nbsp;

This must be a
dream.� But it was not!� I desperately wanted to fight him, but I
lacked the strength and bravery.� Hauling
in a lungful of air through my nose, I tried to scream myself awake, to burst
through the curtain of sleep into the clear air of reality.� But I could only croak and whimper.� I felt the moist heat of his breath on my
neck.� I felt his hands on my hips
pulling me towards him, then the dribble of something cold on the crack between
my cheeks.� His hand smoothed it around
and I could feel it pooling it near my anus.�


&nbsp;

There was no
anger; the thought of what I knew would come next just froze me---I was filled
with the kind of helpless dread that I knew a small animal must feel when it
cowered in its burrow as a predator begin to dig it out.� I fought to prevent my mind from just
shutting down.� I wanted to cry and
scream through my gag, begging for his mercy, telling him that I was worthy as
a person, a woman, a human being.� But
the tar filled me and kept me silent.�
And I knew he would never stop.� Please, please be gentle, I begged in my mind.� But he couldn't hear me, he was spreading my
cheeks, getting ready to rape me from behind. 

&nbsp;

He started talking to
me.� &quot;You've got no choice in
this.� I've taken a lot of women this way
and it's always the same the first time.�
It's going to happen, and there'll be no problem if you'll just
relax.� When you feel me starting to open
up your ass, try to push out like you are passing gas,&quot; he laughed.
&quot;And I'll pop right in.� I promise I
won't hurt you too much and I definitely won't hurt you on purpose if you
cooperate and fuck me back.�� I knew it
must be someone else he was talking to, but I somehow nodded and braced for the
anal invasion.

&nbsp;

Even though
Master would probably later say that he was gentle that first time, he took me
brutally; a quick, almost stealthy entry that overwhelmed my obviously
beaten-down and now inadequate defenses.�
He began to enter me and as he did, I shrieked loudly enough to shatter
glass, Oh God, easy, please stop, no, No, NO, I CAN'T, but only in my mind.� Filled with
tar, my mouth could only give out a low moan.�
But he could feel me shudder and
he stopped pushing.� 

&nbsp;

His voice told me he was
losing his patience a little.� &quot;It's
going to happen, woman, just cooperate and I won't hurt you too much.� Push back, try to push me out with your
ass.�� With no way to fight him, I tried
to strain as he'd ordered and suddenly felt my sphincter pop open.� I braced for him to ram himself up my rectum,
but instead, he surprised me by remaining motionless for a few seconds.� 

&nbsp;

Oh, oohh, wait, please
wait, I'll cooperate if you'll just wait, I begged him in my mind.� But he never heard me as he began to make
little push-pull movements.� I could feel
my anus spreading and closing for him as he penetrated me and then pulled out
again just a little.� Not giving me time to fully accommodate his manhood, his initial assault
was followed immediately by short, driving moves of his hips that ensured only
shallow penetrations at first.� At first
I'd thought he was trying to get me ready, trying to warm me up.� But it hurt every time he opened me a little
and I think he was torturing me.

&nbsp;

But eventually,
he seemed to lose patience with any attempts at finesse and began to thrust
deeper and deeper; absolutely guaranteeing that each succeeding drive ripped
more and more virgin flesh as his engorged penis probed my bowels more deeply
than the previous one.� Finally he was
completely buried inside me and I was in agony.�


&nbsp;

He was so strong in his
need to take me this way.� The pain was
tremendous, so much more different than the chair.� It was like a terrible and overwhelming, yet
living force had possessed my body, a force that was associated with a pain
remotely unlike anything I'd ever imagined.�
He stayed a long time, pumping, grunting,
groaning; his breath coming in puffs on the back of my neck when he wasn't
biting me.� It felt as he was trying to
shove a refrigerator inside me.� My screams
of protest and cries for release were ignored.�
Somewhere during this seeming eternity, my mind switched off and I
plunged into nothingness.

&nbsp;

Even as a
stupid rebellious teenager in my wildest years of debauchery and rebellion, I
knew I would have never submitted willingly to what he did to me tonight.� And now I had no choice.� It went on and on, but finally he was
finished and for the first time in my life, I knew what it was like to have a
man's hot semen ejaculated deep inside my rectum.� 

&nbsp;

When he was
finished, he left without a word.� I hurt
terribly where he had been, but the pain slowly lessened.� I had been raped and sodomized, and knew I
was suffering the early symptoms of shock.�
But I tried to be strong, fighting to keep my tears under control.� He was back within a couple of minutes and
was carrying the camera again.� He showed
it to me without a word; I started crying again when I saw the look on my face
as he sodomized me on-screen.� Then he
put the camera down and showed me the thick,
two-inch wide leather belt he'd already used on my breasts.� He stood over
me and let me see the belt.� He dragged
it lightly over my back and then my cheeks.�
He told me how much he hated to have to punish me, then he hit me
lightly with it once, after which he dragged it over my buttocks again.� 

&nbsp;

I begged him
for mercy through my gag, but there still was none for me in the room that
night.� He played with me at first, but
then finally, he it started for real.� He
began to hit me with the belt on my buttocks, the back of my thighs and my
lower back.� Suddenly, somehow, the rape
and sodomy wasn't the worst that night.�
I went berserk for a minute as I struggled against my bonds, but it did
no good.� I was filled with an
incomprehensible anger which he quickly whipped into embarrassment and
humiliation, and then finally, submission.�


&nbsp;

I was
overwhelmed by a sense of the sheer unfairness of it all; what he'd just done
to me and what he did to me now.� My
humiliation seemed to linger forever as he treated me like a small, worthless
child.� Just as the greatest bonfires
need continually more fuel for the flames or they expire, my emotions burned
themselves out and all that was eventually left behind was the weak shell of a
beaten woman tied to a wooden plank.� 

&nbsp;

The beating
went on and on, seemingly forever, and he was breathing heavily when he
finished spanking me.� When he had caught
his breath, he said, �You belong to me.�
You're not an ass-virgin anymore and your performance was unacceptable.� You're going to be an ass-toy.� You'll learn to enjoy it or learn to
pretend.� I don't care which.� But this is going to be a major part of your
life now.� And when I fuck you or give
you to another ass-fucker for a couple of hours, you'll take it with a smile
and a moan of pleasure, whether its once a night or ten times a night, every
time like a seasoned ass-whore.� I won't
put up with a bitch like you that won't take it in the ass.� I promise I'll beat the hell out you every
time you perform like you just did, until you learn to act like a true
ass-slut.�

&nbsp;

Nothing he said
made sense to me.� I could barely hear
him as I cried, but my sobbing finally slowed down to the point where I could
breathe through the gag again.� I was
sore from the chair and ached from the recent sodomy.� My back, buttocks and thighs ached and
burned.� The burned area on the inside of
my thigh was a distant ache now compared to my buttocks, and the throbbing of
my breasts and nose couldn't begin to compare with the rest of my pains.� I felt awful---everywhere.� Later, much later when I had time to think, I
realized that the physical assaults on my body, however much pleasure he may
have derived from them, were actually only the initial stages of his
psychological onslaught.� But this
realization did not, could not help me resist him.� 

&nbsp;

I passed out.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Chapter 18: I seemed to have attracted
everyone whose intentions were not the best; Sandra Bullock.

&nbsp;

I found myself
in a battle for awareness, a battle against a tsunami of smothering black
feathers.� Somewhere in the distance, I
heard blues music.� I forced my eyes
open; it was early morning and gray was changing to light.� My third day---or was it the fourth?� I saw only traces of blood red and blue,
pinpricks of electric light like on amplifiers and stereo equipment.� I became conscious too of the pain in my
wrists and arms.� I realized that I was
still bound on my stomach to the hard plank that rested at a forty-five degree
angle from the floor.� And I was still
naked.� I couldn't stop shivering.

&nbsp;

Suddenly, I
wasn't alone.� Someone or something had
moved close to me.� I could feel his body
heat.� I struggled against the bonds to
get free, but they held as surely as if made of steel.� In the dark someone breathed on me, and I
screamed, but only in my mind.�
Eventually, a lifetime later, he took me a second time that way.� This was the most humiliating of all, because
he didn't cum inside me this time.�
Instead, he began urinating at the end, leaving me filled with his
scalding amber liquid as he slowly pulled out.�
This burned and stung where it came in contact with my ripped flesh.� Finally, after a few quick movements of hand
and wrist, he then came on my back.� 

&nbsp;

I wanted to beg
him to kill me, but I knew he'd just laugh at my pathetic request.� Even though he hurt me terribly and I'd
honestly tried to please him this time, he still was not satisfied with how I
looked on camera and he beat me again.�
When he was finished with me this time, he hosed me down again like you
would when you were washing your car.�
Impersonally, professionally, business-like, as you made sure you got every
spot of dirt.� I consider myself a tough
person, but I cried myself into a light sleep afterwards as I lay face-down on
his plank.� All day long I porpoised into
a heightened awareness filled with fear and then back to
semi-unconsciousness.� 

&nbsp;

That evening,
after cautioning me not to speak, he removed my gag and allowed me a sip from
his squeeze bottle.� Then he gave me some
warm soup through a straw.� He asked if I
finally understood what he demanded from me, and I nodded my head
silently.� Total submission.� Docility.�
The tranquility of one who has lost everything, willingly given up
everything.� How bad could it be?� I couldn't take anymore punishment, not right
now.� My eyes flooded with tears as I
nodded my recently acquired willingness to cooperate with his needs and
desires.� 

&nbsp;

He put on a
hood over his head.� And when he took me
a third time this way, I think that I finally understood what he wanted, and
God save me, as much as he hurt me, and he hurt me a lot, I tried my best to
give it to him. �Perhaps I succeeded,
because he didn't beat me afterwards.�
These were my first lessons in how cooperation with satisfying my
Master�s needs led to being rewarded.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I took Rebecca
hard when I pounded her ass the third time.�
There was no artifice between us now.�
She was exactly what she seemed; a previously powerful and dangerous
woman in a hopeless situation; a strong woman only down for the moment.� Even though I controlled her for now, I still
could see the great danger that lay in her eyes; we were enemies to the death
in her current state and she knew it now.�
The thing was, I wasn't planning on allowing her that kind of spirit for
too much longer.� She had been strong and
arrogant, allowed to dominate others for far too long.� But things were different now, and she needed
to be taught humility the hard way.� The
best part was that it was so damned enjoyable for me.� 

&nbsp;

At the end, I
was making large circular motions with my hips and I ripped her good.� She was almost a parody of cooperation.� Even tied as she was, she tried to lift her
buttocks up to meet each thrust---anything to please me.� The lighting was strong enough that I could
look down and see a thin film of red around the base of my cock.� It was her blood; I knew I'd torn her
somewhere.� As much as I knew I hurt
Rebecca then, she still managed to give a false squeak of delight at the end
that rather pleased me.� And the way she
responded throughout gave me some hope that this was a woman that could
actually learn to like it this way.� Surely,
for the most part it was an act for the camera, for you can't re-train the
habits of a lifetime over-night.� But I
would bet my life that there were undercurrents of truth too as she faked
delight for what I did to her on-screen.�


&nbsp;

I smiled and
re-ran certain parts of her performance over and over again, appreciating the
look on her face and in her eyes as she did her best to writhe with enthusiasm
on my pole that was buried up her rear end.�
The look on her face as I came in her ass that third time gave me
indescribable pleasure.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

He made me
rollover so that I lay on my back again.�
After the ordeal of today, I was exhausted and my mind buzzed
incoherently from sleep-deprivation.� I'm
sure that this was what this maniac wanted by leaving me on the angled piece of
wood.� After what must have been about an
hour, I awoke with a start.� My lower
back was in agony now.� I listened intently.� There was no sound in the room except for the
irregular thumping of my heart.� I hurt
all over.� I was sore in many, many more
places than I remember him hurting me, and there were particularly throbbing
aches between my legs and in my breasts.�
My rear-end stung and ached no matter what I did---he had done to me
multiple times what I had never before allowed ANY man to do.� I had hated the whole idea of anal sex as far
back as I could remember.� I�d always
felt it was dirty and knew now that it was terribly painful too.� Being taken like that, especially against
your will is degrading and humiliating; good only for the sexually
perverted.� 

&nbsp;

How bad could it be, I had asked myself?�
As I glanced down for the first time and really looked at the golden
rings that now pierced my flesh, powerful fear gripped me and tears slowly
leaked from my eyes.� I had thought I was
so smart; but he had never once allowed me a chance to fight him in any
meaningful way.� I realized suddenly that
I was afraid in a way that I never had been before.� It wasn't simply the fear of being held
captive and tortured, it was the fear of a life lived aggressively and perhaps
even poorly, but lived to the full nonetheless and now coming to a shattering
halt.� I moved slowly, as if any sudden
movements would injure me.� I lay like
that for awhile, not at all sure of what my thoughts were, just acutely aware
of a profound dread that seemed to originate deep inside me.� I tried to touch my chest and failed.� Was I having a heart attack?� 

&nbsp;

Even as my
momentary panic subsided, depression started to set in.� It was slow at first, excessively
sweet---almost like saccharine.� Then it
began to burgeon, undulating in circular waves around my mind in ever-widening
orbs.� My mind was trying to handle the
rapes and sodomy and absent freedom as best it could.� I could feel my thoughts, my emotions,
getting eclipsed by feelings of numbness that was mixed with an overpowering
sensation of dismay.� 

&nbsp;

Although I knew
that depression was only a time-expanded form of panic, I was powerless to stop
it.� Inexorably, the most insidious
killer known to man drew its tentacles around me, and the old, familiar feeling
of falling---which I so detested in my dreams----gripped me like a fever.� I clamped my ankles even harder upon the
rough edges of the plank on which I lay bound.�
But the ground slipped away from beneath me anyway and the walls receded
into the distance.� The room was swirling
around me in a cocktail of colors, mocking me and my lack of strength and lack
of control.� The room and the world no
longer respected me.� I wanted to die
rather than face what this man had planned for me.� At least in death, there was nothing but
honesty.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

Finally, he
came back in and released me from the plank.�
He left my wrists cuffed together and the gag in my mouth.� My back and hips hurt too badly to try to
move in any coordinated fashion, I could barely walk even as he dragged
me.� My bottom ached with each move I
made.� Now he grabbed my left bicep and
pulled me over to a spot near the wall at the foot of what I had assumed would
be my bed.� Instead, he lightly kicked me
behind my knees and my legs collapsed.�
He guided me down to the floor as I fell and ensured that I didn�t fall
too hard.� Finally, he clipped the chain
of my handcuffs to a D-ring mounted low on the wall and stood up.� Walking to the bed, he pulled off the thin blanket
there and draped it over me.� Now he
looked down at me for a moment, then he turned and left.� At the door that led to his bedroom, he
turned and switched the light off leaving me in total darkness.� 

&nbsp;

I couldn�t make out his features as he stopped; he was a
silhouette standing in the rectangle of light. �Everything you've experienced
represents the beginning of discipline in your new life.� Some things are best accomplished in the
dark.....think about your life and the things you�ve done. �

&nbsp;

He waited in silence for a second, then continued.� �I've been around and seen some shit in my
life.� I think that life somehow stores
up what each of us does, keeps track somehow.�
And when you reach a certain point, there's an accounting due; you have
to pay something back into the system.�
Some call it fate, others karma.�
Think about what I might do to you, but even more, think about what
you've earned over the last twelve or fifteen years.� Think about the people you've used and the
people you've hurt.� You're a cunt, and
you KNOW you are.� Nothing for you can be
too extreme or undeserved.� And that�s
the best part for me; every time you feel the need to cry or scream or beg,
you�ll know that you�ve earned everything being done to you.� Tomorrow, we�ll go over the rules.�� The door began to close and the rectangle
grew small before it winked out.� There
was the sound of a door being locked and suddenly I was alone with my thoughts
in the blackness.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Chapter 19: This is the first time in the
entire world that women have the freedom to do the things that we can do.� And still, you know, in the Middle East and a
lot of parts of the world, women aren't free yet; Linda Evans.

&nbsp;

I locked the door and walked into my bedroom carrying the
pitifully small bag that now represented her previous life.� Oddly, I felt an indescribable mix of
emotions; excitement, fear, destiny, a sense of confronting the unknown. In our
lifestyle, non-consensuality is always
the essence of extreme trust and understanding, undertaken only by partners who
know each other well and who agree to set absolutely clear limits on their
activities.� But I was breaking those
unwritten rules wholesale.� Rebecca was
uninitiated and while the extremes that she seemed to willingly accept in her
normal life went far beyond that of most women, she had to sense by now that
there were no limits for me in this.

&nbsp;

To me, the world is divided into five types of women: sluts that I
fuck; nice girls who in bed turn into sluts (these girls I fuck with pleasure);
nice girls who remain nice in bed (these I usually left for the mundanes, because even civilians need to get laid too).� And while most of the wives that I forced
into my bed were good women that desperately wished to remain this way for
their emotional and marital health, I consistently forced them into accepting
more than they�d ever dreamed existed in their pathetic little vanilla worlds,
riding them against their wishes straight into previously unknown levels of
slut whoredom.� And then there was my
mother.

&nbsp;

I was older now and wanted something different; I'd always wanted
a woman with whom I could take my time and shape into what I considered the
perfect partner---even if only temporarily.�
I didn�t want this woman for her intellectual companionship, but at the
same time, I didn�t want a Stepford wife either.� I wanted a real woman that was turned on by
absolute servility---no matter where it took her.� She had to be beautiful, but also
intelligent; one who would not bore me too quickly.� At the same time, I was tired of hiding my
true nature---she had to be strong enough to be servile and yet have many of
the same desires as I, except hers must be polar opposites to mine---black to
my white, yin to my yang, ice to my fire.�
And because of this, even if Rebecca wasn�t yet aware of it, if she was
as I thought she was, in the end she would be the kind of woman who would want to respond to my every need.� 

&nbsp;

I'd have to hurt her in the beginning of her training, perhaps a
lot.� Would I be able to get Rebecca to
trust me after that?� Maybe, maybe
not.� It was possible, if I could hide
for long enough my true nature and the ultimate destination I had planned for
us both.� Trust leads to intimacy, and
while both are essential within any long-term relationship, they were also what
I personally found to be the most difficult.�
Most civilians aren't don't know this, but these things are just as
important or even more important in BDSM as for mundanes, since ours is a negotiated lifestyle in which wishes,
limits and needs are discussed, with both seeking unity.� But we didn't have this commonality of goal,
Rebecca and I; ours instead was a coercive relationship.� There was no communication or trust between
us even as I prepared her for a new lifestyle, one into which she'd been
coerced.

&nbsp;

Now I had Rebecca; but what had she felt when she delivered
herself into my hands?�� She was cowed
for the moment, but what was she feeling now?�
What would she feel in a day or two?�
I'd raped and sodomized her, branded and tortured her.� When a person underwent powerful stress, the
defense mechanisms used by the mind must be equally strong.� When a strong woman like Rebecca was
subjected to extreme tension and strain, potent psychological mechanisms were evoked
in an attempt to cope with this stress.�
But this presumed she would be allowed time to reintegrate her psyche
without additional stressors.� And I
wasn't going to do this.� 

&nbsp;

I didn�t know if her recent capitulation was the act of a person
that had truly repented of her wicked deeds and knew that she had earned some
kind of punishment; or was it just the attempt of a weak woman to temporarily
put off confronting the police and her own immorality.� Perhaps it was just a pitiful attempt to get
out of the rain?� I didn�t yet know, but
I knew I would find out over time.� 

&nbsp;

I smiled to myself; oh yes,
she would learn to trust me again; and over time I would get to know this woman
very well, some might even say intimately and in extreme detail.

&nbsp;

I was tired and I wanted to lie down, but even days later after I
had washed the sheets, my bed still smelled of Rebecca�s perfume and our
private moments; instances of tangled legs and intense pleasure.� I didn�t think of her in that way anymore
since the woman in my playroom was now something that needed to be tamed and
humbled, her various levels of submission explored in great detail.� I went into my study instead and it was there
that I spent a sleepless night thinking about what I would do to the beauty
that I now possessed.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I leaned
against the wall and cried.� God, how I�d
fucked my life up.� How could it ever
have come to this?� I was an abandoned
daughter and discarded wife, a woman in disgrace.� I had nothing of substance left in my life.

&nbsp;

Exhausted, I
pulled my feet under me as best I could and huddled beneath the blanket in an
attempt to get some sleep.� I fretted
about what now seemed like small things.�
I had been gagged for a long time and although my jaws ached, I ignored
the pain for this was the least of my problems.�
I was still cold, but not as cold as if I were still outdoors.� I hoped that I didn�t get sick.� But finally I begin to feel a little warmer
and eventually dozed off.� I slept
lightly, still surfing in and out of consciousness. 

&nbsp;

I dreamed,
pictures forming in my imagination.� I
saw myself encased in ice, then heard the hissing crackles as fissures formed
in the block.� Water dripped as the
melting progressed, revealing who I truly was.�
Another person entirely, one who hated herself too.

&nbsp;

Suddenly the
door opened and I was awake again, sitting on the floor.� I shut my eyes against the assault as the
room blazed to light.� My mind seemed
leaden; I was filled with a formless, helpless terror of what the future would
bring me.� I looked down and saw my phone
lying beside me in two pieces.� It had
originally been in my purse, but he must have gone through it during the night
and left the phone here for me to see.� I
couldn't remember the last time I wasn't in reach of a cell phone, a text pager
or email.� Even if I were unbound, I had
no way of telling anyone where I was.

&nbsp;

The message
was clear---no communication with anyone but him.� Dawn was just beginning to lighten as the
owner of the house walked into the room with something in his hand.� He told me his name was Christian�but I knew
in my heart that his true name really didn�t matter anymore.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Chapter 20: There is only one success: to
be able to spend your life in your own way, and not to give others absurd
maddening claims upon it; Christopher Darlington Morley.

&nbsp;

Human beings have throughout history shared with many other
animals the instinct to follow or submit to others because of sheer strength of
will and personality.� Similarly, others
also have chosen to follow or submit because of their own character.� Dominance
and submission---inner conflict
and surrender--- these concepts were inter-connected and enduring ideas in
our culture and civilization, as well as in our sexuality.� 

&nbsp;

I wanted more than sex from this woman, but exactly what
else?� How could I combine her imprisonment
with being a willing slave?� Falling in
love with your captor: The Sabine women and their Roman captors.� Patty Hearst.�
Stockholm syndrome.� Others.� The most important part here was to make her want to be my slave.� 

&nbsp;

Or perhaps go the other way?�
The way that an entrepreneur does when he takes an independent whore off
the street; no matter how tough or strong she might be in the beginning, when
her one or two-day training period was over, she was docile, obedient and
tremblingly eager to please.

&nbsp;

I made a mental review as I thought about Rebecca; the
physiological and psychological effects of submission and their evolutionary
origins have long been known.� I knew
that even though I was capable of it, I did not necessarily want to beat her
into total submission.� I would rather
use her mind as my willing or unwilling accomplice.� At the same time, I was perfectly aware that
continued and overwhelming violence would be necessary early on in her
training, even if just to give her the necessary experience in which to frame
her new life.� But I needed to keep it
generally at a low enough level that it would �get her attention,� so to speak, yet at the same time wouldn't risk
of turning her into a robot.� 

&nbsp;

Women governed by men of intelligence often learned a hard lesson;
with a strong man, logic can't be manipulated by looks.� I wasn't going to allow her that type of
encounter again.�� Instead, I'd turned
her world upside down.� I wanted her to
feel frozen in disbelief at what she'd undergone.� I needed to separate her from her previous
life, leave her feeling forever unable to reconnect with the woman who'd
existed before the rape.� I wanted her to
feel humiliated, confused, dirty, ashamed; knowing that in many ways she was
much at fault for what had been done to her---and totally disconnected from her
emotions, at least in the beginning.� 

&nbsp;

At the same time, I put my faith in psychology and the flexibility
of the human mind when it went into extreme survival mode; knowing that people
somehow tended to connect with their captors when placed in unyielding
environments like I had made sure that Rebecca knew she faced.� And women tended to do this more than
males---perhaps due to some primitive evolutionary upside of trying to ensure
that their physically stronger captors bonded with them and kept them
alive?� 

&nbsp;

I'd done awful things to
this woman and we both knew that more was coming; she was a victim and to her
everything had swirled out of control.�
Humans will go quite far to avoid such a feeling--including, at times,
artificially modifying the situation---lying to themselves---in order to decide
that the aggressor was not so bad after all; maybe even good.� Of course, brainwashing can play a role in
that transformation, especially if the kidnapping goes on for a long time. But
sometimes, it doesn't take all that much, and overt brainwashing was not
necessarily a significant part of the process.�


&nbsp;

The outer facade she'd
presented to others had been important to her.�
But Rebecca didn't understand that no matter how much effort she'd put
into her image, it was all a fraud psychologically speaking, because so much of
her life revolved around the unconscious.�
Although developing a social identity like being a teacher had a certain
short-term value, whatever she �thought� she was, was ultimately nothing
but a vague approximation of what she really was.� And she would eventually reveal to me who she
really was in discrete moments of genuine encounter in our new life together.� All I had to do was be perceptive enough to
observe the real Rebecca when she offered me her innermost secrets.

&nbsp;

A beautiful woman like
Rebecca took her persona and individuality for granted.� She'd been shaped by the way she'd learned to
make her way through life; controlling men and ignoring women, being treated
like a princess on a pedestal.� As long
as she derived her identity from the world around her, she also had to be
concerned about losing it.� If word had
gotten out about her behavior while she'd been free, like a dragon sitting greedily
on its hoard of treasure, her entire being would have been caught up defending
what she was most afraid to lose.� But I
had her instead.

&nbsp;

There was a psychological phenomenon known as &quot;identification
with the aggressor,&quot; something which was different from the &quot;Stockholm
Syndrome�.� This was a form of
survival behavior in which the victim responded to the threat and fear of
injury or death.� She became &quot;grateful&quot;
not to be severely injured or killed by her captor, and in fact often ended up
believing that her captor was the only one that could protect her.� Therefore, she did whatever she was told to
do in a very compliant manner, sometimes even to the point of ignoring an
opportunity to escape for fear of losing her captor's protection.

&nbsp;

Carried to the extreme, throughout history it has been documented
that subjects kidnapped and kept imprisoned for a certain length of time tended
to readily bond with their captors and to even fall in love with them.� Not always, for humans are individuals---but
often enough.� It wasn�t romance that I
wanted, but rather breaking her to my will and forcing her to care for
me despite how she might initially feel.�
Were these contradictory goals possible?�
I hoped so.� At the same time, I
wanted to make her acknowledge her need for pain and her extraordinary ability
to handle it.� 

&nbsp;

Getting her to submit psychologically to me as well as physically
was just a means to and end; was this what I really wanted I asked myself?� And my answer was�..yes.� If humbling and pacifying her, then making
her want what I could give her; if this was my goal, I had to hope that the
physiological and psychological effects of her captivity would trump her
intellect and will.� At the same time, if
it turned out in the end that I had chosen poorly or was over-confident in my
abilities to control her, the hard-edged beast within me knew that I could
discard her with little fear or repercussion. 

&nbsp;

For a second, the fact that I so casually assumed that she was
disposable shook me.� She and I lived in
a new world, a world very different from the south I had grown up in
thirty-five or forty years ago.� That had
been a time when people still darned their socks.� I'd even learned how to do it.� Then suddenly one day it was over.� Socks with holes were discarded.� The whole society changed.� �Wear it, use, toss it out,� was the
only rule that applied.� As long as it
had only been socks, it hadn't really mattered.�
But then it spread, becoming some kind of invisible moral code.� It changed our view of right and wrong, what
you were allowed to do to one another and what you weren't.� More and more people grew up this way, with
no memory of darning their socks; and how did they react?� With aggression and contempt.� And I included myself in this.� They had no memory of darning their socks;
when we didn't throw everything away, including people like this woman.� But you know what?� It didn't matter anymore.

&nbsp;

Rebecca hated and feared me right now.� I understood this; I accepted it as a
given.� But regardless of what you've
read of my treatment of her so far and of what we both know must yet come;
despite what you as the reader feel must be the outcome---what her
feelings MUST have been towards me---I tell you that it was still not
too late for me to convince her, to manipulate her into willingly putting her
life into my hands. 

&nbsp;

The human mind was an incredible instrument, capable of amazing
things.� It could make sense out of utter
chaos, protect the organism from killing stress and filter actuality after the
fact, creating fiction from reality.� It
could remove pain and disappointment, blotting them from our memories, allowing
only relief and pleasant memories to remain.�
It had the ability to heal itself, making one forget a little---or
everything ugly that might have happened.�
It could create new truths, ones that incorporated the current reality,
but interpreted it in a way more favorably, as a necessity for survival.� It could do any of these things---or all of
them, depending upon what the monkey hidden deeply inside might require for
continued existence.� 

&nbsp;

Yet as powerful as the mind was, it could still be manipulated if
you absolutely controlled the environment and knew what you were doing.� I did and I did.

&nbsp;

Humans can be unpredictable, but given enough knowledge, most
actions have predictable reactions.� I
had learned everything possible about this woman and knowing her nature as I
did, she wouldn't be able to help herself as she inevitable reacted in very
predictable ways to my training stimuli.�
And even if she were to become aware that everything I did had as an
ultimate goal making her existence as my slave seem desirable, this knowledge
would only work to my advantage.� There
is no more helpless feeling in the world than having someone continually manipulate
you and your environment and correctly predict your behavior; ultimately
shaping your very nature against your will towards behaving in a way that was
pleasing to another.� I'd seen it done it
to others; I'd done it to others.

&nbsp;

She would, in the end, still be mine.

&nbsp;

We were both fucked up.�
Intellectually, I knew exactly what I was doing.� But maintaining control of the deep seated
urge to both dominate and hurt her beyond what was necessary took all
the training that I had.� Instead, I
needed to dole out my urges in dabs and dollops according to her training
schedule---and her ability to heal.� I
already knew, and she was unconsciously learning in the most basic and
primitive ways, that she could accept huge amounts of pain and perhaps
eventually learn to even like it.� On the
flip side of that same coin, she was also in the very first stages of becoming
aware of her submissive side, the part inside that eventually enjoy
incorporating pain into her fantasies.� 

&nbsp;

I also knew that even as she'd hidden her true nature by
pretending to a certain �normality� within
the public community, she had also experimented both with using pain to amplify
her sexual gratification and in breaking accepted cultural norms.� Further, even while she had acted as a
natural Alpha for years, within her character there lurked a powerfully
seductive submissive side which she only infrequently indulged---and it was
this part that most enjoyed incorporating the heightened physical sensations of
pain into her sexual fantasies.� 

&nbsp;

When prompted by circumstances such as I planned next for Rebecca,
hormones were released into the blood of the female captive which produced a
state approaching euphoria, and this artificial emotion was almost always
associated with the person in control. �In her particular situation, fear and love
would be almost indistinguishable.� If I
was successful, she would instinctually feel the need to turn to me over the
next few weeks and months as the only Dominant male available to satisfy her
emotional and psychological needs.� And
while much of the initial attraction could then be morphed to a deepening
passion, I knew that it would still be hormonal and not based on true
affection---for her it would be nothing more than the lizard-brain attempting
to survive in a difficult situation at the most basic physiological level---and
this was okay too, because I could still use this against her.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

When a Dominant and submissive pair off, the feelings seem to be
generally stronger and more intense on the part of the submissive---this I
guess because of the very nature of the role that the Sub has accepted.� It was weird; I wanted this woman to need me,
but I had no intention of forming a sincere reciprocal relationship as her Top---I
had taken her against her will and desired only what power over her could give
me.� Was this the nature of all
dominants---or the flaw in just me that had always before prevented any kind of
a meaningful relationship?� 

&nbsp;

Two things were required for her to permanently submit as the
bottom in our relationship; she had to sincerely desire this, seeing it as
truly best representing her needs, and she had to see me as being worthy of her
sacrifice, worthy of giving up her freedom and previous existence.� I needed to carefully shape her behavior over
time towards my ultimate goals.� Could I
discover what she needed to see in me and then pretend to this worthiness long
enough to justify in her mind the desirability of permanent change?� This was a smart woman; would she eventually
see the one-sided nature of the relationship I offered and finally forced her
to accept?� At the same time, if I
manipulated Rebecca psychologically in order to satisfy her, and my, emotional
needs, would it even matter?

&nbsp;

She was a strong woman
that had recently undergone a string of serious emotional disasters; but even
beaten down as she was, I had no doubt Rebecca would at first fight me.� And frankly, I relished the coming battles
with this female.� Some Subs quickly
embraced the existence they faced.� But
just as often, uninitiated or unbroken bottoms like Rebecca resisted this
initial dance, hesitantly dipping only their toes into what seem the frigid
waters of a new life, fighting the very things that on the inside they most
desired in their unconscious.� But in the
end, the dominants could usually penetrate the flimsy lies these Subs told
themselves, overcoming the fragile psychological barricades behind which they
hid.� 

&nbsp;

Strangely, their defeat
was almost always psychologically based and occurred with their willful,
although sometimes unknowing assistance---for even if they couldn't admit it
openly, at the deepest emotional levels, even the most uninitiated players
always knew exactly what they were missing.�
This woman was anything but weak, but in the end I was betting she would
recognize what she most needed; the disciplined structure that a caring Master
could provide.� But the honest truth was
that while I knew I was controlling and needy and full of desire, I also had to
admit that I wasn�t particularly worthy or really willing to care for her at
this point.

&nbsp;

I had recognized Rebecca�s passive/aggressive, submissive/dominant
duality---but I doubted if she herself was truly aware of how deeply submerged
she kept these desires.� Clearly, she was
at her most susceptible now, questioning all of her previous life assumptions
and sexuality.� But was she sufficiently
vulnerable?� Was Rebecca psychologically
beaten down to the point where she would be malleable enough----fragile enough
to allow me to peel away the flawed, yet substantial armor she'd developed over
the last twenty-five years?� Would she
allow me to act as her guide as I re-made her into the vessel that I knew we
both desired at our most basic levels...help her find the beauty among the
ugliness of her soul?�� Or did I need to
take her a little farther down the road towards the total destruction of her
ego?� 

&nbsp;

What mundanes can�t
appreciate are the depths plumbed and the heights scaled in a BDSM relationship
that truly works.� Even if it was a
mistake, I was willing to take complete accountability for her.� I certainly didn�t love this woman, but I
absolutely wanted to dominate her.� My
desires regarding Rebecca had nothing to do with the foolish concepts of love
in any shape or form; even the much weaker concept of affection was
absent.� I didn't yet know what love
meant.� Love to me at this point was a
scary, yet somehow trivial word that defined how �citizens� and the
�vanilla-people� looked at their relationships.� I was suspicious of the word.� In songs and television commercials, it was a
slippery, deceitful word---used by what could only be described as drones---so what could it ever mean to
me?

&nbsp;

Instead I wondered; when she beaten down enough that when my task
was complete and Rebecca was where I wanted her, would she would submit forever
to the one that she saw as capable of protecting her physically and supporting
her emotionally?� For a subservient woman
isolated forever in that position, even falsely given support would be better
than nothing at all.� I didn�t know and
really didn�t care about those other facets of this woman, except in the ways
that each might give me leverage over her.� 

&nbsp;

All of this of course, I thought to myself, presumed mental
health.� I knew that Rebecca had
significant emotional issues; and in this we were alike.� I wondered how damaged she was, and how much
more damaging it would be to her psyche when she was forced to accept a new role---that of a strong woman, full of
character, but now kept locked away and forever forced to accept what would
seem a strange and unnatural role; that of the helplessly submissive
female.� Her very core being continually
shaped anew against her will over days and weeks and months---how indeed, I
wondered, would she react?� Even more,
knowing her as I did now, if I were successful, how would I react to this same
woman in the new totally submissive role that I saw for her as permanent?� 

&nbsp;

God help me, I couldn�t help it---I looked forward to seeing what
I could do with this woman.� In my
arrogance, I was so intent upon my plans for the beautiful Rebecca that I
ignored the one thing that had been drilled into my head by the military for
years.� No plan ever remains unchanged
when it meets the opposition.� You might
know it as blowback, or even the law of unintended consequences.� In any case, it turned my life upside
down.� Accepting �responsibility� for this woman also implied being able to maintain
a certain necessary emotional �distance�.� And while I should always appear
conscientious and dependable and trustworthy, at the same time I needed to
maintain objectivity towards her and her needs.�
But what happened when that emotional distance was gone and objectivity
was just another one of the games in which we kidded ourselves?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Chapter 21: I'm a true believer in
Karma.� You get what you give, whether
it's good or bad; Sandra Bullock.

&nbsp;

It was 5:30 in the morning and I looked at the woman who crouched
by my feet bound in leather and metal.�
This was a day without dawn and slowly the sky lightened outside, but
the sun never showed itself.� Black
turned to gray, and colors crept timidly back into the world.� Everything was somber that day, as if the
world cried for what this woman had relinquished.

&nbsp;

She found it difficult to meet my eyes, but that was to be
expected given what she had just gone through and considering what she had just
surrendered.� The straps that ran around
her neck immediately drew one�s eyes to the round black rubber piece that
filled her mouth.� Not particularly
attractive at the moment, any makeup was long gone and her stringy hair was now
matted across her face.� Hands still
cuffed, she couldn�t pull the blanket around her shoulders and it had fallen
mostly from her body and puddled on the floor.�
The sides of her breasts leaked a thin clear fluid from where the skin
was pierced.� She shivered
constantly.� I pulled the blanket back
around her shoulders.

&nbsp;

�First we talk,� I said, �then I decide what we do next.�� I leaned down and unhooked the strap from in
back of her neck.� Rebecca opened her
mouth as wide as she could and I slowly pulled the gag out.� She said nothing for a minute as she worked
her jaws.� I knew that I had to be
careful with gags like this---I'd left it in her mouth longer than I should've,
but I would use it for shorter periods from now on.� During this time, I also unhooked her cuffs
from the D-ring on the wall.

&nbsp;

There was a determined look on her face for a second, then a
shudder suddenly ran through her body.�
�I�m cold,� she whispered.� 

&nbsp;

�Woman, you will speak when given permission to speak,� was my
pompous sounding reply.� I winced to
myself, this hadn't started off like I thought it would.

&nbsp;

I looked down on her in silence for a moment, then grabbed her
arm, �Stand up.�� Rebecca struggled to
her feet with my help.� Her legs seemed
numb and with her hands cuffed, she couldn�t get up on her own.� Finally she stood, but she was unsteady,
swaying slightly as if there was an easy breeze in the room.� I turned her around and removed the
handcuffs.� Leading her to the bed, I
told her to sit on the edge of it.� 

&nbsp;

She was a woman with broad shoulders and a proud, athletic
body.� Normally.� But not right now.� Right now, her arms looked thin and frail, her
shoulders bowed as if they held the weight of the world.� As she sat down, I couldn�t help myself---I
touched her face and ran my hand along her jaw line, then along her
collar.� Her skin felt like ice.� Her knees were slight spread and I could see
the small cooked area I'd left high up on the inside of her thigh.� I draped the blanket around her shoulders
again.� She looked up at me and seemed to
pause expectantly.� I thought she
probably had a thousand questions for me, but I made her wait.� This was what she was going to have to get
used to.� 

&nbsp;

She pulled the blanket more tightly around herself and then stared
at the opposite wall.� Finally, Rebecca
closed her eyes when I spoke again.� �You
think you want freedom, but you�ve made the mistake common to many educated
people.� You forgot that people are
lazy.� They need to be led.�

&nbsp;

�In your desperate rush to embrace your ignorance, you thought
yourself a strong woman.� We both know
that illusion of strength is gone now.��
I talked to her as if she were a child.�
�I have no doubt however, that you remain strong-willed and unpredictable.� You'll be a challenge.�� I almost snorted aloud as I remembered what
one of the Brits at Diego Garcia used to say to me, �Ten years of university to become a master of the bleeding obvious.�

&nbsp;

�You know,� I continued after a short silence.� �I�m not really worried about you fighting
me.� You�re not going to fight me, are
you?�� I looked at her collar; it was the
type that once you put a small padlock into it, it couldn�t be taken off
without first removing the padlock.�
Rebecca had to learn that like her brand, the collar now represented
permanency; she would never again remove it without the express permission of
her master.

&nbsp;

Rebecca just shook her head no.�


&nbsp;

Sure.� Riiiight.� No fight at all, I thought to myself.� I walked around her for a moment.� Then I reached down and quietly touched the
collar around her neck.�� It was loose
enough that it wouldn't chafe her or leave marks, yet tight enough that she
would never get it off by herself.� 

&nbsp;

I spoke, urgently, believably.�
�You will be starting your life over with me.� Because of what this represents, you will no
longer be known by your old name.� As you
begin to understand your new life, you'll earn a new name.� I don't know what it is yet, but you�ll give
it to me yourself.� You're a woman that
needs order.� You need structure.� You�ve always needed these things in your
life, but you just didn�t know it.� But
I�ll be working with you now and when we're done, you'll have both in your
life.� As an ex-teacher, you know how
necessary discipline is for a successful life.�

&nbsp;

Rebecca�s face seemed to collapse suddenly as I said �ex-teacher.�� She knew that I was right; she�d never be
allowed to teach again.� I think she
hated that more than anything else.�
Whether anyone else believed it or not, from what I had been able to
discover, she always enjoyed teaching.� I
knew that she wasn�t the best teacher around, but I also knew that she was
better than most�.even if she had screwed up big time.� But none of that mattered now.� All that anyone would ever see from this
point on was her police record.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

As I looked at Rebecca, I
felt I owed it to her to try the easy way the first time, before she forced me
to do it the hard way---even as I knew that this last was the road down which
we both were fated to travel.� I put a
cold, forbidding tone in my voice as I began.

&nbsp;

�A woman like you is going to find it hard to give me what you�re
not yet sure you even have inside you.�
You�re wearing a collar now and you're confused about your new role,
about what it all means.� But even with
your controlling streak, you�ll understand your true submissive nature better
if you don�t pretend to a dominance that hasn't worked for you.� This is why you've had so much trouble making
relationships work.�� 

&nbsp;

Rebecca refused to answer; she wouldn�t even look at me.� I ignored the rude behavior and
continued.� �Because of this, you are
going to be forced to explore the reality of a submissive---you will assume the
bottom position in our relationship.� I
know I'll have to use force at first to help motivate exploring the correct
behavior, but not at the end.� This last
isn't necessarily because I say so or even because I might try to make you do
this---but rather because you were born to be submissive, even you don�t know
it yet.� It's what's inside you.� What you are going to find in the end is that
even unrealized submissives like you usually want to behave well for a worthy
Master.� But Sub�s like you also get a
thrill from testing their Dom�s and pushing the limits.� And this is where we are going to have the
most problems.�

&nbsp;

As I said this, I saw her look at me for a second, then her chin
rose even more in what looked suspiciously like defiance laced with a touch of
pride.� I knew I was in for one hell of a
ride with this woman. �Did� I really know what I was getting into with
her?

&nbsp;

Suddenly she blurted out, �We don�t have a relationship.� You've kidnapped me.�

&nbsp;

�Woman, if you speak one more time without permission,� I told
her, �I will enthusiastically beat you silly.�
Do you understand?�

&nbsp;

She glowered at me.� I just
stared at her without an expression on my face and after a second, she nodded
her head.

&nbsp;

�Give me an answer,� I demanded.�
�Do you understand me?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, I understand you.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, I understand you, what?�
I asked silkily.

&nbsp;

�Yes, I understand you, Master,� she grated between clenched
teeth.

&nbsp;

I ignored her petulance as I continued.� �And at the same time, I know that you�re
smart enough to fight me in a mostly passive way in anything I might demand,
just like now; because that�s your nature.� It may take awhile, but you are going to find
out eventually that you like the things I do to you: you�re going learn the
pleasure of relinquishing your responsibilities to another, stronger person.� First you'll learn to live with your fate,
then you'll learn to live above it.�� The
sudden desperate look on her face told me I had discovered an area in which she
was already uncertain.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I felt the first uncertainties.�
I hated the fact that what he said sparked a small, primitive part of
me; and fear, instinctive and unstoppable, jumped through me.� I knew myself well enough to know that evil
or wrong, it didn't matter.� I could
never resist doing something that felt good to me.� How could he know this of me, when I barely
acknowledged it myself?

&nbsp;

�***

&nbsp;

I looked into Rebecca's eyes as I continued without stopping.� �And as I take away each part of your life,
one by one---if you honestly look at how much better you'll feel after
relinquishing each to me, you�re going to start wanting to give up even more
until suddenly you realize that you�ve willingly given me complete control of
every part of your life.� This is a
strangely seductive road for powerful women like you and once you truly start
down this path, you�ll voluntarily look for something new to give every
day.� And each time I restrict you just a
little more, it�s going to make you feel that much more safe and secure.� In the end, only by giving up everything will
you experience complete freedom in a way you�ve never imagined.�

&nbsp;

I had another thought as I looked at my new slave.� �And when the Dom�s in town hear how you've
submitted, they�ll welcome you quickly enough.�

&nbsp;

�Welcome me for what?�

&nbsp;

I scowled and she quickly said, �Welcome me for what, Master?�

&nbsp;

I laughed scornfully.� �For
one of us.� Do you think that you will be
the first woman to ever fly into the arms of a Dom and beg to be kept, even
though you may never have said a word?�
In their hearts, most women want the same freedom I offer you.�

&nbsp;

�And when I�m freed by you in this way,� Rebecca asked slowly,
almost sarcastically, �will I be free to go then?� Master.��
That last had been added on only as an afterthought.� 

&nbsp;

�Sure you will,� I smiled warmly.�
�And we�ll be free to track you down and bring you back.� It�s dangerous being free with people like
me, but most Subs come to like the taste of it.�

&nbsp;

Rebecca looked straight ahead and shook her head slightly back and
forth in denial of my observations.

&nbsp;

I didn�t care what she
thought; I continued without responding to her obvious disrespect.� I would pick my battles carefully with this
woman.� �In return for my taking
responsibility for the less attractive parts of your life, you'll learn how to
behave around Dom�s like me.� Believe it
or not, you will learn to�..appreciate�..my needs, just as I focus on
yours.� Your behavior will soon reflect
your desire to fulfill the needs of those you look up to.� Your role will be to service those needs and desires---and
doing this will make you happy.� At this
point, you�ll begin to feel guilty if you HAVEN�T
satisfied me.� But I have no doubt that
you will fight me on this too.� At
first.� However, in the end we�ll reach
an agreement, some kind of an accommodation����
I smiled at her for a second as I turned both of my palms face up, ��..
and you�ll do everything my way.�

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I looked at Rebecca in silence for a moment.� There was a lot of crap written about BDSM,
most of it simplistic and some even juvenile.�
I wasn�t angry at her, so how would I to explain that there would be an
initial series of punishments over the next few weeks and months?� But somehow at the same time convince her
that the purpose of these was to influence her future behavior, and not because
I was necessarily into sadism---although I was.�
And while I needed her to believe that I didn�t want to hurt her anymore
than she already desired in her hidden fantasies, she also needed to understand
that I would always push to find the most extreme boundaries that she might
normally wish to keep hidden from the view of others.

&nbsp;

This woman was a rational and complex person.� I wanted her to focus on why she was being
punished and not on the punishment itself.�
But at the same time she needed to understand that when she fought me, I
would automatically escalate in a heartbeat to new levels of the beautiful
violence that she so desired in her subconscious.� And in the end, Rebecca must learn that she
had always been destined to give to me what I had chosen for her to
sacrifice---but she also had to know that I would never ask her for too much,
but rather just enough.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

Her conservative style of dress reflected the way she looked at
herself.� Rebecca was a woman that
pretended to a sophisticated culture I didn't think she really possessed.� She was a proud woman, but a private woman
too, always partaking of her guilty pleasures away from the sight of
others.� Because of this, humiliation
would be a powerful tool in her new world---and I would use it freely on her,
and against her.� I would first use it
rather sparingly at first and only in private.�
But once I had a feel for her limits and our relationship had matured, I
would later publicly humiliate her because it would push so many more of
Rebecca�s emotional buttons all at one time.�
I was aware that this would probably become even more shameful as I
began to sexualize her humiliation.� If I
was correct about her hidden nature and I could get her to embrace it, in the
end she would have to at least accept these things.� And if we both were lucky, she perhaps would
even find public shame attractive rather than abusive, because it would be so
daring compared to what she was used to.�
But because of her pride, I didn't think that she could early on easily
handle being humbled to the point of having total subjugation and grinding
sexual degradation witnessed by others.

&nbsp;

She wore my collar now, and I relished the thought.� But for some reason, the current reality
brought out part of the beast in me.� I
later realized that I made an artificial distinction between the physical and
the emotional, as if they were foreign entities in stand-alone landscapes.� Even as I knew that early brutality would
lose her, I still daydreamed.� Perhaps
after enough training, I could take her to a point where she would beg for
these things?

&nbsp;

I didn�t quite know how to exactly shape her conditioning yet,
instead having only a general outline from which to work.� In a job like this, Rebecca would continually
tell me what I needed to know with her actions and reactions.� I knew I wanted a servile bottom.� But I didn�t want to turn her into a craven
bitch that mistook the ability to take heavy beatings as proof of her
devotion.� Given her natural
inclinations, would she in the end be the kind of Sub that enjoyed physical �excitations� for the sheer terror it
brought, since it was inevitably followed by a rushing storm of adrenaline and
endorphins?� Or was she the kind of woman
that would eventually learn to like the feeling of living in an environment
that was always completely out of her control, always feeling like she was
being pushed to the edge of a divine madness by my demands?� I just didn�t know yet.

&nbsp;

In the end, I talked to her about discipline and punishment, and
the need to obey.� I covered a few
positions which I felt conveyed both respect and deference.� And then I talked for awhile about what I
expected from her.� She maintained a
sullen silence the whole time, but this did not really surprise me.� I'd prepared a schedule that generally
covered the day, but I didn�t spend a lot of time at this point making it too
detailed.� Rather I wanted to remain
flexible, planning on addressing the many unaddressed issues as each came
up.� And so this is how the first part of
that first morning ended.� 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Chapter 22: Cruelty, very far from being a
vice, is the first sentiment Nature injects in us all.� Cruelty is simply the energy in a man
civilization has not yet altogether corrupted: therefore it is a virtue, not a
vice; Marquis de Sade.

&nbsp;

We would spend a lot of time together while I was home during the
next few days.� But once I went back to
work, for at least the first couple of weeks I would keep Rebecca in the wooden
box under the bed while I was gone during the day; I would only free her when I
got home late in the day.� For the most
part, she seemed to hate being boxed.� In
anticipation of keeping her bound for long stretches of time, I had already
shifted over to using padded leather wrist and ankle cuffs.� At night when I was home to monitor her, she
would sleep in the bed with her right wrist cuffed to the head of the bed.� I planned on feeding her a light breakfast in
the morning after she had exercised, and then another light meal later in the
afternoon.� This would continue until we
both had settled into a routine.

&nbsp;

Frankly, she looked pretty rough this morning.� With no makeup, her skin was blotchy from the
cold and her hair a mess.� Her nose was
running, she was having difficulty with her nose ring, and her breasts seemed
in pain from her new ornaments.� The skin
around each hole was more red now and and continually leaked a thin, clear
fluid.� I'd have to make sure that she
kept herself clean and that the holes in her breasts were always covered with a
topical antibiotic.

&nbsp;

I let her know that beginning tomorrow morning, she must be more
presentable within a few minutes of being awakened.� She would brush her hair and then put it in
an easily maintained pony tail.� Rebecca
gave me a long, expressionless look that fairly screamed defiance.� Her resiliency surprised me after what she'd
just been through and I knew that I couldn�t continue to let these things go by
without being corrected.� I grabbed her
hair and asked quietly, �You stupid, stupid bitch.� Is there anything wrong?� Do you have any comments you want to
make?�� 

&nbsp;

She shook her head and lowered her eyes; despite her rough
appearance, she was still totally desirable when she submitted to my will like
this.� It was appropriate to begin now,
shaping her behavior from the beginning.�
This was an integral part of her schedule---exercise and preparing
herself to be seen before she had
anything to eat.� Hunger was a good
motivator. 

&nbsp;

She still wasn�t speaking to me very much, but I would let it go
for a little while longer.� If she kept
it up for more than a couple of days, I knew that I would have to act; but that
time was not quite yet.� I led her to the
stationary bicycle and cuffed her left wrist to the machine.� With a grimace of what could only be total
disgust, Rebecca spread her legs to mount the bike and settle her shaved crotch
on the seat. �She stopped suddenly as she
realized that she had to sit on a narrow bike seat and that her poor, torn anus
would be screaming its reply.� She slowly
settled herself on to the seat with a grimace of pain and sat still for a
minute.� Finally, she wiggled her hips
gently a couple of times and without asking me to change the setting on the
pedals, she began pedaling.� I smiled to
myself as I made a mental note to get a couple of washable seat covers for the
bike.� If she knew that this pace would
later be bumped up significantly as I became more familiar with her
capabilities, I am sure she would have been even more disgusted.

&nbsp;

Once she got her speed up and a rhythm working, the natural back
and forth sway of her upper body quickly became a problem.� While athletically slim, she was a healthy
woman and her breasts suddenly became an issue.�
She tried to perform but was in obvious discomfort; with her left hand
chained to the machine, she could not care for herself.� Although she didn�t complain at first, it became
more and more of a problem as I watched, and soon I knew that I couldn�t keep
her wrist cuffed and demand that she exercise naked too.� 

&nbsp;

Finally, she glanced at me, her look a scream of silent
frustration at the machine and, I think, at her new reality.� I solved this problem by freeing her hand and
locking a light chain from the bike around her waist.� Without stopping, she grimaced as she gently
cupped a breast in each hand and continued exercising.� Now she rode in silence with both tender
breasts cradled and protected.� 

&nbsp;

This an excellent compromise.�
While the first image of her on the bike was erotic, the second almost
drove me wild.� I banished the thoughts
from my mind as best I could.� Tomorrow I
would have a belt for her to wear around her waist and I'd chain her to the
equipment.� Finished with the bike, she
switched over to the other machine.�
While I read a book, I next had her spend forty-five minutes walking on the
treadmill.� The pace bored her to death,
but again, she didn�t know that she would be jogging soon.� When she was finished this, I had her put
just her toes on a short piece of 2� x 10� wood that I'd bolted to the floor
and hold 10 pound weights in each hand as she raised up on her toes for a
minute at a time.� I was determined to
keep her calf and thigh muscles well toned and attractive.� 

&nbsp;

When she finished, I gave her a small towel with which to dry
off.� I now allowed Rebecca forty-five
minutes to take a shower and wash her hair if necessary.� I'd retrieved the makeup by then from her bag
and now insisted that she apply her face before presenting herself to me
again.� This didn�t make her too happy
and forced her to hurry, but she had to understand that for me, looking good at
all times was a necessity in which she had no choice.� This could not be over-emphasized.

&nbsp;

Finished with her early morning responsibilities, the beautiful
woman now sat in front of me on the edge of her bed, eating a quick breakfast
sandwich.� Interestingly, being naked
didn't seem to bother her.� I didn�t plan
on giving Rebecca anything that required eating implements until I knew how she
would react to her new environment.� She
quickly glanced up at me in distrust when I put coffee in front of her.� After I assured her that it was not drugged,
she finally tasted it.� When I went back
to work, it would be at this point that I would put her in the box.

&nbsp;

Finally, we sat while I mostly talked.� I talked about various things: what I saw in
her, about the need for discipline and what I wanted from her.� I talked a little about geopolitics and even
sports.� She was stiff and responded
little to my conversational gambits.�
Surprisingly, the only time I got a real response was when I mentioned
college basketball.� Both of us, it
turned out, hated pro ball, but loved college ball.� 

&nbsp;

After a couple of hours, I left her cuffed to the bed since she
seemed ready to take a nap---I had already told her to get used to going
without lunch.� I was happy about how
things had gone.� I�d maintained a strong
sense of objectivity and distance from her, even as I had been able to talk
about a few things that were a touch intimate to both of us---it was a
beginning.� I locked Rebecca in the White
Room and laid down for a nap myself.�
This, I thought to myself, was going well.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I once read
that there are five stages that a person goes through in a situation like this;
I mean, as they were being broken down psychologically.� Stage one was Denial; you know, the �This isn�t happening to me��this can�t be real�.why is this
happening to me?� sort of lament that goes through the movie heroine�s mind after
she�s GIVEN UP EVERYTHING!

&nbsp;

I obeyed his
commands that first day away from the plank as best I could.� As the hours passed, my fear of the unknown
continued to grow until it was all I could do not to scream.� I was afraid of him.� There was nothing to say to this man, the one
who thought his collar was permanently locked around my neck.� His ways, which sometimes seemed monstrous
and alien, were always controlling.�
Mostly, I was afraid of what would happen tonight.� But nothing happened after dark, I was
allowed to sleep; still fearful, but untouched.�
I couldn't really be here; I couldn�t have done what I'd just done, it
was insane!

&nbsp;

It might
have been a dream.� Could have been a
dream.� MUST have been a dream.

&nbsp;

I was in the
sea near mountains.� The west winds blew
with incessant gale force from the cold mountain peaks, creating a
psychological vacuum.� All I could think
of was the savage winds, age-old ice in the harbors and cruel black water
lapping at its edges.� Beyond the surf
the killer whales waited until the current crop of frozen corpses dropped into
the water.� To the Orcas, the bodies were
nothing more than a frozen, or clumsy and noisy form of seal.� I rode a windsurfer.� But I had no arms to steer the board, and
skimmed farther and farther out onto the lake.�
The shoreline disappeared from view.�
Skies darkened.� Wind howled.� The waves grew higher and higher, breaking
over me again and again before finally tipping the board like a subway
token.� I tumbled through the air.� Into the water.� The cold wet closed over me, pulling me down.� I could see nothing in the frigid blackness,
but I could hear.

&nbsp;

Voices.

&nbsp;

No.� One voice.�
His.

&nbsp;

Welcome to the Dark Room.�


&nbsp;

Deeper.� Darker. �Colder.

&nbsp;

I�ve been waiting for you.

&nbsp;

Pain.� The pain he always gave me.� In my stomach.� I pressed the side of my body against the
floor, and tried to drive it out with the cold.�
I curled into a ball.� Tighter and
tighter.� If I made myself small enough,
I could sink between the seams, disappear into the floor, and leave the pain
behind.� It wouldn�t fit.� It was too big.� 

&nbsp;

Finally, I
awoke, still in the White Room and covered with sweat.� The panic came out of nowhere and totally
filled me.� I couldn't see it, but I knew
my face was red.� My heart was having
palpitations.� The thoughts swirled in my
head like confused nocturnal animals in a room when a light is turned on.� It was in the middle of the night and it
hadn't been a dream; I belonged to him.� I
realized that in my new life I walked a tightrope; one side led to what seemed
a life of collared madness, while on the other lay jail and disgrace.� I had traded one set of knowns for the
complete unknown.� I was such a
fool.� 

&nbsp;

I know later
I that this was also the time that I began to come down with scarlet fever---at
least that�s how I think of it.� It
wasn�t really the scarlet fever, not the one you read about in the history
books.� Mine started with just this
feeling, and scarlet was its color.� Red.� At the end of a few hours, I grew so hot I
had to release it, but it was the heat of a cold sweat.� 

&nbsp;

Soon I was
helpless.� It came with the foreign metal
now at home in my body and stayed to kill me, going from my breasts into my
blood in one easy shift.� The fever ate
me up inside and made me shake like I was winter, like my blood was made of ice
water and I needed to see it run.� I
needed to touch it and feel its warmth----because I knew that it had to be
warm.� Nobody could feel this dead
inside.� When it came out along my skin
there wasn�t any pain.� Just relief.� Just the tiny red rivers of life leaking from
my pierced breasts.� And I could breathe
again, seeing that.� I could spread my
arms and touch the edges of my emotions and know that maybe they touched back,
like something new and curious.� Or maybe
something old and forgotten.� 

&nbsp;

He'd pierced
my breasts in a way that he knew should not be done, but I don�t think he cared
much about what happened to me at that point.�
And I thought the heat and the pain was who I am.� This was what I was made of.� An old friend that didn�t need
introductions.� I held my breath until I
let out the scarlet fever.

&nbsp;

When I next
was able to think, several days had apparently passed, or at least that's what
he told me.� When I was first aware
again, my head was on a pillow and my hands rested behind my head.� Even though weak, I needed to move.� I began to move my hands down by my side when
suddenly, I felt this ripping, tearing pain in my nose.� Thankfully I was able to stop my hands in
time; thin chains had been clipped to my breast rings and run up through my
nose ring.� He'd then fastened them to
the soft leather cuffs that I wore on each wrist.� The length of the chain was enough for me to
comfortably keep my hands behind my head, but not enough to get my hands lower
than my shoulders.� He had immobilized me
in the most humiliating manner possible.�


&nbsp;

Once we both
knew the depths of my humiliation, he eventually removed the chains and
finally, I began to recover.� At first I watched the light come through the window for a long time before
I began to think about where I was.� The
recollection came hard, like a lesson learned but not used for a while.� I tried to sit up, felt a dizziness that
reminded me of the last time I had spent a week ill and flat on my back in
bed.� As suddenly as it had come, it was
gone.� I shook my head, then lay
back.� I was here for a rest, a nice,
long rest.� The picture seemed to lack
something, but it was too much trouble to think about it right now.� I looked around the room.� It was white and small, and had a couple of
doors---it was the White Room and I remembered everything.

&nbsp;

Even though
I was weak for days afterwards, somehow I avoided the awful scarring of the
breasts that should have accompanied my treatment at his hands.� The strong antibiotic pills he gave me helped
a lot, killing the infection inside.� But
most of the success, I suppose, is due to my own efforts.� I learned to keep my breasts clean and
applied the medicated ointment more often than necessary.� It took almost two months, but the tenderness
and the redness and the swelling finally went away.� Then he used these rings to train me;
humiliating me on purpose---and the worst part was how successful he was with
these tools in his hands.� 

&nbsp;

At other
times, he used them in a purely sexual manner.�
Again, here too the worst part was how well they worked for him in the
end.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

Once I
overcame the fever, he began 'storing' me in the box beneath the bed during the
day when he was at work.� The first time
didn't seem so bad.� I lay there and
sweated until I could no longer smell the stink of my own body.� I closed my eyes, consciously letting the
muscles at each of my joints relax---first the toes and fingers, then ankles
and wrists, knees and elbows, shoulders and hips, then slowly, each vertebra
along my back to my neck.� 

&nbsp;

The first
day wasn't so bad.� He let me out at
night and made me exercise and clean the White Room.� There was no training other than this.� The next day in the box was worse and the
next after that even more terrible.� 

&nbsp;

The fever
and the darkness had scrambled my brains.�
I tried to remember things� I'd
read, but the fever had scrambled my focus.�
The first two nights, I woke up shouting into the blackness.....

&nbsp;

�Is this
what you want, you fucker?� Why?� What the hell is the point?� I'm going to rot away here not even know what
the fuck you want....�

&nbsp;

�I'm sorry
mom, I didn't mean for this to happen.�
But tell those bastards at CNN to back off.....�

&nbsp;

�You win.� I admit it.�
I'll do anything you want.....�

&nbsp;

�You know, I
don't think I'll make it home for Thanksgiving dinner...�

&nbsp;

�For
Christ's sake, it's not like I killed anyone...�

&nbsp;

�Please,
God, don't let me die in here.�

&nbsp;

On the
fourth day in the box, I went for almost ten hours before he let me out to use
the toilet.� Once I relieved myself, he
put me back in.� As I approached the box,
I felt as if the miasma reached out and literally touched me.� Every now and then he would come by and free
me, give me a little food and let me use the toilet again.� But the longer I stayed in the box each time,
the more panic I felt.� But oddly, there
were also times during which I felt only peace and comfort during the tedious
periods of solitude.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I lay on my
back and it had been hours since his last visit; my bladder was bursting.� I tried to calm myself and prayed for a cool
cascade of emotional stillness, but felt instead only the dry mouth and roiling
stomach of continually growing dread.�
The air I gulped was tight and close, tasting of my sweat and my
panic.� And through it all, the broken
thought worked through my racing mind like subtle static, barely detectable�.. this isn�t right, this isn�t right. God, this isn't right.

&nbsp;

No sooner
had I thought this than he came.� I knew
that I had to escape now or I would die here.�
I felt him move the box before he raised the lid and allowed light into
my prison; he was obviously perusing my body.�
I made sure that one of my breasts was fully exposed; he�d wanted me
once, maybe he would again.� For a long
time I didn�t move, feigning near unconsciousness.� Finally he reached down and felt my
forehead.� Then his hand drifted to my
shoulder, and finally to my breast, caressing it and tugging on my nipple, then
on the golden loop that framed it.�
Making no move and not acknowledging the pain, I waited.� It was instinct, for every man required a
slightly different seduction.� Finally he
grabbed my arm.� 

&nbsp;

�Stand up.�

&nbsp;

I made as if
to stir and struggled to my feet while I remained hunched over.� The �thank-you� my back gave me for spending
so long in the box was countered by the opinion expressed by my right hip and
thigh.� I adopted a mask of nonchalance, but
my mind was racing.� The terror I felt at
what I knew he planned gave me strength for one desperate attempt and I was
prepared to risk everything.� I hoped he
would release my hands from their bondage, and he did.� In the near darkness, I fell against him,
making sure that my arm and even my hands rubbed his crotch.� He took me by the shoulders and moved me away
from him.� 

&nbsp;

He helped me
out; I was terribly stiff and stumbled as I went, nearly falling.� He grabbed the hair at the back of my head
and gave a tremendous yank to keep me upright.�
But it didn�t help as my feet flew up in front of me and I assumed an
almost horizontal position in mid-air before I came crashing down on my
back.� With my hands stiff with fatigue,
I was too slow and unable to cushion my landing; it knocked the air out of my
lungs.� It was clear that he could do
with me as he wished.� I let him help me
stand.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

INTERLUDE

It was just
before Christmas and it was dark and cold out as the man returned home from
work.� Spending time with the police had
set him back several days.� Concentrating
on getting inside and a fire going, he was a little surprised when he found the
plastic sack containing a gift hanging on the front door handle.� Putting his briefcase down, he took the bag
off of the door.� He didn't know many of
his neighbors, so the gift surprised him; although a naturally reserved person,
it had always been his wife that was the more outgoing one that way.� Opening the bag, he reached in and removed a
small wrapped object about the size of a CD.�
Curious, he tore away the paper wrapping to reveal a DVD case.� Picking everything up, he walked into the
house.� 

&nbsp;

The first thing
he did was get a fire going in the fireplace and mix himself a drink.� This done, assuming the disc was a gift from
a friend, he walked over to the player and loaded the DVD.� The beginning played out on a blank screen,
then the audio kicked in sharply, filling the room with the gravelly voice of a
male blues singer.� He went rigid when
the woman's face appeared on the screen, pale and chalky, a dark bruise barely
noticeable on her right temple.� Tears
glittered in the woman's eyes.� Pain, or
lust, twisted her face.

&nbsp;

�Jesus.....!�
breathed Rebecca's husband as he looked at her face, then stepped back from the
TV.� The shot was from above and was so
tight that the tracks of Rebecca's tears showed against her bloodless
cheeks.� Her breath came in grunts and
sharp bursts.� It took him a minute to
realize.� �My God,� he whispered to
himself, �I think she's being raped�.�
Still on his feet, he moved back towards the TV screen, his hand extended
as if to reach into the television set and put a halt to the outrage.� He became aware of the music, the guttural
grunts and gasps, the noise of a man's sexual frenzy.� Something writhed deeply inside him, an old
terror set loose by the sound of his wife's torture, and by the music
itself.� 

&nbsp;

For a second,
the rapist's shoulder came into view at the edge of the screen, a dark boulder
ramming against his wife's chin.� She
stared over his shoulder at the camera and her lips crooked into a tiny smile
as the rhythm of the act quickened; the grunts becoming louder, sharper, as the
rapist started to climax.� She closed her
eyes and he heard his wife give a moan of anticipation through clenched teeth,
the sound cutting him to the quick.� In
any other place, at any other time, from her it would have been the sound of
true pleasure, but he would not believe it, not here, not like this.

&nbsp;

He tried to
pull his eyes away from the screen, but couldn't, even though his flesh was
trying to crawl off of his bones.� There
was a male groan of satisfaction and he watched her eye lids flicker as the man
climaxed inside her, then the picture froze on the rictus of false pleasure as
she stared at him out of the television for what seemed an eternity before it
slowly faded away.� There was
darkness.� 

&nbsp;

Suddenly, the
picture came back again, but this time his wife seemed to be facing the camera
in a different way.� Now it looked like
she was laying on her stomach, but the angles were weird, off a little.� Her arms were above her head and she faced
her right shoulder.� The lens of the
camera was at the height of her face and she was looking into it.� Her body seemed to move towards the camera
coming into better focus, then move away and go a little fuzzy.� And even though the same kind of music was
playing in the background again, it seemed from the look on her face that her
body now moved to the beat of a rhythm that perhaps only Rebecca could
hear.� 

&nbsp;

She had a kind
of fixed smile on her face that he had never seen before as she stared into the
camera, and as before her eyes sparkled, filled with unshed tears.� Suddenly he realized that this time the man
was on top of her back; she was being sodomized.� As before, the background sounds were filled
with male satisfaction, grunts and groans of intense pleasure.� Peering closer, he realized that something
else was different---she now wore a large ring through her nose.

&nbsp;

The masked head
of a man could be seen over her shoulder, maintaining a cadenced movement as he
continued plowing her ass.� Like a
machine, the man just kept going and going until he reached a sudden and
unexpected climax.� As the unknown man
groaned in pleasure upon reaching orgasm, Rebecca's husband watched a small
smile of what to some might signal acceptance flicker onto her face, when
suddenly his wife's eyelids opened wide in shock at what must have been the
intense feeling of the man's cum spurting deep inside her rectum.� He had wanted this from Rebecca and she had
always refused.� She would have never
willingly allowed this to be done to her.�
Never!� Having been married to her
as long as he had, he knew how much his wife would hate being forced to accept
this, especially on camera.

&nbsp;

Her face stayed
frozen on the screen, her beautiful blue eyes wide open and almost bulging at
the last sensation she must have been feeling.�
Suddenly, this scene too faded to black.�
For a moment, nothing showed as the screen remained blank, then words
slowly began to form.� �Do you want
your wife back?� Save her if you can.�� Rebecca's husband looked at the words on the
screen for almost five minutes before he slowly turned the television off and
removed the DVD.� 

&nbsp;

His hands were
shaking.� He knew that there had to be
clues on it; things the police could find....they could do wonders with
it.� Fingerprints; the computer on which
it had been made could be traced, the program used to edit the movie; the
background of where she was being held could be analyzed, the music, the room,
the ambient sounds.� This was evidence
that could help find her, help free her from the monster that kept her
prisoner.

&nbsp;

Even though a
lawyer, he was not a hard man nor a mean man.�
He certainly wasn't a brave man either.�
But he was a man that knew he had disappointed his wife from the
beginning of their marriage.� Even more,
he was a man that finally knew exactly what his wife was like.� And he knew, even if only second hand, the
vague outlines of her normal &quot;desires&quot; with her students.� He had forgiven her and moved with her once
before because of that, but that move had taken a toll on him and their
marriage.� And still it seemed that she
could never get enough.� 

&nbsp;

It had taken a
long time, but the love within had finally died.� He put the DVD back in and fast-forwarded to
the shot of her face at the conclusion of the anal rape and froze the
scene.� He looked at her face and
Rebecca's beautiful blue eyes.� It took
awhile to run through their memories together, but finally he made his
decision.� Looking at her face, he said
aloud, �Maybe your high school lovers can save you this time, but not me.� Not anymore.�
I'm done with you.�� 

&nbsp;

He shook his
head.� &quot;And as for you, Mister
Monster Man, I hope you know what you're doing.�
She's a fucked-up slut that deserves everything you do to her, but watch
out.� She's a tricky whore and can be a
monster too in her own way.&quot;�
Decision now made, he threw the DVD on the fire without a second�s
hesitation and went to bed.� He was
asleep in five minutes and never dreamed of his wife once.

&nbsp;

Chapter 23: As
with most liberal sexual ideas, what makes the world a better place for men
invariably makes it a duller and more dangerous place for women: Julie Burchill.

&nbsp;

He helped me
up from the floor.� I looked at him and
he looked at me; each of us almost challenging each other.� I could not keep my head bowed.� Quite the opposite, I stared directly at
him.� I think he saw determination in my
eyes; I know that I saw not an ounce of compassion in his.

&nbsp;

I had
allowed him to do this to me for too long now; I knew that I had reached my
breaking point, that I had to escape or go insane.� Reacting in an unthinking frenzy, I butted
his chin with my head and tried to knock him down, hoping that he had left a
door open somewhere.� Surprise was my
major weapon in what turned out to be my only attempt to escape.� I ran to the door that led outside---no
luck.� My muscles objected to the sudden
exertion and my side cramped badly.� I
turned and made for the door that led into his home.� It too was locked.

&nbsp;

As with so
many other things that were involved with this man, I had under-estimated him
and over-estimated my abilities.� I had
been too impatient.� My muscles were
tight and cramped from my time in the box; my back was stiff, the rapes and
more leaving me barely able to move.�
Even worse, I hadn't realized how weak the fever left me.� 

&nbsp;

I'd knocked
him over and in desperation I turned from the last door to kick him while he
was down.� I had failed.� He'd somehow been aware of my intent, and now
waited with expectation.� He licked at a
trickle of blood that ran from the corner of his mouth where he'd bitten his
tongue.� The monster laughed.� Not from amusement.� Anticipation.�
He walked toward me, overpowering in both his bulk and his anger.� We both knew what would happen next; him in
some detail, me intimately.� 

&nbsp;

I had only
now begun to recover from the fever and his rapes and beatings on the inclined
plank, the bruises fading to a light blue, mottled with orange.� And I knew that if I could run somehow, I
could challenge his belief in his mastery over me.� But there was nowhere to run, for that wasn�t
part of the deal he'd offered me on that first dark night.� How bad could it be? I'd asked myself then.� 

&nbsp;

I learned
how bad it could be.� And I learned this
too that day.� When someone beats you
until you�re unconscious, you stop feeling the blows before you lose
consciousness; you stop feeling the blows long before the darkness comes.� 

&nbsp;

I turned to
dodge him and something heavy fell across the back of my head.� I fell, but never quite lost consciousness
then, even though the blow was enough to stun me.� It was almost as if he was trained, knowing
exactly where to kick as i lay on the floor.�
I heard him say to himself softly, �Not the face or the tits, keep them
clean.�� Sometimes he held me by my arm or
my hair and hit me with his fists, sometimes he worked up a sweat with his boot
and my body.� 

&nbsp;

The pain he
demanded I accept that night fucked me from the inside out.� Deeper than sex and more intimate than a
kiss.� It feasted like an animal on my
body and I felt its every bite.� 

&nbsp;

He finally
kneed me in the groin and then let me fall.�
Onto my knees first and then on my face, everything finally was a
jumbled, pulsing netherworld after that.�
I slammed into the ground, the impact taking the breath out of me.� More blows landed on my back and kidneys,
forcing me into a fetal position.�
Suddenly, my bladder cut loose and I was lying in a warm pool of urine.� Sound pooled around me and congealed to
distant noise.� His voice.� Violent words.� A kicking foot and a banging door.� My body was a wet cocoon, upside down,
hanging from my feet.� All the blood
rushed to my head.� It must have been
there because I could hear it flowing through my ears.� A loud roar, dashing me against a rocky
shore.� But someone�s breath was in my
face.� Someone was breathing for me.� Trying to anchor me, but I just wanted to
float.� To disappear in the dark where it
was safe.� And after that I died, but
it�s nothing I hadn�t felt before.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I'd beaten the crap out of her, but I wanted to humiliate this
woman now, show her what a worthless piece-of-shit value she represented to
me.� I let her lay in her piss on the
floor as I pondered; suddenly the perfect punishment came to mind.� It wasn't something I often did because it
was so extreme, but she deserved it.� I
walked over to the wall where I stored many of my toys, picked up two and
carried them back to Rebecca.� I dragged
her out of the urine, then rolled her onto her back after I cuffed her wrists
behind her.� 

&nbsp;

She was still semi-conscious
and took deep, almost snoring breaths.� I
captured the base of her left breast with one of my toys.� It was very much like the nylon, self-locking
wire-and-cable binding devices enthusiastically adopted by the police as
�plastic handcuffs.�� But mine were made
of half-inch wide blued steel which had loops on one end.� I put the locking slide at the bottom of her
left breast and pulled it taut against her flesh, the ring at the end of the
wire sticking out to the right from under her tit.� The way I'd fastened it, once I'd looped it
over her tit and tightened it, there was no way she could get it off by
herself.� The flat metal cut too deeply
into the flesh, and you had to actually see the slide in order to figure out
how to release it.� 

&nbsp;

I'd experimented on a few
cunts with this toy, and to a woman, when I put the slide on the bottom of
their tit like this, they couldn't get at it to release it no matter how much
they might pull their breasts away from it.�
In fact, that was always part of the fun, uncuffing their hands at the
end so that they could try to free themselves from the horrendous pain in their
breasts.� Also, I generally I locked the
slide after I'd tightened it.� If I
didn't, the women could easily continue tightening this thing on themselves
without meaning to as they fought its steely embrace.� 

&nbsp;

I'd pulled it so tight on
Rebecca's tit that the breast was already misshapen, forming in the end not
much more than a bulging sack of flesh with a nipple on the end.� I'd �bagged� some of the women that I
brought home before, but tended not to take it too far, because I never could
tell which ones had implants.� Besides,
even though I was a leg man, I knew I could really fuck up a good looking pair
of tits by doing this, and most women didn't deserve it.� 

&nbsp;

This bitch did.

&nbsp;

The metal loop had
disappeared into her skin, but I hadn't locked the slide in place.� After I bagged her left tit, I did the
right.� She still hadn't moved, and
within a couple of minutes, both her gorgeous breasts had turned into nothing
but good-sized balloons of flesh slowly turning purple in color.� We'd both see exactly how sensitive her
nipples were when they were tagged and bagged like this.� After I locked the loops together on the end
of the metal bands to form one ring, I dragged my new woman by her hair over to
the pulley set in the ceiling.� I ran a
rope through the pulley, then tied it to the loop that connected the wires
around her breasts.� Rebecca was moaning
softly now.� I helped the school teacher
to her feet by pulling on a handful of hair.�
When she finally stood swaying in front of me, I pulled on the rope and
within fifteen seconds, Rebecca had been lifted onto her tiptoes by only her
beautiful breasts.� The metal loops were
pulled even tighter around her breasts as I tied the tit rope off, then stood
back and watched.

&nbsp;

She was back in my world
now as she dazedly attempted to hop on her toes for a second.� The more weight she put on the rope when she
sagged, the tighter the loops encircled her breasts.� And since I'd put the slide on the bottom of
her tits, there was an added bonus.� The
more weight she put on them, the more they pulled her tits in a rotating motion
toward the center of her chest and then up from the bottom.� She was in agony now and actually danced from
foot to foot as she whinnied in pain, like an animal.� I'd wanted to hear her beg, so I hadn't used
a gag.� She made a long, high pitched
moaning scream that didn't seem like it could come from a human throat.� Then she squirmed and wiggled for a second
and screamed again.� 

&nbsp;

Suddenly, she was
desperately trying to pretend she was a ballerina, dancing on the tips of her
toes, even as she made wet, terrible gasping sounds that were wrenched from
deep within her chest.� We both knew
going up on her toes was the only way to lessen the horrendous pressure that
had pulled her breasts into such ugly and unnatural shapes.� Her feet were spread about a foot apart now,
the best compromise for maximum balance and height; her head and shoulders were
thrown back and her chest and hips thrust forward in the awkward but necessary
counterpoise required to maintain her balance, yet still apply the minimal
pressure to her tits.� Her beautiful legs
quivered with her efforts, calves and thighs exquisitely emphasized by the taut
lines of muscles that played under her skin.

&nbsp;

Her eyes were closed and
even though she had to be in agony, her face was gray and frozen in a
semi-grimace at the moment, suddenly full of lines and angles that hadn't been
there a hour ago, let alone a day ago.�
Her lips were dry and she was constantly licking them, but even so she
couldn't speak coherently.� I could hear
Rebecca mumbling, her lips in constant motion as she spoke to herself, trying I
guess, to convince herself that she could handle this too.� But I wasn't finished.

&nbsp;

I walked over to the corner
and picked up the belt to which she'd already been introduced.� I slowly walked around her.� Then I stood to the side and whipped her ass
and lower back for the next two or three minutes.� Her cuffed hands writhed with each blow and
Rebecca cried out as I used the belt hard enough to make her body swing with
each blow.� Other than an initial cry of
pain each time she was hit, the woman was almost silent as she twisted and
danced on her toes about the stabilizing rope from which she hung by her
breasts and upon which her whole life was now centered.

&nbsp;

I'd lost any sense of anger
I might have felt; I felt nothing inside as I disciplined her for bad
behavior.� No anticipation, no anger, no
bitterness or disappointment, no sadness---there was literally nothing
there.� I was methodical, professional,
unrelenting; treating her beating as if it were a sad necessity, as if this
were something that had to be done during the normal training of a domesticated
animal; it was how you would teach obedience to a recalcitrant bitch retriever.

&nbsp;

The only sounds to be heard
now were soft sobs; she still hadn't uttered a word.� By this point, four narrow trickles of blood
thinned with serous fluid was leaking down onto her belly, one from each of the
punctured sides of her breasts.� This
didn't surprise me because by now her breasts looked like large, dark-colored
party balloons; the skin of her tits expanded and stretched beyond human
endurance.� The flesh looked finely
porous and tender, almost porcelainous, seemingly ready to literally explode
under the immense pressure it somehow contained.� I ran my thumbnail over the skin of her
breasts, then roughly flicked each nipple.�
She didn�t make a sound, but shudders ran through her body with each
touch.� 

&nbsp;

When I got to the front
again, I grabbed her shoulder and gave her a spin.� Rebecca screamed once more as she struggled
to keep her feet spread for balance as she spun around the rope that kept her
upright.� 

&nbsp;

I was ready once she
stopped moving.� The muscles of her legs
quivered as I touched her body.� I ran my
hands over her shaved vagina and then her ass.�
Her head was thrown back in agony and her jaws clenched.� She was making a quick, wet grunting noise
each time she exhaled, �nugh, nugh, nugh.��
But she hadn�t broken yet, hadn�t begged yet.� For a beautiful woman used to being treated
by men as if she were made of expensive Irish china, she was one tough
bitch.� 

&nbsp;

Her feet were still close
together, so I grabbed her hair to get her attention.� When she was finally looking at me, I kicked
her right foot to the side to make her spread her legs.� She screamed from the increased pull on her
breasts, but she'd finally learned obedience.�
She finally stood motionless, positioned exactly as I wanted.� I slowly ran my hand between her thighs one
more time and played for a second with the folds of naked, sweaty skin
there.� I put two fingers inside Rebecca
and unsurprisingly, she was dry; her position couldn't feel particularly erotic
right now.� Then I used a bowling ball
grip and pulled her hips and belly towards me for a second, before I let
go.� I left Rebecca hanging and walked
into my bedroom, picked up some lubricant and returned to the beautiful woman
I'd just bagged, the beautiful
woman that hung in front of me, helpless as she hung from her tits.

&nbsp;

I still hadn't said a word
to her while all of this was happening, and didn't really feel like it
now.� But perhaps a few words were
appropriate.�� 

&nbsp;

�You stupid, stupid
woman.� You just don't get it.� You are not leaving here until you're
ready.� And even someone as stupid as you
can't believe that that time has come.�
Keep your legs spread.�
Further.� You always keep your
legs spread for men, any men.� You're a
woman, that's what you do.�

&nbsp;

Rebecca's shocking blue
eyes were mere slits as I stroked her cunt slowly and softly one more
time.� She hung motionless now, her body
quivering all over now.� After a moment
of stroking the soft, wet parts, I had a good hard-on and was ready to go.� I stripped as Rebecca stood there stiffly,
compliantly; moving only as necessary.� I
was already hard, so it was just a matter of a few seconds to apply lubricant
and step up to the plate, so to speak.� I
hit the ball out of the park on my first thrust, sliding slickly into her until
my belly slammed into hers.� Such a sweet
willing thing as she allowed me to fuck her brains out one more time.� 

&nbsp;

At first it was like doing
hips thrusts against a heavy punching bag.�
I moved into her and her body swung back helplessly, always putting more
tension on her tits.� I finally grabbed
her ass with both hands and pulled her into me as I thrust.� That worked better for me, but hurt her more
as it put her tits under even greater pressure.�
Is it as good for you as it is for me, I wanted to ask.� Back and forth, in and out, up and down---it
was all good.� I didn't much care right
now how I hurt the rebellious cunt at this point.

&nbsp;

I could see her bite her
lips in agony as I plowed her pussy.� She
never moved to avoid me, instead just standing there perfectly still, accepting
my meat with legs spread as I pounded away at her pussy and grabbed her
ass.� Finally, I reached around and stuck
my middle finger up her ass as far as I could and pulled her towards me this
way.� She had to learn that this was all
that bad little girls were good for; being cock-fucked and finger-fucked
whenever their master wanted a piece.� 

&nbsp;

My hands full of her firm
ass again, I pulled her towards me with each move of my hips and belly.� The rope remained taut as she went up on the
tips of her toes again and again to accept my lunging thrusts.� Her swollen breasts were pushed up hard
against me now as I hugged her close and finished our sex with a frenzy of
slams into her body.� Rebecca screamed
one more time as her hips rocked forward, pulling the loops even tighter; she
was off-balance and only her bound breasts held her upright now.� I knew that her tits had to be numb as I
pulled her against me, rubbing my body along the full length of hers.� I began cumming and grabbed her sweet ass
cheeks to pull her sweaty belly even harder against me one last time.� 

&nbsp;

After I'd cum, I left her
hanging, her strong legs spread wide, painted nails in shocking contrast
against toes gone white and bloodless from trying to hold up her body's
weight.� Go on a diet, bitch, I
thought to myself.� Her head was still
thrown back, her eyes still closed and jaw clenched.� The only change was that her lips moved
silently now as she prayed.� I grabbed
Rebecca's nose ring and pulled her head forward so I could look into her
face.� I said, �Look at me, woman.�

&nbsp;

She finally opened her eyes
a little and looked at me.� Her lids were
slitted, eyes filled with pain; she hadn't said anything to me yet, but at
least I knew somebody was home.� She
licked her dry lips again.

&nbsp;

�You,� I said, �had better
understand one thing.� You're here
because I want you here.� But the thing
is, I don't NEED you here.� Don't
mistake desire for weakness.� The next
time you try anything like that, I'll bag you and leave you hanging like
this for a full day.�

&nbsp;

She didn't answer.� The only sound in the room was her heavy
panting breath and that of the rope creaking as it stretched slightly under her
weight.

&nbsp;

�If I do that to you, I'll
have to get rid of you afterwards.� Now
that would give me a little pleasure, but it would also be a damn shame to
waste a good-looking piece of meat like you.�
But I'll do it if I have to and if you push me to it----are we clear?�

&nbsp;

Rebecca nodded her head
weakly, then closed her eyes.

&nbsp;

�You see,� I continued,
�the thing is, I don't want to have to do that.�
I would much prefer not having to hurt you like this.� But if you change the situation, then you've changed
the situation; and when I've been forced to fuck you up too much because of
what you've done, then I no longer need to keep you around.�

&nbsp;

�Do you understand me?� I
asked harshly.

&nbsp;

My beautiful captive
silently nodded her understanding.

&nbsp;

�Do you believe me?�
I demanded of the bound woman.� 

&nbsp;

Again, she gave a quick nod
of understanding as she whispered, �Yes....Master.�

&nbsp;

�Good.�� After a further moment of silence, I walked
over to where I had tied the rope off on the wall.� I asked, �Are we going to be a good girl
now?�

&nbsp;

Rebecca was still silent as
she nodded her head quickly a couple of times.�
Huge visible tremors ran through her thighs and knees as I untied the
rope, then let go suddenly.� Rebecca's
legs buckled; a human puppet whose strings had been cut.� She collapsed into a pool on the floor,
silently, gracefully, efficiently---inexorably.�
It was as if someone had removed every bone in her body.� 

&nbsp;

She lay partially on her
right side.� I waited a moment and
listened to her soft, evenly spaced sobs, then rolled her onto her hip and
removed the handcuffs.� Her hands now
free, I rolled her onto her back.� Her
misshapen egg-plant colored breasts stood up defiantly, the golden nipple rings
literally glowing in the angry, swollen flesh.�
Most of the women that I'd bagged in the past had immediately
cradled their aching breasts, desperately trying to release the pressure.� But not Rebecca.� Her right arm was still partially pinned
against the floor under her back and hips; she didn't have the strength to pull
it free.� 

&nbsp;

I slowly lifted each breast
and undid the loop that bound it.� Cruel
red rings had been cut by the metal deeply into the flesh at the base of each
breast; and even though now unbound, her tits were still discolored and hugely
expanded, over-filled with trapped blood that had not yet had time to be re-absorbed.

&nbsp;

Her left hand twitched, but
never left her side.� Rebecca moaned once
and began a small back and forth rocking motion; it was clear that circulation
had begun to return to her breasts.� Her
pink tongue appeared as she licked her lips one more time.� Eyes shut tightly, she was however finally
able to speak. Rebecca whispered something so softly that I could not make it
out.� I leaned over and put my ear next
to her mouth as I ordered her to repeat herself.� She whispered again in a soft, dry begging
voice, �Please.� Master.� Can I go back in the box now?� 

&nbsp;

I kicked her side and hips
casually three or four times and pushed her with my foot until she was able to
gather enough strength to roll over onto her stomach and climb up onto her
hands and knees.� I watched her slowly
crawl across the room from the back and could see the first semen draining out
of her vagina onto the insides of her thighs.�
Her bruised and aching breasts drooped towards the floor as she crawled,
hanging down much further than normal.�
Her breath rattled harshly in her throat as the beautiful, arrogant
Rebecca slowly, painfully crawled back to her makeshift coffin.� I gave her naked ass one more contemptuous
kick with my foot as she climbed inside to wrap herself in its dark, cold
comfort.� 

&nbsp;

Rebecca lay on her back in
the coffin, both breasts cradled in her hands.�
Her eyes were closed and she was rocking back and forth, crooning to
herself.� I looked down and said, �Who
does your ass belong to woman?�

&nbsp;

She stopped the rocking
motion and lay still for a second.� �It
belongs to you,� she finally answered.� 

&nbsp;

�Say it the again.� Say it the way I want to hear it,� I
commanded again.

&nbsp;

�My ass belongs to you,
Master.�� 

&nbsp;

�And your tits?� I
continued.

&nbsp;

�My breasts belong to you,
Master.� I belong to you.� Everything belongs to you, Master.�

&nbsp;

I shut the lid and locked
it.� I heard the crooning start up again,
then suddenly there were soft sobs as she cried.� She was mine and would soon know it in every fiber of her
being.� 

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I remember
crawling back to my box and the blessed darkness, then nothing.� But now somebody was stroking my hair with
icy fingers.� I opened my eyes to a dim
white light from near the bed casting shadows over me.� Somehow, at sometime, I vaguely remembered
him taking me out of my box and putting me on the bed.� The room was cold and white and it felt like
Santa�s Workshop�.the place where a wicked little elf waited to pound me into
someone�s toy.� At the same time, it felt
like a morgue too because of the silence and the chilled air.� And I found that I was still naked except for
my collar, but the pain was a multitude of sharp fists pushing into my body,
all over from the neck down.� 

&nbsp;

He gave me
drugs.� I felt them as they sailed
through my system, hydroplaning, but they didn�t last long enough to make me
sleep.� I couldn�t move.� I tried to lift a hand, it twitched and the
sheet fell open, my right hand always cuffed to the head of the bed.� The frosty air against my skin made the
swollen areas around my bruises come alive.�
I lay there for what seemed hours, feeling the blood rush through my
skull and the burning throb from my breasts and kidneys and bruises along my
back.� Occasionally, a muscle spasm would
cause me to straighten in pain.

&nbsp;

My breath
sounded loud.� After a moment, I realized
that I was crying.

&nbsp;

The most
useless thing.� 

&nbsp;

But it must
have been the pain and the drugs, because it passed, like everything.

&nbsp;

The door
from his bedroom banged open, throwing light over me in shards.� I squinted.�
It shut, and footsteps approached.�
A man�s voice said, �You�re awake.�
Good.� That makes everything
easier.�� 

&nbsp;

He gripped
my shoulder.� I couldn�t help
myself.� I flinched and jerked to the
side, uncontrolled, one flop like a fish.�
The movement kicked me in the gut.�
All movement was nothing more than extended abuse.� He unlocked my wrist and then made me sit up
on the edge of the bed.� I tried to say
something but my voice was raw, my words like little icicles, falling to the
floor.� Shattering in syllables. �He leaned down, grabbed my arm and tugged on
me to stand up.� Instead I ended up
slumped against his shoulder, his hand gripping the back of my hair to get my
face away from his neck.� And I
recognized his clean male scent.� 

&nbsp;

He pulled me
off the bed and my legs tangled.� Blood
ran down my legs, but from the inside this time, swirling circulation and pain
through my nerve endings.� He yanked me
to my feet anyway, holding me up.� His
grip around my chest found the hard aching grooves of my ribs, pain washing
through me as he did so.� They were so
tender where he'd kicked me that it felt like he could have just reached in and
touched my guts, poking all my life away.�


&nbsp;

Struggling
with my near dead-weight, he planted my hands on the side of the bed and I felt
the edge against my shins.� I shook, but
stayed standing even though I couldn�t much sense my legs.� Finally, he led me over to the cycling
machine.� I tried to lift my feet so that
I didn�t walk like so much of a cripple.�
He forced me to sit on it.� I grasped
the handle bars and looked at him mutely, my body aching in the quiet of the
room.� He just looked at me in
silence.� 

&nbsp;

I knew that
I could sit here with my pain pooling at my feet and refuse to move.� If I had enough courage, I could have made
him kill me now or maybe the next time, and maybe that�s the right fate for
piled on months and years of mistakes.� I
should, I could, but at the same time, my mind asked, if he'd wanted me, why
hadn�t he come and stopped me years ago?�
Stopped me from doing what I'd done, becoming what I had become.

&nbsp;

But I knew
that I never could face up to him again in that way.� My courage was gone; gasoline poured on it
and burned to the ground.� He was so
quietly confident as he stared; it was then that I had an epiphany---we both
knew he would win, just not when.� We
were both aware that I would fight him in this, but also that he would always
be willing to go so much further in his actions than me.� 

&nbsp;

There was no
fight left in me and soon I started to cycle, leaning forward onto the handle
bars, legs moving slower than you would expect from a cadaver.� 

&nbsp;

A slave has
to follow her exercise routine, don�t you know?

&nbsp;

****

&nbsp;

I looked at
myself in the mirror.� I moved slowly,
carefully, too worried about breaking something if I moved more swiftly.� My face was unblemished, and although
encircled with angry red lines and still aching, my breasts were unbruised; but
my body below the neck collar felt a hundred years old, a landscape of orange
and green and blue.� I saw the golden
rings hanging permanently from the tips of my breasts and the one through my
nose.� They caught the light as I
turned.� It had been a week and a half
since the piercings and I still was not used to the sight.� The inside of my right leg burned.� Stiffly, I reached down and parted myself
there to look at his mark of ownership.�
Much of the crusty black was gone now, the moist pink underneath freed
of any cooked debris...he had cleaned me there while I was unconscious.� 

&nbsp;

I gently
felt the rings through my tits, then cupped my breasts and cradled them in both
hands.� They were tender, feeling much
warmer than the rest of me.� There was no
seepage now from where I'd been pierced, but I knew they were still
infected---I needed to continue the antibiotics for a little while longer.� I was still incredibly sore from the beating
he'd given me and my insides hurt.� When
I first staggered to the bathroom after my beating, I discovered my urine was a
dark brown color.� He'd bruised my
kidneys.� 

&nbsp;

That was the
last time that I overtly and aggressively challenged his mastery.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

It's been
over a week and a half since I took his collar, three days after my
beating.� He seemed less angry now as I
began my formal training.� He told me
what would be involved; how to walk, how to talk, how to look at him or any
other man, and more importantly, how not to look at another man.� How to serve him food and how not to bring
him a drink; both tiptoes and clenching.�
How to put on makeup and what is too much or not enough, how he likes my
hair and what are my best colors.� Not
one facet of my life seemed too small for him to have either an opinion or a
demand. 

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I was lying in my bed
facing the wall.� &quot;OK, you
rebellious whore.� We do it my way
tonight,&quot; I heard from behind me.� I
could barely move, but rolled over anyway and looked up to find his cock
staring me in the face.� I didn't know
what he meant, we always did it 'his way'.�
&quot;Lick it, baby.� Get it nice
and wet, the wetter it is, the less it gonna hurt,&quot; he said to me with
obvious satisfaction.� Full of fear,
tongue suddenly dry, I opened my mouth and obeyed.� I began to use my tongue on his purple shiny
knob, and although my mouth was dry as the Mohave desert, I worked up all the
saliva I could and soon his cock was wet enough for him.

&nbsp;

I felt myself being rolled
over and my hips lifted, then suddenly he slammed into me from behind.� He had me on all fours and I was mounted like
a dog, taken from behind like I was a bitch in heat.� He plunged into me like a mad man, grunting
and panting like a dog.� The shock of his
attack was wearing off.� I shook my head
and screamed, then began to struggle.� I
fought, wiggled, tried to crawl forward to get away from him.� 

&nbsp;

His huge cock was
penetrating my vagina deeper than any man had ever before.� He was hurting me so much that I screamed and
bucked and fought him.....but nothing could save me.� His hand went around my neck and pressed from
the side.� Suddenly, I felt weak, and
nothing mattered anymore; it was all I could do was stay on all fours.� He rammed into me until he suddenly pulled
back on my hips and jammed himself up against my cervix.� I felt him begin to cum inside me.� A huge, burning hot gush of sperm filled my
vagina, then squirted back between the ravaged walls of my pussy and his
erection.� But nothing seemed urgent to
me.� I felt weirdly lethargic and I was
dimly aware of my thoughts; this can't be happening.� My God, why me?� I'm going to be pregnant.

&nbsp;

I heard faint squirting and
gurgling sounds as it flooded out of me.�
My body hurt everywhere and I'd almost passed out from the pain,
remaining on my hands and knees only because of his tight grip on my hips.� Then I felt wonderful relief as he slowly
pulled his throbbing, still hard cock out of my bleeding vagina.� I collapsed on the bed, but he still kept my
hips raised in the air.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I looked down on the limp,
semi-conscious cunt-bitch.� As I held her
up by her hips with my left hand, I looked at her pussy.� I looked at the wet-pink, gaping hole as cum
and pussy juice leaked out and ran down the inside of her thighs.� Then I looked at her gorgeous ass and thought
to myself, why not?� Every other part of
her body belonged to me too.� Why not
this too?� And she deserved it.� My cock was still slick from her pussy, so I
slowly moved until my re-hardening tool just about touched my slut's rear
door.� I stroked myself and waited until
the anticipation of the next fuck had me hard....then using my right hand as a
guide, I lunged forward.� My cock slammed
into her wrinkled rosy-brown hole, and opened it until there was nothing but a
tight pink circle stretched around the head of my circumsized rod.� 

&nbsp;

I was only partially inside
Rebecca when she went berserk.� My left
hand was wrapped around her belly and I grabbed a handful of hair with my
right.� Even though she continued
fighting me, it was easy to dominate her with these points of control.� She had a tight hole and I knew I was hurting
her.� She scrambled wildly beneath me,
pawing at the sheets in an attempt to get away from what she� knew I was trying to shove inside her.� Finally, I'd had enough of her violent
resistance and with one move of my hips, I drove Rebecca off of her knees and
flat on her belly.� As she hit the
mattress, I continued driving with my hips and pushed even harder, finally
popping through the cunt's sphincter and ramming myself up her ass, burying all
8 inches of wrist thick cock in her rectum.�
I had drilled her ass totally, completely, absolutely.� 

&nbsp;

Rebecca's head snapped up
and a blood curdling scream ripped through the White Room.� I held on tight as she bucked and fought,
clawing the bed like mare in heat as she tried her best to escape the burning,
ripping pain in her ass.� It must have
felt like she was being raped by a baseball bat.� I was sheathed in heaven up to my nutsack,
and while my new playmate may still dispute my right to occupy her body for a
little while longer, there was nothing she could do now to stop me.� She could react, but not prevent.� She screamed again and her arms and legs
flailed about as she tried to gain purchase on the bed and climb back up on her
hands and knees in order to buck me off.�


&nbsp;

I could hear myself
grunting as I lunged into her hyper-stretched anus again and again.� I'd already cum once, so we both knew she was
in for a long ride this time.� Rebecca
screamed and struggled for five minutes, but I easily controlled her bruised
and beaten body.� I kept my weight
balanced on her back and Rebecca's struggles eventually grew weaker and
weaker.� After four or five minutes, the
pain must have lessened or she was exhausted, because I was able to take
everything I wanted.� I was in ecstasy,
but Rebecca's only reactions now were a few gasps or groans.� A shudder would run through her body every
now and then after a particularly vicious or deep push into her rectum.� 

&nbsp;

She begged and cried, but I
felt no mercy---I WANTED her this way.�
All she could do at the end was lower her sobbing eyes onto her folded
arms and let me have my way with her---as if she could have stopped me
anyway.� Her head snapped up once again
as she gasped in pain.� I could feel her
rectal muscles involuntarily strain as they tried to expel me.� This last was too much for me and I slammed
into Rebecca's sweet buttcheeks and began to pump one last load of sticky,
honey thick cum inside her body.

&nbsp;

At the end, I lay panting
on Rebecca's sweaty back.� She lay
stiffly with her forehead resting on her left forearm as she sobbed
softly.� When I finally had my breath
back, my shrinking cock had already slid out of her still tight asshole.� I wanted her to know how much I had
appreciated her offering.� I leaned down
and pulled the hair away from her neck and kissed her softly, tenderly,
gratefully.� Rebecca shook her head
weakly, trying to deny me any satisfaction I might have obtained from her
body.� But we both knew she belonged to
me now.� 

&nbsp;

I was finally sated.� At least for tonight.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I lay on the
bed afterwards and all I could think was, how dare he?� How dare he do these things to me?� 

&nbsp;

And here he was
again.� What was it, ten or fifteen times
that he'd raped or sodomized me?�
Twenty?� Thirty?� 

&nbsp;

You bastard,
you seem to enjoy this.� You about killed
me this time.� You�ve gotten better at
keeping me your captive, at working me through your training. �You clearly don't want me.� You want a caricature of me.� No more, I told me.� No more would I cooperate in any way.� In the thundering silence of my mind, I told
myself time after time that I'd yield to no more physical coercion, physical or
sexual blackmail would no longer be a threat.�
But you've changed somehow.� A
week or ten days ago, I could fool you with my �cooperation�.� But not now---somehow you�ve learned, you
know me too well.� Even so, I warn you,
by God.� You'd better take me
seriously.� One day you'll forget to
cover yourself, or to restrain me tightly enough, or lock enough of your locks
to stop me.� And when that happens,
you'll find out what a sneaky, devious bitch I can be.� But for now, I have to go along with your
game.� But I warn you, let me get free
once and you'll not be sleeping too well afterwards.

&nbsp;

I'd said
nothing to him, nothing aloud.� I felt
sick to my stomach with my looming defeat.�
Stop kidding yourself, I screamed inside.� Somehow, even then, I knew I was whistling in
the dark as I walked past the death of my future, my hopes, my dreams.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

It was the weekend and she was still suffering from my
beating.� I continued boxing Rebecca
during the day and training her at night.�
Part of it was professional; I knew she still ached everywhere, but I
had no sympathy.� It might have seemed
merciless to some, but she needed the discipline.� And part of it was practical; I had her on
the ropes and couldn't afford to give her time to recover.� 

&nbsp;

I noticed that by now the stubble had grown out to an alarming
degree on her body, so I ordered her to shave the next morning when showering
after her morning workout.� I shouldn't
have had to do this...but it was one of her less subtle ways of fighting me.� As Rebecca assumed a submissive posture in
front of me after exercise and her shower, but before being fed breakfast the
next morning, I ran my hands over her body in the asexual way that a furrier
might use to check out a horse after he�d shoed it.� It was then that I discovered that her legs,
underarms and between her legs were grained like coarse sand on a beach...she
said she'd forgotten.

&nbsp;

Ordering her to stand at attention, I walked behind her and
without warning put Rebecca in a painful wrist lock that forced her up on her
toes.� She cried out once in surprise and
pain, but said nothing.� I asked her why
she had disobeyed me; she just closed her eyes and just shook her head; we both
knew there was no satisfactory explanation.�
Realizing this, she finally begged me for my forgiveness; it would never
happen again, she promised.� But I
frog-marched her over to the equipment corner and handcuffed her wrists behind
her back.� Once she was bound, I removed
her slave collar and replaced it with a heavy, three inch wide punishment
collar made from thick leather.� This
collar forced her chin up and reduced head movement to a fraction of
normal.� Next, I clipped a thin chain to
her left breast ring and ran it up through her nose ring.� I pulled it tight enough that her chin was
forced down firmly against the punishment collar and then clipped it to her
right breast ring.� Eyes tearing in pain,
she stood absolutely still waiting for me to finish.� She was a beautiful sight; chin down against
the discipline collar, the tips of both breasts pulled up slightly by the chain
that went through her nose ring.� 

&nbsp;

Once I knew that she had accepted her new collar, I dragged the
beautiful woman over by the door that led to the outside patio.� Here I had leaning against the wall a three
by three foot square plastic tray with one-inch wide turned-up edges.� I was sure that she'd noticed the tray, but
I'd given her little opportunity or incentive to explore and she apparently had
thought nothing of it.� I pushed her to
the side and laid the tray on the floor.�
As she faced the wall, I picked up the small plastic bag had been on the
floor behind the tray and emptied about half a pound of uncooked white rice
onto the tray.� I then grabbed the woman
by her hair and after I positioned her with her back to the corner, I forced
her to kneel on the rice.� 

&nbsp;

She gasped in pain and began a weak struggle to get to her
feet.� Taking care to not rip out her
nose ring, I grabbed her hair and forced her to her knees again.� As she continued to fight me, I lifted my
hand to slap her face; she closed her eyes and quickly stopped struggling.� If I'd slapped her with the taut chain going
through her nose ring and then to her breasts, it probably would have torn the
ring right through her nose cartilage.�
When no blow came, Rebecca finally opened her eyes and looked
beseechingly at me.

&nbsp;

As I looked at her face, I could see her eyes tearing up
again.� Christ, she had turned out to be
a weepy woman.� �Now,� I said.� �Learn to obey.� You act like you�re a volunteer in this and
can quit any time, but I warned you---you gave up everything when you walked
through that door.�

&nbsp;

Now my tone became more commanding.� �Put your knees together.� Tighter!� I finally yelled as she slowly
complied, her face wincing as her knees scraped over the loose rice.� �This is for not shaving.� And this is how you'll always find yourself
when you need�.the lighter punishments.�
Always.� Is there anything about
this that you don�t understand?� I asked.�


&nbsp;

Since her escape attempt,
I had increased my discipline over minor infractions.� She was a tough bitch and I knew that her
first tears were not from pain---not much yet anyway, but rather more from
anger and frustration; and the humiliation of being treated like a young child.� She couldn't know yet that once I'd moved
past my initial anger at her stupidity of a few days ago, I valued her as an
object with great potential; but currently possessing the abilities of a
novice, at best.� And although she was of
magnificent promise, she still was nothing but feminine flesh that needed to be
shaped and trained and guided�one whose previous beliefs and values needed to
be completely exposed before I could replace them with something that was more
pleasing to me.� 

&nbsp;

And yet�..and yet she
needed to be protected at the same time.�
Even as I used the legitimate authority and control I had usurped to
critique the �old� Rebecca, allowing
me to softly remove the thickly armored layers of her mind's defenses one thin
rind at a time, I also hoped to gently awaken the potential of which she was
unaware.� This, of course, was until she
pissed me off.� Then all bets were off
until I was cool again.

&nbsp;

She had no way of knowing that as her Top, I had originally
planned on keeping her on her knees for about fifteen minutes as a first-time
punishment.� I knew that the rice was a
little uncomfortable; a superficial pain at first, one that initially didn�t
seem too bad.� I also knew that it would
in a short time assume an almost delicate, yet superbly intense level of pain
that was suitable for training even the most obstinate woman without serious
injury.� It all depended upon her
attitude.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I looked at him from a
distance and a rogue wave of childish, un-ironic longing for my old life
suddenly welled up in me, rushing over me from I didn't know where and swamping
me with melancholy before I was ready for it.�
God, what was wrong with me?� All
at once, I was overcome with by self-pity---I was just embarrassed, but I couldn't
stop it, I just had to let it happen.�
Empty tears washed down my cheeks.�
For the past few months with my husband and my job, it had seemed like
time was standing still, but now it was rushing past me with gale-force speed,
like the wind from an atom bomb that tore down everything and whirled the
pieces off to parts unknown, palm trees, roof tiles and all.

&nbsp;

In the days and weeks and
months to come, I would look back at these earliest moments of my new
life.� I would remember the quality of
the light in the White Room, the copper metallic taste of blood in my mouth
from where I'd bitten the inside of lip, the full blossom of pain my breasts; I
would wonder how different things might have been had I made the harder choice
to face the freezing rain that night, rather than stay.� If I had played my life by the rules and not
thought that I could do anything I wanted.

&nbsp;

I shook my head silently in
answer, openly crying now as I knelt on the rice.� The pain had become exquisitely intertwined
with every bone and muscle in my body.�
How could this hurt so much?� Why
was this happening to me? I asked myself.�
I wasn�t a bad person�.I'd done some things that I sincerely
regretted, but hadn�t we all?� I�d drank
a lot when I was younger, but I'd only been
drunk a few times in the last seven years.�
I didn�t do drugs anymore except for Extra Strength Tylenol when I had
especially bad period cramps.� I knew
that I was intelligent and probably a little smarter than the average.� I knew that I was pretty and not beautiful,
and that I liked small animals, especially cats.� In other words, I felt I was pretty normal;
so why me?� Why had he picked me?� My whole future hung like a
dead weight around my neck, dragging me downward.� I had so
much more left to experience----why was it that MY life had to be over and not
someone else's?� I only had one life to live, and I wanted it to be---it had to be
something else, something other than this.�
Terror surged inside me.

&nbsp;

I couldn't let him see how
close he was to winning.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

She was learning, but I needed still more from her.� My head hurt; it felt as if someone were
sawing it in half from the inside.� I
pushed the pain to the back of my mind and focused on function.� I was still angry.� I needed to finish getting her on the bed,
then get the equipment ready.� I was
going to hurt her for the next couple of hours and looked forward to seeing how
she took it.� The two inserts and the air
tank, they all promised an enjoyable evening.�
In only another couple of minutes, she was finally ready; bound and
exposed the way I wanted.� The evenings'
entertainment was about to begin and I was feeling pretty fucking functional
again.

&nbsp;

The rice punishment had only worked for a few minutes; she'd
quickly become her old feisty self again and things had become a little
physical when I put her on the bed.� The
right side of her face was red and might bruise.� The back of my right hand hurt where I'd had
to backhand the bitch to get a little cooperation.� I sucked on my knuckles.� I was a little pissed it'd gone this far and
felt a subtle satisfaction in what I had in store for her.

&nbsp;

I got a lot of pleasure using the old low-tech ways; tried and
proven over thousands of years.� But I
had to admit, some of the newer equipment opened up totally new avenues for
fucking the ladies.� I called these two
beauties Hector and Manuel, the �air pimps.�� They were air pimps because they ran on air
and once they had a woman, they owned her ass.......body AND soul.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

The chain
running from my nipples through my nose ring was gone, but it was still
difficult to breathe because of my position.�
I wanted to be angry, but it had happened too quickly and I hurt too
much.� My hips were in agony.� I was naked and bent double.� I'd fought him until he hit me and almost
knocked me out.� My wrists and elbows
were tied below my hips to the sides of the bed and my feet had been forced up
by my ears then spread wide before being tied to the bed frame.� I was helpless, my buttocks raised off the
mattress and my vagina open and exposed; offered to the world as if in some
sort of pagan ritual.� 

&nbsp;

I shook my
head in horror.� He held a black rubber
cone in his hand that was about five inches long and maybe two and a half
inches thick at the widest end.� From
there it narrowed to a thin flexible looking neck that was about one and a half
inches in diameter, then widened out again to a flat looking base plate that
was over three inches in diameter.� It
sort of resembled an arrow-head except that it was blunt on the thick end and
it was connected to a thin flexible line or hose that had a metal connection
and small gauge on the end.� The oddly
disturbing shape glistened with lubricant in the blindingly sterile light; the
thoughts of what he might do filled me with fear.� But nothing stopped him as he moved smoothly
to my hips and began to press it into my rear-end. 

&nbsp;

In horrified
understanding, I tried to fight him.� I
tried to wiggle my hips and said through my clenched teeth, �No.� NO.�
You can't do this---I forbid it!�
Noooo!�

&nbsp;

He looked at
me quickly, then started laughing.�
�There are some things you need to learn before we go much further.� Your ass is mine and I can do anything I want
to you.� Two; you are a fucking mobile
vagina, created specifically for my use.�
Finally, I don't always have a reason for doing something.� I do some things because I like to watch my
women handle the mind-fucks I give 'em.�

&nbsp;

�This,� he
said as he continued working on me, �is how we catch our breath between
acts.� No more training for now.� Enjoy.��
He looked at me and smiled.

&nbsp;

Sweat was
running down my face as I panted for air.�
My breath hissed through my clenched teeth as I begged him, �God.� Not that.�
It's too big, it's too big.�
Please, I beg you not...ughhhh...aaahhhHHHH!�� My begging quickly turned to moans and a
final cry of pain.� The continuous
pressure he applied was quickly sufficient as my already stretched and wearied
anal sphincter struggled for less than ten seconds before it completely
accepted everything he offered.� 

&nbsp;

I know I
howled as my anal ring stretched as it accepted the monster's fat end; my
screams were heartfelt and came from deep within my belly.� Then there was some relief as the plug was
pushed deeper inside me, allowing my sphincter to clamp down around the more
narrow neck of this hideous thing.� 

&nbsp;

But somehow
it wasn't really me that had this inside her body.� It must have been some other unlucky woman;
please God, let this be a dream---let it be another woman.� My prayers remained unanswered; this man was
doing terrible things to me all over again.�
The feeling in my bowels remained distant, yet immediate.� Far over-distended......I was his ass-candy;
I knew what it meant now and it was a violation with which I'd become
intimately acquainted.� I felt the
familiar onset of abdominal cramping, the never-ending, incredible heaviness
that heralded the need for an impending massive bowel movement.� My body wanted to, needed to push this thing
out of me, but my sphincter had locked onto it and refused to part again.� I bucked with my hips once as I tried to
move, but it hurt too much to do a second time.�


&nbsp;

�It's too
much, too soon.� Please, no more.� Please,� I begged him.

&nbsp;

He just
smiled as he reached down and picked up another black rubber piece.� His voice tried to be reassuring as he said,
�You'll learn to like it; you'll get used to it.� Trust me. �

&nbsp;

�Come
on......relax,� he smiled as he showed me what he held.� It looked like a hard black rubber
sausage.� It was about five inches long
and perhaps two inches wide; like the first piece, it too had a plastic tube
that ran from one end and which ended in a metal connection and small
gauge.� It too glistened in the light
with lubricant; he leaned over, separated my labia to expose me and began
pushing it into my vagina.� It felt huge
and I tried to clamp myself tight against him, but it hurt my rectum too much;
it was no use fight him.� He always
won.� God, it never did any good fighting
him.

&nbsp;

He ignored
me, never looking at me as he efficiently worked on my pelvis, always looking
down at his task, manipulating me, opening me.�
He'd greased his second tool enough that with his fingers separating me,
it went inside easily and disappeared.� I
looked down my belly in horror at the plastic tubing that exited my vagina,
then snapped my head back and closed my eyes as I prayed for a second.� 

&nbsp;

I began
begging him again.� �Please.� Master.�
It doesn't have to be this way.�
I'll be good.� I promise I'll obey
you.�� 

&nbsp;

He ignored
me as he lifted a small tank of compressed air onto the bed by my side.� Furious now, I began to rave and rant at him;
a move I came to regret.� My life was
like this now, almost schizophrenic in the emotional extremes I visited one
after another.� Docile and submissive one
second, furiously screaming threats at him the next, not caring what he did to
me.

&nbsp;

�You
bastard.� You crazy, fucking bastard.� I'll see you in jail for a hundred years for
this.� Let me go, you fucking maniac.�

&nbsp;

The air tank
had a rubber line running from it that ended in a Y, two separate lines; each
with its own metal ending.� Ignoring my
ranting, he methodically began connecting the two rubber hoses that ran from my
body to his container of compressed air.�
I ranted and raved as he did this, but for him it was like I didn't
exist.� Finally ready, he turned a small
valve on the tank and then the valve by the gage that connected the line to my
vagina.� I could hear the sound of
hissing air and suddenly feel the rubber bladder inside me begin to come to
life.� It writhed, then felt like it
turned somehow inside and began to expand.�


&nbsp;

�Soon,� he
smiled, �you're going to feel like grenades have just gone off in your pussy
and your ass at the same time.�

&nbsp;

�Oh God,
no.� No!��
I clenched my jaw and shook my head.�
�No.�

&nbsp;

Finally, it
was beyond my control.� I screamed as I
felt the muscles of my vagina begin to fight back against the foreign body now
filling me from the inside.� I began
struggling on the bed, but the way he'd tied me ensured I remained
helpless.� I finally had to stop fighting
just to breathe again.� The hiss of
pressurized air in motion continued however, and it had only one place to
go---inside me.� I could feel the rubber
changing once more as the compressed air gave birth to a new shape; in my
shocked mind, it went from the size of a tennis ball to suddenly feeling like a
bowling ball had somehow been pushed inside me.�
But the flow of air continued and the rubber bag changed shape once
again; the maximum length of what felt like six or seven inches had been
reached and now it began to expand in diameter.

&nbsp;

My mouth
open in a silent scream, I lay bound on the bed in shocked silence as he
stopped the flow of air and then gently, almost tenderly began to untie my
ankles from the terribly uncomfortable position in which I'd been bound.� My wrists and elbows were still tied to the
bed, but I could finally� breathe.� He carefully lowered one leg, then the other
onto the mattress and gently straightened them out a little.� I had to keep my knees raised and spread wide
just to accommodate the pain his massive toys caused between my legs.� There was no way I could close my legs, not
with what he'd pushed into my body.� 

&nbsp;

This can't
be happening, I thought to myself.� This
can't be real; it's wrong, its just not fair.�
Uncaring, he went back to the valve and opened it again.� 

&nbsp;

�Enough.� ENOUGH!�
That's too much already.� Stopstopstop.�� I couldn't help myself; I squealed in pain as
I felt my vaginal muscles gripping the rubber ball, grappling with it, fighting
it, but still yielding ever so slowly to its inexorable expansion.� It felt like my pelvis would explode.� I couldn't take anymore; I arched my back and
shut my eyes as I inhaled, then screamed as loud and long as I could.� 

&nbsp;

He just started
laughing......then gave me more air.� The
thing inside me was enormous now.� It
would literally rupture me if it grew any further. �I was speechless, gasping like a fish in the
bottom of a boat.� He finally shut the
air off and looked at me for what felt like an hour, but was probably only a
minute.

&nbsp;

�That my lovely Little
Slave, is how it feels to have a man's fist inside you.� You're going to learn to appreciate so many
more new sensations now that we're together.�

&nbsp;

He now switched his
attention from the line that came out of my pussy to the one that ran out of my
butt.� As he turned the valve open on
that line, I could feel the thing inside my rectum begin to grow.� It become longer, much longer and
thicker.� I screamed and screamed in
agony as it expanded.� The neck my anal
ring had grabbed, the thing that had seemed so huge before, now felt tiny by
comparison with what filled my bowels.�
Room for this monstrosity didn't exist inside me; I knew he would
rupture me.� My pelvis had already been
on the verge of cracking open, no human woman could contain both of these
things inside her.

&nbsp;

I think I must have passed
out for a second.� When I came to, my
vagina still� felt huge, swollen; but he
must have let out some of the air.� For
even though it was tender with a pain that radiated from center of my belly, I
didn't have the feeling of immanent rupture that I'd had before.

&nbsp;

I panted for air as I
looked at him incredulously; he looked into my eyes for a second and I could
see that his pupils were huge, making his eyes look almost black.� I felt I was looking into the eyes of a
shark; the perfect predator, a primitive organism that had no sense of right or
wrong, no feelings of mercy, just a need to do what it did---survive.� 

&nbsp;

Finally, he leaned over and
touched my belly.� I thought I could
actually see where this thing was pushing up against my abdominal wall.� He put his hand on me and pushed
lightly.� The sensations were
indescribable; horrific pain in my vagina, a bloated sense of pressure and
terrible pain in my rectum as both rubber pieces vied for room in spaces that
were not meant to accommodate either.� I
know that he took pleasure in my shocked expression, for he slowly smiled.� Finally, he moved away from my belly and a
tiny sense of relief washed through me.

&nbsp;

I raised my head and looked
at him in what could only be horrified wonderment as he picked up my left foot
and rubbed my calf and the inside of my knee.�
Then he leaned towards me as he caressed my arch and put the sole of my
foot against his cheek.� In one of those
memorably odd moments of perception when your mind is under total stress, I
noticed how the nail polish I wore showed beautifully against his skin.� I desperately wanted to kick him in the face,
but I couldn't move my legs.� I literally
felt paralyzed from the waist down from what he'd just done.� He looked confidently down on me.� He'd been too smooth, too quick.� He'd developed this expertise over time with
many other women; how to give me just exactly enough air to make my legs and
hips feel helpless, powerless to move, but not so much he caused permanent
damage. 

&nbsp;

Suddenly, he kissed the
sole of my foot, then my toes.� Finally,
he put my big toe in his mouth and began sucking on it softly.� He took my toe out of his mouth only long
enough to reach down and turn a final valve.�
Then he began to work on my toes again as he caressed my ankle and calf.

&nbsp;

�I'm a leg man,� he
said.� �I like my women to take care of
their feet.� I like sexy feet.� I want your skin soft, your nail polish
always perfect.� I expect continued
maintenance.� Is this going to be an
issue?�

&nbsp;

I shook my head wildly as I
guaranteed my cooperation.� I felt
suddenly exhausted after I'd laid there for another minute.� I could feel the thing in my vagina getting
smaller as air hissed free.� But it
didn't matter, the lassitude came on in an instant and floored me, like I'd
been idiotic enough to turn my back to the ocean and had ended up getting
flattened by a twelve-foot curl of breaking indolence.

&nbsp;

Soon, my pussy felt almost
empty, even though it was still full of this monster's loathsome thing.� It was only by comparison to what I had felt
before that I could feel so hollow and barren now.� But at the same time, the terrible thing in
my bowels seemed to be growing even larger.�
I began crying as it reached a point where I knew my intestines would
begin to rupture; there was nothing I could do.�
I was helpless, paralyzed.� He
never said a word, just looked down on me with a small smile as he caressed and
kissed my foot, then sucked softly on my toes.

&nbsp;

With a mechanical click,
everything seemed to reverse.� With a
hiss of free air, the thing in my rectum began to get smaller, while the rubber
bag in my vagina began to grow again.�
The thing grew and grew until I screamed my pain and frustration.� I felt so small, so worthless.� This man was using me as his toy; my only
value in life was to be used as another's plaything.� Helpless; hands tied to my side, my legs
paralyzed, my hips feeling like they would explode into a million pieces, all I
could do was lay on the bed with my legs spread wide, soaking up the incredible
pain he gave me and watch him make love to my foot. 

&nbsp;

The huge thing filled my
vagina for about thirty seconds, then with a hiss, the whole procedure reversed
itself.� Air began to escape from the
line that ran to my pussy, while air under pressure was driven into the bag
that filled my rectum.� I was inundated,
awash with sensations.� The incredible
filling, ripping pain shifted back to my bowels one more time.� This too lasted about thirty seconds, before
it switched again with that awful, metallic click.� He caressed me for almost ten minutes as this
went back and forth, whipsawing my body between the two extremes.� Even half a minute's relief was enough to
discover that the pain upon renewed assault was fresh, ripe, original.� I screamed anew with each change, each
outrage assuming a searing immediacy that blotted out any memory of the one
that had preceded it.� As a woman, there
was no way to fight this, it was irresistible.�
I prayed for the release of unconsciousness, but even in this he won;
awareness never left my tortured body.

&nbsp;

Towards the end, he
switched to my other foot.� He never said
a word, just caressed me and kissed me, sucking softly as he watched my
face.� I learned to dread the mechanical
click that announced my current torture was finished and I was about to meet an
old friend again.� I began to count the
seconds between each period under my breath, trying to make my mind focus on
something other than the things he did to me.�
I think he realized that my mind had finally gone into a gray zone where
the pain existed, but it existed for some other poor woman, not me.� He finally put my right foot down and turned
the machine off when my vagina was filled.�
He picked up my left foot again and suckled for a second.

&nbsp;

�That,� he said, �is what
it feels like to be fisted in the ass and pussy at the same time.� It's an incredible feeling, I've been
told.� Incredible.�� He seemed to roll that last word around his
mouth as he said it.� Savoring it,
measuring it; measuring the understatement it represented. 

&nbsp;

Still gasping for air and
covered in sweat, I said bravely, if foolishly, �I'd love to introduce you to
the reality.� Once I can move, I'd be
more than glad to help you feel it.�

&nbsp;

He laughed, �That's not for
me to experience.� Unfortunately however,
you aren't done.�

&nbsp;

I tried to move and failed.� My hips felt as if they had somehow been
operated on; my pelvis felt oddly numb, yet fragile and terribly sensitive at
the same time, resisting any attempt I might make to move as if I were now
wrapped in layer after layer of bandages.�


&nbsp;

�You've never had a child,
have you?� Well here's another new
sensation.�� Then he pushed my knees
further apart as he said, �Come on Little Slave, your pussy's full, so push it
out.� We'll be done with this when you
push it out onto the bed.�

&nbsp;

I was helpless, thighs
spread wide apart, totally exposed to his gaze and knowing for the first time
the feeling of total domination by a man.�
I hated feeling like this.� I hurt
too much for this to feel erotic in any way.�
But I knew I was this maniac's personal sex toy, lying on my back in
this position, paralyzed legs spread wide, open, wanton, giving him an
unwilling display.� 

&nbsp;

He took my toe out of his
mouth and said, �I am not kidding, woman.�
Push on it ; push it out of you.��
I was incredulous.� The thing he'd
put inside me felt like it was the size of watermelon right now and he wanted
me �......to push it out?�� If I hadn't
been in so much pain, it would have been funny.�
I laid my head back on the mattress and tried to blink away my tears and
the sweat that was running into my eyes.�
I licked my dry lips again.� He
didn't seem to be in any rush; I know he was enjoying what he was doing to me. 

&nbsp;

He put my foot down and
grabbed the air line that ran from my vagina.�
He tugged on it once softly, then grabbed it and gave a strong steady
pull.� It felt like he was pulling my
insides out through my vagina.� I
screamed again at the pain I felt ripping at my vaginal muscles.� 

&nbsp;

�STOP!� Ican'tIcan'tIcan'tIcan'tIcan't�� I was huffing for air.� My hands were writhing in their bonds and my
body was suddenly drenched in sweat.� My
pierced nipples stood erect as thrills of terror ran down my spine; I was a
mess.

&nbsp;

�I'm begging you.� Stop.�
I'll try, but just let me catch my breath.� Please, just a second; that's all I ask.� Please.�

&nbsp;

He stopped pulling on this
thing and looked at me with a smile.� He
was enjoying toying with me, having me in this position, open and dominated,
unable to do anything to stop him.� After
a minute, I lifted my hips as best I could and began to strain against the
monstrous vaginal bag that plugged the inside my body.� I clenched my teeth and pushed.� I know I howled in pain as my rectum expanded
as I pushed; it was attempting to expel the black rubber monster that had
invaded it too.� I had to stop; I needed
air, I had to breathe again. 

&nbsp;

I looked at him as sweat
ran down my forehead into my eyes.� He
looked back between my legs and shrugged his shoulders, �Nothing.� Nothing but tight, beautiful flesh.� Push.�

&nbsp;

After two quick breaths, I
clenched and pushed again.� My body was
arched and my neck muscles straining.� It
felt like what I imagined giving birth must feel like, except here I was
pushing with my vagina and my ass.�
Finally, I had to stop again.� He
took a long look and said, �I see a little rubber, woman.� A little black's showing.� Come on, you can do it.�

&nbsp;

I lay there panting for a
moment, then he reached down and let a little more air out of the bladder that
filled my vagina.� Just enough that I
could definitely tell the difference in size.�
Then he began to pull on the black air line that ran out of my vagina as
he said, �Come on.� You know you want it
out.� Push, bitch.� Don't make me do all the work.�� 

&nbsp;

Suddenly fearful that he
would stop helping by pulling on the bag, I arched and pushed again.� I was screaming as I strained.� I could tell that it was coming out.� God, it was HUGE!� It hurt so much!� My abdomen was cramping and my flesh was
tearing.� It felt like a Mack truck was
pushing my labia apart as his monstrosity finally parted the lips of my pussy
and began its journey to freedom.� Even
though it hurt terribly as it stretched the entry to my vagina, I had to stop
to breathe again.� I heard myself
moaning, but I couldn't stop.� 

&nbsp;

It felt like I was close to
success.� I took one final breath and
held it as I arched my back and gritted my teeth.� I pushed with all my might as he pulled.� It felt like the monster was made of
concrete, but I know the rubber must have had some give, because suddenly it
was out!� It didn't look nearly as large
as it felt; but it was still huge.� My
vagina ached and throbbed; it felt torn and stretched.� But at least the abdominal cramps were slowly
going away. 

&nbsp;

It was then that I realized
how much my anus hurt.� I'd been
straining with my rectum as much as my pussy, but the thing that blocked me in
the rear was immovable.� It had almost
come out; I was sure of that.� But at the
end, I'd run out of strength and my body had pulled it back and locked it into
its original position. 

&nbsp;

He looked at me with a
smile as he put his vaginal toy away.�
Then he spread my knees and reached down under my hips and began tugging
on the end of the anal plug.� He put his
hand on my pelvis and told me to �relax,� as he began pulling and suddenly it
came free with a slurping sound. �God, it
felt heavenly to have those things outside of me. 

&nbsp;

I hurt everywhere.

&nbsp;

I wanted back in my
box.� It had become a place of comfort,
rather than being a punishment.� But
instead, he made me sleep on the bed.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I was woken from a dead
sleep.� It was early morning and I lay on
my bed, right wrist bound to the bed.�
I'd been woken from a dead sleep by a slap to the face.� Before I knew what had happened, he'd pinned
my left wrist with his right hand and begun choking me with his left.� I tried to struggle, but it didn't do any
good.� My eyes were bulging and I needed
air.� Just before I passed out, he
stopped choking me enough that I could breathe just a little.� I was scared to death of his
unpredictableness, but I was slowly learning that often the erratic behavior he
displayed was my fault.� He told me over
and over that I couldn't do anything right and brought this anger down on
myself---I deserved this, he said.� Then he
started berating me.� It was my fault
this time.� I'd been told time and time
again to sleep with my legs spread wide, learning to always make myself
available to whichever man I happened to be with.� 

&nbsp;

His punishments happened
time and time again.� God, he angered and
scared me at the same time.� But I soon
learned this lesson well.� Eventually, it
became just as ingrained as sitting primly erect with my knees together.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

Not quite two weeks now and more than ever I realized that Rebecca
was a woman that needed to be motivated to do her best.� She still fought her training in a multitude
of tiny clever ways, claiming that she had misunderstood my commands, thus
allowing me little rational recourse.�
She rebelled in stupid ways by openly ignoring my demands and forcing me
to punish her.� Tonight she was to be
punished for one of her more stupid moves.

&nbsp;

Ginger figging is something that I�d wanted to do to a woman for a
long time.� I'd not however, possessed a
woman with the appropriate potential �appetite�
until I'd collared Rebecca.� At the same
time, I'd quickly discovered from the beginning that she was not particularly
comfortable with anal games---not yet anyway.�
This was why the chair had been so effective in the beginning at
breaking her down.� 

&nbsp;

And so I prepared; I've studied this and found that a few in the
past have claimed figging was only an anal discipline during Victorian
times.� But others have claimed that in
addition to ensuring feminine restraint and obedience, figging also guaranteed
the utter humiliation of a woman, preventing the clenching of her buttocks while
being either caned or birched.� I didn�t
know what the truth of the matter might be, but I was willing to experiment
with the volatile oils of a ginger butt plug and how they reacted with
Rebecca�s mucous membranes.� 

&nbsp;

Two evenings ago, I had
purchased some uncut White African ginger root in a local holistic medicine
shop.� The ginger hand was large enough
to ensure a nice-sized plug, and having been grown in the West Indies, I was
assured that this represented the strongest and most aromatic of the available
herbs.� 

&nbsp;

As ordered,
Rebecca was sitting naked on the side of her bed when I came in.� She was doing much better now that the
infection had mostly been cleansed from her system.� Still weak, her strength was coming back
slowly.� She'd just gone off the
antibiotics I'd obtained, but I continued having her rub in both a topical
antibiotic and a steroid to get rid of the redness and swelling.� Her breasts were doing fine, the skin was
milky white again except for the faint blue spider web tracing of veins
immediately beneath the surface and the two small pierced areas on either
side.� There, the skin was still a little
red and swollen, but it shouldn't scar up as had been my biggest fear.� 

&nbsp;

The beautiful
Rebecca had shown few initial insecurities at being without clothing and now
only reacted with a &quot;cover&quot; reflex when startled.� Smiling, I gave her the ginger hand; she
didn't recognize it, but immediately wrinkled her nose at the strong herbal
smell.� This would be delicious; she
obviously had no idea of the various uses for ginger root.� Next I gave her a small paring knife with a
one-inch long blade that had been purposely dulled and ordered her to trim as
long a piece off of the root's &quot;hand&quot; as was possible; I loved the wonderful
irony of having her prepare the ginger that she would later be using.� 

&nbsp;

She looked at
me speculatively when I gave her the knife and I stared directly back into her
remarkable eyes. &quot;Think you're strong enough to try your luck, Little
Slave?&quot; I asked.

&nbsp;

The impasse
must have lasted about fifteen seconds before she looked away.� She was submitting to my will, but ever so
slowly.� I knew that she just HAD to be
scared of what she faced, but she did a good job most of the time of hiding her
fear from me.� She always seemed to be able
to maintain some kind of a barrier between us, using virtually anything to hide
her emotions.� It would take a little
while, but I knew I could break it down since the branding and the piercings
had both been effective and just the beginning.�


&nbsp;

She'd been a
dominating, hardass woman in her previous life.�
But it wasn't entirely her fault.�
Many modern women are caught up in the confusion between the need to
maintain control over their personal and professional lives and the inevitable
loss of control necessary to maintain a relationship like the one she should
have had with her husband.� In my
experience, the more attractive they were, the more often they were messed up
in this way.� She was the type that had
viewed compromise with males as a weakness, yet no relationship like the one
that she truly needed could be sustained without the push and pull that she'd
refused.� Well, I smiled grimly to
myself; her days of choosing were over now.

&nbsp;

I'd put the ginger hand in the refrigerator the night before and
it was now cooled and ready to be shaped.�
Working under my direction and unaware of my ultimate goal, I had
Rebecca cut the largest possible finger from the ginger, extending the cut up
into the hand itself to ensure maximum length and thickness.� Rebecca�s particular Waterloo was a little
over six inches long and about an inch in diameter at the thick end.� I had her remove the skin, taking care to
leave none behind---I didn't want anything to get in the way of the full
effect.� I wanted this thing to fit
snugly into my Sub, so I told Rebecca to take her time as she sculpted
the finger, ensuring that the tip at the thin end was well rounded, and that
the finger was smooth and all bumps had been removed---I was sure that she
would appreciate this thoughtfulness later, but said nothing at the time.

&nbsp;

Up in the thicker part of the sculpture that had been the ginger
hand, I now had Rebecca cut out what would be the most important part for
her.� About half an inch from the thick
end, I had her lightly carve into the finger a small indented one-quarter inch
wide moat.� I called this ring a moat
even though she would have no defenses against it.� This would be the means by which she maintained
the butt plug in place---it would give her anus something to lock onto, just as
the sphincter locks around the tapered portion of any manufactured butt
plug.� 

&nbsp;

She bent over
her naked lap, peeling and whittling away.�
When she had a nice-sized finger carved and peeled, I took the ginger
pieces and knife back without a word and headed out to the kitchen after
locking her in the White Room.� It was
her afternoon exercise time, and even though she was still sick, I had her
stretch out a little.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

Later that
evening, I walked back into the White Room.�
It was one of her few free periods and Rebecca was sitting on the edge
of her bed with her legs spread wide and right foot up on the mattress; her
labia pulled away from the inside of her right thigh.� She'd just finished picking newly dead skin
from around her brand and was now scrubbing lightly on it with a tooth brush as
I'd ordered.� The tooth brush removed the
dead skin and kept the new skin pink and fresh as the brand slowly healed.� It also had to hurt like a
mother-fucker.� 

&nbsp;

Forcing her to
hurt herself like this was another way to instill discipline.� She kept her face blank as she slowly
arose.� I waited patiently through her
disrespect---her punishment would be coming soon.� The military have a term for what she did;
&quot;dumb insolence&quot;.� It's
a way to be disrespectful, yet without saying anything that can be construed as
showing a direct lack of respect.� 

&nbsp;

Earlier, I had
planned the whole sexy thing, stockings, garter and heels, everything---hammer
her ass, then fuck her brains out.� But
I'd changed my mind.

&nbsp;

She looked at
me wearily as she got to her feet.� Even
though her hair could use a brushing and her face a little makeup, she was
still beautiful in an untamed, white goddess of the jungle sort of way.� I looked at her standing in front of me
without apparent fear, her beautiful breasts jutting out arrogantly.� The nipple rings that I had buried so much
deeper in her tits than normal gleamed in the soft light.� Her long shapely legs, tiny waist and womanly
hips drew me in; she was truly beautiful.�
I tossed Rebecca a pair of padded wrist cuffs and told her to put them
on.� She hesitated for only a second and
then put them around her wrists as I locked them together in front of her
belly.

&nbsp;

&quot;You try
to hide it, but you are still an arrogant, disrespectful bitch.� Even though it would be smart to try, you
still make no attempt to understand the rules of your new life.� But soon you will.�� Even though I had already fucked her up
pretty good, the need to exercise her free will was buried deeply inside her,
and it came out in either open, fuck you---in your face disobedience or by
pretending in a passive / aggressive sort of way that she didn't understand my
commands.� 

&nbsp;

It seemed at
this point that she'd not initially possessed a natural survival sense---a
feeling of when to fight and when to go along.�
She'd done her best to push my buttons at first and only obeyed in the
end because of my superior strength.� But
in just the few days that I'd had her, she'd finally begun learn the value of
going along.� That, and the fact that she
knew that if she fought me, she'd still be punished and her punishment would be
a hundred times worse than what she had tried to avoid; we both knew that in
the end, I would always have my way with her.

&nbsp;

I pushed her
towards the foot of the bed and ordered her to stand behind the bed's
footboard.� I grabbed each of her feet
one at a time and velcro'd soft ankle cuffs around her bare ankles, then
fastened them to opposite bed posts.� I
was kneeling in back of her when I was finished and her ass was right at face
level.� I allowed her a shower every day
and when I was this close, she had a clean female smell.� Although there were still a few light orange
and blue bruises, her buttocks looked firm and wonderfully inviting, ready to
take any punishment I had planned.� As I
stood up, I reached between her legs and cupped her nakedness for a
second.� Rebecca jumped as I touched her
in this most intimate area, but she couldn't do much else.� Now I told her to lay down on the bed.� The only way she could do this was to drape
herself over the footboard, which was exactly what I wanted.� The position was uncomfortable, but what did
I care?

&nbsp;

I repeated
myself with a little more emphasis, &quot;Lay down on the bed and hold your
wrists out.&quot;� She hesitated for a
second and I said, &quot;You and I both know that you're going to do exactly
what I tell you to do.� But if you make
me force you, I'll fuck you up ten times worse.�
Now lay down on the bed and hold your wrists out!&quot;� And she did slowly.� I had a nylon strap attached to the head
board.� I looped the strap around the
chain that connected her wrists and velcro'd it back on itself, stretching her
body taut on over the bed.� Rebecca was
helpless, bent provocatively over the footboard with her legs spread wide and
naked ass perched straight into the air.�
Her torso had an attractive bow in it as her hips were forced into the
air, but her belly still rested smoothly on the mattress.� I think that she thought I would sodomize her
again.� Not tonight, Little Slave, I
smiled to myself, not tonight.

&nbsp;

&quot;You don't
understand that your whole life has changed.�
You've acted like a spoiled child, being forced to go along on some new
adventure.� But you willingly chose this
life by coming through that door, even though I warned you not to. �Now you regret that decision---you resent
every minute of it and you don't try to hide it.� It just stews out of you.� You don't try to hide it at all.� In fact, you seem to glory in your little
perverse acts of pride and defiance.�
Fine.� Well, here's the honest
truth; you act like a child here and I'm going to treat you like one.�� 

&nbsp;

�It's a new
game we're beginning right now and here are the rules.� No matter what happens, you don't get to say
a word.� You have the rights of an
animal, so you can grunt like an animal, but that's it.� Tonight you start to learn some discipline
and you take it all without a complaint.�
You say a word, I'll have to punish you.�
The more you say, the more I hammer your ass as punishment.� Very simple game; very clean, elegant
rules.� And everything's ultimately under
your control.�

&nbsp;

I waited a
minute to build up the anticipation, then I walked out to the kitchen and
returned with the cold, wet ginger finger she had made.� She had the left side of her face resting on
the mattress, so I placed the dish where she could see it.� &quot;You, my dear, carved this little jewel
yourself.� And here's how it's going to
go.&quot;

&nbsp;

I walked up to
Rebecca's ass with the ginger finger and spread her cheeks.� At first she didn't move, but quickly she began
moving her hips trying to make it harder for me to backdoor her.� Her rim was a nicely healed soft brown
pucker, since I hadn't had an opportunity to spread her there in the last few
days.� I rubbed the ginger finger around
her anus for a few seconds, then began pressing it into her.� She tried to stifle a gasp and began fighting
and bucking.� 

&nbsp;

It was a
beautiful wedge shape, thick at one end and nicely pointed at the other; the
geometry alerted everyone that she had no chance at all.� The blunt, pointy end of the ginger soon
defeated Rebecca's best efforts and disappeared.� She groaned and her hips froze, as if she
were afraid to move.� &quot;God,&quot;
she moaned softly, both outrage and disgust evident in her tone.�� I �Tsk'd, tsk'd� at the sound of her voice,
but was rather pleased.� We both knew
she'd broken rules before the fun had even started.� She knew she'd already earned an escalation
in the night's games.

&nbsp;

I waited about
a minute and shoved it in the rest of the way, right up to the point where her
sphincter locked onto the little collar she'd unknowingly carved for her own
use.� Where the off-white of the ginger
snugly disappeared inside her ass, it also distended and stretched her
beautiful rosy-brown rim in preparation for receiving its gifts.� She made several deep grunting noises like a
pig that'd just found food.� Suddenly,
Rebecca went nuts, screaming and raging at me.�
Then, like a clock that had run down, she stopped, and even as I
watched, she began to unconsciously react to the ginger's pervasive oils.� Slowly, Rebecca began breathing harder and
moving her hips in a slow, grinding circle as if she were trying to dislodge
the piece I'd pushed up her ass.� Her
tongue darted out in wonder and she licked her dry lips again and again.� In another minute, she was grunting and
groaning in both discomfort and a profound, awful amazement. 

&nbsp;

I looked at her
with a sad expression on my face.� She'd
only said a few things, but they were enough to justify my next step.� �You knew the rules.� You'd been warned.� You said way too much.� You've been a bad girl, now you need to be
punished.�

&nbsp;

Rebecca was
begging me continuously now, saying, &quot;No, stop it, please.� What are you doing?� Not that!&quot;

&nbsp;

�Little Slave,
I've only really spanked you one time, and that was on the board.� There've been a few other times, but nothing
really bad.� And so, you think you know
about spankings and being spanked.� Well,
you know nothing yet.� Tonight you learn
the real difference between spanking for fun and spanking for real.&quot;� I walked back into my bedroom and returned in
thirty seconds with the same leather belt I'd used on her a little over a week
ago.� I slapped the belt into my hand as
I walked around her bare bottom.� 

&nbsp;

&quot;Spanking
for fun is when you get a little buzz on your skin from a few love slaps.� Maybe with a wooden paddle or a tiny leather
belt or even a thin cane.� Then, after
we've both gotten what we want, we play kissy face and make up a little.&quot;� I walked around her ass some more, slapping
the belt into my hand several times for effect.�
Every time I did this, she would jump and clench her buttocks in
preparation for the first blow.� She was
about ready.� 

&nbsp;

&quot;But
punishment spankings are a different kettle of fish altogether, my Little
Slave.&quot;� 

&nbsp;

She cried out
again, and this time fear could be heard in her voice.� But it wasn't fear of the belt.� &quot;It's getting too hot.� It's burning me.� Please, take it out, it's getting
hotter.&quot;

&nbsp;

Without
answering, I smiled as I stepped back to get room.� The first blow brought a scream of pain from
my enslaved beauty.� She bucked and went
up on her toes, and because I watching for it, I saw her cheeks clench in a
protective mode.� That lasted for about
thirty seconds and then she relaxed her buttocks with a soft, puzzled cry of
pain.� At that exact moment, I laid
another shot across her ass right on top of the red marks of the first; out of
control, she screamed and bucked and clenched again.� I waited another minute and changed my
position.� As I did, I counseled her on
her behavior and attitude.� I was tired,
I told her, of her attitude.� She must
learn to accept discipline now.�
Just as when she had been a child, spankings were now a part of her life
again.� When she was disobedient, she
would be spanked.� And it would
hurt.� But when she was good, when she
had earned affection, she would get that too---in the form of love play.� She would get spankings then too.� But they were, I reassured her, totally different
and she would soon learn to look forward to them.� Now though, it was time to address her bad
behavior.

&nbsp;

And it was also
time for me to address her ass again.�
This time, I laid the belt along the crack of her ass going from top to
bottom.� The end of the belt wrapped
itself up between her legs almost to her belly.�
Rebecca screamed and her body arched off the mattress, out of control
now as her hips began bucking again.�
Only now, she was bucking constantly, rhythmically.� I wouldn't hit her like that again for fear
of breaking off the small piece of ginger that stuck out of her ass.� I knew she'd just push the rest out
eventually, but I didn't want to mess with it right now.� I saw her ass clench one more time, then just
as quickly relax as the burn became too great. She was crying now like a little
girl, her body covered in sweat as she begged for relief from both the ginger
and my belt between her sobs.� 

&nbsp;

It went on like
this for almost ten minutes.� She was
quivering all over her body and I had hit her a total of perhaps ten or twelve
times.� Her buttocks were bright red and
raised welts criss-crossed her firm ass cheeks.�


&nbsp;

&quot;Why are
you doing this to me?� Please stop.� God.�
Stop.� Please take it out!&quot;� Her sobbing and begging was music to my
ears.� The most interesting part was that
while there were definite tones of revulsion in her voice, they were clearly
overlain by what could only be horrid fascination at the same time.� Rebecca had no idea what was happening with
the ginger; this was totally beyond her experience and she was experiencing
feelings that she couldn't integrate; feeling sensations and the need to react
in ways that she didn't know how to handle.

&nbsp;

I'd whipped her
ass pretty good, but her attention was focused on the burn from the ginger as
much as on my belt.� I leaned down and
ran my middle finger inside her vagina as I cupped her trembling flesh in my
hand.� I knew she normally hated being
touched like this when helpless, but she was....well, helpless....and could do
nothing about it.� Her vagina was
steaming hot and slick, soaked from what could only be pussy juice.� The insides of both thighs were wet from a
love overflow.� I was a little surprised
at how wet she was, but I was never one to look a gift horse in the mouth.� I wasn't sure yet, but perhaps she might turn
out to be one of those women that were really turned on by having a nice large
piece of fiery herbal root buried in their ass when they were spanked.� 

&nbsp;

I continued to cup Rebecca and the smell of a pussy on
fire was overwhelming, filling the air with its own distinctive musk; yes,
absolutely, she was definitely one of these women.� I manipulated her clit as I cupped her again
and she reacted instinctively now, grinding herself hard into my hand despite
her unwillingness to actively cooperate.�
I smiled to myself as I touched her.�
The female clitoris is the most wondrous organ
in the totality of humanity; it contains twice as many nerve endings as the
male penis, the uncanny ability to produce multiple orgasms and has no known
purpose other than pleasure.� And it was
working overtime on my beautiful captive woman.

&nbsp;

&quot;Come on,
baby.� You want me.� You need a man and you want me.� You've got an aching hole here that needs to
be filled and you know you want me.� Tell
me how much you want it.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;No,&quot;
she cried out.� Then she whimpered,
&quot;Please, leave me alone.� Take it
out, it's burning me.� Get it out of me,
now.� NOW!� Please.�
PLEASE!&quot;

&nbsp;

This was a
woman with a lot of will power.� I
stepped back and picked up the belt I'd laid down beside her.� &quot;What,&quot; I asked, &quot;have I told
you to call me?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Please,&quot;
she sobbed in pain and fear, &quot;don't hit me again, Master.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;You,&quot;
I replied, &quot;are a little late with that, cunt.&quot;� And I laid into her with the belt again.� Forget about the psychology, forget about the
training.� Suddenly, I just wanted to
hurt the bitch and teach her not to play games with me.� I hit her three or four more times, really
hard.� She screamed in pain with each
blow and sobbed as she waited for the next.�
Suddenly, I stopped.� This was
wrong, beating her when I was angry.� I
laid the belt down beside her and touched the Rebecca between her legs
again.� She was even hotter and wetter
than before.

&nbsp;

&quot;You're a
slut; deep inside you know you love being spanked and you love having a man
fill you.� Come on, admit it.&quot;

&nbsp;

Rebecca was
crying softly now, sobbing with her face buried in the mattress.� The belt had finally overwhelmed the root for
the moment and she was in real pain.� But
the sensations must have been almost equal in intensity, because soon she was
grinding her pelvis against my hand again.�
But she didn't answer me and that was wrong.� She would have to learn to always answer her
master when he asked her a question.� I stood
up and used the belt one time more a little more lightly than before, telling
her exactly why she deserved this last blow.�


&nbsp;

Then I moved
back between her legs as I cupped her again and began to manipulate her
engorged feminine nub.� &quot;You want
me.� You want me to fill your crack and
fuck you.� Admit it, you whore.&quot;

&nbsp;

I coaxed her
this way for another couple of minutes, then curved two fingers and began to
work her G-spot.� I counseled her to tell
the truth, but she always replied with soft, sobbing words of denial, even as
her hips swayed, grinding her pussy harder and harder into my hand---everything
about her telling me yes, yes, yes.�
Finally she couldn't take anymore and whispered something softly into
the mattress.� Rebecca was a woman that
would normally rather die than admit to being beaten by something like
this.� I couldn't hear her so I left my
position by her hips and put my ear by her mouth.� &quot;What did you say, Little
Slave?&quot;� Rebecca hesitated for about
half a minute, then with her eyes closed she whispered in a resigned tone the
four little words that let me know I had won this round.

&nbsp;

&quot;Please
don't hurt me,&quot; she whispered, begging and imploring me at the same time.

&nbsp;

I walked back
to her hips and began working her again.�
First I put two fingers inside her pussy, then three and finally
four.� Four fingers was about right; they
filled her up pretty good and still allowed me to get inside her up to my
knuckles.� With my other hand, I began to
rub her clit.� She let out a wordless cry
after a second.� &quot;You know you want
it from me tonight.� You are absolutely
wet for me and your pussy is steaming hot; come on baby, you're breathing like
you've just run a marathon.� Tell your
Sir just how much you want it.� Come on,
baby, you know you want it, so beg for it.&quot;

&nbsp;

She remained
silent so I reached down and pressed her ass cheeks together for her.� Rebecca cried out in pain.� 

&nbsp;

&quot;Beg for
it, baby.� And if you don't want to beg,
then I'll stuff more of this shit up your ass and keep it there until you talk
to me.� I figure you can take maybe one
more piece of ginger, but no more.&quot;�
Now I lied to her.� &quot;And I've
got two more pieces just waiting for you.�
Now, beg me to fuck you, bitch.&quot;�
And after a minute of silence, finally she did. 

&nbsp;

&quot;I....I.....want
you to fuck me.&quot;� She barely
whispered this between sobs, as if by saying it so softly, it wouldn't be real.

&nbsp;

&quot;Not loud enough,
woman.� Louder.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I want
you.....to fuck me.&quot;� This was a
little better, but she still wasn't giving me what I wanted.� I needed to goad her just a little more.

&nbsp;

&quot;What do
you call me?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Please,
Master.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Very
nice, I said, &quot;now finish it.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Please,
Master, I want you to fuck me.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Nice
Little Slave.� Very nice.� Now say it one more time like you really mean
it.&quot;� 

&nbsp;

And she
did.� She was finally there, at least for
now.

&nbsp;

I freed her
wrists from the head board first and even though she still wore the cuffs, she
immediately tried to remove the ginger from her swollen asshole.� I stopped her and then freed her ankles.� &quot;Get on the bed, bitch.&quot;� She didn't really hear much now, but rather
just reacted to what she thought I wanted.�
Her face flushed with embarrassment, Rebecca wouldn't look me in the
eyes as she slowly climbed on the bed and laid on her back.� She had finally stopped crying as she spread
her knees and brought them up towards her chest.� This was the position that she had first
taken when I had first fucked her a week ago---definite vanilla
tendencies.� Give me a couple of months
and she'd be a knowledgeable slut, able to anticipate whatever a man
desired.� 

&nbsp;

Her ass must
have hurt terribly from the spanking and the ginger must have still had some
zing left in it, because she groaned again and closed her eyes as she waited
for me with her knees spread wide.� Her
naked vagina gaped moistly in this position; but even beaten as she was,
Rebecca was still gorgeous.� Her labia
were distended, inflamed with the need for a man (or perhaps it was because I'd
hit her there with the belt) and her clit was red and turgid, swollen and hard
with what could only be need.� After I
looked at my beautiful slave for a moment and admired her, I tied her wrists to
the head of the bed so that she was still helpless.� 

&nbsp;

I could feel
the blood pooling heavily in the tip of my cock and I knew I was definitely
ready for her.� But I wanted to torture
her some more, so I began manipulating her pussy again.� She cried out at first, then finally screamed
in her frustration and impatience at the need for a man, but that was part of
the training.� After I manipulated her
gaping, scalding hot pussy for a couple of more minutes, she was so ready for
sex that she'd have fucked a dog if I'd had one in there.� Even as weak as she was from being ill, all
she wanted was the pleasure of having her pussy filled and her brains fucked
out.� I slowly removed the ginger from
her asshole, then gently lowered her right leg and straightened it out.� I walked down to the foot of the bed and tied
her ankle to the bed's footpost.� With
that I turned and began to leave. 

&nbsp;

At the door, I
took one last look at her.� She had
raised her head and was looking at me in disbelief.� Tied the way she was, Rebecca could not give
herself pleasure.� We both knew that she
would spend the night in torment, wondering what had just happened to her.� 

&nbsp;

�Tomorrow,� I
said, �we start your training for real.��
As I turned the light off, she gave out one piercing scream of anger and
need and frustration, her still raging desire left unfulfilled.� But the best part was that we both realized
that each of these were only complex overtones that covered the real emotions
she was feeling---humiliation and degradation and total loss of control; we
both knew� that she had just unwillingly
offered me something precious---and I had refused her offer.

&nbsp;

I smiled as I
left.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I struggled for a second, but it was no
use.� I lay on the bed for a couple of
minutes without thinking.� He was
right.� God, was he right!� All I could feel was the tremendous heat and
the need between my legs.� It felt like
the outsides of my vagina had swollen together, while the inner part had
ballooned out, leaving me with only the throbbing ache of unfilled
promise.� My clitoris was painfully
erect; my inner labia had swollen with blood to the point that they spread
apart my outer labia, opening me up for any man and leaving me just begging to
be filled.� 

&nbsp;

I felt consumed.� I couldn't stop what was happening; I didn't
want to.� I needed a man right now in the
worst way.� Or a vibrator or
anything!� I needed to be filled.� All I could think of was how desperately I
wanted a man pumping me; one that I could grab and fuck like a maniac, and be
fucked by a maniac in return.� 

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I lay on my
back in the dark an hour later.� My hands
were still cuffed to the bed, mindlessly clenching into fists and then
releasing.� A woman's perception of
sexual arousal was very much dependent on context, whether her brain believed
it was appropriate and desired; I still didn�t understand what had just
happened.� The back of my legs, buttock
and lower back throbbed from his beating.�
I now understood the
very real difference between spanking for fun and pleasure and play, and that
for discipline and punishment.� Not
perhaps in a formal sense, but certainly by experience.� I immediately came to fear his punishment
spankings.� 

&nbsp;

My rectum
ached and burned like the crater of a volcano filled to the brim with molten
lava.� My body tingled all over and I
still felt an overwhelming sense of sexual frustration.� But I was also filled with a delicious sense
of�.satisfaction?� And my body somehow
felt thick and encased, as if I were lying in a bed filled with blood-warm
honey.

&nbsp;

What.......in
hell�had he�just done�to me?

&nbsp;

I was an adult woman.� I was experienced in sex; I thought I knew my
body.� The truth was, I'd always used my
body and my sexuality to control men, but I refused to allow them to control me
through my body.� I hadn�t had a real
orgasm in years, not even when I had been with my husband.� I didn�t want one and those few times when I
was with an experienced and sensitive lover, I refused to indulge myself.� But then this---this whatever it was---was
inside me, I was helpless before it.�
Time after time, like an avalanche always building, never slowing;
sweeping me out of control before it, always getting bigger and hotter and ever
more consuming.� I'd never had a series
of orgasms like this before.� Never.� Then, when he�d taken me to the very edge,
teetering on the biggest one yet, he'd abandoned me.

&nbsp;

Even though he
was right in a lot of ways when he called me a cunt, I also knew that when a
woman allowed herself to be taken to completion, arousal and orgasm, it was a
process that involved the entire person, inextricably connecting body AND my
mind.� I knew the human mind received
sexual stimuli from the body and based on past learning and experience, allowed
the body to respond---or not.� But while
able to experience sexual arousal separately, the mind and the body cannot
experience orgasm separately.� Orgasm
requires both the mind and body to work together.� All the sexual stimulation and arousal may
originate in one or the other, but orgasm takes place in both.� 

&nbsp;

For me to
maintain control, it had always before been important that I basked in the
physical stimuli, but somehow interpreted it in a manner that while it might be
sexual, it was never......sufficient.�
This was the trick I used to avoid orgasm; short-circuiting one of the
two essential paths of erotic stimuli.�
But if this was so, then what on earth had I just responded to?� 

&nbsp;

In the
deepest, darkest corners of my soul, I was afraid I knew.� It was the final resolution of the game I'd
played with men for many years, and it was inspired by pain and loss of
control---domination AND degradation.� I
had never been to this man's place before he kidnapped me, but I'd been in
others like it with other men that were a little like him.� But never with a man that had so totally
taken control of every part of my world.�
I didn't want this, and the mere thought of him having the freedom to do
this to me brought tears to my eyes.� How
I had gotten to this point in my life, I wasn't sure, but I knew that I had
never before felt so alone and so utterly afraid.� How bad could it be?� I knew the answer now.� I looked back on the last six years with a
clarity that can only be reached when the journey is over.� When you have told yourself there is no going
back.� Would I ever be allowed to escape
him?

&nbsp;

I was
exhausted.� I was drained and confused
and tired of analyzing my feelings.� Now
I felt a wonderful sense of warmth all over my body and all I wanted to
do�was��sleep.� My rectum continued to
burn for hours and it felt like something huge still resided there.� 

&nbsp;

I missed my
husband.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

A LOVE STORY,
TO BE CONTINUED

***

&nbsp;

Women can be trained in art of being naked gracefully.� Some are initially uncomfortable being
naked.� Caught suddenly without a stitch
of clothing, these women couldn�t seem to find a pose that felt natural.� They didn't know what to do with their hands,
or the best way to balance their weight.�
On one leg?� Both?� Hip thrust out?� Not?�
Cover this?� Cover that?� Rebecca wasn't one of those women.� Even naked, she moved with the confidence of
those who knew that their good looks had always smoothed all of life's
difficulties---uncomfortable as she was without support for her breasts, she
still quickly took to nakedness.� As
uncomfortable as I was with not being in control?� That's how comfortable she was with being
naked now.� 

&nbsp;

The next morning was Sunday, and it was early as I slowly moved my
hands over her body.� This woman was far
more clever than any of the others I'd previously taken.� Even though the back of her thighs and her
buttocks were still a mass of bruises, we talked while my hands explored her
beautiful body.� In a soft voice Rebecca
claimed that she'd made a mistake; that she had learned her lesson and would
never misbehave again.� This wasn�t
enough and Rebecca knew it.� I finally
released her last bond to the bed.� 

&nbsp;

�What do you want from me?� she asked in fear of further beatings.

&nbsp;

�I want to believe you are sorry.�
Make me believe.� Make me believe
you have learned.�

&nbsp;

Rebecca stood up with a soft sob and watched me, frozen, as I
slowly walked over to the wall and picked up the same two-inch wide leather
belt to which she�d already been introduced several times.� She sobbed again as I folded it in half, but
didn�t say a word as I walked towards her.�
I nodded my head towards the foot of the bed.� She hesitated for a second, then without a
sound, she bent over her bed and rested her forehead on her elbows.� Given what I had arranged for her yesterday,
I was surprised that she didn't need to be handcuffed.� Rebecca stared at the wall in front of her
and never looked at me as I walked behind her.�


&nbsp;

I told myself that I went easy on her this time and if I said it
enough, I sort of believed it after awhile.�
In any case, it was over in a couple of minutes.� Her ass and back were striped with welts,
purple upon purple, and bruises upon healing bruises.� �Enough,� I told her at the end.� I was breathing a little hard from the
exertion and she turned her tear-streaked face to me.� �Enough for now.�

&nbsp;

She would soon learn that submitting and cooperating always made
life easier.� I put the belt away and
made her begin straightening the room even though it didn't need it.� During this time, I laid a plastic liner in
the box she inhabited while I was at work.�
After a twenty minutes I asked �How�s your fannie?�

&nbsp;

�A little better, Sir,� she replied softly.� Tears still streaked her face, but she was
very quiet, looking at the floor.

&nbsp;

�You�ve got a whole new set of rules to live by---but that�s how
it is with you and me.� We�re joined at
the hip now.�� I looked at her, �Say it,
say it now.�

&nbsp;

�Joined at the hip,� she said in a dead voice.

&nbsp;

�Look at me when you talk to me,� I demanded.� �Say it again.�

&nbsp;

�Joined at the hip,� she repeated, but now with a soft sob in her
voice.

&nbsp;

�What do you call me?�

&nbsp;

�Master,� she replied.

&nbsp;

�And?� I asked.� �Say it
all.�

&nbsp;

�Joined at the hip, Master.�
I�.I�I belong to you, Master.�

&nbsp;

�Now you�re a good girl, but you still go into the box.� You�ve been a bad girl.�

&nbsp;

She didn't fight me as I began to settle her back into her wooden
prison.� I told Rebecca, �I made a
mistake with you.� I allowed you a little
too much freedom, a little too quickly.�
But now we correct that.�

&nbsp;

�Please, Master,� she looked up at me with a pleading look on her
face.� �Please don�t put me in here
again.�

&nbsp;

�Too late.�� I closed the
box and slid her under the bed.� She
would spend at least two full days in there this time, lying in her own filth,
drinking tepid water and eating a few stale crumbs of bread.� 

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

With each
passing moment, I felt my very reason trickling away.� I didn't know how much time passed at first,
but it felt like I spent months in there.�
I lay on the wooden floor where he'd thrown me.� As long as I remained absolutely motionless,
I didn't hurt.� But if I even twitched,
the pain was agonizing, all-consuming, subsuming every other sense.� Finally, however, the pain went away and the
anger began to return, continuing to smolder deep inside me.� At the end, I knew I had a view of reality
that was different from anything I'd ever experienced before.� I felt like I was in a sort of dreamtime; a
place where everything existed all at once, instead of as a series of events
happening one after the other.� It seemed
like a place with no beginning and no end.�
There was no beginning, at least none that I feel.� And that made it less likely that there would
be an end.� Here, everything simply
was.� 

&nbsp;

I thought
about Sunday School so many years ago as a child.� The fires of hell that awaited the
sinner.� That terror was sometimes still
with me.� No one knew how sin was
measured.� And no one knew when the
punishment would be dealt out.� I'd never
been able to talk about this terror with my mother.� Now, I'm sure, it was too late.� 

&nbsp;

After a day,
I lay in a ghastly sludge of feces and urine, hungry, thirsty, tired but still
unable to sleep.� The air grew heavier
and more stifling.� It felt like my skin
was rotting off my bones even as I continued breathing the foul air.� It grew more and more claustrophobic.� The air was dwindling and breathing seemed
just short of impossible.� It seemed as
though I'd bidden farewell to the real world and entered a niche in the
blackest, most isolated cave in Tibet, then a blizzard had descended upon my
heart and soul, hiding everything of worth from my vision.� Time stood still and there was no apparent
end to my misery.� At one point, I was
seized by a panic attack.� I couldn't
breathe, I was choking.� I needed to get
out of the black box he'd buried me in; I had to leave this hole and get back
to light and air.

&nbsp;

After what
seemed weeks, he let me out.� But I think
it was actually only late afternoon of the second day.� The light from the setting sun streamed in
through the glass bricks and penetrated my brain, blinding and dazing me.� In the artificial environment of the box, my
senses got so turned around that I couldn't tell night from day.� This was not the first occasion that the
light of day had taken me by surprise.�
Still blinking, I looked distractedly at him.� I fixed my eyes on on him and suddenly, I
could expand my lungs again.� He let me
catch my breath for a second then he dragged me outside and hosed me down.� I could barely move at this point and had no
opportunity to attempt another escape should I have even wanted to.� He led me back inside and after I'd cleaned
my wooden box, he finally let me take a shower.�
It was wonderful.� 

&nbsp;

As a female
used to cleanliness being a part of your culturally norm, you cannot imagine
how powerful a punishment it is to lay on your back with your own filth filling
the crease between your buttocks and lining your thighs; lying in it, feeling
it, smelling it hour after hour.� I never
want to have to go through that again.�
Finally, wonderfully, he allowed me to sleep in my bed.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Chapter 24: There's
something compelling about someone who's comfortable with his sensuality, which
is all in how he goes for the woman and looks at her: Sandra Bullock

&nbsp;

My �training� continued in earnest the day
after he let me out.� I constantly wore
leather ankle and wrist bracelets that allowed him to confine me in different
ways.� He began to groom me for my new
life, always using certain small brutalities perhaps as punishment for my
attempted escape....or perhaps just because I was too slow to learn.� I should have been more prepared; I should
have been more ready.� The routine seldom
varied, but sometimes it did.� A couple
of mornings later, I woke up to the small alarm clock that he allowed me, my
right wrist still cuffed to the wall at the head of my bed.� He freed me and I exercised and then
showered, but he allowed me to eat next instead of fixing my hair and makeup as
was normally scheduled.� 

&nbsp;

He dropped
off the food and left.� Always hungry
now, I immediately began to eat.� After a
moment, I raised the glass of juice to my lips.�
The first sip tasted slightly like ink, just a little off, but it was
still so refreshing I quickly finished it anyway.� I went back to the sandwich and took a small
bite, but after a few moments something rapidly seemed to come to life within
me.� I could feel tendrils spreading
throughout my chest, like fingers of fire coiling around my heart; and on my
tongue was a taste like honey and anise and cream, like mother�s milk and what
I imagined my Master�s seed would taste, like red meat and hot blood and molten
gold.� I picked up the glass and
unexpectedly all the tastes I�d ever known, and none of them, were on my
tongue�..and the glass was still empty.� 

&nbsp;

All of a
sudden, I felt woozy and put the glass down.�
I must have cried out because suddenly he was there.� I would have fallen but for him.� He led me to my bed and lay me down.� Then began one of the most wondrous---and one
of the most terrible experiences I have ever known.� I had the odd feeling of being a marionette
and puppeteer at the same time.� I tried
to move my leg and it felt instead like something moved it for me.� I tried to sit up, but could not.� Instead, I slumped back and stared at what I
could see of the ceiling.� Suddenly, I
was cold, but
could barely move.� My mind and my senses
worked, but I felt lethargic and had no energy.�
The worst part was that I had no sense of free will, it was like my
spirit had been taken from within my body; I wanted to please everyone, going
along with whatever anyone said.� I
didn�t feel like arguing or fighting, I just wanted to cooperate.� I was as placid as a cow and had just as much
willpower.

&nbsp;

I had no idea what he now planned and wouldn�t
have cared even if I had.� Because of
this, it was easy for him to gag and handcuff me, and then lead me to what he
called his �horse.�� After he had put a
harness around my chest and tied it to a rope that led to a pulley in the
ceiling, I spread my legs as he ordered and he put a board between my
legs.� I looked at him with drugged,
trusting eyes as he said, �Woman, you�ll learn to love this.�� 

&nbsp;

I had no idea what he meant and stood there
motionless, patiently waiting for him to continue and for it all to finally
make sense.� I had my back to the wall
and faced him as he suddenly lifted the polished board between my legs high
enough that my toes were almost six inches off the ground.� Then he laid the board into a V-like device
that supported it and stepped back.

&nbsp;

I'd felt passive up to that point, looking only
for an opportunity to please him---or at least not annoy him.� But with this one move, I suddenly felt a
terrible pressure that my mind told me must be a crushing agony between my
legs.� Where before I was listless, I
knew that he was hurting me now and I was positively filled with both the
energy and desire to escape his terrible wooden device.� But even as I struggled in my drugged state
against the horrific apparatus, I nonetheless didn't associate him with the
pain I felt.� But still, I fought the
horse.� And the more I fought, the more
pain it caused.� 

&nbsp;

Soon, I couldn�t help myself; I sat motionless
on his wooden ride, my chest heaving for oxygen, tears streaming from my
eyes.� The crushing pain had finally
beaten its way through the drug induced fog and now I felt a terrible
throbbing, paralyzing ache between my legs.�
At the same time, I felt totally connected inside.� Everything was coupled---but nothing was
united.� The pain ran through me in
rivers of molten force.� And while the
foundation of this awful energy crushed my clitoris and smashed my labia, the
flow continued on through my thighs and belly and from there into my breasts
and face and neck.� Everything was linked
and everything hurt.� But I was helpless;
I had no strength, nor the will left to scream or fight against him.

&nbsp;

It was then that he began whispering into my
ear, crooning softly in a compelling monotone, �Accept it; accept every price,
every throb and rip and tear.� Face it
and when you have, feel the strength it brings.�
Learn from this.� Take it in and
see how it awakens something deep in you.�
Feel it, absorb it�learn to love it.�
Taste it. �Take in to your mind
the pleasure you get with each small gift from your body.� It�s there, if you just allow yourself to
believe.� It�s easy if you just believe.�


&nbsp;

Thankfully, as the minutes passed, I began to
go �pins and needles� numb between my legs; the drugs causing me to lose most
of the association between body and mind.�
The pain had slightly dulled now, but I was foolish and made a small
adjustment with my hips, bringing it screaming back to life again.� God how could one such small, insignificant
move on my part have caused so much pain?�
I lost my breath with my next scream and could only take quick, shallow
pants for air through my nose after that---I needed more AIR!� 

&nbsp;

God, it hurt so much.� Soon, I lost track of time.� I don�t know how long I was there, or what
state of crisis my body entered----maybe I fainted or went into a fugue
state---I don�t know.� But as I rode my
Master�s horse that first time, I know that as I sat there shaking at the end,
I had only the insistent life-beat of my own heart for company, beating so loud
that it sounded several hundred times its size, as big as the house
itself.� Suddenly, something picked up my
consciousness and siphoned it down a long silent tunnel, until I was nothing,
nothing except a thudding, hollow pulse with no geography, no boundaries and
bound by no physical laws.� Even as I
ground my vagina into the wood again, but this time on purpose, there was no
real pain or pleasure.� Instead, I
floated in a vacuum with no awareness of time or existence, bobbing lazily
along like an astronaut in eternity.� 

&nbsp;

I must have ridden his horse for more than half
an hour---or infinity---when suddenly, I was drawn back into my body as it felt
like I might be having a heart attack.�
An empty feeling in my lungs led to an inability to breathe.� Finally, I began to faint.� I tasted
brass and a red haze closed everything out, then it deepened to the brown of a
river clay, then loam and I passed out, thinking �this isn't so bad�..�

&nbsp;

And then it was over and he saved me. �My legs dangled weakly from his wooden beast;
I had no strength left in them as he lifted me and carried me to my bed.� 

&nbsp;

Even though it was early in the afternoon, he
allowed me to lie in bed for the rest of the day.� I felt like I was in a haze of smoke or fog;
or perhaps I was the fog.� I had no
strength to move and no desire to do so.�
That afternoon, as the drugs began to wane I faced the wall and wept
softly, even as I kept my left hand pinned between my aching thighs,
unconsciously caressing and comforting my aching femininity. 

�

Suddenly, the drugs began to be cleansed from
my system and even though I had never lost consciousness, it seemed as if I
somehow awoke to an intense, cold white light that was shining in my eyes.� As the day wore on, I eventually began to
feel more human, aside from a sore vagina and an aching lower back that I
suddenly discovered.� 

&nbsp;

I returned to life slowly, like a bubble rising
in a sea of oil.� I felt as if my essence
were all that existed, and that I had no past, no memories, not even a
name.� I wrinkled my forehead and noticed
how rigid my facial muscles were.� My
mouth was so dry that I couldn't unglue my tongue from the roof of my mouth or
separate my jaws.� There was a glass of
water by my bed and I drank it all greedily.�


&nbsp;

It was then that he took me anally.

&nbsp;

*** 

&nbsp;

I was on all fours, knees
wide spread.� His
big hands were busy, squeezing my breasts as if they were fruit at a produce
stand and he was testing them for ripeness. There was nothing I could do but
try to hold on to my composure and not give into fear. Suddenly, any composure
I might pretended to have fled as he pushed my cheeks
apart, his urgency to take me obvious to anyone with eyes.� I was about to be sodomized, and there was nothing I
could do to stop it.� I was so afraid.� I
wanted to turn and look at him.� But
somehow, with an iron will I lowered my head and resisted an urge to cry.� I was so tired of my childish emotions, but
still, it hurt so much.� 

&nbsp;

&quot;Please, please don't
hurt me,&quot; I begged my Master for the third or fourth time.� I was on the verge of desperation, of
uncontrollable hysteria.

&nbsp;

My Master replied,
&quot;Just relax.� Like I've told you
from the beginning, when you feel your rectum start to open, clench hard with
your muscles, like you're trying to push me out.&quot; He laughed in a dirty
sort of way, &quot;The quicker I'm in your ass, the quicker we're done.� You promise to fuck me back and I'll be
cumming real quick.� You'll only be
helping yourself if you do.�� He
snickered one more time.

&nbsp;

I nodded my head unsurely,
then braced for my next ass-fucking.� I heard my rapist's grunt at
the same time that this horrible pain spread out from the tough muscle guarding
my rectum.� It pinched and it ripped, it just hurt too much and I couldn't keep
quiet as he started pushing inside me.� �Please, I'm begging
you, Master.� Slower, slower please.� Stop.�
I can't take any more.�� 

&nbsp;

The pain became too much and I screamed, earning a vicious
cuff to my head.� &quot;I will make you
bleed, you little bitch, if you move any more.�
You belong to me.� I promise
you'll be hurting like hell and I'll ruin your perfect little shit-chute
forever, if you make one more move that I don't like.&quot; The threat sent me
into a mad panic and I struggled and wriggled mightily to get his cock out of
my asshole, which felt as if someone had just set it on fire. 

&nbsp;

But this just made him enjoy what he was doing to me even more.

&nbsp;

His voice became softer.� &quot;Come on, baby.� Push back, you sweet little bitch.� Try to push me out of your ass.� That's the only thing that'll make this go
faster,&quot; he kept telling me.� I knew
this would never stop, that he'd never leave me alone until he'd satisfied
himself with my body.� I felt him begin
pushing one more time and I somehow strained even harder; suddenly I felt my
sphincter pop open all the way for his perverse pleasure.� I braced myself against what always came
next, him ramming himself up my ass in one huge thrust.� 

&nbsp;

&quot;Ohh, ohh, wait, please WAIT,&quot; I heard
myself beg, but he didn't slow down.� He
never slowed down when he had me like this.�
He was breathing harder and harder, groaning with pleasure as he
dominated me.� I could feel my rectum
spreading for him as he penetrated me like a runaway locomotive, and it felt
like he was pushing my intestines to the side, rupturing me in his haste and
need.

&nbsp;

I tried to rise and he grabbed my breasts, pulling me back down onto my
forearms with my nipple rings alone.� I
somehow forced myself to stay down this time.�
Overcome by one of the worst agony's I could imagine for a woman, I made
no sound.....some pains are too great to permit a scream.� I heard him laugh and the pain grew as he
wedged his thick length of meat deeper into my tight tunnel and the burning
agony inflamed the entire path taken by his erection.� I continued begging
and he finally stopped pushing, but he stayed inside me, keeping my anus pried
partially open to accept his rigid meat. 

&nbsp;

Suddenly, he startled me out of my world of pain as
he began to manipulate my clit.� The man
was insane if thought that would give me pleasure!� But I put my head down onto my folded arms
and tried to spread my thighs a little wider---anything to please him and make
him cum faster.� He kept drilling me,
thrusting deeper and harder and faster.�
His hands were on my hips again, guiding me and keeping his target of
flesh perfectly still.� 

&nbsp;

&quot;Just crouch there and learn enjoy
this, you sweet little bitch!� You've got
a nice tight little shitter, and I'm gonna open it up all the way for you.� You can always thank me later.&quot; He hit
me in the ribs several times because I was responding to the pain and not to
the pleasure of his anal rape.� Each blow
emptied my lungs of air, and soon I felt like I was on the verge of passing
out. Then the vicious pummeling stopped and since he'd never left my body, it
was easy for the anal rape to begin again.�
He battered me with brutal thrusts that felt like a red hot poker was
tearing through me.� I gave up struggling
and just prayed that this beast would quickly finish torturing my sore rectum.� But it was not to be.� He knew his body too well, and always managed
to stop himself before cumming.

&nbsp;

Finally, the pain let up just a little, just enough
for me to think about something other than the fact that I was being
raped.� It was then that he groaned and I
felt him cum inside me.� It was over for
this time.

&nbsp;

God, he always hurt me so much.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

Even though
I had always been a strong, independent woman, my first ride on the wooden
horse left me at first emotionally numb.�
But a few days after my fever broke I suddenly knew that what he did to
me and what he planned for me was intolerable.�
Suddenly, as if awakening from a dream, I felt a fury growing inside me
that knew no bounds.� This feeling then
slid smoothly into a cold rage that almost became madness.� My fingers turned into claws, my nails into
talons.� I hadn't chosen this life.� I was just like everybody else.� I had....goals like everybody else, things I
wanted to......achieve.� I had friends
and a family.� They'd been taken from me.� He'd made me an orphan; everyone I'd ever
cared about, and everyone I'd ever loved was gone.� 

&nbsp;

All I could
think of was how unfair it was; I had too much that I still wanted to do with
my life.� I knew, I just KNEW that I was
too young to give up complete control of my life to another, a stranger and a
sociopath no less.� But this was a
careful man too; too careful to allow me any opportunity to physically
retaliate against him or gain my freedom at this point.� I needed to fight my bonds, keep my sanity
and bide my time�.time was what I needed to beat him at this, at his own game
of power and domination.� 

&nbsp;

As I had
been warned by my readings, I now could confirm that Stage two was that of
Anger.� The anger washed through me and
like a lava flow, it left me burned clean of any sense of ambivalence.� It left me filled with an unyielding hot
energy that made me capable of fighting this monster.� But as before, he continued to be careful to
never allow me another opportunity to unleash this rage.�� And soon, as the hours turned into days, I
regretfully found that my mind was too rational to accept for long this near
insanity that bordered on psychosis.�
Leaving behind only the tiniest feelings of remorse, my driving anger too
finally fled quickly into the night.� I
realized that nothing worthwhile, nothing I truly needed ever lasted with this
man.� Like every other emotion he
provoked, it only worked to his advantage.

&nbsp;

As odd as it
sounds, I raged in an attempt to regain that enervating rage, but mine now was
the false emotion that was only a shadow of what I needed.� I felt betrayed by my own emotions, by my
character at this point.� I needed fire
to fight him and all I had was ashes.�
Without it, I could continue to rebel, but my acts would be the minor
annoyances of a cause that had been abandoned from the beginning.� If your cause was lost, why would you ever
consider fighting on, unless you were irrational?� Everything seemed fated to go his way; this
was so unfair.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

My days had
quickly acquired shape.� He went back to
work; each weekday I would rise early each morning and exercise; after a light
breakfast I went in the box for the day---as I was in it now.� The incandescent fury had departed and left
only a calm determination to never give in to him.� Once I was imprisoned, he would turn a radio
or television on very softly.� Then he
left; to work or to shop or something.�
My captor only let me out when he came back hours later---and sometimes
not even then.� I stretched my body as
far as I could.� Lying in the dark in an
almost fetal position, I never straightened anything but my back.� It always became excruciating after a few
hours.� 

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I slept in
the bed at night when he was home.�
Sometimes he removed the box from under the bed early in the morning and
took me with little preparation.� It was
a toss-up whether he desired vaginal or anal sex.� I had little to smile about and certainly did
not wear a smile at the moment of his penetration, for at night I lay in the
darkness that contained my bed, breathing hard and loud through clenched teeth
as he pumped on my stomach or my back. 

&nbsp;

He possessed
me and I could feel nothing but him.� I
could not move.� His heat and the total
darkness drained my energy.� He ensured
that there was no place for me to go and I was always exhausted when he was
done with me.� Fatigue held me pinned to
my bed, and it grew more every time he finished with my body.� When he would end, I was always panting like
a locomotive and it took awhile to gain control over my body.� But I would finally catch my breath, then I
would sigh in relief and hope to lie there unmolested by him for a little while
longer, perfectly still in the dark.� 

&nbsp;

I was alone,
far from anyone that had ever cared about me.�
And the endless questions I asked myself changed none of this.� But still, they seemed to rise from within,
from a deep and secret place inside me.�
I knew the questions would end only when I could give answers.� But that was impossible.� For the answers were always stuck, tearing at
the delicate fabric of my mind.� And then
I was back in my body; and I could not help myself as I groaned with each of
his moves.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

He was doing
his best to turn me from a woman with pride into a woman who degraded herself
and confirmed every poor opinion a man could ever have.� I fought him, but now found myself sometimes
unconsciously doing my best to formally serve him�it�it just made everything
easier.� At the same time, I'd learned how
to anger him with just small mistakes in the routines he demanded....such tiny
little errors that only a madman would punish me for making them.� 

&nbsp;

I hated
everything about learning how to serve him, how to think about making him
happy.� I had to learn how to crawl
correctly to show my subservience, how to kneel to give him his meal or drink,
and how to rise to my feet again without spilling anything should I be holding
a tray....I had also learned that that these things offered many opportunity
for mistakes.� I'd learned that there are
certain positions that he preferred I assume when he was with me.� That there were certain things I was allowed
to say, and certain ways to say them.�
Other ways were forbidden upon penalty of being spanked again, or worse.� In a way, it had become a game between us;
how far could I go before he had to retaliate?�
I'd always looked upon spankings as a type of punishment used to shape a
young child�s behavior.� God, how I
feared them now.� 

&nbsp;

It was on
this day that he taught me the command �Tiptoes.�� Anytime he said this word, I was to
immediately stop whatever I was doing and go up on my toes and smile at
him.� Even though I resented everything
about him, this by itself seemed stupid and harmless enough at first, so I did
what he asked.� But soon, even though I
had begun to accept other parts of his training program, for some reason
�Tiptoes� seemed different, less harmless; it somehow forced me realize just
how much I was cooperating.� This
absolutely filled me with the need to rebel, even if in just small things, and
led to several more punishment encounters.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I secretly
kept track of the days and it had been well over two weeks now.� Where were the police?� Where was my husband?� Who would save me from this man---from this
fate?� The man I had been forced to
accept as my Master still put me in the wooden container every day, perhaps to
teach me a lesson in discipline, or perhaps to give me time to learn about
myself.� He never told me why he kept me
in it and obviously didn�t care if I suffered.�
I ached everywhere.� Much of was
because of his beatings, but much of it had to be psychological too, and was
based upon the numerous rapes and sodomy's that I experienced.

&nbsp;

While I was suspicious of his food now, I ate a
little just keep up my strength, if only to keep in shape to beat him in the
end.� I ate sparingly of the light meals
he offered, but I still had to eat.� Days
after my first ride of the horse, when he first freed me from the box, the meal
was on schedule and it looked harmless enough.�
And even though I knew the danger, I rolled the dice and lost.� With this meal he drugged me a second time
and again I rode his horse.� 

&nbsp;

This time I fully knew what to expect, but just
couldn�t bring about the emotions to be concerned.� And as before, even though I was weak and
unable to move, the drug allowed him my forced cooperation again.� Even in this drugged stupor I was hesitant,
but still I wanted nothing more than to please him and by doing so, avoid
conflict; and so, for a second time I found myself collaborating with him in
every way that he considered important.�
This time, as blinding as the pain was, a part of me seemed able to
stand separately off to the side.� It
watched and listened more closely this time as he whispered, �Accept it, want
it, desire it.� Use it to make a wall
inside.� The more you take from this, the
stronger the wall.� It's the wall that
makes you so unique, so strong.� Move
with the sensations, bring the feelings in and when they die down or you go
numb, move and bring them back to life again.��


&nbsp;

And I did.�
And it still hurt terribly; I knew he must be insane.

&nbsp;

He had gone along with me for both rides, but
only as a guide, a less than casual observer of my agonies.� When he finally released me that evening, I
wept for several hours afterwards in my bed.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

The box fit snugly
under the bed; my space in it was not much more than five feet long and perhaps
slightly more than a foot high, but much wider.�
A bottle was always taped to the top and I could get water by sucking on
a plastic tube.� I generally lay on my
back and there was no padding on the bottom.�
That might not be so bad, except that my wrists were always bound in
front when he put me in.� The box
significantly constrained my body�s movements.�
It cut-off all light and almost all sound from the White Room.� It greatly restricted the flow of air and the
temperature varied only little in the box, tending to rise a little at the end
of the day.� But odd as it sounds, as
much as I hated the box---and I hated it with a depth of passion that would be
hard for you the reader to imagine---the box had somehow become more comforting
too.� I had begun to look at it as the
safest place I could be; it was almost womb-like to me now.� As long as I was boxed, he couldn't get at
me.� In the box, there was nothing to do
but think, and I tended to think a lot while there.

&nbsp;

My mind had
flipped and it was all I could think of.�
There were worse things than the box.�
For example, I don�t know if anyone can imagine the loneliness of a bad
marriage.� It was so---unexpected.� For me, marriage had turned into an absolute
prison.� And at the time, I thought it
was my husband that had put me there.�
But finally, I realized that I had done it to myself because I had been
too weak to change or leave him.� It was
in this state of shame and complete lack of grace that Master had acquired me
and begun his work.� He'd grabbed me by
the hand and told me I had to walk with him towards what he saw as my future
and away from my past.� And even when I
tarried, he refused to leave me behind.� 

&nbsp;

God, as much
as I hated him, I had to ask---had we had been placed in each other�s path for
a reason?

&nbsp;

I learned a
lot about myself during those hours alone.�
I thought critically about what I�d done with my life and felt
despair� Not because I�d necessarily
harmed anyone, but because I hadn't accomplished anything with it.� I was weak---I�d given in to my
weaknesses---and to him.� On a spiritual
level, I realized that weaknesses like mine brought everyone down at one time
or another.� On an emotional level, I
learned that I needed to hear real voices during this time.� Or more to the point, voices that I knew were
real.� Television and radio just didn�t
qualify.� Perhaps the difference was
subtle, one for philosophers.� But I�d
seen more than one computer programmer done in by that difference at
school.� Hearing things was a bad sign
and seeing things was even worse.�


&nbsp;

Too, I
re-learned an old and familiar lesson, one that I'd learned long ago as a
child.� I was different from everyone
else in this way.� People complained of
discomfort, but not me.� In one way
discomfort was good in that it kept you sharp.�
Most people didn�t understand this, but a few did.� And a rare few like me accepted the
mind-focusing ability of pain---not only accepted it, but almost gloried in
it.� 

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I stopped eating anything he prepared and vowed
to starve unless he gave me only unopened food packaged elsewhere.� There seemed to be a pattern, about every
three days he seemed to want me to experience his horse.� He always gave me the drugs just before
that.� I swore to myself I would never
willingly ride his horse again.� But a
day later, two days before my next scheduled journey on the horse, he drugged
the water bottle in the box---and he kept me that way until I rode for him a
third time.

&nbsp;

It was the sixteenth day---or was it the
eighteenth day?---of my captivity and my next experience with the horse was by
far the worst.� Undrugged, I knew that I
must fight him; drugged, I couldn�t arouse either energy or will.� And this ride was the longest of all, both
physically and emotionally.� It was at
this time that I finally began to understand what he was whispering in my
ear---and I hated the fact that I did.� I
hated myself for feeling what I did and I hated him even more for making me
recognize this thing in me.� The pain no
longer frightened me, but even worse, the idea of enjoying the pain no longer
frightened me.� I had somehow begun to
take pleasure in the pain; I was a circus freak and it was his fault.

&nbsp;

I know that
something vital happened that day.� With
each round of drugs, I found that I recovered emotionally more quickly from my
ride.� And at the end of that third ride,
I remember sitting motionless on the edge of the bed and even though I ached
terribly between my legs, I was staring at nothing on the far white wall when
he leaned into my ear and in a whisper, asked what I saw.

&nbsp;

�What am I
looking at?� I answered his question with one of my own like a brain dead
parrot.� I felt clean and clear of his
drugs, but I was still puzzled by the question.

&nbsp;

�What am I
looking at?� I repeated several more times, both hands cradled comfortingly
between my aching thighs, still staring at the wall.� I can still see myself, sitting, staring at
the wall, finally realizing that I would probably never be free again.� In my memory, I saw myself from the outside
and it�s as if I was suspended in nothing, my silhouette bright and blurred, my
expressionless white face obscured every few minutes by shadows that no one
else could see, no one suspecting the thoughts that flitted crazily across my
mind.� He had begun to succeed and I felt
I was becoming some sort of creepy
parody of myself, or rather, of what I now wanted because of him---I was a
shadow of a shadow and it was that which fulfilled his needs.

&nbsp;

He'd
slapped my face earlier as he disciplined me, and my nose still bled a
little.� I looked down and saw a drop of
blood splash onto my bare thigh, exploding like fireworks in the sky on Guy
Fawkes night.� I wiped my nose with my
hand one more time, and since no one could see me, I licked the red smear from
my fingers.� 

&nbsp;

As much
as one can be �only a little� when talking about something so important, I
think I might have been a little insane at that moment.

&nbsp;

The first
time he touched me that night, at his slightest touch the unsupported fabric of
my pride finally fell to the ground.� My
expiring desire for freedom displayed a sudden luster, flaring to life and
blazing for a moment as I felt my old self try to come back, and then it was
extinguished, perhaps forever.� This man
would win and I knew that he would be my Master.� I had fought him as best I could and would
continue to do so for a little more while, but I knew that it was
hopeless.� In
my despair, I gave way to feelings of doom before the night was over.

&nbsp;

I was so
depressed, just tired of it all; of being drugged and tortured and raped.� I thought of suicide---even though he
restrained me, I knew I was smart enough to figure a way to beat him.� I would win even if it was only in this awful
way.� And although it was not my style, I
found myself on the edge of that last abyss, ready to throw myself over.� In my mind, I walked to the edge a dozen
times and looked down the sheer rocky face of my existence.� I sat on the edge of insanity and dangled my
feet over the edge, thinking of nothing.�
Twice I mentally shifted as if to jump.�
When I finally decided I could not kill myself, it was not for fear of
pain or loss.� The pain would only be a
bright spark and the loss would only be to the man who had enslaved me.� But in the end I found I could not do it, for
it would be his ultimate victory over me.�
I just could not let him win like that.

&nbsp;

Dig down
deep into the blood depths of hormonal bedrock, then look where violence and
sex and power grow fibrously intertwined.�
It was a dark, murky, terribly complicated place down there for a man
like him.� Although he ensured that the
sex between us was common-place, Master didn�t force as much upon me as I had
feared at the beginning of my captivity.�
But what we did have was not erotic; it was painful and demeaning, and
often brutal.� As promised, he often
entered the White Room to take his sex with me, but it could have been so much
worse too.� Eventually, I came to
understand that this was his way of achieving pure physical liberation.� 

&nbsp;

Emotional release he achieved in other ways.� This was not attained by the occasional rape,
but the two times a week, each week from the very beginning, that he regularly
entered my room filled with lust, but not my body; at least not for the
purposes of sex as I knew it then.� I
think it was my soul that he wanted.�
These visits always alternated between my rides on his horse.� He would first pick up the leather wrist
restraints and look at me.� Numb, I had
learned to obey at least in some things and would hold out my hands to him as
he bound my wrists behind my back without a word.� The gag always came next; this too I learned
to accept without complaint.� At this
point, I was now at his mercy and it would begin all over again.

&nbsp;

Never
blindfolded, he made sure that I was always aware of what he planned before he
did it to me.� Emotionally anesthetized,
I numbly accepted whatever he chose to do.�
My Master experimented with exquisite attention to detail; wooden horse
and wooden cross, whip and rope and cane, steel and leather.� Why was he doing this to me?� Even as he led me to his toys, I attempted to
measure the weight of his needs; the power in his toys and endurance of my
body.� And always the question; why me?

&nbsp;

I endured multiple
rides on the wooden horse and was crushed each time.� I finally came to dread the horse, not for
the agony it caused me, but later when I realized my revulsion towards this
pain was somehow tempered with bizarre anticipation.� I am embarrassed to admit that I had by now
learned to almost willingly climb aboard that damned beast.� And when I was in those moods, I rode for my
pleasure, not his, just to see where it took me.� The horse became for me during these times a
thing of beauty; a perfect fusion of wood, metal and leather.� It fit between my legs like another leg.� At those times, it was the perfect
punishment, but more than that, the perfect friend.� 

&nbsp;

I also
willingly stood fastened to his wooden cross, immobilized and prepared for the
shock of the whips and canes and belts that he used upon my breasts and belly,
or my buttocks, back and thighs.� These
too I came see in a different light once he had taken me far enough.� He kept me tied naked to his horizontal bars
for hours on end.� Tightly bound at every
joint, my arms and legs intricately interwoven among the bars.� Ordered to remain motionless, I could move
only subtle fractions of an inch as I tried to bring life back into numbed
muscles and aching joints.� He told me my
skin was like smooth, satin alabaster, and it perfectly fitted the room that
was my prison.� I finally wore his
discipline collars and gags, dildos, nipple clamps and various rope and leather
bonds almost with coarse anticipation; always dreading them at first, but later
accommodating them with a conscious fear of what it meant to my soul if I
allowed him to continue.� And I did.

&nbsp;

Docile as
the stupidest cow, I eventually cooperated with him in every way; but even as I
hated everything he did to me, my revulsion still rang false for it was the
conscious attempt of one who knew she should hate it, not desire
it.� 

&nbsp;

But even as
I screamed for his pleasure into my gag, many times he did not seem to react
with pleasure to what he was doing to me.�
He would whisper in my ear, �Use this as your opportunity.� Become one with the pain and understanding
will begin.� Feel your pain.� Make friends with the pain.�� Then when we finished, he would slowly
release me from my bonds and look down upon me without expression.� 

&nbsp;

My body bent
double with pain; slick with sweat and oftentimes covered with superficial
welts and bruises, he would then free me from my bonds.� In the sudden and complete silence of the
room, we would stand close, as if physically connected.� It always took me a moment to separate from
him, to actually realize that I could.�
Finally freed, he would usually allow me crawl to the bed, and then into
it.� If he'd bound or whipped me, he
would lay me down and sometimes massage soothing lotion onto the welts and
marks he had left on my skin or begin to work out the knots from cramps his
ropes had caused in my muscles.� Most
nights when he did this, I fought the feelings of gratitude that welled up
inside me.

&nbsp;

On other
nights following these attentions, I cried myself to sleep with my left hand
either gripped between my aching thighs, stroking and nursing my bruised
genitals or cradling my tortured breasts.�
During the day these parts of my body were often out of his reach while
I was in the box.� But the worst part for
me was that even while I knew I should still be filled with rage, I recognized
that there was a part of me that had begun to accept as normal what he
did.� What he presented me during these
times left me dizzy in my anguish, yet clearly I recognized that it somehow brought
a new sensitivity with it.� He demanded
so much from me during these times, and I just didn�t know if I had the
strength to visit the boundaries that he continued to re-define for me.� 

&nbsp;

And if I
willingly traveled to them, would I ever find my way back?

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

In return for my promise of shelter from the storm that first
night, Rebecca had numbly accepted the collar which she would never remove
again on her own.� Almost three weeks had
passed and during this time there had been many milestones: her attempt to
escape, her time in the box and her initial experiences with my toys.� At the end of that first night in the rain, I
knew that any sane person would have begun to lose all hope of a normal life
again.� Imprisoned in the box, released
and drugged, riding the lumber; imprisoned again, but released only to feel the
whips and belts and canes.� Feelings of
hopelessness and despair could only accelerate in their intensity as she
continued her training.� It was no wonder
that she had begun to care less and less what happened to her anymore.� 

&nbsp;

Whether exercising or lying on her bed or cleaning the White Room,
cuffs and belts and chains were all that I allowed her to wear beneath a flimsy
robe.� That first day, Rebecca seemed to
acknowledge her status by setting about to quickly learn the schedule I
demanded she maintain.� She did not speak
more than ten or fifteen times during the whole early period, uttering only a
soft �yes, Master� or �no, Master� as was necessary.� It was then that I boxed her and kept her
imprisoned for the rest of the day.� But
she'd tried to escape and I'd punished her severely, as was only appropriate.

&nbsp;

I watched her closely for the next few days and it was then that I
began to offer her the enlightenment of the horse.� Rebecca�s daily routine was not initially
difficult to learn; it had been planned with the idea of keeping both her mind
busy and her body healthy.� As a result,
her schedule easily accommodated any punishments she might have earned.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

When she was not performing some menial routine in the White Room,
I often found her lying quietly on her bed with her face to the wall.� She generally assumed a fetal position and
twice I saw that she was crying.� When I
asked her why she cried, she told me she was in pain---which I knew was true,
and that she thought she was pregnant---which I didn't believe for a
minute.� She was a tough bitch, but I
thought the emotional hammering was finally taking its toll. 

&nbsp;

In truth, I had no idea whether or not she was carrying my
child.� Most of the time, I was pretty
sure it was a scam on her part; surely she was capable of it if she thought it
would somehow help her to be free again.�
But what if it wasn't?� What on
earth was I going to do with a pregnant woman?�
I wanted a woman to dominate; one I could restrain and who respected my
power.� The last thing I wanted was
female with a big belly, aching legs and hemorrhoids in my face for twenty-four
hours a day.�� 

&nbsp;

I had to face facts.� I was
clearly capable of doing bad things to innocent people; but I also
compartmentalized my beliefs pretty well too.�
I would fuck a man up in a heart beat, and most women deserved what they
got from me.� But I drew the line at
hurting kids.� I was hard---I admit all
of that, but I did have ethics---rules to which I adhered.� God gave Rebecca incredible gifts; a strong
mind, a beautiful face and perfect body.�
Instead of doing her best to make men's lives better, she'd squandered
her gifts playing power games with the males that happened to wander into her
web of deceit.� Then he gave her to
me.� And the opportunity to teach Rebecca
her place in life---how to best satisfy men.�
I wanted to fuck her, not baby-sit while she had a kid.� 

&nbsp;

This clearly needed thought.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I was pretty sure that her attempt to escape had been spur of the
moment, unplanned and rather stupid---but I had been careless too and who was
to punish me for my incompetence?� No
one, I guess, except perhaps myself; that was one of the perquisites---and the
responsibilities---of being the Dom here.�
However I might have forced Rebecca to modify her behavior with my
discipline, her total obedience later gave me hope that she might have begun to
accept her new role.� She continued to
play her little game of �mistakes� with me, and we both knew what she
did.� Sometimes she went too far and I
was forced to punish her---but most other times, I blithely ignored her silly
and feeble attempts at disrupting our routine.�
She didn�t like it and her face showed it.� We both knew that she'd sold her soul for a
little security, but she seemed to accept it.

&nbsp;

While I found myself spending more and more time with her, the sex
was oftentimes more or less perfunctory on both our parts.� She submitted and I took as I desired.� I continued to maintain a cool exterior, and
while firm, I also tried my best to be scrupulously fair.� Still, I was forced to bring her pain for
different reasons.� Some times she had to
experience the joy that my toys could bring because they were part of her
training.� Other times I had to punish
her for disobedience.� At first she
seemed unable to recognize her responsibility in these lesser situations, but
as Rebecca became more disciplined, she gained the ability to more easily
acknowledge her guilt.� 

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I had first taught Rebecca the command �tiptoes� perhaps six or seven days after she�d accepted my
collar.� She had willingly complied when
I first uttered this command; her calves were an exquisite sight, bunching and
straining to keep her weight on her toes as she smiled over her shoulder at
me---her muscular buttocks tightly clenched in sympathetic effort, her
exquisite rosy brown puckered hole buried from sight between two beautifully
firm ass cheeks.� 

&nbsp;

But the time quickly came when she saw this as demeaning and
finally refused my command.� At this
point I had already initiated Rebecca to the rice.� Angry at this overt disobedience, I demanded
that she assume the punishment position on her knees for fifteen minutes, but
she silently refused by just shaking her head.�
I had broken one of the first military axioms I had ever been
taught---never give a command that you are not sure will be carried out.� This situation had quickly escalated from a
minor infraction to being a clear challenge to my authority---and we both knew
it.� 

&nbsp;

Without saying a word, I walked over to the equipment wall and
picked up a pair of handcuffs and some rough rope to use on her slave
collar.� Still facing away, she was
watching me out of the corner of her eye as I began to return.� As I got closer, she began to shake her head
saying, �Please.� No, I won�t.�� I was amazed at how much she sounded like a
petulant, two year-old child.

&nbsp;

With this, I charged quickly and picked up her naked body in a
semi-bear hug, throwing her almost like a football onto the bed.� Even as she bounced off the mattress and into
the wall, I leaped after her.� Forcing
her onto her stomach and pinning both of her wrists in my left hand, I quickly
handcuffed her wrists behind her back.

&nbsp;

Keeping her on her stomach, I used the pieces of manila rope to
bind both of her ankles tightly to the back of her thighs.� She kicked like hell and I did my best to
avoid most of her blows, but she still connected twice in my stomach.� Suddenly I was angry for real, the adrenaline
singing in my blood.� I slapped the side
of her head twice, almost breaking my hand on her hard, obstinate skull.� This made me even more angry.

&nbsp;

Although she was subdued physically, Rebecca�s furious curses were
ringing even more loudly in my ears as I finished hog-tying her.� The adrenaline-driven rage that had been gone
for quite a few days had returned.� I was
huffing like a long distance runner as I finally tied a rope around the chains
of her handcuffs and then ran the free end from the back between her thighs and
onto her belly.� After using most of my
weight to force her head down until it was only inches from her knees, I ran
the free end through a loop in her collar and then pulled until it was tight
enough to keep her face almost onto her thighs, but loose enough that she could
still breathe.� I also knew that this
move had to hurt like hell as the metal cuffs were pulled sharply down on her
wrists, but I didn�t give a shit at the moment---I wanted to hurt her.

&nbsp;

She was begging me not to do this because she was pregnant, but I
didn't give a shit what the lying bitch said right now.� I caught my breath and after a minute, I
walked over to the punishment tray and spread a pound of beans on it.� I picked the lying cunt up and dropped her
from a foot in the air onto knees in the punishment tray.� She gave out a cry that was muffled by her
thighs and purposely fell onto her side.�
I knew that the beans would eventually hurt her arm and hip almost as
much as they would her knees, so I left her as she was.� But how could I respond to this
challenge?� What would be enough and what
too much?

&nbsp;

I hadn�t had the opportunity yet to introduce Rebecca to The Discipline and it seemed now was the
perfect time. �Quite different from a belt or normal
whip, The Discipline was a cord-like
leather whip which resembled fine macram� on the business end; it allowed me to
offer Rebecca great pain during discipline, but since it covered a larger area
I could attack more of her body without wearing myself out so.� I planned on using it on her buttocks or back
once a week from this point on.

&nbsp;

From the corner where she lay hog-tied, I walked back to the
equipment wall and picked up the leather flog.�
Snapping it into my hand as I walked back to the disobedient woman, her
eyes opened wide in fear even as she strained to see what caused the vicious
sounds.� I had to be careful.� Flogging could be much worse than spanking
because it's easier to break the skin with a tool like The Discipline.� This was her
first punishment flogging and I�m sorry to say that I beat her ass and hips for
at least three brutal minutes---not hard enough to permanently mar her
beautiful skin, but certainly hard enough to cause great pain.� She screamed for mercy the whole time and
sobbed for half an hour after I finished.�
I then explained that the current disciplining was the result of her
having refused her first punishment.� She
started crying when I explained that she still had to finish the first
punishment she'd been assigned after I finished with The Discipline.� I carefully explained one more time as if to
a child that everything that had happened was for her own good: that she needed
to learn obedience; that she didn't have the adult freedoms now that she had
once so abused in the past; and that like a small baby, Rebecca needed to learn
all over again that willful acts of disobedience did have consequences.� 

&nbsp;

I gave Rebecca a choice when I'd finished flogging her; her
punishment would not be finished until she spent fifteen minutes kneeling on
the beans.� She could begin at that moment
or whenever she felt like it.� But she
wasn�t leaving the punishment tray until she had served the full penalty---and
I had not yet put The Discipline
away.� She seemed to almost physically
collapse into herself, beginning on the inside and finishing on the
outside.� Rebecca spent no more than ten
minutes on her side before she asked me in a small, pained voice to set her on
her knees on the beans.� But I refused.� Before I would make a move to help her, she
had to beg.� There was a stand-off for
another five minutes before this beautiful, stubborn woman would submit---but
in the end, she begged to be punished---and I complied.

&nbsp;

Even though she fought me less obviously on other things, never
again did she fight tiptoes like this.�
Everything was as it should be, for in the end she had learned to
willingly show her perfect body to me.� 

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

She'd been my captive for over three weeks and tonight it was time
for Rebecca to enjoy the ginger again.� I
wanted this to be a little more erotic experience for both of us.� For Rebecca, it was her second figging, and I
wanted to see how she handled it.� I
planned to keep her cuffed during the actual event, but this time I would allow
her to make all the noise she might feel necessary. 

&nbsp;

Vulva and legs freshly shaved, nails freshly done, I had her apply
skin-softening lotion liberally applied all over her body, especially
concentrating on her feet.� Her long hair
was down and blown out; her makeup was impeccable.� Perfectly swollen lips were perfectly edged
and perfectly glossed.� Eyes full of
questions, but oddly not filled with as much life as I had come to expect as
normal, Rebecca donned a black lace garter belt and sheer black stockings that
only further emphasized her perfectly shaped ass and gorgeous legs.� Rings of golden metal embedded in her breasts
and nose, black pumps with four-inch heels, black leather slave collar and
golden hoop earrings completed her costume. I wanted to see nothing but
stockings and heels as she was draped across my lap.� A well-built woman, she let me know again
that she found not wearing support often tedious if not down right
painful.� As usual, I let her know that I
didn�t care about her wishes---she didn�t get a bra.

&nbsp;

I fetched the ginger, but kept it hidden in a small plastic sack.� We walked towards her bed in the White Room;
I led and she maintained position one step behind and to my right, just as
she'd been taught.� I�m pretty sure that
she knew I had plans for tonight, but she just wasn�t sure what.� I laid a thin cane and The Discipline on the bed.�
She stood facing away from me with a carefully blank look on her face as
I sat on the edge of her bed, the bag containing the two wet and cold pieces of
ginger to my right; it was easy to handcuff her hands behind her back for by
now this was an accepted part of her life and she put up no fight.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I had
spent almost an hour preparing myself for him tonight, but tonight it seemed
like there was nothing there when I tried to think.� I had memories of what he'd been doing to me and
I felt emotions, but it seemed like the cord that connected the two had been
cut.� I stared at him for a long
time.� What I saw wasn't registering; I
had a feeling of disorientation.� I
couldn't seem to clear my thoughts.�
There was too much to absorb tonight.�
Suddenly, all I could do was relax; all the energy just seemed to drain
out of me.� The temptation to go to sleep
on my feet was almost undeniable.� But
the heels were too uncomfortable, his collar galled my throat and he remained
yet unsatisfied.� What would he demand of
me tonight?� It didn't really
matter.� All I wanted to do was get
through this and be allowed to go to bed and sleep.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I told Rebecca to lower herself across my lap and she did this
with a little help from me.� Her head was
to my left, freeing my right hand to do whatever might be necessary.� She spread her knees upon my command and she
raised her ass.� It was pooched up into
the air, a position which would make it easier to insert the plug into her
anus.� The skin of her ass and lower back
was still slightly bruised from our earlier encounters, but everything was
healing nicely.� 

&nbsp;

Rebecca was silent at first, but began to quietly ask me what I
was doing as I spread her buttocks apart, baring the beautiful little rosebud
she hid between her cheeks.� I told her
to be quiet or she'd be punished.� She
didn�t struggle, but this was perhaps because she knew it would do no good; she
would never be able to get her feet back under her to stand up and I kept my
left elbow pressed down on top of her lower back and hands---she was helpless
in this position.� 

&nbsp;

First I used my wet finger to rim her, getting her anus excited
and ready to accept a little something extra.�
Once I'd done this for a minute, I spread her cheeks and kept them spread
with my left hand as I removed the cold ginger finger from the bag with my
right.� Rebecca smelled the herb and
quickly took a look over her shoulder---she knew exactly what I wanted tonight.� Crying out, �God, no.� Not that again.� Please, no,� she began to wriggle on my
lap.� I quickly picked up the supple cane
and laid a quick shot across her ass.�
She immediately froze, then forced herself to relax as she draped
loosely again over my lap.

&nbsp;

I began to slowly inserted the ginger finger into Rebecca�s rectum.� I took my time for I knew that the her anus
would eventually accept the cold, slick, wet root.� As I anticipated, her defenses quickly gave
way and Rebecca gave out a soft groan as I slowly slid it into her; first about
half way in so that she could get used to the feeling, and then after inning
and outing a couple of times, I finally pushed it in up to the ring that I'd
carved on the thickest part of the finger.�


&nbsp;

For me, the knowledge that I was now in control of a part of her
body that she had so zealously defended when free---that she was helpless
before me and that only I could remove the plug---that Rebecca knew exactly
what dramatic affects this small root would soon have on her---that I could
either make her beg for more or to remove it---that I could stimulate her
further with other methods of pleasure and pain---it was all the realization of
a fantasy that I�d had about her since we'd met that first day, and one that
I�d had about women in general for years.�


&nbsp;

I knew that Rebecca had to be humiliated by what I�d forced her to
accept today.� But this was all part of
the mental side of being figged; being forced to dress as she had to please me,
the confusion and fear, the nervous anticipation she must have felt as I set up
the evenings� sexual activities around the one area in which she had the most
psychological difficulties, being rimmed first and then the actual figging
itself, and the obvious effects of the ginger itself, some of which were only
now beginning to manifest themselves.� 

&nbsp;

Rebecca lay motionless on my lap and it was simply one of the most
erotic things I'd ever seen as the burning built up slowly inside her.� First she cried out softly as the gentle, yet
persistent warming began to build in her rectum.� This was not a stupid woman.� She'd taken the ginger inside once before and
knew how it would end this time too; but over time I would learn that intensity
of the actual experience took her by surprise each time.� 

&nbsp;

The burning of the ginger plug soon reached for her the frenetic
and irresistible force of a runaway locomotive.�
It must have built to a crescendo within minutes because her breathing
rapidly changed from a fairly quick shallow pant early on to a heaving, lung
filling quest for air that seemed at times unobtainable.� This was a proud, sharp and sophisticated
woman; yet this tiny finger of root reduced her to a quivering mass of
uncontrolled feminine flesh in only a few short minutes.

&nbsp;

As she lay writhing on my lap, I continually stroked the backs of
her nylon clad thighs and then up onto her vagina; there was no part of this
woman that was not gorgeous and desirable.�
Even as careful as I was, the small amount of oils remaining on my
fingers from the anal insertion were still enough to cause her vagina to burn a
little.� With just the merest touch of
ginger oil to her clit, her vagina opened up and her fluid of love began to
literally pour out.� 

&nbsp;

Once or twice, I pulled the finger out an inch or so, then pushed
it back in even deeper before I allowed her anal ring to lock onto the shallow
carved groove again.� As usual, to
increase the burning effects, I ordered Rebecca to clench the muscles of her
butt.� She did this one time, then cried
out dramatically as the burning pain-pleasure must have seemed to increase
ten-fold.� She tried to rise off of my
lap again, but I kept her head down until she stopped struggling.� I could tell that her whole being now
revolved around the ginger root that I had rammed up her ass and it seemed as
if this had suddenly taken away her will to fight.� She wouldn�t willingly clench for me again,
but this didn't anger me since I was both fascinated� and hugely turned-on by what I had on my lap.� I pushed her ass cheeks tightly together for
her and held them shut several more times---she howled for me to stop and
eventually I did.� When she refused to
clench for me again towards the end of her time on my thighs, I caned her until
she complied.� Her tears of frustration
and humiliation were splashing on the floor when I was finally satisfied.

&nbsp;

I pushed her off of my lap and onto her knees.� She faced me as my left hand held her chin up
so that I could look into her face.� I
reached around her left hip with my right hand and grasped her ass.� I ordered her to clench one last time and she
did, holding it fitfully for about two minutes.�
At the end, her whole body was shuddering.� Her shoulders shook and her eyes were closed
as tears leaked down her face; I finally gave her permission to relax.� At about fifteen minutes, Rebecca walked on
her knees towards me until her groin was pushed up against my shin.� She was panting as she did this.� Horny as hell now, she rubbed her groin and
clit against my leg until she came.� 

&nbsp;

Fascinated, I watched as she rubbed her hips and belly urgently
against me, her eyes closed and her mind in a place that only she knew.� Although I hadn�t given her permission to use
me in this way, it was okay because she obviously needed physical release.� And I wasn�t about to fuck her right now and
take a chance of getting any ginger oil on my cock.� After about eighteen or twenty minutes, the
burning seemed to begin to recede and she was now able to put words together in
a meaningful way again.� She was one hot
piece of ass in every sense of the word, and I didn�t have the heart to put her
through the next part where I put the second piece of ginger directly against
her clit---maybe next time?

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I lay across
his lap and remembered the first time.�
The horrified anticipation of what he planned for me cut through the
mental fog like a knife.� I knew what to
expect now and to say that I awaited his next actions somewhat hesitantly was a
massive understatement.� I lay quietly
somehow and willed myself to spread my knees at his command, forcing my thighs
apart as he first ran his cold, wet finger around my anus.� The sensation was really unpleasant and I let
out an involuntary �Mmmmunnghh� of disgust.�
Finally, he touched the ginger to the outside of my rectum; it was as
cold and clammy as the caress of a corpse, and while it stung a bit, it was not
yet unbearable.� 

&nbsp;

My mind
suddenly wandered at that moment and that was good.� It�s strange, the places the mind goes when
you�re under pressure.� I needed the
brief distraction of that odd mental journey while he touched me and made my
rear end ready for the ginger root.� The
actual insertion of the root plug was a minor triumph of the mind for me.� Consensual or not, anal play is something
that I had always before avoided, finding it to be incredibly demanding both
psychologically and emotionally.� What
this man had done to me, what this man had forced me to accept anally over the
last several weeks was foreign and totally demeaning, so completely
humiliating, that it required a psychological submission that to me would have
been unthinkable, literally intolerable only a few short weeks ago.� 

&nbsp;

It was just
as bad on a physical level.� All of the
sensations were uncomfortable, it was extremely uncomfortable at the time of
penetration and I always ached and burned afterwards� Of my own free will, I would never have
voluntarily allowed him, or any man, to insert anything inside my rectum, let
alone have sex in this way.� I wouldn't
have accepted this from any man.� I never
had before and did so now only under duress after being bound.

&nbsp;

He went slowly
and after a few moments I could feel that he�d slid it in partway in.� Something uncomfortable was happening inside me,
the familiar burn slowly started in a way that felt cool rather than hot, like
ice that never warmed to your body's temperature, but it never numbed you
either.� I normally
tried not to swear or be too coarse, but holy fuck, just like before it burned
like fire.� I begged him to stop right
then, but of course, he continued until he'd slowly pushed all of it into me.� I tried to pull my cuffed hands free, but
felt only pain in my wrists and my hands as they writhed uncontrollably behind
my back.� I closed my eyes and felt tears
squeeze out.� But I had no other choice,
so I continued to lay over his lap and prepared myself mentally as best I could
for the rest of what I knew would happen.

&nbsp;

After a few
minutes I was writhing on his lap, unable to get away from the searing flame
that seemed to get hotter with each throb of my heart; a heat so deep inside me
now that it took my breath away. �Even
though it was my rectum that burned with tortured fever, I knew that as I hung
upside down and draped over his knees, my face too was flushed with the
unbearable heat.� Everything burned now,
my face, my lungs, my breasts, my legs.�
Early on while I still retained conscious control over my body, I closed
my eyes and concentrated on riding the burning tsunami of pain as best I
could.� I kept telling myself, you can do
this, you can do this.� And that actually
seemed to help a little until Master used his fingers to finally push the
ginger even further inside me, now stretching my anus with the thickest part of
the root; it was then that I felt my ring of anal muscles lock onto the carved
root and the pain became truly unbearable.�


&nbsp;

It became a
tidal wave of pain.� I couldn't do
this.� Not for him; not even for him.

&nbsp;

I lost any
semblance of control at this point and even though it was impossible to remain
motionless, I still somehow managed to suffer in silence---mostly.� I writhed on his lap.� I crossed my ankles and locked them
together.� I rocked on his lap like a
child.� Nothing worked.� Nothing helped control the agony I felt.� It�s difficult to describe the series of
escalating fiery sensations I experienced.�
I entered a state of extraordinary, exquisitely burning agony after the
first couple of minutes, and that condition continued to evolve to ever finer
tuned levels of pain throughout.� My
entire body from the waist down felt like it was simultaneously on fire and
vibrating at the same time.� I could feel
my heart beating in my rectum and vagina.�
The same burning pulse then raced again and again from between my legs
and up through my head as I hung upside down over his lap.� Every part of my body was on fire and
burning, my nipples, my breasts, my shoulders, my thighs.� My pussy was drenched in response to the
sensations, and my clit became swollen and incredibly sensitive, then
ice-cold.� 

&nbsp;

He told me
to �clench� and I somehow squeezed the muscles of my butt together.� There was an immediate flash of almost
nuclear intensity, and I knew that I screamed in pain, but it was an
unconscious response.� My eyes were
closed and I actually saw what seemed to be fireworks behind my eyelids.� The burning had intensified a thousand-fold
in my lower body, far beyond what anyone could ever reasonably be expected to
handle.� And yet, and yet, on the
periphery of my consciousness I was still somehow aware that he continually
touched me, stroking the backs of my legs and my butt cheeks, parting my inner
thighs and touching my mark of his ownership before rolling my clit between his
thumb and forefinger and cupping my vagina.�


&nbsp;

Always
before, he demanded and I either obeyed or had chosen to willfully
disobey.� But now, he told me to �clench�
again, and for the first time since I had been forced to take his collar, he
required something from me I actually could not give him---the sensations were
just too intense, too painful.� Suddenly,
he began to beat me with a thin bamboo cane that he had set aside.� Crying, I tried to obey him, but I was a
prisoner in my own body as it refused to comply with my conscious wishes.� 

&nbsp;

The cane
smacked down on me again and again.� Even
as I screamed, I could feel the icy burn flare in my anus.� It was worse than anything I could imagine
and yet there were moments when it was worse than that---and then it
receded.� It only took three more smacks
of the cane before I realized that when the cane hit, I involuntarily clenched
my buttocks each time.� Every time I
tightened around the ginger because of being caned, the burn would again
eagerly attack the lining of my ass.� 

&nbsp;

The incredibly
hot sensation was constant---it was too difficult to remain still as he
demanded.� It was out of my control, it
forced me to keep moving constantly and even a hard spanking at times felt
barely noticeable in contrast to my fiery, smarting sphincter.� In fact, a couple of times I wanted him to
hit me harder just to distract me.� At times,
the ginger was so powerful that his blows hardly registered, but the harsh
contact still felt so good.� I tingled
everywhere and my skin felt alive to every sensation after he stopped.� But thankfully,
the beating did not go on for long for I think he knew that as much as I wanted
to submit to him in this, I was made helpless by the ginger.

&nbsp;

Then he
began to play with my clit, and even though I was normally quite responsive to
being touched and manipulated, right now there was just no way that he could
make me enjoy this because the other sensations were just too intense.� There were more than a few times when the
totality of what he was doing was so powerful that I thought I couldn�t take
anymore, that my heart might stop, but my fears didn�t matter to my Master.

&nbsp;

Finally, he
pushed me off of his lap and onto my knees.�
He ordered me to �clench� again.�
Even though it was as if he spoke to me from a thousand miles away,
somehow I obeyed.� For several minutes he
held my face and watched my torment evolve as I submissively and obediently
contracted and released my buttocks around the spicy root for him again and
again and again.� 

&nbsp;

Suddenly,
something seemed to click and the heat became almost a cleansing wave,
purifying me of what I now knew had been my all-too-typical selfishness,
somehow allowing me to now almost revel in watching him take in and use my
torment as fodder for himself.� I was
almost outside of my body watching what went on.� It was at that point that I first embraced
the burning sensations as a test of my ability to function while in pain.� As I acknowledged this new understanding, it
culminated in my becoming even more incredibly sexually aroused.� I didn�t want this, but my body had no
choice---I had to react, I needed a man.�
I knew that my next move would leave me no pride and haunt my sleep, but
the sensations were too strong and my urgency too great.� I couldn't stop myself.� 

&nbsp;

Without
asking his permission, I walked on my knees next to him and began to grind my
pussy into his leg since I knew he would refuse to fuck me.� I watched myself arch my back in order to get
more of the inside of my pelvis closer to his shin---it was the only way I
could rub my stiffened clit against his leg.�
I felt like a dog in heat; an unthinking organism reacting to its
surroundings without control or volition.�
And suddenly, I had what I so desperately needed.

&nbsp;

This orgasm began with a
momentary sense of suspension; all gravity left and I just seemed to
float.� This was quickly followed by an
intense feeling of pleasure that began at my clit and pulsed as it rapidly
spread throughout my pelvis.� My vagina
felt warm and electric and tingly; these sensations then quickly spread
throughout my body.� This understates
what I felt by a thousand percent, but words fail me.� Everything seemed to go on and on as I rubbed
against his shin.� Then finally, at the
end, I could feel the muscle contractions in my vagina and my butt working
together as my lower body and pelvis throbbed and throbbed in unison with the
pleasure.

&nbsp;

After a long
shuddering moment, it was done and the insides of my thighs were wet with my
love juice.� When he eventually helped me
to my feet, my legs actually shook with the intensity of my sensations, my
emotions.� When he turned me around and
slowly removed the root from my rear end; it was such a relief to have it gone.
�

&nbsp;

I felt so
drained afterwards.� I was not used to
this.� I'd made mistakes as a
teenager.� But I had learned from them
and I had never allowed myself that completely uncontrolled freedom with men
again.� While I had as many physical
needs as any woman, I'd learned to control every facet of my life---I'd taught
myself to be satisfied with less than other women expected.� Separate the physical from the
emotional.� It was only in this way that
I could keep complete control over my life.�
But he'd taken that freedom of will away.� For the first time since I'd been
kidnapped---and for the first time in years and years, I'd been forced to bare
my deepest, truest sexual responses to a man.�
For the first time in as long as I could remember, my body and my mind
had been reacting sexually in a coordinated, yet completely uncontrolled
way.� I felt so scared.

&nbsp;

I stood in
front of him and he looked at me with what I could only describe as compassion
mixed with determination.� He was leading
me to where he wanted me, teaching me what he wanted me know.� It was as if we were climbing the same
staircase and he was always a few steps ahead of me, always having to turn back
to look at me, leading me, guiding me to our shared goal.� In the end, he allowed me to lie in my bed after
I undressed.� But all desire or need for
sleep had fled.� Even as my ass and clit
stayed sore and tender for hours more, I knew I would never forget this
evening.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Not
surprisingly, for a woman of her age and life experience, Rebecca seemed quite
experienced with oral sex.� I'd taken her
training to a point where I wasn't too worried about her biting me
anymore.� We were in the White Room and
it was perhaps the second or third time I'd had my new girl on her knees.� She didn't particularly seem to like sucking
on my cock when it wasn't her choice, but she also realized by now that she
didn't have much free will in the issue.�
Training her was like training a puppy, exactly like training a puppy.� I stood near the edge of her bed, my rod
heavy with blood and pointing up at the ceiling.

&nbsp;

On her knees,
Rebecca looked up into my eyes with an impassive face before she returned her
gaze to my cock that stood out stiffly in front of her face.� I watched as her tongue came out to moisten
her lips.� Was the little slave bitch
playing with me, or was she just a little tentative?� If she was playing me, she was doing it well
for the anticipation was almost unbearable.�
She softly touched my cock as she studied it for a second more, then she
finally opened her mouth.� I wasn't
pushing her too hard, rather I was just waiting to enjoy the performance.� Her tongue brushed across the bottom of the
glans and my knees suddenly felt a little weak---having a beautiful woman suck
you off when you know she would rather see you dead is a rather heady
aphrodisiac.� Knowing you can do anything
you want to her mouth is even hotter.�
She looked up at me again, then her tongue went back to its work with
more determination this time as it licked softly about the head and shaft. 

&nbsp;

Every time she
touched me it was like an electric shock.�
Looking up at me with her beautiful blue eyes, she bent forward and
finally slid the head of my cock into her mouth. I groaned, as much from the
soft feeling of the hot, tight wetness of her mouth as for the incredibly sexy
vision working at my groin.� I felt her
tongue play along the bottom of my rod as she closed her mouth around my cock
and began to suck.� Her cheeks hollowed
and suddenly it became slightly uncomfortable.

&nbsp;

&quot;A little
too hard,&quot; I told her and reached down and grabbed a handful of hair.� The pressured lessened, but she still didn't
take more of me in, so I pushed on her head with my hand.� She looked up questioningly and then she
suddenly realized what I wanted.� God, it
was heaven as she took in another three inches of my cock.� I pulled her head back by her hair and her
mouth slid back until only the head was still in her mouth.� Then she leaned forward without prompting and
took me in again. 

&nbsp;

Her head
started moving a little faster as she licked and slurped on my aching
meat.� She worked me like a pro for a
couple of minutes and suddenly, I knew I would explode in a matter of
moments.� Her head was bobbing up and
down as her lips slid along my now moist cock and she had her eyes closed as
she worked on me.� I'd told her what I
liked and I felt her tongue circle the head of my cock as she experimented with
different things.� She pulled off after a
few more strokes and licked along the bottom of my shaft.

&nbsp;

&quot;Oh
yeah!&quot; I said without thinking.�
�Very, very nice.� Good puppy.�

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

His left hand controlled me
as it held the hair at the back of my head, while his right hand caressed my
neck every now and then.� I knew he was
ready to choke me if I tried to bite him.�
But my courage was gone---he was safe from me.� I had taken men and boys into my mouth like
this, but always when I had been in control.�
I knew his type; cumming in my mouth was how he showed his his
superiority, his domination.� I'd
swallowed semen before as a young teenager and hated it.� Never again, I had vowed. I wasn't a virgin;
this had happened to me before, but never willingly and never with
enjoyment.� I felt nauseous, but with his
hand around my neck, there was nothing I could do to stop it.

&nbsp;

I couldn't avoid what he
did to me so my hands were braced on his hips as I tried to at least aim him a
little.� He said something to me, but I
didn't understand it...I was too busy trying to breathe.� My saliva was pooling around his meat and I
was trying not to gag as his hot cock kept sliding deeply in and out of my
mouth.� Like every man I'd had before, he
felt hard but soft and rubbery at the same time, and his penis had a slightly
bitter, yet salty taste.� Master's hand
was in my hair forcing my head forwards and then pulling me back.� His erection was larger than I was used to
and the tip of his circumcised cock was the size of an extra large egg or small
orange, and it was hitting my throat, causing me to gag.� Suddenly he jammed the bulbous head directly
into my throat.

&nbsp;

&quot;Ughh, umphh, ughh,
umphh,&quot; wet, rhythmic, slurping sounds came from around the massive tube
of meat that invaded my mouth and throat and cut off my supply of air.� He was past the area that made me gag now and
completely into my throat.� I could see
pubic hair, but he was so close my eyes wouldn't focus.� I slowly stroked his nuts as he'd demanded
and I could feel it gave him immediate pleasure.� With shock and horrified anticipation, I
realized his cock contracted and expanded as it throbbed in my mouth once....twice...then
I felt a quick molten liquid sensation in the back of my throat, followed
immediately by feeling it pour slowly down my throat like thick molasses.� He was pumping his semen directly into my
stomach.� I hated letting a man do this
to me; all I wanted to do was throw up.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

Her mouth moved
relentlessly up and down my saliva-wet cock now and her hand stroked and
squeezed the exposed part that wasn't in her mouth in perfect rhythm with her
sucking.� Her head started to roll from
side to side as she bobbed up and down and I was in ecstasy.� She was softly massaging my nuts and I
realized that they felt tight and that I'd be spraying the inside of her mouth
in seconds.� When I had her that first
weekend, she�d been so concerned about me wearing a rubber.� I didn't know if it was because she was
afraid of STD's, or just fastidious, or perhaps it had been a control
issue.� But it didn't matter anymore.� None of that mattered now, because as soon as
I took her as an ass-slave, I�d broken her of that habit.� But always before when I'd had her suck me
off, I'd always pulled out before cumming.�
Well, I wasn�t sure if she'd had a man cum in her mouth before or
not---most women had, but now was as good a time as any for her to get
re-acquainted with swallowing shots of fresh cum. 

&nbsp;

&quot;I'm going
to cum, you sweet little bitch,&quot; I told her. �Don't even think about
pulling your head back.�� To ensure that
she knew what I wanted, I grabbed a handful of hair at the back of her neck and
made sure that she couldn't avoid me.�
Rebecca's eyes opened and she looked up at me as though she hadn't
thought about what came next.� She tried
to bleat something, but couldn't speak too well with my cock filling her
mouth.� All she could do was give out a
muffled, �Ummfff.�

&nbsp;

Selfish as
usual, I think the reality was that she'd never been too willing to fill her
belly with semen to please her men.� Her
smooth rhythmic sucking motion faltered for a second as she slowed just a
little.� But my handful of her hair
encouraged her to continue, and soon she had a good rhythm going again.

&nbsp;

Her beautiful
ice-blue eyes widened as she felt my cock swell in her mouth.� Suddenly, I felt a surge of cum rush up the
full length of my rigid pipe like a tsunami and explode onto the back of her
mouth at jet speed.� Rebecca gave a muted
gasp and tried to pull back.� She
succeeded to the extent that the next jet of creamy love hit below her nose.� Her face immediately flushed with
embarrassment, she opened her mouth and let my semen begin to dribble from her
tongue out over her chin.� I pulled on
the back of her head and as she was forced to lean towards me, the next spurt
of cum hit her in the right eye socket.�
Her face was a bright red color now, humiliation burning her skin at
being forced to take my seed like this.�
I used her hair to give her head a good shaking.� Rebecca froze for a second, her right eye
furiously blinking against the white cum that threatened her vision.� Then she slowly began stroking me again.� She squeezed and stroked as if milking a cow,
and as if cheering her determination, a final, weak string of cum shot out.

&nbsp;

She was too
embarrassed to look at me.� I shook her
head one more time and as Rebecca finished milking my manhood, she surprised me
by tentatively leaning forward on her own and taking the tip of my cock between
her pursed lips again.� I was spent for
now, and she moved off my penis as it began to shrink.� I noticed a thin string of cum on her wrist
and I told her to lick it off.� She
hesitated at first, then obeyed and after it disappeared in her mouth, I
watched as she rolled it around with her tongue, trying to decide what she
felt.� With a grimace of distaste on her
burning face, she gave a small shrug of her shoulders and swallowed.� 

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I hated this.� I hated him!�
I wanted to vomit, but knew I'd probably choke on it because my mouth
was already so full.� Finally, he started
to pull out of my throat, then he rested his still stiff erection on my
tongue.� My hands had slid from his hips
somehow and without thinking, I had both of his buttcheeks in my hands.� It seemed as if he'd been resting on my
tongue for minutes, even though I knew it had only been seconds.� &quot;Umphh, uhhh,&quot; I gasped air into my
tortured lungs as the head of his bog cock lay hot and heavy towards the back
my mouth.� Then I knew it was starting
again because he inhaled with a groan just as I felt his butt clench as he
prepared to ejaculate one more time.� I
jerked my head back, but it was too late; he started to cum on my face.� Before I could stop him or even think about
fighting him, he'd pulled on my hair and driven into my mouth again.� But now I couldn't see out of one eye.� Hot tears burned my eyes and I blinked
furiously to regain my cum-soaked vision.�
He made me lick myself clean, then it started all over again.

&nbsp;

His cock still throbbed and
squirted it's heavy, fiery cream into my mouth again, and I barely got a chance
to breathe before he shoved himself deep into my throat one more time.� I fought the need to gag and tried to hold my
breath even as I could feel his pubic hairs brush up against my face.� One pulse, two pulses, everything down the
back of my throat and into my stomach.�
He pulled back to my mouth again, and finally, his hardness began to
fade.� Even as I could feel his cock
shrinking in my mouth, his final gift of semen pooled around the back of my
tongue.� It had a soft, buttery texture
and I could feel most of it begin to thin as it slowly mixed with my saliva and
flowed down the back of my throat and into my stomach. �What was left was leaking out the corners of
my mouth, and I could feel thin lines of the sticky liquid trickling down my
chin as it cooled.� 

&nbsp;

My stomach burned and
boiled with acid, my throat was sore, my jaws ached from being pried apart and
it felt like my lips had split at the corners just to fit him into my
mouth.� I looked at him but could barely
see because of the tears in my eyes.� But
I know he had a smug, satisfied look on his face.� A look I longed to be able to snatch away,
hurting him in the process as much as he'd hurt and degraded me.

&nbsp;

I hated this man.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

It was time to
embarrass Rebecca, take her the rest of the way down.� �Now the rest, bitch.� Clean off your face with your fingers and
then lick 'em.�

&nbsp;

Rebecca's face
was beet red now and her eyes sparkled with unshed tears.� It seemed that she cried so more easily now,
and I wondered if it was a sign that she was approaching her breaking
point.� Slowly, she began to scrape my
cum from her face with her fingers and then stick them in her mouth to suck
them clean.� At the end, I could see one
good sized load resting on her tongue.

&nbsp;

�Swish it
around your mouth.� MORE!�� She flinched, then quickly obeyed me.� I could see the cum traveling from one side
of her mouth to the other, coating her gums and squirting between her teeth and
jaw.� It must have been thinned out
nicely with her saliva by now.

&nbsp;

�Now swallow
again, bitch.�� She hesitated for a long
time.� 

&nbsp;

�Little Slave,
I said NOW!�

&nbsp;

Just as I felt
that I might have to say something more, she swallowed with a shudder.� Finally, I had her use her hair to wipe her
face clean.� It was her final humiliation
for the evening and a nice touch, even if I do say so myself.� I realized that I had a very nice, very sexy
little puppy that I was training.� 

&nbsp;

Rebecca now rose up to a standing position and wrapped her arms around
herself.� I felt good; she was doing a
lot better, but her behavior was still less than satisfactory.� Her response to my commands had been a little
slow; her obedience still wasn't instinctive yet, but I felt that we'd made
great progress.� I grabbed her arm and
led her to the end of her bed.� When we
got there, I told her to assume the position.�
She knew immediately what was in store for her and even as she begged me
not to hurt her, she obediently complied with my order and bent over the end of
the bed.� She'd earned another spanking
for not obeying me quickly enough in the lesson we'd just finished.�� Perhaps, I thought to myself, it wouldn't be
a pure punishment spanking this time.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

It's been
over three weeks.� No one is coming to
save me, I know this now.� If I ever hope
to regain my freedom, it will have to be on my own.� I still miss my husband, but I think of him
less each day.� Even though he hasn't
come for me, I know he would do anything to save me.� I have to believe this or I would have lost
everything from my previous life.� 

&nbsp;

I knew I
must have been clinically depressed, but there was nothing I could do.� All I wanted to do was sleep.� An immense lassitude had taken over my body,
carrying me into a deep well of lethargy.�
My eyelids always fluttered against their will, begging me for rest, for
sleep.� The part of me that was conscious
deep in the back of my mind always tried to warn me, but I could never seem to rouse
myself enough to care anymore.� 

&nbsp;

Now I worked
slowly on the mark that the man I have to call Master gave me that first
night.� At first looking raw and fresh
and pink, the black of the brand on my inner thigh was mostly gone, the skin
picked clean of cooked debris.� The way
he made me clean it has ensured that.�
The only way I could do this was to stop thinking of it as living
flesh.� I told myself it was the soft,
buttery leather they used for couches and car seats.� I worked on it as I would a piece of
furniture, except that it bled sometimes.�
But even these tricks didn't help all the time.

&nbsp;

A week of
picking at the dead black crust with tweezers, first me, then him while I was
unconscious, then me again.� Then another
week of keeping it open with more picking.�
Finally, he made me use a soft toothbrush, gently at first, then more
roughly.� Scraping and brushing it clean
and keeping it freshly open at least twice a day.� This too went on for days and it hurt every
time I did it.� But as with so much else,
I've learned to bring the pain inside and nurture it.� At the end, I had what he wanted me to
have.� Three small concentric circles
almost hidden by my labia, a irreversible mark of ownership that stood out
starkly and clearly from my skin.� An
ownership that no one could deny anymore.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

The box had served its purpose and I no longer kept her crated
during the day.� Her collar was now
chained to the track in the ceiling, allowing her some movement during the time
I was gone.� In her eyes, I could still
see traces of the effects of training she'd gone through during the last three
weeks.� She had good days during which
she was incredibly well-behaved.� And
there were bad days during which she seemed more confused than anything.� In between, there were times she was just
willful, prone to fits of anger, but this was understandable after what I'd put
her through.� 

&nbsp;

By this time, I�d spent more money on clothes for her than I�d
planned.� By clothes of course, I mean
lingerie, stockings and high heels; all the things that made her more sexy and
glamorous in bed.� But she didn�t seem
particularly appreciative and I had to lay down some rules.� She didn't like wearing stockings and at
first she went through them like a reaper, wearing a pair once and then
ensuring that they�d been destroyed.�
This was another of her passive/aggressive acts and it annoyed the hell
out of me.� Finally, I made a rule that
she washed and cared for each pair of stockings herself and that each pair must
be worn run-free at least three times.�
Any runs earlier than that earned discipline.� It actually turned out to be one of my better
rules.

&nbsp;

Even as I found myself wanting to come to her more and more, both
as my needs arose and as she finally began to accept her fate, she continued to
confuse me.� She still pretty much an
emotional blank to me, and I knew our sex was nothing but a physical act in
which she felt forced to participate.�
This wasn't what I had hoped for in the beginning.� At the same time, there had recently been a couple
of times where I was sure that I had uncovered some true emotions.� Regardless, with everything she was forced to
accept from me, at least for the moment, my emotional and psychological needs
were overwhelmingly being met by Rebecca; both what we did together and what I
could to do to her.

&nbsp;

The woman was full of contradictions.� For example, when we were first together, she
had no problem with being naked in front of me.�
But now it was different.� After
I'd collared her, I allowed her a sheer robe to wear some of the time and
nothing else.� For some reason, this type
of nudity made her extremely uncomfortable now---both psychologically and
physically.� I guess it actually was more
the discomfort of not having a bra for support which bothered her the most.� This in itself was not bad for it
automatically gave me an additional level of control as she begged for
something to wear that would support and sustain her breasts.� In addition, she also asked for panties to
wear.� The last was ridiculous.� All of these needs, I knew, were mostly
mental.� 

&nbsp;

But three weeks had now passed and Rebecca seemed continually
frustrated over this issue.� She had an
absolutely exquisite body, and I admit to an almost adolescent desire to see
her always naked.� But her begging
requests for something to wear for support became more and more frequent.� What I didn�t understand at the time was how
truly uncomfortable she was and how much she needed something that supported
her during the more strenuous activities I demanded of her during the day.� I finally realized that she would continue to
fight me on this and that there was an easy compromise.� And so, I gave my slave her first new outfit.

&nbsp;

I now understand the emotional impact of the clothing I gave
Rebecca; it was like something designed by a teenage boy whose adolescent
hormonal fantasies had outstripped his common sense.� Even though it was a difficult time for us
both at first, I still have to smile at the memory of Rebecca seeing her first
slave outfit.

&nbsp;

There still existed a spark of stubbornness within her at that
time and it came out at the oddest times.�
She held up the tiniest black bikini top I could find, along with
matching thong bottoms.� I'd decided that
she could wear these only during exercise time, but for this viewing she would
wear heels too.� I wanted to see her very
shapely legs wearing a pair of black high heels that consisted of nothing a
sole, a heel, and some straps to hold it all together.� She donned the bottoms and they covered just
enough of her butt crack that they looked like ass-floss.� Very sexxxy.�


&nbsp;

Ordered to put the top on, she was to flip the nipple rings up so
that each rested on top of her breast.�
She was then to thread the straps that were attached to the top of the
tiny cups through her breast rings before tying them around the back of her
neck.� I thought this would please her,
finally having something to wear that provided support but which was still
visually pleasing to me.� But at the end,
she refused to cooperate and so we had another confrontation.� I was angry and she was upset with me; she'd
forgotten that she didn't have that luxury anymore.� I was pissed at my puppy because we both
should have been happy.� 

&nbsp;

I'd told her to walk around the room after she'd put the bikini on
so that I could see how she looked, but instead I found that I had a bent-over,
crouching female that continually tried to cover herself.� She really was quite conservative at heart
about some things, and I think the bikini and heels made her feel more naked than
if she were actually unclothed---Rebecca was trying to make herself as small as
possible while simultaneously refusing to move her feet.� 

&nbsp;

�Stand up and walk around the room,� I said hoarsely, but she
shook her head furiously.� My full-armed
swing landed on her nearly naked buttock and produced a loud �smack� as it brought her up onto her
toes.� When Rebecca tried to crouch
again, I held my open hand in front of her face.� Her beautiful blue eyes opened wide as I
threatened her again.� She opened her mouth
to say something, but shut it without saying a word.� Her nose ring moved as I heard a soft mumble,
but I could not make out what she had said.�
If it had been intelligible, I would have had to respond.� But this way, I could ignore it.

&nbsp;

�Walk,� I said warningly.

&nbsp;

Her glare was enough to slay wild beasts, but after a second her
face cleared and became blank as she slowly straightened.� Then without any apparent consideration of
the beauty that she revealed by this move, she began to slowly glide around the
room for me.� The Denholm lilt was back
and God, was she fucking gorgeous!

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

For some reason, it was only after this event that she opened up a
little and we finally began to talk to each other.� The process of breaking in a new slave has
often been compared to the work of a skilled restorer of paintings.� With immense care, the outer layers of grime
or later paint were erased from the original canvas one layer at a time to
reveal the hidden value beneath.� Just
so, as I worked on this woman, I began to expose layer after layer of beliefs
and memories that had been hidden or overlain with newer, learned values.

&nbsp;

Rebecca was no longer quite as angry and seemed to accept the new
rules in her life a little more easily now.�
Having discipline in her life was still fairly new at this point and I
continued to use it to shape her behavior.�
We talked about the dominant/submissive duality in each of us; and as we
did, I felt our relationship became more formalized in the roles we each had
and a little more consensual in nature.�
It was at this time that she finally began to realize that being
submissive meant more than being there whenever I felt the need for a
fuck.� It meant looking for opportunities
to show respect for me and my position.� 

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

Things seemed to be going better.�
Perhaps it was nothing but wishful thinking on my part, but I had begun
to notice for the first time that she seemed to be almost resentful or perhaps
afraid of being left alone during the day.�
When I came home at the end of work now, she often met me with a small
smile.� 

&nbsp;

At the same time, I saw a change in myself too.� I found myself beginning to enjoy being with
this complex woman even as I worked to change her.� Much of my anger at the world seemed to have
fled.� She too seemed less angry now,
somehow having become more understanding of both our roles in our private
drama.� When she was like this, open and
apparently happy (at least not overtly unhappy as before), the future......the
potential for our fitting seamlessly together as something more than two
individuals was never more apparent.� She
was becoming more in touch with her submissive side every day, and with the
right person, Rebecca had finally begun to realize how much she had to
offer.� Obviously, I did not tell her how
I felt, instead just feeding on her delightful presence like a starving man
presented with a banquet.

&nbsp;

On the flip side, my headaches still bothered me
occasionally.� My head twinged.� An excruciating hard-under-soft sensation
that made me think, for some reason, of when I had first pierced Rebecca.� I wasn't feeling any definable pain, but
there was a sickly instability underlying the mental numbness that I knew had
set in at an almost cellular level.� A
soft red rush that wiped away reality in smudges of pink and gray.� I found I sometimes took our encounters too
far when I used her in the White room at these times.� But Rebecca survived without obvious physical
or emotional damage, and perhaps in an odd way, might even have found herself
looking forward to the encounters during which we greatly expanded the limits
of her previous vanilla world.

&nbsp;

We began to talk about intimate things that affected us both.� Although married, Rebecca was as much of a
loner as I.� One night she talked about
how tired she had finally become of having people buzzing around her around
like flies.� And of how at first she had
thought it important to be surrounded by people, but how at the end, they just
reminded her of how alone she was.� I
found myself during the day looking forward to our talks at night.� 

&nbsp;

I began to think more and more about this woman; what had I gotten
myself into?� She'd told me several times
that her period was late and I began to wonder if this was the truth.� I was more convinced than ever; I certainly
didn't want a pregnant woman.� I had no
desire to control a woman with a big belly, listening to her complain about how
bad she felt.� I didn't want a woman
whose belly and hips were covered with stretch marks.� What the hell would I do with her then?� 

&nbsp;

This led to other lines of thought.� Other than sheer bloody stupidity and anger,
why had I taken this last step?�
Kidnapping and torturing a female, keeping her bound like a dog for
weeks and months.� I could have treated
her like all of the other wives I'd used over the years; get some leverage on
her, bring her in, fuck her brains out, then kick her out of my bed and out of
my life.� Instead, I forced her into my
private life, into my tender care.� What
on earth did I want at the end from a woman like this?� What did I want from her over the long
term?� Even though I knew exactly what I
was doing when I manipulated her mind and body, if I was honest, I also had to
admit that many of my actions up to now had been dictated by either sheer lust
or bloody anger at what I seen as her endless arrogance; everything had been
short term thinking only.� The truth was,
at this point I just wasn�t sure what my next step would be.� 

&nbsp;

But the more I thought about it, the more it seemed that she might
have purposely put herself in a position in which she was forced to choose
between destroying her life or accepting the collar and all that meant---or was
it just my imagination?� Was I just
attempting to justify my actions by putting the responsibility back onto her?

&nbsp;

To a large extent, I truly believe that there is a period of time
in which newly paired Doms and Subs attempt to 'match frequencies', rather like a radio transmitter and
receiver.� Was she, as I thought,
subconsciously a submissive that had all along been 'seeking' a Dominant partner like me?� Had she opened her outer barriers in what was
an effort to 'align' with what she
unconsciously saw as a potential mate that was so much more suitable than her
current husband?� Stupid me; I'd wanted a
woman that I could keep and sexually dominate over weeks and months, but had
not really thought about the long-term reality afterwards.� Instead of a sex slave, what I had now was
complete responsibility for a complex female, all of which was wrapped in
questions and riddles.� I resolved to��I
didn�t know exactly what I would do.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

It was
shortly after he had given me the black bikini.�
I was still unhappy that he allowed me only this when I exercised.� Our �relationship� had reached a point where
although I said nothing, I could safely ensure that he was quite aware of my
feelings.� With a small smile, Master
walked into the White Room holding up two pieces of cloth that together would
have made one decent skirt.� At first
glance, the top was a simple halter which would provide only the briefest
cover; the triangular fabric just might cover my nipples alone.� But the weave was of some odd material that
changed color as the light hit it.� Small
as it was, the look was quite spectacular.�
The �skirt� that accompanied it in the same fabric, was brief to the
point of scandal in any other place.�
Short, very short, and slit up both sides.

&nbsp;

�There are
some panties as well,� Master said.�
��But with this, even a thong might show.� So I left them off for now.�� He grinned as he could see the color begin to
rise in my face.� No doubt familiar with
the conservative clothing that I had typically worn before his arrival in my
life, I think it pleased him to be able to embarrass me again even after all
that we had been through together.

&nbsp;

�It
looks�..tight, Sir,� I said hesitantly.�
�I�m twenty-seven years old and haven�t ever worn anything like this.�

&nbsp;

�It is
tight,� he replied.� �I looked at some of
your other clothing and figured they would be a little loose on you now.�

&nbsp;

�I like it, Master,� I replied, making a slight moue of
distaste.� I slipped off the robe I wore
and stepped into the skirt.� It had two
buttons in the back and I found it easier to slide them around to the front to
button because it was so tight.� The
buttons gave no sign of straining, but I had to struggle to get them in the
holes.� I also had to pull it down hard
onto my hips to obtain any decency.� The
halter top was tight as well.� As I had
feared, after I had threaded the halter straps through my breast rings, the
tiny triangles barely covered my nipples.

&nbsp;

�That is
just lovely on you,� he said, looking at me with a strange fixed
expression.� �Just right.�� I couldn�t help myself; I froze as he pushed
my breasts up into the halter; the bottom of my breasts showing a goodly amount
of flesh.� �Perfect.�� With this comment, he walked out of the room
and left me alone.

&nbsp;

I knew that
I would have trouble trying to move with this skirt on, let alone sit down
without showing everything I had.� Why
this concerned me, I didn�t know, but it did.�
Finally, I solved this problem by teaching myself to sit by pointing my
toes and rolling down onto my legs.� It
turned out to be a graceful way of sitting without spreading my legs or showing
anything I didn�t care to show to an audience.�
In the end, it turned out to be both an elegant way of sitting as well
as being, well, alluring.� Grand.� I had just discovered a graceful and sexy
motion to further entice the man that kept me imprisoned.� Great.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

At the end
of what must have been around three weeks or so, he made me begin a different
schedule, one consisting of exercise in the morning, showering and preparing
myself for his company, eating, then cleaning the White Room before I was
allowed to read for thirty minutes.�
Often I slept after that.� 

&nbsp;

He must have
had a way to watch me without my knowing, for he would often ask me questions
in the evening about my activity during the day.� He ALWAYS knew when I left something
out.� At first I tried to fool him.� If I actually lived in an invisible prison I
finally learned, I had to assume that he was still somehow watching all the
time.� I�m alone, I thought to
myself.� Yes.� Completely alone.� But I taught myself to put on a mask that
made me look alert, diligent and ready to obey.�
But he always knew in the end when I was real and when I was false; and
I was always punished for these little dishonesties.� His reprimands were immediate and I must
admit that I earned them fairly; as a result, I finally learned that playing
games with this man brought great penalties.

&nbsp;

The book had
said that Stage three was Bargaining.� As
experienced as I was, I had no real idea of what my life would be like when I
had granted to him my freedom.� Three
weeks after, I knew I�d made a mistake, but I also knew that he would never let
me go now---there was no going back.� 

&nbsp;

If
negotiating was Stage three, I went through it quickly.� I didn�t know; how could I make a deal with
this man?� What would I say?� �Please, I enjoy talking with you, but I want
my freedom back.� I know that you want a
woman.� Take someone else.� I�ll even get them for you and I promise I
won�t tell.�� I had too much pride to try
to bargain with this man.� Eventually,
this changed too.� And like they say,
pride goes before the fall�..and fall I did.

&nbsp;

He looked at
me like a parent would with a stubborn child.�
�Freedom is the biggest myth ever created for a woman like you.� To all but a very few, it�s a destructive,
unachievable goal that has caused a great deal of pain.� Very few people can handle total
freedom.� A woman like you is most often
happy and healthy when you have clear boundaries that are defined by
others.� It�s inevitable for you.� If not me, then you would unconsciously be
looking for someone just like me.� There
is no way that you could stop yourself in the end; no negotiations, no
compromises, just dealing with the reality of your situation.�

&nbsp;

He
continued, �Life has dragged you into the situation you find yourself in
now.� Don't blame yourself for what
happens.�

&nbsp;

�Life doesn't
drag you along, Master, if you don't let it,� I pronounced, convinced I'd said
a great truth.

&nbsp;

�Are you
sure?� he asked sarcastically.� �I know
someone who wasn't very free when it came time to choose her destiny just a
little while ago.�

&nbsp;

I wondered if
he was right.� Everything I thought I'd
believed in had fled or been taken from me---in my heart was a naked hole and
all I could do was think of what this would cost me if he was right.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

The man had
taken me multiple times in the last three weeks. �Not brutally most recently, but not with
tenderness either.� I know at first I
performed mechanically, but I didn�t care to do better and he seemed
semi-satisfied.� Soon, I guess he felt
the need to begin to experiment even more; pinching and twisting, thrusting and
biting as he raped me.� Then things got
even worse within a couple of more days; he hurt me to motivate me.� Anything to make me move beneath him.� 

&nbsp;

I was a
rational person, not impulsive or emotional---so I tried harder for him,
because it just seemed easier at the moment.�
And even though the things he did hurt me some, I��..I have to admit
that there were moments when, if these had been normal times, they might have
felt good, far too good.� I never tried
to give him the satisfaction of visibly appreciating his efforts, but there
were a few times when at the end I wasn't in total control, a few moments that
I wasn't thinking only of the role a sex slave must perform.

&nbsp;

The first
time he came in me weeks ago, as soon as I felt his scalding hot love
blossoming so deeply inside me, I knew that my life had changed for good---that
I had lost all control over everything in my life.� There was no going back now.� He would never let me go.� And each�
time I had to be with him like that only reinforced my sense of freedom
lost forever.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

My right
wrist was cuffed to the headboard as I lay in bed thinking about my
future.� I'd looked in his eyes each time
when I told him.� I could tell that this
was the last thing that he wanted to hear or think about.� But what he wanted didn't matter now.� It was done and I knew I was pregnant; it was
only my intuition at this point, but somehow I just knew.

&nbsp;

He was a man
that wanted nothing more than absolute power over me.� He was a sociopath and a control freak.� But there were other sides to him too.� He'd hurt other women and he hurt me.� But there were also times of remarkable
tenderness.� 

&nbsp;

He was like
an out-of-control car that spun in circles, yet he was a man that still somehow
managed to maintain the fiction of control in his life.� What kind of man was he?� How would he react to something that was
finally out of his control?� Something
like my condition?� Was there still
enough discipline in his life that he could maintain the vestiges of
self-control?� Or was he capable of doing
something unthinkable?� After some
thought, I knew that the power he held over me scared me, but I also realized
that I wasn't frightened of him in that way.�


&nbsp;

What would
he do?

&nbsp;

When it
finally became obvious to even him that I was carrying his child, I prayed that
he would let me go.� I would promise him
anything if he'd let me go.� We both knew
that I had no other options; I had to keep my promises just to avoid the
police.� 

&nbsp;

I was
optimistic about my future for the first time in weeks; filled with hope and
flooded with relief in anticipation that my nightmare would soon be over.� With feelings of almost smug satisfaction, I
reveled inside that the best part was that my only route to regaining the
freedom he had stolen from me would be through him---due solely to him and the
unthinking way that he had satisfied his needs with my body.� Do what feels good today and forget about
tomorrow; forget about the consequences of your actions.

&nbsp;

Was I a
hypocrite to feel this way?

&nbsp;

I didn't know
what I would do once he let me go.�
Obviously, I couldn't keep the child, but what would I do then?� Deep inside, I had to admit that I'd begun to
develop a taste for.....the disturbing thoughts that ran through my head all
the time now.� I shut down that line of
thought immediately, for I knew that what I had begun to feel was wrong, but
that didn't matter somehow.� I felt the
way that I felt, and there was nothing I could, or wanted, do about it.� 

&nbsp;

All I could
handle was one major change at a time.� I
fell asleep satisfied that my life would be changing again soon.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

Early
in my captivity, it became clear that my body was reacting terribly to what he
did to me....and what I feared he would do.�
My stomach was always knotted as I went through his training
program.� I tried to steady myself, but
everything mocked me.� Shapes shifted and
sounds came and went.� I woke up each
morning knowing with absolute certainty that something new and generally
horrible would happen to me.� I felt like
I had to go to the bathroom all the time and with the same intensity of a grade
school kid that had just been called to the principle's office.� As the days and weeks dragged, these feelings
increased dramatically.

It was the next
night and he'd forced me to have anal sex about an hour earlier---and I was
still trying to recover from it.� The
worst part was that he'd made me assist him; I'd had to hold my cheeks apart to
make it easier to be assaulted.� I knew
that I was finally resigned to becoming what he called his �ass-slut� when I
cooperated without thought or resentment.�
The worst part, the thing that shamed me the most was that after so many assaults, the pain and discomfort no longer totally
overwhelmed any pleasure I might have found in it.� 

&nbsp;

He'd laid me on
the bed and ran his hands over my body.��
&quot;I'm going to fuck your ass....again,&quot; he said in a quiet, yet
commanding voice.� I didn't want this---I
hated being used like this.� But there
was no discussion here, no room for doubt, no preamble, no foreplay.� I knew I had no other choice but to
submit.� Already naked, it was easy for
me to silently, obediently, get on my hands and knees on the bed, and wait for
him to put on lubrication.� I hated my
role in this, the feeling of waiting to perform like a trained animal.� 

&nbsp;

When he was
ready, he climbed on the bed behind me.�
His right hand went on my right hip while his left was under me,
supporting my belly.� Then he pushed my
head and shoulders down towards the mattress.�
He wanted my ass in the air, but my face down.� I understood why when I finally assumed the
desired position and both of my hands were free---he told me to part myself for
him.� I hesitated, but he repeated his
order a little more sharply.� 

&nbsp;

I submitted to
the inevitable as I rested my cheek against the mattress.� And when I had opened myself to the cool air
of the room for his pleasure, I felt him lean into me, the front of his thighs
pushing against the back of mine.� I strained as I'd been taught and felt my sphincter pop open as I
facilitated his entry once again.� Ever so slowly, he penetrated my defenseless rectum and slid his thick,
oversized cock inside my bowels.� As big
as he was, the pain was familiar, intense, extreme; but but I managed to
control my reactions and just groaned in discomfort.� 

&nbsp;

All he said as
he impaled me was, �Defy me now, Little Slave.��
Then he pulled out one slow inch at a time before he slowly drove
himself further inside me.� Out again and
then in one more time, more and more was buried inside me each time.� The feeling was indescribable---it felt
awful...........with shock, I hated that it suddenly.........didn't feel
awful.� It made me want to cry for my
lost freedom, it made me want to mourn for my dominated femininity, to defend
myself by killing him, it made me want to scream for him to hurry and ram it
deeper into me.� None of these and all of
these.� I fought the feelings, but soon
realized that the desire to succumb continued to grow and grow with each move
of his hips.� 

&nbsp;

Master was totally inside
me now so I didn't have to keep holding myself open for him.� I put my head down to my folded arms and
tried to spread my thighs just a little more.�
The pinching, tearing pain in my rear was finally letting up just a
little and I could feel my vagina getting wet.�
I knew I groaned in parallel to his body's plunging rhythm.� 

&nbsp;

�Uhh, uhh, uhh, ohh, uhh,
ahhhhh, ouch, uhh, uhh, ohhhh.�� I moaned
and occasionally cried out as he drilled me with a move that was just a little
off from what he'd been giving me.� I
felt his deep strokes fill my bowels and then my belly.� He filled me so completely, it felt like he
was banging on my diaphragm; I couldn't breathe.� The pain was less now, but I still felt
abdominal cramps as if I were terribly constipated.� But he went on with machine-like thrusts that
never slowed, never changed rhythm.�
Always too deep and never concerned with my pleasure, only his.� Then he began to squeeze my breast.

&nbsp;

�Ahhh, aaaawwww, gaaawwd.�
I moaned in new pain as he squeezed and pulled back on my left breast, then
switched to the right.� He kept me
impaled even as leaned over my back and grabbed both of my breasts and began
harshly squeezing them.� He used them
like reins, guiding me to exactly where he wanted me to meet his next
thrust.� There was nothing I could do
except raise myself up a little on all fours, then arch my back and accept him
even deeper as he continued squeezing.� 

&nbsp;

For the first time, I felt
a warm rush in my pussy as Master worked my nipples.� Suddenly, my face was burning with shame as I
realized that I was slowly responding to him, unconsciously moving my ass,
grinding my butt into his loins, encouraging him without thought or plan to
fuck me harder, deeper.� When I realized
I was pushing back each time he penetrated me, I began to cry.� He was raping me!� Why was there an odd, hot tingly feeling in
my belly?� Why did my vagina feel like it
was vibrating?� God, admit it.� Why was it starting to feel good in an
obscene sort to sick way?

&nbsp;

I wanted to say, �More,
yes, give me MORE.� �But I was almost in
shock at my unwanted feelings and definitely in denial.� Then without conscious thought, I suddenly
screamed as his iron control of my body swept my entire being before him---he'd
rammed his cock up my ass deeper than he'd ever been before.� But it wasn't enough, he wanted still more of
my body.� Grasping my hips, he slammed
into me one more time and buried himself as deep as he could get.� Finally, his burning hot cock began to pump
cum in huge spurts and jets.� 

&nbsp;

I will never forget the
feelings I experienced that night, for all of my senses were working overtime
and everything was branded in my memory forever.� I could hear us both breathing too fast,
grunting with exertion.� The thrill of
giving myself over to sheer physical abandon beckoned, even as I could taste
the coppery feeling of defeat in my mouth and smell it off the mattress upon
which I was being raped.� I could feel
his breath on my back, his hands on my breasts and hips, his thighs straining
against the back of mine, his veined, knobby rod expanding and contracting with
each hot spurt it injected into my ravaged, yet somehow welcoming bowels.� 

&nbsp;

I couldn't help myself as I
dropped my head to my folded arms and began to cry.� First, I thought, why me God?� Why me?�
Then it was, God, he wasn't done yet!�
My whole body shook with emotions and palsy as he began to slowly fuck
my ass again.� He pulled out, then
wanting more, he pushed back in.�
Unfeminine sounds came from my rear-end as he plunged inside me, and I
could feel his hot sperm squirting out between my rectum and his cock.� I could feel it as it ran in white and
dark-brown tinged rivulets down the insides of my thighs.� I looked back at him over my shoulder and
begged him to finish quickly.

&nbsp;

But even as the
pleasure seemed to grow inside me, so did the need to rebel grow in proportion
too against this self-satisfied, self-appointed slave master-man; it continued
to grow until the intellectual need to do everything in my power to keep him
from thinking he'd won was battling on equal terms with my aroused body.� He felt he knew me, but I refused to let him
win like this.� But he kept on driving
into me and eventually I knew he would have to win, for all I could do at the
end was anticipate my pending orgasm with a sense born equally of wonder and
catastrophe.� 

&nbsp;

He was taking
too long and I moved my hand to stroke my hard, tiny button. &quot;Don't touch
yourself,&quot; he ordered, and instead he slid his hand from my belly to
between my legs.� I let him---God, I
couldn't stop him from bringing to me to orgasm that way.� But he touched me so slowly, so softly and
delicately that it was sheer torture.�
And he knew that it was!� My only
hope for release was to beg him to fuck me harder.� Which I did gladly.

&nbsp;

As I quickly glanced back
at him one more time, I could see Master close his eyes, grab my hips again and
begin to fuck me with abandon, using every muscle he had as he literally threw
himself onto my pelvis and butt.� Every
thrust pushed me forward on the mattress.�
Without wanting to, my mouth hung open and my eyes closed in
anticipation.� Finally, my head snapped
up in abject realization; without any desire or need or cooperation on my part,
he'd forced me over an invisible threshold I'd never known existed inside
me.� It was almost like I stood to the
side and watched myself.� I knew it began
with my incoherent babbling and moaning, but it didn't matter.� I knew he was ripping my guts apart, but at
the same time it somehow all felt so deliciously right!� Intellectually, I hated what he was doing to
me and what he stood for.� But my body's
senses were overwhelmed.

&nbsp;

&quot;Yess, gawwwd, uhhh,
ohhh, uhhh, ohhh,&quot; I heard myself as I wiggled my ass and pushed back at
the rampaging bull that filled me again and again.

&nbsp;

I could barely hear him as
he said, &quot;Get ready, you little slut.�
Here it comes again, just for you.��
I was oh so ready, and again my head snapped up from my folded arms as I
rammed my butt back at him, thrusting, wagging, grinding; letting him know that
for the first time, I was begging for more, begging for as much as he had to
give. 

&nbsp;

He almost screamed as he
babbled, &quot;You little ass-slut, take my cock up your hot, beautiful ass,
take my whole load up your hot cunt whore's ass.�� I'm ashamed to say that this put me over the
edge too, and I pushed myself back to him and wiggled my ass even more as he
drove inside me ever deeper.� Then I
grabbed him and held on as it overwhelmed me; my first orgasm from anal sex was
totally unexpected and was one of the best I've ever had. 

&nbsp;

I gave out
muffled scream after scream as I came---wave after wave of sensation washing
over me.� Within seconds, I felt a jet
hot bursting sensation deep in my bowels as he exploded.� 

&nbsp;

&quot;Yeesssssss,
gaaawwwwddd,&quot; I shrieked as I felt his cock begin to pulse and deliver
another hot, wet, sticky load into my aching bowels.

&nbsp;

Finally, he had
won and I had lost---but just this one round.�
In any other place, with any other man, the female in me would have felt
that we had connected in the most intimate way.�
But not with this man.� To him,
for him, I knew it was physical relief at best.�
Master panted for breath as he looked down at me with steely eyes and a
slight smile.� I had been completely out
of control at the end, but with a sense of panic I wanted make him think I had
chosen to please him---that I had chosen to give myself to him completely.� I think....I hope he believed this because it
made him happy.� As a reward for
performing so well, he gently pushed me onto my belly and massaged my back and
shoulders.� After a moment, I started
crying.� He told me to stop, but I couldn't.� I wanted to
obey him, but I couldn't.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

He was a crude
and violent man, but he was also a man that very quickly knew me better than I
knew myself.�� As much as I hated to
admit it, I had begun to develop a taste for what he called �the rough
stuff.�� I'd fought him and his desires
as best I could, but how could I fight my own?

&nbsp;

It was the next
morning and I was still tender, but he had me on my hands and knees on my bed
again.� I wore wrist cuffs for this
performance, but Master seemed to feel that that was the only control he
needed.� He smiled, �Take it easy, Little
Slave, and just relax.�� I knew my eyes widened
as I looked at him over my shoulder.� He
just smiled in return.� I smiled weakly
at him and tried to relax, but I couldn't help myself; I gasped in anticipation
as I felt his finger began to gently move in and out of my still sore ass.� Even though I knew what was coming, my breath
escaped in a hiss when the icy cold ginger was pressed to my swollen anus and I
jerked away from it.� My Master patted my
ass softly with the palm of one hand and pressed the cold object to me
again.� I inhaled deeply as I felt the
long, thin, unbelievably cold root slide into my anus like a wet, naked finger.

&nbsp;

The lining of
my rectum was torn up from last night.�
The burning began quickly this time, almost immediately, and I couldn't
stop myself as I soon found myself bucking uncontrollably on the bed. �It was like a stick of fire had been shoved into
my rectum.� Oh God, it never changed,
never got better, never became easier; and because he enjoyed what it did to
me, I knew it would never stop.� My eyes
were watering and my anus throbbed and I wiggled my hips to dislodge it.� I half panicked and whimpered to myself; God, it always
felt like this before it got much, much worse.�


&nbsp;

There seemed to
be a terrible build-up of pressure inside me, then my pussy started to get wet,
sopping wet.� The fluid was thick and
clear at first, then white, almost as if I were ejaculating.� And it felt so incredibly pleasurable.� I couldn't help this reaction either.� For some reason, my anus and my pussy were
intimately and erotically connected; as soon
as a piece of ginger began burning me, I
was wet.� All I knew is that my Master
loved seeing this and I knew that he would be pleased---he was always pleased
when I was wet for him.� 

&nbsp;

Soon, I was
writhing and wriggling on my hands and knees uncontrollably, my screams mingled
with my moans.� I wanted to lay flat on
the bed and somehow obtain the pleasure I needed so badly at the moment, but
even in my pain, I knew I couldn't without his permission.� My ass was on fire and it felt like my rectum
and insides were burning up.� I just knew
that all of my internal organs had to be melting in the icy-cold fire.� My pussy was soaked and I was moaning now in
both pleasure and pain.� And he still
hadn't entered me.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

Rebecca was, I
thought to myself, so beautiful.�
Crouched on the bed, bound only by my will alone, with nothing else
holding her in that position.� She was
becoming more disciplined and trustworthy every day.� As I watched this beautiful woman writhe on
her hands and knees, I knew that the ginger brought out the beast in her.� She never accepted the inevitability of it,
hating at first what it did to her, fighting the sensations as if she could
somehow win---but in the end, she always 'came to Jesus.'� I know that I certainly liked what it did to
her.� I approached her again and sat
beside her on the bed, running my fingers through her hair.� Then I cupped her vagina, beginning to work her clit and pussy with my wet
fingers.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I faked as big
a smile as I could muster for him.� Then
suddenly I felt an overwhelming need to scream.�
It wasn�t the fact that he had filled me with the peeled root, but this
was the first time he massaged my clit, then finger-fucked me when his fingers
were still covered by the ginger's oils.�
It was like having everything that
made me a woman suddenly immersed in
hot wax.� There were all of the
sensations of taking the ginger anally, but very little of the pain.� And it wasn�t pain in the traditional
sense.� Rather, it made me hyper-sensitive to his every
touch, his slightest caress.� And it made
me instantly want to be filled even more. �Then he went back to my rearend and twisted the ginger around
inside me a number of times, a feeling that was intensely agonizing and mind-bendingly
pleasurable at the same time.

&nbsp;

Master's hand
felt so skilled as found its way between my thighs into my pussy. The ginger caused a huge amount of lubrication in my pussy and
when he touched me there, I felt absolutely drenched.� I finally understood that I needed to remain
absolutely still and feel the sensations before I could finally have an orgasm,
but the ginger always forced me to continually move in response to the
overwhelming burn.� This realization made
me understand that I was always working against my very desires, involuntarily
postponing my climax for far too long.�
And when I finally did cum, it was only that much stronger as everything
combined to push me over the edge into to an orgasmic sensorium in which I only
had to be touched and I came time after time, whether I wanted to or not.� 

&nbsp;

He slid two
fingers inside me and I could feel him hook them slightly in order to stroke my
G-spot.� My hips began to buck wantonly
and I knew that I was crying, telling him that it hurt and begging him at the
same time to not stop.� God, I hated how
weak I was.� He began to rub my clit and
my scream bounced off the walls as I came for his pleasure.� My pussy contracted hard around his fingers
as he stroked and curled them inside me; he wasn�t going to let me stop.� I came and I came as I covered his fingers
with thick, steaming pussy juice.� I
begged and whimpered and bucked as he forced me to ride wave after ever higher
wave of orgasm.� I knew that he loved to
hear me scream when I came, especially if it was against my will.� Finally, my anus began to pulse around the
ginger in rhythm with my pussy and I knew I screamed in passionate agony one
last time as my whole body rocked uncontrollably, driven to extremes I had
never before known.� I think I might have
passed out for a second.� Afterwards, I
lay on the bed and shuddered for almost five minutes.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I still panted,
but had mostly caught my breath.� He'd
settled behind me, his left hand on my hip and his right on my lower back.�� What he did with the ginger drove me crazy
every time, but this time it was different.�
Now that he'd allowed the ginger to take me, I was to �....push with my
ass muscles� to expel the ginger.� How
was I supposed to do that?� I'd had too
many orgasms to obey him.� I was
exhausted from everything he'd made me do earlier and the thing was huge.� I'd carved a deep moat in it, and I could
feel my sphincter as it spasmed around the root, maintaining its death
grip.� But I'd learned to obey Master
too, so despite my misgivings, I tried to do as I was told and pushed for
him---hard.� Oh God, it hurt!� I stopped and just panted for a second, my
face flushed and my thighs trembling.� My
rectum ached and throbbed, for the piece that had seemed so slender at first
was now too big, far too big for me to push out on my own.� This hurt much worse than when he had forced
the very first rubber plug inside me.� He
gently coaxed me to push again, and unbidden, a whimper of fear escaped
me.� 

&nbsp;

�C�mon,
slut-baby� try again,� I heard my Master's soft compelling voice from a
distance.� Obedience to this man was
being driven into my soul; without thinking, I took a deep breath to prepare
myself before I pushed again.� Burning
pain seared through my ass and my vagina quivered like a new-born foal.� The sweet nectar of love already coated my
labia and ran over my clit, and then onto my belly as I crouched on the bed for
my Master's pleasure.� He touched my clit
once again and began softly massaging me there.

&nbsp;

Through the
haze of pain and utter exhaustion, I suddenly realized I was cumming again and
that I couldn�t stop it.� I didn't want
to cum---but I didn't want to stop now either.�
I was physically exhausted, yet every part of me was reacting to the
ginger.� The more I pushed, the harder I
came and the faster he manipulated me.� I
didn't want it to feel so good, but it did despite the pain burning up my
ass.� I screamed in both pleasure and
pain as I was finally able to push the plug most of the way out of my body,
stretching me from top to bottom, from inside to out, tearing me in every way
even as my whole body shuddered in one last total orgasm.� Every muscle in my body felt like a wet
noodle and I tingled everywhere.� My anus
felt like it just been torn apart, and just when I thought I couldn�t take
anymore, he eased the last of it out of me.�
It was a wonderfully satisfying feeling as my anus was finally allowed
to tighten on itself again.� He patted me
on the ass as I collapsed on the bed and just lay there watching him get
off.� I was his pain-slut and it was
obvious he'd decided to let his girl rest a bit. 

&nbsp;

The pain eased
some when the ginger was gone, but as usual, it still felt as if something huge
filled me and I was burning inside for hours afterwards.� I wanted nothing more than to just lie on the
bed.� I was panting and I was
flushed.� My ears burned and I wanted to
cry.� How could it have come to this?� Where was the woman that was willing to fight
against any odds?� I felt so lost.� I felt so empty, so abandoned, so degraded.� I lay there face down on the bed.� My abused butt stuck up into the air and my
hands clenched into fists even as my wrists remained bound by his
handcuffs.� Just as my reactions to the
ginger were real, even as the luxurious feelings of total abandonment washed
over me and penetrated every bone in my body, so too were the feelings of total
degradation with which I was always left afterwards.� When I could think rationally, I was so
humiliated by my out-of-control reactions.�
And that was the worst part; I reacted the same way each time, writhing
in orgasm, begging to be fucked, needing to fucked, and yet hating myself
afterwards for giving in to my basest animal needs---and he knew exactly how
much I loved it and hated it.� 

&nbsp;

I wasn't a
whore, I didn't want to be used like a prostitute; like any normal woman, I
needed emotional comfort, the comfort of someone who cared for me.� It had become more and more difficult recently,
getting back into the ghost world where my husband saved me from this reality
made up equally of desire and disgust, but I needed to try.� He.........he wasn't there for me as much
now, yet these were the times that I needed him the most.� He was the only thing that gave me strength
to carry on.� If I ever saw him again, I
would never take him for granted.� God,
just give me one more chance with my husband.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I know now
it will never stop.� He came back again
one last time last night and tore me like paper.� At the end, he grabbed my throat and
squeezed, squeezed so hard I couldn�t make a sound.� He opened me like a flower of pain, and
suddenly it felt good.� I didn't want it
to, but it felt so GOOD! 

&nbsp;

I was lying
in bed when he came in.� I sensed Master's presence as he leaned over me and pulled my hair back
to whisper into my ear. �I�m not done with you yet, my Little Slave.�� Then I felt his finger probing my anus.� Oh, God�.not again.� Please God, not my ass.� I thought
he'd smile or something, but there was nothing playful on his face.� I looked at his face, then etched my gaze
along the curves of his lips and the lines of his jaw, down the stretch of his
neck to his collarbone.� He slowly lay
next to me, and suddenly we were chest to chest.� I could feel him breathe.� I wanted to freeze, to deny him his
victory.� But I couldn't.� 

&nbsp;

I knew what
he wanted, what he expected from me.�
Reluctantly, I slipped a hand to his waist, curled a finger under his
underwear and ran it back and forth.� I
leaned in and deliberately kissed him, barely a tilt of his chin so that our
noses almost met.� Playing along with the
lines he'd assigned me, I bit his lower lip, gently and tugged on it, then
tongued his mouth wider, delved in like it would save me from every bad thing
in the world.� I trailed a long kiss
along his cheek, his jaw, down his throat when he tilted his head back.� And I felt his hand in my hair.� He wanted to train me, but I was determined
to be less than he wanted, but more than he could handle.� I knew what he wanted and was going to give
him more than that.� I would train him
too by being this way.� But in the end,
if I had my way, it was going to be worship.�


&nbsp;

He pushed me
onto my belly.� I glanced over my
shoulder at him.� He straddled my hips
and I raised myself up on my elbows because I couldn't breathe.� His fingers ran up my back and then down.� He raised himself up off of me a little,
�Lift your hips.�� 

&nbsp;

I tried to
roll over, but he wouldn't let me.� �Lift
your hips,� he said.� �Please.�

&nbsp;

He said,
please.� So I did.� I wasn't used to this kind of sensitivity
from him, and I guess it was this that made me obey him so quickly.� I thought he would touch me at first like
before, but he put the lubricant inside me right away.� It was cold, and I squirmed at first, but he
put his hand against the small of my back, mostly to hold me still.� He was tender at first, entering in increments
for once, all of him and all of me, until all of me was wet and red and
completely surrounding him.� For the
first time, I can honestly say it didn't feel so bad.� But still I wanted it over, completed,
done.� I became impatient and began to
move more forcefully, trying to entice him into giving me what he knew he
wanted me to have.� We fought a silent
battle for several minutes before he finally lost control and I won.� Even though he controlled me in every way,
that night for the first time, I had anal sex and it didn't feel quite so
bad.� In a way, I felt like I had been the
dominant one tonight.� Was I this
easy?� Was this all it took?� Let me have the feeling of a little control
and I would accept anything as pleasurable?

&nbsp;

I hate the
fact that even now I can�t help but want to smile as I think of what we did
that night.� He sank into me and set me
on fire, making me burn from the inside out.�
No one who has not experienced this can imagine how it feels to burn on
the inside like that only from what a man does to you.� The last couple of minutes, I got so hot
inside that it almost seemed I could feel the flames all over my body, burning
me to a crisp.� I knew he'd listened to
my body sing under him several times now, but still I did my best to pretend
that nothing he did had any affect on me.�
Still I refused to give in.� I couldn�t
let him know what I was beginning to feel.�
An odd air of contented resignation mixed with
an appreciation of the enormity of what had just happened hung over me
now.� Somehow in the ongoing war to keep
myself alive and my world in some sort of order, I'd managed to make a separate
peace between the two.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

�What are
you thinking about?�� I jumped.� I was sitting on the edge of my bed and
Master had come upon me unannounced; standing a few feet away holding a cup of
coffee.� He was dressed in jeans and a
T-shirt, his face was clear and guileless.�
His was the face of a poet's, fine-boned and full-lipped, with just
enough softness about the jaw to imply a vulnerability that in truth never
existed.� But in contrast, his eyes were
that of the predator's, cold and calculating, windows to a mind that saw life
as a game board and all others as pawns, to be played, or sacrificed, as the
situation demanded.

&nbsp;

He was
staring at my exposed legs and arms, a look on his face as if they reminded him
of something.� Instinctively, I folded my
arms around my knees and bent forward a little, hunching over the first book
he�d allowed me; I�d been reading.

&nbsp;

�Well?�� He said.

&nbsp;

�Well what,
Sir?�

&nbsp;

�What were
you thinking about?�

&nbsp;

�I
wasn�t.� I wasn�t thinking about�.about
nothing.� Master.�

&nbsp;

He raised
his eyebrows.

&nbsp;

�Nothing,� I
repeated.

&nbsp;

�Yes.� I heard.��
He finished his coffee, up-ending the cup so that the last drops fell
out at my feet.� He looked at me sideways
and said, �Tell me, woman.� Why do I keep
staring at you?�

&nbsp;

I dropped my
eyes and fiddled with the book cover, pretending he had not spoken.

&nbsp;

�I said, why
do I want to look at you?� Why do I keep
looking at you and thinking that you�re still hiding something I�d find very
interesting?�

&nbsp;

All of a
sudden my skin felt very cold.� I blinked
at him.� �I�m sorry, Master,� I said in
voice that sounded small and distant.�
�What did you say?�

&nbsp;

�You�re
still hiding something.�� He raised his
arms and turned his palms to the ceiling for a second, then dropped them by his
side.� 

&nbsp;

�It�s
easy.� I just look at you and I can see
it.� I don�t know what it is exactly, but
I�ve got the---the instinct it�s something that I�m going to like.� See, I�m a visionary�.,� he raised two
fingers and lightly tapped his forehead, ��when it comes to women, women like
you.� I can feel it in the air.�

&nbsp;

�You�re
wrong, Master.� I wrapped my hands around my stomach.� �I�m not hiding anything.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, you
are.� Even if from yourself.

&nbsp;

�I�m not.�

&nbsp;

He looked
amused.� For a moment, I thought he was
going to laugh.� Instead, he sighed.� He got to his feet and stretched slowly,
giving me a glimpse of his flat abdomen.�
�No,� he said, squinting at me thoughtfully.� �No.��
He dropped his hands and turned away from me.� �Of course you�re not.�

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I slept on
my bed at night now and Master allowed me even more of my basic freedom during
the day.� I was still chained to the
ceiling runs during the day while he was gone, but it felt so good being able
to get up and walk around when I wanted.�
But then I began to experience what seemed an overwhelming sense of
despair.� Clearly, Stage four was
Depression.� Even now as he began to give
me more freedom, for a few days during the last part of the third week and into
the fourth week, I just sat and stared at the walls.� I knew that something was
going on in my subconscious.� Some kind
of redecoration, refurbishment or re-upholstering that required a lot of system
downtime---some shadowy application running in the background, performing
unknown operations, consuming huge chunks of psychic RAM.� I hadn�t the
energy or the desire to fight him and at times would have perhaps slit my
wrists if the means were available.�
Other times I was irritable beyond belief; these few fits of pique
earned me several good beatings.� I was
normally an even-tempered person and I hated the deep dark moods that engulfed
me now.� Thankfully this period did not
last too long.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

Rebecca lay on
the bed next to me and now I was fully hard.�
On her back with her knees spread and massaging her pierced nipples,
Rebecca hadn't wanted to do this at first, but finally she had begun to learn
the value of obedience.� I held the root
firmly in its new home and vigorously ass-fucked my little pain lover with it.� I think she has learned to like this---the
sounds of pain and pleasure she gave me blended and rose to a single crescendo of what appeared to be incredible sexual
delight.� The smell from Rebecca's pussy was strong and thick; the
aroma alone was a major turn-on.�� Almost
orgasmic, it smelled like sex and ginger and wanton sexual acts; it made a man
think of primitive beasts, hot blood and tribal needs.� 

&nbsp;

I rolled onto
her sweaty belly and with one move, slid effortlessly up to my nutsack in her
hot crack.� She screamed once as she
clamped on to me and wouldn't let go.� I
continued to pound her honey-filled pussy, concentrating on that exclusively,
for her ass had now accepted my slender burning gift and I no longer needed to
hold it in.� I kept pounding her and soon
I felt my groin stir.� Her pussy
convulsed and gripped my cock like a vise made of muscle and meat.� I loved that feeling

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

My Master had
shoved the ginger in, then climbed on top of me.� I think he was fucking me now, but the longer
the ginger was inside me, the more I was reduced to pure screaming.� Not the fake �ooh baby fuck me� screaming of
an experienced whore, and not animalistic growling.� Pretty much just screaming.� I didn�t know at this point if I wanted him
to stop or to continue.� I know he was
fucking me for part of it, but I had the impression he was sort of sitting back
and watching what was happening for part of it too. 

&nbsp;

He fucked me
and I gave him everything he wanted.� God
help me, I gave him everything.� My
vagina was slick with juice as was usual, and his cock easily filled my pussy
as I contracted and let go, contracted and let go without conscious
control.� He shoved hard, ramming fully
inside me and taking up any remaining unfilled space.� Each move of his hips ground the ginger plug
into the tender lining of my rectum even more.�
In only a few thrusts, he�d pushed me to an ever more intense,
ever-higher orgasmic level.� And then I
lost all track of my body and of time.�
My world consisted only of my vagina, my burning anus, and Master's
thrusting cock.� The burn of the root
helped me accept him like this.� More
than accept him.� God, I was learning to
enjoy how it felt to be filled by him.� 

&nbsp;

I was alarmed
at how easily my mind seemed to accept some of what he wanted to teach me.� Right now, it seemed I could have stayed
forever in that timeless place where only sensations counted.� My Master was like a machine made of muscle
and steel.� He drove and he drove, the
thrusts deeper and deeper, never seeming to end.� And when he did cum, we were both completely
exhausted.� But even as I felt his
scalding hot cum jet inside me and he gave a groan of total satisfaction like
someone who is totally spent, I knew that I still was not finished.� 

&nbsp;

Even more, I
knew exactly what came next.� I�d carved
the thing and I knew how thick and ripe it was.�
Even after soaking in cold water for hours, it was fresh and I knew its
spicy oils had been waiting to burst free as soon as they had found a suitable
receptacle.� Oily diffusion had invaded
my osmotic reality for the next eight or ten hours.� It had no other choice but this. �The burn of the
ginger overloaded the senses.

&nbsp;

But the most
important thing I had found were the emotional changes I felt during and in the
aftermath of the anal burn: a feeling of well-being and exquisite horniness
totally fulfilled, a sense of dreaminess and overall warmth.� And worst in some ways, I often felt just a
general happiness and genuine appreciation for what my Master had done for
me---not to me, but FOR me.� At the point
that these feelings flooded my senses, I was always ready for his love and I
just couldn't help myself.� 

&nbsp;

I've thought
about this a lot since that first night; I think there were two things about
ginger figging that always put me over the top.�
The first was a sort of delay of gratification.� As the pain from the ginger claimed me, I was
always forced to put off my orgasm because of the evil burn, which meant that
the ending had always been building up when compared to what I might have normally
experienced.� 

&nbsp;

The second was
this mood thing.� These warm, tingly
sensations and the release of tension in my rectum and ass muscles after the
initial onslaught of pain.� And as a
result, every time he fucked me during a figging, I experienced a huge and warm
and tingly orgasm unlike any other; something that always burst over me, taking
away my breath and all conscious control of my body.� And I always....I always felt this overwhelming sense of gratitude for being allowed to
experience this with him.� 

&nbsp;

This last thing
was what I always hated most about the ginger.�


&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I have used ginger on a lot of women, but Rebecca was the most
appreciative.� Certainly, her reactions
were the most spectacular.� I have found
that figging hot females with unconscious Sub
characteristics that tend towards a need for total domination are the ones that
appreciate it the most.� I can�t say I�ve
ever met a woman who�s begged me to fig her, reluctant or consensual or
otherwise; but after I�ve given it to them, there�s never been a time that the
bitch wasn�t totally overwhelmed.� Even
the ones that I've taken off the street against their will have a shocked look
on their faces afterwards.� And for some?� They were sooo appreciative; toe-licking,
cock-sucking, eating out of my hand grateful.�
Someday, I knew I would be able use this trait of Rebecca�s against her.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

It was
almost four weeks into my captivity and my period was several weeks late.� Normally I was very regular and lucky in that
the onset was always quite mild.� I had
earlier begged him for my birth control pills, but for some male reason he
refused.� Fine, I thought to myself
passively, rather than rebelliously.� I
told him I was pregnant today again and the look on his face told me that this
man definitely did not want a pregnant female around.� Good.�
He would see my belly grow and would have to let me go then.� The things he did to me were becoming
intolerable; they had become too enticing, arousing too many emotions in
me.� I had to be free of him, had to be
myself again, not what this man wanted me to be.� I would have no problem getting an abortion
once I was free.� I was hugging myself in
reassurance as I fell into a deep, serene sleep that night.� This would be my escape and I felt a warm
wave of happiness; I was comforted by the thought of freedom.� I remember falling asleep feeling satisfied
with my plans for the future.

&nbsp;

Dark,
suffocating dreams woke me in the middle of the night, struggling for
breath.� I dug my nails into my
hand.� I could feel the fear in my belly,
twisting and pinching; it had been growing, getting continually worse for the
last two days.� I could still hear the
people in my dream, screaming at me, screaming without words, like
animals.� It took all my strength not to
weep.� I had been too emotional, weeping
too much lately.� I knew it was out of
place and out of character, but I could not seem to help myself; the tears
would come, sometimes over a trifle and nothing I did could hold them
back.� I finally fell asleep once more.

&nbsp;

I dreamed of
the riot again.� The mob surged around
me, shrieking, a maddened beast.� Women
swarmed over me like weasels, pinching my legs and kicking me in the
belly.� Then I saw the bright glimmer of
steel.� The knife plunged into my belly
and tore and tore and tore, until there was nothing left of me down there but
shiny wet ribbons.

&nbsp;

When I
awoke, pale early morning light slanted through the glass bricks of the White
Room, yet I felt sore and achy as if I had not slept all night.� There was something sticky on my thighs.� When I threw back the thin blanket with my
unchained hand and saw the blood, I first thought my dream had come true.� I squirmed off of the bed, kicking at the
blanket and falling on the floor, breathing raggedly, naked, bloodied, and afraid.

&nbsp;

But as I
crouched there on my knees, understanding came.�
�No, please,� I whimpered, �please, no, not now.�� Pulling myself up by the bedpost, I wanted to
go into my bathroom and wash myself between my legs, scrubbing away all of the
stickiness.� Unless I cleaned it, when he
saw it, he would know.� Then I remembered the bedding.� I stared in horror at the dark red stain and
the tale it told.� It was as if my own
body had betrayed me to Master, unfurling for all the world to see the banner
of a woman freshened and ready to be impregnated.� I didn�t know if I had been pregnant and
spontaneously aborted or had aborted finally because of his earlier beating or
my period had just been late because of the stress I was under.� All I knew was that I had no chance for
freedom now.� I fell to my knees and
sobbed into the bloodied mattress, and that is where he found me an hour later.

&nbsp;

I think this
scared him.� The only change as a result
of my midnight experience was that he was more understanding and now quickly
delivered tampons and clean bedding.�
Later, birth control pills to help regulate my period mysteriously
appeared with my makeup.� I think this
female reality had frightened him.

&nbsp;

INTERLUDE

&nbsp;

Transference is a universal phenomenon
of the human mind in which the unconscious feelings for one person are
redirected towards another.� The
interesting thing is that the person reacting in transference is generally
unaware of the emotional distortion.� 

&nbsp;

The man who would be Rebecca�s master had spent a lot of time
ferreting out her history.� He was a good
detective and one of the best interrogators that Delta had ever employed; he
well knew the importance of past life details.�
And although he had somehow failed to put some of the most important
facts together correctly, this omission didn't work against his attempt to
re-make this woman.� Just the opposite.

&nbsp;

Rebecca�s father was an aloof man, typical of his generation
raised in a rural setting.� Her mother
was an extremely religious woman who always did better with her son than with
her daughters.� Understandably, from
Rebecca�s earliest memories, she'd loved her father best of all.� But much of her behavior disappointed him,
and raised to keep his emotions bottled inside (for that was what men of his
type did), he was incapable of openly returning the love and simple affection a
shy young daughter so urgently sought.�
Much more so than her siblings, she spent her early years desperately
trying to earn his respect and love.� But
there was no success in this, no matter what she did and no matter how hard she
tried.� 

&nbsp;

And finally, inevitably, Rebecca saw this as a comment upon
herself; frustrated and having no idea why or of what she had done to earn his
studied emotional neutrality, she intuitively knew that it was her fault, not
his.� It must mean that she was somehow
unworthy of his love.� So, in addition to
missing much of what a warm, affectionate mother could give her daughter,
Rebecca approached womanhood with a devastating sense of her own worthlessness,
carrying a huge burden of unearned guilt on her back from her unrealized
relationship with her father.� Terrified
of never feeling a father's love and in the end, once she knew he would never
give her this love, even though still craving his approval, Rebecca now turned
to the willful acts of a teenage daughter trying to hurt the ones she loved.

&nbsp;

Rebecca was a complex woman further complicated by the injuries
life had later dealt her.� Without doubt,
the woman Christian now held was slowly but surely responding to his
techniques.� But regardless of how
successful Christian had been in manipulating people in the past; regardless of
where Rebecca was right now psychologically, what he did not understand was
that nature had now taken a further hand in the process.� The effects of �Father Transference� would significantly increase his chances of
success with this woman, and the reasons were simple. 

&nbsp;

Unknown to Christian, the key to his final success in unraveling
Rebecca's beliefs and modifying her behavior would be his ability to force her
to endure the tension of opposite emotions that she now felt for her
father/Christian.� Not even thirty, she
still deeply felt the need for a father�s love and acceptance.� There is a tendency for people who were
abused as children to re-create the circumstances of that abuse in other
situations.� And even though she'd never
been abused by her father in the general sense of the word, she still did not
have a healthy emotional relationship with him---abuse can come in many forms
because of the vast difference in power between the parent and the child.� 

&nbsp;

So instead of assessing and accepting the memory of her father in
a healthy way, Rebecca had in certain ways fallen into the meandering memory of
her past.� Due to the stress of captivity
and forced slavery and in a totally non-conscious way, she began to overlay
some of the damaged parts of her psyche upon Christian.� Despite, or perhaps because of his behavior,
she could not help but soon begin to feel that perhaps in him she could begin
to get the things she could not get from her father; love, support, confidence
and acceptance.� All she had to do was
earn them, prove herself worthy of his affection.� In this, he was a distorted image of Rebecca�s
father.� But now, instead of being bad or
worthless or even harmful, transference would be a vital tool for her
survival.� Without this, she might not
have been able to endure Christian's demands.

&nbsp;

In the man that now held her captive, Rebecca subconsciously began
to see many of the same characteristics that she thought existed in her
father.� Many were admirable and some
were not, but in her mind both men were remarkably similar in so many
ways.� Master Christian had treated her
brutally in the beginning of her captivity, and in some ways it seemed that the
early physical maltreatment at his hands had paralleled the psychological
neglect of her father.� 

&nbsp;

While her father had been unemotional, he had also been
scrupulously fair.� And like her father,
the initial brutality that her new Master forced her to accept had waned quickly
as she learned the parameters of her new life and began to accept her new life
for what it was---he treated her in a way that she saw subconsciously as �fairly.�� While Rebecca would rather be anywhere else
than here, as she processed the fact that she was a prisoner, she was also
forced to admit that she saw method in his behavior; he was still a monster,
but not an unthinking or uncaring monster.

&nbsp;

And so, with the decrease in undeserved and to her, unearned
cruelty, Rebecca saw in her Master with a plastic clarity in her subconscious
mind the return, the reincarnation of
the idealized figure out of her childhood, and without conscious effort began
an intuitive transfer to her Master of the long buried positive feelings and
reactions which had previously been centered on her father.� 

&nbsp;

That she was subliminally experiencing this transference would be
of critical importance in helping Christian accomplish his goals.� For without thought and without struggle,
Rebecca now began to experience as yet unrecognized compulsions towards the man
that so reminded her of her father.� She
still feared this man and what he could do to her, but the situation had begun
to gain momentum.� She began to feel a
need to earn his approval and developed a concern about his feelings towards
her, both of which were coupled with a curiosity about his personal life.� Finally, she began to understand that he was
an authority on facets of life she had never experienced.� In ways she could not begin to even
understand, she began to idealize him.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

He entered the
room and I awoke with a start from a troubling dream, the details of which were
already in the process of fleeing my conscious mind.� The dream was gone, but quick vistas of
memory from last night that I wished had been a dream flashed through my mind;
the spanking and horizontal wood between my thighs, the leather and the cold
metal.� It was the beginning of the
weekend, and he had plenty of time to spend with me.� 

&nbsp;

Last night had
begun with me draped over the foot of the bed, body open and defenseless
against the whipping he was convinced we both knew I deserved.� I grimaced with each blow that he kept widely
spaced in time, doing my best to keep all sound inside.� I obeyed the normal rules; the more sound I
made, the more I prolonged his discipline.�


&nbsp;

When he
finished with the hard, leather belt I had come to know so well and the brutal
spanking I knew he seemed to enjoy giving all his captive women, he ordered me
to ride his horse.� Breasts unbound and
hands free for the first time, through sheer will power alone, I somehow
managed to force myself to please him again.�
My face raised to the night sky and eyes closed, my mouth open and
unfilled with the normally ever-present pear-shaped gag made out of hard black
rubber, I found myself screaming my agony to the ceiling.

&nbsp;

He had allowed
me to go to my bed afterwards and after a half hour of moving restlessly until
I could find a position in which I was comfortable, I'd finally asleep.� It was early morning now, still dark outside.� Startled and totally awake, right wrist bound
to the headboard, I looked around and saw Master standing by the side of my
bed.� One of those men that seemed to be
able to carry on a conversation and still maintain an erection, he was smiling
as he said, �Good morning.� We have some
unfinished business.�� 

&nbsp;

I was
exhausted.� I ached between my legs.� I didn't want a man.� But I was already spread wide for him as I'd
been taught none-the-less.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I perched
naked on the edge of my bed in the afternoon, took a bite of roll.� A gulp of water.� He was nothing if not consistent.� I still ached between my legs, but wasn't
thinking of that right now.� Food was
something that Master still used as an incentive, cutting back on an already
light meal when I didn�t perform exactly as he wished.� I had fought him earlier with small
passive/aggressive acts and he�d forced me to eat this way too many times.� Mechanical, tasteless refueling, small
amounts choked down just after being forced to do something else that I
hated.� I drank too much water, but I
took another sip just to feel more full.�
What I�d consumed so far sloshed in my stomach like an internal sea,
whitecaps, undertow, and all.

&nbsp;

Last night
and like the thirty nights before, I'd slept with my collar, but for the first
time in weeks, I did not dream of it.� I
dreamt of my life instead, of the sequence of events that had both preceded and
had followed my being kept here, and how they had been joined together like beads
in a crazy necklace.� Now there was nothing
more left, nothing left to gain or lose.�
Within the necklace was a void, and I was in the middle of it.� For some time, my husband had floated within
its boundaries.� But he was mostly gone
now and more recently it had been Master Christian that completed the
circle.� I sometimes wondered if I wasn't just his idea, in some
complicated metaphysical way.� His world
seemed somehow more substantial than mine was now.� But it was
so quiet now, this beaded sphere of silence.�
With my eyes closed, I traveled its perimeter and found it sound and
sealed.� No doors had been left opened,
no beads left unstrung.

&nbsp;

But I knew
that isolation like this was not the answer.�
At the same time, to step out of it required more than I had, more than
the strength that remained.� I was
afraid.� It was evening, but it was not
possible to sleep now.� I lay there
imagining a future that had almost come into being.� Someone�s voice was inside of me, pushing me
like a horse to gallop.� Rise, always rise.� Strength is your shield.� Was it my father?� I didn't know anymore.

&nbsp;

No, I shook
my head to an empty room.� I was afraid,
afraid of what was inside me.� The next
step Master would demand of me required courage I did not feel.� Every moment was tense with
hushed anticipation; foreordained with meaning.�
But already in the imagining there was more
than there had been.� And as I waited for
the daylight to press against the glass tiles, I reminded myself that I was not
the first woman to be alone in a situation like this.� It wasn�t the end.� No matter what I did.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Chapter 25; �No victim becomes a
reality without sacrifice.� Deny
yourself.� It is so beautiful to be a
victim; Josemaria Escriva.

&nbsp;

It was now five weeks into her captivity.� Two severe beating, more than twice that
number of brutal spankings, several maintenance spankings, multiple rapes and
forced anal sex in which the victim had slowly had become more and more
cooperative, all was compounded with isolation and little food, sleep
deprivation and a lot of discipline.�
Everything was combined in a controlled life-style in union with the
re-awakening of a naturally decadent sexual drive, it all resulted in a female
slave with immense potential.� A female
of which most men could only dream.� 

&nbsp;

I didn�t particularly want a partner right now, but rather a woman
to dominate and break to my will.� I
wanted to enjoy dominating her, enjoy making her change her beliefs and desires
at my every whim.� I wanted to enjoy her
body, and finally, in Rebecca�s case, I wanted to enjoy the fruits of a
recently aroused sexual appetite that was potentially ferocious in its
extremes.� But most, I wanted her to know
that it was me that forced her to acknowledge what she really was inside.� But now, it was time to force her to accept
another level of degradation and sexual humiliation; to remove once and for all
her belief in the sanctity of self and choice and personal freedom through
shame, disgrace and misery.� 

&nbsp;

It took a few days in town to set everything up, but finally
everything was ready.� It was evening and
although I couldn�t do much to hide her remarkable eyes, I made her die her
blond-white hair a light brown.�
Everything ready, I took my woman for her first trip into a nearby small
town.� Thrilled to be allowed out, she
was almost giddy in her excitement.� Yet
at the same time, she was suspicious because of what I made her wear; her
little black dress from over a month ago.�
The one that was tight around the top and waist, but which then flowed
out softly from her hips and ended at mid-thigh.� The nose ring was gone and in its place a
metal retainer now filled the hole in her septum.� Rebecca�s breast rings were connected by a
strong, yet decorative golden chain which had a ring in the middle and was just
the right length to pull the tips of her breasts slightly together. 

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

On the thirty-fifth morning
of my captivity, I woke up early feeling a little bizarre for some reason.� When he walked in to supervise the first part
of my day, he said he was taking me
out tonight for the first time since....since the beginning.� For some reason, I was scared.....scared and
looking forward to it at the same time in a sick to my stomach sort of way. I
wanted to please him tonight.� To let him
know that he wasn't making a mistake, I spent more time than normal getting
ready even though this made him impatient.�
I'd dyed my hair as he'd earlier demanded, then wore it long without
putting a lot of effort into it.� 

&nbsp;

I started
getting ready early that afternoon.�
After my shower, I put on light makeup, then finished with my
lipstick.� I was nervous and I especially
wanted to look good tonight; I was pretty sure that keeping my lipstick on
would be tough.�� It had taken me awhile,
but I had finally learned how to keep my lipstick unspoiled when pleasuring either
boy or man.� 

&nbsp;

I'd known a
couple of drag queens in the past and found that they knew more about all-night
makeup techniques than ten Hollywood makeup artists put together.� Everything I knew about lip makeup, I'd
learned from them.� At the beginning, I
always brushed my lips a little, then I put on the lipstick I wanted.� Next, I painted on a light coat of something
called Lip Set and then let it dry.�
Luckily, I'd had some in my overnight night bag and he'd let me have
it.� You had to have your lipstick just
the way you wanted it, then you put the Lip Set on and you kept your lips open
in an �O� shape until they dried.�
Sometimes your lips would tingle for a minute, but that was all.� It gave me a faultless lipstick that lasted
through anything for between four and six hours, and I hoped he appreciated my
efforts.

&nbsp;

When I
finished, Master handed me a garter belt, stockings and the little black dress
I'd already worn once before.� I hated
the idea of wearing the same dress for him again, but had no choice.� I slowly slipped the garter belt around my
waist, then sat down on the edge of the bed to put on the stockings.� I'd begged Master a couple of times for
panties, but he was adamant in his refusal.�
He began to look impatient, so I had to finish getting ready.� Next, I slipped the dress over my head and
settled it over my hips.� I had to adjust
myself a little to get the dress to hang correctly over my breasts because of
the nipple chain I now wore almost all of the time now.� Then I put on the formal collar I would wear
tonight.� Finally, I sat down on the edge
of the bed and put on the almost unworkable heels that he'd decided I
needed.� From the bed, I walked over to
the mirror and checked myself out.� I was
missing only one thing; I now put on a pair of inexpensive, yet expensive
looking dangling faux-diamond earrings.� 

&nbsp;

When I told
Master that I was ready, he walked towards me with a slight smile on his face
and pulled open the front of my dress to bare my breasts.� What he made me wear next was absolute
torture.

&nbsp;

*** 

&nbsp;

After I finished, the sexiest thing she had on was mostly hidden
from sight; a thin, twisted gold wire with sliding loops at each end and a
small locket in the center that camouflaged a tightening slide.� A sliver of ice made her left nipple stand
erect and the loop on one end of the gold line easily slid over the huge
nipple.� I pulled on the loop hard to
capture her nipple tightly and ensure that it would remain my prisoner until I
freed it.� Rebecca cried out in pain, but
just for a second.� She looked at me for
a second with unspilt tears in her eyes and then assumed a submissive position
again.� I now imprisoned her other nipple
the same way, and again came the same soft, involuntary cry of pain.� Once I'd tightened it in the center, the
length perfectly ensured that it always taut, but not too tight; thus ensuring
a painful pressure on both of Rebecca�s nipples, but without causing more
damage.� Finally, I connected a thin,
finely worked leash made out of Spanish leather to the center ring of her
golden breast chain and left it hanging over her left shoulder like a piece of
exotic jewelry.� 

She looked absolutely gorgeous, sexy as hell, and I simply
couldn't take my eyes off of her.� She
looked at me and asked in a worried tone, �What's wrong, Master?� Did I do something wrong?�

&nbsp;

I just shook my head no in response; my voice had dried up a
little.� 

&nbsp;

Then she asked in a low, soft voice, �Do I look pretty enough for
you, Master?�

&nbsp;

I cleared my throat and replied, �You'll do.� You look okay for now.�

&nbsp;

This clearly wasn't what she wanted to hear, but it was all she
was going to get from me.� Rebecca
handled the chain that connected her nipple rings pretty well, but she clearly
hated the nipple wire from the beginning.�
Tough.� She grimaced in pain as
she smoothed the front of her dress over her breast decorations.� Her dress was daringly scooped in front and
her slave collar tonight was more decorative than real, consisting of an
inch-wide black velvet choker.� Garter
belt and sheer black stockings; pumps with four-inch stiletto heels.� And of course, no need for panties.� 

&nbsp;

The mind is an amazing instrument in both the way it allows man to
make amazing intuitive leaps, as well as to hide the obvious from
ourselves.�� She was a woman that had
always pretty much dressed conservatively.�
Going out now with the short dress and stockings was bad enough.� But without panties, it was intolerable.� �Please, Master,� she begged, �please let me
wear panties.� The dress is too
short.� Please.�

&nbsp;

When I asked her why she wanted a pair of panties so badly, she
replied that �Only slutty women went out without wearing panties.�� I couldn�t help it.� I stared at her for about thirty seconds
before I finally cracked up.� �What on
earth do you think you are? �You�ve been
a slut from the beginning and you�re only now figuring it out?� God, for a supposedly educated woman, you�re
stupid as hell sometimes.�

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

It was a small town electronics store, not what Rebecca had
expected for her first trip out and she looked about uneasily as I led her
in.� I watched her closely and kept a
hand on her forearm as I escorted her from the car and through the doors.� Although the sign said Closed at Ten,
there were still numerous shoppers inside moving around at fifteen after
ten.� Once inside, she walked behind and
to my right, so there was no need at the moment to use the breast leash that
was draped over her shoulder.� Her high heels made a slow, seductive cadence that drew men's
attention to her entrance.� Every shopper present was
young and male, almost all rather geeky looking.� Each in his own world, we (actually she) were
rewarded with a total lack of attention except for a few stares from the corner
of the eyes.� Without preamble, I led her
to the restrooms in the far left corner.�
When we arrived, I pushed her into the Men�s bathroom.� My sweet little piece of fuck meat didn�t
resist me at first, walking along without requiring much too much
assistance.� Only at the door to the
bathroom did she hesitate and I encouraged her inside with a shove in her
back.� 

&nbsp;

Once inside, I pushed her up against the wall and pinned her
wrists above her head.� I leaned in and
it was easy to kiss her this way.� She
was uncertain and didn't seem to know how to react.� She gave me little resistance when I let go
and held her hand as I dragged her towards the row of sinks in front of the
mirror.� I listened to the echoing
click-clack of her high heels as she moved reluctantly behind me and thought
that when he was with a beautiful woman, nothing ever filled a man with more
anticipation than that sound.� I put the
bag containing the video camera off to the side where it could record us and
catch our reflections from the mirror at the same time, then I turned it on and
returned to my woman.� After I removed
Rebecca�s breast leash, I pushed her against the counter sink and pinned her
thighs as I leaned against her back.� I
moved the hair away from her left ear and kissed her.� Then I whispered, �Put your leg up on the
counter.�

&nbsp;

Shaking her head almost as if in shock, it was clear that she
didn�t understand what was happening to her or what I really wanted from
her.� Finally, she leaned back and put
her weight on one heel and raised her foot.�
This only emphasized the attractive shape of her calf.� I repeated my command more loudly, �Put your
left foot up on the counter.�� Finally,
awkwardly, she obeyed, slowly putting the back of her left high heel on the
counter.� The counter in that tatty men's
room was high enough that she teetered awkwardly on her right foot.� I pushed on her knee, straightened her leg on
the counter and moved her left foot into the closest sink.� Then I used my weight as I leaned against her
back and pinned her right thigh even harder against the edge of the
counter.� I put my hand on her hips and
rotated them to make sure that her pelvis was parallel to the counter---I
wanted her ass hanging all the way out and not half-on and half-off.� 

&nbsp;

She moved like a mannequin now, brain shutting down under too many
conflicting signals, but totally obedient to my every wish.� Slowly, I began to stroke her stocking clad
leg, the palm of my left hand sliding on the nylon-slick top of the gorgeous
thigh that stuck out awkwardly to the side, my fingers trailing down onto the
inside of her thigh.� My other hand was
fixed at the back of her neck with a handful of hair.� Then I ran my right hand down until it could
slide up the side of her satiny right thigh.�
Both hands stroked firm nylon-covered thigh at the same time.� I finally moved my right hand back up to her
hair and immobilized her again.

&nbsp;

I looked at Rebecca in the mirror and could almost smell the fear
I saw in her eyes.� I made her maintain
this pose for a few seconds, then leaned forward to smell her hair.� I looked at her beautiful profile and she
maintained an unnatural stillness as I kept her pinned.� Finally, I spoke, �Lean forward on your
hands.� Lean towards the mirror.�� Rebecca's eyes never left mine in the mirror
and she said nothing.� Slowly she did as
I ordered and then held that position because she knew that was what I
wanted.� It was a graceless and
defenseless position I'd ordered her maintain while I assaulted her.� Standing on one leg, with her other leg stuck
out to the side and raised like a stupid water bird.� It was a shameful and degrading stance, one
that left her no dignity whatsoever.� But
that was the plan tonight, debasing and humiliating my helpless, defenseless
slave-cunt.

&nbsp;

Even as she was leaning forward on her hands, I pulled her head
back again with a handful of her hair and I could see in the mirror that she
now had her eyes closed and her jaw clenched.�
I tilted her head toward her right shoulder.� Not enjoying this, sweet cheeks? I
thought to myself; I�m just getting started.

&nbsp;

I reached around with both hands and freed her beautiful breasts
from the confinement of the dress.� Both
soft globes were captured by the chain that connected the breast rings.� But even more, the savage nipple wire that
I'd made her don earlier now held two huge red, engorged nubbins of flesh.� Just looking at her strawberry-like nipples
made me wince; at least for a second anyway.�
I stroked her breasts for a second.�
Overwhelmed for a second by an unaccustomed feeling of pity for the
woman I was using, I avoided the thin line of wire that so cruelly captured her
soft flesh.

&nbsp;

I leaned in against her back and after I�d used her hair to pull
her head to the side again, I bit down on the left side of her neck, taking a
good amount of skin between my teeth.�
Although not really biting hard yet, I've found that I can keep even the
most ferocious woman docile and quite nicely immobilized when I used my
teeth.� And when they are finally
domesticated, I find it just gives me pleasure to bite them.� My left hand went from stroking her nylon clad
thigh to unzipping my pants.� The
ziiiiiip sound was shockingly loud in the quiet bathroom, the silence
previously broken only by the sound of my heavy breathing and Rebecca�s soft
gasps as I manipulated her against the counter.�
I pulled a tube of lubricant out of my pocket and opened it.� Then one-handed, I lavishly greased my
already stiff cock.� 

&nbsp;

Her buttocks finally ready to be bared, I lifted the back of her
short dress up and moved in to snuggle against her bare cheeks.� My right hand was bunched with hair from the
back of her neck and I still retained a ripple of flesh between my teeth from
the left side of her neck.� She was left
no choice; obediently leaning forward as ordered, she was an easy target.� I could feel the back of her right thigh
tremble against the outside of mine.� 

&nbsp;

For the first time she spoke as she began to beg softly. �Please,
Master.� Not here.� Not like this.� Don�t do this to me here.� Please, Master.�� The word Master finally seemed to come easily
to her lips now.� It truly was
amazing.� Only a few short weeks ago this
had been a proud, arrogant woman fully convinced of her God-given right to
treat a man, any man, in any way she wanted.�
She'd been a woman that had wielded power and overt dominion over men;
the complete antithesis of an eye-rolling, long-suffering female martyr.� Now I'd reduced her to an almost docile
acceptance of the intolerable; only at the end developing the courage to beg me
not to give her an after-hours ass-fucking in the Men�s room of a cheesy electronics
department store.� I ignored her.� I was hot and ready.� The stupid cunt should have known what was
coming when I brought her into the store.

&nbsp;

Her bare ass pushed out from the edge of the counter and I
separated her cheeks with my left hand.�
I began to push hard with my erection, using her beautifully puckered
and well-visited velvety-brown hole as a target.� I could feel her thigh begin trembling
against me again.� I began to push into
her harder now and she fought me instinctively, clenching her muscles
tightly.� After about fifteen seconds of
fighting her, I reached around with my left hand and gave the nipple wire a
quick, soft pluck like I was playing the breast harp.� She gave a soft cry of pain and immediately
relaxed her protective sphincter for just a second, allowing me a momentary
advantage as I entered her body from the rear. 

&nbsp;

Rebecca squealed once and tried to go up on the toes of her right
foot during my initial penetration, but even in heels she still wasn�t tall
enough to avoid giving me what I wanted.�
Anal sphincter fighting a losing battle, Rebecca suddenly accepted me
fully inside her body with a loud groan that originated from deep within her
belly.� I was helping to lubricate as I
fucked her, so I didn�t fill her all the way with my first penetration.� I pulled out a little, then drilled her with
the deepest part of my shaft on the second thrust.� I kept this up until none of me was left
visible between us.� I was only trying to
help lubricate her, but she squealed once again. �This time it was much more deeply in her
throat and with her teeth clenched; then she shuddered all over her body.� She still wasn�t quite ready, but I only
needed a couple more hip thrusts and her rectum was finally coated on the
inside with enough lubricant from my cock that I could go on to the main
act.� We were in total physical
communication now, connected only by the long, rigid, iron-like bar of my cock
buried in her beautiful, firm ass.� 

&nbsp;

Having gained full penetration, her asshole acted as a hot, tight
sleeve on my steaming erection; it felt like my whole cock was being vacuum
packed by her rectum, compressed equally along every inch except for the very
base where I leaned up against this beautiful woman.� There, her sphincter had clamped onto me and
it felt like a tight rubber band that kept loosening and tightening on me.� 

&nbsp;

I was now able to go back to stroking her nylon clad thigh with my
left hand as I slowly and rhythmically drilled her rectum with each move of my
hips.� Leisurely, I slid my hand up her
slick feeling thigh until I had reached the edge of her stocking.� I would pull out a little and she would
inhale with a soft hiss.� I would thrust
back inside her and she would groan softly or audibly gasp, each sound emitted
in parallel with the move of my hips.� It
was a dance without words, but the moves were always well choreographed by the
male lead.� The female lead followed the
prompts perfectly, intimately, as if fated from birth to play her part in the
dance.

&nbsp;

I played with the top of her stocking for a long minute, running
my fingers inside and out.� Finished with
this, my hand resumed its journey up the inside of her thigh until it reached
nirvana.� I played with her clit for a
second, then finger-fucked her pussy, before I finally put my hand on her
pelvis and pulled/pushed it towards my hips.�
With her right thigh still forced into the counter by the pressure of my
body from the back, she responded magnificently to my non-verbal commands.� She pooched her ass out towards me in order
to take in another half inch or so of hot meat.�
Christ, she felt good with her tight and hot, but rather unwilling flesh
totally encompassing my cock.� 

&nbsp;

I could look into the mirror and see her face.� Fine autocratic features, bones and skin of
the best breeding, stern beautiful mouth, eyes once as cold as North Atlantic
ice.� I could see that she hated what I
was doing to her here.� But maybe not.� She was moving with each thrust of my hips
now and matching me grind for grind.�
Maybe she was finally learned to like her sex rougher?� But what the fuck did I care either way?� She was mine and she'd do what I told her to
do.� I ass fucked her for about five
minutes, taking deep pleasure in forcing every kind of response from her.� Soft cries of pain, grunts of discomfort,
sighs, unintended gasps and groans, heavy breathing, wiggling ass, grinding
pelvis and out-thrust breasts; they all made me harder and more determined to
fuck her brains out in the Men�s room.� 

&nbsp;

Suddenly, we both froze, her leaning awkwardly forward, eyes
slitted in discomfort, dress hiked up around her waist, me buried deep inside
her rear end.� The door to the bathroom
opened and a young man with a manager�s badge walked in on us.� He stood there looking at us with his eyes
bulging and mouth open for what seemed an eternity, but must have been only a
few seconds.� His face red, he yelled,
�What the hell are doing here?� Get
out.� I�m calling the cops.�� Then he fled and we were alone again.� 

&nbsp;

I looked at my sweet meat-cunt in the mirror and her face was
scarlet red with disgrace and shame.� We
had a little time yet and I wasn't worried.�
I smiled at her into the mirror over her shoulder, then grabbed her hair
and pulled her head back towards me as I resumed pumping her in the ass.� She had her face up towards the ceiling now
with her eyes closed, her face flushed red and hot with embarrassment.� 

&nbsp;

�Please...uhhhnnn.......Master.�
Let�s.......aaahh-uhhnnn.......ohhh gaawwwd.� Let's.....go before....oowww uuhhnnn......
the police arrive.� Please.�

&nbsp;

I laughed softly in delight and kept her hips pinned, positioned
so that I could continue drilling her.� I
thundered away at her gorgeous unresisting ass until sweat was pouring down my
face and my throat.� Finally, the feeling
of complete control over this beautiful woman; the physical, emotional and
psychological---it all combined into a massive surge in my loins and I blew a
load of cum deeper in her ass than ever before.�
She gasped as she felt me ejaculate and seemed to push against me even
harder for one last second.� But I didn�t
care; I was finished with her for now.� I
staggered back, gasping and blissful from the endorphin rush.

&nbsp;

Her face burned beet red with embarrassment.� She whispered softly, �Are we done?� with her
cheek turned away so that I could barely hear her words.� But I wasn't done yet and I wanted the world
to know.� The bite marks on the side of
her neck from my teeth were deep enough that anyone seeing her would know.�� She belonged to me.� 

&nbsp;

I backed away from her and zipped my pants up.� Like a good little robot, she remained stiff
in her sad, little position, standing on one leg with the other raised and
sticking straight out to the side, resting on the counter.� Really sexy before you got your nuts off,
after sex it was just stupid and pathetic.�
Her dress was still pulled up around the small of her back, showing her
stockings and garters.� Pearly drops of
cum appeared around her now red and swollen anus, beginning their long
gravity-driven roll towards freedom.� I
looked up at her face in the mirror and she was still leaning on her hands, but
her head hung down in shame and her eyes were closed.� The flush of her embarrassment had only
deepened if that was possible; even her ears were burning red now.� 

&nbsp;

�Christ, woman,� I said.�
�You look stupid like that.� Get
your leg down and wipe off that nasty shit that�s starting to run down the back
of your legs.� Stupid fucking
slave!�� Rebecca slowly dropped her left
foot to the floor and reached over with trembling fingers as she grabbed a
couple of paper towels with which to dry herself off.� At the same time, I grabbed my bag with the
video camera and turned it off.� I was
filled with anticipation to watch this video.

&nbsp;

�Christ woman, come on.� We
don�t have all day.� Got to get out
before the cops get here,� I said as I draped her breast leash over her left
shoulder.� Only half-finished wiping
herself, I chivvied her along and we left the men�s bathroom.� By this time, the store was closed and almost
all the lights were off.� She hurried
along in her position just behind my right shoulder, when I suddenly veered
towards a door marked MANAGER.� With her
breast leash now in my hands, Rebecca had no option but to follow me.� I stopped in front of the Manager�s door long
enough to push it open before I began to enter.�


&nbsp;

Inside it was dark.�
Confused, she stopped as I continued in.�
I reached back and tugged on her leash.�
She was forced to walk inside behind me when suddenly the lights came on
and it was clear that the room was filled with young men.� She tried to stop, but I stepped to the side
and pulled on her leash again, but harder this time and she had no choice but
to follow.� Without a word, I handed her
leash to a rather pimply faced young man.�
He began pulling her all the way inside as I said, �Here�s the whore I
promised.� Remember, she's free for
tonight only.� She likes it hard and
don�t listen to what she says.� I�ll come
back and get her when you�re done.�� 

&nbsp;

Chapter 26: Whatever they may be in public life, whatever their relations with
men, in their relations with women, all men are rapists and that's all they
are. They rape us with their eyes, their laws, their codes; Marilyn French.

&nbsp;

The young man pulled on her nipple leash even harder and Rebecca
was forced to put both of her hands protectively over her breasts to ensure the
horizontal piercing bars weren�t pulled through her nipples.� She was literally dragged forward into the
room, all the while looking back over her shoulder at me.� Finally, I allowed her eyes to catch
mine.� She gave me an imploring look, all
the while saying, �No, Master.� Please
don�t do this.� I�ll be good, Master. I
promise.� I PROMISE!�� 

&nbsp;

She was finally dragged all the way in, so I closed the door
behind us.� The walls and floor of the
small room were poured concrete.� A naked
bulb hung from the ceiling over the only desk, a small, scarred steel one that
at some time in the prehistoric past had been painted a robin's egg blue.� A group of young males stood in a group
around and behind the desk.� There was a
water cooler in one corner and it all looked just like it was; a nasty little
office/cubicle in which clerks could shuffle papers.� But not tonight.� Tonight it was perfect for after-hours office
sex.� I put the bag with video camera up
high on a shelf that was by the door and turned the camera on.� By then Rebecca was surrounded by young geeky
looking men.� 

&nbsp;

It had taken me several days to set this up, but I'd finally
succeeded.� I'd talked to a young man
that owed me big time for some work I'd done for his family.� He was acting manager of his father�s small
electronic store and I'd convinced him that I had a whore that I had paid to
play a �part� in a role-acting game tonight.�
I told him that she got into �kinky� scenes and the deal was that if
he'd let me use his bathroom with Rebecca after they had closed for the night,
he and some of his friends could have her afterwards.� I warned him that she might not like it at
first, but I'd paid her enough that she'd go along with the surprise eventually.� The only thing was, I said, he had to make
sure that all of the boys used condoms because I wasn�t sure whether or not she
was clean.� He quickly agreed to this one
stipulation.� I had also prepped him to
come in the bathroom to catch us, because I knew that Rebecca would be
humiliated if caught like that---God, had that worked out good.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

There was the smell of aroused geek testosterone in the air
tonight, and the little lady I provided was the main attraction.� A couple of the boys looked nervous and a
little uncertain about joining in.� By
the time I got the camera ready and turned on, the rest had Rebecca lying on
her back on the desk.� She was crying and
begging them to stop, but it didn't slow them down.� One of the guys held her wrists pinned above
her head, while two others held her ankles.�
Her legs were spread wide, the backs of her knees locked against their
chests as the bottom of her high heels faced the ceiling.� Another young man was in the process of
exposing her breasts.� Once her tits were
free of the dress, everyone began laughing and making rude comments about her
breast piercings and her nipple wire.� 

&nbsp;

Young men were playing with her tits, stroking and pushing at her
naked pussy, and feeling and stroking her stocking covered legs.� The smallest boy in the room reminded me of a
mongoose.� He kept pulling on her nipple
wire, repeatedly making her cry out in pain.�
Eventually, he took it off after he got tired of hurting her.� Finally, one of the boys realized that she'd
also been branded next to her vagina.�
This was the final realization for her audience and quieted everyone for
a second, before pandemonium broke out among the young men as they whooped with
laughter and congratulated themselves on their luck.� The two boys that had looked uncertain
earlier were now absolutely convinced that this was okay.� After all, these were not guys that got much
pussy and all of them were looking forward to taking this beautiful whore in
every way possible.� 

&nbsp;

I smiled to myself as I saw that the assistant manager had taken
my advice and looked up the use of ginger on the Internet.� They had Rebecca�s legs spread wide and were
in the process of pushing a particularly long, but nicely wedged-shaped finger
of ginger up her sloppy ass.� Fortunately
(or unfortunately) for her, there were two more pieces floating in the bowl, so
I knew she was in for one hell of a ride tonight when they sheathed the last
one in her rectum.� This bitch would be
one sore cunt tomorrow.� Oh well, it
wasn�t my ass.

&nbsp;

I set up the camera near a socket
and plugged in the adapter so I wouldn't need battery power.� After making sure it was focused on the desk,
I left her to the boys.� As I closed the
door, I glanced back one last time as I heard her cry out for me.� Pinned to the desk, they held her wrists
above her head now and one boy was holding each ankle; they still had her knees
locked and beautiful legs straight.� Her
feet were spread far apart, heels pointed straight into the air and her toes at
the wall behind her head.� The leather
leash had already been removed and thrown into a corner.

&nbsp;

As I turned to leave, I heard her scream in pain, then start
begging.� This got all of them giggling
hysterically.� Except for the end, the
white ginger root had disappeared inside Rebecca and two of them took turns
pushing her cheeks together.� I waited
for a minute as she writhed and begged on the desk.� 

&nbsp;

Soon, she was crying softly, �No.�
No. Not like this.� Please
no.�� And then it was over for her.� I could tell the burn had begun and her pussy
would be leaking love juice like a waterfall in less than a minute.� I left after I checked to make sure that all
of the nerds were planning to use condoms.�


&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I closed the door and began my
wait.� I was tired, but felt comfortably
relaxed from having fucked Rebecca just a few minutes ago.� I'd just wait for my new woman outside the
office and might even catch a nap if I was lucky.� I dragged a floor model desk chair over by
the Manager's office and had it leaning back as far as it would go.� Even though I could barely hear voices in the
office, the buzz from within sounded a lot like her begging.� There were also sudden bursts of male
laughter.� But I ignored these like one
would an annoying fly that buzzed around your head.� 

&nbsp;

Within a few minutes I was dozing
off, but was awakened several times by surprisingly loud, long drawn out female
moans and cries; once my snooze was disturbed by a short, sharp gut-wrenching
scream that was suddenly cut-off in mid-voice.�
I waited almost 90 minutes before the door opened for the first time and
a couple of the young men came out, buckling their pants and laughing.� Finally they gave each other a high five and
walked out the door without even looking at me---the ungrateful bastards.� The other boys left one at a time until there
were only four left.� Three of them came
out a little over half an hour later and told me that the Assistant Manager was
waiting for me inside.� 

&nbsp;

When I walked in, the office reeked of sweaty bodies and wet
sex.� He was impersonally cleaning cum
marks off the desk top, while Rebecca sat on the edge of the plastic visitors
chair with a shell-shocked look in her eyes, staring off
into what could only be called the far distance.� I glanced at her and she LOOKED like a cheap, well-used
whore now, seeming to be a different person from the one I'd first brought here
tonight.� I wondered if I�d gone too far
in my quest to break this woman.� Most
people can handle so much more stress than they would ever believe, but even
the most flexible can be driven over the edge and broken into small pieces if
pushed too far.� 

&nbsp;

Rebecca had been pushed perhaps to
the edge of madness.� Her beautiful pierced
breasts were now unconfined by the dress and there was a
crumpled ten dollar bill on her lap.� She
was sitting slumped over in the chair making small back and forth rocking
motions with her head and upper body.�
And while her legs were sticking straight out in front of her, Rebecca's
hand left hand was clamped between her thighs and her knees were tightly locked
together.� Her right hand was across her
chest, supporting her breasts.� The dress
barely came up to top of her thighs in this position, and it was blotched everywhere
with white cum stains.� Both of her
stockings had runs in them now, and the high-heeled sandals she wore were
scuffed on the sides from what could only have been her struggles while the
young men had mounted her on the desk. 

&nbsp;

He looked at me and said, �Thanks man, for loaning us the whore
tonight, but you�d better get the slut out of here now.� She's a nice piece of ass and you
need to bring her back again.� But I want
to get the place cleaned up for the evening; the bitch smells like hell and
she's leaking all over the place.�� Nodding my head in
agreement, I looked around and saw the leash and gold chain lying together in
one corner.� 

&nbsp;

I threw the chain in her lap and said, �Put it on.�� Rebecca looked at me for a second like a
zombie, then picked up the chain.� With
shaking fingers, she finally attached the chain to both nipple rings.� I looked around a little more and finally
found and pocketed her nipple wire.� I
grabbed her breast leash and dragged Rebecca to her feet, then handed her the
leash without a word.� She silently
attached the leash to the center ring of the breast chain and threw it over her
shoulder.� The crumpled ball of money lay
at her feet.

&nbsp;

The front of her dress had been
torn; her breasts hung free and she was again doing her best to hide this with
her right arm crossed over her chest.� I
grabbed her right bicep and pulled Rebecca's arm away to look at her
chest.� I could see that her breasts were
unconfined except for the chain that connected her nipple piercings.� The ends of her breasts somehow looked
different to me.� Both tips protruded far
more than before.� Her nipples were
enormous now, the angry color of blood-red raspberries and they just didn't
seem to want to go down.� They looked as
hard as a rock and must have been sore as hell; with the way she protected her
chest with her arm, I guessed they really were sensitive.

&nbsp;

She moved like a robot, so I tucked her breasts back inside the
short black dress� as best I could.� Except for her lipstick, her make-up was long
gone and while she had the bite marks of my ownership on her neck, many new
ones had been tattooed into her skin along with the old ones.� Her hair was ratted and tangled,
matted to her face by what could only have been partially dried cum.� In some places, her face was shiny and
reflected the harsh fluorescent lighting, the skin slick from cum that was
still wet and sticky.� Other parts of her
face looked like they were covered in a dried version of the cheap white wood
glue that's used to hold furniture together.�
Although much of it was around her mouth, chin and down the front of her
neck, her chest was liberally covered with the drying clearish-white gummy
fluid too.� Tracks of tears were obvious
on her cheeks and her mascara had run, giving her the look of a bruised
raccoon.� She looked downright nasty.

&nbsp;

I grabbed her arm after I'd
retrieved my camera.� She didn't look at
me, but just stared at the wall as she continued to cover her chest in a
recently re-discovered need to maintain some small amount of modesty.� I dragged her out of the room and out into
the main store.� We were accompanied by
the same echoing click-clack of high heels as when we had first come tonight,
but it was somehow different now.� She
moved slowly as if her hips hurt her; the Denholm Lilt that had so captivated
every man earlier that night was pretty much a thing of the past---at least for
now.� My little slave now had a limp and
walked as slowly and cautiously as if she were a hundred years old.� Rebecca still kept her right arm across her
chest, but now cradled her belly with her left.�
I guess getting your brains fucked out gang-bang style can lead to some
serious stomach cramps too.

&nbsp;

Playing to the single remaining audience, I said, �Baby, you did
good tonight.�� Then I led my �whore� out
of the office where I stopped.� She moved
wherever I pointed her, slowly, tentatively, like a re-animated cadaver,
stumbling on her designer heels without thought or protest.� I pushed her face-up against the wall and
cuffed her hands behind her back.� I
wasn�t sure how she would handle being gang-banged this early in her slavery,
so I needed to take a few precautions.� 

&nbsp;

The evening was cool and I'd brought along a coat for
Rebecca.� I draped this over her
shoulders; no one that saw her in the parking lot would realize that she wore
cuffs.� From here, I led her out to the car.� On the way out in the deserted parking lot, I
looked at her and said, �You always knew you acted like a cunt to men.� And even if you didn�t know it, I�ve showed
you that you were always a slut inside too.�
But now, baby, now you�re a whore.�
You're my whore.� You're at� the bottom of the gutter woman, and it�s only
me that can keep you from drowning there.�

&nbsp;

The once-pretend slut truly was a slut now.� And I'd made her into my whore too.� She said nothing to any of my taunts.

&nbsp;

Half-way to the car, Rebecca
suddenly begged me to stop in a hoarse voice as she fell uncontrollably to her
knees and began vomiting.� Her voice was
so raspy now that I could barely understand her.� When she was done emptying her stomach, I
helped her to her feet and used the front of her ripped dress to wipe her mouth
off.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I was numb inside, but I could feel
that nausea building inside.� �Stop,� I
begged him.� �Please stop.�� My throat was so sore from having huge
erections recklessly rammed down it that I could barely talk.� I stumbled to my knees, barely making it in
time.� My wrists were still bound behind
my back, but I clutched my arms against my sides as tight as I could and leaned
forward as everything inside my stomach came up, everything evil that had just
been put there.� Tears were streaming
down my face and snot was running out of my nose and I felt like my stomach
itself might tear loose from inside me and make its way onto the tar of the
parking lot on which I kneeled.

&nbsp;

Finally, it subsided.� I rocked on my knees for a second, sucking
air, then spat and tried to stand up.� I
couldn't by myself and the man that stood next to me dragged me to my feet and
on to his car.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

We went to the car.� She looked and acted like a recently revived
corpse, a bloodless body without mind or will.�
I thought about it afterwards.�
Before tonight, her beautiful face had been like a large isolated house
facing the street, its windows lit from inside, perhaps promising lamp and
firelight within if only one were patient enough.� Then I'd let the boys get at her tonight, and
when you looked at her now, you realized the blinds had come down.� I wasn't worried too much though.� I felt like I had forever to work with her,
and sooner or later, she'd have to come back to me.� But the main thing was that no matter what
she might be feeling or thinking, she was in no shape to be running off or
fighting me right now.� She was facing
the car as I pushed her up against it, then walked back to unlock the trunk.� The manager had been right.� I needed a towel for her to sit on because
she was still leaking so much cum from her pussy and ass.� So much for the boys using condoms all the
time.

&nbsp;

After I had buckled her seat belt,
she remained silent, looking out the car window the whole time we were in traffic.� She sat next to me, unmoving, frozen into an
arctic silence.� No tears, no sobs, no
recriminations, nothing.� Her frozen
silence was a little unnerving.� Nothing
was left of the self-important, self-entitled bitch I'd met at that first lunch
so many days ago.� She was a burned out
husk now, totally different from the strong, confident, even arrogant woman
that had tried to control everything that first weekend.� I'd taken her all the way to the bottom.� 

&nbsp;

The slave's existence ahead of her
had always been real, but she had continuously refused to acknowledge its
reality.� Instead, I think she'd always
assumed that she'd somehow in the end uncover some unknown route to freedom
before it went too far, or that I would experience a rush of emotions at the
last moment and take pity on her.� Well,
now she knew what her life would be like.�
She wasn't living in a movie like An Officer and A Gentlemen,
where some handsome hero came in at the end and carried her away to a new
life.� She'd finally realized she was a
slave, and that rape-sex was a major part of her new existence.� This last experience with the boys would
either kill her or make her face her new life head on.� 

&nbsp;

We parked in my garage and I got
out.� She sat in the car, too exhausted
to move.� I walked over and opened the
door and stood there waiting for her.�
After a moment, Rebecca attempted to sit up and get out.� She got about half way out of the car when
she hesitated for a second, then continued the move out.� More stomach cramps, I suppose.� I walked my now shabby looking street-slut
into the house and through my bedroom into the White Room.� 

&nbsp;

I sat her on the edge of her bed and
told her that from what'd happened tonight, she could finally figure out what
her life would be like from now on unless she gave me absolute
cooperation.� No more games.� If she didn't get serious and accept it all
beginning immediately, I'd make sure that she went through this once a week for
the next year.� The reason it would only
be once a week and not more often, I told her, was that it would take that long
for her to recover and be ready to �party� with boys again.� I would have no trouble, I assured her, in
getting more than enough young men volunteering to ensure that her pussy and
ass hurt so much from being gang-fucked, she'd never walk straight again.

&nbsp;

After telling her she was to get
herself cleaned up, I uncuffed her and left her alone.� I locked her in the room and then went to the
monitors to see how she acted.� Slowly,
Rebecca undressed and stood up, cradling her stomach with both hands.� I could easily see my bites from earlier in
the night on the side of her neck.� The
insides of both thighs and just over her cunt were also covered with bite
marks.� Her breasts were bruised and
mis-shapen, and even from a distance her nipples still looked angry and
engorged from being captured with the tight wire loops.

&nbsp;

She looked at the torn and nasty
little black dress and stockings that lay in front of her, and with a soft sob,
bent over carefully to pick them up before she wadded them up into a sodden
mass and suddenly threw them across the room towards the door by which I had
just left.� She stood for a moment
swaying, then slowly and painfully walked over to the shower.� She stopped at the mirror and looked at herself.� She started crying as she examined her
breasts, then her neck and between her legs.�
Finally, she stood in the shower for over thirty minutes, just soaking
and then carefully soaping herself between her legs, then washing her
hair.� 

&nbsp;

After Rebecca finished soaping and
showering herself clean, she would stand there in the spraying water for a
second and then begin the whole procedure all over again.� Every two or three minutes, she would open
her mouth to the water showering down on her and flush her mouth out.� She did this multiple times.� Finally finished, she slowly got out and
dried herself off before walking over to the bed and lying down.� Naked under the single light blanket I
allowed her, she curled up against the far side of the bed and after bringing
her knees up to her chest and putting her hands between her thighs, she cried
softly and rocked back and forth with a small, economical motion.� 

&nbsp;

I didn't think I needed to chain her
wrist to the bed tonight.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Chapter 27: The principle of procrastinated rape is said to be the ruling one
in all the great bestsellers; V. S. Pritchett.

&nbsp;

The next part comes from the video that I'd recorded.� I watched myself begin to ass-fuck this
gorgeous woman in the cheesy men�s bathroom.�
Even though I�d already had her once and she�d been gang-raped
afterwards, I felt the blood get heavy in my groin and my penis begin to stir
again as I watched the video and thought about the exhausted woman that lay
alone in bed in the next room.� 

&nbsp;

The camera had been set off to my back right, so there was a good
view of both of us from the side and a clear shot of her in the mirror.� Rebecca stood only on her long and shapely
right leg; the high heel on her left foot could barely be on the other side of
me as it rested in a sink.� I could see
where the sheer black stocking ended a little above mid-thigh, and I could see
the garter strap as it was stretched tautly over her muscular buttock before
connecting to her stocking top.� 

&nbsp;

Rebecca�s head was tilted towards her right shoulder, freeing her
long beautiful neck for my teeth.� I saw
myself reach around and strum her nipple harp, and I saw her grimace with
pain.� Then as I penetrated her ass for
real, I saw her go up on the toes of her right foot in a futile attempt to
avoid accepting all of me.� Even though
she was leaning forward onto her palms, her face was up and I could see her
blue slitted eyes glitter in the fluorescent light.� Her jaw was clenched and what could only be
described as a grimace opened her lips and freed her gritted teeth for
view.� I watched myself ass-fucking this
beautiful woman and I have to admit I got a hard-on all over again.� I watched her react in shock and embarrassment
to the young man's entry and the stony smile on my face as I finished her off.� Then it was over and inside of the office
filled the scene.

&nbsp;

The view was perfect; Rebecca was
trying to fight them off initially, but it became obvious from the beginning
that it would do no good.� She was
overwhelmed, then easily laid on the metal desk and opened up like a small
shrimp on a New Orleans poboy.� Her
breasts were exposed and her naked pussy was in plain site.� The leash was thrown in a corner and they
brought out the ginger finger for her to see; she began to fight them even
harder if that were possible.� Once the ginger was buried
in her ass, one of the guys even rubbed a small piece of ginger against her
clit for a second.� Now Rebecca almost
howled in frustration and horrified anticipation as she must have felt the
beginning of the burn. 

&nbsp;

Rebecca could still function at this point as she swung her head
back and forth, begging someone, anyone to listen.� But they were all too excited.� She claimed she wasn�t a prostitute and
wanted them to call the police�she claimed she'd been kidnapped and
tortured.� But none of them listened; I
think the still healing brand and breast loops and nipple wire spoke to them in
a much louder volume than did her words.�
I think that this was perhaps the hardest part for Rebecca to take;
their total inability to see her as a human being rather than a disembodied,
impersonal vessel of flesh only suitable for depositing their semen; a mobile
vagina that was now theirs and available for the taking.� Soon, far too soon for Rebecca, the rocket
burn between her legs and in her ass began to take over her mind and body.

&nbsp;

Rebecca's legs were still pinned
against two male chests, knees locked and feet pointing towards the ceiling as
the group waited for the ginger to take final effect.� I watched as one of the boys to the side
quickly stripped.� After sucking on a
wire-bound nipple for a second, he climbed upon the desk and finally ended up
sitting on her chest and stomach.� He
leaned forward and even though Rebecca had trouble breathing with him sitting
on her like that, she still tried to fight him, when two of the guys grabbed
her wrists and pinned her hands above her head again.� 

&nbsp;

He had his knees on either side of
her chest as he leaned forward and carefully pushed his cock between her
nipple-bound breasts and underneath the chains that connected her nipple
rings.� She screamed in sudden pain as
her sweaty breasts were easily pushed apart and the tip of his cock suddenly
appeared just below her chin as it peeked out from his personal tit-fuck
tunnel.� He slowly began easing it back
and forth, driving it towards her face until his nuts racked against the base
of her breasts, then pulling it back.� It
must have felt like her nipples were being pulled off at the roots.� Rebecca could only stare in mute horror at
the young man as she was tit-fucked for the first time in her life.� She tried to fight again, but the struggles
only tore at her nipples even more.� She
had to stop---even for her it hurt too much.�
As long her breasts were bound together by the nipples like this, he
could use his hands to slap her face or choke her or just fill them with her
beautiful globes as he hip-stroked between them.� 

&nbsp;

The others had seen what he was
doing now and were egging him on.� They
all seemed to be waiting for something.�
Finally, he cupped Rebecca's breasts and she loudly moaned in pain
again.� He started going faster and
faster and she tried to pull back, but he grabbed her hair and pulled her face
back towards him.� 

&nbsp;

�Come on, bitch,� he crooned to
himself with his eyes closed. ��Look at
me, look at it.� Soon, you're going to
feel it all over you.� Oh yeah, that's
it, baby.�� His speed continued to build
and by now he was slamming his cock back and forth into the artificial
cum-tunnel he'd created out of her flesh.�


&nbsp;

The owner�s son had stripped his pants off by now and stood at the
foot of the desk, his skinny legs hanging out from under his unbuttoned
shirt.� He was an
exceedingly ugly young man; he had bulgy eyes and was short and hirsute, with
thick, curly black chest hair.� He had a
haircut that wasn't quite skin, some kind of gadget in his mouth to straighten
his teeth, and an Adam's apple about a third the size of his head.� She could see him standing just behind the
boy seated on her chest.� I watched as
she took one look at him and tried to fight them all over again, but quickly
gave up as the tit-fucker grabbed her attention one last time.� This time he grabbed her breasts and pulled,
pumping frantically now.� Suddenly, the
tip of his cock peeked from between her breasts and the first string of cum
jetted out and splattered against the underside of Rebecca's jaw.� The next strong ejaculation shot out and
landed on her neck; the third and fourth ones were weaker and landed on her
chest not too far from his cock.�
Finally, he left a trail of watery ejaculate on the insides of her
breasts as he withdrew his erection from Rebecca's tit-tunnel.� He gasped, breathing heavily for half a
minute as he sat on the helpless woman's chest, then climbed off.� 

&nbsp;

But that didn't stop the assistant
manager who had waited between her legs.�
Judging that she was ready, he lowered himself on Rebecca�s belly and with one easy thrust,
inexpertly slid into her up to his nuts.�


&nbsp;

She was ginger-wet and tit-fucked.�
And now she ready despite herself; her spread legs
and dripping pussy invited him in and easily accepted his male offering, even
as she alternated between begging him for help and threatening him with the
police.� Rebecca screamed once more in frustration, or
perhaps denial.� She fought him for a
couple of more minutes, but was totally helpless.� I could tell that she was finding it harder
and harder to ignore what the ginger was doing to her.� And then, she could ignore it no more.� 

&nbsp;

Suddenly, she surprised all of the boys as she stopped struggling
for about a minute, allowing the hirsute one between her thighs full access to
the heaven she represented to these boys.�
Then she slowly began working her hips and belly against him.� Her eyes were closed and you could tell from
her face that she hated herself at that moment.�
But she was a ginger-slut for sure now.� After watching in fascination for a couple of
more minutes, the
boys holding her feet finally let go and the manager's son immediately clasped
her nylon-clad legs against his chest and neck and leaned forward, pushing her
knees towards her chest and bending her almost double.� She was a flexible bitch and once the boy at
her head let go of her hands, she began fucking like a pro, her hands resting
softly on the heads of the boys working her tits.� I smiled to myself again.� The ginger did it every time.� I didn�t necessarily use it on her a lot, but
when I did, the results were spectacular.�


&nbsp;

I�ve always been a leg man
myself.� And there were boys there that
liked to be sucked off since her mouth was almost always full of hard cock
being driven down her throat.� But there
were at least four �tit� geeks in the group tonight too.� Oh, they pussy-fucked her all right, but it
was her beautiful breasts that really fascinated these lads.� They wiped her clean of any cum, and every
boy there took turns working and sucking her tits, but the four titty boys
ensured that her breasts and nipples were never left alone for less than five
seconds for over an hour and a half.�
Literally, as soon as one of boys left one of her breasts unattended,
another was bent over nursing at her chest again immediately.� One on each breast, nipple buried to the back
of the their throat, mostly sucking so hard that their cheeks were pulled
in.� But a lot of licking or soft biting,
or tugging and massaging was going on too.�
Finally, the breast chain went into the corner too, allowing full access
at her gorgeous breasts.

&nbsp;

She was no more than a pleasurable animal to them now, nothing but
their milk cow.� And even though Rebecca
wasn�t going to provide any milk, that didn�t stop them.� She was female and had tits, and that was
enough.� The tips of her breasts were
completely aroused after only a few minutes, but the boys never stopped.� Their suctioning mouths pulled and drew her
nipples out over and over again, until each eventually looked as hard as a
rock.� Soon both of her breasts were
swollen and melon hard as blood filled the beautiful, nubile nipples.� When these were over-filled, it then backed
up to fill the globes of flesh themselves as each continued to get the young
males full attention.� Damn!� No wonder her breasts had been so mis-shapen!

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I felt I was living in a dream world.� I had long ago crossed the boundary where
fear took over and dominated my life.� I
was mentally exhausted after being used in the bathroom.� I wanted to resist, but the threat of a man's
clenched fist was ever present.� I'd been
on the verge of trying to resist him, when he'd dragged me in to the next room
using the leash attached to my breasts.�
As stupid as any cow, I'd accompanied him docilely.� Then the lights came on and I knew for
certain.� No, this couldn't be happening;
surely it was a terrible nightmare and I would wake up at any moment, free once
again.� My mind had gone blank and inside
I was more dead than alive.� I'd closed
my eyes so tightly they hurt, but I didn't even have time to beg God to let the
earth swallow me.� 

&nbsp;

I couldn't believe my Master had done this to me.� I couldn't believe that ANY person would set
up another human being for this.� NO, I
thought to myself.� Not like this, not in
a place like this.� But there was nothing
I could do to fight off these young animals.�
And the worst part was that they left me nothing.� Not pride, not strength, not even desperation;
nothing of decency nor even of life was left to me by them.� They pinned me down and drove ginger inside
me---and I knew what this meant.� I lay
pinned on my back, begging them to stop, &quot;Please, not this.� Not this.�
Not here.&quot;� Begging them to let
me go before it took over my body and my will.�
But all they did was laugh at me and touch my body as they waited.� 

&nbsp;

One of them climbed on me and began to thrust himself
between my breasts.� The pressure of him
pushing himself between my bound breasts felt like it would tear my nipples
off.� I couldn't help myself as I tried
to fight him.� But my strength didn't
last long because it hurt too much to fight him.� Suddenly, he came all over my chest and
chin.� I felt warm and sticky at first,
but later as it began to dry, I felt like I'd been thickly coated everywhere
with his semen.

&nbsp;

The fire continued to build more and more inside me and then
it was too late.� It began its awful
slow-fast burn and my body began to respond as everyone there seemed to know it
would.� I was humiliated.� Angry.�
Mortified.� Terrified.� But all they could see was that I was soaking
wet for them.� I was a little girl again
in a world of adults and the world and my body was out of my control.� 

&nbsp;

He was the first and already I was in a frenzy of burning.� I got a good look at him and realized that it
was the boy that had seen Master and I in the bathroom.� God, not him.�
Please let it not be him first.� I
whispered to him that I wanted him to call the police, that I had been kidnapped.� But I think he thought I was a prostitute
instead; clearly, he didn't believe me.� 

&nbsp;

It didn't matter though, for nothing could have saved me.� He made them keep me waiting while the flames
of my personal hell built and built, and finally that familiar roaring fire
took over my soul.� The others wore
condoms on their erections, but not him.�
I couldn't stop writhing on the desk, not even at the end when he
exploded that first fiery bomb so deep into my belly.� And when the heat of his body's fluid that
he'd jetted into my vagina was finally fading, in its place he left a deep
emptiness.� I felt a sense of anguish, as
if I were foundering in denial and profound despair.� 

&nbsp;

God help me, in all truth I also somehow felt as if I welcomed the
next boy, wanting to silently urge him to fuck me faster.� I knew that nothing could save me from this
tonight and I wanted it over.� Yet at the
same time, even as I sensed in the deepest, most wicked part of me that while I
mourned the death of everything I thought of as good and decent in me, I was
still being presented with the most astonishing of sensual opportunities.� And in the instant of the second boy's entry,
I somehow experienced a fleeting awareness of something very high, very pure
and quite clinically empty; the doing of the thing, the not thinking as I
draped my ankles over my second rapist's shoulder's; that weird adrenal
exultation that flashed inside me as he bent me almost double, helping erase
the ever more troublesome aspects of self that hated and fought this.� 

&nbsp;

They all stood around watching, mocking, laughing,
contemptuous of my moans and the shocked look on my face as I was raped and
forced into oral sex.� My throat became
so sore and swollen that it became ever more painful to continue handling those
that used it for their sport.� It finally dawned on me
that each boy was trying to force my throat to go into convulsions around their
hard dicks. That seemed to provide them a unique type of stimulus, and several
times resulted in my getting a bellyful of salty cum.

&nbsp;

And to my everlasting shame, I cooperated with them for as
long as that fire burned inside me---and it seemed to burn forever.� God,
I was being raped----yet I needed to cooperate at some level.� And I wanted to kill every one of the bastard's
lined up to use me.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

Rebecca tried to fight them
off at first, pulling on their hair as they leaned over her chest to suck on
her breasts, but her wrists were quickly pinned over her head again and soon
she seemed to lose interest in what was happening to her tits as she began to
experience the other more �spicy� things being done to the rest of her
body.� I winced, as after about twenty
minutes, they pulled the first piece of ginger out and put a second one
in.� She would be burned tomorrow, I was
sure of that.� 

&nbsp;

She was well and truly
gang-fucked before they flipped her over at the end, but even as excited and
responsive as she'd been with the ginger, her nipples must have been extremely
sensitive and painful after forty-five minutes or so.� For at that point, it seemed the sensations
in her nipples and breasts now over-rode the feeling of being
pussy-fucked.� And as their hungry mouths
continued to take in her nipples again and again, she first began to cry out
and groan louder and louder, then grunted like a barnyard animal with the now
increasingly painful sucking sensations; she couldn�t do more than grunt
because her mouth was always filled with one piece of stiff meat after
another.� After almost an hour, Rebecca
was giving continual soft, guttural screams of agony as the attention to her
swollen breasts and extremely sensitive nipples continued.� This went on for at least another ten or
fifteen minutes.� And through it all, she
still continued to cooperate as she was being fucked by one after another of
the boys.

&nbsp;

I was amazed how aroused her breasts looked.� The tips were shaped like a wine goblet
now.� Or perhaps bell-shaped might be a
better description.� Have you ever seen
those small glass or plastic bell shaped ornaments that are hung on Christmas
trees?� You know, the ones that are about
an inch or so long?� That�s how the ends
of Rebecca�s breasts looked now.�
Slightly puckered from being in the boy's mouths and almost blood red in
color from having been sucked on for so long and so hard.� Definitely rock hard now from being engorged
with massive amounts of blood drawn in by the continuous sucking.� The nipples stood out over half an inch from
the misshapen ends of her tits; the last inch of darker aureole flesh at the
end was puffed out and swollen, assuming an almost church bell shape.� 

&nbsp;

The boys were only a year or two older than the ones she'd seduced
in school, but the difference here was that none of them were under her
control.� She couldn�t stop them or save
herself.� Except for that bastard the
manager's son, they initially all wore condoms.�
As soon as one of them came in her pussy, he would pull out and the next
would mount her.� Within a few minutes,
she was taking them just as good as any pro could.� 

&nbsp;

Eventually, one of them took the discarded scum filled condom off
his limp cock and reversed it so that the inside of the tip could be seen.� He had one of the boys hold Rebecca�s mouth
open and proceeded to drain the nasty thing into her mouth.� She fought him at first and when he was done,
he harshly rubbed the inside of the condom on her face until it was empty and
dry.� Within seconds, all of the
remaining used rubbers were being picked up off the floor and cold thick semen
was being squeezed out of the condom and drained directly into Rebecca�s
mouth.� She seemed to give up after the
first one and didn�t fight nearly as much, only coughing a little as she lay on
her back and swallowed what looked like a cup of cum in about two minutes.� The rest, they ensured, she wore on her face.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

They drew my nipples out over and over again with their sucking,
vacuuming mouths.� I felt like my breasts
had been inflated to the size of large balloons and squeezed out of shape by
what they�d done to me.� My nipples
screamed again and again at sensations from their never-ending, always open and
greedy mouths.� At the end, it was all I
could feel, all I could think about.� My
flesh felt so hard and unyielding in their mouths, yet so awfully, terribly
sensitive at the same time.� My nipples
were screaming for attention, but screaming for an end to it at the same
time.� I could look down and see myself
for a second or two when one had temporarily finished, but another had not yet
begun.� At the end, my nipples were red
and puckered and exquisitely painful; any touch now was unbearable.� The worst part was that they were hard and
swollen, sticking straight up into the air, begging for more attention---and I
couldn�t stop them.� I couldn�t help
myself; every time one of them started on me again now, I screamed first with
the pain and later at just the anticipation of the pain.� 

&nbsp;

And with sick pleasure.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

Finally, a couple of the boys dragged her off the desk and onto
her feet, then bent her over the desk.�
They held her wrists and pulled her arms tight to the far edge.� A tall, thin black kid that had already taken
her in the pussy twice walked up and pulled the second ginger finger out of her
ass.� Even though in training as an
ass-slut, she hoarsely moaned her appreciation; the pretty brown color was gone
now and her asshole was an angry red puckered opening.� What with me having already fucked her there
once tonight and then being forced to take in several pieces of ginger, she
must have been sore as hell and in agony from the burn.� But he didn�t hesitate.� He walked up between her long, shapely legs,
grabbed his long black condom covered cock in his right hand, spread her wide
with his left and expertly drilled her up the ass in one move of his hips.� 

&nbsp;

Man, talk about being right on target!� My girl arched her back and cried out in
horror, then screamed and bucked like a horse for about a minute before
settling down like an old-timer, finally allowing herself to be ass-reamed in
relative silence.� At the end, her head
was down and her cheek lay against the desk as he banged her.� He used her ass to mix a lot of chocolate and
vanilla, then he made a lot of shakes.�
When he finished cumming, all she said in a tiny croaky voice was, �Are
you done?� Please, sir, no more.�� 

&nbsp;

At this point, most of the guys had sated themselves on her body
several times over and a few were even ready to leave by now.� Although her voice was muffled and could
barely be heard, the plaintive tone was all it took.� If the stupid bitch had just kept her mouth
shut, she'd have been fine.� Instead, she
was rimmed and ass-rooted for another twenty minutes, her thighs driven into
the edge of the desk by at least another four or five geeks before everyone had
their fill.� Rebecca�s brains had
literally been fucked out tonight and I didn�t think she would be thanking me
for the experience.

&nbsp;

None of them were wearing
condoms now, and the number of boys that chose to use her asshole had grown as
the minutes rolled by. This too seemed to be by plan, as it now was taking most
of them longer before they filled her asshole with their hot loads of boiling
love/hate. Rebecca's asshole now was gaping to the point that it remained wide
even while they were exchanging positions to allow a new rapist to take her.� She made this odd squawking noise as her
insides were torn open by the force of the thrusts and from the continuous
battering and stretching her tender tube of flesh was enduring.

&nbsp;

As more and more of the
rapists had a second and third chance to hurt my little slave and further
reduce her self-esteem and confidence, they became more creative.� The last one of them put a few drops of
ginger oil on the outside of his cock which was sheathed in a double-walled
condom, and it quickly turned her fucked-out asshole to fire.� Although it looked like she nearly passed out
from the pain, Rebecca seemed to be grinding herself against her rapist's groin
at the same time.� He took his time
sliding it in and out of her burning tunnel and moving it from side to side to
make sure that the acid-like substance penetrated every possible area within
her colon.� 

&nbsp;

None of the young men had left yet
and she was still bent over the desk.�
Her dress was still draped up over the small of her back, and the backs
of her stocking covered thighs were visible.�
Both stockings had been laddered from her struggles and her feet were
forcibly spread between three and four feet apart.� There were continuous thin smears of either
clearish-white or a brownish fluid draining out of her asshole and vagina onto
the insides of her thighs.� There was no
fight left in her; at least not for tonight. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Chapter 28: However muted its present appearance may be, sexual dominion
obtains nevertheless as perhaps the most pervasive ideology of our culture and
provides its most fundamental concept of power; Kate Millet

&nbsp;

The young black kid, the tall skinny
one with long, sensitive fingers like a surgeon, now told the others that he
�...had always wanted to do something
with a whore and now was the chance.�
But,� he said, �she probably
won't like it too much.�� The audio
was tinny and full of echoes, but he was easy to understand.

&nbsp;

I had no idea what he planned and
Rebecca never reacted to his voice, acting instead as if he weren't there or
she hadn't heard him as she escaped into her own private world.� Searching the room quickly, he found a cotton
hand towel into which he quickly tied a large knot.� Grabbing a handful of hair, he pulled
Rebecca's head up and she cried out softly until he forced the knot into her
mouth.� He now let go of her hair and her
head fell back onto the desk as if she had no strength left in her neck.� Handing the ends of the towel to another guy,
he said, �Keep this tight in her mouth
because I promise you the cunt�s going to be making some noise now.�

&nbsp;

Walking over to his pants, he pulled
something out that I couldn't at first make out.� He held his hand over her buttocks and after
he had spanked her ass a couple of times to get the blood flowing, he drizzled
some lubricant over the fingers of his right hand from the bottle.� The sensation of oil falling on the crack of
her ass seemed to bring Rebecca back to life.�
She raised her head and tried to look over her shoulder at the naked young
man now standing down by her waist.� When
she saw him lean over her and felt him pull her cheeks apart, she began to
struggle weakly.� But it didn't do any
good.� The young man first centered two
fingers against her rim and began to push.�
Her head came up even further and I heard a muffled �nnnnnNNNGGHH!!�
that continued to rise in volume as he pressed his two fingers inside her rear
up to the knuckle.� �Oh man, this whore's been ass-fucked like hell tonight, but the bitch
is still tight,� he said.� �She's already got her muscles locked on to
me.� It's like trying to park a Cadillac
in a bicycle rack.�

&nbsp;

He laughed as he worked on her, �I had an uncle take me to Mexico for a week
once, and we saw a bitch take it like this in Tijuana.� A full hand up to the wrist---fist-fucked in
the ass all the way.� I've always wanted
to do this to a slut ever since I saw that bitch take it like that.�

&nbsp;

I could see that Rebecca had come
back to life now.� Her beautiful blue
eyes were wide with fright now as she tried to look over her shoulder.� Rebecca was finally fighting now, bucking
harder and trying to fight free from the men that held her down as she hoarsely
begged for her freedom.� Every now and
then, she would turn her upper body enough that her breasts would swing into
view.� Her tits were still misshapen from
being sucked on so much and her nipples stood out like light switches.� Her head was up and her eyes were bulging
with fear as she tried to see the man that would fill her rectum once more, but
this time in an impossible way.� Tears of
disbelief streamed down her face and she was obviously crying as the boy with
the towel gag forced her head back down.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

Somehow, it got even worse; I was draped over the desk on my
stomach, pinned and held helpless, and then I was sodomized multiple
times.� They held me down and multiple
men explored me there, pushing their fingers inside me and moving them back and
forth.� When the first one decided I was
ready, he plunged into me.� As usual,
there was a blinding pain and I gasped.�
He bit into my neck as he began to thrust.� I struggled at first and screamed, then
eventually I accepted the inevitable.� I
finally learned later that the pain would eventually become pleasure when I had
relinquished my previous beliefs and learned to relax and experience the rush of
intense feeling.� But I wasn't there yet
mentally.� So instead, I pushed back
against him, trying to keep something of myself safe, but he thought I was
cooperating, that I was somehow experiencing pleasure instead of degradation.� 

&nbsp;

�That's it, baby.�
Give in to it.� Give it all to
me.�� His voice against my neck would
have seemed soothing, except for what he was doing to me.� They all took their turns.� But inevitably, the most terrible part was
yet to come.� It was the Black One.� He was the worst of all; he kept me pinned
and then laughing, he began trying to force his hand inside me.� I could feel my muscles flexing and clenching
against him, trying to fight his fingers as they pushed at me.� I felt him smear more grease on me, then
press back into me again.� I cried out
for mercy, but even as I did it, I knew it would do no good.� He was talking to me, but I couldn't hear him
over the sound of blood rushing in my ears.���


&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I could see him press in, pushing
into her even more firmly.� Her flesh
seemed to yield a little more to his fingers, until they could travel no
further. &quot;Oh, you are such a slut.
Do you like that, bitch?� You feel so
tight and hot; come on, bitch.� Let me
know how much you like it.&quot;� My
beautiful slave couldn't answer because of the gag in her mouth, instead just giving
what sounded to the boys like a long sensuous groan.

&nbsp;

He flexed his buried fingers, then
withdrew them a little.� In the video, I
could see her sphincter spasming, opening and closing like the mouth of a fish
as he smeared the crack of her ass with still more lubricant.� He said, �I
can't begin to tell you how many white sluts I've seen like you flaunting
everything you've got in those tight dresses.�
You bitches wiggle your gorgeous asses, and after you've driven guys
like me nuts for the night, you go home and sit on a vibrator rather than have
anything to do with a brother like me.�
But not tonight, cunt.� Tonight
you get everything you ever wanted.&quot; 

&nbsp;

He began to move his fingers again,
using his other hand to keep her ass crack smeared with lubricant, the fluid
trickling down over the hole that even now was�
being investigated again.� He
pressed back onto her puckered red rim and then worked quickly on it, this time
making Rebecca jerk forward as she bellowed another muffled scream, her
fingernails scrabbling on the desk as she tried to claw the man that held her
wrists captive.� The young black man had
now formed his hand into a conical shape, a deadly spear made of four fingers
and thumb.� The point, made up of
multiple finger tips, now pressed hard directly against her hole.� 

&nbsp;

He continued to explain with
enthusiasm.� &quot;When I saw that slut in Mexico take a man's hand all the way up
her ass----I've always wondered why any woman would let a man do that to
her.� What it would take for someone to
want that to be done to them?� Okay,
you're a whore and you're paid to do this stuff.� Maybe you don't have a lot of choice in the
matter tonight, but I know that you're used to this kind of stuff and maybe
even like it.� But every since that
night, I've always wanted to have my hand buried all the way inside the perfect
ass.� And tonight that's you, bitch.� I've always wanted to see what it feels like
to fist-fuck a white bitch in the ass and see the look in her eyes when I do
it.�

&nbsp;

My little ass-toy that was out on
loan groaned again, then began to fight him even harder.� But he was on a roll and didn't plan on
backing off.� Her asshole was stretched
out hugely now by the four fingers buried up to just below the last
knuckle.� I couldn't believe how big her
hole was already.� She was constantly
bucking and fighting and crying and screaming, her body unable to accept
anymore penetration.� He stopped for a
second and took a deep breath, then clamped his left hand on her hip to hold
her immobilized, his arm over her lower back and pinning her hips to the desk
while he leaned into her ass, putting most of his weight into pushing with his
right hand. 

&nbsp;

*** 

&nbsp;

I kept begging him, &quot;Stop, stop please!� but all that
came out was �UgggghhhHHH!�
NnnnNNNGGG!!&quot; The towel gag kept every sound inside my mouth, each
word echoing as it rattled around inside my head.� He kept on pushing and pushing.� I was like a rag doll and he was shaking me
and ripping me open as he continued to force his dagger sharp fingertips
further and further inside me.� His hand
was tearing me apart and then suddenly, I felt my sphincter give way just as my
flesh was about to tear; he was in me, filling me in an unholy way and then I
felt my anus lock onto his wrist.� I
realized that I could handle a lot of pain and even liked it sometimes, but
this was shocking beyond anything I had ever felt in its intensity; it wasn't
sophisticated or clever---it was brutal and straight forward; it simply was
what it was and it overwhelmed me.� I
couldn't help myself; I froze in sheer agony as the pain continued to increase,
getting more and more intense as he pushed inch after inch deeper inside me.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

Rebecca was bucking and screaming
constantly now, and the young man hunched over between her legs was getting
frustrated.� �One of you fucker's give me
some help here.�� Except for the black
kid's heavy breathing and Rebecca's soft, muffled screams, the room was silent
now.� The other boys were standing frozen
in a circle around the two participants.�
You could see in their eyes that they thought this might have gone a
little too far.� Finally, one of them
stepped forward and pulled her cheeks apart to help Rebecca's assailant.� 

&nbsp;

Another boy stepped up and poured
some more lubricant onto his coned hand and the kid now began to push for
real.� He made some progress, then ran
into even more resistance from Rebecca's muscles.� He gave one final hard push with all of his
weight behind it and she screamed so loudly that everyone jumped.� Suddenly it was over; he had won and she had
lost.� He was buried inside her rectum up
to his wrist.� It was obvious when he
succeeded, because she howled her agony into the muffling towel even as she
immediately froze in place, afraid to move for fear of perhaps rupturing
herself.� His hand was buried inside the
tight rubbery hole that had never before been explored like this, that had
never been intended to be explored like this.�
I was hugely turned on and could feel my dick getting heavier even as I
watched.� Her red and quivering rim was perfectly
captured by the camera as it was stretched as taut as canvas on a tent, ready
to tear like cheap newspaper, yet still grabbing onto his wrist like it was her
only lifeline to sanity.� The insides of
her ass cheeks quivered as they pressed in against his forearm and bulged
around his wrist, and I knew that it must have felt like nothing she'd ever
experienced before.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

Suddenly, my life stopped.�
I
could make no sense of what he said.� My
mind was in total chaos, I had no concept of time.� Panic and fear were a permanent part of my
life.� What little touch of humanity that
remained was slowly being drained from my mind.�
To me, there was no life, no death, just this interminable limbo and the
awful pain that came and went. 

&nbsp;

The world ceased its eternal gyrations and nature fell
silent.� I entered a type of silent white
tunnel which proved that Einstein was right---time and space are related.� I looked over my shoulder and saw that time
had expanded and stretched, allowing me to study without haste both my attacker
and what he attempted.� Somehow, I wanted
to laugh.� I wanted to laugh inside
because I was flying.� It seemed I
couldn't erase the joy off my face the whole time that incredible experience
lasted.� It was like I was suspended; I
was a bird as I attempted to fly away from my body, my consciousness finally
coming to rest in a corner of the room near the ceiling.� In a way it felt like I could forget
everything being done to me; there was no time now, no today, no yesterday, no
tomorrow.� Only a forever without
end.� I didn't have a choice; I couldn't
move.� 

&nbsp;

I thought I'd escaped, but I hadn't.� I looked down in dismay as that poor body
below was mauled and ripped and torn.� I
know that he ripped her flesh that night---tearing her apart in his final
success, but I felt no pain.� I knew that
it must have felt to that poor woman like she was sitting on a fire hydrant.
He'd succeeded finally, he'd done it; his complete hand and wrist was inside
her pelvis now.� But he held still and I
could tell that the pain was slowly receding from her just a little.� After she could breathe again, I know that
she groaned finally.� The feeling of him
buried in her rear end like that must have been terribly painful and intensely
disgusting, but there was nothing she could do.�
And then he began moving again.�
And he began pumping like a machine, going in and out, in and out, on
and on and on.� 

&nbsp;

In that dreamworld, I finally realized how useless it was
for me to fight this anymore�any of this---it was my life and I was fated to
live it.� How bad could it be?� I'd asked myself that first day.� Now I paid for my pride.� I had always known that one of my biggest
sins was pride.� I'd admitted to pride in
all of its variations of arrogance, vanity, haughtiness.� As bad as the things had been that he'd done
to me, I'd been incapable of rejecting his challenge that night in the rain,
just as I was incapable of getting cold feet when any doubts were cast on my
courage or intelligence.� 

&nbsp;

I'd been caught in my own trap.� I would be living this life for as long as I
remained alive---or for as long as he kept me around.� But for as long as I could stay in that other
ghost world, I knew that I would be safe.�
By myself, I survived in the corner of that room for what seemed an
eternity, when I heard a sound coming from outside my cocoon of safety.� I listened closely, then suddenly realized
that it was my body, grunting again and again in pain, not believing what he
was doing to me, not believing where this young man's hand was.� Suddenly, the white tunnel ended and I
entered reality again; helpless, I felt myself re-enter the torn body of that
poor woman below me.� 

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

He moved a little as he tried to
spread his fingers, but her muscles and colon kept them trapped in a cone shape
that was probably starting to become a little uncomfortable.� Since he couldn't make a fist yet, he began
to move his hand in and out, moving no more than an inch or two at a time.� My little bitch screamed again and again as
he began to pump back and forth more vigorously now, moving inches at a time
now with each thrust.� She was his
ass-puppet, doing her absolute best to move with him in every direction; it was
either that or have her anus and rectal canal torn to pieces.

&nbsp;

Now he had more room in her
intestines.� Balling up his hand into a
fist he began a slow fist-fuck of his beautiful victim.� She appeared in shock, frozen in horror and
disbelief, failing at first to respond to the continually deeper assault on her
stretched and damaged asshole, but he kept pushing.� He moved deeper into her tunnel with every
pump of his arm now, always meeting resistance from her flesh.� But undiscouraged, he persisted and explored
further down that tight tube.� Nearly
half his forearm was inside her ass when he decided that she needed some
serious fisting.� Back and forth he
pounded, punching away inside her tight tunnel.

&nbsp;

All the boys stood back in delight,
their erections plain to see.� Some were
clearly ready again.� One of them was
braver than I ever would have been.�
Grabbing a handful of Rebecca's hair, he pulled her head back and
slapped her face hard three or four times just to get her attention.� Then he leaned in and whispered in her
ear.� Finally, he stood upright and
watched her for a second.� Her head remained
motionless.� He turned to the black kid
and said, �You're my leverage, man.� Give
her some.�� With that request, the kid
with his hand buried in her ass kept his hand in place, then braced his feet as
he lifted his wrist about two inches and rotated his forearm around his
hand.� Rebecca shrieked in pure agony at
his move; moving onto her toes as best she could until he lowered his wrist
again.� 

&nbsp;

Satisfied that he'd pulled her out
of whatever fugue world she'd been trying to hide in, the kid standing by her
head pulled the towel gag out and stuffed his stiff cock into Rebecca's
mouth.� I winced as I watched.� I hadn't known this was going on at the time;
the last thing I needed was to have her bite one of these kid's dick off.� The EMT's wouldn't have been too
understanding.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

And then, somehow, it got worse as I was reduced to the
final level of hell.� One of them told me
what he would do to me if I didn't blow him.�
And he proved it when the Black One hurt my insides terribly with one
ripping, tearing, lifting motion.� And
for the second time that evening, I began to suck that young man off.� The two of them eventually got into a
synchronized, heaving motion which allowed them both to obtain everything they
wanted. I gagged as the one at my head drove into my mouth, then tried not to
cry out as the other one drove his clenched fist further into my rear.� Every part of my body felt like it was being
driven in different directions, pushed here, driven there and ripped
everywhere.� I gagged and coughed again
as he drove into my mouth up to his balls.�
I couldn't breathe!� Suddenly,
horribly, I felt another one of them begin touching my clitoris, manipulating
me in an attempt to make me enjoy this!�
The Black One was tireless, seeming to go forever, when suddenly, I
sensed that he now filled me twice over; he had made his hand into a fist.� 

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I'd lost count; for the second time
or perhaps the thirtieth time that evening she was forced to begin sucking a
man's hard dick.� I could tell it was
difficult for her to synchronize her motions.�
Even as her head bobbed up and down as she was forced to bury the
willing member in her mouth, her ass and hips were forced to move in a
different direction by the anal fist-fuck that was slowly, but inexorably exploring
new rectal territory with each move of the black kid's forearm.� Rebecca coughed and gagged as the hard cock
banged against the back of her throat.�
But no matter what she did with her head, every thrust into her ass
almost forced her hips and belly up onto the desk, making her swallow the boy's
cock almost to the base each time.� Her
eyes were closed and spittle drooled from her lips and chin as she sucked and
ate the boy's meat. 

&nbsp;

They watched as her tormentor
controlled her body completely; his every move making her flinch and buck and
cry out in soft gargling moans.� Finally,
he laughed as he rotated his fist inside her rectum.� Luckily, the kid fucking her mouth knew enough
to pull his cock out as my beautiful little slave immediately began screaming
and shrieking in her agony.� Her voice
was mostly gone now and the look on her face was one of total desperation; the
arrogance and conceit were long gone; in fact, little of anything human was
left anymore.� This was a woman who knew
she was trapped in her own personal hell and anything or anyone who could save
her was long gone.� 

&nbsp;

She had been degraded in front of
all of these young men.� It was clear to
everyone in the room that she belonged to them for the night.� And all she felt now was the driving,
humiliating desire to cooperate with her anal rapist in an attempt to get it
over with as quickly as possible without any additional pain or damage.� Finally, it was clear from the video that the
kid controlled the inside of Rebecca's world completely, pumping his elbow back
and forth in long thrusts that always ended with his forearm buried inside her
pelvis and the front of her thighs shoved up hard against the edge of the
desk.� 

&nbsp;

I could tell that she was so hot and
tight around his hand that he was totally lost in the moment.� Rebecca's body jerked and shook as nerves
misfired and full-body spasms swept her, but the black kid didn't care.� He was only aware of her anal sphincter as it
continued to spasm, giving him that amazing compression around his wrist and
hand. When he had finally achieved everything he'd ever dreamed of with a white
woman of her class, the kid began to withdraw his hand, giving her only partial
relief as he eased it out; allowing her to think that she had succeeded in
expelling him from her body.� And as he
withdrew his hand from her anus, Rebecca gave one final scream of pain as it
passed her torn and throbbing rim.� Her
gaping, sloppy anus had been stretched so much that it remained open even after
the kid's hand was gone.� I looked
closely at her rim in the video in concern because she MY ass-candy, and I
didn't want some half-assed kid fucking her up too much.� I'd check her out in the morning, but I
thought she was okay.

&nbsp;

The video was almost finished.� At the other end, the boy's cock fell out of
her mouth as her torn but supple anus finally begin to recover a little from
being stretched so hideously.� Pinned as
she was, Rebecca couldn't stop the boy from stuffing his cock back in her mouth
one last time, then she choked on his cum as the last of them came deep in her
mouth.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

Finally, I felt the monster at my rear slowly begin to
withdraw his hand.� Even though my pussy
ached from everything that they'd done to me, every inch of progress that he
made as he withdrew seemed to bring me little by little back into the world
that I so hated right now.� But now my
world existed of a close, tiny room I loathed and everything seemed centered
around my hips and pelvis and rear end; the terrible aching and throbbing there
always threatening to totally overwhelm me, leave me paralyzed with the
pain.� Finally, I felt him withdraw his
hand slowly from between my cheeks, but even so the pain still increased to a
crescendo of torment as his hand withdrew past my anal rim.� 

&nbsp;

It took a moment to realize I was empty, then the muscles of
my anus flexed once, then spasmed again and again in response to the hollow,
unfilled feeling of having been left barren of him.� At the same time, I couldn't stop myself from
choking as the boy at my head drove his erection into my mouth one last time
before he began to shoot his cum down the back of my throat.� 

&nbsp;

They were done with me I thought dully, at least for
tonight.� I knew doors had shut in my
mind, sealing off emotions and allowing me to focus only on surviving this
agony and humiliation.� Some bloodless,
disconnected part inside me realized that it was over now, and knobs and dials
were turned inside, ensuring that I somehow continued breathing and moving.� They pulled on my hair until I stood swaying,
barely able to make my hips work, then dragged me stumbling over to a cheap,
plastic chair.� I sat, but I was
lost.� I was confused and totally lost
and nothing made sense anymore; I truly felt helpless.� I was trapped in a woman's weak body; I felt insignificant
and totally ashamed of what I was for the first time in my life.� One last humiliation: I remembered later that
the Black One threw a crumpled ball of money on my lap, paying me for my
services.� 

&nbsp;

I was dazed, completely soaked in my own sweat, exhausted as
never before.� My insides felt terribly
cold, as if I were freezing.� I ached
everywhere and felt diminished, shrunken as a human being for having finally
accepted a punishment suitable for my enormous pride---I had been given what I
deserved.� I somehow sat on the chair in
that terrible room and knew in my mind that it would never end for me now, and
that it would never change.� In their
minds, I would forever be their possession, their slut-whore; for the rest of
their lives, they would brag to their friends about the prostitute they'd
gang-banged and fist-fucked in the ass one night.� I would forever be that whore to them, and
nothing would change for me.� Not for
me.� I hurt all over, and I deserved
it---I was so worthless.� 

&nbsp;

I was covered by the bodily fluids from more a dozen young
men, and I had swallowed more than I wore.�
To even leave this place, I would be forced to openly brandish my
humiliations to the world; the slutty dress and shoes of a whore who'd �been
asking for it,� breast piercings and leash, a slave collar, and a brand.� My freedom had been taken from me and my
flesh had been pierced for the pleasure of men like these.� It was like I starred in a terrible,
simplistic erotic film; something that would be an insult to the rational adult
mind, but yet was irresistibly compelling to the young men in this room. 

&nbsp;

And at the same time, if I could only be honest with myself
for once, what had happened here was calling up too an echo inside me that I
didn�t want to admit was there.� I'd been
treated in a totally humiliating and degrading way, and yet primitive parts of
me had responded eagerly.� I knew now
that I was doomed to live this life forever, repeating this scene time after
time for men's pleasure---or until one of them got tired of me and sold me into
a life that could only be worse.� I
suddenly felt an overwhelming sense of fatigue.�
All I wanted to do was go back and lay down on the small bed he allowed
me.� I wanted to sleep forever.� Perhaps if I could, it would all have been an
ugly, horrible dream and it would all be over when I next awoke.� 

&nbsp;

Maybe if I obeyed him perfectly---if I was the best slave
possible, my Master wouldn't allow them to hurt me so much?� I needed this assurance; I wanted to believe
this so badly.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I could testify that Rebecca�s breasts and nipples stayed engorged
and hard for at least another thirty minutes after the boys had finished with
her.� You know, like one of those
commercials that warned men about having erections for over three or four
hours?� Well, her tits were the same
thing.� And from the way she acted as I
led her out to the car, they must�ve hurt like hell, certainly too much to have
the torn fabric of her dress rubbing against them.

&nbsp;

But I still had one problem.�
She had talked too much in the manager�s office when the gang-bang
started; she'd showed little discipline and regardless of what a great piece of
ass Rebecca had turned out to be by the end of the night, she still needed to
be punished for her unacceptable behavior at the beginning.� I looked back in on her one last time and saw
that she was still rocking back and forth on her bed.� She got up to go to the toilet, then
continued that almost hypnotic rocking for another half hour before
finally going to sleep.� 

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I undressed slowly, as I tried to
support my aching breasts and cramping stomach with both hands.� I hurt everywhere; from the bites on my neck
and stomach and thighs, to my breasts and nipples, from my rectum to my pussy---especially
my rear.� I threw away everything I'd
worn; I never wanted to be reminded of this night again.� Finally, I gathered enough strength to
stagger over to the shower.� I hurt
everywhere, but especially in my rear-end. My rectum continually ached and
throbbed and leaked; the muscles had been stretched too far and wouldn't close
at first.� It was a long shower, but
nothing would ever be able to wash away the things that'd been done to me
tonight, what I had willingly accepted tonight.�
Finally, I got out and after I'd dried off a little, I staggered to
bed.� 

&nbsp;

Finally it came out.� I started crying.� I just couldn't stop it.� My throat ached from being bruised by their
oral rapes, and my sobbing just made it worse.�
But I couldn't stop.

&nbsp;

They'd hurt me
a lot; and as stupid as it sounds, I tried at first to pretend it hadn't
happened.� My mind was empty, still, but
something vital had shriveled up and died.�
I would survive physically, if I could just
ignore what had been done to my mind.�
But I quickly realized that something was definitely wrong.� I felt what seemed an almost electric shock
of pain/awareness travel from someplace deep in my skull, into my brain stem
and then down my spinal cord, where the agony dissipated into the tissues of my
buttocks as if my backbone were a lightning rod buried in loamy soil. 

&nbsp;

My head felt It was like an
enormous storm had hit me while the sun was still shining, and then I felt this
tremendous pressure on my chest, like an elephant was sitting on me.� All I could feel were the thick, black clouds
that had rolled in and overwhelmed my subconscious---and the never-ending
pressure.� Where before, I had finally
begun to be able to somehow accept the �inevitability� of my new life, now I
suddenly began to feel like I had to escape.�
Not escape, like I wanted out of the room; escape like kick down the
door and run because the whole house was on fire and I would die if I
didn't.� 

&nbsp;

I found myself absently
rocking back and forth as I lay on my side.�
I took my pulse, it was 120.� Was
it possible to have a heart attack when you felt so empty inside?� I could feel my heart beating in my
head.� I started to gnash my teeth; I
wanted to kill him.� I'd kill him for
what he'd allowed them to do to me.� I
wanted to kill all of them.� But my
homicidal intentions were overtaken by the sudden realization that I was about
to vomit.� I closed my eyes to pray.� I prayed that I wouldn't die as a captive
slave choking on my own vomit while having a heart attack.� My heart felt like a volcano ready to
erupt.� I was going to die; there was no
doubt about it, I was going to die in this God-forsaken room.

&nbsp;

I lay on my bed taking deep
breaths, when suddenly I was overwhelmed by a fear that I had to go to the
bathroom.� My next thought was to stagger
to the toilet in the corner, running as fast as I could, so I did.� But I could barely move.� Everything I did hurt.� Every part of my body that I used for this
had been used by them too.� When I was
finished, I went back to my bed and lay down.�
After a minute, I took my pulse and it had sky-rocketed to 200.� I didn't care anymore; i knew I deserved to
die.� But something inside wouldn't
quit.� I tried deep breathing to slow my
heart rated down.� I did that until I
jumped up from the bed and ran to the toilet where I vomited for what seemed
almost an hour.� 

&nbsp;

I felt an immense weariness
come sliding down from the night sky, and my bed tilted away from me.� I closed my eyes and drifted off to something
that wasn't exactly sleep, but came equipped with with all of the disadvantages.� An hour later, I found I was rocking myself
like a small baby, and finally, I was able to sleep a little that night.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I went to bed and fell asleep almost
immediately.� I woke early the next
morning and went into the study to check the camera monitors.� Surprisingly.....or not, she was still
asleep.� I knew that last night had been
a little tough, so I let her sleep.�
About 10 AM, I walked into the room and over to her bed.� The raped woman somehow sensed my presence
and opened her eyes, but didn't move.� She
seemed still in a stupor.� I continued
looking at her expectantly, and suddenly she realized where she was, what she
was doing, what she was.� Rebecca leaped
out of bed and stood in front of me in the submissive position.� I walked around her, inspecting her like one
would a car that you'd loaned out to a friend.�


&nbsp;

I looked her up and down; long
tousled hair and sleepy blue eyes above the long graceful neck that had bites
on one side, her firm, beautiful tits still perfectly set off by the nipple
rings that pierced her breasts; the nipples looking normal now, even if a
little sensitive.� Her flat stomach and
naked vagina, both covered with bites.�
Her perfectly formed buttocks and lower back still marked with bruises
from last night and the last time I'd been forced to give her a punishment
spanking.� Her long shapely legs, lightly
bruised on the back; another grouping of bite marks high on the insides of her
thighs where the boys had marked their territory.� I grabbed her right hand and looked closely
at her wrist; I could barely see the faint marks of bruises almost healed.� My little puppy was a beauty.

&nbsp;

In her haste, she'd moved too
quickly.� Now she was paying the price
for not being more careful and her face began to take on a grayish tone as she
tried to stand motionless in front of me with her legs spread shoulder's width
apart, eyes on the floor and hands in the small of her back.� I watched her sway and waited for a moment,
then asked if she was feeling okay.�
Rebecca didn't reply immediately, but finally mumbled something that was
impossible to understand.� I told her to
repeat herself and she did, but her comments were still slurred.� It sounded several octaves lower than
normal---I think they'd bruised her vocal chords last night.

&nbsp;

&quot;How's your ass,&quot; I asked
brazenly and without apparent sympathy.�
She looked up at me quickly, then lowered her eyes again to hide the
sparkle of unshed tears there.� She'd
aged some in her face---but I preferred to think of it as having gained
character through experience.� What she'd
undergone last night had made her a different woman.� 

&nbsp;

Caucasian and Asian, Hispanic and
Negro and every ethnic type in between---women of every geographical nook and
cranny had experienced it sometime in their history.� She had the look now in her eyes that women
of the Mediterranean had when the Persians raided east.� The look that would have been familiar to
Mayan villagers, and to eastern European woman when the raiders came down from
the steppes.� And later, this look
inhabited the eyes of Russian women when the Germans invaded, and German women
wore it when the Russians retaliated.�
The same look that had recently been on the face of the women of
Kosovo.� 

&nbsp;

It was the look of a woman that
realized for the first time that ideas of law and equality of the sexes were
concepts forced upon a civilization.� The
realization that people didn't really change their character no matter how
civilized they appeared on the surface, and that beneath the urbane,
sophisticated exterior there lurked the animal that would always believe that
might makes right.� That most men in
their hearts look upon every woman as a potential possession.� That brute force can almost always overwhelm
innocence.� And in the absence of all
else, it will.� 

&nbsp;

I'd broken people for a living and
was familiar with the look.� I'm not sure
how I felt about this in my personal life for it meant I'd definitely succeeded
with Rebecca.� She was a slave now, body
and soul, and the tools that would keep a woman like her enslaved were the
discipline of pain and unending personal degradation.� She'd finally realized that it would never
end, she would never be free of being humiliated or degraded for my
pleasure.� But she'd also come to
understand that she could minimize this by submitting to my every desire as
best she could.

&nbsp;

&quot;Not very good, Master.&quot;
she replied to my question.� The Master
at the end was noticeable for the easy way in which it came out---she'd finally
begun to internalize the language of a love slave, the language of a woman
owned by a man.� But I could tell at a
glance that I'd been right about last night; unsurprisingly, she was different
from before---the light in her eyes seemed gone.� We all live our lives on a ledge, and it
takes surprisingly little to push most of us off.� As bad as most people might think last night
would have been for her, she'd suffered far more change than most would
realize.� 

&nbsp;

Emotionally and psychologically, the
monkey brain inside the organism had been forced to shut down before the boys
had finished just to maintain her sanity.�
What made her her, whatever
internal operating system it was that made her Rebecca was fragmented now, shut
down, and it hadn't really yet re-booted.�
And now, it had finally hit her with the force of a Mack truck; that I
could do anything I wanted and she would never be free of me or what I demanded
of her, until I specifically set her free.�
This was a massively heavy burden for a young woman of modern
temperament to bear.� She feared me now,
respected my power over her to the very deepest fibers of her being, and I was
sure she was resigned to being my sex slave forever.� Oh my, the beauty and the wondrous
malleability of the human mind. 

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I hadn't been asleep when he came in
this morning, I hadn't been able to sleep most of the night.� When he entered, I was laying with my back to
the camera, not moving.� I was done
crying for now.� My thoughts kept
returning to last night, what he'd done to me in the bathroom and what he'd
allowed to be done to me afterwards.� In
particular, my thoughts came back again and again to the unending nightmare on
the small, metal desk in that room.�
Thankfully, most of the night was a blur, my memory reduced to a sense
of little beyond pain, sometimes dim, sometimes agonizing.� But even so I remembered far too much, and
they kept re-playing in my mind, over and over again.� And those memories of the pain made me
shudder, still.

&nbsp;

My thoughts kept going around and
around.� So many things were going
through my mind now.� A slave, a coerced
woman like me went through so many transformative changes before she finally
accepted her fate.� I accepted my
Master's violence now and the violence of others like him without protest---I
deserved no less.� Even as I did this, I
was aware that silently accepting what he continued to do to me was the sign of
a profoundly molested psyche.� But
nothing mattered anymore, and my mind still continued to race on and on.

&nbsp;

There was disbelief; I had an
incredibly hard time believing his attacks had taken place as my memory
insisted they had; it had begun at the end to play tricks with me.� I thought about he and I, and how fear was
just one of his tools.� I lived every day
now in fear, fear that he would return---or that he would not return.� Sometimes, oftentimes in fact, he was
charming and full of insights.� But there
were times when nothing I did was good enough.�
He beat me and hurt me then, when the headaches wouldn't go away, and there
was literally nothing I could do except try to endure---wondering when and
where the next attack would occur.

&nbsp;

It became easier and easier to find
ways to blame myself for what he did.� It
was my fault I wasn't smarter, hadn't been able to learn quicker, hadn't been
more pleasing physically.� Perhaps if I
just tried harder.� 

&nbsp;

I always felt humiliated, shamed by
the dirty things that must be inside me and which had led him to abuse me; the
things that allowed him, that made him want to possess a worthless female like
me.� Sometimes, I felt the need to just
scream, I needed to talk so badly about these things that must be inside
me.� But I absolutely could not at the
time discuss anything with him---for I was insignificant, a body to be used and
mind to be trained.� I'd survived his
training so far, and I knew from personal experience now that survivors were
not bold people.� This extended not only
to what he sometimes did to me, but also to my future under his dominion---how
could I be optimistic about my life ahead?�
Survivors are not bold, they are beaten people.� 

&nbsp;

I'd first thought anger against him
would be healthy, that it would help me.�
But more and more often lately, the anger turned within.� Everything I saw now was filtered through my
reality and became personal, hateful, mean and spiteful.� I hated myself and what he'd done to me; I
couldn't think anymore without character assassination.� And this wasn't me.

&nbsp;

I was powerless against him and no
longer even pretended to fight these feelings anymore.� I knew, I absolutely knew that things would
not get better, at least not for the likes of me.� As I lay there, I tried to list the things
that ruled my life now.� And whether it
was his fault or mine, I was the one that would forever adapt to his needs.� 

&nbsp;

Pessimism was the flavor of the day,
the only flavor now.� His habits, the
traits and character of my abuser were well known to me now.� I knew them as intimately as I had finally
begun to know my own.� But recognition
did not mean power to resist him and what he did to me.

&nbsp;

Denial.� He denied that he ever abused me, claiming rather
that he had taken the responsibility of protecting and caring for me.� He gave me, he claimed, only what I had not
known I wanted.

&nbsp;

Domination.� He always expected submission on the part of
his women, and I cooperated in this as best I could.

&nbsp;

Discipline.� I cried and I screamed in pain, but he always
saw something different in me, in my responses.�
He was unable to understand or recognize that men like him were the
problem, he couldn't admit that he might have a problem.� And until he'd done that, he wouldn't be able
to accept responsibility for his women, or what he did to them.� But my rationalizations about who was to
blame here never helped me, only my ability to handle his pain allowed me to
survive.

&nbsp;

Guilt.� He was a master manipulator, a born psychologist.� He wanted me to feel the guilt for what had
happened to me; somehow he instinctively knew how to make the victim in this
feel her own layers of guilt and shame.��


&nbsp;

Finally, believe it or not, he
presented himself as the victim when I'd somehow� failed him and we both knew he'd have to
punish me.� I failed him all the time,
for he ensured this.� And he said it hurt
him inside when he had to respond to my having earned additional beatings,
additional punishments.� I knew that men
like him have annihilated every woman ever with them, and that was my fate
too.� I was sure of it, and I'd finally
accepted it.� The total time my Master
took with a woman may have lasted only a month or extended over a period of
years, but once he was ascendant, women like me disappeared and became
eventually extinct.

&nbsp;

My enemy was not him, rather it was
that of my duality, that I professed one set of beliefs, yet lived
another.� I hated myself because I'd been
mentally molested and abused; but I knew I'd deserved it somehow.� I knew I'd responded to his abuse just as a
sexually abused child or rape victim would respond.� But intellectually it didn't matter, I felt
this terrible sense of self-loathing---I hated myself because I had been
molested.� He'd only responded to my
situation.� It was clear now that I had
somehow sealed my fate by the way I acted towards him, by the things I'd done
and the life I'd lived before him.� 

&nbsp;

I needed to learn more about this
man, educate myself on his forms of force and persuasion.� I knew there no such thing as him having only
a part of my life, and I knew that I could not just be a part of what he
did.� It was all or nothing now.� It was logically impossible to view our
actions any other way, for the evidence was exquisitely clear all over my body.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I hurt everywhere when I woke up
early this morning.� My mind was
numb---it felt like the inside of a decrepit whorehouse, and the insides of my
skull were the walls on which had been painted some of the most horrible and
bestial acts a man could do to a woman.�
I was tainted now, irredeemable.�
I believed this to the depths of my soul; I knew I was beyond even the
most basic level of redemption.� These
feelings had been building inside me during the last weeks, never consciously,
but always in the background.� Always
slowly increasing in frantic intensity until it had become a chore to just
breathe, a task for my heart to just continue beating; and now with last night,
they had been fully realized.� My body
had been the scene of what would have been a terrible crime in my previous
life; and while I knew deep inside my soul that none of it had been my fault,
the feelings of shame---of somehow sharing with them responsibility for last
night had become almost inescapable.� 

&nbsp;

I had no one to blame but myself,
and that thought led this morning to a feeling of contempt for my body and its
weaknesses.� Even though I had survived
last night, the scorn I now felt towards my body and all the weaknesses it possessed
made me feel that I somehow warranted what they'd done to me.� After all, I rationalized, if someone feels
as dirty or as bad as I did, they should expect people to treat them that way. 

&nbsp;

My old reality had fallen
to pieces about me.� In my previous life,
there had been certain �rules� that I'd used to create a predictable
world.� These had been the things that I'd believed to be true based on my
experiences; that the world was relatively safe, that sex would be pleasurable
if it was by my choice, that I was in control of my environment and the men
that I allowed in.� None of these beliefs
could possible be true now; my innermost being had been under continual assault
over the last weeks and had been changed to the very core.� I felt a vague need to entirely disconnect
from my body.� Without that connection, I
would no longer have to listen to the internal states which had always in the
past helped me navigate, however poorly, through the outside world.� These internal guides were so out of touch
with my new existence, I just felt totally lost.

&nbsp;

Finally, because of my powerlessness
and general unworthiness, I knew that even if suddenly set free, I could no
longer go back and live my life as �normal.��
Things had gone too far; I had learned to need the support of the only
other person that now allowed himself in my life.� And this thought terrified me.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

�Just be aware,� I said as I looked
at her without pity, �giving me what I want now will spare you the
less.....delicate.....intrusions of the boys again later should you
continue your stupid little games.� All
we're doing now is hastening the inevitable.��


&nbsp;

I stopped and thought for a
second.� Hastening the inevitable,
I repeated to myself, mostly because I wanted to see how the words felt.� That is what she was doing, hastening the
inevitable.� I liked the words and
they felt right in my mouth.� Rich,
luscious.� Perfectly describing Rebecca's
self-destructive tendencies. 

&nbsp;

�That your dress from last
night?�� I asked, pointing towards the
door by which I'd just entered.

&nbsp;

��Yes, Master.�

&nbsp;

�Bring all of it to me,� I
ordered.� Without a word, Rebecca slowly
limped over to the sodden dress and heels she'd wadded up and left thrown by
the door, picked it all up and returned to me.�


&nbsp;

�Put it on the bed.�

&nbsp;

She laid the nasty mess next to me
on her mattress.� I continued setting the
scene, �Pick up your stockings and show them to me.�

&nbsp;

With her face blank at first,
Rebecca slowly sorted through the dress and heels and picked up both
stockings.� Only after she'd held them
and could see that both had runs in them did her face take on a concerned
look.� 

&nbsp;

�How many times have you worn that
pair of stockings?� I asked softly.

&nbsp;

Her beautiful blue eyes filling with
tears, she replied, �Once, master.�

&nbsp;

�And what happens when you put runs
in new stockings?�

&nbsp;

I could actually hear her swallow,
�I'm punished, Master.�

&nbsp;

She hesitated for a second, then
began pleading.� �Please, Master.� Not after last night.� For the sake of God, Master.� Not this.�

&nbsp;

I got up and walked toward the
equipment corner.� At the same time, I
said over my shoulder, �Lean over the end of the bed.� You know the position.�� When I had the belt in my hand and turned to
face her, Rebecca faced me with tears running down her face.� Without saying a word, she turned and
silently draped herself over the bed and then raised her ravaged ass into the
air.� She'd become a very obedient little
puppy now.

&nbsp;

After giving her a light spanking, I
ordered her to prepare for her work-out and she slowly moved to where she
stored the few personal things I allowed.�
I watched Rebecca prepare her face and put her hair in a pony tail.� I could see that almost every move brought a
grimace of pain, many from where I knew she did not expect to be hurting.� I watched as she put on the single skimpy
halter that I allowed her during exercise time, then began to climb on the
exercise bike.� When she first attempted
to sit down, she had to stop for a minute and gather her courage.� I have no idea of how it must have felt,
trying to sit down on a narrow bike seat when a man had driven his fist all the
way up your ass the night before.� But if
Rebecca was any example, it must have been a rather unique and terribly
uncomfortable situation.� Finally, she
was able to sit down and began to slowly exercise.� I walked out and watched the camera monitor
intermittently to ensure that she completed her workout.� Afterwards, she showered and began to clean
up her little space.� 

&nbsp;

I walked in with a light meal and
watched her eat.� At the end, I ordered
her to stretch her muscles for at least half an hour.� When finished, she was still in obvious pain,
but at least now could move a little easier.�
I left her alone for the rest of the day; she'd earned a little privacy,
but that was coming to an end.� It was
raining out and a cold snap had taken over the southeastern coast.� I walked back in and she popped into her
position.� I looked at her for a minute
and realized that I hadn�t yet told her to put the nose ring back in.� After waiting for a second, I told her to
dress up for me.� I could literally see
her face crumble even as I watched.� I'm
sure she was still in great pain from last night and the last thing my
beautiful enslaved woman wanted was to be touched in any way by a man, but she
was approaching the end of her training and I couldn't stop now.� I didn't really want her right now, but
couldn't afford to let her know that either.�
Call it a test if you will.� 

&nbsp;

�Please, Master.� Please.��
She just looked at me for a second, and it dragged on for fifteen or
twenty seconds.� In her face, I could
finally see Rebecca give up on the hope of seeing any mercy from her
Master.� Tears streaming down her cheeks,
she obediently walked over to where I allowed her to keep a few pieces of
lingerie.� Rebecca picked out a chemise
and after putting it around her waist, she slowly began to fasten it.� But she had trouble because her fingers were
shaking so hard.

&nbsp;

I waited for a minute and finally
said, &quot;Oh for Christ's sake, forget it.&quot;� I walked out of the room and came back in
about a minute later.� I threw a pair of
French cut shorts and a halter top at her and said, &quot;Put these on and I'll
be back in a little while.&quot;� I left
without waiting for her response.

&nbsp;

I didn't really feel like having sex
right now, at least not with her.� The
way she was right now, dominating this slave was pretty much on the same level
as taking candy from a baby.� It required
no imagination or finesse at all.� 

&nbsp;

Last night I'd offered up her
sexuality to the rapacious god of male need; the masculine impulse to dominate
and subjugate and finally destroy that which was more than could be taken and
held for the moment.� The alter upon
which I'd sacrificed her femininity had first been the cold artificial rock of
the men's bathroom; standing on one foot in a drying pool of water on the
floor, humiliatingly positioned on the synthetic stone between dirty sinks to
satisfy my needs.� Next, I'd allowed
her to experience the horrors of an old, worn out desk top in the cheesy
manager's office.� She'd been broken
there, no longer capable of assuming that there existed any levels beyond which
she would not be forced to journey.

&nbsp;

But there were still a few remaining
things to which she needed to be subjected; things that would give me the final
leverage I had to have.� She still
needed� more suffering, needed to suffer
so badly that it would trump her terrible experiences from last night.� But this next had to be journey of the mind,
not the body.� Although it had fucked her
head up, last night had been the physical, tonight she would be taking the real
mental ride.� Tonight I would break her
on the iron-hard and unforgiving anvil of psychological guilt; tonight I would
ensure she mentally underwent the torment of the damned.� 

&nbsp;

My plan required another unwilling
woman, and there was the chance that Rebecca would forever look upon me
afterwards only with horror.� I'd risk
it.� What I had to do, I did without
great pleasure.� Like Nixon said many
years ago, if you want people to think you're a madman, you have to start doing
mad things.� In which case, you might as
well be mad.� What was the difference at
that point?

&nbsp;

Chapter 29: No woman needs intercourse; few women escape it; Andrea Dworkin

&nbsp;

I drove my old cream-colored Toyota
and finally picked as a target area a quick-food chain that was about forty
miles from my place.� It was dark and I
parked across the street to watch it for awhile.� I only left my car long enough to cover my
license plates with mud so that no one could ID me and to cover the passenger
seat in a heavy piece of plastic.� The
rain was cold and constant; it was a miserable night.� And soon it would get worse, much worse for
some lucky little lady.� Finally, I saw
my date for tonight running into the chicken place.� She picked herself actually, because she was
a good looking, long-haired brunette wearing a short jacket over a dark
knee-length dress, dark pantyhose and heels; at between 18 and 20 years old,
she was probably a low-level clerk or receptionist somewhere.� She certainly wasn't going to college dressed
like that.� The young woman was perfect;
old enough to handle my needs, but too young to be truly hard and cynical.� Using her to get to Rebecca was like making a
bank shot in pool; you used an innocent object in which you have no real
interest to fucking hammer the real target.�
The silly little bitch was alone, impatient to eat and as a consequence,
acted rather stupidly; she�d parked her car in a poorly lit area that had an
open space next to it.� She had
absolutely no situational awareness at all.

&nbsp;

I walked in and took a quick look to
make sure of my choice after I'd parked next to her car in the restaurant's
parking lot.� She had a nice smile and
expressive brown eyes that set off the slightly curly mahogany colored hair
that fell to her shoulders.� Hers was not
a beautiful face, but it was a pretty face, with cheekbones that looked like
honey-covered chisels and luscious lips set off by light pink lipstick.� She was tall at perhaps 5' 8�, and the
tightly buttoned coat emphasized her neat figure.� She had slender, shapely ankles and from what
I could see, she had great legs beneath the dress.� She would definitely do.� 

&nbsp;

I tugged my baseball cap down over
my eyes to cover my face from the security camera, put my gloves on and stood
in line to her right.� Her order took
longer than mine and I was waiting inside near a trash can by the exit when she
walked out holding the bag over her head.�
I walked out after her and when she was a few feet a way from our cars,
I shouted for her to hold up.� I ran
through the light rain with a smile on my face holding my sack of chicken
sandwiches over my head in my right hand as if to block the rain and a five
dollar bill held in my left, telling her that she had dropped some of her
change.� She hesitantly stopped and
waited by her car door for me to give her the money.� She was smiling her thanks as she let me get
close and only at the end did her smile flicker with a little uncertainty.� My face showing a guileless grin, I handed
her the money.� Just as she finished
thanking me, I pulled my stun gun from the food sack and dropped the young slut
in her tracks.� We were pretty
isolated.� I looked around to ensure that
no one had seen us in the gentle rain.�
Good.� No one was paying attention
to our little tableau.� She was a
surprisingly solid little bitch, but eventually I loaded the immobilized girl
in the front bucket seat of my car.� Then
I picked up her purse and threw it in after her.

&nbsp;

I drove about a block away and
parked where I could watch the fast-food joint.�
If the cops were called, I wanted to know about it.� I'd put her in the front seat and now I got
out and walked around to recline it so that no one could see her.� By the time she was able to move again, I had
her wrists bound behind her back with duct tape and her mouth filled with a
cheap rubber ball and sealed with duct tape.�
Finally, while she lay there motionless in my car seat, I super glued
her eyelids shut.� The first part of the
evening had gone well.� Before I got in
the car, I slid my right hand up the inside of her nylon-covered thigh, then
stroked her from knee to her pussy.� Her
flesh was firm and ripe for the picking, and I could hardly wait to fuck her
brains out.� 

&nbsp;

While I waited, I went through her
purse.� Her name was Anne Marie and she
was nineteen.� She worked as a junior
receptionist at a law firm; she was single, seemed financially frugal with only
one credit card and definitely was available for the evening.� 

&nbsp;

Finally, I cleaned off the license
plates and began the long drive home at a slow, leisurely pace.� Anne Marie groaned a couple of times, but
remained still.� I didn't know if I
appreciated her consideration of the situation or felt a little surprise at her
apparent calm.

&nbsp;

I parked the car in the garage and
walked over to her side of the car.� I opened
the door and after I had unbuckled her seat belt, I grabbed her bicep and
pulled her out.� Anne Marie stood swaying
a little her silent blindness.� I had a
knife nearby in the garage and I used this to begin cutting her clothes
off.� She gave a couple of muffled
screams, but just moaned at the end when I hit her in the stomach to show what
was considered acceptable behavior.� I
soon had her coat off, and this was quickly followed by her dark blue dress.� She stood in front of me wearing only a dark
slip and bra, navy pantyhose and her heels.�


&nbsp;

I cut the shoulder straps of the
slip and pulled it down over her hips, allowing it to puddle around her
ankles.� Her bra lay on the concrete
about thirty seconds later.� She had a
great figure; tiny waist and gorgeous legs and an ass that was tightly packaged
by the nylon of her pantyhose.� But I was
a little disappointed in her tits.� They
sagged a little more than you would expect from a teenager, and she had large
aureoles with the kind of breasts that came to a point without any apparent
nipples.� Somebody needed to buy her a
medium set of implants.� But she'd do in
a pinch.� 

&nbsp;

Anne Marie was making crying sounds
now as I dragged her through my bedroom and into the White Room, but few tears
were able to escape the glue on her eyelids.�
Rebecca leaped to her feet as I entered the room.� The shorts she was wearing were cut so high
that her gorgeous ass cheeks were barely covered.� She took one look at the young girl and her
eyes immediately filled with tears as her right hand flew to her mouth.� Rebecca knew exactly what I had in mind, and
her expression was that of a woman serving a life sentence for a crime she
didn't even understand.� I threw Anne
Marie on Rebecca's bed and quickly tied a rope around her neck and then to the
head of the bed.� 

&nbsp;

�This,� I said to Rebecca, �is your fault.� You played your silly-ass games about being
too sore and now others get to take your place.�
This girl is getting what rightfully belongs to you.� But since you've been 'traumatized,'� and
here I put my fingers up in the little hooks that symbolize a quote, �she gets it instead.� You are SUCH a weak, despicable cunt.� Now help me with her.�

&nbsp;

I walked to the foot of the
bed.� She tried to kick at me, but
couldn't get purchase as I grabbed the pretty young girl's ankles and pulled
hard.� Her body slid down the bed until
the rope was tight around her neck.� I
looked at her feet and the high heels she still wore and felt myself begin to
get hard.� I turned to Rebecca and said, �You hold her ankles, now.�

&nbsp;

My little slave stood frozen.� Tears were streaming down Rebecca's face and
she was sobbing.� Finally, my voice was
as cold as frozen silk when I raised my voice a little for the first time, �Get your fucking, skanky whore's ass over
here and grab her ankles.� NOW!!!�� She began to move towards me as if in a
dream.� Hesitantly, she bent over and
grabbed Anne Marie's ankles and held them as I had.� 

&nbsp;

�Spread her more, further apart, NOW!�� Rebecca jumped at my
voice, then responded blank-faced by doing as I ordered.� 

&nbsp;

Even though unwilling at
first to assist on a conscious level as I destroyed little miss Anne Marie in
front of her, Rebecca had clearly identified me as the dominant in our
relationship.� Although it would horrify
her and she would hotly deny it, in an unconscious way she'd begun exhibiting
some of what she saw as my attributes, but more as a photo-negative; displaying
them in a manner that allowed her to better fit into the new life style I
demanded she enter.� We were pretty much
at the end of her initial training.�
She'd almost completed the transformation from being threatened into
becoming one of those that could make the threats if necessary, or at least
that's how Anne Marie would perceive it.�
To finish my woman's training, I needed to bully and manipulate her into
voluntarily assisting me as I used the teenager.� That would destroy any last defensives she
might have against me.

&nbsp;

This was the last stage in
breaking my new woman down.� By
manipulating various training regimes, I'd been able to use fear as motivation to ensure that she satisfied my �needs.�� But at the same time, over the last month I
had consciously begun changing my behavior towards her.� She didn't know what to
believe about herself anymore.� She didn't
want to believe that she would voluntarily hurt others if ordered to do so, or
that she had the character and value for self of a whore, but the ginger
chemical burns that still rimmed her ass and the memories of what had happened
last night with the boys and how she'd responded had to haunt her.� She was feeling guilt over what the boys had
done to her last night.� And even though
helpless to prevent it, she was still experiencing deep shame over what she was
afraid that she'd allowed to happen and how she'd responded to their
depredations.� The rules of the game
(which I'd written) said I could play the guilt card against her one more time
and let her convince herself that she was a truly worthless human
being.� Once she'd reached the very
bottom this time, I would be the only one to whom she could turn for comfort
and understanding.� 

&nbsp;

And if that didn't work,
then I was done with her.� Fuck her, I'd
put her out on the street again.� Her ass
and pussy and tits had done some excellent heavy lifting last night.� Word would get out to the other Doms, and
when it did, they'd want her ass served up on a platter for them too, sort of a
whore d'oeuvre, if you will.

&nbsp;

So this evening was it for
Rebecca.� Even if it came at the cost of
hurting another, especially if that were the cost, the mental
transformations required should still allow Rebecca to achieve some minimal
feeling of strength and control in an otherwise uncontrollable and humiliating
situation.� In short, she'd probably
never forget that she was a victim too.�
But when the victim felt her only chance for survival was to join with
the aggressor emotionally, as well as physically, anything short of total
cooperation was unlikely.

&nbsp;

This was Rebecca's major
defense mechanism---hell, it would the major psychological defense of ANY woman
in her situation.� I was certain that
based on the last few months of training and what she'd undergone last night,
she now had an unconscious and intuitive understanding of the current situation
with Anne Marie.� She didn't know the
pretty miss Anne, nor would she ever see little miss Marie again.� And as wrong as the act might be, Rebecca
knew instinctively that if she helped me in this, it would give me pleasure and
appease my harder Dominant side.� She had
to be aware, even if only unconsciously, that proving her loyalty to me in this
way would more than likely make her life much easier.� And if she reacted as I thought she
would, when I finally began to show her a little compassion for her obedience,
perhaps some small amount of respect, and even affection, she couldn't help but
feel gratitude and even reflect that affection back to me.� 

&nbsp;

And thus do subjugation and shame,
manipulation and guilt become the progenitors of complicity.

&nbsp;

Anne Marie's legs were spread wide,
her thighs waiting for me to settle in between them.� First I stripped, then I took the knife I'd
used on her clothes out in the garage and climbed on the bed, kneeling between
her thighs.� I pulled out the waist band
of her pantyhose and stuck my left hand inside to cup the divine and mysterious
treasure between her legs, a prize that would shortly be mine exclusively.� She began to struggle and I crooned into my
sweet Anne Marie's ear, �Go ahead.� Keep it up and I'll cut your clit off.� How'd you like to be accidentally
circumcised?� I hear the African women
love it.�� Immediately the teenager
froze as my hand continued to explore her labia and the silky dark crevasses of
her pussy.

&nbsp;

I pushed the nylon out away from her
belly and cut out the crotch of her pantyhose.�
Neither Rebecca nor Anne Marie seemed to notice that I continued the cut
up the crack of her ass further than necessary.�
I glanced at Rebecca and she looked ghastly.� I knew that she must still ache from last
night's gang-rape, but right now she was in much more mental distress than she
was physical.� Exactly where I wanted
her.� But even as her face remained
filled with guilt and self-hatred, I saw her take a fresh grip on Anne Marie's
ankles and pull them a few inches further apart.� 

&nbsp;

Since this was to be a quickie
object lesson for Rebecca, I wouldn't have time to put Anne Marie in the shower
afterwards.� I went back into my bedroom
and left the knife in a drawer.� Then I
grabbed a couple of condoms and went back to my two girls.� I was huge with desire for the teenager and
it was easy to slide the lubricated condom over my steaming meat.� I mounted Anne Marie as Rebecca kept her
spread wide and with one quick move of my hips, buried myself in tight, teenage
heaven.� Anne Marie bucked like a bronco
with a spur under her panties, but it didn't do her any good.� She was mine for as long as I wanted
her.� And I wanted her a lot.� 

&nbsp;

I aggressively fucked her for almost
twenty minutes before I blew my load.� I
rode her high and used friction against her clit.� I rode her low and filled her belly beyond
anything I knew she'd ever felt before.�
I rotated my hips and belly in grinding circles and savage thrusts as I
lay upon her.� She fought Rebecca at
first, but my little slave was too strong for her.� A little screaming and a little moaning, a
few grunts and groans here and there, and then finally cooperative silence from
my new slut.� Eventually, I was done.� I hated not being able to put the cum in her
pussy where it belonged, but I was just using her as mind leverage, to give
Rebecca an object lesson.� I didn't want
to go to prison for something as stupid as leaving traces of DNA.� I lay panting for breath upon Anne Marie's
sweaty belly and chest, then I heard Rebecca's soft sobs.� I looked at her over my shoulder and saw that
she had the teenager's legs spread so wide it looked like they might come out
of the hip sockets.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I had listened to his male grunts and groans of sexual
frenzy seemingly forever as I lay beneath him.�
Now I listened to them as he took another helpless female.� My jaws ached from being clenched so
tightly.� I looked away, at the floor, at
the ceiling, I closed my eyes and prayed; I looked anywhere but at my Master as
he finished raping this poor young girl.�
I couldn't believe that I�d helped him, that I had helped do this thing
to yet another woman.� But at the same
time, this had been done to me so many times.�
I knew that if I could take it, she could too.� Being raped wouldn't kill her.� I knew this for a fact.� 

&nbsp;

Suddenly, I felt an immense weariness, as if the world
rested upon my shoulders.� I wanted to
die.� I knew my first thoughts had just
been attempts to rationalize my guilt.� I
wanted to rush to her and help her.� I
wanted to kill him.� I wanted to cradle
her head in my lap and tell her that this too would pass.� I didn't know what I wanted.� All I knew was that what I had just watched
and assisted was entirely my fault.� I
should have known that my claiming to be in too much pain wouldn't stop
him.� If I hadn't selfishly put him off,
it would have been me lying there and not that poor innocent girl.� God, I hated myself and my selfish
weaknesses.�� 

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

Young Anne Marie lay upon the bed,
crying.� Rebecca had stepped back from
the girl's feet, but she still looked like she was in shock from what she'd
just done.� Suddenly, I knew that I
couldn�t afford to give Rebecca any more time to think; that I needed to finish
this quickly.� I stood up and said, �Help me flip her over.�� My slave hesitated, but when I glared
intently into her eyes, she finally blushed and wiped her tears away as she
bent over to help me.� Rebecca looked and
moved like a zombie, but the important thing was that she still obeyed my
orders.� Together we each grabbed an
ankle and within seconds, Anne Marie was twisted until she had flipped over and
lay flat on her belly with her legs spread wide.� Her pantyhose were full of runs down the
inside of her thighs, but her legs were still spectacular.� 

&nbsp;

I was lucky in that I could
generally get wood up to three times in an hour, and tonight I was on a
roll.� I took one look at my sweet little
captive bitch and was hard for Anne Marie again, only minutes after blowing my
first load.� As I stood by her feet, I
admired again the look of her shoes with the sharp toes pushed into the
mattress and the stiletto heels pointing back at Rebecca.� Hers were the three inch heels that some
working girls wore, and they definitely enhanced her shapely ankles and calves.� At another look from me, my girl grabbed Anne
Marie's ankles again and kept them spread.�
As I slowly walked up towards my new fuck-meat's waist, I slid my left
hand up the nylon-slick back of her right ankle, then her calf.� At the back of her knee, I rotated my wrist
slightly so that my fingers were now on the inside of her knee and my palm
rested on the back of her leg.� I slid my
fingers up the inside of her silky thigh the rest of the way to her now sopping
wet pussy and cupped her there for a minute, then moved on to the cut in the
reinforced panel of blue nylon that went up the crack of her ass.� I needed more room there, so I reached in
with both hands and ripped her pantyhose apart even higher.� Even though the nylon of the pantyhose still
kept her asscheeks firmly captured and tightly compressed, the crack of her
beautiful ass now lay open and unprotected before me.� 

&nbsp;

This time I wanted Rebecca to
appreciate every inch I gave Anne Marie, so I pulled on a fresh, unlubricated
condom.� I wanted Rebecca to understand
that every inch I fed this girl's reluctant ass actually belong to her, that
every centimeter of male need that Anne Marie endured should have been hers
instead.

&nbsp;

I laid down upon the young girl's
back and after I was comfortable, I spread her sweet ass cheeks wide, ready to
nail her.� But the little minx was still
full of fight.� She clenched her
beautifully rounded buttocks together and fought me all the way.� Her beautiful puckered little brown rose-bud
defeated me even as Anne Marie screamed her rage and defiance into the gag that
filled her mouth.� Having had enough of
this shit, I punched her hard just above her right kidney.� The teenager's body arched as she gasped in
pain and shock.� But as I knew she would,
in unthinking reaction Anne Marie also stopped clenching her ass so tightly.� Suddenly, thoroughly, and without doubt, she
was mine.� I drove in almost all the way
to my nutsack in one move of my hips.�
Her whole body arched and bucked in reaction, her muffled screams of
defiance and anger immediately changing to one long drawn-out, continuous wail
of agony and humiliation.� There was
silence for a second at the end as she inhaled loudly through her nose and then
she screamed again.� 

&nbsp;

The human anus is not naturally
lubricated, and what I'd just done had to have hurt like hell.� Rebecca froze, involuntarily fixed by the
sound.� I looked at her over my shoulder
at her and she saw the accusation in my eyes.�
She was continually crying now.�
But there was no guilt in me as the physical sensations from sweet Anne Marie flooded my body.� The thought quickly flickered through my mind
and then was gone.� But it had been
true.� As I lay buried in this young
girl's ass for the first time, I realized that she felt totally unlike
Rebecca.� The two women were so
different.� Rebecca was leaner and had a
more athletic body.� Her ass cheeks were
more well-developed and more muscular; they kept me off of her rim more.� She had a nice full, tight ass that forced me
to use my weight to drive past her hard muscular buttocks to achieve full
penetration.� When she clenched her
buttocks against me, Rebecca almost pushed me out.� She was built for endurance, better able to
withstand the give and take of a long term BDSM affair with one master.� 

&nbsp;

On the other hand, even though they were about the same height,
Anne Marie probably weighed at least twenty pounds more than Rebecca.� Anne Marie was heavier and her body was
lusher, her curves softer and more rounded.�
And while her buttocks may have been encased in pantyhose, her rectum
was much more available.� She was more
open to easy penetration; her rectum just invited a man to totally possess her
with each drive of his hips.� She was
built for a series of one night trysts, being handed off to a different
ass-master each night.� 

&nbsp;

I had reamed out my new slut's ass enough by now that she took me
without continuing to scream.� In fact,
her silence seemed to imply that at some level, she had finally accepted having
a man deeply and brutally buried up to his nutsack in her rectum.� Anne Marie now was where Rebecca had been
weeks ago, but both felt wonderful with my cock sheathed inside them.� Pity I couldn't take this one to the logical
conclusion of our meeting tonight as I would be doing with Rebecca.

&nbsp;

I knew I was hurting the young girl on purpose with an unlubricated
condom.� In consequence, Anne Marie had
at first cried out with almost every thrust I made.� The sensations of her involuntarily clamping
onto me, then letting go, clamping and then releasing, all felt wonderful.� At the same time, her muscles strained
mightily without conscious control to expel what now invaded her rectum, and I
could feel her asshole continually quivering around the base of my cock under
my onslaught.

&nbsp;

After I'd plowed Anne Marie's ass a
couple of more times, I told Rebecca that she could let go of the girl's ankles
now.� I knew the teenager wasn't going
anywhere and with me filling her ass and laying inside of her widely spread
feet, she couldn't close her legs now even if she wanted to.� But she didn't even try, for the fight was
gone from the teenager---all hope of avoiding the outrage was gone.� I felt an atavistic thrill roll down my
spine; I'd turned her into a personalized rag that was specially designed for
my use.� 

&nbsp;

She cried softly beneath me, only
grunting or groaning in pain a few times at first as I continued to plow her
now sore ass with especially deep thrusts.�
She grunted and whimpered louder as I stroked deeper, then screamed into
her gag three or four more times.�� My
goal was to fuck her ass deep enough that it felt to her like I was trying to
ruin her colon with every hard stroke I delivered.� I'd managed to cram every
inch of my dick into her asshole by now and I could tell that it really hurt
whenever I bottomed out inside her colon.�
But Anne Marie was a minx; she still maintained enough
presence of mind to try subtle moves such as adjusting the way her back arched
against me as she was ass fucked.� 

&nbsp;

Suddenly I pulled
completely from her torn and aching rectum and began rubbing the head of my
dick across her butt. Then I plunged back into Anne Marie, ripping through her
tired sphincter and burying my cock even deeper into her colon than before. 

&nbsp;

I was lost in an erotic
haze.� &quot;How was that you fucking
whore?� Was that enough for you, or do
you want it even harder?&quot;� I hadn't planned on taking it this far, but her muffled screams at the end inflamed me to my very marrow and
drove me into almost total sexual madness.�
I drilled her for at least fifteen minutes before I came
again.� Another ass-virgin bites the dust,
I thought to myself as I panted for breath.

&nbsp;

***�


&nbsp;

I lay upon her sweaty back
and enjoyed the sensations of her body involuntarily grasping me, then
releasing as my penis shrunk inside her now sloppy and loosely fitting
rectum.� I'd made a career of ensuring
that the women I took like this remained only as impersonal objects.� It hadn't always been like this with me.� But you changed after the first.� You never took the same breath again, or
dreamed the same dreams again.� Trust
me.� I know.� So, as much as I could, I dehumanized these
women.� Accepting them as human, as
someone just like me, created empathy.�
Empathy made what I was driven to do more difficult and produced regret.....and
dreams.� 

&nbsp;

So I employed tricks�tools
that allowed me to survive.� When
possible, I kept them at an emotional distance.�
I diffused responsibility, making much of what happened to them their
fault for being too stupid or too unobservant, for allowing me to take them
unawares.� I obscured their features; the
hood was not just for their comfort, but allowed me to function without having
another face to remember.� I took them
sexually in ways that allowed me to avoid looking at their faces.� 

&nbsp;

At the same time, how the
women I'd enjoyed like Anne Marie felt before I took them depended much upon
individual circumstances.� I'm sure that
they all felt an all-enveloping fear---but some, perhaps only a very few, may
have very well have wanted to feel that fear.�
To feel it running down their spines and through the very marrow inside
their bones.� There were, after all,
still some women that wanted to be taken by force.� Their heads may have been filled with
feminist twadddle and their hearts thumped, their adrenalin pumped, their
mouths dried and their palms sweated as I led them blindfolded to my lair: but
to these few, I knew that this was an exhilarating sort of fear, not the fear
of a victim.� These women, I think,
experienced what was probably one of the most intensely erotic experiences of
their life.� The strongest desire to be
taken that they had ever felt: a desire that was made only more acute the more
strongly they felt forced to resist it.

&nbsp;

Each of these women may
have felt the need to fight as hard as they could.� But secretly, so deeply buried inside their
modernity and feminism that many could never admit this even to themselves,
some willed me to prevail.� And when I
finally did dominate these particular women, the physical shock always seemed
indescribably, exquisitely pleasurable to us both.� I could immediately tell by the way they
reacted; I somehow always knew.� I've
given a few of these women the opportunity to speak afterwards, and all wanted
to talk to me.� All said they felt as though
I had energized billions of nerve-endings that had been unknown to them before
me.� Some claimed they'd enjoyed the most
intense climax they'd ever had, while others had screamed into their gags like
no woman I'd ever taken had screamed before.�
I'd also noticed that for a few, their whole body would suddenly relax
just like Anne Marie when I fucked her ass, perhaps accepting and submitting,
welcoming, worshiping.� 

&nbsp;

For these few women, it was a mixture of feelings that was both
scary and exhilarating at the same time; it was incredibly important that it
not be something they could have controlled---for them all opportunity for
control must have been stripped away.�
The women who truly desired such an experience did not want to ask for
it or orchestrate it, otherwise the power to move them was lost.� This loss of freedom, of control over their
bodies was the key to the whole experience.�
It had to be authentic; raw, animalistic, scary, forceful,
unpredictable, brutal and hot and sweaty.

&nbsp;

For these women, I'm
convinced that the whole experience left them feeling absolutely ecstatic,
utterly at peace, deeply submissive and totally mine.� These were the natural Subs, and we were now
connected at the most intimate levels.� I
could see in the eyes of these few both reverence and awe, everything combined
in a soft submissiveness that was coupled with deep gratitude, adoration and
belonging.� These few were the ones that
surrendered their modernity, their mystery, their sex---one of the few levers
of influence they had in their public world---and disappeared into my world
without leaving the slightest wave, pulling it on temporarily like a new skin,
fitting in perfectly without any wrinkles.�


&nbsp;

The way these women
accepted their role in my world was almost a Zen sort of thing, and they were
often moved to tears.� But not tears of
shock or horror or anger.�
I had taken them and they were mine; the tears were of acknowledged
temporary ownership.� I always had their
personal information; I sometimes later followed these women's lives after I'd
released them, and with those few of whom I was sure, I contacted them with an
offer they couldn't refuse.� These women
were now willingly enslaved as part of the local BDSM underground. 

&nbsp;

Clearly, little Anne Marie was not
made of this sterner stuff.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

Rebecca was watching me with her
hand over her mouth again and tears streaming down her cheeks.� She was crying in guilt as much as Anne Marie
had from degradation and pain.� After I
had my breath back, I crawled off of Anne Marie's back and stood up.� She still layed on her stomach with her legs
spread wide.� Her asshole was sloppy and
remained a little open, as the anal sphincter spasmed.� It gave her rectum the look of a fish's mouth
as it gaped open, closed, then opened again.�
I'd really drilled her ass tonight.�


&nbsp;

The teenager continued crying softly
even after I reached over and untied the rope from around her neck.� There was no fight left in sweet, young Anne
Marie now.� She'd virtually accepted the
role of providing her body for any entertainment that I might desire
tonight.� Anne Marie's wrists were bound
behind her back with tape, and it was the work of a moment to get rid of the
tape, then handcuff her wrists together and tie them to the head of the
bed.� I forced Rebecca to help me flip
the teenager on her back again and Anne Marie's�
ankles tied tightly as she was quickly spread-eagled on the bed.� 

&nbsp;

Rebecca was pretty fucked-up in the
head right now, but she still wasn't where I wanted her.� With a small smile on my face, I told her,
�Strip.�� She looked at me in shock and total
incomprehension.� Her eyes were red from
crying and they looked like a wild animal's might, as they flipped around the
room, intentionally ignoring the young female body that lay on the bed.� Rebecca just stood there as I walked up and
slapped her hard in the face.� She cried
out softly and rubbed her cheek with her hand.

&nbsp;

�Strip,� I repeated myself.� Within seconds, she stood naked in front of
me.� Rebecca didn't know it yet, but she
was going to be fucking Anne Marie too.�
If I could force her to do this for me, even if it fucked her head up
more than it was now, she'd still be exactly where I wanted her on the
domination/submittal curve.

&nbsp;

A couple of times I'd entertained
more than one woman at a time.� I handed
Rebecca the strap-on that I'd retrieved from the corner; she just looked at it
for about thirty seconds, her shaking hands turning it over and over.� She'd seen them before, but had no idea of
how to put one on.� It was a massive dildo;
as thick as my wrist.� Ten inches long,
it was a silicon copy of the real thing lovingly-made with veins extruded along
the sides and a large helmeted head.�
Finally, there was a ring of short, bristly, hair-like extrusions just
behind the tip.� I don't think that
Rebecca noticed that I had roughened the surface, making several rings of
fairly deep, yet relatively unobtrusive cuts that always slanted towards the
head of this woman-killer.� When it was
driven into a woman's vagina, the cuts laid flat.� When it was pulled out, the flaps covering
the cuts opened and the surface was pulled back, giving the whole thing a
rough, uneven surface with multiple sharp edges.� These little cuts were also a nice delivery
system for whatever I wanted deposited in a woman's pussy.� But tonight, I'd taken a little pity on Anne
Marie and kept them clean.� 

&nbsp;

With shaking hands, Rebecca finally
began to strap the dildo around her waist.�
She stood stock-still for a second, then flinched as I threatened her
with my hand again.� Finally, she crawled
on the bed between Anne Marie's wide spread legs.� The teenager couldn't see, but struggled
weakly when she felt the mattress dip as someone got in bed with her.� The young girl's pussy was still sloppy, but
her labia had begun to dry and tighten up, making entry more difficult.� Rebecca lowered her hips onto Anne Marie's
belly, but kept her upper body off of the teenager's chest as she rested her
weight on her hands.� She looked at me
beseechingly, but I nodded my head silently for her to continue.� 

&nbsp;

Finally, Rebecca's hips made their
first motion towards Anne Marie.� It was
a weak move and didn't achieve much penetration, but the head was so big that
it still forced a scream from deep within the girl's chest as it pushed her
labia apart.� Rebecca pulled back and
slid another tentative thrust into the teenager; Anne Marie screamed into her
gag again.� 

&nbsp;

�Close your eyes and start
pushing.� Thrust with your hips and drive
with your ass.� Now!�� Suddenly, the dildo was half buried in the
helpless teenager and Rebecca reluctantly began a slow, rhythmic motion that
drove the fake sex-meat much deeper into the unprotected belly that lay beneath
her.� The way the strap-on was designed
allowed maneuvering the instrument of torture into positions that men couldn't
assume, and somehow, accidentally, Rebecca soon learned this.� As the forced fucking went on, Rebecca closed
her eyes and at times lost herself in it.�
She did things then that surprised me, and her, before she remembered
where she was and what she was.� 

&nbsp;

But during those few moments of
complete loss of control when she was in the eros zone, she inexplicably
focused on truly hurting the girl that lay beneath her, hammering her
repeatedly in those special places that only another woman knew.� Each of those times, Rebecca managed to
dredge up screams of absolute agony from the teenager as she would find another
one of those super-sensitive areas.� When
combined with the multiple, tiny saw blades that I'd cut into the dildo,
Rebecca didn't realize that with each deep thrust, she was tearing away layer
after layer of sensitive mucous membrane, actually abrading away Anne Marie's
vaginal lining.� The teenager was
bleeding from her vagina within less than a minute of the Rebecca's first major
penetration.� 

&nbsp;

There is a certain pitch of human
scream that is impossible to ignore, a sound that drills directly into the most
primitive part of your brain.� The kind
of sound that makes your hair stand up, your scrotum retract and your feet
freeze dead in their tracks.� That's the
kind of scream that tore loose from Anne Marie as Rebecca sawed away at the
lining of her vagina.� It didn't affect
me, but it was exactly the kind of scream that I wanted Rebecca to hear.� My woman would frantically hammer away at her
victim's pelvis until the girl's helpless, hopeless, continuous screams had
beaten their way past Rebecca's blood rage and she'd regained mental control
again.� 

&nbsp;

That was when Rebecca would suddenly
falter and look at me helplessly with tears in her eyes.� But I was merciless.� And after she'd begun fucking the teenager
again, my slave would eventually lose control and once more begin using her
hips and weight to assist in pumping and driving the piece of abrasive hard
rubber as deep into Anne Marie's ravaged cunt as she could.� 

&nbsp;

Rebecca was clearly unaware of where
she was during these times; her eyes were closed and an almost feral look had
come over her face as she hunched forward, using her hips to drive the
woman-killer deeper and deeper into Anne Marie's body.� I knew I'd discovered a totally unsuspected
side to my little slave.� The bound
teenager showed her appreciation by bucking and make impossible arches with her
body with each deep thrust, and in the continuous muffled screams that were
smothered by the impromptu rubber ball and tape gag.�� 

&nbsp;

Rebecca touched bottom inside the
girl several times with the rigid man-made monstrosity, punching hard against
sweet young Anne Marie's cervix.� Each
time she bottomed out like that, the young girl's hips and belly would
uncontrollably arch towards Rebecca, and her feet would try to fly up.� The teenager's legs would involuntarily
attempt to close, always fighting against the bindings that kept her so open to
this outrage despite the way they strained to come together.� 

&nbsp;

My slave was relentlessly slamming
the massive rod into Anne Marie again when I finally grabbed Rebecca by the
hair and yanked her out of her private world---she was killing the crying
teenager.� Anne Marie was bleeding all
over the bed and the dildo was covered by a thin frothy-pinkish film made of up
vaginal juice, blood and a thick, soft layer of skin and mucous cells that had
been abraded away by the sawing action of the dildo.� Rebecca was panting, on her knees between
Anne Marie's thighs as she looked over at me from under her eyelashes.� Only slowly did the madness leave her eyes
and recognition finally come back. 

&nbsp;

She was where I wanted her now. 

&nbsp;

Rebecca was finally exhausted and I
was afraid that Anne Marie had almost been maimed.� I allowed my panting, sweaty slave to slowly
crawl off of her sobbing victim and stand up.�
She fumbled with the strap-on as she tried to get it off.� Finally, she let it drop to the ground from
nerveless fingers and looked like she wanted to vomit.� Rebecca looked at me with shock in her teary
eyes and I didn't know if she'd ever forgive me for forcing her to do
this.� Frankly, I didn't care at the
moment.� Suddenly, she ran for the small
toilet and I heard retching sounds as she emptied her stomach.

&nbsp;

I untied my victim's ankles and
wrists, then grabbed a handful of the teenager's hair and dragged the young
slut to her feet.� She was a mess between
her thighs, but I was pretty sure she'd be okay.� Rebecca had slowly walked back to us by now,
wiping her mouth on her wrist.� Crying
softly now, Anne Marie swayed on her high heels in her lonely darkness for a
second before finally standing upright.�
Telling Rebecca to help me, I pulled the young girl's heels off and then
stripped off the ruined pantyhose.� There
were red pressure marks from the pantyhose around her waist and the insides of
her thighs were covered with a thin layer of fresh, drying blood.� The front of her pussy was a mess where it
seemed my slave had been trying to cut her pelvis in half with the saw-like
dildo.� Rebecca shuddered and closed her
eyes when she saw this, but I knew that nothing would ever make the vision of
the helpless girl go away.� 

&nbsp;

Oddly, at that moment I noticed that
Anne Marie's toenails were painted an attractive bright red that matched her
fingernails.� Unfortunately, the color
was also close to that which stained her thighs.� I used a clean, wet washcloth to wipe her
down internally and externally before we put the shoes back on her feet.� She was ready to be delivered back to a
slightly used and definitely soiled freedom.

&nbsp;

I looked at Rebecca and said, �Get
dressed while I'm gone.� You know what I
like, so you'd better do it up right or I'll bring the punishment of God down
on your weak ass.�� Anne Marie had been
fucked so hard in her ass and vagina that she could barely walk.� Regardless, I left with the broken young
woman in tow after I had locked Rebecca into the White Room.� 

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I gazed at his back as he left, caught my breath.� He'd taken her and she was gone.� She simply wasn't there anymore.� The bed he'd used was empty and all traces of
the young girl were gone.� Except for the
blood---the blood that I had been responsible for drawing from the young
woman.� This was a nightmare---it had to
be a nightmare.� I was empty inside.� I had
no fight left in me.� He'd won.� Memories of what had happened in the last
hour seemed dim and from long ago.� I
couldn't believe what my mind was trying to tell me that I had done.� I knew it couldn't have been me.� I was tired, so tired.

&nbsp;

I needed to sleep.� But I didn't dare.

&nbsp;

Blood was pounding in my
ears and I felt a physical pressure in my skull.� It finally got so bad, I grabbed the sides of
my head to stop it from exploding.� I was
hyperventilating and my hands were shaking.�
My eyes jerked from side to side as if some part of my autonomic nervous
system had just kicked in and was telling me that I was in mortal danger.� It got harder and harder to breathe, and when
I could, it wasn't any help.� It felt
like I was drowning in a sea of carbon dioxide and there was no oxygen for me
anywhere.� 

&nbsp;

In that moment, it all flew apart for me, the whole rational
system by which I understood the world and my place in it.� The balance of crime by retribution, the
assurance that there was meaning behind everything, that we each control our
destiny, it was all swept away like pieces on a board swept aside by a
boisterous child.� I sank to my
knees.� My spine was bowing, it was as if
some ten-fold gravity were pulling me down.�
Abruptly, it seemed impossible to survive, impossible to explain sexual
slavery and domination to anyone who hadn't experienced it.� Wrapped in the brilliant pain and radiance of
where it took my mind, I breathed the absolute certainty that my grief would
crack me wide open.� How could you convey
to another the ice-aching, diamond-bright reality of those awful moments?� How could I tell that young girl how sorry I
was that I had been the cause of all her pain.�


&nbsp;

He did what he did without guilt, like a force of nature.� And I'd somehow allowed him to drag me down
to his level.� For a moment, only a
moment, I felt a strange sense of freedom as I'd hurt that girl.� I was like Anne Marie, powerless against the
random acts of men, of this man.�
Analysis was pointless, so why waste time thinking about what might
happen?� A shadow vanishing into itself---that
was the sensation.� Release�.� 

&nbsp;

I had been the one with my eyes open, knowing his rules and the
lack of truth of what I'd claimed---I could have taken his pain tonight, but I
hadn't wanted to.� I could have disobeyed
him earlier, but I hadn't.� I'd endured
so much from him for one day, and just hadn't felt strong enough to take
more.� But why had I hurt the girl?� For the first time it seemed, I opened my
eyes now and looked at this man, the man that was my man now.� I closed my eyes and turned my head away, but
I couldn�t stop my understanding.� I
knew, without wanting to, what I had become.�
It was my fault, all my fault.

&nbsp;

One of the worst feelings on earth is that of always being the
vulnerable victim; I knew that this way lay insanity for one such as me.� Ultimately, a normal relationship must please
both involved, not just one.� But our
relationship, his and mine, was not normal and never would be.� And given my life now, it was me that would
have to change.� I knew I was fated to
belong to him, to never leave this gray world of pain, of physical extremes and
emotional degradation again.� And if I
was to reside within his world, I needed someone to protect me from the other
predators that inhabited it.� I needed a
Master to protect me.

&nbsp;

I somehow just KNEW that my Master, the man that currently
possessed me could not be as bad as he seemed; after all, my instincts just
couldn't be that wrong.� I just needed to
get used to the absoluteness of my life---no control, no choice, no safety net
and no way out.� I'd tried my best to
accept his training without letting it control my life or truly change me.� But tonight it felt like I was a beach ball
with a small pinprick hole in it, and bit by bit the air was going out of
me.� And I was sinking down, and soon
would be a very flat little slave.

&nbsp;

I knew I flirted with insanity.� Master had forced me into his world, breaking
me, then lifting me to glorious heights of passion my body could scarcely
contain before dropping my soul to the basest of levels to pay for it; making
me kneel and beg for more and do anything to please him.� His had been a studied manipulation, one
practiced on many women until he was so good at it that the victim wept from
the abuse.� But that didn't stop her from
wanting it.� His manipulations and
depredations could be so brutal that you prayed for death, or so subtle that
they could be mistaken for love.� Yet, I
couldn't believe that I had helped Master rape another woman tonight.� Everything that happened to her was my
fault.� I felt a terrible, almost
biblical guilt in my complicity.� I hated
myself.� Why had I helped him?� Why had I felt compelled to obey his every
order.� Unthinking obedience in a terrible situation.� I felt like a Nazi.� God, why?�
Why?

&nbsp;

Suddenly, as if drenched by
a shower of ice, I felt an almost glacial calm come over me.� I could breathe again.� My subconscious mind had sifted through
everything; the analysis was done.� I
realized I finally knew what I had to do and I was deeply convinced of its
necessity. �I took a deep breath and
wiped the tears from my face.

&nbsp;

I felt terrible pangs of
conscience, I bore total responsibility for what had happened to Anne Marie
tonight.� I had no doubt; I would never
forget this young woman.� I was tormented
by the internal strife that was tearing me apart.� I couldn't further contribute to the wrongs
against her by erasing her presence, refusing to take even the tiniest
obligation for her presence tonight.

&nbsp;

I wasn't a stupid
person.� I've done many stupid and petty
things in my life, but always for selfish reasons.� I've never felt the need to be a martyr,
never felt the need to suffer because of some ridiculous principle or take a
punishment that was by rights due another.�
But tonight had been different.� I
owed this young girl, and somehow I knew I was willing to make the ultimate
sacrifice now---but only if it would make a difference.

&nbsp;

Giving in to my pain and weakness
was why another innocent woman had been raped tonight.� Suddenly, I straightened my shoulders and
wiped the tears from my cheeks.� I had
few real choices.� The police were
looking for me and I had no husband, no home to go to.� The more I thought about it, the more I
realized that I had no choices at all.�
Well, actually, that was wrong.� I
had one choice.� While it was too late to
save myself, I could save others from what'd happened to her.� The more I thought about it, the more I knew
that I was making the right choice.� I
knew that I would do anything for him now.� 

&nbsp;

A dizziness swept over
me.� I had a precipice in front of
me.� Turning back was no longer a
possibility, and to tell the truth, I didn't even want to.� I think I wanted to spend the rest of my life
with this man.� I sighed again; I would
go forward and find a way to cross this chasm in my life.� I felt alone, as if my entire world had
emptied of people, as if my ties with life had unraveled.� My family was gone, but everything fell into
place anyway.� It was so simple now.� 

&nbsp;

I sat motionless, my head
completely empty at the moment.� But
suddenly, I realized that I had done nothing but wait all these weeks.� I hadn't understood it at the time; the fact
that I was waiting or why.� But I had a
mission now, and I didn't need to wait any longer to carry it out.� My old life was dead.� I no longer had any doubt.� And now, there was no turning back.� 

&nbsp;

But I still needed
assurance, emotional sustenance.� I felt
like a hypocrite; the last time I'd prayed on my knees was when I was a little
girl.� But I did it now.� 

&nbsp;

I felt an urgent need to
kneel and pray.� My head sunk between my
shoulders, I covered my face with my�
hands and tried to think.� Please
God, I begged.� Let this be it.� Let me give him everything I am, let him take
everything I've ever been, let him take everything he wants from me---but let
it be me alone that satisfies him.� All I
ask God, is two things.� No more women
for him and no more men for me.� Please
God, please.� No more innocents.

&nbsp;

Let this be it.

&nbsp;

Master had almost killed me with the
highs and the lows as he carefully built within me an addiction to the euphoria of being his slave;
warping my life, mixing it with my need for love and my craving for any
acceptance, even from one such as him.�
Even as I knew I belonged to him and would serve him for as long as he
wanted, I swore that I would never again be responsible for another woman being
ruined by this, or any other man.� I
vowed that I would give him everything that he wanted, whenever he wanted it,
as long as it meant no one else would get hurt.�
I knew that I could take anything he wanted to do to a female's body
better than any woman I'd ever known.� He
called me a pain-slut.� Well, I would be
his pain-slut, if that is what it took to save other women.� I'd be his slut forever if that was what it
took.� And if I couldn't keep him
satisfied, if he tried to hurt more women, then I would try to kill him, then
myself.� I was crying now, but it seemed
as if a weight had been lifted off of my shoulders.� I'd made my mind up and suddenly everything
seemed clearer.� I could finally breathe
without that crushing, suffocating feeling of panic.� 

&nbsp;

My face was red and blotchy from crying, so I ran cold water
in the sink and washed my face for a couple of minutes.� Then I wiped myself dry before I began to put
on makeup for my Master.� I'd do what I
had to do.� I'd had so much rage in the
beginning.� But what did I have to work
with now?� Look, I told myself, at the
situation as it was, not as I thought it should have been.� 

&nbsp;

I needed to get dressed for his return.� 

&nbsp;

And thus, I descended into the deepest catacombs of
voluntary sexual slavery.

&nbsp;

Anne Marie�s skin was covered in
goose bumps.� My gloves back on again, I
pulled an old army blanket out of a box of stuff I'd bought at an army surplus
store and draped it over Anne Marie's shaking shoulders.� After I'd put a towel over her seat and
guided her into the car, I drove thirty miles back towards where I'd
requisitioned the young beauty and finally dropped her off on the side of a
deserted country road.� I watched her
walk blindly, unsteadily down the gravel road towards freedom, wearing nothing
but the blanket, duct tape and high heels.�
On my way back, I threw away the roll of duct tape, the plastic over the
seat, the gloves, the towel and all of her ripped and torn clothes at different
locations.� Home scott free once again.

&nbsp;

When I walked back into the White
Room, I could tell by the humid atmosphere that Rebecca had taken a long
shower.� She was standing in a submissive
position with her head down.� Her hair was
coiffed and she was wearing a dark blue baby doll nightgown with strappy navy-colored
sandals that had four-inch stiletto heels.�
As usual, the heels only emphasized legs that were already
gorgeous.� To my disappointment, there
were no stockings, but DAMN!! did she look good.� Her extremely shapely legs looked baby smooth
and they glowed in the soft light with the lotion she'd applied.� 

&nbsp;

Finally, she raised her face to look
at me.� She�d changed somehow; suddenly,
I knew she was looking at me with what I call Deep South eyes, eyes that hinted at how the weight of her body
would feel as she moved willingly on me.�
Her makeup had been expertly applied and she slowly began to move
towards me, looking glossy and ripe, open and susceptible.� She gave me a small, tentative smile and a
smile lit her face; she had the fullest, most sensual lips I�d ever seen.� Those eyes��

&nbsp;

There are certain rare people who
are born with a pheromone signature so potent that even in a crowded room,
every member of the opposite sex is aware when they enter or exit.� Sensuality has always been more subtle than
sexuality; beauty more complicated than bone structure, elastic skin and an
assemblage of hydrated cells.� With
certain women, their beauty never died.�
This woman was like that.� None of
my temporary women had ever had the haunting beauty of Rebecca.� 

&nbsp;

She didn�t wear bottoms and as she
moved, her shaved mons veneris was sometimes visible through the gown that was
tied shut with just one bow over her chained breasts.� There was new matching polish on her finger
nails and toe nails that almost seemed to match the color on her swollen
lips.� She looked soft and submissive,
and feminine everywhere.� She wore the
leather slave collar and when she looked up at me I could see that she'd
inserted the nose ring back between her nostrils.� As she moved closer, I could see that she'd
also voluntarily donned the painful nipple wires that I knew she hated.� 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Chapter 30: In the battle of the sexes, woman
gains her greatest victory by surrendering; Unknown Source.

&nbsp;

I had taken my shower and was now ready to face Master.� I was clean on the outside but still felt
terribly dirty inside.� I wasn't naive,
but knew I would never know cleanliness of the soul again.� I felt uprooted.� It had taken me an hour to gather my courage,
but now I was steeled to my fate.� I knew
he would take me and hurt me.� But I also
knew I deserved it and was now emotionally prepared to accept his discipline
for as long as he desired; I'd rather that it happened to me than to another
innocent.� But surprisingly, he was very
gentle when he returned.� After looking
at me for almost a minute with a strange expression on his face, he kissed me
on the forehead and moved me into his bedroom, and from there into the kitchen
where he began to fix both of us a light meal.�
I had no appetite, but sat on a stool although the hard wooden surface
hurt me terribly between my legs.� And
even though I knew he would punish me for my insolence, I had to say something
to him.

&nbsp;

I didn't know what to say, what I would do
when the reality of my new life finally hit me. �I had to force myself to go forward.� At the moment, there was only a sudden
blankness in my heart, like some part of myself had been taken, torn away so
fast that I didn't know what to feel.� It
would come eventually, searing, burning, scarring, but right now there was a
hole, a void, albeit one which would eventually overflow with feeling.� 

&nbsp;

But how would I deal with the business of life?� Right now, I felt I would never get to the
point, the moment where I could think normally about my life again, without
thinking about the man who had taken everything away from me.� I looked down at my chest and thought about
the thick metal rings that pierced my breasts, all hidden under the skimpy,
sheer top.� I reached up and tentatively
touched the ring that hung from my nose and I thought about the small brand on
the inside of my thigh that only now was finally healed.

&nbsp;

I started my explanation, then had to stop for a
second.� My voice was still an
unattractive hoarse croak from last night, my throat still sore from spasms
caused by their deep thrusts banging on and bruising my vocal chords.� I swallowed and began again.

&nbsp;

&quot;Master, I swear I will never disappoint you
again.� It was my fault that you
needed....that you needed a new woman tonight, and I'll never do that
again.� But please don't make me help you
like that---I beg you.� I think....I
think....the memories might drive me insane.�
I couldn't handle doing it again.��
And you'll never NEED another woman again as long as you have me.� You've taken me and I'm yours.� I finally realize that now.� I swear, you'll never need another woman as
long as you have me.� I'll keep myself
attractive and in shape for you.� You can
do anything that you want and I won't complain or make a sound, I promise.� Just use me, not other women.� And when you've finished and I've recovered,
you can do it to me all over again---as much as you want.� Master, I beg you, please, just no more new
women.� Not because I'm jealous, but I
just can't stand seeing others hurt like that.&quot;� I was crying at the end, I couldn't stop
myself now.

&nbsp;

There was no expression on his face as he looked at me and I
knew that I would be fiercely punished tonight.�
Quietly, he asked me, �How can I trust you?� I think this is just another tricky way that
you think you might get your freedom back.�

&nbsp;

My heart was beating so hard I thought it might damage my
chest and I was crying openly now.� �The
police have a warrant for my arrest.� My
husband and family have disowned me.� And
I am publicly branded a sex offender.� I
have no home, no money, nothing left for me on the outside and no where to
go.� What would I do if I left here?�

&nbsp;

He remained silent for another minute, then asked in a soft
voice, �You would sacrifice yourself and any remaining chance of freedom for
women you don't even know?�

&nbsp;

I couldn't speak at the moment, so could only nod my head in
agreement.� 

&nbsp;

�Do you really understand what you are offering me?�

&nbsp;

I nodded again.

&nbsp;

He just looked at me for a second, then came around and
hugged me.� I was confused.� I didn't know what to do or how to react to
this new person.� This person was more
like the man that I had first known than the man I'd been taught to call
Master.� He talked to me and I stuttered
a few incoherent answers.� Confused, I
finally gained enough confidence to begin answering his questions and even talk
to him a little while I picked at the food he offered.

&nbsp;

He ensured I understood that I was
always partially, if not totally responsible for what he did both to me and to
others when he did not have me around to soak up his pain and hurt.� I hated this responsibility.� I felt branded by my guilt in what we'd done
together, what I'd done with him and for him at the end.� I felt shamed by what I had done.� I prayed that no one would ever discover my complicity
in his life-style, in hurting that girl.

&nbsp;

Master told me that he was sure I
had still lied to him even when he first tortured me---he used the word
compelled, but it was the same thing.� He
felt certain of my lies.� But he also
said that he knew I was much too smart to base elaborate lies on a flimsy
structures of truth.� He assumed he'd
know my reasons and my hidden truths soon enough.� So I gave him the final, tiny little details
that allowed him to flesh out the whole picture of my humiliation and
subjugation, the last few details that changed his picture of me from black and
white to Technicolor.� 

&nbsp;

As I talked about what I
had done with my students, I told him that women who are considered beautiful
learn how to hide their secrets very early in life.� How I'd walked into� rooms of men where I felt like I was the
bulls-eye behind every lie.� Could he, I
asked him, imagine what it's like to be pursued relentlessly---to have your
every move watched by men who want more than your body, they want to possess
you, even your most private thoughts.� He
dryly laughed in total understanding---of the men's point of view.� 

&nbsp;

I blushed in my stupidity,
but earnestly still tried to tell him how no woman could live up to the
expectation of that kind of beauty. �To
choose a partner on my own terms---that was freedom.� Enjoy sex because I wanted it and the way I
wanted it, that was the allure.� I had
finally discovered that sex on my own terms was healthy, it changed my brain
chemistry, kept me young inside.� But it
had a price; my husband.� Men can forgive
a women everything but two sin's; unfaithfulness and aging.� 

&nbsp;

I blushed as I began to talk about my husband.� Master thought I still had feelings for this
man and this seemed to anger Master at first, but soon he listened
intently.� I could never had said this to
Master before, but even though I knew my marriage was over, I told him now how
had I always at first secretly hoped that my husband could save me.� But tonight, for the first time I told him I
knew this for the fantasy it was.� 

&nbsp;

I looked down at my bare legs and told Master I didn't want
or need to be saved anymore.� As I spoke,
I concentrated on the feeling of cold wood against my still aching bare bottom
and vagina; the painful pinch of the taut wire loops around my nipples as they
pulled my breasts together; all of these truly convinced me that I belonged to
this man now.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I truly believe that that night was the night that Rebecca, the Independent
Woman, was finally broken.� She had
begun to care for me earlier, but has still fought her emotions.� But this was the night she lost all will to
continue fighting me, or any other man for that matter.� Before this, I suddenly realized that there
had always been an edge to her eyes, a dangerous awareness I had not at first
appreciated.� But now it was gone, and I
realized how untamed she'd been right up to the night I forced her to be my
whore.� And now that edgy, watchful feeling
seemed gone.� Left in its place was a
woman-child broken on the inside, a soft, vulnerable female whose only fear was
that she might be unable to please me enough....and through these actions
ensure that every other female avoided what she had chosen to accept
voluntarily, alone, as I satisfied my needs.

&nbsp;

I got to thinking about Rebecca and suddenly realized that I liked
the way she looked now, the way her skin felt, the way she smiled in those
small moments when I allowed her to be happy.�
At the same time, she needed to believe I was worth her sacrifice.� Her eyes continually searched mine.� She was a woman who�d been stared at by men
her whole life in the same way, I suddenly realized, in exactly the way I�d
been staring, so she knew when men were lying.

&nbsp;

Unsurprisingly, at the end it had become critically important to
really understand her.� To break through
the resistance and silence; a man needed to understand Rebecca before breaking
her.� And so I'd knotted the rope around
myself and started down into the pit that made her what she was.� And in the end, I'd succeeded.� I'd pursued the internal Rebecca with a cold
and silent passion.� I'd found that she
was a complicated woman, her mind a strange and fascinating mixture of order
and chaos.� My final understanding of
Rebecca had helped us both achieve what had been fore-ordained all along.� When the defensive structures that
represented to Rebecca the values and outlines of her previous existence, when
these artificial rules and boundaries had finally been broken, it had been like
the powerful roar of a weakened dam breached at last as all defenses crumbled
and everything I'd been teaching her fell suddenly into place.� She'd finally, and almost seamlessly,
integrated herself into the new role she would play in my life.� I had no doubt that I'd been meant to train
Rebecca for her role in my life from the day she'd been born.� 

&nbsp;

I leaned over the counter and took
both of her hands into mine.� I caught a
scent; the faintest hint of feminine muskiness mixed with some subtle
perfume.� The effect brought catnip to
mind, and I found my eyes drawn down the curve of her cheek to the fullness of
her lips.

&nbsp;

�Rebecca,� I said, uttering her
given name aloud for the first time since she'd been forced to accept the
collar.� �I don't want any misconceptions
between us.� No more lies, no more half-truths,
no more truths left unsaid.�

&nbsp;

I hesitated for a second; going
through with this was rougher than I had thought it would be.� �I raped a young girl here tonight.� When I hurt, I want to hurt others.� I've been trained to manipulate people and
then break them.� I'm good at it, I enjoy
it and I don't want to stop.� That's what
I am.�� I had come perilously close to
the truth with her.

&nbsp;

�And you, Rebecca.� I have a tape of you last night.� Rebecca, last night you willingly fucked at
least ten men.� It might have gone
further than you wanted, but at the end, you were a willing whore enjoying
herself last night.�

&nbsp;

She shook her head wildly in denial,
her eyes filling.� �The ginger,� she
croaked, �it....�

&nbsp;

�The ginger,� I interrupted her
protests, �may have pushed you past your initial inhibitions.� But what you did, it's in your
character.� And once you were where you
were with the ginger, the rest came naturally with those boys last night---that
was the real you at the end, that was your true nature.�

&nbsp;

She shook her head no, violently,
silently.� But I continued, implacable in
my beliefs and determination.

&nbsp;

&quot;You've always been a cunt to
men.� I guess it's the way you learned to
cope with your sexuality as a young girl.�
And as an adult, you chose to be a slut---for reasons which only you
know.� But last night, you were a
whore.� All of these things, all these
types of women are different...you know they are.� And you know that inside, deep inside, you
look at yourself as a whore now.� The
first part of last night may have started out with you a slutty, yet unwilling
participant; but in your heart, deep inside that part of you that we all try to
hide from ourselves, you KNOW you wanted it, that you enjoyed it way too
much at the end.� And the worst part is
now is the truth; you've discovered that you've always been this way.��� 

&nbsp;

�But, you see, here's the difference
between before and your new reality now.�
You're MY whore now.� You'll be
making me happy.� You'll be satisfying my
needs alone and I'll be satisfying your needs from now on.� You'll never have to whore like that again,
you'll never be ALLOWED to do that again, unless you need to be
punished.� But if I do choose to whore
you out again, then you'll do it because I want you to and not because you've
chosen to do it.� You see, that's the
whole thing now; you belong to me and it's me that's responsible for anything
you do now.� Do you finally begin to
understand that there are NO boundaries that control what I do with you,
what I can make you do, other than my desires and what I feel like doing?&quot;

&nbsp;

I continued holding her hands while
we talked.� 

&nbsp;

�You hated it at first when I first
took you; you felt you had to have your freedom back.� But given your nature, the best you could
have ever hoped for was perhaps a more camouflaged form of imprisonment than
you have here.� Freedom?� Perhaps sometime in your past, but not now.�

&nbsp;

She sat in silence.

&nbsp;

�I long ago learned that everything
is relative.� Everything is temporary,
and everything is mutable.� Perhaps that's
why I've searched for stability.�

&nbsp;

�You?� she asked in surprise.

&nbsp;

�What's wrong, woman?� Can't you believe that someone like me is
human?� I'm not as bad as you seem to
think.�

&nbsp;

She was silent because I'd caught
her in her thoughts.

&nbsp;

�There's always an explanation for
what we do and what we are,� I continued.�
�And, if you don't believe me, just take a look at yourself.�

&nbsp;

�You know everything about me?� she
whispered, lowering her head.

&nbsp;

�Naturally.�

&nbsp;

Now I took her hands and led Rebecca
off her stool so that we both stood facing each other closely.� �On principle, I never believe in a woman's
candor.� As to whether you're what I
think you are now or whether you actually even believe what you've said to me,
it all only adds to the confusion.� It's
your actions that count.� The actions of
a woman always speak so much louder to men than her words.�

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

He pulled me close and kissed me,
his tongue in my mouth, probing deeply.�
Even as my hands went tentatively around his neck, then pulled him
closer, I felt his stiffness build between us, growing until it felt like it
pressed against the whole length of my belly.�
He kissed my exposed neck, then bit softly.� Then he pulled back and looked into my eyes,
searching.....at the same time his fingers entwined themselves in my hair and
he pulled my head back.� After a moment
that seemed to last an eternity, he suddenly forced me to my knees.� 

&nbsp;

As I knelt on that cold tile floor
in front of him, I knew immediately what he wanted.� My throat was sore, but I also knew that I
would willingly give him whatever he desired, as best I could.� How could it have come to this?� I knew I must be deeply damaged emotionally,
but still managed to function somehow.�
The only answer I could come up with was that sometimes, I guess, what
looks like a choice isn't really a choice at all.� 

&nbsp;

I still hurt so much from what had
been done to me less than twenty-four hours ago.� My vagina, my ass, my throat, my jaws, my
breasts.� He could have rejected my offer
of total compliance or chosen so many other ways to symbolize this moment.� Ways so much more painful or demeaning, given
my condition.� But he had not and so I
bared him and willingly, urgently, lovingly took him in.� I prayed that he would not do tonight what
they had last night.� But in the end, it
didn't matter.� I belonged to him now and
whatever he did to me, I would accept.�
As his massive cock rested on my tongue and filled my mouth, hot tears
of gratitude inexplicably began to fill my eyes.� I felt an unfamiliar sense of thankful
appreciation that almost bordered on slavish duty.� 

&nbsp;

Was I going insane?� 

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

She was on her knees, looking up at me with almost adoring
glances as I deep-fucked her soft mouth.�
Her luscious full lips gripped my cock hard and I could feel her throat
muscles moving rhythmically, swallowing to take me more fully inside.� I shifted and surreptitiously repositioned my
cock, and she
moaned in protest. 

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I felt an unfamiliar sense of
humbleness for the first time in front of a man.� This couldn't be me, I thought, feeling an
obligation to satisfy a man, to sexually indulge him, to give him anything to
show him that his decision was the correct one.�
I was determined that he would never need......he would never want
another woman other than me.� It was in
those moment of complete lack of control, when I had no control over myself
that I realized I might be falling in love with him.� 

&nbsp;

I knew I should be questioning
everything I felt right now; How could this be?�
Was I evil?� Was I stupid?� What perverse thing in me saw him as
fulfilling my needs?� Instead, I asked
myself, instead of weighing down my conscience with blame, why didn't I enjoy
what he offered me instead?� 

&nbsp;

It seemed impossible, and yet I felt
it could only be love, although I'd had little real in my life like this to
compare it to.� I suddenly realized I'd
never been in love, not as a teenager, not even with my husband.� I'd never understood the meaning of the word.� I had always been selfish, always standing
alone at the center of my world.� I had
always protected myself from the emotions that drove other women crazy, making
them say and do silly, stupid things.�
Now here I was, falling in love with a man who had kidnapped and
tortured me.� I told myself over and over
again that this unknown feeling which so bewildered me, making my heart race
while I felt like both crying and laughing at the same time, it had to be
nothing more than a product of the terrible circumstances through which I was
being forced to live.� 

&nbsp;

I promised myself that when he let
me go, and he had to let me go eventually, I would go back home and be a better
person than I was before---no more rash behavior.� Life would get back on track and....� The truth was, I couldn't bear the thought of
returning to my previous home.� Not after
everything I'd been exposed to here.� I
had the feeling that I would never be able to go home again.� I tried to shake off such useless fears and
told myself to be brave, not to be so cowardly.�


&nbsp;

Even as I felt this unfamiliar rush
of emotions, I knew this man frightened me; how could I not be frightened of
one who held so much power---all power over me and our relationship?� Master knew so much about me and guessed even
more.� 

&nbsp;

But in one thing he was wrong.� I was his slut now; absolutely and totally
and forever.� I acknowledged this, I
bathed myself in this, I gloried in this........but I wasn't a whore.� At least not for anyone but him.� As time passed, I would prove this to him,
somehow make him understand this and believe it.� I was right for him.� He had to know this about me.....it was of
paramount importance that he know this about me.� I was many slutty things, but I wasn't a
whore.

&nbsp;

As I knelt on the cold kitchen floor
for him that night, we both began our lives over again.� But this time I was a willing participant and
held nothing back---nothing.� I belonged
to him and we both knew it now.....and I knew we both had finally accepted
everything that that entailed.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I felt good when she'd satisfied me
in the kitchen, so I didn't make her crawl.�
I let her off of her knees and walked her back into my bedroom, where
she laid on the bed and waited for me while I showered.� As my new woman lay on the bed, I could see
her began shaking because of what she thought might come next.� I could actually see her knees knocking
together.� She seemed mentally willing,
but physically afraid or unable to perform because of the condition of her
body.� However, she was resigned to her
fate and obeyed me in every detail.� She
looked so pathetic as she lay down, scared and as stiff as a board.� Not pathetic - disgusting, but pathetic as in
I felt a need to protect her.� The
problem was that it was me that had reduced her to this state in the first
place.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

We walked to his bedroom, my hand in his. �I couldn't tell if I was leading or he
was.� I'd been hurt.� I wanted to satisfy him so much, but was
absolutely terrified of how it would feel.�
I felt a throbbing sense of power emanating from him, as if he generated
some kind of physic voltage.� My heart
tripped---I felt a warmth spread through my body that was almost
embarrassing.� I approached his bed, my
emotions warring.� Eager to the point of
euphoria.� Terrified enough to try to
turn and run.��� 

&nbsp;

I was a realist, I had to be.� He was right; I'd hidden parts of my nature
from myself for too long.� Submerged them
under false pretenses to better fit in with the life I thought I wanted in a
previous existence.� I'd learned how to
suppress my needs, taunt them or even just laugh at them.� But I had never been able to face them.� But I had changed; I knew now that I was
different from most other women, different because I'd already learned how to
deal with pain and my needs long before I had taken my Master's collar.� I had always looked at physical discomfort as
a welcome ally that had pushed me at times to not quit.� But this wasn't one of those times.� It was only by no longer competing with him
or against him, that I could hope to win him.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I finished my shower.� Naked, all scent of Anne Marie now gone, I
turned off all of the lights except for small night light and walked back to my
bed.� She was shivering as she lay next
to me and when my hand first touched her, she jumped in what I guess was pure
fear of what came next.� I admit I wanted
intimacy from her, but not sex, not tonight.�
She lay next to me on her side, facing me.� I softly touched her neck and shoulder, then
I began to rub the tension out of her muscles.�
She was stiff and unresponsive at first and forgot to breathe, but I
never stopped.�� Amused, I thought to
myself that it was easy to rub her skin because the lingerie she wore covered
so little of her body.� As it became more
obvious that sex was not in her immediate future, she finally began to loosen
up.

&nbsp;

I thought back to when I�d first met
her.� Rebecca was a smart woman and I had
needed to be smart too.� All great
schemes are prepared from the basic formula of one part simplicity to two parts
complexity.� The first step was always to
aim for results that were both predictable and controllable; the second was to
create a set of measures that shielded the plan from the victim's knowing eyes
and still calculating mind.� As much as
can be done with human beings, I had executed my plan with clockwork
precision.� I looked at Rebecca as my
hands freely roamed her perfect body and I savored my total success.

&nbsp;

She lay on her side with her back to
me now and I continued rubbing her neck and shoulders and back.� Finally tired of this, I grabbed her shoulder
and softly pulled her towards me and onto her back.� She stiffened again, but lay next to me as
she had been taught; legs spread wide for her man, regardless of who he might
be for the night.� I put my hand on her
chin and turned her face towards me as I said, &quot;I'm going to say to you
now what I said that first night months ago.�
Look into my eyes so that I know you're listening to me.&quot;� She shuddered once and her eyes filled with
tears again, but she looked at me intensely.

&nbsp;

Rebecca fixed her eyes on mine, her
face looking like that of a lost little girl.�


&nbsp;

&quot;You belong to me and I care
for you, but never forget that you're a possession just like this bed or that
chair or the belt hanging in my closet.�
As long as you behave, as long as you're a good girl, I promise that
you'll never have to go through that again.&quot;� I didn't necessarily mean this, but I knew
that it was what she needed to hear right now.�
&quot;I'm responsible for you now, for your safety and your
welfare.� You may think of me in some
ways like your father.� You give me your
complete and total obedience, and in return I will protect you from everything
bad.� I'll protect you from everything
bad and never demand more than you are capable of giving.&quot;� 

&nbsp;

I had been trained by professionals;
I'd been a professional liar for years.�
I'd been taught to keep my face blank and the guile from my eyes.� Rebecca looked into my eyes for what seemed
an eternity, searching my face for any deception.� Then slowly, oh so slowly, her face crumpled,
for she had found none.� Her lips
trembled and suddenly she threw herself into my arms and wrapped her own around
me.� She broke down, crying her heart
out.� &quot;Oh, God.� Oh...my...God,&quot; she sobbed into my
chest.� 

&nbsp;

&quot;You understand that I will
demand absolute obedience from you?�
There will be pain, but I promise you that it will never be too much for
you to handle.� You will always be given
just enough to satisfy both our needs, but never more than you can
handle.&quot;

&nbsp;

Her face was pushed into my chest
and she nodded her head quickly.� I moved
her back and looked down at her face.�
&quot;Total obedience?&quot;

&nbsp;

Looking like nothing so much as a
little girl, Rebecca nodded, &quot;Total obedience, Master.&quot;� 

&nbsp;

She had answered me in an almost little girl tone of voice, and
this was totally unlike her.� She didn't
speak in a phony sing-song voice of an adult talking to a child, but rather,
truly like a young girl.� This sudden
affectation angered me at first, but I quickly understood.� This was an unintended emotional signal from
Rebecca that told me she was in hyper-submissive mode; her mind's unconscious
way of asking if she had been good enough, pleasing enough to me.� It was the voice of a little girl looking to
her cold and distant father for love, the voice of the prostitute beseeching her
brutal pimp for assurance that every loathsome act was valued, the voice of the
unappreciated housewife begging her ignoring husband for just one unconditional
touch of affection to acknowledge her existence.� It was all of these and more.� 

&nbsp;

The human mind is a marvel.�
I had taken a beautiful, intelligent, educated, confident woman who was
used to getting her way with men---a controlled and controlling cold-hearted
bitch, and turned her into a submissive slave, a beautiful servile woman that
was nothing more than a docile sex addict that desired a fix from me in ever
shorter intervals every day.� 

&nbsp;

I loved the human mind in all it's strengths and frailties.

&nbsp;

I pushed her onto her back again and
slowly untied the bow in front that held her tiny gown together.� She went stiff one final time that night, but
after I bared her chest, I gently cupped her right breast and pulled it towards
the left so that I could free her nipples from the cruel wire loops that still
held them captive.� She groaned softly in
release and when I lay on my back again without making another move towards
her, she gave me another big hug.

&nbsp;

For a few moments, I felt strong
satisfaction at what I had accomplished even as I kept my face blank.� I looked at the woman I held in my arms and
marveled again at her beauty.� I felt a
sense of accomplishment inside; it was so difficult to take a suddenly
vulnerable female and bond her against her will to a life that that another had
designed, one based solely on satisfying the other�s needs.� I had left Rebecca no choices in this, manipulating
her and her environment every step of the way.�
And that made her final defenseless dependency even sweeter.� She'd been a physically exciting, yet
emotionally detached woman that at one time had thought she was impervious to
any man around her. �Unfortunately for
Rebecca, the sheer intensity of feelings she aroused had made me want to do
anything and everything to first break her of her studied detachedness, and
humiliate and degrade her.� And I
had.� 

&nbsp;

This had been a feminist's dream
woman; intelligent, strong, beautiful, educated.� I'd used classical conditioning on her:
isolating her from every support structure and every source of strength in her
life; her family, her husband, her friends, her ability to earn a living, her
ability to rely on herself to succeed and the confidence that engendered, and
finally, her freedom to make any choices of any kind.� I'd engineered the demise of the feminist;
slowly desensitizing her to the brutality that became first unavoidable, and
finally inevitable.� 

&nbsp;

Then I made her focus more and more
on first understanding, then accepting and finally incorporating the character
traits she'd successfully hidden so deeply for so long and which I had finally
exposed.� Then after re-shaping her life,
I set Rebecca up to be gang-raped.� By
this act alone, I had forced her to undergo the single worst experience of her
life, showing her on the way down into her own personal gutter-hell, that she
too possessed a carnal side to her nature she'd never before really allowed to be
free.� 

&nbsp;

Even as she had over the last ten
years subjugated to her will that openly erotic side of her nature, I had in
turn set free that very same trait, even if initially against her will.� She could always claim that it was the ginger
root she had unwillingly accepted that night that made her that way.� But while the ginger may have been a
catalyst, once the woman I saw on the video last night had gotten started, she
had willingly spread her legs to fuck every male available in that room.� And the woman I saw greedily gulping the last
drop of cold cum from the scummy rubbers retrieved from the floor had, at the
end, not been forced to participate at that level.� In her heart, she knew this as well as I.� 

&nbsp;

The extreme acts performed on her
body last night had broken her physically---and from these she still had not
recovered.� But her voluntary assistance
in helping me rape Anne Marie tonight was what had finally destroyed her mental
equilibrium.� Even now she was still
trying to alter that previous reality through a filter that somehow would allow
Rebecca to protect herself, to convincingly tell lies to herself about what
she'd seen and what she'd done.� We're
all confused in some ways and we all wear masks to hide our true feelings.� But she was broken now; her need to be needed
and told by someone that she was good enough, that she WAS okay was so strong that she'd do
anything for me.� Everybody lies, but she
was in terrible pain from hers.� And I
knew that the part that was most frightening to this formerly independent woman
was that it was me that made the calls from now on regarding what she would
experience.

&nbsp;

My initial smugness of a few moments
ago was gone, fled with the tiniest bit of exultation I might have felt.� This was a woman that I might have cared for,
might have even loved at one time.� And
now she was nothing but my cock-puppet; the principle actress, the ONLY
actress in an erotic play that she would never truly understand; a play that
never used the same lines twice in a night, and never the same scenery two
nights in a row.� I felt sad in a way;
the challenge was gone, the erotic mystery that had made Rebecca Denholm so
unique was all gone now.� I would care for
her, but knew I could never love her when she was like this; and it was all my
doing.� I held Rebecca in my arms for at
least an hour that night as I allowed her to cry in her grief for the loss of
her last remaining individuality and personal freedom.� Then I think she cried for the sacrifices
that she knew would be demanded of her; demanded by me in return for allowing
her to save others more innocent than she with her surrender.� But even as I held her that night, I was
aware of this still, cold side of me that watched her, always measured
her.� 

&nbsp;

Somehow, even under the terrible
stress of these moments, there were still times that she'd exuded a sensuality
that was as tangible as a low, vibratory note.�
Her eyes would lock onto mine briefly, and she would gaze at me with a
smoldering focus.� And at those moments,
I had an absolutely abdominal sexual awareness of this woman, even though it
was absurd at these times.� 

&nbsp;

And when she was done crying, she
wiped her tears away and looked up at my face, then gave me one quick kiss
before snuggling into my chest and finally going to sleep.� The strong, independent female had finally
been broken.� The arrogant woman was gone
and in her place was left a soft, feminine body that had finally and willingly
accepted the yoke of total sexual slavery.�
She was mine now.� Mine body AND
soul.� Mine to do with as I pleased.� 

&nbsp;

I finally went to sleep, somehow,
surprisingly, less than totally satisfied with myself and the little slave who
lay snuggled into my chest and whose limited horizons I had just erased.� I wondered if I'd made a mistake.� Could I bring that sexy, independent woman
back?� It would be difficult to do; but
would it be worth the effort to bring her back?�


&nbsp;

Nah.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

He held me with what seemed infinite tenderness that night
and explained what my future held.� I was
still a mess, but I was better too.� I
was scared of the unknown, but knew I had to face it with what little courage
remained to me.� That morning I'd been
overwhelmed by a sense of total failure in my life; I'd felt a depression that
seemed not only natural, but well and truly deserved.� But now, less than twelve hours later, after
sending me to the deepest levels of hell, he had somehow again taken away so
very much of what seemed my perpetual gray existence and brought light back
into my life.� This man truly controlled
my life and there was nothing I could do about it, nothing I wanted to do to
change this.� I still hurt from what had
been done to me, but suddenly, somehow, I felt freer than I ever had before.� I felt like I had thrown off a set of
shackles I hadn't even known I wore.� 

&nbsp;

Yet even as I savored this sudden sense of freedom, I still
felt terrible guilt for what I had done earlier this evening.� That poor girl had been there because of me
and my weaknesses---and I had almost killed her myself.� I vowed to never be that weak again, to never
put another woman in that situation because of my pettiness, my insignificant
aches and pains.� I could handle my new
life now because I wanted to handle it.�
I needed to handle it!� It was
only pain that he offered, and we both knew that I could take great pain---if I
wanted to.� And now, finally, I did.� The mind controls the body.� It tells the muscles and joints to ignore all
kinds of warning signals.� But the
problem was that those warning signals were there for a reason, and in fighting
him, I had been trying to ignore what he brought me.� I finally realized that under his caring
guidance, we had together approached the ultimate level of my submission to his
authority; the exactly right mix of maximum pain for me and supreme pleasure
for him.� I wanted to please him,
make him proud of me.� I know that the
vanilla others outside my new world might look at me with amazement for this,
and a few even with disgust.� But their
scorn was nothing more than I would have received from them anyway, once
everything about me became public. 

&nbsp;

I lay next to him; I inhaled and he smelled like wood smoke
and leaf, dusky and thick, and the scent went right to the primitive part of my
brain and flicked a switch.� Not tonight,
but soon. �I was still too sore.� Somehow, my sense of smell had been changed
by him; become much more tuned to the softer, yet more raw flavors of sweat and
sex.� In my unconscious, I knew that
there was clinical evidence that people, especially women, reacted submissively
to pheromone signals from authority figures, especially testosterone.� The last line in that article had always
stuck with me, ��they tend to obey a man of parts.�� Regardless of the reason, the smell he
released as I lay next to him in his bed seemed overwhelming in its
intensity.� 

&nbsp;

I suddenly felt like I was a child in a warped family where
love had been perverted by sex, and the easiest way to survive was to
submit.� I felt my breath catch, then
come fast.� I hesitated, and then
breathed deeply again, bringing his scent deep inside, coating my need for him
with the sweet promise of pending ecstasy.�
I felt a tightening in my aching throat and the need to physically touch
him settling more and more firmly inside me.�
My invisible manacles had been created by my very nature and hardened by
his manipulation.� Well, he had what he
wanted now. 

&nbsp;

At the same time, even as I lay so close to him that I could
smell his breath, I felt paralyzed, and a feeling of shame suddenly suffocated
me, shame at what I'd done and shame at what I'd become.� I made a superhuman attempt to turn away from
him, but failed.� I suddenly felt awkward
and his silence was unbearable.

&nbsp;

Finally, eventually, I fell asleep in his arms that
night.� I knew that it would not always
be like this, warm and safe and secure, his arms a cocoon of protection.� But hopefully, there would be enough times
like this to allow me to survive.� And
with that thought, I fell asleep with a smile on my face.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Chapter 31: The
body says what words cannot; Martha Graham. 

&nbsp;

The morning sunlight awoke me.� I looked over at
Rebecca.� I brushed the long hair away
from her forehead.� The early morning sun
pouring through the window gave her face an angelic cast.� Her pale, sleeping profile was perfectly
silhouetted against the bright light, emphasizing her patrician nose, her
elegant neck.� I felt something
unfamiliar; a warm, tender, protective feeling came over me.� I watched over her while she slept.� Unlike the last few months, tonight
she slept on my arm in a sleep so deep that it seemed she would never
awake.� It was the deep, rebuilding sleep
of the psychologically and physically traumatized.� A sleep in which the mind takes its first
steps towards re-integrating with a world that had been totally changed.� She would need this sleep, and much more
before she healed completely, if I ever allowed her to go that far.� But that was for the future.� I lay next to her and looked at her
face.� A face that was already
beautiful.� But to me, her looks had been
greatly enhanced by accepting the symbols of her new life, by voluntarily
wearing the nose ring and nipple wire last night along with her slave
collar.� That act alone spoke volumes
about the commitment to her new reality.�


&nbsp;

I looked closer and saw that there was
something inherently different about her now.�
There was a glow that was new; the sense of self-imposed restraint
seemed gone.� In its place was a look of
relaxation and contentment that encompassed total surrender; on her face was a
look of....a look of actual happiness, something she had never before let me
see.� Something terribly important had
changed between us.� We both knew it, and
we had tiptoed around it last night like it was the proverbial 800 pound
gorilla that nobody wanted to mention.�� 

&nbsp;

She was awake now and wanted to lay
in bed by my side.� But I wouldn't play
the role I was sure she wanted; rather, I decided to make her prepare breakfast
for us both.� She looked at me for a
moment and smiled, then hopped out of bed like a ten-year old girl and shook
her hair out.� Before she left the side
of the bed, she slipped on her blue stiletto heels---that was a nice touch and
it brought a smile to my face.� My Sub
was such a sexy bitch!� I had to begin
trusting her some time and now seemed as good as any.� I lazily followed her, and even though it was
still bruised a little, I enjoyed the look of her gorgeous, firm ass peeking
out from behind the lingerie she still wore from last night.

&nbsp;

I sat at a stool by the kitchen bar,
watching her closely.� As I allowed
Rebecca for the first time to prepare and serve a quick breakfast, I attempted
to begin the healing.� I talked about
what had happened last night from the point of view of her being a victim too.� She must, I said, acknowledge that what she
had done in helping me was justified.�
She had been on auto-control, and everything she'd done was merely an
attempt by her lower brain to survive.�
She shouldn't feel guilt about it, because everything had been scripted,
totally out of her control.� If she needed
to feel anger, feel it towards me.� But
she also had to acknowledge that in the eyes of the law, she was an accomplice
in the young girl's rape.� Rebecca's eyes
clouded for a second and I knew that she still felt guilty about her role in
what had happened to that innocent, young girl.�


&nbsp;

This gave my little slave a lot to
think about while she ate.� Finally, she
looked at me and said, &quot;I can handle it, if you want me to, Master.&quot;

&nbsp;

I just about fell off of my
stool.� Once truly broken, I was amazed
at how quickly my sexy slut was able to incorporate her new lifestyle.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

Later that day, I heard a news
report about Anne Marie.� It appeared
that she had first been found last night by a couple of teenage boys that were
out drinking and joy-riding.� Wearing
nothing but high heels and duct tape, she had quickly been taken for another
ride, one much more brutal than that which she'd received from me.� 

&nbsp;

I felt bad about this.� She had been nothing but an innocent tool, a
means to an end with Rebecca and hadn't deserved this.� Actually, she hadn't DESERVED any of last night.�
But that was what the world was about.�
There were always a few wolves in it and the rest of us, ALL of the rest of us were nothing but
prey.

&nbsp;

I look back now and I can almost pinpoint the hour that I finally
won my private war with Rebecca, the day that she finally submitted to my
dominance in every way.� And it was Anne
Marie that I had to thank for that.� So her
pain had not been in vain, and for this I thanked her.

&nbsp;

It was like Rebecca's emotions had been kept hidden behind an
earthen dam, and when my demands had built up enough psychological pressure,
it'd suddenly broke.� And when she
finally internalized an acceptance of the unacceptable, Rebecca had suddenly
felt a relief of the spirit that she'd not even known she desired.� Non-consensual slavery was for many a
punishment, a sort of exile for those with weaker spirits.� But for her, she had finally learned through
intuition that it could be a haven of peace, a place of liberation. �This was the day she fully accepted the role
that I had demanded of her for so long.� 

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

It was
mid-February now and everything began with his first visit to the White Room
this morning.� It had taken my body over
a week to heal; he had given me all that and more.� The obvious bruises and torn flesh healed
quickly.� But there were unexpected
muscle aches, abdominal cramps and problems with indigestion; and my stomach
was suddenly full of acid.� I fought my
way out of a terrible depression and it finally felt like the clouds that had
followed me everywhere for so long had finally left me to go doom some other
poor woman.� 

&nbsp;

Although
each of these symptoms were physical in nature, we both knew that they were
psychological in origin.� But he was
patient with me and treated each with a gentleness and kindness that surprised
me...as long as his head didn't hurt.� I
was sleeping better, now for I knew I was in love.� I slept better, but my last thoughts at night
and my first thoughts when I woke up were always of my Master and how to better
please him.

&nbsp;

I had not
slept well last night and when I'd awoken this morning, the sleep deprivation
still felt huge.� I looked at my toenails
and knew they needed trimming.� I felt
like my whole body needed an overhaul.� I
forced myself to stand up.� The floor
felt cold to my feet.� I pulled the robe closer around myself and
looked out on the sunlit scene through the door that he allowed open now.� I wished it were summer; I longed to sit in
the wet heat and let it bake me to the bone.�
I always felt so cold now��always on the verge of getting sick
again.� But I somehow sensed
yesterday that he was impatient---impatient with me, impatient with himself,
impatient with us, and so did not look up as he closed the door behind him this
morning.� It was still cold and my body
was goose-pimpled; I did not know if it was his naked presence or his absence
that made me so cold.� I had not yet
dressed, but obediently assumed a submissive pose.� 

&nbsp;

He stood at
the door, silently looking out over the porch.�
He was subdued, eyes glazed, staring out at the gray horizon that melded
into nothing.� I burned a mental image of
his boyish grin in my memory, to savor as needed.� I studied his profile in the half-light.� Too sharp to ever be bland, too wary to ever
count as unassuming. 

&nbsp;

There was an
early morning fog that hung over his backyard, spreading out below and seeming
almost to abruptly start from nothing, as if the deck upon which he stood was
floating in an infinite pool and we both were treading water on the edge of
possibility.� It was an organic space of
light and air and water, a place for beginnings.� But not a place for beginners.

&nbsp;

His manner
seemed almost uncertain today, diffident.�
I was able to watch him without his noticing.� I was becoming ever more familiar with the
structure of his lanky body, the sharp definition of its muscle and bone.� I must admit that everything about him
disturbed me.�� The perfectly symmetrical
beauty of his face was something of which he was totally unaware.� Then he turned.� And as he walked towards me, I studied him as
I had not dared before, considering the intensity of his wide and slightly
hooded eyes.� Eyes that I finally
realized, might not be judging me after all; that might rather instead be just
watching.� 

&nbsp;

Mine wasn�t
a bad body; it had always done what I asked, more or less.� It had survived my Master�s training and his
later demands.� But it had needed his
training too.� I had lost all sense of my
true sexuality prior to his arrival in my life.�
It had gotten worse while first held by him and I had especially felt
this way immediately after the last rape.�
But the strands of an unfamiliar erotic need had already returned and
more and more of these strange desires were coming back now every day.� It was time, perhaps, to let some things come
back all the way.

&nbsp;

The
strangest thing was that my new feelings that should have made me feel guilty,
were actually turning me into a freer and happier person.� I wasn't worried about explaining my feelings
to anyone, for I didn't care anymore whether others else would approve or
not.� 

&nbsp;

As I
increased my distance from the event of my capture, my thoughts became in ways
more lucid.� Master could sense my doubts
and my fears, my internals and great suffering.�
I hated this place sometimes.� Yet
at other times, it was a magical place.�
It required an isolated place like this to bend a slave�s will until it
broke.� Only then, I realized, does a
slave truly become useful.� Complete
obedience may have slightly damaged me, but it also allowed me to survive.

&nbsp;

He'd opened
to me not only a secret history of women still enslaved, but an enigmatic world
of the men and women that controlled these women.� Early on I had no idea of what to do, of the
rules by which to navigate this man, the one that demanded I call him
Master.� But this morning I suddenly
realized that I no longer felt emotionally drained, exhausted from fighting
him.� And instead of warfare, I
unexpectedly felt a need to please him; I needed to accept everything instead
of fighting it.� This was a new world to
me, but as before in my previous life, I was still without a familiar role or
model; not daughter, not wife, not lover nor teacher.� But at the same time, it now did not seem
worth panicking over.� Instead, in a
perverse sort of way, I found myself excited by the challenge of this man, my
Master.� With a shock, I realized that
like two distinct threads, our lives were beginning to be woven together.� It was still a thin, mysterious tapestry at
best, but somehow I knew that this picture of the two of us would soon be
complete.� But I didn�t know what it
would show.� I do not know how this will
come out, I thought.� I do not know how
this will end.� It may or may not end
poorly---but in every way it was a new beginning for me.

&nbsp;

It's been
almost seven weeks since he entered my life.�
I suddenly remembered that Stage five, the final stage, was supposed to
be that of Acceptance.� It was for me at
least.� Suddenly, I knew that I had lost
long before I had been able to say it aloud.�
It was in the present that I now found myself suddenly wanting to please
him, to finally give him everything he'd ever desired from me.� And it somehow felt right to do so, for I
knew in my heart that this was best for me.�
I was in the midst of an epiphany, an awakening of the spirit.� I wanted to brush the hair from his forehead
and amuse myself by looking at the lines on his face.� They were the traces of the times he spent
without me, some forty-odd years that he'd lived far from me.� He had lived, dreamed, worked, breathed,
laughed, and even perhaps loved without suspecting that I was waiting for
him.� It struck me as miraculous that
someone like him had latched onto someone like me.� Even though beauty wasn't something that was
important to me, I wished I were more beautiful and attractive for him so that
he be blown away when he next saw me.

&nbsp;

I no longer
had the will or felt the obligation to thwart his needs and desires.� For the first time, I knew an intimate
willingness to bend, to finally accept another�s will in place of my own.� I both needed his slavery and yet feared the
unknown it represented.� I felt that once
I accepted his demands, it might then help me reach the stable ground that I so
craved; that it might somehow help inhibit the craziness that sometimes seemed
to forever ricochet inside my skull and somehow controlled my life.� This chaos was something that had never given
up and never before allowed me to remain standing before it.� 

&nbsp;

And beneath
that fear was another one.� Most things
could be fixed nowadays, but it did not seem possible that the scorched place
inside me could ever be healed by any man.�
But I could still hope.� It had
been difficult to admit total submission.�
Remember that moment, I thought.�
Remember what the world looked like before.� Before I finally gave him everything he
demanded, and more.

&nbsp;

In fairness,
he seemed to realize the importance of these moments to me.� I did not move when he briefly touched the
nape of my neck with the backs of his fingers.�
�This is one of the most beautiful parts of any woman,� he said softly.� His touch immobilized me.� It was the touch of supreme confidence, the
touch of a man who knew without question that some things on earth belonged to
him.� I thought, I have never been
touched this way before him.� I have been
touched furtively, drunkenly, ineptly: I had been groped and worse.� But never this.� He said, �Some women are as skittish as
horses.� Ideas alone can cause them to
bolt.� But not you.�� 

&nbsp;

I ignored
the blood rushing through me and held his eyes in a less than demure way, �Not
me, Master.�� 

&nbsp;

He said,
�Look at me.� No, really look at me.�

&nbsp;

I sighed and
laughed under my breath.� I leaned over
very slowly and gave him a kiss on the very lines I loved.� He was standing in front of me naked.� Where his legs joined, his man�s beautiful
staff poked up stiff and hard from a familiar thicket of coarse, dark
hair.� It was long and thick, veined and
purple, and the bulbous head gleamed in the morning light.� I thought back to when he first brought me to
his house; how it had been me in charge, demanding that he wear a condom each
time before accepting his slickly lubricated meat between my legs.� Now he was in control and nothing would ever
be the same again.� Every time he
penetrated me now, his brutality and sheer animal vigor overwhelmed me as he
forced himself inside my body.� 

&nbsp;

But the past
didn�t matter to me anymore.� I had
sincerely submitted, exerting myself to satisfy this man�s needs; physically,
emotionally and sexually.� I leaned forward and ran my tongue over one
of his nipples, then the other.� They
tightened against my lips so I scored them with my teeth.� He grabbed my hair and I stilled, ready to
fight for the right to taste him.� But
instead of pulling me away, his palm cupped my head, urging me on.� I suckled him, the tiny bud of his nipple
hard against the roof of my mouth.� His
free hand smoothed over my back, up my ribs, then settled onto my breast where
his thumb teased me into a similar state.�


&nbsp;

Immediately,
I began to let down love�s juices and he worked my body with a focused
intensity that made me realize he would never have given up until he had
won.� I had so greatly underestimated him
from the beginning.� I knew now that even
with my fine woman�s intuition, I had never really understood the danger this
man had presented to my sexuality.� In
truth, I had actually sensed the danger, but still had not been prepared for
the depth of his desire, the heights that he would be willing to scale to
possess me.� 

&nbsp;

Was I going to be fucked now, I asked
myself or was he going to torture me by making me wait?�� I was on my back finally and my pussy was in
the air.� I was excited, my labia were
engorged and wet, and I could smell the heat between my legs.� But I was a little apprehensive for some
reason too.� Oddly, I felt my nipples
harden at the same time that my mouth began to water.� I balled my hands into fists and used them to
prop up my hips, raising my pussy even higher.�
He liked this sometimes and my response was nearly automatic now.� I waited, breathing hard.� I loved this man, but like any junkie, I
cursed my addiction to the sexual release he offered and felt guilty about it,
but still.....my body literally vibrated in anticipation of what it knew he
offered.

&nbsp;

I sensed his bare feet near my face,
standing on my hair, pinning my head to the mattress.� He knelt, half sitting on my chest.� I could feel his bare cheeks touching the
flesh of my breasts. Finally my vision cleared; I was in a canyon, a long,
hairy box canyon with a huge prick waiting at the end.� 

&nbsp;

Anticipation!� I'm about to be fucked by a man that keeps me
as his captive and I felt......anticipation!�
What was wrong with me?� How had
my life come to this?� 

&nbsp;

Anticipation....and fear.� I couldn't help it.� He held so much power over me that I looked
up at him like a frightened child.� He
stroked my face, and the fear subsided, replaced by a throbbing need to make
contact with his flesh.� The blood
whooshed in my ears as I turned my head and licked his bare foot.� He laughed and lovingly straightened my head
with his hands, moving forward so that his balls were over my mouth.� He lowered his hips and I took him inside
eagerly, gently, moaning softly in pleasure.�
My moaning turned him on as usual, and I could hear his mannish grunts
of satisfaction and anticipation as I tongued and gently sucked on his
sack.� 

&nbsp;

After a while, he slowly lifted his
balls out of my greedy mouth and turned his hips.� I knew what was coming next, so I tilted my
head back, opened my throat and waited for him to slip his cock inside me.� His aim was perfect and my lips closed on
him.� I timed my breathing to his long
strokes as he began to mouth fuck me.�
Wet sucking noises filled the waiting air, but there was no
gagging.� I never gagged anymore.� His hands were on my breasts, and I felt him
pinching my nipples, then twisting the golden bars that were now permanent
marks of his ownership.� He knew the pain
made my body arch under him and my mouth and lips tighten around his meat. The
pinching got harder and more aggressive, and I became more and more responsive
to his cues.

&nbsp;

I loved these feelings of domination
and submission, and eventually everything faded out but the sensations of the
moment.� When I finally returned, he'd
mounted me.� Instinctively, I squeezed my
vaginal muscles in time to his thrusts.�
He groaned and covered my mouth with his.� His saliva flowed down my throat as he did
this, but I didn't care because his thrusts were so powerful now that he pushed
my sweaty body towards the foot of the bed.�
I flattened my hands on the bedsheet and tried to wrap my legs around
him, but they wouldn't move.� I groaned
with the frustration of not being able to wrap myself around his body.

&nbsp;

He lifted my upper body off the bed
like a weightless doll and looked directly into my eyes.� We stared into each other's eyes for a second
that dragged out for a lifetime, then he slowly impaled me, purposefully
dominating my open and willing body again and again and again.� His slippery, silky cock felt like a huge
fence post as he jerked me up and down on it, pushing me forwards and driving
me backwards, my hypersensitive pierced nipples always rubbing wonderfully on
his chest.� We
finally exploded together; his arms wrapped around me with crushing
strength.� I couldn't breathe...and I
didn't care.

&nbsp;

He spoke
softly as he held me.� I felt so odd, as
if the vibrations of his deep voice penetrated straight to my loins.� I struggled against the effect, but there was
an intense pleasure now that was in such contrast to anything that I�d
experienced over the last year.�
God.� I felt myself take a deep
breath, feeling myself become more fully immersed in that soft and confident
voice, as if I were sitting in a tub with warm, gurgling water rising around
me.� Nothing mattered except this
overwhelming sensation of fluidity.� He
continued to look at me and I felt him invade me as if he were on top of me in
bed.� 

&nbsp;

I said
nothing.� What was the matter with
me?� I only wanted him to look at me, to
caress me and talk to me.� Nothing else
was real to me in that delicate moment.�
He moved closer and licked my ear, then bit my neck softly.� I smelled something good, something male and
exotic that had the fragrance of freshly ground hazelnuts.� My skin began to tingle, and something
slightly sweet spread across my tongue.� I
licked my lips and nodded, as if to say, I have no control over what you do to
me, but of course I�d stay even if I were free.�
Right now, I�d do anything that you asked, just to keep you touching me.

&nbsp;

When he
finished, he left me without saying a word, unchained and free---he'd sated
himself and then he was gone.� I lay on
my back in my bed, my arms held rigid at my sides.� My vagina ached and buzzed and tingled; my
belly and the insides of my thighs were sticky with his cooling semen.� I finally raised my arms and spread my
fingers wide.� I go forward, I
thought.� Taking first one stroke, and
then another, away from the scene of my initial devastation at his hands weeks
and weeks ago.� Toward a rock; something
solid that would not give way.� But this
anchor had never seemed within my reach until I had truly consented to serve
his desires.� 

&nbsp;

Finally, I
closed my eyes and sank into a strange animated state of rest.� I don�t know if I actually slept.� I seemed fully awake, yet simultaneously
hovering over my body.� It should have
been frightening, but it wasn�t.� I could
see him too, not too far away, doing whatever he was doing.� I dozed lightly then, as if in a trance.� I drifted away from the wreckage of my
previous life and the uncertainty of my new one.� There was nothing here that could hurt
me.� Whatever I could lose had already
been taken away; I was in so many ways safer now.� There was nothing left for me to lose.

&nbsp;

I awoke and
stood in the dim light of the White Room, wondering if I knew exactly what I
had done.� My heart was racing and I was
perspiring profusely.� After fifteen
minutes of confusion, I took a shower; it felt like I was washing away all of
my previous sins.� After I cleaned
myself, I engaged in mindless chores to make the time pass.� Later, he came back, stepping into the dim
light of the White Room.� He wanted more
and for some reason I involuntarily stepped back, like an animal trained by
fear.� There was the right distance for
us to both guard ourselves and look at each other, which we did in a
concert-rated silence.� A silence that
would not have existed before my accepting his collar in totality.

&nbsp;

I was, he
told me, to come to his bed at nine tonight.�
Then he left again.� The rest of
the day passed slowly.� Now I sat in
front of the mirror in the White Room and gave my hair a wild brushing, then
inspected my face in the mirror.� I was
taken back by the fact that I looked very much the same as before.� 

&nbsp;

Then it was
time.� But instead of coming immediately
as my Master had ordered, I sat on the edge of my bed looking at the opposite
wall for I knew not what.� I had
submitted to him and my fear was gone.� I
felt, if not peaceful, at least settled inside.�
All I needed now was courage, and I would do my best to please him
tonight.� In just a few short weeks, I
had gained a new awareness of my body due to him.� On the outside, I might still seem upright
and strong, but I knew now that my body was a weak vehicle that had betrayed me
to him.� It, and I, belonged to him
now.� Finally disallowing thoughts of
what was to come next, naked except for my collar, I rose and strode quickly to
the door that led to his bedroom.� 

&nbsp;

After the
White Room, his bedroom was a salve.� My
eyes drank in the colors that I remembered from when I was free.� I pulled the door closed and leaned against
it.� I drew in a deep breath, allowing
the air to fill my lungs completely.� So
this was it, I thought.� This was where I
would truly experience again the spell he'd woven around me with his collar.

&nbsp;

He was
standing there on the far side of his bed, but I felt somehow my tardiness had
angered him.� He remained standing,
seeming to glower above me.� His anger
seemed sudden and I could feel it like a wall of heat.� I closed the door behind me and sat on the
closest edge of his bed in fear.� I
flattened my palms on the fine muslin bedspread.� Now that I was here, the moment had arrived
and my nerves were exposed.� I sat very
still and strained to hear something other than our breathing.� Suddenly, my sense of isolation was
cavernous.� I knew it was wrong at the
time, but it didn�t seem to matter.�
Unbidden, I rolled onto my stomach on his bed and waited nervously,
absently tracing the embroidery I could like feel Braille under my
fingers.� 

&nbsp;

When I
emerged from my thoughts, I realized his eyes were studying me; but I was
unable to meet his gaze.� During the day,
I had evaded their burning look, while I tried to keep my voice normal.� I admit that I found him immensely.....very
handsome.� I didn't know if it was the
way his hair fell over his forehead, or the way he gestured, or how he
smiled.� When he looked at me like this,
I felt weak in my knees.� I wanted to
flee, go back to my room, run away and never see him again.� I closed my eyes in a silly, desperate
girlish attempt to take refuge in my mind, but I couldn't.

&nbsp;

�You're
late.� I like you,� he said in a harsh
tone, �but don't mistake kindness for weakness.�� Suddenly, his apparent anger was gone.� He remained on the other side of the bed as
he said, �I know everything about you, woman.�

&nbsp;

Even as I
turned to face him, I could feel my cheeks heating up.� �What do you know about me, Master
Christian?�

&nbsp;

�I know that
your skin smells like, like some exotic lotus.�
I know you like the feel of your legs bare, rather than wear stockings.� I know that you have demons inside you that
you�ve fought for years.� I know that
you�re embarrassed by your own beauty, but you know it�s there---because you
know just how to avoid your own reflection.�
I know that you've hated your collar, but completely accept the idea
now.� I know that you�re sad, because the
creases in your face have taken years to form---and though those creases are
faint, they tell me exactly what you will look like when you�re fifty.�

&nbsp;

�I don�t
know how you do it, Master.�

&nbsp;

�Do what?�

&nbsp;

I had gone
too far.� �Nothing,� I stammered.

&nbsp;

�Tell me.�

&nbsp;

Now I was
frightened.� �It�s nothing, Master.�

&nbsp;

�For the
last time, tell me---you will tell me.�

&nbsp;

I hesitated
for a second, weighing the punishment of telling an unpleasant truth versus
being caught in a lie.� But suddenly, I
knew I truly had nothing left to lose.�
�It's you.� It�s like you turn a
tap on and off.� First charm and wit,
sensitivity and all feelings that you need a soul to feel, then the
brutality.� You turn it all off as
quickly as you turn it on.�

&nbsp;

He remained
silent as he looked at me for what seemed an eternity, then shook his head with
seeming disappointment as he said, �You don't think I have a soul?�� He laughed hard for a minute.

&nbsp;

�For one so
experienced, you are so naive about yourself and your refusal to face the
truth.� As a female, you like charm from
a man; but as a woman, you need the discipline as much as I do.�� Finally, he climbed into bed with me and I
lay under the covers with him.� I did not
feel I had the energy to either dread the coming event, nor enough to look
forward to it.� Without a word, he
reached out and slowly rolled me onto my back.�


&nbsp;

His hand was
on the back of my head, bending my neck back so far I was afraid he would break
it.� I remained silent, I had no choice
now.� A weird lethargy came over me as he
kissed my neck, then scraped the throbbing vein with his teeth.� My blood seemed to thicken and slow; my pulse
beat in my ears as if I'd been running for miles, or making love for a long time.� Finally, he reached my lips.� And when he was done kissing me, I suddenly
realized that I'd never been kissed the way Master had just kissed me, as if I
were the only woman in the world, the only woman he ever wanted.� Foolish, I know, but that's how he made me
feel, and I began to wonder, in a far corner of my mind, was there a chance for
us, together?� My fingers touched my
lips; they felt swollen, sensitive, needy.�
I realized that I craved the taste of his mouth.� When he finally finished with me, I remained
in his bed.� I closed my eyes and sleep
came almost immediately.

&nbsp;

In the
night, I dreamed and awoke twice, beginning each time the numbing and familiar
role of imagining the worst.� His voice
soothing me as he lightly bit my neck.�
The pain and the excitement it caused.�
The feather-light stroke of lips to the pulse at my throat, a tongue
trailing across one breast, then the other, teeth grazing my nipple, then my
stomach, then thigh.� Heated breath
brushed the naked skin between my legs as a clever tongue did things that made
me both limp and tense, tantalized and tortured.� The scream of a small death as I came.� I finally awoke a third time, panting and
gasping, my dream orgasm still rocketing through my body.� I glanced to my side and saw my Master.� 

&nbsp;

Watching him
sleep, I felt a surge of gratitude so strong that it brought tears to my
eyes.� I had learned to live.� Without fear.�
I wanted to wake him with a kiss, hold his face in my hands and look in
his eyes and thank him, really thank him, so that he could understand how much
his trust meant to me.� I smiled faintly
at the ridiculous urge and waited for it to pass.� 

&nbsp;

I continued
to listen to him breathing softly next to me and somehow comforted, I went back
to sleep.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I jolted
awake, bolt upright, my eyes wide open.�
Fear fluttered in my heart, like a bird in a net struggled to be
free.� I pressed my hand against my chest
to still my beating heart.� For a moment,
I was neither awake nor asleep, as if some part of me had been left behind in a
dream.� The room came into focus.� I was safe in his bed.� Gradually my eyes became accustomed to the
dark.� I was safe from my fears, nothing
could reach me now.� 

&nbsp;

My Master
was deeply asleep, his arms flung out claiming ownership of most of the bed.� His hair, smelling of smoke and wine, was
fanned across the pillow.� Moonlight fell
through the bedroom window.� In the
gathering light, I could see the shadow of rough growth on his chin.� I wanted to him to wake so that I could tell
him that everything was all right, that I knew I didn't have to be afraid
anymore.� But he did not stir and it did
not occur to me to wake him.� Fearless in
the past over so many other things, I was inexperienced in the ways of being
his slave and was cautious still.� So I
contented myself with lightly running my fingers down his smooth, tanned arms
and across his shoulders, firm and broad.�
I could feel the life moving beneath his skin even as he slept.� And when I remembered how we had spent the
early part of the night, I blushed, even though there was no one there to see.

&nbsp;

I realized
suddenly that I was overwhelmed by the sensations he aroused in me.� I delighted in the way my heart had begun to
leap when I caught unexpected sight of him, the way the ground shifted under my
feet when he smiled at me as I made him happy.�
At the same time, I realized that I still had a ways to go, for I still
did not like the feeling of complete powerlessness.� I feared love was making me weak, giddy.� I did not doubt that I had begun to love him,
and yet I knew that I was still keeping a little of myself back.� 

&nbsp;

I
sighed.� All I could hope was that, with
time, it would become easier.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I had finally decided upon her name.� Female slaves kept in Arab harems in the past
had been named after gems and precious stones; diamonds and rubies, pearls and
sapphires.� The practice was appropriate
then and seemed appropriate to me now.�
The next morning I informed my woman that she would from this time
forward be known as Rasha, the
pearl.� She accepted this with quiet
dignity, bowing her head to my will.� I
was not in the mood for a fight today and frankly, I admit that I was relieved
at her calm acceptance.�

&nbsp;

Two days
later, I was reading in the afternoon, alternatively finishing a paragraph or
page, and then becoming distracted by rays of the sun that sliced through the
air beside me.� My reading brought to
mind romantic notions of love that swam enticingly inside my head, diving and
surfacing in a dangerous and flickering pool of hope---could a slave ever have
hope for love?� I hadn�t seen as much of
him since I had formally yielded my freedom, and I found myself listening for
him as I tried to quell my impatience.�
It was if he were as confused as I.�
But of what, I wasn�t sure.

&nbsp;

Even as I
found myself thinking about Master, I later realized that I was unable to think
about parts of our shared past; it was a defense mechanism, a way to keep my
sanity.� 

&nbsp;

Instead, I
thought about my last conversation with him.�
It was clear from the beginning that we both were lost in our own
labyrinths.� However, even though he and
I were initially going in different directions, I felt that we somehow would
soon be sharing the same paths.� And I
knew that we both would learn to like it.�
Were these thoughts too impudent for one such as me?� We were drawn, I realized, to people who
could teach us.� And the people who teach
you, they also set you free; you love them like no one else.� This is why I was drawn to this imperfect
man.

&nbsp;

Maybe, like
the man that now controlled every aspect of my life, I was becoming a little
strange.� There were moments in the
violet silence of the southern evenings, when I was aware of a deepening of my
spirit.� There was an obscure nothingness
to my life now, but I was satisfied with it.�
Perhaps it was only at the edge of nothing that true meaning began.� Everything I had once known had been forgotten.� But I only had to re-discover it again.� Unearth it again, but now in a new context.

&nbsp;

Each weekday
now I exercised and cleaned the White Room, then prepared for his arrival in
the afternoon.� As I cleaned, I sometimes
found myself daydreaming, my hand unconsciously caressing a piece of
equipment.� Then I would catch myself and
pull my hand away quickly as if I had been burned.�� But thoughts of the smooth wood, braided rope,
cold metal and aromatic leather would often stay with me for longer than was
healthy.

&nbsp;

With a
shock, I suddenly realized that I was enjoying my life.� I had no responsibilities, except to be
available to him.� He actually spent time
with me in the afternoon and at night, and for the first time in a long time, I
had someone with whom to talk.� There was
the sex of course, and while I didn�t get to make a lot of choices, he was a
good lover when he chose to be.� And when
he was bad with me, he was VERY bad.�
Like each of us he had preferences, and there were certain parts of me
that he kept perpetually sore, but I actually found myself looking forward to
these times and the odd feelings that they brought to the surface, emotions I
had not yet sorted out.

&nbsp;

My life was
a life laid bare to the bone.� As
pathetic as my life might now be to some, I still felt a sense of relief as I
finally realized that what this man had been trying to teach me about myself
was probably true; this was almost certainly my single remaining route to
happiness.� And the funny thing was that
I felt happy for the first time in years despite what had happened, in spite of
everything that he had done to me.�
Something had shifted inside me---it was as if the dry, frantic
neediness that I had brought with me from my previous life had somehow edged
out of me and infected him instead.� It
was true; I could feel it inside of him.�
I needed the discipline he gave me, but I felt he needed me too.� Suddenly, almost overnight, I wasn�t afraid
of him anymore.� If I was not happy here,
I certainly felt somehow content.� I liked
the way he gave me only the freedom that I deserved, and the way that no one
stared at me now.� I liked the oddities
in my life, I liked everything about it.

&nbsp;

A few days later, I finally took Rasha out for quick weekend at
one of the nearby tourist towns.� This
was the first time I�d allowed Rasha out of the house since her night in the
electronics store and her time with Anne Marie.�
I'd kept her isolated while she integrated her old values and beliefs
with her new reality---and it had taken quite awhile.� 

&nbsp;

We'd had a good weekend.�
She wore a short light-golden, almost yellow sun dress with matching
strappy four inch heels.� Rasha was
gorgeous and men everywhere were struck dumb by her beauty.� Her dress covered her breast chain in a way
that ensured she actually seemed to forget for awhile that she'd been
pierced.� A metal retainer for the hole
between her nostrils and her formal necklace as a subtle slave collar.� She'd quickly gotten over her initial
embarrassment with not being allowed underwear and had begun enjoying
herself.� We could have been any vanilla
couple.� She wore light makeup and had
her hair in a ponytail; she acted like she was fifteen years old again.� She'd enjoyed shopping for the tourist kitsch
and I'd gone without a headache for a long time; so I found myself able to
smile at that odd things that all women seemed to want to accumulate.� On Saturday afternoon, I took her to a late
lunch then back to a small, out of the way motel.� With nothing better to do and tired of
shopping after a couple of hours, we went back to our room.

&nbsp;

I led her into the motel room and looked at her silently after I
closed the door.� It was time.� She was in a good mood as she set her
shopping bag down.� She looked at me
quizzically at first.� But as the silence
drew on, she became more and more uncomfortable.� Rasha looked down at her feet at first, then
finally returned my gaze.� A long time
went by silently---twenty seconds, maybe thirty.� I could see some color coming into her
cheeks, her nostrils flaring slightly with each exhalation.� 

&nbsp;

I broke the silence with probably the last thing she'd ever
expected to hear.� �If you want your
freedom,�� I said, �all you have to do is
leave.�� She quickly looked at me for a
second in disbelief, then looked away.�
The silence extended into a long uncomfortable stretch.� She clearly didn't believe me and glanced
around the room, her head moving in quick, efficient jerks.� She became more and more agitated.� Finally, she got up and started pacing,
slowly at first, then more rapidly, her head nodding as though internally
confirming something, trying to accept it.�
She looked everywhere but at me.

&nbsp;

�All you have to do,� I repeated, �is leave.�

&nbsp;

�You don't want me?� I don't
believe you.�

&nbsp;

�All you have to do to be free,� I repeated myself a third time,
�is leave.� I want you to walk out that
door, if it's possible.�

&nbsp;

�You really don't want me?�
You really don't want me.�� She
looked stricken.� 

&nbsp;

�God.� I......I have to get
out of here,� she said more to herself than to me.� She walked over to the dresser where I'd
allowed her to unpack the few things she'd brought and pulled open a
drawer.� She began throwing things into a
soft sided bag.

&nbsp;

�Rasha, get out.� If you
can,�� I said.

&nbsp;

Finished packing, she threw the bag over her shoulder and headed
towards the door.� Her eyes were filled
with tears.� I moved in front of
her.� She tried to go left around
me.� I stayed with her.� She went right.� That didn't work either.� She moved left again more quickly.� No go.

&nbsp;

She had become oblivious to my presence.� Something had gotten in her way, she had been
blindly trying to force her way around it.�
But her lack of progress forced her to change focus, and all at once,
she saw that the obstacle was me.� Her
eyes narrowed and her ears seemed to settle back against the side of her
head.� I watched her shift her weight, a
slight rotation of her hips.� 

&nbsp;

She made a sound, half rage, half desperation.� She stepped back and swung the bag at my
head.� I went with the blow, dissipating
most of the force.� She reloaded and
swung again.� Again, I flowed and
absorbed.� 

&nbsp;

Rasha started crying and swearing softly, hammering me with the
bag, with no obvious goal now except to vent the rage and frustration that had
built up over the preceding weeks and months.�
I let her pound on me, taking most of the impact on my forearm.� She was in shape and it took longer than I
would have liked for her to tire.� But
eventually the power of the blows lessened, the interval between them
lengthened.� Finally she stood, the bag
hanging at her side, her breath heaving in and out.� I lowered my arms and looked at her.� 

&nbsp;

She glanced around the room.�
I realized that she was looking for a better weapon of convenience.� Something heavy and blunt, or sharp.� She must have sensed that I was onto
her.� Or she didn't see anything that
would do the job.� Regardless, she
stopped scoping the room and looked in my eyes.�
Her pupils were huge and black---dilated by adrenaline.� 

&nbsp;

Her panting punctuated her words.�
�Get.� The fuck.� Out.�
Of my way.�

&nbsp;

I looked at her.� This was
the old Rebecca and it was going to be a long night for her.� 

&nbsp;

Suddenly, she charged and caught me off-balance.� The move might have worked, but I caught her
body with both hands and used it as a brace.�
She reared up under me, and I grabbed her by the biceps and shoved her
against the wall.� 

&nbsp;

She dropped the bag and tried to hit me.� I took hold of both of her wrists and slammed
her arms up against the wall on either side of her head.� Our faces were inches apart.� I felt her knee coming up and I pressed my
body against hers to stop her.� My cheek
was pressed against hers now and her smell, that perfume that I liked was now
mixed with excitement and fear and sweat.�
It hit deep inside me.� 

&nbsp;

I dropped my face to her neck, feeling as if I was going to bury
it there, but then I was kissing her instead.�
I heard her say, �No, no,� but she wasn't fighting me anymore.� 

&nbsp;

Keeping her arms and body pinned to the wall, I brought my face
around to kiss her on the mouth.� She
twisted her face away.� I let go of her
wrists and took her face in my hands.�
She tried to push me away for a second, then she was kissing me back,
almost attacking me with her mouth.� I
ran my hands down her breasts and squeezed her waist, her ass.� I realized that I was kissing her as hard as
she was kissing me.� 

&nbsp;

I reached up and tried to undo her dress, but my hands were
shaking for some reason and I couldn't do it.�
Fuck it.� I slipped the
fingers of both hands into the gap between the top and pulled hard on the
sides.� Everything popped free and her
breasts were in my hands.� The chains of
ownership that kept them bound swung wildly.�
Her skin was damp and hot from her exertions.� 

&nbsp;

Kissing me so hard I was forced to step back from the wall, she
reached up and tore my shirt open the same way I had torn her dress.� Then she reached down for my belt buckle.� No, I thought.� You first. You do nothing to me---I do it
all to you.� I yanked her dress down
to her wrists and spun her around so that she was facing the wall.� We started to struggle again.� I put her left arm in a wrist lock and bent
it behind her back.� I held it high,
almost to her shoulder blades, and shoved her up against the wall.� I reached under her dress with my free
hand.� She was steaming hot, soaking
wet.� I pushed her dress up, pinning the
fabric against her ass with my hip.� Her
buttocks looked great, very few bruises remained now from her previous
spankings.� She snapped her head back and
caught me on the cheek.� I pressed
against her harder and pressed the side of my face against hers so that Rasha
was pinned entirely against the wall.� I
reached down and began to touch her softly between her legs.� She closed her eyes and groaned.� I moved my fingers inside her and her body
shook. 

&nbsp;

I looked around wildly.� To
our left---the dresser.� I shoved her
over to it.� There was a stack of travel
magazines on top and I swept them to the floor with my free hand.� I bent her over, bearing down on her arm and
pinning her upper torso.� She struggled
but the wrist hold was too tight.� I
stepped to her side, opened my belt, and undid my button and zipper.� 

&nbsp;

I stepped on the cuff of my left pants leg with my right foot and
dropped my pants, stepping clear of them with my left leg as soon as they hit
the floor.� No way was I going to deal
with this wild bitch of a slave with a pair of trousers pooled around my
ankles.� I repeated the move with my
right leg, then slipped off my underwear.�


&nbsp;

I stepped between her legs and pushed up her dress again.� Her breathing now was more like gasping, and
so, I realized, was mine.� Still pressing
down with the wristlock, I started touching her again.� I don't know what I was waiting for.� Maybe I wanted to torture her a little, to
torture both of us. 

&nbsp;

�Do it,� I heard her gasp.�
�Do it now, or I'll kill you somehow.�

&nbsp;

I ran my free hand along her back and flanks as I moved to her
rear.� I felt her struggle and from the
back could see the aroused, oversized mound between her legs darken as it
filled with blood.� My heart was
hammering so hard I heard it thudding in my skull.� I moved in, pushing my cock lengthwise between
the lips of her slippery pussy.� She
groaned in pleasured anticipation.� I
didn�t want to enter her just yet, but somehow, as if by instinct, she inched
backwards until she was over my cock and then pushed herself onto me.� She had overstepped her boundaries and needed
discipline.� I twisted and heard her moan
from the new pain in her arm.� I laughed
softly and started to pull out, then felt her vaginal muscles try to tighten on
me.� It was a delicious sensation, but as
usual, I had another hole in mind this afternoon.� 

&nbsp;

I kicked my slutty slave's feet further apart, wiped some of her
wetness on me, pointed my cock and started to push into her ass in one smooth
motion.� She cried out, squirming. But
the pressure of my cock on her anus was unrelenting and slowly I worked my way
inside her rectum.� I knew I had to be
hurting her, but I was beyond the point of caring whether what I wanted hurt
her or not.� In a few seconds she was
fully impaled. She no longer had to wait for the bowel expanding sensation she'd
known was coming, but gasped so loudly at the last moment that I felt the sound
of it run back into me like the feedback screech through a microphone.� I started driving into her; long, slow smooth
strokes that buried every inch, my hips sliding up and forward, my gut and ass
clenching and releasing with each profound stroke.

&nbsp;

I was enjoying the sensations almost too much to maintain any
coherent thought processes---almost, but not quite.� I suddenly realized that this was a wonderful
opportunity to test her training and maximize my pleasure at the same
time.� I needed a paddle.� Looking around, I
grabbed the single magazine remaining on the dresser and after rolling it up
loosely with one hand, I slapped her flank once.� Immediately, as she'd been taught over the
last two months, Rasha's squirming hips settled into a steady rocking motion�a
nice comfortable gait that I'd repeatedly trained her to use at moments like
this.� Her ass was like compressed
heaven, her hips making springy, short moves as she formed herself to me and my
needs.� There was no thought now; she was
solely engaged in satisfying me, her pelvis making the necessary collected,
controlled movements of a born ass-slut as her weight shifted back towards me
and then away from me again.� 

&nbsp;

I enjoyed Rasha grinding
around my cock for what seemed an eternity, then gave her ass another single
sharp whack.� My beautiful slave
responded instantly, increasing her fucking speed to a slow trot, her buttocks
grinding into my loins even harder as she took everything I had.� She moved beneath me to a controlled beat
that only she could hear and I bottomed out inside her more than once as I
tried to give her a last half-inch of steaming meat.� She cried out in pain each time, and I looked down at her the
last time.� The side of her face was
pressed against the dresser, her eyes squeezed shut, her mouth open and
panting, in pain or ecstasy or both.� I
didn't know---I didn't care.� Her cheek
was streaked with tears.� I didn't care
if I was hurting her or not, I kept going.�
I didn't slow down at all.

&nbsp;

A minute went by, maybe two.�
I forgot who she was, who I was, why I had her there.� There was only the room, the heat, a
singularity generating a rhythm as old as the oceans.� I waited a bit and then hit her ass with the
magazine again and again.� Each time my
beautiful slave went a little faster, increasing her pace as I took her from a
lope to a canter, and finally to what I made her call a gallop.� She was fully extended now, her head as low
as it could go. �Her moves had shortened
to a full-out slamming of her buttocks into my groin accompanied by little
circular movement; but everything was accompanied by a clamping move with her
rectal muscles that was jaw-clenching in its intensity.� I rode my woman in a crouched half-seat at
the end, maintaining control with my hands on her hips as I asked her for
everything she had.� And she gave it to
me again and again.� 

&nbsp;

I heard a deep groan and realized it came from me.� Or maybe it was her.� She opened her eyes and looked back at me,
pleading for something.� I let go of her
wrist and took hold of her hips with both hands.� She gripped the edges of the dresser and even
though she still wore high heels, she moved up onto her toes even higher.� There was full length mirror across the room
and I could see ourselves in it...she was heaving for air to fill her lungs,
her dress was bunched up around her waist and our bodies were connected only by
my steel-hard cock.� The ridges of her
leg muscles were sharply defined as she raised her ass even more for both her
pleasure and mine.� Her lips were moving,
but if there were words I couldn't hear them.�
Her legs were trembling.

&nbsp;

Finally, she clamped onto me like a vise and as I felt her start
to cum, she took me over the edge with her.�
The heat from her rectum and the pressure as her final internal clench
literally sheathed my cock with her velvety soft, searing hot flesh, every
sensation crashed together and made it feel like she was vulcanizing her
insides to me.� I dug my fingers more
deeply into her hips.� The pounding in my
chest and in my head seemed to fuse together with everything else; my legs, my
balls, my gut, her body beneath and before me, everything.� Through it all I could feel her cumming in
waves under me and all around me and myself cumming inside her.

&nbsp;

Finally, it subsided.� I
eased down on top of her, supporting some of my weight with my arms.� I could feel her slowly relax and go back
down on her high heels as I finished injecting my final gift of love deep in her
ass.� I felt emotionally empty,
physically drained.� We stayed that way
for a long time, our breathing slowing down, our sweat drying, coming back to
ourselves and our respective positions in the world.� I reached down, grabbed a handful of
pony-tailed hair and pulled her head up.�
I looked down without expression at my beautiful ass-slut as she looked
back at me out of the corner of her arctic blue eyes.� We both knew that I had just proved once
again my ownership of her body and her soul.�
I let go and her head fell back to the dresser as she closed her eyes.

&nbsp;

It had all been so successful.�
I looked down with almost bittersweet emotions on the woman that still
used her rectal muscles to please me, rhythmically clenching and releasing as
she'd been taught; milking for his pleasure whichever man had last taken her;
draining him of his very last drop of semen.�
It didn't have to be me anymore, she didn't realize it yet, but she'd
been trained to perform like this for any man that might possess her.� 

&nbsp;

As she continued to grab me, then let go, I realized how different
men and women were.� Beneath me, Rasha
lay on the dresser with her eyes closed.�
I think she was savoring what she felt was a deep emotional connection
based on our sensory and emotional and physical associations; her intellect
probably consumed with the buzzing afterglow of what to her was an act of love
and deep devotion and commitment.� But
like most men, as soon as I got my nuts off, my mind wandered into totally
unrelated areas.� I rubbed the firm
muscles of Rasha's ass even as my cock still kept her anus pried apart.� 

&nbsp;

My hands rested on her hips with casual ownership as I thought
back to our first meeting.� She'd sat
across from me, a proud, arrogant woman.�
A slick gloss of indifference had covered her expressions and whatever
her real emotions might have been.� She�d
later refused to play the hopelessly ditsy female to reassure my masculine
insecurities; she hadn�t rambled and hadn�t used double entendres to test what
she considered tasteful boundaries.� An
independent, strong-minded woman not used to losing battles of will with men; a
woman that was instead used to manipulating men.� A wife.�
An intelligent and trained professional woman.� And as soon as I saw the haughty look on her
face that day, I'd wanted to wipe it away forever.� 

&nbsp;

Now, as she willingly lay bent over the dresser this afternoon,
panting, with my spent cock still rammed up her ass, I felt the buzz of total
sexual release and the absolute satisfaction of total dominion over a beautiful
woman.� This was ownership of another in
its most profound state.� I'd ridden her
right up to the gates of everything she'd ever feared, and made her jump them as
she continued into the unknown of total domination.� 

&nbsp;

I'd wanted to degrade her, make her pay for all of the other women
that had treated me and every other man the same way.� And I'd succeeded; I'd taken everything away
from her, piece by broken piece.� 

&nbsp;

To me, at the time, it seemed only appropriate to turn her into a
sex toy; and even more humiliating for her, I�d concentrating on the type of
sex that I'd known she'd hated, the type of sex that tended to burn toys out
quickly, physically aging parts of their bodies far beyond their years as they
serviced men this way. 

&nbsp;

In the end, if her last performance was any thing to go by, I'd
wildly exceeded my expectations for two reasons.� I'd torn down or taken away anything that
made her an individual and then re-shaped her into a loyal slave that was also
the perfect ass-slut; the pathetic creature that now crouched beneath me with
my shriveling cock still buried in her rectum.�
This act today, in this tawdry motel room, had been nothing more than
that; an act staged to test the loyalty and love and strength of training of my
sex slave.� It had been like
domesticating an African lioness, then leaving the door to its cage open one
last time at the end of training just to see what the big cat did.� But I'd turned the once beautiful cat into a
pitiful shell of its former exquisite self with my punishments and
discipline.� 

&nbsp;

And Rasha had performed beautifully.� She'd walked up to the open door of the
previously inescapable cage that existed now only in her head, smelt freedom
one last time, tasted it over and over on her tongue---and then---and then
she'd backed away and raised her ass to let me take her one more time.� Choosing the simplicity and surety of sexual
slavery over taking responsibility for the troubling and far too complicated
concept of freedom.� For where I had
taken her mind now, freedom was far too �messy�
of an idea.

&nbsp;

The second reason?� I think
she loved me.

&nbsp;

I should have felt ecstatic, and to be truthful, I was
happy---happy with what I'd accomplished.�
I'd take her out tonight and we'd celebrate a little.� I planned to enjoy myself, perhaps humiliate
her a little, then we'd come back and she'd celebrate with me one more
time.� But....but, as I looked down on
Rasha, her eyes still closed in apparent ecstasy as she continued clamping and
releasing, clamping and releasing, I realized that I too had become emotionally
involved.� For even as I had molded her
body and feelings and needs to please my desires, I too had changed.� If I'd allowed it, this could well have been
the woman that answered all the questions that I'd ever had about life and
love.� In her I might have found the
friend and lover for whom I'd been waiting my whole life.� 

&nbsp;

Or at least the unbroken and untamed woman that I'd first collared
could have been that.� 

&nbsp;

After awhile, I eased myself up and stepped back.� She pushed herself up off of the dresser and
looked at me.� Neither of us said
anything.� There was a pause and she
looked down at what was left of her dress, then let it slide off her arms as
she stepped out of it.� I pulled her to
the bed and she yielded softly, expectantly, laying down next to me; her body's
needs gorged for now, she soon she fell asleep in my arms.

&nbsp;

She lay next to snoring softly, satisfied for the moment with her
sexual exhaustion.� Her pose displayed
her naked torso to its best advantage, the light accenting the scattered small
red blotches that formed patterns characteristic of being physical
disciplined.� I followed the smooth flow
of her muscles, the play of light across her naked breasts and stomach.� A hypnotic sight, marred only by the light
bruises that I'd given her as they'd blued and darkened over the last couple of
days.� 

&nbsp;

We'd had a wild and noisy affair that could have been heard all up
and down the hall.� But I didn't
care.� This had been more symbolic than
anything else.� Even though I had set her
up, as far as she knew, this had been her last opportunity for freedom.� But in the end, she'd submitted beautifully
to my ownership even when it wasn't clear she needed to.� For the first time it, I was convinced that
she wasn�t faking her commitment to me, to her subordinate position in our
relationship, to her new role in this new world.� Refreshed and sated, we awoke famished.� Then I decided that I wanted to take her to a
club for dancing.

&nbsp;

***

In spite of
feeling fresher after almost four hours of sleep, I was still mentally
exhausted.....and sore in one area.� I
didn't want to do this, I didn't particularly enjoy the feelings of bodies
packed shoulder to shoulder on the dance floor.�
If it had been possible, I would have asked Master to take me on a
vacation, then followed him to the ends of the earth, some place where nothing
and no one reminded me of the life I'd been forced to leave behind.� I was a changed woman after his intervention,
more than willing uproot my life for him.�
But what would I do when this was over?�
Would this EVER be over for the likes of me?� Would he ever let me go?�� Would I ever want to leave him?

&nbsp;

Only one thing
was for sure.� No matter what happened, I
was sure he cared for me in his own way and would stay with me, always in the
lead until I put my life together.� 

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

Music has
always had a strange, almost primal effect on me.� The beat of some songs seemed to pulse
through my body, giving me uncontrollable urges.� But tonight, mostly my thoughts centered
about Rasha.

&nbsp;

Before we went
dancing, I insisted on a slutty look that made her uncomfortable: very short
red skirt, tight off-white halter top, red strappy high heels and a red velvet
choker that acted as a dressier, slightly more formal slave collar than black
leather.� The halter top had a low V-cut
neckline, an empire waist and was made out of a soft, light nylon-cotton mix
that clung to her body.� It hid nothing
and with no bra, in the cool evening air it was immediately obvious that she
was excessively female.� I'd made her
continue dying her long hair light brown and she'd put it up in an
inappropriately elegant chignon.� Rasha'd
hated the whole look and was absolutely embarrassed when I'd forced her into
it.� I found it so interesting that she
still felt a sense of shame about style and tone of her dress and
appearance---did she still somehow preserve some modicum of dignity after all I'd done to her?

&nbsp;

But she was
happy about my having allowed her a thong; I nodded graciously as I accepted
her profuse thanks.� But I didn't really
care, for the damned triangle of cloth was so small that it covered absolutely
nothing between her legs.� She was still
fresh from the shower and I'd watched a grimace of distaste cross her face when
she put it on.� Now all I wanted to do
was to slide my hands up under her skirt and slip the damn thing down around
her ankles.� Finally, I'd insisted on
more makeup than she was used to wearing.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I felt almost
groggy after making love and then taking a nap, but after putting on light
makeup, I dressed quickly for him, reluctantly pulling on the sluttish mini and
tight blouse he insisted on.� Wonder of
wonders, he'd finally allowed me a thong.�
As usual, I finished off with the normal pair of uncomfortable stiletto
heels.� Then he made me put on more
makeup.� I looked at myself in the mirror
and blushed.� I knew I was too much of a
walking clich� to look sexy.� I looked so
ridiculous that I felt like crawling into a hole, but finally having panties to
wear made me feel a little better.� He
just couldn't seem to understand that women.......leak sometimes.....and
panties were necessary.� I looked like a
total slut when I was finished, and I walked a little funny because my rectum
still ached from satisfying his needs.�
But the men that saw me later that evening seemed to find my appearance
attractive.� Most important, I knew my
Master was pleased and somehow, this made me feel a little more sexy.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I entered the
club with my woman walking slightly behind me.�
Radiantly beautiful, even dressed as a slut, Rasha was still somehow
able to look cool and haughty, indifferently ravishing.� As always, my Rasha turned heads as she
strode in a suitable distance behind me.�
She ignored the inevitable stares and the whispered comments as if she
were at home on a model's runway in Paris or London.� She looked almost professional, donning once
more her old mask of arrogance and disinterest---it was a persistent fiction
that she seemed to work at maintaining and I would destroy it later
tonight.� 

&nbsp;

Women dressed
to kill stood shoulder to shoulder, but men still stopped talking as my woman
passed by in that amazing glide she had.�
I knew immediately that she was the sluttiest, sexiest thing there,
clearly more desirable than any of the other equally pretty, yet empty-headed
young women that seemed to stalk the dance floors and bars like jungle cats
looking for prey.� There was something
different about Rasha.� She seemed a
puzzle to the men that watched with hungry eyes; a woman that clearly despised
a meat market like this, yet it was clear that she was no innocent in this sort
of a place either.� 

&nbsp;

Surprisingly,
after all I'd done to her and all that she suffered under me, in public at
least, Rasha still managed to maintain a distant, almost cool appearance of
dignity.� Yet at the same time, she
somehow still exuded an indefinable air of innocence.� And it sometimes seemed mixed with something
a little more spicy---amusement perhaps?�
Or maybe it was the obvious intelligence in her eyes that so confounded
the men around her?� Maybe it was the way
she walked.� The almost predatory, yet
subtly controlled aggressive movement of taut ass and hips barely covered by
the short strip of red cloth that hinted of massive sexual fires barely contained
in her belly; the fires that were obviously tamped down and under full control,
at least for the moment.� Clearly, her
looks promised a man his ultimate challenge before she submitted for his
pleasure.� And the men responded en
masse.

&nbsp;

Combining the
innate challenge to men that just oozed from every pore in her body along with
the provocative way I'd forced her to dress was a killer combination. The men
noticed it immediately, as did most of the women.� But none of them knew that I'd gotten there first.� I was looking forward to tonight; tonight I
planned on humiliating her a little.�
Breaking through that haughty appearing exterior with an audience of
hungry men looking on.� Nothing too much,
just enough embarrassment to bring back the wild look in her eyes and the pain
in her face.� She was addictive and she
was mine; and after our bout in the motel this afternoon, she needed some
manipulation.

&nbsp;

There were two
bars in the club; the one on the second floor in the back was almost always
empty.� I found a tight booth for us in a
dark corner and after she'd slid in, I got us two drinks from the bar.� As she sat next to me, her tiny skirt barely
covered her gorgeous ass.� Everything
about the woman seemed to scream sex: her beautiful hair as it caught the
flashing lights off the dance floor, the way her eyes sometimes locked with
mine as her body swayed softly to the music even as she was sitting still, the
way her body seemed to move innocently under the strobes yet inadvertently
still touch mine.� 

&nbsp;

I urged Rasha
to finish her drink, then got up to get her two more.� While I was gone, apparently one of the men
standing around took it upon himself to make a move.� I stood at the bar and looked back just in
time to see him say something to her, then reach for her hand.� Just as he did, she slapped him hard.� A real stinger that sent his expensive
glasses skittering across the floor.� She
was a tough broad to other men, I thought to myself.� But I'd domesticated her ass for my own
private use.� At the same time, I wasn't
sure how much I liked the fact that she could revert so quickly back to
pre-collar behavior.� She wasn't I
realized, completely where I wanted her.�
I'd have to watch her closely.

&nbsp;

I suddenly felt
possessive of my beauty and after I sat down again with her drinks, I put my
arm around her shoulder.� I could see
that a few other men had wanted to visit our booth while I was at the bar, but
she'd given them incentive to stay away.�
I'd watched her closely after her encounter and there'd been no come-along
looks, nothing on which a man could pin his hopes.� She pleased me with her loyalty.

&nbsp;

Rasha was
attentive---not flirtatious, just attentive.�
She listened to every word I had to say, looked into my eyes, didn't
even mention what we'd done earlier.� I
watched the light play on her hair and told her she looked lovely.� She smiled in pleasure.

&nbsp;

I pushed her to
finish her last drink---Rasha didn't handle alcohol well and this fit into my
plans for the evening.� On impulse, I
grabbed her right breast.� I cupped its
soft, full weight and supported it in my palm�
It was the openly possessive act of a woman's openly possessive man,
letting the whole world know she belonged to him.� I could tell that she was uncomfortable with
my obvious control in front of others, but that didn't matter to me.� 

&nbsp;

The men
continued watching and a few single girls came in and sat on the opposite side
of the lounge.� Their presence ignited my
already flaming loins---not because they were watching---they truly didn�t seem
to care.� The idea that they knew
something sexual might be happening across the room was what heightened my
already turgid state of arousal.� The
crowd was thinner now and most of it consisted of college kids interspersed
with a few older single men; the usual bachelor losers that always seemed to
patrol a place like this, dreaming of making just one more score, but never
quite bringing it off. 

&nbsp;

Rasha had no
choice but to finally accept my open possession of her breast.� After a moment of pleasure, I upped the
ante.� Soon I'd slipped my hand inside
her halter and cupped her breast without the flimsy cloth between us.� She again squirmed uncomfortably as I stroked
her breast possessively.� 

&nbsp;

There is a
theory about the power of human touch, something about it being the most subtle
form of sex.� Certainly it is the most
sensual.� Not that I was necessarily
getting a perverted thrill out of massaging my woman's breast in public, but I
admit I was enjoying it.� I gave her
breast a good squeeze, and Rasha stiffened like she was going to pull away, but
she knew better.� Once she tried to
gently push my hand away, but I wouldn't stop.�
She took a quick look around and saw that no one seemed to be watching,
took a deep breath and finally relaxed a little.� 

&nbsp;

In this I could
tell that she was wrong.� The alcohol was
finally beginning to hit her blood stream and as I continued massaging her tit,
I could feel her nipple harden.�
Suddenly, Rasha leaned in and gave me a quick kiss.� As I kissed her back, I pinched her nipple harder
to punish Rasha for her forward behavior and she gave an involuntary whimper of
pain.� Even with my discipline, her last kiss still seemed
aggressive, almost angry; she raked my lower lip with her teeth as she pulled
away, but I liked the taste of it.� 

&nbsp;

Her knees were slightly spread, and although it was awkward, I
quickly slipped my other hand all the way up her skirt; Rasha actually looked
surprised for a second and I thought she would say something in her shock, but
she kept her silence.� I finally freed
her breast from my obviously unwelcome attentions as I began to stroke the
inside of her thigh; she finally spread her thighs a little more allowing me to
touch her from the inside of her knee to the stiffening clit she thought hidden
behind a tiny rag of cloth.� The smell of
aroused and wet female sex soon filled the air around the booth.� I reached in with my right hand and pushed
aside the tiny crotch of the thong in order to stick two fingers inside
Rasha.� As this all took place under the
table, it seemed to be a little more acceptable to her.� As I continued massaging her pussy, she
finally arched her back and began to gasp softly. She was almost in a trance as
she moaned to the music.� 

&nbsp;

I continued finger-fucking her and quickly the crotch of her thong
was sopping wet.� I knew she was turned
on and drunk, and that she didn't necessarily want to be either.� She looked delicious at the moment, almost
stunned; her eyes were wide open and her glossy lips were spread as I began to
tug at her thong---she didn't move to stop me.�
Soon it was so stretched out of shape that we both knew it wouldn't stay
on if she tried to dance.� Unwillingly,
Rasha lifted her hips a little and I had it off of her hips and down to her
knees in one second.� Blushing fire-engine
red, she unobtrusively removed it the rest of the way herself.� 

&nbsp;

Suddenly her thighs clamped shut on my hand to keep it pinned
where it was.� At the same time, her hand
finally came to life and began to stroke my rigid cock through my pants.� I left my hand imprisoned for a minute or
two, then freed myself.� I now went back
to her tit and soon I had pushed the halter top to one side and bared Rasha's
gorgeous breast for everyone to see.� Her
breast chain hung seductively from the nipple piercing, then draping into her
cleavage.� Her nipple was a light rose
color in the dark booth and it was engorged, sticking out far enough that I
could have hung a hat on it.� This move
brought her back from her own personal world and she began to fumble as she
tried to cover herself and hide her breast in the halter again.� 

&nbsp;

With the hand that was around her back, I grabbed her wrist and
pinned it so that she couldn't cover up.�
In a couple of seconds, Rasha finally stopped fighting me and looked
around praying, I guess, that no one was watching.� But several couples were clearly watching us
now.� I smiled at them and openly played
with her nipple some more.� Rasha was now
sitting next to me with in silence, her head down and eyes were closed, her
face expressionless but red with embarrassment. 

&nbsp;

After a minute, Rasha took a deep breath and finally lifted her
fourth drink to take a sip.� I reached
between her thighs and as it reached her lips, I pinched her clit and then
began to roughly massage it.� She almost
dropped her drink, but was finally able to control herself long enough to take
a small, fake drink.� She licked her lips
again, and finally looked at me with slitted eyes; the emotion there was hard
to read in the dark, but I thought it was unwanted lust.� 

&nbsp;

We had been in the corner of the dance club for about forty-five
minutes now.� I had a huge hard-on that
wouldn't go away and was getting impatient.�
I leaned over and whispered in her ear, �Down on your knees, Little
Slave.�� She looked at me in shock, quickly
shaking her head no.� I smiled and said
it out loud this time, �On your knees, baby!��


&nbsp;

�Please, Master.� Please
don't make me do this. Not here, not like this.�� Rasha begged me softly.� She had a pleading look on her face that made
her look as innocent as a ten year old.�
Her eyes were suddenly filled with unshed tears and she was begging for
my understanding.� But this afternoon in
the motel room had defined our relationship for good.� I had my needs and wanted to feel her on me,
so I grabbed her hair and began to tug her down.� She desperately looked around one more
time.� It was one of those moments when
everyone knew exactly what was happening, but pretended they weren't
watching.� Rasha was being studiously
ignored and there was no white knight to save her---I think they all thought
she was a high-priced whore I'd rented for the night.� Finally, with a look of resignation that was
mixed with both despair and surrender, she finally slid beneath the table and onto
her knees.� I felt her hands fumbling at
my jeans and soon my zipper.� I looked
around nonchalantly and saw that the same two couples were still watching us;
this was okay since I have nothing against public displays of affection.� 

&nbsp;

I had nothing
on under my jeans, and with the fly open Rasha could bob up and down almost all
the to the base. She took me into her mouth and the feeling was
unbelievable.� Being out in public when I
made her take care of me like this was almost surreal.� The sensation was intense to the point of
being unbearable---I couldn't get enough.�
I kept my hand on the back of her head to ensure that she didn't get any
unwanted ideas.� Taking a deep breath, I
closed my eyes, then opened them a second later as I felt her fingertips
pushing beneath my erection to stroke my balls.�
She knew exactly how hot she made me feel, and I wasn't sure how much
more of this I could take.� 

&nbsp;

Now she took
her revenge; going slow and moving to the beat of the music that rumbled from
the speakers, rocking her mouth over my meat with a sloooow, rhythmic up and
down cadence, sucking in hard, and then relaxing.� God, she knew how to suck cock even when she
didn't want to.� The little tricks and
the little moves with her lips and her special sucking kisses, swirling and
licking with her tongue, they all pushed me over the edge until I felt like I
was falling into the music.� Falling and
rising up, then falling again.� No more
waiting.� No more holding back.

&nbsp;

Soon, both of
my hands were clenching the edge of the table in a delicious passion and she
was on her own.� As the music swayed over
me, I knew that I was going to cum.� And
suddenly, I did.� I grabbed her hair and
let a solid rush of semen gather velocity as it rumbled the full length of my
erection before it� jetted into her
waiting mouth.� She fought me for a quick
second as she felt me bulge, then took it all on her tongue in the back of her
throat.� I came several more times, each
spurt being smaller and having less velocity than the preceding one.� Finally, I was done; my cock lay on her tongue,
pulsing slowly as it filled her mouth.�
Rasha hesitated for a second, then I could feel my cock thrum in her
mouth as she swallowed the full load.�
God, this woman was amazing!

&nbsp;

I could barely
move for a minute or so.� At the end, I
had been controlling her head and mouth with handfuls of her hair.� Finally, I pried my cramped fingers apart and
let loose of the handles that I'd grabbed on each side of her head; suddenly
she slid back up to sit next to me.� I
zipped my pants as Rasha looked at me expressionlessly; she first licked her
lips, then took a long sip of her drink.�
God, she was sexy.� Even when she
didn't want to be!

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I reluctantly
slid under the table and got on my knees in front of him.� I'd knew had too much to drink and was
getting a little tipsy because as I knelt on the floor, I almost fell on my
side.� I soon had him open when Master
grabbed great handfuls of my hair on each side of my head to keep my head
centered and mouth under his control.� 

&nbsp;

He'd left me
with nothing, taking almost everything of value from me; my freedom, my pride,
everything that defined how I valued myself.�
My face burned in that dark corner under the table, my eyes stung with
the need to cry.� I was terribly
embarrassed at what he was making me do.�
The office full of boys a couple of weeks ago had been horrible, but at
least there I hadn't been been on my knees under a table, forced to perform in
public for an audience of hundreds.� He'd
allowed me to be treated like a whore then, but now, for the first time he'd
made me feel like a whore.� He'd finally succeeded in making me feel like
a cheap, trashy whore.� The man had
everything else of me that he could ever have wanted�why did he want this too?� I didn't deserve this; God, why me? 

&nbsp;

My thoughts
continued for a few more seconds, then crashed like a ship on a reef as I
finally understood I could no longer deny that there were certain realities
that I'd been forced to develop in new my life.�
Abruptly, I was exasperated with myself; I was sick of the pretenses,
sick of the excuses I'd always made for myself.�


&nbsp;

I inhaled
deeply through my nose since I couldn't breathe through my mouth, then
continued pleasuring him.� He'd given me
a chance to leave him earlier today at the room, but I had not done it.� Instead, I'd let him ass-fuck me until I
could barely move afterwards; no, the truth was I'd wanted him like that,
rough, brutal animal sex without preliminary build-up.� We both knew I could have left him at any
time tonight.� But I hadn't, and somehow
he'd known I wouldn't.� He knew I'd stay
to see it through even though I had not known this myself until thirty seconds
ago.

&nbsp;

Within a couple
of minutes, my initial humiliation had changed to an almost drunken defiance of
what I'd always thought of as accepted social custom.� I was not only ignoring it, I was actual
defying what had always been for me �...accepted norms of behavior.�� I felt a thrill of perverse satisfaction at
what I'd done, at how far I'd gone in front of my audience.� But a quick thought pulled me out of my
satisfied reverie.� I was different now,
we both knew it.� How far would I have
voluntarily gone with Anne Marie?� I
truly didn't know what my limits were anymore.�


&nbsp;

Despite his
treatment over the last weeks and the training he'd put me through, I knew that
a few tiny kernels of pride must have still existed somewhere inside me or I
wouldn't have been so embarrassed at his first demands in and under the
booth.� I finally understood that he was
doing his best to root out what little remnants of conceit that still remained
at my core.� And as I sucked his cock in
front of the other, younger women, I finally understood.� I despised them for their weaknesses and
their desperate need, but I was no better than any of them.� I knew that if he'd possessed any of them for
two months, or even two weeks, they'd be under the table just like me, greedily
filling their mouthes with his erection.�
He was that good at leaving a woman with nothing but an aching need to satisfy
him. 

&nbsp;

When truth was
laid bare to the bone, I knew I'd valued myself too much in the past, I'd had
too much pride in who I was.� The pride
was wrong, but.........I wasn't as innocent as I sometimes wished I could
pretend.� The bare truth was that I'd
never imagined a pleasure, guilty or otherwise, that I hadn't wanted to
experience.� And I'd never experienced a
physical pleasure that I hadn't wanted more of.�
And now,somehow, he'd tapped that perverse vein of desire in me.� 

&nbsp;

Even as my face
burned in what could only be a last embarrassment before he'd taken this final
emotion away from me too, if I was absolutely truthful, if I brought to the
surface the deepest feelings I kept secret inside me and truthfully examined
what I kept hidden there, for some reason I felt a perverse sense of.....of
defiant satisfaction at what I was doing at this exact moment.� I was his whore for the evening now and we
both knew it now.� 

&nbsp;

My public side
had been so important to me before Master that I'd made almost a fetish out of
appearing as a productive member of an honorable profession.� But now I was a pariah.� I was a pariah as Rebecca Denholm and as for
tonight, for all the world knew, I was just a whore he'd picked up for a couple
of hours---and I think that's what he wanted them to think.� After all, to all outward appearances, I was
willingly doing this for him.....and I was.�
No one knew that that he'd held me captive for months in the beginning
and forced me to be this way.� He'd
changed me in that time, and I was different now.� What I now did with, and to, this man was
publically forbidden.� But because of
that, it was also exciting.� I was so
different from how the me of even two or three months ago would have acted in
public.� How far, I thought to
myself,� would he make me go
tonight?� How far, I wondered, was I
willing to go?� A thrill of excitement
chased down my spine as I thought how the men and women I'd known in the past
when I was married would look at what I was doing.

&nbsp;

Suddenly, I
felt him begin pulsing and his buttocks clench.�
Then it was over as he came in my mouth and I slowly swallowed his salty
sperm.� I rested on my knees without too
much thought as I finished cleaning him off, then I felt a quick thrill of
panic as I realized that I'd have to get back in the view of everyone and sit
next to him.� Even though I knew that I
taken him in public, I'd somehow been able to pretend for a moment that my acts
under the dark table went unseen.� For
some reason, I hadn't thought of having to re-appear next to him.� Could I do it?� How embarrassing would it be?� Would the humiliation add spice?� I calmed myself and after a few deep
breathes, most of the panicky feeling left.�
It seemed that much of the hard shell of defiance that I'd been able to
pretend I'd felt a minute ago seemed to evaporate as I crawled out from under
the table.� 

&nbsp;

I sat next to
him in a sort of defiant way.� The women
across the room had looked at me when I had first re-appeared and laughed as I
futilely tried to fix my hair where he'd been grabbing it.� They knew exactly what I was trying to do,
and were enjoying the embarrassment I felt at my lack of success.� I felt the defiance inside me build, along
with the heat of embarrassment.� I
generally tried not to be crude, but fuck them.�


&nbsp;

I thought back
to when we'd first come in, when I'd first seen them.� We'd come in and I'd followed a step behind
and to the right as I'd been taught.� I'd
been whipped too many times to do it any other way now.� As I walked in behind him,
I was conscious of being watched, yet was unable to tell which particular man
or woman since there were so many.� My gait had been in stark contrast to that of the other women we passed;
I knew I had an odd walk, but that was part of who I was.� But when we entered the door, it was me the
men watched, not them.� And every other
woman there knew it.

&nbsp;

I felt a now-familiar
inward quaver, and hoped my Master couldn't see my fear.� I waited a
couple of minutes, finishing off my drink quickly to get the taste of out of my
mouth.� In the dark under the table, I'd felt
strong, adventurous.� But now I just
wanted to crawl away, slinking out in the dark of the night.� I didn't feel confrontational right now, I
just wanted this over.� I felt like
everyone was looking at me and suddenly I couldn't take any more.� 

&nbsp;

I had to
urinate so badly that I begged Master for his permission to go to the
bathroom.� He made me wait another
minute, then he gave me permission to leave and I got up, then stumbled a
little.� I'd had too much to drink and it
was hard to walk in the ridiculous heels he always made me wear.� The bar had filled since we'd arrived and I
made my way past a lot of tightly grouped people.� The single men looked at me with an intensity
that almost frightened me, like a lion would look at fresh meat.� But if the men were with another woman,
they'd take a quick look then avoid me.�
Most women just glared at me or ignored me.� But a couple of women bumped me into me in an
aggressive sort of way, then looked at me like I had just propositioned their
dates.� But I just apologized and
continued on with my face and ears burning red.�
When I arrived, there was a line waiting for a stall to open.� I patted my hair, but knew it looked a mess.� There was nothing I could do now.� I knew that I'd had too much to drink and
would soon begin to feel sleepy.� It took
almost ten minutes and I'd finally begun to regain my composure.� When the second stall to my left opened up, I
stepped forward to go in.� 

&nbsp;

Without
warning, a young girl with short lime-green hair grabbed my wrist and dragged
me into the empty stall with her.� She
was one of those that had aggressively bumped into me outside; she slammed the
door shut behind us then pushed me up against the grungy wall tiles in one
quick move.� My mind was still buzzing
from being humiliated, I'd had three and a half drinks by now, and I was
thinking about my uncomfortably full bladder and whether a stall would open in
time to save me from absolute mortification.�
She took me totally by surprise.�
Suddenly, I felt her hot lips on mine and her tongue began to search my
mouth.� 

&nbsp;

At first I was
stunned; I just stood there as she kissed me.�
I kept waiting for someone outside to start yelling, but all any of us
could hear was the booming music.�
Suddenly, I could move again and I tried to push her away, but she was
amazingly strong and kept me pinned.� The
music was booming, echoing, crashing in my ears; my stomach was full of alcohol
and I couldn't think straight.� Finally,
I just stopped fighting her; my head was buzzing and I didn't have the
strength.� 

&nbsp;

She was
relentless and came at me again.� My mind
was blank now and I couldn't help myself.�
It was as if I watched this happening to someone else; I felt a remotely
distant sense of shock as my body somehow began to melt into hers.� I know that I reacted with confused, drunken
lust even as my mind screamed no, No, NO.��


&nbsp;

My Master had
broken me of the rules by which I'd lived my previous life; what happened next
most assuredly was his fault.� I'd never
done anything like this before; I felt both frightened and bewildered, yet
somehow tremblingly eager to experience this girl at the same time.� I felt her hands on me, all over me, finally
sliding up from my stomach, ending as she somehow opened my halter to reveal my
breasts.� Then her hands were on my butt,
pulling me towards her.� She was looking
up into my eyes before she leaned into me again and got a small smile on her
lips as she saw my breast rings.� 

&nbsp;

I tried to
stifle a moan of pure erotic lust as she lowered her head to suck on my nipples,
while her hand found its way under my skirt.�
I spread my thighs and she found me slippery with need.� She didn't know that I was still wet from
masturbating while sucking off Master.� 

&nbsp;

She slowly
massaged my breasts.� Despite my initial
reactions and the awful way it had been done, I had come to admire� the art of what Master had done to me; the
golden color and the contrast of pierced nipple against natural breast.� Not only did I find it somehow aesthetically
pleasing now, the sensations I felt when touched there were incredibly
varied.� My nipples had always been
sensitive and I knew without a doubt now that his piercings had increased the
sensitivity a hundred-fold.� The
green-haired girl drove me wild with sudden, unexpected lust.� 

&nbsp;

There were
women waiting just outside and I stifled my moans at first, then I was forced
to cry out softly; she was rougher now as she played with my clit before she
flicked it with her fingertip and sucked hard on my nipple at the same time.�� The pain cut through the mental fog and
somehow it felt wonderful.� 

&nbsp;

Even though
other women had seen her enter the stall with me, we were in our own private
world right now.� Besides, no one could
hear me over the music anyway.� My Master
had done these things to me; why not her too?�
I could scream to my heart's content and we would still be alone.�� And so I let this unknown have me.

&nbsp;

I ran my
fingers through her hair and began to pull her face to me; somehow I knew she
needed to be kissed.� But instead I threw
my head back in order to moan; her fingers were pushing inside me now and
forced my thighs even further apart.� She
expertly finger fucked me, dipping them in a practiced motion that told me she
was skilled at making other women cum.� 

&nbsp;

Suddenly, an
errant thought ran through my mind; my bladder was killing me and I really
wasn't up for this, was I?� But nobody
had told her; the girl's fingers made my pussy feel as hot as molten lava and
as she continued, I suddenly realized that she had found my G-spot.� She pushed me again until my back was against
the wall and I could go no further, then she worked between my thighs with two
fingers perfectly curled to put her fingertips right where she knew I wanted
them most.� I tried to tell her how good
it felt, but my voice had gone, leaving me speechless in the thunderous racket
of the club.

&nbsp;

I pulled her to
me again and kissed her on the lips.� As
she pushed deeper inside me, I could feel the pressure increasing against my
full bladder; the girl's fingers rhythmically tormenting me, slamming my
insides.� But something about the motion
was over-working my G-spot, stimulating it, making it feel wondrous despite the
pain of my now bursting bladder.� She slid
my skirt up around my waist and I could feel the cold tile of the wall against
my bare ass.� 

&nbsp;

But reality
surfaced again and hit quickly; I managed to spread my feet as far apart as
possible, for suddenly I couldn't hold it in any longer and a gush of urine hit
the floor beneath me.� I thought I would
die from embarrassment, but she didn't seem to care.� She stopped and backed off for a second.� Suddenly, I was empty and the flow trickled
to a stop.� The pee slowly moved towards
a stopped up drain, then pooled there.�
But the girl never stopped, suddenly going to one knee on the wet
concrete and leaning in towards my pussy.�
I spread my thighs for her again as I felt her hot, sucking mouth
suddenly envelope me.

&nbsp;

I threw my head
back and screamed in pure, unexpected pleasure as she began lapping at me and
sucking on my clit.� When she put her
fingers back inside me again, my knees suddenly felt weak; I frantically
grabbed for anything that I could hold and that would allow me to remain
standing.� No matter how I moved, her
mouth followed my pussy.� Finally, I was
braced with my back in the corner as she began to work me again.� Her tongue was on my clit as her fingers
rhythmically pumped in and out.� My
bladder had emptied, but she still had pressure on my G-spot; I couldn't help
myself, I knew I was cumming and it was a big one.� Even as I threw my head back and screamed my
joy, I knew this had to be one of the crudest and most tawdry encounters that
could ever have been imagined; my panties were gone and I was standing in my
own urine, pushed up against the wall of a nasty toilet stall as I allowed an
unknown woman to have oral sex with me.

&nbsp;

The girl's face
was buried between my thighs and I could see that her free hand was buried
inside her pants.� The sensation for me
now was so intense that it was almost too exquisite to bear, but suddenly, if
it was possible, something about what she was doing aroused me even more.� I grabbed a handful of her hair and pulled
her face back enough so that I could reach down and spread my labia even wider
for her wonderful, long tongue.� Before
Master, I had been rather conservative during sex, rarely making a lot of
appreciative noise; never screaming and forcing myself to keep my pleasure
limited to moans or groans.� But he had
made me learn to give voice to my pleasure, often during sex but sometimes due
just to the pain.� And I had learned to
appreciate expressing myself this way---and tonight I did.� I threw my head back and screamed, a howl of
pure pleasure at the top of my lungs as the girl's tongue forced one continuous
orgasm after another from my body.� 

&nbsp;

The
green-haired one must have felt me cumming again, because after about a minute,
she finally stood up and lifted her hand to her mouth, then put her fingers in
my mouth so that I could lick her fingers and taste myself.� I leaned against the wall, legs shaking,
totally spent as I sucked on her fingers.�
My body tingled all over, my legs felt like wet noodles and I knew that
I couldn't walk right now.� Then she was
done.� She kissed me one more time on the
lips.� A hard and violent kiss that told
me she had gotten what she wanted from me.�
Then she turned and left me standing in my own urine, my skirt up around
my waist and my top opened to expose my breasts.

&nbsp;

I was shaken
physically, but even more so emotionally.�
I had never before done anything like this and would probably never
again.� But for tonight, for just this
one night, it had been incredible.� He'd
forced me to satisfy him from male selfishness, but she had done this for just
pleasure.� I knew that I could go back to
Master now and he would never have to know.

&nbsp;

Even after
having experienced so much of life, I knew I was still quite naive in some
ways.� I felt some shame at having
allowed what had just happened.� But to
my great surprise, I also felt a sense of guilty exhilaration; an awkward
feeling of elation that ran through every fiber of my being at having just
experienced a piece of life that I'd never realized existed before having been
acquired by this man.

&nbsp;

What was wrong
with me?� What was happening to me?

&nbsp;

It took me
another five or ten minutes to pull myself back together.� I had no purse or clutch, no brush and no
makeup.� After I put my clothes back
together, I left the stall and just stood in front of a mirror.� A couple of the younger girls looked at me
with sardonic smiles, but I ignored them.�
Eventually, I was able to walk again.�
When I finally slid in next to Master, he had an annoyed, impatient look
on his face.� All I wanted to do was see
if I could find the green-haired girl on the dance floor.� God, what a night!

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I love to dance; it was
around 9 PM and the dance floor was hot.�
A new song was just beginning and I swayed with the music.� It'd taken Rasha a long time to take a piss
and she now was acting odd.� It was
starting to piss me off a little, but it was impossible to stay angry as long
as the throbbing beat pummeled my ears.� 

&nbsp;

The music having finally
won, I was in a better mood again; it was a slow song so I took her hand and
pulled her to her feet.� Her hair was
falling down now from the sort of bun she'd put it in earlier and she held back
for a second, but I pulled harder and finally we instinctively glided to the
nearest spot that had enough room for two. We got into position and paused,
taking a moment to feel each other as well as the beat. She was hesitant at
first, but I led her into a conversation without words.� She turned out to be a good dancer and our
bodies quickly adapted to each other as we moved through the song, our eyes
almost always in contact. Normally, I would have preferred a little more demure
performance, but not tonight.� Although
she followed my lead, there was little passivity on her part as we danced.� In the pause after a turn, I moved into an erotic
step that was divided equally between approach and retreat, my knee driven
between her thighs.� Dominance and
submission.� Control and freedom.� In a few moments, our lips were so close that
I could almost taste my slave's sweat. Then I whisked her into an extreme
dip.� As I expected, she indulged me
perfectly, the loose strands of her hair nearly touching the floor in perfect
abandon.

&nbsp;

Could anyone ever deny the
connection between sex and dancing? 

&nbsp;

As I have
gotten older, I better understand that dancing is about submission and control;
communicating with your partner, dominating and guiding their every move, then
letting go to see if they understood the required servility. Many of the same
dynamics apply to sex.� I controlled
Rasha's body now; we'd connected first in bed and now again on the dance
floor.� She finally seemed to be her
normal sexy self, an obedient slave again.�
But she must have begun to feel the music in her bones, because with the
change of a single song, she suddenly became a true dance floor slut.� 

&nbsp;

She was never
obvious or coarse, but a few times she moved against me in such an erotic way,
I thought that I'd almost orgasm on the dance floor.� Dancing with Rasha at that moment was almost
as good as having sex with her.� And as
we touched, feelings and emotions started coming to both of us naturally as we
moved.� Her pelvis and flat, tight belly
moved in an unhurried fashion, slowly but irresistibly grinding into me.� At the end of that dance, we both had an
unspoken agreement that it was time to leave.�
My headache had returned somewhat.�
The music had found at the end the rhythm of the blood pounding in my
temples and every sound suddenly had a serrated edge.� I slowly led her into the night, preceded
only by my erection; I could hardly wait to get back to our room for the rest
of the night.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

As we left, I looked around for the green-haired girl, but she was
gone.� Instead, it seemed as if everyone
knew what we had done.� People looked at
me now as we passed them; as if I walked like I wanted somehow to be noticed or
smiled like I wanted to be used.� I knew
that some of the men here would do anything for me---or to me---if I let
them.�� Many men undressed me with their
eyes as we walked by them.� I didn't mind
being admired, but there were other things that men could do with their
eyes.� These were the ones that had
little fingers attached to their eyes and when they stared at me, I could feel
them crawling all over me greasily.�
They�re the ones that thought the world�s full of whores.� Their dead faces and unspoken thoughts left
me cold with a feeling of numb detachment.�
Fuck them.� I didn�t crave their
acceptance or their avarice or their needs anymore.�� All I needed was Master.�� Master, telling me that it was alright to do
the things he did to me because my mouth asked for it now.�� But inside, I knew my mind was in the palm
of his hand.�� And this was as it should
be.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

�The whips I
used on you,� I explained to Rasha, �are fashioned from the cords of
love.�� It was bullshit, but it sounded
good at the moment.� 

&nbsp;

As usual, I
enjoyed the hell out of our love-making, but as usual, there was no love in
it.� I laid down The Discipline
and looked at my woman as she lay on the bed, her back and ass bearing a new
series of red welts.� She was good at
helping me relax.� Real good.� Sex was only another form of wielded power
and I had no qualms about using it on her ass.�
It helped me relax and it was good for her ego.� Yes, she was very nice to have around to
satisfy my needs.� 

&nbsp;

Uttering a soft
involuntary sound of pleasure, I first unhooked the improvised gag I'd made her
wear before I pushed her onto her back.�
Then I spread her thighs wide, using my thumbs to part the petals that
were her lips.� As I did this, I watched
her face instead of her pussy.� I liked
the way Rasha�s face seemed to change as I touched her, those light blue eyes
closing slightly, seeming sleepy or perhaps just suddenly relaxed from the
endorphin high.� I continued to probe
her, stroking her brand, playing with her as I used my fingertips on her clit
or brushed against it and made her move to my music.� Even after several months, I realized that
her body was still amazing to me. 

&nbsp;

She was hot and
moist and ready.� I was on my knees at
the edge of the bed now and I moved between her thighs, quickly impaling her
with my cock.� Rasha shuddered as I
entered her.� The back of her knees were
resting against the back of my thighs and her feet met between my legs.� I could feel my wave of need rush through her
body, dominating her, ending with the tight inner muscles of her vagina
contracting on me like sheets of unending moist fire.

&nbsp;

I worked her,
sliding back and forth in the wonderfully satisfying slickness between her
thighs, bucking against her, driving into her with my entire being.� I grabbed her face and made her look at me,
but she didn't really see me.� She was
totally inside herself as I fucked her.�
Rasha took it all in, everything that I did to her and processed it,
just as she processed the pain she knew I would always give her.� And she understood; knowing that her body
would always capitulate to my needs well before her mind.

&nbsp;

When my cock
was finally coated with her satiny juices, I pulled out and ordered her to
clean me.� Rasha obeyed instantly,
understanding exactly what I wanted even though I am sure she would have
preferred to have me cum inside her.� She
was quickly on her hands and knees, bent low on the bed as she took me into her
mouth; deep into the velvety heat of her mouth, lapping at the juices from her
most feminine area that now dripped from the tip to the base of my cock.� Her hair was down now and I wrapped my hand
in it, ensuring that she found my rhythm, moving her mouth up and down, back
and forth.� I was happy for once and told
her how proud I was of her tonight.

&nbsp;

Rasha looked up
at me and murmured an answer, but her voice was muffled, her words slurred
around the cock that completely filled her mouth.� I stroked her beautiful muscled back, feeling
her muscles tensing and sliding beneath her finely pored skin.� She swallowed harder, trying to take me all
the way down her throat, trying to devour me.�
I could tell that her only concern tonight was pleasuring me just as
she�d finally admitted to herself that she�d relinquished all previous claims
to any power or equality between the sexes.

&nbsp;

For one
fleeting moment, I thought about turning my bitch onto her back, straddling her
chest and feeding her my cock inch by inch�
I knew that the position would ensure that she took it down her throat
until her lips met my groin.� The thought
had just entered my mind over when suddenly I exploded.� I was torn, satisfied at the great sex.� But disappointed, because I�d finally decided
I wanted to mouth-fuck her, then roll her over and cum on her naked back,
covering with my semen the raised red welts she now wore with pride.� Covering her pain with my bliss.� When I had my breath back, I knew that I
needed to get out a few of the more serious toys I had brought with me.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

She looked up at from under her eyelashes with eyes that were
moist with pain.� She snuggled in closer
against my chest and sobbed softly once in momentary misery, the waves of pain
becoming less by the second.� After a
minute or so, her eyes were soft and wet, still full of the confusion brought
on by her endorphin high.� The haughty
bitch of tonight with the surface patina of arrogant disinterest was gone, and
in her place was my sweet pain-slut.� The
woman that had been taught her lessons in pain once more, the woman who had
finally learned to love being hurt by me.

&nbsp;

As in every day for the preceding month, she had willingly
cooperated; yet I had still intentionally hurt her a lot tonight in the motel
room.� Rasha had not voiced concern about
our neighbors hearing us---she wasn't bound right now, but I'd gagged her too quickly
for much noise to have escaped our room.�
I'm pretty sure that she understood why I got such pleasure out of
causing her pain.� But I think that what
was confusing Rasha was her reaction to being hurt; she couldn't understand why
the idea of being tortured bothered her so much less now.� That was the question; she could understand
someone being able to handle pain, but why was there pleasure in it for her now
too?� The answer to both questions was
the same as why she found pain to be an aphrodisiac---the need was in both of
us.�� 

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

Later, after he'd finished for the night, I lay next to him and my
mind lit up with the memories of what I'd done tonight.� The remembrance was unreal, another TV show
unspooling in my mind.� Someone else had
done that.� No, it hadn't been me.� At least in my mind, I tried to run away from
the truth, but the truth kept catching up.�
The memories wouldn't go away.�
There was the table, and there was the girl, and everything he did to me
afterwards.......I had changed so much in such a short time.�� 

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

She didn�t come from a particularly happy home and seemed to have
developed a pathological fear of relationships---scared they�d turn out like
her parent's.� She was like me; she'd
broken everything she'd ever touched, no matter how well intentioned she
was.� 

&nbsp;

I thought about what she must be experiencing as a new
slave-whore.� It was like an idealized
despair.� Any life-altering experience
like she�d undergone must begin with a moment of transforming truth.� For her, the pain was part of it, for no
great insight is gained without a price.�
This was the ordeal she'd needed to go through, to prove it worthy.� Rasha seemed to have understood this at an
instinctive level, but yet consciously fought it some of the time, even
now---and as a result, what should have been an exquisite moment of truth could
still be quickly shattered into falsehood and shame and even bitter
comedy.� 

&nbsp;

But with the passage of enough time and my assistance, her
experiences and feelings had become irrefutable truth again, and the broken mirror
flowed together as though it were liquid.�
The nasty parts were eroded away in her memory, leaving behind only the
marble white bones of her personal truths; a beautiful certainty of her need to
belong to me that was beyond proof.�
That�s where she was now, facing the certain proof of her own body and
mind.� She had become a woman that would
do almost anything once, and most things as often as she could.

&nbsp;

And for Rasha, that meant in some ways she had become almost a
human Barbie-Doll now.� As arrogant as
she could appear on the surface to others, once she knew it was play mode, she
became passive and docile, waiting for me to decide what she would be for me
and to me, making only minor suggestions or improvising to increase the depth
my experience.� And afterwards, she was
always anxious until assured that she had been both pleasing and had pleased
me.� I dressed her up and positioned her
in any way I desired.� Then I would force
her to first scream and then finally beg, and when I was finished with that, I
used her as we both knew she deserved to be used.� And afterwards, when the little girl voice
appeared, I knew her mind was exactly where I wanted it once again.� Then I would use her once more, regardless of
the pain I caused.� No matter what my
demands, she submissively accepted it all now.

&nbsp;

God, she was a fucking sex machine now; a sponge that offered
sexual release and sucked up pain and humiliation and sexual degradation,
burning through everything I did and turning it into fuel that only fed her need
and desire. 

&nbsp;

Part of it was physiological.�
As I conditioned her mind to feel a need for what I did, she became more
and more addicted to the natural high that resulted.� All I had to do now was touch her lightly
between her legs and she was immediately wet and ready.� No Pavlov's dog had ever learned to respond
more expertly than Rasha.� She performed
superbly, ever more willing to give anything demanded in order to feel that
obsessive endorphin rush one more time.� 

&nbsp;

At the same time, much of it was psychological.� Because of what we did or perhaps in spite of
it, it was clear that she now increasingly needed to know that she had
satisfied me, that I was pleased with her actions.� My quick nod of approval had become her
ultimate goal.� I was the main figure in
her life---I was the only figure in her life now; I was the one from whom she
required absolute reassurance that I approved of her, that I loved her for what
she did and what she was.� And finally,
for what she had become.� 

&nbsp;

She was always looking for new ways to please me.� Now reading the history of BDSM, she had
developed a habit of surprising me in some of the things she asked to do or
have done to her.� Everything I did to
Rasha now drove her into an erotic frenzy.�
She consumed it all; converting everything, ever horrible thing I did to
her, into a frenzied sexual energy that only I could tap and relieve.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

Things were
not always so serious between us.� I
served him in the living room tonight, crawling to him on all fours and still
balancing his tray of food.� When I was
next to him, he gave me permission to stand and I did without spilling
anything.� This was more difficult than
it sounds, and I had become very proud of my ability.� Afterwards, I cleaned up and as a treat, he
allowed me to stay with him in the living room.�
He was in a good mood and we lay on the couch side by side.� We were both naked and he was drinking Irish
whiskey, giving me only tastes every now and then.� Master had a little too much to drink and it
had seemed funny at the time for him to take on an Irish character.� He grabbed my chin and intoned, �Tis the
blood o� a virgin princess I fancy.�

&nbsp;

Giggling, I
immediately got into character.� �Well,
you�re out of luck with me then, Master.�
I�m common as muck.� Not a good
princess, nor even a virgin.�

&nbsp;

�Oh well,�
he finished as he settled onto me.� �It�s
the horn of abundance I�ve got, and I�m a-giving it to you anyway.�� And he did, twice.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

It had taken
me only a few minutes to learn the posture and language he required, but days
and weeks of clenched jaw and gritted teeth before the words smoothly flowed
off my tongue---Master�.Mistress�..Please Sir�..May I have permission�..� For some reasons, being deferential at all
times and assuming the correct body language he desired was even more
difficult.� I understood what he wanted,
but I earned continual punishment from him for over six weeks before I
understood why�..be respectful; periodically lower your eyes in deference�..when
given an order, do your best to comply immediately�..when in public, (if that
ever happened again), stand just behind his elbow, so that he was slightly in
front of me�.thank him for every privilege Master granted me---and so much
more.� We each had well defined roles and
responsibilities to the other, and I was learning mine.� It had just taken me a long time.

&nbsp;

Soon,
through constant use and his continued reinforcement in the White Room, it
became so much easier to accompany my actions with the appropriate
language.� Following my submission at the
end of the fifth week, I found myself unconsciously using the language of the
slave all the time.� It was such a
seductively easy way to give up all responsibility for my actions.

&nbsp;

One evening
we were sitting in the living room talking.�
The almost radioactive rage of before was long gone.� I had not only accepted my life, I almost
gloried in it now.� And so I listened
more closely than would have been normal even just a few days ago.� He already knew me too well.

&nbsp;

�Close your
eyes,� he said.� �You�re here until I
choose to let you go.� You're the way you
are and nothing can change that.� You
were a rule-breaker.� Following the rules
is always simpler; by doing so you avoid the remorse and blame that comes with
disobeying them.� And although you didn�t
go nearly far enough, you've still experimented more than most with pain and
sex.� Regardless of what I say now,
you're going to keep on testing the limits of both sex and submission from this
point on.� And you know why?� Because you�ve been awakened to the
possibilities inside you and you�re curious.�
Now that you�re aware of how different you are, you want to know what�s
within you.�

&nbsp;

He thumped
me softly on the chest, �There.�� And
then again softly below my belly button, �And there.�

&nbsp;

�You know
something?� You just cannot imagine how
alike we are, you and me.� I know exactly
what�s going on in your head.� To
understand this, you�ve got to tap into your true nature; feel it, it's almost
like everything�s speeding up inside you.�
There's a darkness there---an acceptance of pain that pushes you over
the edge from physical enjoyment to pure ecstasy---look hard and you�ll see
it.� Concentrate.� You see it?�
Call to it.� Let it fill you.�

&nbsp;

I obediently
closed my eyes as he began, but I wasn�t drugged now and wasn�t on his horse,
so his descriptions seemed like a bunch of crap to me.� Nothing.�
I didn�t see or feel anything like what he described.

&nbsp;

�One day,
one day soon, you�ll give me the secret you hide inside.� And you know what?�

&nbsp;

I dropped my
hands and looked at him.� �What, Master?�

&nbsp;

�It won�t
even be a big deal.� Because�..� he
looked at me and his eyes gleamed, ��.because you and me, we�re the same.� Like me, you�ve got to accept your nature
before you can control it.� Open yourself
to it; let it fill you---accept it as part of you.� But know that if you question or doubt them,
these desires will destroy you.�

&nbsp;

�Rasha, say
it; say, �this is a part of me; this is a part of who I am.��

&nbsp;

With my eyes
still closed, I said, �This is a part of me; this is a part of who I am.�� Saying this a couple of more times under my
breath, I began to concentrate on what he was saying rather than my first
superficial reactions.� Always before, I
had been able to reach an almost unbearable plateau of pleasure when he allowed
me drugs before he used me hard.� Later,
after I had been shown the path by a combination of his drugs and his
equipment, I was able to achieve something approximating these feelings without
the drugs.� But even as I achieved this
absolutely exquisite link with the pain, I knew that these sensations, the
places in my mind that I visited under their influence, would later flee.� My mind and my heart told me they were too
intense, too strong for normal life and must be remembered and experienced only
on special occasions.� 

&nbsp;

After a
couple of minutes, I think I finally began to have a glimmer of
understanding.� My life had been a mess,
and I didn�t want all of the details that it had entailed.� I found I had gladly given up all of that to
a Dominant man that I could trust and respect.�
Too, Master was talking about the unique sexual release I felt when I
was used in a rough, physical manner.�
When I'd finally admitted the truth of this about myself, finally
succumbing to this need, forceful, even brutal foreplay almost always for me
led to the most satisfying sex now.� 

&nbsp;

Despite my
earlier misgivings, I'd learned that my anus was a highly sensitive area with
huge erogenous potential, providing ample opportunity for Master to experiment
with my sexual arousal.� I knew now that
anal sex was a natural permutation of human sexuality, little different from
oral sex.� For me, having Master drive
into my rectum indirectly stimulated my vagina and I could finally appreciate
the subtle differences.� The muscles of
my anus contracted on him during orgasm and I'd found that the presence of a
man filling me, forcing my sphincter open with his cock actually strengthened
the sensations of the contractions and intensified my orgasm.� Somehow every fiber and every tissue in my body
shook with a red-hot release when taken like that.� But I would never allow myself to be fisted
again.

&nbsp;

Rough sex
that hurt and was physically demeaning---up to a point---was now the best for
me; I ached and throbbed at the receiving of pain.� I had not known this about myself a month
ago, and the clear recognition of this truth scared me.

&nbsp;

Suddenly, I had a
realization that rocked my world and turned it upside down.� I had already accepted his dominance as
something I could no longer fight.� But
now, I realized for the first time that I also needed this man.� I'd never before needed a man in this way; I
may have wanted a man, but I'd NEVER needed a man like this before.� I needed him for what he did to me; for the
way he made me feel.� God!� Why now, why him?

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

That night for the first time, Rasha gave a couple of subtle hints
about mounting the horse.� Unsure if I
was reading her signals correctly, I asked point-blank what she wanted.� She hesitated for a long while and then
blushed as she gave a small nod with her head.�
Surprised, I searched her face for a second.� In her eyes I could see mostly fear; but with
it was an obviously hungry look; a subtle, subliminal longing that she'd always
done her best to ignore.� I knew at that
moment that she was truly mine.� And
because it was something upon which we both knew she needed to experiment, I
set it up for her and then waited impatiently.�


&nbsp;

Rasha stepped up and threw her right leg over the horizontal beam,
but kept her weight on her left foot.�
After a moment�s hesitation, she grimaced and finally mounted it; both
feet now off the ground.� She leaned
forward and put her hands on the bar in front of her, lifting her pelvis a
little off the polished wood.� Slowly,
gingerly, with her eyes closed, she lowered herself onto the varnished beam;
every pound of her body that was taken by the lumber was accompanied by a soft,
drawn out groan from her parted lips.�
She hissed in pain.� Finally,
Rasha rested fully on the horse and her toes pointed stiffly towards the floor,
missing it by at least four inches.�
Within about fifteen seconds her nipples were each the size of the tip
of my small finger.� She moaned once
again softly and remained frozen in place for a minute or two.� Then she began to slowly writhe and undulate
on the beam, grinding her crotch into it with a small, slow, circular movement
that eventually grew bolder and more obvious with increasing need.� 

&nbsp;

She drove me wild.� She was
panting now and sweating in the most interesting places.� Rasha froze again for a second and then her
knees and feet began making small quick jerking movements to the front, each
move dragging her labia and clit back and forth over the polished wood.� Suddenly, she shuddered once all over, then
raised her face towards the ceiling even though her eyes were closed.� Finally, she licked her lips and climbed
off.� She was still panting when she
turned to me with a slight smile and thanked me!� My God, was I turned on!

&nbsp;

I dragged her to the bed in her room.� She was incredible.� Her body consumed mine that night.� Astride me, she made low breathing sounds of
craving, head back, eyes closed, her face a mask of shadow and light.� Her fingers knew male sensitivities
intimately and understood where tiny collectives of neurons lay beneath
skin.� They played them delicately at
first, then with great demand.� When we
finished the first time, we lay next to each other.� After a few minutes she rolled onto me, then
nuzzled at my chest.� She snuggled a
little closer, which I wouldn't have thought was possible.� But not only was it possible, it was
perfectly delightful.� It seemed as it
went on like this for hours, but finally I was exhausted.� Nothing however, seemed to faze her, she was
tireless.� What a beautiful, wonderful,
sex machine.� 

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

At first it hurt.� My legs dangled
below me uselessly; I had pinched my labia against the wood and it caused great
pain in the beginning.� But I adjusted my
seat and then held myself motionless for a minute to build my courage.� Finally, I began to move my hips slowly and
ground myself against the irresistible force I felt building inside me.� Soon, it blossomed into so much more.� I kept moving and suddenly I was consumed in a
moist, rose pink eternity.� At the end, I
found I was kicking with my feet and knees and thighs; and my lungs sucked for
air that I could not find.� I was
sweating and in pain, and it felt wonderful. 

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

It was
mid-February evening around 9 PM.� I
looked out as Master Christian stood lost in thought on the back patio, staring
out at the lake.� It was a clear cool
evening, the moon was bright as it played hide and seek beneath the clouds;
rain was expected.� He had been out there
for over fifteen minutes wearing only pajama bottoms and a T-shirt.� As I looked at him all I could think of was
that he looked so lost.

&nbsp;

He allowed
me more freedom now, so I walked out to him with a blanket.� As I threw it over his shoulders, I felt an
uncomfortable surge of tenderness towards him.�
He had been as good as his word; teaching me about my emotional,
physical and sexual needs.� And in
fairness to him, although I had submitted to him almost a month ago, I knew I
still sometimes acted like a child.� My
behavior had tested his patience time and time again.� And when I did this, he punished me; as now
seemed only right.� He had been angry
with me for the first few days, but after that he never seemed to react in
anger.� He would always wait a little
while before he decided what to do.� It
took me almost a month to understand what he was doing, but when I did, I
appreciated it all the more.� He was not
a bad man, at least to me.� 

&nbsp;

The rain
soon started and he came in.� He had gone
to bed now.� My shower was scalding hot
when I stepped in.� I liked the heat.� It made me feel clean.� I had scented the cubicle with fragrant oil
and as I closed my eyes, the smell and the warmth enfolded me.� I had ridden the horse two nights ago and
could feel the heat soaking through the soreness between my thighs.� I shuddered when it entered me, and the pain
and stiffness seemed to dissolve after a minute.� I floated in the steam.� When I was done, I stepped out and after I
had dried myself, I brushed my hair until it fell like a river of liquid silver
down my back.� I used a soft scent then;
a touch on each wrist, behind my ears and on the tips of my breasts.� The last dab was for my sex.� My fingers felt as light and cool as a
lover�s kiss as they slid between my lips.�
Finally, I put on a very short, sheer black nightie that he had left me
a few days ago.� The collar and the nose
ring were already in place and I was ready.

&nbsp;

The doors
into the house had been left unlocked for two weeks now.� The room was lit by moonlight as I went to
his bed.� I found him still awake, hands
clasped behind his head, staring at the ceiling.� He turned to face me as I stood by the bed,
the moon at my back.

&nbsp;

�You don�t
have to do this,� he said.

&nbsp;

�I know,
Master.� I know.�� I slowly pulled off the nightie, knowing that
he was watching me, trying to think about what he was thinking, trying not to
think of anything at all except the moment.�
He said nothing more.� Finally
naked, I purposely stood in front of him.�
I waited like this for a moment, letting him see me, wanting him to see
everything that I was, simple in the moonlight.�
And then I got into bed with him.�


&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I felt insanely calm, aware that something truly frightening was
happening to me and for once I wasn�t afraid.�
Who could be afraid of the angel/little girl that had approached my
bed?� I rose on my elbows and lifted my
head to consider the rain, which still drummed down outside.� I wiped my face with one hand.� 

&nbsp;

She had changed over the weeks.�
But I knew there was still something inside her that I wasn't sure I
could reach.� What it was I couldn't say:
regret over being forced to change her life as she accepted a new role?� A deep-seated, yet barely realized bitterness
at how she had been treated in this new life; perhaps sorrow over the normal
life, the family, that she had been forced to give up and which now would be denied
her forever?

&nbsp;

She tended to use the term Master pretty much exclusively now,
rather than the more formal Sir.� She
always maintained the proper attitude, but there were times when I wasn't sure
how deeply she meant this term of respect.�
Sometimes when she said Master, in some ways, it seemed as if there was
just the slightest tone of mockery?� As
if we were in on some universal joke that only the two of us recognized as
amusing.� Or perhaps only she was in on
the joke?� But then, there was my
bottom's other side.� These were the
times that she willingly rode the horse, or mounted the T-cross and hung bound
from it while I whipped her, or lay bound in front of me, profoundly
appreciative of every foul thing I did to her.�
Her tone then was that of the servile bottom willingly accepting, even
grateful for what I gave her.

&nbsp;

Rasha stood silently closer to the bed.� She slowly stripped for me and the light from
behind turned her hair into a rippling halo, accentuating the curve of her hips
and the muscles of her thighs.� She
considered me for a long moment, an unreadable expression on her face.� �I�m your prisoner here.� 

&nbsp;

�You�re my slave,� I replied.�
�There�s a lot of difference.�

&nbsp;

�Master, I suppose I am,� she said carefully, hesitating for a
long minute.� �But I may as well be of
use to somebody, don�t you think?� And
it�s not so bad.�� 

&nbsp;

Then she climbed in with me and I covered her mouth with my
own.� I�d had enough talk; I needed the
simplicity of the pleasure that I found between Rasha�s thighs.� Here, I knew that I was finally welcome.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

For a
moment, I felt very young as I brushed against the hot, dry skin of his hip and
then it was too late.� He reached out and
put his hand on my belly and I turned to him.�
I mounted him and he slipped immensely into me as though he had belonged
there from the beginning.� He began to
move and I moved with him and nothing that he had done to me mattered
anymore.� I didn�t know if I was doing
this for him or for myself.� Nothing
mattered at all except right now and that was enough for both of us.� 

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

Rasha slid down and kissed me, very gently but full on the lips,
parting my mouth with her tongue.�
Suddenly she clamped her mouth on mine, and we wrestled as lightning
flashed and thunder boomed outside.� I
had never before learned to really kiss before acquiring this female.� She liked to kiss and leaned down to kiss me
now; I kissed back with an unaccustomed expertise.� It became a very long kiss, quite steamy;
going from zero to sixty in nothing flat.�
I ran my hands along her spectacular body.� Our eyes met.�
For a hushed moment there was a perfect mutual understanding I could
never have put in words, the most profound intimacy, and the overwhelming
conviction that she was so right for me. 

&nbsp;

She somehow lowered herself even further onto me and began to
move.� I worked her nipples and breasts
in the brutal way she had learned to like; she moaned and began to speed
up.� I put my hands on her hips and tried
to slow her down, but could not.� It went
on and on and on; one or the other of us always slowing down just enough to
ensure that it would not stop.� At the
end, I groaned and that sound was what seemed to send her over the edge.� Finally, she rolled off of my sweaty
belly.� �God, God,� I gasped at the end,
fighting to control the shudders that still ran through me.� Rasha lay silent next to me, hugging herself
tightly.� We�d had sex for hours and it
had been wonderful.� 

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

He filled me
to overflowing.� The sensations seemed
almost like a power surge that overwhelmed the senses, as if somehow all of the
lights everywhere burned brighter.� I had
cum the first time and it had been like a supernova.� My nipples were sore and bruised, but I
didn�t know if I had screamed or not.�
Indeed, I wasn�t aware of anything at all that moment except a
transcendence for which no words existed, or could exist-----for words could
describe only that which lay with the realm of familiar senses.� 

&nbsp;

We made love for at least an hour; exhausted, we finally
stopped.� But he was soon hard
again.� He pulled me down next to him again and touched me all over; all slow
and light, and the feel of his breath on my cheek was so soft.� It was so hard to think.� Then he stopped the caresses and hugged me; I
rolled into his arms.� I felt how warm his
skin was, and smooth, and how parts of him were soft and others were not
because of his muscle.� 

&nbsp;

It didn't take much to
start me again.� He must have sensed how
I moved, because his leg moved, his knee slid a bit between mine and then
up.� I made a small sound and tried to
move---because all the heat in my body was moving to two places---my brain and
below my hips.� It felt nice.� I ached.�
And I wanted to roll over and hug the pillow and stop feeling down
there.� Or something.� But I didn't.

&nbsp;

His knee moved again.� Not an accident.� And he was soothing me with his voice and his
hand on my back, so I started to move against his leg.� It was an awkward dance and didn't last
long.� Then he entered me and it went on
for another hour.� I couldn't help it at the
end when all the suns in the galaxy seemed to flare behind my eyes, flood my
limbs and burn me to the core.� And
afterwards, the cold of space.� Except
that he hugged me.� I was damp and weak
and embarrassed; and I lay in his arms, totally his.� When he released me, as always, I felt the
pressure of his grasp long after our flesh had parted.� What I wanted to do, beyond all reason, was
to push my hands through his silky mass of hair and pull him to me, shattering twenty
years of self-discipline with a single kiss.�
Wipe away anything that might have been inspired by any other woman and
replace it with only that inspired by me.

&nbsp;

And then,
like the spots you see when you�ve looked at the sun, that indescribable
supra-sensory radiance began to fade.�
Gradually, I became aware of my physical surroundings again, taking note
of one thing at a time.� My breasts felt
heavy and bruised, and my nipples ached in delicious counterpoint to the
tingling I felt in my pussy.� I hesitated
as my heart skipped a beat and a reenergizing warmth pumped through my
veins.� I pulled in a deep breath,
another, and waited for my throat to unclench so that I could speak
normally.� Time passed as I practiced not
looking at him.� But even as the
sensations began to fade, I tried to lock them forever into my memory.� Lovers, I now truly knew, never forget.

&nbsp;

And so, not
for the first time since I willingly walked into the dark unknown of slavery, I
thought, is this it?� Is this who I
really am?� In the end I think, for me,
wearing his collar was just a wake-up call for the rest of my life.� And just like that, I'd become this man�s
willing slave.� 

&nbsp;

I was born
again, but now into a role that I didn�t even think existed anymore in
America.� I had changed so much over the
last weeks and months.� I could never go
back for I was too altered by what he'd done to me.� The distance between what I'd been and what I
had become was too great---unbridgeable, and the dissonance between the two a
constant reminder of what I wanted so badly to forget.

&nbsp;

He was a
strong man; he had created me and he was therefore superior to me, at least in
this.� I truly cared for him; he could
steal my heart away now by just walking by.�
I could not imagine what it would be like to have this man�s daily
attentions for the rest of my life, to make love to him every day, or even just
sleep next to him every night.� To do
everything in my power to make him happy.�
But even as I hated myself for these obviously incorrect feelings, I
also knew that I desperately wanted to stay with him forever.� But I was finding out that he did things in
his own time and would not be pushed.�
Even to explain anything to me would be to serve only his purposes, not
mine.

&nbsp;

I fell
asleep in his arms.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I fell asleep from sheer
exhaustion.� I woke up once.� Rasha was sleeping next to me snoring softly,
her legs spread wide and one thigh exposed by a tug of the sheet.� I looked at her tousled beauty for five
minutes before I fell asleep again.� 

&nbsp;

I sat up quickly in the
soft, morning light.� Rasha reached up to
pull me down next to her.� God, she was
beautiful.� She didn't even have to work
at it; she just was.� Her eyes were
sleepy, her hair a mess, and she looked absolutely stunning.� I kissed her forehead.� 

&nbsp;

I yawned.� However long I slept, it hadn't been long
enough.� Like most men, I wake up with a
hard-on, so it�s natural that I want to fuck the woman in bed with me first
thing in the morning.� But I'm also
convinced that I'm finally beginning to learn Rasha's nature, for every time
our eyes met like this, I knew that she wanted me to fuck her.� But she didn't have any choice in the
matter.� I liked to keep her humming with
tension during the day and sometimes I wouldn't respond; it drove her nuts.

�

Sexual tension I've found,
is often a true rush, a powerful force of nature.� For me it could just be as fleeting as a few
flirtatious moments of furtive glances between a strange woman and myself while
getting coffee at Starbucks, or as expansive as the almost magnetic connection
stretched out over months between a couple of ex-lovers who kept running into
each other.� 

&nbsp;

We naturally want what we
aren't supposed to have, whether the restrictions are self-imposed or forced
upon us by culture or law or our own pathetic weaknesses.� Sometimes this other person may not even know
you exist.� A woman who looked so good
would never come to you willingly.� Was
that fair?� A man had the right to resent
it.� Then came the feeling that things
were out of reach, no matter how badly you wanted them.� It created emptiness, then anger.� You still felt the desire to possess; to
somehow render the laws of our civilization inoperable in order to own the
object of your attention, even if for just a short while.� To me that was the difference between
flirtation and infatuation.� 

&nbsp;

While flirtation was a form
of recreation for me, infatuation was a force of nature.� I sometimes flirted; it was harmless.� It was.�
But infatuation was something else.�
If flirting was a tease......the first sip of an icy beer, champagne
bubbles tickling your nose, or the first caress of a cool breeze on a hot
summer day, infatuation was a different phenomenon, more profound,
irresistible, resembling in many ways a force of nature.....a hurricane, a
tornado, a wildfire.� An avalanche.� Something kinetic and dangerous.� Something wild and too big to hide from.� Something too big to trifle with.

&nbsp;

If I'd taken the time to
look around, I'd have realized that I was already engulfed from the moment I'd
laid eyes on Rasha.

&nbsp;

The impulse to act on this attraction
was natural, and when the object of this desire was an exceedingly beautiful
woman, not doing so caused a profound escalation of sexual tension in me.� While most men waited for the object of their
desire to give permission, I've found that achieving gratification with the
many woman I've known---without waiting for their approval---gave me the most
satisfaction.� �If it felt this
good,&quot; I told myself, &quot;how could it be wrong?�� And then I took what was
not given to me willingly.� Meeting a
woman who lived alone or spotting someone attractive in a parking lot, getting
her alone, then taking her.� It was
healthy when the feeling got too strong, or the timing was right, or when it
was someone especially beautiful.

&nbsp;

My choice of partners was
never truly random.� I understood that to
these women it may have seemed I suffered from distorted judgment and complete
loss of reason.� Perhaps.� All I knew was that I became so consumed with
desire for them that I would allow nothing to stand in the way of my possessing
them.� Dominating these unwilling
partners, forcing them to submit to my physical, sexual and emotional needs;
this was the process by which I liberated the sexual tension that existed
within me, and between us.� And even as
they were unwillingly forced down the path of satisfying my needs, there was
something that� none of them ever seem to
really understand---not until it was too late.�
For once I had forced total physical cooperation from them and achieved
a certain level satisfaction with their bodies, I no longer needed to be with
them.� From that point on, they belonged
to me---they were mine.� At that point,
even as I set them free, we both knew that they would never truly be free.� I would continue to dominate their lives,
living on in their thoughts and their dreams for a long time to come.

&nbsp;

Sex was the prism that
reflected the spectrum of our inner lives. When your life was chaos, carnal
pleasure could be pure escape, whether by simply releasing your stress by
orgasm in another's body or by putting on a costume and becoming someone else
for a while.� Role-playing was replete
with unconscious motivation; I became a Master as a result of a traumatizing
breakup.� But I later began routinely
breaking women because of....other things.�
The seemingly senseless things I'd suffered led me down the path towards
dominating women, whether I had their permission to do so or not.�� I thought, �If her body can�t be sacred to
me, it won�t be sacred to anybody.�� 

&nbsp;

I felt empowered by first
seducing women to submit, and then later by forcing them to do so.� But all the while I always remained
emotionally inaccessible.� My mantra was
�No woman will ever be allowed to reject me again.� Now I could really get back
at her/them, I thought, by ruining them or enslaving as many as I could, even
if only for a short while.� But while the
sex was always good and often great, it took me years and a specific woman to
suddenly realize that my life was a mess.�
Often
now, when I had Rasha down on her hands and knees in a totally open and
submissive position, I would suddenly find myself trying to rupture her colon,
doing my best to sexually destroy what she used to represent.� At times like this, only the look of absolute
horror and fear on her face mixed with agonized grimaces and shudders of pain
was enough to bring me out of my sexual rage.�
It was then that I realized that sex had become
a dysfunctional coping mechanism.� In
this, I wouldn�t be surprised if every master or dominatrix didn't feel
vulnerable without their whips and chains. 

&nbsp;

I am not a fool.� The women I have taken against their will
don't run to a type, other than always being attractive.� I had never before kept a woman long enough
to worry about seeing them as anything other than a vessel, a way to fulfill my
needs.� Their value never exceeded being
anything more than a means to an end.�
But Rasha somehow had gotten beyond the defenses I automatically raised
against the women I took.� She'd become a
individual instead of a faceless victim that went with a well-used body.� She herself had changed and in the process,
so had I.� The selfish, driven and
controlling woman/child around whose neck I had first fastened my collar was
gone.� In her place was a mature woman
that had now embraced with enthusiasm a set of basic needs that she had kept
hidden from herself for as long as she could remember.� 

&nbsp;

And as the man that had
opened her eyes and the Master that controlled her, I was the primary
recipient, the only recipient of her joy as she continually explored the
boundaries of previously forbidden pleasures in ways that were always new to
her.� This was a beautiful woman that
responded to my every need or desire unselfishly and enthusiastically.� I made her laugh with joy and I made her cry
with pain; nothing was too great for her to experience at this moment in her
life.� And she drank it all it in, all of
it, with great gusto and pleasure.� I had
opened a whole new world to her, and she grabbed for it with both hands, with
joy and exuberance.� And in the end, her
enthusiasm for the new life she found herself living because of me somehow
required me to re-evaluate mine too. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

It was late in the evening and he had pushed me up against the
wall so that I could not move away from him, even if I had wanted to.� Suddenly, a jolt of hot-blooded passion that
I had not felt for a man in years lit its way through me.� I knew it was out of character and wrong for
one like me, but I didn't WANT to be passive tonight.� Without thought, I acted as I would have
months ago with one of my students before I had been collared.� I jerked him forward into me, spinning us
until his back hit the wall where mine had been.� He had a look of total surprise on his
face.� The way he slammed into the chains
that bound my chest made my breasts feel as if they were being torn off at the
roots.� Breathing fast at the wonderful,
horribly stimulating sensations, I met his eyes with mine.� I felt my jaw tighten because I knew my eyes
were dilated with lust.� Would he accept
this or would he punish me.� I waited for
a minute and he just looked into my eyes.�
Okay, then.

&nbsp;

�Master, my skills as your slave,� I said, as I maneuvered my leg
between his and hooking my foot behind his, tugging until our hips touched,
�are phenomenal.� You know this.�� He smiled as he shook his head in amazement
at how his little slave was acting.�
Pulse hard and fast, I pushed him away and around again so I was between
him and the wall.� He let me do it, but
then he'd had enough.� Suddenly, he moved
so quickly, I sensed more than saw the motion.�
His hand abruptly moved, hitting my cheek with a light slap that was
almost mocking in its contemptuous ease.�


&nbsp;

Even as my face flushed from the
humiliating blow, I felt my groin tingle, bringing me alive with desire.� My pulse was fast and I felt wire-tight from
the need thrumming through me.� When I
had first met him, I hadn't been a woman that needed or wanted sex except on my
own terms.� I'd used it when necessary,
playing the boys at school for a sense of power or rarely allowing my husband
to satisfy himself.� It'd been a long
time since it had been satisfactory; even longer since I had initiated the
moves from any sense of need.� But I
recognized that he had changed me over the weeks and months.� Changed me from a woman isolated from her
body and emotions to a female that was totally in touch with her senses,
totally in touch with every inch of her skin.�
I willingly responded to his needs, and mine, anytime of the day or
night now, multiple times.

&nbsp;

He'd molded me into a savagely
passionate woman.� That he had done it
only to satisfy his needs didn't matter.�
It was who I was now, and a guilty part of me gloried in the abandonment
that I allowed myself, even as I had denied myself everywhere else before I had
been claimed.� I had survived by creating
the lie that the sex was meaningless.�
But he'd claimed me, sensitized my entire body and then kept me isolated
so that only he could make it resonate to passion with just his lightest touch or
the smell of his body.� 

&nbsp;

He was in total control,
commanding obedience and having the right to do what he wanted with his
property. To the few that were aware of our reality, I knew that it conjured up
images of a woman having no choice, no veto power, and no way out.� But that was not true.� For those like me who found they desired real
control and no safety net, it was satisfyingly absolute.� Everything he did exerted some kind of
control; the breast piercings, the brand, the beatings and spankings.� For some slaves and owners, branding was an
intense desire, indicating total commitment and psychologically stamping the
slave as property; ensuring the slave truly felt owned and wanted.� For those with a low pain tolerance or just
wanting to pretend, a mark could be applied with an ink marker or cheat
'brands' could be applied with tattoos.�
But I surprised myself, for I found in the end that something like
temporary ink would not have been what I wanted---it would not have been as
satisfyingly final.

&nbsp;

Undrugged, I then rode the wooden horse for perhaps the twentieth
time, my ankles crossed and my straining thighs crushing the piece of flat wood
locked between them.� I was covered with
rivers of sweat and my aroused nipples stood out from my breasts like giant
light switches.� My hands were braced on
the wood in front of me and I was rocking back and forth, pinching my clit with
one move of my hips and my labia with another; my head was thrown back, my eyes
were closed and I was screaming.� I was
giving voice to my defiance of the vanilla world that had never understood me
and at the same time, I howled my pleasure at the achingly intense and
exquisitely wonderful pain that I discovered each time I did this.� I rocked like this for his pleasure.....and
mine, but then he'd watched long enough.�
Grabbing me by my hair, Master dragged me off the horse and threw me to
the floor.� He slid between my aching
thighs and filled me like never before.�
He was huge.� And even though I
hurt there, it felt wondrous.

&nbsp;

Sometimes when he rode me really hard like that, I became free of
everything; the White Room, my body, even time.�
That was the slut's high, I knew, and even though it felt like freedom,
it really was the melding with, the clicking-in with and then totally satisfying
his needs and desires that did it.� When
he slid that magical, fiery python-sized rocket between my legs, it felt like
it belonged there, and always had, and always would.� As if it were some hyper-evolved alien tail
I'd somehow extruded; as though over patient centuries, I'd grown a sweet and
intricate piece of flesh and bone that was only there to give me pleasure.� I was entirely part of him then, a wild-ass
little dot of energy and matter impaled on the end of his rock-hard cock, and I
made a thousand choices to please him more, jumping from instant to instant;
how he moved his hips and how to respond, how his belly felt sweat-slick on
mine as he pumped me, how I grabbed his ass and dragged him ever deeper inside
me, never wanting it to stop, how I bit his neck and shoulder and the way he
responded in shock.� And how at the end,
as he came inside me before falling, relaxing like grace itself, exhausted.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

He helped me begin to understand myself better than my shrink ever
had.� Because of my looks, I had become
sexualized earlier than a lot of other girls my age.� By the time I was fifteen, I found that I
liked sex but only on MY terms.� It seemed like a Catch 22: if you repressed your sexuality, you
became neurotic, but if you expressed your drives and irrational behaviors
through sex, you�re still neurotic, but now just in bed.� Men said that I was a rush in bed because
they assumed I'd do anything.� But I'd
found that a person others considered neurotic may be thought a great lover,
they won't consider them the ideal long-term partner.� 

&nbsp;

That truth alone screwed my head over because I thought that while
every male I'd ever met wanted to fuck me, nobody wanted to love me.� So I just continued to do what I did best
because I obviously was not worthy enough to be in a relationship.� I continued acting out, eventually
embarrassing my family with escapades that often became famous in our little
town.� But no matter what I did, no
matter how much I acted like a slut, either because of luck or because of my
parent�s intervention, I was protected from most of the consequences of these
deeds.� Not all of them, but certainly
more than I deserved.� Soon, I came to
take this apparent invulnerability as my due.�
When I later became a teacher, I continued my not so subtle war with
society's values. �After a couple of
years, I had reached the point where even though I felt isolated from everyone,
I connected with half the population through my looks and was hated by the
other half for them.� I was jaded and
arrogant, expecting every male to bow at my feet.

&nbsp;

Now I know that I needed a man as a guide during those times.� A man to whom I could have give my freedom
and who in return would have guided and directed my life for me.� But I had my Master now.� I wouldn't give up my freedom lightly and not
to just any man who would claim to be my master.� But when the right one came along, we both
recognized the need we filled in each other.�
I made him take me by force, unconsciously ensuring that he had the
strength I craved, but I willingly belonged to this man now.

&nbsp;

We had our problems in the beginning, most of them due to my
arrogance and inability to recognize him as my rightful Master or to understand
what he offered.� But once he had beaten
down my defenses and allowed me to feel his strength, I found that I eventually
desired subjugation just for the serenity it brought.� And at the end when he had won and I had
lost, he forced me to my knees to take my first sip of the tranquility that he
offered.� The hot-blooded highs and
blood-thick lows that I experienced everyday in his service---none of it
mattered in the end. On my knees with head bowed in front of this man, he
offered me the peace of �complete emptiness�; it was the complete absence of
personal responsibility and the presence of total freedom to act as I desired,
the total comprehension of my true nature as well as his, and an absolute trust
in that character.� And it was what my
soul craved.

&nbsp;

And so, here I am.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Chapter 35: The worst thing about slavery is that the slaves eventually get to
like it; Aristotle.

&nbsp;

We were
going out tonight.� As I prepared myself,
he came in and watched me dress.� He
walked up next to me and I could feel him standing behind me.� I sat on the edge of my bed and put on my
left stocking, then the right.� After I
had fastened the last garter,I could feel the slick softness on my fingertips
long after I had released it.� When I had
on only my navy garter belt and stockings, he suddenly said �Tiptoes.� As I had
been taught, I immediately stopped whatever I was doing, stood and looked at
him over my shoulder with a smile on my face as I went onto the tips of my
toes.� 

&nbsp;

He looked at
me for a minute, ran his eyes over my body, then shook his head and said,
�Down.�� I continued with what I had been
doing.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

Rasha was absolutely beautiful as she stood on her toes wearing
only stockings.� Her legs were straight
and shapely as her muscles tensed and strained, allowing her to hold the pose I
found so provocative.� Her slender ankles
acted as counterpoint to long vertical lines of muscle in her strong yet
attractive calves; all of which led a man's eyes up to her firm thighs and the
tight way that the tops of her stockings embraced her firm flesh.� Her clenched buttocks were cellulite-free,
sticking out with a firmness that a man had to touch to appreciate.� She had small shapely feet and when she was
on her toes, encased as they were in navy blue nylon, they splayed out with a
sort of Barbie doll look that was lovely to see if you were a leg and foot man
like I was.� 

&nbsp;

I loved the look this pose gave the heels of her feet as she went
up on her toes; the lighter areas in back where the tight nylon stressed the
skin on the back of her heel more than for other areas.� Her legs absolutely glowed.� She'd done a good job of keeping her legs
shapely and the skin soft; it showed now.�
I wanted to immediately jump her, but knew that I didn't have time.� Oh well, there was always tonight.� And she would always be available.� 

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

He gave me
the order that permitted me down, then watched in the mirror as I quickly
resumed my tasks; I powdered my face and dabbed on rouge.� And when I was done with this, I put on my
dress,.� It was an intimate rite, I
realized, and his presence made me somehow a little uncomfortable.� After I had put on lipstick, he walked over
to the mirror and stood behind me, �You see, there�s nothing wrong with being
female.�

&nbsp;

I stared at
my reflection.� I said, �I don�t know if
I can do this, Sir.� At one time in my
life, maybe.� But it�s been so long.�

&nbsp;

�I think
it�s time we enjoyed ourselves.� Now put
on some heels.�� He just looked at me
when I was ready.� He said, �You�re going
to be eaten alive tonight.�

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

There existed just north of the central part of town, a place of
specialty shops, taverns and restaurants, all suffused with a flavor that I
thought of as �Bohemian.�� It was a flavor that stood in appealing
contrast to the overpowering fast food chains I normally used.� 

&nbsp;

I had already talked with Rasha about her public behavior.� I'd given her permission to cuddle in the
car; we sat like lovers as I drove.� Me
with my arm around her, Rasha with her face pressed against the side of my
neck.� She crossed, then re-crossed her
legs in the car, showing smooth, silky-looking skin all the way up to where it
ended.� 

&nbsp;

As we walked in from where we'd parked, Rasha turned briefly and
flashed me a soft smile over her shoulder.�
Despite her obvious happiness, I felt a twinge of annoyance; she had
already forgotten to let me precede her.�
I grabbed her arm and moved quickly to the lead.

&nbsp;

It was clear that we were a mismatched pair, figures from
different paintings from different times.�
I was twenty years older, wore jeans and a jacket, and cross-trainers
that didn�t make a sound as I walked.�
She wore a short, expensive-looking navy dress with a deep daring front,
sheer heeled 10 denier navy stockings and navy pumps with four-inch stiletto
heels.� Dangling earrings and a one inch
wide dark blue velvet choker that acted as a formal collar finished her outfit.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

My Master lengthened his stride; I was forced to run sporadically
to keep up with him.� He stayed slightly
ahead of me.� I followed like a stray
dog, like a Muslim woman.� Soon I was
disoriented and I wondered if he was deliberately confusing me.� 

&nbsp;

As we walked to the restaurant, I raised my eyes to the women I
passed, the girls who met my eyes boldly and the plainly dressed southern women
who after a moment of scrutiny, cast theirs away.� In what, I wondered?� Disgust?�
Shame?� Boredom?� What had happened to these women in their
journey to adulthood?� I know when I'd
received my training in plain dress by my mother.� When were they instructed to hide
themselves?� 

&nbsp;

I became conscious of my own body as we walked and how, unlike
these women, my clothes now contoured my shape; they were bright and colored
and completely without mystery.� I was
conscious of the length of sheer leg I showed. As I walked I enjoyed the feel
of open air on much of my skin beneath my dress.� It was a strange context in which to be
reminded of my essential femaleness, but I realized that I was grateful.� 

&nbsp;

It was my first time out like this for awhile and I was
tremblingly eager.� We were at the
restaurant now.� I smoothed my short
dress over my hips one more time, straightened my shoulders, let my arms drop
loosely at my sides and began to walk.� I
willed myself to go slowly, in a fake sexy way that made my face burn and my
legs feel weak.� Even above the
background music and conversation I could hear the shoosh-shoosh of nylon as my
thighs brushed against each other.� Would
anyone see the garters under my dress that held up my stockings?� Would anyone know I wasn�t wearing panties?

&nbsp;

At the same time, I also had the feeling that we were being
watched, that eyes were following me, evaluating me.� It was an eerie feeling, like there were eyes
floating along after me as I walked through the dinner crowd towards our
table.� 

&nbsp;

Snaking past the tables, we passed other diners sitting at the
small tables.� One stood out because of
his long dark hair, worn in a fairly elaborate style with braids hanging down
in front of the ears and one thick ponytail in back.� He had a full beard, which was likewise
gathered into a braid.� On anybody else,
his schoolboy smile might look pleasant, but on him it seemed threatening.�� Although appearing portly, he stood up
quickly and stepped forward, pulling Master aside in a familiar way and
speaking in unfamiliar accent.� Both of
them stared at me as the strange man spoke, giving me an odd feeling.� 

&nbsp;

After a minute, Master removed the man�s hand from his shoulder
and we continued on.� He stopped at one
more table, this time that of a woman.�
The woman scared me.� She spoke
with a directness and a candor that was almost intimacy�.� Her eyes moved as I watched, scanning the
room full of men.� She was an observer of
men, and of the brutal poignancy that was new in my life.� She was a woman that was fearless and
shameless and unapologetic about following the clear call of her spirit.� If things had happened differently, I
thought, I could have been like her.�
Looking at the poor slaves that wore collars, instead of being one
myself.� 

&nbsp;

In the final analysis, I knew that deep inside I was made of the
same material which this�.mistress�.seemed to personify.� But while I had limped from one crisis to
another in my life, men and women like her had the ability to bring life and
direction.� I belonged to Master and knew
I would never try to run away again.�
Aside from the discomfort and uncertainty, something important was
happening to me here under his careful guidance, something for which I think I
had waited for a long time.� Something I
had not yet named.� Nor yet fully
earned.� And I never would have predicted
it would come to me this way.

&nbsp;

Going out at night.� It was
a world I thought I had lost because of my changed status in life.� As we entered the dining room, I kept my eyes
lowered but smiled involuntarily.� I
followed him as we went to our table and knew that this was an
impossibility.� This was no longer my
realm, but an afterworld for survivors, a sanctuary for those untouched by the
collar I wore.� I felt fraudulent and
torn; I wanted to be five years younger; everyone here had to know my status
and I just wanted to disappear.

&nbsp;

I forgot my position and made another mistake, allowing the waiter
to seat me first.� I looked at Master
Christian with fearful eyes---I think I embarrassed him in front of
others.� His face grew very still and he
refused to answer my implied questions.�
Realizing what I had done, I fumbled with my napkin in confusion and
looked down at my plate.� I would never
do that again to him, and I hoped he would know this and not punish me too
severely.� 

&nbsp;

We ate at a private table on a southward-facing balcony which
overlooked the narrow crooked streets and colorful plaza of the renovated
town.� Our waitress had enormous jutting
hips, as though the body of a much slimmer woman had been grafted onto the
waist of a Bradley tank, all camouflaged in an unflattering black skirt.� 

&nbsp;

I smiled demurely.� My eyes
were lowered, but I was sitting as straight as I possibly could next to my
Master.� In the clothes I wore, I felt
almost naked.� I found myself tapping my
high heel to the background music.� He
finally looked at me and said with a smile, �Look at you.� You can�t keep still.�� We both laughed at this; he in a good mood
again, me in relief.

&nbsp;

The cuisine combined ingredients familiar to us both, but was
prepared in unfamiliar ways, and was wholly exotic.� I deferred to him in all things and as we
ate, the city lights began to twinkle to life with the onset of twilight.� Master was in an expansive mood now and
ordered brandy for us both.� By the time
after-dinner drinks had arrived, the few remaining clouds had lost the pinkness
of sunset and stars were beginning to appear, along with a sickle of the
moon.� He allowed me to linger over the
brandy as the cityscape became a blaze of light that couldn�t banish the stars
above.� 

&nbsp;

I drained my snifter---oddly but pleasingly shaped to my
eyes---and leaned back with a sigh.�
�Master.� It seems so
peaceful.� Perfect, even.� Hard to believe that�.that�.things are like
they are.�� I couldn�t help but frown.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

There was something that I wanted to ask
him, something that I'd been thinking about on various levels for a long
time.� But the time had never been
right.� It wasn't something that I'd said
out loud, and I found myself reluctant to bring it up.�� Partly because doing so would make it more
real, and partly because it would probably seem so silly to the man who now
controlled my life.

&nbsp;

�Master,� I said looking at him, �may I
ask you a question?�

&nbsp;

He pushed his chair away from the table,
leaned back, and laced his fingers over his belly, �Sure.�

&nbsp;

�Have you, Master, have you ever been
bothered by what you do?�

&nbsp;

He looked at me intently for a moment,
then began to smile.

&nbsp;

�Please, Master.� I'm serious.�

&nbsp;

He shrugged as he looked at me.� �Not usually, no.�

&nbsp;

�You don't ever feel like.....� I smiled
tentatively.� �You know, like God is
watching?�

&nbsp;

�Oh, sure he's watching.� He just doesn't care.�

&nbsp;

�You really think so?�

&nbsp;

He shrugged again.� �I figure he's the one that made the
rules.� I'm just playing by them.� If he doesn't like the way things have turned
out down here on Planet Earth, he should speak his mind.� I would if I were him.�

&nbsp;

�Maybe, Master.....maybe he is speaking
his mind and no one's listening.�

&nbsp;

�He ought to speak a little more
clearly, then.�� He looked up and
nodded.� I knew that our moment of
intimacy was gone.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

After dinner, we went back to the car and then began the drive back to
his home.� This time I sat apart from
him.� For some reason, he pulled in to
the parking lot of a golf course that had lights on and people still playing
rounds of night golf.� 

&nbsp;

�Come on, Little Slave,� he said grabbing my wrist and dragging me past
the golf shop and along a dark path that ran beside it.� �Slave---Rasha�, he whispered, coming up from
behind me.� He chuckled and buried his
mouth into the base of my neck, making sounds of satisfaction.� I have to admit that it was not an unpleasant
sensation.� 

&nbsp;

He brought his head up, breathing through his nose.� I could smell it too.� �It�s the lilacs, Sir,� I said.

&nbsp;

He was kissing my neck again and his hands came up around my
breasts.� �You are the sexiest woman
alive.� I don�t want any other women
tonight.� I just want you tonight,� he
murmured, keeping his left hand on my breast and dropping his right around my
waist to pull me tight against him.� I
felt his erection against me.

&nbsp;

It felt so strange, to be out free tonight, yet knowing at the same time
that I was still his.� He was crushing my
buttocks against him, grinding into me now and his left hand had slid easily
under my dress and over my breast.� He
pinched me hard and suddenly, without wanting to be, I was aroused, hot and wet
between my legs.� I was amazed,
incredulous, thinking that this could not be me; this was not a me that I
recognized.

&nbsp;

Suddenly he sucked a breath in through his teeth and roughly turned me
around, holding me around the waist, looking at me, pressing himself against
me.� He took my hand and brought it down,
pressing it against the swelling in his pants.

&nbsp;

I have touched this man many times before, and it was always on his
terms.� But now, Master kept his hand
over mine, guiding me to press down on him, rubbing, rubbing, and he moaned
suddenly, hoarse, letting his head loll back.

&nbsp;

Did he want to climax?� Like
this?� I didn�t know.� I didn�t know what was going on, this was so
strange��.so wonderful.� Master brought
his head down, and then suddenly he carried me like a line-backer through the
bushes, which scratched us both, and then we ran into something, a golf
cart.� He fumbled a moment, pushed me
past it, and then we both stumbled and fall to the ground.� Gravel was scraping my back.� He had not allowed me underwear tonight and
all he had to do was push my dress up around my waist; he did this in frantic
haste.� He looked down at me, his eyes
glittering as they caught light from the parking lot.� He undid his belt and let it flap open.� He unhooked his pants and jerked his zipper,
fighting with it, and then yanked his shorts down.� He was lording over me on his knees, holding
his huge gleaming self in his hand.� He
reached for my hand and brought it to him, guiding me to gently stroke it.� 

&nbsp;

�All I want is you, Little Slave,� he whispered and he eased himself down
as I angled myself up, knees wide and I guided him toward me.� He paused, looked at me, said, �I only want
you� and pushed himself in, divinely pushing his way in up to the hilt, pushing
until I could feel his balls slapping me between my legs.� �You�re mine, you�re mine, you belong only to
me,� he said, closing his eyes and staying up on the palm of his hands as he
began to thrust, twisting, jamming, going after me.� He had me gasping, crying, and finally,
convulsing around him, whimpering, shaking with each spasm.� He froze, cumming---injecting me deeply with
his love---then collapsed on me.� The
gravel dug into my spine now and I winced, but I didn�t dare move.

&nbsp;

Not now, not now.� My hands fell to
his back; it was slick.� We were both
wet, soaking.� His face was in my neck,
his hair tasted of salt.� He said
something that I couldn�t make out and then rolled over, pulling me on
top.� His hands detected the gravel
embedded in my flesh and he laughed, pulling my hips tighter against him.� We lay there for several more minutes until
we heard laughter in the parking lot.�
Hastily, we both popped upright and tried to dress, but he fell over and
scraped his knee.� �Shit,� he
yelled.� The security guard was coming
this way now, his flashlight swinging.� I
dove through the bushes and Master staggered after me.� We burst out laughing then, as we hurried
down the path to a place where we could pull ourselves together.

&nbsp;

In comparison to all of the other men that have been in my life, he
seemed tonight like an uncomplicated gift from the heavens.� Straight forward lust, no guessing; whatever
he wanted, he just told me and I did it.��
It was a wonderful night.

&nbsp;

Chapter 36: What is sexual is what gives a man an erection... If there is no
inequality, no violation, no dominance, no force, there is no sexual arousal; Catherine MacKinnon.

&nbsp;

Self-bondage.� The concept held a certain perverse
fascination for me.� This was something
I'd been thinking about for awhile.� He'd
kept me for months and I knew that he had strong feelings for me.� And God help me, I cared for him, far more
than I wanted to.� I knew better than
anyone how much I'd acted like a spoiled child before he�d come into my
life.� But now it was different; he took
care of me and treated me as an adult under his protection, no better and no
worse than I deserved.� In my head I
refused to consider myself as his slave, but rather something more.� I now found that I accepted my subservience
with far too much ease.� Annoyingly, I
discovered that anything he wanted, it seemed automatically I desired that
too.� My husband had not aroused anything
like these feelings in me; in fact, I had never before found a man whom I
wanted more to please in every way.� This
wasn't like me, but I couldn�t seem to help myself.

&nbsp;

His birthday
was coming soon and I had nothing to give him; I had little to give except
myself.� But in this, we had already
experimented far beyond anything I could have ever previously imagined.� What could I give him that he had not already
taken?� I shivered in anticipation and a
touch of fear at my next thought; he'd made it clear from the beginning how
much he enjoyed taking me from the rear.�
Getting a big, hard cock rammed up my ass---this was something that I had
never before wished to experience from any man but Master Christian.� But always before, he had been the one to
initiate it.� I knew that it was pathetic
even as I thought to myself, this could be my gift to him.� He knew how strongly I had abhorred anal love
before him---if I requested it from him for the first time, I just knew that he
would have to appreciate what I had sacrificed for him and what I offered.

&nbsp;

Self-bondage.� I'd thought about this for some time and
wasn�t sure if I was up to it.� I was
sure that if I was to follow through on this�and I wasn�t yet sure that I
would�.I knew I needed to put myself in a position in which once I had started,
I couldn�t back out---no pun intended.�
There are an infinite number of ways of restraining someone and an equal
number of reasons why people might need or want to be restrained.�� But I had never much thought about this
before and wasn�t sure that my motives were appropriate, let alone my skills.� 

&nbsp;

I wasn�t
sure that I would have the self-control to keep myself still for him in the
beginning without bondage, let alone continue with the act itself.� But I also knew that pretending to immobilize
myself for him over a short period of time wouldn�t satisfy my Master or me
either.� It needed to be more elaborate;
something that he would appreciate aesthetically as well as physically.� And as his bottom�I blushed as I realized
that I was even using his terminology now�..as his bottom, I hoped that if I
did this for him, he would understand how much more than just my body I was
offering him.� 

&nbsp;

Self-bondage.� I knew that I needed more than emblematic
bondage.� For both of us, should I take
this step, the bonds must be actually physically inescapable: I needed to
genuinely know that I could not avoid whatever he wished to do to me.� I had to trust in his good nature---and his
self-control.� I think I knew from the
beginning that I had always wanted this to work; but even as I felt a kind of
dread just thinking about the act, there was no doubt that he would enjoy the
physical side, as he always did.� But
much more important to me was that for the first time, I was voluntarily giving
him true control over myself.� This was a
hugely symbolic act�.putting myself in a position in which I offered him that
which only he would have the key to set free.

&nbsp;

He was still
at work, but I expected him within half an hour.� I was already feeling a little horny and
rapidly growing in arousal---I knew in my mind I had already decided to go
ahead with this---and I also knew that I had to lock myself into the straps
before I chickened out.� And so I began
my preparations.� At the head of the bed,
I laid a tube of lubricant, a medium-sized dildo and a small butt plug.� 

&nbsp;

I stripped
naked and put on a pair of strappy white high heeled sandals---I knew that he
liked what they did to my legs.� I hooked
short bungee cords to both corners at the foot of my bed and laid them out
pointing towards the head of the bed.� Next,
I hooked a third short bungee cord from the center of the bed frame at the top
and laid it out on the mattress.� I also
put my blindfold next to this last cord.�


&nbsp;

Standing by
my bed, I strapped on leather wrist and ankle restraining bracelets.� Each ankle bracelet had four small steel
rings sewn around it, and on both ankles I snapped a small caribiner that had a
gate that opened and closed.� All
bracelets now comfortably tight, I adjusted my one-inch thick leather slave
collar, after which I put a penis gag in mouth and strapped it around the back
of my head.� I couldn't make a sound.

&nbsp;

I climbed on
the bed onto my knees and after I had turned the caribiners on my ankles so
that they were facing each other, I attached the bungee cords from the foot of
the bed to the outside ring of each ankle restraint.� This forced my feet and knees quite far
apart.� I walked on my knees up the bed
to the point that the cords were stretched taut and I could move my ankles no
further.� I carefully laid out the butt
plug and lubricating gel next to my right knee�it was for him to use at first
to get me ready.� I hoped that with this
he wouldn�t hurt me as much when he finally took me there.� Next to it I laid the dildo�I knew that he
would explore my vagina too.

&nbsp;

Breathing a
little heavily now due to the gag, I took the bungee cord from the head of the
bed and hooked it to my collar.� The
cords pulling on my ankles from the foot of the bed and the one on my collar
pulling from the head of my bed almost flattened me out on the mattress.� Fighting the pull of the elastic, I grabbed
the blindfold and put it on.� I paused;
this had reached the point of no return.�
I made sure that I could still breathe with the pull on my collar; no
problem.� 

&nbsp;

Self-bondage.� Now for the last and most important part; I
drew my knees up towards my chest as far as I could and hunched over, then I
reached blindly between my knees with both hands.� Using my right hand I locked my left wrist to
the inside of my left ankle with the caribiner.�
Finally, I fumbled with my right hand for what seemed hours before I was
able to push the ring on my right wrist restraint into the caribiner attached
to my right ankle.� 

&nbsp;

I had
succeeded, I think.� It was
uncomfortable, but I knew that I was locked into a position from which I could
never free myself.� I was hunched over,
my face was driven sideways into the mattress, my knees were spread wide apart,
my wrists were strapped between my knees to my ankles and my naked buttocks
were pointing straight into the air.� I
grabbed a high heel in each hand and then wiggled my hips experimentally. �I knew that this would drive him wild with
lust.� God, I just hoped I knew what I
was doing.� 

&nbsp;

It seemed
like an eternity later, yet soon, far too soon, I heard him enter the
house.� I heard him call out, but I
waited for him in silence.� Within a
minute, I could sense him standing by the bed.�
His breathing grew louder and quicker in my ears; I could tell from the
sound alone how aroused he had become.� I
waggled my butt for half a minute, then spread my knees a couple of inches even
further apart.� I was as spread for my
Master as I could make myself.� 

&nbsp;

I felt his
hands touch me lightly between the legs and then roam over my buttocks and
back.� Then I heard his footsteps as he
departed---this was not in my plans.�
Soon, I heard him coming back; he ran his hand slowly between my thighs
and I felt him stroke my abdomen.� Then
he slowly pulled his hand back from between my legs until he cupped my vagina,
giving it a couple of quick shakes before his hand was gone.� He said, �You are so beautiful, so truly beautiful.�� I almost felt like wiggling like a puppy, I
was so happy that I had pleased him.�
After a second of silence, I felt him reaching around my back to grab my
left breast.� 

&nbsp;

It was then
that he put what must have been a wooden clothespin on my left nipple.� I gave a grunt of surprise and pain at the
same time that I jumped and arched my back in total disbelief.� I had long become used to my Master�s
fascination with the sensitivity of my nipples, but always before there had
been a slow buildup, a set of visual cues that preceded the actual act he
wished to perform, all of which aroused rather than repelled me.� But here the pain was so immediate and
intense and unexpected, so out of the context from the scenario that I
anticipated in my mind, that instantly my thoughts were taken away from the
awkward position in which I had put myself.�
I bucked a couple of more times, but it was no use.� The clothespin had cruelly captured my nipple
until he chose to take it off.� Suddenly,
I felt his hand sliding over my ribs on my right side.� His hand cupped my right breast and pulled it
out so that he could get at that nipple next.�
I tried to pull away, but not in time---my Master had pinned my other
nipple too.� 

&nbsp;

I heard him
undressing.� This was not going according
to plan and much of my initial desire was gone.�
I was more concerned with getting the pins off of me now.� I pushed my chest desperately against the
mattress and tried to rub them off, but they were turned in a way that defeated
my every effort.� My hands no longer
grabbed the heels of my shoes, instead writhing and struggling against what
kept them from freedom.� I pulled and
struggled against the bonds that held me, but it was no use; I would not be
seeing freedom---of any type---without his help.� Freedom---this was a word that had no real
meaning for me anymore.� I cared for this
man and had begun to want him more and more.�
I was all too well aware that he was a man who knew what he wanted and
how to keep it---and now it was me he wanted in a new way and I had served
myself up on a golden platter.� 

&nbsp;

I felt the
drizzle of cold lubricant down the crease between my cheeks.� God no, I just wanted this to end now.� As much as I had reached the point where I
wanted to please this man in every way, I also felt like nothing I did could
ever go right between us.� We would
always misunderstand each other---and this time it was entirely my fault.� Suddenly, I felt him open my vagina with his
hand.� There was the drizzle of still
more lubricant and then, with a grunt, he began to strongly drive what must
have been the fingers of his left hand inside me.� I was filled with horrified understanding; he
had mentioned a couple of times that he had always wanted to �fist� a woman.� 

&nbsp;

Immediately,
I was flooded with images and feelings from the Black One as he fisted me in my
mind all over again.� I shook my head,
no, No, NO!!!� NOT AGAIN!!! and screamed
into my gag, but nothing stopped him.�
Sensations from my previous fisting came back and from the beginning, it
felt like Master was trying to push a fire hydrant inside me, but it just kept
getting bigger and driving deeper.� My
head automatically came up off the mattress as far as I could raise it.� I heard myself squeal and try to tell him no,
but even to my ears all that came out was, �Uuuhhhmmmm-nah-ah.�� One hand was on my hips steadying me, while
his other, four fingers straightened and kept closely together, twisted like a
corkscrew and drove ever deeper.�
�Uuuhhhmmmm-Nah-Ah.�
NAHHH-AH!�� 

&nbsp;

Soon he
pulled his fingers out slightly and I knew a little relief.� But there was the drizzle of more lubricant
and then his fingers were back, worse than ever; it was four fingers AND his
thumb now.� His hand was inside me and I
knew I couldn�t take much more of this.�
I was sobbing at this point, both from the pain and awful, frustrating
certainty that he had totally misread what I offered him.� I kept on trying to pull my ankles a little
closer together so that I could close my knees more, but nothing worked---my
first attempt at self-bondage had been horribly successful.� 

&nbsp;

His hand
kept driving and corkscrewing into me and suddenly, with a grunt, he had
succeeded in defeating my vaginal muscles.�
A flash of burning pain accompanied by an involuntary shudder ran
through me and I knew without a doubt that his hand was buried inside me up to
his wrist.�
�Nnnaaahhh-Aaaahhh-AAAAAAHHHHHH,� I screamed into my gag.� There was the pain of my flesh being horribly
stretched, but worse was the terrible feeling of fullness, of a probing
wrongness that so deeply filled me.� I
couldn't breathe, his hand must have been pressing against my diaphragm; he was
so deep inside me now that his fingertips would puncture it.� I felt like I would never be able to close my
legs again.� The muscles on the insides
of my thighs quivered out of control, but the most awful part was that he kept
on pushing, even after I felt that he had succeeded beyond even his wildest
expectations.� He pushed and he explored
and at the end as he slowly clenched his hand into a fist, he filled everything
that I was and that I'd ever had and that I would ever be�.he spared me
nothing.

&nbsp;

I was like a
ventriloquist�s dummy made of flesh and blood; his hand was driven so deeply
inside me that every move of his wrist or forearm shifted my hips to perfectly
conform with his desires.� I moved my
body up or down, left or right, however, wherever he silently commanded
me.� We communicated in a supremely intimate,
yet wordless dance as he first forced me to hunker down a little more for him,
then I would feel the overwhelming need to arch my back and go up as high on my
knees as I could; whatever his hand and wrist commanded, I obeyed.� We were totally synchronized at this point,
so much more than merely wedded; his hand deep inside my pelvis, relaying in
the most intimate way his every desire for my body to perform.� 

&nbsp;

It seemed to
go on this way forever, but suddenly I heard him softly say, �Shit.�� I think he had cum on himself.� I knew that it was over as he slowly
unclenched his fist and began to withdraw his hand from inside my body.� When he kissed my back and thanked me, I
started crying uncontrollably. 

&nbsp;

Self-bondage.� When the clothespins had first gone on, it
was clear that he had missed what I thought were obvious prompts and cues; I
had struggled as best as I could, but I had lost.� History is in the business of repeating
itself; I had next fought against his hand---and lost once more, but that was
gone now.� But here I still remained, the
victim of my own actions, completely unable to move or free myself.� 

&nbsp;

What I had
learned was that night was that in a perfect world, while the Top should be the
one that controlled everything that might take place, if at all possible he
should not actually rule the bottom.� It
was only the scene, and not the bottom, that should be controlled by the
Top.� It is the setting that gave the
bottom her thrills and fulfilled her needs.�
But this time, in this particular scene and my imperfect world, I could
blame no one else but myself for this disaster.�
I thought of what was yet to be with this man, what might be between us,
and of what slavery really meant for me.�
Was this truly what I deserved?� I
could only remain here on my knees with my face pushed into the mattress,
sobbing softly now and waiting for him---and what was to be.

&nbsp;

I think that
he was confused now; I knew that my feelings were jumbled into a pile of
emotional debris.� He took the
clothespins off first and then freed my wrists from my ankles.� He continued on to free my ankles from the
bondage I had so willing assumed, as I ripped the blindfold off and then
unhooked my collar from the bungee cord.�
By now he had begun unstrapping the gag, so I held still until he had
finished.� When the gag was finally out,
he knew that I had been crying for real.�
I didn�t trust myself to speak.

&nbsp;

He thanked me for my gift, saying that he had always wanted to do
that to me, but knew that I hadn't wanted to accept it until now.� I lay afterwards in his arms, crying
softly.� This had been almost as bad as
when he gave me to the Black One that night in the store.� I still had nightmares about that night and
what that young boy had done to me as I lay stretched out over that desk.� But I had done my best to move on with my
life as my Master's slave and his conscience.�


&nbsp;

Again, just like that terrible night, I hurt between my legs, my
flesh throbbing with each beat of my heart.�
But with each pulse of pain, somehow I felt better too.� It had all been a horrible
misunderstanding.� It had been a mistake,
and he hadn't known what I offered.� It
had been my fault for not being more clear.�


&nbsp;

I ached and
throbbed between my legs, but his hands gently pushed me down on the bed and he
began to lie down next to me even as his hands stroked me.� I could smell my sex on his hand as he
touched me and I pushed him away, but he laid down anyway and cradled me in his
arms.� I buried my tear-streaked face in
the chest of my Master, the man who had just fisted me, and he held me tight.� Finally, he thanked me one more time, saying
how he hoped it hadn�t hurt too much, but telling me again how much he had
enjoyed it.� I pushed away from his chest
so that I could look him in the face.� I
think that he was surprised when I began sobbing into his chest again.� I will never again voluntarily give him total
control over a scene between us like this again.� 

&nbsp;

My Master wasn�t an idiot.�
In the end, he knew what had gone wrong, but more, he knew something had
changed in us both.� Somehow, because of
the lost translation between what I offered and what he took, it forced us to
look again at the deepest assumptions we held about the other.� I felt we became even closer after this; I
knew we began an intimate journey that night which took him beyond physical
desire and me beyond the need for care and protection.� I knew beyond doubt that we began to care
about each other beyond what either had ever expected, and certainly more than
either of us deserved.� But there were
still great hurdles ahead.

&nbsp;

In some perverse way, being a misunderstanding also made it more
bearable.� For the anticipation that he
wouldn't always WANT to hurt me that badly gave me hope.� Later that night, he took me again.� And even though my pussy still ached and
throbbed from its earlier violation, this was okay for I had finally realized
that even when I was in pain, it gave me pleasure to give him pleasure.� I finally understood in my heart that my role
was to give and his to take.� And I realized
that my time of training in this must be over, because this style of life was
as it should be, at least for the likes of me.�
And even later, he took me one last time anally, before we both fell
asleep.� And with this too, I knew that
my training in his hands was complete, because I had finally come to enjoy this
almost as much as I liked being fucked in my pussy.� 

&nbsp;

The feeling of fullness and forced extension and the unusual way
that it put pressure on my pussy; the total lack of control on my part; the
idea of his total dominance as he probed and searched a place in my body never
meant to be explored like that.� The
pushing inside and his driving me ahead of him, his hands cupping my breasts
and using them or my hair as reins, often forcing me from my hands and knees
onto my belly.� Everything about it
turned me on so much now.� I found I
liked rough sex now, I liked it much rougher than I could ever have imagined I
would before I'd accepted his collar.�
I'd come to anticipate being pushed by him to the edge of the
abyss.� And afterwards, I found I liked
the ache of a body pushed almost too far.�
And giving up all control over any choices in the matter just made the
experience that much sweeter when he made every decision for me.

&nbsp;

I was
looking out the window.� It was April and
I knew that I had finally begun to earn Master's trust.� I had the freedom of the house when he was
there, and I appreciated it so much more than I had ever before.� Shards of pure color, formed by the lake's
reflection through the window glass danced over my face as though small flares
burned beneath my skin.� The lake itself,
I saw, had calmed from the storm last night.�
A pleasing picture, a well-ordered reflection of the house itself;
large, lake-facing, quiet, with chairs on the veranda that were
comfortable.� I played with my hair as I
looked out.� It was back to its natural
color now and I felt more like myself when it looked this way.

&nbsp;

Things were
getting very interesting between us.� He achieved great pleasure in the acts of BDSM.� Last night was an example.� Blindfolded and gagged, spread-eagled on my
belly and cuffed to the wooden bed frame, I was unable to avoid the whip he
used so expertly.� Master had played with
me most of the evening, unexpectedly snapping the leather end near parts of my
body.� But he had also occasionally
scored a direct hit when he so desired; these left a series of raised welts
along my upper shoulders and ass.� Ridges
of red, raised skin that throbbed and tingled with an anticipation all their
own.

&nbsp;

He helped me
up and then uncuffed me.� After he�d
taken the gag off, he handed me a small pillow.�
I tingled all over and soon felt the familiar pleasurable warmth begin
to flow through my body as if I had been drugged.� He touched my face and to my surprise, my
body responded with rising excitement and I was immediately wet for him.� I couldn�t believe that I wanted more.� At the same time, there was a lack of
sensation inside me, as if I were filled with drifting snow.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Rasha came to me unbidden now, often in my dreams, when I could
not keep her out.� I woke with a memory
of her clear eyes.� Of what I had known
of her touch.� But in daylight, I could
always coax her back into where my heart knew she needed to be kept.�� 

&nbsp;

I was dreaming a pleasant dream---she was bent over my groin and had taken me into her mouth�I filled her
there but she somehow managed to take it all in without gagging.� My God, that spirit woman had a soft mouth
and deep throat.� Suddenly, I was
awakened by an itching nose and the melody of a soft giggle.� Above me, captured in a shaft of cascading
morning light, was Rasha.� Lying across
my bed, she was dangling her long hair playfully across my face, laughing
mischievously as she licked her lips.�
She was a woman of near heart-stopping beauty---talented and womanly and
clever---and yet the sight of me seemed to make her flush bright red.� Her smile below the nose ring was girlish,
full of unsophisticated pleasure.�
�Hello, Master,� she said, her voice soft.

&nbsp;

�Welcome back to earth, sir dream candidate,� she teased and
laughed again.� 

&nbsp;

I couldn�t help it---I
laughed and gathered her up in his arms.�
Without realizing it, the tensions and the pressures of the last couple
of months had taken their toll on me.�
She wore the diaphanous nightgown that I�d given her a few weeks
ago.� It was a gift both for her and my
hormones, a murderously expensive confection imported from Italy.� Transparent from the neckline to the floor,
cut with an opaque swirl that covered just enough and no more.� 

&nbsp;

Rasha straddled me, the
gown�s skirt hiked up to reveal her satiny thighs.� She made a quick joke that made us both
laugh.� Then she leaned forward,
shoulder-length hair veiling her face, and kissed me.� Quickly, there was no more nightgown, just
her flawless skin, lit by unseen illumination.�
Perfect breasts with nipples confined only by ring and chain.� Swell of hip.�
Head thrown back as she moved above me, called my name, cried out in
ecstasy.� 

&nbsp;

I pulled her face down to
me.� I leaned into her and let my lips
brush hers. So light.� The barest
touch.� I kissed her cheeks, her eyes,
along the lines of her jaw, her neck.� I
lingered over her pulse points, raking them lightly with my teeth.

&nbsp;

Rasha wrapped her arms
around me as her knees threatened to buckle altogether.� I could feel her heart pound.� She pulled me close, felt my hard muscles
beneath her hands.� I buried my head in
her neck and murmured things that made her gasp.� 

&nbsp;

She was mine and I proved
it twice that morning.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

He'd finally allowed me more clothing and I found that I'd
employed my near-albinism today like a fashion accessory.� I looked at myself in the mirror and knew
that I resembled nothing so much as a medieval nun rendered in polished
marble.� I�d brushed my hair forward and
dressed in ivory from head to toe.�
Short, tight skirt, ivory stockings and high-heeled ivory pumps; the
collar of my blouse standing up in back almost like a cowl.� My height and face enhanced the image, as did
my fair skin, drawn tight across cheekbone and brow.� 

&nbsp;

I think that I disturbed Master this time, no matter how often
he�d seen me and regardless of how I had been dressed.� He told me I looked like an ambassador from
the Other Side.� He showed his
appreciation too, but in a way that was associated with my accepting a lot of
pain.� Clearly I had provoked a dominance
issue with this look and I think he felt the need to reassure himself.� 

&nbsp;

He never allowed me to wear this particular combination again.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

As Rasha became more comfortable with me, my demands and her
circumstances, she began to open up.� In
addition to the deep anger she�d felt at first having her freedom taken away,
she had also borne a huge false burden of emotional guilt; she�d worn it like a
yoke.� But that was changing as we got to
know each other better, and she began to show me the real person she�d hidden
for so long inside---she was now perhaps too emotionally expressive for even my
tastes.� 

&nbsp;

Much of the time, I kept her silent.� But when I allowed her to talk, I often felt
she was like a freshman on a first date with the senior prom king, talking
incessantly, gushing, fawning, stammering and almost hovering around me.� It wasn�t that her conversation was boring or
banal.� Quite the contrary.� At other times she reminded me of the most
sophisticated woman I'd ever met; a woman that had traveled the world and seen
everything.� 

&nbsp;

I was continually impressed with her philosophical and religious
insights.� It was just that she had begun
to show an unbridled enthusiasm for life that she'd kept hidden from the world
for the last ten years; it had returned and it was overwhelming.� I observed, not for the first time, that if
you turned off the volume you would swear at times that she was thirteen years
old.� But she was good to have around and
she made my nights go faster.� And she
surprised me sometimes.

&nbsp;

Standing in
the dim light of the lavatory in the White Room, I gripped the sides of the
sink and leaned into the mirror, studying the carmine color I�d just applied to
my lips.� I lifted my arms and ran my
fingers through my white-blond hair, inhaling the scent of the perfume rising
from the warmth of the cleft between my breasts.� I was wearing a black negligee,
Galliano.� It had been a gift from him
and it clung to me like a lover.� I
smiled at myself in the mirror, then closed my eyes for a moment, my lips
parted, my lashes brushing the swell of my cheeks as I composed myself.� Thinking about what had happened between us,
I felt as though I had a secret that only he and I shared.

&nbsp;

Even as I
knew I should hate what I had discovered about myself, I had given myself over
to it with abandon.� The pleasure of
giving to another all responsibility, all control over my needs and my
desires.� I knew I pleased him, and when
he was pleased his generosity and good-will towards me knew no bounds.� But then, neither did his brutality when he
felt it was necessary.� I had a dark side
too and this was one of the main reasons that I was so strangely attracted to
the man that kept me as his slave.� Under
his expert tutelage, I�d found that I had always had a taste for the unusual,
but just hadn�t been aware of it.� 

&nbsp;

�Master?� I
said softly, pausing in the doorway so that he could see my body backlit by the
pale light behind me.� 

&nbsp;

�Come here,�
he said simply, his hoarse whisper barely audible.� 

&nbsp;

�Do you miss
me Master, when you are not here?�� I ran
my hands down over my hips, adjusting the drape of the black silk.

&nbsp;

�God,� he
whispered.� Even the sound of silk
whispering across my body seemed to drive him mad.

&nbsp;

�Why are you
wearing pajama bottoms, Master?� I asked.

&nbsp;

�I was
cold.�

&nbsp;

�But it's so
warm in here.�

&nbsp;

�It will
be,� he said, pulling back the covers and making room for me.

&nbsp;

I padded
across the room, taking only a few small steps before I reached him.� I sat on the edge of the bed and stroked his
cheek.� Suddenly I pulled back and looked
at him for a moment before I laughed and leaned over to kiss him on the mouth,
my chained breasts resting softly upon his chest.� It was a hard, brief kiss and when I felt his
probing tongue, I sat upright again.� 

&nbsp;

His hand moved
under hem of my negligee, tracing his fingers along the skin of my inner thigh
and over his mark of ownership, his fingers suddenly desperate to touch
me.� I caught his wrist and pulled his
hand away, �Please Master, not yet.�

&nbsp;

He reached
up to pull me towards him, but I pulled back, laughing.� �No, Master.�
Please, you must wait.� Let me
explore what you hide too.� Please.�

&nbsp;

I ran my
hands over the cords of his heavily muscled chest, my fingers pausing to
entwine themselves in the thatch of curly hair that began at the base of his
throat.� Then my hands moved down over
his taut belly.

&nbsp;

�No more
secrets, Master,� I said as I surveyed the pale landscape of his chest.� �Please.�

&nbsp;

�No secrets,� he said as I pressed my lips to the puckered scar on
his chest that began just below his nipple.

&nbsp;

�Tell me
about this one,� I said, my lips trailing along the outlines of the still angry
scar.� 

&nbsp;

�Well, that
was a bad one, I�ll tell you.� An arrow
got me,� he answered me.� �Cowboys and
Indians.� Charleston, nineteen seventy.� I was ten years old when that Arapaho brave
snuck up on me.�

&nbsp;

�And this
one,� I said, my lips traveling downwards across his flat belly and finally
centering on a scar; a scar that I later knew was the only visible memory of
the emergency surgery needed to repair his abdomen ruptured by the unknown
little man.� 

&nbsp;

�Self-inflicted.� I was playing �Doctor� with my cousin and she
bet me I couldn�t take out my own appendix.�

&nbsp;

�Liar,� I
said.� Then I added quickly, �Sir.�

&nbsp;

Suddenly he
looked like couldn�t breathe---as if his ribcage was taking a terrible
battering from his heart.� He looked down
to see my hand resting lightly on the folds of cloth that draped between his
thighs.� My hand traveled upwards, the
fingers parted, searching.� He was hard
as a stone when my hand firmly seized the object of its desire.� 

&nbsp;

�My Master,�
I said, turning my eyes towards him as I caressed him through his pants,
wrapping him in it, tightening and then easing my grip.� He opened his mouth to speak, but I pressed a
finger to his lips and stopped whatever words he was about to utter.

&nbsp;

�No,
Master,� I whispered hoarsely, taking his hand and crushing it against my
breast where I knew one nipple was already engorged under my top.� �Let me speak tonight.�

&nbsp;

He collapsed
back against the pillows as I bent my head to his lap, unbuttoning his pajama
bottom and freeing his gorgeous python.�
And as he lifted his hips, I yanked them down around his knees; I took
him in then, my hair cascading over his belly, my darting tongue everywhere.� I believe I was willing to offer my soul to
God if only he�d let this moment stretch out for eternity.� I had changed.� Oh yes, I had changed.� I would burn in hell for his sake, if
necessary.

&nbsp;

Licks of
fire caused Master to moan and arch upwards involuntarily.� His breathing was rapid and shallow now.� Suddenly, my mouth was at his ear, nibbling,
my own breath hot and loud.

&nbsp;

�I want
you,� I whispered.� �Now, please.� Master.��
Somehow, someway, he was on top of me peering down in the darkness.� He was looking into my eyes as though he�d
only just recognized me.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I awoke,
needing to use his bathroom.� I rose and
pulled the blanket up around his shoulders.�
He sighed, reaching for me.� I
slipped away.� I came back and re-entered
paradise, slipping into the warm bed where my lover-Master lay.� He awoke when I climbed back in beside him,
grumbled a little, reached out his long arms to pull me in close and tucked me
in under his chin, just as my father had done so many years ago.� I lay awake, fighting my nightmares, but I
knew them now for the false things they were and they couldn�t scare me
anymore.� For the last few weeks, I had
desperately forced myself� to
concentrate---to� try to forget the
crazy, unsettling feelings that wouldn't leave me alone.� What had started out in horror was now a
joyful emotion that affected the way I reacted to him.� One can fight an illness or one's destiny,
but how was I to supposed to fight the feelings that were pushing me towards this
fascinating man?

&nbsp;

Just before
I fell asleep, I made myself consciously think of every smell, every touch,
every sensation.� These were things I
would never forget.� I smiled to myself
as my eyelids closed and I remembered perhaps the only thing I'd ever learned
in high school because it sounded so cool; �Meminerunt omnia amantes�.� That's Latin for Lovers Remember Everything---and they do.� I fell asleep at last, soothed by the rhythm
of his heartbeat.�

&nbsp;

My last clear impressions were of the body beside me rearranging
itself, with breasts pressed into my back, an arm draped over me, and a
peculiarly comfortable clamping of feet, mine in hers, like hands.� Her long, smooth legs moved against each
other, then against me.� I realized my
thought processes were slowing down.�
What was offered was sometimes enough.�
Sometimes.

&nbsp;

I awoke in the morning and after hesitating, I went to Rasha.� Mostly she slept with me now, but sometimes
she needed to be alone and I allowed it; it was then that she slept in the
White Room.� And so it was this
morning---she'd gotten up� early in the
morning without awakening me and gone to her bed.� She was sleeping as I entered, and even in
sleep her legs were spread wide as she�d been taught.� I awakened her, ensuring that she began her
daily schedule on time, and as I did a wave of desire washed over me as I
watched her make her bed and clean the room.�
As much as I cared for her, discipline was still necessary in her
life.� She exercised as I prepared a
simple breakfast of a small egg on English muffins and coffee; again, I watched
intensely as she ate.� I never tired of
her beauty or her grace.� But
unfortunately, work called.� With the
quality of the help that I�d hired a few years ago, I knew that I�d have to go
to the office eventually just to ensure that my business didn�t go under.� 

&nbsp;

I had learned so much about this woman in the short time that I'd
possessed her.� When I walked out the
door this morning, I had for some unknown reason been aware that she needed
discipline today.� I left Rasha�s slave
collar connected by chain to the tracks in the ceiling.� In addition to the normal routine of cleaning
and straightening her room, I had left her specific instructions on physical
training.� While she finally seemed to be
settled in her new world, I would still check the video�s of her efforts later.

&nbsp;

Now in my small office on the outskirts of Savannah, I chewed on a
small pencil as I hummed a 60�s rock tune.�
My feet were stretched out in front of me, one foot crossed over the
other.� I had to push away from my desk
in order to do this; my legs were too long to stretch out beneath the desk
itself.� There was a wall immediately in
front of the desk with memos, postcards and fire instructions pinned on
it.� 

&nbsp;

I smiled to myself; I�d had no chance to read during the last
week---too busy with my bottom.� At first
I was lazily catching up the newspapers, but suddenly I sat upright.� I read the item through three times.� Spotted in the Statesboro Herald of all
places.� 

&nbsp;

It was being reported that an aggressive new Assistant District
Attorney, with the DA�s office for less than six months at the time, had
prematurely announced the arrest warrant for Rebecca Denholm.� However, a frustrated and over-worked local
cop had just recently leaked to the press that there just wasn�t a case to be
made.� No one would talk to the
investigators and there was no physical evidence of any wrong doing.� Over the objections of the DA, the busy
police chief had finally been forced to pull most of the task force after
fourteen weeks of absolutely no success in obtaining any incriminating evidence
that supported the charges against this female teacher.� 

&nbsp;

�Off the record� the
article strongly implied that while the authorities were pretty sure that
something had happened, they couldn�t prove it.�
And while the police still wanted Rebecca for questioning, as a result
of the premature announcement of the charges and the negative publicity now
associated with the case, unless one of the participants or a witness came
forward, the case against her would be dropped for lack of evidence.� 

&nbsp;

While it was clear that her job and her reputation were gone, in a
strange quirk of fate, instead of the public being outraged by another teacher/student
sex scandal, in Rasha�s case the public seemed to side with the woman who
newspapers proclaimed had been tarred prematurely and in the end, perhaps
unfairly.� In this, Rasha�s beauty proved
to be a god-send.� Under numerous
pictures provided by her soon to be ex-husband, the local newspapers ran the
usual charges against the City; continually emphasizing that Rasha was �innocent until proven guilty� and that
this smear by the DA�s office �could have
happened to anybody�, and that her �persecution�
was the result of the actions of an inexperienced, over-zealous public
prosecutor against a �small person,�
just an �average person� attacked by
an �uncaring, big city� Government.� 

&nbsp;

This was the Savannah DA�s third such political firestorm in less
than six months, and while he may have been a political creature, he wasn�t
stupid.� This particular disaster was too
much too soon.� Consequently, even though
it looked like it made the bile rise in his throat, he went into immediate
damage control mode; the young lawyer had immediately been publicly chastised
for his �extreme� actions, and his
lack of both �professionalism� and �common sense� and a generic apology was
then issued.� 

&nbsp;

It was late afternoon and I wanted to be alone.� Freddie and Nan picked up on this and went
home and I gratefully retired to my office again.� I shut the door, switched on the lamp and sat
behind my desk in half-darkness.� How was
I going to handle Rasha?� I would check
with some sources to ensure that the right information was being released to
the news outlets by the courts.� But if
it was, then it appeared to me that except for the formality of talking to the
police one last time, while her previous life may now be in tatters, Rasha was
free to resume it unhindered by at least the interest of the police.� This I planned on keeping close to my
vest---this was a woman that needed to be enslaved; more, she deserved to be a
slave to a man like me.

&nbsp;

I'd slept in
his bed and it was still relatively early in the evening.� I woke up as I felt the slight tingle, the
mild frisson of the shock not completely unexpected.� I felt him between my legs.� I�m being diddled.� I laid back and clasped my hand over my
still-sore stomach.� It didn�t do to get
too excited---a person could miss things if she let herself get carried
away.� 

&nbsp;

I looked
down at him.� He finally sensed my
attention and looked up with a small smile.�
Master Christian loved touching me like that.� I knew he loved the way I always yielded my
heat to him in spite of myself.� The way
that he could make me exhale my very breath into him, in the end making me beg
him to take me.� He made it a slow dance,
a subtle tease, the most delicious of agonies for me.� Sometimes he used pain in conjunction with
the touch, and other times it was the touch alone.� He so enjoyed the way my body arched towards
ecstasy with a driving need that I couldn�t begin to understand, let alone
articulate.� His was the gradual embrace,
the one which isolated and made me feel alone, so softly that I never knew that
I was held fast by it until it was too late.�
Only at the end would I gasp and struggle against the inner suffocation,
and then�.too late.� I was his once
again.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I punched my
pillow and turned over slowly.�
Again.� Again.� I will not look at the clock.� I looked at his bedside clock.� Six-thirty.�
I knew that I�d have to get up or he would punish me again for sleeping
too late.� The thought of rising wouldn�t
have seemed so daunting if I�d managed to fall asleep in the first place.

&nbsp;

In the
months that he�d kept me here, he�d treated me either as a goddess or
entitlement, depending upon his mood.�
Early on, he�d been a harsh master.�
But I�d eventually learned how to please him.� Sometimes now he was tender when he felt good
and the sex with him was very good; but sometimes it was not so good.� Last night had been��difficult.� He�d been in one of his moods.� It happened less now, but it still did.� The joy went out of him and the shadows
flooded in.� At first tender, he�d become
much rougher as one of his headaches progressed and it had seemed an eternity
before we had finally satisfied both of our needs---all of them.� I rolled on my back and stared at the
ceiling, my limbs sagging into the mattress as if they were made of lead.� I kicked off my covers slowly, then rose in
stages.� I didn�t want to wake HIM.� One leg over the side.� The other.�
Sit up.� Wait for the room to stop
throbbing.� Stand.� Walk.

&nbsp;

I slowly
walked into the White Room so as to not wake him.� Showering proved a challenge.� Even though his rules made it clear that I
could not take a shower until I'd exercised, I needed one now just to start the
day.� He�d ordered me into the White Room
and used The Discipline on me again last night.�
He used it on my buttocks or back at least once a week.� He demanded that I ask permission for it and
I had to choose the time when I wanted it, then he became quite zealous in its
use.� This was on the good days.� While the way he used it caused a lot of
pain, I was glad he had yet to leave scars.�
This was something that I checked after each session.� I hated the fact that there were parts to
this that I didn't hate---this upset me more than anything else.

&nbsp;

I had not
moved quickly enough earlier in the week and my buttocks and upper back, a
skinscape of light green and purple from his earlier attentions, were now
overlaid by a new series of lightly raised red welts.� I faced the shower head and let it beat into
my face.� By the time I emerged, eyes
stinging and back muscles twitching, my stomach had begun to ache.� He still kept me on tight rations.� Could I go back to bed in here?� I checked the clock he'd given me last
week.� Seven-thirty.� Nope.�
It would only anger him.� It was
Sunday morning and I didn�t have to exercise today.

&nbsp;

The man
whose collar I wore was so�odd at times.�
Odd, but brilliant.� So bright,
yet sometimes so lacking in�.what?� I
sighed and shook my head.� So very, very
smart about people and how to manipulate them, yet so unwise about women for
all of that.� Could you know a lot about
women without knowing a lot of women?� I
finally made myself stop thinking about it.�
I put on the bikini he made me wear during exercise and worked out even
though it wasn't required.� Would he
punish me for breaking routine?� I didn't
know.� Afterwards, I took another long
shower.

&nbsp;

After fixing
my hair and putting on a little makeup, I picked out a short, expensive yellow
and white sun-dress.� It might be early
spring, but he liked me to wear things that exposed a lot of skin.� No bra or panties of course.� Strappy sandals with unworkable heels.� I�d finally begun to get used to his
demands.� But I still didn�t have to like
them.� Especially, I thought savagely as
I pulled on the second shoe, these damned heels.� They hurt my feet and if I never saw another
pair, it would be too soon.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

Often I took Rasha's discipline far beyond kneeling on rice, for I
admit that punishment spankings turned out to be something I enjoyed giving my
lovely slave.� Sometimes when I was in a
bad mood, these encounters with Rasha got quite personal, often turning into
serious endurance events in which the challenge was to see who would give in
first.� The White Room would be so quiet
as we began.� There was always that
little hesitation as she removed what little modest clothing I allowed.� The look on her face often reminded me of
something; fear and perhaps longing controlled for too long?� Sometimes I began immediately.� Other times I was forced to do �other� things
to get her or myself into a more receptive mood.� 

&nbsp;

But deep inside I knew that this was not only what she needed, but
it was what she wanted too.� I'd known
there were women out there like her, but she was the first woman I'd possessed
that had actually learned to want what I offered.� Others might pretend, but the pretense could
only be carried on for so long before reality set in.� But not Rasha.� Sometimes she would misbehave just to earn a
spanking.� 

&nbsp;

Like tonight; I already knew exactly how it would go.� Once she was in the right frame of mind, the
badly behaved woman would be bent over my lap and the spanking would commence,
stroke after stroke on her raised and willing bottom.� She would submit totally.� We'd gone so far that there was never the
thought of physical resistance from Rasha anymore.� There was never a misunderstanding on her
part, for she knew this spanking would happen exactly according to plan. 

&nbsp;

I had thought about the unexpected treat that Rasha had proven to
be.� The reasons why a beautiful and
educated woman like her enjoyed being disciplined ranged from the profane to
the sacred.� She may have had a
masochistic desire for the sting of her Master's whip as she peaked during
sexual arousal; we both knew the line between pleasure and pain was very thin
here.� On the other hand, some people
felt an intense need to be punished for current, past, or even imagined
misdeeds.� And their Master's floggings
released them of much of their guilt; this too I felt, was much of Rasha's
motivation.� Some submissives took
discipline through devotion, to please their Master and satisfy the Doms'
sadistic urges.� Some slaves swallowed
their pain out of obedience.� On the
other end of the spectrum, a few extreme religious people perceived discipline
as completely absolving them of their sins.�


&nbsp;

When I desired, I ensured that pain was not necessarily a big part
of the punishment when I disciplined Rasha.�
Rather, if it was done right, the psychological took precedence here;
delicate skills that it had taken me years to perfect.� And at this point in her training, she had
been totally liberated from the mindset imposed by those who had no concept of
how this could make one feel.� For by
now, a serious spanking like I had planned for her tonight always humbled
Rasha; making her feel both forgiven and thankful.� 

&nbsp;

But then, sooner or later, she would regress and need a
repeat.� She was my
responsibility, and over the last few weeks I had learned her mind as well as her
body.� I knew how to act towards her now
and what to say.� Despite being a
physically tough woman, she was openly vulnerable now to having her emotions.� Manipulated.�
Should I so choose, what I said and more importantly, what I did here
could cut like a knife through the old defenses she'd erected around her mind
and her heart.� But I had found with
Rasha that as long as I was firm, she would accept incredible amounts of
degradation and pain from me.� This
because she was convinced that it was for her own good.....that I acted in her
best interest.....and mostly, she just fucking deserved it.� And finally, she double-fucking secretly
loved it.� A couple of times during the
last couple of weeks, I'd been forced to give her light maintenance spankings
just because I knew one was due and I had the power.� But I had to be honest and admit too that I
did this because I was also in the mood to give myself pleasure.� 

&nbsp;

But this was not maintenance tonight.� Not tonight.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

When we were in his home, although often quite demanding, he could
also be a gentle Master.� It was only
when we entered the 'play' room that he seemed to change.� For whatever reason, the White Room often
brought out the worst in him.� Tonight,
he seemed to have an especially strong need to take me there.

&nbsp;

Master gave me the look to quickly strip and I didn't
hesitate---it would only get worse as the night went on should I disobey at any
point.� Thankfully, he is rarely in a
mood like this---generally only when he has one of his headaches. �He enjoyed nights in the White Room because
that's when he felt the most creative...and the most receptive to the emotions
he stripped from his women.

&nbsp;

I was finished now---I quietly knelt in front of him naked.� He smiled, then quickly slapped my face as
hard as he could.� My head jerked back
and to the right, and he timed it so that when I was facing him again, he used
his backhand to perfectly slap me one more time.� This was not unexpected and was probably only
the beginning; I knew this because he slowly smiled at me. 

&nbsp;

On these rare nights, he couldn't get pleasure from me just
following his orders.� No.� Thre was a sadistic side and he enjoyed
giving me pain.� If someone offered to
buy him gifts fit for a king and endless money to spend as he chose, Master
would still undoubtedly turn it down if he could just use me, or any other
woman, like this just one more time.�
Money and gifts didn't excite him when he was like this.� But let a woman offer him her mind and her
soul---these gifts he accepted immediately although she might not appreciate
how he expressed his gratitude.� He
tormented me endlessly during these spells.�
I believe that if he felt my body could have withstood it, he would have
enthusiastically whipped me for the whole night---sometimes softly and
sometimes not.� 

&nbsp;

But always, there would an undeniable kind of love for me
too.� If others saw the same look in his
eyes that I saw when I screamed for his pleasure---and yes, for his mercy too,
I knew they would also understand. Yet, it was at these very same times that I
least understood myself.� His face would
be so still, the quiet of a winter pond covered in blue ice; but at the same
time, the coldness of his expression somehow turned me on, making me feel that
I had to offer my body in totality and with complete willingness to accept
whatever he might offer.� If only I could
offer him enough of myself, I would please him for one more night.

&nbsp;

He seemed to thrive on the emotions I gave off.� Seeing me in pain didn't do it for Master
anymore when he was like this.� But
MAKING me go through the pain, that seemed to fill him with the rushing energy
that he needed to continue performing his sadistic acts.� But even though I didn't understand it
myself, I honestly had begun to accept this now too. �

&nbsp;

No...I was lying to myself.�
I didn't just accept pain, I wanted it tonight.� I hate the fact that there are times when I
want to experience every type of pain that there might be----as long as it was
he that was offering it to me. 

&nbsp;

Master smacked my buttocks according to his own internal
needs.� Right now my cheeks were burning
as if he had lit a tiny blowtorch and held it almost against my skin, but it
didn't matter for I knew this about myself now; if it were easy here, I would
somehow leave him and look elsewhere for what I needed.� I find this hard to admit---I guess....I
guess I am a masochist.� 

&nbsp;

I had always been taught that this was a sickness, and that it was
evil and depraved.� But I know now that
this need had always been inside me and it always would be.� Somehow, I just hadn't know this about
myself, or didn't have the courage to admit it, before him.� Yes, my Master.� Whip me, beat me, even torture me, but
God!� Just don't neglect me.� Not when I need your attention.

&nbsp;

Master put a blindfold on me and tied my wrists together, then
pulled my hands above my head in the center of the room and tied them off.� He slapped me again and it was
unexpected.� I grimaced, but I dared not
make a sound.� He never gags me during
this game.� But I have learned that if I
make a noise, even a squeak when he is like this, he always punished me even
more.� But in this little game of ours, I
always lose.� He made certain he caused
me enough pain that I always finally gave in to his destruction and had to
grunt or groan to let out the residual energies that had built up inside
me.� Even as I whimpered, I knew what
this meant.� No matter how much I fought
it and no matter how soft the sound might have been, we were now going to the
next level.

&nbsp;

Even as I can't see it this time, I still know that Master stares
at me with a look of disapproval, and yet, and yet, there will be satisfaction
too that I have eventually given in to his dominant will.� This is as it has been and as it will always
be.� Master takes The Discipline and uses
it squarely on my lower back, causing me to shudder with pain.� Some blows were merely light touches.� Then comes devastation, riding on a black
skeletal horse, surgically removing any sense of proportion or mercy my Master
might have still entertained.� I have
learned to count on this.� He continued
the onslaught for more than twelve strokes, at which point I finally lost
count.� 

&nbsp;

He was finished for now and even as he breathed heavily from his
exertions, I heard a quiet chuckle.� As I
hung in my bonds, I know he examined my back and approved of his artwork, then
I sensed he smiled.� Finally, he removed
the blindfold and I could see again, even though my eyes were filled with
unspilt tears.

&nbsp;

As I expected, at this point he had to do something that was
degrading in an attempt to either make me submit or aggravate me beyond
control.� My Master leaned in quickly and
kissed me fully on the lips and when I didn't react fast enough, I knew I had
angered him.� I knew too that I would be
punished even as I look squarely in the eyes of the man that controlled my life
and apologized profusely; it was important that he knew that I mean every word.
But it did not matter and it did not end.

&nbsp;

He looked at me with a hint of disappointment and then finally the
decision had� been made; he spit in my
face.� I apparently did not show enough
remorse for my willful disobedience, for he grabbed my chin with one hand and a
handful of hair at the back of my head with the other, he pulled my head back
and forcing my mouth open.� And as his
saliva rolled down my face, he kissed me again hard, his tongue probing,
exploring, fighting with mine.� As he
pulled back from this last lingering kiss, he spit on me again, but this time
into my open mouth.� 

&nbsp;

My lips have been all over his body, feeling him, tasting his
essence with my tongue.� I have sucked on
his toes and fingers, his ears and balls and cock.� I have licked or kissed or tasted every part
of my Master, so this did not upset me.�
Truly, I could only accept what he had given me, knowing as I did that
the worst was yet to come.� He let me
savor his saliva for a moment in my mouth, then commanded me to swallow before
I licked his first spittle from my cheeks.�
This I did as best I could.

&nbsp;

Leaving me hanging from the rope and facing in the other
direction, he walked over to where he kept his personal toys.� When he returned, he circled me like a lion
would slowly circle his prey.� I was
never allowed to look down to see what he might be carrying, but could only
look directly into his eyes.� He stopped
at the edge of my vision and turned, anticipating me anticipating him.� My heart was beating like it would burst free
of my chest and my body was drenched in sweat.�
But this only pleased him even more.�


&nbsp;

He toyed with me now.� It's
an old game and we both knew the rules; it was the play of two party's that are
vastly unequal in power in the same way a Rotweiller would be, should it ever
be playing with a kitten.� Suddenly, he
turned and without warning, lashed out with the belt I have felt so many times
before.� The pain reached a crescendo of
agony as he continued spanking me, beating me.�
Oh God; not now---please, yes, now, please.� I could feel the slickness between my thighs;
I was wet.� He wasn't even half-way
finished and I was already wet for him. 

&nbsp;

He swung the belt so close to my ass that I trembled, and yet he
missed!� My involuntary look of terror
brought enjoyment to his face, for he loved seeing the fear that I showed him
in times of his recklessness.� He looked
at his target and then after one big swing, let go with a flurry of blows that
connected perfectly on my ass.� He always
called it perfect; exquisite and beautiful.�
Perhaps, maybe it was this way for him once, but I didn't believe this
anymore.� My butt felt as if he had left
no skin there.� But even though I was in
pain, a lot of pain, I took� this because
my Master was worth it.� I would have walked
through fire for him just to prove my devotion.�
I think he'd finally begun to understand this; perhaps this was why on
those nights in the White Room, rather than treat me as his loving slave, he
always treated me like I was a new woman that had never before experienced his
torment. 

&nbsp;

He softly touched my body all over again, gently exploring
territory he had first conquered weeks and months ago.� He told me he loved the expressions on my
face when I was at his mercy like this.�
Master smiled once again with the knowledge that more torment was about
to come my way.� Finally, he stepped
back, his signal that I should again prepare my body for his pleasure.� But we both know that that was physically
impossible to satisfy him.

&nbsp;

He gave me a look of satisfaction, but I knew that he could never
be truly satisfied.� Suddenly, he left
me.� I hung from my rope in the White
Room, slowly twisting.� The cuffs he used
were hard; constrictive and painful to my wrists.� I often had red marks around my wrists.� But as I hung there, I was thinking about he
and I, about us.� The best I could hope
for tonight was to sate his desires for just the evening.� But at the same time, there was definitely
something here that we both seemed to enjoy as sadist and masochist, slave and
master.� And that was each other's
company.� And even as he truly relished
torturing me, I felt too that he cared deeply for me in ways I didn't yet
understand and......but not as much as I enjoyed his terrible passions, both
emotional and physical.� 

&nbsp;

I was resting when he returned ; I was excited by his
re-appearance, but afraid of his obvious need.�
As for my need, I was quivering for my god of the whip and the
belt.� He knew this all too well, for I
could feel him feeling my need.� At the
same time, I felt inside me the impatience of a woman whose needs had not yet
been satisfied.� Men had often called me
strong, or proud and arrogant, or even headstrong and aggressive.� But none of this had prepared me for the
reality I faced here, with this one man.�
How could I fight him; how could there ever be a true battle between us
when we both knew I would always lose? �

&nbsp;

That is, you see, the conventional thinking of a vanilla
world.� The battles we fought now were
never on the physical, for that would have been too easy.� The true battles always took place in the
mental world that we both inhabited.�
Early on, I had fought him physically; vowing to never give in to his
demands on my body.� This was a war I
could never have won, and it took me weeks and numerous.....devastating
lessons.....to understand.� When I
finally realized this, I then fought against the seductive embrace of the
psychological coils of his world.� This
battle too, I eventually lost when I realized not how different we were, but
rather how similar.� Finally, now we
fought a battle of mental strengths---for the sheer pleasure it brought us
both.

&nbsp;

Even though he owned me now, if I let him beat me psychologically
in this war between us, he would OWN me.�
We both knew this.� But where
would the challenge be in either of our lives then?� For we had learned to push each other, my
Master and I.� And our battles always
ended in a tie.� For even if he ALWAYS
got what he wanted from me, we would have pushed each other to examine ever
deeper levels of our relationship---and I too would have gotten what I wanted.� I think that I would always feel the need to
challenge him like this.� 

&nbsp;

I looked at him and thought, how could I let a man bully me like
this even as he tried to hurt me more than he thought I could handle.� I knew now that even if he made me cry, the
tears were just proof that I am not necessarily female and weak, but rather
weak flesh and blood as we all were.� And
I knew that he must look at me and be thinking, how could I let a weak woman,
even a beautiful one like this, win in my world?

&nbsp;

He used the belt one more time, then he stopped to observe the physical
effects of his art.� For me, I knew the
torment was almost over, at least for tonight.�
Master looked like he was weakening in his pursuit of abuse.� He finally untied me, then laid me tenderly
across his lap.� Master smiled at the
marks left on my bottom, approving of the raised red welts that have been laid
over the older blue and orange bruises.�
He then softly caressed me just prior to spanking me with his bare
hand.� I jumped on his lap, but I should
not have been surprised.� He enjoyed this
so much now that he never noticed the tears that finally began rolling down my
pitiful face.� He had �won� again.� 

&nbsp;

Finally, he realized his temporary victory and dumped me onto the
floor.� I was, he ordered, to crawl to
the other side of the White Room and first clean, then put away the toys he had
used on me tonight.� He watched me in
satisfaction, and after I had done as he ordered, he told me to kiss his feet
and his legs.� When I did this, he
allowed me to stand, then gave me the soft, compassionate kiss of the winner
just before he left me alone.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

Master had
spanked me hours earlier in the day.� He
assured me that I had deserved the spanking, but assurances did little to
remove the pain.� Finally he had left me
alone.� Then an hour later, he came back
and from the way he stood, I knew what was next in my future.� I still hurt and had little interest in sex
at the moment, but as usual my wishes did not count.� I still would not allow myself to say that we
made love, but at the end I admit that even though I could not move as easily
as he, I was certainly as enthusiastic.�
Then he left me to recover.

&nbsp;

Now he has
just walked into the White Room a second time in the last two hours.� �And now again,� he said.� 

&nbsp;

�Oh no,� I
groaned, �Lord no, not again.� Master,
please.� For heaven�s sake.� It�s like I am laying on a coil of barbed
wire.�

&nbsp;

He just
looked at me, crooked his finger towards me, then turned and left the
room.� I followed after a second, because
we both knew that it was only his desires that counted here.� And that was only right.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I stood on the back of the veranda watching the wheeling water
birds over the lake.� I looked down at
her and was surprised.� It was mid-May
now;� she lay on a chaise lounge chair
and she�d been sunbathing.� Rasha had the
kind of complexion that quickly turned from office-white to a light
copper-bronze and after two weeks in the sun, her flawless skin positively
glowed.� 

&nbsp;

She wore a shimmering small black bikini top with black thong
bottoms, a black choker, open stiletto heeled sandals and nothing else.� It only emphasized that she had the kind of
figure that made men walk into walls.�
Although it wasn't necessary, I still wanted to make a point, so I
clipped a leash to the chain that connected her nipple rings and led her into
the White Room like a beloved dog.� This
always succeeded as a not-so-subtle reminder of her status in my life.� She stood behind me after we entered; I
turned and held her very close, nuzzling her neck and promising her that she
was the most beautiful slave I�d ever seen.�
I could see the soft smile come on her face as I spoke.� She smelled so good to me.

&nbsp;

I asked her what she thought when she wore this outfit.� With only the small smile that was necessary
when there was genuine love, she said, �If it gives you pleasure Master, then
it gives me pleasure to wear it for you.��


&nbsp;

I laughed and replied, �No, really.� What do you really think of it?�

&nbsp;

Rasha shook her head and in an earnest tone said, �Master, I
really don�t mind wearing this---it at least gives me a little support where I
need it, and it�s better than nothing.�

&nbsp;

I thought for a second and asked, �How would you have answered
that question six months ago?�

&nbsp;

�Sir.� You don�t want to
know.�

&nbsp;

�Try me.�

&nbsp;

She sighed.� �Master, I
would have said that the idea of me wearing this for any man was disgusting and
promoted an extremely sexist attitude towards women.�

&nbsp;

She thought for a second, then continued.� �I think that I would have said that any male
who liked to see women in something like this all of the time was an immature
adolescent who was probably hiding feelings of sexual inadequacy.� I also think that---�

&nbsp;

�You�re right,� I interrupted her.�
�I don�t want to know how you would have felt.� What is important is how you feel now.� And even if you don�t really feel that way,
at least you�re smart enough to keep it to yourself and live my way.� Right?�

&nbsp;

�Yes,� she turned and looked at me from under her eyelashes.� �Master.�

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I liked
everything about our relationship and wanted it to continue.� Every time he touched me or he leaned against
me, I felt the warmth and strength of his body.�
When he punished me, I knew that it was only out of a sense of love for
me and duty towards my welfare.� I felt
the immense physical attraction of my Master.�
I loved the man, yet didn�t quite know yet what to make of our
chemistry, how to handle it.� I wanted to
turn towards Master and let him know I would always be there for him.� I needed to see him and tell him that we had
made it through the toughest part.� 

&nbsp;

Perhaps I
could lose myself forever if I gave in to these intense emotions.� But I wanted more from him than I had now,
and I knew that I subconsciously pushed him for far more than I should for one
in my position.� We were like two ships
in parallel navigation over shoals and bars, and only lately had it been safe
enough to watch each other.� But we had
now gone far past those first moments of indecision

&nbsp;

Chapter 40: A mutual and satisfied sexual
act is of great benefit to the average woman, the magnetism of it is health
giving.� When it is not desired on the
part of the woman and she gives no response, it should not take place.� The submission of her body without love or
desire is degrading to the woman�s finer sensibility, all the marriage
certificates on earth to the contrary notwithstanding; Margaret Sanger.

&nbsp;

Overt symbols of our relationship soon became more important to
Rasha.� As our roles became more defined
over time, I wanted Rasha to wear better collars.� I'd purchased a nicely worked traditional
neck band in black leather.� For more
social occasions, I'd also purchased Rasha an inexpensive gold bracelet of
intricate design; this was a more subdued �symbolic collar� and it
allowed her to pass in vanilla situations.�


&nbsp;

For me, these were enough.�
But not for her.� She'd asked for
additional collars, but I'd not yet purchased them because Rasha'd become a
little too smug, a little too comfortable with her position within our
relationship.� She was becoming openly
possessive and a little resistive at the same time; sometimes subtly
questioning my day to day orders, letting me know that she sometimes found
doing what I ordered a trifling unpleasant.�
I knew deep inside she recognized this as unattractive behavior in a
woman of her status and she'd become melancholy because of it, almost as if she
wanted her freedom again.

&nbsp;

I snorted to myself.�
Freedom was not an option for her, not after all that I'd done to her
and she knew it.� I'd crashed through
infatuation with this woman and hit the ground on the other side.� She knew she belonged to me, she knew that I
could do anything I wanted to her; we both knew she just needed reminders every
now and then.� I needed a good way right
now to remind of her true position in life. 

&nbsp;

I thought back in time.� The
truth was, early in our relationship this stubborn woman had frustrated me no
end.� Despite my wicked imagination, I
guess I�m not sure what I had expected when I took away her freedom.� And even after I felt I'd finally broken her
over something that seemed important at the time, it'd only been a short while
before she recovered her spirit and resisted me on some new matter.� 

&nbsp;

But now she was mine; I looked at Rasha�s beautiful body for a
moment as she walked away from me to the bathroom before I softly said,
�Tiptoes.�� I watched in anticipation as
she stopped cold, just as she had been trained.�
And then I watched the enticing rise of her calf muscles as she
complied.� 

&nbsp;

And now months later, I knew that Rasha still feared what she saw
as weakness---the fact that even as she knew that �Tiptoes� was demeaning to
her as a modern woman, she had come to look upon this as a perfectly natural
and acceptable rite in her new life.� 

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

It has now
been more than four months since he made me take his collar and Master
Christian finally had enough confidence to take me out for an extended
time.� Tonight we were going out to eat
for the second time.� 

&nbsp;

He'd set
boundaries and I knew to obey him now.� The sense of newness, of specialness, of
being in exactly the right place and time, of being exactly where I should be
and who I should be.......this feeling has never worn off.� Locked in the White Room, we'd
experimented for endless hours, looking for answers to questions I'd never had
the courage to ask myself and searching for boundaries beyond which I would not
go.� Initially, there had been few and
now to my despair, there were almost none; he told me that I'd come far and had
�performed well;� his praise
sounded as if he spoke of a well trained horse, but even so I felt immense
pleasure when I had obviously pleased him.�
Now he felt it was time to celebrate. 

&nbsp;

But I also
sensed that something had recently changed.�
There was an odd, charged feeling to the air.� I was sure that I'd picked up some alteration
in our relationship that was too subtle to be identified; my mind had somehow
not yet supplied the explanation. 

&nbsp;

I soaked in
a hot shower for almost half an hour, then I shaved my legs even though they
didn�t really need it and washed my hair as well, which didn�t need it
either.� After spending twenty minutes
rubbing lotion on my skin, I walked naked from the bathroom and stood, hands on
my hips, staring at the clothes laid out on my bed.� He was allowing me to choose tonight, and I
just couldn�t make up my mind.� A dress,
a gown and a skirt and blouse; I could not for the life of me choose between
them.� And until I decided that, I could
not decide on the color of my stockings, which meant that I couldn�t yet choose
my shoes, let alone any accessories.

&nbsp;

I have
always been used to dressing to suit the occasion.� Perhaps that was the problem; I wasn�t sure
what the occasion actually was.� I wasn�t
sure of my Master�s intentions, of how he felt.�
I knew he loved me....I hoped.� I
knew I loved him.� Was my confusion his
fault, or my own?� I felt as nervous as a
cornered rat, and afraid of coming to the wrong conclusion.� If I dressed one way, perhaps he would come
to the wrong conclusion too?� What did
that mean?� What did any of it mean?� What did he want me to look like tonight?� Pretty or plain?� Hard or soft?�
Was I supposed to be sleek or bulky?�
Could I dress to please myself?

&nbsp;

It had
always been so easy before.� For school,
I dressed hard and efficient, because that was what was required.� For a dinner party, I would be elegant and
intelligent.� Receiving friends at home,
I was just slovenly enough to make everyone comfortable at my house.

&nbsp;

And for an
intimate dinner with a man, one that was also my Master�..?� That depended upon what I thought the man
felt about me and what he wanted from me; and what I felt---in return.� I loved him and I knew I was his property, so
what would he want to see me wear?� There
was the blue jersey dress, which came to my knees, and showed a lot of my arms
and shoulders.� There was the dark blue
gown that he�d given me, one that covered most of my body like a shield, but
was tight and sexy.� Or there was the
skirt and blouse.� The blouse that could
be worn open-necked, or else clamped shut and tied at the neck.� 

&nbsp;

Decisions,
decisions.� All covered the light bruises
that remained on my lower back and butt, and if I left the choice to the last
minute, I�d have to make a snap judgment.�
So be it.� Most people that had
known me from before had thought me unflappable---but that certainly wasn�t
true where this man was concerned.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I was happy
and excited now, a giddy child being taken to a circus for the first time.� Master had chosen a nice restaurant, but
parked a little too far away.� He'd
unexpectedly opened my door for me and I had self-consciously snaked my way out
of the car in the way that I knew seemed to hypnotize some men.� I'd seen distinguished-looking men stop in
the parking lot that night, startled as they watched me exit the car.� My collar for tonight was a one-inch wide
black velvet choker and the more formal gold slave bracelet; I wore the metal retainer in my septum---the
nose ring would have drawn stares and clashed with my gown.� The tight, one-shoulder floor-length column
dress in dark blue which I now wore had not been my first choice.� Or my second.�
Or my eighth.� But I kept coming
back to it; the material and cut of the dress whispered �expensive� with a French accent.

&nbsp;

I tugged at
the dress again as I struggled to keep up with him.� My legs felt hot under the sheerest black
stockings; they actually looked almost grayish-black and were held up by a
black lace garter belt.� My current foot
wear---strappy, black and extremely high heeled, had been chosen because they
kept the dress from dragging on the floor.�
I straightened as best I could in my impossible shoes.� 

&nbsp;

I�d worn
little real clothing in the preceding weeks and months, and it had been a long
time since I�d had to look this polished.�
The double-wide door slid open as he approached the one story
building.� He finally stopped and turned
to me.� He watched intently as I caught
up with him.� His face lit up, �I picked
that dress.� I must say that I have
excellent taste.�

&nbsp;

I tugged at
the gown�s rear.� �Please Sir, it�s too
tight.�� The back of my neck tingled as
he lagged behind to take in the view.� 

&nbsp;

�No, not a
bit.� Just confirms to everyone that you
have a tiny waist and very nice derri�re.��


&nbsp;

I
snorted�.most respectfully; I was in a good mood and looking forward to the
evening.� The four-star restaurant had a
blue-blazered door man who was a grizzled, but genial Sikh with �Raghubir� on a
small name tag.� He looked at me as I
said, �Master Christian, party of two.�

&nbsp;

Raghubir�s
brown eyes went wide, but he quickly recovered.�
By this time, my Master had glanced at me and I knew I'd made a mistake
in taking the lead like that.� Would I
never learn?� I had no excuse except that
I felt as feather-brained� as a dizzy
school girl.� Raghubir opened the door
and escorted us to the hostess, Master in the lead and me to his right
rear.� She was a young woman that stood
on endless legs capped by a blank, beauteous face with the big, empty eyes of a
murder victim.� �Ophie,� (as I had now
named her) asked the name of our party with the delivery of an actress trying
to give importance to a bit part.� Master
Christian gave his last name and she went searching for it in her reservation
book, certainly the only book she�d ever read through to the very end.� She murmured his name, pleased to have
learned a new word.� Eventually, she
found it and we were in.

&nbsp;

The dark
green and silver room was furnished with a tasteful, expensive blend of ornate
modern and stark antique.� My step quickened.� God,
I�m starved, I thought.� Over the
past few months, it seemed that I could never get enough to eat.� It had been a continual part of my
training.� 

&nbsp;

I pulled up
short.� A man and a woman were coming our
way; he had his hand outstretched towards my Master.� Master Christian walked forward and greeted
the two.� He then turned to me and said,
�This is Master Ridgeway, Master Durien Ridgeway.�� 

&nbsp;

I quickly
glanced at Master Durien with no expression on my face, then lowered my eyes in
what I hoped looked like deference.� I'd
thought we would be eating alone tonight.�
Previously instructed by Master Christian regarding the protocol he
associated with one of my lowly status, I forced myself to extend my hand as
Master Durien pursed his lips and looked me up and down.� His was a masculine beauty that I had only
rarely seen.� Tall, narrow waist and big
shoulders.� Short black hair tightly wound
to the skull, perfectly chiseled features, thick, long eyelashes that framed a
pair of large, heavy-lidded black eyes that were like deep holes into which a
woman could fall and float downwards for a very long way---

&nbsp;

He reminded
me of old pictures that I�d seen of Rudolph Valentino.� He seemed as calm as stone, yet the sharp
cast of his features was offset by the glitter of his black eyes---I didn�t
like him.� 

&nbsp;

At the same
time, I was gripped by his compelling facial beauty.� I just wanted to gaze upon him without
speaking for as long as he would allow.�
In that moment, I believed I knew what an artist felt when gripped by
the muse---an absolute obsession to possess and express the feeling of a
submersion into boundlessness.

&nbsp;

�I�ve looked
forward to meeting you�..Sub-Rasha.�� His
accent was clipped and difficult to place.�
Early Madonna British, I thought.�
His voice and manner were layered with complexities of darkness and
light.� There was something bad here as
well as good, as well as things that defied a label.� I was certain that he never once blinked as
he shocked my system with the fiercest look of total understanding that I�d
ever seen.� He seemed to read my soul.

&nbsp;

Even though
my first response was to not particularly care for him, at the same time I
decided that I must have been wrong; it must have been one of the few odd times
that my feminine intuition had failed me.�
It was impossible to put that much stock into my first reaction, if only
because he was so damn attractive.� (I
knew that there was an underlying flaw in this line of reasoning, but wouldn�t
the world be so much better if we tried harder to put our trust into beautiful
Master�s who dressed really well and purchased superior colognes?)

&nbsp;

Master
Ridgeway beckoned to the slight young woman who appeared lost among the
furniture.� �This is��Sub-Angie.�

&nbsp;

Angie
stepped forward and with Master Christian's quick nod of approval, I replied,
�Hello.� How are you?�� Angie�s outfit, a fitted copper gauze gown
with matching nosebleed heels, seemed to be giving her trouble as well.� I studied her face.� Wide-spaced mossy green eyes, carrot red
curls shot through with gold, stubborn chin, all combined to uncover what I'd
hoped were long-dead memories.� I was
certain that I�d had this girl�s younger sister in one of my classes when I had
first started teaching at my last school.�
I accepted Angie�s subdued greeting just as Master Christian began to
herd us towards a dinner table.� 

&nbsp;

We were both
of the same status, Angie and I; that of the Possessed.� But for some reason, I felt that she had
required much less 'encouragement' to
embrace our unique lifestyle than had I.

&nbsp;

The men had
drinks before dinner and I sat quietly next to Master Christian.� I wanted to sit even closer and take his hand
in mine.� Instead, I just sat silently
and watched as he and Durien conversed about meaningless trivialities.� He took a small pull at his bourbon on the
rocks and I could detect the aroma; caramel and chocolate and grown-up.� A waiter finally appeared; Master Christian
looked at him and said, �Soft-shell crabs.��
The waiter nodded and turned to me.�
Master counseled me in the way that I knew was a an order, �If you�re
hungry, the soft-shell crabs are out of this world.�

&nbsp;

�Soft-shell
crabs, please,� I intoned smoothly with a small mouthed smile, handing the
waiter my menu while suppressing a tidal wave of absolute panic.� I have avoided soft-shell crabs my entire
life.� I�m not comfortable with any
method of consuming them.� I�ve seen
people hold them in both hands, biting away at entire dead animal as if it were
a foul gray sandwich.� I hate soft-shell
crabs.

&nbsp;

�Good
choice,� Master nodded.

&nbsp;

�Yum, Sir� I
concurred.� He glanced at me quickly, but
said nothing.

&nbsp;

Silence fell between us.� My head down, I sensed Master Durien's
sidelong scrutiny, Master Christian's more direct scrutiny.� I looked up and found everyone halted in
mid-conversation, staring at me curiously.�
I sat quietly facing my plate again, not drawing any further attention
to myself, pretending that this was all normal, that I�d done this a thousand
times, that I had never been reluctant or ashamed or forced.� I finally looked up at Master Christian, my
expression expectant but guarded, withholding any further comment or reactions
until I could gauge my Masters response, then temper mine accordingly.� Slowly it dawned on me that no one seemed
angry and I could feel the color come back into my face.

&nbsp;

The food was
actually good even though the conversation was unremarkable.� Master Durien may or may not have been
married to Angie, but there was no doubt now that she was of the collar, just
like me.� While we both were attentive to
our masters, I was quiet and Angie seemed to take my lead.� The men talked and laughed, eating slowly as
the appetizers appeared.� Master Durien
rattling on, a captive in his own recollective jet stream.� The balance of the meal passed uneventfully.� Except for a couple of intense glances at me
from Master Durien, the men ignored the two of us and Angie chewed
thoughtfully, her expression placid.�
Embers of conversation sparked fitfully, only to die.� Bored, I was forced to cross and re-cross my
legs to ease the pressure on my lower back.� Except for one instance of fashion
commentary about my dress, Angie remained silent.� Ridgeway was sociable, though guarded with
me.� Our host alternated between
expansiveness and distraction.� 

&nbsp;

An after
dinner iced-water in hand, even though it may have showed bad form, I asked
Master Christian if I could be excused.�
With his permission, I left the three behind to talk, or in Angie�s
case, to listen.� 

&nbsp;

I strolled
around the entrance hall, glancing at the pictures crowding the walls.� I shifted my weight from one high-heeled foot
to the other and looked at the best paintings.�
The subject of each was inscribed on a brass plaque at the bottom of the
frame.� There was a water color of beach
life in California, and another of a town in Boston.� Some government buildings in Washington were
depicted in oil, along with a grand plantation house in Georgia and a panoramic
view of New York.� 

&nbsp;

I was still
staring at a painting that depicted a white clapboard house overlooking a long,
sandy beach.� It perfectly captured the
extraordinary quality of the light.� I�d
forgotten how much I missed being surrounded by fine paintings.

&nbsp;

I heard
nothing for a moment, then a slow tread of footsteps from behind that set my
heart pounding.� �That�s a nice piece
they purchased three years ago,� Master Ridgeway said as he drew alongside
me.� I experienced a sickeningly familiar
turn of the stomach as I glanced into the dining room.� My Master was holding forth and gesturing
broadly as a seated Angie stared and nodded like someone in a trance.� 

&nbsp;

I watched as
Master Durien's face took on a new expression.�
But I could tell that it was only an approximation of a face that he'd
once seen, one that had carried interest and concern, something that he'd
perhaps found intriguing.� There was
something�off about him.� It was too
fluid.� It was like he was trying on
different personalities, seeing which one would look best to me in public.� I struggled to keep my tone level and chose
to be daring.� �If you have anything to
say to me, Master Ridgeway, you really should say it to my master or wait until
you sober up.�� 

&nbsp;

Dom
Ridgeway�s glower sharpened.� �For one
who has committed herself to another's desires, your talk is very sharp.�� He hesitated for a second, �You don�t like
me�..what was your last name?�� He waited
for what seemed an eternity, but I didn�t reply.� Finally, he continued.� �That�s fine---you�re not mad for me, are
you?� So, no more talking for us---I�ll
be gone now.�� He turned to go, then
suddenly turned back to look at me, �He�s right.� You are one that is not yet fully tamed.� I look forward to our next meeting.�

&nbsp;

A shiver went down my spine and I felt almost like he was a
ghost.� Ghosts aren't like they show in
cartoons.� They have bodies, they eat
food, make love.� But they're empty
people because they're just visiting.�
Trying to finish unfinished business.�
A lot of hitchhikers, some of the lonely-looking people you see in a
train or bus station, they're ghosts.�
Certain parts of the country attract them.� Louisville---loaded.� Same with the New England states, the
Carolinas.� This man was like that---and
he scared me.

&nbsp;

As he left,
I took a deep breath and tugged at my bodice, working the tension out of my
neck and shoulders.� I could have cut the
atmosphere with a knife.� I'd been
inappropriately bold and Master Ridgeway seemed to have taken an instant
dislike to me even though we�d barely exchanged five words the whole
evening---perhaps that was why he felt the way he did?� I wasn�t too concerned about Master
Durien.� In fact, I considered the
evening a great success as long as I wasn�t recognized as a missing school
teacher.

&nbsp;

Angie
bounded to her feet as Durien and I re-entered the dining room separated by
about thirty seconds and a million light years of evolution.� Her enthusiasm withered as soon as she met
her Dom�s eyes.� I stopped as Durien
continued in to meet the two.� Angie then
walked over to me, looking at me for the first time with something akin to a
smile.� �It�s been a long night.�

&nbsp;

I nodded,
�It has.�

&nbsp;

Angie was
about to say something else, but Ridgeway had returned.� He linked her arm through his and led her
away without saying another word to me.�
He was a Dominator; one of those heavy-handed and authoritative men that
always worked at governing every part of the woman they were with.� To be with a man like that would be awful; to
allow every aspect of your life to be totally controlled by one like him would
be intolerable.� To be married to him
would be even worse.� I would hate it.

&nbsp;

�What was
that all about?� Master Christian asked as the sliding doors closed.� �Don�t tell me---Master Durien was being Dom
Durien.�� 

&nbsp;

I nodded, my
whole body suddenly tired.� �Can you take
me back now?� Please Sir?�

&nbsp;

He looked up
at the ceiling and exhaled audibly.�
�Okay.�� He was silent for a
second, �He liked you, Dom Durien I mean.�

&nbsp;

�Please, I
seriously doubt that.� Sir.�� I rubbed my stomach; it suddenly ached.� �I�d really like to go now.�� I tugged as unobtrusively as could at the
bodice of my dress again.� A waste of
time---the silky material snapped back into place like a second skin.

&nbsp;

�Are you
okay?�

&nbsp;

�I just ate
too much.�� I�d snapped at him and
suddenly I felt a tingle of fear---I didn�t want to make my Master angry.� He had too much power.

&nbsp;

�Do you like
your gown?�� He hadn�t seemed to notice
my shortness.

&nbsp;

�Nothing
fits me anymore, Sir.� Not even the new
things you�ve bought me.�

&nbsp;

�I
disagree.� The dress is perfect.�� He chucked me under chin.� �It goes well with the new woman that I�ve
liberated from within the old.�� 

&nbsp;

He hesitated
and then leaned in closely, lightly embracing me.� His breath smelled of wine.� I was still upset and made another mistake,
breaking the embrace before he was ready and rushed to the door.� He slowly followed with a slight smile on his
face.� 

&nbsp;

I�d become
used to our relationship over the last several months and had even come to
accept my role in it.� I had begun
sleeping with him a lot more at that point.�
I may still be married to another man (until he divorced me), but we
both knew that I was my Master�s woman now.�
Tonight it seemed, he wanted something else instead.� We arrived home without saying another word
to each other and he led me directly into the White Room where he told me to
remove my gown.� I looked at for him for
just a second and then began to comply.� 

&nbsp;

I unzipped
myself in back and finally skinned my way out of the tight fitting dress and
dropped it on the floor. Then I bent over to remove the heels so that I could
be blessedly barefoot.� He told me to
stop.� My feet hurt and I hesitated for
just a second before standing upright before him again.

&nbsp;

He watched
me the whole time with an expressionless face.�
In an attempt to please him, I'd immediately assumed a submissive
posture that I knew he liked.� I had worn
no panties or bra under the gown and when it was finally off, I was naked
except for the garter belt and sheer stockings.�
There were no pressure lines on my body from tight underwear and I stood
in front of him, flawless except for the faint, fading marks of his last
punishment near the upper inside part of my left thigh and lower back.

&nbsp;

Now he led
me to my bed.� Wordlessly, I laid down
for him, at which point he cuffed both of my wrists to the head of the
bed.� He took out the longest penis gag
he'd ever used on me and without any prompting, I opened my mouth to accept
it.� The gag went so far into the back of
my mouth that it felt like it was going down my throat---I forced myself to
ignore my gag reflex.� 

&nbsp;

He was considerate,
lifting my hair and resting my head on a pillow; after he had fastened the gags
strap around my neck, he took out a forty inch spreader bar and began to cuff
my ankles to it.� I knew at this point
that the evening would be a long one.�
With a full belly, I honestly wasn�t up for it, but knew that I had
little real say in the matter.� I had
learned my lessons well over the last few months; although generally gentle
with me now, when within the White Room I was his to do with as he
pleased.� 

&nbsp;

That was our
agreement.� Although initially difficult
to accept, it had been this way from the beginning and would remain that way
until he tired of me.� I'd recently begun
attempts to subtly influence him towards giving me more of what I wanted rather
than just what he desired.� If I ever
wanted to influence him, I knew I had to do it subtly.� It was however, difficult to be subtle with a
gag in your mouth.� 

&nbsp;

I knew he
cared for me and I desperately wanted to keep him interested in me because I
had not only accepted my new life; I�d settled into our routine and had begun
to feel great pleasure from his attentions and my new surroundings.� But I just wanted a little more than I had
right now.� Depending upon my mood of the
moment, I bounced back and forth between just accepting everything and
absolutely adoring him.� 

&nbsp;

I was tired
tonight, and my mood was a little more on the accepting side than that of
adoration.� I tried to deny everything to
myself, but it was no use.� God, I
suddenly realized that I truly cared for this man so much---I knew that I'd
begun to love him.� It was obvious---even
as I became emotionally involved with him and even as I accepted it, I still
knew it was a mistake.� It was crazy, I
told myself, I couldn't love him.� Not
really.� I wouldn't allow this

&nbsp;

He gently
tightened the ankle cuffs to avoid running my stockings.� Finally, he tugged on the bar to ensure that
my arms were taut above my head before he fastened the spreader bar to the foot
of the bed.� He looked down at the
nakedness between my legs for a second before he left the White Room, leaving
the doors open that led into the Master bedroom.� My hips were already aching from having my
legs forcibly spread so far apart when suddenly, I heard voices.� Master walked back into the White Room
accompanied by Dom Durien.� Durien looked
at my Master and said, �My little whore�s waiting for you on your bed.� She wants it rough tonight.�

&nbsp;

Master
smiled grimly at Durien and said, �I�m ready; I�ve been ready all night.�� 

&nbsp;

In total
shock, I looked at my Master.� His
features seemed rigid with an absence of emotion, his skin as white as if his
blood was leaving him.� Suddenly, I knew
exactly what was going to happen, how it was all going to end tonight.� I watched as if everything were taking place
on TV, as if it had nothing to do with me.�
He was leaving me, leaving me to Durien�
Suddenly, Master Christian was already as far away from me as was my
husband.� Farther even.

&nbsp;

I knew then
why my Master and I had not had sex for the last two days.� I did not like this strange new man; even
worse, for some reason I feared him at an almost genetic level.� Bound, I began to struggle in earnest, but my
Master had done his work well.� I was
totally helpless in front of the two men.�
I looked at my Master with wide accusing eyes---this act went far beyond
any unspoken agreement we might have had about our relationship.� Angie stood next to him, eating up my Master
with her eyes.� A bitter, bilious poison
filled my heart and stomach.� After
looking at me for another moment, my Master turned and fled the room, leaving
Durien with his prize.� He walked over to
me and looked down with an enigmatic smile on his face.� �You were a mouthy little slut tonight.� You didn�t think you�d be seeing me quite so
soon, did you?�

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I walked away from Rasha without a second thought or backwards
glance.� I looked with anticipation upon
Angie as she lay upon my bed in all of her red-headed glory.� What an exquisite body.� She was younger than Rasha; her body more
lush, her curves more rounded.� Her flesh
was cool and firm, marked with only a few bruises on her back and buttocks from
when her Master had last felt the need to punish her.

&nbsp;

What I'd set up for Rasha played softly in the back of mind, but I
planned to wash away my feelings inside the body of the new girl.� Angie looked at me with a smile upon her
face.� She lay upon her back with her
knees drawn up slightly and spread, her arms clasped behind her head.� I stripped as Angie watched---and she had no
doubt I desired her.� With no foreplay, I
mounted the beautiful young girl and with brutal vigor, plunged deeply into her
as yet unready vagina.� This was my
answer to the unfamiliar emotions I had felt only minutes ago.

&nbsp;

Angie cried out in quick pain, but I didn't care.� She was a well trained little slut and kept
her knees spread wide for my continued pleasure.� All but the very core of my being rejoiced; I
had penetrated Angie�s body with the awareness and perfect ease of a diver entering
a blood-warm lagoon.� Then a sense of
euphoria swept away every other feeling.�
Although not common six months ago with my previous non-consensual
dates, these were sensations I was experiencing more and more when with Rasha.� The feeling was not simply that of a drug
high or the instant before orgasm, though it encompassed those things.� There was also an enormous sense of
well-being and the triumphant riding down of an aggressive opponent.� There were no false qualities to my
perceptions now, for mine was the clarity of cells in a diamond lens as I jack
hammered into Angie�s perfect body.�
Could I experience the same sense of ecstasy with another woman?� Only vaguely did I hear Rasha�s muffled cries
begin from the other room.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I screamed
my frustration and anger into the gag; this wasn�t part of our agreement; I
tried to say that this shouldn�t be happening, not to me, not with him.� But my sounds were completely muffled and
meaningless to anyone listening; I knew from previous experience that the gag
worked well at keeping a hurting woman�s screams contained within the small
room.� And this new man watched, amused
by my pointless urgency.� 

&nbsp;

Dom Durien
took his time; he allowed me to struggle to close my legs for almost a minute
as he peered at my naked and hairless vagina, the muscles on the insides of my
thighs standing out in relief with my effort.�
But my ankles were firmly cuffed and I would not close my legs again
until one of the men chose to take mercy upon me.� This I was sure, would not be happening
soon.� I didn�t know what to do, which
way to turn.� It was as if he could smell
my panic, taste it.� Finally, I stopped
struggling and concentrated on breathing heavily through my nose.� 

&nbsp;

With a
sinking feeling, I heard him say softly as he looked down upon me, �The next
move is mine, you little whore; but the suffering is yours.

&nbsp;

Durien sat
on the edge of my bed and began stroking my body.� His hands seemed to roam forever between my
thighs, first rubbing my brand then searching in vain for moisture; the wet
slickness that would prove my desire for him.�
And even though he wouldn�t find it, he never stopped.� Slow and light as a feather, his strokes
continued between my legs, now splitting my labia and stroking each separately
for several minutes before he finally put one finger inside my vagina.� 

&nbsp;

As he did
this, he talked to me.� Child's play for
him as a child, he said softly, sincerely, had been pulling the wings off flies
and vivisecting kittens.� He knew this
was a sure early sign of a sociopathic and dangerous psychotic personality---he'd
earned his living as a professor of psychology and taught these things in his
abnormal-psychology courses---but this didn't bother him.� What the conformity-straight jacketed
mediocrities labeled as sociopathology, he knew to be liberation---liberation
from social constraints that the weak millions never thought to challenge.� Unsentimentally, he'd known of his own
superiority for decades.� Now, he
promised me, I was going to learn what this meant.

&nbsp;

Durien
scared me, but it was too late to do anything about it.� He now began a relaxed in and out motion that
he kept up for over a minute before he crooked his finger and began searching
for that small pad of sensitive tissue on the inside of my pubic bone.� Once he found it, he massaged my G-spot with
his finger tip for a couple of minutes. 

&nbsp;

No man had
ever done this to me before in quite this way.�
I tried to ignore it, but after a couple of minutes of his attention, I
suddenly realized how much I had begun to respond to him.� I first felt a misplaced sense of loyalty to
my Master, struggling to avoid responding to anything this man might do.� But quickly, my mind let me through a series
of vignettes, all of which entailed my Master's various betrayals.� So, in what could only have been a need for
revenge, I made a conscious decision to open myself to the man who now worked
on me.� I spread my knees a little
further apart for him.

&nbsp;

Soon
thereafter, I felt a moment of utter humiliation as I had an overwhelming urge
to pee.� And in one of those slow-motion
moments of horrible fascination in which no detail is too small to be
overlooked, I noticed the need only increased as he continued to manipulate
me.� Suddenly, unexpectedly, I felt
myself shudder as a wave of burning desire claimed my body.� I was wet now, very wet.� He was far too intimate, far too effective;
even if I planned on cooperating in only small ways, he was too confident in
his ability to manipulate my emotions and reactions---he was far too good---I
had to stop this.� But even as I made the
conscious decision to try to slow him down a little, my body claimed me again
and I was suddenly helpless.� As soon as
I could think, I began struggling, but it didn�t do any good.� There was no mercy in this man; he kept me
trapped with his finger and immediately began working me again.� Within what seemed only a few seconds, I felt
my body responding to his manipulations a third time.� And when I finally came again, he took me a
fourth time this way.� 

&nbsp;

It was as if
I danced naked for him in a blacked out room which was lit only by a strobe
light.� My vagina and thighs opened for
him in slow-motion---every time I could rationally think about fighting what
this man was doing to me, there would be another flash and a new part of my
body would respond to his magic fingers by opening inside my groin, claiming me
all over again.� I hated being
manipulated like this, hated what this man was doing to me; yet my cuffed hands
fluttered helplessly now, not even fighting my bonds as his fingers did their
awful magic inside my pelvis.� For the
first time and to my great shame, my knees willingly opened wider without my
conscious thought as he worked between them.�


&nbsp;

Finally, he
pulled his finger from inside my vagina and slowly trapped the now stiffened
nub that was my clitoris.� Pinching it
lightly between finger and thumb, he rolled it and stroked it.� I was becoming moister and moister by the
second; I couldn�t help myself---my lungs were heaving for air as I began
thrusting my chest at him for his attention.�


&nbsp;

I arched my
hips to help him as he slowly ran his left hand between my legs and under my
hips.� His forefinger explored and
circled me there, then suddenly it penetrated my anus.� Durien looked at me as he deliberately buried
his finger inside me up to the last knuckle.�
I looked away, refusing to meet his eyes.� 

&nbsp;

Now he
hesitated.� �A little melodramatic, I�m
afraid.� But you really would have looked
good tonight as a table decoration.�� He
slowly rotated his finger, crooked it inside my anus and then slowly withdrew
it, always maintaining the pressure of his fingertip on the side of my rectum. 

&nbsp;

From there,
his hands slid back between my legs where he reached down and I felt him scoop
my heat into his hand for a moment.� Then
his hands lazily drifted up my belly and onto my breasts, both filling with my
flesh.� Now he rotated his hands and
cupped them, pressing my hardening nipples into his palms.� There was an ease in the way he worked my
breast rings; almost a familiarity to his touch.� This stranger seemed familiar with every
sacred secret about my body; how I became moist when touched a certain way
between my legs and how when I was cold or excited my nipples crinkled up and
within seconds poked out like daggers.� 

&nbsp;

Even though
it was only in the back of my mind at this moment, the worst betrayal of the
evening was that these things he did to me were the things that Master
Christian had learned about me; Dom Durien HAD to have been given all of the
intimate details of my body that it had taken my Master months to learn.� He suddenly squeezed hard and I closed my
eyes as they went wet with the pain that washed over me.� Suddenly he released my breasts and I opened
my eyes to see why.

&nbsp;

Dom Durien
had been carrying a small bag that he now opened and dumped on the mattress
beside my chest.� He began pawing through
the contents and I lifted my head to focus on what his hands held.� There were pincers and vises and clamps.� I felt a terrible sinking feeling as I
recognized a cruel looking pair of clamps that could only be for my
nipples.� The clamps were tightened by a
small screw and the jaws each had small cruel-looking metal teeth.� I knew they would be extremely painful on my
sensitive nipples.� 

&nbsp;

He had other
clamps too; thin wire loops that slid shut on metal sleeves and which had small
metal weights on the ends.� Larger wire
loops that could only go around the base of my breasts.� And there was more.� A small chromed butterfly shaped vibrator and
lengthy rod; a rod that was far too long and upon which five large shiny black
balls had been mounted.� Everything
looked cold and clinical; everything gleamed and reflected the ceiling
lights.� My Master used things like this
on me often, but he generally freed me after I had achieved liberation from my
body.� However, none of these had ever
looked as cruel or oversized as what this man had brought with him.� And my Master never had this kind of look in
his eyes.� I now understood why Angie
looked so cowed when she was with her husband.

&nbsp;

Finally, Dom
Durien smiled as he looked me in the eyes.�
�He calls you Little Slave doesn't he?�
Well, Little Slave, this isn�t about you being punished for something
you�ve done or me inflicting pain because I�m a sadistic bastard---although I
am.� This is about humans being pack animals
like dogs rather than solitary hunters like cats.� Tonight is about dominance and confirming for
your betters your role in the hierarchy of the pack.� This is about you willingly�..or
unwillingly�..giving to the pack leader anything he might desire.� 

&nbsp;

After a
moment of silence, Durien continued.� �I
understand that your nipples are extremely sensitive and that you truly enjoy
pain.� You are SUCH a slut; we will be
having fun tonight.� You've memorized the lyrics to a new life.� Now it's time to learn the music deep in your
bones.�� With
this, he lifted a pair of pliers and snapped the jaws shut several times.� �Oh yes,� he drew out the ssss sound like the
hiss of a rattlesnake, �there will be fun tonight.�� My body arched and bucked as he ran the cold
metal over my body before he used it.� 

&nbsp;

He possessed
me that night for over four hours.� I
shrieked for his insatiable pleasure almost the whole time; but having spent
much of the evening with the gag in my mouth, my screaming had not seemed to
appease him.� And when I was not
screaming, I had been gagged by his cock as he stuffed it down my throat.� In any case, at the end my throat was sore
and my voice hoarse and cracked.� Even as
my emanations from within had wept incessantly for what he did to me, he seemed
possessed the whole time by the most violent desires that showed only in his
black eyes---I now understood that it was absolute cruelty masquerading as
passion.�� He hadn�t used the pliers;
they�d been only for show and to give me a spike of fear. �Too, none of the marks on my body were
permanent; they would be gone in a few days.�
But he had worked and sweated over me, obviously enjoying my distress;
the look on his face and my uncontrollable reactions to his research on my body
would remain in my mind for a long time to come.� 

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

Still bound
and gagged, I had attempted to fight Durien in the beginning, but it had done
no good.� He had first placed a thin,
flexible constricting metal band around the base of each of my breasts and
tightened it until any blood flow in or out had been cut off.� Even worse, the constricting metal band had
small plastic teeth set into it so that every movement of my chest felt like I
was sawing off my breasts.� My captured
breasts had ached and throbbed with each beat of my heart, and at the end they
had felt like they would explode.� Dom
Durien had continually drawn a sharp fingernail across the sensitive skin of my
bulging breasts and nipples; every time he had touched me like that I knew the
smooth, over-filled skin of my breast would rupture and the insides burst free
from the ever-increasing internal pressures.

&nbsp;

He had spent
even more time on my nipples; both were red and raw from the various clamps
that he had used.� He enjoyed fastening
his nipple clamps too tight, enjoyed seeing the little red beads of blood that
welled up around the sharp teeth.� Even
now, hours later my freed nipples remained swollen, each the size of small
strawberries due to the thin loops of fine wire that had been tightly looped
around them at the base of the teat.�
Although gone now, a lead weight at the end of each wire had hung down
by my ribs and pulled my nipples to my chest.�
As he later fucked me while I wore this jewelry for him, every time he
moved on my belly and chest, it had felt like each nipple was almost ripped
away and each breast sawed off.� 

&nbsp;

I writhed and shook, tried
to sit up and failed.� My nipples felt
like they were on fire, then he slapped my face one more time.� I lay stretched out, my breasts in agony,
hurting everywhere, muscles taut as I tried to resist, yet somehow feeling
strangely warm as a throbbing began in my pussy and spread outward.� Suddenly he was violating me in the most
intimate of ways.� I lay unbelieving,
legs forcibly spread wide, watching him as his head descended between my
thighs.� I could hear him sniffing my
sex, then I screamed into my gag for him to stop what he was doing.� But he wouldn't.� I watched horrified as Master Durien spread
my labia with his fingers before he began licking them.� His tongue seemed to be on fire as it slipped
deeply into my wetness and then began to lick my outer lips.� At the same time, his hands caressed and
stroked my stocking clad thighs.� My
juices began to flow even more and I could feel my inner lips began to unfold
as they filled with passionate blood....soon I lay completely exposed, pussy
dripping wet and gaping wide, a shiny wet pink in color.� 

&nbsp;

I lay on the bed,
dazed.� My hands writhed and my fingers
curled and straightened helplessly.� I
had been so embarrassed when he sniffed at my sex...but for some obscure
reason, in some deep, dark part of my mind, it turned me on to have a man
sniffing me like this and obviously enjoying my aroused feminine odors.� He somehow knew before me that I would soon
be ready for his cock.� 

&nbsp;

�The Little Princess LIKES
a man licking between her legs, doesn't she?��
My eyes flew open.� I had gotten
so hot and tingly between my legs from his tonguing that my eyes had closed in
pleasure as the tip of his tongue licked my inner lips and probed my vagina
again and again.� By now, my senses were
almost singing in a magical intensity; I'd felt every bump on his tongue, every
twist of the muscle as he sucked and lapped my juices.� Then I felt electricity again as the tip of
his tongue flicked lightly over my stiffened clit.� Again and again he licked my pussy, then my
clit.

&nbsp;

But it could never be
enough for him.� My breasts felt like
they would explode, but he reached up and began to roughly maul them.� He flicked the heavy metal clamps, dug the
sharp metal teeth deeper into my flesh, and turned my breasts into twin pools
of fire, a fire that made my loins ache and boil.� But he never stopped trying to drink my
juices and suck my engorged clit.� When
Durien squeezed my bulging breasts and pulled on my nipple clamps a final time,
it felt like they were intimately connected to my groin.� I could feel my pussy getting even wetter in
response to his obvious ownership of my body, my clit getting larger and harder
in his questing mouth. 

&nbsp;

God, no.� Please no, Lord, I begged silently, I can't
stop him, but please don't let my body betray me, don't make me enjoy it
too.� God, anything but that.� But the man upstairs had stopped listening to
my prayers for the last couple of months.�
Within seconds, I was leaking huge amounts of love juice and my hips
writhed under Durien's assault.� My juice
covered the insides of my thighs and made a damp spot under my hips on the
bed.� My head was snapping back and forth
in denial, yet the wet smacking and sucking sounds he made while eating me were
incredibly erotic as they echoed in the empty room.� For ten minutes he sucked on my clit, my
outer and inner labia, lapped my juices and probed me with his tongue while
occasionally reaching up to flick the painful metal devices still clamped to my
breasts.� The sensations finally became
so pleasantly painful in the end that I came despite my best efforts to prevent
it.� Even as I groaned and writhed in
pleasure for his pleasure, I was still humiliated at so easily reinforcing his
obviously low opinion of women. 

&nbsp;

He never stopped working on
me and I came down quickly from my lover's endorphin high.� My labia
were soon bruised and sore, and my clitoris felt like it was on fire, having
first been exquisitely excited by his mouth and tongue before being pulled and
crushed between his fingers and thumb.� A
long rubber butt plug with multiple anal balls had by now been hidden deeply in
my rectum, the last ball measuring almost two inches in diameter.� This last had hurt terribly as he forced them
in.� But once in, the thing was locked
inside me; the muscles of my anal ring had traitorously gripped the rod between
the last ball he'd inserted and the flat base of the probe.� No matter how I'd initially strained to expel
it after my anal muscles had betrayed me, nothing worked.� I realized wouldn�t be free of this thing
until he himself forcibly removed it.�
After its insertion, he then reached between my legs and turned
something on; the balls had begun to slowly rotate on the twelve inches of
battery powered rubber coated rod that now writhed inside me.� 

&nbsp;

Tied
immobile at first and unable to protect myself, I could not prevent him from
achieving his many other pleasures; a circle of red welts, hickey�s and bite
marks now encircled my shaved vagina, beginning on the insides of my thighs
just above my stockings and going up around the lower part of my belly.� In addition, I could feel the burn of his
other bites on my labia, buttocks, back and neck.� Apparently, he did this to his slave Angie a
lot.� After he had finished giving me
nips over much of my body, he finally began to free me from my bonds and his
toys, one slow piece at a time.

&nbsp;

The worst
part; the part that affected me most in the end was the way that I found myself
reacting to the sadistic bastard.� I'd
fought him as long as I could, but he never stopped.� He just kept coming at me without a break,
and soon, far too soon, the clamps and the pincers and the wires and the probe
and the bites had finally begun to have the effect for which he�d been
searching.� Even though still muffled by
my gag at first, the sounds I made for him then were very different from those
that came before.� I'd finally begun
screaming deep in my throat for him and not
at him; it was clear to any
that might have heard that I had screamed from an excess of pleasure, not
pain.� 

&nbsp;

With perfect
clarity and a terrible sinking felling, I realized the gravity of what had
happened to me.� I was disgraced by
having performed for Dom Durien as he'd fully expected and despite what I
wanted, and I was furious that I had been given to this man in the first
place.� I lost my soul because I didn�t
realize that what I hid from him inside was by its very nature both hard and brittle;
and as he continued to work on my body, each act seemed to fracture just a
little bit more of the protective surface that I'd erected to save myself.� 

&nbsp;

Soon it was
over and I knew that my body and my soul belonged to Durien for the night.� My new Dom forced me to experience this
incredible plane of�of�there was no other words to describe it but �animal
wantonness,� by his sheer brute vigor alone.�
For me, all higher brain function was gone now, and my body was simply
and stupidly responding by itself to the massive sensorial delight he gave
me.� Even though not yet physically
fucked by him, he had already fucked my mind a thousand times.� I achieved true physical liberation,
experiencing orgasm after orgasm and involuntarily attaining continually higher
levels of pure ecstasy, all without feeling him inside me.� This had amused him and mortified the
increasingly smaller part of me that still remained rational.

&nbsp;

He looked
down at me after the first hour and as he looked in my eyes, I saw a vicious
guarded expression that told me I was somehow to him a threat, an enemy to be
conquered but not respected.� I had never
met him before tonight, I had no weapons by which to resist him and was
completely at his mercy; yet this man with the black eyes full of dark fire
totally enjoyed doing the awful things which now caused me so much pain.� 

&nbsp;

He had
already taken from me everything he could ever have wanted without even
entering me.� But he still wanted
more.� As my second hour began with him,
I prayed to a God I had not believed in for years that perhaps he had finished
with me for the night.� But to my shock,
he left the nipple clamps on as he now began to softly release my bound
breasts.� As I softly groaned in
anticipation of the coming release, I now did my best to mentally prepare for
the agony that I knew was yet to come; both from what had been removed as well
as what was left behind.� Next he slowly
removed my gag; afterwards putting his hand over my mouth and slowly waving his
index finger back and forth in front of my eyes, clearly telling me that I
would make any sound at my own risk.

&nbsp;

Master Christian had �'bagged' my tits once before and I knew
exactly what to expect when they were eventually freed.� Dom Durien slowly released the band that
constricted my left breast, carefully removing it to prevent my skin from being
further cut by the teeth on the inside of the metal strip.� He calmly waited for a minute as I bit my
lip; I fought to retain my pride as the blood began to flow again back inside
my still bulging breast.� Soon the sense
of �full and engorged, yet numb� was replaced first by an intense
prickly/tingling feeling.� This was in
turn quickly followed by the fiercely burning rush of returning blood.� 

&nbsp;

My breast ached and it throbbed as needles of pain shot deeper
than the wall of my chest; but it was now apparent to me that Durien somehow
fancied himself as a conductor, an artiste of pain---and I was his
symphony.� He�d removed the gag first
because he wanted to fully appreciate my attempts to stifle the moans of pain
that emanated from so deep within my bruised body.� After what seemed an eternity, he continued
on to release my other breast; soon both felt like they had been dipped in
pools of burning gasoline.

&nbsp;

My head
whipping back and forth as I tried to find a way to handle the pain.� I felt like I watched as if from a distance
as with deft fingers, he now released the bonds from my wrists.� Even freed, my hands still remained clenched
and frozen, unmoving on the mattress by my head.� And as I writhed in agony, his touch upon my
body again was like a feather, but this time I felt chills at the contact.� Somehow, I managed to keep it all inside me,
with no sounds making it past my clenched jaws and the pillow.� This, even though I felt an almost physical
pressure building in my chest that threatened to make me burst.� I managed to contain it all somehow.� The pain continued to well up inside me for
at least ten minutes before it began to slowly recede.� After awhile, my lungs began to work and I
could breathe a little again.

&nbsp;

He had remained
clothed early on while he had worked on me, but this had not hidden the huge
bulge in his pants.� He watched me in
silence and as I finally began to breathe more easily, he had slowly stood next
to me as he suddenly began to undress, stripping from the top down.� I had looked at his groin before; but my
first view of him naked was like being hit with a mallet on the side of the
head---it was like a physical blow that was combined with the utter fascination
of every forthcoming forbidden pleasure I could ever imagine.� I could see his manhood, hanging long and low
between his legs.� Not yet fully
engorged, his penis to me still looked like a small baseball bat, but it continued
to grow in size before my eyes.� I tried
to look away, but was frozen for an instant of time, like the cobra looking at
a mongoose.� I was shocked as I felt
almost a yearning to take him in my mouth, but somehow closed my eyes against
his terrible siren call.� But nothing I
could have done would have actually saved me.

&nbsp;

The spreader
bar had finally been removed from my ankles.�
Now Dom Durien took me for the first time that night---he climbed on my
belly and began fucking me with no more regard than if I were an inflatable
woman.� He told me that to him I was like
a coke whore, ready to do anything for the Master that would give me my next
sexual fix.� 

&nbsp;

And while I
denied this in my mind and fought him in every way I had left, to my abject
humiliation and irregardless of the pain remaining in my nipples, I creamed
almost immediately again.� I had always
before felt like I had a bottomless pit between my legs that no man could ever
truly fill, but he filled me that night.�
And now it was his hand over my mouth that kept the screams in.� I have no idea if it was just my imagination
or actually him, but his rigid flesh at first felt cold; so very cold as he
buried it in me.� Even as it totally
filled me, its chill stole upon my belly and made me want to shiver.� At the same time, it burned; nothing on earth
had ever burned like this rigid, iron-hard thing that pierced me so
deeply.� And once he was inside, his ice
began to fill me up and after awhile, I didn�t have any strength left.� His manhood had stolen it all.

&nbsp;

He had
looted my heat, but as he continued pumping me, it finally began to
return.� Then began the most incredible
series of orgasms I could ever have dreamed, let alone experienced.� Dom Durien�s cock was massive and as he drove
it into me, I forced myself to not cry out in surprise and pain.� I was sopping wet, so lubrication was not a
problem.� But the thing was huge; it had
me bulged inside beyond belief and any previous experience.� I almost fainted when I felt how deeply this
thing probed me.� And at the same time
that he had forced himself inside me, it already felt like my abdomen had been
filled by the immense probe that still consumed my rectum.� 

&nbsp;

There wasn�t
room for both, there COULDN�T physically be enough room for both---but there
was.� His cock seemed to force its way
far too deeply into me, creating space for itself by parting the flesh inside
me that had never been meant for this purpose.�
I moaned and gasped and cried out in pain as he pierced me time after
time.� Filled beyond belief, extended
beyond what flesh could bear, my mind had seemed like a jigsaw, throwing pieces
all over the room.� Part of me thought, thank God, no one else can see him doing this, while
another part continued to reassure, Don�t worry, it�s just a
dream.� It�s not real, it can�t be
real.� My Master wouldn�t allow this.

&nbsp;

I remembered
gritting my teeth as the monstrous thing began sliding hugely in and out again,
with each slick thrust nudging the bulb of my cervix.� I had felt paralyzed before but now,
suddenly, finally, I could move my hands.�
For the first time tonight, he bottomed out inside me as banged against
my cervix.� I couldn't think or breathe
for a second because of the pain.� Then,
I couldn�t help myself; even as I screamed at the pain he caused me; I grabbed
the cheeks of his ass and dragged him further onto my sweat-slick abdomen and
chest and ultimately deeper into my over-filled vagina.� 

&nbsp;

Master
Christian had taken me to new heights and new lows; he was like a psychic
vampire in that he had wracked me with pain and siphoned off my anguish to make
his own.� But I always somehow had been
able to make myself believe that this was what I deserved; that these were my
punishments for the wrongs committed in what now appeared as an earlier
life.� In this, I had always done my best
to hide my true nature from myself, but tonight I�d been forced to face my most
unprotected inner-self; without dissembling and without lies.� Dom Durien had taken me past threshold after
previously unexplored threshold, to places in my mind that I had never been.� 

&nbsp;

He forced me
to abandon everything that I felt made me ME, and once the pain had
crescendoed, it had merged with my desire for his sex and had become so
exquisite a sensation that I never wanted it to stop.� These last cries had not been forced from my
throat; I had howled my craving for more, willingly giving voice over and over
again.� And at the end, even as I feared
and hated this man, I also knew in my heart that I would willingly become his
terminal pain slut if ever given the chance, and that shameful knowledge was
forever seared into my brain---it would never leave me.� 

&nbsp;

But at the
same time, I didn�t want that---I knew that I would never mean anything to this
man except for being another one of his pain toys; and that the tiny shredded
piece of pride that still remained inside me couldn�t allow this---this
subconscious realization was what forced the small remaining part of me that
was still ME to fight giving to him the final small part that remained free.

&nbsp;

In the end,
I understood that his goal was to make me offer him my ultimate orgasm, to give
him the single final jewel that still remained in my possession....and I
finally did.� He rode me hard to this
ultimate destination.� Worse for me, once
he had me there, he didn�t stop.� The
ride back from that place was just as fast and just as hard.� I couldn�t breathe now, the air was like a
hot bath to my lungs.� I felt enveloped,
bereft.� Every minute of he rode me took me
farther away from my Master, from the White Room, from my sanity.� Ahead of me there could be nothing of
substance, for my future under Durien was as thin and vague as a vapor.

&nbsp;

And Master
Christian?� He�d betrayed me.� I still didn�t know exactly why I let any man
do these things to me.� At least I told
myself that I didn�t.� But my Master was
MY Master---our relationship had become fulfilling at last and I felt that he
got as much out of it as I.� But Dom
Durien was the devil and as good as he was at what he did to a woman, he must
surely have cloven hooves for feet.� He�d
played my body like an evil classical composer might play his greatest work;
eyes closed yet body always moving in a way that allowed the achievement of
always greater levels of enthusiasm and expertise.� Moving and playing and creating until it was
literally intolerable for me, and my body that was so tightly bound now only in
the mind shuddered uncontrollably at his lightest touch.� 

&nbsp;

And yet at
the same time, he required me to continually acknowledge the ever more
wonderful levels of pleasure I explored with him that night.� The pain and the pleasure that night were
tied inextricably together; neither could exist without the other.� Every orgasm he forced from me felt like it
made the earth shake; the feelings from each seemed as delicate as a spider�s
web, yet at the same time each vibrated me to my very soul.� Everything he did seemed to last a personal
lifetime.� If allowed to be taken to its
natural conclusion, I was sure that the beautiful violence that he offered me
that night would have eventually stopped my heart; the sensations and emotions
he aroused were so strong, they would have been the end of me.� 

&nbsp;

And at the
end of that first fuck, the sweet sensation of yet another massive vaginal
penetration only enhanced my bliss.� My
blood had flowed thick and hot in my veins, and it felt like he was taking my
very essence as he took my body.� He was
pushing me out of my skin to take over my soul---I knew that they both couldn�t
be in the same space; I knew that each orgasm forced me to yield just a little more
to him each time; and this I did, multiple times.� And as he continued to thrust, I learned to
lean into him as best I could.� My breath
came fast even though the skin of my chest felt as if it had been aflame.� At the end, his breath hissed as he inhaled
between clenched teeth; he somehow sank into me even deeper now and bit my neck
hard to taste even more of my flesh---and I offered it willingly.

&nbsp;

Finally, he
gave me one last massive skewering and groaned as he did.� His mouth nipping my neck, he whispered into
my right ear, �Now you take the first one.��
I wasn�t sure what he meant by
this, when suddenly I think I blanked out for one intense second as he began to
fountain into me for the first time that evening; an immense amount of semen as
hot as burning lava spurted into the very end of my vagina, thickly coating
every available crevice that wasn�t already filled by his erection.� When I began to be able to think again, I
found that my nylon clad legs were wrapped around his waist and I was squeezing
him as hard as I could.� Slowly, I unlocked
my ankles from around his back at the same time that I forced my fingers from
the claw-like positions they had seemingly assumed of their own accord as they
raked his back of six-inch long strips of skin.

&nbsp;

It seemed to
take forever because when he finished cumming, I was drenched in sweat and
gasping for air.� My whole body ached and
tingled; a shudder ran through me as my breasts throbbed again and again with
the beat of my heart.� But I didn�t care,
for my whole body seemed to be concentrated inside my groin right now, totally
encompassing his immense rod of iron-hard flesh; he touched me softly as
finally withdrew and my every muscle spasmed at his touch, whether it was a
part upon which he had spent time or not.�
I closed my eyes for I knew that I could not take any more from this
man; if I did, it would surely be the end of me.� 

&nbsp;

I heard him
breathing heavily as he rose to his knees between my thighs and I finally
looked at him again.� The circumcised
head of his penis glistened with my wetness in the light, and even though it
was still as thick as my wrist, I could see it finally begin to droop a little
as it started to lose its horrible length.�


&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

My breasts
and hips ached from his attentions and I was already exhausted, but after about
ten minutes of lying quietly next to me, Master Durien stood up and told me to
turn so that my head was off the edge of the bed.� This was a new and uncomfortable position,
but I moved as quickly as I could---which was not fast---as I still had that
terrible thing moving inside my rectum and it hurt to move my legs.� He told me to cross my legs and grab my
ankles; then he softly assured me that if I were to let go, he would give me a
worse beating than Master Christian had ever thought of doing.� This I am now convinced was untrue; but how
could I know that at the time?� 

&nbsp;

As with any
of my status, all I could do was obey.�
Grunting in discomfort, I strained to spread my knees wide in order to
get my feet positioned under my butt as he desired.� But I finally succeeded and so I lay on my
back for Master Durien with my ankles crossed, my right hand grasping my left
ankle and my left hand holding my right.�
As I was moving, I saw him drop to one knee by the edge of the bed.

&nbsp;

I was
positioned so that my head was unsupported and off the bed.� Master Durien suddenly grabbed a handful of
hair on the back of my head with his left hand and pulled down hard.� He yanked my head backwards towards the floor
so fast that it hurt my neck.� At the
same time, his right had grabbed my chin and pulled it hard towards my
chest.� The pain in my scalp and his
quick moves had left my mouth gaping open in surprise.� 

&nbsp;

Unexpectedly,
he now began feeding his stiffening cock into my mouth.� Suddenly, within just a few seconds, he was
erect and huge again.� In this, he seemed
to have an amazing ability to force an erection anytime he desired.� I felt that Dom Durien was far too big to go
into my mouth like this, but he never stopped pushing.� To my mortification, I later realized that I
was so shocked by what he was doing that I never once became angry or even
thought of disobeying him, but rather felt only humiliation as he used me like
a human garbage can.� At first I could
taste only my pussy in my mouth as my dried fluids on his cock activated the
taste buds on my tongue, but soon the peculiar taste that belonged only his
massive meat overwhelmed everything else.

&nbsp;

Suddenly, I
could feel my jaws being forced painfully apart to accommodate his massive bulk
and at least half of his huge, iron hard penis was driven into my mouth and
down my throat.� The tip of his cock
seemed to smash against my tonsils and I immediately gagged; I felt almost
compelled to vomit, but fought it as best I could.� His left hand kept pulling on my hair, but
he'd finally let go of my chin with his other hand.� His right hand now either stroked my throat
or fed more meat into my mouth; as he did this, he whispered words to me so
softly that I couldn�t understand him.� I
could feel my neck straining and the muscles in my neck bulging, standing out
like cords.� I was choking and could make
only muffled gagging sounds, �Unghhh, AAHHUMHNGGG!�� I knew that my eyes were unfocused as I
looked upwards, sometimes at his balls as they slapped me between the eyes and
sometimes into the sparkling black eyes that blazed down at me; even then I
knew that no matter what he did to me, I dared not use my teeth.� 

&nbsp;

I was going
to die here, I couldn't breathe; he filled my mouth and my throat and my lungs,
taking for his any space which might hide the air I had to have.� My hands kept twitching, wanting to push his
hips away, but as I began to make that first move, a sudden movement of his
drew my eyes.� He was looking down at me
and slowly shaking his head no, while his right hand was raised to slap
me---hard.

&nbsp;

Suddenly
afraid, I somehow locked my fingers to my high heels.� Abruptly, he stopped feeding me his cock and
began to drive with his hips, forcing his shaft even deeper into my
throat---there was no way I could take a normal breath with him filling me, let
alone when he mouth-fucked me like this.�
He was almost fully sheathed inside my throat now and my gagging sounds
filled the room, but he didn�t care.� I lay
flat on my back on the bed and obeyed his every command; even as he choked me,
I�m sure he thought me his cooperative little slave-whore.� To his great gratification and my eternal
shame, I totally accepted it as his right to do what he did to me.� I quickly learned that the only way I could
breathe was through my nose---and even then, only when he pulled out a
little.� But to my misery and
desperation, he did this only in order to begin a new thrust into me each
time.� 

&nbsp;

I
desperately timed my breathing with the lunge of his hips; his balls were
banging rhythmically onto my forehead or hitting me directly between the
eyes.� He straddled my face, forcing my
nose up near his anus.� He continued his
powerful drives into my mouth, and after a few seconds of this, I felt even
more humiliation when my eyes began watering and tears ran down my face.� At the same time, I could feel saliva pooling
in my mouth; it lubricated him and eventually, when I had salivated enough, it
exploded out of the sides of my mouth with each thrust of his hips.� I drooled onto my face and eventually it
joined the tears around my ears and in my hair.�


&nbsp;

My vision
was blurred because of my tears, but I could tell that Master Durien was
hairier than my Master between his legs.�
In addition, his sack was so close that it was hard for my eyes to stay
focused as swayed in front of me, but I could tell that it was a darker brown
than the rest of his skin.� It was veined
and while most men's were normally wrinkled in texture, right now any excess
skin was taken up by his huge erection.�
Worse, I could see the cheeks of his butt flexing just above my eyes
each time he pulled out of my mouth and prepared for the next drive of his
hips---he just kept on, never seeming to tire or approach satisfaction with
me.� 

&nbsp;

When enough
saliva had accumulated in my mouth, the sound changed.� In addition to the gagging sound that I
couldn�t help but make with each of his thrusts, now each time he drove into
me, there was a wet two-part noise, �Ga-glick, ga-glick.�� Lubricated by copious saliva, the first sound
came as he drove his huge cock into my mouth and easily stretched my jaws and
throat beyond belief.� The second sound
came as he finished the penetration and drove out what little air remained in
my lungs.� The awful sound �Ga-glick,�
was tied together like a horse and carriage, one never heard or seen without
the other.� �Ga-glick, ga-glick,
ga-glick,� resonated around the White Room and echoed in my ears.� Moist and humiliating, the terrible sound
forced from my throat sliced to my feminine core, piercing what little foolish
pride I had left as a woman even as he used his huge erection as a weapon in
his attempts to pierce my lungs.� 

&nbsp;

Once he
slipped out of my mouth as he pulled back for another thrust and for the first
time I was able to swallow the fouled saliva that filled my mouth.� Only then could I talk.� �Please.�
No more,� I panted as I begged him.�
�I�.� my voice died in a muffled gurgle as he plugged my nose with his
left hand and used it to pull my head back down again, while his right grabbed
my chin and forced my mouth open wide.�
Suddenly, he filled me again and my only chance to beg for his mercy was
gone.� 

&nbsp;

Now he
changed his aim and began thrusting his meat into the sides of my mouth,
grotesquely stretching my cheeks.� With
these moves, he told me I was receiving his �facial�.

&nbsp;

God, I was
so afraid of this man, and I hated him even more!� But I had to be honest too; there was a
perverse realization---what I hated most was the sudden recognition that I had
never, not once, attempted to defend myself from what he did. �I knew this meant my subjugation by the Dom�s
must be complete---I WAS their whore now.�
And to put the last touches on my self-loathing, I knew that I would
have continued to accept anything else he wanted to do to me......and so it
continued.

&nbsp;

Now he went
back to driving into my throat again.�
Sometimes he lightly slapped my face, laughing with each blow as I
remained pinned by his cock.� His right
hand continually stroked my neck where I was sure he could see it bulge each
time he drove into my throat. �Several
more times he plugged my nostrils, stopping me from getting what little air
that could fit around the erection that he kept buried in my throat.� He would toy with me for what seemed an
eternity until I became frantic to breathe again.� But in reality, he could have only done this
for what must have been thirty or so seconds before he freed me and began
stroking my throat again.� Each of these
times, even as I remained trapped and restrained by his cock, I was at the end
nonetheless weakly tossing my head back and forth, trying to get a little
air.� But like the good, well-trained
little whore that I knew I'd become, I never let go of my ankles.� He watched the lizard-brain part of me weakly
struggle for survival, even as the conscious part submitted to his vile acts;
amused by it all, he threw his head back in laughter.� 

&nbsp;

Soon, he
began to cum down my throat.� It rippled
in waves down the inside of my throat and into my stomach like liquid
silver.� I had never been with a man who produced so much semen.� Durien was the most prolific sperm machine
that I'd ever experienced.� Even
as I tasted the salt of his semen on the extreme back of my tongue, I hated
myself as I knew to my eternal shame that if he wanted to fuck me again, I'd
cooperate in every way possible.�
God!� I knew I must have been
mentally ill to just quietly accept his abuse like that.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

He worked on me some more and then to celebrate his total victory over me, Durien decided to orally
rape me once more, using his huge cock to again�
purposefully block my windpipe and slowly strangle me.� I watched his ugly length of muscle grew
longer and fatter as he gazed down on me, and realized it was an ideal tool for
slowly strangling any woman that fell into his hands.� I didn't have to maintain that horrible
position this time, but it didn't matter for I was barely able to breathe and
was certainly no match for his strength.�


&nbsp;

Satisfied that his cock was ready for
the task, he pried my jaws wide open and then shifted his position so that the
angle at which his cock entered my mouth pointed directly down my gullet.� His first thrust plugged my windpipe
completely, but I barely made an attempt to struggle, already having mentally
submitted to whatever he intended.�
Durien looked down and my face, then leaned forward into me, slipping
his rigid meat even further down my throat.�
He paused to enjoy the sensations of my throat convulsing around his
cock.� I knew my face had finally turned
red and that my eyes must have been bulging from their sockets as he suffocated
me.� Finally, he realized I actually was
choking and he pulled back for just a second so that I could breathe.

&nbsp;

But he quickly resumed torturing me,
shoving his engine of destruction down my throat, completely cutting off my air
supply again and again and again.� A red
haze seemed to form in front of me after awhile and I knew my face slowly
turned red again, then my skin grew paler as my lungs struggled for
non-existent oxygen.� My lips were
turning blue and then a darker purplish color, but he didn't care.� My eyes were wide open, but I saw nothing for
I hadn't breathed in about a minute and a half.�
Durien snorted in amusement, then decided to give me another thirty
seconds of meat.� He finally pulled his
cock from my savaged throat with a loud, wet popping sound, then listened to me
wheeze and cough as air began to pass into my lungs through my bruised and
convulsing throat.

&nbsp;

I think Durien felt himself getting
ready to ejaculate and he wanted to make sure that every drop was emptied into
me as I gasped for air.� He popped the
head of his huge cock back into my bruised throat and jammed it deep one last
time.� From the look on his face, he was
thoroughly enjoying how much pain he was causing me.� He rotated his hips and waggled his erection
in my throat from one side to to the other to stretch my esophagus, then Durien
began to throat-fuck me hard, desperately driving his cock deeper and deeper
with each power-thrust.� It didn't take
long for his nutsack to tighten and his testicles to churn and erupt, sending
another salvo of hot, molasses thick cum into my throat and ultimately into my stomach.� By
the time he was finished, I was almost unconscious again, but he didn't care. 

&nbsp;

Four hours
after it had first started, my Master walked into the White Room holding
Angie�s hand.� I blearily looked over to
see that Dom Durien�s slave had a smile on her face; both of them looked
exhausted and physically sated.� The
girls� body was beautiful in its perfection; any marks on her back and buttocks
were few and old and fading.......worst of all, there were no new ones.� 

&nbsp;

This was as
it should have been with ME, not Angie.�
My Master had not hurt me in Durien�s way since our first couple of
weeks.� While still maintaining his
dominance over me in every way, our relationship had somehow deepened.� He had become in many ways so much more to
me; still taking responsibility for all of my life, but leading me to new and
continually more varied freedoms that I could never have experienced without
him.� 

&nbsp;

But now,
without feeling the need for my permission, he had given me to another man.

&nbsp;

Exhausted
after having spent the night with me, Dom Durien now sat on the edge of the
bed.� He looked almost delusional in his
feelings of grandeur as he exercised his ability to wreak havoc on my
body.� His choices had been positively
primal in their intensity.� A relaxed
look now showed upon his face---he was mostly satiated by what he had done to me.� At this point, even though my gag had finally
been removed for good and my wrists and ankles were now unbound, I was forced
to keep moving my knees back and forth to just help lessen the ache between
them.� 

&nbsp;

A final time
Durien misread me as with a quick move, he mounted my spread thighs for a last
visit---I heard myself make a soft unintentional �ungh� sound as he brutally
entered me again just after my Master walked in.� I was sure that Durien was doing this in
front of Master Christian to show his dominance; I was even more embarrassed as
I found myself unconsciously spreading my knees even more to help ease the pain
of my bruised vagina as it was filled one last time.� 

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

The voyeurs
Christian and Angie watched now as Durien amused himself with me one last
time.� Even though in pain, I couldn�t
help myself as I began to give soft moans of obvious encouragement at
everything that he did.� Performing in
front of the two for Durien�s pleasure humiliated me beyond belief, but I could
not stop myself from giving him everything that he wanted.� He didn�t even seem to enjoy the physical
sensations of possessing me one last time, but rather he seemed to revel in my
abject mortification.� 

&nbsp;

Finally, he
grabbed my jaw with his hands and forced me to look at him as he began to cum
one last time.� He had little fluid left
in him by now, but his every inch still possessed me; I could feel my eyes
flicker as each rhythmic pulse of the hot muscle now buried so deeply in my
belly as it dispensed the last drops of his scalding love one last time.� Soon, he had achieved total release and injected
one final puddle of semen deep inside me.�
Our legs were intertwined for a moment, then he rolled off of my sweaty
abdomen and lay beside me.� I tried to
move, but realized how much it hurt to move my legs; my pelvis seemed locked,
frozen in place by the long rod that still filled my rectum.

&nbsp;

As my Master
could finally see my body fully, I could read an initial shock in his face as
he recognized how Durien had spent much of the evening, but he quickly covered
this up.� My face flushed deep red with
embarrassment and shame as I saw Durien�s slave Angie glance at my nipples with
a tiny smile.� Both were a bright, shiny
red now and ached terribly.� A thin
darker red line interrupted by many equidistant spaced dots surrounded the base
of each of my breasts.� Earlier, both had
been gathered and bunched like dark purple bags resting on my chest---this was
something which Master Christian had done to me once---thank God, that once was
enough for him.�� 

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

It was early
in the morning now and the satanic Maestro was at the end of his last
performance.� Durien rose from my sweaty
belly, our audience of two still silent.�
Moving quickly and still breathing hard, he sat heavily upon my abdomen
and chest, pinning my arms by my sides with the insides of his knees; then he
waited.� In a few moments, I opened my
eyes.� I blinked at the ceiling, not yet
fully aware of his unexpected weight.�
Then I looked at him.� He reached
down with his left hand and wrapped it around my neck, pushing my head back and
pinning it on the bed.� My throat muscles
were so tight that I felt my tongue almost burst.� Looking directly into my eyes, he slapped me
lightly three times with his right hand; forehand, backhand, forehand.� 

&nbsp;

My face
snapped back and forth with his blows; I could feel my cheeks and ears burning
with his contempt and I struggled to free my arms.� But I was pinned and helpless.� For the first time in hours, a rational
thought floated to the surface of my mind; thank God I wasn't wearing my nose
ring.

&nbsp;

He said in a
soft, yet commanding tone, �Say, �Thank you�, you little whore.� Say, �Master, thank you for fucking me.�
�� 

&nbsp;

I shook my
head as best I could.� Where was Master
Christian?� Who would protect me from
this monster?� I finally realized the
answer was.....no one, as Dom Durien reacted instantly with another quick slap
and repeated his command, �You little slut, say, �Thank you for fucking me,
Master Durien.��� 

&nbsp;

I would
rather have died than submit to this sex monster, but I also knew that I had
reached the bottom in my life---I had no other choice.� Hesitantly, still not believing that I was
obeying him, I heard my voice answer without conscious thought.� My face scarlet with shame and embarrassment,
barely above a whisper, I said, �Thank you, Master Durien.� Thank you for fucking me tonight.�� 

&nbsp;

I felt my
face go even hotter as I finished, but I knew I dare not venture any kind of
additional retort to the contempt I'd heard in his voice.� Besides, said the stubborn inner whisper of
which I wished I could rid myself, much of what he�d forced me to say was true.

&nbsp;

He nodded
and climbed off of me, then sat on the edge of the bed.� This allowed me the freedom to move again; I
tried to sit up, but he pushed me back flat onto the mattress.� I felt his eyes blaze like they had when he'd
first talked to me tonight, eons ago in the restaurant.� �You liked it, right?� he�d asked as he
spread my knees wide to remove the still active anal rod.

&nbsp;

Cheeks
burning, I tried to maintain the tiniest facade of dignity that he had left me.
��Please,� I panted.� �Master Durien, I---�

&nbsp;

He slapped
the flank of my left buttock as hard as he could; the sound like wet leather
slapping skin.� �Right?� he demanded.

&nbsp;

�Yes.� Yes,� I told him.� Full of conflicting emotions, the print of
his slap still buzzed on my rump as I fought both my total embarrassment and
the forbidden feelings that drifted up.�
I hated him and all men like him---they were users, and I hated
everything they represented.� But part of
me; too much of me did like this---a lot.�


&nbsp;

He fumbled
for a second between my legs.� I cried
out first in surprise, then groaned deeply in my throat for thirty seconds as
he slowly pulled the huge rod almost all the way from inside my rear end; but
as my muscles expanded to their maximum to accept this monstrous thing on its
reverse journey, he stopped and rocked it in and out, in and out a couple of
times.� As my anus released the first of
the huge anal balls, I moaned in quick relief.�
But he went on and I was still in a lot of discomfort as he slowly
continued pulling and withdrawing the remaining four balls, oohhh ssooo slowly
rocking them in and out, one ball at a time.�
I heard noises in the room, long groooannnn, then quick grunt and soft
moan.� Groooannn, then grunt and
moan.� My groan turned into a wail as he
finally popped the massive thing out.�
And it took a minute to realize that it was me making each noise.� 

&nbsp;

�You see,
you whore-slave, you liked it.� You�ve
been perfectly broken in and you enjoyed it.�
You�re part of us now---and this is part of you that will never go
away.�� 

&nbsp;

Everything
was out of my rectum now.� But even as my
anus ached and throbbed, I remembered the chair.� Like then, when my rectum had been emptied
after Master Christian�s first attentions, I now somehow felt hollow, like a
necessary part of my body was missing.� A
cavity inside me had in some strange way now been left vacant and unfilled,
where before it had overflowed, giving me a weird kind of completeness.� But I could never force myself to look at his
toy, for the only thing that I had been able to see as I looked at the ceiling
was my own disgrace.� My body had felt
heavy as lead, like it was bolted to the bed as he'd finished with me.� Now I turned my face to face the wall, I
didn�t want him to see my tears.� 

&nbsp;

He stood at
the side of my bed and looked down at me.�
�Are you ready to be set free?�

&nbsp;

Eyes now
stinging with unshed tears, I looked back at him.� �Of course, yes,� I whispered.� But of him is what I meant.� And I hadn�t meant to whisper.� I�d meant to sound firm and not intimidated
by his force of will.� But it was as if
my spirit were no longer my own.� He
commanded the room as he commanded my body and inner world.� What I would feel if given to him, I sensed,
would always be under his control.� 

&nbsp;

And yet, the
thought of that and my earlier humiliation at his hands didn�t bother me
anymore.� It was crazy, but suddenly I
wanted to deliver myself to him totally.�
My Master had given me to this man for the night�..if that was the case,
then so be it.� As Dom Durien stood next
me and even as Master Christian remained in the room, I felt the urge to move
closer, to grip this new Dom and press my face against his belly, his crotch,
his thighs.� I craved to have his fingers
touch my hair and bring me closer.� With
all my heart I wanted to muster a scream of defiance at this Dom, but I knew
that if he dragged me to him again, it would be a moan of desire and need, not
a wail of despair that echoed around the room.

&nbsp;

Suddenly,
even as Durien reached down and gave me a final, contemptuous kiss, I felt my
body respond again to his obvious self-hatred.�
To my shock, I suddenly imagined myself locked with him in another
embrace, but this time in erotic combat, loving and hating and trying
desperately to join.� I quickly banned
the hideous images from my mind.� For the
sake of my soul, I hoped that my Master would never give me to this man again.

&nbsp;

As I looked
away from Durien, I saw that Angie watched us with an expressionless face as he
gave me the despicable and condescending, yet so revealing kiss.� Suddenly, this ice-cold madman put the heel
of his right hand against the left half of my mouth and with a quick move he
roughly pushed his palm from the corner of my lips to my ear, pushing my head
deeply into the mattress and smearing any remaining lipstick from my lips over
the side of my face.� It was a move of
total contempt and perfectly showed the overwhelming loathing he felt towards
me---as the stand-in for all women.�
Standing suddenly, Dom Durien departed, leaving only feminine wreckage
in the White Room.� Grabbing his slave
Angie�s arm as he walked by, he dragged her behind him as she teetered
awkwardly on her high heels.� She
disappeared after taking only a quick look at me over her shoulder.� My Master still looked at me without saying a
word.

&nbsp;

Nothing of
importance left to see in the White Room, his face seemed to say; I could feel
my world crumbling around me for the second time in the last six months as I
clasped my arms over my still throbbing chest.�
I realized I still wore my stockings and heels as I pulled my knees up
closer to my stomach to ease my aching hips.�
I turned my face to the wall as I heard HIM slowly come up beside my
bed.� After a moment, he said, �Look at
me.�� I ignored him and after a long pause,
he grabbed my left arm and repeated himself, �Look at me now, or you will be
hurting even more in the morning than you are now.�

&nbsp;

Arms still
over my chest, knees drawn up and locked together, I reluctantly rolled onto my
back and faced Christian, my Master.� He
did not hesitate to look into my eyes as he said, �This, I think�..perhaps went
too far.� But you deserved it�..much of
it.� It�s up to you to decide what you
deserved.� Think about it.� For the last couple of weeks, you've begun
acting like our relationship is that of equals.�
It�s not.� And I told you that on
the first night that you came to me, but as usual, you never listen and never
take the easy way.� You needed a lesson
tonight in humility........and he was willing.�

&nbsp;

He paused
for a second and it seemed difficult for him to continue.� �I�m......sorry that you had to go through
this.� At the end he might have enjoyed
it too much---but never forget, you get exactly as much freedom as I give
you.� Nothing more, nothing less.� This whole thing is simple; if you finally
get that concept through your head, you won�t be entertaining that man
again.� But if you keep on thinking that
you have the same rights and privileges that you had before I fitted my collar
around your neck, I promise that you will perform for that man for as long as
he desires and there�s not a damn thing you can do about it.� Believe me---you don�t want to be doing
that.� Is there anything about this that
you don�t understand?�

&nbsp;

Hugging
myself even harder, my eyes teared up as I nodded my understanding.� Finally I turned back to face the wall
despite the fact that my Master was still standing by the side of my bed.� He reached out with a tentative hand and
touched my shoulder.� �Behave yourself,
woman,� he said softly.� �And I promise
that it won�t happen again.�� After
standing by my bed for another minute, he turned the light off in the room as
he left.� 

&nbsp;

Exhausted, I
sobbed softly in the dark for a couple of minutes.� Drained, I got up and sat on the edge of the
bed as I slowly took off my high heels and then the stockings and garter
belt.� After another minute in which I
sat motionless, I got up to use the toilet.�
I turned on the light and looked at myself as I walked by the mirror; I
couldn�t help but begin crying again.� I had
spent almost an hour at the beginning of the evening putting on my makeup and
ensuring that I looked my best.� Now my
eyes were red and bloodshot from crying; my throat had bruises and it hurt from
being choked by Durien for the last four hours.�
I had huge blue bags under my eyes and my mascara was smudged; it looked
like I had two huge black eyes.� But even
worse, my mascara had run with my tears as my head hung off the bed and had
made what were symmetrical thick dark lines on the sides of my face that ran
from the outside of my eyes to my ears.� 

&nbsp;

But to me,
the worst was from his contemptuous act at the end as he had smeared the makeup
on the left side of my face.� 

&nbsp;

Was there no
end to my humiliation?

&nbsp;

I continued
on to the toilet and sat down.� I began
weeping again when I realized that every time I moved, I released the strong
smell of Durien's sex from between my unwashed legs.� The brutally concentrated pheromones that
originated from my vagina had a primal honesty that screamed of detailed control
over another�s will.� I needed to shower,
but literally didn't have the strength.�
I carried his gift everywhere with me that night; a primordial pungency
that clearly cried out of a vicious preemption of freedom and cruel
obstruction; it was the reek of re-directed prehistoric urges released without
control upon an unwilling victim.

&nbsp;

When I was
finished, I stopped at the sink to wash my face of the cosmetics destroyed by
Master Durien.� Something seemed familiar
as I looked at my devastated reflection in the mirror.� Then I remembered; it had been when Master
was returning Anne Marie after her rape.�
I remembered the feelings of total isolation and helplessness, of
weakness and vulnerability that I'd felt after I'd used the same mirror to put
on makeup for this man that time too.� 

&nbsp;

I finally
crawled back into bed.� I was not going
to reconcile my feelings of betrayal and humiliation with Master Christian---or
myself---not tonight.� Tonight I would
allow them to tear me from tip to toe.� I
was not whole anyway.� I was not even two
halves.� I was shattered, not like
fabric; but rather like glass.� I could
not occupy my body, not tonight; it was too sharp, there were far too many
shards right now.� Not tonight or even
tomorrow, not until it felt softer.� My
heart had hardened, a round stony thing that lay heavily in my chest.� You weigh me down, I told it.� I wish I could live without you.

&nbsp;

I
yawned.� I was mentally and physically
and emotionally exhausted.� After a few
more tears, I was asleep in a surprisingly short time given the abuse and
broken promises of the evening.� I slept
restlessly all night, but if I dreamed, I didn�t remember it.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I walked in late the next
morning and stood by her bed as she slept.�
She snored softly and slept with her mouth open.� Finally, she sensed that someone was there
and she awoke with a start.� Ruined
makeup still marred her face.� The
slave�s beautiful blue eyes remained unfocused for a second, and then I could
see the memory of the night before suddenly flood onto her face.� Rasha continued looking into my face as she
slowly got up off of the bed and then she stood directly in front of me, still
draped in a thin blanket.� 

&nbsp;

Without warning, her right fist swung around and she screamed,
�You bastard,� as she hit me in the face.�
Totally unprepared for her reaction, I found myself flat on my back on
the floor.� I got up slowly.� Filled with rage, I somehow kept my face
still even though I could feel my jaw muscles bunch momentarily.� I resolutely walked toward the furious woman
that was still my property; she took one step back and then stood her ground,
her face unwavering in her fury.� Neither
of us seemed to breathe.� 

&nbsp;

�Was that for real?� I asked gently.� �Or was it just a game?�� I stepped forward again, recklessly invading
her personal space.� Her face bumped into
my chest.� The woman tried to brace
herself, but my size and strength thrust her back.

&nbsp;

With a cry of fury mixed with a look of total helplessness, she
tried to hit me again.� I easily blocked
her blow and slapped her face in return, knocking her down with my open hand
and all of my strength behind it.� �Now,�
I said to the dazed woman lying on the floor.�
�I think that you know what comes next.�

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I'd refused
to meet his eyes as I lay on the floor, but I had understood perfectly what was
coming next.� Soon I lay on my back on
the bed where he had thrown me.� He'd
slapped my face several times, then when he tired of that, he'd enjoyed fucking
me as a punishment; but he was finished for now.� I couldn�t move.� His bonds were punishingly tight and efforts
to flex my legs had failed, causing my thighs to cramp.� Bands of steel like bony fingers encircled my
wrists.� The side of my face hurt.� I opened my right eye and felt the
depressingly familiar release of tension as I recognized the White Room.� I opened my other eye.� My vision alternately blurred and
sharpened.� Finally my vision had cleared
enough that I could look around.� Nice
white ceiling.� I lifted my head to look
around.� Nothing had changed.� 

&nbsp;

I tried to
swallow and coughed as my dry throat tickled.�
My mouth felt lined with absorbent, my lips dry and rough.� I summoned what saliva I had left and ran my
tongue over my teeth.� I pulled at my
restraints again; my lower back tightened.�
I sagged back on the bed and tried to gather my scattered thoughts.

&nbsp;

I'd been
afraid this morning that I might lose my mind.�
Master was gone now, but I knew that he would be back.� I lay in my bed, my mind blissfully empty now
of everything but my own thoughts.� I
stroked the bed sheet.� Warm.� Smooth.�
Pure white.� Like my Master
Christian.� He'd slipped into my room
after Durien had finished and watched me pretend to sleep.� Hadn�t he?

&nbsp;

I pulled
against the bindings again until the pain brought tears to my eyes. �I raised my head again and looked at
myself.� I was wearing clothes, wasn�t
I?� If I had, they were long since gone
and were replaced by nothing.� 

&nbsp;

I worked my
hands.� The skin on my right wrist burned
as I moved.� I�m hurting myself, I
thought.� What kind of restraints are
these?� I pulled against my left wrist
restraint.� Gently and firmly at first,
then not so gently and much more firmly.�
All I felt was the compression, but never freedom.� Soon, I was asleep again.

&nbsp;

�This is for
your own good, Rasha.�� I shivered in my
dream at the memory of what Durien had done to me; it was embedded in my flesh
and bones.� Now I was awake and couldn�t
help but remember how he�d examined me at dinner the night before; and how the
stinking bastard had enjoyed hurting me afterwards.� At first, I thought myself the unlucky
recipient of his warped version of foreplay.�
But as the time had worn on, I was compelled to conclude that the man
was truly a sadistic, misogynistic animal and simply did not like women in
general and me in particular.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I never saw
Durien again although I sometimes think of him.�
As indifferent as I am now about pain and regardless of how much I might
have willingly participated in the horror that night, I give thanks that the
human memory will not retain extreme pain.�
This forgetfulness serves the species well; without it, no woman would
willingly bear more than one child.� And
it also served me well too; for while the memory of Durien was still strong,
the remembrance of how much I had been hurt by him and how much he loathed me
at the end was already beginning to fade, maintaining no more substance than
might a mirage.� Fading even faster was
the remembrance of how much I think I had enjoyed his attention.

&nbsp;

All I
remember for sure was that after he had taken me beyond a certain level, what I
experienced was not, in the strict and narrow sense, pain.� I had loved it and I had hated it.� And as I am able to look back upon that night
now, it seemed the distilled essence of nightmare.� The dreams-that-were-not-dreams that I
experienced under his guidance had given me only the most fleeting and veiled
glimpses of a monster�s face.� But in the
end, the monster had invaded my mind and he was so strong that I had not the
capacity to either resist or flee.� As he
was finishing with me that last time, with both Christian and the slave Angie
viewing my shame for what I now knew was almost twelve minutes, I had been
nothing but a vessel of horror, his to do with as he pleased.� Then had come the culmination of my shame
when in only partly telling him a lie, I had thanked him for raping me.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I felt
different now---I could no longer call this man my Master.� Christian punished what he called my
insolence on and off for the rest of the day with short sessions of the whip
and the cane, finishing me off at the end with a quick touch of The
Discipline.� Although still unclean with
Durien�s seed, he twice took me like an animal, forcing me to respond to his
needs each time.� But he couldn�t hurt me
anymore, not after I�d experienced the monster Durien.� The day ended with both of us exhausted,
having agreed to an unofficial truce.� I
felt emotionally empty, too tired to gather the energy necessary to fire the
appropriate rage.� He released me as
darkness fell.� We ate together in
silence, then I went to my bed.� I sat on
the bed for some time, staring at nothing.�
My anger had receded, leaving behind edginess and despair, a certain
heaviness of limb and mood that reminded me of a terrible emotional
letdown.� I was a card that my Master held, and it had been my turn to be
played.� He was, I finally knew, a man
that I had learned to love; now I think I hated him.� With this man, there was no middle ground.

&nbsp;

I laid there
for about half an hour when I rolled off the bed and to my utter astonishment,
I began to laugh hysterically.� But the
fourth �ha� came out as an �oh�, as did the fifth and sixth, each harsher and
louder than the last.� Finally, I was
jack-knifed so drastically that I fell forward onto my knees.� I rocked on my knees and it shattered the
stuttering rhythm of my diaphragm.� Like
an engine catching, I settled into great cyclic sobs that filled and emptied my
chest.� I rocked on my knees and my
sorrow and grief was a long time draining.�
Something about my position eventually changed my weeping, or perhaps it
was sheer lack of air; the sobs came shorter and closer together now, the pitch
rising and falling wildly.� 

&nbsp;

I had been
weeping as an adult woman would; now I wept as a baby.� It might have been neither the position nor
anoxia, but just need for mother or father that was imprinted on each
child.� But more than one kind of wound
closed over and began to scab that night.�
After a time, my sobs trailed off into slow breathing.� I fell asleep where I lay on the floor.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Chapter 41: She was not a woman likely to settle for equality when sex
gave her an advantage; Anthony Delano.

&nbsp;

The next morning, things were back to �normal� and I again resumed my
routine.� But at the same time, we knew
that we both had experienced a shift of seismic proportions in our
relationship; his betrayal and my sudden uncontrolled lust for another
Master.� My anger and rage may have gone,
but I was filled more than ever with a cold determination.� I had thought there was something between us,
no matter differences in our status.� And
even though I now knew that I probably meant nothing to him, ours nonetheless
had reached a crisis point which would either be resolved or not.� And if not, then I would have to leave---I
would leave him even if he tried to kill me.�
In any case, we both knew that this normality would never be �normal�
between us again.� 

&nbsp;

The
savageness of Durien and my bovine acceptance of his abuse had crushed me.� But Christian�s behavior afterwards breathed
new life into the emotions and feelings and needs of an independent woman he
had only briefly met at the beginning.� I
had gained a concept of freedom in his world and I was determined to never
again allow a man to use me as had Durien; to use my mouth as his toilet and my
body as his plaything, to be broken and discarded at will.

&nbsp;

I felt a
grim satisfaction in my newly reawakened assertiveness---and felt only regret
and full responsibility for it having taken so long.� I recognized now that from the very
beginning, his phallic chair and everything afterwards had somehow broken my
will and sucked dry my spirit to resist.�
Everything else logically followed from that first event as I had
grudgingly accepted all of Christian�s later intentions, one by one.� An involuntary shudder ran through me as I
thought of what I had experienced over the last six months, of everything I had
endured.� But no more!� Not after that bastard Durien!

&nbsp;

At the same
time, if I was truly honest with myself, I felt as if I had for a brief tortuous
period looked through a window into a life that I knew was exactly what I
wanted.

&nbsp;

I
appreciated his helping me understand what he seemed to sense immediately; that
there were parts of me that I had kept hidden from myself.� He had showed me that I viewed life from far
too narrow a framework, and that I had used this limited structure as a crutch
rather than an opportunity.� I had not
enjoyed or experimented with life��and I admit that I quickly came to enjoy
much of what he made me do with him and for him at the end.

&nbsp;

But I was a
different person now, for he had finally forced me to acknowledge the something
inside that welcomed his controlled brutality.�
And whatever this was, it had changed me---permanently.� I knew now that I enjoyed subservience; that
this streak ran wide and deep in me---and that knowledge drove me nuts.� But there it was.� 

&nbsp;

The problem
now was what to do next.� I knew no Dom�s
in town, so what could I do with the new me?�
What could I do with this new body and mind and awareness that had been
aroused?� To whom could I turn?� Who could I trust that would not abuse me as
had these others?� I tried to hide it,
but I knew I was heading towards our confrontation with a sharp pain needling
my heart.� Durien was a toxin and a
bringer of pain and anguish.� He was an
animal and frightened me terribly---but he was also predictable.� I never wanted to have to go through that
again, but the further I got away from what had happened, the more I realized
that the man was almost comically obvious in his methods of dominating a
woman.� And God help me, I still cared
for Christian, but I felt like he had broken an unspoken vow and he was now in
ways unworthy of what I had to offer.� I
think I loved this man, but the waters around me, were churning I thought, and
they wouldn't stop until I knew that I was on firmer ground, that I belonged to
a new, firmer-handed Dom that deserved one such as me.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

To say that
I was conflicted would be the understatement of the century.� I had long ago gotten over wanting to kill
Christian.� About the time I think I had
fallen in love with him.� But I was
shaken to my core for two weeks after Durien had paid me his surprise visit.� We obliquely referred to it as the
�event�.� Christian never mentioned it
again after the next morning, but it stood like a flaming concrete barrier
between us.� He left me considerably more
free now and spent time talking to me, but I was withdrawn and had little to
say in response.� He still wanted to lay
with me, and in this I had little choice but to agree.� But to me it was purely emotionless now; I
felt icy and all of the joy was gone.�
The trust, if any had existed, was gone.�
And I was now ready for the next step---the slave obtaining some degree
of her freedom---or the Master finally being forced to kill her in denial.

&nbsp;

His
treachery, his untrustworthiness was the first thing on my mind when I awoke
and the last thing I thought of at night.�
I tried to understand why he had allowed this to happen---no, quit
making excuses for him, it was even worse than that---he had actually arranged
for it to happen.� I could not get over
the deep sense of betrayal that I felt, both from him and even more horrifying,
by my very own body.� Worse, it seemed
that everything I had learned from him had been negated that night---personal
accountability and discipline, healthy sex without limits, the enduring trust
in him, my partner, my Master�..� The
most terrible part for me was that it had been such a surprisingly powerful and
emotional evening in which I had confirmed to myself and�.to him�.what I saw as
the most unwholesome side of my personality---I had finally been forced to
admit how attractive I found total submission and servility to a dominate
male.� 

&nbsp;

But I had
already begun my journey of exploration down this unwashed road.� It had taken far too long because I had lacked a sense of responsibility and the courage at the
beginning to assume the burden of slavery.�
But I had almost arrived.� Just before the event, I had finally been able begin admitting to
myself the unforeseen depth of my feelings for this man that was also my
Master.� My feelings were so unexpected;
this was the man that had kidnapped me, raped and tortured me and then forced
me to acknowledge a part of my nature that had both shocked me and sickened me
at first---yet at the same time he had awakened me to a whole new world.� One in which I willingly performed for him in
ways I had never before conceived that I might enjoy.� I no longer considered myself married.� Anything prior to my time here was in the
past.� The past was where I had not
understood the dark, unrestrained and undisciplined needs within me and,
lacking a good Dom as a guide, I had subsequently acted inappropriately.� With this man leading the way, I had no
longer felt so controlled by the forbidden desires and needs within me.

&nbsp;

But his
actions had destroyed any sense of trust that I might have had.� And if we were finished, what was I to do
now?� What did I want?� And how could I get it?� Much as I hated to think of it, would he let
me go easily, freeing me without a fight?�
And even if he did, now that I had been awakened like this, where could
I go?� What would I do with the new me?� To whom could I turn for guidance�.and caring
dominance?� 

&nbsp;

This man
only now had finally begun to understand the limits of his control over me and
the cross-pollinating aspect of our relationship.� Even though I knew that he needed me as much
as I needed him, I hadn�t voluntarily spent the night with him since the
event.� 

&nbsp;

But tonight
was different; he had dinner reservations for tonight.� It felt like this was an attempt to find out
if there was anything left between us and seemed more like he was asking me out
on a date rather than ordering me to accompany him---I think he was afraid I
would refuse him if he had.� He wanted to
take me to a nice place and even though I didn�t feel like spending a lot of
time getting ready, I felt I owed it to myself.�
And I wanted him to see what he had cast aside.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

Two hours later, I was drying my hair with a towel.� She walked out of the White Room looking
spectacular, accompanied only by the soft, almost subliminal swoosh, swoosh sound of nylon clad thighs rubbing as she walked.� Black, shiny high-heeled pumps over light
black, almost dusky gray sheer stockings, and tight black pencil skirt that
ended three inches above her knees; crisp white silk blouse open deeply in
front confirming the lack of a bra and the presence of a thin, tightly
stretched golden chain that connected her breast rings.� Hair brushed into thick, luxurious waves;
light makeup perfectly applied, long dangling earrings.� Great eyes, open, frank, intelligent.� I had allowed her to choose her dress for tonight
and what she wore was simple and uncomplicated, yet far beyond anything I could
have imagined.� I felt a great, instant
jolt of pleasure as I got my first sight of Rasha that night---I knew instantly
that she was perfect for me; at least right now.� 

&nbsp;

But the woman I had named Rasha had changed.� Tonight she did not wear the decorative
choker that she'd been given to wear as a collar in public.� I made a god of accurate information in my
profession, but did not know what to think now.�
I had broken her, then after the last terrible abuse, she'd rebelled�my
every wish was no longer her command.�
She had lived through her transformation at Durien�s hands.� Was it, I asked myself, that searing
of an experience, affecting everything about her?� Was that what had made the difference?� This was the worst thing, I thought to
himself; she had become unpredictable.

&nbsp;

I wanted her again.� Being
with her, lying between her thighs.� It
was as close as I would ever get to heaven.�
A dive into the infinite; the ecstatic moment of oblivion as I achieved
release inside her body.� But I was pretty
sure that I had already blown that.

&nbsp;

But maybe not.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

We had
spoken little this evening, something that had become habit since Durien.� Master's eyes somehow made me feel like a
side of meat, but I at least had the consolation as I looked at the front of
his pants that he still felt it was pretty good meat.� Once I was ready, it only took him a few more
minutes and he was leading me to his car.�
It was a clear mid-June evening; slightly cool and not particularly
muggy, a nice night to be out.� I had never
eaten at the restaurant to which he had reservations.� It specialized in seafood; I was looking
forward to the food, but the proposed conversation had me on edge.� Christian opened my car door and helped me
out because of my difficulties with the tight skirt, then I unconsciously
allowed him to precede me as I had been taught so many months ago.

&nbsp;

Seated, we
ordered a white wine while we looked at the menu.� After we had both ordered, a long
uncomfortable silence ensued.� Finally, I
broke the ice with a question.� �We�re
not being joined by anyone, are we?�

&nbsp;

He gave a
soft laugh as he replied, �No.� Not
tonight, we�re not.�� There was another
long, uncomfortable silence.

&nbsp;

�We have to
talk,� I said quietly.� 

&nbsp;

�That we
do,� Christian admitted.

&nbsp;

�I needed you
to do something for me.� With me.� What you did to me.� Before, I mean.� What you did has---�� I looked down at my hands.� �had an impact I didn't...didn't expect.�

&nbsp;

�Ah,� he
said, �that.�

&nbsp;

�You've
changed me,� I said violently.� �You
fixed me.�

&nbsp;

My voice
quieted.� �I suppose I should feel
grateful, but that isn't how it feels.� I
don't feel grateful, I feel fixed.�
You've created this....imbalance in me, and I want that part of me
back.�

&nbsp;

�In spite of
what you did to me�..or perhaps because of it�I�m still strongly attracted to
you,� I said, turning to look out at the lake in back of the restaurant.� I wasn�t really seeing it at the moment, but
it was a better place to look than upon his face.� �But�I have screwed up so many things in my
life that I don�t trust myself when it comes to any attraction to men.� Do you understand that?�

&nbsp;

�Yes,� he
replied.� He moved back in his seat and
kept a respectable distance between us.

&nbsp;

�I was�.with
my husband for several years and then I made mistakes in my work,� I continued
carefully.� �Then you brought me
here.� You took away my choices and
forced me to be with you.� Many times.� In many ways.�
I did not like it.� At first.� Later�I came to enjoy your company�and the
things that we�ve done together.� I hate
that!� Do you understand?� I hate that in me!�

&nbsp;

I gazed at the faces around me, allowing my fantasy free rein for
a few seconds. �To have had a family for once....�� I continued with in a scornful tone, �Was it
so much to ask?� You're afraid I�ve been
dreaming about us, aren't you?�

&nbsp;

I leaned back against my chair.�
For some reason I felt almost defensive.�
�Well, even if I have, that�s not a crime.�

&nbsp;

He snorted, �Depends on who you are.� In my case, I dream only of the
possible.� But with you, I�m not so
sure.� You�re a dreamer by nature.� You dream of the impossible, and that's a
kind of prison.�

&nbsp;

�Without dreams, I�d be dead from the neck up.......�

&nbsp;

Christian shook his head, �You just see yourself differently from
the way the mob sees you.�

&nbsp;

�The mob?� Isn�t that going
a bit too far?�

&nbsp;

�No.� That's just the way of
the world where people like us are concerned.�

&nbsp;

I shrugged, �I�ll be alright.......once I'm done with you.�

&nbsp;

�I've finally realized that you've given me nothing.�� I shrugged again. �You've taken from me and
you've rearranged me to suit yourself, but you've given me nothing of you.�

&nbsp;

He looked up at me from under his eyelashes.� �Sometimes you only have to give a little to
get a lot in return.�

&nbsp;

�Not
anymore.� I'm not an innocent woman and I
didn�t want to love you,� I said, almost pleading.� �And because of this, I don�t trust myself
anymore.� I�m not one of those wannabee
women who plays at the submissive game.�
I'm the real thing.� You've forced
me to acknowledge that I have this�.weakness that I�ve found for
servility.� It disgusts me.� And since you gave me to Master Durien,� I
actually spat his name out, � I feel broken�.inadequate, as if there is nothing
of strength left inside me; sometimes I think that it would be so much better
if I'd just let you....or him,� take
everything.� Every time you desired
something new, I found myself wanting to please you in the most desperate
way.� I�ve never felt this way
before�.this.� But then you allowed it to
happen with�..him.� I really loved you
before that, but I think I hate you now.�

&nbsp;

He looked
crushed, his face stricken.

&nbsp;

�You'll
never do that to me again against my will.��
Now I was angry and it showed.�
�You raped my body in the beginning when you kept me tied up, and you
raped my mind at the end when you made me care for you.� I came to trust you, but you weren�t
worthy.� You head-raped me because I
can�t consent to sex with someone who doesn�t exist.� It�s not consensual if someone binds you with
lies and ties you up with their deceptions.�
You know what you did.� You
impersonated the man who should be my husband in every way that counts.� The emotional support you offered was even
more important than the physical.� But
every time you stuck your cock in me, every time you disciplined me, you were
pretending to be the man I thought I needed.�

&nbsp;

�And then
you gave me to Durien---do you know---do you have any idea---how degraded that
made me feel; how used, how dirty, how stupid?�
Got a cure for that?� How about a
little rape victim counseling?� How about
I sit down and try to explain to someone how it feels to be tortured and fucked
by a maniac?� And even worse, to wind up
liking it!�� I knew that I needed to
cry---to howl and wail and scream---but my cold rage wouldn�t let me.

&nbsp;

He replied
slowly, �I like the way I feel with you.�
I want you to stay.� If I had
asked.......�� I looked at him almost in
disbelief, but did not say anything.� �I
was wondering.� If Durien had not
happened, what would you have said?�

&nbsp;

�I might
have said yes,� I said cruelly.

&nbsp;

�Really?�

&nbsp;

�Really.�

&nbsp;

�But now,� I
said to Christian, �I'm tired.� I need to
get away.� I need peace and silence.� I need to be away from men for awhile.� You're not going to do something stupid, are
you?�� My mind was functioning in
obsessive spurts.� But at least I could
face this situation without losing my mind.�
As much as it pained me, as much as I wanted to reject the idea, it was
inevitable; I would never be the same again.�
A painful fracture had occurred in my life because of him; a fissure
that split me into two irreconcilable parts and distanced me from my roots and
family forever.

&nbsp;

He started
to reach over and lay his hand on mine, then seemed to think better of it at
the last second.� He said softly, �We're
too much alike for you to leave me.� If
you don�t think that I�m like you, that I have �issues� too, then you�re
nuts.� We both have them.�

&nbsp;

�I know that
I have them,� I replied quietly.� �You
tell me I'm perfect for you.� But I'm as
whole as I will ever be.....right now, and if I'm perfect now, then so are
you.� In this, I am no more whole than
you are.� But that doesn�t matter
anymore; we may share imperfections, but I can't stand yours anymore.�

&nbsp;

There was a
long silence, then Christian said, �You�ve been traumatized; yes, by me, but
you had all that baggage before you met me.�
There are dark things in both our heads.�
What had happened to you before me and what I did to you.�� 

&nbsp;

He looked
uncomfortable now.� �I have the
reputation of being a tomcat�.not only a tomcat, but a mean one too.� I've never been serially monogamous before in
my life, but I have been since you�ve been with me�except for that one
night.� The point is that I don�t really
understand women, but I understand them well enough.� And as insane as it sounds because of the way
we started, I understand that there is something going on between us.� And I�d like to find out what it is.� I know that trust will be an issue between us
for a long time, but I�m offering to talk about this now.�

&nbsp;

He continued
with a shrug.� �You know that I have a
dark side too.� I picked you for your
vulnerability and then I lied to you in order to use you.� I do what I have to do to survive.� It's your basic function-related raptor
ethics.� But my point is that we're both
equally screwed up.� I�m willing to try
to see why I�m the way I am, and whether you stay with me or not, you�re going
to have to look at your dark side also.�
Your very own.� You�ll think that
that side is something different from everyone else�s.� That there are things in there that you don�t
want to share, because nobody could feel the way that you do.� But that�s not true---others have the same
thoughts too, the same shameful thoughts and feelings.�� 

&nbsp;

�Life,� he
said, �is like one big multiple choice test.�
A series of questions that we answer through choices we make.� Sometimes our choices work for us and
sometimes against us.� Most of the time,
it's not the choice itself that is stressful, but the consequences of the
choice.� The results we couldn't foresee
or couldn't quite imagine.� But when we
finally make our choice and realize that it was the wrong one, we wish there
was some way to go back, one big do-over.�

&nbsp;

His face
twisted for a second as he thought back to what he had done to me.� �I screwed up,� he confessed.� �I got so involved in my own fantasies that I
didn�t remember that you had needs too.�
One of the main aspects of a relationship like ours is the continual
probing and pressing for boundaries.� 

&nbsp;

�In the
beginning, you thought you were dominant, but you�re actually more comfortable
as a Sub---like most other bottoms, even though you try harder, you know you'll
feel less responsibility for the ultimate success of the relationship and less
guilt afterwards if it gets screwed up.�
A woman like you generally gets more from the play if only gently
pressed at the boundaries in your mind.�
But when I forced them too hard and too far at the end, it pushed you
out of your enjoyment zone and into fear and horror territory.� I should have been more careful to avoid
this.�

&nbsp;

He shrugged
hopelessly.� �What I didn�t take into
account early enough was that when I did something wrong, the scarring was
worse because of the failed trust.� I've
never had someone that I've trusted like that.�
I�m not trying to make excuses, but please believe that a lot of the
time it was just me misreading your cues, even if it came across to you as
failed trust.�

&nbsp;

�Finally,�
he said, �I think there is also another thing going on too.� As a young girl, you were raised in the
church and you internalized a lot of those teachings.� There has always been a feminine�..tension
over sexuality within the Christian tradition.�
Theology has always been interspersed with the same sexual guilt that I
think you feel now.� Feminine sinners
have always chosen to purify their flesh either through abstinence and
chastity�a route you�ve obviously chosen to ignore�.or through self-inflicted
punishment.� What may have started out
for you as an involuntary act of the flesh may have become a way to atone for
your sexual guilt.� This is a very
Catholic reaction.�

&nbsp;

I didn�t
know how to respond, so I remained silent.�
As we ate, I thought about what he had said; some of it was remarkably
insightful, and a lot of it was bullshit.

&nbsp;

We were
finished now.� From his face he hoped for
forgiveness and a second chance as he stood and pulled my chair back for
me.� I swept to my feet, but did not move
into his waiting arms.� Even as others
continued to eat, oblivious to what was going on, I stood like a warrior queen
and my soft voice rolled out in challenge.�
�Are you glad?� Are you glad
you�ve made me into what you wanted?� I asked coolly.

&nbsp;

I looked at
him for a moment.� �I�m not Mother Teresa
and have never pretended to be.� What I
am is a slave and a prisoner.� I�m the
lifer wandering around the prison yard: I�ve got the Warden in my pocket and
I�ve got the best cell and the run of the place, but sometimes I can�t wait
until I get out.� And if I ever do get
out, I wonder---will I ever really get away from you?� And if I do, will I be able to stay away?�

&nbsp;

I shook my
head, a look of abandon on my face.�
�I�ve proven to you who I am so many times, but now I�m so tired.� I�ve learned to live with your strength, but
more than your strength, your weaknesses.�
And when you get used to living with something, you�re tied to it.� And you don�t want to break away.� But now, I just want to live a little more
normal existence.��� 

&nbsp;

I was a
strong woman, an intelligent woman.� Why
had I continued to let him do these things to me, allowing him to abuse me
again and again?� I started crying in the
restaurant, tears running down my cheeks.�
I didn�t know the answer for sure, but the answer I suppose was that I
had no one else.� Without him, I had
nothing.� I had no one.� He was all I had.� But even more important, I was all that he
had.� If not me, who else would he turn
to?� 

&nbsp;

He just
looked at me, unable to refute my need, or his.

&nbsp;

�Rope and
leather bindings do make it easier to control the person, don�t they?� I said
softly as I began to walk back towards the exit.� �How can I believe you?� You sound like someone who's just read this
stuff in a book.� You're still like a
toxin, bringing only change and pain.�
This is your way, and you know no other.�

&nbsp;

�Listen,
damn it,� Christian said.� He paced
behind me, fists clenched, the image of a carnivore at heel.� �You were already in awful shape before
me.� The only difference between then and
now is that you have a man in your life.�
You have needs that only I can fill.�

&nbsp;

I spun.� �Do you really believe that?� Can I believe that?� I snapped.� �What---are you going to do---give me to
fifteen men the next time I make you angry?�

&nbsp;

He took a
deep breath that trembled with the emotion that he was trying to keep out of
his voice.� �There will be problems,
there are always problems. �But no other
men,� he promised. 

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I lay in his
bed as he had ordered me, but on the very edge as far away from where he would
lay as I could get.� He walked into the
bedroom, reached into his pocket and pulled out a slim box.� I took it.�
TIFFANY was written on it.� Yeah, right, I thought to myself.� The room was not well lit, but there was
lighting enough to see.� I snapped the
box open and was dazzled by the sight of gemstones, blue stars.� I blinked, hardly able to see.� Star sapphires.� A bracelet of star sapphires set in
platinum.� I peered closely and
recognized immediately that they were real, not synthetic.� Each one was different, each one slightly
flawed, each one with its very own nuance of color and hue and
personality.� I turned the box in the
light, seeing the stars on each stone move, the light reflecting off their
rutilated depths.� I swallowed, feeling a
sudden lump in my throat.� No one had
given me anything like this, ever.�
Ever.� I felt a hot tickling in my
eyes, which I instantly blinked away, horrified to find myself still so
vulnerable.

&nbsp;

I said in an
offhand way, �Nice collection of fakes you�ve got here.�

&nbsp;

�I was
hoping you would like star sapphires, Rasha.�

&nbsp;

I swallowed
again, going up on one elbow and keeping my face turned to the bracelet so he
wouldn�t see my eyes.� I don�t think I
had ever loved anything so much at this moment as this bracelet.� Sri Lankan star sapphires, my favorite, each
one unique, forged in the depths of the earth by immense heat and
pressure---wonder incarnate.� I knew that
I was being shamelessly and openly manipulated, but at the same time I thought;
Why not?� Why shouldn�t I take it?� Wasn�t this the way the world worked?� Give him one more chance?

&nbsp;

I felt his
hand come to rest on my shoulder, giving it the gentlest of squeezes.� It was like an electric shock.� To my mortification, a tear escaped and ran
slowly down my cheek.� I blinked rapidly,
unable to speak, grateful that he was behind me and couldn�t see.� Another hand took the other shoulder, squeezing
just a little in unison, and I could feel the heat of his presence on the nape
of my neck.� An erotic charge ran through
me like a bolt of lightning and I flushed and tingled all over.

&nbsp;

�Okay,� I
whispered and turned to face him.� I
could be his whore if that was what he wanted.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

She turned pushed me down on the bed, then straddled me and showed
me her gorgeous ass.� She bent forward
and spread her cheeks, but her mouth never made contact with my groin.� Instead, it was my turn to perform.

&nbsp;

�Lick me,� she said with sudden urgency.� �I want you to give me pleasure.�� It was suddenly like I was with a different
woman, and she was demanding things that I wasn't sure I was able to give
her.� Hers was suddenly an angry,
dominant tone as she ordered me to perform.�
Reluctantly, I pressed my face into her crease.� After a moment, I'd worked up enough courage
to spear forward with my tongue, working the tight whorl of her closed sphincter.� I wasn't enjoying this.� I wrapped my arm around one long thigh to
steady myself and with the other hand I reached up and found her already
wet.� The ball of my thumb sank into
Rasha from the front as my tongue worked deeper from the rear, both rubbing
soft, synchronized circles amid her insides.�
She grunted, somewhere at the base of her throat as my tongue sank
deeper into her.� I caught the
reverberations of her deep moan in the pit of my stomach and found myself
stiffening in response, despite my initial distaste.� I didn't last long.� Suddenly, I didn't care about anything but
Rasha as she traced her pierced nipples up and down my skin.� Her mouth sucked and her curled fingers
pumped.� My orgasm went on for over
thirty seconds.� 

&nbsp;

When I could breathe again, I found she was lying back smiling at
me.� I grabbed a perfect thigh and pulled
her to me.� I sank my tongue back into
her and heard a soft moan.� I pressed my
tongue down harder, forgetting to breathe, and then discovering that I didn't need
to for a long time.� Rasha's writhings
grew more urgent and she wrapped her thighs around my neck.� I cupped her ass and squeezed, pushing my
face into the folds of her cunt, then slid my thumb back inside her and
recommenced the soft circular motion that was in counterpoint to the spiraling
of my tongue.� She gripped my head with
both hands and crushed my face against her.�
Writhings became thrashings, her moans a sustained shout that filled my
ears like the sound of surf.� I sucked.� She stiffened, and screamed, and then
shuddered for minutes.� 

&nbsp;

She was mine again.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

The next
morning, I was up before dawn.� I watched
the sun rise, splitting the night like a fruit.�
I'd jotted a note and left it on the kitchen table, wanting to escape
the house before any conversation with him, before my mind could be
disturbed.� I walked quickly from the
house down towards the lake, feeling the small thrill of a false escape.� The morning air felt gloriously fresh and I
paused to breathe it in more deeply.�
There wasn�t a single human sound.�
It was at times like this that I often wanted to walk, when the
stillness of the morning preserved a clarity lent by night and distance of
sleep---when for minutes at a time I could perceive the faint remaining harmony
that had once existed in my life, or which existed still.� As I walked for what seemed hours in the
morning, the memory of his betrayal and its pain were finally shed and replaced
by a tentative imagining of the way things might be again.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

Perhaps I was spoiled, but there'd only ever been three really
good, that is to say seriously magical, times in my life.� This was not to say that I hadn't been lucky
too.� I'd been very lucky that first
night when my knees wobbled with the fever of his breast jewelry.� Everything had hurt me then; the lights,
every color, every sound, my mind pressing out into the world like a swollen
ghost.� I remember how I lay there after
the fever had broke and I'd begun to get better, the first thing I saw when I
opened my eyes were the glass window blocks set up high and the daylight
streaming through them, little dots and blobs of color that I'd never seen
before, all swimming in my fevered eyes like bugs in water.

&nbsp;

But the first time of true magic had been in the back of that van
with those teenage boys.� It was then
that I realized the power of my body to control males.� The second time had been when I finally
capitulated to my Master.� He changed my
life forever, bringing me pleasure in every way and teaching me that which I
never even known existed.� And even
though I hadn't recognized it at the time, the third time had been when I was
given to Durien for the night.� In
retrospect, that night had been the most incredible night of sex that I had
ever experienced.� 

&nbsp;

Wondrous degradation leading to complete powerlessness and total
submission.� If my Master had given me to
that man a second time, I don't think I would have been able to come back to
him.� And both Durien and I had realized
instantly that if he had me permanently, I would die in his hands.� But like a lemming running for the edge of an
infinitely tall cliff, I would be screaming my pleasure all the way.� Later, I sometimes woke up in the middle of
the night and looked over at my Master sleeping by my side, knowing that I was
his forever, but still wondering in my mind what that last ride into oblivion
would have been like.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Nine months after it had all begun, it was another hot and humid
fall afternoon on the Georgia coast and I lay in the lounge chair on the deck
in back.� My skin was tanned a light
gold, the color perfectly setting off my eyes and sun-bleached white-blond
hair.� A breeze stirred and helped to
make me feel a little less sticky.� Lost
in thought, I flung my forearm over my eyes to block out a little more of the
sun.� He would be home soon and I was
ready.� I�d done my nails earlier and my
makeup was on, but I hadn�t been out in the sun long enough for it to be
smeared with sweat.� As usual, I was
wearing something that he liked; this afternoon it was a small�.a very small
white bikini top and thong bottoms, finished off with expensive strappy white
high heels.� I curled my toes in the
sandals and admired the bold color on my toenails.� It was easy enough to do and it pleased him
immensely.� 

&nbsp;

We had reached an accommodation in our roles....we each had rules
now and I much more freedom.� I know I
belonged to him, but in many ways, I felt freer now than ever before.� I would never have done this for him if
anyone else was around, but it was a small enough price to pay for the peace I
felt.� My life was like a beautiful
garden without fences, for everywhere I looked gave me pleasure.� 

&nbsp;

Our relationship had undergone a lot of changes over the last four
months.� I wore a white velvet choker
today, symbolic acknowledgment of the status I both acknowledged and accepted,
at least publicly.� I rarely wore the
leather anymore, except when it was necessary for the White Room.� But even more important, I was perfectly
content my role, having received more from him in the short time that we�d been
together than I'd ever had from my husband over the years of our marriage.� Both Master Christian and I had been wounded
long before we�d met; we talked little about those times now, but laughed a lot
about the future we had together.� I felt
that both of us had regained much of our confidence and life seemed good. 

&nbsp;

Looking back, my time with him has seemed an endless and
bewildering experience.� When he'd first
taken me, he'd guided me through my training with complete confidence.� I could tell that he had been planning this
for a woman like me for a life-time.� It
had been a pilgrimage for him of sorts.�
One that I had been fortunate to share.�
It took me awhile to realize that I had been a necessary component in
his journey; an ever present servant as we explored at the end every intimate
contour of my body and the desires that ruled it....and him.� There was a secret significance to this that
I had yet to understand.� We had traveled
an immense distance to understand something that he already seemed to have
experienced himself.� 

&nbsp;

All I knew was that I wasn't bottom to his top because he'd
dominated me physically at the beginning.�
Rather I had given myself to him because of what he finally offered me
emotionally at the end.� Despite my
initial �misgivings,� I was now satisfied with my life none-the-less, for it
seemed more than big enough for me now.�
Physically, it was active, exciting, stimulating; almost a utopia.� Daily I relived the sensations.� The lightness.� The power.�
The pain.� Best of all, there was
a spiritual aspect now between us; a sense of oneness I had never before
experienced with another man.� 

&nbsp;

I had the run of the house and I dressed comfortably during the
day; shorts, a sports bra or tube top and matching choker, flip-flops and
perhaps a ball cap when I worked outside on the lawn and the landscaping,
sometimes a lot less when I stayed in.�
But not when he was home; when the man that was also my Master was home,
I dressed to please.� I knew that I would
never have done this for any man a year ago, but now it was different---I felt totally
confident in what we had and did everything I could to please Master.� The wonderful part, the part that gave me so
much confidence as a woman was that that we were so connected inside now; I
knew he felt the same as I.� It was quite
a thing, quite a privilege, to care about someone so much that the measure of
the worth of your life was changed by it.

&nbsp;

I�d gained a couple of pounds over the last few months.� But I never looked at myself in the mirror
unless I was putting on my face.� I knew
that I looked better than I ever had before.�
But my looks didn't matter to me, except in how much pleasure they might
give him.� 

&nbsp;

I thought about our relationship and how it had changed over the
last six months.� The things that he had
done to me at first and the things that I had allowed him to do......� The early non-consensual period was confusing
and there were a few times, just a few times, when late at night I would awake
and realize that I still feared parts of it.�
That in turn always led to thoughts of how we had both changed.� Everything I saw here measured exactly and
correctly against the template of my memory, and yet the contours were subtly
and indescribably different.� I was much
stronger now, and he was good to me.� Of
course, I'd earned his affection with my body and my submission to his
will.� But with this submission, I had
regained a significant measure of control too.�
I was happy, and mostly it seemed that he felt that way too.� But there were still those few times that
Master seemed distant, unhappy, sometimes pacing at night like a caged wild
animal.

&nbsp;

We continued to use the White Room as the mainstay of our sexual
play.� I had never known how much better
my sex life could be when I had inhabited a consensual world.� He'd opened my eyes with just a glimpse of
it; that there was a sexual life in mythic proportions of which I had never
dreamed; and once I known it had existed, there was no holding me back.� My role as submissive to his dominant, and
his to mine; the new rules and boundaries we both accepted, everything new had
been easily integrated into our comfortable life by both of� us now.�
I felt so much better about myself and consequently, was less demanding of
either myself or him, and the nightmares that had so tormented me had finally
fled.� I�d become more mature in my
outlook towards life and much less cynical; my temper tantrums were a thing of
the past and my outlook was habitually sunny.

&nbsp;

My back still
ached from the strokes he�d given me last night.� These had in turn been offset by the touch of
his tongue; always demanding, always probing.�
These two physical extremes had combined to make me dizzy with
desire.� The search for the perfect
mixture of pain and pleasure has always haunted me.� But now I was no longer alone; we haunted the
darkest sexual back-alleys together as we searched for what we both
needed.� We were perfect together.� He�d been on a similar quest in an earlier
world, before me: taking from women of every walk of life, teaching them and
learning from them, always bringing his fantasies to life in living
technicolor.� Then he took me.� And in the end, I was the one who craved the
opposite of his every fantasy.� The one
who needed to be taken as much as he needed to possess, who needed to feel the
pain as much as he needed to inflict it. 

&nbsp;

Had he found me
or I him?� In the larger pattern woven by
life, there are no accidents.� When
significant events happen, instinct demands that we assign responsibility.� We assign blame or responsibility because
we're terrified of the truth; that life is random.� There is cause, but there is little
design.� I have never believed that everything happens for a reason.� I have always known, however, that everything
does happen.� Prey are destined to be taken by the predator just as the sun rises in
the east and women are destined to belong to men.� And in the end, I couldn't fight him anymore;
all I sought was to be transformed, not consumed.�� 

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

He was like a child in so many ways, so easily pleased by the
little things that I did for him.� I
performed in ways for him now that I would NEVER have willingly done for
another man; in my heart, I knew he was mine now and my actions ensured that he
would never want another but me.� And as
time went on and the trust between us matured, the realization grew that we
both belonged in a lifestyle that had until then seemed like a figment of both
of our imaginations, a wish not quite come true.� We had great sex now, routinely incorporating
chains, ropes, spreader bars and cuffs, along with many other more�.....exotic
things.� For his pleasure, I willingly
rode the wooden horse now, perhaps three or four times a month on the
average.� I still remembered the first
time I volunteered him this precious gift; I might have felt a little
uncertainty, but all I recollected for sure was my cheerful willingness to
offer him whatever he wanted and whatever gave him pleasure.� 

&nbsp;

The initial shock of my weight driving the board up between my
legs had been terrible in its intensity, crushing my will to move or to
fight.� I had first frozen like a statue,
but the pain was too great, claiming me again and again, continually forcing me
to make minor adjustments that were no help at all.� But after awhile, in my helplessness I had
begun to not only accept the agonizing sensations, but incorporated them and
let them take me higher into a previously undiscovered level of pain and
ultimately, pleasure.� 

&nbsp;

Even with my eyes closed and my head thrown back, I could still
somehow sense him watching me and masturbating at the same time; it was then
that I had begun to make small back and forth rocking motions, screaming at
first my agony and finally the pleasure that I'd felt flooding from
within.� This had been what had won him
over.� I was his and he was mine after
that; my Master AND my slave.

&nbsp;

I'd seen videos of that myself that night and had been shocked at
what I saw.� In a way, I hated the dark
side that made me act that way and feel these things.� But with his help over the weeks and months
that we have been together, I eventually learned to control the beast, if not
tame it.� And now, it was only when we
were alone together in the White Room that I let the dark monster out and stood
in its shadows.� I blushed as I
acknowledged that I had become a slut for pain.�
But that wasn�t correct either; I would allow myself to be a whore only
for the pain that I received from my Master.�
I would never perform like this for another man again, not even for
Durien; may he rot in hell.� 

&nbsp;

The bone-deep guilt and shame were gone too since that other
flawed person had disappeared with my increased happiness.� That person had had difficulties in her life
and had done some bad things�.but I was trying my absolute best to do better
now.� And with this realization, I had
become much less hard on myself.� 

&nbsp;

I had also finally realized that there were no existing moral
authorities that had ever prevented me from submitting to the situation here,
and that no one would ever have blamed me if I did.� All the initial unwillingness had been in my
mind.� Ultimately, I accepted the
unexpectedly servile side of my nature; but only after I'd realized that it was
only one facet of my character.� It had
taken a long time to understand that each of us has to make up our own mind on
the issue of how we handle our captivity---and make no mistake, each of is a
prisoner in some way.� You can choose to
accept what someone does to you---or not; but however you believe, that
generally won�t prevent it from happening.�
I was a smart, educated woman---and since there were no experts in
ethics present to give me guidance, I had chosen to accept my situation; and
then work from within to change it to something more suitable.� As a result, at least for me, life was both
simpler than before and certainly more enjoyable than ever before.� 

&nbsp;

I was also aware that many others decide to accept what another
might say on moral matters---but then they've made that someone their moral
authority; even so, in the end the decision to do that was always theirs.� They too had decided to submit to another
person rather than think things through for themselves.� 

&nbsp;

My head hurts, I smiled to myself.

&nbsp;

The radio playing softly beside me began to broadcast news on the
half-hour; this reminded me that I was old news now.� I had learned that the warrant for my arrest
had been withdrawn at almost the same time as had Master Christian; this had
gone a long ways towards my peace of mind.�
It took away much of his leverage over me, but I'd remained silent with
this knowledge.� I never figured out for
sure why this was and after a lot of thought, why I had chosen to stay with him
after Durien.� I honestly couldn�t say
why I did this; perhaps I knew even then that I loved him---or perhaps I had
wanted to have the time to control him within his own personal environment---or
perhaps I had planned on killing him for what he was doing to me---I�d never
really known for sure at the time.

&nbsp;

Just then, I heard a sound in the kitchen.� The door opened a minute later and Christian
walked out and stood by my chair.� He put
a fresh iced tea on the small table by my side.�
He gave me his normal welcoming smile and dropped to his knees by my
side.� After giving me a quick kiss, I
smiled and offered him my hand.� His warm
skin touched mine; I felt transformed.�
It wasn�t happiness.� No,
happiness was a childish, temporary illusion I had finally realized.� Any pain that might have been there melted
away and I felt sure that the two of us had created a center, a constancy, a
whole.� He looked at me with an intense
energy in his eyes, then let go of my hand and stood up quickly.� Our closeness was almost painful; it felt as
if we had both crossed a terrible, wonderful line.� The pain he'd felt and the nightmares he
suffered were so much better now; we both knew it was because of my entry into
his life.

&nbsp;

He poured a good amount of suntan oil into the palm of his hand
and began our now familiar afternoon ritual.�
After rubbing his hands together for a second, he began to apply the oil
to my body.� He slowly lifted the bikini
top and after baring both of my breasts, he began to gently rub the lotion into
them.� I smiled in pleasure as I watched
him.� Once both were well oiled, he
cupped each prize separately with the familiarity of ownership and gently
placed it back in the bikini.� Finished
on top, Christian now began working on my abdomen.� He slowly rubbed the suntan lotion into the
soft skin that overlaid my still hard abdomen and then went on to do my
thighs.� 

&nbsp;

It was clear to us both that he was my Master and that I belonged
to him.� But that didn't mean I was
powerless, not at all.� While I didn't
have the right to complain like a free woman, there were still many, many ways
that I could let him know what made me happy.�
I stretched like a cat in the hot sun, rolled over on my stomach and let
him finish oiling my body.� 

&nbsp;

I loved this man and he loved me.�


&nbsp;

Men were so easy.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

We sat on the couch in the living room late that evening.� Rasha took another sip of the wine I'd served
her, pulled her legs up under her and turned a little sideways so that she
could see me better.� I turned too, until
we were more or less facing each other from a foot away.� 

&nbsp;

Our relationship seemed to have gone through phases ranging from
the completely non-consensual to absolute servility, the last driven by her
strong need to accept everything I'd decided was necessary.� The capture stage and her initial
bewilderment; the early stages of training and discipline, and her often
barely controlled anger; the middle-times in which she finally began to
recognize the value of the opportunities offered, yet it was still a time
during which her pride wouldn't allow acceptance; the final crushing of any
remaining pride, and the final approval of the humbled slave as she
not only consented, but endorsed and supported the life journey she'd begun
over the last few months.� 

&nbsp;

Her life had become a finely sculpted thing.� I did not love her, but I'd valued her enough
to have accorded her my fidelity for our time together since Durien.� She was a beauty; literally a malleably
sexual woman.� Never less than perfect
when on display, she was a molten woman in private, ready to find pleasure in
an almost infinitely extended range of activities.� But now, there had creeped back into our life
an undercurrent of presumed equality, of her seeming to need to give her
opinion on many things that I did, or that we did together.� I know that I was often too soft during this
last stage, the stage we seemed to be in now.�
Things had to change.� Things
would change.

&nbsp;

I stopped talking and watched her, silent, thoughtful.� It seemed to me that her looks were different
now from when I first acquired her.� The
thick white-blond hair hanging long and soft most of the time like a frame
around her face, with just a subtle hint of inward curl at the ends that hadn't
been there before.� Even her face seemed
different to me.� Maybe it was just the
fact that even though there had been no ceremony, she considered herself a
happily married woman now and a woman like her could afford to spend more time
with makeup.� But I attributed it more to
what was behind the face.� It had finally
struck me that she had lost that sharp, watchful look that had so disconcerted
every man in the beginning.� 

&nbsp;

She looked great in the candle light.� Liquid eyes, soft skin.� I liked women as much as any man, but I had
always been ready to find something wrong with them.� The shape of an ear, the thickness of an
ankle, height, size, weight.� Any random
thing could ruin it for me.� But there
was nothing wrong with Rasha, nothing at all.

&nbsp;

I could smell her fragrance.�
A subtle perfume that she�d persuaded me to buy.� Soap, clean skin, clean hair.� Her hair fell to her collar bones.� She was slim and toned, except where she
shouldn�t be.

&nbsp;

I leaned forward and kissed her, just lightly on the lips.� I felt the blood warm metal of her nose ring
on my cheek; her mouth was open a little and was cool and sweet from the
wine.� Her tongue grazed my lower lip in
a contact that lasted several heartbeats.�
It was a good kiss, the kind that would normally speed a man's heart ten
or fifteen whacks a minute.� She broke it
off as my blood pressure soared despite my attempt to remain calm, then backed
away a few inches and gave me a tiny smile.�
I slid my free hand under her hair at the back of her neck.� Pulled her closer and kissed her harder.� She did the same thing with her free
hand.� We held the clinch for over a
minute, kissing, two wine glasses held approximately level in mid-air.� Then we parted and put our glasses down
simultaneously.

&nbsp;

She held the pause for a second and then leaned in and kissed me
again.� Used both of her hands; one
behind my head, the other behind my back.�
I did the same thing, symmetrically.�
Her tongue was cool and quick.�
Her back was narrow and her skin was warm.� After a moment, I slid my hand under her
blouse.� Felt her hand bunching into a
tiny fist and dragging my shirt out of my waistband.� Felt her nails against my skin.

&nbsp;

She raised her arms over her head and held the pose; I pulled her
blouse off without unbuttoning it.� She
was wearing only the semi-formal slave choker I'd purchased.� I raised my arms and she knelt on the sofa
and hauled my shirt over my head.� She
spread her hands like starfish on the slab of my chest.� Ran them south to my waist, then undid my
belt.� I lifted her up and laid her down
flat on the sofa and kissed her breasts, her wonderful, beautiful, exquisitely
sensitive breasts.� 

&nbsp;

I rolled over so that Rasha was on top of me now and I stroked her
back, lightly.� 

&nbsp;

�You seem pretty happy.��
Rasha said, leaning down to kiss me on the forehead and, not
coincidentally, dangling her pierced breasts in my face.� There was the hint of a smile on her lips and
a naughty look in her eyes.

&nbsp;

I hesitated for a minute before I reluctantly replied, �I am,�
reaching around in back to stroke soft flesh.�
My hands drifted down and cupped her muscular buttocks that were hidden
by the tight skirt that had ridden high on her thighs.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

My� body tingled all over as
I looked down at my lover�.and my Master.�
The thought of him brought a burn to my cheeks and a smile to my
face.� I could tell I was a little woozy
from the wine.� My thoughts were random
at the moment, appearing to have as much and as little geometric certainty as a
spider�s web.� They existed, but the
connection of one to another might as well have been random.� They were haphazard---every Dom needed to
know what the sub felt.� They were
jumbled and arbitrary---every Top needed to experience the bottom�s wondrous
sense of pain and pleasure, calm and panic.�
They were disordered---each of us has characteristics of both the top
and bottom inside us.� These fleeting
thoughts and a myriad of others ran through my mind with the lightness of a
feather.

&nbsp;

He stroked the inside of my thigh, lightly rubbing the secret mark
of his ownership.� Suddenly, the
wooziness was suddenly gone as I smiled to myself and thought about the ginger
finger I'd carved for tonight.� Even for
us, it was an exceedingly large one and it was chilling in the refrigerator at
this very moment.� It was the
anticipation that made things so sweet; I knew as well as he that several
exhausting hours in the White Room lay just ahead of both us tonight.� But this time, it was his turn to take the
long burning ride.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

Rasha twisted to face me and braced herself on an elbow.� Her pudenda had darkened with engorged blood
and acted as a counterweight to her blondness as it emerged from between her
thighs.� Moist and glistening in the
lamplight, her guarded flesh had swollen to show a pink-gray sliver, a
rooster's comb on a hen.� She had become
incredibly wet in anticipation of the night's activities, and spillage glazed
the tops of her thighs, leaving sticky, high trails to their source.� Her breasts piled below the rigor of her
shoulders, uncharacteristically heavy at this angle.� When allowed to be herself, she was always
crisp, almost prim in public; but she was shameless in the managed light of the
living room.....a delight to me and to herself.�
Sometimes I liked her best without perfume, a day unwashed and sexed
out, with good music in the background.�
Other times, like now, when she was a perfumed beauty, prepared to
accept anything I desired in an unending attempt to satisfy my driving needs.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

It was time.� I stood
holding his hand, then started towards the refrigerator, but he shook his head,
�No.� Not tonight.�� 

&nbsp;

Well then, tomorrow night instead.�
Tonight would be just as good without it.� Holding his hand, I led him with anticipation
towards the White Room.� Tonight would be
better than good, I would make sure it was memorable.� We entered the room together, but it really
only began for me.� Master quickly tired
of his nipple clamps for once, and for this I gave thanks.� Even with me, he tended to use them with too
rough an abandon.� Other things were put
on and taken off, but it didn't seem like he'd entered tonight with his normal
full enthusiasm for working my body.�
Well, if he seemed a little tired tonight, I would wake him up.� 

&nbsp;

We'd finally finished, I ached as we walked into our bedroom, but
that was only what I'd expected.� He
pulled me to the side, towards our bed.

&nbsp;

�Tonight,� he said, �tonight, we stay here.�� I looked at him uncertainly for a second,
then smiled.� He was in an odd mood, but
I would bring him out of it.� I knew what
he needed now, I knew what he liked.�
Soon I had him naked on his back on the bed.� I knelt on the floor to the side and my mouth
caressed his body, moving in light touches from his nipples to between his
legs.� Taking the long route drove him
crazy and set up the perfect ending at the same time.� 

&nbsp;

Soon my Master was hard and rigid and ready.� Anymore and he would pour into my mouth
instead of my body.� I was hot too and
the smell of aroused female filled the air around our bed.� I needed to feel him tonight and soon we both
were ready.� I still wore my heels, so
had to be careful as I climbed into bed with him.� I straddled him as I slowly stroked his
erection.� He groaned in response and I
leaned forward, my lips only inches from his.�
I had finally screwed up enough courage to ask him.

&nbsp;

�Have you ever wondered?� 

&nbsp;

�What?� he said.

&nbsp;

�You know,� I answered.�
�Why it was me.� Why it had to be
me.�

&nbsp;

�I don't know.�

&nbsp;

�Before you took me.� When
you first saw me, did you ever wonder.�
Would I be good enough?� Did you
wonder what my skin felt like to touch that first day at the restaurant?� How I tasted?�
Here.�� I kissed him, tracing the
tip of his tongue with mine.� �And
there,� I touched the tip of my breast.�
�And here?� I put my hand between our bellies as I touched myself
between my legs.

&nbsp;

�Yes,� he said.� �I wondered
about all those things.�

&nbsp;

�Please tell me, don't make me beg for this too.� Was I worth it?� Was I worth the effort?� Am I good enough for you?�

&nbsp;

�Rasha, you have always been worth the effort.� You just didn't know how to value yourself.�

&nbsp;

�Good,� I said as I sank into him and he into me.� �I want to be good for you.�� 

&nbsp;

I gave a belly deep groan of
sweet appreciation at the sensation of my vagina being filled to over-flowing,
my sound echoed around the room.� My
knees were spread wide to ride his pole and my groin felt fully exposed as I
indulged him, the bedsprings squeaking as my thighs struggled to stretch wide
enough to accept him.� I rocked back and
forth, up and down on his pelvis, accepting everything male he offered inside
me.� 

&nbsp;

This was a special night
for him.� I could tell by way managed
every part of my body that night; it was his night to prove that I needed him
more than anything else in my life.� I could
feel it in the way he held me, the way he concentrated on each part of my body
as though no one else had ever entered this strange land before and only he
knew the way.� I sensed his emotions
building and tried to slow him down, but his need overpowered both of us.� His hands were first on my buttocks, grabbing
the firm muscle and holding handfuls like melons in a store as he pulled me
onto him again and again.� From there, his
hands wandered to my chest, pulling me down until my breasts were in his face
and my pierced nipples filled his mouth.�
He sucked and I moaned again and again.�
Soon, too soon, it was over and I lay upon him, covered with sweat and
trying to catch my breath.� 

&nbsp;

I rolled off of him and lay
in his arms.� The insides of my thighs were
wet with sweat and sticky with my love juice and his.� We weren't yet done, and he would be doing
the work next.� I leaned over his waist
and felt a throbbing need to make contact with his skin.� I licked the inside of his thigh and slowly
let my tongue trail up his leg.� My
Master laughed and used his hands to perfectly place my face, moving forward
and lifting his hips so that his balls were under my mouth.� I eagerly took him like that, moaning softly
as I did.� But he laughed delightedly as
the sound came out more like a gargle when my mouth was filled like this.� I know my moans had turned him on because I
could hear his grunts as I continued tonguing his sack.� The blood was whooshing in my ears and it was
all I could feel, all I knew was him and his body on the bed.� 

&nbsp;

Like the team we were, I
silently tilted my head back and closed my eyes.� I opened my throat in anticipation just as he
pulled out and turned, slipping his cock inside me.� I could taste my drying pussy juice on his
cock.� My lips closed as he began to
mouth-fuck me and I timed my breathing to his long strokes.� There were wet sucking noises, but no gagging
even though he drove deeply into me.� I
was so used to this by now.� His hands
were on my breasts and I felt him pinching my nipples.� The intense sensations that in the past I
would have called pain made my back arch involuntarily and my mouth tighten
around his now huge erection.� The
pinching began to get harder and suddenly, he was tugging on my nipple
rings.� It was true that pierced nipples
are so much more sensitive to the touch of another than are the unpierced.� Then, it was time again.

&nbsp;

I moved him to the side, carefully using his rigid bar as a love
handle to guide him.� I needed to focus
on what came next, wanted to feel this in every way so I used little
lubricant.� This was what I wanted, I
thought to myself as I got on my hands and knees.� I looked over my shoulder at him and smiled
with love.� I inhaled and kept it.� My lungs were filled with air, but I faced
the mattress now and my mouth hung silently open, whether waiting to express
impending pain or ecstasy, I honestly wouldn't know until the moment
arrived.� Silently I waited with bated
breath as the air slowly turned stale in my lungs. 

&nbsp;

And then he was in me in one steady move of his hips and I grunted
deep in my belly in response, the massive meat he brought to our bed filling me
to the brim.� I felt his weight on top of
me and the insistent rhythm inside me; I closed my eyes and used this sweetest
of memories to guide me home.� It was
like this every time; muscles that weren't meant to be stretched in this way,
but which had been stretched by him like this a hundred times before.� The uncomfortable feelings at first of
stretching and extension, distension and fullness, the internal muscles
stretched to the maximum, then pushed open one tiny centimeter more as it felt
like he probed deep enough in my rectum now to displace the organs in my
abdomen.� 

&nbsp;

It all overwhelmed me and my breath was driven out of me in that one
massive lunge.� I groaned in both pain
and wonder as I always did at the beginning.�
But it got better, much better as he first got what he wanted; I backed
into him, pushing my wiggling butt into his groin and squeezing my muscles
around him as he gave me circular lunges with his hips.� And then everything got tremendously even
more better as I took what I needed, clamping onto him and holding my breath as
wave after wave of sensations crashed through my body.� 

&nbsp;

I was suddenly aware that I was screaming, �Fuck me, split me,
tear me, you bastard.�� His right hand
remained on my hip to act as a guide, while his left was under me, supporting
my belly and massaging my clit.� He had
to be careful, touching my clit was always enough to take me to the edge, then
quickly push me over.� But we both wanted
this to last and he was careful to not touch me like that too much.

&nbsp;

It was pure animal domination now and I had submitted to my
dominator---allowing him---no needing him to do his best to drive me into the
mattress.� I wanted this now; I needed
this, I loved this.� He had been right
all along, I had learned to like it his way.�
We both grunted and groaned, crying out in erotic ecstasy, each gasping
for air in our own world of wondrous rapture.�
I grabbed him, let go, grabbed him again.� He in turn, drove into me with the need of
thousand men, as if each were trying to prove that he alone had the right to
dominate me this way.� He slammed into me
again and I clenched one last time, grabbing him once more like all the times
before, but not letting go this time.�
Being filled like this felt wonderful to my vagina too and I knew I was
cumming; I couldn't have stopped myself from having a huge orgasm even if my
life depended upon it.� But even better,
as usual my locking his member deep inside me drove him into a sexual
frenzy.� His hips slammed into my
buttocks again and again and again like a love machine made of steel as he
pulled free from my grasping muscles, but always returning to drive his love
home one more time.� 

&nbsp;

He semen came now, jetting out and exploding like a bomb inside
me.� Then there were more scalding hot
spurts, everything joining at the end into a massive lava-like tidal wave of
heat that washed over everything ahead of it and left me coated thickly on the
inside with his love.� At the end, I kept
him locked inside me as I finished cumming, letting out one small scream after
another.� I experienced my small death
for the hundredth or perhaps the thousandth time as I crouched, dominated and
used as I so desired beneath my Master.�
I milked him for every drop, feeling the heat of his liquid essence
slowly fade inside me as I ground my hips and buttocks against his groin,
slowly, provocatively, always ensuring that he knew I wasn't yet done with him
tonight.� 

&nbsp;

We lay next to each other, slick with a sweat that was slowly
cooling under the lazy ceiling fan.� I
couldn't help myself, I found myself crying as I stroked Master softly.� He looked at me silently, intensely.� Then he held his arms out and I crashed
against his chest, my head next to his hammering heart.� 

&nbsp;

We took each other once more after that, but this time slowly,
wondrously, as we explored each other's bodies over and over again.� For the first time, he'd attached short dog
leashes to each nipple ring, then tied them together in back as I was on my
hands and knees.� Master used these
leashes as reins to guide me, controlling my every move, backwards and
forwards, side to side, up and down, with only a light tug on each leash.� I wasn't embarrassed or humiliated, only
thankful for the pleasure of a new experience; able now to anticipate his every
desire with only the softest of pulls in a wordless dance of ecstasy.� For I had months ago learned that he would
never ask for more than I could give....and he had taught me to give a lot.

&nbsp;

It was late and almost time to sleep.� I'd wiped myself clean of his multiple gifts
and now sat with my back against pillows that leaned on the headboard.� I'd taken my heels off and my legs were
spread wide.� He lay between my thighs
with his head on a pillow that rested in my lap; I rubbed his temples where it
sometimes hurt him so much.� I'd been
doing this for almost an hour now; he so loved being touched by me in this way.� We were slowly working our way through a
second bottle of wine and I felt a slight buzzing sensation behind my
eyes.� Master got up and re-filled our
glasses one last time.� I really didn't
want any more, but sipped to please the man to whom I owed everything good in
my life.

&nbsp;

I felt relaxed, oddly relaxed.�
In fact, I felt odd, more and more as if I were in a vortex.� He lay between my legs and I continued
rubbing his head.� As the seconds passed,
I felt less connected to my body and it seemed that I was sucked deeper and
deeper into the water.� It was only the
touch of his body against mine that kept me anchored; my Master, the man I
loved so much.� I finally looked up from
deep within the whirlpool and could barely see the night sky against the
ocean's surface.� And then without
warning, everything dissolved into nothing as I slipped beneath the surface of
cold black water. 

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I sat on one of the steps out back as I swung the sapphire
bracelet by one end and let the sun catch the blue stones.� I thought about how at the end of the first stage
of training, I'd left Rasha in nothing but pyschodynamic ruins; the terribly
bruised interior landscape I'd opened up by peeling her back one layer at a
time, like bandaging that had gone septic and stiffened into the flesh beneath.� And how at the core, there was the tightly
wired disorderedness that had allowed her to survive the damage in her life and
to fight me for so long.� But I'd
eventually taken this coiled kernel for my own.�
She'd wept when I'd done these things to her, but she cried wide-eyed at
the end, like someone fighting the weight of drowsiness, blinking the tears out
of her eyes, hands clenched into fists at her side, teeth gritted.

&nbsp;

I thought about what I'd done to her over the last half year.� I was good at what I did.� My intuition about people rarely failed
me.� There were systems in my mind and
body of which I was not even aware that measured women like her at some
unconscious level.� Then these mental programs
managed to somehow get this message through all the super-ego programming and
baggage I carried around.� My military
training had taken this natural ability and refined it so that I made
connections and assembled models of what would be for each of them, the
ultimate self-truth, the final journey into womanhood.� I hadn't just had faith I could re-make this
woman; for me it had been knowledge.�
There was a big difference between the two.� Just as there was a big difference between
wanting something and having it and taking responsibility for it.

&nbsp;

Through my discipline and training, Rasha had been forced to
accept profound psychological changes over the past months.� Her view of the world now and her place in it
was so much larger, and smaller, at the same time.� Always before, even as a married woman she'd
been the beautiful heart-breaker that played the field, arrogantly using and
then discarding men at will.� But that
had changed after I'd forced her to investigate the incredible synchronicity of
her hidden needs and mine.� I had
shrunken her world to the limits of her body, the only things of permanence I'd
left Rasha had been her slave collar and brand, and the metal that pierced her
flesh.� Everything else she'd known and
accepted as normal had been withheld, then a few small pleasures and
insignificant freedoms doled out slowly as she more and more accepted her
reduced significance in this new world.�
No longer allowed the spoiled luxury of acting the self-righteous
feminist or ill-natured, self-entitled bitch, more deeply than anything else,
my woman had been inevitably reduced to the point where she could finally admit
to the world that she needed a man as her master.

&nbsp;

This was a woman that now desperately wanted, desperately needed
to give all responsibility and accountability in her life to a man.� She wasn't a woman that wanted to please or
taunt multiple men now, rather she craved one man that could give her
everything her body and mind had recently been trained to desire.� To be protected by him from everything bad
that could happen to a woman of her status, but still a man whom she could
respect.� A man who was willing and
capable of satisfying the needs that had always been there, but which had been
until recently unrecognized, let alone fulfilled.� I'd brought her to this point and as she saw
these qualities in me, she couldn't stop herself from offering everything that
a woman in her position possessed, if only I could find it in myself to love
her the way she loved me.

&nbsp;

It was her beauty that had first attracted me.� But I finally realized that all things of
great beauty in the world, from beautiful women to great works of art, suffer
the unstoppable effects of the passage of time.�
Their world begins the moment that life is breathed into them, whether
or not they are aware of how much in harmony they might be with the
infinite.� Then the human creator adds
the finishing touches, or the parents train their daughters in how to face the
world with their gift---or handicap.� And
when finished, each surrenders to the world what they have created.� While time bestows on the inanimate objects a
new type of beauty of which human aging could never dream, it withers and
destroys us.� 

&nbsp;

I didn't want to grow old with her.� I had known it would come to this
eventually.� I was incapable of
love.� I had enjoyed her, took what she had
to offer.� It was the sort of thing that
was nice to a guy like me, but I had known from the beginning that it could
never last.� Not nearly for long enough.� I thought about how complicated it all had
become.� I'd cursed myself a thousand
times over when the lust arose, heady and unstoppable.� It wasn�t the need or desire I felt for her
that had frightened me.� It was the other
feelings that she brought alive in me.� I
didn't want any of these things from her, I really didn't.� 

&nbsp;

I knew that I could have said no to her at a thousand times, but I
never had.� My will was stronger than my
instincts most of the time, but not with her.�
She'd made me weak and what she wanted from me only made me weaker.� In the end, I needed to control the lust
because of her, but it still felt so damned good to let it control me.� The savage desire to force my needs on her
over and over again vibrated through every nerve.� All I knew was that if she called what I did
to her love, then she'd been whoring half her life.� 

&nbsp;

I'd turned from her a gorgeous woman who occasionally fucked a man
when she wanted, to a beautiful woman who lived to be fucked in any servile way
I could invent for her, and she'd fuck me with pleasure for as long as I could
get it up.� I'd wanted a woman that would
fight me for everything that I tried to take from her.� And she had in the beginning---but only in
the beginning.� At the end, I'd realized
I needed a woman that was as strong as me, and just as needy.� I'd wanted a woman to keep, not a virtual wife.� But Rasha was weaker now, her strength gone,
taken along with everything else that had made her so desirable.� 

&nbsp;

Although subservient in every way that pleased me, she still
remained a woman with the needs most women have.� She wanted one man, a man of her own, a man
that could love her.� And to her, I had
assumed that mythic position in her world. 

&nbsp;

Always a confident woman, I could tell that she now assumed not
only that her position and status somehow allowed her minor input into our
daily lives, but even more, that I wanted her in my life that way.� She was persistent in her attempts to include
me in this warm world she was trying to create, driven solely by her obvious
love for me and her need for my affection and approval.� Even as I routinely disabused her of these
notions with belt and rope, whip and wood and steel, she continued to love me
as my partner, not as my slave.� For her,
I think she was in the best of all possible worlds; having an opportunity to
explore her sexuality in ways and lengths she had never before dreamed
possible, as well as living the fiction of maintaining a serious, long-term,
monogamous relationship with a man she felt cared for her.� 

&nbsp;

I had a subservient wife in everything but name, and this was
exactly what I didn't want.

&nbsp;

I knew that I needed to escape the ugliness of what I really was;
the temporary escapes through the temporary women, generally taken against
their will, but all used to sate my desires for no more than a single
night.� But even though none of them had
ever lasted like she had, I'd always known in my heart that she too had been a
temporary woman.

&nbsp;

Rasha was wrong in her feelings about us.� There could be no love here, no
tenderness---I didn't need it, I wouldn't allow it.� When I found myself with her as she willingly
submitted to my basest needs, anticipation and the need to cause her even
greater pain had flowed like lava within me even as I fought to bring it under
control.� It wasn't the need to inflict
pain that was the problem, it was the lack of control.� I'd tried to find the strength to pull away
from her, but the lure of what she filled me with, what she allowed me to do to
her day after day was too strong.� My
desire, my need to dominate and hurt another was ingrained too deeply.� It was what I was.� But even as I understood what I was and what
I was doing, I always wanted still more from this woman, taking her deeper and
forcing her into evermore darker corners of her mind.�� Until I felt disgust with her weaknesses,
rather than affection for what made her her.

&nbsp;

I'd taken everything from Rasha, convincing her that the more she
gave me, the more proof it was of her devotion and love.� In the end, she'd became flushed with total
acceptance, finding worth in everything I wanted, everything I demanded.� Months of indulgence had followed, and I
found that the more dominating I was, the more satisfaction I craved and the
less I found.� She would have burned up
first, consumed by the fires inside me.�
Then I would have followed, like a piece of small rock burning to ashes
upon re-entry.� Her beauty was not enough
to satisfy me anymore, not enough to keep me.

&nbsp;

The memory of being unable to stop myself with her still resounded
inside me; the lure of her body and her defenselessness still
irresistible.� In the end, saying no to
my needs had been impossible.� It had
been hard, but inside I felt good about my decision in a melancholy way.� It wasn't the glorious shock of ecstasy, but
more like a sunbeam, unnoticed when you first found it, but its warmth growing
until you felt.....good. 

&nbsp;

And so I did it in self-defense.�
She was gone.� Sold to a slaver. 

&nbsp;

EPILOGUE

&nbsp;

I awoke on a boat.� It was
night and the boat was making good speed as it slammed into three or four
foot-high waves.� I felt nauseous and had
a blinding headache.� What had
happ............Master had done this to me!�
Shock blanked my mind.� I.....I
didn't know what to think.�� I leaned my
head against a metal pole and did nothing, felt nothing.� I sat motionless, stunned.� I felt numb and my mind was suddenly blank as
the implications of what he'd done hit me with the impact of hammer blows.� He didn't want me....he didn't love me.� The emotional changes he'd forced me to accept
the first couple of months had made me a psychological wreck.� I had cried all the time, filled with rage
towards him at first and then self-loathing, consumed by psychosomatic aches
and illnesses.� Even though he had
already possessed my body, only at the end had I finally trusted him enough to
truly let him into my life, then finally love him with all my heart.� At that point, I had allowed him to possess
me totally.� 

&nbsp;

Suddenly, helplessly, I started crying as I realized how it would
just start all over again.� The man I had
loved had betrayed me.� Because of him, I
was a ruined woman, a slave, one of America's �disappeared.�� No one cared what happened to women like me,
certainly not men like him.� We were
taken, then used and finally discarded, only to have it start all over
again.� This life of being bought and
sold, of continually being forced to both serve and service unknown men, men
who would never want to know me, of men raping and sodomizing and torturing
me---this life would never end, not for the likes of me.� Not until I was dead or so old that no man
would want me.� Being without men sounded
wonderful, but what would I do, how would I live then?

&nbsp;

I must have cried for two hours.�
Unthinking, senseless, hopeless tears.�
Finally, I was cried out.� My neck
was chafed from the tight collar I wore.�
I was sure that Master had dismissed me from his life wearing his
two-inch wide thick leather punishment collar that I had seen hanging on one of
the walls in the White Room.� I leaned
against the pole with my eyes closes, my mind empty.� I was blank for a long time, not brave enough
to think what might have happened.� The
truth was that there was no fight left in me anymore, but I had to be strong. I
accepted everything now, why struggle when this was what my fate was meant to
be.� Finally, I shook myself and looked
around. �I felt empty inside, but still
needed to see.

&nbsp;

There was a crew of three and a fourth that must have been the
captain.� I couldn�t make out their faces
for all was a blur in the darkness.� I
got the impression of disciplined men as I watched them moving around the deck,
doing various jobs at the command of the boat�s Master.� I was sitting with my face up against some
kind of mast and facing forward, in what looked like a three foot deep well on
the top of the boat.� There was some kind
of metal and wood cover over me and I could not be seen unless I craned my neck
in an awkward position in order to peer out.�
My legs were wrapped around the pole, my ankles bound together on the
opposite side.� My arms went around the
outside of my thighs and my wrists were tied together underneath my legs
forcing my face against the pole.� I was
helpless.

&nbsp;

As hard as it was, I tried to remain calm, taking deep breaths and
talking to myself.� But it was all
useless babble.� I wouldn't allow myself
to think about anything, let alone my fate.�
Nothing had happened to me yet, but somewhere deep, deep inside, I knew
it was to the pleasure of men and the delight of
their souls that I would be forever offered.�


&nbsp;

I suddenly realized that on
the day that what my Master had done to me stopped gnawing at my soul and
instead become pleasurable; when my hands had finally stopped feeling cold at
what I accepted from him and I truly began demanding it of him for the first
time, maybe that was the day that I'd finally accepted whatever my new life
might bring.� I knew I couldn't step away
from this life now even if I had the chance.�
And I'd also known somehow that it wouldn't always offer blissful
happiness.� But I'd thought I would be
with him.........I
had to stop thinking like this.� Thinking
about this, and him, led to madness.�
Instead of worrying about something over which I had no control, I
forced myself to furtively watch the crew even though my head barely came up
high enough to see them.� 

&nbsp;

The night was dark and the sea breeze was cool in my hair and on
my face even though where I sat was protected from most of the wind.� I felt chilled.� I could see that I was dressed in my tight
blue jean cutoffs, the lowrider ones that were cut so high up on my hips that I
may as well have been wearing nothing at all.�
A bright red loose, off-the-shoulder top completed my ensemble.� There was no gag in my mouth, but that really
didn't matter since there was no one around other than the crew to hear
me.� I knew intimately the feel of chains
tightly binding my breast rings, and had that feeling now.� Other than that, I could feel my breasts
swinging free beneath the loose blouse with each motion of the boat and if I
knew my Master, I would bet money that I wore no underwear too.� My nipples were erect from the cold and
exquisitely sensitive from rubbing against my blouse for so long.� I blinked back tears.

&nbsp;

It felt like I had acquired a bruise somehow---as if I'd been
wrestling or something.� My left elbow
felt scraped and my stomach ached.� There
was a sensitive spot on my belly just below my navel, perhaps a nervous
rash.� Unfortunately, it lay exactly
where the top of my cutoffs buttoned and this tormented me every time I moved;
my cutoffs rubbed against this area, making me even more miserable.� Worse, it felt like there was a matching rash
on my rear.� All in all, I was miserable.


&nbsp;

Suddenly, I couldn�t stop the tears.� I must be a terrible person, worthless.� I must be no good.� No one wanted me.� I was like so many others that I knew had
disappeared without a trace.� And I knew
now that I deserved no less.� My life, my
fate, everything had been sealed years ago by the vile things I had done.� And now I was paying the price.� Shuffled out of the deck of life, like a card
thrown under the table.� 

&nbsp;

God!� Master, why have you
done this?� You�d opened the gates of
paradise for me, and I wouldn�t have rested until I followed you through.� By the end of our time together, by the time
you finished with me, I�d have willingly followed you into any fire that God
ever lit.� Why?

&nbsp;

I knew I'd made a mistake allowing myself to care for him and he'd
ended my world as a result.� He'd been a
wonderful lover, but I knew now that he had no honor, no code.� But somehow, still I cared for him.� There would never be another lover like him;
I wouldn't allow it.� It could only end
badly when you allowed someone to get too close.� I'd had too much pride and had paid the
price; now it was back of the bus and everyone took care of themselves.� Never again.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

The boat must
have traveled for at least another hour before it drew into a small deserted
dock that needed repair.� Lingering
patches of early morning sea fog quickly blanked out vision after only a few
yards.� Only one weak bulb was lit at the
end of the dock, barely enough to allow the boat�s Master to see.� Even so, he did an expert job of
docking.� Two members of the crew jumped
onto the dock and began carrying cans of fuel inboard.

&nbsp;

Five minutes
later I watched as the shapes of three people materialized from within the
mist.� Two burly men with a slight figure
between them.� As they got closer, I
could see the two black men that carried the slight figure of a young girl
between them.� Her feet barely touched
the wood of the dock as they dragged her up the dock to where they were met by
the four men from the boat.� 

&nbsp;

As they
stood under the single light, I had a good view of them all.� She wore her light brown hair long and parted
in the middle; she looked barely seventeen years old.� There was a gag in her mouth and she was
crying softly.� Her hands were bound
behind her back and she was bare legged, wearing only a short soft-pink skirt
that came to within three inches of her knees and a tight white top.� On her feet, the teenager wore pink strappy
wedgies with three inch heels that were covered with hemp rope; the kind of
cheap shoes that could be purchased at any Target store and which had
satiny-looking straps that wound two-thirds of the way up her calves before
they were tied in back.�� 

&nbsp;

She looked
scared to death.� With cheap jewelry and
her makeup smeared from crying, it seemed she was clearly what she appeared to
be.� A lower-class teenager that had been
kidnapped from a party or get-together.� 

&nbsp;

But even as
scared as she obviously was, her face still seemed to glow with an angelic
innocence.� This was not one of the
experienced hard-faced slutty teenage girls with whom I was so familiar from
having been a teacher.� Rather this was one
that those girls would have mocked.� It
seemed to me that this little girl looked like she belonged to that
disappearing group of young women that everyone agreed represented the best of
the old fashioned values.

&nbsp;

She stood
for a minute by herself as her captors met the man who'd just bought her.� Even in her fear, she moved with an
unconscious feminine grace that would be intensely erotic to any man that might
see it.� Her hair was thick, maintaining
its body even in the moist night air.�
She had a long graceful neck, tiny waist and long, shapely legs that
tapered to slender ankles; the young girl was beautiful in an unfinished sort
of way.� Just by looking at her, you knew
that she was one of those rare young women that while she was beautiful in her
youth, she would become even more beautiful as she matured.� 

&nbsp;

The Master
of the boat stepped into the light and faced me as he counted out money and
handed it to the men that had delivered their captive.� I gasped as I saw his face for the first
time.� He must have heard something for
he turned towards me even as I hurriedly shrunk back down against the metal
pole, hiding my face in the comforting darkness.� The Master was a huge black man.� One side of his face was normal, even
handsome.� But the other side was
disfigured and had a terrible tattoo---something that looked both dark and
threatening.

&nbsp;

I could hear
them talking and though I missed some of what they said, it was obvious that
they'd kidnapped the girl from over a hundred miles up the coast and they felt
that no one would be looking for her down here.�
The captain had a good feel for the Coast Guard schedules and had
apparently paid someone off, for between this and his camouflage as the wealthy
owner of a boat that he liked to take out for deep water fishing, he seemed to
have no fear of being caught.� 

&nbsp;

After a
moment, I looked again at the dock.� He
was gone, but I saw two of his crewmen drag the unresisting girl inboard in the
back and apparently inside the boat's cabin below.� Quickly, the remaining member of the crew
untied the two lines that secured the boat to the dock and jumped back on
board.� Suddenly, the engines of the boat
revved up and it began to move away from the dock.� Two figures, neither of which was the boat�s
Master, moved around the deck near me.�
Given the timing, I knew that the third crewman must be piloting the
boat, leaving only the Master unaccounted for.�


&nbsp;

I suddenly
heard the soft buzz of a voice coming from down below.� It must have gone on for at least ten
minutes, then suddenly I heard what could only have been a muffled scream from
the girl.� It was a high-pitched, yet
oddly heavy sound that came from deep within her soul and rocketed out from
inside the boat.� The gag muffled her in
such a way that her scream carried only a short distance over the wet night air
before dying completely.� It was clear
that these men had done this before.� Her
muffled, cadenced screams continued to emanate from below for at least half an
hour.� Sometimes a scream would break off
in mid-pitch, other times it would drag on for at least a minute.� I found myself crying; great wracking sobs
that tore me apart.� I deserved
everything these men did to me.� But not
her.� She was too young, too pure yet to have
earned this terrible thing. 

&nbsp;

Finally,
there was silence.� Shortly thereafter,
the boat�s Master appeared on deck and said, �She�s yours for now.�� The three men eagerly left and within a
minute, I heard men�s laughter from below.�
Suddenly, she was screaming again, the sounds drowned out by men
laughing at something they found hilarious.�
More laughter and a final scream that was cut-off in mid-voice.� Then silence for at least ten minutes, which
was only interrupted by the faint sound of something that I recognized
immediately, a belt hitting soft flesh.�
Suddenly, the men started laughing again, but I never heard her scream
again.

&nbsp;

Night became
day and the boat went on for two or three hours in the daylight.� It then stopped and fishing lines were thrown
overboard.� We were camouflaged as a
private yacht whose owner was just out fishing in deep water.

&nbsp;

One of the crew
came up and looked at me speculatively for about a minute and I just knew that
rape was immanent.� But he eventually
untied my hands so that I could drink from a cup of water and eat a cold egg
sandwich.� I shivered all over as I tried
to ignore the implications of his behavior, but my mind kept coming back to how
helpless they were keeping me.� I was so
afraid of the unknown that I just curled into as much of a ball as I could and
pulled my life in around me.� But around
noon, my bladder began to kill me.� I had
to beg over and over to use the bathroom, and finally got one of the men's
attention.� Two men came up and untied my
wrists and ankles, but one of them had to help me stand.� I hadn't known it at the time, but I found
that I was wearing a pair of flat-soled sandals.� 

&nbsp;

My arms were
numb and my legs felt as if they were made of rubber, as if they'd never be
able to support me again.� I trembled
uncontrollably from head to toe.� My
heart was beating wildly and I felt like I really needed to throw up.� There was a breeze, but I was sweating
profusely.� I closed my eyes, but the
light from the overhead sun was still blinding as it screamed through my
eyelids.� 

&nbsp;

I have never
been a boat person, so please excuse that lack of experience in my descriptions.� Now that I was standing, I could see that the
boat looked like it was about fifty feet long, perhaps more.� It had sort of covered veranda on the back
with a few chairs along each side.� The
steps in back led first down to a largish kind of setting room, then the
galley, then to two smaller berths, one on each side of aisle and the toilet
was at the end.� As they took me to the
head, I had to walk by the cabin on the right in which they'd stored the young
girl.� I looked in at her with immense
pity.� 

&nbsp;

Except for
her sandals, she lay naked on what looked like a double-sized bed, facing away
from me towards the side of the boat.�
The girl had curled into a fetal ball, bound wrists clenched between her
thighs and around her tears and pain.�
Her body was firm and smooth and youthful looking from the back.� She had been whipped on her buttocks and
lower back, and only the end of a giant black rubber plug was visible, since
the main part had already been inserted inside her rectum.� The insides and back of her thighs were
covered with a thin film of what must have been dried blood and she lay in a
hip-wide pool of what I assumed was dried semen that stained the sheet upon
which she rested.� I wanted to be strong
for her.� I leaned forward to say
something comforting, but my captor pushed me hard in the back towards the
toilet.� I couldn't tell her that it
would be okay, that she would recover from this too.� That life had dealt her a shitty hand, and
that like me, she also had to play it out.

&nbsp;

He left the
door open as I slowly pulled my shorts down and did what I had to do.� He wasn't paying attention to me right now
and for once, I had a moment to myself.�
After I'd finished but before I pulled my cutoffs back up again, I
pulled my top up a little to look at was so irritating to my lower belly.� In shock, I gazed at a small fist that had
been tattooed onto my belly just above my hairless vagina.� It was done in white, but had exquisite
detail shown in black.� My mind was blank
as I looked at this thing for almost a minute, then comprehension widened my
eyes as I whirled to look at my back in the mirror.� A small black hand had been tattooed there
just above the crack of my butt, but all detail with this one was done in white.� I would never wear a bikini bottom or thong
again without flaunting irrefutable evidence to the world of having been fisted
front and back.� 

&nbsp;

Time seemed
to fly by at the speed of light, yet it took an eternity as the seconds dragged
slowly by one after another.� I heard the
others enter the cabin and knew I had to move, yet my mind whirled in absolute
incomprehension and my feet refused to move.�
Why was this happening to me?� Why
had my Master forsaken me like this?�
What would happen next?� Who could
I turn to now?� Would I ever find someone
that would care for ME?� Would I ever be
free of this nightmare?� Would I see true
freedom ever again?� Finally, I heard the
buzz of men conversing outside in the aisle.�
I hurriedly finished getting my cutoff's zipped and snapped and walked
out on my own.� 

&nbsp;

When I came
out of the bathroom, I saw that two of the men had forced the young girl onto
her back, then tied her bound hands to the head of the bed and stretched her
legs out towards the foot of the bed.�
She'd been gagged and her ankles were tied far apart; the men were in
the process of removing her sandals.�
Suddenly, one of the them reached over to his side and pulled out a
thick flat piece of wood that was shaped like a ping-pong paddle with holes
drilled in it, only larger.� He literally
sat on her shin to pin her foot, then squared off and hit the bare bottom of
her left foot hard with the paddle.� The
poor young thing arched her back and bucked helplessly, screaming into her gag
in agony.� But it had only started for
her as the second man joined the first in hitting the girl's feet.� I started crying, but was quickly dragged out
of the cabin to the back of the boat.�
But the muted sound of paddles hitting flesh and muffled screams didn't
leave my ears for hours and hours.

&nbsp;

I spent what
seemed interminable hours on the back of the boat undergoing my own training
and discipline before they took me back to my little hideaway.� There were no thoughts in my head as I was
returned, none.� My legs still felt like
rubber and barely worked.� My mind had
been blanked by what I'd just experienced.�
But the young girl's occasional muted screams never left me, never
allowed me any piece.� It was awful.

&nbsp;

Regardless
of how we female passengers might have felt, the boat continued its journey
later in the day.� It once made a quick
stop near a deserted beach and used an inflatable dinghy to pick up more fuel,
then it went back to cruising at least fifteen miles offshore.� I was hungry, but wasn't fed again.

&nbsp;

Eventually
we stopped in the early evening at another dock, but this time it seemed as if
we had tied off at an island rather than the mainland.� The smell of pine or spruce from the island
was strong, mixing wonderfully with the ocean air.� One of the crew tied the boat to the dock
while two others untied my bonds and led me off the boat.� I squared my shoulders and tried to show a
confidence I didn't feel.� I hadn't been
hurt too badly so far, perhaps this wouldn't as bad as I had imagined.� Perhaps when he rid himself of me, my Master
had at least ensured that I would find myself in a better place than I had just
left.� 

&nbsp;

This dock
was well built with a tightly fit wood surface which left few gaps.� It was much better lit than the previous one
and I could walk without too much difficulty.�
I saw our boat's Master as he jumped lightly to the dock to meet a
waiting figure.� There were a couple of
lights near the end of the dock and I could see both men clearly this
time.� 

&nbsp;

I watched the captain closely.�
The master of the boat was a huge man, massive in a way that made me
think his whole body was made of lead and iron.�
He possessed that special something that which caused some people to
stick out in a crowd.� His eyebrows were
as black as a raven.� His dark eyes had a
fiery intensity and were set beneath a heavy brow which gave him an aura of
brooding intensity.� One side of his face
was roughly handsome, the other side damaged, his skin eerily smooth, like a
mirror, like water.� Yet it was also
rough and pitted with unnatural angles, the skin tightly covering deeply angled
indentations.� It was this side that was
embroidered with the most fantastic tattoo.�
Yet from time to time, he would chuckle and even laugh, and he seemed
mostly considerate.� This was a scary
man, a born dominant.� He behaved as if
we were on an outing, as if there were nothing odd about having two kidnapped
women on his boat.

&nbsp;

Aside from that indefinable charisma, he was a handsome man with
thick black hair, flashing brown eyes and perfect teeth.� If he had a flaw at all besides the damage
that had been done to his face, it was his hawk-like nose.� But even that worked to his advantage,
granting him a definite predatory air.

&nbsp;

Who was this man with the serious eyes and strange tattoo?� I watched the way he commanded everyone's
attention, the obvious intelligence in his eyes......the quiet strength in his
body.� I caught myself.� No, damn it, no!� How could I?

&nbsp;

He looked skyward, rubbed
his eyes and appeared to enjoy the damp evening air.� We lingered on the dock even as it misted
rain off and on.� 

&nbsp;

The man that met us on the
dock was a handsome man, slim and long limbed.�
He wore his kinky black hair short and flat on top.� He had glossy black skin, high cheekbones and
an expressive mouth which at the moment was formed into a hard thin line. �I could hear the two talk.� He spoke like an educated man that had been
taught someplace other than the U. S. and conversed with the boat captain as if
an equal, with a confidence and ease borne of long familiarity....another
obvious dominant.� Both acted as if I
weren�t there, and after a couple of minute�s preliminary negotiations, my sale
began.� Even as the other man began, I
knew I had no choice but to continue watching the captain of the boat closely
or I'd be severely punished.

&nbsp;

With one quick move, the
new man pulled my top down over my shoulders to expose my breasts.� I froze in disbelief.� His black eyes gleamed as he looked at my
piercings, then he cupped my breasts for a second and played with the rings and
chain that Master had given me so many months ago.� He ended the massage with a soft milking
motion on each breast that left my nipples engorged and sticking out.� My head was bowed and I never looked at him
as he did this, for I my eyes never left the Captain.� Apparently, I passed this test because
leaving my top where it was, he now reached down and first unzipped my cutoffs,
then unsnapped them.� Pulling my cutoffs
open at the top, he placed the palm of his left hand flat on my belly and then
slid it between my legs.� After he had
cupped me for a second, he rolled my clitoris between his thumb and forefinger
for about half a minute until he felt me begin to get wet.� 

&nbsp;

Next he stuck two, then
three fingers inside my shaved vagina.� I
closed my eyes and tried to keep my mind blank, trying to ignore the sensations
I was feeling as he explored the most intimate part of my body.� His fingers were inside me for almost half a
minute before he pulled his hand out and smelled his fingers with a discerning
sniff.� Making a soft sound of what
seemed approval, he then walked around in back of me as he pulled and jerked my
cutoffs down to the middle of my thighs.�
He reached between my legs with his right hand and stuck his middle
finger inside my vagina again to get it moist, then quickly inserted it into my
anus.� I gasped in shock and horror.

&nbsp;

With his left hand on the
back of my left shoulder and the middle finger of his other hand buried inside
me, he said, �Clench your muscles.� Come
on, you little piece of ass-candy, tighten up for me.�� I obeyed in a daze, tightening my buttocks at
the same time that I pushed with my rectum.�
After a minute of tensing and straining, he pulled his finger out and
walked back around to stand in front of me.�
Suddenly, he reached up and put his fingers into my mouth, pulling my
lips back and exposing my teeth.� He
forced my mouth open and peered inside.�
I could taste myself on his fingers as they probed my teeth and pulled
at my lips and tongue.� 

&nbsp;

Finally done with his exam,
he turned and began to talk to the Master of the boat again.� As the two talked, he absentmindedly wiped
his fingers clean on my blouse.� I stood
on the dock with my hands to my side, my top pulled down below my breasts.� My feet were spread shoulder's width apart
and my shorts rested just above my knees as the dominants discussed what they
thought would be a fair price for me.� I
continued watching the boat's master closely.�


&nbsp;

Suddenly, I saw the hand
signals I'd known were coming.� I brought
my knees slightly together to allow the cut-offs to drop around my ankles, then
dropped to my knees in response to his command and rocked back on my
heels.� 

&nbsp;

I thought back to when I
had first been taken down below in the boat yesterday.� When he brought me back on deck in back, he'd
left me facing the rear of the boat as he removed my handcuffs.� He'd then grabbed my hair from in back and
forced me to my knees.� 

&nbsp;

�Forget,� he said, �about
what's going on inside.� You've got some
things to learn too.�

&nbsp;

He began by forcing me to
sit on my heels, knees slightly spread.�
Then he began showing me variations on the position; head bowed or
upright, knees spread or together, palms down or facing up on my thighs---each
having a different meaning to a Master trained in these subtleties.� As he did this, he showed me the
corresponding hand signals that went with each position.� Once we'd gone through these basic commands,
we began working on other more complicated commands and how to string them
together in a simple, wordless language.�
The man spent hours working with me on these and other hand signals
until I was perfect.� 

&nbsp;

I had to pay attention all
the time, for he beat me when I missed his signals.� He always held his hand almost hidden by his
side, but soon I was missing only a few of the hand commands, and then, finally
none.� I knew I must be better trained
than any bitch alive that had ever competed in field trials.� 

&nbsp;

There had been silence from
below except for a rhythmic grunting sound for much of my training period, but
towards the end of the last hour, I heard muffled groans and screams begin from
below again.� I was allowed to go to the
bathroom one more time after about four hours, and the girl had already been
steadily screaming for over an hour by that time.� She was tied on her back naked, with wrists
tied to the head of the bed and ankles spread almost four feet apart and tied
to the foot of the bed.� Her virginity
was long gone and the men of the crew were clearly tired, physically exhausted
from the lengthy rape and torture of their prey.� This situation thus screamed for more modern
means of breaking their captive's spirit.�


&nbsp;

The men laughed and
bantered back and forth as they watched; the poor girl was now being fucked by
a robot in order to �...get her pussy used to it.�� They had what must have been a ten-inch long,
red silicon dildo with a molded nutsack.�
This was attached to the end of a long metal rod that was connected to a
black box.� The metal arm had a back and
forth motion of perhaps eight inches, and it was set so that at the deepest
penetration, the rubber nutsack always just slammed into the crack of her
ass.� Then it would pull out until
perhaps only two or three inches remained in her belly.� This would allow her body would be to drawn
slightly towards the foot of the bed as most of the dildo was out of her body
for the moment and her ankle bindings pulled her back.� Then with about a second's delay, it would
slam into into the young girl again between her legs, filling her vagina once
more. It would ram into her pussy hard enough and deep enough so that at its
maximum extension, it would drive her body back up the mattress a couple of
inches.� At the end, as the dildo
bottomed out inside her tortured vagina, the only noise was a tortured pig-like
grunting sound that was forced from deep within her body.

&nbsp;

Finally, the men left,
accompanied only by the soft groan of the captured teenage girl.� One of the men would come down every so often
and put more lubricant on the dildo, but the original red color didn't hide the
bloody, pinkish froth that surrounded the dildo as it penetrated her body each
time.� She had to be in agony, but she
was so far gone that she only reacted physically when the boat would sway with
a passing ocean swell and thus slightly change the direction from which she was
being skewered.� This would suddenly
bring her back to life and she'd scream until the boat had settled down
again.� Then she'd go silent once more
except for the rhythmic pig sounds she made---but the robot always continued
its relentless fucking motion.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I knelt on the dock to show
my submission to the inherent superiority of the two men.� My head was bowed and my hands rested on my
thighs, palms up as I had been taught.�
Regardless of how I might have actually felt, I knew I was required to
show I was open to having sex with whomever might have authority over me.� But the strange man continued to ignore me as
he bargained with the boat captain; telling him that at twenty-eight, I was too
old and I didn�t have many good years left.�
That I'd been used too hard and my ass muscles felt like calamari.� It was clear to both dominants that this was
not true, it just his bargaining position.

&nbsp;

The captain countered with
my being completely broken in and not a trouble maker; that I was thoroughly
slave-trained as well as a a full-on ass-slut.�
I was, he said, �...a good second-hand woman, well worth the money.� Taken off the streets for less than year now,
she still has a lot of mileage left.....a spectacular piece of ass.�� Finally, he added, �She�s well educated; an
English teacher.� She can teach your sons
�reading�, �writing� and �rithmetic�.��
Then he laughed as he looked at me slyly, �She likes to fuck too, so
she�ll be pretty good at teaching them biology on the side.�

&nbsp;

He continued as if I wasn't
there.� �Look at her.� Gorgeous body.� Great tits and ass.� You saw her legs, her face....she's
beautiful.� She'll give you a lot of
pleasure and at least two-three kids before you wind up selling her ass
again.�� 

&nbsp;

This seemed to clinch the
deal.� There was a little more arguing by
my new Master, but it was just for form's sake.�
The two men stared at each other silently as they shook hands; the deal
for my purchase had been struck.� 

&nbsp;

�Well, I guess the sow is
mine now.�� My new Master looked at me
for a second as I knelt at his feet, then said to the boat's captain, �She's
been trained, I see.....European Standard?� 

&nbsp;

�Yeah,� was the laconic
reply.

&nbsp;

�And she's been trained to
show when she's receptive too?�

&nbsp;

�Yeah.� We haven't tried her out, but she gets good
marks from her previous owner.�� I
blushed as I heard this, but remained absolutely still.� I loved him.�
How could he have done this to me?

&nbsp;

My new Master asked, �So
why'd he sell her ass?�

&nbsp;

�Oh, it was getting a
little too complicated, what he said.�
She was an educated bitch that thought she was a little better than she
was.� Like a dumb-ass crack whore, she'd
gotten herself into trouble and needed to keep low for awhile.� So he took her in off the street, then broke
her in right.� Shocked the shit out of
her at first.� She got a little too
pushy, a little too demanding at the end.�
She's a high-end, high-maintainence slut that was used to having her way
with men; but with her looks, he felt she was worth the hassle.� Eventually forgot her status like a lot of
these educated, society bitches do.�
Wanted more than he was willing to give.�
But he trained her right; you put her on her hands and knees with your
dick up her ass and she'll beg for more just like any other street whore.� So he's moved on and made a little money on
the side with the bitch.� He's peddled
her ass on the market and here she is, ready to do your raggedy dick and your
sons too.� She may fight you a little at
first, but she likes to be fucked in the ass and likes to be hurt.� She's a steal, man; the rougher you treat
her, the better she likes it.�

&nbsp;

�Yeah,� my new Master
replied as he smiled at me, �tough on her ass, but good for me, I'd say.� Between me and my boys, once we get her
knocked up, we'll be keeping her ass pretty full all day long.�

&nbsp;

My thoughts began to hammer
at me, becoming more overwhelming in their frantic intensity by the
second.� Oh God, please let this not be
happening to me.� This can't be
happening.� Not today, not in
America.� Not to me.� I didn't deserve this, not in any way. Why
me?� I was too intelligent to think that
I was inferior as a human being.� No,
this must be my fault in some other way.�
It must be MY fault somehow.� It
must be because I'd been weak enough to give in to my needs, the cravings my
previous Master had dredged up and then taken advantage of.� Like any nicotine or booze, drugs or gambling
addict, I realized that there would come a point when I had to pay for my
addiction.� But not now.� This just wasn't fair, not when I was finally
getting my life back together.� At the
same time, I knew in the pit of my stomach that this was real, this couldn't a
dream.� As if to emphasize this last
thought, my new Master turned and aggressively put his hips in front of my
face.� He slowly unzipped his pants and
exposed himself.

&nbsp;

�You know what I want,� he
said.� �Do it.� Now!�

&nbsp;

This was purely a dominance
issue between he and I.� He was
humiliating me to show his power over me.�
To him, my shame would be both immediate and a public warning to me of
his power, proving to me that there were no boundaries for him when it came to
his power over me.� There were three of
us on the dock and we'd all known something like this must be coming.� Two were dominant males and implicitly
expected the absolute obedience of any woman that had been trained by their
hands.� I was the third and I knew that
no matter what I did, in the end I would be forced to submit to this man's
demands.� I could have fought him, but
all three of us knew it always would end the same way.� There was no way that I could physically
resist him, especially when there were three more men on the boat.� Worse, if I denied him, I knew they'd do
terrible things to me later. 

&nbsp;

My heart felt broken.� My mind more and more dazed.� I'd always been the one that took advantage
of a relationship.� Now I knew what it
meant to be used and then discarded by someone you cared about.� But the difference was that I had never
fundamentally altered someone's life like he had mine.� I was absolutely terrified of what might be
coming, and I felt devastated by what I'd just heard; my mind was overwhelmed,
my thoughts raced at light speed, but nothing made sense, there was no traction
here, there was no way out.� I hesitated
for a second as I realized that I would never be able to get used to being
talked about as if I were a prostitute that wasn't even present.� But I also knew I didn't have the luxury of
having any other options with these men.�


&nbsp;

My mind ran over my options
one last time.� I was afraid, but I knew
I didn't dare show these men any resistance.�
So hesitantly, reluctantly, I reached up with shaking hands and fondled
him before I began to make longer strokes.�
He was immediately hard, then hmmed deep in his throat, but not like I
was making him happy.� He didn't look
like a patient man.� I closed my eyes and
my original Master's familiar face swam before me as I unwillingly opened my
mouth to accept the hard black penis that was shoved in.� 

&nbsp;

There was an odd acrid
smell to this man; it was unpleasant, but I had no choice in the matter.� It seemed that nothing important mattered
anymore.� I licked the single eye of his
hot, shiny snake a couple of times, then sucked hard once on the swollen, dark purplish-black
end.� He jabbed himself in and out of my
mouth quickly several times, then ordered me to get ready to �... take it
deep.�� 

&nbsp;

Panicked, my eyes began
tearing in humiliation at being treated like a thing in front of the other men;
I wasn't person to any of these men, I was a thing, nothing but a living,
breathing receptacle for their semen.� I
braced myself for the upcoming oral outrage and somehow, just before he rammed
into me, I managed to take a full, deep breath.�
My throat felt terribly tight, but his thick shaft with the huge tip
drove forcefully through my mouth and seemingly headed straight for my
stomach.� I wanted to gag, but managed
somehow to stop myself.� Suddenly he
pulled back from my throat and into my mouth once more. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Okay, bitch, show me
what you've got.� Lick it.....work it;
you're supposed to be a high-society slut, so show me what educated men
like.� Work it real good, you little
slave bitch,� he ordered.

&nbsp;

With no other option, I
obeyed my new Master.� He put his hands
on my head and made me suck on him for about thirty seconds.� He still wasn't all in my mouth when he gave
a another dreadful lunge and penetrated my throat, putting almost six inches of
coal-black cock straight down my gullet one more time.� No matter how he tried, he still couldn't get
the last two or three inches inside me.�
Choking and trying to breathe, I grabbed his hips and held on as my
Master orally raped me for the first time.�
Both of his hands were on the back of my head now, rhythmically pulling
my head towards his hips as he thrust into me.�


&nbsp;

Almost in desperation, I
tried to speed up his ejaculation.� I
began to suck harder on his cock as it slid back and forth over my tongue, then
punched down my throat at the end of each thrust. My mouth began to fill with
saliva because of the friction of his erection as it banged against the lining
of my throat.� I somehow managed to
continue sucking as his balls slapped against my chin with each lunge of his
hips, and his grip on my hair tightened, as if encouraging me to work him
harder. I put one hand on his nutsack and began to massage him.� A few more strokes and I felt sure that he
was on the verge of unloading.� 

&nbsp;

Then he yanked my head back and his
glistening black cock popped free from my mouth as he made a sound that was
somewhere between a laugh and a bark. &quot;I'm on to your pathetic attempt to
control me, you whore. You really are an arrogant cunt and now you're gonna'
find out what a bitch like you gets for being so obviously disrespectful and
manipulative.&quot;

&nbsp;

I knew that any resistance was a
mistake; I prepared to accept without complaint or resistance whatever was
coming.� The only thing I could think of
doing was to try to relax my throat to minimize the pain he was obviously
planning to give me with his throbbing tube of hard flesh. But I hadn't
understood the depth of his anger, for suddenly my nostrils were pinched shut
by his thumb and forefinger as they crushed my nasal cartilage against my nose
ring. The pain combined with my inability to breathe and put me in a near
panic.� I was blinded; my eyes were
tearing in pain and I felt like he'd paralyzed me.� I couldn't blink, I couldn't breathe, my
brain and every muscle in my body seemed to be shutting down at the same time.
My jaws began to hurt and the pain grew so quickly that it took over my entire
existence. Something had happened to my jaws; they'd been forced open so wide
that my muscles had locked up.� Tears
were running from my eyes and rivulets of sweat were running down my face.

&nbsp;

I was not ready for his
raging fury as his cock punched through my lips one more time and wedged itself
deeply inside my throat. His hands grabbed my ears and began twisting them
until I felt as if he would rip them off. The pain of my ears combined with
that from my jaw made me forget to breathe for a second.� He took full advantage of this momentary
lapse and punched his cock another inch deeper into my gullet, gagging me,
punishing me, totally blocking off even the slightest hint of air.� I wriggled like a worm that had been impaled
by a hook; my eyes bulging from the strain of trying to somehow avoid
suffocation.� Suddenly, I became aware
that my hands were beating on his hips and I had no idea how long I had been
hitting him.

&nbsp;

A dozen deep lunges later,
I felt his balls tighten up and his cock almost actually vibrate on my
tongue.� An eye blink later, I felt the
sperm in his nuts boiling out and then rocket up through his erection.� My eyes literally flew open in surprise as a
huge gush of burning cum jetted against the back of my throat and began its
slow, dripping cascade into my stomach.�
He was so far inside my mouth that there was no taste to his delivery,
the semen had spurted so deep into my throat that it was beyond the taste buds
on the back of my tongue.� His semen felt
scalding hot and honey thick as it slowly ran down my esophagus.� After one more huge spurt, he pulled back and
finished emptying his nuts into my gaping mouth.

&nbsp;

I felt paralyzed, but he
wasn't finished.� My throat was sore by
now, but luckily I'd taken a deep breath when I'd last opened my mouth.� My jaws ached from being forced open so wide
for so long and massive amounts of saliva had pooled in my mouth.� But he still filled my mouth with his sex
meat even as he began to soften.� 

&nbsp;

His flaccid cock now rested
on my tongue and we both had frozen like plaster of paris statues.� After a moment, I shook my head and it felt
like I was coming out of a trance.� To
please him, I began to softly suck again for less than a minute and suddenly,
he was rock-hard again.� 

&nbsp;

As soon as my lips had
closed and made him hard again, he began thrusting into me, gaining speed and
pushing deeper with each stroke he delivered. I gagged as the huge head began
battering at the back of my throat once more. Then he grabbed my hair in his
fists and used it like reins to control my movements as he violently
face-fucked me. He forced his steaming meat deeper into me, putting it in my
gullet once more, blocking the air that I so desperately needed.� I knew my eyes lost focus as his groin beat a
desperate rhythm on my face, and I could smell his sour body odor.� I absently wondered if I would pass out
before he was finished with me.� 

&nbsp;

I had no choice but to hold
onto my new Master's hips now as he violently throat-fucked me again and
again.� I could do nothing else.� My throat began to spasm as it was invaded
time after time, but nothing stopped him.�
The massive head rammed deep into my throat time and time again, choking
me and filling me beyond belief.� I felt
him pull back into my mouth and tried to take another breath, but the wide,
black cock went full length into my throat again...and again....and again.� Despite the pain, I knew I was beginning to
suffer the first panicky feelings of suffocation when I felt the familiar
pulsing begin again.� Once more, an
incredible gush, an actual flood of semen filled my throat and was quickly
followed by another monstrous spurt.�
God, where did he store this stuff?�
Would it never end?� Would he
never be empty?� 

&nbsp;

Suddenly, he pulled back
into my mouth and finally began to deliver smaller gobs of his sperm into my
open mouth.� I gasped for air, then
choked on his jizz as I filled my lungs with the wonderful fresh pine scented
air.� And then he was empty.� Finally.

&nbsp;

I did my best to accept
every drop he unloaded in my mouth, then hold it until he gave me the command
to swish it between my teeth and then swallow. As my throat moved, signaling my
obedience to his command, my new Master finally smiled and patted me on the
head as if I were a trained pet who had just done a good trick for her dinner.
I was at rock bottom, and deep inside I knew that there was no way out.

&nbsp;

He turned and began talking
to the boat captain, �Ooh, I've been waiting for a new woman for a few days
now, if you couldn't tell.�� He was
finished with me for now and pushed me away from him, almost with disgust it
seemed.� I fell forward onto my hands and
knees as I gasped for air.� My mouth hung
open and I could see thin strings of cum mixed with drool slowly leaking from
my mouth.� 

&nbsp;

He'd finished talking to
the other man and turned back to me.�
&quot;Clean it up, suck it clean,&quot; my new Master ordered me in a
soft voice as he grabbed my hair and pulled on it to ensure that I finished
cleaning his cock of the remnants of his oral rape.� Shakily, I rose to my knees again and closed
my eyes as I tried to remember what it had been like to be free, to have the
right to choose what I did and who I would do it with.� I started to cry, when he suddenly hit me
lightly on the side of my face.� My eyes
flew open and with tears streaming down my cheeks, I wiped my mouth clean with
the back of my hand, then quickly began to lick the remaining thick strings of
whitish cum off of his rapidly softening cock. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Damn, you are one
fine cocksucker.� Take it back in, bitch,
all the way in.� Talk me to baby, tell me
how much you want it.&quot;� He patted my
head again like I was his favorite dog.� 

&nbsp;

On the boat, I had
pretended to a calm acceptance of my fate, but I was so afraid now; I tried not
to look as frightened as I felt.�
Desperation was a highly motivating force as I slowly took him back
inside me, but I couldn't talk with his cock filling my mouth.� And I was afraid to pull my head back and
take it out because that might displease him.�
I nodded my head to him in faux approval.� Eventually, my Master slowly pulled his limp
cock out of my mouth and I bowed my head again.�
I could feel his cum thinned with my saliva as it leaked continuously
from one corner of my mouth.� I could see
it slowly falling into clearish-white beaded threads that each ended in a
single drop.� And each string slowly
stretched until it finally broke and fell from my chin to land on my tightly
closed thighs.� 

&nbsp;

I shuddered as he aimed the
small digital camera that he'd kept in his pocket; the light flashed as it
caught the ultimate horror in a picture---his left hand holding the hair on the
back of my head and forcing me to face him; my eyes closed as they leaked
tears; snot running from my nostrils, then being caught by my nose ring; his
cum dripping from my lips and chin,.� It
was the final insult, but I knew there would be many more pictures like this.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

He started to turn away,
then turned back to the boat�s master.�
�They tell me you�ve got a new one onboard, but not yet trained.� That so?�

&nbsp;

�Yeh,� the tattooed man
replied.� �She�s a lot younger than this
one, but we�ve only had her a day.�

&nbsp;

�She going to be any good?�

&nbsp;

�Yeah, I think so.� She�s only seventeen, but she�s already been
broken.� Now we�re just getting started
with her training.�

&nbsp;

�How long,� the new man
asked, �before she�s ready to be moved onto the market?�

&nbsp;

�Give me two to four weeks
and she�ll be as eager as any piece you�ve ever had.�

&nbsp;

�She going to be an
ass-slut too?�

&nbsp;

�Yeah,� the big man
snorted.� �All my bitches are trained to
take it like that.�

&nbsp;

�Let me see her,� the man
requested. �I might want to make an offer on her now---save you the time of
putting her on the internet.�

&nbsp;

The boat captain turned and
called out to his men, �Bring the young bitch out. We might already have a
buyer.�

&nbsp;

After a couple of minutes,
I heard a commotion from inside the boat in the cabin. I heard a sharp slap and
a man's voice say, �Stop crying, cunt.�
NOW!�� There was silence for
another minute as both men standing next to me waited patiently.� There were sounds from the side of the boat
and suddenly, two men appeared, holding the young girl between them.� They dragged her from the boat to the dock
and half-carried her towards the waiting men.�
It was clear that she could barely walk, but whether from having been
beaten on the soles of her feet, the unending robotic rape or the giant butt
plug I'd seen her wearing, I didn't know.

&nbsp;

The girl wore no makeup,
her hair was tousled and needed badly to be brushed.� Her huge eyes were a beautiful light honey
brown in color, the size further exaggerated by the deep blue circles
underneath each eye.� One side of her
face was red from where she'd just been slapped.� The teenager still wore the pink hemp wedgies
and her thin cotton skirt and blouse were terribly wrinkled, obviously having
just been thrown on for the upcoming viewing.

&nbsp;

The three stood in front of
the buyer in silence.� The man walked
around and around the young girl, just looking but not saying a word.� Suddenly, he stopped in back and unzipped and
unsnapped her skirt, letting it fall to the dock around her ankles.� Without stopping, he popped the buttons on
her blouse and pulled it down over her shoulders, then off her arms as they
hung by her sides.� 

&nbsp;

Her not-yet-mature beauty
seemed to hit all of the men the same way.�
Long ash-brown hair swept down to frame an oval face that had the
classic beauty of actresses from the 40's and 50's.� She had wide shoulders, firm upthrust breasts
that were not yet fully developed, a narrow waist and long.� Her thighs and buttocks had the well
developed look of an ice skater or distance swimmer, and her shapely legs
looked somehow slim, yet muscular at the same time.� Her breasts were full, but not overfull for a
girl her age, the aureoles small and light brown in color and barely larger
than the lighter pink nipples that were erect from fear.� White skin curved down to the darkly-tangled
triangle between long legs.� Her body
absolutely promised an even lusher figure as she matured.� 

&nbsp;

My new Master put her
through the same exam he had me.� I could
see her legs trembling as he cupped her, then manipulated her.� But when he walked around back to measure the
strength of her anus, she began to cry.�
He looked down at the girl's buttocks for a second, then laughed as he
said to the boat captain, �Already working on her I see.�

&nbsp;

The tattooed man laughed in
reply, �Yeah.� I call it
'Right-Sizing'.� The cunt'll be able to
take a Mack truck up her ass when we're done.��
He quickly walked around back and roughly pulled the butt plug from her
anus.� She cried out in pain, but he
ignored it as he said, �Tighten your ass and cheeks for the man.� Do it now, you silly little bitch.�

&nbsp;

In response to the tattooed
man's crude order, she inhaled quickly and held her breath as she complied with
his command to tighten up and clench.� He
put his left hand on her taut belly and he probed her with his right.� I assumed that she was a little sloppy from
having that thing inside her, but both men were quickly satisfied.

&nbsp;

They began to negotiate
again over the younger girl.� My Master
wanted her now for his sons, but the tattooed man wanted to train her
first.� It quickly became clear however,
that both men really wanted her for themselves.� This
inexperienced and naive teenager embodied to them a complete lack of
sophistication both in the way she carried herself and in how she viewed the
world.� It was obvious that both men felt
a sexual hunger to claim the soft glow that seemed to emanate from within
her.� They wanted to affirm their
ownership of her freshness and cleanliness, her purity and naivet�.� She was a beautiful, helpless, innocent
teenage girl; and it was clear that one of them would shape forever her station
in life, altering the way she perceived herself and her relationship with men,
just to satisfy his lust. 

&nbsp;

It quickly became clear that the boat's captain was keeping her
for his own.� She was dragged back on to
the boat and I never saw her again.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I was still on my knees when a new man walked out onto the
pier.� My head was bowed, but I chanced a
quick look.� I realized that it was a
teenager, perhaps fifteen or so.� He
grabbed my biceps and lifted me to my feet, then said, �Put your clothes back
together, woman.�� He had an officious,
arrogant� manner and his tone was cold
and emotionless.� The kind of tone you'd
expect from an inexperienced teenager that held ultimate power over an
adult.� Afraid to show any disobedience,
I stood up and began to desperately pull my clothing back on.� For some stupid reason, I felt so much better
when I was clothed again.

&nbsp;

By this time, one of the men on the boat had brought a large,
cheap suitcase out from the boat and put it by me.� �These,� he said, �are the things her Master
didn't want anymore.� Shoes, clothes,
lingerie, makeup.....all that female crap.���
I looked at the thing and realized that everything I owned, everything
that defined me as woman enslaved was in that inexpensive piece of
baggage.� That phrase described my whole
life now; I was nothing but inexpensive baggage.

&nbsp;

Both men looked at me as the crewman continued.� �He doesn't have any plans for another woman
right now, and doesn't want her stuff taking up space.� You can have it.�

&nbsp;

I had just covered my breasts and zipped up my cutoffs when the
teenager said, �Pick it up and follow me.��
I walked two steps in back and to his right as I followed him off the
dock and struggled with the heavy suitcase.�
The boy never looked back to see if I was following, he just seemed to
have no fear of my trying to escape.� I
was led down a dirt path towards a large, old multi-story Georgian-style house
that took up the whole side of a cliff.��


&nbsp;

It was dark on the path, but there was enough moonlight to
recognize two women holding hands around a large tree that was near the
basement entrance.� As I got closer, I
could see that the women's wrists were handcuffed together behind their
backs.� Chains led from each set of
handcuffs to an iron ring that had been bolted to the tree.� As we passed them, I could see that both
looked exhausted and their legs were shaking.�
Both were sobbing softly.� The
worst thing was that their faces were both snugged up against the tree
bark.� Large fishing hooks had been run
through high up on each woman's nostrils on both sides.� Heavy fishing line went around both sides of
the tree and strung the women together.� 

&nbsp;

In his first conversational tone, the young man spoke without
looking at me, �They've been standing there for over thirty hours now and their
legs are getting tired.� The legs on one
of them is going to give out soon, and when that happens, they'll fall and rip
out the fishhooks..........they tried to escape.�� His offhand comments offered in such an
unemotional, matter-of-fact tone scared me to death and I felt a thrill of fear
shoot up through my spine.� They'd just
made sure I realized I was helpless against these people, whoever they
were.� All I could do was try to obey and
not give them reason to discipline me.� 

&nbsp;

We entered through a locked door in the lower level and although
it was quiet where we were, I immediately heard the sounds of young children at
the other end.� He locked the door after
us.� Before this I had been afraid,
afraid for myself and afraid of the unknown.�
But now, for the first time, I felt a sense of personal doom closing in
on me as I first stood inside that door.�
This feeling was so much stronger than anything I'd felt before; far,
far stronger than the emotions I'd felt that first night so many months ago
when my previous Master had collared me.�
Everything had spiraled completely out of control and all I could do now
was submit and try to survive.

&nbsp;

He never looked back as he moved towards the sounds of life
ahead.� The floor was smooth concrete so
I was able to drag the suitcase on its wheels as I scurried after the arrogant
teenager.� We walked down a corridor that
had three cells on each side.� The cells
all had bars on the front like you see with jails in western movies, but the
first rooms on either side were fairly large and somehow looked comfortable.� The second set of cells housed a no longer
attractive red-head on the left and a young, good-looking brunette on the
right.� I continued following the
arrogant teenager as we arrived� at the
last cells, both of which were filled on the right and the left.� 

&nbsp;

As we came up to the final two cells, a woman in each cage stepped
up to the bars and looked out at us silently.�
Both pressed against the vertical bars as they looked out; the one on
the left looked to be in her mid-twenties, the other perhaps in her early
thirties.� There were young mixed-race
children in the cells with both women, four on the left and three on the
right.� Both women had infants of perhaps
six or eight months in their arms and the belly's of each had noticeable swells
that affirmed they were pregnant again.�
There were formula bottles next to the front of the cage which told me
that neither woman was nursing.

&nbsp;

There was a strong family resemblance between the two women; the
younger one looking remarkably like a girl that had disappeared in the
Caribbean a few years ago.� The other
looked enough like her to be an older sister.�
My eyes caromed off of one and onto the other, then back again.� I was filled with horrified dread as my mind
tried to interpret what it saw.� What had
been done to these women to make them like this?� 

&nbsp;

Both women looked absolutely exhausted, aged far beyond their
years.� Their blond hair was lifeless and
they wore no makeup. Their bodies looked used and tired, their eyes sunken and
emphasized by dark pouches underneath.� I
stopped for a second and looked back at them.�
They looked at me in silence, then at the man with me as he gave me a
slight push to move on.� 

&nbsp;

Their eyes looked almost black in the poor light as they silently
watched him without expression.� All
three of us wordlessly appreciated the perfidy of the men that kept us captive
like this.�� I wanted to cry for these
women.� Their faces were lined, worn out
from their lives and their bodies, while still shapely, seemed soft, sagging
beneath the unrelenting pull of gravity and the weight of multiple, sustained,
child-births, one immediately following another.� They looked child-worn, their bodies
exhausted by the very nature of their lives.

&nbsp;

I suddenly realized that they were breeders and I was in a
breeding station.

&nbsp;

I was in shock as he dragged me through another locked door and
down a dark hall into a pitch black room.�
He left the door open.� I could
barely see him with the dim light from the hall.� The dark had descended upon me like
suffocating blanket, and instantly, I wanted to be back outside on the
boat.� I hated the darkness like this,
and the prospect of being here for awhile terrified me.� I shivered once and felt nervous sweat
congealing on my spine.

&nbsp;

Without inflection in his voice, he said, �Take it off.� Take it all off.�� I looked at him in disbelief and horror; this
couldn't be happening to me, my Master would never have allowed this.� When the youth made a threatening gesture
towards me with his fist; I flinched, then with shaking fingers I began to obey
a boy that less than a year ago I would have been teaching in my
classroom.� 

&nbsp;

He threw me on the bed when I was naked, then roughly pushed my
knees apart.� After looking at my shaved
nakedness for a second, he stroked me between my thighs.� The young boy finally stood up and began
undressing.� I was paralyzed, in total
shock at what was about to happen.� He
was huge with need and I knew there would no finesse.� There was no tenderness here, no preliminary
touch to help me prepare to receive him.�


&nbsp;

I dared not close my legs.�
I was pinned to the mattress in disbelief by his obvious anger and
hatred towards me, my legs spread wide by him to make me more available, my dry
vulva open and totally vulnerable to his needs.�
He crawled between my knees, then slowly rubbed his gigantic flesh across my unready vagina, teasing my
dry flesh in a terribly threatening way.�


&nbsp;

My mind was numb and my
voice was hoarse from having a cock banging on my vocal chords.� �Please don't hurt me.� Please, I'll cooperate.� You don't need to do it like this,� I begged
in an unattractive croak.� But he looked
at me without saying a word.� I whimpered
then, expecting the worst when he tried to rip his monster into me.� His need to take what he wanted from me was so great that he first
tried to penetrate me with one huge lunge of his hips.� My expectations had been correct; I was not disappointed. The pain was unbelievable.� 

&nbsp;

I sucked in a great breath
of air and I knew my eyes were bulging as I looked up at his face.� I was dry and unprepared for sex.� Consequently, it felt like he was literally
tearing me apart as he wedged the first few inches inside my defenseless
body.� The pain I felt between my legs
jolted me back to full consciousness.� I
felt as if a tree trunk was being forced inside me, bark and all.� He paused for a second, then jammed another
inch of his terrible weapon between my collapsing defenses.

&nbsp;

The walls of my impossibly
full vagina were being incredibly stretched and the pain was blinding.� This wasn't a man inside me, it was some kind
of burrowing animal or perhaps one of those terrible machines that bored out
tunnels to an unimaginable size.� I tried
to keep my pain inside me, but finally screamed in agony as his huge cock
turned my vaginal lips into a line of fire that consisted only of thinly
stretched tissue; finally, he was partially in as he began to breach me.� 

&nbsp;

Looking down the front of
my sweat soaked body in the dark room, I could somehow see that barely half of
his brutal tool had so far entered my straining vagina.� It felt as if he were hitting me with his
fist, but from the inside. Then, like a madman, he hunched forward and used all
of his weight to drive another few inches into me, brutally splitting me even
further open.� My screams grew louder and
more high pitched in the darkened room as he wedged inch after inch of his
wrist thick gristle into my tortured canal.

&nbsp;

He wrapped his large,
long-fingered hands around my breasts as anchors, then raised his body to
better penetrate me.� I closed my eyes
and tried to imagine I was somewhere else, but failed as he slammed into me
with terrific force one more time.� I
felt something tear as it gave way inside my dryish vagina. The pain felt like
a dull ache at first, then continued growing until I was almost sick to my
stomach. 

&nbsp;

Without thinking, I grabbed his shoulders, clawing at his back in
shock and agony.� I arched my belly against his and felt the insides of my thighs
clamp involuntarily against his hips.� He
might have just as well stabbed me, for the massive agony he caused.� His weight was crushing me and I couldn't
breathe, when he suddenly pulled back and rammed his cock deep into my body one
more time, grunting like the animal he'd become.� He had a huge penis and the pressure inside
my vagina was so intense that it felt like he was using a club to smash my
insides as he bludgeoned me into submission.�


&nbsp;

I lay on my back and he
kept my thighs pried apart with his hips as his cock tore its way deeper into
my now slightly moist channel.� His hands
were clawing and stretching my breasts; there was nothing erotic or sensual
about what he was doing to me as he manipulated the nipple rings.� It was an exercise only in brutality and
violence against my person.� The only
positive thing that night was that it gave him the physical relief he needed in
the end. 

&nbsp;

An eternity later I was
finally wet and the massive pain from his penetrations had begun to fade a
little. �The boy
raping me had finally gone as far inside me as he could and was now beginning
to hammer away at my defenseless body, driving his cock in and out like it was
some kind of weapon.� Suddenly, I
screamed again in pain as he bottomed out inside me after one particularly
vicious thrust, then I felt him pause, still pushed deeply, painfully deep
inside me.� My body had convulsed
helplessly after he'd hit the top of my cervix, my head and arms rising off the
mattress and the insides of my thighs clamping nervelessly against his
waist.� 

&nbsp;

He had me where he wanted
me now and he began pounding away without uttering a sound.� It hurt each time he rammed his cock home and
his pace stayed steady and relentless. My breasts bounced and jiggled in rhythm
to the powerful body strokes he was delivering.�
He was driving so hard now that my entire body shook each time he
finished a stroke deep inside my belly.�
He changed his angle of penetration every now and then, but almost
always in a way to hurt me more.

&nbsp;

I instinctually knew that I had to somehow try save myself.� I was a survivor, but I knew I wouldn't
survive as a breeder.� I'd made it
through the last nine months and somehow kept my sanity.� I could do it here too.� But I needed to be the property of a
male.� A dominant male that would protect
me and keep me safe from the rest of the pack.�
In panic, I felt the only chance I had was to please this young boy, try
to make him want me for himself.� I
wouldn't survive becoming a breeder that was used by everyone.� Quickly, I grabbed his firm, pistoning
buttocks and clawed him as I arched my belly and my clenched fingers pulled him
in even deeper inside me.� I gritted my
teeth against the pain and pulled on him even more.

&nbsp;

In response, he jammed his hard cock into
me with a loud grunt, swiveling his hips slightly each time to give his thrust
just a bit more force with which to hurt me.�
He explored every inch of me.� I
allowed him---no, I MADE him take everything.�
My legs were wrapped around his waist and my fingers dug into his
shoulders.� I arched my back as my pelvis
met his thrust for thrust.� I kissed his
ear and stuck my tongue in it, telling him how big he was and how good it
felt.� I tried not to gasp or cry out
anymore as he pummeled me, instead tying to assist him in maximizing his
penetration.� Then he took me by surprise
as he leaned forward and stuck his tongue into my mouth.� I reacted without thinking, trying to pull my
face away, but he held onto my head now.�
I made myself go limp for a moment, not knowing how to respond without
making him angrier. But he knew: he pulled back and looked into my eyes as he brutally
slammed his cock home once more with a smile of satisfaction etched on his
face.

&nbsp;

I tried to think about
anything but what he was doing to my body. To my horror, he proved to have more
self control than I would ever have expected of a teenager.� He continued to plow away inside of me for
one long minute after another, his tongue probing my mouth and then working its
way deeper as he tried to enter my throat. He had an amazingly long tongue and
it actually felt like he was trying to flick it against the back of my throat;
whatever he was doing made me want to gag.�
I willed myself to stay calm and I made no move that he could interpret
as a rebuff on my part.

&nbsp;

But his need to prove his dominance over me in bed?� This never left him.� His need to give me what he knew I had to
take was immense, driving, unrelenting.�
He grunted with effort as he used his manhood first like a sword to cut
into me, then like an hammer as he beat me into submission. He'd taken his
first slow progress against my unwilling flesh as an insult and had finally
substituted brute strength for finesse.�
I knew I was experiencing rape in all of its anger and ugliness.� At the end, he'd succeeded in bludgeoning me
and taking away everything that made me a woman before drenching my insides
with his boiling rage. 

&nbsp;

My entire body felt paralyzed from his assault, almost
lifeless.� As he lay panting on my belly
after he'd cum inside me, there was no doubt that I belonged to him now.� But the time to deceive myself was past.� I had to acknowledge that I was not the
innocent anymore.� Nothing mattered any
more but him.� I was nothing but a trophy
in his bed.� I softly stroked his back as
I tried to give him what I thought he wanted.�
I didn't care how young or how brutal he was, as long as he was strong
enough to keep me and protect me from what I'd seen in the cells.� 

&nbsp;

I was so absorbed in my thoughts that I almost didn't hear.� I looked over at a soft sound, but saw only
silhouettes as four more male figures entered the dark room en masse.� Their first act was to begin undressing.�
