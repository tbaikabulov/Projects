His
By Sweetcheeks88

"Be still, little girl,ï¿½ he ordered while his right hand cuffed her neck in his strong grip, his left wrapped in her hair, tilting her head to the side. He loved how this exposed her neck to him, for him to devour, and him only. His eyes locked into hers, daring her to make a sound or to disobey. He knew how to get her attention. He knew exactly how to make her surrender.
"This neck...mmmmm...(kiss)...is..(kissing lower)...mine", he groaned against her tender flesh, stopping at the place where her neck met her collar bone. His lips lingered here for what seemed like minutes, devouring her sweet taste, leaving his mark on his favorite place...on his girl.
His hands made their way down to her soft breasts as he towered over her, pressing her every curve into the wall as his rising chest leaned into her, taking her lips with his again. Safe, secure, wanted, and needed is how she felt, pinned between her Dom and his corridor wall. He always said her body couldn't lie to him. He knew what her body was saying- what her body was begging for. Him. Just him. He loved it. It drove him wild inside just as it did her.
Never had such strong, firm hands felt so good to her. His touch set every nerve ending on fire, leaving her pleading for more. He saw her needing eyes and smiled as he watched her slowly melt into his grasp. Like clay in his hands, he was going to mold her just the way he wanted.
"Turn around," he said, patting her left hip with one firm pop of his right hand. As she turned her body with her now trembling legs, he grasped her shoulders and spun her around, pressing her chest into the wall with his body flush against her backside. She could feel his warm, muscular chest rising and falling against her bare back. He brushed her hair away, pressing harder against her and whispered in her ear, "When I tell you to move, I want you to move". He then bit her earlobe, moaning into her ear while pressing his hips into hers making her let out a soft whimper.
He caressed her left waist with the front of his left hand traveling up to graze her left breast, placing his right hand over her mouth, pulling her head back onto his shoulder. His body pressed her harder against the wall, his grip at her breast and mouth now firm. She couldn't move. She didn't want to move. This was her favorite place to be...beneath him, under his grasp, under his control.
"The only thing you're allowed to do, little girl, is surrender. You're in my house, you know my rules, and you know what happens if you don't follow them. Do as your told, sweetie. Understood?"
"Yes, Sir."
"Good girl. Come with me now".
