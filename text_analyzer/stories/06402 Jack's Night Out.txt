Jack's Night Out
Provided By: BDSM Librarywww.bdsmlibrary.com
Synopsis: Jack met Justine in the bar and bought her a drink...the biggest mistake of his life.         






Jack sat in the bar, looking at the blonde. She was perhaps his own age, and wore a tight top that showed she had no bra on, and tight jeans that looked as if they were sprayed on. 

She was bending over the pool table as he watched, and swore he could see no visible panty line. Maybe she wasn&#8217;t wearing any at all?. Maybe he should get closer and find out.

Walking over to the bar he ordered a drink for himself, and a bottle of what he had seen her drinking from.&nbsp; He walked over to where she was standing, waiting for her shot, and handed the drink to her, introducing himself.

Jack had always believed in the direct approach. Either they went for it, or they didn&#8217;t. if they didn&#8217;t, it had only cost a drink. If they did, he was the winner.

The blonde lifted the drink to her lips and thanked him. Giving him a smile that made him remember he was a man. Had she touched his cock, he would not have felt any better right now.

�Let me finish this game, and I will join you� she purred 

Jack smiled and returned to his seat. He had heard that line so many times before, he just knew she was going to go in the opposite direction.

For ten minutes Jack sat and watched as she bent over the table a few times, trying to decide if she was or wasn&#8217;t wearing knickers. To his surprise, when the game was over, she looked around the bar, located Jack, and came over and at beside him.

�Thanks for the drink. I lost the game, but, what the hell. There is always next time�

�Hope I didn&#8217;t put you off� replied Jack, raising his glass to meet hers before she drank.

�nah. Not at all. He was hopeless really, but I have played five games, and wanted off. Your drink made it worth losing. I am Justine. And you are?�

Jack looked over at the girl and told her his name, and suggesting they have another drink.

Justine smiled and said she would love one, even though neither had finished the one they were drinking.

As soon as Jack moved to the bar, Justine rummaged in her bag for what she wanted, and smiled as she found it, dropping a small drop into Jacks drink.

It was a few minutes before jack returned, picking up his beer and finishing it off. Justine smiled, knowing that he was now hers for the night..

�Lets go to my place� Justine suggested.

Jack could hardly believe his ears, and simply nodded. Picking up his glass and emptying it in one go. Justine looked through her bag and found her car keys, as Jack found his coat,, meeting the blonde at the door.

The car park was only a few yards away, but Jack felt strangely dizzy as they reached it, Justine opening the door for him, and letting him slip into the passenger seat.

She looked down at him and smiled. Jack would be out of it for ages yet, and she locked the car and returned to the bar alone.

For the next few hours Justine allowed men to chat her up, but turned them all down. This was a normal Friday night for her, so far, except for the man sleeping in her car. The bar cameras may have caught her leaving with him, but had seen her returning alone, and would also record others chatting to her. if Jack&#8217;s disappearance came back to haunt the bar, it would not haunt Justine

For the next hour Justine drank only fruit juices, and flirted with the men in the bar, taking one on at pool and beating him, betting him a kiss that she would do so. there were several cheers when she won the game, and collected her kiss, thrusting her tongue into the guy&#8217;s throat.

Eventually, it was time for her to leave, but she made sure people would remember she left alone, kissing the guy who lost at pool one more time before she left.

Jack was still asleep in the passenger seat when Justine reached her car, parked in the dark area of the car park. This wasn&#8217;t deliberate, as she had not know for sure she would get a victim. But, now she had, she was pleased she had parked there. It was a half hour drive back to the house that she had inherited from her parents. The house was set in its own grounds, as Mummy and Daddy had not been short of a penny or two, and had wanted privacy. The house had been in Justine&#8217;s family since before she was born, and she had inherited it on her twenty first birthday, four years before, after her parents had been killed in a plane crash.

The idea for tonight had come to her several months ago, and she had busied herself preparing the cellar. Not having to work unless she felt like it, had given Justine the time to do what she wanted in the cellar. In the centre stood an iron bed, with a thin mattress on top of some thin wooden planks. The mattress was not going to be comfortable. But, that didn&#8217;t matter. It was not a guest house she was creating.

The house was in darkness as Justine drove up, taking the car around the back before stopping it. Checking on Jack she could see he was still out of it, and she quickly undid his seat belt.

Though not the largest woman, Justine had great upper strength, as she trained in the gym several times a week. Though Jack was not the heaviest person either, weighing a little over ten stone. Taking several rests on the way, she soon had her victim at the top of the cellar steps, and placed him on a chair at the top of the steps while she caught her breath, and turned on the cellar light.

A few minutes later, having recovered, she once again picked jack up, and slowly carried him down the steps, almost collapsing onto the bed with him as she reached it.

Jack made no noise as he landed on the bed heavily, which pleased Justine, as it meant he was still asleep. Laying him in the centre of the bed, Justine began her task of stripping the man naked. The jacket and shirt came off first, allowing Justine to cast her eyes on his hairless chest. She was deliberately saving the bottom half until last. It didn&#8217;t really matter what size his member was, but she wanted to leave it until last thing to find out.

After removing his shirt, Justine took the ropes she had arranged, and tied one to each of his wrists. Not tight enough to cut off his blood supply, but certainly tight enough to stop him escaping. Satisfied, she turned to the bottom half, removing his shoes and socks, before unzipping his trousers, and unfastening his belt. 

This scene had been played out in Justine&#8217;s mind so many times, and now, she was about to achieve what she wanted. Slowly. She dragged the sleeping man&#8217;s trousers down his legs, making sure the boxers stayed in place, deliberately not looking in that direction just yet. As his trousers passed over his feet, Justine took more of the ropes and tied them around each ankle.

Working quickly now, Justine positioned Jack where she wanted him, and pulling his arms and feet wide, she began to tie each of the four ropes to the corners of the bed. This would hold Jack until she was ready to release him, if ever she was ready.

Checking that Jack could not move his arms or legs any great distance, she was ready to reveal her prize. Taking the scissors she had placed by the bed, she cut up one side of the boxers, deliberately not disturbing them yet, leaving his manhood covered. There was plenty of time for that later. Quickly. She had the material cut, and moved over to the other side, repeating her task. All it would need now is for her to grab the remnants and pull, and they would come away from his body easily. But, not yet. Right now she needed a drink, and turning on her heels, she headed for the cellar steps, leaving her victim alone. She wasn&#8217;t sure how much longer the drug would keep him asleep, but she actually wanted him awake when she tore away hos boxers. For this purpose she had fitted a camera in the cellar and relayed it to the small television in the kitchen, where she now sat. 

Filling the kettle. She reached for the china cups her mother had bought for if Justine ever got married. But that had never happened, and perhaps never will. Especially if this went as planned. She would simply get a new man every time she wanted one. She knew she had the looks to ensnare men, but only now was it going to be to her advantage. Let them think they stand a chance with her, then, take over the situation, and see how they like it.

It was almost two hours before jack began to stir. Justine sat in the kitchen watching him as he awoke and became aware of his predicament. She wanted his to struggle, let him find out for himself that there was no escape unless she freed him. As she watched, she began to undress, standing naked in the kitchen. The mirror on the wall reflected her lightly browned hair, green eyes and thin lips. She hardly ever wore makeup, as she had a natural beauty that didn&#8217;t need help from cosmetics. 

Looking down at her body she smiled at herself. Her nipples were already hard from simply thinking of what she was about to do, the hard nubs sitting on her 36 d breasts. Her slender waist gave way to hips that curved nicely down to her long thighs.

Justine knew she had a good body. More than once she had been asked to consider becoming a model. But that was never in Justine&#8217;s mind. But still, it was nice to know others appreciated her.

Pulling her new outfit from the bag at her feet, Justine began by pulling the leather crotchless panties up her legs, squirming her hips to get the tight material past them. Once in place, they held her like a second skin, but allowed free access to her pussy and arse. The leather bra was next, cupping her breasts, lifting them slightly, but, the holes allowing her nipples to press through. 

Only then was she ready to go meet her victim again. And soon, he would know he served only one purpose.

Walking back towards the cellar, she opened the door and slowly started walking down the steps. She had considered wearing heels, but then decided that bare feet would make less noise, and hopefully he would not hear her coming. She was already at the bottom of the steps before Jack caught sight of her, still struggling to free his arms and his feet.

�Hello again jack� she started. �Nice to see you&#8217;re awake again. You can pull all you want on the ropes, they wont come loose. Until I release you, you are staying where you are. �

She stood directly by the side of the bed, and gently brushed her fingers over his chest, letting her nails drag slightly over his nipples. Whether he wanted to do or not, Jack&#8217;s nipples reacted, and were as hard as Justine&#8217;s were. That&#8217;s the thing about men, they cant resist sexual contact, whether they want to do or not.

Slowly, she started to drag her fingers in circles on his chest. The circles slowly increasing in size, until Justine knew that the next circle would touch his manhood. Jack must have worked this out a well, as he tried to pull his sex away from her, but it was a vain gesture. Without a word, Justine moved her hand to take hold of the remains of his boxers, and with a pull, ripped them away from his body.

Whether Jack wanted Justine or not, his manhood gave all the signs that he did. It was already hard, and stood proud as Justine removed the last vestibule of modesty. leaving him totally naked.

Smiling, Justine ran her fingers across his lower stomach, and down towards his balls.

�Nice to see you stand to attention when a lady is present� she mocked. 

Jack was not perhaps the largest cock she had ever seen, but, it was quite thick. It may have been only about six inches long, but what it lacked in length , it gained in girth. Justine was pleased with her catch.

�Now then Jack. You are here to please me. You wanted me in the pub, and I wanted you, but under my terms. I know you will try to not do as I want, but, in the position you are in, you wont be able to help yourself. � at this point she took hold of his cock, and began to slide her hand slowly up and down its length, feeling it harden again under her touch.

Leaning down, she kissed the tip of his cock, tasting the slight saltiness, before opening her mouth and sliding her lips down and over the end, stopping when just the head of his cock was in her mouth, and gently sucking on it.

She could feel Jack beneath her, struggling to get free, but that was not going to happen, as she let more of his cock slide into her mouth, teasing it with her teeth, then flicking the end with her tongue. Even if he came now, it didn&#8217;t matter, there were going to be many other times. But he didn&#8217;t. she pressed her mouth as far over his cock as she could, feeling it hit the back of her throat, before sliding her mouith off it completely.

Climbing onto the bed, and straddling her helpless victim, Justine positioned herself carefully, taking his cock in her hand, and guiding it between her legs, there was no finesse as she felt it touch the entrance to her wet pussy, holding it still as she got the head inside her, before slamming her hips down onto Jack&#8217;s groin, taking the whole of his cock into her in a single thrust.

Jack moaned as her arse cheeks slammed against his thighs, his cock deep inside her wet pussy. Justine felt him try to raise his hips, but, it was her that was going to dictate the pace. She didn&#8217;t mind when he ejaculated, but she did want to get as much pleasure as she could from this first encounter.

Slowly. She raised her hips and moved her finger tips to his nipples. 

�If I feel you raise your hips, I will twist these. Understand? You are not here for your pleasure, you&#8217;re here for mine. �

With that she grabbed both nipples hard and twisted them, smiling as Jack cried out in surprise and pain. At the same time she slammed her hips back down onto his cock, engulfing it all.

Slowly at first, she began to raise and lower her hips, forcing her victim to fuck her, whether she wanted to do or not. His hardness inside her was testament that he wanted to do so, even though his eyes said differently.

Still he struggled with the ropes, but still they remained as Justine had tied them. As she began to move faster. Slamming her hips hard against him to get him deeper. 

One agai8n she felt him lift to meet her, and without a word, grabbed and twisted his nipples viciously, laughing as he screamed out.

She could tell his climax was close, as was her own, and began to move faster still, taking all he had inside her, as she felt her orgasm getting closer.
 
There was a loud moan, which Justine took a few seconds to realise was coming from her own lips, as her orgasm swept over her, and feeling his cock jerk inside her at the same time. still she rode him, not letting him relax until her orgasm passed. She could feel hot wet juices on her thighs, and cared little about them being his or hers, the moment took away that thought, a she enjoyed the sheer bliss of her plan coming to fruition. 

As her orgasm subsided, Justine slowly climbed off her victim, allowing him to see the juices dribbling down her thighs. Using a finger to wipe some of it up, she raised the finger to her mouth, and began to suck it clean, before leaning her head towads his now soft cock. She could have sworn he was going to get hard again, as she closed her mouth over his cock, and began to suck him clean, tasting both her own and jacks juices in her mouth. Only when she was satisfied that he was clean, did she stand up, smiling down at him

�If you get the chance again, you may wish to think twice about buying strange women drinks I the pub, hoping to get into their knickers.� She laughed, as she began to walk away, heading back to the steps and out of the cellar. At the top of the stairs she turned off the light switch, sending the cellar into darkness, and leaving Jack alone to ponder his fate. �see you later darling� she called down the steps, just before closing the door.
