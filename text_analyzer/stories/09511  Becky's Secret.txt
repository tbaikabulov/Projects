Dear Simon,
I know over the past five years our marriage has grown a bit stale. I know you are ready to give up on us, and I understand. However, I believe we can make this work. Please hear me out. I believe the reason our marriage is failing is because neither of us are getting what we need sexually. If I recall correctly, the last time we had sex was nearly a month ago, and I know that is not enough to satisfy you. The simple solution would be to commit to having more sex (which I do think we should do), but unfortunately the situation is even more complicated than it initially appears. You see, there are things about myself I haven't told you - things I want, no things I need. Please do not think I have hid any part of myself from you out of lack of trust. Rather, I was ashamed to let you see the darker, weaker part of my nature. For years I have kept my secret dark desires hidden, but now I realize that if I want this marriage to work (and I do, baby. Believe me, I really do), then I will have to share all of myself with you. Under my bed you will find a locked box. The key is enclosed in this envelope. In this box are items I have collected over the years and enjoyed privately. I am sure you will know what to do with them.&nbsp; Over the course of this weekend, I want you to use them. I want you to use me. From when I return from work at seven tonight until I wake up for work at seven on Monday, consider me your slave. I will obey any command you give without question. I have only two limitations: I do not want to be publically exposed. I have a reputation to maintain at work and cannot risk an employee seeing me being publically humiliated. Secondly, I do not want to be penetrated anally. My mouth and pussy, however, are of course yours to enjoy. If you agree to this plan, I thank you. If not, I understand. 
�
Thank you, my love,
�
Becky

Simon was shocked at the contents of her letter. He had always believed she was to prim and proper to ever want to try anything kinky in bed. Now he realized that was all she wanted. His curiosity getting the better of him, he bounded up the stairs to their room. There was indeed a locked box under their bed. He had never really noticed it before, but he was dimly aware that it had always been there. Trembling a bit, he pulled the box out from under the bed and unlocked it. He was delighted with what he found inside. She had all sorts of toys: cuffs, a ballgag, rope, a flogger, a collar with a leash, and even painfully high heels that locked onto her feet. He smiled thinking about the things he would supplement her collection with. Just looking at this stuff made him hard. They were&nbsp; going to have one hell of a weekend. 
�
Becky had hardly been able to concentrate all day, thinking about the weekend that awaited her when she got home. She was terrified and aroused all at the same time. She had little doubt in her mind that he would accept her offer - what man wouldn't? When she arrived home, she pulled her car into the garage. On the door between the garage and the basement was a note.
�
I accept your offer, and I agree to your terms. Leave your clothes on the floor. New clothes and instructions are in the basement.
�
She shivered at the cold as she slipped out of her clothes. Her nipples immediately hardened when exposed to the chilled air in the garage. She stepped into the basement. On top of the washing machine was a very tiny pile of clothes and another note.
�
Dress and then go to the living room to wait for me. Leave the key to your shoes. 
�
She noticed then that her lockable pumps were awaiting her. She slipped into the very short skirt he had selected for her. There were no panties in the pile, nor was there a bra. She slipped on the blouse, realizing as she began to button it that the top few buttons had been removed, leaving her exposed. Finally she locked the shoes on. When she reached the living room, wincing as she made her way up the steps, she noticed handcuffs, her scarf, and a note lying on the floor.
�
Blindfold yourself, then cuff your wrists behind you. Stand as you wait for me. She did as commanded. Without being able to see, she had no idea how long he was making her wait. Her feet began to feel sore in the heels. Normally she never more heels higher than three inches, and these were six. Ignoring the pain, she stood perfectly still.
�
From across the room, Simon admired her. He had slipped in as soon as he had heard the lock on the handcuffs slip shut. She was truly lovely. He made her stand like that for an hour before he decided to move. He came up behind her, and buckled her collar around her neck. She tensed at his sudden touch and then relaxed.
�
"Simon," she murmured happily. "I was starting to wonder if you would leave me standing here all night." He smacked her bottom, hard. The fabric softened the blow, but not much. She yelped.
"You will speak when you are given permission, slut," he said. "And when you do speak, you will address me as Master Simon. Is that understood?"
"Ye-" she started before he smacked her ass again. Realizing her mistake, she nodded.
"On your knees, slut," he commanded. She obeyed immediately, moving carefully to keep her balance without the help of her hands. It was glorious to finally be off her feet though. She heard the zipper on his jeans, and opened her mouth, realizing what he wanted from her. She licked and sucked until grabbed her harshly by the back of the head. He forced her head closer to him, forcing her to take him deeper in her throat. She gagged at the feel of him, but he didn't stop, just forcing his way in further until he came, shooting his seed into her stomach. Obediently, she licked him clean.
"Well done, my little slut. I am pleased," he said, stroking her hair. She wasn&#8217;t sure why that sent such a strong feeling of elation through her, but it did. He untied her blindfold. Then he uncuffed her hands. "Now go make me dinner." She made them steak with a lovely side salad and chocolate mouse for dessert. Together they sat down to eat.
"Slut, what do you think you are doing?" he demanded as she picked up her fork.
"Eating dinner, Master Simon?" she asked timidly.
"And who gave you permission to eat?" he asked.
"No one, Master Simon," she said, setting down her fork. She watched as he noted something in a small notepad he took out of his pocket. She didn't dare ask her husband what it was for. Then she sat, stomach growling, as he ate his dinner. Finally, when he was ready for his dessert, he allowed her to eat. She ate ravenously, not sure when he would allow her food again. He ate his mousse slowly, enjoying every bit of it. He intended to take his time this weekend.
"Clean all this up, slut," he demanded. She hurried to do his bidding. Soon the table was clear and the washer was running. "Go fetch some of your rope from the bedroom," he ordered. "And the ball gag," he called after her as she scurried upstairs. She brought it down.
"Bend over the back of this chair." Trembling, she complied. He moved her into the position he wanted, and then tied her to the chair. Her ankles and wrists were securely fastened to the various legs. He forced the ball gag behind her teeth and buckled it tightly. Then he began to undo his belt.
"Bad slaves deserve to be punished," he declared. "You kept a secret from me, your husband, for five years." She felt the bite of the belt as it hit her flesh. It hurt more than she expected. He continued to flog her with it until she was sure her ass was bleeding. She screamed, but her gag was effective. Only little mewing sounds managed to escape. Simon was far more into this than she had realized. By the time he was finished, she was sobbing. Finally, he began gently rubbing her ass. "There now, are you sorry for lying to me, slut?" he asked, softly. She nodded her head vehemently. "Then I forgive you," he said, crossing a line off his little notebook. She realized now that he planned to use it to keep track of her punishments.
�
After he untied her from the chair, she collapsed to the floor.
"Get up, slut," he ordered her. Shaking, she rose to her feet. "Bad behavior will be punished, but good behavior will be rewarded. That was a fine dinner you made. Lie on your back on the table. She did as she was told. He slipped hand under her skirt, and began to stroke her pussy. She was shocked to realize she was already wet. He slid his finger into her cunt, and she moaned with pleasure. Increasing the pace, he finger fucked her. She found herself bucking into his hand, trying to increase the sensation. She came with the strongest orgasm she had experienced in years. He took the ball gag out of her mouth as she attempted to recover.
�
He was pleased to see she had responded well&nbsp; to his reward. Her ass had to be hurting, but she needed to learn that she was not allowed to lie and keep secrets from him. If she had been honest, they could have been doing this for five years! He felt himself growing hard again at the thought. He pulled her by her leash off the table, and she followed him upstairs to their bedroom.
�
"Lie down on your back," he ordered her. "Now raise your wrists above your head." He cuffed her to the headboard. She felt herself getting wet again. Then he spread her legs, and tied each ankle to a different bedpost at the foot of the bed. She gasped as he ripped off her skirt and then her blouse. He crossed off another line in his notebook.
"Clothing is a privilege," he explained. "Since you tried to eat your dinner without permission, you don't get special privileges. She saw the arousal in his eyes after ripping off her clothing. Silently she made a mental note to acquire a large collection of cheap clothing he could destroy. If things progressed like this every time she offered herself as a slave for the weekend, she would run out of clothes very quickly.
"You don't come until I say you can come," he ordered her. She nodded, wondering if she would be able to control herself. Without any additional foreplay, he slammed into her, pushing his cock into her pussy all the way to the hilt. She gasped, feeling him fill her so suddenly. He gave her no time to adjust, pounding into her body. This was not the gentle love making she was used to with him. This was different. He was fucking her. She had never been so aroused. She felt herself nearing the brink.
"Please Master Simon, let me cum!" she begged. "I am so close. I don't think I can stop it." He pinched her nipple cruelly, reminding her she was forbidden from speech. It didn't help. If anything it made it worse. She came, the waves of her orgasm astonishing her with their strength. She felt herself spasming around his cock, milking the cum out of him as he came too. He collapsed on top of her. 
�
After a while he untied her legs and released the cuff. She thought he was going to free her, but instead, he cuffed her hands behind her back. "Get some sleep, Love. I have big plans for tomorrow. Exhausted, she was asleep almost before he finished speaking.
�
In the morning, she woke to feel him repositioning her on the bed. He had her kneel over him so that she could ease his morning erection with her mouth. She hardly gagged at all this time when he deep throated her. Once again, he used her hair to control her, fucking her mouth as he would a pussy. When she finished, she hoped he would free her. Instead, he simply cuffed her hands in front of her and sent her down stairs to make him breakfast and bring it back. With some pain she realized that she still wore the shoes.
�
Simon enjoyed watching his naked wife in only her high heels. He knew her feet must be killing her, but he loved the look of them. He also realized that he was extremely aroused by the thought of her suffering for his pleasure. When she returned with his breakfast, he ate it happily.
"Slut, I'm going out for a bit this morning. I have decided I quite like the image of you lying in the middle of our living room, naked and hogtied, waiting for me. Do you know what that means?"
"Yes, Master Simon," she said. She began to wonder just how long her planned to be gone this morning. Hogtied was not exactly a comfortable way to be bound. She knew by the time he came back, her muscles would be very sore.
"Good," he said, and held out his now empty tray to her. "Take this back to the kitchen. Then go the living room, and get into the position. I will tie you when I get down there." 
�
After he had finished getting dressed, he quietly made his way downstairs with the rope. He was pleased to see that&nbsp; she was waiting for him, lying on her stomach, clasping her ankles in her hands, trying to hold the position.
"Well done, slut," he praised her. He tied her ankles together, then her wrists, and finally he connected them. "Now you be good until I come back," he ordered. She nodded.
�
The whole time Simon was out, he found himself unable to get the thought of her beautiful bound naked body out of his head. She really was quite lovely with her wrists and ankles trapped behind her.&nbsp; He didn't tell her this, but he was actually only gone about twenty minutes. He popped over to the hardware store to buy a board. Then he brought it back to the house and spent the next few hours sanding it smooth and drilling holes into his paddle. He wrapped some athletic tape around the handle to give him a good grip and practiced swinging it a few times. The holes eliminated a lot of the air resistance, and he could not wait to hear the sound it would make when it hit her round ass.
�
He was gone for a few hours before she started crying, her muscles cramping painfully. He couldn't possibly mean to leave her like this all day, could he? She didn't know if her body could take it. Sobs started to wrack her body. Her shoulders hurt the worst, wrenched behind her painfully. Finally, he returned for her. Gently he released her wrists and ankles.
"I made you a present," he said, showing her the paddle. Her ass had mostly healed from last night's flogging, but she didn't relish the thought of that hitting her. "What do you say we try it out?" he said.
"If you wish it, Master Simon," she said tearfully.
"I do," he said, smiling at her fear. "Now I want you to bend over the armrest of this couch, slut." She bent over, clasping the cushins firmly in preparation for what was to come.&nbsp; Their house was far enough away from their neighbors that he didn't bother gagging her. "I want you to count them," he said. She flinched as she felt the paddle gently touch her ass. She realized he was lining up for a swing. Suddenly she felt the paddle slam into her ass, and she yelped.
"One," she counted.
�
Her ass was returning to that delightful shade of pink as he hit it with the paddle. Sometimes he would strike her immediately after she counted, but other times he would wait a minute or two, giving her time to dread the blow when it came. Finally, they reached ten. He massaged her ass gently to comfort her. She was sobbing openly now. With her beautiful red ass, and those sexy heels, he just had to have her. He pulled her hips a little bit away from the couch, but held her in place with one hand. With the other he unzipped his fly and pulled out his fully erect cock. He was hard again for the fourth time in twenty-four hours. He really wasn't sure how long he could keep this up. Internally, he laughed at his own pun. 
�
Becky realized what he wanted and didn't try to move. She wondered if there would be bruises on her ass the shape of the holes in the paddle. She suspected there would be. This weekend was teaching her a lot about herself. The pain was not what turned her on, she realized. It was the submission. The submission and the helplessness made her practically drip. When he reached under her to feel her pussy, neither of them were surprised to find she was wet. He shoved his cock forcefully into her pussy and fucked her hard. She came long before he did, and shivered in anticipation of what the rest of their weekend would bring.
