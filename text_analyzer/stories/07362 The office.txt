The Office
By Michelle

I am sitting in my office doing paperwork at my stark desk very late at night. Going about my daily routine of running a very large corporation.&nbsp; When a knock sounds at the door.&nbsp; I look up as the door opens.&nbsp; A very handsome man steps inside.

I look at the man, �How did you get in here, where&#8217;s my secretary!&nbsp; JANEEN!� I yell out the open door.&nbsp; The man puts his finger to his lips saying, �Ssssh my lady, no need to fret.&nbsp; I am only here to ask a boon.�&nbsp; I sit surprised at the phrasing of his words.&nbsp; �Tell me what you want and be quick about it, I&#8217;m busy.�

As he closes the door behind him a small shiver runs up my spine.&nbsp; From 
fear or excitement, I am not sure.&nbsp; Crossing the room the man circles around my desk to stand over me.&nbsp; Looking up at his tall height from my seated position I am instantly alarmed as his hand reaches out and covers my nose and mouth.&nbsp; Struggling I try and break free but in his other hand he produces a knife. My body stills instantly.

�Now, my lady I will remove my hand if you promise not to scream.&nbsp; I would hate to have to cut your pretty little throat.�&nbsp; I nod my head in understanding taking a gulp of air as his hand drops back.&nbsp; Still holding the knife to my throat he says, �Now my lady about that boon.�&nbsp; �What is it you want?� I demand in a very angry voice.

The single word that he utters fills me with dread.&nbsp; �You,� he whispers.&nbsp; I try to stand, but feeling the knife pressed to the sensitive skin of my throat I sit still.&nbsp; �You won&#8217;t get away with this, someone will come in, and my secretary is right outside!�&nbsp; �Oh no, my lady, I sent her home. We are quite alone, there is no one here. No one to help you.�&nbsp; He smiles an evil smile as he says this. �You are quiet helpless and at my mercy I am afraid.�

Panic sweeps through me as I digest his words.&nbsp; My hands trembling with fear, sweat breaking out on my brow.&nbsp; �Now, my lady, would you please stand for me?�&nbsp; Through a haze of disbelief my body obeys though every fiber of my brain is screaming &#8216;no&#8217;.&nbsp; As I stand the man steps back a few feet and slides the knife into his right pocket.&nbsp; �We don&#8217;t need the knife anymore, do we my lady?� He asks. �Besides, I believe this is much better for what my intentions are.�&nbsp; He produces a gun out of his left jacket pocket and points it at me.

�Now be a good girl� he says �and turn around.�&nbsp; Obeying on instinct I do as instructed.&nbsp; �Close your eyes and put your hands on your head please.�&nbsp; Once more as if in a hypnotic state I obey without question.&nbsp; Suddenly I feel his hand over my mouth and then something strange happens. I feel straps being extended and fastened around the back of my head.&nbsp; Gasping for breath and finding my airway blocked sends me into panic. My hands move to rip away the foreign object covering my mouth.

Quickly he grabs my hands and secures them in an iron tight grip behind me.&nbsp; �Now, my lady, there is no reason to fear, this is simply just a gag to insure you will be quiet and listen to me.&nbsp; If you are a very good girl I will remove it, but first you must prove to me you can be trusted.�&nbsp; I feel tears starting to well in my blue eyes as he demands �Turn around and face me.�

Turning I glare into the man&#8217;s face hoping he can read the disgust and hatred in my eyes.&nbsp; He simply chuckles at what he sees and smiles at me.&nbsp; �My, my you are a haughty little filly, aren&#8217;t you?&nbsp; Now, my lady, I want you to undress for me.�&nbsp; Standing stock still at the command I shake my head no.&nbsp; �Now be a good girl my lady, I would hate to have to punish you.�&nbsp; His commanding voice booms, �You would not like my punishments I can assure you.�

Feeling the tears stream down my face. Looking at the gun still clutched in his left hand I feel utter despair, knowing that I really have no choice.&nbsp; I can either do as this mad man commands or die.&nbsp; Finally my fear of death overcomes my reluctance and I begin to undress.&nbsp; My shaking hands move to the buttons of my blouse but they are trembling so much I have trouble releasing even the first button.&nbsp; �Relax my lady� comes his soft voice in a reassuring tone, �I promise I shant hurt you if you just behave.�

Closing my eyes I take a deep calming breath and think to myself.&nbsp; �I can do this, whatever this man wants I can do.&nbsp; I am strong, I am a survivor and I want to live.�&nbsp; Once more my hand reaches for the top button of my blouse and this time with a much steadier hand I unclasp it.&nbsp; Moving quickly, not giving myself time to reconsider I open the remaining buttons and slide the blouse off my shoulders.

�The skirt next my lady,� he commands.&nbsp; Obeying I reach behind my back and unzip the skirt allowing it to fall to the floor.&nbsp; I now stand in front of this man in only my underwear and bra.&nbsp; Shivering and weeping at the exposed and helpless feelings I feel, my body trembles.&nbsp; �Very good, my lady, now the rest of it,� he commands.&nbsp; In shock and terror I shake my head &#8216;no&#8217;.&nbsp; Angrily he says, �Do as I say my lady, or else.�

Shaking my head once more I shutter as he crosses the room.&nbsp; Standing, towering over me, his hand gently strokes my cheek.&nbsp; �I would hate to have to hurt you, my lady, please do as I say.�&nbsp; Once more I shake my head no and his eyes fill with anger.&nbsp; �Very well my lady, but remember, you asked for it.�&nbsp; Quickly he spins me around catching both my hands in the grasp of one of his.&nbsp; I desperately try to struggle to break free but he is just too powerful.&nbsp; 

Dragging me by hands he pulls me over to a chair and sits. Pulling me over his lap.&nbsp; Struggling again, trying to stand I feel the barrel of the gun pressed to my left temple and my body immediately stills.&nbsp; �Now remember, my lady, you asked for this.� SMACK, a punishing blow lands on my delicate rear.&nbsp; SMACK, pain shoots through my back at the blow. SMACK this landing on the other cheek. SMACK, SMACK, SMACK, feeling his hand come down on my bottom, pain shooting through my spine. Tears stream down my face.

Sobbing and shaking my head against the pain, the fire in my ass, I jump as I feel his hand once more. This time it rubs very gently over my inflamed flesh.&nbsp; �Now, my lady, will you do as I ask?�&nbsp; He inquires.&nbsp; Quickly I shake my head yes and he releases me. As I stand up on shaky legs he looks at me and smiles. He stands and steps back a few feet.&nbsp; �You look lovely with tears in your eyes lady,� he says.&nbsp; �Do as I asked, now!�

Closing my eyes in an attempt to distance myself from the situation, for if I can pretend this is all a dream I might make it through.&nbsp; With trembling hands I reach behind me for the clasp of my bra and unhook it. Sliding the straps down my shoulders and shrugging, the bra falls to the floor exposing my tender white flesh beneath.&nbsp; Feeling my nipples pucker as the cold air laps at my skin, shivering in fear of being exposed to the strange and frightening man.&nbsp; �Now the panties,� he whispers.

Sighing in resignation I obey.&nbsp; Slowly sliding my hands to my hips, catching the waist band of my drawers, I sweep them downward. First over my rear, then my thighs and finally my calves until they lay on the floor at my feet.&nbsp; Stepping forward I leave them in a pile.&nbsp; My whole body is shivering in fear now, knowing, expecting, and dreading what is coming next.&nbsp; �Open your eyes my lady,� comes a husky whisper.

�You are very beautiful my lady,� the whisper comes again, �Now do as I asked and open your eyes.�&nbsp; Obeying my lids flutter open as I look at him.&nbsp; A small smile plays across his lips as he gazes at my naked form.&nbsp; �Well done my lady, now come here.�&nbsp; Walking across the room in halting steps I do as commanded. I glide across the floor until I am standing before him.&nbsp; I glance at his hand that still carries the gun and seeing the direction of my gaze he smiles and says, �We don&#8217;t need this anymore, do we my lady?�&nbsp; Shaking my head &#8216;no&#8217; he places the gun back behind him on a table.

Stepping toward me until his body is pressing into mine. I feel the coarse fabric of his coat and trousers pressing up against my sensitive flesh. I shiver slightly.&nbsp; Terrified of what is to come but knowing, realizing, I have little choice. Slowly his hands rise to the gag around my head and he looks deeply into my eyes �If I remove this you will not scream, will you my lady?� He asks.&nbsp; Shaking my head &#8216;no&#8217; he begins to unfasten the strap around my head.&nbsp; �Before I remove this I have one more demand my lady. You will not speak, you will not utter a sound unless I direct you to, is that clear?�&nbsp; One more I shake my head in understanding.

He hands quickly release the strap around my head.&nbsp; With his body pressed tightly to mine, I can feel his manhood pressing through his pants. As he removes the gag my eyes sweep closed and then I feel the tenderest of feather light lips against mine.&nbsp; My eyes fly open as his lips continue to press, his tongue softly sweeping along my lower lip.&nbsp; Shivering, feeling a strange warmth sweep through my body, I respond to him. All within me screams NO but in utter disbelief I feel my lips parting of their own accord.

Taking this as an invitation the man encircles me in his arms, pressing me even closer as the kiss deepens. His tongue darting in and out of my mouth, swirling against mine, sliding along my teeth.&nbsp; My body trembles in excitement, my tongue retuning the gesture, pressing into his mouth and thrilling at the taste of him.&nbsp; Getting caught up in the moment I moan into his mouth and hear him chuckle deep in his throat.&nbsp;&nbsp; He takes my hands placing them behind my back, then something cold, metallic snaps around my wrists.&nbsp; Coming to my senses I angrily pull away and hiss �Bastard!�

Laughing again he shakes his head �No, no my lady, I said not a word remember? This will be your only reminder or I will place the gag back in place, is that clear?� Shaking my head in understanding he continues.&nbsp; �That kiss was lovely my dear, simply lovely. I shall indeed enjoy the rest of tonight.�&nbsp; Stepping back towards me, his lips trailing soft kisses against mine, I whimper as his hands begin to explore my body.

His tender touch first sweeps over my shoulders and back, sliding to the base of my spine and up again. Then they travel to my collar bone. Feather light touches causing my skin to tingle.&nbsp; Gasping as I feel my body responding to this mans touch, trembling at the sensations beginning to spiral through me.&nbsp; My eyes dart to his as he fingers find my nipple and tenderly stroke it, causing it to stiffen further.&nbsp; Seeing a look of lust in his eyes I shiver unsure if it is it in fear or excitement.

Softly his fingers tease my nipple, stroking, pinching and tugging at the little bud until I am panting with emotion. His hand lazily crosses my chest and performs a similar treatment on my other breast.&nbsp; My eyes close as the pleasure of his touch sweeps through me. My brain tries desperately to bring my body back to its senses but my body does not heed its call. Jumping back as I feel his tongue lick my left nipple he encircles me gently in his right arm, holding me to him.&nbsp; His tongue laps at my nipple before drawing it into his mouth. My head falls back at the lovely sensations that sweep through my chest and abdomen.

Slowly his left hand travels down my stomach, my back arching into his touch.&nbsp; My mind is appalled at my actions but my body is wanting and full of need. His fingers trace patterns first along my ribs and then around my bellybutton before slipping lower.&nbsp; Tender caresses trace along my pelvic bone. My hips thrusting forward in response as his lips move to my right nipple licking and sucking gently.&nbsp; His hand descends further, brushing along the hair of my cleft, softly stroking the velvety smoothness.&nbsp; My hips press into his hand needing more.&nbsp; Once more I hear him chuckle as his head lifts from my breast.

�You are a needy little thing it seems my lady� Totally lost in the sensations he is causing I simply shake my head. His fingers continue to sweep lower over my body, softly, tenderly stoking my labia.&nbsp; Biting my lip and closing my eyes at the wonderful feelings his fingers create. I gasp as his mouth once more descends to mine.&nbsp; Pressing his tongue deeply he kisses me and I respond with desire.

His hand still traces along my labia, my hips wontingly pressing forward. Feeling his fingers part my lower lips as his strong digit searches for my little bud. I gasp into his mouth as his finger finds its target. Thrilling sensations of pleasure shooting through my abdomen and up through my spine.&nbsp; His finger presses, then rubs, and then flicks my clit over and over. My body coming alive with utter need.

His hand presses lower, into my opening.&nbsp; Chuckling once more he teases �My how wet you are my lady.� Wanting to deny this, my brain screams for my body to stop its betrayal. But I am to caught up, to enchanted with the feelings this stranger is causing and all I can do is shake my head yes.&nbsp; His finger continues stroking my little bud until a fire burns deep within my core. Burning the last of my resistance away.&nbsp; My whole body alights with the feelings his fingers create.

Whimpering as his touch retreats I open my eyes to look at him and he smiles down at me.&nbsp; �Now now my lady we must not get too excited must we? We still have a very long night ahead of us.�&nbsp; Shivering my eyes bore into his, knowing he sees the lust burning there and not caring. �Now it is your turn my lady� he says. As he steps back I am mesmerized as he shrugs from his jacket, laying it on a chair beside him.&nbsp; Somewhere in the back of my mind I hear a voice telling me to snap out of it but I don&#8217;t listen. My body is caught up in the feelings and the moment.

Next he unbuttons his shirt and I am thrilled at the sight of his naked flesh, his strong arms and muscular chest.&nbsp; Biting my lip I stare at his little male nipples and hear him chuckle once more �You like what you see my lady?�&nbsp; Opening my mouth to respond but remembering his instructions I simply shake my head. His smile is radiant as his fingers softly stroke over his left nipple �I am glad my dear.�&nbsp; �Now, your turn� he says �Of course with you hands bound you will have to be inventive and just use those lovely lips of yours.� He whispers with an impish grin.

Moving toward him, feeling suddenly embolden I press myself to this strange man.&nbsp; Feeling his nipples brush against mine as my lips sweep over first his right cheek and then his left, ascending to his ear.&nbsp; I tenderly nibble the flesh of his lobe hearing a gentle moan escape his lips. Realizing he is just as aroused as I.&nbsp; My lips travel back down his cheek to his neck. Kissing, licking, and nibbling as they go.&nbsp; His hands reach to encircle me softly, holding me closely.

Bending my head, my tongue traces along his breast bone. Then first to one little hard bud and then to the next, softly, tenderly licking at them.&nbsp; Hearing him moan once more, I press further taking his left nipple into my mouth. Sucking on it as my tongue laps over its surface, loving the feel of it between my lips.&nbsp; Luxuriating at the power I feel, I move slowly and bestow similar treatment to his other nipple.

Suddenly he steps back, placing his hands on my shoulders. �Enough lady, enough� he says. Wanting more, needing more I moan softly and he chuckles. �You have become a wonton little one haven&#8217;t you?� He asks. I shake my head in reply.&nbsp; �Now if I remove the cuffs do you promise to be a good girl my lady?� Nodding quickly he smiles at me and moves toward me. Going around behind me he unlocks the cuffs. Bringing my hands forward I rub each wrist to increase the flow of circulation.

Quickly he pulls me into his arms again, his eyes looking deeply into mine and says �I want you my lady, oh how I want you.�&nbsp; Thrilling at his words I press my lips to his, showing him, responding to him in unspoken words.&nbsp; His kiss quickly deepens as my hands lower to his belt buckle, releasing the strap and then tugging at the button and zipper.&nbsp; Briefly his hands move from my body as he slides his trousers and pants off over his hips and kicks them away with his foot.&nbsp; Now his whole body presses against me. I feel his stiff manhood pressing into my stomach and my hips press forward.

Slowly he walks me backward until I can feel the edge of my hard cold desk pressing against my thighs.&nbsp; �Sit up on the desk my dear, please.�&nbsp; Obeying without question or thought I slide my rear onto the desk. My legs wrap around him as he comes near, my feet locking behind his back.&nbsp; Laughingly he kisses me, his tongue sweeping through my mouth, as he presses back and forth. Wanting, needing him I respond, my whimpers of desire the only sound I make.

His left hand reaches between us and lowers his member until I can feel it pressing at my tightness.&nbsp; My hips shoot forward needing to feel him inside of me.&nbsp; The crown of his organ just pressing into my body. My sheath clenches, stretching to accept him as he plunges forward, burying himself inside. With slow easy strokes he moves, in and out of me, my muscles clenching and releasing with each stroke.&nbsp; Quickly the tempo increases as does my heart rate. My mouth now trailing kisses and bites along his shoulder as my need builds.&nbsp; His hands stroking down my back sending shivers down my spine.

Moaning he mutters, �Oh God little one, you feel so good,� and kisses me deeply once more.&nbsp; �I want to feel you cum for me little one; will you do that for me, hmmm?�&nbsp; Nodding my head I kiss him, my hips pumping, pressing forward into him.&nbsp; My hands trailing along his chest and up into his hair. Grinding my lips to his as his body continues to throb and pump inside of me.

Pulling back, his lips go to my ear and he whispers, �Cum for me little one, cum as I do.�&nbsp; His efforts, his hips pressing into mine, increase as I feel the pleasure spiraling out of control.&nbsp; Feeling his member thicken and extend my hips rock faster and harder in response. Our lips locking once more as we reach fulfillment together.&nbsp; Grasping, groaning into each others mouths.&nbsp; Cumming together as the power of the feeling and emotion spiraling through me, I fly. My brain alighting into the heavens.&nbsp; Our bodies locked together as we get lost in the ultimate sensations.

Slowly we come back down to earth and our movements slow.&nbsp; Tenderly we kiss each other, our tongues playing softly in our mouths.&nbsp; He sweeps me off my feet and takes me in his arms as he crosses the floor.&nbsp; He lays me down tenderly on my soft velvet couch.&nbsp; Sliding on beside me he takes me into his arms and says, �Did you enjoy yourself my lady?� Shaking my head &#8216;yes&#8217; against his chest I feel the ripples of a chuckle.

�You may speak now little one,� He whispers.&nbsp; �But one thing first.�&nbsp; I raise my head to look up at Him and our eyes meet.&nbsp; �You were supposed to play hard to get you little hussy.�&nbsp; Laughing I say, �Yes Master, but with You that is impossible.�
