A Taste of Honey

By Jeremy Binder

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

She thinks about last
night.

&nbsp;

The tender touch of his
tongue swirling delicately around her swollen clit forced her little organ�s
sensitized nerves to arouse her brain and circle back to further engorge her
clit.� She had no way to stop her brain
from sending these deafening signals.�
She was his captive.

You would think that someone who understands how to train young minds could
control her own, but she was sadly mistaken.�
He had warned her of this.

Her need climbs once more. �For hours, she
has strained against his restraints, and while her bonds provide safety and
comfort, her prison flourishes in her mind. �Her heart rate climbs and a thin layer of
perspiration glimmers across her soft, freckled flesh. �She grunts and groans her frustrated need
through clenched teeth.� Her breathing sounds
foreign to her.

&nbsp;

Jeremy draws circles
around her breasts causing Kate to tremble. �In turn, her breasts roll and jiggle with her
movements.� �Damn to be 20 again!� she
thinks.

Her body is stretched and helpless. �Somehow, Jeremy has raped her free will and
replaced it with terrible need. �His
tongue and hands dance closely to her erogenous centers bringing her closer and
closer to the edge, then slowing, driving her to lustful mindlessness.

&nbsp;

�I will beg him,� she
thinks, �as trite and ridiculous as that sounds, I know I will beg him.�� These thoughts unnerve her.

&nbsp;

This game of theirs that
they have been playing, experimenting with and perfecting, has transformed
their lovemaking to something neither anticipated.� Their ideas about being uninhibited were transposed
as they found themselves saying and doing things that they never imagined.� He had made her beg and scream.� He had made her do things she swore would
never happen, things that she could never admit to her friends.

&nbsp;

And here there were
again.� Jeremy stripping away another
layer of her will.� All Kate can think
about is cumming.� Yet, she knows that
will not happen.� Not now anyway.

&nbsp;

~~~~~


It was late Sunday morning when Jeremy drew back the curtains. �Kate�s naked body washed with the golden
light. �She lay upon creamy ivory sheets
with the coverlet folded neatly at the foot of the bed. �Her back, turned to the window, formed a
perfect curve soft white flesh.� Her sun-flecked
hair swept along her cheek and neck. �Her
breasts and belly swayed with each long sleepy breath.� Kate�s face looked younger than her years,
almost childlike.� She had an innocence
about her.� Her nose sloped gently to her
smiling lips; her perfectly shaped eyebrows neatly framed her eyes; her lashes
were long and brilliant and perfectly curved.�
They were long and soft enough to tickle her lover�s skin. �Her eyes opened, reluctantly batting away the
sunlight streaming into the room.� Even
in her half-asleep state, her eyes carried all her mystery, innocence, and
curiosity. �Her lips were sensual, moist
and swollen, as if they had been sucked upon.

Kate moved her fingertips and stretched her limbs to caress the softness of the
smooth cotton sheets. �When she turned,
her thighs parted to reveal soft white folds that fit perfectly with her waist and
torso.� Jeremy strained to see her
intimate creases, swollen from another night in which her dreams flooded with
sweet fantasies of absolute denial. �Even
now, her thoughts waxed and waned with her breathing.� As she stretched, she was reminded of the
joyous torment she felt when he secured her tightly to their bed.� Her limbs moved slightly, the soft cotton
brushing against her skin caressing her bright pink nipples, tantalizing her
nakedness. �Kate smiled.� Morning�s delicious ritual was upon her.

She looked with languid eyes at Jeremy standing by the window, the man whose
fingertips would touch her and stir her skin to a delicious ache of pleasure. �Already Kate could feel the gentle throb of
anticipation between her outspread thighs. �Jeremy came and sat beside her, laying his
fingertips upon the pale white skin of her belly. �Kate lifted her arms and placed them beneath
the pillow, as Jeremy had asked her to do many times.� He smiled. �His fingertips tickled lightly on the smooth
bare skin of her underarms, and Kate closed her eyes. �The smoothness of her skin was unlike any he
had felt. �He leaned closer to touch his lips
against her tender underarm skin and kissed, tasted and tickled with his tongue
very slowly.

Jeremy loved to brush his lips against her and bring her pleasure.� They were experimenting to see how far and
for how long he could keep her in a state of pleasured tension.� Even after they played, Kate�s fantasies
filled each waking moment and filtered into her dreams.� There was a purpose to this endless pleasured
torturing of Kate's perfect flesh, but neither of them could fully understand
or describe it.

&nbsp;

�Kate, my love,� Jeremy
finally spoke, stroking her cheek.� �How
did you sleep?�� He smiled knowingly.

Kate nodded.� �I slept well, thank you,�
she answered with her silky morning voice. �She shined her eyes upon him, as he continued
to caress her, tracing the line of her lips until they parted.� Kate closed her eyes.

Jeremy slid his fingertips to coax Kate's willing nipples. �She opened her eyes as he slid the covers down
to further reveal her.� Although he had
beheld this vision many times before, he was forced to catch his breath at the
picture of her freckle-flecked nakedness.�
His gaze slid past her arms, stomach and waist to the delicate
smoothness of her sex.� Kate�s outer lips
were swollen from another weekend of teasing and formed a shield through which
her inner lips fought for attention.� Jeremy
allowed his fingertips to graze their satin softness and brush into her
smoothly polished creases, and as Kate murmured, Jeremy shivered. �Kate absentmindedly pulled her thighs together
then, thinking better of it, held them apart. �She closed her eyes and sank into the
pleasurable tingling.

&nbsp;

�You are so delicious,� whispered
Jeremy, as he continued his gentle sexual arousal.

He lay next to her, stroking her hair from here face and kissing each newly
uncovered spot.� His lips and tongue
tickled her ear, as he traced a line to her neck, layering gentle kisses on
each freckled parcel.� Kate felt the slow
delicious rhythm pulling into her belly.�
She felt his soft warm breath upon her skin and his hand molding around
her breast, lifting and squeezing as if to size and measure.� Jeremy�s fingers drifted to Kate's large
nipples, circling one and then the other, grabbing each in his fingertips to
test their elasticity and attachment.� He
dragged his touch across the smoothness of her belly and as her slim thighs
opened he reached between to rub the smooth pad of flesh surrounding the prize
of her body.� He licked his fingertips,
wetting them to separate her lips and work her growing wetness until she began
to move her hips. �He remoistened his
fingers and stroked her silk until her clit was swimming, and her scent filled
the room.� Jeremy crawled between Kate�s
legs and worked his lips very lightly around the bud between her thighs.� He sucked until Kate whimpered, then he stopped
to observe her movements.

&nbsp;

After a brief pause, Jeremy
sucked again, this time more diligently, bathing the full length of Kate�s clit
and hood with his moist tongue.

&nbsp;

�Not yet,� he whispered.� And he sucked and licked with purpose until Kate
gasped and cried out on the verge of pleasure.�
He stopped once more.

&nbsp;

Jeremy rose from the bed
and retrieved the fleece-lined leather cuffs that remained attached to the four
bedposts.� He first spread Kate�s thighs
and secured her ankles to the bottom posts. �He readjusted their tension until the edges of
her sex lips pulled free of each other�s stickiness.� When satisfied, he silently asked her for her
wrists and spread her wrists, attaching them to the top of the bed.

&nbsp;

Jeremy climbed onto the
bed and again knelt between Kate�s thighs, stroking a single finger from her
belly button across her pubic bone and into the pink, smooth mouth of her
vagina.� He dragged his finger upward,
catching his fingertip on the interior of her hood, until she gasped.

&nbsp;

Jeremy reached to the
nightstand for a small bowl filled with honey and a tiny paintbrush.� He first used the dry brush, stroking it back
and forth across Kate�s swollen lips in a gentle dusting action. �Then, he coated the brush with honey and
delicately painted the inside of her hood, paying special attention to
completely cover her hard, pink nubbin.�
He returned the brush to the bowl, crawled back between her legs and
licked her silently until he could no longer taste a breath of honey.

&nbsp;

He did this a dozen times,
each repetition pushing Kate closer and closer to explosion and release.� Sheer panic overwhelmed her thoughts, as she
pictured the tiny brush�s inadequate ability to carry enough honey to her
neediness.� She gasped with ragged breath
and cried violently and incoherently with each parting between Jeremy�s lips
and her arousal.

&nbsp;

Jeremy placed a pillow beneath
Kate�s hips to raise and help separate the flesh between her thighs.� The motion pulled her ankles even more
securely to the foot of the bed. �Kate
swallowed hard and gasped as she felt his hardness enter her.� He slipped slowly and gently inside her, so
that both could feel the full force of entry.�
Again and again, he slid as deeply as he could and pulled back until
only his cock head rested inside her greedy lips.� He licked his thumb and placed it gently
across her clit and rubbed rhythmically back and forth as he pushed
purposefully inside her.� His movements
became more urgent with each stroke.� She
feared the look in his eyes and prayed that he did not forget his promise.� She knew him to become indifferent to her
plight after he orgasmed.

&nbsp;

Kate felt her passion
build.� She focused steadily on his thumb
and fingers playing her, as he thrust his cock passionately in and out of her
vagina.� The tightness in her belly was
overwhelming but trivial compared to the mindless urgency spinning through her
mind.� She felt completely out of
control.� A voice she recognized as her
own begged and pleaded with him to help her, to please help her.

&nbsp;

Despite his desire, he withdrew
completely from her and crawled back between her outstretched legs to find her
with his lips and tongue.� He bathed her
clit with kisses before grabbing hold firmly and rubbing his tongue against her
soaking clit.� He gently bit down on her
outer casing and rubbed violently against her swollen nerves until she shrieked
and convulsed onto his tongue.� He sucked
fervently until he felt she could tolerate no more and then lessened his
intensity finally into a gentle bath between her lips.

&nbsp;

He crawled on top of her
and reached for her open mouth with his.�
He took her mouth with his and slid his rock hard cock fully inside her,
pumping smoothly until he too exploded as she gripped him tightly.� Then, he expelled a breath of tension and
collapsed on top of her.� Rolling to her
side, he gently stroked her stomach.�
Kate�s eyes were still glazed.�
The intensity of her orgasm rolled through her, gradually subsiding into
the deepest peacefulness.� She wanted
grab him and fully intertwine her body with his, but her bonds were intolerant.

&nbsp;

�Was that any good for
you, Baby?�

&nbsp;

Kate had a thousand
things to say, but could only muster a smile.

&nbsp;

The End
