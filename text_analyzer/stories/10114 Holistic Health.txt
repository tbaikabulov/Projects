&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Holistic Health
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was jogging, wearing my hair in a pony tail, with my new
pink jogging togs, my almost new Reboks, and my faithful Walkman
for company.&nbsp; Usually, I just do a couple circuits of the park,
but for some reason, yesterday I went down an unfamiliar side
street.&nbsp; It was broad daylight; I didn't fell unsafe.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a funny little store, The Holistic Health Store. 
There were, as I expected, window displays of fruit juice drinks,
herbal teas, bran cookies, that sort of thing, but what caught my
eye was a huge color illustration of the human digestive tract,
like in a medical text, or something.&nbsp; On a whim, I went in.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A gray haired old man greeted me: "Can I help you, madame?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Uh, do you have some no-fat yogurt?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, of course."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I bought one, lemon flavor, took a plastic spoon, and ate
the stuff while I wandered around the store.&nbsp; It was weird.&nbsp; Most
health food stores are bright and clean.&nbsp; This place looked like
an alchemist's shop, with funny colored glass jars and drawers
full of dried up leaves and bark.&nbsp; There was even a stuffed
alligator hanging from the ceiling.&nbsp; Toward the back, there was a
closed door, with a little sign: "Madame Metamora, consultations
and healing."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's this?" I asked.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We offer special services, available nowhere else in the
city," the man replied, "special herbal remedies, instruction in
mystical Eastern healing practices, free consultations about any
illness which may concern you."&nbsp; He looked me up and down.&nbsp; "You
look pretty healthy, but tell me, have you ever worried about
cancer?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't how he knew.&nbsp; "My father died of colon cancer," I
said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It runs in families.&nbsp; May I suggest a consultation?&nbsp; It's
free."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I went in.&nbsp; A woman in a sari, with a red spot on her
forehead, greeted me and bolted the door behind me.&nbsp; "The medical
doctors have not cured your ills," she said.&nbsp; "They do not
understand the discomforts of women.&nbsp; How could they?&nbsp; But I can
bring you the wisdom of the East, timeless remedies which have
stood the test of centuries.&nbsp; You are concerned that you may be
at risk of colon cancer, is that not so?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," I said.&nbsp; She probably had some way to hear my
conversation with the old man.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have a sure preventative."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is that?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A special herbal remedy, all natural ingredients, mixed
with fine Arabian coffee."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How much does it cost?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You may think it costly, but, for you, I will give you the
first treatment free."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I never could pass up something that's free.&nbsp; The
woman loaded up a percolator with coffee and a mixture of brown
and green and yellow powders.&nbsp; While the brew dripped through,
she told me what to do.&nbsp; "The medicine must be applied at the
site of the cancer," she said, "so it will have to be
administered rectally."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Whoa, wait a minute," I said.&nbsp; "I didn't plan on that."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But it is necessary.&nbsp; There is nothing to fear.&nbsp; I give
many treatments, every day, to dozens of satisfied customers."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, she talked me into it.&nbsp; Next thing I knew I was in
another room, kind of like a big shower stall, with a tile floor
and walls, drains in the floor, dials and wheels and hoses
hanging from the walls.&nbsp; She had me undressed and on my elbows
and knees on a kind of padded bench, with my rump in the air. 
Next thing I knew, she was lubricating my anus and inserting an
enema tip.&nbsp; "We have to clean you out, first," she said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think I've ever had an enema.&nbsp; We didn't do that
sort of thing in my family.&nbsp; It won't hurt, will it?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No pain, no gain," she replied.&nbsp; She pumped on a little
rubber bulb, and I could feel something swelling up inside me.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's that?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just a little thing like a balloon, to hold the tip in.&nbsp; I
think, perhaps, we had better take precautions against accident. 
We can't have you falling and hurting yourself."&nbsp; Before I knew
it, she had me fastened down, with soft straps, fastened with
Velcro.&nbsp; My elbows and knees were stuck to the plastic pad.&nbsp; I
could rock back and forth, but I couldn't get up.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I could feel warm fluid running into me, feel a kind of
warmth in my belly which wasn't unpleasant at all.&nbsp; I looked back
and saw Madame Metamora putting on a huge rubber apron that
covered her from her chin to her feet.&nbsp; "Yes, we must be sure
that you are properly cleaned out, before we use the expensive
herbs."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know how long it took, but I began to feel full, as
if I just had to go sit on a toilet.&nbsp; Madame Metamora put one
hand on my back and the other on my belly, below the navel, and
seemed to be evaluating the progress of the fluid.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Uh, it's beginning to hurt," I said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The bitter medicine is best."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah. My insides are stretching.&nbsp; I'm going to explode." 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," she said, and she yanked the hose out of me.&nbsp; There
was a great whoosh of brown stuff, like meatball soup, which
sprayed across the room and ran down the tile walls.&nbsp; I felt a
great sense of relief, as if I had just given birth, almost.&nbsp; It
felt so good to be rid of that great swelling within me.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, before I knew what had happened, Madame put the hose
back inside me and pumped up the little balloon even bigger than
before.&nbsp; I rocked forward on my elbows and rested my face against
the cool plastic, conscious of the plastic against my breasts,
and the smell of my own excrement.&nbsp; "How much longer does this go
on?" I pleaded.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Until you are cleaned of foul impurities, until the water
comes clear."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I waited, feeling the not unpleasant warmth of water running
into me, but anxious, because I knew now that it would begin to
hurt.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Madame Metamora hosed down the walls and floor
with a soapy spray, until all the filthy brown stuff had run down
the drain in the floor.&nbsp; All I could smell was the soap.&nbsp; I began
to feel my belly swelling, began to feel strange sensations,
gurglings within me, the stretching of my bowels.&nbsp; It was
painful, but not painful, this time.&nbsp; The feelings were intense,
but I could handle them.&nbsp; I wondered if being pregnant, going
into labor, might feel something like this.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She released the air from the balloon, and again I expelled
a great stream of water, cleaner this time.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, my dear," she said, "you certainly needed a treatment. 
You were full of dirt.&nbsp; Dirt equals disease."&nbsp; Again, she
inserted the hose, pumped up the balloon.&nbsp; Perhaps she was
impatient; she turned up the volume.&nbsp; The warm liquid gushed into
me this time, raping my rectum, making me gasp at the sensations
which it set off in my body.&nbsp; I could feel it, like a tidal wave
rushing up my bowel, swooshing around each bend, filling me,
filling me.&nbsp; Almost too soon, Madame removed the hose, and clear
water gushed from me.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She hosed off the walls and floor and used a gentle spray to
clean me off, plying the spray over my buttocks.&nbsp; "Are you
finished?" I said, almost hoping she wasn't.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have just begun," she replied.&nbsp; She went into the other
room and returned with a decanter of coffee in a bowl of ice. 
From time to time, she tested the temperature with a drop on her
wrist, until she was satisfied.&nbsp; Then she poured the whole pot
into a rubber bag.&nbsp; "Ready?" she said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt the nozzle being pushed into me, almost like a lover
penetrating my body.&nbsp; I felt the balloon swelling up inside me,
stretching my anal sphincters and sending little thrills through
my abdomen.&nbsp; Warm liquid began to fill my clean insides.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I cannot describe the feeling which came over me.&nbsp; Surely,
the caffeine in the coffee could not account for the degree of
excitement I felt.&nbsp; My heart raced, and I felt myself perspiring.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know how long that went on.&nbsp; I was in a strange,
almost spiritual state, a feeling of excitement but with no real
focus.&nbsp; Madame Metamora stood by, with yet another hose in her
hand.&nbsp; It had a big, black nozzle.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you feel the effects of the healing herbs?" she said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mmmmm. yes."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the new hose, I felt warm water running across my
backside, running down the crack between my cheeks.&nbsp; Then I felt
Madame direct the flow of water so that it splashed on my vulva. 
The pressure of the flow gently parted the labia.&nbsp; In my almost
drugged state, I did not object.&nbsp; Warm water from the hose
flooded my vulva, washing my sensitive membranes.&nbsp; My mind went
all crazy as my attention fluttered between the warmth filling my
abdomen and the warmth tickling my femininity.&nbsp; And then the
water began to come in little spurts, buzz, buzz, buzz, and it
splashed right against my clitoris.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I rose as high as I could on my elbows and knees, looked
back between my hanging breasts to see Madame's dark hands
holding that big, black nozzle.&nbsp; The water gushed in sharp spurts,
splashing against me, and every spurt tingled like a lover's
tongue.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh. Oh. Ahh. Ummm," I babbled, as the electrifying splashes
brought me closer and closer to an orgasm.&nbsp; "Oh, oh!&nbsp; I can't
stand it!"&nbsp; I threw myself backward, taking the black spurter
into my body.&nbsp; Warm water hammered on my womb, filled my vagina,
and I shuddered in indescribable ecstacy.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was not the end of the treatment, nor the last of the
ecstacy, but I haven't the words to describe what happened.&nbsp; Even
after I had been drained and cleaned out for the last time, and
had a rest, I still felt high.&nbsp; I walked home in a daze, took a
short nap, and ate twice as much as I should have for dinner.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brian called, but I told him I couldn't go out tomorrow
night; I have a previous appointment.&nbsp; I do, with Madame
Metamora.
