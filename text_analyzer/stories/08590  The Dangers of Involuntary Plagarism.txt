Synopsis:      A student accidentally plagarizes and is given an alternative to expulsion.






Sophia packed her bookbag slowly.&nbsp; History was her last class of the day and she always liked to linger for a final glance at the Professor.&nbsp; She looked back to the stage and sighed, watching him furrow his brow at some papers on the lectern.&nbsp; Hoisting her bag on her shoulder, Sophia started toward the door.&nbsp; �One moment, Miss Smith,� he called after her in his intoxicating British accent.&nbsp; She froze with pounding heart and quivering legs.&nbsp; Breathing deeply, she turned and approached the stage.&nbsp; He had been her secret crush since she had first seen him.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t need his course but found herself drawn to him with the speechless infatuation of a much younger girl.
�Yes Professor,� she questioned in a soft voice.
She felt his piercing gaze as he paused for a moment.&nbsp; �Follow me to my office,� he stated as he climbed down from the stage and walked briskly to the back of the auditorium.&nbsp; Sophia hurried to keep up with him, stumbling and panting as they went through the hallways and stairwells, finally reaching his office in the basement of the ancient creaking building.&nbsp; 
They entered his office.&nbsp; �What could he want?� she wondered as he closed the door.
�Sit,� he commanded as he moved behind his desk.&nbsp; She sat in a straight-backed wooden chair, placing her hands in her lap, trying to stop from shaking.&nbsp; The Professor could turn her into a pike of jelly when she was removed by distance in the classroom.&nbsp; Sitting mere feet away from him, in his office, was almost too much for her.&nbsp; He looked at her as if staring into her very marrow.&nbsp; The silence made her uncomfortable.&nbsp; �Well, Sophia,� he finally spoke, �it appears we have a problem.�
�We do?�&nbsp; Sophia was puzzled.&nbsp; She prided herself on being a very good student&#8212;both bright and determined.&nbsp; 
�Yes.&nbsp; We do.�&nbsp; He paused again before pulling an essay out of his briefcase.&nbsp; He laid it on the desk, facing her.&nbsp; �Does this look familiar?�
�Well�yes.&nbsp; That&#8217;s my final essay.�&nbsp; She was even more puzzled now.&nbsp; She had thought it was some of her best work.&nbsp; She had worked extra hard; she wanted desperately to impress him.
�You are aware of the school policy on plagarism, are you not?�
She was shocked.&nbsp; �Well, of course�Are you suggesting that my work is not my own?�
�Not only am I suggesting it, Miss Smith, I am declaring it flat out to be so.�&nbsp; Sophia was beyond shock.&nbsp; She was outraged.
�This is unbelievable.&nbsp; This work is my own and I challenge you&#8212;no I dare you&#8212;to prove otherwise.�&nbsp; Her voice trembled with anger as she rose to her feet, hands on his desk, leaning forward.
�Sit down, Miss Smith,� he said calmly.
�No!&nbsp; I will not.&nbsp; Prove your claims or I am walking out of this office right now and going to the provost to complain.�&nbsp; Her face was red with fury.
�Sophia.&nbsp; Sit.&nbsp; And I will show you my proof.�&nbsp; She reluctantly obeyed.&nbsp; �It is this passage, here, on page eight.�&nbsp; He pointed to the marked passage, pushing the paper toward her.&nbsp; �I know these are not your ideas because they are mine.&nbsp; You copied from one of my journal articles.�
�But�Oh�� she scanned the passage.&nbsp; �I see the problem.&nbsp; I always do my footnotes after I write.&nbsp; I just forgot to cite it.�&nbsp; She breathed a sigh of relief and turned pink from embarrassment while remembering her previous tantrum.&nbsp; 
�But can you prove that you weren&#8217;t just trying to get away with something?� He shook his head from side to side.&nbsp; �It doesn&#8217;t look good, Sophia.&nbsp; Not good at all.�
�But, I mean, if I were going to cheat on an essay, don&#8217;t you think I would be smart enough to copy off someone other than my professor?�
�I suppose.&nbsp; But it still doesn&#8217;t look good.�
�Wait.&nbsp; You do believe me�don&#8217;t you?�&nbsp; Sophia started faltering once again.&nbsp; She was beginning to worry.
�The question isn&#8217;t whether I believe you or not.&nbsp; Will the council on academic honesty believe you?&nbsp; I think that is the real question.�
�But�I could be kicked out of school&#8212;all for an oversight!&nbsp; Even if they cleared me, there would be a record of the inquest.&nbsp; It could ruin me!�
�Well,� he pulled the paper from her hands and placed it within his briefcase once again, �I&#8217;m afraid I have no choice but to report this.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry Sophia.&nbsp; Now, if you could please remove yourself, I have some important business to take care of.�
�Please,� she was on the verge of tears, �please�I&#8217;m begging you.&nbsp; Please have mercy.&nbsp; Please don&#8217;t do this to me.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll do anything.&nbsp; I swear.&nbsp; Just please don&#8217;t do this.�&nbsp; She was now crying softly into her hands and couldn&#8217;t see the small smile forming on his lips.
�Well�there might be something��
Sophia looked at him through blurry hopeful eyes.&nbsp; �Really?&nbsp; What?�
�Well, I&#8217;m not quite sure as of yet.&nbsp; I need to give it some thought.�&nbsp; He pulled out a notepad and a pen, scribbled an address, and handed it to her.&nbsp; �Show up at this address tonight.&nbsp; Seven p.m. sharp.&nbsp; Do not be late.&nbsp; Now if you will excuse me.�&nbsp; He dismissed her with a gesture and bent over a pile of papers on his desk.&nbsp; Sophia slung her bag on her shoulder and walked out the office, closing the door behind her, feeling emotionally drained and monumentally confused.
***
Sophia approached the house nervously, glancing at her watch.&nbsp; It was 6:58.&nbsp; She was two minutes early.&nbsp; Ever since she had left the Professor&#8217;s office she had been unable to concentrate on anything.&nbsp; Why did he want her to come to his house?&nbsp; Maybe he would be willing to give her a reprieve if she had sex with him.&nbsp; This recurring thought made her chuckle considering that he was her most common midnight fantasy.&nbsp; She straightened her blouse, ran her fingers through her wavy brown hair, and rang the doorbell.&nbsp; After waiting for what seemed an eternity, he opened the door, ushering her inside without a word.
She was nervous and fidgeted with her skirt, feeling uncomfortable in the silence.&nbsp; She followed him into the library.&nbsp; He gestured to the couch and said, �Have a seat.�&nbsp; Sophia sat.&nbsp; �Would you like a glass of wine?�
�Um, yes,� she responded, watching his 6&#8217;4 frame move to the bar and back to her.&nbsp; As she took the glass she gasped at how he towered over her in her seated position.&nbsp; He chose to sit in the large reading chair opposite her as they sipped their wine in silence.
�So, I imagine you&#8217;re wondering why I asked you to come here tonight, aren&#8217;t you?�
�Very much so.�
�Well, I&#8217;ve given it some thought.&nbsp; You have two choices.&nbsp; One: you can leave right now and I will report your academic dishonesty to the college, most likely resulting in expulsion.�&nbsp; Sophia gulped audibly.&nbsp; �Or two: you can stay here and do whatever I ask.&nbsp; In this case I will not report you, though I will hold onto the essay as collateral.&nbsp; If you fail in your side of the agreement, I will not hesitate to bring your unfortunate actions to light.&nbsp; What is your decision.�
Sophia looked as if she had been struck.&nbsp; �Wha&#8212;what do you mean�whatever you ask?�
�I mean just that.&nbsp; This is a black or white arrangement.&nbsp; It is not conditional.&nbsp; So what I will ask is inconsequential.�&nbsp; The girl just sat there, dumbfounded, completely at a loss for words.&nbsp; �Well.&nbsp; What is your decision?&nbsp; Do you want to be expelled?�
�No. Of course not.�
�You asked me to have mercy on you.&nbsp; This is my mercy.&nbsp; You said you would do anything.&nbsp; Were you dishonest?�
�No.&nbsp; I�I wasn&#8217;t.&nbsp; Please, just give me�a moment�I don&#8217;t want�I don&#8217;t want to be expelled�but��
�Nevermind.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve changed my mind anyway.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll just take this to the committee tomorrow morning.&nbsp; Finish your wine and leave.�&nbsp; He stood up and started walking toward the door.
�No!&nbsp; Wait.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; I agree.&nbsp; I will do whatever you ask.&nbsp; Just please don&#8217;t turn me in.�&nbsp; She had jumped to her feet and was staring at his back as he slowly turned around.
�Finish your wine,� he ordered.&nbsp; She started to sit.&nbsp; �No.&nbsp; Stay standing.&nbsp; And do not say a word.�&nbsp; Her insides trembled with fear and apprehension as she started to gulp the rest of her glass.&nbsp; What could he have in mind?&nbsp; �Slowly,� he added and walked toward her.&nbsp; As she stood in the middle of the room, he circled her as if she was his prey.&nbsp; When she had finished her wine, he took the glass from her hand and ordered her to kneel.
Sophia fought the instinct to flee and very slowly knelt in front of him.&nbsp; He walked to his chair and sat down, staring at her.&nbsp; �Spread your legs.&nbsp; Wider.&nbsp; Lock your fingers together behind your head.�&nbsp; She did all of these things, the humiliation spreading throughout her.&nbsp; Her skirt was short enough and her legs spread wide enough that he could certainly see her white lace panties.&nbsp; She could feel her breasts pushing against her shirt.&nbsp; With great embarrassment she realized her nipples were hardening and she briefly glanced down to see if they were protruding through her thin bra.&nbsp; Her face flushed as she saw that they were.&nbsp; �Keep your eyes forward.&nbsp; Did I tell you to look at those naughty little nipples of yours?�&nbsp; She couldn&#8217;t believe he was talking to her like this.&nbsp; �I think you need to be taught a lesson.�
�Oh God.&nbsp; What is next?� she wondered with a shudder.
�You may lower your arms.&nbsp; Good.&nbsp; Now remove your shirt and your bra and toss them to me.�&nbsp; Sophia was simply mortified and simply sat there, looking at him, thinking that he couldn&#8217;t be serious.&nbsp; �Do not make me repeat myself.�&nbsp; Reluctantly, she did as he asked, then instinctively crossed her arms over her rather large pert breasts.&nbsp; �Now.&nbsp; Keep your eyes straight ahead while you play with your nipples.&nbsp; I want to see you pinching and twisting them.&nbsp; Continue until I say.�
She did as directed while he poured himself another glass of wine and watched her face go from the flush of humiliation to the flush of desire, knowing that this desire would be humiliating as well.&nbsp; He stopped her when he heard the first smallest whimper of a moan escape her lips.&nbsp; �Now stand and remove the rest of your clothes.&nbsp; Again, you will toss them to me.�&nbsp; Sophia slowly stood and removed her skirt and panties with shaking hands, tossing them into his lap.&nbsp; �Now, hands behind your head again and spread your legs.&nbsp; Wider.&nbsp; Wider still.&nbsp; Good.�&nbsp; She knew better than to look anywhere than straight ahead.&nbsp; He examined her panties.&nbsp; They smelled of her sex and were almost sopping with her juices.&nbsp; He stood and walked to her.&nbsp; Her humiliations had barely begun.
�Well.&nbsp; It looks like you enjoy being told what to do, don&#8217;t you?&nbsp; Well?�
�I&#8212;I don&#8217;t know,� she whispered.
�You don&#8217;t know?&nbsp; Well, can you feel this?&nbsp; Smell this?� he asked as he wiped the wettest part of her panty across her face.&nbsp; Tears welled in her eyes.&nbsp; �Well.�
�Yes,� she almost sobbed.
�You shall refer to me as Master.&nbsp; So let&#8217;s try this again.&nbsp; Do you enjoy this little game we&#8217;re playing?�
�Yes Master.�
�Good.&nbsp; Because we have barely even begun to begin.�&nbsp; He moved to his chair again and let her stand there, feeling his eyes rove over her before ordering her to come to him.&nbsp; �Bend over my knee.&nbsp; It&#8217;s time you find out how we punish bad students.�&nbsp; Sophia felt her resolve stiffen at this thought.&nbsp; It was bad enough being naked in front of him, but this was taking things too far.&nbsp; 
�No,� she said with a false courage, tossing her hair back.
�No?� he questioned, smiling at her for the first time.&nbsp; �So we&#8217;ve decided to be rebellious, have we?�&nbsp; He chuckled.&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t believe you have the luxury of no.&nbsp; And you know that, don&#8217;t you?�
She felt her courage failing, but was determined to stand her ground.&nbsp; �You can&#8217;t do this.&nbsp; You can&#8217;t make me.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll go to the authorities.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll tell them what you made me do.&nbsp; What you want to do.&nbsp; How you&#8217;re blackmailing me into being your&#8212;your&#8212;I don&#8217;t even know what!�
�Really?&nbsp; Is that so?&nbsp; The problem is that nobody will believe you.&nbsp; They&#8217;ll just say that you&#8217;re trying to discredit me in order to get away with cheating.&nbsp; If you did that, you would lose any remaining sympathies and just make things worse on yourself.�&nbsp; He smiled as her expression changed from defiance to pitiful resignation.&nbsp; �Now.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s try this again.&nbsp; You were always so keen to impress me in class.&nbsp; You seemed to want my attention.&nbsp; Well, now you have it.&nbsp; So impress me.&nbsp; Bend over my knee.&nbsp; Now.�
Sophia took a deep breath, trying to stall for time, trying to think of some way out.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t working and she didn&#8217;t want to anger him any more than she had already.&nbsp; Slowly, she walked toward him and bent herself over his knees.&nbsp; All of a sudden, she felt off balance and more vulnerable than she ever had in her life.&nbsp; He gently rubbed her ass, kneading the flesh, as his fingers would dart from time to time between her legs.&nbsp; She started to whimper softly and then he struck, leaving a red hand print on her cheeks.&nbsp; She squealed and he laughed.&nbsp; �Oh yes, girl, we are going to have a lot of fun.&nbsp; Now, make sure you count out loud for me.&nbsp; But not a word otherwise.�&nbsp; He continued massaging her ass and spanking her until he reached the count of twenty.&nbsp; By this time, she was nearly in tears and her ass glowed red.&nbsp; 
He would have continued, but his hand was starting to hurt.&nbsp; He decided to have a different kind of fun with her.&nbsp; Slipping his hand between her legs, he forced them apart and felt her pussy.&nbsp; She was even wetter than before.&nbsp; �Well, well, it looks like you enjoyed your punishment, didn&#8217;t you?�
�No,� she sobbed.
�Wrong answer.�&nbsp; He spanked her once again.&nbsp; �Your mouth might lie, but your pussy tells the truth.&nbsp; So, you enjoyed your punishment didn&#8217;t you?�
�Yes Master.� She was trembling under his hands as he continued to massage her inner thighs, teasing her pussy and clit with his strong nimble fingers.&nbsp; He continued to manipulate her desire as her face flushed.&nbsp; This would be the greatest indignity yet.&nbsp; He was using her and abusing her, and here she was, getting turned on and close to cumming.&nbsp; �My God,� she thought as she realized how close she really was and how much she really wanted it, when he stopped.&nbsp; �Nooo�� she moaned.
�What was that?�
�Please�please��
�Please what?�
�Please don&#8217;t stop.�
�Why not?&nbsp; Tell me what you want.�
�Please��
�What do you want?&nbsp; Beg.�
She was red with desire and humiliation.&nbsp; He was forcing her to want this while simultaneously forcing her to beg for it.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t know if she could handle this anymore.&nbsp; He had renewed his interest in her pussy and she moaned once more.&nbsp; �Well?� he asked.
�Please Master�please�I need to cum�please let me cum�I need it so badly Master.�&nbsp; He smiled as he played with her, bringing her closer and closer to climax.&nbsp; �Oh�oh�yes�� she was gasping and moaning as she came right to the point of orgasm when he stopped suddenly and spanked her ass once more.&nbsp; Sophia let out a primal scream of frustration and disappointment as he laughed at her.
�I never told you that I would let you, now did I?&nbsp; Just because you ask does not mean that I will oblige.&nbsp; Get used to this feeling.&nbsp; You&#8217;re going to be frustrated a lot.&nbsp; I, however, will not be.&nbsp; So, on your knees.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know how skilled you are at sucking cock, but, trust me, you will learn.�
