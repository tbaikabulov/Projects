Authors Comment

&nbsp;

Terry Pratchet, one of my favourite
authors, once wrote of Discworld that it offered him a wide scope for storyline
and characters.� Unlike other writers, if
he wants to write a detective novel, a romance, a science fiction fantasy, or
ghost story, all that he has do to is set it on the Disc. There he can
introduce new characters, plots, or anything else, without alienating his loyal
fan base.� After all he has an entire world
to play with.� So, if the Discworld works
for comedy, tragedy, armies, thieves (As long as their membership to the guild
is fully paid up.), lovers and trolls, wouldn�t it work just as well for the
fetish writer?� After all, the Patricians
Palace does boast the most modern, well maintained and deepest, darkest dungeon
this side of the hub?

&nbsp;

Now if you will excuse me I am just off to
pack.� Ankh Morpork awaits.

&nbsp;

� A
Fitting Mount

&nbsp;

Death walked across his yard towards the
stables.� He walked with a purposeful
stride that could best be described as ominous, accompanied by the click clack
of bone on cobbles.� In his hand he
carried a scythe, while in his other he clutched a number of large hour
glasses.� As was fitting, he wore a black
cloak and hood, joined at the shoulder with a golden clasp depicting the letter
omega.� Blue eyes shone from underneath
the hood, like twin lamps of sapphire.

&nbsp;

This scene would, to the casual observer,
appear to be out of character with the surroundings.� Deaths domain consisted of, to the naked eye,
a picturesque cottage, with a beautifully maintained rose garden.� The garden also boasted a tree, complete with
childs swing, a pond and an expansive lawn.� A range of mountains acted as a back drop to
this charming schene.� 

&nbsp;

Closer inspection would reveal that, the
roses were all black.� Although a swing
hung from the tree, no rope secured it to the branch.� If one was to spend a pleasant day walking towards
the mountains, one would find that, upon arrival, the rocks lacked depth, or
substance, like an oil painting where it is obvious that, when viewed from half
a room away, you are looking at a mountain, but when you examine the picture
more closely you can not tell what the various blobs and blotches mean.� Walking into the house one discovers that,
rather than quaint, comfortable little rooms, strewn with lacy furniture, dark
wooden tables and stone fire places, they are in fact, unnervingly infinite.

&nbsp;

Alfred, Deaths servant, stood holding
Deaths horse.� Alfred had worked for the
Master for centuries.� At first sight,
the same casual observer who enjoys walking in the mountains,
would be excused for thinking that Alfred was a particularly grumpy and set in
his ways.� He would think that here was
an example of someone who looked so old and unwell that they had only a short
time to live.� They would be right on all
counts.� Alfred only had two days, twenty
seven minutes and fifty four seconds of life left in his hour glass.� He does not, therefore, visit the mortal
plane as often as he used to.

�THANK YOU ALFRED,� Deaths voice boomed
with the finality of tomb door closing, as he took the rains of his horse,
placed the hour glasses into the horses saddle bags, the scythe into a special
holder on the rear of the saddle and levered himself onto his steed.

&nbsp;

Temple depictions of Deaths horse would
have you believe that Death rode a mount as skeletal as its owner, breathing
fire from its nostrils and fixing you with its menacing blue glowing coals for
eyes.� To be fair, Death had tried to riding
one, but it was not very comfortable and a skeletal horse would tend to fall to
pieces whenever there was a particularly large bump in the road, or slight
shift in causality.� So Death had opted
for a real mount, who he called Binkey.� 

&nbsp;

Binkey was large, at least seventeen hands
high and pale, very, very pale.� True,
Binkey did have glowing blue eyes and although fire did not sprout from his
nostrils, there was a certain fireyness about his
breath.� Everything about Binkey said
horse.� While other mounts could claim to
be fairly equine, Binkey was, from the curve of the muscles on his neck, to the
shine of his pale hooves, a very real horse.�
In the same way that Death was the ultimate reality, Deaths horse was a
frighteningly real horse.

&nbsp;

�ARE YOU SURE I CAN�T OFFER YOU A
LIFT?�� Death enquired of the small
figure that had accompanied Death to the stable.

&nbsp;

�SQUEAK,� said the figure, who was a rather
large skeletal rat, who, like Death, wore a dark, hooded, cloak and carried a
small scythe that, despite its size was, like the larger version that Death
carried, sharp enough to cut the air.

&nbsp;

�VERY WELL.� I WILL SEE YOU LATER.�

&nbsp;

With that, death pulled his right leg
backwards along the flank, touched the underside of Binkeys belly with his left
leg and thrust his hips slightly forward.

&nbsp;

Binkey shot off across the courtyard as he
went from stationary to canter in the blink of a blue, luminous coal, before
taking off into the multi chromatic reality sky.

&nbsp;

The Death of Rats strode into the stable,
equally as purposeful as his taller colleague.�
Moments later he rode out into the courtyard on his own, less imposing
transport.� True the tack and saddle had
obviously been designed by the same crazed saddle maker, but the small shaggy
dog that served as this Deaths transportation, lacked a certain presence of his
taller counter part.

&nbsp;

Never the less, the Death of rats asked for
canter, or the doggy equivalent and had to settle to a
rather ungainly, lopsided, lop.

&nbsp;

It was a slightly more dishevelled Death of
Rats who steered his troublesome mount back to the stables several hours
later.� He should have known that there
would be trouble.� After all cats, while
not as gruesome as traps, or effective as poison, do a reasonable job of
keeping the rat population under control.�
He should have anticipated what had happened and taken steps, chosen
another mount, or something.� But he was
beginning to despair.� So far he had
tried a chicken, a rabbit, a Cat (Which did not go down very well with the
recently departed) and now a dog.� All
had been disasters of one form or another.�


&nbsp;

�SQUEEEEEK,� The Death of Rats lamented as
he put his mount to bed.

&nbsp;

Goodwife Cabage stared intently at the
glass jars that were supposed to be bubbling away before her and sighed.�� She had spent several weeks pouring over
ancient transcripts, consulting some of the finest minds in the guild,
literally spent the rent on the ingredients, as well as stirring the contents
for concoction for three hours.� The net
result of all of her labours was not a wondrous new source of energy that could
produce light without heat, or any form of energy exchange what so ever.� No, instead, she was looking at a rather
disappointing brown, burnt, biscuit at the bottom of her jar.

&nbsp;

Goodwife was used to dealing with difficulties
and set backs.� For as long as she could
remember she had wanted to be an alchemist.�
A rewarding career that could help people to enrich
their lives.� Medicines, potions
and all manner of powders, that could be used for both
industry and home.� The money generated
from new ideas could set up an alchemist for life.� But just as the reward could be great, so was
the price of� failure.� The guild of alchemists boasted the only
buildings with four foot thick, magically reinforced, blast proof walls, designed
to channel explosions safely away from populated areas (A necessary expense
compared to rebuilding sections of the guild every time an experiment
encountered difficulties.� It was also a
precaution that the city rulers insisted upon).�


&nbsp;

Saving enough money to pay for her tuition
fees had not been easy.� It was not that
her family were without money but, as her name suggests, her parents had
different career aspirations for their daughter.� Even now, her mothers
letters are full of subtle questions like:

&nbsp;

�When are you going to find a nice young
man and settle down?�

&nbsp;

or

&nbsp;

�Have you met your cousin Quentin?� His father is a butcher you know.�

&nbsp;

Eventually, after it had become clear that
she had set her mind on an education, as if a young woman actually needed such
a thing, they gave her an income that would allow her to get by.� After all, she might meet a nice young man
while at university.� At twenty three,
while not unattractive, she was still unmarried.� The fact that her idea of cooking in the
kitchen came with a potential area affect might have something to do with the
lack of suitor, or it might just be down to too much time in the lab.

&nbsp;

Picking the jar up she tried to scrape the
contents out of the bottom, only to find that it fell out rather easier than
she expected and landed on the floor with a resounding thump.� A rather disappointing brown thing, with no
apparent urge to burst into light what so ever, sat unspectacularly on her
floor.

&nbsp;

Sighing disappointedly, Goodwife got up and
headed for bed.� She would clean up in
the morning.� Something would come
up.� It had to.� 

Death sat at his desk, a large journal open
before him, as he calculate the nodes that would need to be collected for the
coming day.� A small robed figure leaped
onto the desk in front of Death.

&nbsp;

�SQUEAK, EEK EEK SQUEAK.�

&nbsp;

�NO, NOT AN IDEAL
SITUATION.�
I CAN ALWAYS GIVE YOU A LIFT WHEN I GO OUT.�

&nbsp;

�SQUEAK SQUEAK EEK.�

&nbsp;

�NO, IT IS NOT IDEAL.� BUT WHAT CAN YOU DO?� PERHAPS YOU CAN TRY A LIZARD NEXT TIME?� I HAVE HEARD THAT IGUARNAS ARE EASY TO
TRAIN.�

&nbsp;

�SQUEAK EEK.� EEK EEK EEK SQUEAK.�

&nbsp;

Death considered for a moment.

&nbsp;

�A UNIQUE SOLUTION TO YOUR PROBLEM AND IT
DOES HAVE A CERTAIN CYMETERY.� VERY WELL.� I SUPPOSE
YOU WISH ME TO PURCHASE ANOTHER SADDLE AND TACK?�

&nbsp;

�SQUEAK.�

&nbsp;

Death rose from his desk.� He had finished with the evenings nodes
anyway.

&nbsp;

�I WILL PLACE THE ORDER WHILE I AM
OUT.� DO YOU WANT A LIFT?�

&nbsp;

�SQUEAK,� the skeletal rodent replied as he
clambered off of the desk and headed, along with his larger colleague, towards
the door on the other side of the room and an infinite distance away.

&nbsp;

The following morning Goodwife came down
stairs to a curious discovery.� The
wasted experiment from last night had been gnawed upon.� Not simply by one rat, but by many, at least
eight she concluded, judging by the corpses littered about the experiment.� Actually one of the rats was not quite
dead.� Goodwife watched on in amazement
as the dying animal, in obvious agony, tried to eat one more piece of the
compound.

&nbsp;

Putting on her thickest leather gloves
Goodwife picked up the strange compound.�
She thanked the gods that she had possessed the foresight to take
scrupulous notes last night.

&nbsp;

For the next few weeks Goodwifes� lab was a
hive of activity as she tested the compound on the guilds rats.� No matter what the foodstuff that she placed
into the maze, the rodents would always seek out the poison.� Within days the guild was free of rats.� Within six months, every home contained a
small packet of Cabages Rodent Pills.�
The tiny packet showing Goodwifes smiling features holding up a small
plate of pills while a couple or rats sniffed eagerly at the upheld offering of
certain death.

Eventually the rodent population would
become resilient to the poison.� The process of natural selection ensuring that only those rats with
a certain gene survived.� However,
for the moment the rats of Ankh Morpork were in decline and Miss Cabages
fortunes were on the up and up.

&nbsp;

The lack of suitors had diminished in
inverse proportions to her bank balance.�
As she could afford new clothes and her face and obvious wealth became
known, so the list of suitors increased.�


&nbsp;

The confident, well healed woman who strode
out to her carriage for an evening at the theatre was a far cry, in her silk
ball gown and exotically feathered hat, from the bookish girl of only a few
months ago.� At five foot eight she was
above average height.� However, her
family were of country stock and so Goodwife was well muscled, despite her
years in the lab.� Genetics had decreed
that the Cabage family should be long limbed and hardy.� Despite this, the right corsetry, hair and
dress had transformed her into a raven haired, statuesque beuty.

&nbsp;

The proprietor of Albion Saddles face broke
into a grin as the tall figure of Mr De Arth walked into his shop.� This promised to be a rather lucrative, if
not eccentric commission.� So far his
company had built saddles for a variety of strange animals for this strange
customer.� Dogs, cats and even a chicken
had enjoyed the benefits of the finest hand made saddles on the continent.� All so that Mr De Arths� pet rat could ride
around his cage in style.

&nbsp;

At first Mr Albion had assumed that this
strange customer was a funeral director, judging by his first impressions and
the style of saddle.� However, one
strange request could be put down to the whims of Mr De Arths own
customers.� But four such orders had
changed this strange customers occupation from
funerals to circuses and Mr Albion was convinced that the orders were for some
strange circus acts.� However, that
opinion was about to be revised as the nature of the next rodent saddle became
known.

&nbsp;

�Although we can make the saddle you might
find it easier if you sourced some of the equipment you require at another
establishment.� If I might be so bold, I
believe I have just the place for you.�

&nbsp;

After several minutes rummaging around in
the back room, Mr Albion returned to his customer holding a business card.

&nbsp;

�SAX LEATHERS.� HMMM.� YOU SAY THAT PEOPLE ALREADY DO THIS?� AMAZING.� VERY WELL, I WILL GO THERE AND SEE IF THEY
HAVE WHAT MY RAT WILL NEED.� HE IS QUITE
PARTICULAR YOU KNOW.� IN THE MEAN TIME,
HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO BUILD THE SADDLE?�

&nbsp;

�Should be ready in
around three weeks.� Of course I would require a fitting session.�

&nbsp;

�UNFORTUNATLY THAT WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE,
BUT I HAVE TAKEN DOWN THE MEASUREMENTS THAT YOU WILL NEED.�

&nbsp;

�Very well, if you pop by in three weeks
time I should be able to have it ready.�

&nbsp;

�VERY GOOD.� I SHALL RETURN IN THREE
WEEKS.�

&nbsp;

With that, the tall and painfully thin Mr
De Arth turned around and left the shop leaving Mr Albion with the feeling
that, despite his customers impeccable manners and the fact that he always paid
promptly with old copper coins (If Mr Albion was to look more closely he would
find that, not only were some of the coins incredible old, some bearing the
names of rulers no longer remembered on the continent, but always came in
pairs), he had just had a very lucky escape.

&nbsp;

The Shades was not a part of Ankh Morpork
to be walked lightly, or without an armed escort.� Those visitors to the city who had found
their way into this district had left, feet first, minus all of their valuable,
as another unfortunate addition to the floating debris of the river Ankh
(Although perhaps floating is not quite the right word.� Most things that fall into the Ankh will
usually take around twenty minutes to sink enough to be called floating.)

&nbsp;

It had taken Death about half an hour to
walk here from the Street of Cunning Artificers.� However, Death was quite familiar with the
shades.� He does a lot of business
there.� The change was, however,
noticeable.� Walking from the Five Ways
and though the Pitts, Over Elm Street and down onto Paradise.� One moment the streets, while not paved with
gold, at least looked relatively well maintained, suddenly
became dirty and un-kept. 

&nbsp;

Despite this, business prospered in
places.� Death passed several prospering
businesses.� Igneous the Troll�s
Wholesale Pottery, Chalkey the Trolls building supplies, before leaving
Paradise and heading toward the Whore Pits, or more specifically, SAX leathers,
on Sweetheart Lane.

&nbsp;

Normally, the lone wanderer would, by now,
have several pairs of hungry eyes, not only watching their progress, but
calculating their net value, where to get the best market price for their shoes
and were to dump the body.� Not only did
Death not have a small crowd following him, but those same speculating eyes
seemed to slide off of him, ignoring him, or where the eyes noticed his
progress their owners decided that it might be advisable to be somewhere else.

&nbsp;

SAX leathers did, indeed have just the
items that he was after.� A few
alterations would however, be necessary.�
The bit would need replacing with a more traditional, two piece link and
reigns would need to be shortened to cater for the riding position.� However, harnesses, reigns, girths and all
that the Death of Rats could require for his new mount could easily be found.

&nbsp;

Once he had placed his order with the shop
assistant who bore the usual glazed expression of a man whose eyes were seeing
a six foot five skeleton, but whose brain had overridden these images and
replaced them with a tall, thin gentleman of indeterminate age and a passion
for sombre dress.

&nbsp;

Leaving the shop and following the
assistants advise, Death walked into a cobbler shop and
placed an order.� Now, thoroughly shopped
out, Death pulled an hour glass from his robe, watched as the remaining sands
trickled into the bottom chamber, before walking deeper into the shades.� It was time to go to work.

&nbsp;

Despite her new found wealth and
popularity, Goodwife was an Alchemist and she had not forgotten her earlier
quest for cheep lighting for the masses.�
Unlike her earlier experiments, she could now afford to rent rooms in
the Guild which offered access to an enviable selection of equipment and
knowledge.� High density beakers replaced
the crude storage jars of before.� A
network of glass pipes snaked from container to container, while a small,
constant temperature magic heat plate ensured a level of thermal accuracy
undreamed of in her previous life.� The
view from the window was nice as well.�
The young woman who bent over the work bench was a far cry from her
previous incarnation.� The Degucci lab
robes that� that
she was wearing would have fed her for a year only a few months ago and the
blast proof goggles were of the finest flexi crystal dug from the Uberwald
Dwarf mines.

&nbsp;

�Now that�s looking promising,� she
muttered to herself.� 

&nbsp;

Bending over she read the rest of her notes
and nodded to herself.

&nbsp;

�Now, just a drop of Argon,� she muttered
to herself as she filled up a glass dropper with the yellow, glowing liquid
from a jar on the bench beside her and squeezed a drop of the liquid into the
bubbling potion before her.

&nbsp;

Despite the blast proof walls and
channelling, large sections of her lab exploded in a red hot cloud into the
direction of the river.� Bits and pieces
of lab, glass and Degucci robe rained down on the city.� 

&nbsp;

Goodwife climbed out of the rubble that had
once been her lab.� She was grateful for
the fact that the workbenches were made from the finest, triple layered granite
that Troll artisans could manufacture, and that she had ducked at just the
right moment.� She was also pleased that
she had written her will and that her family would inherit the business if
something happened to her.

&nbsp;

�Well, that could have been worse,� she
muttered as she dusted herself off.

&nbsp;

�SQUEAK,� said a voice behind her, or at
least, that is what her ears heard, her brain seemed to understand something
else, as though she could hear a voice saying �WELL, NOT REALLY,� inside her
head.

&nbsp;

Goodwife turned to where the squeak had
come from.� 

&nbsp;

�Oh no,� she groaned as she took in the
small, robed figure carrying a scythe.� 

&nbsp;

Looking behind her she saw what she had
expected to see.� Normally, when a person
dies, a strand of light will connect the sole to the body, running from the
temple of the dead body, to the back of the head on the sole standing near the
remains.� In Goodwifes� case, over a
score of strands spread out from her head to several places around the room.

&nbsp;

Goodwife stood numbly surveying the carnage
that had been her.� A high pitched,
squeaky chuckle brought her attention back to the rat, who
held an hour glass in his hand.� An hour glass with her name on it.� Then, to her amazement, the Death of Rats
turned the hour glass over.� 

&nbsp;

Pain shot through her body and she
staggered as flesh returned to her and she was once again, standing in the
ruins of her lab, alive.� Alive and, thanks to the blast, naked.� Goodwife tried to cover herself as her 34C breasts
were exposed to the world.

&nbsp;

�Why did you do that?� Why am I alive?�

&nbsp;

�SQUEAK, EEK EEK EAK. (I HAVE A JOB FOR
YOU.� THANKS TO YOU A GREAT MANY RATS
WILL DIE.� IT COULD BE SAID THAT YOU AND
NOT I WERE TRULY THE DEATH OF RATS.)�

&nbsp;

Goodwife stood in stunned silence as she
took in what she had been told.

&nbsp;

�What job.� What could I possibly do for you?�

&nbsp;

�EAK EEK SQUEEK EAK. (ALL
IN GOOD TIME.� BUT FIRST THERE ARE
SOME PEOPLE YOU SHOULD MEET.)�

&nbsp;

If was then that she noticed the rats.� She was surrounded by thousands and thousands
of rats.

&nbsp;

�EEK SQUEAK, EAK EAK EEK. (THESE ARE ALL OF THE RATS THAT YOU HAVE KILLED.� MURDERED BY YOUR POISON, AS
IF YOU HAD SQUEAZED THE LIFE OUT OF THEM YOURSELF.� YOUR POTION WILL SELL BY THE THOUSANDS,
KILLING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS, MILLIONS EVEN.�
THEY HAVE A GIFT FOR YOU.)�

&nbsp;

Goodwife screamed, throwing her hands up in
horror to protect herself from the tidal wave of fur and claws that rose up
before her, engulfing her and forcing her to the ground.� Thrashing and screaming she tried to throw
her attackers off of her, but it was useless, there were too many of them and
she lost the battle as thousands of claws and tiny teeth bent her to their
collective will.� 

&nbsp;

Eventually, it was over and the claws and
teeth withdrew, leaving her as a lone island in a sea of grey and brown fur and
red eyes.� Goodwife struggled to take in
what had happened.� She was tied up and
dressed strangley.

&nbsp;

�SQUEAK EEK EEK (GET UP.� GET UP AND SERVE ME.)�

&nbsp;

Goodwife struggled to rise, but it was not
easy.� Her arms were secured behind her
back somehow by leather straps, so that her elbows touched.� Her hands were attached to a leather corset,
by cuffs on either side of her waist.� Although
corsets were common to the women of Ankh Morpork, none were as tightly binding
as this one.� Her waist had been squeezed
to minuscule proportions, while at the same time her bust seemed enormous.� As if this were not enough to restrict her,
she wore strange gloves which forced her hands into fists.� These gloves also had a strange dark bone
like substance, giving her hands the shape and appearance of hooves.� She also wore a strange series of straps
around her breasts that formed a strange outline to her naked bust (Leather
strap bra).� 

&nbsp;

In addition to this her attempts to rise
were hampered by the strange ankle boots that she wore.� They were incredibly high, forcing her to
stand on the balls of her toes, while her height was further increased by the
same bone like hoof attached to the bottom of the boots.� Thick lacing robbed all flexibility from her
as the hoof boots formed a tight corset around her feet.� 

&nbsp;

Goodwife felt more leather straps around
her head and her mouth ached from something cold and metallic that hooked over
her molars and forced her tongue down into her jaw.� She tried to push the intruder out, but
although formed by two pieces, which were joined in the middle, she could not
free her mouth.

&nbsp;

Angrily, Goodwife threw her head back, not
an easy thing to do when wearing a thick collar, to complain, which was when
the straps ran from the lower half of the French bridal pulled on her nipples
painfully.� Ann had thought that the pain
in her nipples had been caused by the rats claws.� She was wrong and she screamed a strange,
grunting sound, as the bridle pulled painfully on the nipple clamps which
imprisoned her tender flesh.� She also
noticed the common design.� Hanging from
various points on the leather work, small silver rats
skulls adorned the leather.

&nbsp;

Sinking to her knees she looked down at the
straps that ran from her nipple clamps, under her arms behind her.� With a growing suspicion, Goodwife looked
behind her.� There, strapped to the V
formed by her arms was a tiny saddle.�
Angling further around she found that the reason her ass hurt was
because a tail had been forced into her anus and long raven hair curved out of
a place that hair should not curve out of.

&nbsp;

�Narghhh.� Um Igh ee.� Att OO OO Ant,� she complained into the gag.

&nbsp;

�SQUEEK, SQEEK EEK.� (YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT.� YOU MUST ATTONE FOR ALL OF THE WRONGS YOU
HAVE DONE.� WHAT BETTER WAY THAN
THIS?� NOW RISE AND SERVE ME.� I WILL TREAT YOU WELL.� I THINK I WILL CALL YOU GOODY.� HOW DO YOU LIKE YOUR NEW NAME?)�

&nbsp;

Goody stared mutely as she rose to her feet
and her small master, pulling on the lower reigns and, stepping upon her
slightly bent knee, levered himself into the saddle that perched on her arms
and placed his feet into the stirrups.� 

&nbsp;

The Death of rats fed the reigns threw his
lower fingers and up over his top fingers, so that he
could press his thumbs down, trapping the reigns securely.� Adjusting� the reigns so that the upper set
pulled Goodys� head up, but keeping tension on the lower set, the Death of Rats
dug his bony heels into his new mounts sides.

&nbsp;

Goody had no choice and she knew it.� She was bound securely and her new master
literally held her life in his hands.�
She could feel the tension on the lower reigns which promised
unspeakable pain if she disobeyed.� The bit
in her mouth would be painful enough anyway, if tugged hard and with heels that
bony her rider did not need spurs.�
Resigned to her fate, Goody walked forward as she was commanded.

�THAT�S IT, NOW PICK YOUR FEET UP HIGHER
AND WE SHALL TRY FOR TROTT?�

&nbsp;

The End.
