Synopsis: After several decades of reducing the number of
motorist speeding the Danish government comes up with a humiliating idea of how
to punish people in a way so they stop speeding forever. Hopefully it remains
fiction.

&nbsp;


 In the parliament


&nbsp;

It was the year 2015. The
politicians met once again. Everybody has thought about his or her failure. For
year the numbers of casualties in the traffic have been dropping, but now
number had risen. John sad back in his chair and remembered the old days.

&nbsp;

Before the wall fell Denmark like most European countries in the free world had rather relaxed laws
regarding speeding. Strict laws were not needed. In fact they function as a
show window of what people behind the iron curtain could achieve if they
decided to break free from communism. 

&nbsp;

But soon after the wall fell � Denmark like other countries discovered exactly what it would cost to rebuilt East
 Europe and suddenly all cost in the
Danish society had to be reduced.

&nbsp;

The early retirement was the first
victim but also the number of people killed or hospitalized did cost too much.

&nbsp;

The speed limit had not been
introduced as safety measure in the first place. It was introduced because
people on Sealand felt their countryside a little to
small and by reducing the speed limit on the highways the countryside felt
larger.

&nbsp;

Therefore speed
limits was not used in Jutland and in the late 1990�s it came as a surprise when the police started to
use them on motorist over there.

&nbsp;

The politician discovered that they
could earn more money if they increased the fines and the state had a fine
income around year 2000. But all the European countries started to put pressure
on Denmark in order suppress the population, as it is custom on other European
countries. So in 2006 a tree-strike-and-you-are-out system was introduced. Also
new drivers must overcome a two-year trial period before they could drive like
adults.

&nbsp;

The effect was huge. Danish
lorry-drivers became impossible to find and people did not like to an extra
effort. The level of productivity slowed down. People only thought about their
pension. The number of killed people on the streets of Denmark became the lowest in 30 years. But the society was hurt. A number of
Danish jobs were moved abroad.

&nbsp;

So in 2010 the government was forced
to go back to the old system. As result the casualty-rate rose.

&nbsp;

John was brought back to attention,
when Miss. Jensen approached him. She was been on a government paid study tour
to the Far East.

&nbsp;

�I have come up with a solution. We
all know that if people lose their drivers license, they would lose their job
and we won�t get tax from their income. And if they have not a driver�s
license, we can�t continue to get money from their fines. If we instead could
make them ashamed if they break the law, we would keep their tax income and
perhaps also some of the fine money.�

&nbsp;

�How could we make people ashamed?
Talks and bragging in companies al over Denmark is the largest morale booster this country have. Our high work morale
is the very factor, which makes foreign firms buy our firms and ideas.�

&nbsp;

�By whipping them publicly!�

&nbsp;

�But would this not be regarded as
torture? We have signed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.�

&nbsp;

�No. We would see to that it is done
in a matter, which prevents the skin to be broken. It is the factor of
humiliating people rather than apply pain to them. A little redness could be
the result however.�

&nbsp;

�This solutions
seems tempting. Lets put it into law.�

&nbsp;

The other politicians joined them
and they drafted following punishment.



&nbsp;



&nbsp;


 No minors can be punished med corporal
     punishment.
 A doctor should examine the convict before
     punishment to ensure that the convict can endure the punishment.
 Every 5 km per hour over the speed limit inside
     city-limits would result in one stroke by the whip.
 Every 10 km per hour over the speed limit outside
     city-limits would result in one stroke by the whip.
 Passengers, which
     encourage the driver to exceed the speed limits, would receive 3 strokes
     by the whip.
 The punishment should be served in one time.
 The punishment must not result in tearing and
     breaking the skin
 The blows must only hit the buttocks.
 The convict can request a supporter to comfort
     the convict during the punishment. It is allowed for the supporter to be
     masked in order to avoid recognition.




&nbsp;



&nbsp;

The politician searched long for the
suitable whip and found that a light version of the cat-of-nine-tails like
those used in BDSM-acts seems to minimize the risk of tearing and breaking the
skin.

&nbsp;

The system should function as
follows. The police continued to pass on fines or take pictures. The fines
should be paid as usual.

&nbsp;

The first Saturday in every month
all the offender should to a gym near the police station where he or she
publicly would receive the punishment. The punishment would be taped by a local
TV-company and televised at 11 p.m. every
night to avoid children from seeing the act.

&nbsp;

In order to achieve maximum income
seats in the gym could also be bought. There would be strict control at the
entrance to ensure that the spectators would be adults only.

&nbsp;

The law was passed in the
parliament.

&nbsp;


 About Peter


&nbsp;

A couple of years later Peter was
getting ready.

&nbsp;

Peter was the local whip-master.
When the law was passed he gave up his work as a carpark attendant. Normally
jobs as carpark attendants were the only public job where the applicant was not
checked for child abuse or other criminal acts.

&nbsp;

Peter had done none of these
gruesome things. He just liked to insult people and use the power his job gave
him. But the job title as carpark attendant is rated as one of the lowest in Denmark. People know that a job as Carpark attendant often means that something
is mental wrong the person. So Peter took the opportunity to change career when
the state started to search for whip-masters.

&nbsp;

After he got the job, he was send to
a Far East country where he trained and learned the skill of whipping. It took
almost half a year.

&nbsp;

Now he stood in the dresser where he
changed into his uniform. In order to preserve his anonymity he was wearing
black hood, so only his eyes could be seen.

&nbsp;

When he was finished, he went into
the gym. 

&nbsp;

In the gym 3 trestles made of wood
were placed in the center. If a lot of motorist had been caught during the
month, Peter would be joined by two of his colleagues so they could manage to
get trough the number of offenders in one day. But today the schedule didn�t
seem to tight. Peter could easily manage the number of
clients.

&nbsp;

Each trestle was shaped like a H-form. A pillow was mounted in the middle to the offender
could lie down on his stomach. There were leather cuffs for fasting
the offenders 

&nbsp;

Outside the gym the large queue was
pilling up. The public whipping had become very popular. The state sold DVD�s
of the entire s�ances so any interested party could look at friends and
relatives being punished. For some reason the DVD�s sold very well.

&nbsp;

Inside the gym there was silence.
People would have to pay a fine if they uttered a sound. Denmark is a civilized society and public outrage during punishment couldn�t be
tolerated.

&nbsp;

Peter checked his whip and made a
sign to the officer, so they could order the first offender in.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


 Mr. Dobson


&nbsp;

Mr. Dobson was 45 and was a clerk in
a small government. He had been late for his workout and had pushed the
accelerator a little to far. He was surprised when he
received his picture from the police and even more surprised when he learned
that he had been 8 km over the limit inside the city-limits.

&nbsp;

Luckily he had just move to this
part of the country and did only knew his colleagues in town. But the office
owned the car and in the lunch break he had learned that all his colleagues
would show up.

&nbsp;

When he arrived at the gym with his
wife, whom was there to support her, he was followed into a dressing room,
where he examined by a doctor. Then he was dressed in an odd kind of coat. It
looked like a normal coat made of padded canvas, but a square had been cut out
fitting exactly so that his buttocks were exposed.

&nbsp;

A short while later some his name
was called by some officers and he was led into the gym.

&nbsp;

As he entered the gym, he could see
that most of his colleagues were present. His wife sat in the first row.

&nbsp;

He was led to some kind of H-form
trestle where he was told to lay down the pillow in the center on his stomach. Soon after his legs and arms were fastened by leather cuffs.
On of the officers put a strap around his waste so he couldn�t move.

&nbsp;

�By law this offender should receive
one stroke. Start the punishment.�

&nbsp;

Peter took his position. In order to
prevent damage to the skin, he must be very careful not dragging the ends of
the whip along the buttocks once it hit. At the same time the power of the blow
must as hard as he could manage.

&nbsp;

�1!� He heard a whistling sound and
then felt a clash in his behind. First it did not hurt but after his behind
felt sore.

&nbsp;

�The punishment has been served.
Release the offender.�

&nbsp;

Mr. Dobson was quite red in his
face. Although it did not hurt very much all his colleagues and his wife had
seen him being whipped.

&nbsp;

He was helped to his feet and went
quite fast back to the dressing room, where his wife greeted him. They went
home and on Monday he call in sick. It took four days
before he dared to go work again and when he arrived the subject in the work
had long turned onto other subjects to his relief.

&nbsp;


 Mike


&nbsp;

Mike had just got his driving
license two years ago and had experimented with how fast his car could go, when
the police stopped him. His speed was measured to 161 km, where the limit was
110.

&nbsp;

He bragged that he easily could take
his punishment but Saturday morning he got very nervous and thought about
skipping the country for a while, but his mother reminded him of the
consequences. Then punishment would not be obsolete at any time. It would be
waiting for him when he returned to Denmark.

&nbsp;

So accompanied by his mother he went
to the gym. He also was examined by the doctor and dressed in the punishment
coat.

&nbsp;

When he entered the gym he saw that
his friends, whom two of them were in the car, when he was stopped, also sat on
the benches in the gym. They all giggled, but tried to hide it because they
would receive a fine for disturbing the fixing of the sentence. 

&nbsp;

When he took his position on the
trestle and felt how he was being cuffed and strapped, he started to sweat.
Then he heard the officer pronounce the sentence.

&nbsp;

�By law this offender should receive
five strokes. Start the punishment.� He couldn�t make out where the whip-master
was but he heard someone moving behind the trestle.

&nbsp;

�1!��
Suddenly he heard the whistling sound of the whip and felt it hitting
his left buttock. He got a shock. He forgot to go to the toilet when he arrived
so he peed.

�2!� The second blow hit the other
buttock. Soon after his entire behind began to sting.

�3!� The first buttock was hit
again. Now it really hurts.

�4!��
He squirmed and pulled his restraints.

�5!��
His feeling betrayed him and tears began to build up in the corner of
his eyes.

�6!��
He groaned and found to his relief that his punishment was over.

&nbsp;

�The punishment is completed.�

&nbsp;

He was then told to wait until he
would be released. The senior officer took position in front the trestles and
produced a note and began to speak. �Carl Hansen and James
Petersen. We know that you are present. Step up here.�

&nbsp;

Carl and James was surprised but
approached the officer at the trestle. The door opened and the judge from
Mike�s trial came into the gym. As he stood in front of Carl and James, he
said: �We have looked over the evidence and have interviewed the police officer
which stopped Mike last week. The police are the
opinion that you have encouraged Mike to exceed the speed limit. The penalty is
tree strokes with the whip, which are going to be served to you now. Lead them
into the dressing room so they can join their friend at the trestles!�

&nbsp;

Carl and James were about to protest
but they were quick grasped by the other officers and dragged screaming into
the dressing room.

&nbsp;

Mike was still quite broken and his
behind felt like it was burning. But in a way he also felt it just, that his
friends would join him in his punishment. Now he was not going to be teased as
much and his lack regarding taking the punishment as a man became bearable.

&nbsp;

5 minutes after the two pals came
back into to gym dressed in their punishment coats. Each of the offenders were
taken to a free trestle and tied into it. They made vicious fight by they were
outnumbered by the officers and soon after they lay struggling in their
restraint shouting about an unfair trial. The judge ruled that they should be
gagged and the officers came with two red gag-balls, which were shoved, into
their mouth.

&nbsp;

Carl was the first to be punished.
Then he heard the feared sentence: �By law this offender should receive three
strokes. Start the punishment.�

&nbsp;

�1!� Carl almost jumped in his
restraint, when he felt the blow.

�2!� Loud muffling sounds came from
behind the gag-ball.

�3!� Carl fell into a kind of trance
and he continued to lie still with wide opened eyes.

&nbsp;

�The punishment is completed. The
prisoner is going to wait until he is released.�

&nbsp;

James had watch Carl�s punishment
with fear and when Carl�s punishment was over, he peed as the officer came over
to his trestle.

&nbsp;

He was shaking as the officer
pronounced his sentence and tried to locate the whip-master but he couldn�t
move his head enough.

&nbsp;

�1!� Seeing his friends being
punished had already broken James. He sniffed quite behind his gag. He almost
felt like he was out of his body hardly reacting to the blow.

�2!� No reaction

�3!� James was paralyzed

&nbsp;

�The punishment is completed.
Release the offender.�

&nbsp;

All the men were helped to their
feet. Mike could walk on his own, but both James and Carl had to be supported
as they sopping were lead back to the dressing room. The floor as well as the
trestles had to be cleaned. A break was necessary.

&nbsp;

The senior officer went in front of
the trestles and pronounced: �We are going to have a 30 minute break before
resuming punishing the last offender. Food and non-alcoholic drinks can be
purchased in the cafeteria�

&nbsp;


 Lunch break


&nbsp;

As the cleaners began their work,
Peter went into his dressing room. His wife greeted him. As most people in his
previous job, he did not like social company so when he felt the need for a
wife, he simply took a vacation to the Far East
where he took contact to a dating-firm he had consulted over the internet.

&nbsp;

He soon selected a wife and they got
married. It was nice to have someone cleaning the house, washing clothes and
dices. Sex was a problem. He could only achieve a hard-on when he used his
whip. But his wife could of course not stand being the target of his �passion�
all the time, so now she was here in the break, so he could get the maximum
experience out of both work and married.

&nbsp;

Getting work life and private life
to work side by side was not a problem for peter.

&nbsp;

His wife had made a bed on the
floor. He locked the door, so they could not be disturbed. After undressing, he
joined his wife in the bed where he embraced his wife. He had a hard-on because
of the work and she had also sat at the benches along with the audience, so she
was already wet.

&nbsp;

His wife stated enthusiastic� �I want you inside now.� Peter forced
himself up in her. She liked to be taken roughly. She moaned and groaned as he
began to find his rhythm.

&nbsp;

She started to sweat a lot. Her skin
was slippery and Peter had difficult to get a grip around her.

&nbsp;

She came very fast. �Oh. Gooood����
She almost screamed.

&nbsp;

Peter also came at the same time a
shot his load squeezing his teeth.

&nbsp;

They continued to lie on the floor
until they heard someone knocking on the door �Peter�. It time for the last
offender.�

&nbsp;


 �I know her from ..???�


&nbsp;

Peter was back in the gym. The break
had done him good. He felt it like he was freshened a little up.

&nbsp;

The door opened and a woman was led
into the gym. Peter looked at her face. �I have seen her somewhere but from
where? She seems familiar.� 

&nbsp;

Little did Peter know about Miss.
Jensen�s secret. She had driven home from the
parliament after some long negotiations, which took all evening. There was no
traffic on the highway in the middle of the night.

&nbsp;

She hadn�t been drinking. One member
of the parliament years back hitting a barrier on his way from work to home had
been plenty. It had since been a lesson to all the members. But she had driven
without the thought on the traffic and did not notice how fast she was going.
She even did not notice the road works.

&nbsp;

The result had been,
that her speed had been 145 instead of 70. That meant 7 stokes.

&nbsp;

In a way it was unfair. She is
member of the parliament and can according to Danish law not be punished unless
the entire parliament votes on lifting her immunity.

&nbsp;

But the minister of justice said
that he could not uphold her immunity. The police record could not be erased
and too many did know. He was forced to put her immunity to vote. If the
population would find out that members of the parliament would evade their punishment,
violence could break out in the streets.

&nbsp;

But he suggested a solution. If she
waived her immunity at herself and agreed to the punishment, the voting
wouldn�t be necessary. He could however offer her some anonymity by letting the
officer announce her by another name. He would furthermore see to that that a
technical error would arise so there wouldn�t be a film made of the punishment.

&nbsp;

Miss. Jensen agreed with forebodings
on the punishment. She did not have choice. Her standing in the society was at
risk. The minister of justice saw to that her name in all records was Miss.
Schmidt. None would notice, as the number-series in all journals were intact
and unbroken.

&nbsp;

Miss. Jensen contacted John and
asked if he could be at her side, while she was punished. John agreed. 

&nbsp;

On the day of her punishment she
colored her hair so it was black instead of blond. The hair-color could be
washed out in the evening.

&nbsp;

Back in the gym, the senior officer
approached Peter: �Miss. Schmidt has been granted a supporter. We have arranged
for a chair so he can hold her hand during the proceedings. 

&nbsp;

Miss. Jensen lied down on the pillow
in the center at the trestle. Her hands and feet were cuffed. The officer
strapped her down on the pillow.

&nbsp;

John came inside the gym. He was wearing
a black leather mask with opening for his eyes and mouth. No one would
recognize him.

&nbsp;

We went over to the chair where he
immediately took Miss. Jensen�s hand. She squeezed his hand, but she did not
utter a word. He could fell that she was sweating.

&nbsp;

An officer approached them. �Madam. Could I offer you a gag?�

&nbsp;

Miss. Jensen nodded and a ball-gag
was fastened. The officer went away and fetched the document with the verdict.
Then he stated: �By law this offender should receive seven strokes. Start the
punishment.�

&nbsp;

Miss. Jensen was very afraid. She
tried to work out where the whip-master was but she could hear where he was.
She looked into John�s eyes with despair. The gym was to quiet that a pin could
be dropped without anyone hearing it.

&nbsp;

�1!� Miss. Jensen�s opened her eyes
wide. �Mmmmm.� It was obvious that it had hurt.

�2!� Her body began to shake, as the
second blow hit her at her other buttock. �The whip-master is skilled, she
thought.�

�3!� The third blow hit almost at
the same place at the first one did. A tear began to show in her eyes. She
squeezed John�s hand as hard as she could. John responded by stroking her hair
softly.

�4!� �Mmmmmmmm�.
She would have screamed if the gag had allowed her that. Instead only muffled
sounds were heard in the gym. Oddly her pussy was beginning to be wet. Had her
study in Asia been of no use? Was this a punishment after all?

�5!� Her thinking was brutally
stopped by the fifth blow. Her left buttock was hurting so much that her entire
body was shaking violent.

�6!� The pain became unbearable. Her
body was out of control � shaking and trembling. It betrayed her too. Liquid
from her pussy was flowing down her leg.

�7!� Miss. Jensen was in another
world and having a kind of orgasm. John and Peter looked at each other knowing
her state of mind. So they decided not to interfere and let her act it out.�

&nbsp;

�The punishment is completed and
this was the last punishment for today. The offender would be released in a
moment when she recovers. I have to inform you that due to a technical error
the shooting of today punishment have been destroyed. Please leave the gym.�

&nbsp;

When the gym had been emptied Miss.
Jensen was released. When she was on her feet, John took her under her shoulder
and supported her on her way to the dressing room.

&nbsp;

A shower was very
needed and she took of the punishment coat as soon as she entered the dressing
room. While she was in the shower, John took asked her whether she thought that
the bill that she herself had motioned fore was fair.

&nbsp;

�Yes. I would take my punishment
with pride if I ever would break the law once more.�

&nbsp;

Miss. Jensen spent the rest of the
weekend on her stomach while John provided her with food and comfort.
