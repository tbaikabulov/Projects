Synopsis: Ada Cleghorn is enjoying herself when her new Belgian Fucking machine breaks and young George Stephenson is sent to extract the broken brass egg from her unmentionables.






"Mr Stephenson is here sir"

Arthur Cleghorn was a self made man, a man of vision, a modern man, a man prepared to embrace modern technology to its fullest degree.

"Send him up Perkins"

Arthur replaced the speaking&nbsp; tube on its whistle and paced up and down the Oak panelled reading room in the west wing of his as yet unfinished brand new mansion.

"Mr Stephenson, Sir."

"Ah Stephenson, good of you to come so quick, now this is ah delicate, a slight accident, mishap."

"Begging pardon sir I'm buggered if I know what you are on about."

"No I doubt a chap of your class would know, but, I better show you, now I hope you have a strong stomach because this is not for the faint of heart."

Cleghorn led him down the long corridor, through the dressing room and into the bed chamber where a pair of bare legs and a mass of curly black pubic hair emerged from a blanket held aloft by Josie and Kelly the two serving maids.

"Eee bah gum, its Belgian in't it, what's up with it Mr Cleghorn sir."

"So you know about fucking engines, Sid Longhurst said you knew all there was to know about fucking engines."

"Well I never saw one in use so to speak but yes what is problem."

"The ends busted off in Mrs Cleghorn you fool look."

They looked at the area between the raised legs.

Brass glistened faintly between slightly parted cunt lips.

"Spread yourself, let the chap have a good look at thine unmentionables."

"Thats as wide as they go" she wailed as the girls giggled.

"Josie, Kelly help her spread them cunt lips so as lad can see"

"Can I put my fingers up and feel?"

"If you must."

"Oh pleeeasee."

"Her don't need bloody pleasuring lad, we wants it out.&nbsp; I got better things to do with my time than pleasuring that lazy cow."

"By heck Arthur you always did have a silver tongue" announced Mrs Cleghorn from behind her blanket.

"You would rather pleasure a serving wench than pleasure me" she moaned.

"So I bought you the Fucking engine, keeps going all bloody day if you stoke it so what you complaining about?"

"Bloody men" she moaned.

George examined the damage.&nbsp; "It's snapped off flush, operating rod has like, I reckon its threaded, can't she squeeze it out herself."

"She been trying all morning."

"In that case I will have to drill it and tap a thread then pull it out."

"How much."

"Two Shillings."

"Two bloody shillings"

"It's all I have on me."

"All you have, ah I see bloody funny, I suppose having your hand up bosses wife's unmentionables with him watching is bloody funny, any road just get and do it lad."

And so young George set to work drilling the broken brass rod with his hand drill, the work was tedious and Josie had to hold the brass egg still with her tiny hand deep inside Mrs Cleghorns cunt and the tiny flecks of brass had to be removed one by one as work progressed.

George worked methodically first a one eighth hole then a quarter he concentrated hard, finally he selected the drill to suit the new fine thread his friend Arthur Finstock had recently developed with twenty four threads for every inch.

"I'll tap it five sixteenths A F" he said. 

"This technology is all bollocks to me lad and they all peered intently at Mrs Cleghorn's crotch.

"Pity we culd not borrow Albert Kodak's Camera Obscurer and get picture."

"Aye lad that would give lads a laff if it were printed in Pit magazine."

"Don't you bloody dare Albert, thems my unmentionables and I decide who sees them, I don't want all the lads in pit looking at me, wanting to have a go at, you know"
said Mrs Cleghorn dreamily.

"She is getting very moist again Mr Cleghorn."

"Stop fantasising woman, yer getting all wet, how's lad supposed to work when yer cunts leaking like a busted boiler tube."

George inserted the Threaded Tapping tool into the hole ands gently turned it, it started cutting then the whole egg turned. 

"Hold it firm lass, It's Josie in't it."

"Yes Mr Stephenson."

"See if you can reach round more like this."

He touched her hand guiding her, realisation hit him like an electric shock, suddenly he realised what he was doing, holding hands with a beautiful girl while she had her hand inside another woman, his hand shook.

"Thee needs sommat done about that young George."

"What is that sir."

"Yer pricks about to burst open, you needs summat done about it afore you do some damage. Show him our patent Water Closet, Josie and sort him out."

Josie took George by the hand and led him to the cubicle, he was unfamilliar with the technology, but Josie bolted the door and soon she had his breeches around his knees and was kissing the moist purple helmet of his manhood.

"This ain't right lass, I can't marry you if you get baby." he said.

"I can't get a baby like this you have to do this."

She guided his manhood between her cunt lips and sank down on him as he sat on the gleaming white porcelain.

"To get a baby."

A column of liquid erupted from his balls so hard he fully expected it to erupt from her mouth.

"Oh Mr Stephenson, Oh my, you did not even want to see my little titties but you just took your pleasure."

"I like you lass but I can't marry you."

"And I don't want you to, this is 1808 not the dark ages, and anyway Mr Cleghorn has decided you will marry his eldest daughter Chastity"

"No bugger tells me anything."

"Are you ready for another go or shall we get on" she started to pull her rough blue knickers back on. 

"I never done that before"

"Really"

"Yes, I always thought"

"Well don't think, we have work to do." 

Arthur was eating a pork pie when they returned.

"Best check for crumbs I had a close look when you was away."

Josie once again inserted her whole hand in Mrs Cleghorn's cunt gripping the brass egg firmly as George gently moved the threading tool clockwise then back anticlockwise then clockwise once more creating the thread. Finally he announced it was done.

George selected a rod with a threaded end and a T handle on the other end and screwed it carefully into the brass egg and pulled.

"Aaaagghh" Cried Mrs Cleghorn, "Its too big."

"So how did you get it up there?"

"Daniels the footman helped."

"How?"&nbsp; Demanded Arthur.

"He showed me his appendage."

"Bloody Hell, show her your appendage then George while Josie and Kelly try pulling.

George obeyed with some misgivings, After all Ada Cleghorn and his own dear dead departed mother had been friends and had worked on colliery screens together from leaving school at nine until they went into service at thirteen, Ada got pregnant by Boss and His mum by Jim Stephenson, Cage man at number three shaft at pit.

Jim died when he drank three gallons of what tasted like home made wine but was actually rocket fuel for Georges Rocket and his mum died of Clap through working nights in underground Brothel in Barnstoneworth Pit to pay for him to learn engineering at Mining Academy.

"Eee lad its gorgeous, it reminds me of Arthur's when we first did it, you remember Arthur, I was walking through woods and you just swept me off me feet and shoved that monster in me."
"Aye lass, and when I finished I said to bugger off and not tell anyone but you said you wanted it again."

"You hardly had strength to walk home."

"And you showed me mam where I bit yer neck, and all stuff running down yer legs and me mam, said I was to marry you because you would never need to waste brass on a whore if you wed someone that desperate for cock."

"SSsslllopp" the brass egg slid out glistening with cunt juice. 

"Oh, it do feel queer without nothing in after all this time" Ada announced.

George struggled with his breeches, Josie appeared carrying the Chamber pot, she grasped his manhood firmly and after a few swift movements of her tiny hand a great arc of cum shot out which she deftly caught in the Pot.

"Thank you, stammered George, putting his now shrunken manhood away.&nbsp; 

George turned his attention to the Belgian contraption.

"Cuntraption Belgique pour les femme." he read "Made in England,"

"Its a poor imitation sir, poor quality, it would say made in Yorkshire or Newcastle if it were any good,&nbsp; look it just snapped off, metal fatigue, crystalline fracture, does it get much use?"

The girls looked very sheepish.

"You girls been using it as well as the mistress then."

They giggled, 

"Well Mr Stephenson, can you fix it."

"I reckon so Mr Gleghorn, it needs a heavier connecting rod that's all with a swivel joint, I can have it running again by Thursday sir.

"Bloody hell, Thursday, poor bitch will be climbing the walls."

"Or I can adapt one of mine sir."

"What."

"Portable pump sir, same thing almost, just needs an egg thing on a shaft on an eccentric."

"It's all bollocks to me lad but do whatever is quickest and I'll pay, don't worry about brass.&nbsp; Now bugger off quick."

"Can I borrow a Hand cart to carry it please Mr Cleghorn sir."

"Take Bloody Coach and four it'll be quicker but be careful them's thoroughbred, they got a lot of power and bugger all sense, best get Coachman to drive thee."

Stephenson left the room.

Ada rose from the bed and squatted over the Chamber pot. 

"Albert I needs a word with thee."

"Yes dear."

"That Stephenson. 

"Yes."

"I never seen a prick like that except yours, and the eyes, and way he stands, you could be brothers."

"Ah."

"Or father and son."

"Yes, you know when you had scarlet fever."

"Yes."

"Well I had to fuck someone and well I knew when I saw kid growing up, I'm sorry lass."

"Well, I might as well let on as our Chastity, Lord Fanshawe, well you know, you was up at Harrogate, I was lonely, you never wondered why she is like a swan and we are more like crows."

"Well, don't matter now does it, we are settled and divorce is bad for trade."

"Just as long as you get my machine repaired."

Stephenson drove home in style and quickly with Cleghorn's Coachman's assistance loaded the engine in the carriage, next they loaded the seperate boiler and he got the Coachman to pump the bellows so soon the forge was glowing and he fashioned a new connecting rod and brazed the brass egg to it.&nbsp; He reamered the holes to size and throwing more tools in the carriage soon they were back at Cleghorn Hall. 

They took it to the parts of the Machine to Ada's bedroom and set it up, the maid filled the boiler with warm water and brought live coals from the fireplace and soon the pressure gauge showed a 5pounds per square inch.

Arthur Cleghorn watched them work. 

"Ee lad that looks bloody tatty for a boudoir."

"Sorry Mr Cleghorn, I could use Brass and copper but it all adds to cost."

"Just paint it bloody pink then."

"Who wants do volunteer for test?" he enquired.

Kelly, the senior chamber maid volunteered for the test, she eagerly slid out of her bloomers and lay down shuffling down until the brass egg nudged her Labia, George turned the wheel carefully and the egg disappeared inside just the shaft left exposed leading to the engine.

George carefully strapped her feet to the main frame and adjusted the length and stroke turning the mechanism by hand until he was satisfied, he was surprised that she needed the full six inches that the three inch setting for the crank throw gave but she still said more.

Josie stoked the boiler and waited for pressure to built and then as George spun the flywheel Josie turned the steam valve and the machine hissed into life the end of the piston emerging at the end of each back stroke.

Hissssssh, Pock, Hisssss, Pock, Hisss, Pock, Hiss, Pock.

The flywheel whizzed round and the balls on the governor approached the balls out position, the exhaust bubbled through the feed water header tank and the little fire roared.


"How is that thats sixty cycles per minute."

"Mmmm."

"Is that enough."

"Harder."

"No can't do harder, faster or slower."

"Oh."

"More Coal lass pressure is dropping."

"Keep one eye on water level, dont wan't it priming or dropping lead plug do us."

Tears of joy streamed down Kelly's face.

"Its much better than the other Oh." she announced.

"What."

"Oh Mr Stephenson you are the best Oooohhh, " She lost her train of thought.

"Looks like lass has had enough, for now so shut damper on fire and shut down steam."

"By heck George, that's a wonderful machine you have there."

"Thank you sir, I can paint it if you like or repair t'other one."

"Yes do t'other as a spare."

"Strapping girl on is bloody good idea."

"Yes Sir, Belgian design can give side thrust and overload mechanism.

"Mr Stephenson, can I have a go next?" Josie enquired.

"I think Mrs Cleghorn should try it next."

"Yes, you can have a go after" Cleghorn reaffirmed.

Ada came across and lay down, "This one had better not break."

"Set her up Josie," ordered George.

"Put egg thing against her cunt."

"Like this?"

"That's it, just up inside then turn wheel to ease it inside her."

Ada's eyes widened.

"Are you alright Missus."

"Yes MMmm" agreed Ada.

" careful,turn flywheel slow to see if she takes lot,&nbsp; Thats it, its at top, now ease down missus."

Ada shuffled shoving the egg ever further inside her.

"Turn it some more and as long as it don't drop out again strap her feet to machine."

Josie tightened the leather straps.

"I done it" she announced,

"Right a few more turns then open steam valve." 

Hissssssh, Pock, Hisssss, Pock, Hisss, Pock, Hiss, Pock.

"She's away, set speed lever for 60 and just keep an eye on coal and water."

"Well lad lets leave girls to it and have a bite to eat," Arthur suggested, "thee best show Footman how to oil mechanism when them finished with it."

They quietly left the room and walked the long corridors to the Kitchen.














A Sequel to Mr Stephenson's Fucking Machine

Before the Victorian Era safe sex meant kissing and a chastity belt, but when the key broke in Fanny's lock it took an engineer of Stephenson's stature to resolve the problem.

�Thee done champion job of Fucking Machine for the missus so if thee can spare time I got another job for thee, bit delicate like."

Young George Stephenson sat in the kitchen at Arthur Cleghorn's brand new red brick mansion, eating a chicken leg with a knife and fork, Arthur Cleghorn sat across the table from him chewing geat lumps from his chicken. He wondered what was behind Arthur's urgent call for assistance.

"I hope it gives satisfaction, Mr Cleghorn sir."

"Satisfaction, her's bloody ecstatic lad, well done, no lad its Tiffany, Fanny, me eldest daughter, we busted off key in lock in her chastity belt, can you help?"

"It's job for Locksmith sir."

"Nay, lad, it's a job for someone what I trust, I ent trusting my precious daughters unmentionables to any randy Tom, Dick or Freddy."

"I'll have a go."

"Her says her won't let a man do it, her really is a stuck up awkward bitch, so we'll get maid to open door then get a couple of lads to hold her down."

Arthur opened the door to servants pantry and ordered. " Sid and Zed, give us hand" 
 
Arthur led along the oak lined corridors up the varnished staircases past the vulgar foreign paintings Veneer, Van Dike the Netherlands school,&nbsp; Sid Stubbs, under porter, and Zedediah Cuthbertson, the kennel man helped George with the tools, and Alice Mace, Fanny's maid led the procession.

Alice knocked.

"A letter for you mistress." trilled Alice.

"Go away, I'm resting." whined Fanny.

"Sod you then. it stinks like Lord Arthur." suggested Alice.

"Oh all right" agreed Fanny.

The sound of dainty footsteps then the bolt slid back, "Just this once."

Alice stepped aside and Zed and Sid grabbed Fanny and threw her onto the bed.

"Tie her arms to bed, there are some silk leggings in drawer". suggested Alice

"leave me alone" she whined and as Zed and Sid held her down Alice lifted Fanny's skirt and petticoats to expose the bronze belt.

"Miss Fanny it's got to come off, you 'ent had a shit since Sunday and you will be bad."&nbsp; Alice told her.

"Best take petticoat and that off completely" George suggested.

"No" Fanny protested, and wriggled and struggled as Alice tugged her skirts and petticoats to her knees.

George gazed at Fanny's crotch her creamy thighs, the wisp of hair hinting at the promise beyond..... 

"Mr Stephenson, I think your minds wandering" suggested Alice as she stared at the expanding area around George's crotch as his member uncurled from its slumbers and turned to solid muscle stretching the buttons on his breeches to their utmost. 

"Get out" screamed Fanny.

Arthur Cleghorn called to Sid and Zed and they left George and the girls to it.

"You get out too" yelled Fanny.

"No, I got a job to do" George insisted.

"You are disgusting, look at your member straining."

"I am a bloody Man, what do you expect?"

He eased his fingers between the metal belt and her flat tummy, checking for clearance.

He inhaled her exquisite perfume, she smelled his odour of steam oil and fresh sweat, his presence and strength,

His hand now flat on her tummy exploring checking clearance reaching lower, into the soft downy hair towards the region the belt was supposed to protect, his strong fingers her yielding flesh.

She thought of her intended, Arthur, Lord Maplethorpe, with his noble brow, flawless complexion, bejewelled fingers, his French perfume, and especially his beautiful Mansion over beyond Gribblesdyke moor. 

Fanny could never understand why her father insisted upon the Chastity belt for her visit to Maplethorpe's home and his subsequent visits to see her, he was a gentleman, it was the likes of Stephenson she needed protecting from.

His fingers now deep within the enclosing metal, strong but gentle, Fanny realised to her horror, that she was becoming aroused.

"Mr Stephenson" Alice protested&nbsp; "You two, I don't know, you are supposed to be undoing the lock, not fiddling with her unmentionables."

"Sorry miss I got carried away," apologised George.

Alice continued "He fancies you miss he can't think straight, miss."

"Alice" Fanny protested.

"I'll sort Mr Stephenson, Miss," Alice offered and she placed the white Chamber pot with the pretty floral decoration on the bed and while he worked on Fanny , Alice swiftly swiftly unbuttoned George's&nbsp; breeches allowing his rampant member to spring free , then as Fanny gazed at it's size and beauty and as he gazed dreamily at Fanny the touch of Alice's gentle fingers on his erect member sent glorious sensations through his member and soon&nbsp; his rich creamy spunk was pumping from his shaft, arcing through the air to be caught&nbsp; in the Chamber pot which Alice deftly manoeuvred to catch every last drop.

"What do you think Mr Stephenson?" asked Alice.

"She is beautiful". he replied.

"About the belt you lovestruck wazzock" she corrected.

Fanny's green eyes blazed, her golden blond hair shone in the lamplight, 

"You are beautiful" he stated.

She smiled as he withdrew his fingers.

"I have a job to do Miss, now be still."

He took a metal plate from his toolbox placing it between her alabaster skin and the metal belt and placing the lock on it. 
He started by centre punching the lock the started to drill, a tiny hole then progressively larger, suddenly, Twang, the lock sprang open.

George gently peeled the metal belt from her.

"Let me up I want to see" she demanded.

He untied her and she sat up and examined herself, she slid a finger inside herself.

"Oh that's so nice, you can bugger off now."

George gripped her boddice and gently tore it right down the front, her perfect breasts spilled out. then he held her chin with one hand and as he undid his belt and buttons, he kissed her, and his manhood once again stood proud and to attention.

"Help" she cried.

"It's all right I can manage" he countered.

"You bloody beast" she complained as she struggled against the silken leggings&nbsp; holding her wrists.

He climbed on the bed, and again, she became aware of his weight, his power.&nbsp; The scent of Clegg and Wood patent machine oil, and coal smoke filled her lungs, he wriggled from his jacket and lay over her in just his vest and socks.

"Aren't you going to take your vest and socks off?" she asked.

"No its a bit nippy with no fire in grate." he replied and he aimed himself at the freshly revealed pink slit.

"Its too big." she cried.

"No its not, its." he broke off as he thrust towards her but she arched her back and he missed the target.

"No" she cried, "What if I get a baby"

"I should bloody hope you would after all this bloody effort" he replied.

"No I want a ring on my finger before I let any man do that" she demanded.

"Fair enough" George tried again, again she dodged.

"Legally Wed" she insisted. as she dodged again.

"Yes, Aaagghh" he screamed.

"Its me thingy, I got summat in it" he exclaimed and sat back, 

Fanny sat up slipping her hands from the restraining leggings.

"Oh it's a tiny piece of metal, let me see," and she took his mighty erection in her hands and carefully using her long elegant fingernails as tweezers she extracted the tiny curled twist of iron from his helmet. 

"How's that" she asked.

His body responded, it was marvellous, her soft lily white hands, holding his shaft, he had never seen such hands, her beauty, her breasts, he felt his heart beating like a winding shaft engine with safety valve jammed down and suddenly his own safety valve deep in his loins erupted, the hot jet expanded and the creamy white cum shot from his rampant tool splashing her face and dripping down her breasts to her crotch.

He rolled over exhausted, and fell asleep.

"You really are a stupid cow" Arthur Cleghorn announced as he tiptoed across the room to where George lay.

"That lad's a bloody genius, he will make a fortune, and you could not even show willing for a moment to snare him, bloody hell!"

She smiled, she could do better, Arthur, Lord Maplethorpe, he had truly beautiful manners, and a very acceptable Mansion over beyond Gribblesdyke moor.

�Leave me be I would have been Lady Maplethorpe by now if you had not been so tight fisted over dowry,�

Arthur had good reason to resist the proposed union, Fanny had the look of Maplethorpes&nbsp; Grandmother about her and he had a shrewd suspicion that his own dear wife had got a bit friendly with Maplethorpe's father about nine months before she was born, and then again he had been friendly with George's mother and he had a shrewd suspicion that George might have been his own son.

George woke next morning, he felt a warm body next to him and turned towards it.
He saw a naked back and kissed it, realisation dawned, the shoulder length dark hair, the rough hands, Fanny was blonde, this must be Josie the maid, where was Fanny he wondered, as he explored Josie's curvaceous body with his fingers, kissed her breasts and lips and as she woke and parted her thighs to welcome his erection within her he closed his eyes and dreamed it was Fanny's tight Fanny that he was entering.

"Will there be anything else sir"&nbsp; Josie's voice brought him back to consciousness, as he lay over her, his manhood shrinking after seemingly pumping gallons of cum into Josie's privates.

"That were champion lass, thank you."

"I lit the fire, I can do some toast, if you like."

"Where is Fanny?"

"Mr Cleghorn had her sleep in my room when he found she had not let you, and I volunteered to keep an eye on you."

"Do you love her?"&nbsp; Josie asked.

"I think I might, but she don't&nbsp; like me"

"She thinks she loves Arthur, Lord Maplethorpe, he has a big cold damp rotting crumbling house beyond Gribblesdyke moor, Kelly worked there once, she nearly died of Influenza cos it were so damp. awful place."

"Oh"

Josie lay back, "Do you want to pretend I am Fanny again."

"Sorry"

"I don't mind, I pretend that you are Monsieur Bonypart"

"Hey that's rotten, he is a little runt."&nbsp;&nbsp; and they fell into each others arms once again his prick seeming to find its own way into her slippery wetness.

Later as he bade him farewell, Arthur handed George an envelope. "Open it later" he instructed.

The cart took George slowly home.&nbsp; George stared at the tranquil fields full of Cows and Pigs and Sheep, dreaming of the day when the whole area would be covered by houses and factories, where smoke coming from every chimney would blot out the sun and money would roll in faster than anyone could count it, a world where&nbsp; cobbled streets would replace the thick cloying mud of the country lanes which slowed transport and wasted so much time.

He read the letter, and enclosed within found a Wedding Banns form, that crafty Arthur Cleghorn had got marriage Banns called for George and Fanny even before he met her, now he needed to do same at home.

He went straight down to the Vicarage.

"Oh George I can't do this without seeing your Fiancee," said the Vicar.

"Half a ton of best cobbles" offered George.

"And you are seldom in church" admonished the Vicar.

"A Ton" 

"Make it two of House coal and we have a deal"

"Done and I think I have been done, where is this bargaining bit in Bible?" queried George.

The Vicar grinned.

George returned to work on his engines, it took three to four hours to convert a six inch stroke self contained mineshaft pumping engine to a fully functional fucking machine, and by the end of the week he had repaired Ada Cleghorn's Cuntraption Belgique, and had five steam pumps converted to Fucking Machines, and three faulty imported steam pumps converted to hand operated Fucking machines ready for testing.

"I ain't testing all that lot" his maid Bessie insisted.

"That's a job for a prostitute and we would have union round if I did it."

George nodded, Ada Monckton and Gateshead and Heaton branch of the Pubic Sector Workers Union were a right nuisance.

George knew he were on a winner, there were lots of men around with plenty of brass and insatiable wives with sod all to do and too many kids who would pay good money for a quality Fucking machine as long as they could have it straight away, any delay and they would be buying imported tat instead.

The weeks passed, the stores filled with Fucking machines, George's other projects were set aside, the part finished railway engine, and his Rocket pushed outside to rust in the Tyneside mists.

The Vicar came, he found George working on a new Fucking machine.

"Ah George, all signed, just get her Vicar to hear you two say I do and your union will be blessed in the sight of the Lord and you get a decent reduction in tax liability thrown in."

"Thanks Vicar, Did you get coal?"

"Yes, thank you, ah what is that you are working on?"

"Oh dear Vicar, its a Fucking machine, actually"

"Expensive, no doubt?"

"Two Thousand Guineas, why?"

"It would be ideal for, ah, the convent." he said sadly."

"I am building up a stock then I shall advertise in shop windows round Gateshead, there are lots of Rich men with insatiable wives and loads of kids"

"And poor ones, Mr Stephenson, I have eleven." 

"Well hand cranked is cheaper."

"Out of my league, I am afraid." said the Vicar sadly as he left.


The next day the Vicar's wife called by,

"George," she called "Frederick says you are building Fucking machines."

"Yes" he admitted blushing.

"Bessie says you are having to get a prostitute to test them?" she added.

"That Bessie got a big mouth, but yes." he agreed

"This is not right, I need a Fucking machine if I am not to suffer constant frustration yet you need to pay a tester, can we not reach an accommodation."

"I suppose we could sit down and discuss the possibilities with Frederick." he agreed.

She walked round the workshop, George had laid out a testing bay, nice bit of rug on the floor a wooden screen and curtains.

"So my feet go here?"&nbsp; she sat in front of the machine.

"It has to be adjusted, and of course you needs to drop your knickers." George answered looking at the machine, the safety valve sizzled at 25 psi.

A faint rustling and he turned to see the Vicars wife, the pillar of the community, trembling with anticipation and naked from the waist down.

"Please Mr Stephenson, it's been six months".

"All right" he guided the piston gently between her lower lips and on into her soaking cunt.

"Say when" he instructed and felt the resistance as she spoke, he backed off slightly strapped her feet securely to the mainframe and turned the crankshaft two full turns.

"How's that" he asked.

"Mmmm faster"

He opened the steam valve and eased the crank over the dead centre, and&nbsp; Hiiissss, Pock, Hiiiss, Pock, Hiss, Pock, Hiss Pock, it gathered speed,

The Vicar's wife writhed in ecstasy, grabbing wildly at her bodice to release her pendulous tits which she kneaded and squeezed. Ohh yes, Ohh my god, my God.

She shouted out screamed even in the throes of Orgasm, George closed the steam Valve, 

"No don't stop, don't stop pleeassse".

He re opened the valve and twiddled the nut to let the governor balls out further.

"Oh my God" she prayed,&nbsp; "That's too fast,"

He took his spanner and adjusted the nut again.

"Perfect, there is a God, truly there is a god."

George admired his handiwork then added a few more lumps of coal and adjusted the feed pump slightly, the flywheel whirred round, the valve gear clicked, and the little machine puffed quietly and smoothly.

He watched the woman's face the pleasure writ large on her countenance, and he felt real pride in his achievements.

A clicking noise came from the mechanism, George shut the steam valve, and realised with a shock that the machine had been running for an hour .

"Don't" said the Vicars wife, by now too drained to even speak her thoughts.

"By eck. Missus that were a bloody good test and you showed up flaw, There ent enough big end lubrication, I cut it down compared to what it were in water pump, but now I shall have to keep it same and fit splash guards."

George and Bessie helped the exhausted Vicars wife back to the Vicarage.

"Thank you Mr Stephenson, I shall sleep easy tonight," said the Vicar as his wife flopped exhausted into her chair.

"She is a wonderful Fucking machine tester sir, showed up a problem, straight away."
George informed him in all seriousness.

Next morning George set to work modifying the stock of engines, making and fitting big end splash guards to catch the oil and opening up the big end oil feed.

He heard a faint girlish knock at the door. Fanny, he thought, his prick stiffened, threatening to burst the buttons on his breeches.

"Fanny, Oh" he said disappointed as a pretty innocent young girl in a straw hat and long skirt stood before him.

"I am Chastity, the Vicar' daughter." she announced.

"What can I do for you?" he asked

"You did something to Mummy" 

"Yes" he agreed.

"And she came back all nice and lovely"

"Right"

"Instead of all het up and irritable."

"Yes"

"You fucked my Mother! now we will have another baby crying all night" she screamed.

"Machine fucked, that' different, look"

Bolting the door behind her he led her to the testing bay.

"See that goes up between legs into unmentionables and as engine works it goes in and out like,"

"Don't lie Mr Stephenson, how can something this large" she grabbed the elongated egg shaped piston, " Go in here" and she lifted her skirts and pushing her bloomers aside revealed a perfect virgin slit.

"I am no expert, but if thee is excited enough it will go, It's same size as mine, Look"
he unbuttoned his breeches and his monster sprang out.

"Oh its so." she exclaimed.

"Big?" he enquired.

"Beautiful, no wonder mother fell for you"

"I tell you she did not" he insisted.

"But look at us, are you going to force your will on me too Mr Stephenson"

"Yes I bloody well am" he told her firmly as he hoisted her dress over her head.

She staggered in surprise as he released her proud virgin breasts from the restricting bodice and caressed each nipple in turn,

"Yes do me" she pleaded and he swept her from her feet setting her down by the engine ready for test, he guided the egg piston into place between her perfect but now very moist lips, and applied steam.

A strangled cry and a trace of blood in the moisture, then all was adjusted and as he stoked the boiler the machine got slowly into its stride, Hissssss Pock Hissssss Pock, struggling with the resistance of her tight cunt walls. Hisss Pock Hiss Pock.

�Aaaggghhh Ooooh Ahhh Oooh� cried Chastity, as her own chastity disappeared in a cloud of steam.

�Are you all right lass� asked a concerned George.

"Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to" she murmured.

"Is it good lass"

"Oh Mr Stephenson, this is what heaven must be like." she blustered.

He looked at he and the machine with its polished brass and copper whirling and the piston and rods pistoning and her breasts jiggling and her mouth wide with her perfect teeth, and golden hair and barely had time to grab a bucket before his rampant prick exploded shooting cum like a rifle bullet into the coal dust.

She blushed, then unfamiliar feelings welled within her and she in turn experienced orgasm.
He mopped her brow and kissed her breasts, kissed her mouth but his thoughts drifted to Fanny once again.

He helped her from the machine and after making themselves decent they went across to the kitchen where Bessie got them a meat pie each to rebuild their strength.

As his Fucking Machines increase in popularity, George fights for his Fanny
Will our working class hero George with his steam powered cottage defeat the aristocratic prat Lord Arthur with his crumbling Mansion.

Arthur Cleghorn sat at his magnificent dining Table in his brand new red brick Mansion entertaining the Dowager Lady Maplethorpe arguably the most awful person in the whole of Newcastle and even in Yorkshire area she would have made top two hundred, and her effeminate stuck up prat of a son Arthur, seventeenth Baron Maplethorpe.

"Arthur went to Cambridge, studied classics"

"What does he know about mining?" asked Arthur Cleghorn

"Lord Maplethorpe is a gentleman of leisure father." Fanny replied.

"How much brass thee got?" Arthur Cleghorn was blunt, to the point and no fool.

"One lets ones agent worry about such matters" laughed Lord Maplethorp, knowing his finances depended on marrying well and quickly.

"And you are in't Army.?

"Reserve Sir, half pay, Major and all that." confirmed Maplethorpe.

"I were in Militia for a piece, come home me sweetheart were up duff from me mate"

"I am sorry sir" said Maplethorpe.

"Mr Cleghorn, such matters are not for the Dinner Table,"admonished Lady Maplethorpe.

"Can't talk mining, can't talk brass, can't talk women, I'll go check the Geordie"

"What is a Geordie?" asked Lady Maplethorpe.

"Please not at the Dinner Table Lady Maplethorpe" giggled Fanny.

The Cleghorns had two Fucking Machines, La Cuntraption Belgique as modified by George Stephenson and a genuine Stephenson steam fucking machine, nicknamed "The Geordie".

George and his wife Ada after much soul searching had agreed that the Geordie should be made available to Lady Maplethorpe in the red guest room while she, Ada, made do with La Cuntraption Belgique, or perhaps even Arthur himself if he could leave the Newcastle Brown Ale alone for the evening.

Arthur Cleghorn knew roughly how much Lord Maplethorpe was worth and that was less than nothing, the creditors were waiting to pounce, in fact Gribblesdyke investments which had quietly acquired all the mortgages on the Maplethorpes estates was Arthur Cleghorn's own company, and yet Fanny loved the prat.

Just because he had a Title, he could buy Stephenson a bloody title for about two thousand, less if the Liberals got in, and Stephenson might get a Nighthood for free if his rocket got to the moon and found coal there, K-Night hood rather.

Kelly the senior maid was just testing the "Geordie,� as the Stephenson Mk1b Fucking machine was known, Josie stoked the boiler and manipulated the controls,&nbsp; Hiss, pock, Hiss, Pock, Hiss, Pock.&nbsp; the connecting rod whirled around between the shining flywheel and the piston between the girls legs pounding her with a steady rhythm.&nbsp; he feet strapped securely to the frame of the machine as she lay with her knickers and petticoats neatly folded beside her and her skirt around her waist with her bodice undone as she kneaded her breasts as she writhed in ecstasy.

"Works then" Arthur Cleghorn, noted.

"Yes sir"

"Hand us Chamber Pot I got a stiffy"

"Oh sir let me" cried Josie and unbuttoned his breeches, she held his manhood and kissed the tip and as he let fly she deftly caught the flow in the white glazed pot with the pretty floral imagery around the rim.

"Good Lass" Arthur thanked her and handed her two pennies for her trouble.

Kelly sighed as the engine slowed and stopped, the safety valve lifted with a roar and Josie loosened the straps and Arthur helped the exhausted girl to ease away from the machine, the piston came clear with a loud plop and Kelly recovering quickly dressed.

"Oh Mr Cleghorn sir you saw everything, I am so ashamed"

"Don't be silly girl you look bloody gorgeous, shot me load just looking at you, here have two pennies."

Lady Maplethorpe was ready for her bed at 9 O'clock, she habitually retired early to save candles and was astonished to find Kelly and Josie waiting to attend to her.
She refused to use the new fangled water closet preferring to foul the Chamber pot and insisted on a cold bath in the hip bath in her room, spreading a huge cape over her before undressing to hide her nakedness.

The "Geordie" was in the dressing room.

"What pray is that?" she enquired,

"A Fucking machine Madam" said Kelly prettily.

"Don't be impertinent, I can see it is a Machine, what is it for? the Dowager demanded.

"Fucking Madam"

"I shall have you sacked for impertinence girl" 

Kelly lost it, her mum worked in coal mine and her veneer of civility was paper thin.

"Look you old cow" she manhandled the old lady.

"Your feet goes here" Kelly dragged the Dowagers feet into the leather straps.

"And this goes up there" Kelly pulled the Dowager's cape from her exposing her flabby, blotchy, overweight body to daylight for the first time in years.

"Should have done the piston first Kell" chided Josie, "Pull the clevis pin out and reset it."
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Kelly pulled the pin retracted the piston and jammed it in the Dowager's aged and parched slit.&nbsp; Josie gave the piston a few squirts of&nbsp; Clegg and Wood's second grade patent steam and machine oil, then Kelly replaced the clevis pin and its retaining split pin, and then Josie applied steam.&nbsp; The piston shuddered and the machine hissed&nbsp; but the old cow was too tight and dry, her screams blended with the Hhhhiiissssss of the straining steam engine yet the piston remained jammed firmly, while the pressure was at maximum and the safety valve about to lift.

"Push on the rim of flywheel Kell" suggested Josie as she pushed in her turn and both tried to turn the flywheel.

Slowly oh so slowly the penetrator piston eased in and out of the little used cunt and again the old bitch screamed, the safety valve roared and inch by inch the piston eased in, then out Hiiiiisssssssss, suuuucccchh, Pock, Hiiisssss, so slowly yet with 25 pounds of steam pressure and another good dollop of steam oil with two girls straining the machine slowly eased the aged flesh apart the piston gradually spreading the steam oil to lubricate her innards and quite suddenly the Geordie began to master the job allowing the girls were able to stand back as Hiissss, Pock Hisss Pock, Hiss, Pock, Hiss, Pock, the Geordie laboured and strained but gradually increased speed as it manfully began to fuck the old crone unaided.

The Dowagers eyes widened and she went to cry out, Josie shoved a wet bath towel in her gob shutting her up, then as the Geordie picked up speed they saw the old cow grabbing at her own tits with her hips began to thrust against the engine.&nbsp; Josie let go of the towel as she realised the engine was racing.

"Its over speeding Kell!" Josie shouted, the old bitch had become wet and the Geordie was up to nearly 100 RPM. the exhaust became a purr until Kelly screwed down the regulating nut for sixty RPM, or one thrust each second to save wear on the big end.

"Oh my lord, Great god in heaven, Jesus be praised I have found heaven upon earth"
the Dowager screamed, as she spat the towel from her gob, she was in uncharted territory, she thought back, to her wedding night her Husband's fumbling, then her innards cruelly invaded, and then she had woken to see her husband and the best man, conjoined, she never forgave him, one fumbled insertion one son, and now this, she could never have dreamed of such pleasure, she thought of all the wasted years.

Twenty minutes of pleasure was all the girls dared allow the old bat as they thought either her cunt would rip open or her heart would fail with the excitement, so eventually they shut off steam down onto the pilot valve and the pounding changed to a gentle sighing as the speed fell away.&nbsp; They feared she had overdone it.&nbsp; He makeup was all cracked around her mouth as it was unable to stick to the sweat pouring from her and she was completely unable to stand or speak coherently.
Kelly and Josie carried the Dowager naked and exhausted to her bed still bathed in sweat and stained with her own juices. then following the instructions they damped down the fire and filled the boiler water on the Geordie and went downstairs.

Arthur Cleghorn admitted defeat, "All right Fanny you can marry the prat."

"And the Dowry?" asked Lord Maplethorpe.

"Thee wants jam on it, so what do thee want?"

"Ten Thousand?" asked Lord Arthur

"Two more like" replied Arthur Cleghorn.

"Five then" suggested Fanny.

It was barely enough but his Lordship was forced to accept, 

"You will of course pay for the wedding, as the brides father, at the Cathedral?"

"All right" Arthur Cleghorn was annoyed, Stephenson would have paid him for girl.

They retired to their beds, Lord Arthur declining Fanny's invitation, kissed her sweetly and left her to take to his own bed with Hubbertson his Valet.

A strange sound was heard in the Mansion's corridors next morning, a kettle perhaps or a bird with indigestion, but no it came from the dowagers room, singing, the beautiful Geordie aria "Thou Shalt have a Fishy" and for the first time in years the Dowager was trying to sing as she thrust the spare penetrative piston from the "Geordie's" tool kit in and out of her dripping sex.

Kelly and Josie were amazed to see her, "Can you get the machine going again please girls?" No one would have recognised the evil Dowager bitch of 24 hours earlier as this sex crazed wreck, and using such words, she had never said please since she married.

Josie was soon pumping the bellows and the steam gauge rose, 

"It's ready Madam," They strapped her on and soon it was running sweetly.
Hiss, slap, Hiss, slap, Hiss, slap.

"We better order a bigger piston if she is that loose!" giggled Josie, but the Dowager was past caring, Kelly had to get more coal and water and it was not until high tea at four that the Dowager staggered downstairs.

Hubbertson, her sons Valet, dropped the tea tray as he saw her. "Madam, I can see"

She wore her green dress but the blouse buttoned to the neck was discarded, displaying her ample but pale blotchy cleavage, Hubbertson a lifelong Mans, Man, preferring penile insertion within his own rectum to penetrating the opposite sex, realised he had an erection, lusting after his employer.

"Don't fuss it is the fashion" she smiled noting the bulge in his breeches. 

"Arthur" she sidled up to her son."

"Pray examine the machine in my room, such would be most efficacious for your dear fianc�e when you serve with his majesty's forces."

Lord Maplethorpe nearly fainted when he saw the Geordie, but hiding his excitement he agreed to ask if such could be added to the Dowry, what could excite the ladies unmentionables surely could be equally efficacious for the gentleman's rectum he mused.

Arthur Cleghorn could scarce believe his luck, Young Maplethorpe wanting a Fucking Machine and sent his Valet forthwith while he went to check on winding engine at Number three Pit. he could see exhaust from mansion and it looked slow.

Except Arthur actually went to see George Stephenson at his workshop.

"Look George Lad, Fanny gas got it in her head she wants this effeminate stuck up aristocratic prat for a husband"

"Ee Mr Cleghorn I see you likes him."

"I want's her to marry you lad, we speak same language, Brass, Coal, not bloody Latin or Greek"

"So why you here"

"Fucking Engine, I never did pay you for Geordie, how much is it?"

"Two Thousand"

"Two Fucking Thousand Pounds" Arthur Cleghorn's eyes bulged.

"No Guineas"

"What"

"But I'll do it for cost plus ten per cent"

"How much"

"Twenty Seven Pounds, Eighteen Shillings and Sixpence Halfpenny"

Arthur grinned, "You bugger, is it really two thousand?"

"In the adverts, yes, Nobs think its wonderful if its thousands. like painting, sell it as thee's own work and no one wants it, make out as some dead Dutch bloke done it and its makes thousands." agreed George.

"Tell thee what, there is a Mortgage here for about two thousand, how about that for the engine we got and I pay cost plus for t'other."

George examined the document,

"Hey this is for Maplethorpe's house" exclaimed George.

 Arthur Cleghorn grinned wickedly.

"I'll see thee two O'clock sharp tomorrow then and I want a Geordie ready for test."

The evening went splendidly, all were in good spirits, and Hubbertson seized his chance finding via the downstairs grapevine that the Dowager had tried the Fucking Machine and arranged to take over Kelly and Josie's role in the bedchamber that evening. 

Lord Maplethorpe looked magnificent in his spotless white breeches and red jacket, Fannys juices flowed and leaked from her each time she saw him but his disinclination to deflower her was becoming frustrating, she though of Mr Stephenson's energy and ardour comparing it to Maplethorpe's but reasoned he was merely well bred, while Stephenson was perhaps shy. or stupid.

The Dowager entered the bedchamber eager to experience the Machine again, she had stripped almost naked when she realised Hubbertson not the maids were with her.

"What is the meaning of this Hubbertson"

"Beg pardon Madam but I heard you have been using a Fucking Machine"

"Yes, so what has it to do with you?"&nbsp; she enquired.

"His lordship cannot afford such for you so I offer my services Madam"

"You, you weasly excuse for a Man what possible use, ah" she stopped as he unbuttoned his serge trousers revealing his monstrously engorged manhood, over six inches from Balls to tip and of monstrous girth, an appendage worthy of a Donkey.

"You see madam," she remembered the piston had felt loose at times but Hubbertsons monster she was sure would be a perfect fit.

"Yes Hubbertson, I do see, I do see, force yourself on me then man and if you are not up to scratch I shall have you whipped.

"Thank you Madam," he stripped and folded his clothes neatly, and led her to the bed.
He aimed his monster at its target and thrust firmly in claiming her.

"Oh Hubbertson that fits perfectly, you naughty man"

His rhythm increased then all too soon his excitement overcame him and he spurted his seed deep within her.

He made to leave her.

"No Hubbertson, stay with me, hold me, it was your choice, now live with it." she ordered.

"My pleasure Madam". he answered., and so he remained until his monster bestriied once more in the early hours as lads on four till four shift&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; walked past Mansion on their way to number three pit.


George could hardly sleep and was up very early polishing and oiling the Geordie, Bessie, his elderly maid, had the fire lit and the boiler water full and checked all was well, and by Two all was ready.

They arrived, Arthur Cleghorns Carriage gleamed in the early afternoon sun with the six horses fretting and snorting,

"See my Lord thee needs six on hills, four's all right but they ent got the poke."

Arthur Cleghorn enjoyed winding aristocratic folk up. 

George heard them arrive, Fanny Cleghorn, her Father and Mother and Fanny's Fiancee, Lord Maplethorpe.

"Good day My Lord, Ladies, Mr Cleghorn, may I show you my machine."

"That's why we are here lad, that's why we are here" announced Arthur Cleghorn needlessly.

The Fucking machine sizzled gently, 

"Here we are, this is all ready to use, two thousand guineas, for cash, fully adjustable with a selection of penetrators, this penetrator is the Newcastle standard, and there are smaller London versions modelled on the weedy little runts you gets down there,"

"I thay Stevenson, bit ambitious eh what?" exclaimed Lord Maplethorpe.

"No sir fully tested," George insisted.

"No the thingy, much bigger than any man surely, do a gel an injury,"
 
"No sir modelled it on meself"

"I say, steady on old chap, now that can't be"

"Yes it is" agreed Fanny feeling her face reddened with embarassment.

"Look, cried Lord Maplethorpe, this is the size, now stop pretending," to Fanny's horror he unbuttoned his breeches to reveal a straining manhood nearly five inches long and an inch in diameter.

"Now don't pretend you have more than that" His Lordship challenged.

George responded unbuttoning his breeches his prick a drooping four inches.

"See he lies", Maplethorpe challenged.

"He ain't erect you prat," chuckled Arthur Cleghorn, "

"Think of Fanny that night, we her kit off, lad, close thee eyes."

"It is unreal, deformed" cried Maplethorpe as George's Manhood finally rose to the occasion, replicating in flesh the brass of the machine.

Suddenly Fanny exclaimed "You beast" and rushed from the workshop, and, before anyone realised what she intended she had detached a horse from the carriage team and leaped upon it to ride off furiously down the muddy ttrack..

"Come along my Lord we best get home see what daft bitch is at." Mr Cleghorn urged.

They piled in the Carriage and the Carriage Driver steered the lopsided team awkwardly from the yard and gathered speed down the rutted track.

Fanny watched them pass from a roadside copse then returned to Georges house.

"George," she cried.

"Miss Cleghorn"

"Oh George, that awful man, he deceived me, he hid his manhood from me, how could I know he was so inadequate."

"I can't stop, here gassing with thee, I said I would check boiler at Church so come on down and we can talk there." George replied.

He snatched an envelope from the desk then grabbing some tools he ushered her from the room.

They entered the Church: the Vicars wife tended the flowers, "Is Frederick around?" George enquired.

"Up tower I'll get him" she replied.

George stood at the Alter looking up, "Roofs leaking".

"George my dear fellow, and this must be Fanny"

"Aye Fanny Cleghorn" said George.

"And do you want to marry Fanny?"

"Yes" agreed George.

"And you Fanny, do you want to take George for your lawfully married Husband?"

"Yes, But"

"No buts dear, I now pronounce you man and wife"

"Very funny but I am betrothed to Lord Maplethorpe," agreed Fanny.

"Sorry but you are married to George now, just sign here, I'll get it witnessed later. in fact my wife and Alf Buggins are in Church they can do it."

"Oh no, she wailed, "

"I'll sign then she can stick hers on when she is ready" agreed George signing the register then ushering Fanny from the building.

"You tricked me you pauper," she yelled as they went back to Georges house.

"Has got steam up Bessie?" George shouted.

"Yes Mr Stephenson sir"

They went in to the parlour, "Wash up then Bessie will get us, us snap, and mind hot water it might be too hot."

"Hot water, too hot, in tap?" she repeated slowly, she experimented, the hot water, it was hot, from the tap, and Soap, 

George watched her, he smiled. "thee can have hot bath if thee wants."

She looked at the gleaming white bath nearly six feet long and turned the taps, steam rose and she found it much too hot then she added cold.&nbsp; just a few inches.

"Do I get any privacy or do you want to watch?" she asked.

"I'll see thee after" he shut the door.

She stripped and luxuriated in the warm water, confused as visions of his lordships undersized manhood sprung to her mind. she heard a commotion, Fanny quickly rose from the bath and started to dry herself.

Lord Maplethorpe had returned. and finding Fanny's horse there had put two and two together and made seven and a half and had therefore stormed into the workshop and challenged George to a duel, "Choose your weapon sire"

"Beam Engine connecting rods" shouted George.

"Dash it, I meant sword or pistols, whined Maplethorpe.

"Beam Engine connecting rods, there is a pair here," George idly tossed one at Maplethorpe but he could not hold it or pick it up from its resting place on the floor.

Fanny grabbed a towel to hide her nakedness and rushed to the workshop to watch.

"Fight for me Arthur, I shall give myself willingly to the winner." she trilled in excitement.

With a mighty heave Maplethorpe raised the connecting rod as George whacked him on the thigh with his, hitting his Lordships sword scabbard which bent, then with the back swing he took off his Lordship's hat and as he swung again, his lordship cried.

"Enough,enough, you win you take her" and George lifted her on to the workbench tore his breeches open and rammed his monster inside her.

Her brief cry of pain turned to cries of pleasure as he pounded into her, Maplethorpe looked on in astonishment, he never realised the working classes fornicated so long and so energetically, he knew he could never compete and slipped quietly away.

Fucking finished George gave Fanny his old coat and they went to Church to complete the paperwork, then they consummated their union on the vestry floor and again in cowshed on the way home.

Fanny did not care how dirty she got with a full length bath and hot water on tap she had found perfection.


To be Continued.
 












Georges equipment attracts the attention of Prostitutes and Nuns and then he is persuaded to make a left handed version

Ada Monckton was a woman to be feared, a colossus of womanhood only five feet tall but reputedly twenty stone, and as leader of the Gateshead and Heaton branch of the Pubic Sector Workers Union her wrath was legendary.

Woe betide the Gentleman who failed to pay the agreed rate for services of a carnal nature, or who abused in some way not previously agreed any union member and woe betide the loose woman taking up the trade of prostitute to the detriment of paid up Union members.

Fat and ugly she may have been but within her thick balding disease raddled skull lived one of the weakest intellects ever found on Tyneside, coupled with a mule like stubbornness and a vocabulary which would make a Fishwife blush, she got prostitutes a bad name

Ada led the march, up the muddy road to George Stephensons works, "Smash the Fucking Machines" the posters were supposed to say but&nbsp; "Smas the Fukklink Massings" was one of the more legible attempts.

George Stephenson was woken by Ernie Higglethwaite sounding Scramsby Main Colliery Hooter as women passed and he peered from the window to see the procession still a mile away.

"Best get up lass" he urged his new wife Fanny.

"Geordie, I haven't had a fuck yet, come back to bed" she replied.

"No Lass its prostitutes, they are revolting"

"Yes and diseased " she agreed.

"No lass protesting, that gurt fat Monckton tart, coming this way"

George rushed to the workshop where he found one of his Class b double acting six inch stroke twenty five p.s.i Steam Fucking machines still in steam simmering from the previous night, when the Vicar's wife had tested it, he pumped the bellows and added some small lumps of coal and as he watched the steam pressure rose.

He strode out to meet the protesters.

"There he is, he wants to ruin us girls"

"Shut yer fat face Ada, Fucking Machine could never replace you, they cost two thousand guineas and you charge two pennies."

Ada struggled with the figures.

"Three on Saturday nights," she corrected.

"Tell thee what, come in and see one and, yes bring that girl with no shoes on with thee and then see if I am talking bollocks, meanwhile there must be some ale about somewhere, I'll get Bessie to find some."

Ada was surprised, she realised she did not actually know what a Fucking machine did but she earned her money fucking, well from Union Subs actually, and so it was a threat to her wages.

Ada walked slowly through the door.

"This is it, now I'll pay sixpence if this charming young lady will allow me to demonstrate." George stated as Ada interupted.

"Two pennies, Union rate is Two Pennies."

"All right two pennies, now take your knickers off and sit down here."

"I can't sir" whined the girl.

"Why not?" he queried.

"I ain't got no knickers sir"

"Just sit then, now this goes up yer, you know inside."

"Please sir I just takes money and run away, I never done that sir"

"You evil girl"&nbsp; Ada clouted her heavily with her huge fist, "Them like you gets whores a bad name"

Ada grabbed the brass fitting and thrust it brutally inside the girls privates.

"Eh lass are you all reet?"&nbsp; George asked with concern.

"Course she is, like a pig in muck, gerron we it"&nbsp; Ada cooed charmingly.

George connected the connecting rod to the flywheel, turned it through two full turns to check all was well and strapped the girls feet to the machine.

"Turn that valve Ada, while I turn flywheel", George ordered he turned the flywheel, Ada turned the valve and it started, Hiiisss, Pock Hiiss, Pock, Hiss, Pock, Hiss.Pock

"Aaahhh, OOOh, eeeehhh, Oh its lovely Mr Stephenson, You must try it Mrs Monckton, Oooh,"&nbsp; The girl was enjoying herself and getting paid at same time.

"So how do it fuck men?" 

"It don't Ada, it's for women"

"Bugger we come for nothing," Ada realised.

"You can have a go if thee wants, I got twenty here all told so if we gets them all going you lot can take turns" George suggested.

"They need one of these at the nunnery" the girl announced as George stopped the machine to let her off, 

"My sister is always getting a busted off candle stuck up her since she became a nun" she continued.

"Yer a bright girl, how about you join team as sales lass, do demonstrating and that?" George sugested.

"Hey, Stephenson, I paid her mam eighteen shillings and six for her," Howled Ada.

"Here have a Guinea," George tossed her a small coin,

"Now gee us hand with machines." he continued.

"Am I got job then mister?" the girl asked.

"Yes lass, what yer called,"

"Bloody Kid usually."

"I'll call you Nicola on account you got no knickers, Knickerless get it?"

She shot him a glance that could have killed at twenty paces.

The activity in the yard became frenzied, the desultory interest in the steam cuntraptions changed to excitement and impatience to try the machines as one by one they were brought out and brought to the boil, ready for use.

The Vicar wife sought out Ada.

"How much is subs for union?" she enquired.

"Fuck off you're Vicar's wife, not Tart." suggested Ada.

"I want job as tester" she explained,

"Ten Shillings." said Ada grumpily.

"I can't afford that."

George heard, and handed her a Guinea.

"Have two years"

"Years be buggered, that were life membership," trilled Ada.

George worked late into the night, borrowing farm carts to take the exhausted women home and that night all around Tyneside men despaired of finding a street woman and reluctantly took pleasure with their wives, leading to a sudden surge in Baptisms ten months later.

Goerge kept Nicola back, he asked Bessie and Fanny to give her a bath and supervised a few of Lads from dayshift at pit as they worked into the night to put the fully tested Fucking Machines back in store.

"Mr Stephenson, come quick,"&nbsp; Bessie wailed.

"We got trouble, drain's blocked."

He hurried to the house where a two tone naked Nicola awaited him.

"We done her bottom half then when we went to change water it were so muddy we blocked drain," Bessie wailed.

"I see problem," asserted George poking a piece of wire down the plug hole and with a great slurp the foul water was gone.

"Lor blimy sir I'm as white as her ladyship," Nicola observed in amazement.

"I thought t'were suntan not shit," agreed George, his prick stiffening.

"Yes and you have not fucked me today at all have you?" chided Fanny.

"No Lass, sorry Lass, lets do it while Bath is filling," and George unbuttoned his Breeches lifted Fannys skirt and gently tearing her bloomers off her entered her as she stood against the wall.

"Mr Stephenson, please" shouted Bessie covering her face with her hands, but leaving a gap between fingers to watch through.

"Mr Stephenson, please" trilled Nicola.

"No he is all mine" insisted Fanny guessing Nicola wanted a go as she bounced up and down, his huge shaft stretching her to her utmost.

"You tore my bloomers," complained Fanny.

"It was your idea to wear them" observed George.

"You are working class now missus!"

She thought of Arthur, Lord Maplethorpe, the stuck up prat with an appendage more appropriate to a Stoat than a Man she had so nearly married, and smiled as George slowly withdrew form her leaving her feeling satisfied, at least until proper bedtime.
"Thee wants to get a Fong," said Bessie.

"Wassa Fong" asked Fanny.

"Tiny little knickers they Burmanese wear, Archie Fong used to try to flog em a while back from stall in market, he had canvas and silk all colours, out there bloomers is too hot yet the needs summat to hide them twat if 'em falls ass over tit in Jungle." Bessie was clearly an expert.

"I'll just leave them off" giggled Fanny.

George returned to the Workshop and they turned their attention to Nicola once again, scrubbing her upper body and thoroughly washing her hair.

Bessie took Nicola's filthy rags to wash and she found herself sitting naked on the bed while Fanny slowly combed her long Auburn hair with a long handled brass inlaid Mahogany hair brush.

"Can I borrow the brush please" asked Nicola and as Fanny agreed she grabbed it and thrust the handle between her legs.

"Oh I needed that," she cooed.

"Here let me," Fanny kissed her cheek and started to slowly wank her with the brush.

"Oh Madam, that's so nice, I am such a lucky girl."

Nicola started work next morning, wearing ill fitting clogs and a clean but threadbare dress she went round to the Convent, saying she were interested in joining as she could not find a Husband.

The Mother Superior saw her at once.

"You are very clean girl!"

"Thank you Mam"

"Are you a Prostitute?" she enquired.

"I takes money and runs away" Nicola stated.

"Ah, I see, you must be punished, and repent truly before we proceed further"

"Yes Mam"

"So undress and bend over that rail"

Nicola hoisted thee dress over her head and knelt with her arse in the air. Swish splat
the whip stung her backside.

"Hey"

And again, eleven more times.

Nicola sobbed.

"Come here child" the Mother superior ordered, she explored Nicola's sex with her fingers.

She continued.

"We are brides of the Lord and must be ever ready for his ministrations, the Lord must never find us dry and unreceptive if once again he wishes his son to be born among us, do you understand child"

"No" Nicola admitted.

"You yourself are aroused, and receptive to the lord, here these will help"

She slid brass clamps over the girls erect nipples and tightened the screws, sensations, part pain, part pleasure, confused the girl. 

"You are a bloody odd lot, any road sod this for a lark," Nicola spoke with commendable eloquence, and continued.

"So unless you want's a Steam Fucking machine or three at Two thousand guineas apiece I will bugger off while I can still walk."

"My dear chid, there is no such thing as a Steam Fucking machine," she grasped the girl's arm and roughly pushed her through a door and along a short corridor.

A door opened into a long chamber where a monstrous crankshaft with fourteen pairs of connecting rods serving twenty eight penetrators at twenty eight seats slowly revolved.

"That Child is a Fucking machine. we pipe the water from upstream and feed it through a waterwheel and it has sufficed for nearly three hundred years." the Mother Superior boasted.

"Bit bloody slow innit" queried Nicola.

"We are Ladies of the cross not bloody doe rabbits you stupid little bitch, I mean my child."&nbsp; The Mother Superior continued, "What do you mean slow"

"Steam Fucker is ten times faster than that."

"Don't lie in the house of god, child."

"It does 60 thrusts per minute, in and out."

"Child, we shall proceed forthwith to expose the untruth of your assertations."
She rang a small bell very loudly. An ugly old trout in a Cassock stuck her fissog round the door.

"You wanted summat?" she queried. 

"Sister Capricious, pray saddle my mule and have the Sisters presently meditating join us on our odyssey."

The little procession walked slowly from the Convent following the fat lazy mule,

"Forgive them Father for they have Sinned, Glory be to the Father," spake the Mother Superior, as they left town changing to. "Its about time they lazy bastards filled in pot holes and seeing a farm hand stripped to the waist, my god he's gorgeous, I would not mind breaking all my vows with him." as they proceeded into the Country.

George was again alerted by Scramsby Main hooter and the looked down the track to see the approaching throng, he rushed to the workshop and raised steam on the engine in the test bay.

The Mother Superior knocked on the Stephenson's workshop door. �Good morning Mr Stephenson, I am given to understand you are manufacturing a machine to provide simulated copulation.� she announced as George peered through the spy hole.

He opened the door �Well Madam&nbsp; don't know about that I only makes Fucking Machines�. The Nuns swept past into the workshop area.

"That's not a Fucking machine that's a six inch stroke portable steam pump with an extra rod or two, we had them in Pit when I were on game."&nbsp; The Mother Superior shut up sharpish as she realised she had said too much.

"Modified to serve as a fucking machine" added George.

"Hop on and demonstrate Nicola please." he requested.

"Oh thank you sir." Nicola beamed.

"Make sure she is moist, then insert the Penetrator,"&nbsp; Instructed George gently parting Nicola's lower lips and entering the polished brass penetrator piston within her.

"Put the clevis pin through to fix it to Connecting rod like so, " He continued, "then fit new split pin to hold it, ease it through two full turns to make sure she can take it all and then turn steam valve and ease it over the dead centre like this." he turned the flywheel.

Hisssss, Pock, Hissss, Pock, Hisss, Pock. The Geordie gathered speed.

"You wanton trollop, you are enjoying being abused, verily that is no penance. we shall leave instantly" spake the Mother Superior.

"Not till I had a fucking go we wont." Sister Capricious spoke.

"I know about you and the window cleaner." 

"Sister I paid you very well to keep that secret" Mother Superior blushed bright red.

"Oh yes yes yes fucking yes," Cried Nicola.

"That's a real penance, murmured a small nun in the crowd, Come Sisters we must away."

"All are equal in the sight of the Lord and we ain't going till we has a go"&nbsp; Sister Capricious put her foot down.

"Very well then, do you do a penetrator in Gold Plate Mr Stephenson.?"

"No plate might peel off, solid gold with a brass core should be easy enough, pricey though." he replied.

"Very well I shall test this myself, when that strumpet has finished," the Mother Superior announced.

Nicola slid from the machine and George washed the egg shaped penetrator in warm soapy water as the Mother Superior sat at the machine.

She raised her robe and George stared in amazement at the array of gold rings through her labia and her clit from many of which precious stones dangled.

"Sorry, It ain't safe Missus. not with all this junk there, might get caught in mechanism". George apologised.

"No, you must, I can't" she blustered.

"Cut the bastards out you can't abandon me, please" she wailed in a most un-nun like manner.

And George set to work with pliers and a fine file to remove the finery and soon her cunt was as God intended, but much wetter, George inserted the penetrator but feeling excess play he reached for the tool kit, Fanny had suggested he make larger versions for any old slappers, and they had measured up next doors Donkey and Farmer
Frisson's prize Bull, for the Donkey and Prize Bull size options he intended to supply with the de luxe version.

The largest version the Ultra Donkey had simply been a Joke but George was astonished to see and feel it slide tightly inside this supposed Virgin.

"Oh Mr Stephenson, there truly is a heaven." she whispered as he turned the mechanism slowly to make sure she could take it all, then he cracked open the steam valve and slackened the governor nut for 10 RPM, Hiiiissss, such Pock, Hiiiisss, such, Pock.&nbsp; 

"That's about the maximum your water power engine can manage." he announced, 

He continued&nbsp; "I will bring it to 30 rpm. Half speed, Hissss, Pock Hissss, Pock, and 45, this is about enough with the heavy penetrator.

"Uggghh Ah, God" The Nun was in a dream world of her own.

George twiddled the spanner&nbsp; "60 RPM, normal for lighter penetrators, and Max is 120 really but it wears the big end, so try 90."

Hiss, Clang, Hiss, Clang, Hiss, Clang.&nbsp; something was wrong, the whole machine jumping from the floor with each stroke and liquid escaping.

"I got a leak"

"It's her cunt juice you fool, that or she pissed herself" suggested sister Capricious tactfully.

The Mother superior flopped as in a daze as George slowed the machine.

"We will have three, with Gold fittings," she announced before she fainted from excess pleasure.

Later after the last Nun had received her penance from the machine and they sat in Georges Lounge eating Chicken, prepared to the Army secret recipe which Arthur Cleghorn's friend Col Saunders of the Gateshead Militia had lent them,&nbsp; and drinking Newcastle Brown ale, except Sister Capricious who would not touch the devil's own brew preferring bottled water, distilled in Scotland, the deal was done four engines for price of three but they would do demonstrations for any other Convents. 

The Nuns returned to the convent and the frustration of a ten strokes per minute water wheel, and after a good night and some sleep Fanny and George set about making money, Fanny travelling to Heaton to order a hundredweight of Gold and George set to work on the batch of engines for the Nuns.

Fanny returned from shopping in Heaton village with Bessie, upset and disconcerted.
"Mr Lloydd would not take our money, in his bank, says it's too much risk."

George saddled the mule and they returned to the village, suddenly he had an idea, the Estate Agent's, he looked at the board, coal mine, row of houses, unfinished Mansion and at the bottom, Lord Maplethorpe's mansion. 

"How much is this lot?" queried George.

"Which one would sir be referring to" slimed the yes man in the hand me down suit two sizes too small.

"Bloody lot man, Job lot like, how much, Oh except bottom one."

"Piss off, you 'ent got that much cash" said the slime-ball as his eyes widened as George hauled the biggest bag of cash he had ever seen from under his Jacket.

"S,Seven h,hundred and Thirty Six pounds Eighteen Shillings and three Pence three farthings." he stammered.

"Cash" George reminded him.

"Seven" said the slime-ball.

George frowned at him.

"Six fifty then," the slime-ball offered.

"Sign papers then love, I am off to see his Lordship." George ordered counting the cash out on to the counter.

Maplethorpe was distraught, his mother the Dowager had left the ancestral home and moved in with his valet since she had discovered sex at the age of fifty courtesy of a Stephenson Fucking Machine at Arthur Clegghorns new unfinished red brick Mansion, and what with losing his betrothed to Stephenson and then finding Stephenson owned the Mortgages on his estate he decided to sell up and run.

His world collapsed as Stephenson arrived.

"Doing a runner, Arthur?"

Lord Arthur broke down, Sobbing.

"It's all gone wrong, Mother stole my Valet you stole my Fanny now I have no one."

"Thee allus was a Pillock. there's plenty more women."

"I don't want a Woman I want a Man, a real Man."

George had heard of these left handed people but thought folk were joking.

"What thee gets roggered up thee ass-hole for pleasure?"

"Not the phrase I would use, but yes"

"What about an ass-hole Fucking machine?"

"No, such a thing has not been invented!"

"Tell thee what, you come over my place tomorrow and we'll bloody invent one, 'bout, eleven, Fanny likes a long slow fuck in the mornings."

And so it was born, and working together as a team George and&nbsp; Lord Arthur Maplethorpe invented the Maplethorpe Gentleman's Companion, a conversion kit for the Stephenson "Geordie" Fucking machine to facilitate the usage by a person kneeling before the machine with rectum raised, a separate slide bar assembly on triangular brackets raised the axis of operation up to eighteen inches above the Geordies range intended as it was for useage by a lady seated on the floor immediately in front of the machine.

George and Arthur worked late into the night and the machine was equally efficacious for such ladies as preferred their penetration from behind, and with a slight adjustment front or rear orifice could be used with equal facility, Arthur diligently tested each iteration and modification the flywheel whizzing round and the shaft pumping in and out of his ass-hole, but soon they realised the raised centre of Gravity was a major problem, and ideas of conversions were forgotten and the Maplethorpe we know today with its wide rectangular water tank base and direct acting cylinder adjustable from 6 to 24 inches above ground level with an integral boiler was perfected.

George allowed Maplethorpe to stay on at Gribblesdyke Manor as Manager as they converted most of it to a Fucking Machine manufactory and George kept out of the marketing of the Maplethorpe, he admitted only that Lord Maplethorpe had paid to use his patents but soon up and down the land Military establishments, Gentleman's clubs and Monasteries were snapping them up as fast as they could build them.

The Vicar's wife still tested the machines from George's works from the woman's perspective but while very pleasurable she preferred the simpler "Geordie" but she made the observation that it would be nice to lie back in bed&nbsp; and get shafted.
George Immediately grabbed a piece of slate and chalk and designed the bell crank assembly for the Geordie IBF (In bed fucker), the operating arm appearing through a slot in the mattress, which many lazy cows have found so efficacious over the years.

And so within three months of marriage George had made friends with his rivals, his order books were so full he had to get parts made in Birmingham, despite them being soft southerners and not trustworthy, he had to sub-contract his mining industry business, and to cap it all Fanny asks George if he would mind fucking Nicola as she was worried he might crush her unborn baby.

And so George and Nicola thoroughly tested Frenchman Monsieur Alain Du Rex's patent pigs intestine penis cover for the prevention of Clap and Children, which were useless as they could only be used about three times before they split.

"What use is a cover you could only use twice? you would have to sell them in packs of three, "complained George," and them spoils the feeling"
