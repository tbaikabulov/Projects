Chapter 1. Lord Mersham thwarted

&quot;What the devil happened Birkett? I thought you
fellows had it all arranged.&quot; Lord Mersham glowered at his aide.

&quot;I'm sorry sir, so did we. The Parliamentary
Commission seemed in favour of our scheme right up to the last moment and then
Lord Beddingfield who is chairman of the commission suddenly changed his mind
and persuaded most of the others to reject the whole plan. We had no idea sir
that this was going to happen. In the end only three others supported me.&quot;

&quot;Why man? Why? Why did Beddingfield change his mind?
Did someone offer a bigger bribe? Did you try and find out?&quot;

&quot;Of course we did sir. It was your friend Lord
Hathaway. He could see your plans would expand your ownership of the quayside
lands at the expense of his�&quot; Birkett started to explain.

&quot;He's no damned friend of mine as well you know
Birkett! How on earth did that old fool manage to persuade Beddingfield to
change his mind? He's not overly endowed with funds, in fact I would have
thought he was living well above his means.&quot;

&quot;You're right there sir but he does have an
attractive young daughter, even if she is a bit of a wild cat.&quot;

&quot;You're not going to tell me old man Beddingfield is
making a play for the daughter. That�s ludicrous. He has a quite pleasant wife.
Surely he can't want her as a mistress?&quot; Lord Mersham was puzzled.

&quot;No sir but he has a son they don't tell much about.
Pleasant enough looking lad but a bit short in the brain department so they say
although that may not be entirely true. He is however heir to his lordship's
not inconsiderable estate but he�s really not capable of running it or doesn�t
have the interest to do so. Spends much of his time labouring in the garden so
my informant tells me. Rumour has it that Lord Hathaway has arranged for Lady
Katherine to be betrothed to the son. This would ease his financial position
considerably because she is very free with spending his money and from Lord
Beddingfield's viewpoint, she has brains enough to run the estate from behind
his son.&quot;

&quot;Damn and bugger the cunning old bastard! Sodden
Lord Beddingfield stops a major development just to get a woman for his son. He
could buy any number of women to do that.�

�Indeed sir, and he already has done that and we have
spoken to one of the more forthcoming maids. Apparently he is very well endowed
in the pego department but he was quite gentle with her. She also said he was
extremely strong and could lift her around quite easily. It was she that told
us he was more intelligent than many made out.�

��I'll get even
with both Beddingfield and Hathaway. You see if I don't.&quot; Lord Mersham
fumed. 

&quot;As I said sir, the joining of the two families is
only a rumour but it seemed to come from a reliable source. At the moment we do
not know if Lady Katherine has agreed to the plan or even if she knows about.
Two of my employees are trying to find out more but it seems to be a closely
guarded secret.&quot;

&quot;Is there nothing we can do to change the
commission's decision?&quot;

&quot;That was only the first hearing sir. The commission
now has to put its findings to Parliament to ratify it but normally that is a
formality. The commission is largely composed of members of the ruling party so
it is very rare for them not endorse it. The full hearing is in about three
weeks and we'll do what we can to get the decision changed but at the moment
the chances look slim.&quot;

Lord Mersham wanted to damn and curse the man but he knew
he was needed as an ally to fight his case in the halls of power. He dismissed
Birkett and sat in his favourite chair and debated what to do. &quot;I'll
summon Ruth and Sarah and maybe their luscious young nubile bodies will calm me
enough to think up a revenge plan to repay Lord Hathaway for his devious deed.
Better still I'll punish that boy cook reported for drinking the remainder of
the port I left in the bottle after lunch. That should allay my anger so I can
think clearly. I can pretend it's Horace Hathaway's arse I'm attending
to.&quot;

&quot;Your name boy?&quot; Lord Henry Mersham demanded
when the three arrived,

&quot;Jensen M'lord,&quot; the boy replied trembling and
with his head bowed. He couldn't have been more than sixteen years old and had
been employed 'at the big house' for only a few weeks.

&quot;So Jensen, you sort to steal my port wine. You
thought that such a fine vintage was for your palate.&quot;

&quot;I'm very sorry M�lord but I thought it would be
better to drink it rather than pouring it down the drain.&quot;

&quot;And you assumed that a lowly houseboy would be at
liberty to imbibe the wine in preference to Cook, or the butler or any of the
senior staff?&quot;

&quot;I'm sorry sir. I didn't think about it. It won't
happen again sir.&quot;

&quot;No I'm sure it won't Jensen, not after we've given
you something to remember it by.&quot; Lord Mersham turned to the two maids.
&quot;Girls, you have far too much clothing on for the work I wish you to do.
Disrobe now. Treat Jensen as your audience like you do when I have guests. Ruth
and Sarah sensuously undressed each other while their master relaxed and smoked
a pipe and Jensen looked on, open eyed and open mouthed. The girls curtseyed in
front of him and then his lordship. He clapped and praised them and tried to
put his erection into a comfortable position. &quot;I'll save it for
later,&quot; he decided. &quot;Undress Jensen girls. Still treat him as a guest
of mine.&quot;

Slowly and with much rubbing of their bodies against the
houseboy, the girls did as they were told. Jensen knew better than to move any
more than he had to for the removal of his clothing. &quot;Is that as big as it
gets?&quot; his lordship enquired.

&quot;It seems like it sir,&quot; Ruth answered, &quot;I
suppose it is because he's still only a boy sir. Maybe it will grow later
on,&quot;

&quot;Right Jensen, drag the whipping bench into the
centre of the room.&quot; He pointed to one of several devices placed alongside
a wall of the room.

&quot;Please M�lord, I'm sorry, it won't happen again. I�&quot;

&quot;Get the bench and stop blabbing,&quot; Lord Mersham
demanded crossly. Jensen knew he'd no choice. If he refused others would be
summoned and he would get a further thrashing. The sight of a naked Jensen with
his five-inch pego swinging, dragging the bench on which he would suffer,
amused his employer and the two girls. All three tried to embarrass him further
with their comments.

&quot;Lie on the bench Sarah.&quot; The order surprised
her and for a moment she hesitated and looked in askance. &quot;Yes girl, lie
yourself along it. You know how.&quot; Sarah complied. &quot;Ruth, put plenty
of spittle on Jensen's pego and some in Sarah's brown hole. Such a small one
will get lost in Sarah's love tunnel.&quot; 

Sarah signed with relief. She had a pretty fair idea now
of his lordship's intentions. He'd taken her back passage a number of times so
she shouldn't have too much difficulty with the boy's even without any goose
grease. Jensen shook as Ruth guided his pego to the offered arsehole.
&quot;Push it in,&quot; Ruth commanded, &quot;It won't go in on its own. All
the way and keep it there.&quot; Sarah felt his pubic hair against her bottom and
his balls swung gently against her cunnie.

&quot;Strap him down tight Ruth. Just give him enough
slack to move his pego a little so Sarah gets some pleasure from it.&quot;
Jensen had been trying bravely to hold back his tears but now he was bent over
on top of the girl and fastened helplessly, they began to flow. They trickled
in rivulets around Sarah's neck but she didn't complain. She knew the boy's
ordeal was far greater than hers. &quot;I think a cane rather than the birch
for this lad. Find a suitable one Ruth. I want his arse well marked as an
example to the other boys and the maids too for that matter.&quot; She selected
a middle length, medium weight one and showed it to him. He nodded, &quot;Use
it Ruth. Thrash him well while I sit back and enjoy this pipe and the music of
his squeals. Lay it on good and hard, just like I would.&quot; Ruth looked at
him in surprise. She'd been on the receiving end of the cane several times but
had never used it. &quot;Yes, Ruth, use it. It should be quite entertaining to
see your titties moving around as you swing the cane. You are able to swing the
cane aren't you?&quot;

&quot;Yes, sir.&quot; She didn't really feel confident,
nor did she really want to hit the boy. He might make life difficult for her
when the master wasn't around, but there was no alternative. She had to do it,
and do it hard. Bringing her arm well back she brought the cane down across the
centre of Jensen's buttocks. He let out a loud scream and began pleading but it
was Sarah's voice that caught their attention.

&quot;He's pissing in me! He's pissing up my
backside.&quot; Ruth started laughing and this quickly followed by his
lordship. At least it lightened the atmosphere.

&quot;I'll make sure I have a piss pot handy when we free
him Sarah,&quot; Ruth replied when she was able. Once in control of herself
again, Ruth applied another stroke and then one more to the boy's arse. Soon
the welts appeared and she felt sorry for him but she knew she had to continue.
Her aim was not that accurate but she did try and spread the strokes over a
wide area. Even so some crossed others causing even more pain. He'd had about
twenty stripes before Lord Mersham called a halt.

&quot;Lay yourself on top of him Ruth and open
yourself,&quot; he ordered. The exertion and the stimulation of using the cane
made her very wet and the lord's entry was easy. He fucked her hard and soon
shed his load. &quot;Release them Ruth and clean him up. I need to be alone to
think.&quot;

&nbsp;

Chapter 2. The abduction

Next morning, Sebastian and Richard rode from Mersham
Hall just as the dawn sky was lightening. Dressed in dark clothes and with
their faces covered, they picked their way through the woodland bordering
Somersham Manor, the home of Lord Hathaway. These two ruthless men were
fiercely loyal to Lord Mersham; he'd saved them from the gallows nearly five
years previously when they'd been caught poaching deer on an estate further
north. Their instructions were simple and clear. Kidnap Lady Katherine Hathaway
and bring her back alive to the hall without being seen. &quot;On no account
are you to put your pegos into her. That is for me and me alone,&quot; Lord
Mersham instructed.

&quot;She normally has her maid with her sir. Shall we
bring her too?&quot; Sebastian asked.

&quot;If that is the only way of getting Katherine, yes.
I have no interest in the maid so you may use her as you wish but try not to alienate
the girl. If it is the same maid as two years ago on my last visit, I would say
she has no love for her mistress and might have information that could be
valuable.&quot;

All day the pair watched the manor but there was no sign
of Katherine. Lord Hathaway rode out with three other men and headed for the
dock area about noon and returned later in the afternoon but otherwise there
was no untoward activity. Maybe the overcast weather had something to do with
it.

Mid morning the following day, Richard gave his companion
a nudge. A trap was being brought to the main door of the manor. &quot;Maybe
she's going to Barfield market,&quot; he suggested, a suggestion that proved
correct. &quot;We'll have to hope the road quietens down. Too many carts and
people heading that way. It's about ten miles so we have a good chance of
finding a spot somewhere.&quot; 

&quot;There she is,&quot; whispered Sebastian, &quot;And
her maid. Good looking woman if a little plump. Several years older than
Katherine I'd say, still I won't mind ramming my pecker up her cunnie.&quot;
After some more delays in during which Katherine twice went back into the
house, the pony and trap set off at a cracking pace, a pace that caused other
road users to pull to one side and let her pass. Katherine disdainfully
verbally castigated them if they did not pull over quick enough. Richard and
Sebastian followed at some distance. There was little chance of snatching her
at the moment but much of the traffic was already heading home from the market
so it would be quieter later. Most of the locals bought their needs or sold
their goods early in the morning and then spent an hour or so in the inn until
lunchtime. A few tankards of ale later they'd make their way back. It would be
lunchtime before Katherine and the maid made it to Barfield.

Nearly ten minutes later when the two would-be kidnappers
arrived, an ostler was leading the trap into a coach yard and the maid was
standing outside a pastry and coffee shop talking to another maid. &quot;I
guess their mistresses are inside,&quot; Richard surmised.

They led their horses in behind the ostler and flipped
him a coin, &quot;Kindly feed and brush them if you will sir.&quot; Sebastian
spoke. His voice sounded more refined than Richard's.

&quot;Very good sir. When ya'll be needing them?&quot;

&quot;Later this afternoon. Nice trap,&quot; he remarked.
&quot;I believe it is the same one that passed us a while back. Two ladies.
Good at driving providing everyone moves out of their way. We had to move aside
sharpish.&quot;

&quot;You're right there young sirs. I'll have to give
their pony a real good rub down afore it gets a chill.&quot;

&quot;When is she heading back? I'll want to keep out of
her way. She has a waspish tongue for so young a woman.&quot;

&quot;Usually about five when the evening is light. She
doesn't give me a time. Depends on how long she spends with the dressmaker up
the road.&quot;

The men retired to the 'Three Castles' and quietly
discussed how to proceed. It took them less than an hour. After buying some
supplies they regained their horses and headed back to a wooded area alongside
the road.

&quot;If they left at five, they should be here by
now,&quot; Richard muttered.

&quot;At least if they come now the road is likely to be
deserted,&quot; Sebastian answered, &quot;Something must have delayed them. I
hope she didn't decide to stay overnight.&quot; Another half an hour and their
nerves were getting edgy. Still they waited and watched from their hideout.
&quot;There they are at last!&quot;

They mounted and moved into the road, pistols raised. The
trap barely had time to pull up. Richard snatched the reins and tied them to a
tree.

&quot;What is the meaning of this?&quot; screamed
Katherine, &quot;I'll have you both hung. We've precious little money if that's
what you're after.&quot;

&quot;No Lady Katherine, it is not your money we want.
It's you.&quot; Sebastian spoke in his most refined manner. &quot;You and your
maid will be coming with us. Please step down from the trap. Both of you.&quot;

Frightened and with tearful eyes, the maid immediately
did so. Richard tied her hands behind her back and then sat her on the grass
and bound her ankles. &quot;What's your name girl?&quot;

&quot;Mary sir. Please don't hurt me.&quot;

&quot;You'll only get hurt if you don't co-operate with
us, Mary.&quot; 

He turned his attention to Katherine. She sat glaring
defiantly into the barrels of Sebastian's pistols. &quot;If you want me so
badly as to risk your neck in this way, you won't shoot me,&quot; she spat the
words. When Richard climbed on the trap she turned on him like a wildcat,
endeavouring to scratch his face. Richard easily dodged the flurry of arms and
hit her with only moderate force in the nape of her neck. She went out like a
light. During the brief period of unconsciousness Richard tied and gagged her.
Now he drove the trap off the main road and down a track that led to a shack
used by foresters in the winter when coppicing the trees. It was too far to get
to the Hall on the forest trails before it got dark. When its human load had
been put inside the shack, Richard drove the trap by various small paths until
he arrived at the low earth wall that separated the land from the tidal
estuary. He led the pony over the bank and then smacked its rump hard and
hollered at it. The pony took off and careered along the sand until it was lost
from sight. 

&quot;Please sir, what are you going to do with us?&quot;
Mary asked Sebastian. &quot;Are we going to be murdered?&quot;

&quot;No Mary, you're not going to be murdered and you won't
really be hurt if you're nice to us. As long as you don't mind opening your
legs for our pegos, no harm will come to you.&quot; Mary looked frightened but
said nothing. She guessed they might fuck her. &quot;Did you get anything to
eat while the bitch was having her pastries?&quot; Mary shook her head.
&quot;Do you need to piss?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Mary spoke very softly. Sebastian
removed the rope binding her ankles and attached it around her neck as a lead.
And they went outside to a nearby small clearing. Holding her from behind,
Sebastian lifted her dress and held her while she bopped down. In this unseemly
position it took her a little while to start but pressure in her bladder
overcame that. 

She finished and Sebastian slid his hand between her legs
and rubbed her moist mound. &quot;Many men had their pricks in there
Mary?&quot;

&quot;A few sir. Sometimes I've had to entertain guests
at the Hall. The master's had me a few times as well.&quot;

&quot;You'll add two more to your score tonight. Mary and
there's no need to call us sir. We're not much more than servants either. I'm
Sebastian, you can call me Seb and the other man is Richard who we call Dick. I
have to piss too. You want to see what you're going to be getting later?&quot;

By the time Richard arrived back half an hour later, Seb
had a candle burning and was cutting a loaf and a portion of cheese. An
earthenware jug of stream water stood on the table. Mary sat at the table with
her hands free but her feet tied to a table leg. &quot;Sorry, I have to do this
Mary,&quot; Seb apologised, &quot;But I daren't give you any chance of running
away. It's not much of a meal but at least it will keep your belly from
grumbling until we get to the� where we're going.&quot; 

Katherine lay where she'd been dumped still bound and
gagged on the low bunk. She'd writhed and growled into her gag for a while, but
when Seb ignored her, she desisted. &quot;Has she pissed yet?&quot; Richard
asked.

&quot;No, I thought it might take two of us to hold her.
Probably better if we tie her clothes up before we go outside.&quot; Richard
untied her feet and proceeded to pull up her skirts deftly avoiding the kicks
Katherine aimed at him. Sebastian tied them around her waist. &quot;She wearing
those fancy French drawers,&quot; he laughed as he pulled them off, &quot;She
won't need them where she's going.&quot; He rubbed his hand on her mound causing
Katherine to renew her struggles and making it difficult for Richard to hold
her. Even with her neck still sore and stiff from the blow, Katherine tried to
kick at her captors but they easily avoided her.

&quot;Let's get her outside and then we can play with Mary.
She's less trouble and his Lordship doesn't want this one fucked,&quot;
Sebastian remarked. Richard held her from behind in a stooping position and
idly kneaded her breasts. &quot;Piss girl,&quot; commanded Sebastian, &quot;Do
it now. You won't get another chance till morning and if you piss in the night,
you'll be in smelly clothes until we get you to our destination.&quot; At first
Katherine tried to hold back but then decided they probably wouldn't take her
outside again and with the gag she couldn't even ask.&quot; Once inside they
lowered her dress, tied her ankles and lay her on the damp wood floor. The
bunk, although the straw mattress needed refilling, was still more comfortable
than the floor and was needed by the men. 

&quot;Slip your dress off Mary,&quot; Seb ordered gently,
&quot;I'm sure you don't want it torn or spoiled do you?&quot;

&quot;No, it's my best one. I have to wear it when I go
out with M�lady.&quot; Mary undressed in front of them, the candlelight sending
flickering shadows over her white skin. &quot;You don't have to tie me again
Seb. I'll do what you want and I won't try and run away.&quot; Richard made her
stand and turn around so he could see everything. &quot;Did she put those marks
across your arse?&quot; Seb asked.

&quot;Well not personally, but she sent me to the butler,
'cause I pulled her hair when I combed it. They don't hurt much now.&quot;

Sebastian smiled, &quot;I'll warrant by this time
tomorrow her arse is just as marked when the master has done with her. Come,
lie down.&quot; Seb took her first and was pleased at the way she responded.
&quot;That was good fuck Mary,&quot; he praised when he withdrew. Richard
concurred with his companion a few minutes later. 

&quot;What are you going to do with us? With me? Where
are we going?&quot; Mary asked with a tremor in her voice.

&quot;Can't tell you that yet Mary but unless you do
something stupid, you won't be harmed and won't be any worse off than you were
with the Hathaway's,&quot; Seb answered.

&quot;I suppose they will have started searching for her
by now,&quot; Richard casually remarks as the three lay side by side sated for
the moment.

&quot;I doubt it,&quot; Mary surprised them by
whispering, &quot;She often stays with Clarice Hamilton, the dressmaker's
daughter and doesn't get home till lunchtime or even later the next day. I have
to find myself somewhere to sleep but usually the ostler lets me stay with him
and his wife.&quot;

Katherine lying on the damp floor was far less pleased.
Inwardly she fumed but could do little to vent her anger. &quot;The wanton
slut,&quot; she commented to herself, &quot;Giving herself freely to those
bandits and not even trying to get them to free me. She even shared their food
and did not offer me any or the water. I would of course have refused their
bread but I'm so thirsty now. I'll have that girl's arse thrashed when we get
out of this and then throw her out without a penny. When their master finds out
who I am, he'll no doubt release me and we can have them all arrested and
hanged. How is it they knew my name though?&quot; She tossed and rolled
sleeplessly on the floor worried about the scampering sounds that irregularly
ran across the floor.

At first light they awoke, dressed and had the remainder
of the bread and cheese. &quot;Are you going to give M�lady any, Seb?&quot;
asked Mary.

&quot;No, she should still be filled with those pastries
you weren't allowed,&quot; Seb answered. &quot;She can have some water
though.&quot;

&quot;You no good hussy. Enjoying yourself with these bandits
while your mistress suffers and you don't lift a finger to help.&quot;
Katherine exploded as soon as Mary removed her gag. &quot;I'm not employing you
any longer.&quot; 

Mary immediately threw the contents of the jug in her
face drenching the top half of her dress. &quot;Well done lass,&quot; Seb
grinned, &quot;You're no longer her servant, that she's already told you, so
she can't dismiss you again. Put the gag back and let's get going.&quot; 

For the rest of the morning they made a circuitous route
along little used tracks and paths back to Mersham Hall. Mary rode for much of
the way sitting in front of Seb, her only restraints being his arms around her
body. They chattered and laughed as Seb fondled her tits and the horses picked
their way through the forest.

Katherine however, bound just as she had been ever since
her capture the previous evening, was thrown bedroll-like across Richard's
horse. Her bones ached from their confinement and the bouncing of her steed. It
also aggravated the pain in her neck and made her head ache badly. Twice she
tried to wriggle herself off; twice Richard lifted her dress and spanked her
naked arse. Her fancy drawers now resided in his saddlebag.

Near midday they crossed the boundary on to Lord
Mersham's property and there was less need for secrecy. Even so they didn't
wish the peasants and farm workers to see too much. When they forded a small
clear stream Mary asked if they could stop and drink. Seb and Richard agreed
and the horses needed a rest and a drink too. &quot;Probably we ought to let
her have a few mouthfuls too Dick,&quot; Seb suggested, &quot;We don't want her
passing out on us.&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Richard grinned, &quot;And if she
starts opening her mouth too wide I can push her head under. Did you hear that
Lady Kathy?&quot; He dragged her to the edge, removed her gag and held her head
close to the surface. Katherine's throat was too sore and dry for her to
scream. Quietly she sucked in the water until Richard did indeed duck her head
under but it was only for a second or two and the water washed away some of the
tear stains from her face. 

She started to speak but ceased when Richard held up the
gag. &quot;We'll have a brief rest and start on. We've only a few miles to go
but we have to go the back way through the woods to avoid the main road so it
will be slow going.&quot; In fact it only took about an hour before they
arrived at the hall. Richard carried Katherine in through the servant's
entrance; Seb and Mary followed. 

&quot;Cook, lock her ladyship in a room. Get a couple of
your strongest girls to untie her and clean her up enough to make her
presentable to his lordship. She may take a little food now, seeing she hasn't
eaten since this time yesterday. Tell them not to take any nonsense from her.
They must not say a word to her other than what is necessary to do their job.
She is not to know where she is for the time being. No idle chattering. Get
them to clean her and feed her and if she starts ordering them about, put the
gag back on and tie her wrists again. Do you understand that as well
Katherine?&quot; Seb asked. Tiredly she nodded. &quot; Cook, this is
Mary,&quot; Seb introduced, &quot;She was Katherine's maid until she was
dismissed a few hours ago. Feed her please and send her to my room so she can
rest up. She will have to stay and it will be easier if she stays voluntarily
rather than we have to restrain her. We'll be back as soon as we've seen his
lordship.&quot;

&quot;And why in your room, may I ask,&quot; smiled Cook.
&quot;There's room in the maid's quarters.&quot;

&quot;I really need to keep a close eye on her.&quot;

&quot;And your pego inside her!&quot; Cook laughed
outright. Richard grinned at his friend. He wasn't jealous. The girl had been a
good fuck in the shack but he knew Elsie would warm his bed tonight.

&nbsp;

Chapter 3. Katherine punished

&quot;We snatched them easily enough sir and now her
ladyship is locked in one of the servants rooms. She's pretty well done in so
if you're wanting a fiery wildcat, I'd let her rest a while and recover,&quot;
Seb suggested to Lord Mersham and went on to give him all the details of the
operation. Richard added his comments as the tale unfolded. 

&quot;Very well done men. I am most grateful for your
services. You may of course, keep the wench as your mistress Sebastian. Use her
as you will but as you suggested, try and find out what you can about the
Hathaway household.&quot; Lord Mersham beamed. Now he could start to get his
revenge on old man Hathaway. He'd make the bitch pay for the sin her father had
committed against him.

Two hours later he asked the men to bring her to him.

�Unhand me you oafs!� Lady Hathaway screamed at the two
men dragging her along the stone passageway of the old manor house. The men
ignored her pleas and thrust her into a large room. Lord Mersham sat at on a
low couch at one end. At his feet knelt two plump near naked maids whose hands
and lips played with his exposed and erect cock while his lordship fondled
their breasts.

�We�ve brought her as ordered Sire. Will you require us
to stay?�

Before his Lordship could reply, Katherine shouted, �What
is the meaning of this Sir? I know who you are and I demand to be freed and
returned to my father�s home. Your men have no right to abduct me like this and
to treat my like some common peasant. As you well know, I am a lady of rank.
Sir, I demand....�

�Silence wench!� Lord Mersham�s roar startled Katherine,
�While you are here you will be treated as the lowliest bitch in this house.
Your status here is far below that of these two beauties.�

�Sir, this cannot be so. I demand...�

�You are in no position to demand anything. You were
brought here to show your father that he cannot meddle in my affairs with
impunity. He has incurred my extreme displeasure; you are going to make up for
that. I shall use you for my pleasure. Now UNDRESS!�

�You cannot ask that of a Lady Sir. I refuse to remove my
clothes in front of you and these men.� For a few moments as she watched, with
disgust, the two maids performing on their master, Katherine thought she had
won her point.

�Very well, your Ladyship,� then turning to the men,
�Release her and bring the stand.�

�Now Sir, you will return me to whence I came without
delay and I will report your behaviour to...� The sound of a heavy wooden
structure being pushed across the floor distracted her. �What?� she started
before once again the two men pinioned her.

�Take a good look at the stand Katie,� Lord Mersham deliberately
used the diminutive of her name, �It was made for recalcitrant young women like
you. Our carpenter made it from heavy oak timbers so it will not move. You will
notice it is not unlike a short table with the head and wrist clamps of a
pillory at one end. That�s for your head and wrists Katie. Katherine struggled
to free herself, movements that caused his Lordship to chuckle. �You might just
as well save your energy for later Katie. There is no way you are getting away.
Now look at the finer points of the stand. See the cut-outs just behind the
head clamps. They�re for your titties and from what I can see of them under
that dress these cut-outs are none to big. The flat table part is to support
your stomach and is just long enough for that purpose. Your legs will hang
downward over the end. Of course the leather straps are to hold you firmly to
the stand while your punishment is carried out.�

�I�ve done nothing to warrant any punishment. My father
will hear of this outrage.�

�He will indeed. One week hence you will write him a
letter explaining in the goriest and most gruesome detail, all that happened to
you. Maybe then he will realise he is up against a man who will not hesitate to
revenge himself even by using an innocent daughter. A daughter he was prepared
to barter to thwart my plans.&quot; He paused to see if Katherine reacted to
those words but she seemed more concerned with the stand and the use it would
be put. &quot;But we are wasting time. Fasten her to the stand.�

Despite Katherine putting up a spirited struggle, the two
men quickly had her lying face down on the bench and while held, Lord Mersham
locked the top board clamping her neck and wrists. It was then a very easy
matter to fasten the ankle straps.

�Girls, come and remove this woman�s clothing. Sebastian
will cut them where necessary.�

�No! No! No! Please M�lord,� Katherine screamed, �Don�t
do this to me. I have done you no harm. I beg you to release me.�

His Lordship grinned. �Had you undressed when you were
told, you would have a complete set of clothes. To remove them now, we shall
cut and shred them as necessary. In any case you won�t need them for a while.
Servants don�t wear such finery and they are well soiled anyway.� 

Katherine continued to protest as her clothes were
removed in tatters. Sebastian fastened a strap across her now naked back and
Richard used the thigh straps to ensure her vagina and bottom holes were fully
exposed. Sobbing now, Katherine continued to beg, knowing it was hopeless;
knowing she was helpless; knowing the fingers probing her vagina belonged to
his Lordship.

�A virgin as well Katie but not for much longer. Before
you retire for the night all your holes will have been well used.� He removed
his fingers. �A cane Ruth, if you please.� Quickly one of the maids ran and
fetched one from a side table. Standing in front of Katherine he swished it
through the air inches from her nose. She let out a piercing scream. �No point
in screaming yet Katie. It hasn�t touched you, but soon it will. I am sure
you�ve sent your maids to be caned for some misdemeanour or other, now you have
a chance to feel what they went through. You�ll now have some idea of the
thoughts in their minds and they lay helpless. Just as you are now. Your lovely
arse, still unblemished and white, but soon to be criss-crossed with fire with
this deadly piece of rattan cane from the Dutch colonies. And those tits of
yours, hanging now like cow�s udders, imagine what they will feel like when
this little stick is brought to them.� Lord Mersham continued to torment the
helpless woman for a while. Each time he focused on an area of her body he
gently touched it with the cane. Now he decided it was time for action.

Moving to one side he brought the cane down with
considerable force on the unprotected buttocks. Again Katherine screamed,
certain in her mind that he had split her flesh. Walking to the other side of
the stand, he laid on a second stroke. Thereafter each stroke was laid on
alternately from each side until she�d taken a dozen strokes and seemed near to
fainting. Katherine�s pitiful cries were music to the Lord�s ears. Rubbing his
hands roughly over the fiery, welted flesh he commented, �I seem to have warmed
your arse but not the inside of your cunnie. Ruth put your tongue in there and
start her moisture flowing. Sarah put your mouth around my cock and put plenty
of spit on it.�

�I think she�s wet enough for you now Sire,� suggested
Ruth a few minutes later.

�Good, then get out of the way girl, I want to get in.
Position my cock.� Feeling his cock opening her cuntal lips, Katherine cried
out again but it was no use. His Lordship thrust in and forced his way passed
her maidenhead. In a few minutes he spent his seed inside her. The stimulation
he�d had from the girls earlier and the pleasure of caning the woman had caused
him to cum quicker than he wanted. �Leave her like that and I�ll have her again
as soon as I�m ready. You men can have the pleasure of her mouth and if she
shows any desire to use her teeth, then we�ll give her tits a little tickle
with the cane.�

Sebastian needed no further invitation. His cock was
already hard as he poked it to Katherine�s lips. Vaguely she knew what she was
expected to do and opened her mouth. The cock entered but that didn�t satisfy
Sebastian. �Suck it bitch,� he yelled at the same time twisting her nipples.

Half an hour later Katherine still lay helplessly
fastened to the stand, her arse on fire and her cunt sore from the rogering.
She wasn�t screaming now though, just sobbing helplessly. At first she�d yelled
at the top of her voice hoping to gain some sympathy but Ruth had come to her
and said quietly, �Katie, you must quiet. I have been instructed to cane your
bosoms if you make too much noise. If I don�t then I get the cane so either you
calm down and wait for his Lordship to come back and fuck you again or you yell
because I am putting stripes across your titties. I�m not going to get the cane
because of you. Sorry, I do know what it feels like to be caned like that.�

Katherine did her best but couldn�t help groaning a little
from the pain and cramps in her neck. The taste that still lingered in her
mouth was revolting, or so she thought. They hadn�t allowed her to spit the
men�s seed out and for a while she tried not to swallow so the taste stayed on
her tongue longer than necessary.

�You didn�t need to use the cane then Ruth?� Lord Mersham
had returned with Sarah a few steps behind.

�No Sire, She didn�t seem to fancy having her udders
tenderised.�

�Perhaps she�s beginning to learn her place in this
household. Still I would like to see them tickled a bit. Lightly stripe them
while I watch. Perhaps watching and with Sarah�s help I shall get hard enough
to plant some more seed in her womb.� Ruth knew her master�s idea of lightly
and brought the cane smartly across the top of Katherine�s left breast as it
hung below the stand and then while it was still moving, caught the underside.
Moving she treated the other breast. Her victim lungs hollered their
disapproval and she let forth a torrent of words that no lady of breeding should
know, but it was all to no avail. After the tenth repetition, Lord Mersham
deemed himself hard enough to enter Katherine�s cunt again. It took longer for
him to satisfy his lust this time and he took great pleasure in ramming his
cock in as hard as possible so Katherine felt only pain and no pleasure.

�Get cook,� he ordered Ruth and when the rotund woman
arrived he went on, �Cook, this is Lady Katherine Hathaway. While she is here
she will be known as Katie and she will be a servant like the others in this
household, the lowest of the servants here. Set her to do the most unpleasant
and menial tasks and punish her if they are not carried out to your
satisfaction. The other servants may use her as they wish except that her
cunnie is for my use only. You will put a chastity belt on her and warn all the
men their pegos will be in great danger if I find out it has been inside her.
When her belly fills with a bastard child, I want to know it is mine. Have her
bought to my room night and morning for impregnation. She can sleep in the
communal bedroom with the other maids.�

Cook unfastened the straps and supported her into the
kitchen. Mary was there helping and talking with the other servants. As Seb's
mistress she didn't have to work, but after a couple of hours of idleness she
wanted companionship and something to do. &quot;Oh ma'am, what have they done
to you?&quot; she cried.

&quot;Mary,&quot; Cook admonished, &quot;This is Katie
and that is how she will be known from now on, She's not your mistress any
longer. You are above her in rank so no calling her ma'am. However, if you wish
you may go with Elsie and do what you can to relieve her pain. Even if she
wanted to, she can't do much work seeing the state she is in. I'll get some
herbal fat for you to put on and a drink that will help the pain. Find her a
bed in your quarters Elsie if you please. Treat her kindly but don't take any
lip from her. She'll feel even the smallest spank on her rear.&quot; Katie
barely heard the words. She could hardly stand, her whole body seemed to be a mass
of pain and everyone was staring at her nakedness and the vivid stripes
decorating her breasts and bottom. 

Elsie and Mary helped her up what seemed and interminable
number of stairs to an upper floor. Finally she stumbled into an attic room
with a dozen beds. &quot;The one in the middle's free,&quot; Elsie pointed,
&quot;I have the far end one but I guess I'll be in Dick's bed tonight.&quot;

&quot;Kneel on the bed ma'am�sorry Katie, then your tits
will hang while we treat your arse.&quot; Mary deliberately used crude peasant
terms, terms she would not dare to use at Somersham Manor. Katherine was past
caring.

&quot;She oughtta 'ave the drink fust Mary, then it'll
start to work whiles we put the stuff on her,&quot; Elsie suggested. She poured
some of Cook's medicine into a pewter tankard. &quot;Drink this up Katie. Down
in one big gulp then da taste don't linger too long. Tastes 'orrible but it
sure works in no time. I knows. His lordship sometimes canes us maids too when
he's in a bad mood.&quot; Afterwards she filled the tankard with water.
&quot;Drink this now and wash it down.&quot; 

Mary and Elsie applied the ointment to the welts on her
bottom and then her tits. &quot;Lie on your side now Katie,&quot; Elsie said
kindly, &quot;We'll do what we can to look after yer. Yer one of us now. I
won't cover yer so as the blankets won't chafe and only the girls come in her
anyways. You rest yersel an' we'll bring yer summat ta eat later.

Katherine lay as directed. The pain had eased a little
and she felt drowsy and relaxed. &quot;Why are they doing this to me?&quot; she
angrily asked herself, &quot;Now they want to treat me like a peasant girl and
make me work even after the thrashing. Father will make them pay for this. And
that bastard Mersham says he going to try and make me pregnant with his child.
And what did he mean about 'bartering me to thwart his plans? Was father up to
something? He's looked at me a little strange lately.&quot; Drowsiness finally
overruled her thoughts and she dozed off.

&quot;Wake up Katie,&quot; and elderly
woman gently shook her shoulder. &quot;I'm Martha. I've brought you a bowl of
good soup to eat.&quot;

&quot;I don't want it. Go away
woman!&quot; She pulled the sheet up to hide her nakedness.

&quot;Eat it Katie, you need to build
your strength up.&quot;

&quot;I told you to go away! Leave me alone.&quot;

&quot;My orders are to see that you eat it all. Cook said
that if you were awkward I was to put my bony old hand across your backside a
few times to encourage you. I don't think you'll like that. Soup's good
anyway.&quot; Still with the after effects of the drug in her body, Katherine
lost the will to resist further and slowly ate it all.

&quot;Now you can go.&quot;

&quot;Sorry Katie. You've to piss and then come with me
to his lordship's chamber.&quot; Katherine remembered his saying she was to be
impregnated night and morning.

&quot;No, I can't go,&quot; she cried, &quot;I don't want
his bastard baby. It's not right. He's humiliating me enough without
that.&quot; 

Martha didn't argue but went to the door and signalled to
two footmen waiting outside. &quot;Hold her over the pot lads please. Get on
your knees Katie.&quot; With the two men holding her under the armpits and
Martha pushing her knees, Katherine didn't have any choice but to kneel astride
the chamber pot. Martha tickled her between her thighs until her flow started.

&quot;Sounds like a lady does it the same as we do,&quot;
laughed one of the men much to Katherine's chagrin. The other laughed and
commented, &quot;It smells the same too. Pity we aren't allowed to put our
cocks in there until her belly starts swelling.&quot;

&quot;You put your cock where you shouldn't and your arse
will look worse than hers lad!&quot; commented Martha. &quot;Now help me walk
her to his Lordship. Her muscles will be stiff and be painful to move.&quot;

They half carried Katherine to Lord Mersham's bedroom. He
was there with a naked Sarah. &quot;Drape her crosswise over the bed and hold
her down,&quot; he ordered. 

&quot;Please don't. I have done you no wrong sir�&quot;
Katherine started to plead but his lordship was already dispassionately
invading her cunt. He fucked quickly just to inseminate the woman and not for
any pleasure for him or her. In fact, once again, she only felt pain.

&quot;Your turn lads. I can see she's excited you. Get
those cocks out and stuff them in her arsehole. That needs opening up Martha
you hold her down.&quot; Lord Mersham gave his orders and watched as the two
footmen forced their pricks into the unwilling girl's tight hole. They were
sorry for her but they had to obey orders and actually enjoyed the sensation.
Sarah knelt between her master's thighs and gently sucked his cock.

When the second man had finished, Lord Mersham ordered
Martha to put the chastity belt on Katie and to bring her back to him in the
morning. Back in the maid's room, Kathy began complaining to Martha that the
belt was uncomfortable and that it chafed her welts. Martha just told her to
get pregnant as soon as possible and then it would come off but she did add
more fat under the leather straps and loosened them as much as she dared. It
wasn't unknown for the boys to sneak into the maid's room during the night.
&quot;When was your last woman's curse?&quot; she asked and on finding that it
was well over a week previously, commented that she could well be pregnant
already and then went on, &quot;Try to sleep Katie and don't disturb the others
with your moans. They'll come to bed soon and you'll all have to be up early
for work in the morning.&quot; Katie didn't see how she could possibly work in
the morning and yet she remembered how Mary had to work after she'd had the
butler thrash her.

Mary had a much easier time of it. She
lay snuggled on the down feather bed alongside Seb. They'd made love gently and
now Seb carefully questioned her about life in the Hathaway household. They
knew of Lord Hathaway's financial difficulties because a number of staff had
been dismissed and not replaced and they'd also heard the rumour that Katherine
was to be betrothed to John Beddingfield but she knew nothing of the lad.

&nbsp;

Chapter 4. Lord Hathaway

&quot;Where's that daughter of mine got to?&quot; Lord
Horace Hathaway shouted at the housekeeper, &quot;I was supposed to take her to
Lord Beddingfield's today.&quot;

&quot;I'm sorry Sir, I really don't know. She and her
maid left for Barfield the day afore yesterday and she hasn't been back since.
Maybe she's with Miss Hamilton Sir. She often stays overnight with her but not
usually for two days.&quot;

&quot;Get one of the older stable boys to ride over there
immediately and ask her to return forthwith. Go on, move yourself woman.&quot;
Hilda Travers hurried off wondering what sort of reception the boy would get if
he found Katherine.

Ruben also worried over that as he set off from Somersham
Manor. &quot;First I'll ask for Mary,&quot; he said to himself, &quot;I know
she normally stays with the ostler's wife.&quot; He rode briskly to the market
town and went directly to the ostler. &quot;Good day sir, Lord Hathaway has
sent me on this errand. Please can you tell me the whereabouts of Mary, Lady
Katherine's maid and her ladyship?&quot; he asked politely. &quot;His Lordship
urgently needs his daughter back at the manor.&quot;

The older man looked worried. &quot;You'll not find her
in Barfield young lad. She left two days back late in the afternoon. She'd been
to the dressmaker's and came here and ordered me to hurry and fix the horse in
her trap because she was late. She drove off at her usual pace like she could
fly the thing. You say Mary hasn't been back either?&quot; Ruben shook his
head. &quot;I don't like the sound of that lad. She's a nice young lady even if
her mistress doesn't treat her right. Something must have happened if they're
both missing. You'd have heard if her driving had upset the trap so she's
either gone elsewhere or them highwaymen waylaid them. You could try Miss
Hamilton to see if she knows anything or if 'er Ladyship might have planned
going elsewhere.&quot;

Ruben thanked the man and visited the dressmaker only to
be told the same story by the worried woman.

Horace Hathaway fumed when heard the news. &quot;Did she
find out about the proposed marriage and decide to go elsewhere? If that were
the case, who would have told her? Had someone gossiped to that maid of hers?
Did she have an accident? Was she waylaid?&quot; He sat and mentally debated
the possible scenarios. &quot;There's no one near that I know of that she is
likely to have gone to at that time of night so the first thing to do is to
send out search parties to look for anything that might give them some idea of
what happened. They would also ask villagers who lived along the route if the
can remember her passing. With the way Katherine drove that trap, she would
easily be noticed and remembered.

By nightfall nothing had been found but several people
remembered seeing the trap on the road from Barfield but all sightings ceased
after about four miles. After that point there were a couple of miles of
woodland without dwellings so they would only have been seen by those using the
road and it would be quiet at that time of day. &quot;If they were waylaid sir,
that would be the place to do it,&quot; Farrow, the head gamekeeper explained
to Lord Hathaway. &quot;We could ask Mr. Ballinger's permission to search the
woods first thing in the morning sir. I've no doubt he would give it and
provide some help too. Not much we can do until it gets light again sir.&quot;

Mr. Ballinger did indeed provide a party of men to help
with the search and it was one of them that found the broken trap on the
foreshore of the river. He later found the horse quietly grazing but prevented
from moving far by the reins that had snagged on a tree. Further searches for the
two ladies proved fruitless.

&quot;Excuse me sir,&quot; Hilda Travers tentatively
entered the drawing room where her master sat with his head in his hands.
&quot;It's about your daughter sir.&quot; His lordship looked up and scowled.
&quot;Sir, Jane here is friendly with the carter boy and he said he saw Mary
when he delivered stuff to Mersham Hall. She was in the kitchen but didn't get
to speak with her.&quot;

&quot;Did he see Katherine woman?&quot;

Hilda Travers pulled Jane into the room. &quot;No sir, I
asked him that. I wanted him to stay and speak with you but he only told me
when he was ready to leave. He said it was definitely Mary sir. He knows her
well enough,&quot; Jane answered.

Lord Hathaway immediately ordered his carriage and set
off for Mersham Hall only to find the main gates were closed. A burly man
stepped out of the gatehouse. &quot;I'm sorry sir, but Lord Mersham gave me
strict instructions on the pain of a severe flogging, not to open these gates
to you,&quot; said he.

&quot;Is my daughter, the Lady Katherine in there
man?&quot; Lord Hathaway asked. 

&quot;His Lordship also ordered me not to answer any
questions you might ask sir. I just have to ask you to leave sir.&quot; Several
other men appeared from the gatehouse to enforce the order and Lord Hathaway
was forced to return and consider his next move.

&quot;That lecherous sod Mersham knows that I have
thwarted his plans to expand on the quayside and perhaps he knows of my plans
for Katherine. Maybe he is holding her and I will get a ransom note for her
release shortly. That gatekeeper fellow will tell him of my appearance at the
gate so he will realise that I know he has my daughter. He can't demand much in
the way of money so it will be some concession for the quay. I can easily give
a little on that. I wonder how he is coping with Katherine's demands and wilful
behaviour? It's certainly a lot more peaceful in this house now. No doubt she's
demanded the finest room and wanted the finest foods and nagged him until he's
bought them. He can afford them anyway. Don't want to annoy him too much so I'd
better wait until the ransom note comes. Probably tomorrow.&quot; Lord Hathaway
turned restlessly in his bed before finally succumbing to sleep.

Nothing came the next day but on the following morning a
note was hand delivered&gt;

'Father, (I cannot now find it within me to use the greeting
'Dear Father'),

You probably have no idea of the suffering that your
action in bartering me to Lord Beddingfield for the sake of a few acres of land
and to get a little revenge on Lord Mersham, has caused me. I have been flogged
unmercifully and am being bred as if I was a lowly slave. Even writing this is
painful, as my hands are blistered and raw from the servant's work I am forced
to do and my posterior arse is welted from the so many thrashings that
it is painful for me to sit. Here I am not treated as a lady, your daughter,
but as the lowest slave. His Lordship is insisting that I write to inform you
in the most gruesome detail of my life here and the punishments I have received
and the ignominious raping I receive night and morning until it is clear that I
am with his child. This is my second attempt because his lordship deemed I left
too much of my suffering out of the first. Even now he is making me cross out
some words and use the very coarsest peasant language. 

Your plan to sell me to John Beddingfield as a virtuous
wife is no longer possible. Lord Mersham is the only one to have fuck me
in the proper orifice cunt but I have to frequently service other male
servants with my mouth and bottom arse hole. Hence I am treated like the
most despicable whore. Only when Lord Beddingfield changes his recommendations
to the committee, will I be released from this terrible servitude and by then I
will almost certainly be pregnant with his child because this is all happening
at the time when I am ripe to conceive. 

My servant Mary is also here but is treated far better.
She offered her body to one of the men who abducted us and is now his mistress
and has authority over me although she hasn't yet used it to harm me in any
way. But I must write and tell of our capture and the suffering that I have
been through.

We were travelling back from Barfield when two men held
us up and pointed pistols at our heads�'

Horace Hathaway wept tears of remorse and anger as he
read of his daughter's suffering at the hands of his rival.

'�This morning the butler welted my arse with a leather
belt because he deemed I had missed places when blacking the kitchen stove. For
this purpose I am held over the end of a table by two of the houseboys and my
short shift, my only piece of clothing apart from shoes, is raised. In front of
all those present, he gave me six hard whacks, which, on top of all the other
punishments, almost caused me to faint. Afterwards I was taken to his lordship
for my morning breeding. Not content with this, his lordship squeezed and
tormented my arse cheeks before I was returned to the kitchen to carry on with
my work.

Please father, be merciful and find a way to get me out
of this terrible place. Negotiate with him. Please I beg you not to try and use
force. He has threatened to hang me naked in the courtyard and flog me front
and back with a whip until I am scarred for life if you so much as send one man
on to the estate. I know he is cruel and will enforce his threat given the
slightest chance.

Katherine.

Lord Hathaway immediately sent for Roland Poppinjoy, his
advisor. It would take him at least an hour to get to Somersham Manor even if
he could be found straightaway. Meanwhile he pondered on the best course of
action. He wanted to get his daughter off his hands but be damned if he wanted
her in the clutches of Mersham. Despite her tantrums and wild behaviour, Horace
still loved Katherine and was devastated at her treatment. &quot;Withdrawing my
objections to his expansion plans will not make Lord Beddingfield and his
committee agree to them. It's almost too late now unless we can delay the
recommendations going before parliament. Beddingfield might wish to keep the
objections in place to spite me for not keeping better control of her.&quot;
Horace Hathaway was still turning the options over in his mind when Roland
Poppinjoy, arrived some two hours later. They spent several more hours drafting
a letter to Lord Mersham agreeing to a more limited extension of the quay
facilities. 

&quot;Take it yourself,&quot; advised Poppinjoy, &quot;I
will accompany you if you wish. We'll ask to speak with Lord Mersham but if he
refuses we can perhaps get the letter to him. We should also advise Lord
Beddingfield of the situation. He knows of Katherine's disappearance but not of
her�treatment.&quot;

Again, at the gate they were refused entry but the
gatekeeper agreed when a few coins were produced, to see the letter was placed
in Lord Mersham's hands. They rode to Lord Benningfield's mansion and informed
him of the events. Unfortunately he had yet to return from London but his aide
promised to inform him on as soon as his Lordship arrived home.

Horace miserably made the long journey back to Somersham
Manor and sat with Poppinjoy discussing possible scenarios to release Katherine
from Mersham's clutches.

&nbsp;

Chapter 5. John and Katherine

&quot;Where is the wench then Henry?&quot; Lord
Beddingfield asked.

&quot;Working in the kitchen somewhere I expect
Stephen,&quot; Lord Mersham answered, &quot;We weren't expecting a visit from
you and your son so I expect she's still in rags.&quot; 

&quot;Leave her be then for the moment. It will be nice
to see the haughty bitch down on her knees doing menial work. Perhaps we can go
somewhere quiet and have a pipe and discus your plans for the quayside. John
will be happy to go into outside and see what the gardeners are doing if you
have no objection.&quot;

It was now a month since Katherine's abduction and she
was only taken to Lord Mesham for breeding first thing in the morning. She'd
missed her period by at least a fortnight and everyone rightly believed she was
now pregnant with his child. Life as a servant still irked her greatly but it
had become a little easier for her and time went on. Most of the servants now
treated her as one of them and as her hands became callused and her muscles
strengthened, she was able to cope a little better with the work imposed on
her. Very quickly she'd learned to kerb her temper and to speak politely to
those in power above her and in turn they seemed more kindly disposed towards
her. Only the butler still showed a vindictive nature to her. Three or four
times a week she would have to bare her bottom and allow him to sodomise her
arsehole, which he did ruthlessly. Some of the other boys had her too but they
were more thoughtful and gentle used some lubrication before they entered her.

Twice when her spirits were at a low ebb, Sebastian, at
Mary's behest, ordered Katherine to his room early in the evening and allowed
her to quietly sleep in his bed. &quot;I know you're really worn out Katie and
need a good night without a visit from the butler or the boys,&quot; Mary said
to her the first time she entered their bedroom, &quot;You lie right on the far
side of the bed. I'll make sure Seb doesn't touch you but you'll have to ignore
what we do. Just face the other way if you don't wish to see him fucking me. Like
you I think I am pregnant and we're making plans to get married.&quot; Although
she still resented Mary's position in the household, she knew the girl was
trying to help her and even muttered her thanks.

Lord Beddingfield put the plans for the development aside
for reconsideration and would submit them to parliament later when he'd had
time to consider the personal ramifications. Lord Mersham was far richer than
Horace Hathaway and might well be induced to part with a few guineas or trade
some part of the development to ensure the expansion got the go-ahead. In
addition, Henry Mersham had Katherine in his power and he might still be able
to persuade her to marry his son. That would surely be preferable to her than
continuing as a skivvy at Mersham Hall. It wouldn't matter to John that her
child was not his as long as he could get his pecker into a woman's cunt, he
didn't mind. The paid whores he occasionally supplied to his son were fine for
the job but wouldn't make him a wife. For that he needed a woman with breeding
and some intelligence. Katherine seemed ideal. He could have put his proposal
to Mersham much earlier but decided to let Katherine stew as a servant for a
while longer. Perhaps then she would be more receptive to his plans for her.
&quot;If I can get her as part of the deal with Mersham, I won't have to fork
out when that fool Horace Hathaway gets into financial difficulties
again,&quot; he deduced.

The negotiations for getting Lord Beddingfield to support
the development were making slow progress. Both men knew the other's strengths
and weaknesses so after two hours they were only partway to an agreement.
&quot;Let's take a break Stephen and bring the girls in to relieve the
pressures in our balls,&quot; Lord Mersham suggested and shortly after Ruth and
Sarah came and danced and the orally satisfied both men. 

&quot;Henry, before we have lunch and start again, can we
speak about Katherine. You know of my interest in her for my son John and I
know you have an aversion to babies even if they are your own so I have no
doubt you will wish to get rid of her before then. Horace has done little to
get her back and I suspect he finds his house rather more peaceful without her.
Katherine is one of the inducements you could offer me for supporting your
project. However, if she is not compatible with John, then no amount of
inducement will do any good. He's a big lad as you can see and he is also very
big in the prick department. He's also very stubborn and if he doesn't take to
a woman, then he won't have her. I've paid good money for some girls and for
some reason he has just ignored them. Might I suggest we collect John and take
a look at Katherine while she is at work and see his reaction? If it is
favourable perhaps he could stay here for a day or two and use her as his
mistress?&quot; 

Surprising all the staff by their appearance in the
servants' domain, the three men entered the kitchen. They didn't need telling
where Katie was. Her cries led them to her. In a small side room the butler was
lambasting her arse with a strap. John's reaction to the sight of the naked
girl being thrashed caught everyone unawares. He lumbered into the room and
forcibly threw the butler against the side wall, released Katie's bindings and
picked her up in his arms, cradling her like a baby. &quot;You will not hit her
any more,&quot; John glared at the butler with hate in his eyes and spoke
slowly. &quot;I�ll take care of you my dear.&quot;

&quot;Her name is Katie, John. Would you like to take her
to your room and comfort her?&quot; Henry saw the opportunity to get the pair
together. When John nodded he ordered a houseboy to show the pair to a
guestroom. Henry and Stephen followed. &quot;We'll send some lunch up for you
John when it's ready and you can tend to her for as long as you like.&quot;
Lord Mesham went on, &quot;Lay her on the bed John and I'll remove this strap
for you.&quot; As he removed the chastity belt, he whispered in Katherine's
ear. &quot;On no account reveal your true identity.&quot; She knew better than
to disobey but guessed from the appearance of Lord Beddingfield that the gentle
giant of a man was his son. The man her father was bartering her for. She
looked at him with some fear when the others left her alone with him. She'd
heard rumours that he was daft and violent but for the moment, apart from his
size, he didn�t seem any different to most people or at least working people.
He certainly wasn�t what she expected for a lord�s son.

&quot;Hello Katie, I'm John. I'm going to look after you.
You will be my girlfriend and then they won't hit you. Do they have paste stuff
for your bottom here?&quot; Through her tears she nodded, yes and pointed to
the bell pull. Elsie came and John ordered her to get the fat for her bottom
and when it arrived, applied it very gently. Elsie stayed for a few minutes to
make sure John wasn't going to hurt the girl she had become friends with but
left when she saw the tenderness with which John treated her. Katie was most
surprised at his light touch and it was only when she turned that she saw the
way his breeches were bulging forward that she realised that she had aroused
him and that he was probably well endowed.

&quot;You have been beaten many times Katie,&quot; he
observed and gently touched the marks on various parts of her body, &quot;That
is not good. I'll not hurt you like that.&quot;

By the time Elsie and Mary arrived with lunch, Katie lay
cuddled in John's arms and he, like her, was naked. Both maids looked in awe at
the size of John's erect prick and wondered how Katie would fit it inside her,
if she had to. Katie had the same thoughts but for the moment, being held like
this was better than trying to work with a whipped backside. She knew that
while she was with John, no one dared touch her and if she played her cards
right, he might be the one to get her out of this place. Once outside she could
return to her father and her former life. Having his prick, big though it was,
inside her would surely be less painful than the butler's strap and he'd only
given her half his intended amount before John had knocked him to the floor.
He'd take his revenge on her arse if he got the chance.

As they sat on the bed with soft pillows supporting their
backs, John played with her while they ate lunch and even made her laugh for
the first time in a month. He played with her like she was a doll and lovingly
tickled and kissed her. A few weeks ago, in her other life, Katherine would
have been angered and openly hostile to such attention but now it felt
comfortable and pleasant. From the way he effortlessly handled her, Kate
realised the boy was enormously strong and yet he treated her like the most
delicate piece of porcelain. Treated her as though he cared about her, which
was more than anyone else had done for the past month or indeed for as long as
she could remember. Despite the playing John was concerned that she hadn't
eaten properly. She's lost a lot of weight and her ribs showed under her
breasts and her cheeks looked unnaturally hollow. &quot;I�ll feed you too. You
are all skin and bones now and you need more food in your belly and less
work,&quot; he informed her in a kindly way.

By the time they got to the dessert stage John's play had
become openly sexual. He daubed her nipples with cream from the pie and then
sucked it off. Then he put some on the head of his prick and Katie knew she had
to suck it from him too but after so many weeks of being fucked in the mouth by
the staff at Mersham Hall that was no problem. As she licked it clean she
wondered, &quot;How painful will it be to take this monster inside my cunt?
Will he force it down my throat like many men have tried already?&quot; He
didn't and she only had to suck the head clean and he carefully rubbed his
fingers up and down her back while she did so. Katie could tell John was
painfully hard and yet he made no attempt to fuck her.

&quot;Ooow!&quot; she squealed when John plastered her
cunt inside and out with the cream, &quot;That's cold.&quot; John's tongue soon
warmed it up and Katie quickly found she was becoming aroused and very wet.

&quot;I�d like to fuck you now please,&quot; John stated
but his voice made it more of a question. Kate nodded and didn't resist when he
opened her legs although she was afraid of the pain his entry might cause.
&quot;Say if I hurt you too badly. Please don't scream. Some girls are too
small for me and I really don't want to hurt you any more than you are
already.&quot; Kate was surprised by his concern but already her mind was determined
that her only way out of her hell here was with this odd man. Well boy, he
wasn't that much older than she was even if he was supposed to be mentally a
little retarded. His prick did hurt her but he entered slowly and with the
lubrication and arousal from his tongue work she hardly cried out except when
he was fully in and he lowered his massive form on top of her. Then it was more
from the pain of her arse pressing on the bed.

&quot;Lift your weight up a bit please John,&quot; she
pleaded and he did so. John started to gently fuck her with short strokes but
soon his lust took over and his strokes became longer and harder. For the first
time since her rape at Lord Mersham's hands, Katie started to thrust herself at
John. She remembered the way Mary thrust herself at Sebastian on the nights she
lay in their bed and tried to imitate her erstwhile maid. An orgasm overtook
her. It was the first in her short life and made John laugh with delight as he
too climaxed copiously within her. Still coupled with his barely softened prick
lodged firmly in her cunt, he rolled her on top of him and held her tightly to
his body. 

Fifteen minutes later John's prick returned to full
hardness and he sat Katie up on it. &quot;Katie, if you not too sore can we
bounce fuck?&quot; She had no idea what he wanted but she soon found out when
he raised and lowered her body. It hurt but nothing like the strap or the many
other times she'd been dry fucked. She was merrily bounce fucking when the
maids came to collect the lunch things and John had no intention of stopping.
Mary and Elsie looked at each other but said nothing as they quickly removed
the dishes and unwanted food. 

Outside the room they giggled at each other and in the
kitchen retold the episode in a slightly exaggerated way to the other servants.
&quot;I'm going to try it like that with Seb tonight,&quot; Mary laughed,
&quot;That way I get to control him!&quot;

An hour later, when they'd rested John said he would take
her into the garden to see the flowers. They'd both climaxed and this time John
withdrew his prick and, as she'd been accustomed to for the past month, Katie
automatically sucked him clean and was astounded when he returned the favour.
Elsie appeared when he rang the bell and he ordered her to get Katie's clothes.
For a moment the girl looked in askance at Katie but she nodded knowing the
only dress, if you could call it that, was a sack with cut-outs for her head
and arms. Fortunately she still had her shoes although they were now scuffed
and worn through crawling on stone floors when washing them. John was furious
when he saw the sack dress and Elsie shivered when he raised his voice to her.
&quot;These are not servants clothes. Where are hers? Clothes like yours.&quot;

&quot;That is all she has sir,&quot; Elsie stammered her
answer. 

&quot;Servants do not wear sacks!&quot;

&quot;She not really a servant sir,&quot; Elsie looked
frightened not knowing how she should reply, &quot;She's a sort of slave
sir.&quot;

John seemed to know it wasn't the girl's fault and said
in a more kindly voice, &quot;Find a suitable dress for her to accompany me
into the garden and for when we dine this evening.&quot;

&quot;Ask Mary, she's near to my size and Seb's bought
her new clothes. You don't dare ask his lordship.&quot; Katie tried to ease
Elsie's discomfort. While she was gone, John questioned Katie. &quot;What did
she mean when she said you were a sort of slave?&quot;

&quot;I was picked up on the road after an accident, of
which I remember nothing,&quot; Katherine lied. &quot;His lordship took a
dislike to me and kept me here to service his desires and to work as a lowly
skivvy.&quot;

&quot;So if you are a slave, you can be sold to me. I
will ask Henry to name a price for you. I will treat you better than
this.&quot; To his mind, that was an easy solution to the problem. Elsie
returned with a simple yellow dress of Mary's that Katie had seen he wearing on
many occasions. A few weeks ago, she wouldn't have been seen dead wearing it,
now it was her best, indeed it was her only outfit.

Hand in hand, John led her into the garden and directly
to the head gardener whom he had met earlier in the morning. &quot;Hello
Jim,&quot; he greeted the man, &quot;This is my new girlfriend. Her name is
Katie. Can I show her the orchids in the glasshouse please?&quot;

&quot;Good afternoon ma'am,&quot; Jim replied. He knew
about Katherine but picked up on John's words and gave no hint of her true
name. It was in the glasshouse that Katherine became aware that there was more
to John than him being a simple fellow. He and the gardener conversed at length
on the flowers and he showed Katie some of the minute details of their beauty
she would never have noticed. To her flowers were flowers, different colours,
different shapes, different smells but they were all just there to decorate the
house. Never had she considered the way they grew or the subtleties of their
form. He led her outside again and, still accompanied by Jim, took her to one
area after another. John's personality totally changed when he discussed
gardening with Jim. Gone was the hesitancy of speech to be replaced by a deep
knowledge and love of plants. Each shared their views on propagation and
methods used to get the best blooms. Katie noticed how delicately the huge man
could handle the delicate blossoms.

Though it hurt her to walk, Katherine enjoyed being
outside and nearly free. For the month she had been at the Hall, she'd only
been outside to scrub steps or to beat the mats or hang out washing. At one
point she had an indication of John's enormous strength. They came to a group
of four labourers that were trying to move a log that had become wedged between
two trees. It needed to be bodily lifted to clear a snag. With two men at each
end they were unable to lift it clear. John stepped in and took one end while
the four went to the other and with one lift they freed the log. The labourers
looked in amazement and expressed their thanks to him in down to earth terms,
not knowing that he was the son of a local lord.

All too soon for her, they had to go back in. John shook
hands with the gardener and was pleased when he was praised for his knowledge.
&quot;Please feel free to visit us at any time, sir. We'll always be glad to
see you.&quot;

&quot;And you'll be very welcome to visit our estate,
Jim. Indeed I hope we'll be able to make arrangements for you to do so.&quot;
John replied.

His father was still in negotiation with Henry Mersham
when John bounced in dragging Katie with him. She was deathly afraid of her
master's wrath. &quot;Father, I want to buy Henry's slave from him. I like her
and I want to have her as my girlfriend for always. Henry doesn't treat her
very well. I will. She can stay with me instead of you having to buy those other
women who I don't care for.&quot; 

Both men looked perturbed at the interruption. Katherine
went pale. But then Lord Beddingfield smiled benignly. &quot;I'll see if we can
arrange that for you John. Is she willing to come and live with us?&quot;

&quot;She's a slave daddy. We can buy her. She's my
girlfriend,&quot; John repeated.

&quot;Did she tell you she was a slave?&quot; Lord
Mersham asked sharply. Katie started to shake.

&quot;No sir, the other girl did when I asked why she
only had a sack for a dress. She said she was a sort of slave so perhaps she
isn't a real true slave. She had to borrow this yellow dress from another
girl.&quot; John looked a little upset at the thought of Katie not being a true
slave and then he might not be able to buy her.

&quot;Are you agreeable to living with John, Katie?&quot;
Lord Beddingfield asked.

&quot;If that is what you wish sir,&quot; Katie replied
hoping it wouldn't antagonise Lord Mersham too much.

For a few moments there was silence in the room before
Lord Beddingfield spoke. &quot;Katie, I will talk with Lord Mersham about
buying you but first I wish to be sure that is what John really wants. I know
from past experience that he is in love with a girl one day and not the
next.&quot; John tried to interrupt but his father silenced him. &quot;With
Henry's permission, I suggest that John stays here until Saturday. Until then
you can remain as his girlfriend and be with him, as he requires. I will send a
carriage on Saturday and if John still wants to keep you as his 'sort of
slave', then you may travel back with him. That is, of course, providing I can
agree terms with Lord Mersham for your release. That will give you three days
to get to know each other. Do you agree to that?&quot;

&quot;Yes sir,&quot; Katie answered trying to keep her
voice dull and not show any excitement that she might be freeing herself from
Lord Mersham's clutches.

That evening, while Lord Beddingfield still remained at
the Hall, she dined with them and the servants waited on her just as they would
have done at her home. However, now she didn't feel the same aloofness to the
servants and indeed she felt a greater awareness of their plight. At one point
when John was out of earshot, Lord Beddingfield whispered to her, &quot;I've
arranged terms with Henry and will inform your father but don't think you will
be running home to him. You know what the original arrangement for you was and
before long, unless anything goes seriously wrong between John and you, we'll
expect you to marry him. Eventually he will inherit my estate and you will be
more or less in charge of it all.&quot; He didn't have a chance to say more
before John returned. His father left soon after and rather than be near to
Lord Mersham, Katie asked John to take her to their room. He did � by picking
her up and carrying her like a baby up the stairs. 

*****

&quot;What's wrong John?&quot; Katie asked anxiously. She
lay close alongside him and in the early morning light, could see a tear run
down his cheek. She knew he'd had a restless night but had no idea why. They'd
lived at 'The Crickets' the Beddingfield family home now for a week and
everything had appeared to be going smoothly. The marks on her body were fading
and she was again putting on a little weight. Often he took her out walking in
the fresh air or pottering in his beloved garden. John still treated her like a
living doll one that he could fuck, which he did regularly. Katie could now
take him with relative ease and usually enjoyed their sessions. She felt
protected by John's enormous size and his placid behaviour and had become used
to being treated as his mistress although he still told everyone that she was a
slave he'd bought. No one believed him but they went along with it and smiled
and nodded and said they were pleased for him.

&quot;What is the matter John? Why the tears?&quot; She
asked again.

&quot;Lady Katherine Hathaway�&quot; John's voice failed
for the moment. 

Tears sprang unbidden from Katherine's eyes as she moved
away from him, her mind in turmoil. She knew that sooner or later he would find
out but hoped it was later. The risk of being sent back to the terror of
Mersham Hall was still very much in her mind. &quot;How long have you
known?&quot; she asked quietly.

&quot;I guessed when that girl at the Hall said you were
a sort of slave,&quot; John answered proudly as if it was a great achievement
to have worked it out. &quot;I knew of your disappearance. Your father came
here once. The maids talk too. It's time we talked truthfully Katie.&quot;

&quot;What are you going to do?&quot; Her mind registered
that if he'd known that long, the chances of her staying with him were fairly
high. He might send her home and back to her former life but what sort of life
would she have? She was pregnant. John knew that and must have guessed the
child wasn't his. Would he keep it? She believed he might. He was a caring
person, unlike the child's real father.

John waited for several minutes before hesitatingly
replying. &quot;I cannot keep you here as a pretend slave, Katie. Your father
will probably want you back or he may want Henry to have you again. I don't
want you to go back there. They hurt you too bad.&quot; He paused then went on,
&quot;No! I won't let them do that. I bought you from him even though you were
not a real slave. Your father is probably upset and will want you back�I don't
want to give you back�&quot;

&quot;John, stop.&quot; Katie interrupted him and put her
arms around his neck. &quot;John, I, Lady Katherine Hathaway give myself to
John Beddingfield as a sort of slave for as long as he wants me. I do this
willingly. Will you take me as a sort of slave John? I was only a pawn in
father's political game. You actually love and care for me. Please say you won't
send me back.&quot;

In a voice filled with emotion John stuttered, &quot;I
accept�you�Katherine Hathaway�as my�sort of slave.&quot; He pulled her close
and for a while they both wept, both knowing they were truly together now.
