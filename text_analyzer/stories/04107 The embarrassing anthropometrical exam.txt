THE EMBARRASSING ANTHROPOMETRICAL EXAM





I am female, 36 years old, natural blond, 1.68 meters (5'6") and weigh 51 kg 

(112 lbs).&nbsp; I have partaken in many sports and until today I thought that

I was in quite good shape.



I have resolved to tell you all my story.&nbsp; The story, I believe, that 

has had a great deal of influence on my current sexual fantasies.&nbsp; 

This story is absolutely true.&nbsp; Except for a few female friends, I have 

told no one else.&nbsp; My husband knows as well, of course, except that he 

has no idea how it began.



Well, it happened in November, eleven years ago.&nbsp; I was already 25 and 

lived in a small rural community.&nbsp; I needed a new prescription for 

the birth-control pill; consistent with how I always did things, I 

made an appointment with my family doctor, whom I had previously seen

for several years.&nbsp; He was a fatherly type, in his mid-50's, quiet and

agreeable in his manner.&nbsp; He lived alone, was respected in our little

town, and kept his small, clean practice in the first floor of a 

single-family house.&nbsp; Because of the poor, one-room nature of our

village and the small entrance area, the doctor was not open to paying 

for a medical assistant and did everything alone.&nbsp; 

Technically, he was "only" a general practitioner, not a specialist, but 

the next closest gynecologist, from whom one would normally seek a Pill 

prescription, had his practice about 20 km (12 miles) away.&nbsp; As I said, 

I knew this doctor for many years and a prescription for the Pill was 

really not a problem.&nbsp; It would take at most no more than 5 minutes and 

I would be on my way without an examination.



So it was this time.&nbsp; I sat in his small office, across from him behind 

his desk.&nbsp; As usual, he casually inquired after my health, filled out 

the prescription, and handed it over to me.&nbsp; I wanted to depart, as he 

asked me if I was in very much of a hurry.&nbsp; As I was not, he asked me to 

take a seat.&nbsp; He revealed to me that he was busy at this time with studies 

in anthropometrics.&nbsp; We chatted a few minutes about this and he 

explained that he was directly involved in scientific work on the subject of 

constitutional-analysis.&nbsp; 



To this end, he had to accumulate statistical data from several women 

and he mentioned that I was in the correct age group for that if I 

wanted to help him after this pep talk.&nbsp; It would only take a short 

while, a few questions et cetera. I was curious, I also had a little

time, and I wanted to help out.&nbsp; He took a folder filled with documents

from his desk drawer, entered my personal data, and we began to fill out

a questionnaire: nothing out of the ordinary (usual medical history,

for example childhood diseases, possible operations, allergies, et cetera; 

which sports and how much exercise I enjoyed; daily nutrition; if 

and which medication I took, and so on).



At the completion of this he asked me to go behind the privacy curtain 

and undress down to my undergarments.&nbsp; I had not reckoned on having an 

examination.&nbsp; But what should I do?&nbsp; Would it divide us, if I did not go 

along?&nbsp; Beside for that, he was my doctor and had often examined me 

previously.&nbsp; So I went behind the privacy curtain, undressed down to 

my underwear and placed my clothes on a wall hook that I saw.&nbsp; As I 

reappeared, he led me to another room that I was not familiar with 

before this.&nbsp; It was a small room with a garden view.&nbsp; Its two windows

lower parts were glazed with milk glass (opaque glass) in order to 

hinder outside glances.&nbsp; The floor was laid with clear linoleum and 

the walls were whitewashed.



The room was sparsely furnished. I remember a tray upon which a 

dozen peculiarly intriguing instruments lay glittering. A weight-scale

standing at - and scales to measure the hight mounted on the wall.

In a corner of the room stood a big pedestal with two stairs.

The doctor began by determining my hight and weight. Then he helped me

onto the pedestral and I stood on top of this.&nbsp; From the 

ceiling of the room hung some sort of a see-through curtain divided 

into a grid pattern. The doctor positioned me behind this curtain 

and explained to me that now I needed to be photographed from the 

front, from the side, and from behind.&nbsp; That was absolutely not 

alright with me, because I obviously did not want such photos 

of me to be in circulation.&nbsp; To this the doctor said that 

the highest level of data protection was accomplished and that 

the photos would not be released as part of his work.&nbsp; Two spotlights 

were turned on, which brightly lit the corner in which I found myself. 

The doctor lifted a tripod-mounted camera, fussily positioned 

himself behind it, and began to shoot the photos.&nbsp; I had to 

stand as straight as a candle, my hands laid by my side, feet together.&nbsp; 

After that he re-oriented the grid to me and made a side view of me.

The same procedure again was used for my rear view.



Now he additionally turned on a strong ceiling light and explained, that

the following part of the examination will entail a list of bodily measure-

ments and proportions. With the prepared instruments (various compasses, 

measuring tapes, gages, metal calipers) he began measuring my facial

dimensions. Shoulder, waist, hip, chest girth, legs, arms and other features

of my body were next.

Absolutely almost everything was measured: length, circumference,

angles. Everything was painstakingly recorded in his notes.

Also characteristics such as hair color, obvious veins, eye color, birthmarks,

skin character and color were recorded. To look at the fine hairs on my face 

and body he used a loupe.&nbsp; Shortly, no detail was left out. At first I found

it totally exciting. But I had to assume more and more embarrassing positions

to allow these observationes to be made and found it increasingly unpleasant.

 

At the completion of this, he asked me to remove my bra. Now he did not 

feel my breasts as he did previously on the occasion of a precautionary

examination but took them into account from all perspectives.&nbsp; I had 

to lift and lower my arms, then fold them behind my body with the palms

pressed together as if in prayer. I had to "shake" my breasts and, with my

hands supported on the back of a chair, bend forward.&nbsp; 

The doctor made his notations about form, size, and consistency of my breasts;

the color and the appearance of my areolae and nipples.

Also the length and diameter of my nipples and areolae were measured precisely.

Finally, at this point in time I regretted my resolution to make myself available.

To me, everything was terribly painful now.



Next, he called upon me to remove my panties.&nbsp; Now I was really surprised.

Until now he had never examined me "down below" or seen me totally naked.

I mulled over shortly what I should do and asked if this must definitely continue

like this.&nbsp; He complained about my questions and justified them with a few medical 

expressions that I did not understand.&nbsp; So, I hesitantly came over to his wishes. 

Again, now fully nude, I&nbsp; had to take up humiliating positions to allow the doctor

to review my body from all desired angles.

&nbsp; 

He asked me whether I had altered my hair in the genital area in some way

(through shaving, depilation, or otherwise), when the shape of my hair in this

region had formed, et cetera.&nbsp; Furthermore, he recorded all this information:

pubic hair color, distribution, thickness, structure, length, as far as I know. 



I thought that finally everything was over and I could get dressed once again.

But the doctor said that he would need me for a short time and led me back to his

usual examination room.

There I had to lie on the examination table. The doctor lifted a new instrument 

from his cabinet, prepared it, and washed his hands.&nbsp; I feared something bad.

And immediately I was asked to bend my legs and to open my thighs as wide as possible. 

I refused to do this next thing, until I finally heard his fatherly encouragement

that I did not need to be shy or self-conscious before my doctor.&nbsp; He shoved a pillow underneath my bottom, adjusted a lamp, and bent between my spread legs.&nbsp; Never will I

forget his guttural "Aahh, verrry nice!"&nbsp; I would have preferred to die!



Now he took an instrument, the likes of which I have never seen before or since.

At first glance it looked a bit like a shears.&nbsp; I could not see everything because I was lying rather helplessly on my back. This instrument was in any case used to spread my large vagina lips (labia major) and to hold them open. I noticed that it had an adjustable

stop ring with which to regulate the spread.&nbsp; The doctor fixed it in a position and contemplated my genital region. He plied various rods and sticks, which felt ice cold and made various notes. Finally he removed the terrible instrument, but pulled my vagina lips apart from each other only with his fingers. He also felt my smaller vagina lips (labia minora) and pulled them out to their limits.&nbsp; That really hurt!&nbsp; I dared not to breathe!&nbsp; 

I thought only a little movement and he would rip me "down there." The doctor, however, seemed unimpressed; he took some sort of a circular compass measurement and set his measurements down. It seemed to take an eternity.&nbsp; At last he began to do the same to my clitoris.&nbsp; He uncovered a sizable portion of my glans and measured this with some sort of a stencil.



Finally I was permitted to get dressed again. He thanked me very much for my assistance.

I was completely speechless.&nbsp; Irritated and bewildered, I went home.&nbsp; I never went back to this doctor. Soon thereafter, I moved.



Even today, I did not know if that was really a scientific examination, or perhaps some type of misuse of authority.&nbsp; I really have not thought about it too much. I was just too na�ve.&nbsp; In any case, I have never heard from anyone else who has undergone the same. And I would believe that such studies - if ever - are performed at the University of a big town rather than in an office of a country ddoctor. 



Incomprehensible to me is only:



Even though I have rather bad memories of the above represented scenario and at the time certainly received no lustful feelings or the like, I today have a tic (or twitch) that stimulates me, if I play through this situation in my mind's eye once again.
