Dominant Black Tales and Submissive White Tails

Synopsis: Dominant Black Couple seduce and reduce a white man to his true place of submission.Did she have a hidden agenda? Was her desire to dominate white men driven by
  some racial hatred or need to seek revenge for her enslaved ancestors? By all
  outward appearances, that would appear to be the case. But Mistress Desire
  was far more complex than superficial appearances would allow. Black, strong,
  confident, and proud, there was no mistaking that the Domina was proud of her
  African heritage and took pleasure in reducing her white submissives to whatever
  it was that they feared the most. There was a certain subtlety she possessed
  that could not be defined by labels. 
She chose to meet him in a very public bar. It was a gay bar in fact, and
  it was on the evening of the citywide famous drag show. Queens weren't the
  only people in attendance, butches, studs, lipsticks, straights, bisexuals
  and everyone in between showed up to revel in the god damned decadence and
  defiance the night represented. Anyone who wanted to thumb their nose at the
  status quo and acknowledge that they couldn't be defined sexually by the strict
  and puritanical morals of the Bible belt felt comfortable showing up. There
  was plenty of hootin' and hollerin' for the glammed up female impersonators
  doing yet another rendition of �Rollin on the River� and �It's Raining Men.� Her
  date for the evening did not fit in that category. After hours of subtle interrogation,
  she had determined that his greatest fear was being seen for who he really
  is. He was an introvert, a social recluse of sorts that wanted to keep his
  desires hidden from everyone, including himself. Inside, he was a slut. Not
  just any slut, a slut of the most insatiable, perverted, depraved kind. He
  wanted someone to force him to bring out his dark fantasies and help him to
  become who he felt he really was inside. 
She was taking a chance that he wouldn't show but she was betting that the
  chemistry and the desperation he felt to fulfill his desires would be motivation
  enough for him to make the leap into the unknown. She positioned herself at
  the far end of the bar at a table where she could see him enter. If her assessment
  was wrong and he didn't show up, she would entertain herself with the spectacle
  of others that wanted to exhibit their sexuality for the entire world to see.
  He hadn't cum in over three weeks and he had been nightly aroused with descriptive
  tales of her fantasies and desires. The Internet and the phone were vastly
  different than the adventure he was about to go on however. 
Stevie Wonder could have seen him walk through the front door. Nervous as
  hell, he looked around the place needing only the tiniest of excuses to turn
  around and leave. The promises of mind-blowing strapon anal assaults and wild,
  uninhibited sexual release propelled him to move forward. He spotted her immediately.
  She didn't have to signal for him or make her presence known to him; she exuded
  the regal stature whereby he knew her immediately. He made his way to her table
  and she had his favorite drink waiting for him. He downed it with one gulp
  and nervously looked around taking in all the sights. 
�Brian, did you do as I instructed?� He lifted his arm that had been lying
  casually in his lap above the table and showed his baby smooth, hairless body;
  the only hair remaining on his body being under his arms and above the neck.
  She placed her hand under the table and felt for the evidence of his other
  command. Apparent through his clothes was a harder than steel erection and
  the telltale signs of a cock ring. He swallowed hard as she stroked him through
  his clothes, knowing full well that he couldn't cum restrained as he was. They
  settled back and began to converse; controlling the flow of the exchange with
  her eyes and her will. He knew he was being dominated and it was more than
  sexual. 
She draped her legs over his and he instinctively began to massage her silken
  calves. He swallowed hard as he glanced down and realized that her pussy was
  exposed just inches away from him under her short dress. �Listen, can we get
  out of here? I did what you asked and I'm just not comfortable here,� he stammered,
  his eyes darting around the room to make sure no one he knew was there. She
  laughed politely and ignored his comment, stroking his exposed arm and caressing
  his face with her soft fingertips. 
As the lights dimmed and a slow song began to play to supplement the time
  between performances, they were interrupted by the most breathtaking Black
  man in the bar approaching the table. Dressed impeccably, not a bit shy of
  6'2�, masculine, and looking like he stepped off the pages of a magazine, he
  extended his hand to the nervous submissive and said, �Would you care to dance?� 
�No thanks, I'm not gay,� Brian managed to eek out, looking like a dear caught
  in headlights more than unassuming business professional that wielded so much
  confidence at his place of work. 
�He'd love to,� Desire answered, moving her legs and placing her submissive's
  hand gently in that of his suitor's. 
He was in a state of shock. He had specifically told Mistress Desire that
  he wouldn't do anything with another man. He was straight. The confusion in
  his eyes, the panic, the anger overwhelmed him. He had limits that were not
  negotiable. Being submissive and being gay were too different things. �He stood
  firm on his decision, �No thanks,� he said with determination, �I'm not gay.� 
He reached for his keys in his pocket and began to stand. �Listen, I don't
  know what sort of games you are playing but I'm not interested, Go fuck yourself
  bitch.� 
Desire laughed at his defiance and placed her hand gently on his arm and leaned
  in close. Her voice was sweet and gentle. �Brian, you are standing on the verge
  of all of your dreams come true. Before you leave, think about everything that
  we've been through to get to this point, are you willing to throw it all away
  for a dance? Think of all the nights online where your heart felt like it was
  pounding out of your chest and you were begging me to use you in any way possible.
  Think about the things you went through to gain my favor. You know I'm the
  only woman that can push you past your fears. Are you ready to throw that all
  away for a silly little dance? If you leave, you'll go home and jerk off in
  solitude dreaming of the things that could have been. Do you want to do that
  Brian? Do you want to abandon the potential for your wildest fantasies to come
  true?� 
Her voice never went above a whisper. �You can leave you little bitch but
  don't you dare think of contacting me again. Think about trying to find another
  Mistress like me that will make you feel like the depraved dirty slut that
  I bring out in you. Haven't you always wanted to be the submissive bitch boy
  to a superior Black domme? The night of indescribable sensation that you've
  waited for is there for you. All you have to do is dance. Go! I won't think
  about you ever again, but can you say the same thing about me?� 
The synapses in Brian's brain were misfiring. He was pissed and aroused. The
  gentleman waiting for the dance chimed in, tired of waiting and said, �Listen,
  don't worry about it.� He turned to walk away. 
�Wait,� Brian said meekly. Desire leaned even closer, the warmth of her body
  penetrating Brian's aura. She whispered something in his ear and leaned back.
  Brian stood, fighting back the tears, and said with defiance in his voice, �Wait,
  I'd love to dance.� He knew that the dance was not the not to be the end of
  his test. 
Slightly shorter than this beautiful specimen of a man before him, he didn't
  even know where to place his hands. His dance partner took control. He placed
  Brian's arms around his neck and pulled Brian close. Brian swallowed hard,
  his frustration showing in the color in his cheeks. The alcohol in his system
  allowed him to relax just enough, knowing that this humiliation would be over
  in less than three minutes. He shut out the people around him and danced, it
  was more like moved to the music; he was never really that good of a dancer.
  Brian had to hold on to reality. He was getting confused. The arms around his
  waist made him feel sexy. A feeling of security and arousal enveloped him.
  The sexy black shoulder that he rested his head upon was comforting. He could
  feel full lips brush against his neck and he yielded to the temptation to moan
  ever so slightly at the sensation. Strong Black hands caressed his ass. He
  froze momentarily; his ass had always been a highly erogenous zone for him
  but he made sure that he only fantasized about women taking him there. But
  behind the safety of his closed eyes, in the secure embrace of the beautiful
  man that held him, he erotically thrust his ass back and forth, fantasizing
  about being fucked by his Mistress later on. The hands grabbing his ass were
  forceful and he loved the sensation of being taken . . . forced, which only
  cause him to grind his ass harder and harder against his dance partner. 
�Uhmmm, the song's over. Would you like another dance?� Brian was snapped
  back into reality. 
�No . . . hell no! I was just dancing with you because . . . No.� Brian knew
  his defensiveness was transparent but he had to maintain his fa&ccedil;ade
  of defiance if only for his own sense of well-being. 
Back at the table, Mistress Desire chuckled as Brian slid into the seat next
  to her. The Black gentleman slid into the booth across from them. �You were
  so right Desire, his little cock was hard the entire time. And the way he was
  grinding his ass on me, I can tell he's going to be one hot fuck.� 
�I told you his slutty side would come out, Derrick. When will you learn to
  trust me?� Their laughter burning his ears like acid would burn his flesh.
  They were sitting there causally discussing his little cock, his slutty nature,
  and the plans that they had made to in advance. Brian was incensed. He fumed
  at the thought that this was all a set up and he mumbled something under his
  breath. He stood to rise and leave when the gentleman said, �Sit down, bitch.
  We didn't tell you that you could leave.� 
A lump formed in his throat as Brian felt helpless to move. His cock had no
  such limitations. It was raging hard and hurting from being constrained as
  it was. The casual power that the Black man had over him at that moment made
  him feel like the submissive slut he had longed to feel like. He wondered momentarily
  if they had slipped something in his drink to make him have . . . you know,
  those kinds of thoughts. 
�What's going on here? I thought . . .,� he was mumbling incoherently. Desire
  giggled and ignored him momentarily. 
�Oh, forgive my manners. Brian, I would like you to meet Derrick. He's my
  lover. We like to play together. He's the male version of me, don't you think?
  Derrick. . . you've already met Brian.� The rapid eye movement of Brian indicated
  confusion. �You didn't honestly think someone as breathtaking as him would
  actually be attracted to someone like you, did you?� She laughed even louder,
  Brian afraid that her amusement would be draw attention to them. He felt unattractive
  with her comment but that somehow aroused him even more. He wondered what people
  would think, a white man sitting there with two Black people. He was sure everyone
  in the place could read his mind. Brian couldn't even discern his own thoughts
  at that moment. All sorts of thoughts ran through his mind about what the two
  of them had in mind for him. He feared the outcome if he decided to let them
  go through with their plans and he was terrified of letting the extreme sensation
  of arousal that he was experiencing go. 
For years, his attraction to Black women had consumed his every fantasy. He
  loved their strength and their assuredness. He loved their comfort and sophistication.
  White women hadn't aroused him in the better part of four years or more. They
  were insignificant to him except on the rare occasion he fantasized about having
  a white wife that would be a slut for black cock. Occasionally, he would dream
  of having a white wife that craved huge black cocks fucking her mouth, pussy
  and asshole unmercilessly while he served the Black wives of those men in whatever
  degrading or humiliating ways they saw fit. Those thoughts didn't seem realistic,
  his conservative wife would never think of such things, so he dismissed them
  as a fleeting fantasy. He was comfy defining himself as submissive to Black
  women. A submissive of the most extreme proportions. If he were to allow himself
  to be honest and frank about his own desires, there had been many nights he
  has dreamt of being forced to be a cross-dressing sissy for Black cock, but
  he wanted to be �forced� so he could absolve himself of the guilt of desiring
  those yummy Black studs. He allowed himself to freely fantasize about Black
  women all the time, and all the things that he would do for them. 
�Let's go,� her directive was simple and to the point. Out into the night
  air, Brian had more reservations. All the �ifs� and the �what ifs� and logistics
  were causing him to panic. He stood helpless, like a child, waiting for further
  instruction. They were in control. 
Derrick and Mistress Desire kissed in the darkness and shadows of the parking
  lot. They held hands and ignored Brian but they were ever aware of his presence
  behind them as they made out while he watched. They approached an SUV and opened
  the back door and Derrick turned momentarily to tell Brian to get in. Other
  than that, they were ignoring him as if he was insignificant to their arousal.
  Brian, on the other hand, was mesmerized watching them kiss. Their skin looked
  so . . . different. They seemed so . . . powerful. It was intoxicating to watch
  them together. 
He stepped in the back seat and closed the door behind him as he regretted
  not telling someone whom he was going to meet, getting some significant contact
  information from this woman in case something went wrong. Derrick drove while
  he and Desire chatted and laughed and occasionally looked in the rear view
  mirror. He went to adjust his cock as it had been hard for hours before meeting
  her and the dull ache in his nuts was a sweet and painful reminder of that
  fact. He wanted those nuts to be kicked, slapped, and twisted at the hands
  of the gorgeous mistress that sat in the passenger side of the truck in front
  of him. His boypussy was throbbing thinking about being fucked savagely. The
  pair in front of him seemed so sensuous, so oblivious to his presence, he wondered
  if they would forget about him and leave him to stroke his hard cock while
  he watched them make love or if he would be allowed to cum at all. 
His thoughts were about to be answered as they pulled into the driveway of
  a lovely home. It was secluded and well maintained and more fears crept into
  his mind. He had more fears and more fantasies of what was to come as well.
  Desire slid the door open and said, �Get out.� He complied eagerly, in a fog
  of lust at that stage from the hours of pent up arousal. 
As he stepped into the night air again, Brian felt more alive than he had
  ever felt in his life. Mistress Desire circled him, her body close without
  touching him. She ran her nails along the side of his face lightly, sending
  chills down his body. �Undress,� she said calmly. 
Brian looked around confused. Surely she was not going to make him undress
  in the driveway. It was too early in the evening; people were awake, watching
  television, someone might see. 
�Undress now!� 
As if in a trance, Brian began to undress in the middle of the driveway. Derrick
  had entered the house and was nowhere in sight. He wasn't sure what to do with
  his clothes so he folded them as he undressed and placed them in a neat pile
  on the ground. He removed his shoes first, feeling more comfortable with that
  accessory than a major piece of clothing. He removed his shirt next. At that
  moment, he wished he had the smooth, rippling muscles that most black men seemed
  to have and he felt ashamed of his pale complexion. Next to go were his pants.
  His tightie whities bulged obscenely in the front from the erection he was
  sporting and the cock ring in place. He pulled his socks off and stood in anticipation
  of his next command. He felt even more naked because he was hairless. Somehow
  it made him feel more vulnerable. 
�I said undress.� Her voice was so damned soothing and melodic, he felt helpless
  to deny her anything. 
He slid his underwear down, his erection bobbing in the night air. Even at
  full erection, he was barely six inches. He always told inevitable Internet
  lie that he was six inches erect but that was only in the most extreme state
  of arousal. Tonight, he was convinced he might be a little more than six even. 
Mistress Desire stroked his cock in the cool night air. The sensation was
  indescribable. Her hands were so soft and silky, he was under her control,
  people could be watching and he knew that he had planned a night to explore
  his wildest fantasies. He moaned out loud as she stroked him with skill. 
�Tell me what you want, Brian. Tell me why you are here.� 
The words came tumbling out of his mouth as if they had been rehearsed. �I
  want to be used by you, my superior Black queen. I want you to put me in my
  place as the inferior white boy that I am. I want you to take out your frustrations
  on me and make me your bitch. Humiliate me, Mistress. Force me to do unspeakable
  things. I want you to show me that you have power over me. Use me any way you
  see fit, Mistress. I belong to you.� 
The more he confessed his desires, the more she stroked him. This Black woman,
  fully dressed, masturbating a completely nude white male in, seemingly her
  front yard, making him spill his guts. If anyone were looking they would have
  gotten an eyeful. 
�Put your clothes in the backseat and bend over with your hands on the floor
  of the truck. He did what he was instructed to do and waited even further instruction. 
�Let's see if this pussy is as slutty as you claim it is,� she mused. 
She spread his ass cheeks and rubbed her fingertip over his hole. He let out
  a slight moan. His knees were shaking and he was glad that he could brace himself
  on the frame of the truck, his ass exposed for the entire world to see. Mistress
  Desire slid her finger in to his unlubricated hole. That was nothing to him,
  he had gotten so used to fucking himself he actually leaked �pussy juice� as
  he called it when he was horny. His ass was always ready to be penetrated by
  a huge, black dildo any time of the day or night. She began fingering him harder,
  driving him to maniacal fits of pleasure. 
She was giving him more pleasure than he had ever imagined. Gone were all
  inhibitions and he was anxious for more. �Oh, yessssss, Mistress. Finger my
  pussy, pleaaase.� If her fingers were just a little longer, she could have
  reached his spot. She knew exactly what she was doing and she worked his pussy
  like a pro. 
She pulled her fingers out of his ass abruptly, causing him to cry out, his
  moans echoing off the cul-de-sac serenity. �Get on your hands and knees and
  crawl to the front door. Wait there until you are allowed in.� With that, she
  walked away up the walkway and entered the home. 
Brian was lost. He stood shakily and closed the truck door quietly, hoping
  not to draw any more attention than his previous moans and display had garnered.
  He willingly got on his hands and knees and crawled on the walkway to the front
  door. His hands and knees ached from the concrete but he relished the pain
  in anticipation of his fate to come. He knelt submissively at the door and
  waited. He suspected that they were watching him so he posed like a prize animal
  at a show. He arched his back and thrust his ass high in the air, showing that
  he was ready for anything. He lowered his head in submission, to prove that
  he was lowly and insignificant. His erection couldn't be seen in his kneeling
  position but it was red from arousal and restraint. He wanted to be beautiful
  to all the eyes watching him, to whomever they may have belonged. He didn't
  care if the nosey neighbors saw him, in fact, he wanted them to see him for
  who he really was. He wanted to be on display as a submissive to Blacks and
  he was proud of that fact. 
In an instant, the porch lights were turned on and he was flooded with light.
  He maintained his composure and pride, sticking his ass out even more and lowering
  his head to the ground. His asshole was throbbing and desperate for penetration
  and his soul craved humiliation. At that moment, the door opened and he heard
  his Mistress command him to come in. He crawled forward with confidence and
  agility. 
She stroked him like a pet, running her hands through his hair and down his
  back. Brian purred like a kitten and humped the air like a bitch in heat. She
  placed a collar around his neck but he was afraid to tell her it was a little
  too tight so he suffered in silence. It was a good discomfort, one he would
  gladly suffer for the Divine Mistress that stood above him. She put a leash
  on his collar and pulled him in the direction of a back room. The carpet under
  his knees felt good compared to the concrete but the pain in his nuts was ever
  present. 
She opened the door to a playroom and pulled him in unceremoniously. The furnishings
  were sparse but there was no denying it was a room for hedonistic desires.
  Not quite a dungeon and far from a spare bedroom, there were toys and tables,
  and chairs that had been designed for play. Derrick was there, naked and erect,
  oiled and glistening, a vision of ebony perfection. She dropped the leash and
  commanded Brian to stay, like a puppy being trained. Desire and Derrick conspired,
  whispering and planning what to do with their toy. Derrick assisted her in
  undressing, the way they interacted making them look like dancers more so than
  anything else. Her body was a work of art. Her skin looked like the smoothest
  velvet and her curves were a sculptor's dream. 
She walked over to a table and picked up a strapon. Derrick helped her put
  it in place as Brian began to whimper unconsciously at the thought of what
  was to come. �Silence, bitch,� as she continued to secure her harness and what
  looked like a nine inch black dildo to her sleek frame. Brian was dizzy with
  lust and confusion. 
Desire sat in a chair and motioned for Brian to come closer. �This, my pet,
  is going to be very simple. You are going to suck my dick until you prove that
  you are a cock craved whore and then you are going to get your slutty white
  boycunt pounded by the most formidable Black cock that you've ever seen. Does
  that sound okay with you?� 
Brian nodded furiously as he was anxious to get underway. She leaned back
  in the chair casually and Brian took in every inch of her beauty. Her face
  was a face that could launch a thousand ships, her body was athletic and toned.
  Her nipples were dark and puffy and Brian longed to feel them in is mouth.
  Her legs were out of this world. They seemed to go on forever. She stroked
  her strapon like it was real flesh. He approached her with confidence. He had
  sucked his own toys enough to know exactly how to do it. He had prepared himself
  to deepthroat dildos that didn't look humanly possible to swallow. 
His assault was calculated. He wanted to show her a cocksucker like she had
  never seen before. He had often fantasized what it would be like to have such
  a huge dick and he had practiced sucking his toys the way he would want his
  cock sucked if he were a black man. He maintained eye contact with her as he
  began to lick sensuously up and down the shaft. He licked the head and circled
  it with his tongue and began stroking it with his hand methodically. He licked
  up and down the shaft, inching his mouth closer and closer to the sweet pussy
  that lay underneath, the scent of it making his little red cock leak profusely
  with precum. He placed his mouth over the head and began his descent. Barely
  more than half of it was in his mouth and it was already hitting the back of
  his throat. It was thicker than he had ever sucked before but he was determined
  to show her that he was a good slut for her. 
Her words fueled his passion to do an even better job. �Come on you dirty
  white cocksucker, show me what a slut you are for my juicy black cock. Suck
  my beautiful black dick. Tell me you love it.� 
He went into a cocksucking frenzy. �Yes, Mistress. I'm in love with your big,
  black cock. It tastes so good in my mouth. I love being your white cocksucker.
  Feed me your cum.� He was sucking harder and faster, taking it deeper and deeper.
  His spit was dripping down the side; he wanted to be like the white whores
  he saw in all the videos that gave messy blowjobs. 
She grabbed the back of his head and forced him all the way down on her �cock.� He
  choked and gasped for air and he felt like he was going to pass out. The head
  of the black toy was deep in his throat and he felt like he was going to puke.
  He kept sucking. He sucked and she pumped until they were in a rhythm. He was
  taking every inch down his throat in every thrust. Every time she would let
  him up for air, she would ask him, �Do you want some more?� He nodded affirmatively
  but he eagerness was evidenced in the fact that he wouldn't stop sucking and
  licking that sexy black strapon. 
�You're ready to get your pussy fucked, aren't you?� He nodded uncontrollable,
  only stopping for a few seconds before he continued to lick and suck and swallow
  her strapon. �Derrick, get him ready for me, will you please?� 
Brian froze for a second. He was past the point of pretense or care and all
  he wanted was to be used. He arched his back as he felt lubricant being poured
  on his hole. Derrick's fingers were longer, thicker, and penetrated him more
  completely than Desire's fingers had previously done. He moaned in appreciation
  of the stimulation and sucked that much more. She kept taunting him with her
  words,� you want to get fucked by a big black cock, to be a white faggot whore
  to be used by the Superior Black race, don't you? 
He didn't have time to answer. His mouth was crammed full of the strapon and
  he was sucking it like a whore. At that instant, he felt the head of Derrick's
  dick at the entrance to his pussy. He reached his hand back to feel its size
  and to guide it in but he wasn't prepared for what he encountered. It was as
  thick as a beer can and twice as long. 
�Noooo,� he cried out, �I can't take that, please no.� The words coming out
  of his mouth rang of fear but his heart told a different tale. He craved the
  pain of being used by Black people to rid him of his horrible guilt, to make
  him feel as inferior had he knew himself to be. He wanted to be fucked like
  a white rag doll and he wanted to earn his punishment. The head burned as it
  penetrated him and he turned back to suck the strapon to distract himself.
  Desire had unhooked the dildo and spread her legs wide and presented him with
  her wet slit. 
Brian was experiencing sensory overload. A Black man was about to fuck him
  with the biggest black cock he had ever seen and before him was a sexy Black
  woman shoving her pussy in his face. He cried out, �Fuck me. Fuck my mouth,
  Fuck my pussy. Use me. Fuck me!!!� Tears formed in his eyes. He was lowered
  to a mass of flesh and lust at the hands of these Ebony gods. 
The cock in his ass pushed its way past his sphincter and deep into his bowels.
  It hurt. It was the kind of pain ushered in by the grandest pleasure. The sweet,
  sexy pussy in his face tasted like heaven. He felt what he previously thought
  was impossible . . . Derrick's balls were firmly against his own. He was impaled
  on that massive meat. 
He licked the clit in his face furiously as he wanted his Mistress to come
  in his mouth. �More . . . more . . . more,� he kept chanting. 
Derrick began slapping his ass and calling him names and it sent Brian into
  a lust-driven high. The pounding was harder now, he was being fucked without
  mercy. His guts ached, his prostate had never had that sort of stimulation
  and he was eating the wet musky cunt of his sexy Nubian Mistress. His tears
  were uncontrollable. His balls were aching. He started stroking his own cock
  uncontrollably as he unsnapped the cock ring and let out a cry. His cum exploded
  from his prick as Desire held his head to her spasming pussy and Derrick unloaded
  blast after thick blast of thick, hot cum in his well used pussy. He passed
  out from the pleasure and the pain. 
It was early morning when they dropped him off at the parking lot of the gay
  bar where they met. They had used him in so many delicious and unspeakable
  ways he couldn't remember them all. They were kinder to him then when they
  first met, treating him like a pet now more than a plaything. He was desperate
  for some sign that he had pleased them. �Will I see you again? Would you like
  to use me some more?� The longing in his eyes a telltale sign of the delight
  he had taken in being fucked so completely. 
�Know that tonight was child's play compared to what you will experience again,� Desire
  said. They drove off into the early morning, masters of dominant pleasure.

It had been two weeks since Brian's adventure and he hadn't been able to keep
  his mind off the events of that memorable night. During meetings at work, he
  would drift off in fantasy to the words that Desire last said. �Know that tonight
  was child's play compared to what you will experience again� He had flashbacks.
  Was it possible that he did the unspeakable things his mind's eye recalled?
  Eating black pussy, sucking big, black cocks . . . real and unreal, begging
  to get fucked and craving humiliation and abuse. At times, he could pretend
  that it was all a dream, that it hadn't really happened at all, but the desperation
  he felt to experience it again, the emptiness he felt inside, the longing to
  submit to his divine Black queen and do whatever she demanded haunted his every
  thought and desire. In his mind, it played out like a movie. He could see himself
  in the action. He could see the way he swallowed Mistress Desire's Strapon
  like a slut. He could see Master Derrick's huge cock as it invaded the deepest
  part of his bowels and gave him indescribable and forbidden pleasure. He could
  see his transformation from mild mannered, unassuming white man to submissive
  white bitchboi slut, with an insatiable need to be used and humiliated by Blacks.
  His mediocre life almost had reason while he patiently waited for the next
  email or instant message from Mistress Desire to let him know where his next
  adventure into dark passion would take him. 
One side effect the experience had on him was a boost to his libido. His previously
  boring and dull sex life with his wife had been resurrected. His love making
  become nothing less than inspired and she was never more satisfied in their
  entire eight-year marriage. His mind would fill of images from that night.
  His erection would become like steel and he would practically fight to keep
  from blurting out that he was submissive to Blacks to the blonde mother-of-two
  that lay beneath him. He was inspired by the intense desire to shock his card
  carrying, Junior League, PTA white bread wife with the revelation that he had
  eaten the hairy, black cunt of a sexy, Ebony mistress and he loved every second
  of it. He would pound away at his wife, making her moan for the first time
  in years, thinking of the look of horror she would have on her face knowing
  that he had begged like a dirty whore to get fucked savagely by a black stud.
  He would imagine that Desire would be whispering in his ear that his cock was
  pathetic and could never satisfy a woman the way Derrick's massive ebony weapon
  had satisfied his slutty pussy as he humped up and down on the unsuspecting
  woman white women that had ceased arousing him years ago. Fantasizing about
  hearing Desire's melodic voice in his mind, feeling her sensuous touch, and
  inspired by the beauty of her smooth chocolate skin, Brian could resign himself
  to the life he was sentenced to live and make due with the cards he had been
  dealt. 
Those fantasies came to a crashing halt the second he walked through the door
  one day after work. The envelope sat plainly on the kitchen table when he arrived
  home. It was so ornate, so elaborate, it was difficult to miss. He initially
  assumed it was for his wife but was compelled to inspect it. The hand calligraphy
  clearly spelled out his name and the expensive bronze envelope with sealing
  wax looked like it could have been an exclusive invitation to Prince William's
  coronation or something. Brian held the envelope in his hand and panicked.
  He knew the origin of the envelope even without a return address. It wasn't
  postmarked so he had to assume it had been hand delivered. His wife surely
  put it there so there was no way he could conceal it from her. Perspiration
  formed under his arms and he began to hyperventilate. He could hear his wife
  moving about upstairs and he knew from routine that she would be done momentarily
  to greet him. 
�Honey, I'll be back, I forgot my briefcase at the gym . . . I'll be . . .
  be right back,� he yelled up the staircase as he clutched the envelope tightly. 
�Wait, tell me what's in the envelope before you . . . leave,� the last word
  barely audible over the slam of the carport door. He sat in his car motionless
  for a second. Maybe he would just drive away and never come back. No, he needed
  to get revenge on that bitch for trying to destroy his life. She would pay
  for this and pay dearly. He backed out of the driveway not sure if he would
  even have the nerve to return home. He had nothing but the clothes on his back. 
Why had he been so thoughtless, so stupid? He jeopardized his marriage for
  a night of lust. At the time, it seemed so imperative to him to fulfill his
  fantasy. The thoughts of his submission to Black women had been growing for
  years. Everything about Black women seemed to reek of sensuality. He had long
  since stopped looking at porn sites with white women. Actually, his fascination
  began when he stroked his cock looking at videos of white women getting fucked
  by huge black cocks, usually in the ass, at the numerous black on blonde sites.
  At first, he just wanted to see if the myth was true. Assured that it was,
  he became mesmerized with black sexuality. Somehow, some way, he would get
  confused. Sometimes, he would imagine that the white whore on the screen was
  his wife. Scared by that thought, he somehow began to imagine himself as the
  white slut. He would see those white women on the screen, screaming and moaning
  and begging for more black cock as they were being gangbanged and he would
  wonder what it felt like to be the object of such intense sexual pleasure.
  His mind couldn't handle the confusion he experienced so he went searching
  the World Wide Web for images of Black women. He found true love. 
Black women were his obsession. Their skin, their asses, their pure, unbridled
  passion seemed to be the epitome of sexuality. At first, any Ebony site would
  do but he quickly learned that most adult sites with Black women were low quality
  and showed Black women in the worse possible way. He was only interested in
  sites that portrayed Black women as the goddesses he knew them to be. AfroerotiK
  was his absolute favorite; he could look on with awe and inspiration at the
  gorgeous images of Black sexuality. He then began using various chat rooms
  and online communities to find Black women with whom he could converse. He
  was interested in Black women that were at least of his educational level and
  not just trying to get paid for fucking. He was willing to pay, he felt it
  was his obligation to lavish a Black woman with gifts but wanted to do it as
  a tribute, not as an exchange of goods and services. Bottom line, he didn't
  want a hooker, he wanted a mistress. 
That's how he found Mistress Desire. She was a member of a yahoo group called
  love_ebony_women. He sent her an instant message and she returned his message
  with pleasant conversation. Not only was she his intellectual equal, she was
  his superior. She was a biologist specializing in stem cell research and most
  of her job description went over his head. For weeks they had developed a rapport
  and she had initiated him into a world of dominance and submission from which
  he could not return. She was masterful in her control of him and he found himself
  doing things he hadn't ever contemplated before. She never raised her voice;
  she never made outrageous and unreasonable demands on him. She would get inside
  his head, anticipate his every thought and desire, and push him to maniacal
  heights of arousal. He craved her humiliation most of all. He would get a perverse
  thrill knowing that she looked down on him with disgust and contempt. 
His cell phone rang and it jolted him out of his memories. The caller ID said
  it was his wife and he let the call go to voicemail. He glanced at the envelope
  sitting on the front seat. It looked like it had an aura of its own. �What
  the hell am I so afraid of? What if it's not even from her? This is crazy.
  I'm not afraid of her. I'm not going to let her control my life. Whatever is
  in there I can handle it,� he thought. 
He drove out of conditioning to his job. It was still relatively early in
  the evening so a few people were still lingering about, finishing up projects
  and waiting for the evening traffic to dissipate before they made their journey
  to the outer burbs. He moved through the office in a fog, the envelope held
  firmly in his grasp. He closed the door to his office and loosened his tie.
  He felt lightheaded. He broke the seal of the envelope and the gilt tissue
  paper floated gracefully to the floor. He unfolded the envelope to find a hand
  written note. 
�Brian, I do so hope you have a wonderful evening when we met. I warned you
  that if you wanted to play again, the stakes would be higher. What say you,
  Brian? Interested in seeing how far you will be willing to go to get your pathetic
  little prick off again Brian?� 
Brian blinked hard. With all that was at stake, with all that he stood to
  lose, he found himself getting erect. He could hear the sweet timber of her
  voice and he knew all to well that she knew how to push his buttons. 
He continued to read. �You belong to me completely, Brian, that means that
  anything that you have belongs to me as well. I want your wife Brian. I want
  to see your wife getting fucked like a slut by Derrick's beautiful black cock.
  I want to see the look on her face as you kiss my feet, lick my pussy, as you
  drink my piss and tell me that you love me and you'll do anything to please
  me. I want her to watch in horror as she sees her dutiful husband slobber and
  drool over Derrick's black cock and beg to get fucked like a useless faggot.
  Chez Henri -- Friday night -- Be there at 8:00, bring your wife, and we'll
  be waiting for you.� 
Brian's mouth was dry. More than that, his cock was hard. He went to lock
  the door of his office and he fell wearily against the frame as he freed his
  raging hard cock and stroked it, thinking of the things Desire had described.
  He pushed his pants to his knees and spread his thighs as much as his khakis
  would allow. He placed his finger in his mouth and sucked it, imagining a more
  delectable treat. Sufficiently lubricated, he reached past his balls to his
  asshole and pushed it in. Ever since Derrick had fucked him in the ass, his
  asshole had become desperate to be fucked. Sometimes, it itched and throbbed
  in need of a big, black invader. He shot a load all over the carpet as he fantasized
  about his wife being a slut for black cock, and how Mistress Desire had manipulated
  him so completely. 
Invigorated, Brian regained his composure and he began concocting lies and
  explanations to tell his wife. He checked his voicemail to get a measure of
  his wife's demeanor. All seemed well. She was curious but she didn't seem to
  suspect anything at all. He felt a tinge of guilt for the betrayal he was displaying
  but his lust and fantasies, and the fear that if he didn't comply with Desire's
  wishes she might actually do something malicious to him, his marriage or his
  job kept him focused. 
He ran to his computer and used Publisher to create an elaborate looking document
  that looked like a gift certificate, complete with a fake authorization code
  and a line for a fake signature. He called Chez Henri for reservations on Friday
  night and they were booked solid. He asked the maitre d if there were reservations
  for a Desiree' Jenkins and he confirmed that she had reservations for two at
  8:00. He called the corporate concierge for his firm and promised him a hundred
  bucks if he could get him reservations at the exclusive, five star restaurant
  on Friday evening. He got a confirmation after only a minute of being on hold.
  He held his breath as he dialed the number for his wife. 
�You won't believe this,� he blurted out before giving her a chance to ask
  any questions,� I entered this drawing at work about a month ago and I won
  . . . we won a dinner for two at Chez Henri on Friday night. Isn't that fabulous?� 
She started to ask all sorts of questions about the strange demeanor of the
  man who had delivered the envelope and why he had run out so quickly be he
  easily distracted her by telling her that she should go to Nordstrom's and
  buy something extra sexy and that he even thought that she should take the
  day off an make an appointment for Spa Moulin on Friday afternoon as well. �Make
  a day of it baby, I want this to be a special night for both of us. We deserve
  to let our hair down.� 
When he hung up, reality hit him squarely in the chest. What on earth was
  he thinking? How could he subject himself to such a dangerous plan? As much
  as he fantasized about having a wife that was a slut for Black cock and submitting
  himself to the machinations of an Ebony Domme, this was too much. He formed
  a plan that would simply beat Desire at her own game. He was going to show
  her that he was no pawn to be played with. 
He avoided Rebecca the majority of the day on Friday, opting to get his hair
  cut, go work out at the gym and go buy some Clinique toiletries so that he
  would feel his most attractive for his . . . masters, no longer able to say
  mistress solely. His passion was rising and his slutty nature was coming out.
  He wanted Desire and Derrick to take him places that he had never even dreamt
  of going. The fact that his wife might be there to watch didn't register in
  his consciousness. For so many years she wasn't even a part of his sexual fantasies
  that he was able to disassociate her from his desires. Yeah, he would fantasize
  occasionally about a white slut wife that would keep him cuckold and submissive
  to Blacks, but he never thought that it would be the conservative, practically
  frigid woman that he had only recently begun to enjoy sex with, no thanks to
  her. In his fantasies it was some other white woman, not the mother of his
  children. 
Rebecca was like a school girl on Friday, giggling and talkative all day long.
  She was invigorated by the concept of romance in their otherwise loveless marriage.
  She got a Brazilian wax at the spa, removing every trace of hair on her pussy
  and leaving her baby smooth. She had decided to go for a sultrier look than
  usual, empowered by the intense sex she and Brian had been having as of late.
  She made an appointment at the hairdresser, had highlights put in her hair
  and got the full makeover at the cosmetic counter at Mac. Brian, already aroused
  at what he knew was potentially going to happen, practically threw her on the
  bed when he saw the low-cut, clingy red dress that Rebecca wore, the strappy
  high heels and the knockout woman that stood before him. 
�Your table is ready sir,� the host said as they made their way through the
  labyrinth of tables with Waterford crystal sparkling in the candlelight. Brian
  nervously glanced around, practically sick he had allowed his fantasies to
  control his better judgment yet again. The waiter introduced himself and described
  specials but he was completely distracted. He saw Desire from across the room,
  watching their every move, and something deep within him told him that he shouldn't
  make the first move. She was torturing him and she loved every second of it.
  At times, she would laugh and draw attention to herself, highlighting the fact
  that she and Derrick were the only people of color in the entire place. It
  was an act of confidence rather than uncouth, proving that she was undaunted
  by the historical implications that suggested that she didn't even belong there,
  let alone command such confidence and ease. 
Dinner was seamless, save the raging hard-on Brian sported all night, and
  the sorbet course was about to be served. He thought that perhaps that this
  was to be his only test, to see if he could follow orders. His true desires
  betrayed him as he felt slightly disappointed that the evening would transpire
  without the things the Desire had described in her note. The waiter approached
  and discreetly said, �Ms Jenkins would like it very much if you and your wife
  would join her and her companion for an aperitif.� 
Her back towards the couple all evening, Rebecca turned in her seat to glance
  towards Desire and Derrick. �Brian, who is she? Do you know her?� She seemed
  to immediately get uncomfortable. 
Brian swallowed hard. �Hmmmmmmm, Oh, yes. I think I do. She is the head of
  the lab at that research facility where my company updated their network interface
  a few months back . . . I think,� trying to sound unsure of himself and proud
  that he was capable of thinking on his feet so well. 
�I'm not so sure about that, Brian. Maybe we should decline the offer.� Rebecca
  seemed nervous and figidity. 
�Nonsense, what could it hurt,� Brian said, as he wondered inwardly why he
  hadn't taken the opportunity to take his wife up on her offer? Adrenaline was
  pumping in his veins. 
Desire stood to greet him with an air of familiarity. She leaned in close
  and tilted her head back for Brian to kiss her neck. Brian laid a tentative
  and juvenile kiss on her neck and Rebecca turned a deeper shade of red as she
  witnessed the act of intimacy right before her eyes. 
Derrick stood to greet her. �Rebecca, you look particularly lovely this evening.� He
  kissed her on the mouth and ran his dark hands down her back and rested them
  on her ass. This time, it was Brian's turn to show his displeasure. It was
  a kiss of lovers. 
Desire interrupted the embrace and introduced herself. �We've not met, I'm
  Desiree' Jenkins. You must be Rebecca. Derrick has told me so much about you.
  It's a pleasure to finally meet the woman behind all those steamy stories.� With
  that, she leaned in close and gave Rebecca a sensuous kiss that was more appropriate
  for a porn movie than a high-class establishment like Chez Henri. 
�What the fuck is . . .,� Brian blurted out, drawing more attention that the
  silent kiss had done. 
�Brian, sit! And for God's sake don't make such a scene.� Desires' words caused
  more arousal than calm; the irony of her comments was not lost on the interracial
  foursome. He was hypnotized by her command and presence. 
They all sat as Rebecca and Brian were shame faced and solemn. Desire broke
  the ice. �Shall we drop the pretenses everyone? Brian, while you've been my
  cyber slut online for all these weeks, your wife has been entertaining a virtual
  lover as well.� 
Rebecca looked nauseous as Desire continued with her tale. �You see, Becky
  here doesn't know the identity of her cyber lover, she's only seen him from
  the waist down on web cam. But she does know Derrick here. They met when he
  was kind enough to hand deliver the note I sent you earlier this week. Derrick
  and your cyber lover are one and the same, Becky. I'm afraid we played a bit
  of a trick on you sweetie by not revealing Derrick's identity to you when you
  met the other day but you didn't seem to care. You were so hot for Black cock
  that you were practically throwing yourself at him.� Desire continued with
  her story causing Brian rage and outrage at the betrayal from both women. �I
  guess her lust for black men had been fueled by her cyber lover so much that
  when Derrick showed up at the door, she invited him in, offered him some Iced
  Red tea and was practically drooling all over him. The kids were in the back
  yard playing the whole time if I heard the story correctly. Bent right over
  the kitchen sink and took all 10 inches without missing a beat.� 
Brian's heart sank. He knew the story was true. His wife had been on this
  whole �antioxidant kick� recently and was addicted to a new kind of South African
  red rooibos tea. Rebecca grabbed her purse and Brian's arm and stood to leave. 
�Sit down bitch!� Desire's words sounded so sweet and sexy they effectively
  controlled the blonde housewife with ease. Brian's face was burning with anger.
  Damn his cock for being hard at a time like this. He grabbed Rebecca's arm
  forcefully enough to leave marks. �Is what she's saying true?� 
Rebecca pried his fingers from her arm. With tears in her eyes, she choked
  out, �I guess it is, apparently you know her very well. I wasn't the only one
  cheating online.� 
Desire interrupted. �Oh no, Brian's infidelities were far more extensive than
  mere cybersex.� She turned to Brian. �Would you like to divulge the juicy details
  of our threesome or would you prefer me to do that? Better yet, let's go to
  the video tape, shall we?� 
�You didn't tell me anything about a videotape,� Brian was outraged. He had
  been caught so off guard that he had completely forgotten his counterplans
  for revenge on this Black manipulatrix. He never saw the shocker coming that
  his wife would somehow be involved in her scheme. The white couple sat there
  in a state of shock, not believing that their marriage was falling apart in
  the most expensive restaurant in town. 
�What video tape, Brian?� Rebecca whispered the words softly, the wind taken
  out of her sails. 
Brian sunk into a feeling of calm. He had no control so he just relinquished
  all of his anger into determination to not let this woman defeat him. Casually,
  at just above a whisper, he recounted to his wife the short version of what
  had happened. &quot; . . . . wanted to know if it was true . . . once you go
  black . . . AfroerotiK . . . shaved. . . dance . . . and for the first time
  in my life Rebecca, I felt alive.&quot; He finished his monologue as he fought
  back the tears. He was now truly free. 
�Becky, your hubby left out a few key details,� the familiar way she called
  her name dripping with condescension. Not waiting for Brian to fill in the
  details, she said, �Do you remember how good you felt when Derrick's hard,
  black cock was ramming your tight white pussy? Well, you and Brian have that
  in common. He's all too familiar with that sensation as well. And if memory
  serves me correctly, he was begging and screaming for more. Isn't that right,
  Derrick?� 
Derrick spoke up for the first time since the foursome sat at the table. He
  was more than just a lackey; he was an equally competent and capable dominator.
  The effects of his work outs showed beneath the tailored suit that draped his
  body like it was custom made for him, and obviously it was. Derrick was professing
  how tight, slutty, and horny fucking Brian was and comparing notes to determine
  which partner had been the better lay. Brian couldn't hear any of his comments,
  he felt like he was about to pass out. 
Derrick signaled for the check and the waiter promptly brought it to the table. �Would
  the gentleman like for our limousine to take you to your usual suite at The
  Ritz this evening?� Derrick threw six crisp $100 bills on the table and said, �That
  would be fine, and make sure that our guests here have their bill covered as
  well. That should take care of everything, correct?� 
�Yes sir,� the waiter said. Brian was not sure if he could detect a hint of
  submissive gleam in the waiter's eyes when he bowed graciously and left to
  signal for the driver. 
�Come Becky, let's powder our noses while the boys catch up.� Desire stood
  and extended her hand to Rebecca. Brian had to stand to let her out of the
  booth and they two ladies trotted off arm in arm, Rebecca looking back like
  an abducted child stolen from her father's loving embrace. 
Brian stared at the cleared table, unable to look Derrick in the eye. Five
  minutes passed and he grew more and more uncomfortable with each passing second.
  He could tell Derrick was staring at him the entire time. �She's eating Desiree's
  pussy right now, you realize that don't you?� 
Brian looked up in shock, his eyes wide with wonder. �There's no way, Rebecca
  isn't . . . she wouldn't. . . � His voice trailed off, reminded of the things
  he's been convinced to do and enjoy and Desires command. 
Just then, the two ladies returned to the table. Rebecca moved with a casual
  elegance about her, a certain lightness. She certainly wasn't the same woman
  that left the table minutes ago. She walked up to Brian and slid in next to
  him. She leaned over and kissed Brian full on the mouth. There was no denying
  the taste of pussy on her mouth. He had tasted that sweet nectar before and
  remembered it all too well. She tasted different, slightly saltier somehow
  but Brian was intoxicated by the taste. He was lost in his own lustful desires
  to taste that pussy when he reached for Rebecca's waist and felt her dress
  was damp. 
He backed away and looked Rebecca in the eye. She didn't look away. He glanced
  at Desire with a confused look on his face. It wasn't possible. There was no
  fucking way in hell that it was possible. That taste . . . the damp dress.
  Desire laughed, �I've had so much champagne this evening, sometimes I get a
  little confused. The toilet is white; Becky's mouth is white . . .� 
�Rebecca?� 
�Rebecca didn't bother to answer. She took Brian's hand and discreetly shoved
  it between her pantiless thighs. She was soaking wet. Brian looked at his wife
  and she was no longer the conservative woman that made meatloaf every Thursday
  and sold raffle tickets for the PTA. She was a hot, desirable, lustful woman
  that looked incredible. �I'm horny, hornier than I've ever been in my life.
  I want to do this Brian. Let's take a chance. If we let go of this opportunity,
  we may never get it again.� She hesitated a moment and added,�Brian, we are
  both sluts for black cock and for black pussy, why are we trying to deny it?� 
With that simple declaration, everything in Brian's world changed. There was
  no turning back. His wife of eight years had spoken the words that would alter
  their realties forever. They were sluts for black cock and black pussy. Brian
  closed his eyes and opened them to a new reality. He wanted to be baptized
  with the golden nectar of Mistress Desire; he wanted to be used by Derrick
  any way he saw fit. He wanted to eat Rebecca's pussy when her belly was swollen
  and full with Derrick's baby. It was as if in an instant he was a new person. 
�Your car is ready,� the waiter announced as he held Desire's chair out. Desire
  held her arm out for Brian to take and he did so willingly. Derrick slid around
  and took Rebecca's arm and the foursome walked out arm in arm much differently
  than they had entered. 
The limo was waiting for them at the curb. The driver held the door while
  they piled in. There was a full bar and TV and all the trappings of a limo
  but there was a case of openly displayed sex toys there as well. Brian tried
  not to stare and act nonchalant about it. Rebecca was seated in between Desire
  and Derrick and Brian sat across from them. The car sat motionless as Desire
  said, �Brian pull down your pants and bend over, I want to get put a butt plug
  in you to get you ready for tonight. 
Brian froze for a second. It was the exact same feeling he had in the bar.
  He was angry and defiant but intoxicated with the power this Black women held
  over him. She owned him and he did what she requested with pride, wanting to
  show his wife that he had no shame in being such a slut. He slid his pants
  down to his knees and followed instructions by kneeling on the floor of the
  limo. 
�Becky, I want you to put it in, which one of these lovelies would you like
  to see in him . . . that one? Why not that one? Yes, I think he would like
  that one much better.� Brian arched his back. He wanted to take the biggest
  one there was with ease, to show that he could handle anything they dished
  out. 
His wife inquired about lube and Derrick said, �Damn, we forgot the lube,
  you'll have to lick his asshole to get it wet or stick it in dry.� Brian froze.
  He feared that his wife would take out her anger at his infidelities on his
  unlubed asshole. His fears didn't last long as he felt the soft touch of his
  wife's tongue on his rear hole. In their entire time together, she had never
  done anything like that. It felt damn good. She was licking his ass and moaning.
  Brian glanced around to see that Desire was fingering Rebecca's pussy at the
  same time. The pleasure he felt was quickly changed when he felt the tip of
  a gigantic butt plug about to penetrate him. He pushed out, like he was taking
  a shit, to accommodate the mammoth toy. It felt heavenly, finally filled where
  he had felt so empty since Derrick has last been there. 
�Pull up your pants,� Derrick said. He tapped on the window and the driver
  opened the door. Everyone looked at Brian and he knew he was expected to get
  out. He froze. The driver extended his hand and Brian emerged out into the
  night and turned back to see his wife and her two black lovers fondling her
  openly. The driver closed the door and opened the passenger side door for Brian.
  He felt relieved momentarily, until he sat and felt the butt plug in his ass
  and moaned in discomfort. The driver, a white man that looked to be in his
  late forties, put the partition up between the front and back seat and pulled
  his cock out. It was already erect and Brian stared at him, wondering how many
  times he had done this sort of ritual with Derrick and Desire. The driver seemed
  happy to just stroke his cock occasionally, keeping it erect as he drove about
  the city. 
The heavily tinted windows shielded them from the rest of the world. Brian
  was mesmerized by the events of the night. Within the last hour and a half,
  he had found out that his wife had been having a secret cyber affair with a
  Black man, that that same black man had fucked her in their very house, he
  revealed to his wife that he had become submissive to a Black dominatrix and
  enjoyed taking her lover's black cock in his ass. He had tasted the evidence
  of his wife drinking Desire's piss and he now had a huge butt plug in his ass
  sitting next to a man that was jerking off casually while his wife was in the
  back seat between two Dominant Black people. Brian rested his head on the partition
  and pulled his own cock out for some stimulation. 
He was enjoying the night scenery, the pressure in his ass and the public
  jerk off he and the driver were sharing when he heard moans coming from the
  back seat. They were the unmistakable moans of his wife, in the throws of ecstasy.
  He listened intently. She was screaming now, loudly, without censor. His wife
  was a slut, begging to get fucked. 
Desire turned on the intercom so he didn't have to strain to hear. Every sound
  was as clear as a bell. �Yes Becky, suck that big, Black cock. It's so much
  better than your hubby's pathetic little one, isn't it?� Rebecca moaned her
  affirmation with a mouth full of meat. �You love that THICK, LONG, BLACK DICK
  fucking your slutty mouth, don't you?� Her punctuation of every word like a
  knife in Brian's gut. There was more moaning and slobbering. Brian was embarrassed
  but more aroused than ever. He wanted to hear his wife say that his cock couldn't
  satisfy her. He wanted her to say that only a big, Black cock could please
  her. He stroked harder and harder waiting to hear more. 
He heard Derrick say, �Look you white bitch, if you are going to suck it,
  suck my fucking cock you whore,� and he heard the sounds of his wife choking.
  He knew Derrick had his strong black fingers grasping the blonde hair of his
  wife and was forcing her down on his stiff erection. He heard the sounds of
  Mistress Desire slapping her ass and finally Rebecca gasping for air. 
�More, give me more of that superior Black cock,� she was screaming and coughing
  like a wounded animal. Every time he heard the staccato sound of her ass being
  slapped, her voice went down an octave like she was being transformed into
  a wild beast. 
�Come here you cunt, eat my pussy and you better make me cum.� Brian had tears
  in his eyes; he was grinding in the seat and humping that butt plug deeper
  and deeper in his ass. He ached to see the action. �Yeah you white cunt, eat
  my sweet, hairy black cunt, show Mommy what a good little girl you are.� The
  words rang in Brian's ears. He visualized his pristine wife of eight years
  lapping at the silky folds of flesh between the thighs of a Dominant Black
  woman. He heard her dress rip and he gasped for air. What was happening back
  there? 
�Oh yes, fuck me Daddy. Mommy, make me eat your sweet, juicy pussy. Mommy,
  I've been such a bad girl, Tell Daddy to spank me hard while he rams that gorgeous
  fuck stick in and out of my slutty pussy. I'm a bad girl, aren't I Mommy. Only
  Bad girls like to get fucked like whores by big black cocks and like to eat
  pussy, don't they Mommy?� 
If he hadn't heard that voice every day for the past 10 years of his life,
  Brian would have sworn it was someone else saying those words. He spit on his
  hand and stroked his cock even harder. Not ashamed any more, he lowered his
  pants, removed them and placed his feet on the dashboard. He grabbed the base
  of the butt plug and tried to push it deeper in while he kept listening to
  the sounds of his wife getting fucked. 
�Want some more piss, slut? Want some more of Mommy's sweet pee?� All he heard
  were moans. It was barely a second before he heard the unmistakable sounds
  of hot urine filling a mouth and swallowing, followed by coughing and sputtering. �You
  bitch, how dare you spill a drop of my precious golden wine.� 
�I'm sorry Mommy, but, agraahhhhhhhhhh, Daddy was ramming my white useless
  twat so hard I couldn't help myself. Let me make it up for you by licking your
  sexy asshole Mistress. Please, I would love to stick my tongue up your gorgeous
  shithole. That's what nasty little white sluts like me do, right Mommy?� 
The cum in Brian's nuts was about to shoot out of his cock. He was stroking
  so hard, so fast, moaning louder than his wife. If he could just see what was
  happening. He heard Desire moaning in sensual delight and the sounds of licking
  and the unmistakable sounds of hardcore fucking. 
Brian heard the sounds of Desire on the verge of orgasm. He had heard those
  melodic sounds before and they were music to his ears. Derrick was lost in
  his own pleasure as well, yelling out, �Take my cock, bitch, and take every
  fucking inch. If you're lucky, I'll cum in your used hole and let lover boy
  up there lick it out. 
There was no turning back. Brian was out of control. His heart was aching.
  He needed to see the action. The words poured through the intercom, a m&eacute;lange
  of voices and cries,� Fuck me, eat my pussy, take this black cock bitch, it
  hurts, that feels good, more, don't stop, fucking slut, use me . . .� it was
  a cacophony of erotic words made into a soundtrack of lust and pure, hedonistic
  desire. 
Brian was sure that all four of them came at the same time. Brian captured
  his cum in his hand and licked it like a greedy slut, careful not to make a
  mess for the driver to have to clean up. The driver, erect and still stroking
  himself, concentrated on the road, surely hired for his services for his discretion
  and his safety. 
The car pulled into the driveway of the Ritz. After a moment to pull himself
  together, the driver opened the passenger side door and Brian stepped out into
  the night. He opened the door to the back and Derrick and Desire emerged impeccably.
  Rebecca had the obvious signs of being fucked. Her hair was matted and sweaty,
  her dress slightly torn, her lipstick smears across and her face was glistening
  with the telltale signs of cum. At that moment, Brian was sure he had never
  seen his wife look more beautiful. The doorman held the door for them. 
�I'm pleased you'll be staying with us this weekend. If there is anything
  you'll require, be sure to let me know.� 
Derrick tipped him what looked to be a one hundred dollar bill and slapped
  him on the back. �We're expecting six of our friends to show up in a couple
  of hours. Be sure to show them directly to our room.�
