NIKITA 

Story by Tom Maseau 

nikita was lying in her Teacher�s bed. She had been in this bed before, but never without Him. It 
was the first time she was spending the night alone in His house, and in His bed. 

He had offered her to stay in His house during His yearly stay abroad. Last year, when she was still 
a student in one of His classes, she had told Him that she had been staying for a few weeks in the 
Puntegale, an appartment building more or less next to the school building. Friends of her�s had 
offered her to stay there as they were out of the country for a holiday. she had told Him how much 
she enjoyed being on her own, away from her parents, and not having to spend three hours of 
travelling every day going to school in the morning and back in the evening. This gave her Teacher 
the idea of asking her to stay in His house, which was also in the neighbourhood of the school, 
during His absence. 

He had told her that it wasn�t entirely up to Him to decide whether she could stay in the house or 
not, but they would deal with that problem in a later stage, He said. �Let�s first see if you like the 
place, and if you are comfortable staying there�, He had told her. 

nikita was lying in His bed now, and she liked being here more and more by the hour. she had 
enjoyed cooking her dinner earlier, and she had also enjoyed eating it lying in the bed, having a tray 
on her lap; just like those few times she had had dinner here with her Teacher. Now she had just 
started watching a film on the big television screen in front of the bed. she had difficulty 
concentrating though. she was looking around at the books that were on the shelf to the left of her, 
but they were too far for her to read the titles. Under the bookshelf was the cupboard with the closed 
door. He had told her that she could go anywhere and do and use everything in His house, except 
for this cupboard, since it contained some of His private belongings. 

she smiled as she was thinking of this, because she knew very well what those private belongings in 
the cupboard were. He had used some of them on her very body on the occasions they had been 
together in the bed before. she turned over towards the cupboard and opened the door. The sight of 
the things inside brought pleasant memories to her, although some of the items she recognised had 
actually hurt her as He was playing His sexual games with her. She took the little whip that He had 
used to make her obey Him. she recalled the marks on her body that stayed there for days. she bent 
it as if to test its flexibility. she slapped her own hand with it, and noticed that it was exciting to her. 
she put it back, because she didn�t want to distract herself from her little exploring activity in her 
Teacher�s cupboard. 

her eye fell on a pack of printed paper, on top of some books in the cupboard. she took it because it 
looked like a manuscript or a script for a movie. 



she went through the first few pages, and couldn�t believe what she was reading. It was the story of 
how her Teacher had invited her to stay at His house. He was called �Maestro� in the story though, 
and the student�s name was �tina�. She read a more or less exact account of how things had 
happened. Her meeting her Teacher last year in the class room, the mutual attraction they had felt, 
and the meeting later in the street where she had blushed like a little girl and their months of 
exchanging emails afterwards. Then His idea of her staying in His house, her accepting etcetera. 
She was astounded to read about herself lying in His bed on her first evening alone in His house, 
and the description of how she was going through the books that were in the cupboard that He had 
told her not to open� 

At this point nikita put the manuscript aside. she needed some time to allow her brain to get used to, 
and actually believe what she had been reading. And even more; she needed to prepare mentally for 
the rest: the story she had seen so far was only the beginning of the manuscript. Next she would 
read the rest of the story� starting from THIS moment in time? she felt that maybe she should 
pinch her self to make sure she wasn�t dreaming. 

In order to gather her thoughts together and to get a grip on the situation she decided to go to the 
kitchen to get a glass of water, and then come back to the bed to read the rest of the story. 

she did just that. she went for the glass of water, came back to the bed and switched the television 
off. Never had she been so anxious to read anything in her life. 

The story she read was surprising and bizar to her. It told how the student girl �she?-found out 
through some research on the internet how her Teacher had a secret second life, in which He was a 
servant and sex slave to a woman called �DC�. DC liked to have sex with girls as well as with men, 
so She ordered Her servant to provide Her with a girl that she could use to fulfil Her desire: to be 
orally satisfied by a young and pretty girl. If the girl would perform well, DC would allow her to 
stay in her Teacher�s house during the months that he �Her servant-would be abroad. 

After nikita ended reading the story the blood in her brain was rushing around even faster than 
before. The story had been exciting her a lot, both sexually and otherwise. Was this a fantasy of her 
Teacher? In one way it had to be. On the other hand, the beginning of the story had been an exact 
description of reality so far. Was the rest of the story a description of things to come? she got 
confused of the matter and decided the best thing she could do now is to try not to distract herself 
from the matter. she put the television on and spent the rest of the evening watching movies. By the 
time she went to sleep the adrenaline in her body had gone back to it�s normal level. she had 
decided that her Teacher had a mind that was even kinkier than she already knew it was, and she 
enjoyed the idea that He had such a vivid imagination. she thought of Him and DC after she had 
turned the television off and was lying and fantasising in the dark about that absurd but sexy story. 

*** 

Next morning nikita woke up as she was still in the middle of a dream about her Teacher and DC. 
she decided to try and continue the story of her dream, but as her brain was getting clearer, she 
started to feel uncomfortable again because of the fact that she couldn�t be certain about the reality 
level of the story. she remembered that He had told her that the final decision about whether she 
was allowed to stay in His house wasn�t His�, or at least that he had to consult someone on the 
matter. Could this be the mysterious �DC�? According to the story it would have to be� How 
could she find out? Should she behave from now onwards in accordance with the story she had 



read, in order to find out, or do something else? Should she forget about the story all together, and 
see what would happen? Certainly the last option was the right option, since she wasn�t supposed to 
have read the story in the first place. On the other hand� the story, and reading the story had been 
very exiting to her. Would she like it if that story, or something similar, would actually come true 
and become a reality in her life? she had to admit that she wouldn�t mind having something similar 
happening to her actually. she decided that she would go for a positive approach, and the most 
positive approach would be to make it happen, however unlikely that would be. But how was she 
supposed to have the story become reality? Maybe she should have a closer look at the story in the 
manuscript, and see how the student girl in the story exactly got to do the things she did? she 
decided that that was what she was going to do. she would get up, have breakfast, get a shower and 
get dressed, and then study the manuscript for clues of what to do next. 

*** 

nikita was sitting at the table in her Teacher�s house, with the manuscript that she had found in the 
cupboard next to His bed in front of her. Asking her Teacher what to do wasn�t an option, she felt. 
The girl in the story had gotten into touch with �DC� on her own, and besides, telling her Teacher 
that the first thing she had done in His house was doing the one and only thing He had told her NOT 
to do, didn�t seem to be a smart movie anyway. 

she read in the manuscript that the student in the story had found out about her Teacher�s secret life 
and �DC� by doing research on the internet. she looked for more clues in the story that she might 
use in her search. she read that the girl in the story visited DC three times a week. On Tuesday 
morning she had to visit Her early in the morning. DC would still be in bed, and the girl had to get 
naked and join DC in Her bed, so that DC could play with her breast for a little while, until She had 
enough of that. Then She ordered the girl to go down: to move her head down under the blanket 
between Her legs, so she could work on Her with her tongue. After having satisfied DC in this way 
she would be immediately dismissed. she would have to get dressed, and leave the house, so DC 
could go back to sleep. 

A similar routine would take place at the end of the week. On Fridays she would have to present 
herself at DC�s house in the afternoon. DC would be dressed very sexy as She received the girl, 
wearing high heels and stockings and a tight skirt. She would be wearing lipstick and sometimes 
carry a little whip in Her hands, which She would never have to use since the girl was already 100% 
obedient to Her. DC would tell the girl to undress, and she would watch her taking her clothes of. 
As usual she would start Her interaction with the girl by feeling and softly squeezing her breasts. 
This would arouse Her so much that She would then be ready for the girl�s tongue to finish Her of 
in the usual way. She would lay down on the bed or sit on Her couch, lifting Her skirt to allow 
Herself to spread her legs, and have the girl sit on her knees in front of Her. The girl would put her 
face between the soft white thighs, and work with her tongue to give DC what She liked best in this 
world� 

On Wednesday DC would receive the girl at Her office. According to the story DC worked for a 
cosmetics company that had it�s main office in the centre of town. Wednesday would be the day 
that She was alone at the office, and ready to get Her favourite �fix� there. The girl would show up 
at the time that DC had established, and after the usual breast stroking routine she would make use 
of the girls tongue again. One time while She would be lying on the big table in the centre of the 
office, an other time she would be lying on the floor, or sitting on Her knees as the girl would be 
serving Her with her tongue from behind or underneath. And as always, as soon as the girl had 



taken Her to where She desired to be taken, the girl afterwards had to get dressed as soon as she 
could, and disappear. DC was a very friendly and sociable person generally, but in matters 
concerning her licking slave she was the opposite. She would simply have her do what she came 
for, and then bluntly DC would send her away again. 

nikita got excited as she was reading about DC on Wednesdays. All descriptions of the different 
days turned her on sexually, but what excited her about the Wednesday description was the 
mentioning of the clue she needed. she felt confident that the place where DC worked, the head 
office of the cosmetic company in the centre of town, was going to take here further in her search to 
find out about DC, and if the story she had been reading was fantasy or more than that. 
she got ready to go and find the yellow pages, and look for cosmetic companies, as she vaguely 
remembered that she had recently seen a business card of a person working for a cosmetics 
company. Where did she see that business card?! Suddenly she remembered. It had been on top of 
the cupboard next to the bed. The same cupboard she opened last night to find the manuscript in 
that had controlled her thoughts ever since, even during her sleep. she hurried to the cupboard and 
found the card where she had seen it before. 

The card read: �Patsy York, management assistant XXX-cosmetics�, followed by telephone and fax-
numbers, and email and normal address information. Could this Patsy be the mysterious �DC� from 
the story she read? Would this Woman have her Teacher as a sexual slave and servant, and would 
She be the person her Teacher was referring to when He said that He had to consult someone else in 
order to be able to give her the definitive green light to live in His house during the months of His 
absence? And would this Patsy or �DC� require �in return for Her consent-that she, nikita, like the 
girl in the story, visit Her three times a week to have sex with Her? nikita was dying to find out. But 
like the evening before all these thoughts were hardly credible to her, although putting all the pieces 
together seemed to lead to no other conclusion than the one she had just reached. She thought it 
would be wise to suppress her burning desire to take the phone and call the number on the card. She 
decided to wait for now, and get in contact which Patsy or �DC� as soon as she calmed down. 

Half an hour later nikita felt she was ready to call. she took the phone and dialed the number. her 
heart was pounding as she heard the phone ringing at the other end. Suddenly she heard a friendly 
female voice. �XXX-cosmetics group, this is Patsy�� 

nikita instantly liked the voice of the person she was talking to. it brought back the very strong 
erotic feelings she was experiencing last night as she was going through the story, the story she was 
living at this very moment. 
�Good morning�, she answered, suddenly aware of the fact that she wasn�t really ready at all for this 
conversation. �I�m looking for someone �. that works in Your office�� 

�Who are you looking for?, Patsy asked. 

�I�m not sure �� the girl said hesitantly. 

�Do you have a name?� 

�Yes �, well, no � I mean� I think Her name is �DC�� 

�DC?�, Patsy asked with genuine surprise, may I ask where you got this name from? 



�It�s a bit of a long story�, the girl said. 
�I bet it is. Can you tell me why you want to talk to DC?, Patsy asked the girl. 
�That too is actually a bit of a long story�, nikita answered, �and I�m not sure if this is the 


moment�, especially over the phone� 
�I understand�, Patsy said. �I�m sure that you are right that certain things are better discussed person 


to person, and not over the phone. I believe I know, at least more or less, what you want to talk 
about. Maybe we can make an appointment to meet? 
�I don�t know��, nikita answered in confusion. The fact that the bizar theory seemed to be true, and 

the fact that the connection she had made between the story and the business card turned out to be 
successful was overwhelming to her. 

�Where are you?, Patsy asked the girl. 
Suddenly a gulf of awareness and assertiveness pushed nikita�s confusion aside, and she answered: 
�I am at my Teacher�s house. He told me that I can stay in His house if DC approves of me�. 


�I see�, Patsy said. �And now you want to meet DC to see if She can approve�.� 


�I know She will approve, Madam�, nikita said. �I know what it takes to get Her approval, and I am 
confident She will not be disappointed�. 
�Ha, ha! That sounds very good�, Patsy said. �I will set up an appointment for you with DC. Do you 


have any preference about a date?� 


�I am looking forward to see her both on Tuesday mornings, Wednesdays and Friday afternoons, 
Madam. Since tomorrow will be Wednesday, maybe I can see Her in Her office tomorrow?� 
�Very well�, Patsy said. �I will make sure that DC will be ready for you tomorrow afternoon. What 


is your name?� 
�My name is nikita, Madam� 
�And you are quite sure what you are coming here for tomorrow, nikita?� 
�Yes madam, I know that my Teacher is gone for a few months, and so is DC�s servant. I think that 


DC and I will be able to help each other during H/his absence, Madam�. 
�That sounds very good, nikita, I�m sure DC is very much looking forward to meet you tomorrow�. 


�Thank you, Madam, see You tomorrow then�. 


nikita put down the phone and got aware of the weird intensifying itch � in her stomach and 
underneath�
