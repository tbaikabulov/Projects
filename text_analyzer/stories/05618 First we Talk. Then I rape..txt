First we Talk. Then I rape.

Synopsis: It was time for our first conversation since I'd captured the mother and her daughter. Before any physical abuse came my mental games, which I enjoyed almost (that's almost) as much.

��������� �It was time for
our first conversation.

��� ������� �I
had them both, mother and daughter, kidnapped and completely under my control
in my secret holding place far from prying eyes or where anyone might hear
their useless screams for me to stop or for help.� I'd had them this way for several hours by
now, and it was time to get on with my plans. Get my balls rolling, so as to
say and I really looked forward to our first words since their capture.� I pretty well knew what to expect. How
initially there would be demands and then negotiations, defiance and
resignation, but I had all the power, but they, especially the mother, didn't
know that. Not yet, but they would, soon enough. Boy would they ever know all
the power of my cock and twisted imagination and what the many ropes and hooks
and needles were for.

����������� I
entered the windowless, fortress-like room through the steel reinforced door
and strode right up to where I had them tethered by steel cables attached to
the ceiling and fastened around their necks secured with brass padlocks. They
were set upon a steel framed double bed with a hard mattress and white sheets.
I had untied their hands earlier and couldn't resist reaching in and squeezing
the mother's tit while she was unconscious. Her nipple got the pinch too and it
hardened. Her areola was crinkled brown. I wanted to poke her cunt but decided
to hold off to save and savour it all for later, sort of gradual discovery, you
might say. The kid was out cold too so she didn't see. Putting her onto the
bed, I'd knelt with my knee in her tight little crotch and pressed pretty hard
but didn't do anything else. I kneed her slowly. She sort of moaned but was
still mostly unaware. 

����������� But
now they were wide awake and fiercely angry along with being afraid.� Stupid cunts, they shouldn't have just been
afraid, they should have been� fucking
terrified. I was ecstatic. Pretty well orgasmic. (Just looking at them and
knowing they were my prisoners and sex slaves was beyond delicious and I could
compare their cunts and play one against the other, especially the daughter
against the mother which was often the very best part.)

&nbsp;

Page 2.

&nbsp;

��������� 'So,
what do you two think?' I started.

����������� Mother
replied hard and fast, 'Who the Hell are you? What do you want with us? Who are
you? I demand that you tell me.'

����������� I
replied, 'Right to the point. Right to the heart of the matter. No time for
niceties or small talk.'

����������� She
replied, 'What do you expect? That we're going to have a casual conversation?
That we're going to talk about the weather?' She paused and continued, 'You've
got us here, tied, against our wills and I demand to know what you think you
are up to?'

����������� 'I
don't think I'm up to anything. I
know what I'm up for.' I replied, sort of mocking her.

����������� She
looked puzzled. 'What does that mean? What's that supposed to mean?'

����������� 'It's
not supposed to mean anything. It
means what it means.' I paused for a moment and looked at the girl. 'What about
the kid', I said. 'doesn't she speak? Can't she talk?'

����������� 'You
leave her out of it, out of this. Anything you have to say, you address to me.
To me alone.' She demanded.

����������� 'Whatever.'
I dismissed her, thrusting my hand in the air.

����������� 'No,
not whatever. You understand? You talk to me or no one. Is that clear?'� She was extra assertive. I wanted to kick her
in the cunt or at least in the tits but settled for knowing I could any time,
or even better take it out on the kid's sex parts.�� 

����������� I
walked around to the girl on the other side of the bed. She was trembling and
her small breasts were heaving as she grasped for air through her fear.� Her stretchy tea-shirt might as well have
been soaking wet. Her matching pink short shorts clung to her tight little ass
and I wanted to shove my cock straight into it. No pleasantries. No
introductions. Just pull them down and ass fuck her harder than the meanest
bastard right in front of her mother. Hell, tie her up right on top of her
mother, both spread eagled and naked and crying. Now that would be sweet. Her
Mom must have sensed an air about me, like she knew what I was thinking,
because she changed to a conciliatory, less demanding tone and approach.

&nbsp;

Page 3.

&nbsp;

����������� 'Talk
to me, please. I have the answers. Whatever you want to know I can tell you.'
She sort of begged.

����������� I
wondered if she'd tell me how deep the kid's cunt was or was she still a
virgin? She probably was, but these days, who was to say for certain?

����������� I
said to the girl, 'So sweetie, is your Mom right? She does all the talking for
you?'

����������� The
girl nodded, yes, slowly. Her eyes cautious and fearful. (I wondered if she'd
felt my knee on her cunt and just hadn't let on.)

����������� 'She
do all your thinking too? Can you think for yourself? Answer for yourself?' I
continued.

����������� The
girl spoke for the first time, 'Of course I can talk and think for myself. My
Mom's taught me to do this. But she's scared for me, for both of us, so she
wants to protect me.'

��������� 'Don't
you sound all grown up, but protect you from me? When you don't know what I'm
going to do, if anything.' 

����������� 'She
wants to take care of me and is afraid.' She said again.

����������� 'She's
a good Mom, then? You think?'

����������� 'Yes,
she's the best and teaches us, me to be independent.'

����������� 'And
arrogant.' I added.

����������� The
girl looked confused a little and answered, 'No, not arrogant. Just sure of
ourselves and our abilities. Of who we are as girls, as women we'll become.'

����������� 'Then
she's a good Mom?' I replied.

����������� 'Yes,
I said the best.'

����������� I
leaned over to her to whisper into her ear. Her Mom cried out, 'Get away from
her. Don't you touch her. Stay away from her, You hear.'

����������� I
placed my hand on her arm, sort of across the front and only about an inch from
one of her little tits and was totally conscious of where her budding nipple
was. I ignored the frantic bitch mother and whispered to the girl, 'You think
she's a good Mom. You think she'd be a good fuck? She'd spread her legs good
and let me eat her pussy? You think she'd like to be my cock's friend or she'd
rather have you be my fuck buddy? Maybe even my little ass fuck buddy, right
between the cheeks?' 

&nbsp;

Page 4.

&nbsp;

����������� The
girl looked shocked and disgusted and fearful and I stared right through her.
Right through her clothes. (Which wouldn't be on her that much longer.)� I continued, 'You don't have to say right
now. Give it some thought and I'll be back to get an answer from you later.
Think about it lots. In fact, don't think about anything else.'

����������� The
girl still looked fearful but a little relieved as I brushed by her breastlet
and unhanded her and stepped away to get back to her Mom.

����������� 'What
did you say? What did you say to her? I want to know, what you said.' Mom
demanded.

����������� 'That's
our secret. It's between us and is none of your business. Isn't that right
Stephie?' (I knew the girl's name was Stephanie and she was called Stephie for
short.)

����������� Mom
looked shocked. 'How do you know her name? How do you know my daughter's name?'

����������� 'Jo-Anne,
that surprises you?' I replied. I now had called her by her first name for the
first time also. A fear, a realization came over her face. I could see it and
knew pretty well what she was thinking.

����������� She
spoke slowly, feeling her way for the right words. 'You know our names. Both
our names. Mine and my daughter's. Then this isn't an accident. It isn't
random. It's something you planned. It's something you knew in advance you were
going to do and did it. Isn't it? Tell me, isn't it?' There was genuine fear
just under her measured speech. And understanding and unfolding dread.

����������� 'That's
generally what planning is. Something you knew in advance you were up for or up
to, so yeah, you're quite right there.'

����������� 'Then
you know I'm a Doctor. I help people. You know this too?' She asked but by now
was grasping I knew lots about them.

����������� 'Yeah,
the best looking Doctor I've ever seen. You must have had a great time in Med
school being taken seriously. They must have thought you were a dumb beauty
queen who got lost and was in the wrong building.'

&nbsp;

Page 5.

&nbsp;

����������� 'It
wasn't easy being pretty and smart. People made assumptions all the time. I
think you're making assumptions too but you'd be wrong. You'd be..'

����������� She
sensed she shouldn't challenge or correct me too much but then couldn't help
herself. It was her know-it-all, good looking bitch outlook taking over again.
She was entitled. Or so she thought. (She was entitle to my prick in her ass
and in her kid's mouth, or so I thought and knew.)

����������� 'How
long?' She wanted to know. 'How long did you plan?'

����������� 'What
does that matter?' I replied.

����������� 'I
want to know and what are you planing, what are you up to?'

����������� 'Oh,
I don't know. Six months or a year, maybe longer.'

����������� 'A
year. A year to do what? Tell me. Tell me what you're up to. Or is it money? We
have quite a lot. I can probably get you quite a bit.'

����������� 'How
much is a lot?' I replied.

����������� She
pondered, then answered, 'Half a million. I know we, I could come up with half
a million.'

����������� 'You're
a doctor and your husband's a big-shot lawyer and half a mill is the best you
can do? Come on, give me a break.' (I'd seen him on TV about some over seas
fact finding mission and he was gone for three weeks which let me break into
their house to grab them. I made the timing perfect, like seized the
opportunity and them.)

����������� She
paused again. 'OK, maybe a million or a million and a half. Yes, I could get
one and a half million. Would that do it?'

����������� 'Why
didn't you say that right away? What, you trying to pay a bargain basement
ransom?'

����������� 'Then
that's it. You want us for money. If I get you the money, you'll let us go?'
She paused and then added hopefully, 'Unharmed?'

����������� I
stalled and looked at her cold and mean and said, 'I don't know about
unharmed.'

����������� 'What?
Stop it. Stop it. There'll be no payment if any harm comes to either of us. You
understand?'

&nbsp;

Page 6.

&nbsp;

����������� 'Well,
you may be right, but you might not be. I mean, if you hadn't tried to snow me
for the cheap payoff, lied to me, I could agree to that, but you misrepresented
your situation. What you could pay. You lied to me and you know what?'

����������� She
looked at me defiant and shook her head and looked like she knew she was about
to hear something awful, that something bad was coming. I continued, 'I hate
mouthy bitches who lie to me. I despise them and feel they should be punished
and depending upon the lie, the magnitude of the deception, sometimes they
should be severely punished, like even tortured.'

����������� 'Please.
I didn't. I don't.' She stammered.

����������� 'I
think you're a mouthy bitch. I know you're a mouthy bitch and you're teaching
the little cunt to be one too.'

����������� 'No.
No I'm not and I'm not and don't call her that.'

����������� 'Little
cunt. Littte cunt. My little cunt and don't you think a million dollar lie is
considerable and calls for extra punishment, even abuse, maybe sexual abuse?'

����������� 'Stop
it. Oh God. No. God, please, not that. I wasn't thinking. I was scared and only
wanted to...'

����������� 'To
cheat me out of a million bucks. That wasn't nice, was it? Not very generous or
considerate at all.' I pretended to whine.

����������� 'Please,
I said I was sorry.' She said.

����������� 'When?'
I asked.

����������� 'When?
What?' She was confused again.

����������� 'When
did you say you were sorry? I didn't hear it?'

����������� 'I
meant to. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You've got me all confused. Please accept that
I'm sorry.' She groveled and it didn't become her. Sure, I wanted her crawling
to me on her hand and knees, naked and bleeding, but not this soon. Her
groveling didn't do her justice at this point, not at all and I'd do her extra
hard for it later.

����������� 'Settle
down. Now I believe you and I'll tell you what. I'll forgive you. A million and
a half will do it. It's a fair chunk of change.'

����������� 'Oh
thank you. Thank you. And I'm sorry I misled you. When can we go? How soon can
we go?'

����������� 'We?'
I queried.

����������� 'Yes,
when can we go. When can we make the arrangements for us to pay and to go?'

&nbsp;

Page 7.

&nbsp;

����������� 'No
we.' I said.

����������� 'What?
What are you talking about? She was worried.

����������� 'No
we.' I replied and continued. 'The mill and a half is for you. You alone. Not
the kid too.'

����������� 'No.
No, no, no. But you said.' She stammered.

����������� 'No,
you said. You assumed. And as you said before, assumptions are often wrong and
your assumption is fucking wrong.'

����������� 'But,
no, but no, but a million and a half for us both or no deal.' She stated.

����������� 'Well,
I guess that's it then, no deal.' I smirked it at her.

����������� �She went silent, actually for quite awhile and
I loved it. She was squirming inside, trying to figure out her next angle and
approach. Then she blurted out, 'Please. please how much for my daughter too.
How much more will it take?'

����������� 'You
know, if you hadn't been so devious and tried to be cunning, one and a half
million would have done it for both of you. It would have, but punishment is in
order for your behavior so lets see, forty-eight and a half. That should do
it.'

����������� 'What
do you mean, forty-eight and a half, - thousand - more?' She hoped.

����������� 'No
you dumb cunt. (She looked angry at my reference to her vagina and hated when I
used the the C word. After all she was a Doctor and I should show respect, so
she thought.) Forty-eight and a half million more for the kid. Fifty million
and you're both out of here safe.'

����������� 'You're
crazy. You're out of your mind. We don't have that kind of money. No one does,
at least no one we know and we know some well off people. You're crazy. We
can't. I can't.' She was in anger shock and rambling.

����������� 'That's
OK. I guess that means you two have to stay awhile as my guests. Both of you as
my guests. So that's settled then. Unless...'

����������� 'Unless
what? What are you up to now?' She really didn't want to know but had to ask.

����������� 'Unless
you want to pay up and I let you go and keep the kid until you come up with the
rest. That could work.'

��������� 'Let
me go and keep my daughter?'� She said
incredulously.

��������� 

Page 8.

&nbsp;

��������� 'Yeah,
that'd work.'

����������� 'You're
insane. What kind of mother do you think I am. Do you really think I'd agree to
leave her alone here with you? Alone with you, a kidnapping maniac.' She was
furious.

����������� 'Cool
it with the names,' I retorted and then added, 'or at least get them all right.
Not just half right.'

����������� 'What?
I can't follow you. What kind of person do you take me for?' (One with two tits
and a cunt, and a great ass, and a little fuck bunny to match, I thought to
myself.)

����������� (I
wanted her to get the maniac part right and preface it with sex, sex maniac who
had them totally at his mercy and had lots of evil ideas and intentions. What a
fucking (wet) dream come true. I didn't say it and decided to play it out
longer. Keep my horrors I intended for them rationed, so to say. Revealed and
executed slowly and gradually and incrementally.)

����������� I
answered, 'What kind of mother? Not a fucking very good one. In fact, a
reckless one. I mean I've got you and I've got your cunt daughter here.
Helpless and controlled and you won't do anything to help her. So I don't think
you're much of a mother at all or you wouldn't have let it happen. And it's you
who's let it happen.' I really wanted to provoke her. Rub salt right into her
slit.

����������� 'But
you had a gun. You threatened to shoot her if I didn't co-operate. You forced
us to drink something that drugged us as you said you'd shoot us. What would
you expect us, me to do? Even the Cops say, when faced with an armed intruder,
co-operate. Do as you're told to prevent an accident or worse from happening.
So how dare you say I'm not a good mother. I was trying to protect her. How
dare you say it. How dare you...'

����������� With
that, she lunged for me wildly. I fucking loved it. It was just what I'd riled
her for. I'd hit a nerve, more sensitive than her G spot, better than her clit
(which I'd spend a lot of time working over in the weeks to come). It was
totally extra great. 

&nbsp;

Page 9

&nbsp;

����������� She
jerked forward to grab me and the steel neck restraint pulled taut as she was
in the air and she jerked back even harder. It fucking must have hurt plenty
and she grabbed her throat and sort of gurgled and cried out and flopped back
onto the bed. She'd almost strangled herself, or broke something in her neck
and she was a Doctor. You'd think she would know better. She settled down but
had torn the buttons off her silk blouse and ripped the sleeve. She tried to
cover her sheer pink satin bra but couldn't keep the two sides together. Her
bra was so thin her nipples showed right through. She saw me seeing and my eyes
eating her up but she couldn't see my cock doing it at the same time. Stupid
cunt Doctor bitch, now her tits were exposed and I hadn't even had to do it
myself.

����������� 'That
wasn't too smart.' I chided her. 'That must of hurt.'

����������� 'Leave
me alone. Leave us alone. You're a bastard to say that about me. A bastard.
Just leave.'

����������� 'I
guess I can do that. I can see you're upset. You've worked yourself into a
state. Anyway, I do have to go for now. I have a few errands. I'll be back
shortly.' And with that I was out the door (securely locked), out of the room
and into a little adjoining observation room I'd rigged up with a one way
mirror and listening and video devices. I could see and hear everything they
did and said when they thought I was gone. It was the most ingenious set up,
like the ones seen on TV for the Police line-ups or interrogation rooms. Since
they didn't know I was watching they would carry on accordingly as if they were
in private. It was superb and enlightening entertainment. I was to spend many
wonderful hours hearing their secret hopes and fears and plans to over-come, to
over-power, me. And came to know full well how deeply they really hated me for
all the vile and disgusting things I visited on their bodies and forced them to
do to each other. They never quite knew how I seemed to know what they were
hoping to plan and was always one step (usually at the very last minute when
they thought they had real hope) ahead of them.

&nbsp;

Page 10.

&nbsp;

����������� �It was delicious. The stupid cunts never had a
fucking chance. Not from the moment I first saw them at the beach laying there
face down, both with their tops unfastened and their asses in the air. I used
my cell phone camera to get several excellent pictures to keep me aware of what
I was hunting and setting out to capture. I waited for them to return home and
followed their BMW right to their house. It all was so easy it was almost a
joke. Women taking precautions. What a farce. Hey, all you good looking snot
bitches, somebody really wants your cunt, you can kiss it goodbye.

����������� Almost
immediately after I'd left the room and was watching and recording, the mother
asked her daughter, 'What did he whisper in your ear, earlier?'

����������� 'Mom,
are you OK. You neck's hurt. Are you alright?'

����������� 'I'm
OK. I shouldn't have let him provoke me like that. I should have stayed in
control. I'm sure he wanted me to react like that. I think he's smart. Smarter
than he seems. We have to watch him very carefully. But what did he whisper to
you?'

����������� The
kid blanched and didn't want to answer.

����������� 'What
did he say to you? You must tell me. He was saying about me being a good mother
and then he said something else, something private he said. Tell me what. Tell
me.'

����������� (She
was still toying with her blouse, trying to close the front. Then she took it
off to see if she could fix it. Needless to say, I could see her tits right
out. They didn't stand a chance either.)

����������� 'Mom.
Mom, I don't want to. Please, I don't want to.'

����������� 'I
can see that baby, but you must. I'm the adult and I have to know everything
possible that we're dealing with.'

����������� 'Mom,
please.'

����������� 'Tell
me Honey. Tell me Stephanie.'

&nbsp;

Page 11.

&nbsp;

����������� She
slowly stammered, 'He said, did I think you'd be a good... fuck and would you
spread your legs good and let him eat..... Would you like to be his cock's
friend or would you prefer I was his fuck buddy? That's what he asked and wants
an answer later.'

����������� 'Oh
no.' She cried out. 'Oh no. God. God no. Is that everything he said? Is that
all of it?'

����������� 'Please
Mom. I just told you. I did.'

����������� 'Did
you tell me everything? Steph, I know you. There's more. He said. Tell me.'

����������� 'Mom.
Mom..'

����������� 'No
matter what, tell me.'

����������� 'Then
he added, would you prefer I was his...his, his little ass fuck buddy? Mom,
please I don't want him to..'

����������� There
it was. The sex. The raping. Their cunts. Their ass holes, all out in the open.
My motives, (or at least some of my motives, since simple rape was child's play
for me) right out before her. She looked crestfallen and fearful and beaten and
fierce angry.

����������� 'Mom,
what are we going to do? What are we to do if he tries those kinds of things?
Mom, please.'

����������� 'I
don't know baby. But I won't let him touch you or hurt you. I promise. If it
has to be, he can do what he wants to me, but I won't let him harm you.'

����������� 'But
what if he wants to. What if he wants to hurt me. To hurt me down there and
back? The kid replied as she motioned to her cunt and behind.

����������� 'He
won't. I won't let him.'

����������� 'But
what if he wants to. Starts to. How would you stop him? You couldn't get to him
then and just hurt your neck for trying. How, Mom? How?'

����������� 'I'll
find a way, Stephanie. I absolutely swear. I'll find a way to protect you. You
have my word.'

����������� 'But
Mom..'

����������� 'No.
Steph, you have my absolute word.'

&nbsp;

Page 12.

&nbsp;

����������� With
that they stopped talking. I watched as they went into their own thoughts and
visions of what was to come. Mom was defiant and angry and determined and
rubbed her throat often and the kid cried softly. I suppose she knew down deep,
there was nothing her mother could do to protect her cunt or her sphincter if
she couldn't even protect her own, couldn't get beyond the steel neck line. If
her mother couldn't keep me out of their pussies, out of their ass-holes, what
was in store next? She was plenty
afraid and cried some more. 

����������� And
the more she cried, the more I wanted her to. 

����������� And
it all was so fucking easy to arrange for that.

����������� And
even easier to make them beg and scream.
