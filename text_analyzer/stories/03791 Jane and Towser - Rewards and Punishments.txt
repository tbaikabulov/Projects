Jane and Towser - Rewards and Punishments
Provided By: BDSM Librarywww.bdsmlibrary.com
Synopsis: Jane's appetite for Self Bondage culminates in a marathon session of a whole month in that happy condition. She has carefully trained both Towser, her own dog, and Bravo, a dog whom she is caring for during the long-term absence of his owner, to care for her during this long period of self-imposed helplessness. But she reckons without her adaptability to her hew life and her deeply innate subnissiveness, and the relationship between her and Towser changes for ever.Jane and Towser - Reward and Punishments. 
Chapter 1 
�Am I really sure I want to go through with this?� Jane asked herself for
  the umpteenth time. �For a full month? Are I sure it'll be safe?� 
It was the dogs she was worried about. Was she absolutely certain that the
  automatic feeder she'd made would work perfectly? As for herself, she knew
  that she was taking an enormous risk, but she was confident that the training
  she'd given them would hold. Certainly Towser would do his best; he really
  enjoyed this new game. But a month - give or take a day or so - was a very
  long time to spend in the role she'd chosen. Water would be her main problem
  if things went awry, but she expected to have some freedom of movement and
  she'd taken the precaution of arranging alternative emergency supplies in various
  places around the premises. She was as certain as she could be that the training
  of the dogs would hold over the period, and that they would obey the various
  ultrasonic signals the timer would send to them even without the rewards they'd
  received when they'd been trained. Once more she went through the workings
  of the various mechanisms she'd installed and tested over the last few weeks.
  She was untroubled by the prospect of casual callers at this remote old farm,
  and even if a rare caller arrived Jane would have ample warning, giving her
  plenty of time to hide among the maze of sheds, barns and outbuildings. And
  few visitors would care to risk an encounter with two such large and apparently
  ferocious dogs! 
Jane picked up her latest toy from the kitchen table; without this the whole
  scenario would be impossible. She it turned in her hands - a plain leather
  dog collar, slightly thicker than might have been expected and heavier than
  it seemed. The extra weight, as she knew, was due to the row of thin, flexible
  batteries sewn invisibly into the leather. Those, in conjunction with the the
  row of stainless steel studs around its interior circumference, would dealt
  the collar's wearer an agonising electric shock on receiving the appropriate
  signal from the computer. She checked the setting at which the signal would
  be emitted - two feet, ten inches. Getting down on all-fours, she buckled the
  collar around her neck with trembling fingers, wriggling her neck inside it
  and feeling the slick surface of least one of the studs continue to be in contact
  with her flesh. Then, her face a mixture of fear and determination, she attempted
  to stand. As she expected, the moment the crown of her head rose above the
  pre-set distance from the floor, she was knocked flat on her stomach by the
  powerful electric shock the collar delivered to her neck. She turned on to
  her side, her face screwed up in agony. But the pain of the shock swiftly passed,
  and Jane took off the collar and resumed her seat. 
Picking up the compressed air hypodermic, she studied its colourless contents.
  This was another tour de force on her part; a drug which would change her body
  odour until an antidote was injected. This was been a master stroke, she thought.
  No change in her scent was detectable to human senses, but to the keen noses
  of the dogs Jane would no longer be their Mistress, but the oddly-shaped animal
  they'd been introduced to so often in the weeks of their training. Even her
  collar had spent six months around the neck of a young Spaniel bitch, and the
  warmth of Jane's flesh would be sending out a faint hint of the bitch's characteristic
  scent for a considerable time. 
She glanced up at the kitchen clock. It would be two hours before the dogs
  would be released from the small brick shed they'd slept in for the last month.
  They would run straight to the long open-sided porch outside where their water
  bowl and feeding bowl were stationed. The water bowl was kept to a continous
  level of two inches, and the food would rattle down a metal chute in to the
  other bowl at eight o'clock in the morning and six o'clock at night. 
Yet again she checked the amounts of food available, and tested the mechanism
  for dispensing it. All was in perfect order, and she walked out into the fresh
  early sunshine intended to inspect what she thought of as her tethering points.
  The nearest was about thirty feet from the bowls, set firmly in the hard-packed
  earth in the corner where the wall of the house met the wall of an adjoining
  barn. The post was of sturdy oak almost three inches in diameter and stood
  nearly three feet high. There was others set around the property, including
  one in the dogs' shed, but she didn't bother with them. Despite the bright
  sunlight, it was chilly standing there in her thin nightdress, and she shivered
  before hurrying back into the warmth of the kitchen. 
She wandered about the house in restless indecision; did she really, REALLY,
  intend to go through with this? She made tea, and drank it thoughtfully. Then
  she checked the various timer settings yet again. The clock said seven - an
  hour before the dogs would be released - when she stood decisively and slipped
  out of her nightdress to stand naked on the cool, tiled floor. Seizing the
  hypdodermic, she rammed it against the flesh of her right buttock and pressed
  the trigger, hearing the short hiss as the drug was driven under her skin and
  knowing that it would take effect in half an hour or so.Everything was to hand
  upon the table before her, and her next action was to insert in her mouth the
  tiny plastic gag which would hold down her tongue without affecting her abilty
  to eat and drink. She practised speaking, but could only manage to gurgle incomprehensively.
  The short chain-leash she'd made for the occasion was next, clipping it to
  the collar, she allowed it dangle to her upper thigh. Collecting her padded
  mitts, she went outside. It was much warmer now, and she felt quite comfortable
  in the windless air as she locked the kitchen door and hung the key on its
  nail under the low eaves. Taking a last look through the kitchen window at
  the clock, she saw that the timer for her mitts would switch on in five minutes,
  at seven-thirty. Hastily she dropped to all-fours and buckled the collar around
  her neck before thrusting her hands into the mitts and settling the cuffs comfortably
  around her wrists. She had litle time to change her mind before the faint double
  click announced that her mitts were now locked on her hands, and she was irretrievably
  committed. Cautiously she raised her right hand - her right 'paw' now, she
  thought with a nervous giggle. Higher and higher she raised it, until it passed
  the invisible barrier that brought her instant, agonising pain. She found herself
  lying half-senseless on the hard earth, and it was some time before she managed
  to get back onto all-fours. She looked around her, once more struck by the
  difference in perspective from her present low level with her eyes no more
  that twenty inches or so from the ground. Then she walked off towards the small
  inner yard and the dogs' shed, her short leash trailing between her front paws. 
She found the dogs sitting at the barred door of their tiny shed, expecting
  their freedom at any moment. Jane moved close to the bars and allowed them
  to sniff her thoroughly, noticing their immediate sense of recognition. With
  a loud click and a whirr of machinery, the door began to swing open, and Jane
  moved out of its way to sit on her haunches and wait for the dogs to emerge. 
It was Bravo who reached her first. As he'd been trained so painstakingly
  to do, he seized the leather loop at the end of her leash in his powerful jaws
  and walked off, dragging her behind him by his shaggy side. Towser followed
  closely, occasionally sniffing her between her buttocks to reinforce his sense
  of her identity. 
Bravo led her into the shade of the porch and up to its far end where he neatly
  dropped the loop of her leash over the top of the post before walking back
  to join Towser in lapping at the water and then sitting expectantly by their
  large food bowl. 
Left alone, Jane sat 'doggy' fashion on her haunches and watched the dogs,
  guiltily aware of the warm, moist spot high up where her inner thighs joined.
  It had really happened, she thought with mingled amazement and apprehension;
  now she really was like them - naked, dumb and on all-fours. And she was collared
  like them too, as she was reminded whenever she moved her neck. But unlike
  them, she was tethered; dependant on them for food and water. That thought
  reminded her that she, too, was hungry, and she wondered, like the dogs, when
  she'd be able to feed. 
A sudden movement on their part told her that the dogs' morning ration of
  food had been delivered, and she stretched out on her belly and watched them
  eat, but not before noticing that Towser had hung back a trifle before joining
  Bravo. Evidently the latter was the leader of their little pack - now of three
  animals - and she had no illusions about her place in the hierarchy. The dogs
  finished eating. Towser trotted off on some errand of his own, while Bravo
  lay on his stomach, his long, thick forelegs stretched out before him. Jane
  moved restlessly. It had become quite hot, her bladder needed emptying, and
  she squatted and relieved herself forthwith. After all, she was an animal now,
  she reminded herself, and animals had no inhibitions about such conduct. Also,
  although a most fastidious young woman, she secretly enjoyed the freedom of
  action she enjoyed in her present incarnation. 
Bravo raised his head sharply to regard her, than came to his feet and walked
  over to sniff at the fast-disappearing little puddle of her urine. He raised
  a hindleg against the wall and added his contribution before taking the loop
  of her leash in his teeth and lifting it smoothly over the top of its post.
  This time Jane was ready for the dog's strong tug on her collar, and she followed
  him obediently to the water bowl. Bravo lay down on his stomach again, her
  leash trapped under his powerful right forepaw. Jane lowered her hot, sweaty
  face into the cool water and drank noisily before going on to the remains of
  the food the dogs had left uneaten. She already knew what she would find; the
  so-called vegetarian dog food had been left untouched except by the thrusting
  noses, and a good deal of the coarse cereal 'mixer' had been left too. Although
  her repast looked and smelt as disgusting as it tasted, Jane ate as much as
  she possibly could without actually vomiting. She'd steeled herself to do this,
  as she knew that the quantity of food she'd arranged to be dispensed would
  be barely enough for the three of them after a few days, and the dogs would
  make her eat last as she'd suspected they would. When she'd finished, she lay
  down by Bravo's side and considered what would happen next as her outraged
  stomach struggled to digest its recent meal. 
The next signal to the dogs was programmed to remind them of their next feed
  at six in the evening; two hours later another signal would summon them to
  their shed for the night. What she was going to do until then depended on the
  whim of the dogs. Whichever of them held her leashed at the time might release
  her to wander off as they'd done in the past; she couldn't go far, being restricted
  to the small field between the outer yard and the moor, to the yard itself,
  and to the smaller yard beyond. In the meantime, she closed her eyes and waited
  upon Bravo's decision. 
The huge body next to her moved suddenly, and she opened her eyes to see the
  great head lift and its eyes fix upon something in the field. The dog stood
  abruptly, still fixated on what only it could see, then walked off decisively.
  Jane rose too, and stood on all-fours watching Bravo's departure. But when
  he reached the open gate to the field, the big dog stopped, turned, and looked
  back at her. Seeming to come to some decision, he trotted back, took Jane's
  leash in his mouth, and pulled her with him to her post where he tethered her
  again. Then he ran off with the air of a job well done. 
Jane watched him go, her heart sinking. It was already terribly hot and sticky
  in the angle where the walls met, and the post was set only a few inches out
  from the corner, effectively confining the movements of her head and neck to
  an area equal to a quarter of a circle some two feet in diameter. As the ground
  dropped gently into the corner, so both her own urine and that of the dog had
  run down and soaked into the ground there; already it was beginning to smell
  unpleasantly. Worse, so short was her chain, that when she squatted to empty
  her bowels - as she would have to on some occasions - she would deposit her
  droppings no further than about three feet from the post. She thought of what
  the tiny area of packed soil would be like if she was to be tethered there
  for long periods and shuddered. With nothing better to do, Jane stretched out
  on the hot, bare earth and closed her eyes, recalling the events of the morning
  so far. 
She found herself unable to resist giving little wriggles of delight at her
  memories of being led by the the Alsation at her side, of the irresistible
  power of his jaws, of her own helplessness when he held her leash. And Towser,
  when his turn came, would be scarcely less powerful. She felt once more the
  guiltily delicious sensation of warm moistness high up between her thighs and
  clenched her eyes shut in ecstasy. Coming back to normality before she climaxed,
  she sighed, closed her eyes once more, and dozed off to wait for one of the
  dogs to return.This was by far the most dangerous part of the scenario � should
  the dogs' conditioning fail, she would stay tethered here to die of thirst.
  But she wasn't really concerned; there were plenty of stimuli available to
  persuade one of them to release her, if only to drink. As for the rest of her
  treatment, it would depend entirely on their training and their individual
  whims of the moment. Knowing that her best chance of getting through her ordeal
  was to spend as much time as possible asleep or dozing, she closed her eyes
  and turned off her mental activities one by one until she reached that state
  of half-trance she sought. 
Chapter 2 
She must have slept � or tranced � for quite a long time, for when she woke,
  she could see from the position of the sun that it was mid-afternoon. Congratulating
  herself on sleeping through the fierce heat of noon, she rose, stretched, and
  looked about her. Neither of the dogs were in sight, and her shoulders drooped
  in disappointment. She gave her tether a petulant tug before lying down again
  on her belly, her chin propped on her mitted hands, to stare miserably out
  onto the shimmering heat of the deserted yard. After a time she shifted uneasily
  at the urgings of her bladder; her gut, too, was ill at ease following her
  'meal' of the morning. Rather than wait for a dog to take her to empty her
  bladder - if it even decided to - she went to end of her short halter and squatted
  on the hot ground. While she urinated, to her horror her bowels gave way, depositing
  a glistening pile of turds between her legs. Worse, the distance she'd been
  able to put between the pole she was tethered to and where she'd been able
  to deposit her wastes was so small, and the hard packed earth sloped down to
  the wall with the result that she was obliged to stand or lie in a puddle of
  her own urine. Tired and bored, her arms aching from bearing the unaccustomed
  weight of her upper body, she waited until the pool of urine had sunk into
  the thirsty soil before lying down tentatively on the damp ground. Her back
  to the pole, she stared out into the yard in a state of semi-hypnosis until
  the flies found her droppings, and then her sweaty flanks. She groaned in disgust,
  and covered her nose and mouth with a front paw while she waited in mindless
  patience, like a tethered beast, for one of the dogs to appear. 
The shadows had lengthened considerably when Jane's prayers were answered
  and Towser appeared, loping easily over the yard towards her. He ran right
  to where she stood waiting, sniffed her vigorously � paying special attention
  to her collar and her cleft � then went to the water dish where he lapped thirstily.
  Waiting until he raised his dripping muzzle, Jane went down on her belly and
  whined as loudly as she could to attract his attention. Towser looked at her
  for a moment before trotting over and licking her back. Then he sat and looked
  thoughtfully at the short pole on which her leash was trapped. He gave a little
  shake of his head, as if remembering something, then raised his head and took
  up the end of her leash in his long jaws. He raised his head fully, and slipped
  the leash over the top of the pole, before sitting and dropping it at his feet.
  Jane roused herself and stood for a moment before moving tentatively in the
  direction of the water bowl, the end of her leash trailing after her. Towser
  followed her with his eyes, but other than that he made no move. 
Slowly and carefully in order not to disturb him, Jane lowered her thirsty
  lips into the warm, flat water. Scarcely had she begun her noisy lapping when
  she heard a flurry of movement behind her, and the sudden crushing weight of
  Towser's front paws on her shoulder blades almost sent her toppling. She felt
  with horror the urgent pressure of the front of his hairy thighs aganist the
  backs of her own, and the warm, hard, slimy tip of his member between the lips
  of her vagina. In shock and terror she flung herself forward to lie face down
  across the water bowl before rolling on to her side and scrambling away from
  him. Then, with vague memories of dogs mating that she'd seen, she sat firmly
  on her haunches and stared at him, wide-eyed and panting with shock and exertion.
  Towser stared back at her from three feet away; his penis still erect and a
  drop of his sperm glistening on its tip. Then his member subsided, he seemed
  to give a philosphical shrug, and he lowered his head to drink. 
Jane relaxed, feeling immensely cheered by this tame ending to the incident.
  Bitches couldn't be raped, she remembered being told. All they had to do was
  to sit on their haunches and the disappointed male would have to accept their
  decision - exactly what had just happened, in fact. She amused herself by imagining
  her dog's thoughts at that moment. The odd-looking bitch, with its fascinating
  scents, wasn't on heat yet, he'd be thinking; but it would come on heat eventually � after
  all, they always did! She giggled silently at the notion, heady with relief
  at her narrow escape, a good reference for the effectiveness of the scent-altering
  drug that she'd become an object of sexual attraction to her own dog! Her shoulders
  ached from the force of Towser's paws landing on them with such sudden heaviness,
  and she blessed her prescience on having the claws of both dogs clipped short
  previously � although it hadn't been the recent eventuality she'd had in mind,
  but the close bodily contact with them that she'd be obliged to endure. 
Anyway, the danger had gone, and Jane slowly edged away to a position from
  which she could see the large clock on the kitchen wall through the window.
  It read nearly six, the time for the dogs to be fed for the second time that
  day, and, sure enough, Bravo appeared in the paddock running towards them.
  Jane was twenty feet out in the yard, and Bravo paused to sniff her before
  seizing her trailing leash and dragging her with him to the food bowl where
  he exchanged sniffs of recognition with Towser. When both dogs were satisfied
  that all three of the party were the same creatures they'd been a few hours
  ago, they sat side by side before their food bowl, their eyes fixed on the
  opening in the wall through which their ration of food would drop into the
  bowl. 
The loop of Jane's leash was trapped around Bravo's left fore paw, and she
  had no alternative than to sit by his side and wait for the food to trundle
  down the chute. 
When it arrived � the same mixture of meat and vegetarian dog food with a
  copious supply of the the coarse, gritty cereal, both the dogs fell to with
  a will. Jane, suddenly aware of the demands of her empty stomach, contemplated
  joining them. There wasn't quite enough room for her to insert her head in
  competition with the dogs � not without some uninhibited shoving, at any rate � and
  she was unsure of their reaction. But a large chunk of cereal mixer was lodged
  on the dirty rim of the bowl where she could take it without disturbing the
  dogs, and she ventured to lower her head and scoop it up in her lips. The dogs
  lifted their heads and gave her twin flat stares from their yellow eyes. Bravo
  growled deep in his throat, and Jane bellied down in sudden fright. Evidently
  pacified by the submissive attitude of his little pack's most recent member,
  the huge dog returned to his food. 
Bravo ate swiftly, and he was sitting back licking his lips long before the
  Towser had finished. Jane looked up at pleadingly, alarmed at the speed at
  which the small remaining portion of food was diminishing under Towser's attentions.
  She tugged tentatively at her leash, and Bravo loosed his hold sufficiently
  to allow her to reach the bowl. Gingerly she lowered her head, all the time
  keeping a close and apprehensive eye on Towser. But, apart from a single dismissive
  glance, he ignored her � and so it was that Jane found herself bumping noses
  with her own dog in competition for the last scraps. 
Bravoi stopped the game abruptly by grabbing Jane's halter and dragging her
  away with him to lie down. Jane lay in front of him,facing him to give her
  leash its maximum length. Bravo stared past her, her leash trapped between
  his great paws. Jane rolled onto her back, at which Towser strolled over to
  sniff at her breasts and genitals. Now confident in her ability to cope with
  any more serious manifestations of his amorousness, Jane lay still, shamelessly
  enjoying his attentions. She spread her legs hoping he would lick her clitoris,
  but he merely gave her a look of disgust before turning away. 'Wow!' she thought
  with a giggle. 'I'm actually coming on to my own dog! And I bet he thinks I'm
  a real tease!' She laughed silently at the thought, before recalling his earlier
  attempt at intercourse. 
She sobered instantly, remembering the shock and terror of those moments,
  from the sudden weight of the dog and the brutal, urgent thursting of his thighs
  against her rump, to the terrifying feeling of his penis probing at the lips
  of her vagina. Had she not reacted with such instant energy, fired by by her
  instinctive horror, she might well have been penetrated by her own dog. The
  thought filled her with such shame and disgust that she almost vomited. In
  spite of the disgust she felt, her thoughts kept returning to the subject solely
  because, as she realised, a tiny seed of guilty enjoyment existed deep within. 
At the thought she shuddered in shame; but even as she did she felt herself
  becoming wet between the thighs. Disgusted with herself, she rolled over on
  to her stomach and ground her groin into the gritty soil. 
At last she relaxed and rolled onto her left side facing Bravo, her leash
  lying slack on the ground between her collar and his massive right paw. Even
  now she could scarcely believe her position, held leashed by a dog, to be led
  off wherever he wished, and she wondered what the dogs intended to do with
  her when they received the inaudible signal summoning them to the small shed
  where they'd be shut up all night. She devoutly hoped that Bravo wouldn't tether
  her to the pole where she'd spent a large part of the day; though there would
  be nothing she could do to prevent it. Come to think of it, she didn't know
  yet the full implications of what she'd trained the dogs to do, and how their
  behaviour would inevitably mutate over time without her constant correction � she'd
  been too busy persuading them to accept her as one of their own. And in that
  she had succeeded a little too well, she thought ruefully, glancing over to
  where Towser lay so innocently. 
But the evening was too warm and peaceful for any prolonged thinking, and
  Jane joined the dogs in lying there in mindless contentment. 
She was brought out of the pleasant vagueness she'd fallen into by the sudden
  stirring of both dogs simultaneously. Bravo's head was raised, and his large
  ears stood erect. He rose abruptly to his feet, then bent his head and picked
  up the loop of Jane's leash in his teeth. Seeing his intentions, Jane scrambled
  to all-fours in time to avoid a painful tug on her collar as Bravo walked slowly
  and purposefully away, Towser at his side. Jane padded obediently along at
  Bravo's other side, her flank bumped heavily at every step by his huge haunches.
  She was concentrating so much on her aching arms that she had no notion of
  where she was being taken until she recognised their surroundings as the stable
  yard beyond the main one, and was able to see that she was being led to the
  small shed at its far end. Its six foot wide, full height barred door stood
  open, and when Jane was led through it she was aware at once of the thick straw
  on the concrete floor � and the smell! 
She had no time for further observations, for Bravo at once dragged her to
  the rear wall of the gloomy little shed and thrust the loop of her leash over
  just such another pole as had held it before and once more she was tethered
  helplessly on her two foot leash. 
She heard a loud clang from the entrance; unable to turn around due to the
  shortness of her tether, she stood parallel to the wall and turned her head
  to see that the barred door had now closed and that she and the dogs were shut
  up for the night in this dark, foul-smelling shed. 
The dogs seemed unperturbed by their imprisonment; but they'd been trained
  to accept it over the last month or so. Both of them padded through the damp,
  dirty straw and flopped down on their bellies, one on either side of her. Towser
  turned on his side with his hairy back to her, while Bravo lowered his great
  head, propped it on his outstretched paws, and fell asleep. 
Jane stood for a moment, not relishing the thought of lying down on the straw,
  faintly damp with the dogs' urine and hiding nameless horrors mixed in with
  it � an aversion that became all the stronger when she shifted position and
  felt something soft and unpleasantly squashy under a thin layer of damp straw
  beneath her left knee. She cursed herself for not remembering to give them
  fresh bedding before she'd begun her adventure. Another horrible possibility
  arising from her enforced close proximity to the dogs struck her � fleas! It
  had been some time since she'd de-fleaed her own dog, and she'd no idea when
  Bravo had been done the same service by his owner, at present out of the country
  for an extended period. She didn't think that either dog had fleas at the moment,
  but both roamed the moor at will, and the animals out there were certainly
  not as fortunate. 
But she couldn't possibly stand here all night; her arm muscles were screaming
  at her for relief, and she gingerly lowered her body into the prickly straw,
  shrinking at its clammy embrace. It smelt even worse at close quarters, but
  she shut her eyes and tried to sleep nontheless. 
Chapter 3 
She woke during the night to feel the heavy warmth of Bravo's thigh lying
  across her own. A thick foreleg rested on her shoulder, and his broad lower
  jaw on her head. She and the dog were facing each other, their chests and bellies
  so close that she could feel the heat from his huge body. Tower lay with his
  back touching hers, and she drifted back to sleep grateful for the warmth of
  the dogs, her fear of fleas forgotten. 
It grew colder as the night wore on, and the three bedfellows came still closer
  together for warmth. When Jane awoke for the second time she found that Towser
  had turned on his side during the night, and now he and she lay like two spoons,
  her haunches surrounded by his, her buttocks hard against his hairy groin and
  the rear of her thighs against the the front of the dog's. His chest was pressed
  to her back, and a foreleg lay across her neck, while she could feel the warmth
  of his soft breathing on the back of her head. Bravo, too, had moved in his
  sleep; now the back of his head was pressed into her stomach with his hairy
  ears tickling her breasts, and his curved spine aganist her belly. Jane lay
  for several minutes, enjoying the warmth before she fell asleep again. 
The next time she woke it was daylight, though from what she could see through
  the bars the sun had not yet risen, and she wondered when the door would open
  and free them, hoping that it would not be long. Like the dogs, she composed
  herself to wait � but some things would not wait, as she realised to her dismay
  when her bladder sent her an urgent message. Nor was she the only one, for
  Towser abruptly rose and walked to the nearby wall where he lifted his leg.
  Freed of his embrace, Jane stood hastily, backed away as far as her tether
  would allow her, and squatted. She and the dog glanced at each other as they
  urinated, and Jane felt another of the tiny shivers of guilty pleasure at thus
  being forced to carry out her natural functions in the company of her own dog.
  The powerful reek of dog urine filled the still air as Bravo rose and followed
  their example, then all three lay down together and waited patiently to be
  released. 
The stable yard was filled with sunlight when there came a sharp click, a
  whirr of machinery, and the barred door swung slowly open. The dogs trotted
  outside immediately, shaking themselves to rid their coats of clinging straw,
  ignoring Jane's despairing whines. She tugged desperately on her leash until
  her neck and shoulder muscles ached, but to no avail. She stood for a moment
  in the filthy straw before lying down in tears of despair. 
How long she lay there, staring hopelessly out into the sunlight, she never
  knew; but when Towser returned and released her she stumbled out into the clean
  fresh air to find that the shadows were still chilly, and the warmth from the
  sun on her damp, smelly body was still pleasant, instead of the burning heat
  it would become later. 
Towser padded slowly away, turning his head frequently as if to check on Jane's
  progress. She followed him docilely � since this was what he seemed to expect � her
  leash trailing in the dirt at her side. As they walked through the sunlight,
  Jane was dully aware of the tiny bits of straw that clung to her body falling
  from it, and a slow puckering of the skin on her lower back announced the drying
  of a quantity of dog excrement she had rolled in during the night.But she was
  beyond caring, her only thought was for the food and water bowls she was being
  taken too, and even when Bravo came bounding up to seize her leash in his jaws
  she only accepted it as the natural order of things, and obeyed his tugs on
  her collar without resentment. Once at the bowls, Bravo stood with her leash
  dangling from his jaws while she drank and snuffled down greedily the small
  amount of food the dogs had left uneaten. When she lifted her head, she was
  dragged off and tethered in the same place where she'd been the day before.
  The dogs trotted off together, leaving her to herself. 
She watched them vanish into the moor, then sprawled listlessly on the hard
  ground, disturbing the flies crawling over her turds of yesterday. 
She must have fallen asleep, and when she woke it was with a peculiar feeling
  of peace. She rose and yawned, then emptied her bladder where she stood. As
  she watched the liquid slowly disappear into the dry ground, she pondered lazily
  on the cause of her sudden contentment with her condition. Perhaps, while she
  slept, something had happened deep within her unconscious mind, she speculated.
  She yawned again, and lay down on her belly with her back to the wall and her
  head propped on her paws, looking out over the shimmering heat of the yard,
  ignoring the flies that had begun to crawl on her back and legs, attracted
  by her dirt and the sweat on her skin. 
After an unknown period a speck in the distance resolved itself as Towser.
  He trotted slowly across the yard, keeping to the shade, and went immediately
  to the water bowl to lap thirstily. Jane bellied down and whimpered at him
  from thirty feet away, When he finished, he shook the excess water from his
  muzzle, then sat and stared at her curiously. Jane redoubled her efforts, and,
  finally, Towser gave a baffled little shake of his head before walking over
  to her and releasing her. 
Jane crouched over the bowl and drank, keeping a wary eye on her dog for a
  repetition of his behaviour of the day before. But Towser merely lay and watched,
  and, when she'd finished drinking, he rose and walked slowly away, turning
  his head frequently to check that she was following him as he obviously expected.
  He led the way all round the yard and into the paddock. When they had to walk
  through the sunlight it struck Jane's back and shoulders like a hammer-blow,
  and she was glad when Towser led them into the small grove of trees in one
  corner. The grass was greener and taller in the shade of the trees, and it
  was cool under her skin when she lay down on it. There they lay peacefully
  side by side until Jane felt a familiar stirring in her colon. Without more
  ado she rose and walked out into the hot sunlight, where she squatted and emptied
  her bowels in a continual gush on to the short, brown turf of the paddock.
  Towser was watching her, his head raised, but when she began to walk back to
  him he lowered his head again. 
Jane was filled with a sudden, strong affection for her dog. He wasn't a strict
  jailor like the absent Bravo. Towser didn't hold her by her leash in his immoveable
  jaws all the time � or tether her when he grew tired of her - and he'd taken
  her with him to this blessedly cool spot and let her roam around at will; although
  she was very careful not to move too far away from him. 
She was beginning to enjoying the experience, in a passive sort of way ; she
  thought as she sprawled lazily on the cool grass. She was learning how to lie
  comfortably on the hard ground of the yard, and she was fast learning to accept
  her place as the inferior in this tiny pack of three in which Bravo, by virtue
  of his size and strength, was the Alpha male whenever the real pack leader
  - herself in her human manifestation - was absent. 
Rising, she walked slowly the few feet to where Towser lay on his side. His
  eyes were closed, though she saw one of his ears prick up immediately at the
  sound of her rising, then droop as she neared him. Standing over him, on an
  impulse she lowered her head and licked his muzzle, then buried her nose in
  the thick fur of his neck. He rolled lazily onto his back, and she nuzzled
  his stomach. Then, daringly, she tentatively nuzzled and licked the short thick
  fuzz on his member. Towser made a little sound deep in his throat as his penis
  gently rose, but Jane withdrew to lie on her belly by his side, her head propped
  on her paws. There she dozed off. 
Chapter 4 
It was late afternoon when Towser rose to his feet. He sniffed her head, then
  began to walk slowly away across the paddock. Jane scrambled to her feet and
  followed him. He paused to urinate on the fence, and she squatted and followed
  suit before they passed through the gate into the yard. There Towser led the
  way to the kitchen porch where Bravo already lay panting in the shade. The
  big dog raised his head alertly at the sight of Jane, but when she walked up
  to him, turned around, and lay by his side, he relaxed, not even bothering
  to put a paw on the loop of her trailing leash. 
Lying there in the hot, still air between the dogs, patiently waiting to be
  fed, Jane felt strangely, lazily content. She was vaguely aware of her condition,
  and of the strange sight the group presented of a naked, collared, dirty and
  smelly woman lying in the dirt flanked by two large dogs, but she didn't care.
  Like them, she ignored the flies that buzzed around their heads and crawled
  on their bodies, though she envied them their tails, which every now and then
  disturbed the flies on her own haunches as the dogs occasionally twitched them
  . 
As if at some invisible signal the dogs rose and sat before their feeding
  bowl, staring at the mouth of the chute down which their food would come .
  After a few seconds Jane joined them, sitting on her haunches a little way
  further off. The food plopped into the bowl, and the dogs lowered their muzzles
  into it eagerly. But Jane made no move. Her stomach roiling in hunger, she
  waited patiently until they'd finished eating and drunk from their water bowl.
  Then she gave a little whine of enquiry, looking from one dog to the other
  in mute appeal. Bravo stared at her dismissively before lowering his head between
  his paws, and Tower merely spared her a glance before walking slowly away around
  the corner of the house. 
Taking this for permission, Jane slowly went to the bowls and, after a further
  glance at Bravo, she lowered her head and ate. Then she lapped from the water
  bowl before going back to Bravo and lying by his side again. He turned his
  head to look at her, but once again he made no move to trap her leash. 
When the evening sky began to darken Bravo rose abruptly. Seizing her leash,
  he led the passive Jane slowly across the yard and into the small shed in which
  they spent their nights. Towser was already there, and the barred door closed
  behind them as Bravo thrust the loop on Jane's short leash onto its securing
  pole. Jane lay down and wriggled her body into the damp, smelly straw. Closing
  her eyes, she prepared to sleep. 
She dozed and woke all through the interminable night, as patient as the dogs
  she lay with, waiting to be released. Once she had to rise to empty her bladder,
  turning to face the wall she sqatted to urinate, and when she lay down again
  her hips lay in the wet straw so short was her tether. 
When the first, faint light of dawn relieved the pitch darkness of their prison,
  the dogs rose to lift their legs against the wall, then went and sat in front
  of the bars to wait for the door to swing open. 
The first rays of sunlight illuminated the stable yard, and the whirr of the
  electric motor announced the opening of the door. The dogs rose to depart.
  Jane uttered a frantic whimper, and Bravo stopped, turned, and looked back
  at her. Seeming to come to a sudden decision, he trotted across the straw and
  released her. Then he walked out of the shed. He hadn't bothered to grab her
  leash in his jaws as he always had before, but Jane lost no time in scrambling
  after him, and she tried to keep pace with him as he trotted away. She was
  a long way behind him when she came into the big farm yard, but, apart from
  an occasional glance behind him, Bravo didn't seem perturbed, and he and Towser
  were already eating when she arrived panting to join them. 
When they'd finished she was permitted to eat and drink without incident,
  then she lay down at Bravo's side and joined him in what seemed to be his favourite
  activity of staring drowsily into space. She was getting used to this mindless
  pastime; it was becoming quite pleasant to lie there motionless, all her mental
  activities switched off. And the time seemed to pass much quicker too. It was
  getting hard to remember how long she'd been like this � was this the third
  or the fourth morning of her ordeal? But it wasn't important, and she laid
  her head on the dog's thick left fore-leg and closed her eyes. 
It was mid-morning when Bravo stirred at last. Getting to his feet, he yawned
  and stretched. Then he turned to look at her. Divining his intention, Jane
  picked the end of her leash just below its loop in her mouth and rose to her
  feet, offering the loop to him. He stared at her curiously for a moment before
  taking the loop and leading away. When he'd secured the end of her tether in
  the usual place, he licked her shoulder and trotted away. Jane stood and watched
  him out of sight, absurdly glad that she'd won the dog's approval. Then she
  lay down again, ignoring the flies and the smells of the immediate area, now
  being used by the dogs to urinate in, and with the turds she'd there deposited
  a day or so earlier now drying and crusted. 
Once again it was Towser who rescued her in mid-afternoon. He paused to cock
  a leg against the wall while Jane squatted and emptied her bowels as unselfconsciously
  as if she'd been alone and sceened from any observation. There was a certain
  freedom, she decided, in no longer being forced to obey human social restrictions,
  and she compounded her lack of inhibitions by wriggling her haunches before
  her dog's eyes as she led the way to the water bowl. He seemed to lack interest,
  but she kept a wary eye on him as she lapped. 
As on the day before, he led her to the cool grove in the paddock. There,
  Jane experimented with the limits of his trust in her by running around him
  in ever-widening circles. To her vast delight she found she could run quite
  quickly on the tips of her toes and the tips of her mitted hands � though with
  little forward vision. Further and further away she got, always keeping an
  anxious eye on the dog's reactions, until at a distance of thirty feet from
  where he lay watching her he gave a low growl and made to rise. Jane instantly
  changed course to become nearer to him, at which he visibly relaxed. 
Tired and panting, Jane lay down by her dog, her head near his rump to take
  advantage of the occasional flicks of his tail to ward off the flies. 
Shortly after he rose, and stared fixedly across the paddock, and Jane tensed,
  fearing she'd be led back and tethered, but whatever had attracted the dog's
  attention had vanished � if it had ever existed � and he made to lie down again.
  But Jane, in relief mixed with gratitude, plus a generous dash of sheer mischief,
  had risen to all-fours and gone down on her elbows, her head low to observe
  him between the arch of her spread thighs. She felt again the warm moistness
  well from her genitals, and saw Towser, intrigued both by her smell and her
  inviting posture, approach her from the rear. Seconds later she felt the cool
  dampness of his nose, and then the warm, wet roughness of his tongue. Then
  he withdrew a little, and Jane steeled herself for what she knew he would attempt
  to do. 
He was astonishingly quick. One moment she could see him standing a foot or
  so behind her; the next his paws skidded across her shoulder blade to dangle
  around her neck, and his hairy chest and belly lay heavily on her back. The
  front of his hairy thighs pressed hard against the back of hers, and she experienced
  once again the sick the horrror of his member urgently probing her vagina for
  access. As before, she flung herself violently forward to escape, but it was
  more difficult this time as Towser had distributed his weight on her back more
  evenly. She succeeded in falling flat on her face in the cool grass, and lay
  there panting at the nearness of her escape. Towser had withdrawn; he sat on
  his haunches, his spine bent and his head lowered to his groin. licking his
  genitals as if in consolation. 
Then he lay down on his belly,and stared at her philosophically. Jane, recovering
  her poise, turned on her side and faced him, giggling as she imagined the doggy
  thoughts running though his shaggy head. But another dog would have known them.
  His shapeless, slow thoughts � if that was how they could be described � were
  that this oddly-shaped, hairless bitch, with her intriguing mixture of smells,
  was fast coming on heat, and he meant to be there when she did. Some of the
  half-wild dogs of the neighbouring farms had been as difficult to mate with,
  but he'd always succeeded in the end. He paused to stare jealously around for
  competitors, discounting Bravo, whom he sensed was now too old. Finding none,
  either in view or within scenting range of his sensitive nose, he relaxed. 
They dozed away the hot afternoon, and when the shadows lengthened Towser
  led the way back to the kitchen porch where Bravo already lay waiting to be
  fed. Food! At the very thought Jane's belly rumbled loudly and her mouth filled
  with saliva. She lay down at Bravo's side and hoped devoutly that the dogs
  would leave her enough of their meal. 
The dogs rose to sit at their feeding bowl, their eyes fixed on the chute.
  When their rations slithered into the bowl, their noses thrust in to it together,
  and the only sounds were of their noisy eating. 
Towser finished first. Giving Jane an absent glance as he passed, he trotted
  away into the evening. Jane debated whether to join Bravo at the bowl, but
  decided against it. As pack leader, he should not be disturbed while he ate,
  and she waited patiently for him to finish. 
Bravo raised his huge head from the bowl, and licked his lips and muzzle.
  Then he walked slowly away without sparing Jane a glance. She waited a few
  moments then moved to the bowl. As usual, the dogs had eaten very little of
  the vegetarian dog food, except that they'd pushed it around in their search
  for the meat, and there was quite a lot of the coarse cereal mixer uneaten.
  Lowering her head, she snuffled up the remains of their meal. When it had all
  gone, she wiped her face with her forearm and licked the smears of food from
  her skin. 
Sitting, she realised with surprise that she was alone. Bravo had gone, and
  for the first time Jane was left untethered and unsupervised by a dog. It felt
  strange not to have to wait for one of them to take her where they wanted her
  to go, and she wondered what to do with her new freedom. 
In the end, she lay down where she was, and when Bravo poked his head around
  the corner on the other side of the yard, she obeyed his short bark and scurried
  over to him, the loop of her leash in her mouth. Later, tethered on the stinking
  straw, she drowsily wondered at her unthinking subservience. 
She was aware that Bravo, in his dim, doggy fashion, was pleased with her.
  The bitch he'd been charged with caring for was obedient. He licked her flank
  affectionately; she was coming on heat, he noted, but he wasn't too interested.
  He was old, and there was something about her smell that put him off, somehow.
  Towser, on her other side, slept with his left foreleg flung over her waist,
  his nose buried between her breasts. 
Huddled together for warmth, the three slept on. 
Chapter 5 
The endless days passed identically for Jane. She discovered a real talent
  for lying comfortably on the bare ground and dozing the time away. Her dirt
  and smell no longer troubled her, and Bravo had become convinced of her docility,
  and rarely tethered her now, nor held her by her leash, but Jane took great
  care not to wander off out the sight of at least one of the dogs, and she came
  running whenever they barked for her. The hot, lazy afternoons in the grove
  with Towser were her favourite times, when she lay with her head on his shaggy
  thigh after going through her usual routine of teasing him sexually. And then � disaster! 
It was the hottest day so far; so humid that Towser lay panting and Jane felt
  hot and sticky even in the relative coolness of the grove. They were lying
  side by side on their bellies in the grass, dozing in the lazy heat. Jane rolled
  over on to her side and licked Tower's muzzle for the salty taste of the ever-present
  thin film of mucus on his damp nose, then, with the warm moistness beginning
  to well high up between her thighs, she rolled onto her other side. Her back
  to the dog, she hitched her thighs level with his head and lay with her legs
  splayed. Towser prodded her cleft with his cool nose, and she gave a little
  squeal of drowsy delight. Almost by instinct, Jane rose to all-fours and stretched,
  then walked slowly in front of her dog and went down on her elbows with her
  back to him. Her rump raised invitingly in the air, her knees spread, she lowered
  her head and lazily regarded Towser through the gap between her thighs. He
  rose and stretched, then sniffed at her crotch before seeming to lose interest
  and lie down again. Jane was disappointed, perhaps she'd teased him too often,
  perhaps he'd lost interest in her. 
But it was so comfortable in this position, bearing the weight of her upper
  body on her elbows with a tiny current of cooler air brushing gently past her
  belly and the damp skin of her inner thighs. Placing her forehead on her mitts,
  she closed her eyes whilst behind her, unnoticed, Towser's member stiffened
  and grew. 
Jane gave a little gasp of surprise and shock as the dog's weight landed on
  her back and his upper forelegs slid down on either side of her neck, gripping
  it firmly between them. His rear paws had planted themselves in front of her
  knees, and his chest ground down on her back, his warm, shaggy belly draped
  over her buttocks. She felt the slimy tip of his penis probe at the opening
  to her vagina, and she struggled violently to escape. But all the air had been
  dashed from her lungs by his sudden assault, and his forelegs gripped her neck
  so tightly that she could scarcely breathe. Jane uttered a little cry of horror
  and despair as Towser's fuzzy, enlarged penis slipped past the lips of her
  vagina, then her senses reeled as his thighs thumped the backs of her own in
  an urgent rhythm. Her body shuddering under his frantic attack, she felt herself
  responding automatically, and, filled with a terrible mixture of guilt and
  desire, she responded in her own fashion, grinding her buttocks against his
  pumping thighs, feeling the pressure of his lower jaw holding down her head
  and the panting of his hot breath in her hair, until she climaxed at the the
  same time he did. With a sob of exhaustion, she went limp. Towser, as is the
  way with animals, didn't linger. Jane felt his member shrink and grow soft
  before he heaved himself from her back and withdrew it. 
She stayed where she was, feeling his semen, mixed with her own blood and
  fluids, seep from her vagina down the inside of her thighs. She was still in
  a state of shock, scarcely able to believe what had just happened. 'I've lost
  my virginity to my own dog!' she thought, dazedly. 'And I enjoyed it!' 
And she HAD enjoyed it; she had enjoyed his physical urgency, and the brutal
  and efficient manner in which he'd entered her, and even his rank male-animal
  smell which still clung to her body. Straightening her front legs, she slowly
  raised her upper body and turned to face him, finding hin lying a few feet
  away, looking at her with a complacent expression on his doggy face. She couldn't
  resist a choked gurgle of laughter; he looked so pleased with himself! 
Jane squatted and urinated into the grass, then lay down and rolled in the
  wet patch, after which she walked over to the dog and licked his muzzle while
  she enjoyed the coolness of her urine evaporating from her back in the heat.
  She lay down by his side again, trying to get to grips with her recent experience.
  No-one will ever know, she thought, except me and Towser, but she wondered
  how her dog would regard her when she re-assumed her human persona as his Mistress,
  and she suddenly giggled at the notion of him trying to rape her in some public
  place, or trying to rape some other woman once he acquired the taste for it. 
Towser watched her through eyes half-closed in drowsiness. The oddly-smelling
  bitch had come on heat at last, he thought in his fuzzy fashion. He wondered
  how long she'd stay on heat, for he'd considerably enjoyed the experience.
  Her tightness was a revelation to him, used to the rangy middle-aged bitches
  he met on the few and scattered neighbouring farms, and his penis began to
  rise slowly in remembrance. Jane turned her head a little to regard him lazily,
  then rolled on to her belly and yawned. Towser subsided, and they fell asleep
  together under the trees. 
Chapter 6 
Later, as Towser led the way to the kitchen porch to drink and to wait to
  be fed, Jane walked by his side, holding her leash in her mouth. Bravo was
  there already, lying down with his head on his front paws. He raised his head,
  alerted by the smell of recent sex, and Towser stopped and lay before him on
  his back in submission, as if asking his pardon for having taken their bitch
  in advance of the pack leader and Bravo licked his belly as if in forgiveness.
  Towser rose and went to the water bowl, where he allowed Jane to drink by his
  side. On their return to join the big Alsatian, Jane, with some vague idea
  of paying homage to the leader of the pack, turned her back on him and went
  down on her elbows in mute invitation. Watching him between her thighs, she
  saw him rise and walk towards her. But Bravo still wasn't really interested
  in this odd bitch; she didn't smell right to him, and, though his member rose,
  it soon subsided and the big dog contented himself with licking her buttocks
  and thighs. 
The dogs ate, then Jane, and then they lay together until it was time for
  them to go to their little shed to be shut in for the night. Bravo led the
  way, with Towser at his side, and Jane followed closely behind them, carrying
  her leash in her mouth. Once they were behind the barred door of their pen,
  Jane sprawled luxuriously in the dirty straw, at peace with the world and herself. 
She woke several times during the night, her head pillowed on Towser's flank,
  her nose buried in his fur. Her behaviour didn't seem so terrible to her now,
  though she was a little sore between her thighs, and she was glad that the
  bigger dog hadn't taken advantage of her offer. But the soreness inside her
  would quickly pass, and she even found herself wondering if she would give
  Towser another opportunity. 
There was a change in the next day or so. Not in the weather, which remained
  enervatingly hot and increasingly humid, but in the relationship between the
  three of them and in Jane's treatment by the dogs. Towser, perhaps by virtue
  of being the only sexually active male in their tiny pack, seemed to Jane to
  have taken over the position of leader. At any rate, it became he who now controlled
  her movements, leading her back and forth, and tethering her to the wall in
  the mornings after she'd fed. Jane had thought him a less hard master than
  the big Alsatian, but this proved to be no longer the case once he'd taken
  over mastery of her. There were no more excursions to the paddock for Jane,
  instead, except for the daily walk to and from the the shed where they were
  kennelled � during which her leash was held firmly in her dog's powerful jaws
  - she was now kept tethered all the time, either in the shed at nights, or
  to the pole in the yard during the days. 
Worse, it was clear that Towser, having once bent her to his will sexually,
  was intent on more of the same. One afternoon, as she lay drowsing surrounded
  by her own excreta on the little patch of hard ground to which she was confined
  by her tether, Towser trotted into the yard to drink. Jane stood and waited
  for him to finish and come to lead her to drink in her turn. And so he did,
  but in a very different manner from which he'd ever approached her before.
  His member was already stiff, and he nudged her shoulder with his nose in an
  obvious order to her to turn her back on him. Jane stared at him in dismay.
  His confidence that he would be obeyed unsettled her, and the the flat yellow
  glare in his eyes frightened her. Towser nudged her flank impatiently and growled
  at her, opening his mouth to show his sharp white teeth 
With a little sob of fear and helplessness, Jane turned her back on him and
  went down on her elbows, resting her forehead on the dirt between her mitts.
  Closing her eyes in resignation, she waited for the inevitable. As before,
  he was brutally quick, and when he withdrew and cocked a hind leg against the
  wall a foot or so from her to empty his bladder, he left her sobbing with shame
  and horror, not even moving when an occasional drop of his strong-smelling
  urine splashed on her skin. 
Jostling her aside, the dog then seized her leash and dragged her to water.
  A few minutes later, when he'd tethered her again, he went back to the feeding
  area and lay on his belly with his head on his paws regarding her with satisfaction.
  Jane straightened her aching arms and turned to face him, wincing at the soreness
  between her thighs. She could read his muzzy, doggy thoughts like a book. For
  a moment she hated her dog for his self-satisfied male complacency, for his
  obvious confidence in his domination over this strange bitch that he could
  take whenever he pleased, and she hated herself for her own forced acceptance
  of the situation. 
Bravo walked slowly around the corner of the house. Panting audibly in the
  heat, he lowered his head into the water bowl and drank. Raising his head to
  shake the water from his muzzle, he sniffed the air and turned to look sharply
  in Jane's direction. Purposefully, the big dog walked over to where she stood
  passively. She felt Bravo's nose probe her vagina, and she saw Towser lift
  his head a little to stare at them before lowing it again and closing his eyes
  in apparent boredom. 
When the Alsatian's big, heavy paws landed on her shoulder blades Jane went
  down on her elbows almost with indifference. The larger dog took her with surprising
  gentleness, and the experience was not nearly as painful as she'd feared. When
  he climbed down, he gave her thigh a friendly lick before urinating in the
  same spot as Towser had used and walking off to lie down by the other dog. 
Jane stared at the dogs with dull eyes, too shocked and dispirited even to
  cry. Slowly and painfully, she turned to regard the tiny, filthy patch of bare
  earth she was confined to. The puddle of dog urine lay only a foot from the
  hole where her short tether was secured. It had spread, and was slow to soak
  into the hard-packed soil. Finally Jane lay down on the still damp ground with
  her back to the dogs and wept in misery and despair. 
Up until then, she realised, despite her mitts, her gag, her nakedness and
  her collar, and despite her being able to walk only on all-fours, she had still
  been unconsciously expecting the dogs to regard her as a human being and their
  superior. Bitterly she realised her real position in their eyes; an oddly-shaped,
  hairless female animal. Her recent rape by the dogs had been much worse than
  the first one a day previously, then she'd been able to tell herself that she
  had brought it on by her own choice. But there had no choice this time, nor
  would there be in the future. Towser must be in doggy heaven, she thought dispassionately,
  with unlimited access to a tethered bitch. Incredibly, she dozed off, and was
  only woken by the sound the dogs made as they ate. 
She stood and waited to be led off to feed on their leavings, but they ignored
  her desperate whinings, and it was only when they were due to be shut up in
  the shed that Towser led her off to eat as quickly as she could while he stood
  over her, twitching her leash impatiently. 
The pattern of her existence became set. Every morning the dogs were freed,
  but Jane was left tethered. An hour or so later, after the dogs had eaten,
  Towser would return and lead her over to feed. Then he'd tether her to the
  pole until mid-afternoon when he'd lead her to drink. When he'd secured her
  again, he'd demand his reward and she'd go down on her elbows docilely and
  endure his attentions. 
She became dull-eyed and indifferent � her mind shutting down to preserve
  her sanity � and even the appearence on her body of the first fleabites didn't
  register with her at first. She ignored them, as she'd long ignored the flies
  crawling on her body. 
By now she had no idea of how many days had passed, and even in her brief
  moments of lucidity she no longer bothered to try to calculate them; instead,
  like any other animal, she lived passively in the present, minute by minute,
  no longer capable of anticipating her future. 
Chapter 7 
One day around noon she heard a faint, once familiar sound. She raised her
  head and frowned; it was a noise that she seemed to remember; it had some significance
  but she was much too hot and tired to recall it. Instead, she closed her eyes
  and slept, waiting for Towser to return and lead her to water, and the price
  he would exact for it. 
It was earlier than usual when the dog trotted to drink, this time accompanied
  by the older and larger Bravo. His thirst satisfied, Towser walked up to her
  and freed her from the pole. By now he was so convinced of her submissiveness
  that he no longer bothered to hold her by her leash and she turned her back
  on the dogs, lowering her head into the water bowl more intent on slaking her
  terrible thirst than anything the dogs might do to her. 
They left her to drink unmolested, but once she raised her dripping face and
  hair from the bowl, Towser uttered an impatient and minatory little bark. Jane
  listlessly went down upon her elbows and spread her knees apart. Her dog took
  her at once in his usual frenzy, but she stayed passive standing under his
  attentions, and, when he'd withdrawn, she stayed where she was in case Bravo
  required servicing - for that was how she'd come to think of it - too. In the
  event, the bigger dog didn't follow the new pack-leader's example; instead
  he probed Jane's distended vagina with his nose before licking the mixture
  of her's and her dog's fluids from between her thighs. 
Towser led her back to the post and secured her. They stood for several moments
  regarding each other, Jane with weary indifference, he with the pride of ownership.
  Dog though he was, Towser knew that the hard, thin, flexible thing with the
  loop at one end and her collar at the other would keep her from wandering off.
  He had never even approached the degree of sexual satisfaction he'd been getting
  from this bitch, despite her odd shape; and he'd become used to her subtly
  off-putting smell, so often had he covered her. She was quite docile, not snapping
  at him as another bitch might, nor plumping down on her haunches to deny him
  access and obliging him to snarl and snap at her. Now that he had gained the
  unrestricted use of her body when ever he pleased, he had no intention of allowing
  her to wander off. 
Jane lay on the filthy ground, drearily considering her wretched existence;
  continually chained up, her dirt-caked, stinking body a sexual toy for her
  own dog. Weeping to herself quietly and despairingly at the knowledge of what
  she'd become, she sobbed herself to sleep. 
She woke reluctantly; at least in her sleep she wasn't constantly confronted
  with her degradation, and stared vacantly out across the yard. It was late
  afternoon, and her stomach rumbled in anticipation of the few scraps the dogs
  would leave for her after they'd eaten. But it was yet too early, and neither
  dog was in sight when she rose to all-fours and emptied her bladder. She lay
  down again, her right paw supporting her head, and her left outflung upon the
  ground. Focussing idly upon her left mitt, she pondered once more on how restricted
  the mitts made her human hands; wearing them, she was no more than an animal.
  A fly landed upon her wrist-cuff and she stared at absently. The memory of
  the sound she'd heard that morning surfaced in her mind. She frowned once more,
  idly watching the fly probe a hairline crack between the leather-cover steel
  surrounding her wrist. Then she stiffened in shock as the significance of combination
  of the crack and the faint clicks of the morning fully struck home. Scarcely
  daring to hope, she wriggled her wrist inside its imprisoning cuff. Did she
  deceive herself, or was there more play around her wrist. Slowly she rose and
  sat on her haunches. Bringing her left wrist up to her eyes, she examined it
  closely. It was true, the mitt was open - she was free at last! 
She carefully placed her left paw on the ground by the side of her right,
  and sat for long minutes in a daze, entirely unable to believe that her ordeal
  might be at an end. Eventually she lifted her paw again, tucked it between
  her upper right arm and her ribs, and pulled hard. Her left mitt came off with
  a faint - perhaps imaginary - whoosh and she held her freed hand up and examined
  it unbelievingly. 
Finally she summoned up her courage. After glancing furtively around for any
  sight of her gaolers, and without even bothering to remove her right-hand cuff,
  she lifted her leash over the post and scurried to the kitchen door on all-fours.
  With an effort she stood upright for the first time for more than a month.
  Grasping dizzily at the door frame for support, she took down the key she'd
  hung up so many days ago and unlocked the kitchen door. Stumbling through into
  the stale-smelling kitchen, she hurriedly closed and locked the door behind
  her in delirious, ludicrous terror that, even at this moment, the dogs might
  come running up to herd her out into the yard and tether her to the post again.
  Dropping to all-fours, she scrambled over the hard, tiled floor and butted
  her head against the half-open door of her downstairs bathroom. She had to
  stand, clinging to the wall, to turn on the shower, but she reverted to all-fours
  once more as the warm, clean water battered her body. Pulling off her remaining
  mitt in one frantic gesture, she hurled it from her into a corner of the room.
  There was a full bottle of shampoo on a tiny stand near the floor, and she
  poured it all over herself, rubbing it well into the dirt on her body. She
  had used it all before the water gurgling down the drain had begun to run clear,
  and she was obliged to crawl, dripping wet and shivering, out into the kitchen
  where she took a plastic bottle of liquid soap from the cupboard below the
  sink and returned to the shower. By now she was able to stand again, though
  the muscles and small bones of her spine were protesting against having to
  carry the weight of her upper body after so long on all-fours.Finally she towelled
  herself dry, and steeled herself to look into the huge wall-mirror. She was
  surprised to see herself so little altered by her experience; though her face
  was tired and drawn, and her ribs were more prominent than before, and she
  found from the bathroom scales that she had lost twelve pounds in weight. 
Slipping on sandals, she peered out of the window before venturing outside.
  But it was well past eight o'clock, and the dogs had long gone to their shed.
  Still supporting herself with a hand against the wall against a fall, she made
  her slow way along the porch to the stinking corner where she'd spent so many
  daylight hours. Her collar was still around her neck and her leash still dangled
  fom it so used was she to their presence, and she shivered with terror as she
  looked down at the post where it stood among the filth covering the ground.
  For one mad moment she imagined herself placing the loop of her leash over
  the post again, and refitting her mitts in order to volountarily re-enter her
  captivity. She shivered in the suddenly cool air; so long had she been without
  clothing that she hadn't even realised she was still naked. 
Returning to the kitchen, she locked the door firmly behind her and put on
  the kettle for tea. She sat long over it, taking it milkless for she had no
  fresh provisions in the house. After injecting herself with the antidate to
  the peculiar body odour which had so successfully disguised her own, she felt
  totally drained. Despite her hunger, she went to bed. After only a few minutes
  of trying to get comfortable under the covers on the soft mattress, she climbed
  out of her bed and lay naked on the floor. There she fell asleep, still wearing
  her collar and leash. 
She slept the sleep of the dead, and it was only her hunger which drove her
  downstairs in the mid-morning of the next day. She drank milkless tea, then
  heated a tin of soup and ate it with cheese and crackers. The air in the kitchen
  was warm and close, and, once more, she didn't realise that she was naked.
  Previously, except for her ventures into Self-Bondage, Jane had hardly ever
  been naked except in the privacy of her own bathroom, even putting on a bathrobe
  to walk the few feet into her bedroom to dress. She showered again, this time
  standing upright, and, when she felt brave enough, she peeped out the kitchen
  window into the yard to catch sight of the dogs. Bravo was lying in his usual
  position near the feeding and water bowls; of Towser there was no sign. Jane
  shivered; sooner or later she'd have to face them both and hope that they remembered
  her only as a human being and their Mistress. But not yet; she just lacked
  the moral courage to look them in the eye. 
For three days she moped around the house, at last summoning up the will-power
  to remove her collar but unwilling to venture outside. Finally she pulled herself
  together, telling herself sharply that this wouldn't do at all; she needed
  fresh food, and she couldn't stay in here for ever - for one thing she had
  to return Bravo to his owner. 
The next day she rose early, showered, and dressed for the first time since
  she'd slipped out of her nightdress on that fateful morning in her kitchen.
  She chose her clothing carefully, electing to wear her oldest dress and sandals
  on the grounds that they would the deepest imbued with her unique personal
  scents. No pains must be spared to assure the dogs that their Mistress was
  indeed returned. She practised speaking, at first not realising that the little
  plastic gag was still in her mouth, she who had been dumb for so long, until
  she could snap out the words of command with authority, for she knew that self-assurance
  was essential when dealing with the dogs. 
She went out into the yard just as the dogs finished eating from the still
  functioning automatic feeder. They spotted her at once and bounded towards
  her from thirty feet away, delighted to see their pack leader again. Bravo
  was the first to reach her. At her feet he paused to look up at her, dim puzzlement
  in his brown eyes. He bent his head and sniffed her feet thoroughly before
  raising his nose to sniff the hem of her dress. Jane leaned down a little and
  scratched his head roughly, all the time talking softly to him. He seemed satisfied
  with her identity for the moment, and Jane put down his confusion to her long
  absence. She raised her eyes to see Towser stationary a few yards away. He
  was coming to her from downwind, and he, too, seemed confused and uncertain;
  so much so that she distinctly saw the look of joy and devotion in his eyes
  change to puzzled suspicion. Carefully, Towser came to his feet and walked
  stiff-legged towards her. &quot;Here, boy!&quot; snapped Jane, and she was
  relieved to see the dog's head come up automatically in response to her familiar
  voice. 
He came doubtfully to her feet and imitated the larger dog in investigating
  her various scents. Her went further,and, while Jane stood patiently still,
  her dog sniffed her crotch through the thin cloth of her sole garment both
  at her front and rear before withdrawing a few feet to sit and look at her
  thoughtfully. Jane watched him in fascination, wondering what thoughts were
  going through his doggy mind. Whatever his thoughts, he seemed to conclude
  them after a few minutes, for he sat upright and stared his Mistress full in
  the eyes. Jane met his stare steadily before shame and guilt made her drop
  her gaze. &quot;He knows!&quot; she thought wretchedly. &quot;He knows that
  I'm the same creature he was keeping on tethered for his sexual pleasure just
  a few days ago. HE KNOWS!&quot; 
Towser gave a little shake of his head, looking vaguely pleased with himself
  as if he'd won a small victory, before trotting back to Jane where he allowed

  her to fondle his ears just as he normally would, but Jane had the feeling
  that something had subtly changed in their relationship. 
After a doubtful glance at her dog, she stripped naked as she usually did
  to wash the dogs, washing them over and over again, until they were quite clean.
  When they were quite dried off, she dusted them with flea-powder, working it
  well into their coats, nor she neglect this precaution for herself. She'd been
  put more at ease by Towser's behaviour throughout this procedure; he'd been
  quite as normal, and when she'd ushered Bravo into the barred-off rear of her
  Land Rover, she called out to Towser to come to her. Confining him any longer
  in the filthy shed where he and Bravo had been forced to sleep was not necessary
  now, and she decided to shut him up in his old kennel while she went to take
  Bravo home to his owner. He would enjoy it, she thought; the kennel was large,
  warm and weather-proof, with thick layers of old carpet for him to lie on.
  Best of all, it had a chain and an electrically operated sliding door of thick
  steel bars which she'd taught him to operate - well, he could open the door
  from outside by pressing a large floor-mounted button with a front paw, but
  was then unable to reach it to let himself out. Pleased with her notion, for
  she was secretly a little worried by his new attitude and she would feel a
  lot easier in her mind if he was safely confined, she led the way to where
  the kennel stood in a sunny corner of the inner yard facing East. 
Towser accompanied her readily enough, or so she thought, but when she stooped
  and picked up the end of his chain he was no longer with her. She turned and
  saw him sitting watching her from ten feet away. She called him to her again
  and again, but he merely stared back at her defiantly. Angrily, Jane strode
  over to him and bent to grasp him by his collar. He growled and bared his teeth,
  and she straightened up in astonishment tinged with fear. Looking down at him,
  she saw a yellow glare die in his eyes before he stood deliberately and walked
  away from her. Tentatively, she called him back, but he seemed to ignore her,
  and, apart turning for a moment to favour her with a dismissive stare, he walked
  off into the small field and out across the moor. 
At a loss, and with a certain fear, his Mistress stared after him for several
  moments. Then she remembered Bravo, and got into her Land Rover to drive away. 
Such was the novelty of seeing and talking to other people after so long,
  and of being welcomed and thanked by Bravo's owner, that she quite forgot her
  own dog's odd behaviour. It was only after she'd finished shopping for fresh
  food in the neighbouring village, and arranged for her usual weekly order,
  along with her post, to be delivered every week as usual, that she began to
  consider her options on the six-mile drive home. She was becoming more and
  more concerned with what she recalled of his manner as he'd walked away from
  her. He'd disobeyed such orders in the past - as all dogs did occasionally
  - and, like them, he had slunk off guiltily trying hard to give her the impression
  that he'd not heard her orders. But not this time; this time he'd shown deliberate
  defiance of her. Still wondering how to deal with him, she drove into the barn
  and locked the big doors behind her. 
To her surprise, when she came from the barn with her shopping, Towser was
  waiting for her across the yard by the kitchen door. He followed her into the
  kitchen as he usually did, and all seemed normal as she began to put away her
  provisions, but, looking back on events later, she recognised that it was when
  she bent to put the fresh milk in her refrigerator that the new regime could
  be said to have begun. 
From behind her she felt Towser's nose prodding her violently between her
  buttocks. She gave a little squeal of shock and outrage and rounded on him
  angrily. &quot;You bad, bad dog!&quot; she shouted at him, raising a hand to
  cuff him on the head. The dog's response to her threat was immediate. Jane
  shrank back as he growled menacingly and bared his teeth, the yellow light
  flaring in his eyes. Stiff-legged, he moved slowly towards her, his growl deepening
  and becoming louder. She stumbled back into a corner of the room, her own eyes
  wide with surprise and fear. With his Mistress trapped in the corner, Towser
  sat and stared up at her for a moment. Then, with a loud growl, he sprang at
  her waist, seized her dress in his teeth, and snatched at it violently. The
  thin shoulder-straps dug painfully into Jane's flesh before they parted and
  the flimsy fabric fell about her bare ankles. Shocked beyond measure by this
  incident, she automatically reached down to pull on her torn dress. Towser
  growled again, following it by a deafening bark of menace and warning. Jane
  straightened and looked at her angry dog in terror, but, after only a few seconds,
  he turned away and went to lie on his old blanket by the Aga from where he
  stared steadily at her. 
Jane stood in indecision. She dared not pick up her dress to cover her nakedness,
  and she had no notion of what behaviour the dog - in his apparent madness,
  would tolerate from her. Raising her head, she glanced at his reclining figure
  with apprehension. He looked exactly as normal. He wasn't frothing at the mouth
  or anything of the sort, and when her gaze met his, he looked at her quite
  sanely before she dropped her eyes. She sensed rather than saw a self-satisfied
  little shake of his head following this exchange of looks, as if he'd proved
  something to himself. This was the second time she'd felt obliged to avoid
  his steady gaze, and he seemed to be drawing certain conclusions from the events. 
Tired of standing motionless in her corner, she took a tentative step out
  of the crumpled dress at her feet and away from the wall. At once Towser rose
  to sit before the Aga and watch her attentively. She froze, but when the dog
  remained still, she came a few feet further towards the centre of the room. 
Towser leapt at her without warning, knocking her from her feet. She landed
  heavily on the tiled floor of the kitchen, banging her head painfully against
  the wall in her fall. She lay there semi-stunned, bright lights floating before
  her closed eyes. Groaning, she raised her lids to see Towser standing over
  her. Seemingly relieved at these signs of continuing life, the dog withdrew
  a few feet to lie down on its belly and regard her, his powerful hindlegs coiled
  ready for instant action. 
Jane repeated her groan, then lifted a hand to gingerly feel her aching head.
  Her side where she'd landed hurt too, and she rolled over to massage it. Finally
  she made to get up to her feet, keeping an anxious eye on the dog as she did
  so. She came to all-fours without incident, but when she attempted to rise
  further Towser growled at her and bared his long, sharp teeth in warning. This
  was a nightmare, Jane thought, when tentative experiments had discovered those
  postures the dog would allow her and those he would not. She was allowed to
  lie down, to stand on all fours, and to sit upright in the best approximation
  of a dog she could manage, but any other configuration of her body was forbidden
  her, especially rising to her feet. By the end of her 'training' by her dog;
  when he was finally satisfied that the limits of permitted postures had been
  learnt by her, she was standing on all-fours by where he lay on his blanket. 
Jane was at a loss what to do. The tiles were uncomfortably hard under her
  knees, and she looked with longing at the comfortable, padded kitchen chair
  a few feet away. In the end, she crawled slowly and fearfully on to Towser's
  blanket, halting every few inches to test his reactions. Much to her relief,
  he seemed to have no objection to sharing his blanket with her; he even seemed
  to expect it, for he obligingly moved to make room for her at his side when
  she ventured to lie down. 
It was much more comfortable with the thick, smelly blanket between her skin
  and the tiled floor, and, in the quiet companionship of her dog, Jane could
  even imagine that they were together in her living room before the fire in
  the evening as they so often had been in the past. She considered her position
  carefully. Escape from her dog's presence seemed impossible. Of the three doors
  out of the room, only the one to the outside was a little ajar, while the other
  two, entrances to the ground-floor bathroom and the to the rest of her house
  were firmly closed, and she already suspected that Towser would forcibly prevent
  her from trying to open them and get out of his reach. She was bruised from
  her fall, but the ache in her head had subsided. Worst of all, she was hungry
  - for she'd eaten nothing that day except a slice of cake offered by Bravo's
  owner. And she was terribly thirsty! With that thought came a ray of hope which
  grew in intensity as she fully grasped the simple solution to her present problem.
  Sooner or later Towser would be thirsty too. He was still being fed and watered
  automatically, and he would have to go outside to drink. Then she would be
  alone; then she could rise to her feet, open the door to the interior, and
  close it safely behind her. A few minutes on the telephone, and men with guns
  would take care of Towser for good. Before that time, he may even need to leave
  to relieve himself; thinking of which reminded her that her own bladder was
  growing uncomfortably full. Waiting for her chance, she mused on what had triggered
  Towser's strange behaviour since her release. She began to suspect that the
  antidote to the body-scent which she'd injected while she'd trained the dogs
  to treat her as an animal had not worked properly. Recalling Towser's, and,
  to a lesser extent, Bravo's, ambivalent attitude towards her earlier that day
  turned supicion into certainty. Towser, she now clearly realised, had firmly
  decided that she was still the odd-looking bitch whose body he'd enjoyed so
  much when he'd had her at his disposal, and he meant to repeat the experience.
  He was used to her naked and on all-fours, and that was why he'd pulled her
  dress from her body and forbade her to rise to her feet. But she'd forgotten
  that Towser was accustomed to something more about her appearance, and that
  was to be the cause of her continuing degradation. Her dog had not forgotten.
  Rising suddenly, he bent his head and nipped Jane painfully on her upper arm
  before walking off a few feet and turning to look back at her in peremptory
  summons. Blinking away tears of pain, Jane rose and followed the dog to a low
  cupboard. He nosed at the latch, then turned to her with a yelp of command.
  Obviously he wanted her to open the cupboard and she did so. Immediately he
  shouldered her aside and pulled out with his teeth the large plastic oddment-box
  in which she kept her self-bondage equipment. It scraped across the floor to
  a halt and the dog thrust his head inside to emerge with the old collar Jane
  had stolen from the Spaniel still with the short chain-leash attached to it.
  Dropping it next to her, he drew back and growled at her. As if in a dreadful
  dream, Jane picked up the collar, sat, and buckled it around her neck with
  trembling fingers. Then Towser sat and raised a paw to his own collar, scratching
  at it and growling, his eyes fixed on hers. As if under a spell, she raised
  shaking hands to his collar and clumsily unbuckled it. It fell from around
  his neck to the floor, and he bent his head, picked it up in his mouth and
  dropped it into the box. Jane came to all-fours, the loop on the leash dangling
  to the floor and Towser lost no time in darting forward and picking it up in
  his powerful jaws. 
He tugged hard on her leash just as he'd been doing several days ago, and
  she followed him docilely just as she had done then. It was like a horrible
  repeat performance of a nightmare to Jane as she sat helplessly at the dog's
  side while he lapped noisily with her leash trapped under his heavy paw. He
  allowed her to drink when he'd finished, and while doing so she began to hope
  that he'd loop her leash over the low pole in the corner of the yard as he'd
  been used to. Then, once he'd gone out of sight, she would lift off the loop
  and escape to the house. It was with a feeling of hopeful anticipation that
  she raised her head and sent her wet hair swirling about her face to dislodge
  the drops of water which clung to it. 
Towser seized the end of her leash and led her off, but not to the pole a
  few yards away, as she'd hoped. Instead, her dog trotted off across the yard
  and into the smaller one beyond it with Jane scrambling breathlessly at his
  side. They passed the evil-smelling little shed she and the dogs had slept
  in and stopped when Towser reached the corner where his old kennel stood. It
  seemed that the intention Jane had had earlier of keeping him there had jogged
  Towser's memory of previous captivities, and the first thing he did was to
  scrabble at the end of the chain lying in the dust with the obvious intention
  that Jane should pick it up and clip it to her collar. She obeyed with that
  feeling of being in a nightmare which was becoming so familiar, and Towser
  pulled on her leash, indicating that he wanted her to remove it. Fumbling with
  its spring-clip, she did so and laid it on the ground, upon which Towser placed
  a heavy paw on the large floor-mounted button which controlled the barred door
  of the kennel. It was obvious what he meant her to do, and Jane obeyed meekly
  as he barked at her to enter the kennel. The descending door brushed her toes
  as she went in, and she turned to see Towser trotting away, her leash dangling
  from his jaws. In a daze of incomprehension, she lay down on the floor of the
  kennel and, unbelievably, fell into a deep sleep. 
Waking later, for a moment she wondered where she was on seeing the bars a
  few inches from her eyes. When her memories came back, she realised that she
  was trapped in the barred kennel, and for a moment she felt real fear. Then
  she calmed down. Towser had only put her in here to keep her from escaping
  while he was away; when he returned he'd know that she'd want feeding and access
  to water. But, she thought gloomily, he might not release her until he himself
  was fed, and that wouldn't be for hours yet. Worst of all, it suddenly ocurred
  to her that the dog might not return at all; he might be prevented by accident
  or sudden illness. Then, she realised in terror, she would be trapped behind
  the bars of the kennel to die of thirst. That possibility had concerned her
  previously, but then she'd had two dogs to look after her in her self-imposed
  helplessness. But now, if Towser was to die, or to be injured, or even simply
  forget about her, she would suffer a painful death. She shivered at the prospect,
  then resolutely turned her attention back to escaping her dog's attentions.
  She wondered why, if her attraction as a captive sexual partner had been the
  spring of Towser's behaviour, he hadn't yet taken advantage of her in that
  manner, but found no answer except a vague suspicion that maybe his sexual
  urges needed to be first triggered by the faint scent of canine females on
  heat somewhere on the moor. Then she realised with a dismal groan that she'd
  neglected the opportunity to empty her bladder when she'd been led out to drink.
  Now there was no help for it, and she relieved herself on her already smelly
  bedding in a corner of the kennel before lying down listlessly to wait for
  her dog to release her. 
Over the next few days she slipped imperceptibly back into her old condition;
  the submissive and docile inferior in the little pack of two. Although she
  could easily have done so, she lacked the spirit to unclip her chain or take
  off her collar when shut up in her kennel, Just as before, when she'd been
  kept tethered to the pole in the yard, the dog released her only to lead her
  to be fed on his leavings and drink from his bowl morning and evening. A tiny
  flame of rebellion still flickered, but it diminished daily as her condition
  became to seem natural to her. In vain she told herself that she didn't have
  to endure this, that she was a human being with the faculty of speech and an
  opposable thumb, that she could do things impossible to even the brightest
  animal. Her dog's will controlled her own with such contemptuous ease that
  he no longer bothered to threaten her to enforce her obedience. So complete
  was his dominance over her that he tethered her to the pole in the yard, where
  she'd spent so many weary hours in the past, and left her within easy reach
  of the kitchen door and her freedom. With the pain circuits in her collar no
  longer active and her fingers free, she could have easily gained the house
  while he was away. But she didn't even attempt it, so deeply ingrained had
  the habit of obedience to her dog become, and so terrified she was of the minute
  chance of being discoved by him free from where he'd tethered her. 
A few days passed, and what she'd been dreading occurred. Early one afternoon,
  while the noon heat still lingered, Jane was dozing behind the bars of her
  kennel when Towser's arrival awoke her. She lay and gazed at him blearily as
  he put down a determined paw on the button which controlled her kennel's door.
  Even before it was fully risen, the dog seized her chain in his jaws and tugged
  at it urgently. This was the usual prelude to her being led off to eat and
  drink, but it was far too early, and Towser hadn't taken down the leash he
  would make her wear to be led by from its hook on the nearby wall. 
She obeyed the tugs on her chain, emerging from her kennel into the hot, still
  air. Towser, seemingly impatient with her progress, dropped her chain and sank
  his teeth around her collar, painfully nipping the flesh of her neck as he
  did so. He dragged her as far as her chain would allow before pulling her around
  so that she faced the entrance to her kennel. Then he let go of her collar
  and moved behind her to sniff urgently at her cleft. Jane knew what her dog
  intended, she had seen his state of sexual excitement all too often before,
  with his member extended and stiff and a drop of semen glistening at its tip.
  In response to an impatient bark from behind her, she went down obediently
  on her elbows. Her rump in the air, she shuffled her knees apart and waited
  meekly. 
Towser took her swiftly and brutally. She gasped in shock and pain as his
  front paws landed hard on her shoulder blades before slipping around her neck
  to grasp it tightly. The weight of his hairy chest and belly fell upon her
  back, and she felt the tip of his penis probing urgently at the lips of her
  vagina, already slippery with her own fluids as her own body betrayed her.
  She gasped again when he entered her, then she responded as - shamefully -
  she always did, grinding the backs of her thighs against the hot, shaggy front
  of her dog's, frenziedly willing him to probe into her deeper and deeper. Then
  she felt the heat of his sperm as he ejaculated deep inside her, his deflation,
  and his slow, panting, withdrawal. 
Towser lay for a moment, his full weight upon her back, before going up on
  his hindlegs and slipping off her to lie panting on the ground at her side
  while she slowly keeled over to lie facing him. They lay there with eyes closed,
  their chests rising and falling in unison, for several minutes. Towser finally
  stirred. Opening his eyes, he stared at Jane before licking her hot and sweaty
  face roughly. She opened her own eyes at this and stared upwards into those
  of her dog for a moment before lowering her gaze in submission. He made a little
  noise of satisfaction deep in his throat, then walked behind her prone body
  and nipped her gently on the calf of her left leg. Taking this as a signal,
  she pulled her knees up to her belly and rose to all-fours whereupon another,
  more painful nip, ordered her into her kennel. A few seconds later, she was
  standing at the bars watching the dog walked slowly away, complacent self-satisfaction
  oozing from every pore. 
Jnae found herself crying, the hot tears falling straight down to splash upon
  the her filthy bedding. Her upper arms and shoulders ached from bearing Towser's
  weight, her shoulder blades stung from the scratches his growing claws had
  inflicted, and she could sense the slow seeping of the dog's semen from her
  vagina to join the mixture of their joint fluids dampening her inner thighs.
  She tood unmoving, weeping in helpless misery and despair, for a long time
  before she went down on the damp, smelly bedding and lay there staring hopelessly
  outwards through the bars of her prison. 
In the days after this first assault, Jane, her spirit broken, reverted entirely
  to the submissive animal she'd been previously. Towser, as if scenting his
  total control over her, even allowed her to follow him to be fed holding the
  loop of her leash in her mouth as she'd been trained to do, and, in order to
  slake his sexual appetite faster, he no longer shut her in her kennel in the
  daylight hours, but allowed her the limited freedom of the chain she could
  have so easily removed, only appearing now and then as if to check up on her. 
He took her twice more, on alternative days, then left her outside all kennel
  one morning unsupervised all day until long past her normal evening feeding
  time. When he returned, just before darkness fell, he had a companion. 
Jane had little opportunity for observation, for Towser shut her in her kennel
  immediately, and she was too busy sobbing in disappointment at not being fed
  that she forgot to watch the two dogs disappear into the darkening evening. 
At first light the dogs returned from wherever they'd spent the night. Again
  Jane was denied an opportunity for observation as her dog raised the door of
  her kennel and dragged her out by her chain. Once she was clear of the kennel,
  he stood by her side, holding her chain in his mouth while his companion sniffed
  Jan's body all over with its cold, damp nose. It withdrew at last, and Towser
  dropped her chain from his jaws. Jane, with some vague idea of reassuring the
  strange dog of her complete submission, lay down on her side and rolled over
  onto her back with her head turned away from it and her vulnerable genitals,
  belly and throat exposed to its teeth. This appeared to have been the correct
  reponse, for the strange dog, visibly relaxed, gave a whine of satisfaction
  before resuming its examination of Jane's body, concluding it with a gentle
  nip on Jane's thigh in token of her inferior position in the new and larger
  pack. 
The dogs stood side by side, looking down at her where she lay at their feet
  on the cold, hard ground. At last Jane could see the stranger clearly. A bitch
  past her youth, tall and rangy, her coat long and matted with neglect, she
  was the usual moorland cross of sheepdog and any village dog big enough and
  brave enough to roam the moor in search of a mate. She wore no collar; obviously
  she was one of the feral dogs who lived on the moor the year around, in constant
  danger of being shot by the shepherds in charge of the scattered flocks of
  sheep. 
Towser fetched her leash from the hook on the wall where he hung it and laid
  it before her; his signal that she was to attach it to her collar and remove
  her chain. When she'd done so, the dog barked softly at the strange bitch and
  she bent to pick up Jane's short chain-leash. She tugged at it, and Jane followed
  obediently in her wake as she walked with Towser back to where their food and
  water dishes waited. 

Jane slipped easily into her position in the larger pack - that of the inferior,
  the last to feed. But there were changes, too. Towser, now apparently convinced
  of his ex-Mistress's tameness, and now with the help of the bitch to control
  her, gradually allowed her more and more freedom of movement. He even allowed
  her to stand upright now and then, especially to take in the provisions that
  were delivered weekly and left in the little shed at the head of the track
  just outside the tall locked doors of the main yard. He and the bitch would
  eat all the meat in an orgy of feasting, leaving Jane to eat the rest. It never
  occurred to her, when she heard her grocer's little van stop outside the yard,
  to shout for help - and, perhaps, even it had, she no longer had the will-power
  to defy her dog. 
She was no longer shut up on her kennel at night; instead she was permitted
  to share Tower's blanket in the kitchen along with the bitch. The kitchen itself
  was in a filthy condition, mud and dirt tracked in by the dogs covered the
  floor, and the body-odour of the unwashed dogs - along with Jane's own rank
  smell - competed with that of the vegetables rotting in their racks. But it
  was better than her kennel, and warmer too as Autumn approached. 
While the bitch was on heat Towser took them both indiscriminately, as and
  when he chose, but when she came off he no longer pestered Jane - indeed, he
  largely ignored her except when she'd inadvertently show some sign of independent
  action. Then he would growl and snap at her - the bitch too - and she would
  grovel at their feet in terror, dreading that they'd return her to her kennel.
  Occasionally a small inner voice would scream in outrage at her degradation.
  Of the three, she was the only one collared. At nights she slept in the coldest
  place, on the outside of the little huddled of fur and flesh, and she went
  hungry when the automatically supplied food - deliberately designed not to
  be quite sufficient to feed three animals - was mostly eaten by the dogs. But
  she was now too broken to care, and the little inner voice would fade into
  silence. 
Then things changed for ever, although it was unrecognised at the time. One
  cold, sunny morning the bitch ran off as usual across the field and onto the
  moor on another of the dogs' daily errands of exploration. She didn't return;
  neither that day, nor the day after. Towser whined and whimpered, spending
  long hours staring out across the moor in search of his canine companion. But
  she didn't come back. One morning a few days later, after he'd eaten and Jane
  had been fed, he took her leash and dropped its loop over the top of the low
  post in a corner of the yard. Then he trotted off, stopping and turning before
  he entered the field to see Jane on all-fours leashed to her post. Apparently
  satisfied of her captivity, he ran though the field and onto the moor. 
Jnae sat back on her haunches, the ground cold beneath her, and watched the
  tiny figure of her dog melt away into the distant bluey-green of the moor.
  She yawned and stood to give a token tug on her tether, then lay down in the
  cool sunlight. Long afterwards she would marvel at her failure to take advantage
  of his absence to free herself, now she merely lay in the dirt patiently waiting
  to be released. Later she rose and emptied both her bowels and her bladder
  in the familiar places before lying down again. 
She woke from a doze with a shiver. The afternoon was far advanced, and the
  sun had moved on and sunk lower in the sky. It was chilly, and she longed for
  Towser's return. The shadows implacably lengthened, and the cold in the still
  air increased. Food rumbled down the chute into the empty bowl, and Jane's
  stomach growled in hunger. Still she lay there, now curled up against the cold,
  and still Towser didn't come. 
The night air was bitter, with a full moon flooding the yard with its bleak
  light and silvering Jane's shaking body where it lay under the cold stars.
  When the sky finally paled and the cold was at its most intense, Jane rose
  to squat, her urine steaming in the icy air. She sat, her eyes fixed upon the
  Eastern horizon for the first sign of the rising sun. 
Wakened from a doze in the faint warmth of the sun by the rumble of more food
  down the chute, she whimpered, tugging on her leash in an attempt to break
  free. There was still no sign of her dog, and she had come to dread her punishment
  should she free herself and be discovered. But finally she had no choice, and
  it was her thirst rather than her hunger which finally over-rode her conditioning.
  Kneeling, she regarded her roughened, dirty hands with their cracked skin and
  black fingernails. After a final hesitation, and not daring either to remove
  her collar or detach her leash, she gently lifted the loop over the top of
  the post and let it trail on the ground. 
She looked around her timidly, every sense alert for the return of either
  of the dogs, before slinking away for food and water. 
She drank first, her long, filthy hair trailing in the water, before she turned
  her attention to the food dish, now heaped high with two uneaten rations. After
  many seconds hesitation, all the time raising her head in fear of the dogs,
  she overcame her training and ate, noisily and hastily. Without even bothering
  to try to wipe the smears of food from her face with her forearm, she scuttled
  back to the post and secured her leash to it with a sigh of relief. Then she
  waited once more. 
Noon had come and gone, but Towser had not come back to her. The evening food
  appeared in the dish, and this time Jane didn't hesitate for long before slipping
  her leash from the post and going to eat. Afterwards, whether it was the effect
  of being able to fill her belly on two successive occasions, or her freedom
  from supervision for so many hours, or even some unconscious premonition that
  another night spent in the open air might kill her, she butted open the kitchen
  door with her head and went inside to lie on Towser's blanket. 
She stayed there all night. It was as cold in the kitchen as in the yard for
  the first few hours, nor did she think of wrapping the smelly blanket around
  her - least of all of standing up, going upstairs, and getting under the thick
  covers of her bed - but she was rescued by the operation of her central heating
  system, switching on in faithful obedience to a command programmed several
  months before. 
Jane woke to unexpected and luxuriant warmth despite the partly-closed kitchen
  door. (She hadn't closed it, fearing, like the dogs, that she would be trapped
  in the kitchen - a measure of her conditioning.) She went outside to relieve
  herself, shivering in the cold dawn air. She drank, then went to her post and
  tethered herself, continually looking guiltily about her. When she heard the
  noise of her food arriving, she loosed herself and went to eat. Back at her
  post, she resumed her weary vigil. 
That day passed like the previous one, and she slept in the kitchen as she'd
  done the night before. But, midway through the next morning, she came out of
  a doze on the hard ground by her post. She relieved herself, then began to
  pace up and down restlessly on her short tether. Slowly and imperceptibly,
  the impression solidified in her confused and muddled mind that Towser wasn't
  coming back, ever again. She stood there on all-fours for long minutes while
  her slow brain grappled with this proposition before she lifted the loop on
  her leash over the post. Trembling with fear, she walked into the kitchen. 
She stayed in there for the next five days, only emerging to eat and drink
  and to empty her bladder and bowels and to carry in the weekly provisions delivery,
  the meat of which she put aside for the dogs. Slowly, she began to regain her
  human independence of action with a series of small victories, the first of
  which was to detach her leash. A day later, she stood up and closed the kitchen
  door - though she panicked immediately, and fumbled at its latch for sveral
  seconds before she succeeded in opening it - then she graduated to drinking
  from the tap in the kitchen, filling Towser's old plastic dog bowl and setting
  on the dirty floor. Food was next - but not before she'd been forced to it,
  for the supply of automatically supplied food ran out at last. For several
  days she lived on tins of cold soup and stew, eaten from Towser's bowl on the
  floor, at first with her face buried in it, later using a dirty spoon she found
  by the kitchen sink where it had been dropped and forgotten long ago. 
Finally came the greatest victory so far - she opened the door to her downstairs
  bathroom and went in. After some time examining the fittings of her shower,
  her rusty brain working slowly, she entered the glass cubicle and turned on
  the water, gasping as the cold water struck her skin. It was several seconds
  before she remembered how to make the water run hot, and several more before
  she'd worked out the use of the cake of scented soap and the plastic bottle
  of shampoo which stood on a narrow shelf on the wall. 
Her thought processes becoming smoother and faster by the minute, helped by
  the reappearance of her own familiar smell, she automatically towelled herself
  dry before she went back into the kitchen. After a slight relapse in which
  she glanced fearfully around for Towser she relaxed. So improved was her mental
  condition that she washed the kitchen floor and removed the remains of the
  rotting vegetables from their racks, then, for the first time, she made tea
  and drank it from a cup sitting at the table. 
Faster and faster she regained normality; though she continued to sleep upon
  Towser's blanket for several more nights before she daringly threw it away
  and went to her bedroom again. 
Finally, a month after Towser's disappearance, she was back to normal to outside
  eyes, following her final victory and wearing clothing once more. But she avoided
  dogs ever after, and dropped her eyes in submission whenever they stared at
  her, and she never told anyone about her experiences that Summer. Her collar
  remained around her neck for the rest of her life; she never removed it, knowing
  that it matched the permanent collar around her soul. She shunned BDSM for
  many months until she succumbed at last and was discovered in the act by Carol
  - but that is another story.
