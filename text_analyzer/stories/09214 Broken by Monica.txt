Synopsis:  A dominating teenager makes a classmate her slave






Part 1

When my sexual awakening began in my early teens, I realized that for some reason I wanted girls to be mean to me. This of course was not comfortable or easy. Most of the girls in my class were the direct opposite. They were nice and modest, normal girls. It was difficult to even imagine any of them treating me they way I wanted them to. There were some girls in school who acted kind of bitchy, but I stayed away from them. Being nice and modest myself, and secretly wanting to be dominated, they could much too easily make me look like a wimp, and who knows how far it would go. It felt like social suicide, so instead I just fantasized about them bullying me, which I did frequently.

By the age of sixteen I went on to secondary school, and most of my classmates were new. Some of the girls were very attractive. Monica was not among the first I took notice of. Her looks were more on the average. That is, she had a great, well proportioned body, her bum a little big, but she was one of the shortest girls in class, and her face was not strikingly beautiful like a couple of the other girls were. 

But she soon caught my attention. It was a basketball game. She wasn&#8217;t particularly good, but she played very aggressively. It was an outdoors asphalt court, and she made a guy fall and tear his skin twice. She made no effort to be sorry about it either. 
Later, I helped clearing away some equipment. I was carrying a long pole and turned around to see who was walking behind me, to avoid hitting the person. It was Monica, and I hesitated in my steps enough that the end of the pole touched her tummy. I said �Oops, I&#8216;m sorry� and she answered by putting the pole that she was carrying, which had en end that was sharply pointed, into my ass cheek. I said �Ouch!�, but she went on to stick it into my other cheek. She did it a few more times, hitting my ass with each step as we kept walking and I didn&#8217;t know how to react, but finally managed to say �Would you please stop or you will ruin my shorts�. She giggled and stopped it. I was growing a boner and was relieved to escape the situation without too much embarrassment. 

I soon noticed that Monica would take almost any opportunity to get in clinch with a boy. She was extremely outgoing and confident, and seemed to have no barriers when it came to messing with boys. Most boys were up for this, after all it was physical contact with a good looking girl. Usually the boy would fight back a little, but not too much, as she was physically like half his size. What often caught the boy by surprise was that Monica didn&#8217;t stop. She went on until the boy was defeated. Usually, when the boy would try to pull out because it was getting too aggressive, she would push it further by pulling his hair, or twisting his fingers, a special trick of hers, so hard that he would have to give in or fight back for real, which would be too embarrassing and childish. After all, she was a girl and he was a boy. Then, while holding onto his hair or fingers, she would make him kneel or lay down so she could sit on him. This could go on for several minutes before she let him go. Sometimes there was an �issue�, like if the boy had not yet paid back the dollar he borrowed from her friend the day before. She would make him give her the money or swear to pay it back. She more or less made something up that he would confess to be sorry for. The more cocky the guy was, the more she would prolong the torment, not stopping until his confident smile was gone and his face was red. This behaviour eventually scared boys away from her. Still, some where cocky or stupid enough to take her on. Or maybe they were too infatuated with her to stay away. 

I stayed away. Sexually, she was the girl of my dreams and I fantasized about her all the time. In terms of looks she wasn&#8217;t out of my league, I was quite good looking myself. But I was shy and self conscious, and she made such a strong impact on me that I became afraid to talk to her. I was nervous to even watch her too closely, although I loved to see her humiliating boys.
Except for the situation with the pole, she left me alone for a long time. She probably knew that I was shy. She tended to pick boys that were outgoing and who had approached her in the first place. 

Once I saw her do something very harsh to one of her favourite victims. We were all standing outside the school waiting for the bus. Somebody said something and I turned around and saw her. I don&#8217;t know what, if anything, had led up to it, but she was just standing in front of the guy smiling, slapping his face maybe ten times, taking her time between each blow. Unbelievable. He was saying nothing, trying to look back at her while his face was turning red. To me it was almost too much. I wondered if I was the only guy there with an instant boner. 
It was beyond my understanding how the guy managed to put up with it. At the same time it would be my fantasy come true to be in his shoes. 

Later Rita, a girl in my class threw a home alone party. It was far away from where I lived, so I brought a sleeping bag and a lot of booze. I had discovered how alcohol was a good medicine for shyness. Most of the guys from class were there, including Monica. Some had dressed up. At school Monica always dressed casually and girlish, but now she was dressed in a short black skirt, a matching tight fitting top, nylons and high heels. Discreet, perfect make up, and her long, dark and curly hair hanging down. Very posh and mature looking, even more sexy and intimidating looking than usual. It was hard to understand how I had not found her pretty when I first saw her. 

I drank fast and was able to mingle quite well. There were some nice and interesting girls there, but Monica was always in the back of my mind. I was peeking at her from the corner of my eye whenever I was able to. She was talking and flirting in her usual provocative manner. I was hoping for her to make some kind of scene like she usually would. She was drinking cocktails and I expected that to get her into the mood, but for a long time she seemed to hold back. Maybe it was her dressed up, womanly appearance that was preventing her.&nbsp; 
Eventually, by which time people started to get drunk, I noticed from the other end of the room that Monica was grabbing a guy. She was doing the thing with his fingers. It was clearly painful as he bended forwards immediately . She laughingly told him to get on his knees. From that position he was told to quickly finish his beer. Some people were watching, others didn&#8217;t pay much attention. Everybody had seen Monica do things like that before. Some thought it was funny while others found it just childish. To me of course it was highly erotic. While he was downing the beer she apparently pulled harder on his fingers, making him shout out and spill beer on his chin and down his shirt. By now he was probably badly regretting the situation he had gotten himself into. He was cursing, which only gave her an opportunity to be harder on him. �Shut up! Are you cursing in front of a woman? Get down on your back!� Her voice was hard and girlish at the same time. He lay down and she sat on his stomach.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I was afraid of giving myself away by watching the scenario too eagerly, but I was not able to take my eyes off it. It would probably be masturbation material for the next month. Monica still held on to the bended fingers of his one hand with her two small hands.&nbsp; She sat with her feet next to his head. �Take my shoes off!� she commanded. His used his free hand to pull of her stilettos. �Now let me clean this up for you.� she said smilingly. She began rubbing her feet against his face and neck where the beer was spilt. One of my most frequent fantasies was of Monica making me lick her feet in public. I grew hard immediately. The guy was moaning and trying to move his head away to avoid the obvious stink, not to much help. Her firm grip on his fingers prevented him from protesting too much. He had to play along. �My feet are getting wet. I&#8217;ll have to borrow a pair of nylons from Rita.� Monica said. She looked up and her eyes accidentally met mine. It felt like an ice cube tracing up my spine. I must have looked half crazy with both lust and fear. For a split second there was a puzzled look in her eyes. I suppose she had not expected to see a reaction quite like mine, but then she understood, and the provocative look was back in her eyes. �Andrew, come over here!� she actually called out to me! I panicked and just hurried into the next room, pretending not to hear her. I went to the bathroom and stayed there for a long time. I knew there was another bathroom in the house for people to use. I made every effort to stay away from Monica for the rest of the party. At one point she was sitting on a guys lap, seemingly acting nice before she started pinching his nose and cheeks. She then led him by his ear down on all fours beside the table, sitting down on his back while offering a girl his place in the sofa. I couldn&#8217;t stay there. I considered taking a taxi home, but that would be quite expensive. I had brought my sleeping bag in order to avoid spending money on that. The best thing to do was simply to go to sleep. I took my sleeping bag and found a quiet room where somebody was already sleeping on a sofa. There was nowhere to lay down except for the floor, but that would have to do. I was drunk and would pass out soon enough. I fell asleep while jerking off inside the sleeping bag. 


Part 2

I woke up from something tapping on my cheek. I&#8217;m not sure if I first recognized what it was from the smell or the vision, but in a state between sleep and shock I realized that it was a foot pushing against my face. I feared the worst. Sure enough, as I turned to look, behind the feet was Monica, looking down at me, telling me it was time to wake up. She was sitting on the sofa where some guy had been sleeping the night before. Her nylon clad legs were long enough for her feet to reach my head. Next to her on the sofa was the prettiest girl in class, Catherine.&nbsp; 
I had no idea what to say. The shock of the situation, the fear and the hangover combined left me paralysed. In addition I secretly wanted nothing more than to stay right there and worship her feet, like I had done several times in my mind. Her feet were very small, but the smell was stronger and sharper than I had imagined. She was wearing the same clothes as the night before, except for the nylons which were black instead of dark blue. Probably Rita&#8217;s. Her hair was a little untidy. Catherine on the other hand had changed into jeans and a sweater, and her hair was wet from a shower. I didn&#8217;t remember laying down so close to the sofa, I must have moved in my sleep. �What a way to wake up.� Catherine said. �Oh, I think he likes it.� Monica replied. �To have that stench right up his nose? He can&#8217;t possibly like that.� �Well, I think he does. Isn&#8216;t that right, Andrew?� Monica said, rubbing her toes gently on my nose. �No.� I said, trying to not act like a complete fool. �No?!� Monica said. �That&#8217;s rudest thing I&#8217;ve heard all morning!� She quickly got up from the sofa and sat down on top of me. I had my arms against my body inside the sleeping bag, and with her sitting on my stomach I was paralysed physically as well as mentally. Next, her feet were planted on my face, covering it completely. I could neither see nor speak, only smell. The intensity of it was intoxicating. �Are you sure you don&#8217;t like my feet, Andrew? They&#8217;re so small and delicate, don&#8217;t you think?� Monica said teasingly. She lifted one foot so that I could see the sole with my one eye. There was a small run in the nylon. I heard myself try to say yes, but my voice was very low, and her other foot covered most of my mouth. �Did you say yes?� Monica said. She began rubbing her soles up and down my face, making it impossible to say anything understandable. �You&#8217;re so cruel, Monica.� Catherine said. �He was asking for it.� Monica said. �He is occupying our floor space. Did you do that on purpose, Andrew? Did you lay down here because you wanted me to step on you?� �No, no!� I answered. I started to worry that other people in the house could hear us and come into the room. I had no idea what time it was. I was also worried that Catherine might see a bulge on the sleeping bag where my erected dick was. This had to stop somehow. I didn&#8217;t know what to say or do. She had me trapped inside the sleeping bag under her body. Maybe I could shake her off, but that would probably give her more reason to mess me up. The best idea was to indulge as much as I could. �I think you did. You like my feet, don&#8217;t you?� She put her arms under her knees, lifting her legs, tapping her soles rapidly on my face. �Yes!� I said. �I like them. I like them very much!�. �That&#8216;s better. Good boy. Do you also like the way the smell?� �Yes, I do!� �Show me!� She put one foot down with my nose against the spot next to her big toe. �Take a big whiff right there�. I did as she told me. �Jesus Christ�� I heard Catherine say. �Again! Keep on going.� Monica commanded. My head was filled with the intense smell of her sweaty feet. If I had not felt genuinely submissive until then, I was now starting to lose myself. Breathing deeply in and out through my nose, it was like meditating on her female stink. It was crazy how she was humiliating and degrading me for no particular reason, other than her own amusement. I had always been afraid to be caught in a situation like that, where I would reveal my submissive nature. �Tell me how much you like that smell, Andrew.� She lifted her heel from my mouth while keeping her toes on my nose, the ball of her foot resting against my upper lip. �I like it very much. It&#8216;s� great!� I stupidly uttered, unable to describe it any other way. �That&#8216;s not very convincing. You have to come up with something more original, if you want to impress a woman.� �It smells like flowers. Like really beautiful flowers.� I said. I heard Catherine giggle. �You&#8217;re not too good with words, are you?� Monica said. �Well, I&#8217;m gonna let you go for now, on one condition.� she continued. �Yes, whatever you want.� I replied. �Make us breakfast. And it better be good!� �Yes! Of course!� I said, relieved that she wasn&#8217;t demanding anything humiliating. She got off the sleeping bag and sat down on the sofa. I hurried to get up and into the kitchen. Feeling confused, aroused and nervous, I began to look around for food. I had a splitting headache and needed to pee, but I didn&#8217;t dare go to the bathroom until at least I had started to prepare something, in case Monica would check up on me. I put on coffee and decided to make scrambled eggs. It was the best I could do from what was available. I then rushed to the bathroom to relieve and clean myself up a little. Back in the kitchen I started on the eggs. There was no one around. I still had no idea what time it was. Maybe the others had already left the house, or maybe they hadn&#8217;t got up yet? At least Rita who lived there had to be around. I was happy there weren&#8217;t others present to watch Monica subjugate me, it was bad enough with Catherine, but on the other hand, if I was the only boy in the house, Monica had no one else to toy with. I made sure the eggs were perfect. I addition I made the girls each a slice of bread with jam. Along with the coffee I brought it into the room where they were still sitting on the sofa chatting. The table in front of them wasn&#8216;t very big. �Eh, I don&#8216;t know if you want to eat here, or�� �Of course not.� Monica interrupted. �Take it back to the kitchen, stupid.� I did, and they followed after. They sat down at the kitchen table. �Massage my feet. A little reward for you. I know you want to.� Monica said. I sat down under the table and tried to give her a good massage while they were eating. Maybe the rubbing and stroking released more of the odour, because after a while Catherine remarked: �Gosh, I think I can actually smell your feet from here. It can&#8217;t be mine, cause I had a shower. Or maybe it&#8217;s Andrew&#8217;s.� �Could be.� Monica said. She continued, pointing under the table. �Andrew, lay down on your back with your head here and&nbsp; your feet in that direction away from us�. I lay down with my head in front of her chair, her feet right above me. All I could see was feet and legs encased in dark nylon. I kept on massaging. Monica stuck her other foot into my mouth, wiggling her toes against my tongue. �I do feel sweaty, though.� Monica told Catherine. �I fell asleep while making out with Morgan.� �Oh, he&#8217;s hot.� Catherine said. �Yeah, kind of. Well anyway, I should take a shower, but I didn&#8217;t bring any clothes.� �Maybe you could borrow some from Rita� Catherine said. �Maybe. She&#8217;s not my size, though. And I already borrowed the pantyhose.� Monica said. �Anyway, we&#8217;re leaving soon, aren&#8217;t we?� �Yeah, I don&#8217;t know how, though.� Catherine said. �Is there a bus stop around here?� �I don&#8217;t know. We could take a cab.� Monica said. �It&#8217;s a bit expensive, isn&#8216;t it?� Catherine said. �Andrew could pay for it� Monica said. �Listen up, Andrew, I&#8216;ve got a deal for you.� she continued. �Since you like my feet so much, if you pay for the taxi, I&#8217;ll let you keep the pantyhose. To smell or wear or whatever.� I could feel my face growing warmer, although it must have been pretty red already. It was a completely pathetic thing to say yes to. To buy her used pantyhose was to admit to being a freak and a loser, and why should I give her my money after being treated like a dog all morning?&nbsp; I was listening to hear if Catherine was giggling, but she wasn&#8217;t. �Or maybe I&#8217;ll just force you to pay for the taxi anyway� Monica said. She taken her foot out of my mouth, now pressing my nose upwards with her moist toes. I pictured her twisting my fingers, slapping my face and pulling me around by my hair, like I had seen her do to others. From my current position, the scenario wasn&#8217;t too unlikely. I would gladly pay to avoid being treated like that in front of Catherine, possibly others too. The humiliation had gone far enough as it was. �Okay� I said. �I&#8217;ll pay.� �Good boy.� Monica said, giving my nose some bonus rubs. �Rita said I could keep it, so I&#8216;m sure she won&#8216;t mind. If she does, you&#8216;ll have to return it, though. Now, get up and order a car for� let&#8217;s say thirty minutes from now?� she asked Catherine. �Yes.� Catherine said. I got out from under the table and found a room with a phone. Thankfully they were able to send one for the requested time. I went back to the kitchen and told the girls. It was hard to look at them. I felt like I had they eyes of a puppy dog when looking at Monica, and I was too ashamed to look at Catherine at all. �Good.� Monica said. �Just one thing about this meal, though. Come here.� I went over to her. �I told you to make a good breakfast, right?� �Yes.� I nervously replied. �Well, the coffee was too strong, and I don&#8217;t like orange jam.� �Oh, I&#8217;m sorry.� I said. �Get on your knees. We don&#8217;t want to waste food, so your going to eat it yourself.� I knelt down beside her. I was dead hungry, so eating it without any further punishment was fine by me. �Here you go�. She lifted the bread to my mouth, obviously going to feed it to me. I took one bite, but then she flipped the slice upwards against my face, covering it with jam. �Oops, how clumsy if me.� Monica said. �That&#8217;s disgusting.� Catherine said. Monica was laughing. �Should we let him clean up before we leave? Wouldn&#8217;t it be hilarious to make him sit in the taxi like that?� Monica said. �The driver probably wouldn&#8217;t let him.� Catherine said. �Probably not.� Monica agreed. �Alright, Andrew. Go clean your face, we don&#8217;t want that mess dripping around. After that you can clean these dishes and I guess we&#8217;re out of here.� Monica said.
I went on with the cores, making sure to do the dishes properly. Monica paid me no further attention, chatting with Catherine until the taxi arrived. Monica motioned for me to take the front seat. I was the one to pay. Monica told the driver to go to her and Catherine&#8217;s addresses first, even though they were further away than mine. It was going to be an expensive ride. Soon I heard Monica move around in the backseat. The driver looked in the mirror and I could see he was surprised. �I almost forgot�� Monica said. Next she pulled her pantyhose down over my head. �Here you go, like I promised.� she said, patting the top of my head. By reflex I lifted my hand to remove it, but she smacked my hand away, simply saying �Don&#8217;t!�. I wore it for the ride until the girls got off. Monica held on to the legs of the pantyhose, now and then using them to pull my head to the sides. I felt like a complete fool. Monica got off first, patting my head again, saying �See you on Monday.�, which sent another chill down my spine. Not a word was spoken in the taxi after Monica left, Catherine didn&#8217;t even say anything when she got out. I didn&#8217;t take the hose off until she had gone, in case she would tell Monica later. I paid the driver without saying anything myself. 
Finally home, I passed out on the bed. Waking up a few hours later, I couldn&#8217;t believe what had happened that morning. Still, the pantyhose was solid proof. With mixed emotions I lifted it to my nose. In the groin area I could smell traces of her pussy and ass. At the reinforced part where her toes had been the scent was much stronger. My mind flashed back to when she was sitting on top of me. At once I was fully erect, and came in a matter of seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 









I considered not going to school the following week, but I couldn&#8217;t escape the situation, or Monica, forever. Monday came, and I went. I was numb with nervous anticipation. 
To my surprise and great relief, nothing happened. Catherine seemed to ignore me even more than before, but Monica did nothing to bother me. I almost felt like I should thank her. 
The following days were a bit absurd. At school I would watch Monica from a safe distance, not talk to her and of course not touch her, while at home I would jerk off and have strong orgasms while inhaling the smell of her feet from the pantyhose. It was also bizarre how a stinky odour that I initially didn&#8217;t like had become the strongest aphrodisiac. I kept the pantyhose in a plastic box to preserve the scent. 
Needless to say, by now I was pretty obsessed with Monica. It was a constant source of distraction. Whenever she was in the same room it was impossible for me to relax, and we shared most of the subjects at school. It even affected the way I answered a question when being asked by the teacher during class. Just knowing that Monica was in the same room hearing what I was about to say made me nervous. Not that she would pay much attention to what I said. She had little interest in school and her grades were surely lower than mine. Also my mind was frequently drifting away into fantasies about her instead of paying attention to the teacher. I started underachieving. Keeping on like that, I could actually risk that my grades would go down. I planned to compensate by studying harder, so at least I could do better on written tests. Monica was manipulating me by her sheer presence. 

Did she intend for this to happen when she made me keep the pantyhose? Probably not, it seemed more like a spontaneous, final humiliation that day. Anyway, I don&#8217;t think she could have expected it to go this far.&nbsp; 

As pathetic as I felt by using the pantyhose as a nasal-sexual stimulus, I was becoming increasingly attached to it. I was using it every day, sometimes even before I got out of bed in the morning. Unavoidably though, the scent faded from the nylon. I felt frustrated and sad. In a twisted way it had made me feel closer to Monica, the only way I could be close to her, probably. 
After a while I was beginning to wish that Monica would do something to me again. 
I had been wishing that for a long time, but now the urge had become so strong that I started to care less about the consequences. With the pantyhose gone, my fantasies had less impact. Even thinking about what she had done to me at Rita&#8217;s house wasn&#8217;t enough to get me off anymore. I had replayed the scenario in my mind too many times. I needed something new. 
Why did she stay away from me? It wasn&#8217;t like she had stopped. I still saw her kick other boys&#8217; asses from time to time. Maybe she thought she had gone too far on me that day. Maybe Catherine had said something to her. Even if she had zero respect for boys Monica paid attention to other girls.&nbsp; 
Of course, I was also staying away from her. If I could have the courage to approach her, she should would probably be onto me pretty quickly. The thought of course scared me, but under the right circumstances, maybe I could do it. If I was alone with her and nobody was watching. It wouldn&#8217;t take much effort. Just a small encouragement.
Thinking about that made me even more nervous with being around her, and even more frustrated about myself and the whole situation. 

A few days passed and one morning I was late for school. I was supposed to get a lift from my father instead of taking the bus, but a water pipe in the house broke, and he had to stay home to take care of it. When I arrived by the next bus, I saw Monica come out of a car. She was late too. We were headed towards the same classroom and couldn&#8217;t avoid each other, although she seemed to be ignoring me. I felt I had to say something. �So I guess we are both late today.� I said, stating the obvious. I realized that I hadn&#8217;t spoken a word to her after Rita&#8217;s party, and that it was surreal to strike up something like a normal conversation. �What&#8217;s your excuse?� she replied without looking at me. �Oh, actually my father had said to give me a lift, but a damn water pipe in the house broke and he couldn&#8217;t go. I had to wait for the next bus. Getting a cab takes almost as long.� Mentioning the cab made me think of the morning at Rita&#8217;s and I got even more tense. �Oh.� was all Monica said. I didn&#8217;t ask why she was late. I figured she would tell me if she wanted to. I couldn&#8217;t think of anything else to say either. Although I had been desperate for some kind of contact, I was unable to do anything except walking next to her. I was afraid of that tiny girl. I couldn&#8217;t look at her and found myself trying to think about everything other than her just to cope with the situation. I felt sick. We kept walking in silence, except for the popping of her chewing gum, which made me jump in my steps each time. We were forty minutes late when we entered the classroom. �So, what is the reason for this?� the teacher asked. �My father was supposed to give me a ride, but a water pipe broke and he had to stay at home. I had to wait for the next bus� Monica said. She stole my excuse! �Really? Well, I guess I will have to believe that one.� the teacher answered. I had to say something too but I was unable to make up anything much on the spot, so I just said that I had overslept. �That&#8217;s not acceptable, you know. One mark on Andrew.� the teacher said. I heard Monica giggle. 
The little prank combined with the minutes of physical closeness to Monica added some fuel to my masturbation activity for a while. 

The next thing that happened was during gym class. I was playing volleyball, Monica was on the opposite team. At one point I was able to make a great jump smash, but to my shock I smashed the ball directly at Monica who was unprepared, and with her arms halfway up the ball hit her breasts. It couldn&#8217;t have hurt much, but she was annoyed and gave me an evil eye that scared the shit out of me. I made sure to play poorly for the rest of the game and my team ended up losing. 
In the wardrobe afterwards my mind was stuck on her, so much that I almost got an erection during the shower. It occurred to me that after gym class she would of course change socks, and that maybe I could actually steal them. Sure it would be risky, but it would also be the easiest and maybe only way to get her freshly worn socks or stockings. If she found out, I would be screwed, but I kind of wanted that too. I didn&#8216;t feel like I had so much to lose anymore. 
The easiest way would be if she changed before gym, leaving some used socks in the wardrobe during gym class. I could sneak in when no one was there. If I knew what kind of socks she was wearing, I could leave a similar pair there to prevent her from finding out, or at least to make her less upset. Perhaps she would think that another girl had taken the wrong socks.

The same day when I was waiting for the bus, I saw Monica walking towards me, looking at me with a sinister stare. I was her target, no doubt. She was going to punish me for the volleyball incident. Without thinking twice I just started to walk away. I hurried into the school building and ran through the corridors looking for a place to hide. The library was open. I went to the back of the room and sat down behind a shelf. The minutes went and she didn&#8217;t come. I stayed there until I knew her bus had left. Mine had left too, so I waited another hour to get the next bus. 

The next day I took for granted that she would carry out whatever punishment she had in mind. There was no use escaping it. I had to brace myself and take it. It was going to be humiliating, but I comforted myself by thinking that she did this to other boys all the time. I expected it to happen during the first recess, and made sure to be by myself so maybe my friends wouldn&#8217;t witness it. I looked for Monica, hoping she would be alone as well. No such luck. She was standing with her girlfriends. Like in slow motion, I saw her look around until her eyes found me. She signalled with her hand for me to walk over, and I noticed my legs starting to move. I stopped in front of her. She was more than one head lower than me. �Pull your pants up.� she said. I was prepared to do whatever she told me. Like a robot I grabbed my pants and pulled them up. �More. More.� I pulled as far as they would go without ripping the seems. My balls were totally squeezed. I heard her girlfriends giggle but all I saw was Monica. �Turn around.� I did. �Look at that ass. It looks like a girl&#8217;s ass, doesn&#8217;t it?� Monica said. Her friends agreed and laughed more. She took hold and pulled the pants even further into my ass crack, making me go up on my toes. �God, that&#8217;s pathetic. I feel like I wanna spank it.� Monica said. �Turn around again.� She looked me into the eyes. I had to look down. �Do you want me to spank you?� she asked. �No, please don&#8217;t.� I said. She kept on looking at me, popping a couple of chewing gum bubbles. I was about to pee in my pants. Then she grabbed my shoulders and put her knee into my balls, which were probably visible on the outside of my tight pants. �Get lost.� she said. I sank down but managed to walk off. It was very painful.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
When I got home the same day I was wondering what the hell I was doing. My balls were still tender. Was that what I wanted? To be in pain like that, and let Monica make a loser out of me? I was confused. Something had happened that I had craved for a long time, but it was all to real. 
I woke up in the middle of the night with a rock hard erection. A dream about Monica was still very vivid in my mind. I jerked off and my sore balls made it feel even better. 

When the next gym class came up I had almost forgotten about the idea of stealing the socks. Coincidentally though, I was late, and realized it was the perfect opportunity. I didn&#8217;t have any socks to swap with, but maybe I could use some other girl&#8217;s socks. The wardrobe doors were next to each other, so I decided that if someone was still in the wardrobe, I would just&nbsp; pretend to have opened the wrong door. Occasionally that did happen. The spontaneity of the action made me less nervous than I would usually be, but as I opened the door my heart paced up. The room was empty. I quickly spotted Monica&#8217;s bag. There was a pair of socks in it, but they were clean. So where the panties. No surprise really, but still disappointing. I would have to steal them after gym class in stead, somehow. I looked around for somebody else&#8217;s worn socks. I wouldn&#8217;t want just anybody&#8217;s, and nobody&#8217;s of course could match Monica&#8217;s, but Catherine&#8217;s might be of interest. She was posh enough to use a separate pair of socks just for gym class. I was right! Next to her bag was a used pair. They were even short nylon stockings, not cotton socks. I brought them up to my nose and felt a buzz in my head. A different smell than Monica&#8216;s, but still the intoxicating scent of female feet. I put them in my pocket and hurried out of the room.&nbsp; 
I figured my act was more likely to be revealed if I showed up late for gym class than if I didn&#8217;t show up at all. I decided to go home and report sudden illness. Also I couldn&#8217;t wait to get home and jerk off while smelling the stockings. 











Although Monica was my number one fantasy partner, now that I had Catherine&#8217;s stockings I couldn&#8217;t help also watching her whenever I was able to. She had such long, perfect legs, and often wore a skirt, showing them off bare skinned or in nylons. They were gorgeous, and I knew what they smelled like. 
I didn&#8217;t hear any comment about the stockings I had stolen. It was just a cheap pair, she probably didn&#8217;t care about it. 
I was no less surprised though, when I got an email with an invitation to Catherine&#8217;s birthday party. She didn&#8217;t invite the entire class, and Catherine was part of the in-crowd at school. Her looks was more than enough to make her popular. I expected she would invite only her kind of people, and I was not among them. 
Had it been Monica&#8217;s party I would have been suspicious, but I didn&#8217;t have any issues with Catherine, except for what she had seen Monica do back then at Rita&#8217;s, and the fact that I was crazy about her legs. I could need a social boost after the degradation from Monica. A party like that seemed like the right thing. Maybe Catherine was actually trying to help me out. 
I wanted to thank her for the invite, but every time I saw her I couldn&#8217;t help staring at her legs and feet, so it was better to skip it.
The first thing that came to mind when thinking about a birthday present was of course a pair of stockings. Something exclusive and expensive. It would be just right to give her that, but I probably couldn&#8217;t do it. It would be far too intimate. Also, it could give her the idea that I was the stocking thief, remembering Monica&#8217;s pantyhose in the taxi and all. I couldn&#8217;t risk that� but what if nothing was leading to me? I could give it anonymously. Just leave it on the gift table without a note. That should be possible. And if it was too difficult I could just keep the stockings. I had to try. To have a chance to later watch Catherine walk around in stockings of my choosing was definitely worth it.
Soon afterwards I visited a lingerie shop. There was a lot to choose from. I had already decided on the colour black. I was tempted to pick a pair of straight ones with seem in the back and a simple pattern at the top, but seeing all the different designs made me go for something a little more special. I settled on something that wasn&#8217;t too extravagant but still very expensive. The were frillings at the top and flower dots in the same style along the stocking. I was the only man standing in line at the counter and I felt straight away that my fetish was exposed. The salesgirl gave me a broad smile as I paid. 
I also bought a bottle of vine as a present that I could put my name on. 

The day arrived and I went to her house expecting an evening of anonymity among the popular people from school. A lot of them were already there. I didn&#8217;t even see Catherine. There was a gift table but I only put the bottle there. Although there was a gift wrap around the stockings, someone would probably observe me put the packet there and be able to trace it back to me if it became an issue. Maybe I could just leave the stockings somewhere else in the house. 
I knew almost none of the people present. I went into the kitchen and immediately tensed up when seeing Monica, pouring herself a drink. �Andrew!� she said in a mock positive way. �Hello.� I&nbsp; said. �The pantyhose boy.� she continued. �What�?� I stuttered. �So did you enjoy it?� �What?� I asked again, becoming more nervous by the second. �The hose, moron. Did you feel it and sniff it every night before you went to bed? I bet you did.� She was right onto me, and it took me completely by surprise. The issue had not been brought up since that very day, and suddenly she was all aggressive about it. She was totally right though. She went up close to me and slapped my face. �Answer me when I talk to you!� The fear was back. �Yes, I� sniffed it a couple of times.� �God, you&#8217;re pathetic. I knew it.� She took a sip from her drink. �Sniffed it every time you jerked off, didn&#8217;t you?� �Yes.� �And then you stole Catherine&#8217;s stockings, to have some fresh stink to jerk off to?� �No no!� I said desperately. �Don&#8217;t you dare lie to me!� she slapped my face again, even harder. I was afraid she might kick me in the nuts too. �Okay, I did! I&#8217;m sorry! Please!� I begged. �You&#8217;re in trouble now. Catherine told me about the stockings and I knew it was you. How stupid are you? Don&#8217;t you think we notice you staring at our feet? In fact you&#8217;re doing it right now! Look me in the eye!� It was almost impossible but I managed to look at her. �We are going to punish you. Tonight. By giving you a task. Every time either I or Catherine is having a cigarette, you are going to be there to light it. For each cigarette you miss you will get a face slap. It&#8217;s as simple as that. Do you understand?� �Yes.� I answered, fearing how the night would turn out. �Catherine already knows about this. You better hope she hasn&#8217;t had many cigarettes yet.� I realized I didn&#8217;t have a lighter. I didn&#8217;t smoke myself. �But� I don&#8217;t have a lighter�� I told her. �Well then I suggest you better get one!� she yelled at me. I ran out of the house and around the neighbourhood to find a store. Thankfully I found one quickly and bought two lighters. I ran back. I peeked into the kitchen. Monica was still there, smoking a cigarette already. �I&#8217;m sorry.� I said. �Come here.� She said. I got another slap. For some reason I kept standing there like a fool waiting for some command, while she took a drag of her cigarette and slowly blew the smoke in my face. Then she left the room with small steps on her clicking heels. I hurried to look for Catherine. To be slapped and humiliated by her was almost worse than with Monica. Monica did things like that all the time, but it was far from Catherine&#8216;s style. She was a woman more than a girl. A dignified, unattainable queen. She didn&#8217;t have to get physical or even talk to get a boy or man under her thumb, he would be there just from looking at her. Normally it would be below her standards to play this kind of game, neither would she normally let Monica make the rules. She had to be really upset about the stockings. Maybe I should try to give her the new pair anyway. Now I found her standing with some sharp dressed guys. She looked incredible. A black, tight fitting dress exposing her shoulders and ending at midst of her thighs. Black nylons and open toed suede shoes with very high heels. Discrete make up and flowing hair. �Th-Thank you for the invitation!� I stammered. �Welcome.� she said, looking at me. She picked up a cigarette and I could see some of the guys reaching for a lighter in their pockets but I was prepared and managed to light the cigarette first. Catherine then turned around and continued chatting. No faceslap. As both she and Monica were smoking I had a few minutes off. I tried to calm down and consider the situation. The evening didn&#8217;t have to turn out so bad. If I could manage to light the cigarettes in time there would be no humiliating face slapping. Sure it would look a bit strange that I was always there to light their cigarettes, but it was also a polite act that most guys would do toward attractive girls like Catherine and Monica anyway. The thing was, I had to watch both of them closely. I could probably expect at least twenty minutes between each cigarette. The problem was if they had one at the same time, like they just did.&nbsp; 
I went to the bathroom to relieve myself while I had the chance. Then I relocated the girls. They were still in different rooms, but for the moment I could watch both of them from the doorway. While the other guests were mingling, I kept my position and turned my head frequently to keep track of them both. People were passing by but I couldn&#8217;t risk losing focus by engaging in a conversation. Monica was sometimes glancing towards me, probably amused by my obedient involvement. Suddenly a guy was offering Catherine a cigarette. I rushed over and put my lighter in front of her cigarette almost before she had it between her lips. �Is this your personal servant or something?� the guy asked, annoyed that I was interrupting. Catherine looked a bit confused herself. �No, I� well, thank you, Andrew.� she said and turned back to him. I went back to my place by the door. I looked at Monica and to my shock she was smoking again. I had missed out. I didn&#8217;t want to walk over just to get my face slapped so I stayed put. I would get it later, no doubt. But I was not going to miss the next one. Catherine didn&#8217;t seem at all angry with me. Maybe it was better to follow up on Monica if I had to choose between them. The minutes went by. I was trying to smile and act relaxed despite my unsocial behaviour. Some people said hello and I answered distantly, trying to keep it short. I understood I wasn&#8217;t going to make any friends that night. I wanted to get drunk, but it didn&#8217;t seem very wise if I was going to stay focused. I had to be sober. 
It was twenty minutes since their last cigarettes and I was expecting the next one to come up. I made Monica my priority and moved closer to her. It took ten more minutes before she picked one up and I expected to have missed out on Catherine who I couldn&#8217;t see from my position. I was ready for Monica though. She let me light it, then she blew the smoke in my face and slapped me for the previous cigarette. She didn&#8217;t say anything and I didn&#8217;t either, so it was probably a bizarre scenario. I walked back to the door and saw that Catherine had a new one. Nothing to do about that. 

The evening went by. I missed some cigarettes but not many. Thankfully they were not in different rooms all the time. Catherine had not slapped me one single time. I wondered if she had changed her mind, or if she was just saving them up, or maybe she was leaving the punishment part to Monica. Monica occasionally slapped me, harder each time, which of course got curious attention from people around. While at the beginning of the party people had talked to me, most of them were now avoiding me. Understandably I appeared like some antisocial loser who was there only to manically light Catherine and Monica&#8217;s cigarettes and get my face slapped. With all the people around it was the most humiliating night of my life. Still I felt no anger towards Monica. It was like she had every right to do it. She was superior to me. An evil goddess. I wanted to serve her anyway I could. 

As the evening reached it&#8217;s peak, for everybody except me that was, Monica came up to me. She said: �You&#8217;ve done quite a good job tonight. I know Catherine has been nice and not slapping you. From my count you failed her two times, but I haven&#8217;t been paying much attention, so I suppose a fair number is ten. Still, since you&#8217;ve been a good boy I&#8217;m actually going to give you a choice. Either I will slap you ten times, hard and slow right here in front of everybody, or you can go to Catherine, kiss her feet and ask her to forgive you for the theft, and- unless she thinks otherwise- that will probably be it.� I knew I had failed to light Catherine&#8217;s cigarette only two times, but to argue was not an option. The choice she gave me was quite simple. I had been slapped throughout the evening, but at least it was only one at a time. A punishment series like she was describing would break me completely, maybe I would even cry. Catherine on the other hand seemed cheerful and forgiving. �Thank you. I will go to Catherine.� I said. �Good for you.� she said. 
Catherine was talking to someone. I hoped I wasn&#8217;t interrupting too much. I went down on all fours and kissed the top of both her pumps. Then I stood up. She looked puzzled. I said: �Please Catherine, can you forgive me for stealing your stockings?� Her look changed from surprise to anger.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
�My stockings? What� from the gym? Did you actually steal those? You went into the wardrobe and looked through my stuff?! And then you took the stockings? Why, what kind of freak are you?� Her voice got higher. She was really upset. I felt an icing in my chest. I realized Monica had set me up. I felt a tiny spark of anger, but what could I do? Catherine hadn&#8217;t known previously, but now she did. She continued: �I invited you here because I felt sorry for you. I asked Monica to be nice to you. But you really are pathetic. I see why you&#8217;ve been lighting my cigarettes all evening, but I&#8217;m afraid that&#8217;s not good enough. I suppose I should throw you out right now, but I think you&#8217;re gonna stay here and make up for what you&#8217;ve done. I will let Monica take care of it. I&#8217;m sure she can think of a proper punishment.� 
When I didn&#8217;t think the evening could get worse it seemed to escalate beyond proportions. I thought about running out the door and escaping, but that would only cause a postponement and maybe an even tougher punishment. I was a loser towards the crowd there already, so I might as well take the humiliation there. Catherine went to find Monica. I stood waiting, my eyes to the floor. I felt everybody was watching me. Monica and Catherine came back. Monica was carrying a dog&#8217;s collar and leach. �Down on all fours.� she commanded. I immediately obeyed. She put the collar around my neck and tightened it. The collar had hair on it. Obviously it belonged to Catherine&#8217;s family&#8217;s dog. �Crawl!� Monica commended, kicking my ass. I started crawling on the floor. Monica walked behind me, pulling the leach went she wanted me to change direction. She paraded me through the house, making sure everybody noticed my degradation. Sometimes she stopped and chatted. I wanted to keep my head down, but standing on all fours it was impossible not to notice the nylon clad legs all around me. As we moved on, Monica gave different explanations to why she was walking me around like a dog. �His favourite song is &#8217;Now I wanna be your dog&#8217; by Iggy Pop, so I&#8217;m making his wish come true.� and �I didn&#8217;t like his suit. I&#8217;m helping him to ruin it so he has to get a new one.� She also said : �He stole Catherine&#8217;s stockings. He likes stinky feet just like dogs do, so I&#8217;m treating him like one.� When she said this she pointed to the feet of a girl in front of me who had open toed pumps, and continued: �See those toes, Fido? Would you like to smell them?� I didn&#8217;t answer and she yanked the leash. �Yes� I said. �Dogs don&#8217;t talk, they bark.� Monica said. I tried to make a barking sound. The people around us laughed. �That&#8217;s a good boy. Can he have a whiff, Brigitte? Is that okay with you?� Monica asked the girl. �Sure, why not.� Brigitte answered. �Go ahead, Fido!� Monica said. I put my nose down towards her toes. �I can&#8217;t hear you. Sniff harder, Fido.� Monica said. I sniffed as loudly as I could a couple of times. More laughter. �Do they smell good?� Monica asked. I barked again. �Maybe we could let you smell all the feet here and find out which are most stinky.� she said. We moved on. Sometimes Monica walked in front of me. To see her feet and legs while leading me around made me hard despite my stressful situation. After a while Monica wanted to sit down. She made me lay down on the floor and tied the leash to a table leg. She sat down on the coach and told me to gently take her shoes off with my mouth. Then she put her feet on my face. They were moist after something like six hours at the party. I recognised the odour from the pantyhose I had been smelling so many times, but this of course was a lot more potent. My blood was rushing and I was stone hard inside my pants. Her soles were covering my eyes, comfortably blocking the view to all the watching guests. 
Despite the circumstances, I realized there was no other place I would rather be. To be a servant to Monica, someone she could use or abuse as she saw fit, like a piece of furniture she could rest her feet on, and to be able to feel and smell her body- it was nothing I wanted more. I didn&#8217;t care if I was a loser. 
�I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s such a good idea.� It was Catherine&#8217;s voice. �He&#8217;s obsessed you know. If you keep sticking your feet in his face you&#8217;re probably encouraging him to run around and steal more stockings.� �Well yeah, but now that he&#8217;s outed and everybody knows he is a foot freak, he can&#8217;t steal anything and get away with it.� Monica said. �But if he does, I&#8216;m going to make him go to school wearing nothing but pantyhose. Hear that, Fido? You&#8217;re allowed to speak right now. Repeat what I just said.� She lifted her feet from my face. �If I steal somebody&#8217;s stockings you are going to make me go to school wearing nothing but pantyhose.� I said. She put her feet back down. �That&#8217;s right. I actually hope he&#8217;s gonna do it. It would be fucking hilarious to watch him walk around like that.� She said to Catherine. �It sure would.� Catherine said. Hearing myself repeating her words made it clear that it would actually happen. I surely wasn&#8217;t going to steal anything. Walking around naked except for that female clothing would surely ruin my social life once and for all. I could even be arrested. Yet Monica was capable of doing anything to me. The only limit was her imagination.&nbsp; 


I woke up the next morning with a sense of d�j� vu. My chin was kicked lightly a couple of times followed by toes rubbing against my nose. �Wake up and smell the feet!� a girl&#8217;s voice exclaimed triumphantly. I was still on the floor next to the sofa, attached to the table by a collar and leash. Everything came back to me with dreadful clarity. Before leaving, Monica had told Catherine&#8217;s younger sister, who arrived sometime late in the evening, to treat me anyway she wanted to. Monica also had told me to be obedient or else� Catherine&#8217;s sister Trudy could hardly be more than one year younger. Like her sister she was early developed, all the female features were there, in the same striking proportions, although she was probably just fifteen years old. Her face was maybe not quite as model-gorgeous as Catherine&#8217;s, but still very pretty. While Catherine had blue eyes, Trudy&#8217;s were green and piercing. To me, the biggest difference between them was the personality. Perhaps it was just because she was younger and somewhat immature, but Trudy was more like Monica than Catherine. Even though, or maybe because, she had never seen me before, Trudy picked up on Monica&#8217;s rudeness towards me right away. She had made me clean her shoes and stockings, she had slapped me for not doing a good job, and when she went to bed she had commanded me to stay put. Now she was back. She was only wearing a big t-shirt, and probably panties although I could not tell from my angle. Her hair was pulled back. She ate something from a plate that she held above her breasts. One naked leg was curled beneath her on the sofa, the other was stretched out towards me, her foot resting on the side of my face. �Lick it!� she commanded. I moved my head upwards and licked her salty tasting toes and sole. She continued to eat. 
After a while she put the plate down on the floor next to me. �Here doggie, finish it.� Even though I had been humiliated much worse the night before, it was really degrading to wake up and be treated like a dog by some stranger. I turned towards the plate. The were some dinner leftovers. She had been eating it with a fork but had not supplied me with one. I begun to use my hand but she kicked it away. �A-a! Dogs don&#8217;t eat like that.� I put my face down to the plate and tried to grab the food with my teeth. I could feel her watching me. I already had food all over my face when her foot pressed down on the back of my head, grinding my face into what was left on the plate. She giggled quietly. �Let me look at you.� She pulled my head up by my hear. �Yack! That looks really disgusting, but there is still some food left!� She put her foot down on the plate, grinding her sole and toes into the food, then lifted her foot just above the plate and told me to eat. She fed me with her foot until the plate was clean. Then she helped me clean my face by rubbing her foot against the food there and have me lick it off her sole. It took some time to make everything clean to her satisfaction. All the while her green eyes were watching me with curious interest like I was an object for her to experiment with. When finished she sat back and stretched her body. �Hmmm, I don&#8217;t really know what to do with you now.� she said, still looking at me the same way, as if was actually a dog. �Maybe I should take you for a walk around the garden� yeah�� She untied the leash from the table and made me stand on all fours. Something fell out of my pocket. �Hey, what&#8217;s that?� she said. It was the package with the stockings I had bought for Catherine.&nbsp; �Is that a present for Catherine? Why didn&#8217;t you give it last night?� I didn&#8217;t know what to say, or if I even was supposed to speak. �Or did you steal it?� she continued. The word &#8216;steal&#8216; sent a chill up my spine and almost broke my submissive silence, but only almost. She was looking at me with real curiosity, but it didn&#8217;t seem like she was expecting an answer. �I wanna know what that is� Give it here!� I handed her the gift. She tore off the paper. �A pair of stockings! Well, isn&#8217;t that a surprise. Quite the leg man, aren&#8217;t you. Maybe not man, though�� She had a closer look at it. �These are expensive ones� really nice. Stay-ups too.� She hesitated, probably considering what to do with them. She looked at me, then looked into the next room to see if anybody was around. Then she sat back down on the sofa. �I don&#8217;t know why you had these on you, but I don&#8217;t care. I&#8217;m gonna wear them right now. I bet it&#8217;s gonna turn you on.� She put one rolled up stocking over her toes, then stretched her leg out with her foot right in front of my face and rolled it up just above the midst of her thigh. It was a perfect fit. �Are you drooling yet?� she teased. I almost was. She did the same with the other stocking. In the back of my mind, despite the distressful situation, it suddenly occurred to my how useful the production of salvia was for licking dry and salty feet. She got up and pranced around seductively, wiggling her ass, stroking her legs, showing off the stockings. �What are you looking at?� she said, her face suddenly turning dead serious. I turned my face down, still standing on all fours. She sat down on my back. She grabbed my hair and shook my head a little. Then I heard someone enter the room behind me. �Oh god, is he still here?� it was Catherine. �He sure is.� Trudy replied. �Well, I don&#8217;t wanna see him. Get him out of here. You shouldn&#8217;t be treating him like that anyway.� �Well, Monica is!� �Yeah, but Monica is Monica. She is� what stockings is that you&#8216;re wearing?� �The dork gave them to me.� �He gave them to you?� �Yes.� �Why?� �Well, he had them in his pocket and I noticed so he gave them to me.� �He had them in his pocket?� Catherine was raising her voice. �Well, did you ask were he got them, or why he would have them in his pocket?� �No, I�� Trudy was becoming a bit puzzled by her sister&#8217;s temper. �Have you been stealing AGAIN?!�� She was obviously asking me, and I was on the brink to panic, but no words came out of my mouth. It was like I had lost my speaking ability. The next thing I felt was a sharp shot of pain and I cried out as Catherine kicked me in the balls from behind. I fell over with Trudy on top of me. She started laughing from her sister&#8217;s unusual and surprising behaviour. She got up off me and Catherine appeared in front of me. She was wearing blue tights that stopped at her ankles, and a big t-shirt just like Trudy. The kick had brought my voice back. I had to say something, I couldn&#8217;t be taken for a thief one more time. �Please may I speak?� I asked. �Yes you may!� Catherine yelled back at me. �I bought the stockings, I swear to god, the package is right there. I wanted to give them to you, because, as you know, I stole the other pair from you earlier. I&#8217;m sorry. I&#8217;m sorry. But I didn&#8217;t put them on the gift table last night, because I got worried that I would reveal myself as the thief.� �Well, you surely revealed yourself anyway, didn&#8217;t you.� Catherine said. �What a loser.� Trudy commented. �Well, fair enough. I think Andrew has had his share of humiliation for now. Will you please escort him out of the house, and leave those stockings in my room.� Catherine told Trudy. She turned around and walked away. Disappointed, Trudy barked at me to give her the leash. I picked it up and gave it to her. �Crawl!� she made me walk in front of her on a tight leash, kicking my ass with every other step. When we got to the door I found my shoes, but wasn&#8217;t able to put them on while remaining on all fours. I looked up at her for permission to sit down or some hint of what to do. �Out!� she just commanded. I crawled out the door with the shoes in my hands. She gave me one last kick that hit my sore balls. I cried out again, probably to the attention of the neighbours. She giggled and finally took the collar off. Then she went back inside and shut the door without a word. I put my shoes on and hurried off.
