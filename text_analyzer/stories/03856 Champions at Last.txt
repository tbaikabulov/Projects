Synopsis: They didn't win the cheerleading contest but I had a plan to make them champions of a different kind.CHAMPIONS AT LAST 
By 
Anne Gray
It was the last day of the Cheerleader Championships and, as a member of the
  press, I had a prime view from my seat in the stands. Things worked out perfectly
  when the team I had my eye on came in fourth place. That would take them out
  of the spotlight while everyone focused on the winning three teams. 
The program told me their names were Nina, Panni, Anita and Laura and they
  were from a college on the East coast. My phony media credentials also got
  me in to the closing dinner and it was no problem working things to end up
  sitting at their table. 
They were naturally disappointed with the results of the contest but put on
  brave faces while the presentations were made. Since they were no longer in
  training they all let their hair down a bit and I bought some wine for the
  table making sure each girl had a couple of glasses. 
When the event was over Laura suggested skipping the private parties being
  hosted by the winning teams and just heading back to the dormitory cottage
  they had been assigned to pack ready for leaving early in the morning. 
My suggestion, as everyone was pulling on coats and jackets, that I bring
  another bottle of wine over was greeted with thanks and un-needed directions
  to the cottage; I knew exactly where it was. 
Half an hour later I parked the van out of sight behind the cottage and walked
  around to the front door. Nina answered my knock and took the bottle of wine
  after closing the door then held my purse while I took off my leather jacket. 
The cottage had only one level with a double bedroom on each side of a fairly
  large central living room; we all gathered there while Nina pored the wine.
  No one raised an eyebrow when I indicated that I would not be joining them
  because I was driving. Five minutes later the only one standing was me; the
  four girls sprawled in chairs and on the sofa, fast asleep from the knockout
  drops in the wine. 
I'm not exactly a small woman and I do stay in good shape but the next hour
  was a testing one. At the end of it the cheerleaders were securely bound hand
  and foot lying side-by-side in the van. Multiple straps from tie down points
  in the floor held them in place. They were not gagged yet but would be when
  it got close to the time for them to be waking up. Their luggage was also in
  the van and the cottage left clean and tidy. 
I locked the door, pushed the key back through the letter slot, and drove
  off with my new recruits. 
A couple of hundred miles later I pulled over to the side of the highway and
  fitted very effective ball gags in each mouth before continuing south and west
  towards my home, some help and some sleep. 
Just as the sun was coming up the gate at the end of the road leading to my
  lodge was a very welcome sight and, after locking it again behind me, the last
  three miles of the journey passed quickly. As I pulled up in front of the stable
  Selena came out of the main house to meet me. 
Turning off the van I reached up and gratefully peeled off the black wig,
  shaking my blonde pageboy loose. It needed a damn good wash having been covered
  for the last five days since we had taken the shot for the fake media pass.
  The crimson fingernail was my own and I hooked it under the thin membrane holding
  the padding against my nose. God it felt good to get rid of that too. 
Selena had taken advantage of my rule that, when it was just the two of us,
  she stayed in her place as a sub' and my personal ponygirl; but, when I needed
  help with new recruits for the business she was allowed to pretend otherwise. 
Right now she was pretending in a black leather cat suit, stiletto heeled
  boots and a crop hanging from her belt. She looked very realistic but I would
  never tell her that, it would spoil our relationship! 
I was nearly dropping but between the two of us we soon had four wriggling
  cheerleaders in the stable and put to bed for a few hours. Well, what we actually
  did was strip off their jeans, sweaters and underwear then drape them naked
  over a hitching rail. Each pair of wrists was crossed behind the back and tied
  simply, but effectively, with white cord. More cord around the ankles ran under
  the rail to simple collars around their necks holding them in position; the
  gags were still in place. 
They were now fully awake and, before going for some rest, I pulled on a rubber
  glove, scooped two fingers worth of lubricant out of the big waiting jar and,
  while Selena pulled her ass cheeks apart, worked it in Laura's rosebud. 
She squirmed as much as the restraints allowed but only managed to make the
  others wonder what the hell was going on. They soon found out because we moved
  along the line until they were all well greased. My pretend dominatrix handed
  me thick butt plugs to be worked in each helpless girl. There was a threaded
  opening in the base of each plug and in these we screwed large plumed ponytails.
  Looking good; it was the start! I went to bed; Selena would keep an eye on
  them. 
Three days later I watched as Selena, this time dressed in a duplicate outfit
  to mine, put the girls through some initial training. We were wearing fitted
  red leather �hunter� jackets with white leather jodhpurs and black knee high
  riding boots to set the scene. 
With Laura leading them Nina, Panni and Anita were in line ahead high stepping
  in a wide circle around Selena who held the four lead reins attached to collars
  on each of them. At this early stage my cheerleading team was just getting
  adapted to the tightly laced ballet boots on their feet. Simple leather double
  arm binders held their forearms behind their backs with just enough stress
  on them to make the chests jut forward proudly. 
Thin straps from the tip of the arm binders went through the crotch, holding
  in the butt plugs, then cleaving each vagina before being buckled to the front
  of a waist belt. Instead of gags they each had a 1&frac12;� diameter hard rubber
  bit pulled between their teeth and strapped at the back of the head. Their
  hair was held with braided leather thongs in, what else, ponytails. 
A thick cord ran from the back of Laura's collar to the front of Nina's and
  so on back to Anita to keep them in line. We were concentrating on making them
  high step in exact co-ordination together and the riding crop I carried was
  not getting quite as much use as it had the previous couple of days. 
Every so often one of them would have a crying fit; this time it was Panni
  who just stopped and dropped to her knees dragging the others with her. It
  had to be forcefully driven home that I was demanding the same teamwork they
  had in the cheerleader routines; the one for all and all for one mindset. 
After telling Selena what was to be done we unhitched Nina and Anita from
  the sobbing girl then led them, with Laura, over to the fence of the corral
  leaving Panni where she was. 
In short order the three were bent through the fence over the third rail with
  their ankles tied to the bottom rail and the crotch straps unbuckled so a length
  of cord around their wrists and over the top bar pulled the arm binders up
  out of the way. 
My lecture was short and sweet, �When one of you screws up the others get
  punished.� I handed Selena my riding crop and, with the furiousity of one usually
  on the other end of the crop, she proceeded to stripe each presented ass with
  ten of the best. 
Part way through this process Panni scrabbled to her feet and tried to get
  between Selena and the recipients. I pulled her out of the way then stood behind
  her, wrapped the girl in my arms and made her watch the punishment she had
  caused her friends. As she wailed around the bit and shook her head I whispered
  in her ear that the next time it would be twenty each until they learned to
  do as they were told. 
The lesson seemed to be effective and by the end of the week they could perform
  in perfect unison; time for the next step. 
We changed the ballet boots for pony shoes! 
Knee high with the heavily boned leather locking their ankles, the shoes were
  heel-less with curved metal strips under the feet forcing the insteps to arch
  gracefully down to the three inch thick toe pieces. Small horseshoes under
  the toe pieces allowed them a semblance of balance but it took another week
  before they were handling them with any sense of ease. 
By this time the nipple and nose ring punctures had healed nicely and I moved
  on with the program. 
The flat, stainless bars had metal cuffs at each end that were riveted around
  their arms just above the bicep. These were short enough to really brace their
  shoulders back and force the four very well endowed chests to display themselves
  beautifully. The inside of the cuffs were lined with rubber to avoid any irritation
  to the skin and, with the stainless steel, it meant that the girls could be
  hosed or washed down and there would be no rust. 
Two additional cuffs on each bar allowed me to cross their forearms and lock
  the wrists in them. What I was beginning to think could become a very acceptable
  team of ponygirls had lost the use of their arms permanently unless a skilled
  blacksmith removed the rivets. 
At every opportunity I exercised the team, concentrating on them moving as
  one, until it got to the point where they were ready for the final test. 
Selena had them up, fed, watered and washed down when I arrived in the stable
  with the other components for their outfits. The gold studded leather straps
  of the breast harnesses attached to the ends of the arm bars. The head tack,
  with 3� square blinders, only allowed them to see forwards. 
After tightening the bit straps and brushing out the ponytails on top of their
  heads we moved lower to fit wide heavy leather belts around each waist and
  used straps from them to hold in a new treat - rubber dildos. The crotch straps
  split so that as they came up between the pony's ass cheeks the butt plugs
  were also held in but the opening left to screw in the plumed tails. 
We lined them up, Laura in front as usual, then Nina, Panni and Anita and
  fitted the two pieces of 10' long black fiberglass so that the four half circles
  in each one met around their necks. The pieces were 3� high forcing their chins
  up; several short bolts locked the two pieces together and, therefore, the
  ponies in line. 
The other pieces of black fiberglass looked like 10' skis. I fitted Laura's
  left pony shoe in the first flange near the front tip and locked it in place.
  Then Nina's about 2' back and the other two. Their right hooves got the same
  treatment. Now we had to find out if the system worked; it would but only with
  precise teamwork from the four. 
The footboards had very short studs along the undersides to give the ponies
  a grip and I walked slowly backwards in front of Laura, pulling on temporary
  reins to see if they could handle the setup. They could and after two days
  I began to teach them how to turn. 
On command the right legs moved outwards slightly allowing the left board
  to come down on a gentle angle to the left and in this manner they were able
  to make a complete circle. 
The last piece of the picture was to hook the tongue of the lightweight two-wheeled
  trap to the end of the bar behind Anita's neck. With the weight evenly distributed
  all four contributed to pulling it, and me, around the corral. 
The four were high stepping in perfect time, they had to because one knee
  not lifted to the exact right angle at the exact same time would throw the
  entire team of balance. An added touch were the small gold bells hooked on
  each of the eight nipple rings. 
After hitching them this way for a few more weeks until it became second nature
  I was satisfied enough to make a phone call. 
A regular customer had requested something different to pull a personal trap
  around his farm and I knew he would fall in love with these four champions
  - even at the price I was asking.
