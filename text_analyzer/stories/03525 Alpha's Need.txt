Synopsis: After her marriage falls apart, Jed returns to play the Games her husband never understood and indulge the part of herself she has been forced to suppress. Jed was grateful for fashion trends as she wrapped her cloak around her. This
  style had always been worn in the cold winter, because the fabric wrapped around
  the body twice. The first loop went under the arms, fastening just in front
  of the left armpit, then the fabric went over the right shoulder, a long sleeve
  there allowing freedom to the arm, before coming back over the left shoulder
  to fasten somewhere between that and the front. The hood was attached to that
  final loop of cloth, starting at the front left and ending with a tail of fabric
  that fastened to the right shoulder, meaning that the face was almost completely
  covered. This was extremely useful in winter storms, but the latest fashion
  was to wear cloaks of lighter fabrics in the summer. 
She checked her reflection in the mirror. The soft silk cloak was clearly
  expensive, but she'd avoided any distinctive embroidery. Yellows and oranges
  were very much in fashion, though having the two colours slowly merging into
  one another was a little more unusual. Only her eyes showed of her face between
  folds of orange silk. It would be impossible for anyone to recognise her. 
The folds of cloth swathed her entire body, so that it would be difficult
  for anyone to even guess at her build. Her money was in solid form, little
  chips held in a purse beneath the cloak. Paying this way would draw attention,
  but she didn't want electronic transfers traced back to her. No one would be
  able to know her as Lady Jedry. 
She imagined the scandal if she was discovered. Jerrin would do what he could
  to quieten things down and her work on the Alpha Team meant that she could
  always go back to Earth for a while if she needed to wait out an uproar. Still,
  there was no point in flaunting what she was planning. 
She picked her way to the door between piles of boxes waiting to be unpacked.
  She didn't bother locking the door behind her as she left. Most people wouldn't
  dare go into a royal bedroom and Jem wouldn't be bothered by locks if she wanted
  something. Jed headed to the transtube to get to the ground floor, a little
  surprised to find Jem in it. Jem was probably planning something illegal, given
  the way she pushed the portcomp she had been inspecting carefully out of sight.
  The youngest of the Queen's sisters was always planning some scheme or other. 
�You off out?� Jem asked. 
�No, I thought I'd just catch up with some reading.� Jed tried not to let
  the sarcasm have too much of a sting in it. �Where are you heading?� 
�Council chambers.� 
�Arriving late to meetings is one thing,� Jed grinned, �Arriving when the
  meeting's been over for three hours is something else.� 
�Don't ask what I'm up to and I won't ask what you're up to.� 
�Deal.� They shook on it, just as the doors to the transtube opened. They
  turned opposite directions, Jed heading for one of the many side doors that
  would let her out into the gardens so that she could reach the city without
  too many prying eyes seeing her. 
A guard who used to �not notice' as she sneaked sweets to her room as a child
  now saluted her formally as she passed. The universe changed. She still felt
  like that little girl, off to do mischief, but the rest of the world didn't
  see her that way anymore. She almost began to regret moving back into the palace,
  but she'd needed to get away from that house and it would take too long to
  try and buy a new one. She could always start looking. It wasn't as though
  she'd unpacked much anyway. 
She'd been surprised that she hadn't cried but now, thinking about it, maybe
  it wasn't that surprising. Their marriage had been over for years, she'd just
  blinded herself to it. Even living in the same house, a week could go by with
  them spending barely five minutes in each other's company. Alim would work
  late on his projects and she'd end up sleeping on the base after a mission
  too exhausting to make it home. Every time they'd tried to spend some time
  together, one of his projects would have a catastrophe or she'd be pulled onto
  an urgent mission with the Alpha Team by Jak and the Council. But now it was
  over. Done with. And Jed found her feet taking her to a place she hadn't visited
  since Alim had asked her to marry him, oh so long ago. 
The city around her was relatively quiet. There was always the buzz of conversation
  and thought and, as a telepath, she felt minds like lights in the darkness.
  Figures moved here and there, unaware of her. They made their way homewards
  or to private engagements, leaving her alone in the crowd. None of them knew
  the emptiness that ached inside her. None of them even spared her a glance. 
The stars overhead were pinpricks in the dark sky, forming patterns so familiar.
  She had been getting used to the constellations of Earth, but there was something
  comforting about the ones she had known since childhood. Behind her, the crystal
  spires of the palace rose above the buildings. Lit from within and without,
  they formed gleaming towers reaching up the heavens, refracting a rainbow over
  the dark city. In those towers, Jem was probably breaking into Council files
  and Jak was no doubt reading those same files unwillingly, preparing for tomorrow's
  meeting. Jerrin would probably be putting Helry to bed for the third time that
  night, trying to convince him to stay there until morning. Her family, content
  and unaware of the situation she was heading towards. 
The establishment was close enough to the bad side of town to be able to deal
  with the right type of customers, but close enough to the good side for it
  to attract the richer of the right type of customers. It didn't advertise itself
  with bright lights like everywhere else, knowing that the people who wanted
  this sort of place would know enough to find it. It didn't even have a real
  name. 
She stepped in through the door and stopped short. It wasn't the sight that
  had caused her to pause, but the sensation. More than a hundred minds, buzzing
  with emotion and need, sent out a wall of thoughts that even a weak telepath
  would be deafened by. Strong emotions caused strong thoughts, and lust was
  definitely a strong emotion. Words and images assailed her too rapidly and
  too many to be able to pick out a single mind in the mass. She let the sensations
  wash over her, until her mind got used to the din. 
�This isn't the sort of place for a nice young lady to be,� one of the doormen
  warned her. 
�Who says I'm a nice young lady?� And Jed walked across the room. 
On either side of her, men and women in various stages of undress performed
  acts that would have got them arrested in most evening entertainment sites.
  A strong-looking man was getting a spanking, pulled across the knee of a guy
  who would probably end up pulp if the two of them fought. Amazing how appearances
  were skewed in a place like this. 
It hadn't changed much. The faces had grown older or gone, replaced by newer
  ones with the same lust in their eyes and thoughts in their minds. Jed embraced
  that jumbled mix of wants like an old friend as she walked to the bar. Her
  eyes skimmed over bare flesh that held others entranced as it danced before
  them. A cross, away to one side, held a pale girl being beaten with a soft
  flogger clearly designed to mark more than hurt. 
Jed perched herself at the bar. The tender, still dealing with another customer,
  flashed her a smile. She was still shrouded in her cloak, but Mett was a half-decent
  telepath and had probably recognised the touch of her mind. Dressed in dark
  robes made of a material thin enough to hint at what was under them but leave
  enough to the imagination, it was a great pity Mett was taken. Green eyes under
  a fringe of dark curls, his face was delicately shaped enough to give him an
  innocent look. The wide, leather collar at his neck was proof that he was far
  from innocent. 
�The Bright Star has returned,� Mett smiled at her, �What can I get for you?� 
�Just a fruit juice,� Jed said. 
Mett mixed a variety of juices together, remembering what she liked without
  any need for a reminder. It could almost have been only yesterday that she
  was last in here, but for the words they spoke to each other. 
�Your nice husband not exciting enough for you anymore?� Mett asked. She'd
  never mentioned Alim's name, but Mett and the others knew why she'd stopped
  coming. 
�We ended the marriage,� she told him. 
�I'm sorry to hear that, but I'm sure there are plenty who won't be. I could
  probably name a dozen who'll be pleased the Bright Star is back on the market.� Bright
  Star was the name that had been given to her here, since she didn't want to
  be known by her real name. In a room dominated by black and red, with other
  colours only appearing in dark shades, she was a vivid splash of brightness. 
�If they've waited for me this long,� she said, �they can wait a little longer.� She
  could also think of a couple who would have loved to be with her. Ordry and
  Palth were two who would have liked to break her, make her a sub to them. But
  she wasn't interested in them. Their minds, behind faces carved and rugged,
  were slow and dull. She might like looks in her partners, but she craved a
  mind that was bright and brilliant, dancing in thoughts and feelings as she
  played. 
It was that which had attracted her to Alim. So unlike her usual types, with
  no interest in the Games she liked to play, his mind had shone like a beacon.
  She had made that mind dance with clever words and interesting talk, pretending
  to herself that it satisfied her almost as much. She doubted Alim would ever
  guess what she had sacrificed to be with him. She had loved him desperately,
  still did, but he would never be able to share this side of her. 
Jed unfastened her hood to drink the juice Mett gave her, but left it over
  her head, shadowing her features. She turned to admire the room, or rather
  the people in it. There was a lot of exposed skin and that which was covered
  was done so by material so thin or so tight that it might as well have been
  exposed. There were some who, like her, didn't want to recognised, shrouded
  in cloaks. Theirs tended to be black, and of material substantially less expensive
  than hers. 
She let herself enjoy the sights. So soon after Alim, she wasn't sure she
  wanted to start getting physical straight away. For now, she'd just watch the
  show that was on offer. The girl had been taken down from the cross and was
  being gently soothed by her master. In her place was a man with firm musculature
  and a great many marks from previous beatings. She suspected from the moans
  and the desire and desperation that was coming off him in waves that it was
  more than just a beating stimulating him. His front, hidden against the wall,
  was probably decorated by toys that would make him incredibly aroused. She
  wondered if he had a permanent master or would accept any dominant. If he wasn't
  claimed, she might try a bit of fun with him at some point. 
Suddenly Jed became aware that the thoughts of one person in the room were
  being strengthened, not by lust, but by another, stronger emotion. She focused
  in on that mind, locating the body it was connected to. A man, perched terrified
  on a chair, had a couple of thugs standing over him. He looked young and innocent,
  his thoughts frantic and darting, rising to be almost a scream. 
Mett and a few of the more telepathic in the room had noticed now. Jed quickly
  thought to Mett not to bother with the doormen, and went over to the thugs
  herself. 
�Look, I said no,� the scared guy was saying. 
�And we said yes,� thug number one replied, stroking the guy's cheek. The
  other went straight for the groin. 
�We can make it extremely pleasant,� said thug number two, �if you're nice
  about it. If not, well, we'll leave that to your imagination.� 
Jed felt her anger rise and moved so that she was standing behind the chair
  the guy was sitting on, staring at the thugs. The guy being hit on sent her
  a panicked look as she placed a protective hand on his shoulder, but she radiated
  calm. 
�He told you he's not interested. I suggest you leave him alone.� 
�You want to play instead?� Thug #2 leered at her. 
�Not with you. Now leave.� Thug #1 backed off. Maybe he'd seen her here before,
  maybe he was just freaked by how calmly she was facing them off. Thug #2 wasn't
  going to be quitting that easily though. 
�I think your pretty face would look good with a nice gag and a good tight
  collar.� 
�A gag wouldn't do much good,' she projected directly into his mind with considerable
  force, �now go, before I make it difficult for you to play ever again.' A telekinetic
  touch to his genitals was the most she could manage. Let him sense her telepathic
  strength and assume she had the same skill with telekinetics. No one here was
  going to know that she was absolutely hopeless at that particular ability. 
He took off quickly enough. The guy on the chair turned to look at her with
  gratitude, but his mind was still racing with fear. He looked so young and
  vulnerable. There were enough people attracted to that sort of image. Unfortunately,
  this guy had attracted the wrong ones. 
�You should go home,� Jed told him, �this isn't the place for you.� 
�What if,� the guy asked nervously, �what if they're waiting for me?� 
�I doubt they will be. Even so, I'll keep my mind open to you. If anything
  happens, call out.� 
�Thank you.� 
She watched him go, then headed back to the bar. Everyone in the room was
  carefully not watching her. She saw one submissive staring, though he looked
  down at the ground as soon as she turned in his direction. She watched him
  a little longer. He was good looking, pale brown hair long enough to be pulled
  back in a ponytail. He wore tight trousers and an overrobe tight across his
  chest but open from his flat stomach to the ground. There were no visible marks,
  but she couldn't see his back. 
�He's new,' Mett thought to her, �he's been once or twice. He's been into
  the back with a female dominant, but said �no' to a second time.' Which meant
  he liked females, or he wouldn't have said �yes' the first time and that he
  didn't have a permanent mistress. 
She sent her thoughts towards him and felt his mind. It wasn't particularly
  bright, which meant he wasn't talented telepathically, but his mind was old
  enough for her and his thoughts were quick and many. Intelligent then. And
  curious. His eyes flicked up briefly to see whether she was still watching
  and she beckoned him over. He crossed the room quickly and stood in front of
  her seat, eyes to the ground. 
�What's your name?� she asked him. 
�Danithry, my lady,� he answered. It was likely to be his real name. She didn't
  like being called �my lady' here, since she got enough of that at home. Still,
  she would correct him if she decided she liked him. 
�Are you looking for a new dominant?� 
�Yes, my lady.� 
�Long term or just for tonight?� 
�I cannot say if I would like someone to be my mistress again until we have
  had one night, my lady.� Cautious and honest, definitely a good sign. 
�Why were you staring at me?� Hopefully his answer to this question would
  be honest as well. 
�You were kind to that man.� 
�I've seen this happen time and again. Someone comes into this place, wanting
  to prove to themselves and others that they're strong and brave. They don't
  realise how it will affect them until they're inside and by then it's too late.
  If I hadn't been here, there would be plenty others to step up to his defence
  and plenty will remember those two thugs if they try to come back.� She didn't
  add that the fact she had acted would help re-establish her as someone to be
  respected. Everything in a place like this hinged on respect earned and respect
  given. Those thugs had forgotten that. 
�My lady?� he waited for permission before continuing. �Are you looking for
  long term or just one night?� She smiled to herself at the fact that he was
  brave enough to try asking questions with someone he didn't know and couldn't
  gage. 
�I have just come out of a very serious relationship,� she told him, �so I'm
  not certain yet that I want something permanent. I thought I would just see
  how things progress.� She took her drink, and her new companion, to one of
  the slightly more private alcoves around the edge of the room. It held a long,
  curved bench surrounding a circular table. It also afforded a good view of
  the cross. The same man was still strapped to it, his back now crimson with
  angry lines. He was moaning in desire and agony, need flowing from him in an
  intoxicating liquor. 
Jed turned her attention to Danithry. He was perched next to her, a little
  tense but not frightened. His nervousness could be attributed to not knowing
  how a new mistress would treat him, even one shown to be kind. A little sheltered
  from the prying eyes of the club, she lowered her hood fully from her head.
  Her face was less well known than her sisters' and she did everything she could
  to keep it that way. Certainly, he didn't seem to recognise her. 
She placed her hand on Danithry's back, rubbing it slowly. Beneath the tight
  overrobe, the muscles began to relax to her gentle ministrations. She felt
  no blemishes or scars but that was only to be expected since most dominants
  were careful and those who had been abused didn't often play submissive voluntarily
  again. Still, he didn't flinch away from her touch, which meant no bruises.
  She would have expected more nervousness from someone new to the game, so he
  either played gently or hadn't played in a while. 
�You see that man at the cross?� she murmured in his ear. He shifted a little. �Would
  you like to be strapped to it? Would you like me to mark you as mine? I could
  leave red trails across your back; kisses of pain.� Her fingers traced criss-crossing
  lines, allowing him to imagine the whip there. He moaned slightly, shifting
  again. She could see his interest in his trousers and his thoughts were racing.
  She caught a couple of the images that his rapid mind was projecting, finding
  them exciting. She just hoped he wasn't too disappointed when she took of her
  cloak since the body he'd imagined for her was a little too perfect to ever
  be achievable. 
�I could make you moan with desire. I could decorate you.� Here she moved
  her hand to his front, brushing over a nipple and causing a shiver to run through
  his body. �I could let toys torture you even as the whip caressed you. I could
  make you burn with the need to come, make you scream and beg for my permission
  and you would know that you could only do so at my pleasure.� 
�Please.� The single word was a startled gasp. She wasn't sure if it was because
  he wanted the fantasy to be made true or if he was so turned on by it that
  he was already asking for permission to come. He was certainly aroused already. 
It was a masterful work of timing. The man was even now being helped down
  from the cross. Jed took Danithry over to it. There were others who looked
  as though they had been intending to use it, but they were old enough customers
  to recognise Bright Star and step back. She removed his overrobe, but left
  him his trousers and his dignity. She'd been right about his back being unmarked.
  Pale, smooth skin was waiting for her touch. 
She strapped her submissive to the wooden bars, making sure the restraints
  were secure but that they wouldn't hurt him. There was a tiny spark of fear
  as she finished fastening him in, but it was quickly squashed by desire. 
�Are you new to the Game?' she thought to him, making sure that her words
  wouldn't be picked up by any of the other telepaths nearby. 
�I've played before,' he thought back, �but nothing very serious or intense.'
  She chose a soft flogger from the selection available, much like the one used
  on the girl earlier. The strands were flexible enough and smooth enough that
  they wouldn't hurt too much someone who she wasn't sure about. She didn't know
  his boundaries so she wasn't going to risk anything more severe. 
The first blow was a test, nothing too harsh. He arched away from the blow,
  but his desire remained unchanged. She searched his mind for that spark of
  fear, but was pleased that it dimmed at the second stroke rather than flared.
  His desire was a tide, pulled to its height as the strokes of the flogger danced
  across his back. Red lines burned on the whiteness, brilliant and so unbelievably
  desirable. His moans were intoxicating as he writhed in his restraints at the
  pleasure and pain she was causing. She didn't think she'd heard sounds so incredibly
  sexy in a long time. 
His desire came in waves like the sea, swelling with each stroke. With someone
  more experience or that she knew better, she might have switched to another
  toy and let that desire swell some more. She felt it wash over her with pride,
  knowing that she'd caused him to need like that. But he was new, and his need
  was beginning to bring his fear back, so she showed mercy. 
She unfastened the straps and helped him away to a seat, handing him back
  his robe. His breathing was heavy and his eyes dark was lust. The way he sat
  spoke volumes about the erection he needed to deal with. 
�I give you my full permission to come, but you may do so in private,� she
  smiled at him, �You did well and I would be glad to see you again.� 
�I'd like that, my lady.� 
�I don't know when I'll be next able to come back here. My work is� unpredictable.
  Thank you for tonight.� 
�Thank you, my lady.� 
Jed went to the bar to pay Mett for the use of equipment. Then she wrapped
  the hood about her head again and made for the door, all the time feeling Danithry
  watching her. She wasn't certain if she wanted anything serious after Alim,
  but she would gladly play with that excited young man again. 
She wandered home, her mind still on those marks across his back, his feverish
  moans that were unintelligible and yet so eloquent. Yes, she would like to
  see him again. 
The palace was still lit when she arrived, a great many windows showing figures
  still awake and working inside. The guards saluted her through and she headed
  for the transtube, only to be stopped by a familiar figure. Jak was hurrying
  towards her, her formal robe not disguising the fact that she wore jeans beneath
  it. 
�Alpha's needed back on Earth,� Jak told her, �We leave on the hour. Do you
  know where Jem is?� 
�Council chambers.� Jed had sought out Jem's mind before Jak had finished
  speaking. Jak sighed at the news. 
�You go and tell her. If I catch her doing something illegal again, I'll have
  to report her.� 
�Yes, ma'am.� Jed mock-saluted her older sister and headed off to find the
  youngest. It seemed dreamy recollections of her enjoyable evening would have
  to wait.
