      01: Sweet Ryoko   
William Parnell slammed the telephone back into its cradle and glowered at
  it. How dare that fucking moron  , he seethed, how dare
  he threaten him  ? Lawyers, the scum of the
  fucking planet!   
He picked the phone back up and dialled, fingers of his other hand angrily
  tapping on the desk top while he waited for it to be answered.  
'Hello?'  
'Listen, you dumb cunt,' he snapped as, Daphne, his ex-wife answered, 'don't
  think you're getting anywhere with that stupid lawyer of yours!'  
'I'm just following the process&hellip;'  
'You just do what I say! You're getting fucking nothing! I'll tie you up
  in court for fucking forever!'  
He slammed the phone back down and took a deep breath. Suddenly, he laughed,
  turned back to his computer screen and was happily examining the reservation
  listings when there was a tentative knock on the door and Fiona, one of the
  hotel staff opened it. 'What is it?' he snapped, not even bothering to look
  at her.  
'A woman has come about the job,' Fiona said quickly, eager to get out of
  the office.  
'What job?'  
'The upstairs maid's job we advertised,' Fiona explained patiently. He was
  fully aware, she knew, he just didn't want to spend money on another person
  if he could bully everyone into working extra shifts to cover the vacant position.  
'We don't need&hellip;'  
Fiona expected his resistance but took a deep breath. 'We do,' Fiona said
  firmly, surprising herself a little as all the staff knew what a ferocious
  temper Mr Parnell had. 'Doris is going on holidays soon and we won't be able
  to cope. Mr Parnell, we really need some one to help. She's outside and seems
  nice, really nice...'  
'Nice! I don't give a fuck how nice she is!  
Fiona winced. 'I mean, I think she'll be easy to get along with. Please talk
  to her, Mr Parnell.'  
'Ok, ok ,' he grumbled, 'I'll talk to her.' He turned around and looked out
  at the reception area through the open door. 'Fuck,' he said, 'she's a slant
  eye!'  
Fiona flushed and glanced out to see if the young Japanese woman heard but,
  luckily, she didn't appear to as she was seated near the stairs, staring impassively
  into space. 'Please, Mr Parnell, she may hear you,' Fiona urged in a whisper.  
'I don't give a fuck if she hears me or not,' Parnell snapped. 'This is my
  hotel and I can say what I like!  
'Yes, of course, Mr Parnell,' Fiona soothed.  
'How fucking old is she?' Parnell demanded, looking out into the reception
  area again.  
Fiona looked at the application form Ryoko had completed. 'She's twenty five&hellip;'  
'She doesn't look it, she looks younger but they all do, don't they.' I
      remember that whore in Tokyo&hellip;  Parnell shook his head
      slightly to erase the memory.  
Fiona silently rolled her eyes, waiting and finally, Parnell got to his feet.
  William Parnell was a big man and prided himself on keeping fit, working out
  with weights three times a week and believed he was big enough and strong enough
  to handle anyone, I don't take shit  , he said to himself
  often, from anyone! I can handle anybody!   
It was no surprise that he was a bully to everyone and that he had a constant
  turnover of staff. The hotel was the biggest employer in the small village
  and which had recently undergone a tourist resurgence and. As a result, the
  hotel was constantly full with tourists and travelling salespeople.  
 Ryoko sat waiting patiently, showing nothing on her face although she had
  heard the man clearly refer to her as slant eyes  . Her
  face was blank as she would put up with anything to get this job, now she had
  found him after all this time.  
This man had been the focus of her life for so long and she had almost given
  up hope of ever finding him. Ryoko had been involved in a travelling magic
  show, a small circus really without animals but had seen a photograph of Parnell
  in a newspaper advertisement for the hotel.  
It was a shock to see his face after all this time. Leaving the magic troupe
  in a hurry without a seconds thought, the train had taken her to the village
  and Ryoko had furiously thought for the journey how she would get close to
  her target. Ryoko had been planning her next move when she saw the advertisement
  for the position of hotel maid pinned on the community noticeboard in the village.  
Walking back to the railway station, Ryoko had changed her clothes in the
  ladies toilets and carefully redid her face so she appeared demure and innocent.
  It was something she could do quickly and was well practised.  
 And so William Parnell saw a sweet Japanese woman when he lumbered out,
  one who jumped respectfully to her feet and bowed to him, her eyes lowered.  
That appealed directly to Parnell's ego and he smiled, looking around to
  see if Fiona had noticed. I might hire a few slant eyes  ,
  he thought, if they all do that, adds a bit of class.   
'I'm Mr Parnell,' he said, towering over Ryoko. 'The boss,' he added meaningfully.  
Ryoko bowed again, telling herself to be calm and nodded. 'I am pleased to
  meet you, sir.' Her voice was soft and she exaggerated her accent just a little.
  'I am Ryoko Yuzuki.'  
'Yuzuki, isn't that a motorbike?' He laughed at his own joke and Ryoko pretended
  to be confused but said nothing. 'The job is to clean the rooms and I don't
  bargain about money. You've seen the job description?'  
Ryoko bowed again. 'Yes, thank you, sir. The kind lady showed it to me. I
  am happy with it, sir.'  
Parnell liked the way she called him sir   and nodded.
  'There is a maid's room upstairs and you'll have to work long hours,' he warned.  
'Of course sir, whatever is required.'  
He smiled down at her. S uch a cute little thing and so sweet,  he
  thought, and so respectful. She's nothing like the other clods I've
  got working here.  'Ok, when can you start?'  
'I can start now, sir, if you wish.'  
'Great. Fiona,' he bellowed and Fiona almost ran from the office. 'Show her
  the ropes and get her started.'  
'Thank you sir,' Ryoko said, bowing again. Parnell nodded and walked back
  into his office with a swagger and a grin.  
Ryoko watched him go through narrow eyes and then smiled at Fiona. 'The ropes?'  
Fiona laughed and led Ryoko upstairs. 'This is your room,' she said opening
  the door, 'it's not much but you've got a view.'  
Ryoko put her suitcase on the bed. 'It's good. Do I have to wear a uniform?'  
Fiona laughed. 'Could you see Parnell paying for uniforms? Not likely.'  
Ryoko smiled. 'I can wear what I like?'  
'Yes but be warned, Parnell is a sleaze.'  
'Sleaze?' Ryoko played dumb and Fiona smiled.  
'He's a groper and a bit of a sex fiend. I'm sure you've got them in Japan?'  
'Ah yes, we have all manner of sex fiends in Japan,' Ryoko said enigmatically.  
'I'm sure you do,' Fiona laughed. 'Let me show you what to do and where the
  cleaning stuff is.'  
'Have you shown her everything?' Parnell quizzed Fiona later in the day.  
'Yes Mr Parnell, she's a smart one.' Too smart for that job  ,
  she thought to herself, and she wrapped you around her finger  .  
'She'll be ok tomorrow when the customers go, she'll know what to do?'  
We call them guests  , Fiona wanted to point out but
  just shrugged. 'I think so.'  
'You notice she called me sir  ?' he said meaningfully
  to Fiona who almost rolled her eyes, knowing he wanted her to call him that.  
In your dreams  , she thought viciously. 'Must be an
  Asian thing,' she said and quickly left the office.  
Fiona was drawn upstairs, curious about the new maid, knocked softly on Ryoko's
  door and she immediately heard Ryoko call, 'yes?'  
'It's just me,' Fiona said, popping her head in and saw Ryoko putting clothes
  into the drawers. 'Settled in?'  
'Almost, thank you Fiona,' Ryoko said and Fiona picked up a piece of paper
  from the dresser top.  
'What's this, a magic show?' It was a flyer advertising the show and Ryoko
  silently cursed herself for leaving it out.  
'Yes, I was fortunate enough to work for a small while with them.'  
'Roberto the Magician, The Montrose,' Fiona read with a smile, 'what were
  the Montrose?'  
'Acrobats, I think the word is?'  
'Yes that's the word,' Fiona nodded and continued to read, 'the Great Akira,
  what was he?'  
'Hypnotist,' Ryoko said carefully. 'I am finished.'  
'Ok,' Fiona placed the flyer back down, 'I can show you the hotel grounds
  and where the staff eat?'  
'Thank you,' Ryoko was tempted to bow but thought Fiona was too smart to
  fall for that and just smiled.  
'What did you do in the magic show?'  
'I was just the person who cleaned and fixed things,' she lied.  
Fiona showed Ryoko the grounds including the tennis court and swimming pool.
  'Staff can swim in the morning or around lunch before the guests have settled
  in but the girls usually give it a miss.'  
'The girls do not swim?' Ryoko frowned as if she was trying to understand.  
'Not often. See that small house there with the hedge?' Ryoko nodded as Fiona
  pointed. 'That's where Parnell the pervert lives and the pervert comes out
  the moment we're in the water and fairly leers at us so we give it a miss.'  
'Ah, I see, the sex fiend,' Ryoko said and giggled prettily with a small
  hand covering her mouth.  
'Yes, the sex fiend,' Fiona said, laughing with her.  
'He is the, what do you call it, the manager?' Ryoko asked as they strolled
  past the kitchen gardens.  
'He's the owner.'  
Ryoko stopped. 'He owns all of this?' she asked slowly.  
'He won some money or so the rumour goes but Parnell never says where the
  money came from. Hewalked out on his wife and bought this reasonably cheap.
  Then the tourists suddenly began to come here and it's now a gold mine,' she
  said a little bitterly.  
Ryoko looked around and nodded. 'It is beautiful and it is his?'  
'Yes, believe it or not.'  
They walked on in silence until Ryoko asked, 'and why do the tourists now
  come?'  
'The mineral baths in the next village were renovated and they discovered
  some prehistoric artefacts near here. It's really an excuse for people to drive
  here and relax for a weekend. Travelling sales people pull off the motorway
  and stay here as well so Parnell does very well, the lucky bugger!'  
'Where did he get the money?'  
Fiona shrugged. 'It's all a mystery and he won't say. Hungry?'  
'I am, thank you.'  
Fiona introduced Ryoko to Doris the cook and Peter and George who looked
  after the gardens and acted as porters. The other casual staff had gone home.
  'How did you get on with Bill?' Doris asked Ryoko?'  
'I am sorry, Bill?'  
'Parnell. His friends call him Bill, although we would never dare to,' Doris
  said with a grin and everyone nodded.  
'He is fine, I think,' Ryoko said carefully.  
'Yeah, well watch him, he is,' Doris said with a glance, 'he has a thing
  for girls like you.'  
Ryoko acted surprised. 'Like me? What do you mean?'  
'Asian girls, he spent some time in Japan, I hear.'  
'He did? I did not know that,' Ryoko lied and smiled.  
'Ryoko used to work in a magic show,' Fiona volunteered.  
'Really?' Doris asked interested.  
'All sorts of people, hypnotists, acrobats and things like that,' Fiona went
  on.  
'That hypnotism stuff is bunkum,' Peter said sipping his tea, 'it's all rigged,
  isn't it?'  
'Oh no,' Ryoko said, 'it is not rigged, it is real.'  
'I saw the poster,' Fiona prattled on, 'what was his name, the hypnotist?'  
'Akira,' Ryoko said softly.  
'Was he your boyfriend?' Fiona asked suddenly.  
'Yes but we broke up,' Ryoko improvised.  
'Was he any good?' George asked and everyone laughed. 'I meant as a hypnotist!'  
'Akira was the best in Japan and had studied for five years with the secret
  masters.'  
'Why did he come here?' Peter asked.  
'Akira was searching for someone&hellip;'  
'Another girl, eh?' Doris said shrewdly. 'And then dumped you, what a prick!'  
'Men,' Fiona said emphatically and Peter and George shifted uncomfortably
  and then poured another cup of tea.

      02: Ryoko Teases   
Parnell was pleased at Ryoko's efforts on the first
  day. As usual, he stormed upstairs to check and to his surprise, found her
  with her cleaning cart working through the rooms.  
'You're here,' he said, taken aback.  
'Yes,' she said, 'I am not to be?'  
'No, no,' he said, 'this is right. You clean here,'
  he said in a loud voice as some people do when they speak to foreigners.  
Ryoko nodded, smiled and turned to retrieve some
  cleaning products from the bottom of the cart. She bent from the waist, not
  from the knees, and Parnell stared at her delectable bottom as she searched
  for something on the lower tray of the cleaning cart. Her denim skirt had risen
  and Parnell found himself staring at her thighs until Ryoko stood suddenly
  and turned to him. 'Is there something else, sir?'  
His face was red but he managed to mumble, 'no,
  nothing else, just clean the rooms.'  
Ryoko smiled as he walked off and hummed to herself
  as she began cleaning.  
'Ryoko is doing very well,' Fiona told Parnell
  as they stood at the reception desk checking guests out for the day, 'she'll
  be finished by lunch time.'  
'They're hard workers,' he grunted and there was
  no doubt in Fiona's mind what he meant by they  .  
'She's a pretty little thing.'  
'If you say so. Can you concentrate on the job?
  Here comes the other guests.' She was pretty,  Parnell
  thought, Asian women are  and flushed a little, his cock
  stirring when he remembered how he almost saw up her skirt.  
By lunchtime, the rush of out going guests had
  declined and the hotel became quieter as the staff prepared for the incoming
  guests that would arrived later in the afternoon.  
Parnell usually began work before six in the morning
  to assist those guests who wished to check out early, worked through and then
  went to his house for a shower and a little nap before returning for the incoming
  customers.  
After his shower, he stood at his kitchen window
  drinking some juice and saw Ryoko by the pool. Parnell froze when he saw her
  in a brief pink bikini made from some shiny material and he gaped at her body.
  It was a cloudy day, reasonably warm but Ryoko wasn't wet so she hadn't, Parnell
  realised, been swimming and was lying on a towel.  
He couldn't help himself and walked outside, standing
  behind the hedge and looking at her. She had sunglasses on and Parnell guessed,
  no hoped, Ryoko had her eyes closed behind the dark glass. Thankfully, the
  hedge concealed the erection that pushed uncomfortably against his trousers.  
I haven't had some Asian  ,
  he remembered, since I pounded the mattress all night with that whore
  in Tokyo.  That had been some years previously and Parnell thought
  he had his desire for Asian women safely under control but now a glimpse of
  Ryoko proved him wrong.  
Ryoko suddenly looked up, leapt to her feet and
  walked over to the hedge and Parnell tried to tear his eyes away from her approaching
  breasts.  
'Sir,' she said with some concern, looking up at
  him and Parnell saw himself reflected in her sunglasses, 'it is right for me
  to swim? I thought it was so but I apologise if I have broken rules&hellip;'  
'No, it's fine,' he grunted and his cock, on the
  other side of the hedge, remained hard.  
'Thank you sir,' Ryoko said softly, bowing and
  Parnell glanced down at her bikini bottoms as she bent over. She smiled at
  him when she rose and he had a sudden image of her sucking his cock, just like
  he made that Tokyo whore suck, flicker behind his eyes. 'I go swim.'  
'Yeah,' he muttered and watched her bounce away.  
The incoming guests flooded the hotel and they
  worked hard until the rush subsided. 'Virtually full,' Fiona said, 'except
  for 201.'  
'What's wrong with 201?'  
'Ryoko reported the light in the bathroom was faulty.
  We've called for&hellip;'  
'Wasn't that just fixed?' Parnell snapped.  
'I don't remember&hellip;'  
'There's nothing wrong with that light! Ryoko!'
  His bellow echoed down the hall and Fiona winced as a few passing guests looked
  at them.  
 Ryoko suddenly appeared, bowing. 'Sir?'  
'What's wrong with 201?'  
'Ah, the light, the hanging one in the bathroom?
  It is loose&hellip;'  
'Bullshit!'  
'I will show you, sir?'  
He climbed the stairs behind her, eyes on her bottom
  and followed her into the room. 'Looks fine,' he said, staring up at the hanging
  light.  
'If you swing it, sir, you will see, I think. I
  am not as tall as you&hellip;'  
Parnell reached up and set the hanging bulb swinging
  just as Ryoko switched on the light. Instead of the normal yellow light, the
  bulb was a subdued emerald green. 'What the&hellip;' Parnell stopped himself
  in time and looked up at the swinging light.  
'See how it is, sir,' Ryoko said in a soft voice
  that was strangely persistent, 'green and different&hellip;as it swings from
  side to side from side to side&hellip;'  
'Yes,' he murmured, 'it's not right. It must be&hellip;'  
'Reach up and swing it a little more, softly back
  and forth, back and forth.' Ryoko kept talking and Parnell's eyes slowly drifted
  out of focus. 'It's a soft green light, a comfortable light, a relaxing light,
  it is a tiny sleepy light, do you see it?'  
'Yes, sleepy light&hellip;'  
'The sleepy light is making you sleepy.'  
Ryoko was working fast in case somebody came upstairs
  to see what was taking them so long. She just wanted to test Parnell's susceptibility
  to hypnosis and see how easily she could put him under.  
Parnell's eyes closed, he was breathing deeply
  and Ryoko smiled happily. It seemed easy to drop him down into the first level
  but it wasn't enough for imprints that she applied to be permanent. Chemical
  assistance was required for permanent imprinting but, nevertheless, Ryoko could
  lay down a simple suggestion as long as it coincided with his own desires.  
Ryoko knew exactly what to do as she had seen the
  way he looked at her.  
'Bill?' she whispered, 'can you hear me?'  
'Yes,' he murmured.  
'Do you remember Ryoko?'  
'Yes, hot Jap bitch.'  
Ryoko smiled and delicately checked Parnell's pulse
  before continuing.  
'Yes, Ryoko is hot, she's very sexy, isn't she?'  
'Yes&hellip;very sexy.'  
'Every time you see her, you get hard, don't you?'  
'Yes, hard.'  
'Really hard, the moment you see her.'  
'Yes.'  
'You want to come so badly, to spurt so much when
  you see her, don't you?'  
'Oh yes&hellip;yes.'  
'You want to masturbate when you see her, to play
  with yourself, don't you?'  
'Yes, I want to jerk off when I see Ryoko.'  
'But that is wrong, isn't it, Bill? That is bad.'  
'Bad?'  
'You can play with your dickie as much as you like
  but you shouldn't come unless Ryoko says you can, can you?  
'But, I want to come when I see her&hellip;'  
'Of course you do, you want to come so badly when
  you see her, don't you?'  
'Yes, when I see her in that swimsuit&hellip;'  
'It is a sexy swimsuit, isn't it?'  
'Very sexy&hellip;sexy Jap bitch.'  
'Ryoko has a sexy body&hellip;'  
'&hellip;sexy body&hellip;want to come when I see
  her&hellip;'  
'When you see her in her swimsuit, you want to
  masturbate&hellip;'  
'Yes, I want to wank when I see her in that swimsuit&hellip;sexy
  body&hellip;'  
It is Ryoko's body, she owns it and she gives permission,
  doesn't she?'  
'Permission?'  
'Permission to come and you do  want
  to come when you see her in her sexy swimsuit, you want to come so much&hellip;'  
'So much&hellip;want to come&hellip;must jack off&hellip;'  
 '&hellip;yes, when you see her in that tiny bikini
  but Ryoko must  tell you to come.'  
'Yes, Ryoko must   tell me
  to come&hellip;'  
'You can't come unless Ryoko says  you
  can, can you?'  
'I can't come unless Ryoko says  I
  can&hellip;'  
Ryoko smiled. That was enough to see if the imprint
  was successful and she began to bring him out of it, switching the light off
  just as Parnell opened his eyes.  
'Sir, as you can see, it does not work.'  
'No,' Parnell mumbled, 'it doesn't.'  
Ryoko smiled up at him and, to his horror, Parnell
  felt his cock blossom into an incredibly hard erection and he was swamped with
  the desire to come.  
'Sir?' Ryoko asked with concern, 'are you all right?'  
'Yes,' he said thickly, fighting the urge to pull
  his cock out of his pants, 'you go downstairs and help Fiona.'  
'Fiona? On the desk? But&hellip;'  
'Go! Now!'  
Ryoko bowed solemnly and left the room. Fiona looked
  up when she saw Ryoko walking down the stairs alone, giggling.  
 'What's so funny?'  
'Mr Parnell was so sure the light was fine and
  now he is embarrassed.'  
'He's an idiot,' Fiona pronounced.  
'He said for me to help you.'  
'He did?' Fiona shrugged. 'Ok, let me show you
  what to do.'  
Parnell shut the door the moment Ryoko left, dropped
  his pants and closed his hand around his cock. Fuck,  he
  moaned softly, that feels great  . Slowly, he began to
  jerk off, visualising Ryoko in her bikini, sniffing the air for traces of her
  perfume as he prepared to come.  
Frantically, he pumped his rigid cock, wanting
  more than anything to come but, for some unexplainable reason he couldn't'!
  Sure, he came close, hovered on the edge but just couldn't come! Face streaked
  with perspiration, Parnell gave up and stared at his red and swollen cock and
  wondered what was wrong.  
Pulling his trousers around his ankles, he shuffled
  to the hand basin, ran the cold water tap and splashed his cock to make the
  erection vanish.  
Fiona watched him come down the stairs. 'Are you
  all right?'  
'Yes, why?' he asked suddenly worried that she
  knew what he had just tried to do.  
'You look red in the face.'  
'I've been sick, something I ate.'  
'Oh.'  
'Where's Ryoko?'  
'She's showing the last of the guests to their
  room. She's very good with people&hellip;'  
'Yeah, yeah,' Parnell cut her off. 'I'm going home
  to get some rest.'  
The next day, Ryoko was in the pool again and Parnell
  stared at her through the window, his cock hard and throbbing in his trousers.
  He had tried to masturbate the previous night and again that morning but he
  couldn't reach orgasm. He was so worried, Parnell was actually considering
  going to a doctor.  
Something pushed him to get a closer look at Ryoko,
  to see her and he walked out, glass of orange juice in his hand. His cock pulsed
  into full hardness immediately he saw she was dressed in the same tiny pink
  bikini. She waved to him and he slowly waved back.  
Fuck  , he silently screamed, I
      need to come! Look at her, she's fucking gorgeous!  He was filled
      with the need to come, a need so powerful he felt weak and passive and
      it took all his inner strength not to fall to his knees, whip his cock
      out and jerking to a wonderful orgasm! To come would be fantastic,
      I need to!   
Standing behind the hedge, his hand was absently
  fondling himself through his trousers when Ryoko suddenly stood up and began
  to walk towards him. It took all his willpower but, desperately he tore his
  hand away and smiled weakly at Ryoko.  
 She smiled before bowing. 'Excuse, but could I
  use your bathroom?' Her voice was soft, he could suddenly smell her perfume
  and even though it was a strange request, one he would have normally rejected
  outright, he gulped and said, 'ok.'  
Ryoko smiled to herself and pushed the small gate
  open and walked to the house, feeling Parnell's eyes on her bikini bottom so
  she wriggled just a little more than usual.  
'And where is it?' Ryoko asked and Parnell was
  so overcome he didn't even notice that she no longer called him sir  .  
'Upstairs,' he said thickly, trying to tear his
  face away from hers, 'first on the left.'  
He watched her walk slowly and tantalisingly up
  the stairs, turn left and vanish. I need to come  , the
  words thundered inside him and his trembling hand stroked his cock through
  his trouser cloth, I do, I do!   
Ryoko opened the door to the bathroom and checked
  her face in the mirror. She had no need to use the toilet, just a need to get
  inside the house to see if the imprint worked completely. Knowing that her
  implanted suggestion would fade soon, this was her last chance to verify he
  was suggestible and a candidate for her plans, plans she had dreamed of for
  so long.  
Knowing that Parnell was downstairs fighting his
  urges, Ryoko took a little time to peek into all the upstairs rooms. 'This
  is nice,' she said softly, 'I will enjoy it all.'  
 Parnell was in a sweat, his heart was pounding
  and his cock straining against his pants as he heard Ryoko move around upstairs. Steady  ,
  he cautioned himself, wait until she goes, then jerk off, come at
  last!   
 And then she appeared at the top of the stairs
  in that shiny pink bikini! He tried to smile, to say something but stared at
  her open mouth, his cock throbbing and he didn't even notice that he was stroking
  himself through his trousers.  
Ryoko smiled and pushed her pubis forward a little,
  a hand on the banister as she smiled down at him, noticing his eyes were focussed
  on her crotch, his hand moving over his own groin.  
She took a step down and stopped, Parnell staring
  open mouth as the weakness flooded over him, he gave into the desire and began
  rubbing himself furiously through his pants.  
Her eyes locked on his and even though he was overcome
  with deep desire and humiliation, he detected a strange smile playing on her
  full lips.  
He imagined that her sensual voice penetrated his
  clogged mind and he quivered uncontrollably when he thought she whispered,
  'take it out, Bill, take dickie out.'  
Parnell's fingers fumbled with his belt and then
  his fly but he managed to push his trousers and underwear down around his knees
  so his hand could wrap around his aching cock. He was so lost in his passion,
  his desire that Ryoko's voice was nothing more than a whisper. 'Kneel, Bill
  so you can come.'  
Gratefully, he stumbled to his knees, frantically
  pulling his cock, lost in a stupor as he worked until Ryoko's soft voice insinuated
  itself inside him to whisper, 'come for me, Bill, come for Ryoko.'  
'Christ!' Parnell moaned as he felt the orgasm
  building, knew  &ndash; how he didn't know &ndash; but knew  he
  was going to come at last and was completely lost in the finally welcome pleasure.  
Ryoko smiled down at the kneeling man, watching
  as he frantically jerked off and knew he was the perfect candidate for her
  plans. You fool  , she thought, you arrogant
  fool!   
'Fuuuck!!' Parnell came in a torrent, spurting
  onto the carpet, large white spots on the pile and Ryoko resolved, that once
  this house was hers, she would have that carpet removed. The thought of walking
  everyday over the carpet he  had come on was too distasteful
  to even contemplate.  
Parnell gradually came out of his stupor and was
  dismayed to find himself half naked on his knees, with his shrinking cock in
  his hand after coming on the hall carpet. To make matters worse, Ryoko was
  standing in front of him, hands clasped to her horrified face, eyes wide.  
'Mr Parnell!' Ryoko shrieked and Parnell blinked. What
      the fuck was I doing!  'You are filthy man! I will tell police!'  
Parnell tried to understand what was happening
  as Ryoko scurried past him, her bottom wobbling for a second before his face
  as she rushed past and wondered how he was going to get out of this.  
'No! Please don't call the police!'  
Ryoko stood at the doorway, covering her eyes with
  a hand but he thought she was peeking through her fingers. 'Please sir, please
  cover.'  
'Yes,' Parnell mumbled, struggling with his clothes,
  'yes of course&hellip;sorry.'  
'You are a bad man!'  
'Yes,' he mumbled, 'look&hellip;I don't know&hellip;'  
'Bad man!'  
'I'm sorry&hellip;I don't know what happened&hellip;'  
'You do bad thing!'  
'Yes&hellip;I know&hellip;I did, please, can we
  talk about this? There's no need to go to the pol&hellip;'  
'Very bad man!'  
Ryoko ran from the house, trying to stifle her
  giggles but, by the time she got to her room and fell onto her bed, she was
  laughing loudly at her first victory.
