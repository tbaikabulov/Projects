&nbsp;

Part 1 � The Origin of the New Order

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

On January 1st,
 2125, the Western World became a dictatorship - the female gender
had become totally dominant over all males.

It had been developing for a very long time; the
suffragettes of the early 1900�s; the Women�s Liberation Movement of the 1970�s;
by the late 1970�s the World bore witness to the female standing in one of the
most powerful positions on Earth and over the next two decades, females had
become captains of industry, supervisors of male employees, managers and often
it was the male who stayed at home looking after the children whilst the woman
went out to work to become the breadwinners. 

The roles had become reversed � women no longer required
men! 

Divorces became commonplace and escalated to the point where
marriage had almost become a futile undertaking. 

By 2050, women were using men purely for procreation and for
sexual pleasure before discarding them.

By 2100, the male was the servant of the female, where
obedience was a socially accepted norm and resistance was met with great social
ostracism, even from other males.

In 2125, feminist advocate and politician, Elena Sterling
was elected President of the Western Hemisphere. 

President Sterling�s election resulted in a new reformation
of society � an official recognition of the modern way of life, but in a much
more regimented way than it had been. New laws had been introduced to reflect,
not only the concept of female superiority and male subservience, but also the
beliefs of the new leader � a feminist who had always been concerned about
another male uprising. Being a highly educated politician and historian, she
knew what the World had offered under male reign: war, violence, terrorism,
brutality towards women � women who were regarded as subservient, even by man�s
religions; religions which President Sterling believed were created by
chauvinistic men who had the audacity to claim that they had the� endorsement of an all-powerful God. For this
reason, all major world religions were banned from the lands over which she
ruled.� 

Elena Sterling also strongly believed that a man�s sexual
behaviour must, at all costs be kept under control. The male instinct, she
believed, was for him to use a woman�s body for his own sexual gratification
and then to discard her before doing likewise to his next �conquest�, by means
of his charming and manipulative words beforehand - subsequently leaving a
trail of heartbreak and trauma in his wake. 

Elena Sterling considered that from now on, a relationship
would be initiated by the woman, for the woman and for the purpose of serving
the woman and if she wished to marry her servant-partner then that would be her
decision to make and purely her decision. 

Using this method of approach, the President had effectively
revived and re-defined the concept of marriage; however there were certain laws
which she had to introduce in order to maintain control.

She considered that the male tendency to engage in lustful
thoughts about women to be a form of �mental rape� and that all sexual activity
engaged in by a male outside of a marriage or partner ship was now illegal
fornication, punishable by physical sanctions.

Orgasm was for the pleasure of women; males were only permitted
to ejaculate under the merciful permission of their wives or partners. 

Under the new law:

Male masturbation and sex outside of a relationship were
criminal offences as was the possession by any male of erotica which contained
the images of naked women.

The President was extremely eager to stamp out masturbation
and fornication at any cost and introduced new measures to ensure that such
activity was curtailed. For this reason, she ordered the 24 hour surveillance
of men with random urine tests in street booths and at Police road blocks.

Semen would be discovered in the urine under testing. If
ejaculations had not occurred for several weeks, then the sperm count in the
semen would be high. If it was low, then this may be evidence of illegal orgasm
in which case the suspect would be taken in for testing on the off chance that
he may have a low sperm count by nature. If he was found guilty of masturbation
after testing he would be sentenced to a flogging on the spot with either a
whipping of 24 lashes or 36 strokes of a cane � the choice was his!

Many men offered the defence of involuntary nocturnal
emissions during sleep but this was rejected by congress on the grounds that
wet dreams were the product of a lustful mind and were evidence of mental rape.
If a man were to purify his mind and soul to the worship of the female, then
his body would not feel the desire to violate her in this barbaric manner.

The technology which was in place for testing a man in order
to discover whether or not he had experienced an illegal orgasm was most
ingenious and subjected the suspect to the most ecstatic and yet torturous
procedure. 

By the year 2127 � two years after the reformation, all law
enforcement officials and anyone in any position of authority were female. This
was not to say that all women who were in a position of authority actually
approved of Elena Sterling�s new regime and her severe sanctions. Most actually
administered discipline for illegal orgasm only to retain their employment.
Most Police officers were quite disturbed by the new cruelty-requirements of
their vocation and saw no justification for such barbarity. 

However, the Law was the Law!

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Part 2: The Test

&nbsp;

Charlie Slade was 27 years of age, attractive, athletic,
intelligent, lived in Texas and
worked as a bar tender at a local club. This was a taxing occupation; it was
extremely hard work serving the crowds of incredibly demanding women � all of
whom saw fit to attire themselves in scanty, revealing clothing, whilst Charlie
was permitted no sexual relief, due to the new regulations. It was torture for
him, as indeed it was torture for all males.

Many failed in obeying the Law!

One Saturday morning, Charlie decided to depart from his habitation
unit in the suburbs to venture out into an old rural area on his hover-scooter
� a relatively inexpensive form of transport which rarely reached more than 30 MPH
and was electrically powered.

Charlie liked the countryside, especially on a bright, hot
summer�s day like this one; it offered peace and quiet and a chance to enjoy
the illusion that he was free. Of course he wasn�t free. Charlie like all other
men was a prisoner of sorts; a prisoner totally at the mercy of the opposite
gender.

&nbsp;

As Charlie was riding out of town, just on the outskirts,
his scooter turned a corner to be confronted by a Police road block.

A young, blonde, very beautiful uniformed Police officer
raised her hand for him to stop. Charlie could feel his heart beginning to
pound. They were so intimidating and so socially powerful.

He dutifully stopped and pulled up in front of the officer.

&nbsp;

�Please, step away from the scooter, sir!� She ordered.

&nbsp;

Charlie complied.

&nbsp;

�This is a random urine test,� she said in an officious but
professional manner. �Are you in a marriage or partnership at present, sir?�

&nbsp;

�No, ma�am,� he replied. 

&nbsp;

�Would you like to come this way with me please, sir!�

&nbsp;

It was not a question, it was a command. The officer led
Charlie into a mobile testing unit which had been set up on the road side. Once
inside, the officer handed Charlie a specimen bottle and led him behind a
curtain in order for him to urinate into it in private.

&nbsp;

�Take as long as you need, sir,� said the officer as she
left Charlie to his privacy.

&nbsp;

Charlie didn�t need long. He was extremely nervous and
nerves always gave him the urge. Once he had provided his specimen he went back
to the officer who took the bottle from him, before locking the door from the
inside and taking the bottle into the next room for testing.

Once Charlie was locked in the one section of the mobile
unit, the officer handed the specimen to a nurse who poured the contents into
an analyser.

Charlie waited nervously for thirty minutes when finally the
officer returned holding a scroll of computer readout paper.

&nbsp;

�Have you engaged in either illicit sexual converse or
solitary masturbation within the last three weeks, sir?� She asked.

&nbsp;

�N-n-no, ma�am,� replied Charlie. He lied; six days ago, he
could bear it no longer and chanced relieving his loins of their torment in his
bed.� 

&nbsp;

�Well,� continued the officer. �Your test appears to
indicate a slightly lower-than-expected concentration of sperm cells, sir. Do
you know if this is normal for you?�

&nbsp;

�I-I-I don�t know ma�am.� 

&nbsp;

�If you confess now, sir,� said the officer. �You will be
eligible for a lesser penalty.�

&nbsp;

Charlie simply could not bring himself to admit to this
beautiful woman that he had masturbated. It was too shameful.

&nbsp;

�N-n-no ma�am, I haven�t done anything like that.�

&nbsp;

�Well, in that case,� said the officer, �I�m afraid I am
going to have to place you under arrest for suspected illegal orgasm.� She
produced a pair of electrum-shackles and secured Charlie�s hands behind his
back with them.

&nbsp;

�You are now going to be taken to Police headquarters where
you will undergo an orgasm reflex test.� And with that, she led him outside and
handed him over to another officer, also attractive with short black hair
visible from beneath her uniform cap.

&nbsp;

�This man is for testing, Julia,� she said.

&nbsp;

�Ok, I�ll take him in,� replied the other officer.

&nbsp;

As the blonde officer handed him over, she gave Charlie a
sympathetic look and offered him one, apparently sincere wish:

&nbsp;

�Good luck, sir.�� ���

��

**********************************************************

Charlie was taken to Police headquarters, asked for all of
his identification, asked again about his single status and was DNA-scanned.

Following this induction procedure, he was led into a small
laboratory several corridors away into the heart of the building. Once inside,
he was asked to strip naked and informed that a Police nurse would be with him
shortly to provide the test.

And with that he was locked inside the laboratory to await
his fate.

&nbsp;

Twenty minutes after he had stripped naked, the lab door was
opened and a very attractive nurse with shoulder length dark blonde hair
entered. She appeared to be in her late 30�s and wore a white lab coat.

She smiled warmly at Charlie who was understandably nervous
and covering his genitalia with his hands.

&nbsp;

�Mr. Slade?� She asked.

&nbsp;

�Y-yes,� replied Charlie.

&nbsp;

�I have you down for an orgasm reflex test. Would you like
to step over there please?� She motioned towards a chair which offered a �V�
shaped leg rest with what appeared to be a sophisticated-looking cylinder
attached to a semi-circular, toothed metallic ratchet mechanism, positioned
just below where the groin would be placed if anyone were to sit in the chair.

The chair arms had leather wrist straps at the end and two
ankle straps were attached to the front two legs of the chair.

The chair itself was securely bolted to the ground.

&nbsp;

Charlie did as he was asked.

&nbsp;

�Please take a seat in the testing chair, sir?� She politely
instructed him.

&nbsp;

Charlie obeyed and sat with his legs parted along the �V�
shaped leg rests, still holding his hands over his manhood.

The nurse came over to him and took his left wrist, rested
it on the armrest and pulled the straps tightly around it, followed by his
right � removing it away from his penis and appearing to be most unconcerned
about the young man�s nakedness.

Charlie felt his cheeks begin to flush.

The nurse bent down and secured his ankles to the legs of
the chair and then proceeded to walk over to a deck to the right of the chair
which was covered with computer screens, monitors and sensory devices the likes
of which, Charlie had no comprehension of. 

She activated the system and the entire panel appeared to
light up.

The nurse returned to Charlie and reached behind the chair
to find a handful of wires with electrodes attached to each one.

She attached one each to Charlie�s temples and four across
his chest.

The neurotransmitter and cardio-monitors immediately
detected Charlie�s life-readings.

&nbsp;

�Now, sir,� said the nurse. �We will begin. The object of
the test is to assess if you have experienced an orgasm within the last three
weeks. If you haven�t then your orgasm response will be evident before the
tester has stimulated you for sixty seconds.�

&nbsp;

�I-I don�t quite understand,� said Charlie, nervously.

&nbsp;

��Well,� continued the
nurse. �If you have not had any sexual relief in the last three weeks, your
testosterone will be very high and you penis will be highly sensitive to sexual
stimulation. If your reflex occurs past sixty seconds, you will have failed the
test.�

&nbsp;

She smiled at him sympathetically.

&nbsp;

�Now, I am going to have to bring you to erection before I can
start the test, alright?�

&nbsp;

�S-s-sure, I-I suppose so.� Charlie�s mind was in a daze and
he really did not know what to say.

&nbsp;

Was all of this really happening to him?

&nbsp;

The nurse reached into her pocket and drew out a bottle of
lubricant. She took hold of Charlie�s penis and began to masturbate him gently.
At the first sign of his penis beginning to stir, she stopped to pour some
lubricant into her hands and then resumed the stimulation.

Charlie could not refrain from uttering a groan of pleasure
as the nurse�s oiled hand slowly stroked his stiffening member up and down
until it was as hard as bone.

&nbsp;

�You have a very large penis, sir,� she volunteered in a
very clinical and professional manner. The line was not delivered with any
emotion at all.

&nbsp;

�I am sure that you will make a lady very happy with you,
one day.�

&nbsp;

�Thank you,� replied Charlie through laboured breathing, as
this beautiful woman�s oiled hand continued to pleasure him. 

Once he had reached maximum solidity, the nurse removed her
hand and reached below to collect the curious-looking chrome cylindrical device
which was connected to the �C� shaped ratchet mechanism with cogs. She curled
it upwards and slid the cylinder up to its top position via a slide to which it
was attached at the top of the ratchet. The cylinder now rested just above the
top of Charlie�s quivering erection.

The nurse took the bottle of lubricant and squirted a
generous amount into the opening of the cylinder before using her fingers to
spread it around the inside and sliding the cylinder down to completely swallow
Charlie�s phallus.

Charlie groaned. 

It was warm and sponge-like inside the slippery cavern �
exactly like a vagina!

The nurse wiped her hands on a pre-prepared towel as she
walked over to the monitor panel and activated a switch which caused a timer
clock to appear on one of the screens; once completed she walked back over to
Charlie.

&nbsp;

�We�re all set now,� she said, quite warmly. �Are you ready
for the test to begin, sir?�

&nbsp;

Charlie nodded reluctantly, and with that the nurse lightly
touched a sensor on the top of the cylinder � the test had begun!

&nbsp;

�Good luck!� She bid him sincerely.

&nbsp;

The counter on the monitor began simultaneously and Charlie
gasped as a sensation like no other swept through him. The cylinder vibrated with
incredible power around his solid erection whilst a rippling effect slid up and
down his member with vigorous but gentle pressure � the perfect pressure in
fact, feeling exactly like masturbation. It was the ultimate delight; a
three-way pleasure - �being masturbated by an intensely
vibrating, warm, wet vagina.

&nbsp;

�Aaahhhh......� moaned Charlie; never in his life had he
experienced such an intense level of pleasure.

The nurse returned to the monitors and observed the count on
the screen; 0.22, 0.23, 0.24 � and so on.

Charlie continued to thresh around in his bonds eagerly
trying to thrust himself even further into this divine, sensational instrument
only to discover that it already had all of him.

By 49 seconds he began to experience an unmistakable
stirring within his loins approaching. It seemed like an eternity as it built
up to a crescendo � the undeniable sensation of orgasm and the approach of the
ejaculation of sperm.

&nbsp;

�Ohhhhhhh..........m-my G-God.......aaaaahhhhhhhhh........�� 

&nbsp;

Charlie prepared to unleash his seed into the cylinder, so
possessed by the pleasure was he, that he was no longer conscious that this
was, in fact a test, which, if failed would reward him with a severe flogging.

Just at the crucial moment � at the very instant that he was
going to ejaculate, all stimulation suddenly ceased, leaving Charlie in a
desperate state of frustration. The stimulator was programmed to de-activate at
the split-second prior to ejaculation, as assessed by the sensors to which
Charlie�s heart-rate and cerebral activity were connected.

The nurse waited as a strip of printout paper emerged from a
printer close to the monitor; the monitor which displayed: 1.03.

&nbsp;

�Please, Miss,� begged Charlie. �Please let it finish.
PLEASE!�

&nbsp;

�I�m sorry, Mr Slade,� she replied. �You know that I can�t
do that.�

&nbsp;

Charlie whimpered with frustration as the nurse walked out
of the room with the printer readout, leaving him strapped to the chair with
his manhood firmly affixed in the bizarre stimulation device.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

����������������������������������� **********************************************

&nbsp;

After 25 minutes which seemed like 25 years to Charlie, the
nurse returned to him with a grave look on her face.

&nbsp;

�I�m sorry, Mr. Slade,� she said. �But I�m afraid that you
have failed the orgasm reflex test. You were so close as well. Only 3 seconds
over. The results were faxed over to the Judge and she ordered an immediate
sentence.�

&nbsp;

�What is going to happen to me?� asked Charlie, with notable
fear in his voice.

&nbsp;

�You are to be flogged,� she replied. �You may choose
between 36 strokes of the cane or 24 lashes from the whip.�

&nbsp;

Charlie shuddered. Recently a friend of his had been caned for
illegal orgasm and Charlie had seen the mess which the attending officer had
made of his buttocks. Could the whip really be as bad as that?

&nbsp;

�You may also choose whether I administer your flogging,�
said the nurse. �Or would you rather one of the other officers administer it?� 

&nbsp;

As an Officer of the Law, she had the authority to
administer discipline to any convicted male. The fact that she was a Police nurse was irrelevant in this era.

&nbsp;

Charlie considered it for a moment; this nurse did seem
quite compassionate. Perhaps she wouldn�t be as brutal as the officer who had
caned his friend.

&nbsp;

�I-I would like you to do it, Miss,� he said.

&nbsp;

�Ok,� replied the nurse with a warm and sympathetic smile
and walked over to him, removed his electrodes, slid the cylinder off of his
mammoth penis which was still erect and placed her hand on her Tazer
ultra-sound weapon before releasing Charlie from his bonds.

&nbsp;

�This way please,� she asked and motioned Charlie towards a
door which was just behind and to the right of the chair. She opened it and
Charlie, shivering with apprehension entered, the nurse following behind him,
her weapon now trained on her victim.

&nbsp;

Oh, my God! She
thought to herself with regret. You poor
man; what a cruel regime I work for! 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Part 3: The Penalty.

&nbsp;

The nurse led Charlie into the room and immediately it
became illuminated with electric lightning to reveal a fairly bare interior aside
from a plush carpeted floor with walls of dim, white, illuminated panels of
Perspex; a thick, fibre glass white �X� shaped apparatus in the centre of the
room which sported two sets of shackles; one set at the top on each side for
the wrists and one set at the bottom for the ankles. 

In front of the �X� frame was a beautiful chromium holder
for one cat o� nine tails, one bullwhip and a pile of canes.

&nbsp;

Charlie shuddered!

&nbsp;

�Please come this way, sir,� said the nurse pointing to the
frame. Charlie complied and the nurse asked him to raise his arms up to the
wrist shackles whilst holding her ultra-sound weapon, however not training it
directly on Charlie.

&nbsp;

Once she had shackled his wrists she knelt down and secured
his ankles.

&nbsp;

�Which penalty do you prefer, sir?� She asked. �The whip or
the cane?�

&nbsp;

Charlie remembered the sight of his friend�s hindquarters
after his caning and erroneously believed that the whip had to be less severe
than that.

&nbsp;

�The whip, p-please,� he replied quivering.

&nbsp;

�Ok,� said the nurse, sympathetically and removed her
nurse�s white coat to reveal a sleek black leotard which truly revealed the
contours of her shapely and voluptuous form.

She walked over to the chromium holder and took the cat o�
nine tails; the handle embroidered with gold and silver designer trimmings.

&nbsp;

�Please don�t whip me hard, Miss,� pleaded Charlie. �I beg
you!�

&nbsp;

The nurse closed her eyes, almost weeping with a sense of
sorrow for this poor man. He didn�t deserve this.

&nbsp;

�I-I�m so sorry,� she replied with a slightly choked voice.
�I have no choice. Your back must be certified following flagellation.
Floggings must reach a required standard by Law.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, God!� whimpered Charlie.

&nbsp;

The nurse walked around to the back of him and reached her
arm back in preparation to scourge her victim�s back.

&nbsp;

�Brace yourself, Mr. Slade,� she said, trying to offer as
much support as she could. �Have courage.�

&nbsp;

And with that, she shot the first lash across Charlie�s
shoulders.

&nbsp;

Charlie took a sharp intake of breath as the stinging pain
ripped through him.

&nbsp;

The second stroke was placed immediately beneath the first
and the third beneath that one. 

The nurse had developed a technique of applying the strokes
in rapid succession so as to reduce the time of the ordeal to a minimum.
Charlie didn�t know which lash he was screaming about since he could not
distinguish between them by the sixth lash, such was her skill. So fast, so
rapid-fire; the welts were raised and visible � deep red swellings raised by
the knots; extremely painful but mercifully not prolonged.

The twelfth stroke reached the bottom of Charlie�s buttocks.
The nurse was prohibited to lash his legs by Law. This was an incredible cruel
piece of legislation � tried and tested. Twelve lashes could go down to the
bottom of the buttocks, however, the last twelve � if they could not go lower �
must be placed over the existing wounds. �

&nbsp;

�I�m so, so sorry,� said the nurse, actually in tears by now
� and then slashed the whip again over Charlie�s tender buttocks.

&nbsp;

Charlie screamed!

&nbsp;

The nurse rapidly laid one stroke after another back upwards
along Charlie�s back, overlaying his previous welts. Many lacerations appeared
and Charlie was bleeding in places as he screamed.

&nbsp;

�P-p-please, no, no, NOOOOOO!� he pleaded, unable to take any
more, so great was the pain; his heart feeling like it was ready to burst.

&nbsp;

�Just two more,� she said, trying to comfort him. �You can
do it!�

&nbsp;

She lashed him with the twenty third stroke and then
immediately with the twenty-forth.

&nbsp;

Charlie felt his vision begin to blur and his consciousness
begin to slip away as a mid-way delirium began to overcome him.

&nbsp;

The nurse threw down the whip and ran over to the chromium
whip holder bench and reached into a drawer on the underside and drew out a jar
of ointment.

Hurriedly, she opened it and took out a scoop with her
fingers and applied it very gently to Charlie�s back. Almost immediately the
stinging began to subside.

&nbsp;

�This is a very powerful local anaesthetic ointment, sir,�
she told him. �It will take away the pain and help your skin to heal faster.�

&nbsp;

She applied more of the ointment to him, all across his back
and buttocks until his injuries were completely covered. The nurse stood back
and gave Charlie ten minutes to regain his senses.

As he became coherent, she approached him.

&nbsp;

�Are you alright?� she asked.

&nbsp;

�Y-yes,� replied Charlie. �I-I think so. The sting is all
gone. Why are you crying?� he asked, turning his head to see tears in her eyes.

&nbsp;

�I take no pleasure in this cruelty,� she replied with a
degree of bitterness in her voice. �I just don�t know what else to do. I have
been a Police physician all of my adult life. I never joined up for this.�

&nbsp;

�Then why don�t you quit?� asked Charlie.

&nbsp;

�Because then I wouldn�t be around to do whatever I could to
make it as easy as possible for people like you.�

&nbsp;

Charlie looked confused.

&nbsp;

�Did you not feel the way in which I whipped you quickly so
that you wouldn�t suffer for very long? It was I who put that ointment in the
drawer to take the sting out.� She informed him.

&nbsp;

Charlie was dumfounded; a compassionate flog-mistress? 

&nbsp;

�I want to do something for you now, if you would like me to,�
she offered.

&nbsp;

�W-what is that?� asked Charlie, quite taken aback.

&nbsp;

�Well,� she continued. �You have been found guilty of
illegal orgasm and you have been punished for it, yes?�

&nbsp;

�Yes,� replied Charlie curiously.

&nbsp;

�This means that if you were to fail another urine test in
the near future, you would have the ultimate alibi. You need only say: �I know;
I�ve already been punished.��

&nbsp;

�I suppose so,� replied Charlie.

&nbsp;

�Well,� she went on. �How would you like me to give you
sexual relief before you have your back examined for certification?�

&nbsp;

�Er � er � I � er � what do you mean, Miss?�

&nbsp;

�I mean that I will make you ejaculate � under my
supervision. It�s the least that I can do for you after that flogging. It can
be our little secret.� 

&nbsp;

She stepped towards Charlie and began to unshackle him from
the �X� frame.

&nbsp;

Once freed, Charlie was in full erection as he turned to
face the beautiful nurse. He was quivering with excitement and apprehension.

&nbsp;

�My, what a gorgeous penis,� she said with a touch of
astonishment in her voice. She had obviously seen it erect earlier, but was
however, compelled to speak in a professional manner.

&nbsp;

The nurse reached down and embraced his dripping erection.

&nbsp;

Charlie moaned with sexual excitement and delight.

&nbsp;

The nurse�s hand began to move with greater rapidity,
forcing further groans from the recipient as the nurse knelt down to become
face to face with Charlie�s sterling example of manhood.

She masturbated him gently but vigorously. It was truly the
most erotic experience of Charlie�s life so far. As Charlie sensed the approach
of orgasm he noted that the nurse had slowed down her pace. She wanted the
experience to last for him. She knew that he may be denied the company of a
woman indefinitely � he was literally at the mercy of whether or not a woman found
him attractive enough to claim him as her property.

She used her thumb and forefinger to squeeze the end of his
phallus so as to suppress his orgasmic spasm. When it had died down, she licked
her tongue around the dome of his tumescence and paid special attention to
making little flicks with the tip of her tongue on the underside of the
slit-opening, where it was the most sensitive for him and in so doing, she
collected generous amounts of his pre-ejaculate which was eagerly devoured.

&nbsp;

�Oh, Miss,� he whimpered. �Oh, Miss, oh, Miss. I am not
worthy!�

&nbsp;

She thrust her mouth down onto his rampant shaft,
deep-throating him and then pulling back before plunging back down again,
hungrily building up speed until her mouth itself was masturbating him.

Charlie began to see stars as the pleasure almost caused him
to lose consciousness. The nurse kept slowing down and stopping momentarily as
his orgasm loomed � keeping him on high for long minutes.

&nbsp;

Finally after fifteen minutes of delicious torment, the
nurse decided to withdraw her mouth and she gripped Charlie�s penis again in
her right hand and proceeded to masturbate him, whilst keeping her mouth open
in front of his erection and keeping her eyes gazing upwards into his.

Charlie could take it no more. His ejaculation had arrived
and this time she had decided to allow him to come � and come he did:

&nbsp;

�Ah, ah, ah ahhhhhh..............� he cried.

&nbsp;

And spurt after spurt of thick white semen, rich in young
virile sperm shot out of his penis � the veins standing bold and proud as
though they might rupture; the nurse � her mouth catching every single drop of
his eruption. 

Her hand moved with rapid speed so as to milk him of every
last drop and swallowing all that he had to give. As a concluding move, she
closed her lips around the end of his penis and sucked off the last traces of
his seed before pulling her mouth away and wrapping her arms around his
buttocks, resting her face in his groin and savouring the taste of him.

&nbsp;

Charlie whilst trying to compose himself placed his hands
around her neck, caressing her as she knelt before him.

&nbsp;

After several minutes, he spoke.

&nbsp;

�Oh, please Miss. Please,� he said.

&nbsp;

�Yes?� she questioned.

&nbsp;

�Please let me do the same for you. You are so kind.�

&nbsp;

She looked up at him.

&nbsp;

�Oh, but after the flogging that I had to give you....�

&nbsp;

�Which would have been much worse from any one else,
wouldn�t it?� Charlie cut her off.

&nbsp;

�Oh, Mr. Slade,� she said, with genuine affection in her
voice.

&nbsp;

�Charlie!� he corrected her and knelt down in front of her
and began to peel off her leotard � an action which she was eager to help him
with until, within seconds � she was nude.

Charlie noted how beautiful and smooth her body was; her
breasts were firm, most likely enhanced by laser surgery - her vagina was
totally shaved and surgically sculpted for optimum neatness.

&nbsp;

She lay back on the carpet in the punishment room and
Charlie slid his way down her body and began to pleasure her. His tongue began
to probe the length of her vulva � long strokes lapping away at the entirety of
her labia and thrusting itself as deep as possible inside of her dripping wet
orifice.

&nbsp;

�Oh, oh, ohhhhh......ahhhhhh....� she cried with ecstatic
joy even before he began to make contact with her most sensitive secret.

&nbsp;

After long minutes of teasing delight, Charlie, finally
placed the flat of his tongue against the nurse�s clitoris and began to orally
masturbate her with vigorous enthusiasm.

Her eyes widened, her mouth open with involuntary moans of
pleasure emanating from deep within her soul. Never before had she experienced
such euphoric cunnilingus from any man. What was it about Charlie that gave him
the ability to produce such ecstasy? Was it him? Or was it the circumstances?
The very fact that she could lose her job for what had transpired this day? 

Might it not be possible that the enhanced delight may be a
direct result of the simple fact that this act taking place in the Punishment
Centre during duty hours � was forbidden?

&nbsp;

Charlie sensed her orgasm approaching several times and
slowed down accordingly so as to prolong her pleasure � as she had done for
him.

For twenty minutes he gave everything that his tongue would
extend to until they both empathically decided that it was time. Charlie
inserted his middle finger inside of her and crooking it upwards, found her
G-spot and began to stroke it thoroughly whilst simultaneously lapping away at
her clitoris � spurring her on to a shattering orgasm.

She screamed � her voice audible nowhere else in the
building. The Punishment Centre was soundproofed to silence screams of a
different kind.

As she came, Charlie continues to stimulate her with
fervour, trying to collect the spray of her sweet nectar in his mouth as spurt
after spurt was released from her vagina and onto his devouring tongue.

&nbsp;

After she was spent, they both lay on the ground; the nurse
with her arms outstretched and the last vestiges of energy drained from her and
Charlie � his cheek resting against her spent lips as though her womanhood were
a pillow. Indeed, had he a choice � this is where he would have chosen to spend
an eternity.

&nbsp;

Eventually they both stood. 

&nbsp;

The nurse dressed herself and Charlie was taken back into
the test room where he put his trousers back on but was instructed by the nurse
to leave his shirt off.

She led him out down the corridor and into another room
where they both waited for ten minutes before being seen. Charlie�s back and
buttocks were inspected and graded as being flogged to satisfaction and he was
handed his certificate: the certificate which ensured that he would be safe
from another flogging for three weeks regardless of his sperm count.

The nurse then took Charlie into a treatment room and spent
thirty minutes dressing his wounds, during which time, Charlie lay face down
with another throbbing erection pressing under his abdomen.

The nurse dare not relieve him again in the treatment room
for it was too vulnerable an environment presenting the risk of being caught in
the act � much to Charlie�s dismay.� 

&nbsp;

Following the dressing of his wounds, Charlie redressed
himself and was discharged from the precinct.

As he departed the building, he wondered if he would ever
again meet the wonderful nurse who had so captivated him. He knew that whether
he saw her again or not, that she would torment his dreams for the rest of his
life. She would become his only sexual fantasy from now on. She would be there
every time that he closed his eyes � the torture of not being legally permitted
to masturbate to the memory of her! 

At this point, he had three weeks grace for his testicles to
produce a full quantity of semen. On those grounds, tonight he would masturbate
feverishly, over and over again to thoughts of her.

&nbsp;

And the one thing which occurred to him as he walked away
was � he didn�t even know her name!

End

&nbsp;

Author�s Comments.

&nbsp;

Well, there you have it � the Masturbation: Prohibited series � completed. I promised you that I
would bring you all four tales and I haven�t let you down.

&nbsp;

And now for a fairly deep explanation as to what, I believe
the series to be all about.

&nbsp;

It is true that human psychology demonstrates that an
individual�s strongest desires are not about those things that he (or she) can
have, but rather about those things that they cannot.

This concept was recognised by the most ancient philosophers
who originally composed the stories which originated major World religions. The
idea of the forbidden fruit became
fundamental to the recognition of man�s deepest desires and used very subtly
today in commercial advertising. How many post-Christmas/New Year�s sales
commercials bearing the voice over tease �buy it now whilst stocks last� or �half
price for one day only� � have we heard? Moreover, how many of us have made such
purchases simply as a result of this � buying things which we neither want nor
need simply because tomorrow � WE CAN�T HAVE IT?

How about the old adage � you never appreciate that which you have, until it�s gone!

&nbsp;

Recognising the power that taking something � anything �
away can have upon the human psyche, I became fascinated with the idea of
applying it to sexuality.

My partner gave me the original idea and I merely wished to
take it to the edge, for example � if sex becomes forbidden, then its appeal becomes
magnified one-hundred fold, however � there is always masturbation, right?

Well, what if that was taken away, also?

As discussed, forbidding or making unavailable those things
which are irrelevant to our lives can and will create a desire for them, but to
forbid something which we already need due to powerful, involuntary, biological
influences � the need for a sexual outlet � this I suspected would create the
greatest need for orgasm. I just needed one final piece of icing on the cake �
place the age of the recipients of the prohibition at a time when their sexual
urges would be at their peak � adolescence. And make the enforcers of the rule
the object of their strongest desire � the beautiful schoolmistress!

The result � The Paramount
Rule!

The Sinners was a
previously unreleased piece of drafting which was designed to set the scene for
what became The Paramount Rule,
therefore please do not ask me to do a sequel; anything which I would write in
a sequel to The Sinners would be
pointless � it is all in The Paramount
Rule � Parts 1-3. �

The funny thing is, the S and M elements did not originally
come from me, but that is the way in which it evolved, much of it on the
request of my readers. This led to Paramount
Rule � The Gaol which I honestly believe went much too far. Yes, it made a
lot of readers happy, but I personally found the experience rather disturbing.

And then came the story which you have just read.

I had taken the Masturbation:
Prohibited series from a mixed private school in the Victorian era, to a
private school for boys in the 1950�s, to a brutal Turkish jail in the 1960�s.
What could I do differently?

I came up with placing the final idea in the future �
because I could not see anywhere else where the concept could take place. We
all know that a society totally dominated by women in this way � has never
happened!

But I also wanted to do something unique with this one and
so as a total contrast to The Gaol, I
wanted to introduce the BDSM community to someone whom they are unlikely to
have encountered before � the compassionate, reluctant dominatrix; a woman who
suffers almost as much as her victim simply as a result of her actions.

It was a risky prospect. You will probably hate it � on the
other hand you may love it!

&nbsp;

And now a question for all of you, my faithful readers:
would you like me to write Masturbation:
Prohibited � Season 2 (to coin a USA TV expression)?

If you would, here are the ideas which are not possible � The Paramount Rule ended quite
conclusively with part 3. It was strictly a trilogy and cannot be continued.

Paramount Rule � The Gaol
also ended conclusively � I MADE SURE OF THAT! It cannot not be continued
either.

Reformation: 2127 � has
possibilities!

&nbsp;

I welcome your ideas and if there is a particular idea which
recurs, I will see what I can do for you all, however it may be next year
before you see the first of a new series � if it ever actually happens.

&nbsp;

One final word from me � I love you all and thank you for
reading my work. Please feel free to email me - and take my word for it �
masturbation is healthy and normal. Your body gives you the urge to do it for a
reason � if you don�t use it, you will lose it! It�s as simple as that. Ergo,
it could conceivably be argued that any doctrine which frowns upon or forbids
it is not only cruel and unjustified but may, in fact, be genocidal teaching.

�

Please, read my stories and ejaculate with my blessing!
