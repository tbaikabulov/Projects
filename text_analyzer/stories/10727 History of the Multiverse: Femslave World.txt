Synopsis: A light-hearted introduction to my fictional world where many of my stories are based.  A history of an alternate world much like our own, but one where female slavery is not only legalized, but the norm.    






HISTORY OF THE MULTIVERSE
--THE FEM-SLAVE WORLD--



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's called the multiverse, which is an infinite number of alternative realities, coexisting with our own world in our own time, but in other planes of existence: or you could just say "other dimensions" for short.&nbsp; If it can be dreamed, then it exists for real somewhere in the multiverse.&nbsp; Like the world where dogs rule and humans are the pets, or the clich�d realm where the Nazi's won the Second World War.&nbsp; And then there's the planet run by those "damn dirty apes!"&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You get the idea (I hope).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, you and I are just humble travelers, wandering the many worlds, and enjoying the many wonders that the multiverse has to offer.&nbsp; And then, as fate would have it, we stumble upon one that is close to our hearts... well, my heart at least.&nbsp; I honestly have no clue what lies behind those muscular walls of your ticker, or in the general vicinity.&nbsp; But since I am the one holding the Multiverse Explorer 5000's remote control, we stop where I want to stop, and in this case, it's a society that has legalized female slavery.&nbsp; So there!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being the history buff that I am, I just can't help hitting the "rewind" button on the ME5000's remote, and in no time, we are whizzing back through the ages to learn more about this strange, yet oddly compelling world.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apparently, this world had a timeline that followed our own for several millennia.&nbsp; We watch as the pyramids are built, (Holy Shit! Can you believe how they actually built them?&nbsp; Our historians sure did get that one wrong!)&nbsp; through the ancient Romans building their empire, and right up to the Middle Ages.&nbsp; That seems to be where the schism happened.&nbsp; It had something to do with their version of the Black Plague, which was so far spread that it affected every corner of the globe.&nbsp; But this disease was not the same as the one in our world.&nbsp; Scientists in this alternative reality eventually started calling it the Pink Plague.&nbsp; You see, something in that virus started to offset the female to male birth ratio, and a slow, gradual shift occurred in the human population which resulted in an outrageous 5 girls for every 1 boy by the year 1933.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know, I know.&nbsp; It's become clich�d, but hey, it works!&nbsp; I mean, do you honestly think that people in our world would suddenly legalize female based slavery?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since I know of at least a few artists out there who get this concept reversed, let me explain what happens when females seriously outnumber us guys.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It means there are five women for every man.&nbsp; If a woman wants to be the mate of any given man, she had better work her ass off, because the competition would be Fierce, (the capital F is on purpose).&nbsp; Jealousy and cat fights would be rampant.&nbsp; And then once she has won the affection of Prince Charming, she had better work doubly hard... or work her titties off... if she intends on keeping him.&nbsp; Can you imagine it?&nbsp; One high school girl (18 years of age, of course) has a huge crush on the guy two seats up from hers in algebra.&nbsp; Problem is, there are only five guys in her class, just like every class, and at least five other girls are drooling all over him!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any woman who scores a man would be the envy of all the unattached females out there (you know, 4 out of every 5), thus making the male of the species rather valuable.&nbsp; Look, it's the simple law of supply and demand.&nbsp; The demand for men would be high, and the supply limited.&nbsp; And conversely, the supply of women would be way too high, causing them to become... well... cheap.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Got it?&nbsp; Good... and if anyone tries telling you that a sex ratio with more men than women would lead to the enslavement of females, don't believe it.&nbsp; If that were to happen, the richest, most aggressive men would lock the women up and keep them for himself.&nbsp; Yes, the chicks may be put on a pedestal and treated like rare and valuable birds, but they would still be kept in gilded cages.&nbsp; They most certainly would not be sold at public auctions for any uncouth peasant to buy.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, back to the point. This world that we are currently visiting has had a little problem since the Middle Ages: WAAAY too much estrogen.&nbsp; The jealousy and cat fighting that I mentioned earlier eventually started to grate on the nerves of the male population.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I must now digress for a moment to explain one other difference between this world and ours: for some strange and unanswered reason, the people in this alternate realm tend to be kinkier, and those that are not kinky are at least tolerant of the majority.&nbsp; From leather, rubber and fur fetishes to foot fetishes, from simple bondage to all out sadomasochism, the people of this world indulge in, enjoy, or tolerate it all.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, considering that fact, it is not surprising to learn that someone eventually came up with an interesting solution to the surplus female population.&nbsp; What is shocking is the fact that that someone was a woman!&nbsp; Emily Borcha, who had not only won the heart of her city's mayor, but kept him interested throughout their marriage and even gave him two sons, suggested legalizing the enslavement of convicted female criminals in the year 1933.&nbsp; Slavery could be used as a punishment for a multitude of crimes, petty and serious; and it could be used to settle debts.&nbsp; The ruling male population just loved it, and the females... well, who cares!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, in the year 1934, the United States Congress passed the Judicial Enslavement Act, which became known as the Borcha Law.&nbsp; Between the years 1934 and 1969, most European and American countries had removed the anti-slavery laws from their books, and enacted new, gender based slavery laws, thus pleasing the world's male population to no end.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, disaster struck!&nbsp; In those early years, enslaved women looked and dressed like their free counterparts, since there were no identification laws.&nbsp; After the Great Slave Revolt of 1970, the murderous slaves who had taken part in it were able to escape into the society at large with ease, and it took five whole years before the last one was captured and punished.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now remember, something in this world had caused the population to be kinky, whether it was the Pink Plague or something else, I don't know.&nbsp; It is thus not surprising that someone quickly came up with a rather enjoyable and popular solution.&nbsp; Janet Carbuncle, a senator's wife from Mississippi, suggested an identification law that would do the following:
1) Make it illegal for slaves to wear any clothes without their owner's permission.
2) Make it illegal for slaves to hide certain body parts under clothing, namely tits, pussies, and asses.&nbsp; Thus, all slave clothes had to expose those body parts.
3) Require all slaves to be locked into a federally approved metal collar at all times.
4) Require all slaves to be marked with a "slave stamp," or identification tattoo on the area above their genitals.
5) Require all slaves to have their nipples pierced with federally approved rings.
6) Require all slaves to have their pubic hair permanently removed through electrical means. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since 1960, there had been discussions in political circles about extending the slavery to non-criminals, adding other forms of legal enslavement such as volunteerism, and familial enslavement, (that would be fathers selling their daughters, husbands selling nagging or unwanted wives, so on and so forth)..&nbsp; Other countries had been doing just that since 1954, most notably in Eastern Europe and Japan.&nbsp; The slave revolt reinvigorated those talks, so the Congress of the United States set out to make it happen.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By 1980, the Borcha Law had been turned into the Female Slavery Act, and that was quickly followed by the Slave Identification Act.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that takes us to the modern era!
