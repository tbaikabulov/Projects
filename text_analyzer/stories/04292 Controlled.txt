Chapter one � The Brothel������������������� 

&nbsp;

Pete�s view

&nbsp;

I looked around the room and couldn�t
believe where I was.�� It was not the
sort of place I would normally visit; in fact I had never seen the inside of a
brothel before.� I had always imagined
that there would be a line up of underdressed girls with too much makeup on but
this place was like a luxury motel.� I
was on a night out with the boys and after a more than a few drinks at the club
my friend had decided he wanted to see what really went on in side a brothel.� He was upstairs right now with my brother but
I had held back, happy just to observe things for a while.

&nbsp;

I had been looking around the place and had
just stepped into what seemed to be another waiting room when my attention was
caught by the sight of a pretty young girl coming into
the room with a man dressed in very expensive suit.� She had long blonde hair and was dressed in a
tight but not overly revealing dress. She didn�t look too happy and I was
starting to wonder why, when he pulled her aside.� They had not noticed me and as I was the only
one in the room, they acted as if they were alone.� I could not hear everything they were saying,
but by the body language, he was angry with her about something. She had started
to cry but her tears did not move him and I almost gasped as he pulled her hair
back sharply. 

&nbsp;

I was trying to decide if I should do
something to help her when a noise outside made the man go and see what was
happening. Before he left, I had seen him whisper something in her ear, his hand
gripping her chin firmly in his hand. The girl had tears running down her face.
She still had not seen me and I was starting to feel as if I was intruding on a
private moment.� I was trying not to move
when she suddenly looked up and saw me.�
In her eyes I could at first see sadness but then it changed to what
seemed to be fear. Looking around her, I wondered if she was in some kind of
trouble. 

&nbsp;

�Hey, are you OK? Is there anything I can
help you with?�� She did not answer me,
so I tried again. �My name is Pete, what is yours.�� She still did not answer, just continued to
look in the direction the man had gone in. I could hear talking outside the
room, so knew he was still occupied.�
�Come on, something is wrong. I know you don�t know me, but I am a good
listener.�� Giving me a sigh, I thought
she was going to tell me her worries, so what she said totally surprised me.

&nbsp;

�Go away, he will be back soon and he won�t
like you talking to me.�� This just made
me want to find out more, despite her warning. �Why, he doesn�t own you? Surely
you can decide who you talk to.�� She
went pale and I began to think that there was a lot more to her story.� �Pete, you have no idea what is going on. Now
just go away before you get me into trouble.��
This time she almost hissed her reply to me and actually pushed me
away.� 

&nbsp;

About to protest, I realised that the
voices outside had stopped and that there were footsteps heading back this
way.� One look at her face told me she
needed me to be gone, but I could not go out the door without being seen, so I
looked around for somewhere to hide. I had just ducked down behind the couch
when the man entered the room again. This time they were closer and I could
hear every word they said.

&nbsp;

�Julie, get over here now!� You have a client waiting for you upstairs
and I don�t want to hear any complaints this time or you will feel the kiss of
my whip. Come on, we don�t want to keep him waiting.�� I couldn�t believe what I was hearing and had
to clench my fists to stop myself from running out and saving her from
him.� When I heard them leave, I stood up
slowly, slightly dazed by what I had just heard.� Had he really threatened to whip her?� I just I had to find out more about what was
going on between the two, but how?� All I
had was her name, but maybe I could find out who the guy in the suit was. Going
out of the room, I made my way up to the reception area and waited to see if he
would come back down soon. I had no idea what I would do, but I just felt moved
to try something.

&nbsp;

Julie�s view


The client was one I had been with before, so I knew it would be a hard
session.� It had been over year now since
I had run away from home and my life had become a nightmare.� I had been almost eighteen and I thought my
parents were still treating me like a child. The things I had run from, bossy
parents and not being allowed out on weeknights, now seemed like my idea of
heaven. To be able to see my parents and just spend a normal night at home
would be so nice. Instead Sean now controlled my life and I had learnt not to
upset him.� 

&nbsp;

The clients name I didn�t know but he made
me call him Sir.� The last time I had
been with him I had forgotten this and he had really made me suffer, so I was
determined not to make that mistake again. Sean�s grip on my elbow was firm and
he almost pushed me into the room. I had to regain my balance as I tripped
slightly and looked up to see Sir smiling at me.� It was not a nice smile but one that sent
shivers down my spine.� He shook Sean�s
hand and then grabbed my nipples through my shirt and pulled me over to the
middle of the room.� I didn�t make a
sound, although in my head I was screaming.�
He liked to hear me scream and I didn�t want to give him the pleasure so
early on, knowing he would get plenty out of me later.

&nbsp;

I heard the door closing and knew Sean had
gone, leaving me alone with this man I had grown to fear and detest.� The first thing he did once he had let go of
my nipples was to tell me to undress.�
While I was undressing he went over to CD player and placed a CD into the
machine.� I already knew before the music
started playing what I would hear, as he used the same CD every time.� I was not sure of the name of the band but it
some kind of heavy metal band and it just made what he did to me seem even
worse. 

&nbsp;

As soon as the first note began, I felt
myself start to shake, my fear overtaking my senses. He was still smiling at
me, knowing that I was anticipating what would happen.� Moving closer to me, I fought the urge to
back away and waited for his first move. It did not take long, his fingers
twisting in my hair as he pulled me to him.�
Spinning me around, he pulled my elbows together, my shoulder crying out
in silent protest.� He then tied my wrists
together and reached around to grab my breasts from behind me.

&nbsp;

�Ah Julie, I have been thinking of you
since our last time together.� Have you
been thinking of me?�� As he spoke he
moved to pinch my nipples, his grip causing me to squirm in his grasp. �I�m not
letting go until you scream for me Julie.��
I knew he would be true to his word and as he twisted them even more, I
just had to scream.� His laughter mixed
in with my screams and the roaring of the voice on the CD.� I knew that no one could hear us, as all the
rooms were sound proof, but I still felt like the whole city must be able to
hear us.� He let go and before I even had
a chance to catch my breath, a ball gag was pushed into my mouth. Opening my
mouth wider to allow it to go in, I almost gagged as he pulled the straps tight
around my face.� 

&nbsp;

One the things that Sir liked was to have
me struggle and I knew today would be no different. I hated this more than
anything else he would do to me, as I usually ended up bruised all over.� He pushed me away and I knew that meant the
chase was on.� I took a deep breath and
forced myself to twist as if I was trying to get my hands free. Behind me I
heard him laugh and then suddenly I was tackled and landed under him on the
floor. He gripped my hair and forced my head up at the same time as he found my
nipple with his fingers. �Go on bitch, try to fight me, you know you can�t get
away.�� He got off me and pulled me up,
my hair feeling like it would come out, and again pushed me away from him.

&nbsp;

I tried to run for the door, another move
he liked me to try and felt his body slam into me as he pushed me into the
door. I tried to regain my breath as I felt him pull me back down to the
ground. He used his feet to pull my legs out wide, the muscles in my legs
burning. He spent the next few minutes squeezing and pinching my breasts as he
rubbed his cock against my lower back.�
Of course, I had to pretend to fight him by twisting in his arms. The
drool from my gag was running down my chin and I stiffened when a strand of it
hit his hand.� Pushing me down, so that
my head was close to the ground, he began to grind my face into the carpet. 

&nbsp;

I was finding it hard to breath
as he pushed my nose into the carpet and I felt the need to sneeze as the
fibres started to go up my nose. Pulling me back up, I fought to breathe
through my now blocked nose, my sneeze at least clearing my nose, though Sir
did not seem to appreciate it very much. As he wiped his hand, I expected him
to push me down again but instead he pulled some clamps out of his pocket and
attached them to my nipples. They were the kind that got tighter as you pulled
on them and I had to gasp as he pulled out the chain that linked them together.
He pulled me up to my feet again and lent down to whisper into my ear.

&nbsp;

�Now my girl, I believe I promised you
something last time, do you remember what it was?� I froze, my hope he had
forgotten gone.� �Sir, you said you would
try your new cane on me.�� That is what I
tried to say but what he heard was anyone�s guess.� He must have understand me enough though, as
he picked up a cane from somewhere in the room.�
I hated canes anyway but in his hands I knew it would be nothing but
torture.� The song on the CD changed and
now there was someone yelling about something, the lyrics lost in the screaming
of the singer.� 

&nbsp;

Sir walked around me, hitting his hand
lightly with the cane, his intent to scare me working.� Suddenly he pushed me to my knees and used
the cane to hit my bottom, not too hard but enough to force me to crawl around
the room. I was stopped when I reached the big brass iron bed that stood on one
side of the room.� Sir came around and
lifted me up by my tied arms and lay me face down on the bed. I moaned as my
clamped nipples were pushed onto the bed and m heart was beating faster as I
sensed he was getting closer to using the cane for real. �I was moved on the bed until I was lying in
the middle and then he tied my legs off to each side.� 

&nbsp;

I should have been used to having my body
exposed by now, but each time still felt like the first time, my shame still
overwhelming. Sir seemed to know how I felt as he leant down and whispered in
my ear. �Ah, this is what I like to see, my beautiful girl all ready for me� He
pushed what felt like his hand but was only two fingers into me.� I was not wet, my fear keeping me dry.� He continued to work his thick fingers into
me, my moans sounding loud in the room.�
I could feel my natural lubrication starting to flow and was grateful. I
used to think that I was a slut each time my body would react to something like
this, but I had learnt that it was just my body�s way of helping to ease the
pain.� 

&nbsp;

He pulled out his fingers with a loud
squelch and wiped them on my back. �What a little slut you are.� Fancy getting wet while tied up and being
fingered.� I think that kind of behaviour
deserves to be punished, don�t you?�� I
nodded my head, knowing that he would punish me anyway.� My arms were lifted up off my back and the
rope tied to a pulley that was up on the wall above the head of the bed.� As he kept pulling, the pain in my shoulders
doubled and I started to moan.� He kept
on pulling and just as I was sure my shoulders would pop out, he finally
stopped. 

&nbsp;

The CD changed to the next song just as I
felt the first strike of the cane on my bottom. Unlike before, this was not a
gentle hit but one that took my breath away. He did not give me any time to
recover as he brought the cane down again and again.� My bottom and back were starting to feel like
they were on fire and my screams would have deafened him if it had not been for
the gag. As it was, my muffled screams still filled the room as the pain rocked
through my body. I was vaguely aware of him moving around me but it was not
until the sole of my foot exploded in pain, that I realised where he had
gone.� He gave the other foot a whack as
well, my tears now covering my face.� The
music continued to blare, my pain seeming to be one with the singer�s screams. 

&nbsp;

�Well, my beautiful Julie, you seem to have
coloured up rather nicely and I think now it is time you thanked me, don�t
you?� Again I just nodded, knowing what
he meant.� �If I remember last time, you
still needed some practice with your deep throat technique.� Do you think you can do any better this
time?�� I nodded but it seemed that this
time he wanted more, as he pulled my head up off the bed.� �Answer me, girl, or you will be sorry.�� �Yes sir, I can do better.� Again my answer
came out all muffled, but he let go and started to unbuckle his belt.� Despite all the blowjobs I had been made to
give, the act still embarrassed me and I still could not manage to control my
gagging. I suppose it didn�t help that I was never just left to go at my own
pace. 

&nbsp;

The removal of the gag meant that I had a
moment to take a deep breath before he pushed his cock into my mouth.� It was a fairly large cock, not as big as
Sean�s but still big enough to cause some pain as it worked its way down into
my throat. Gagging as he pushed further down, I could feel the strain on my
shoulders as he lifted my chin up.� To
add to my woes, he then gripped the sides of my face and began to pump his cock
into me.� I was barely able to breath as he blocked off my air each time his cock went into
my mouth. My body rocked as he worked his cock in and out of me at an
ever-increasing pace.�� 

&nbsp;

There was a knock at the door and then
footsteps, as Sean entered the room. He always came back to get me before the
session had ended, claiming he was checking everything was OK.� I thought it was more likely that he wanted
to see what torment I was being put through.�
Sir�s cock began to cum in my throat, my air being blocked as he held it
in the one place.� I could feel my chest
beginning to burn as his cum pumped into me.�
In the background the heavy metal music thumped, by head pounding at
both its noise and the lack of air.� My
vision started to blur and I was sure it would not be long before I would pass
out, until Sir pulled out his cock. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

My head hit the bed as he let go and I just
lay there, aware of the men looking at the marks left by the cane.� I jerked as my back was touched and then I
felt my hair being pulled up again to see Sean�s face. �Are you having fun
baby?� What a shame your time here is
almost up. Oh well, there is always next time.��
As hard as I was trying to become, he always knew how to make me
cry.� He dropped my head again and then I
felt the pressure on my shoulders being lessened as my arms were lowered back
down.� It was only a few moments later
when I was pulled back up to my feet, my back protesting each move I had to
make.� Sir still had my arms tied, so
they were rubbing on my now sore back.� I
am sure that if his time were not nearly up, Sir would have made me stay this
way.� However, he had to untie me and the
relief was great as he undid first my elbows and then my wrists.� 

&nbsp;

The only decent thing about my sessions was
that I was allowed to have a shower, especially if I had another client who had
booked time with me.� Today was no
exception and once I had been made to thank Sir for spending time with me, I
was allowed to take my shower.���

Chapter 2 � A new Job

&nbsp;

Pete�s view

&nbsp;

I had seen the man come down the stairs and
then spend twenty minutes or so talking to the girl in the reception area.� My friends had come down while he was talking
and though it took me a while, I was able to convince them I wanted to
stay.� They just slapped me on the back
and told me it was about time, before I called them a cab.� I raced back inside in time to see the man go
back up the steps.� I could see the
receptionist looking at me and knew I would have to wait outside and hope they
came down soon.� Sitting down on a low
brick wall just outside, I tried not to think what might be happening
inside.� My watch showed me it had been
about 15 minutes since he had gone upstairs and I was just starting to get
cold, when I heard footsteps coming down the stairs. Not wanting to be seen, I
moved into the shadows where I could still see the
stairs.� It was them and I could see that
the girl was having trouble walking.� Her
hair was wet and had been pulled back into a ponytail, making her look more
like a cheerleader than a hooker.� I
tried to see her eyes, but she had her head down.� 

&nbsp;

The man led her to a large black car, a
driver getting out and opening up the back door.�� The girl was pushed into the back seat and
the man got in beside her. As they drove off I knew I would be back, hoping to
be able to find out who she was where she was being taken.


Three days later I was standing outside a large house with a tall fence and a
locked gate. I had gone back each night and tonight I had seen them again and
followed them here in my own car.� I had
been worried that they had seen me but the car didn�t stop until it had entered
the gates. I watched as the man again pulled the girl from the car and she was
dragged up the stairs. Like the other night, she appeared to be in some pain
and I became even more determined to help her.�
It was becoming more obvious that she was being held against her will
and I thought about just ringing the police, but I really had no evidence yet
to tell them. 

&nbsp;

I was just staring at the house when the
gate started to open and the man who had driven them back from the brothel
walked out.� He lit a cigarette and stood
smoking, so I decided to take a chance and talk to him. Getting out of my car,
I walked across the road and thought up a story in my head to explain why I was
there.

&nbsp;

�Hey pal, I am trying to find Jones Street.
Is it anywhere near here?� He just looked at me and I could see the anger in
his eyes.� �Man, are you Ok, you look at bit stressed out.�� I thought for a moment he was going to not
answer, and then he dropped the cigarette on the ground and put it out with his
heel of his shoe. �Man you really don�t want to know. I mean I thought I could
ignore the shit that goes on in there, but I just don�t know anymore.�� My heart was beating faster, thinking that he
might be the one who could get her out, but as I was not supposed to know
anything about the girl, I had to let him talk and hope he would say something
helpful.

&nbsp;

�When I first started driving Mr Thomas
around it was just normal stuff, the bank, the city, you know.� Occasionally he would want to go somewhere
different, but then it all started to change.�
I don�t know where the girl came from, but she is different from the
other girls he has had. I mean, she just looks so sad and sometimes I can tell
she is scared.� I can�t be sure, but I
think she is being held against her will.��


&nbsp;

�Why don�t you call the police if you are
so worried about her?�� He looked at me
like I was crazy.� �Hey, I may not like
it but no way am I going to rat on my boss. I have seen it when he is not happy
with someone and I don�t want to be on the receiving end. I think I will just
have to get another job.� Part of me was thinking he was a coward and the other
part was thinking that if I could get his job, I would be in a better position
to find out what was going on.� �Do you
think there is any way I could take your place? I am looking for work and
driving someone around sounds pretty easy� I wondered if I had moved too fast,
but after looking me over for a minute, he just shrugged. �Why not, at least
it�s worth asking. Are you sure you want to get mixed up in all the shit in
there though?� I tried to appear cool and not show what I was feeling inside.� �I suppose if it gets too much I could just
leave too, that is if I get the job�� 

&nbsp;

I was hoping that he would introduce me to
his boss, but was aware that this was a long shot.� He looked at me and then at the house before
turning back to me. �You know, if I tell Mr Thomas that you are an old mate, he
might be more likely to listen to you and take you on.� Why don�t you come inside with me now and we
can see what he says.�� I had not
expected him to ask me to meet his boss tonight but I figured I might as well
give it a go.� �Yeah, thanks mate, that would be great. What is he like, this Mr
Thomas?� I mean is there anything I
should know so I can impress him.�

&nbsp;

The guy just looked at me like I was a bit
weird. �I mean, I really need a job, so I don�t want to get off to a bad
start.�� This seemed to go down better
and he wasn�t looking at me so strangely any more.� �Well, he is a fairly serious man, so don�t
try to crack any jokes or anything. Just play it straight and you should be
ok.� Anyway, if I say I am going tonight,
he will have to have a driver for the morning.��� He turned to go inside when I thought of one
more thing I needed to know.� �Do you
stay in the house?�� �Yeah, well kind of,
I have a room over the garage.� The house
is separate, and I always tended in keep to myself as Mr Thomas really likes
his privacy.�� 

&nbsp;

I bet he did and I knew that finding out
what was really happening would not be easy.�


Doing a quick check to make sure I had no
stains on me, I was glad that I was dressed fairly decently, as I had come from
work.� I knew that I would have to take
some time off, but as was owed a fair bit of time off, I hoped that would not
be a big problem.� As we entered the
grounds, I felt my heart beating fast and my hands were getting sweaty.� I wondered if this was the craziest thing I
had ever done, but something just drove me on.�


&nbsp;

I followed him up the driveway and realised
I didn�t even know his name. �I can�t pretend you are an old mate if I don�t
even know your name.�� �Hey yeah, my name
is Collin and you are?�� �Peter, or Pete actually.� He headed up to the front door
and knocked, a big man opening the door.�
�Collin, can I help you?�� He
didn�t seem like the type you would mess around with and my head was again
telling me to just leave.� �I need to
speak to Mr Thomas. It is really important.��
For a moment I thought the big guy was going to just slam the door in
his face but thought better of it. �Who is this guy?�� He moved his eyes onto me and I could feel
his stare bore right through me.� 

&nbsp;

�This is an old mate of mine and I need to
introduce him to Mr Thomas.� If this is
not a good time, we could come back later, but as I am planning on leaving
tonight, it might cause a bit of a problem when he needs a driver in the
morning.�� The guy had taken his stare
off me and was now glaring at Collin.� He
was obviously trying to work out if he could risk not letting us see his boss.
�Ok, just wait here and I�ll see if he is free to talk to you.�� The door was slammed shut and I began to
think again that something was not right in that house.� We both waited for what must have been about
five minutes before the door was opened again and we were invited inside. �You
have ten minutes to talk in the den.� 

&nbsp;

I followed Collin as he headed to the den,
taking in the elegant surroundings on the way. Collin�s knock was met with a
gruff voice telling us to enter. I listened as Collin told Mr Thomas that his
mother had fallen ill and that he had called me, an old friend, to possibly
take over his job for him.� Mr Thomas
looked over at me, and it felt as if he could read my mind with his glare. I
was not someone who was easily intimidated but this man made me feel like I was
little kid again.� �Sir, my name is Pete
and I would like to help you out, if that is what you want.� I am a good driver and if you are willing to
give me a try, I promise you will not be disappointed.�� 

&nbsp;

Holding my breath, I waited for him to
answer me.� He continued to stare at me
and then sighed. �I am not used to just hiring people without knowing anything
about them, but I will be needing a driver in the
morning.� I suppose I can give you a
trial for a week and if I am satisfied, I may keep you on.� Of course, if you do anything I don�t like,
you will be out of here before you know what hits you. Collin, show Pete where
he will stay and make sure he knows the rules.��
With that our time was up and I was led out of the house and across the
grounds to a little unit above the garage. It was nowhere near as fancy as the
main house, but it was still a palace compared to my run down place.� 

&nbsp;

Now that I was here in the house, the
enormity of what I was doing began to sink in.�
I had to sit down and take a few deep breaths.� �Hey man, are you OK? I though you would be happy
you got the job, if only on a trial basis.��
Wondering how much I should tell him, I thought it wouldn�t be a bad
idea for someone to know what I was trying to do. �I am glad about the job, but
I need to tell you something.� Is it safe
to talk here?�� I was sounding like a bad
spy movie, but I had suddenly wondered if the place was bugged.� Collin looked a bit confused but just
shrugged and said as far as he knew it was.�
I thought it best not to risk it and asked him to come outside with me
for a few minutes.

&nbsp;

Once we were out of the unit, I started to
explain what I was up to. �Collin, I didn�t just happen to be here by chance. I
saw Mr Thomas with a young girl the other night at a brothel in town and I just
felt like she needed some help.� I don�t
know if I am being na�ve but I just couldn�t sit back and not know what was
really going on here. I have no idea what I am going to do other than try to
talk to her and get her the help she needs.��
Collin was just looking at me, making me feel like I had told the wrong
person. Just when I was about to say to forget it, he came and put a hand on my
shoulder.� 

&nbsp;

�Pete, I have already told you something is
going on and I have often wished I could help Julie, but I am not one to
interfere.� If you think you can help
her, then I am not going to stop you, but be careful.� Mr Thomas is not one for tolerating people
snooping into his business and I have the feeling it would be dangerous if he
found out what you were doing. I wish I could help more, but I just want to get
out of here.�� I thought again that he didn�t
have much of a backbone but then had to remind myself it was because of this I
was in a position to maybe help. 

&nbsp;

The rest of the evening was spent getting
my things from my unit and ringing my work to get some time off. By the time I
was ready for bed, I felt like whatever happened, I couldn�t stop it now. The
next morning I was dressed early, Collin�s suit a good fit on me. I had tried
to eat but had found I was too nervous.�
The thought that kept running through my head was what would I do if I did have the chance to help.� I just hoped that I would know when and if
the time came.� Collin had told me I had
to be ready with the back door of the car open at exactly 9am, so
I went down to check the car by 8am. It was a beautiful machine
and must have cost a fortune.� I made
sure I knew where all the controls were and was feeling confident that I could
drive it well by the time I had it out on the drive ready.

&nbsp;

The day went without me having any chance
of talking to Julie, let alone find out more about her situation.� I made sure I was polite and did my job
well.� For most of the day I was left
sitting in the car, waiting while Julie and Mr Thomas were in the brothel. The
rest of week was much the same, with some jobs just requiring me just driving
Mr Thomas and other times Julie was with him.�
I couldn�t help but notice that she was very quiet and often seemed to
be in pain after her visits to the brothel.�


&nbsp;

At the end of the week, Mr Thomas told me
he was happy with my work so far and offered me the job if I wanted it. I rang
my work and confirmed my need to take at least a few months off and settled
into my job.� In many ways, it was not
very exciting, but each time I saw Julie I remembered why I was there and knew
that eventually I would find the time to talk to her.� Another three weeks went by before I was able
to get some kind of clue of what was happening.�


�

Julie�s view

&nbsp;

Sean had been in the middle of telling me
how I had to improve when he was called away for something. Not that it made me
any more comfortable due to the way he had left me tied up on the top of a
small table.� He had pulled my legs out
wide and tied my wrists to my ankles, then tied the rope off to a hook on each
side, so I had no option but to sit with my pussy exposed.� It was not the worst tie I had ever been put
into but I still felt embarrassed by the exposure. He of course knew this and
played on my embarrassment. With him gone for a while, I thought back again on
the day I had stupidly run away from home and the way Sean had come into my
life.

&nbsp;

I had been in the city for about three
days, my hard earned money quickly dwindling away.� I had lived in a small town and had just
assumed that it would be easy to get work and find somewhere to live. However,
my small town ideas were soon proved wrong as no one was willing to give me a
job with no references or contact details and I could not afford to stay
somewhere decent without a job. I had spent the first night in a cheap hotel
but the sounds that were coming out of the other rooms kept me awake all
night.� The next night I slept in the
train station with a group of other kids, but I had woken up in the middle of
the night to find someone going through my bag.�
I just grabbed it and ran, only finding out later that my meagre supply
of money was gone. 

&nbsp;

I had been so angry that I had started to
run back to where I had been sleeping, not looking out for cars as I ran out
onto the road. The sound of a horn startled me and I had no time to get out of
the way as the big black car came towards me. The next thing I knew I was
waking up in a strange house with a two men looking at me.� I went to get up but a pain in my head
stopped me.� One of the men told me he
was a doctor and that apart from having a headache, I had no other serious injuries.

&nbsp;

The other man, Sean, went on to explain
that the car had just touched me but I had fallen and hit my head on the road.
Not knowing who I was or where I lived, he had brought me to his house and
called his doctor.� I didn�t think to
wonder why he had not just taken me to a hospital but I figured he was just
being nice.� I was allowed to sleep for a
while and then was given the best meal I had had since I left home.� I didn�t even think it was strange the way he
was very curious about me, just assuming he was interested in me and wanted to
help.� It was a few days later, when I
suggested that I was fine and should go, that things began to change.

&nbsp;

We were in the kitchen and I had just
finished another wonderful meal, when he asked me why I had come to the city. I
told him I thought it would be a chance to get a better job.� He then took me totally by surprise by asking
me if I had run away from home.� I tried
to deny it, but he already knew the truth and just smiled at me in a way that
was not like any smile I had ever seen before. It sent chills down my spine and
for the first time since I had been in his house, I began to feel
frightened.� 

&nbsp;

Looking around to see if there was a way I
could get out, I noticed a well-built man I had not seen before blocking the
entrance to the kitchen. My heart began to beat faster but I still hoped that I
was just imagining things.� What Sean
said next, though, put that thought out of my mind.� I still shudder now at the way he casually
started to tell me that I would be staying with him and that I would do
anything he told me to do. I had tried to run at that point but did not get
very far before the man at the door grabbed me, his hand blocking my mouth and
my screams.� Kicking out, I had felt my
foot make contact with a body and had heard a curse, as Sean hopped around the
kitchen.

&nbsp;

The scene would have been funny, if it had
not been for the way the man was holding me.�
I saw Sean heading back to me, his eyes filled with anger.� He told the other man to let go of my mouth
and then he hit me across my face. I had never been hit before and the way the
pain spread over my whole face was a new experience.� Before I had a chance to react to the slap,
Sean had taken a handful of my hair and pulled it back, making me squeal.� The look I could see in his eyes made me feel
weak and I knew without him saying anything that I was in serious trouble.� He almost hissed at me that I would be sorry
for that and told the man to take me into his bedroom. 

&nbsp;

A chill had gone through my body, thinking
they were going to rape me.� If I had known then what I knew now, I would have fought tooth and
nail to get away. As it was, I had decided that it would be better not
to fight and hoped they would let me go as soon as they had their fun.�� Once I had been dragged to Sean�s room, he
told me to undress.� The hand was kept
across my mouth as I tried to undress.� I
had been able to unbutton my shirt and loosen my skirt so it fell around my
feet. The shirt had been harder to remove with the man�s body behind me but I
had managed to get it off and then had been able to undo my bra.� I had tried not to think about what I was
doing, just wanting to get it over with.��


&nbsp;

All I had left to remove was my underpants
and I had only been able to get them down just off my hips with the way my body
was being held up. I had looked to see no mercy at all in Sean�s eyes and had
begun to cry as I struggled to get them off.�
It took me what felt like a long time to get them off my hips by
wriggling my body and eventually the pants were in a heap on the floor.� I had worked up a sweat and had been able to
feel my hair sticking to my forehead.�
Sean had moved in then and had begun to rub his hands over my body, his
touch making me try to move around from him.�
When he had grabbed my nipples and pulled me to him, I had screamed
behind the hand. Sean had continued to feel my body, squeezing and pinching me
all over for what had felt like hours.� 

&nbsp;

After he had tired of feeling me up, Sean
had told the man holding me to uncover my mouth again. Fearing another slap, I
had closed my eyes only to feel a ball being pushed into my mouth.� It had been pushed in behind my teeth and I
had found it impossible to close my mouth.�
I had started to find it hard to breath when I
had been pushed down onto the bed.� Sean
had been me in seconds and I had screamed around the gag as his cock pushed its
way into my dry pussy.�� I had always
thought rape would be painful but the agony had been beyond any pain I had ever
felt. I had just cried as he raped me, his body not giving me any time to get
used to his attack as he buried his cock in to the hilt. The only saving grace
was that I had not been a virgin, my old boyfriend having been my first and
only partner, until then.� 

&nbsp;

The rape went on and on, my body rocked by
the force of his thrusts into me. I had tried to block it out, but the pain
that raked my body kept me from being successful.� When I had felt him cum in me, I had thought
it was over but had then sensed a movement at the end of the bed and looked up
to see the big man with his penis in his hand. I had really tried to back off
the bed then, as the size of his penis had scared me.� I of course got nowhere before he had me
pinned down and was raping me with his huge cock.� I had tried looked up at the ceiling while
used me, but Sean had seen this and had pulled my head up off the bed so I had
to watch the other man raping me.� When
he had cum in me too, I had just curled up and cried until Sean started to tie
me to the bed.

&nbsp;

Never having been tied up before, I had no
idea what he was doing.� Before I knew
it, he had secured me to the bed with my arms tied up to the top of the bed and
my feet up beside them, so that they could both see my pussy and all their cum
dripping out of it.� That is how Sean had
left me, laughing as he told me that from now on I would be getting plenty of
cock in all my holes.� He left me crying
and in pain for what would be the first of many times. 

&nbsp;

I heard the footsteps before Sean entered
the room, his polished shoes sounding heavy on the wooden floors.� He came up and rubbed his hand along my pussy
slit and then forced one finger inside of me.�
�Slut, do you know what tomorrow is?��
I had no idea, the days and the weeks just seeming to blend into each
other.� �No Sir.�� He smiled his evil smile at me and then
pulled his finger out of my pussy.� 

&nbsp;

�Tomorrow it will be exactly one year since
you ran out in front of my car.� What a
lucky day that was, well it was for me anyway.��
So to celebrate, I have arranged a few special surprises for you.� Of course, you will have to wait for the
morning to find out what they are.�� My
heart sank at the thought of what he might have lined up for me, his cruelness
well known to me now.� I still sometimes
wonder how I had not seen through his act when he first helped me, but I guess
you see what you want to see.� 

&nbsp;

He had moved behind me and just as I was
wondering what he was doing, I felt something being
pulled down over my head.� The hood
blocked off my hearing and my sight completely. I tried not to panic as he then
pushed what felt like a penis gag into my mouth. It was big but short and make
my jaw hurt after only a short time. I tried to hear his footsteps around me
but could hear nothing, so I had no idea if Sean was still in the room or if he
had gone.� Time went by and I began to
think about how he had said it had been a year since I had come to his
house.� A whole year and I was still as
helpless as I had been when he and the man I now knew was Billy,
had raped me.� 

&nbsp;

A touch on my skin made me jump and I
became aware of something being pushed into my pussy. It was not a real penis
but one of the many dildoes or vibrators he had.� I had never known how many different kinds of
sex toys there were before this last year.�
I stiffened as he tried to push something in my bottom and removed it
again.� A finger on my hole rubbed in
some lube and then he tried again, the object sliding in slightly this
time.� I moaned around the penis gag and
tried to hold still as he continued to push what I could now tell was a fairly
large vibrator or dildo into me. I had learnt that once Sean wanted something
he didn�t give up, so I knew that he would keep on pushing until it was in
place. 

&nbsp;

Under the hood, I was starting to feel very
hot and sweat was already dripping down my face.� I squealed as he finally pushed the object
fully into my ass and then was rocked by vibrations in both my pussy and
ass.� His hand on my breasts made me
aware of his presence and then I felt a pinch on each nipple, which remained
when his hand was gone.� His voice inside
my ear started me and I figured he must have set up some form of speaker or
something inside the hood. �Julie, I am going to leave you like this for a
while and I do not want you to cum.� If
you do, you will be punished.�� .�
I had no doubt that I would be receiving another punishment later, as
there was no way I would be able to stop myself from cumming.
I just hoped it would not be as bad as some of his punishment had been.� I tried to think of anything other than the
orgasm rising in me, but my lack of other senses meant I had nothing else to
occupy my mind with. When I could fight it no more, the orgasm ripped through
me and as I could not turn off the vibrators, the next one just started to
build almost as soon as the first one had finished.� I lost count of the number of times I came,
all I knew was that each one was stronger then the last.� 

&nbsp;

I think I may have even passed out for a
short time, jumping as I felt his hands on my breasts.� The blood rushing back to my nipples made me
scream as he removed the clamps.� The
pain just made the next orgasm stronger still and I prayed he would stop the
vibrators, not even caring what my punishment would be.� Again I heard his voice in my ear. �I thought
I told you not to cum but then I guess a slut like you can�t help
themselves.�� Another orgasm rocked my
body as he finished speaking to me and it was all I could do to keep my head
up. �Slut, you have two choices for your punishment, you can stay as you are for
another thirty minutes or you can choose to be spanked. If you want to stay
like you are, hold up one finger, if you want me to
spank you, hold up two fingers.� He knew I hated his spankings, but no way
could I stand any more orgasms.� I held
up two fingers and prayed that he would not be as severe as he had been last
time.

&nbsp;

He removed the gag and hood first, the feel
of the cool air on my sweat-covered face felt wonderful. Teasing me, he would
move his hand down where the vibrator were still
buzzing and then move to undo another tie.�
By the time he had finally turned them both off and pulled them out, I
had come one more time.� Giving me no
time at all to recover my breath, he pulled me to lie over his lap and began to
spank me.� It was intense, his slaps hard
and regular on my bottom.� I started to
cry and then scream as he continued, never easing up as the slaps just seemed
to get even harder. He must have started to grow tired as he picked up a paddle
and gave me ten more slaps with it before finally letting me fall to the
floor.� I just lay there, my hands
rubbing my sore bottom while the tears ran down my face.� He left me there as he went and turned on the
shower and then I was pulled up and with his help, placed under the warm
water.� 

&nbsp;

I moaned as the water hit my bottom, but
then started to enjoy the warmth of the water. Sean was watching me, but this
was something I had grown used to.� My
only hope was that he would be content to just watch, but this was shattered as
he undressed and joined me in the shower.�
Pushing me against the wall, he worked his cock into my ass, his body
rubbing against my sore butt making me scream again.� The actual entry of his cock into me was
nothing compared to the pain he was causing to my throbbing bottom.� He powered into me and them
proceeded to fuck me with all the strength he could muster.� I tried to keep conscious as the pain level
grew and I began to felt light headed.�
The only way I was remaining standing was because he was holding me
firmly around my chest, his fingers squeezing my tender nipples.� By the time his cock was ready to cum, I was
ready to collapse. His feel of him cumming in me made
me sigh with relief and when he finally pulled out I had to lean on wall to
keep upright.

&nbsp;

I had to allow him to help me get to my
bed. He usually didn�t tie me down any more but attached a chain to one ankle
so I couldn�t go anywhere.� Sean had no
sooner cuffed the chain in place before I began to fall into a deep sleep.� I wondered what he had in store for me tomorrow
but did not let it stop me sleeping as I knew no amount of worry would change
it.� I just hoped it was nothing I could
not handle.

Chapter 3 � Driving down memory lane

&nbsp;

Pete�s view

&nbsp;

The morning started out as normal, with me
having the car ready on time for Mr Thomas.�
I looked up as Mr Thomas and Julie headed down the stairs. She looked
beautiful, but her clothes certainly left little to the imagination, with a
short skirt and a top that showed off her stomach. �Good morning Mr Thomas,
Miss.�� I held the door open as Julie got
in first, her naked bottom on view under her short skirt. Trying not to stare,
I was sure that her bottom looked bruised.�
Mr Thomas watched her enter the car and then told me where he wanted me
to go. Not wanting to seem nosy I kept my glances to the back seat to a
minimum, but it didn�t take long to see Julie was having trouble sitting in one
spot for long.

&nbsp;

Our first stop was the bus depot and
instead of getting out, I heard Mr Thomas speaking in a whisper to Julie, tears
running down her face at his words. The next stop was the train station and
this time, they did get out.� Mr Thomas
told me to park the car and remain with it and they would be back soon. I saw
Julie being virtually pulled from the car and made to cross over the road to
the station. I stayed in the car as I had been told, playing with the radio and
wondering what was happening, when I realised I really needed to go to the
toilet.� . Hoping that it would be a
while yet before Mr Thomas and Julie returned, I headed over to the station. 

&nbsp;

I took a wrong turn as I made my way back
to the car and was just about to turn back, when I heard what sounded like the
voice of Mr Thomas. I knew I shouldn�t but I just had to have a look to see
what was going on. At least I knew he wasn�t back at the car waiting for
me.� At first, all I could see was a
group of street kids, all male, standing in a group and then I heard the sound.
It was a kind of low moan and as I moved around a bit, I could make out what
looked like a blonde head of hair, much like Julies, in the middle of the
group.� One of the boys started to undo
his belt and I suddenly realised what I was seeing.� It was Julie in the middle of the boys and
she was giving each one a blowjob.� 

&nbsp;

I felt sick at the way she was being made
to degrade herself, her head bobbing up and down and her hands made to take two
more penises. I had to fight the urge to help her, knowing that this was not
the time or place to do anything.� Once
back at the car, I took a huge drink of water, my throat suddenly dry.� What must it be like to be used in that
way?� I could not imagine how Julie would
be feeling but knew that I had to pull myself together or I would ruin
everything.� 

&nbsp;

It was about half an hour later when they
returned, Julie looking pale and her tears obvious on her face.� Her hair was messy and she had to spend the
next ten minutes fixing her makeup and then her hair.� Concentrating on the road,� I tried to ignore the rage in me at her
treatment and hoped Mr Thomas would not see my white knuckles on the steering
wheel. 

&nbsp;

At the next stop, a seedy looking tattoo
parlour, I was asked to park the car and then come into the parlour.� As curious as I was to know what was going to
happen, I wasn�t so sure I wanted to know. However I did what was asked and a
few minutes later found myself in the back room of the place.� Julie was just sitting down in a chair and Mr
Thomas was talking to a man whose whole body seemed to be covered in
tatts.� I glanced at Julie and saw she
was looking curiously at me, and then her eyes grew wide as she appeared to
remember me. Although I had been driving her around for over three weeks, this was
the first time she had seen me face to face and without my driver�s hat and
sunglasses.� Holding a finger to my lips,
I saw her nod as she looked quickly away.

&nbsp;

It was just as well, as at that moment, the
two men turned back to Julie.� I didn�t
yet know why I was required but hoped it was nothing too serious.� �Pete, I brought you in here to help us
decide on which design Julie should get.�
You see, today is a special day as it is a year since we first met.� I like this one here but I am also partial to
this one.�� He had pointed to two
different designs, one a fancy number one and the other a flower in which the
number one formed part of one leaf. My only thought was that they would both
hurt, but pretended to be thinking and then picked the one he had mentioned
second, the one with the flower.� He
nodded, seemingly pleased with my choice.�
Behind us I had heard Julie crying and thought it seemed that she was
not too happy with the idea of getting a tattoo.� 

&nbsp;

�Thanks Pete, I do like that one. What do
you think Julie, a flower to remember our first year together?� Julie did not
respond, just continuing to cry. �Pete, you can go back to the car now, unless
you want to watch.�� I didn�t know what
to do, but thought that I shouldn�t let any opportunity to find out what was
really happening to slip by. �Well, I have never seen anyone get a tattoo, so
if you don�t mind Sir, I will stay for a while.�� He smiled at me, a smile that seemed to say
that he knew something I didn�t.� It made
me feel slightly uncomfortable but I just smiled back and took a seat out of
the way, but where I had a good view of Julie.

&nbsp;

Her face had grown very pale and I was
worried that she would pass out.� It was
very clear that this was not her idea and again I had to keep my cool and not
just try to get her out of the place.� I
heard Mr Thomas call the man with the tatts Roger and I watched at he began to
prepare Julie. It seemed it was to go on her lower back and she was made to lie
on her stomach.� I just happened to be in
a position to see her eyes and was close enough to touch her hand.� The mirror on the roof allowed me to see the
tattoo at it was done and I had to admire her strength. She did not scream or
call out, though her face was covered with tears and her sobs could be heard in
the room. 

Mr Thomas did nothing to comfort her, so
about half way through I took her hand in mine. She almost squeezed my fingers
to death, but I didn�t mind.� She didn�t
look at me but I was sure I was being some help to her.� After about half an hour, Roger got up and
walked back into the front of the parlour.�


&nbsp;

�Well, Julie, it looks very nice, not that
is it ready to show yet.� Pete, we are
almost done here, go and get the car ready and we will be out in a little
while.�� I let go of her hand and went
out to the front, stalling a bit to see if anything else was going on. As I was
leaving, I hear Mr Thomas say something about thanking Roger and then the sound
of a zipper.� It didn�t take a genius to
work out what was going on and again I felt a rush of anger at the way Julie
was being treated.�� About ten minutes
later, they were back in the car, a bandage coving the tattoo on her lower
back.� 

&nbsp;

�Head back to the house now.� The drive
back to the house was a quite one, with Mr Thomas reading the paper and Julie
just staring out the window.� As I pulled
into the drive, I again saw Mr Thomas lean and whisper something into Julie�s
ear and saw her shudder. Looking quickly away, I hurried to open the door and
let the two out.� Mr Thomas pulled Julie
out and then turned to me.� �Pete, you
did a good job this morning. As this is a special day, I would like you to come
over to the house at 2pm and join us in the celebration.� He gave me no time to
answer and I just assumed he would not take no for an answer anyway.� 

&nbsp;

I waited till they were inside before
driving the car into the garage and having some lunch. My mind was full of the
events of the morning and on what would happen this afternoon.� I knew I would have to continue to play along
with whatever Mr Thomas wanted, but had no idea how far I would be forced to
go. 

&nbsp;

Julie�s view

&nbsp;

When we had returned from the morning�s
adventures, I was left alone while Sean went off to organise whatever he had
planned for the afternoon.� It amazed me
that after a year, he could still surprise me.�
When I had walked into the station and seen the street kids, I knew what
he would make me do.� However, knowing
and doing are two different things and by the time the last boy had his cock in
my mouth, my throat was sore and my eyes were stinging from crying. It was not
even that I had to suck off five of them, but the memory of my last night of
freedom that really upset me.� I had so
often played the what if game, what if I had not run away, what if I had not
noticed my money was gone until later, what if I had seen the car, but nothing
could change the way things were now.

&nbsp;

My back was starting to hurt and I took the
two tablets Sean had left by the bed.� I
was furious that he had now marked my body but knew better than to let him know
that.� I had not yet seen the tattoo but
at least it seemed to only cover a small area of my back.� Thinking of the tattoo made me wonder again
about the new driver. I had been certain he was the same guy I had spoken to at
the brothel a few weeks ago, the one who wanted to help me. Was it just a
coincidence or was he the one who would take me away from here? I had learnt
not to wish for too much, as I only got disappointed.� Maybe I would find out more this afternoon,
though I dreaded to think what evil surprises Sean had in store for me.

&nbsp;

I must
have fallen asleep, the sound of Sean�s voice waking me up.� I had to wince as I moved, the tattoo on my
back hurting.� He held out two more
tablets and I took them, watching him as he looked even smugger then usual. �I
hope you are well rested and ready for your special celebration. I have gone to
some trouble to make it something you will remember for a long time, so I think
you might need to thank me now.� I knew what he wanted and hoped it would only
be a quick one this time.� �Kneel by the
side of the bed, your ass sticking out for me.��� I was still aware of the tattoo, but at
least there was no pressure on it.� �Come
on, spread those legs, surely you should know how to do that by now.� I did as
he said, the memory of all the other times I had done the same thing running
through my mind.

&nbsp;

Sean
must not have been satisfied as he used his foot to push my knees even further
apart, so far I thought I would split.� I
felt him move behind me and the sound of his spit. Bracing myself for what I
was sure was coming, I felt him rub around my asshole, using only the spit on
his fingers. He repeated this a few more times and then placed his cock on my
small hole.� I wanted to scream, but he
had placed a hand over my mouth and just pushed in.� Despite all the times I had been buggered, it
still hurt to feel a cock surge in. Sean somehow managed to get his cock all
the way in, the agony building as he started to move in me.� 

&nbsp;

My tears
must have been making his hand wet, but he did not remove it, only held on
tighter.� My muffled screams reached my
ears as he pounded into me, the tattoo aching as the skin around it was forced
to move as he moved.� By the time he was
done, his cum dripping down into my pussy and my ass sore, I somehow sensed
that this was just the start. He held his cock in me as he pulled my hair
back.� �Julie, I want you to know that
this year has been one of best I have had ever had, and it is all because of
you.�� In my head I was screaming the
foulest things I could think of while on the surface I remained passive.
Letting go of my hair, I fell forward onto the bed. He removed his now deflated
cock and lifted my head up again, only to push his now shit covered cock into
my mouth.

&nbsp;

The
taste was horrid as was the smell, but like all things I had learnt to do over
the year, I knew to just do as he wanted. I tired to stifle my gags as I used
my tongue to clean him and then swallowed him down to my throat to get it
really clean. I had also learnt that it allowed the spit covered shit to just
wash down into my stomach, so I didn�t have to taste it.� Letting his cock return to my mouth, I used
my tongue again to make sure it was all clean.�
Satisfied that it was, I tried to move my head back, only to have it held
firm by his strong grip. 

&nbsp;

�Nice,
it seems you have learnt some things over the year.� Now, you have twenty minutes to be ready to
celebrate.�� He let go and walked out the
door, leaving me� lying on the bed.� After a few moments, I slowly got to my feet,
though all I felt like doing was curling up on the bed.� I had become very good at blocking out what
was happening to me, but Sean�s constant reminder of what had happened a year
ago was making it all just too much to take.�
I shook my head and made myself concentrate on getting ready.� 

&nbsp;

By the
time Sean had entered the room again, I had applied some makeup and washed by
self with some warm water and a sponge, not sure if I could get the tattoo wet
yet.� At least while I was in the house,
I didn�t have to worry about what to wear. I looked up and seeing the grin on
his face, just had to look away, my stomach in knots over what was going to
happen. During my brief glance I had noticed some clothes in his hand and
thought they looked kind of familiar. 

&nbsp;

�Julie,
stand up and get dressed. It is almost time for our special celebration.�� He placed the clothes on the bed as I stood
and I recognised them as the same clothes I had worn when he had brought me to
his house.� The unfairness of everything
he had done welled up in me as I saw what used to be one of my favourite
outfits, but now just reminded me of that day.�
�Well go on, get dressed, people are waiting.�� This only made me feel more dread of what was
to come and I felt glued to the spot.�
Sean gripped my arm and spun me around at the same time as his hand
connected with my right cheek.� �Julie,
don�t waste my time, now get into those clothes!�� My cheek was stinging from his slap, but it
had reminded me of what I had to do and I moved quickly to dress� 


The skirt felt loose around my waist and top hung off my shoulders. I had not
realised how much weight I had lost over the year but I should not have been
surprised.� Sean didn�t seem to mind the
loose fit as he dragged me off down the hall to what he liked to call his fun
room. It was just a big open space in which he would place different items to
torture me with. Today it just held a couch, the same one I had woken up on
that first day and a large brass bed.��
As I was moved into the room, I was able to see that there were also a
number of large boxes in the corner.� My
nerves were on edge and his touch on my shoulder made me jump.

&nbsp;

�Go and
lie on the couch.�� Sean followed me as I
made my way over to the couch and proceeded to tie me to it.� My hands were tied so they were above my head
and my legs were spread wide.� He then
shoved a ball gag into my mouth and covered my eyes with a blind fold.� My heart was beating wildly as I heard him
leave the room and then what seemed like a few minutes later, return with at
least one other person. 

&nbsp;

�Doctor,
I am glad you could make it here so quickly.�
We hit her with the car and I think she hit her head on the road.�� I was confused by what Sean was saying and
then it suddenly hit me.� He was
re-enacting what had happened on the day he brought me home but I had an awful
feeling it would not be the way I remembered it. �You will need to do a
thorough exam, Doctor, as I would hate to think you missed something
important.�� 

&nbsp;

The feel
of a set of cold hands lifting up my skirt made me jump and then I felt a hand
on my pussy. �Well, everything seems to be in order on the outside but I will
have to check inside to make certain, but first I will need to remove these
clothes�� I heard the sound of material
being cut and then ripped as the skirt was removed. Next came my top, which he
just ripped of me, the sound of the material tearing making me think back to
when I had first worn it. I knew that the only reason Sean had made me wear
them was to make me remember the times I had chosen to put them on.� It seemed that today,� not only was he able to hurt me physically
but he was also getting into my head as well.���


&nbsp;

I tried
not to tense up as something cold and hard�
worked it way up into my pussy.�
It was twisting inside of me and though it did not really hurt, it felt
very strange.� The thing was removed and
what I thought was the same thing was pushed into my ass. However, as it was
pushed in further, the size told me it was not the same thing. Again there was
no major pain and I had just started to relax when the thing started to grow
bigger.� It was stretching out my ass to
a point where I thought it could go no more, but it did.� By the time it finally stopped, I felt like
someone had stuck a log up my butt.� 

&nbsp;

�Now, I had
better see if she has suffered any damage to her breasts.�� Leaving the thing in my butt, his hands moved
up to squeeze my breasts. I couldn�t help the moans that escaped as he
manipulated my breasts roughly.� When he
moved onto my nipples, my moans turned to screams as pulled them out and
pinched them.� The blindfold was becoming
wet from my tears and I was having to breath deeply as the pain increased. 

&nbsp;

�Well,
these seem to be in order but I think I will need to do an even more through
exam before I am satisfied.�� The sound
of a zipper being lowered was followed by his body covering mine.� He had not undressed fully, his clothes
rubbing against me as he moved his penis into me.� With the thing still in my ass, he had to
push firmly to get all of his cock into me.�
By the time he was fully into me, I could hardly breath and this only
got worse as he began to thrust into me.��
His hands returned to my breasts, squeezing them as he fucked me
powerfully.� When he was about to cum, he
pulled his cock out and spurted all over me, his grunts loud in the room.� 

&nbsp;

His cum
was all over my breasts and on my face.�
I just wanted to wipe it off but had to let it stay where it was.� �All seems to be fine here, in fact she seems
to be in great shape.�� The object was
removed from my butt, it being returned it to its original size before sliding
it out.� I breathed a sigh of relief,
even while I was trying to figure out what Sean might have planned for me next.

Chapter
4 � The celebration

�

Pete�s
view

&nbsp;

It was
right on 2pm when I knocked on the door, my hands sweaty with the thought of
what could happen.� I had spent the last
few hours since I had driven Mr Thomas and Julie home, trying to come to terms
with what I had seen. I just could not get the sight of her pretty face being
stuffed full of cock in the train station out of my head and my hand could
still feel the warmth of her hand as she held on to me while she was being
tattooed.� 

&nbsp;

I was
worried about the fact that I was being invited into the house after only a few
weeks in Mr Thomas� employ but assumed he had grown used to me. I had not asked
Collin if he had been invited in to the house when he worked here, but from
what he had said, Mr Thomas was usually very private. This made me feel anxious
that Mr Thomas knew that I wanted more than a job and he was just trying to
trap me.� However, if I was to find
anything out about Julie and her predicament, I had to take what opportunities
were offered to me.

&nbsp;

I knocked
on the door again, expecting the Billy to answer.� When the door opened and Mr Thomas answered I
was surprised and wondered again if I had been caught out and he really did
remember me from the brothel.� �Ah, right
on time, I like that. Now the reason I answered the door is that I need to talk
to you before we proceed.�� I felt my
stomach do a flip while I followed him into his den.�� I accepted a drink and took a sip to calm my
nerves.

&nbsp;

�Pete, I
just need to explain a few things to you, just so you do not get the wrong idea
of what is going on.�� I tried to keep
myself calm but wondered if he was about to save me the trouble and tell me how
Julie had got to be here.� �When you go
into the room soon, you will notice that Julie is tied up.� I almost choked on
my drink at his words and coughed to cover up my surprise.� Mr Thomas didn�t seem to be worried and
continued on. �Do you know anything about bondage?�� I had heard of it but really didn�t know too
much, so I just shook my head. 

&nbsp;

�Well,
Julie is into bondage and I do what I can to support her needs.�� I just looked at him while trying to sort out
what he was saying.� �The rougher she is
treated the more she likes it. You know she really likes to struggle and fight,
it is quite amazing. Anyway, if you didn�t know any better you would think she
didn�t like what was being done to her. Sometimes she even cries, but has told
me that she just feels so overwhelmed by the experience that she had to let it
out somehow.�� 

&nbsp;

I was
confused. Was I just poking my nose into something Julie wanted done to her or
was Mr Thomas lying to me?� The only
thing that swayed me to the second option was the way Julie had reacted to me
in the brothel when I had offered her some help.� If she had not been scared, they would have
been no reason for her to get so upset.�
I realised that Mr Thomas was asking me something and turned my
attention back to him.� �Pete, do you
think you can handle seeing Julie tied up?�

&nbsp;

�Um
well, I suppose I won�t know until I see her.��
I really wasn�t sure but again knew I had to continue what I had
started.� �Great, lets go then and Pete,
if you are up for it you can join in on the fun and games.�� I saw a glimpse of the evilest smile I had
ever seen and then it was gone.� He led
me down the hall to a room I had not seen before and though I had been warned
that Julie would be tied up, I still was not in any way prepared for what I
saw.

&nbsp;

Julie
was tied to the bed, which is kind of what I expected, but it was the way she
was tied up that took my breath away.�
The first thing I noticed was her naked pussy spread out wide, with her
feet tied to each corner of the bed.� I
forced myself to look further up her body and gasped as I saw the way her
nipples were stretched up taut by two clips that were tied to rope and attached
to the ceiling.� Her arms were tied to
the corners of the bed, so her body was in the shape of an X.� Apart from her breasts, it was the huge ball
that was in her mouth that really caught my eye.� I couldn�t even begin to imagine how it must
be stretching her jaws.

&nbsp;

I tried
to catch her eye to see what she was feeling, but she had them closed. �Mr
Thomas, I know you told me Julie likes this, but are you sure?�� Julie eyes had opened at the sound of my
voice and she was just staring at me.� Mr
Thomas moved to sit on the bed near her head and lifting up her head, removed
the ball from her mouth.

&nbsp;

�Julie,
I was telling Pete how you are really into bondage and like being treated in
this way.� I can see that he really needs
to hear it from you, so if you can just tell him yourself, we can continue on
with the afternoon.� I held my breath as she looked first at Mr Thomas and then
at me, her face not showing any surprise at what he was asking her to do.� �Pete, I do like this so please don�t worry
about me.�� I tried hard to believe what
she was saying, but figured she wouldn�t tell me otherwise with Mr Thomas
present.� I knew I would have to get her
alone to really find out the truth.

&nbsp;

�Good,
now we can get on with the celebration.�
Pete, would you bring that bag in the corner over.�� I wasn�t at all convinced but had to go with
the flow so that I could gain Mr Thomas�s trust.� By the time I had returned with the bag, he had
put the ball back and if anything, it looked like it was in even further than
it had been before .� �Come and sit on
the other side of the bed.�� He pulled
something out of the bag and I could see it was a can of whipped cream. 

�

�Pete,
this is a celebration of the year Julie has spent here with me and in place of
a cake, we are going to decorate Julie. Here, you start on her legs and I will
do her upper body.�� He had another can
and had already started to spray her breasts. Julie was squirming on the bed,
her nipple pulling as she moved.� I moved
down the bed and sprayed some cream on her right thigh, her legs moving
slightly with the touch of the cream.�
Trying not to look at her spread pussy, I sprayed the cream up and down
her legs until they were covered.� Her
upper body was now also covered, so that the only parts left were her face and
her pussy.� 

&nbsp;

�Go on,
finish the job.� Looking at her face I sprayed the cream on her open pussy, her
body jerking with each spray.� �Don�t
stop know, she will cum soon if you keep going.� With some surprise I realised
he was right and the sounds of her moans had changed.� Spraying her while Mr Thomas rubbed her
breasts, she squirmed and moaned until she shook in her bonds.� �Push your fingers in and see if you can make
her cum again.�� Part of me wanted to
refuse but my brain was not the part of my body that was making the decisions
at this time.� As if in a dream, I pushed
a finger into her moist pussy.� Her moans
were getting louder again and I saw that her breasts were still being
manipulated.� Adding another finger into
her, I worked them back and forwards until she came.

&nbsp;

�Well
done, know I don�t know about you but I think cream is nothing with out some
chocolate and strawberry sauce.� Which
one do you prefer?� I took the chocolate sauce and without any prompting,
beginning with her feet and working up her legs with the sauce.� The same was being done to her upper body and
soon she was covered.� �Now, this is the
fun part. I hope you have a sweet tooth.��
Mr Thomas was already licking at her arm and I hesitated only a moment
before starting to lick up her leg. Julie was moaning again but this time it
sounded like she was in need.� Getting
braver, I worked my way up her thigh until I was right at her pussy.� Now her moans were more urgent as I found her
clit and sucked on it.� 

&nbsp;

I was
rewarded with her biggest orgasm yet and found myself wondering if what Mr
Thomas had said wasn�t such a lie. Surely if she was scared or being forced to
do this, she would not have reacted to what we were doing, would she?� �Hey, that was great. Here use this cloth to
wash of the rest of this mess while I get ready for some more serious
fun.�� Her eyes locked with mine as I
washed her down and again I could feel a sense of apprehension.� Maybe she is just a drama queen or this is
just a game she likes to play. My mind was full of conflicting emotions but I
kept on washing her until all of the cream and other stuff was gone.� 

&nbsp;

Mr
Thomas returned with something in his hands that liked like a series of short
pieces of leather.� �Here, have a look.
It is called a flogger and it is something Julie really likes.���� He tossed the flogger to me and as I caught
it I could see Julie watching me with something like suspicion in her
eyes.� I felt the flogger and found it
was not too heavy but not too light either. �It feels nice, doesn�t it?� Would you like to see how to use it?�� I nodded and handed it back to him, despite
that knowledge that I knew it could be used to hurt Julie.� 

&nbsp;

He moved
to the side of the bed and began to use the flogger on Julie, lightly at first
but then with more force.� I could see
the light red marks he was leaving on her skin but it was her eyes that really
had my attention.� She was looking like
she was really in pain and I could see tears starting to roll down her
face.� Again I was confused about what
was really going on.� �Here, why don�t
you have a go?�� I was so startled by his
question that I had the flogger in my hand before I knew it.� Looking at it and then at Julie, I didn�t
know what to do. Mr Thomas came behind me and showed me the right way to hold
the flogger and moved my arm so that the flogger connected with the skin on
Julie�s leg.� To see her squirm because
of something I had done was a strange sensation.� I hit her lightly a few more times before
returning the flogger back to Mr Thomas.

&nbsp;

He just
smiled and continued to flog up and down her body, the sound of her moans
starting to fill the room. The last few hits were so loud I thought I could
feel the sting and was not surprised to see Julie jerk in pain. When he put the
flogger down I was relieved that I would not have to see her hurt anymore.� �Mr Thomas, I know you said she likes this
but she is crying. Surely that is not normal?��
He sat on the bed and wiped away her tears, suddenly looking like a
caring partner and not her tormenter.

&nbsp;

�Pete,
when you know more about bondage and Julie, you will understand that part of
what she likes is to feel real pain.� It
is all about pushing yourself and seeing how far you can go. She will be OK
soon, but if it makes you happy we can let her up for a while.�� I did feel better with the thought of her
being let go, but was unprepared for her reaction to having her nipples
unclamped. When the clamps came of, her whole body seemed to be in agony and
even through her gag I could tell she was screaming in pain.� Her nipples were all pinched and as Mr Thomas
rubbed them her whimpers were pitiful.� 

&nbsp;

She
seemed to calm after a while and didn�t move at all while the rest of the ropes
were undone.� Finally her gag was removed
and for the first time since I had entered the room, she was free of any
restraints.� Mr Thomas whispered
something in her ear and she moved to a room that I could see was a small
bathroom.� �Now, while Julie showers and
freshens up a bit, come and let me show you some other things we have here to
play with.� I moved over to see what he had to show, but all the while my
thoughts were on Julie, and what more the afternoon would hold.

&nbsp;

Julie�s
view

&nbsp;

Staggering
into the shower, I had to stop and take a few deep breaths, my mind in a whirl
over what had been happening.� Sean had
threatened me with three days in the cage if I did not go along with convincing
the new driver that I really enjoyed all the things he was going to do to me.� He had used the cage that first week I was in
his house and it still gave me nightmares to think about it. In the cage I had
been secured into position and was unable to move until he decided to move me.
To make it even more of a nightmare, he had used my body in any way he wanted
to and I had been unable to do anything about it. He had not let me out all
week, except for a few minutes between changing my positions.� 

&nbsp;

I could
still remember the fear and desperation I had felt being held in that
cage.� No amount of begging or crying had
moved Sean and in fact I was sure he had enjoyed hearing me beg him to let me
go. To think of going back in that cage was just too much and I had agreed to
say or do whatever he wanted me to do.� I
turned on the shower and let myself drift away for a few precious minutes.� I could hear talking in the other room but
not what was being said.� After a while,
I turned off the water and dried off, my fear building as I walked back into
the room.

&nbsp;

�Julie,
come over here and see what we have ready for you.�� I walked over to them, knowing that I had to
appear as if I was in agreement with what Sean was doing.� On the floor in front of them I could see a
frame. �I thought it was time you had some loving baby, and as I know how much
you love to be in restraints, we prepared this for you. Now, give me a hug
before we get you ready.�� I had to bite
my tongue not to say what I really wanted to say and let him embrace me.� His whisper in my ear reminded me of what I
had to lose if I disobeyed him. �Remember the cage.� That was all he said but
it still sent shivers down my spine.� 

&nbsp;

I had to
wince as he touched his hand on my tattoo and he surprised me by turning me
around and checking under the bandage that was still on it. He pulled a tube of
cream out of his pocket, applied some to my back and then gave me two more
tablets to swallow.� He ran his hand
gently down my face and it was all I could do not to pull away from him.� Smiling he hugged me again and then proceeded
to attach me to the frame. It was simple enough, with cuffs for my wrists and
ankles, but it still meant I could not move.�
Sean ran his hand up my slit and despite what I was feeling, the
familiar sensations were starting to come again.

&nbsp;

I had my
eyes closed while the feelings flooded my body. I was unaware of what was going
on around me until I felt a hand on my chin.�
Knowing it couldn�t be Sean, I was not surprised to see Pete standing in
front of my face.� I choked down the
words I really wanted to say to him and instead gave him the biggest smile I
could. This seems to satisfy him and he started to undress.� Behind me, Sean had also stopped and was
undressing. This was such a familiar scene now, but it still shocked me to
think that only a year ago I could never have even imagined being with two men, let alone being tied
up at the same time. 

&nbsp;

Hands on
my hips signalled Sean�s return and I gasped as he slid his cock right into my
pussy in one thrust.� His large cock sat
there, still able to stretch me even after a year of him using me.� I realised he was waiting for something and
looked up to see the head of Pete�s cock in front of me. Opening my mouth, I
took his cock in and sucked on it.� �See
Pete, she is keen as hell.� Use her
throat, she really is very good, plus she loves it.�� Again I wanted to yell no, but just took him
further down into my throat and then Sean began to move.� He had always liked to use me hard but today
it was like he was a man possessed.� Pete
hardly even had to move as the force of Sean�s thrusts forced his cock back and
forwards in my throat.� Breathing was
hard as I struggled to take in enough breath before I was forced back onto the
cock.� 

&nbsp;

In the
middle of all this, I started to become aware of a hand gently stroking my
hair.� It had been so long since I had
received any kind of comfort during a sexual encounter, that it was almost too
much for me. I was able to forget my humiliation at Pete seeing me in this way
and just felt a rush of gratitude.� Sean
was now thrusting so hard that his balls were bouncing off my pussy, the
sensations helping to make my orgasm grow.�
Trying to forget about the pain and my lack of air, I put all my focus
onto my orgasm and was rewarded with a massive release, just before I felt the
two men start to cum. They must have discussed what they would do, as they both
pulled out and sprayed their cum all over me.�
I had no choice as I let it drip off me into little puddles on the
floor.

&nbsp;

Hanging
my head in shame, I tried not to think about how I would look.� A hand pulled my head back sharply as Sean
gripped my hair.� �Julie, now I really
have a surprise for you.� I felt a stab of fear as I heard the door open and
footsteps enter the room.� �I remembered
how one of your fantasies is to have a gang bang while you are restrained and
that is what I have lined up for you this afternoon. What do you think of
that?�� Swallowing hard, I made myself
answer him,� �Yes, I would like that.�

&nbsp;

I felt
dirty having to agree to being further used but was too scared of the
consequences to not agree with him.� He
let go of my hair and I looked up to see not only Pete, but also the doctor and
Billy, the big guy who had held helped Sean secure and then rape me on my first
day in the house.� There was such a sense
of excitement and menace in the room that it almost took my breath away.� �Pete, would you get the video camera over
there and flim some of this.� I know
Julie would love to see this later.��
Sean was really playing this new guy and I wondered what he thought was
going on.� I knew that Sean had no idea
he was the guy from the brothel and still had some hope that he could help me
get away.� 

&nbsp;

As Pete
got the video going the men undressed and moved around me.� Sean was behind me still so I had no idea he
had picked up the flogger again until the first strike to my bottom.� He hit me another five times until he passed
it onto Billy who used it one my left breast and then it was the Doctor�s turn
to strike my other breast.� They
continued this for another four rounds, by which time I was really beginning to
ache.� The flogger was dropped to the
ground and I saw Sean give something to the two men and it wasn�t long
before� I felt my nipples being squeezed
into clamps and then weights added to them.�
My nipples were pulled down taut and it took more than a few deep
breaths to be able to start to handle the pain.�


&nbsp;

As I
opened my mouth to take another breath, the doctor filled it with his
cock.� Behind me, Billy was already
rubbing his cock up and down my pussy slit and then slid it home, my pussy
moist from Sean�s cum.� He pumped away a
few times and them moved up to my asshole.�
I wanted to move away from him, his cock stretching the hole wide as he
worked the head in.� The doctor grabbed
me by my ears and started to fuck my face, his pubic hair tickling my nose as
he thrust deep into my throat.� �A few slaps on my already sore bottom allowed
Billy�s cock to start to move into my ass.�
After a few more slaps, he had his whole cock in me and they both
started to fuck me in earnest.� 



The
weights on my nipples were rocking back and forwards and I felt the clamps
start to move with the forced movement.�
A burning pain on my back made me squeal around the doctor�s cock as he
began to hit me with the flogger yet again. I began to feel like a piece of
meat as I was pounded from both ends and my back continued to suffer under the
flogger.� When the men were almost ready
to cum, they again pulled out and showed me with their cum.� I could hardly see out of my right eye as the
Doctor sprayed a load of cum on my face.�
It also stung and I so wanted to wipe it away.� I could hear movement and Sean was in front
of me again.� �Hey Pete, give the camera
to Billy and fuck her.�� I wondered where
this afternoon would end as I saw Pete start to walk over to me.

Chapter
5 - The Party continues

&nbsp;

Pete�s
view

&nbsp;

I had
almost dropped the camera as I filmed the doctor and Billy using Julie and I
was sure there would be some shaky footage when the film moves onto Sean using
the flogger on her back. Still feeling confused by what the real situation was, I hesitated slightly when Sean called me over to fuck
Julie. My head was trying to tell me that she could be being held against her
will but my cock just wanted to be inside her.�
In the end my cock won and I handed the camera over and moved to stand
behind her. �Um, Mr Thomas, do you think I could just wash her down a bit. I
mean, I have nothing against how she looks but it could be hard to get a good
grip.�� 

&nbsp;

Mr
Thomas gave me a strange look but them smiled. �Sure,
but maybe we should see what Julie wants. I mean this
is her fantasy.�� I supposed he was right
and watched as he bent down so he was on level with her face.� �Julie, would you
like Pete to wash you down or are you happy to stay the way you are?�� She seemed to be thinking and I thought I saw
Sean move his hand down to her clamps breasts.�
�Maybe he could just wash off wear he wants to hold on?�� I thought I could hear some hesitation in her
voice, but Sean seemed happy with her answer,

&nbsp;

�Right,
good idea love, Sean is that ok with you?��
I just nodded yes and used a cloth form the bathroom to wipe her
hips.� Stroking my cock a few times to
make it firm, I gently used my fingers to open her up and finding her well
lubricated, I pushed into her slowly.� I
had noticed how hard the other guys had used her before, but it was just not my
style to fuck a girl the way the others had. She was talking all of Sean�s cock
into her throat as I worked in and out of her pussy.� Using my hand, I gently rubbed her clit and
heard what sounded like a moan.�
Continuing to rub her, her moans increased, though whether it was Sean
causing her moans or if it was from my hand, I didn�t know.� Her pussy felt so nice and warm around my
cock and I knew that it wouldn�t be long before I came. Sean was still fucking
her throat when I started to cum and quickly pulled out and added my cum to what was already on her back. 

&nbsp;

Sean had
told me earlier that Julie really liked having cum on her, so that is why I was
now spurting all over her back.� Now that
I had cum, Sean seemed to really increase his sped and I could hear her gagging
around his cock. He suddenly pulled out and added even more cum to her.� I thought it was a bit strange that he didn�t
even say anything to her or even touch her after he had cum on her.� I decided that I would though, and knelt down
in front of her. Lifting up her chin so I could see her eyes, I saw her glance
over at Mr Thomas and then return her eyes to me. 

&nbsp;

�Julie,
I just want to say how wonderful you are to allow us to satisfy your
fantasy.� Whatever else happens, just
know that this day will forever live in my memory.�� I thought I saw tears in her eyes but then
figured it could just be from the cum. I jumped when I
felt a hand on my shoulder and looked up to see Mr Thomas standing over
me.� Hoping I had not made a wrong move,
I stood slowly and faced him.� �Pete,
that was very nice of you. I guess in all the excitement I forget that it is still
Julie there.� He then bent down in front of her as I had done. �Love, Pete is
right, you are doing a great job and this really will be a day to remember.
Now, I think it is time we move onto the next surprise of the day.�� He got me to help him release her and to aid
her to stand.� 

&nbsp;

�Billy,
I think we need some champagne. Would you take Pete and bring us back a couple
of bottles and glasses?�� I followed
Billy into the kitchen, trying to find out more about Julie and Mr Thomas on
the way.� �Billy, what do you think of
Julie?�� He didn�t answer me so I tried
again. �Well, what I mean is have you known her long?�� Still no answer and I was about to try again
when he turned suddenly and used his hand to flatten me against the wall.� I could tell that he was not using all of
strength but still I could not move. 

&nbsp;

�Listen
here Pete, it is not a good idea to keep asking
questions about Julie and Mr 

Thomas.
What they do and how they choose to live is their business.� Now, I will ignore it this time, you being
new here and all, but if it continues then I will have to let Mr Thomas know you
have been sticking your nose into his business.�� He let go and I took a moment to settle my
nerves before following him again down the hallway. Either he was just a very
loyal employee or he also knew what was really going on.

&nbsp;

Returning
to the room with the champagne and the glasses, I was surprised to see the room
was empty. Then I heard the sound of splashing water and Mr Thomas�s
laughter.� Billy was already walking
through a door I hadn�t noticed before and as I followed him I could see the
two men and Julie sitting in what was one of the biggest spas I had ever seen.
�Ah, here is the champagne. Pour us all a glass and then join us in the water
boys.�� We did as Mr Thomas had asked, something I had noticed everyone did, and then
entered into the water.� 

&nbsp;

I had
not noticed before, but while the men were seated around the edge of the spa,
Julie was sitting in the middle on some kind of a platform.� She still had at least one hand free, as she
was able to hold the glass in her hand, but I thought she was somehow secured
to the bottom of the spa.� I had no
sooner sat down then Mr Thomas started to explain the features of the spa.

&nbsp;

�Gentlemen
and Julie, I am sure by now you have noticed that this is not just an ordinary
spa.� This is my extra special gift to
Julie, and I had it custom built just for her enjoyment.�� I thought Julie had stiffened slightly at his
words but as I could not see her face, I could have been mistaken. �Now, let me
explain what makes this spa so special. First of all, you might be wondering
why Julie is seated in the middle. Well, she is sitting on a platform on which
she is partly secured.� He took the half finished glass out of her hand and
strapped her hand down under the water. �These straps are made so they can be
lengthened or shortened as needed, so you could able to have the person
floating or even pull them under the water for a while if you wanted to.�� 

&nbsp;

Julie
definitely stiffened at his last remark. �Now that we have Julie secured, we
can keep her in one place or by pressing this button here, she will start to
turn on the platform.�� Julie began to
rotate around the middle of the spa at a slow pace, so that each rotation took
a few minutes.� �If you look beside you,
you will notice a button on the wall of the spa. Press it and see what
happens.�� We all did as he asked and
sprays of water hit Julie from four sides of the spa.� �You can control the force of the spray by
turning the button and the angle by pulling the button in and out. Give it a
go.�� 

&nbsp;

Julie
was hit with water going up and down her body at different strengths.� Her moans were loud and she began to gasp as
the Doctor managed to hit her nipples when she rotated to face him.� My spray was only hitting her upper back but
I heard her squeal as Mr Thomas aimed his spray at the bandage on her
back.� It was lucky she had on a
waterproof one, but I could imagine how much the spray of water would hurt her
there.� I was about to say something when
a look from Billy reminded me to mind my own business.

&nbsp;

�Ok, to
turn the water off, push the button right in.� All of the sprays of water
stopped so the only sound in the room was of Julie trying to get her breath
back.� �There is just one more feature I
have not shown you yet. Watch and see what happens when I press this red button
here.�� I was not sure at first what had
happened, but was aware of Julie squirming in her seat and of her gasps.� The Doctor was the first one to work it out.
�Hey, have you got jets of water aimed at her from somewhere.�� �Well, you are partly right, I have got under
water sprays of water, but what you can�t see is the giant dildo that is now
buried deep in Julie�s cunt.� It has it
own water spray and right now her cervix is being hit by blasts of water as well
as her clit being hit by the under water sprays.�� 

&nbsp;

No
wonder she was short of breath and I was sure she was about to cum when all of
a sudden she slumped down slightly in the water. �Gentlemen, I have a little
game for you to play. You will each have two minutes to make Julie cum, using
your own sprays. She will stay in one place for two minutes while you aim your
spray at her, and then she will be given another two minutes to calm down. The
first one to make her cum will get thirty minutes with Julie alone.�� I just knew I had to be the one to win the
game, but also knew I had some stiff opposition.� Mr Thomas did not participate, just drank his
champagne as Julie was spun slowly to face each of us.� Billy went first and thought she was
breathing pretty hard, he could not make her cum. The
doctor was next and aimed the water on her breasts, but still it was not
enough.� On my first go, I tried to aim
the water so it would hit her open pussy but it was still not enough.� By the time she came around to me again, she
was looking tired and I just knew I had to make this one work.� I aimed again at her clit, but this time had
the spray on its highest setting.� She
began to gasp as soon as the water hit and her breathing just got more and more
ragged as the time went by. The time was almost up, and I thought I had failed
again, when her body began to shake in orgasm. It was not a big one, the events
of the day obviously taking its toll, but it was defiantly an orgasm.

&nbsp;

�Well
done, Pete. Well, now that we have a winner, here are the rules.� You have to stay here in the spa with her,
but if you wish she can be untied.� For
safety reasons, we will be in the next room but you will still have your
privacy. Come on guys, we can return in half an hour.� With some crumbling, the
other got out and I couldn�t believe my luck in having found some time alone
with her, even if Mr Thomas would still be close by.�� 

&nbsp;

Julie�s
view

&nbsp;

I was
just feeling so tired and still did not know what to make of Pete.� He had seemed to feel some concern for me but
then he also had not hesitated to join in on the events so far.� All I really wanted to do was just lie down
and go to sleep, but knew that wouldn�t happen yet. Looking to see that Sean
had really left the room, I felt some relief and then tensed again as Pete
touched my arm. �Shh, Julie, I am just going to untie
you. I think after all you have been through, you deserve a bit of
relaxation.�� I wanted to believe him,
but after a year of men using me without any thought, I did not have a lot of
trust anymore.� 

&nbsp;

Once he
had untied me, I was relieved that he just moved back to his side of the spa
and I was able to stretch out my sore muscles.�
I still watched him out of the corner of my eye but was starting to
relax a little bit.� He must have sensed
this as he started to move closer to me but still made no attempt to touch me
yet.� �Julie, I need you to come over to
me, just in case Mr Thomas returns.�� I
felt my stomach sink at the thought he might actually want to use me, but found
myself doing as he asked.� Coming closer
to him, I realised he was much younger than he had seemed and was properly not
much older than I was.� 

&nbsp;

His arms
went around me and I tensed again as he pulled me into his embrace.� However, all he did was to lay my head on his
shoulder and gently rub my back.� �Julie,
do you remember me?�� I knew then I was
right, that he was the guy from the brothel.�
I just nodded. �I am not sure what is going on here, but are you in some
kind of trouble?�� My heart began to beat
faster and I again felt a rush of hope that he could do something to help
me.� What should I tell him? If Sean even
had an inkling that he wasn�t just here for the job, not only would he be sent
away but also I would be sure to be punished for talking to him.� 

&nbsp;

�Love, I
know that if you are here against your will, that you would be worried about Mr
Thomas finding out you told me. How about if you are not here
by choice, you squeeze my hand three times.�� He had whispered this in my ear and I felt
him take my hand under the water.� My
mind was in a whirl, this was what I had hoped for all along but now my fear of
Sean finding out was holding me back. Another awful thought suddenly came to
me. What if it was a trap?� What if� Sean had arranged
for Pete to test me?� I thought back over
the day and tried to think of any time he had seemed like he was playing along
with Sean but I could only remember his real concern in the tattoo parlour and
the way he had thanked me when no one else even seemed to remember my name
after they had fucked me. Taking a deep breath, I hoped he was genuine and
squeezed his hand three times.�� 

&nbsp;

Waiting
to see if he would jump up and tell Sean, I only felt him hold me more
tightly.� If it was a trap, then it was a
good one and I felt myself responding to his embrace. �Thank you for trusting
me. I don�t know yet how to help you, but believe me I will try my best.� Just know that I won�t let on that I know and
will still have to do what Mr Thomas asked.��
I sighed, not wanting to get too excited but seeing the first ray of
hope in what was a very dark existence. 

&nbsp;

�Pete, I
need you to be honest with me.� Have you
ever had any experience with a man like Sean?� When he just shook his head, I
sighed again, but he lifted up my head to look at him.� �Julie I promise you I will do everything
within my power to help you.�� I became
aware of what we must look like and moved away from his arms and took his penis
in my hand.� His surprised look was
priceless but I knew that if Sean thought he had not done anything with me, he
would be suspicious.� Pete must have
worked out what I was doing and moved to sit up on the edge of the spa so that
I had access to his cock with my mouth.� 

&nbsp;

I was in
the middle of giving him a blowjob, enjoying the freedom of having full control
over how fast I went and how far down my throat he went.� It also gave me time to think about the
possibility of getting out of the mess I was in, but knew I would have to find
a way of talking to him in private.� I
felt his hand on my hair and gave a grunt as his cock was thrust into my
throat.� The sound of Sean�s voice made
me realise why Pete had taken over and for the first time in a long time,� I was grateful to
have a man push his cock into me.

&nbsp;

�Pete, just wanted to let you know you have about ten minutes
left. After you are done, we will eat.� He left the room and Pete eased of the
pressure, the look in his eyes one of apology for what he had done.� I just smiled at him and was pleased to see
him smile back.� �Pete, do you want to
fuck me?�� I couldn�t believe I had
actually said that, but liked that fact that for once it was I able to ask and
not just have a man take what he wanted.�
He just looked at me with such great concern and shook his head.�� 

&nbsp;

�Love, I
think you need a break, but do you know what I would like? Mind you, know you
can say no.�� My mind was racing with all
the possibilities of what he might want, my experiences over the year giving me
plenty of choices.� �Don�t look so
worried, all I want is a kiss.�� I could
feel the tears coming to my eyes to be asked to do something so normal and
sweet even.�� He must have misunderstood
the reason for my tears, as he suddenly looked ashamed of himself.� Before I could change my mind, I reached up
and took his face in my hands and kissed him.�
It was not anything earth shattering, but it was soft and gentle and
made me feel like a woman and not an object.�


&nbsp;

He
looked so surprised I wanted to laugh, but settled for a smile instead. �Pete,
whatever happens, just knowing you are here will help me to keep going. But do
be careful, Sean is not a nice man and if he knew��� He placed his hands over my lips just as Sean
entered the room. Obviously our time together was up, but I felt renewed.� 

�Ok kiddies, that is time. Pete I do hope you enjoyed your time,
go and dress now and I�ll meet you inside in a moment.�� 

&nbsp;

As Pete
left, I felt the familiar rush of fear as I was again alone with Sean. He
motioned for me to get out of the spa and I was half out when he grabbed my
hair and pulled me out. Struggling to stand, he just laughed. �Hope you enjoyed
your little spa.� Seems you were lucky
Pete won, as the both Billy and the Doctor had some very interesting ideas for
you. Don�t worry though, the party is not over
yet.�� I moaned, my newfound strength
flowing out of me at his words.

&nbsp;

Laughing,
he led me out to the room we had been in earlier, a table now set up ready for
a meal in the middle of the room.� I baulked when I saw what was on the table, but Sean made me move
until I was standing at the end of the table.�
At each place setting, beside each plate, was laid a paddle, a flogger
and a vibrator.� In the middle of the
table, were placed nipple clamps, butt plugs, gags and other items for use on
me. 

&nbsp;

�Gentlemen, here is our lovely Julie, fresh
from her spa and ready to go.� I see you
have noticed the toys I�ve had placed on the table.� We will eat first, then
you will get the choice of one item from around you plate and two from the
middle to use on Julie. The order we will decide over dinner with a few party
games.�� I trembled as he mentioned party
games, knowing that there would be no nice sit down meal for me.

The other men, except for Pete, were
looking with interest at the items on the table.� Pete was just looking down, his hands looking
tense on the back of the chair. I willed him to relax or Sean would surely
notice the change in him. Luckily at that moment the first course of soup was
brought in and all the men took a seat.

&nbsp;

�Now, there will be three games, one with
each course and this will determine the order for after the meal.�� I was shaking with the thought of what
twisted games he would make me endure.�
He led me over to the wall and chained my hands up over my head, so they
were stretched up tight, forcing me to go up on my toes. My legs were spread
between a spreader bar, which made it even harder to
stay on my toes. He then spent some time placing a series of belts around my
waist, neck and my upper thighs. I could see that there were little hooks
hanging from each belt, though what they were for I didn�t know.�� He then also attached clamps with similar
hooks to my breasts and two on my pussy lips. His final act was to place a ball
bag with another hook on it into my mouth.�


&nbsp;

�Rules of the game, we will each have three
rings, a different colour for each man. We will take turns and the one to get
the most rings on the hooks wins. If you manage to get rings on her pussy or
breasts, you got bonus points.� Each game
we play has potential to earn you points.� I tried not to look at Pete as Sean
spoke about me like I was a playground attraction.� Bracing myself, I saw Billy take aim and felt
the ring bounce off my body.� The Doctor
was next and he aimed right at my breast, the weight of the ring as it landed
on the hook more than I had expected.� I
hoped not too many of them would find their targets, though I knew Sean would
be a good shot.� 

&nbsp;

Pete was next and as I expected his aim was
way off.� Sean then took aim and I
screeched as the ring landed on one of my pussy hooks. I could feel my pussy
lip stretching down and before I even had a change to get used to the feeling,
another ring slipped onto the other pussy hook.�
Again my screech filled the room and I was grateful when the next ring
missed.� By the time everyone had used up
all of their turns, I had two more rings on my pussy lips, two on my right
nipple and one on the other.� Another two
hung from my waist, one from my right thigh and one from my neck belt. 

&nbsp;

The Doctor was declared the winner but I
didn�t hear his score as I was just trying to cope with the pain of what the
rings were doing to my pussy lips and breasts.�
They left me like this almost all through the first course, relief only
coming when Sean removed the rings and the belts, leaving the clamps on my
pussy and breasts for last.� He did allow
me to have some soup, not enough to ease my hunger but I was still grateful for
the few spoonfuls he fed me.� 

&nbsp;

Wondering what the next game would be, my
poor breasts were again clamped with the hooks hanging down and a small bucket
was placed on each hook.� He returned to
the table and gave each man what looked five little marbles each.� Knowing what they were going to do, I hoped
they were going to be bad shots. �I am sure you have already worked out this
next game, but I need to tell you the rules anyway.� Like the previous game, you will take turns
to try to get your marbles into the buckets.��
I swallowed hard and waited for the first shot. 

&nbsp;

Unlike last time, the game moved slowly
with the rounds being held in between a lot of eating and drinking.� At first this was good, as it gave me time to
catch my breath between each round. But after the third round, with three balls
in one bucket and four in the other, I was really starting to feel the pull on
my nipples, not to mention the ache in the back of my calves from having to
balance on my toes.� Pete had again
managed to miss most of his shots, with only one ball going in, but at least
Sean did not seem to be too worried about it.

&nbsp;

The next round found another two balls in
the right bucket, meaning it now had six and was starting to feel like it was
trying to pull my nipple off.� By the
time the last round and the main meal was over, I had six balls in each bucket
and was in great pain.� Billy was the
winner this time, though the Doctor and Sean tied for second, with Pete getting
just two balls in.� Sean moved over to me
and thankfully removed the buckets and then the rest of the restraints, so I
could move down off my toes.� To my
surprise, I was then allowed to sit for a while and given a plate of food to
eat.� 

&nbsp;

While I savoured the meal, I saw a trolley
full of fruit being rolled in. Each man was given a selection of grapes,
berries and a small bits of other fruit onto their
plates.� I started to feel uncomfortable
about how the fruit might be used.� It
didn�t take long for Sean to tell everyone what they had to do.� �Now we come to desert and what will be the
final party game. You all have an amount of fruit on your plate. The rules of
the game are that you will each place on piece of fruit into Julie�s pussy until
she is full, then in turns you will suck the fruit out one by one. If you are
the one who makes her cum first you win, then we keep going to see who will be
the second one and so on. There is plenty more fruit if we need to repeat the
process again.�� I had suddenly lost my
appetite as he told them the rules, which was just as well as my plate was
removed and I was lifted up onto the table.�
I was tied down so that my legs were spread wide and my pussy exposed.
To add to my humiliation I was blindfolded so I would have no idea who was
doing what.

&nbsp;

The fruit was cold but soon warmed up at it
was pushed into me. It was truly a strange sensation to feel the small pieces
of fruit inside of me.� I don�t know how
long it took to fill me but I was ready to burst by the time the first one
started to suck the fruit out of me.� I
could hear laughter but no one spoke while bit by bit the fruit was
removed.� I was starting to feel my
orgasm rising, and now that they had to suck really hard to get the pieces
further inside of me, I knew it was only a matter of time before I came.� It only took three more pieces of fruit
before I was cumming, the men only giving me enough
time for my orgasm to stop before they started on me again. This time it didn�t
take long at all before my second orgasm hit and even less time for my
third.� I was exhausted and closed my
eyes for a moment, only having to open then again as the blindfold was removed.
Blinking in the light, I saw three faces smiling down at me, Pete standing back
trying to look busy as he removed the plates from the table. 

&nbsp;

�Well done Julie, you certainly make a very
attractive table decoration, but it is time for the main games of the evening.�
I knew the only thing keeping me going was fear and I just wished this day would
end.� �I am sure you are all keen to know
the order for the rest of the night, so just let me get Julie settled in and
then I will let you know.� I was cuffed into the same frame they had used when
they had gang banged me, my body aching all over as I was again placed on my
hands and knees.� �Ok, the order will be
the Doctor, Billy, myself and then Pete.� Remember you get a choice of one of the items
from beside your plate and two from the middle.�
You will each have twenty minutes then we will give Julie a ten minute
break.�� 

&nbsp;

He was only offering me a break to seem
fair to Pete, the other two well and truly aware of my status in the
house.� I could not see what implements
the doctor was collecting, as I was facing away from the table.� I flinched as he pulled back my head and
inserted a large penis gag, the head reaching almost down my throat and then
pushed a butt plug into my ass.� It
seemed to be well lubricated, so it was a full rather than a painful feeling.� What he did next though was definitely
painful, as the paddle hit my butt, causing the plug to go in even more.� �I want to hear you count each hit and thank
me Julie.� I could hardly speak but managed to do as he asked. By the time I
was at ten my ass was burning, by twenty it was all I could
do to yell out the count and remember to thank him.� He hit me another five times,
my ass feeling like it was on fire by the time he was done. He remove the plug and the gag and returned to the others.

&nbsp;

I was relieved when Sean called twenty
minutes and I was able rest, though I had to remain in the frame.� Pete came over with a class of water, which
was very welcome and also gave him the opportunity to wipe the tears from my
face.� I could hear Billy getting his
equipment together and hoped he didn�t decide to paddle my ass again.� Pete moved away and Billy knelt down in front
of me, his fingers pinching my already sore nipples.� �Please, Billy, anything else but the clamps.
They are so sore already.� I knew I properly shouldn�t ask, but it just came
out.� �Don�t worry,
I�m not planning on using the clamps.�� I
opened my mouth to thank him when he pushed in a massive ball gag, my jaw
almost dislocating with its insertion.�
He didn�t choose any thing else from the middle of the table but instead
returned with the flogger, which he used on my hanging breasts.� He hit one side then brought the flogger over
my head to hit the other side.� He got up
such a rhythm that there was sweat running down his face and by the time he had
finished we were both finding it hard to breath. My breasts now ached like my
bottom did and I still had to face up to whatever Sean had in mind. 

&nbsp;

My next ten minutes was filled with worry
over what Sean would do and I was again grateful as Pete brought me over
another glass of water. I longed to tell him how glad I was he was here but
remained silent and tried to rest for a few minutes.� My hair being pulled back signalled that
start of Sean�s time and the first thing he did was to place clamps on to my
nipples.� I took a deep breath and tried
not to scream as the pain radiated through my body.� His other choice was the blindfold, so my
world was dark again.� My body then
exploded in pain as he began to use the flogger on what seemed like every part
of my body that he could reach, even the souls of my feet did not miss out. I
was screaming by the time he was done, my body aching all over.� He removed the blindfold, which was now wet
with my tears, and then removed the clamps. This added pain only made me scream
more. 

&nbsp;

I had been pushed hard before but I really
felt like I was about to crack.�� The
only thing keeping me going was the knowledge that Pete was the last one and I
was sure he would not hurt me.� I was not
mistaken as he chose only the vibrator.�
He knelt down behind me and gently ran the head of the vibrator up and
down my pussy. I know he was trying to be helpful, but in my present state all
I wanted to do was sleep.� He bent down
to play with my breasts and whispered in my ear. �Julie, I am sorry I could do
nothing to help you tonight. I hope you are not too angry with me.� I could
only shake my head as a way of letting him know it was the opposite that I was
feeling. 

&nbsp;

He ran the vibrator up my stomach and
around each breast, and despite my exhaustion, I felt
some sensations start to form. When he returned the vibe to my pussy, I was
surprised to feel another orgasm forming. He gently used one finger in my pussy
and the combination of his finger and the vibrator on my clit brought me to yet
another orgasm.� It was bigger than I thought
and by the time it was done, I was almost asleep.� Even Sean must have seen that I would be no
good for anything for the rest of the night and when I was released told the
others that I needed to go to bed. He had to almost carry me back to my room
and I am sure I was asleep before my head even hit the pillow.

Chapter 6 � The Escape

&nbsp;

Pete�s view

&nbsp;

Not long after Julie was finally allowed to
go to sleep, the party broke up. I was about to head back to my unit above the
garage, when Mr Thomas asked if he could have a word before I left.� I nervously followed him into his den and
hoped I had not been caught out. He went to pour me another drink but I waved
it away and sat down, just wanting to be out of his sight.

&nbsp;

�Pete, thank you for joining in our little
celebration today. I could tell it wasn�t your thing, but I appreciate the
effort you made.� I am sure Julie did
too, though she is asleep so can�t tell you herself.��� I had to clench me fist to keep from telling
him that I knew his disgusting secret but just smiled at him. �Well, Mr Thomas,
I appreciate the opportunity you are giving me here.� Also, I try not to judge others sexual
preferences.�� He raised an eyebrow at me
and took a sip of his drink.� 

&nbsp;

�Pete, I am pleased you appreciate your job
here so I know you will respect our privacy.��
This veiled threat made me clench my fist even tighter, my nails digging
into the skin of my palm.� �Of course, I
would never say anything about what happened. After all, I like Julie and
wouldn�t want to upset her.�� Again he
raised his eyebrow at me.� After a few
minutes he spoke again, his voice now sounding very business like.

&nbsp;

�Pete, I won�t need you to drive me
anywhere tomorrow, but I will be taking the car out myself.� Make sure the keys are one the hook in the
garage. What you do with the day is up to you.� He then turned his back me and
waved me gone.� As I made my way back to
my place over the garage, my mind began to think of the opportunity I would
have to see Julie and maybe even get her out of here tomorrow.

&nbsp;

A few phone calls on my mobile phone later,
I had arranged to leave my car at a friend�s house and take an old one that he
had.� He also was arranging for the use
of an old cabin for a week, just in case I managed to get Julie free.� I knew it would be risky but it might be the
best chance I had for a while. ���Sleep
didn�t come easy, my mind full of how I could get into the house.� When I woke to the sounds of the car pulling
out of the drive, I knew it was time to put my plans into action. After a quick
shower to wake me up and a cup of black coffee, I headed off to the house, my
heart doing a tap dance in my chest.

&nbsp;

My knock on the door sounded so loud to my
ears and I had a story all ready to tell Billy, so the sight of a Spanish woman
at the door took my by surprise.� �Please
to help you?�� It took a moment for me to
realise she was asking what I wanted and I tried to tell her I wanted to come
into the house to find an aspirin.�� It
took a full five minutes of mime and misunderstanding before she worked out I
was the driver and ushered me into the kitchen. �Before I could stop her, she was buzzing
around putting on bacon and eggs and placing a mug of coffee in front of
me.� I relaxed, at least I was inside and
if Billy did come in, it would be easy to explain why I was here.

&nbsp;

I found out her name was Maria and she
worked a few days in the kitchen each week.�


She looked blank when I mentioned Julie�s
name, so I guessed she did not know she was in the house.� I was just about finished the food and was
starting to wonder how to get upstairs to look for Julie, when the phone rang.
Maria went to answer it, and I just waved a thank you at her and headed for the
front door, ducking off in the direction of the stairs at the last minute.� I could still hear her voice on the phone, so
was pretty sure she had not seen me change course. 

&nbsp;

Now I was upstairs, I began to search for
where Julie might be, listening against any closed doors. If Billy saw me, I
would say I needed the toilet but hoped I wouldn�t come to that.� I came to a door at end of the hall and
thought I could hear crying from inside.�
I whispered Julie�s name and knocked lightly on the door. The sound of
footsteps let me know someone was inside and I knocked softly again. I could
tell she was standing just near the door and was about to knock again when a small
voice answered my knocks. �Who is it?��
It was her.� �Julie, it is Pete,
are you OK?�� There was a slight
hesitation before her answer. �As OK as I ever am in this place.� I tried the
door, which of course was locked, and thanked by wayward cousin who had taught
me how to pick locks.� He was now in jail
but what he had taught me got me into the room.�
Quickly shutting the door behind me, I signalled Julie to be silent and
went into the bathroom.� Once the shower
was turned on, I turned to talk to her.

&nbsp;

�Julie, if you are up to it, I have a plan
to get you out of here.� Are you with
me?�� I saw her eyes widen first in fear
and then she looked around and nodded. I tried to imagine what she might be
thinking but didn�t want to waste too much time in case they had cameras in the
room.� �Do you have any clothes to change
in to?� She just shook her head and I thought quickly about where to get her
some. Remembering I had passed what looked to be Mr Thomas�s room just down the
hall, I took her hand and after checking the coast was clear, led her into his
room.

&nbsp;

Her hesitation to enter the room I first
put down to her nervousness at what we were doing, but when I saw her eyes fill
with tears at the sight of the bed, I knew something bad must had happened in
the room.� Not having time to ask her, I
threw a polo shirt and a pair of sweat pants on the bed. I had to click my
fingers to get her attention and then she quickly put the clothes on. They were
a bit big but at least she was covered for now.�




Creeping back to her door, I made sure it
was locked and that you could hear the shower running, and continued slowly
down the steps.� Her hand was tight in
mine and we made it down to the ground floor without anyone seeing us.� Billy�s voice in the room just down the hall
startled us both, but to her credit she did not make a sound. �Stay here, and I
will distract him. As soon as you hear me talking to Billy, run as fast as you
can and head up to my place over the garage. I have left the door unlocked.
Good luck.�� 

&nbsp;

I saw her crouch down behind a chair and
taking a deep breath, I entered the room where Billy was.� He was sitting in front of an array of TV
screens, which I realised were security monitors.� I could see the front drive, the gates and a
shot of the lawns around the house. The other screens were blank and I relaxed
as I realised he did not have Julie�s room on one of the screens.� Coughing, he turned around and before he
could ask what I was doing there, I began to tell him about the great breakfast
Maria had just made me.� 



�Pal, isn�t she one of the best cooks,
almost as good as my own Mum.�� I agreed
and walked around, pretending to look at the back of the monitors. �Billy, I
have often wondered about these things; are they all connected to one system or
do they work independently of each other?��
I had no idea what he was saying but he seemed to enjoy telling me how
it all worked.� He even explained how
they usually have some of the rooms in the house monitored at well, but that
there was a glitch in the system at the moment, so they only had the outside
ones working. I said a silent thank you�
that he had not seen me getting Julie out of her room.

&nbsp;

Suddenly though, he must have remembered he
had a job to do and I just hoped Julie had made her way up to my place in
time.� I jumped when he swore at one of
the screens and I was about to do the bolt. �Fucking salesman, I have told him
time and time again we do not need new carpet, but he just keeps coming back.�� I looked at the screen to see a truck with
the logo of a popular carpet retailer on the side, and no sight of Julie at
all. Next thing the man pushed the button on the intercom and I heard Billy
telling him to go away.� 

&nbsp;

I took the opportunity to leave and waved a
goodbye, making myself walk when I just wanting to run.� It seemed like an eternity as I made my way
back up to my place, the feeling a bit like those dreams where you never reach
the door. But reach the door I did, and as I entered I started to feel some
concern as I could not see Julie anyway.�
Where was she?� Surely she had not
misunderstood me and gone somewhere else?�
I was just about to check the garage down stairs when I became aware of
a movement at the back of the room.

&nbsp;

Julie stood up from behind my couch and I
just wanted to take her into my arms as she looked so much like a lost little
girl in the oversized shirt.� I made a
move towards her and was shocked to see her back away from me.� Having to remind myself of how huge this
whole thing must be for her, I stopped where I was.� �Julie, you know you have no need to be
scared of me, but I can understand how you might not trust what is going
on.� I need you to try though. Can you do
that?�� She looked anxious for a moment
and then nodded.� 

&nbsp;

�Good, now I need you to get into this bag,
so that you look like you are part of my washing.� I usually take the bag and do my washing once
a week, so it will not cause Billy to think anything strange is going on.�� She hesitated momentarily and then moved to
step into the bag.� I knew that after all
she had been through, this could seem like just another kinky act. Before she
bent down fully into the bag, I took her face in my hands and kissed her gently
on her lips. She seemed startled at first but then lent into the kiss, her
tears wetting my hands as she began to cry. �Julie, I don�t know what will
happen but you can trust me.�� This time
her eyes locked onto to mine and I could see hope there.� 

&nbsp;

Once she was in the bag, along with some
sheets to bulk it out, I carefully picked her up and carried the bag down the
stairs.� She had made a few low grunts
when I first picked her up but once she found a comfortable position, she was
silent and still until I reached my old car.�
Placing the bag onto the front seat, I opened the garage door and
prepared to drive her away.� I just hoped
our luck would hold and that no-one had noticed she was not in her room, the
shower running hopefully buying us some time.�


&nbsp;

When I sat back in the car, I leant over
and opened up the top of the bag to check she was ok. �Julie, we are almost out
of here,� all I have to do is get Billy
to open the gate. You have to stay still for a few more minutes, is that ok?�
Her big eyes looked up at me and she again just nodded.� I rubbed her hair out of her eyes and taking
a deep breath, I drove out of the garage. 

&nbsp;

Julie�s view

&nbsp;

I could hardly believe what was
happening.� Not only had Sean surprised
me this morning my telling me I had a day with no clients or demands and had
removed the cuff so I could move around the room, then Pete had turned up.� I still had a small section of my mind that
wondered if this was some kind of a trap, a way for Sean to test my loyalty or
something.� However, I had decided that if
he was being honest and actually had a way to get me out, then I would be a
fool not to try it.� 

&nbsp;

Walking into Sean�s room, the first time
since the day he and Billy had raped me, almost made me loose it, but Pete had
brought me back around.� I hated wearing
Sean�s clothes but knew it would be better then being naked.� When I had heard Billy�s voice I thought we
would be caught, but again Pete had saved the day and I had been able to make
it across to his place. Once there, I had begun to worry about someone else
coming in to find me, so I had hidden behind the couch.� The look of hurt in Pete�s eyes as I backed
away from him helped me to trust him and now I found myself sitting in a
laundry bag on the front seat beside someone I barely knew.� However, the way he had kissed me had washed
away even more doubts and I found myself starting to feel that long forgotten
feeling of trust. 

&nbsp;

I felt the car move and sat as still as I
could, which with all the time I had spent being forced to be still, was not so
hard. �Hey Billy, could you open the gates?�
I am off to do my washing and then plan to spent the rest of the day at
the beach.�� I hadn�t realised I was
holding my breath until I heard the gates opening and the car moved through
them and made a left turn.� We drove
along for what felt like five minutes or so and then the car stopped.� The fresh air felt great on my face and I
hoped that I would only see Pete�s face and not Sean�s. I still needed a bit
more convincing that this was not a trap.�


&nbsp;

Pete�s face came into view and I felt a
rush of relief as he helped me out of the bag. �Here, put this on. I just have
to make one stop to change cars and then I have a safe place for us to stay for
a while.�� Taking the hat he handed me, I
piled my hair up and put it on. I had so much I wanted to ask him but still
felt the need to be sure he was taking me to safety.� As he drove, I could see him give me some
glances but was glad he was just letting me think.� We reached a fairly run down house and he
drove around behind it and helped me out of the car.� 

&nbsp;

Lifting up the mat at the back door, he
swapped his car keys for another set that was sitting there. Looking around, I
kept imagining Sean running around the corner, but all that happened was that I
was led to sit in the other car that had been sitting in the yard. It looked
like an older model, but so long as it took me further away from Sean, I didn�t
mind.� We drove in silence for a few
hours, the radio the only sound in the car.�
I saw a sign for a turn off to Blue Lake and soon we were bumping down a
dirt road until he turned and parked the car.

&nbsp;

I could see a beautiful lake in front of me
and an old cabin just near where we had parked. �It is not much, but it is
private and no one but my friend Tim knows we are here. You must be hungry,
there is plenty of food inside.�� I knew
he wanted me to talk to him, but for now I was just trying to get my head
around all that had happened.� By now,
they would surely know I was gone and Sean would be furious.� 

&nbsp;

The enormity of what we had done suddenly
hit me and I found myself unable to move.�
I was overcome with a rush of emotions, fear and hope being on the top
of the list.� When the tears came, I felt
like a dam had burst and just cried and cried.�
Pete tried to comfort me, but at that moment I didn�t want anyone to
touch me and pushed him away. I�m not sure how long I cried for but by the time
by cries had become sobs; I could see Pete just sitting under a nearby tree. He
had that hurt look in his eyes again, but there was also concern there.� I made my way slowly out of the car and sat
down beside him.

&nbsp;

�Pete, I haven�t thanked you yet. I guess
it has come as a bit of a surprise.�� He
turned to me and went to put his hand on mine, but pulled it away again.� Not surprising, considering the way I had
just pushed him away.� Not wanting him to
feel uncomfortable, I took his hand and held it gently.� Trying to put my emotions into words, I was
about to speak when Pete got in first. �Julie, I just can�t even begin to
imagine what you have been through or how you might be feeling. You just do
whatever you need to do, cry, scream, sleep, talk or whatever else you need to
do.� We are safe here, so just take your
time and when you feel up to it, we will work out where you go to from
here.�� At that moment, I felt such a
rush of gratitude that someone cared enough for me to risk their life.� �Pete, thank you.� I am certain I will do all of what you just
said and maybe more, so please don�t be upset if I at times push you away or
don�t want to talk to you. After a year with Sean, I am afraid my trust of
people is not what it used to be. Now, did you mention food before, I am
starving.�� 

&nbsp;

The cabin was small but clean, with a main
bedroom and bathroom and a very comfy looking couch in the living area. The
kitchen was very basic but again had all you would need.� Pete warmed up some soup and we ate in
silence, after which I excused myself to take a shower.� I had not yet fully accepted the fact that I
was safe, my brain still refusing to believe I was really free of Sean�s grasp.� The water felt wonderful and Pete had given
me a soft bathrobe to put on when I was finished. He had also got his mate to
bring up a selection of clothes for me to wear, so I would not have to wear
Sean�s clothes again. Lingering under the spray of water, I tried to just enjoy
being free from fear and felt myself really beginning to relax.� 

&nbsp;

There was a note on the bench in the
kitchen telling me Pete was down by the lake and I decided to join him.� I still was not used to the freedom to make
up my own mind but it was something I was quickly remembering. Heading outside,
the sun just setting over the lake looked so beautiful I had to just watch it
for a while.� Pete must have seen me as
he called me over and I made my way down to the edge of the lake where he was
sitting. 

&nbsp;

�I was hoping you would join me. Would you
like a drink?� He had a bottle of wine open and on my nod, poured me a
glass.� I sat beside him, watching the
sunset and enjoying the feeling of being with a man I wasn�t scared of.� I could sense he wanted to ask me something
when he turned to face me. �Julie, you can tell me it is none of my business,
but how did you come to be with Sean?�� I
wasn�t sure if I wanted to think about this now but he had been very patient,
so with a deep breathe if started to tell him my story. I told him about how I
had run away and my adventures during the first few days in the city, including
how I had come to be in Sean�s home. 

&nbsp;

�He just seemed to be so nice and caring, I
couldn�t believe it when he turned on me. He had Billy help him and they both
raped me on Sean�s bed.� After that he
put me in� the cage until I was ready to
do anything he wanted.� I was glad he had not asked me more about the cage but
his next question was also a hard one to talk about.� �When I first saw you at the brothel, you
were scared of something. What was going on there?� 

I looked out at the water, the memory of
all the times I had been forced to suffer for the whims of my clients going
through my head. Pete must have sensed my unease, as he laid a hand on my
shoulder. �God Julie, of course you don�t want to relive all those terrible
memories.� Just forget I asked.�� 

&nbsp;

But I found I did want to talk about it.
�No It�s OK.� I think it might actually
help to talk about it. It all started after Sean had held me for about two
months. A friend of his came to visit and play with me, and when they were done
he had suggested that Sean bring me down to his brothel and make some
money.� Pete, out of all the things Sean
did to me that had to be the worst. I just felt so exposed and those guys were
just so evil. There was one who liked to use a whip on me, he would tie me to a
post and just go for it.� Another one
liked to give me enemas, making me take more and more until I was sure I would
pop.� Then there was Sir, the man I was
due to visit on the day you saw me.� He
scared me the most, not such much due to what he would do, though he was
equally as nasty as the rest, but because he just didn�t seem to care at all.� I am sure that if I was left with him over an
extended period of time, he would have killed me.�� I stopped; again feeling the rush of fear
those visits had brought me.� Pete was
silent beside me and I figured sometimes the truth really is hard to hear.� 

&nbsp;

�Pete, that day you saw me, I wanted so
much to let you help me, but I am sure you know now why I had to tell you leave
me alone.� I never, ever dreamed you
would even remember me after that night let alone risk so much to help
me.�� I felt the inevitable tears again
rock my body, but this time I allowed Pete to hold me until I had calmed
again.� By now the sun was almost set and
it was getting a bit cool, so we headed back inside again.

Chapter 7 � Danger

&nbsp;

Pete�s view

&nbsp;

Having heard a bit more about Julie�s
experiences with Sean, I was determined to help her forget by distracting her
with games and fishing.� Fishing was not
so successful; as it was not the best time to fish the lake, but I found out
she was a very good poker player and absolutely ruled at monopoly. What was
amazing to watch was the way each day she become more
confident and happy, her fear fading if not totally gone.� We had been at the lake for a week and I
thought she properly needed at least another week until we started to seriously
consider her options.� She was still very
jumpy and I did my best not to startle her. On our first night at the cabin,
she had seemed quite nervous when we headed back inside and I realised she was
thinking about our sleeping arrangements.�
Once I had assured her I was sleeping on the couch, she
had relaxed and she had happily gone to sleep in the bedroom.

&nbsp;

I had already decided I would stay with her
if she wanted but was also bracing myself for her wanting to return to her own
family.� I had asked her if there was any
chance Sean would try to find her at her old home, but she had said that she
had never told him where her hometown was. I was sure that Sean was going crazy
by now, and hoped that my mate was remembering not to drive around in my old
car.� I had shown Julie where the hunting
rifles were kept in a box just inside the door and we also put one under the
steps outside, just in case.� There was
also a small fishing shack about ten minutes from the cabin, in which I had
left a tackle box, complete with a fishing knife.� I had not wanted to scare her, but we need to
be ready if somehow Sean found us.

&nbsp;

I was just heading outside to see if Julie
was having any luck with her fishing, when I thought I heard a sound.� Not wanting to scare Julie, I looked around a
bit and decided it must have been an animal when I heard it again, but this
time it was louder. I was just about to shout out a warning for Julie to run,
when I felt a hand cover my mouth and a gun was held up to my head. I struggled
to get away but the grip was strong.

�Pete, don�t make me use this thing.�� I froze, recognising Billy�s voice.� My only thought was Julie and what they would
do to her if she were caught.

&nbsp;

�Well, well, well. Pete, I hope you have
enjoyed your time here at the lake, at it will be the last thing you will ever
enjoy.�� I doubled by efforts but could
not get away. �Billy, take him into the cabin while I get Julie. I can see she
has also had a nice time in the sun, but it will have to last her for a long,
long time.�� I so wanted to warn her, but
knew we were too far away for her to have heard anything.� Watching as Sean walked up behind her, I saw
her turn, her face having a huge smile until she saw Sean.� She then went pale and tried to run as he
reached out and grabbed her. The fishing rod fell into the water as he picked
her up and threw her over his shoulder.�
Billy prodded me in the back with the gun and with a hand on my shoulder
I was made to walk into the cabin. Sean had just put Julie down inside the
cabin and I could see her body shaking.�
Billy made me walk over to one of the chairs and started to tie me down,
the ropes tight against my skin. A noise behind him made us both look up and I
saw Sean hoping around holding his balls in his hand and Julie bolting out the
door. 

&nbsp;

�Run, Julie, run!� Billy must not have
liked my urging her on, as the next thing I knew my face exploded in pain as he
punched me. I literally saw stars and then nothing as I blacked out.

&nbsp;

Julie�s view

&nbsp;

I had just felt so angry that Sean was
trying to take over my life again, that I did what I should have done the first
time he ever tried to grab me.� I hit him
with all my might in his crotch and just ran as fast as I could out of there.� The only advantage I had was surprise, so I
did not have much time to get away.� I
heard Pete yelling out for me to run and then nothing, but I didn�t have time
to worry about him now.

&nbsp;

Heading over to the fishing shack, I could
hear footsteps behind me. I knew that if they both got me, I would not get away
again. I ducked behind a large tree trunk and heard Sean screaming my
name.� He ran past me to the cars and I
took the change to continue on while he had his back to me. I tried to be as
quite as I could as I made my way along the track to the shack. The first part
was hidden as it was in the trees, but the last part went along side the lake
and I knew I would be in clear sight.� 

&nbsp;

However, I had to get to the shack to get
the knife, so at least I would have a better chance of defending myself.� The footsteps behind me were getting closer,
so I just ran as fast as I could to the shack, my hands shaking as I pulled
open the door. The tackle box was under the table in the corner and I ran to
pull it out, the sound of the footsteps outside the door warning me Sean was
close. I had just managed to get the knife out of the box when the door slammed
open and I was face to face with Sean.

&nbsp;

�Come here you bitch.� Boy, you are really going to wish you had not
hit me.�� I tried to steady my hand as I
held up the knife but I could see it shaking. �Don�t come any closer, or you
will be sorry.�� He just laughed, and
reached out to grab the knife from me.� I
am nor sure how, but I somehow managed to nick his hand, making him even more
determined to get at me. �That�s it, you are going to
really pay when I get you back home.���
The menace in his voice didn�t help to ease my shaking hand and this
time when he reached for the knife, he managed to grip my wrist and twisted it
until I had to drop the knife.

&nbsp;

Now I knew I was in trouble and started to
back up as he approached me, my back hitting the wall. There was nowhere for me
to go, and he knew that, his evil smile back on his face.� �Please Sean, don�t hurt me. I�m sorry I hit
you.�� I hated the sound of my voice as I
begged him, even though I was sure it make no
difference. �Oh darling, you don�t know what hurt is.� When I am through with you, you won�t ever
think of trying to leave me again.�� 

&nbsp;

He gripped my hair and pulled me down, the
hard floor bruising my knees.� Before I
had the change to even yell, he slapped me so hard across the face I fell to
the floor.� Crying now, he lifted me up
again and repeated the slap to the other side of my face, which just sent me to
the floor yet again. I was trying to block his slaps with my hands, so he
grabbed some rope from the wall and tied my hands together so tight he cut off
all the circulation in my fingers.�
Pulling me to my feet with the rope, I had to scream as it just pulled
the rope even tighter. He opened the door and started to drag me back to the
cabin, when I heard the sound of sirens in the distance.

&nbsp;

He pulled me to him and covered my mouth
with his hand and for the first time since I had known him, I could sense his
fear. Pulling me off the path and into the trees, he pushed me down, his hand
still firm over my mouth. The sirens got closer and a police car pulled up
beside the other two cars. Two policemen got out, their guns drawn as they
checked out the area.� One went up to the
cabin door while the other waited at the bottom of the steps.� On a count, the one at the door knocked,
calling out that he was police and to open up.�
When the door did not open, he open it up and I
was shocked to hear a shot ring out. Seeing his body fall back onto the steps
just seemed so unreal and then Billy appeared in the doorway.� 

&nbsp;

The other policeman must have had a clear
view, as the shot he aimed at Billy got him right in the chest, his body
falling back with a thud.� I could see the
wounded cop on the steps moving and his partner checked on him, sitting him up
before he cautiously entered the cabin. Sean pulled me up and started to drag
me back along the path, only stopping when the policeman emerged with a
startled looking Pete behind him.� I
could see him talking into his phone and assumed he was getting his partner
some help. Sean pulled me back off the path and whispered in my ear. �Don�t you
make a sound bitch and I might go easier on you when we get back home.� I was
amazed that he thought he would get home but until I was out of his grasp, knew
anything was possible.� 

&nbsp;

The policeman got Pete to stay with his
partner, while he started to head our way. Sean�s hand again covered my mouth
as the cop got closer.� I wanted to jump
up and tell him we were here, but Sean�s other hand was wrapped around the rope
hanging down from my tied wrists. The cop got so close I could see the tips of
his shoes through the branches of the tree, but he kept on going.� I heard him walk past again until he was back
at the cabin. Sean took the opportunity to keep on going and pulled me along
the path.� The policeman must have heard
us, as the next thing I knew he had his gun aimed as us.

&nbsp;

Sean pulled me in close and taking the
fishing knife from somewhere, he held it to my throat.� I felt his grip tighten around my tied hands
as he manoeuvred me over closer to the car. �Don�t even think about trying it mate, you shot me I cut her.�� At that moment I had no doubt he would do it,
as I had never seen him so desperate.� He
pulled me even closer to him, so close I could feel the outline of his cock
against my back.� It shocked me to think
that amid all this violence he had a hard on.�
The tip of the knife was pressing into my throat and I was trying hard
to move with him so that it would not cut me even more.� 

&nbsp;

He was pulling me backwards, so that I had
no idea what was under my feet, and when I tripped over the stick on the
ground, if it had not been for his hand holding me up, I am sure the knife
would have gone up into my chin.�
Breathing hard, I went into autopilot and just let him move me to his
car.� Even when he sat in the passenger
seat with me and then moved over to the driver�s side after shutting the door,
I did not try to get away. He took a moment to put my seat belt on, so that I
had no change to get out at all without his help.� I was aware of shouts behind us and the sound
of the police car starting up, as Sean sped up the dirt road. I could see the
veins in his neck throbbing and he was gripping his jaw so tight I could hear
him grinding his teeth. I was just starting to think that this was it; I would
never escape him now, when a sound of another siren joined in with the one
behind us.� I looked up to see another
police car heading down the path towards us. Sean cursed and turned the wheel
sharply, causing the car to swerve off the path and onto the grass at the edge
of the road.� 

&nbsp;

Screaming as we veered dangerously close to
the trees at the edge of the road, I clenched my hands tightly together behind
me. �Shut up bitch, it is all your fault we are in
this mess.� The unfairness of his comment hit me and I was just about to
respond, when I saw a huge tree coming up fast in front us. �The tree, watch
out for the�� The sound of the car hitting the tree was deafening, my body
thrown forward with the impact. If not for the seat belt I would have properly
hit my head on the windscreen.� The
engine stopped at almost the same time the sirens did. 

&nbsp;

I opened my eyes to see what had happened
to Sean just as two policemen approached the car, their guns drawn. However
Sean had not moved and I could see the blood starting to run down his
forehead.� My door opened and I saw the
concerned face of a young policeman. �Are you Ok? Do you think you have broken
anything?�� I tried to check, but with my
hands tied it was not easy. �I think I am ok, but if you could get me untied,
that would be great.�� I saw him blush
and he quickly moved to undo my seatbelt and help me out of the car.�� 

&nbsp;

I saw the cop who had moved to Sean�s door
open the door and check Sean�s pulse. �He is still alive, but he needs help
fast.�� No sooner had he finished
speaking then an ambulance came and parked behind the car. I guessed it had
been called for the shot policeman.� I
tried to decide if I wanted him to survive and was shocked when I realised part
of me wanted him dead.� Realising the
young cop was talking to me, I tried to focus on what he was saying. He had
managed to undo the ropes and I was rubbing my sore wrists when he spoke again.
�My boss says you are to come back to the cabin and then we can get you checked
out to see if you are OK.�� 

&nbsp;

I did not argue with him and let him help
me back to the cabin, my legs feeling slightly shaking as I started to think
about what could have been. �Julie, thank god you are OK. When that bastard
drove off, I thought I would never see you again.� I ran into Pete�s arms and
again felt the tears rocking my body.� He
just held me, his gentle hands stroking my hair until I regained enough control
to look at him.� The whole of the left
side of his face had started to swell and his eye was half shut. 

&nbsp;

�Oh Pete, you look terrible.�� I realised how awful that sounded and started
to laugh, and before I knew it we were both almost doubled over in laughter. I
am sure the cops thought we were crazy but I just couldn�t manage to stop.� We were both led into the cabin, the young
policeman trying to get us to sit down despite our now uncontrollable state.� Eventually we managed to calm down, the tears
in my eyes now caused by laughter and not fear.�
Pete wiped my face and then gently kissed me.� It was not the sort of kiss that made me
think he wanted something but was the most honest kiss I had ever had.� 

&nbsp;

He looked at bit embarrassed as he sat back
and I reached out to touch the unbruised side of his face. �Pete, please don�t
regret showing me you care for me. After all I have been through,
I need all the care I can get.�� He
smiled at me and I felt warmed by his concern for me.� A cough behind me made me turn and I again
saw the face of the young cop who had helped me out of the car.� �Um excuse me, but I need to find out some
facts. Now the guy, Billy, what can you tell me about
him?�� I suddenly remember seeing Billy
falling to the floor and looked to where I thought he would have landed.� �What happened to him? I mean, he was here
before, don�t tell me he is still out there
somewhere.� 



Pete reached out to hold me, as the young
cop tried to convince me I was safe. �He didn�t survive, I am afraid. I think
he was moved because we needed to have the way clear.�� I could not describe what I felt as I went
from fear to relief in a matter of minutes.�
�Are you sure, I mean is he really dead?� Pete gently stroked my face.
�Julie, he is definitely dead and I for one am glad, as I think I would
not be here if the police had not arrived when they did.�� Taking his hand in mine, we spent the rest of
the afternoon trying to answer questions and explain what Sean and Billy were
up to.�

Epilogue

&nbsp;

Three months later, Pete and I were back at
the cabin, but this time there was no need to hide out.� The day before we had been
in court, hearing the judge sentence Sean to life in prison.� I had spent the last few weeks testifying in
court to all the things he had done, the experience embarrassing and traumatic,
but in the end I had decided that it was worth it to see Sean pay for what he
had done to me.� The police had also
arrested the Doctor and the man who owned the brothel and both had confessed
after hearing how long they might have to spend in prison. They were both
awaiting sentencing, but at least I knew they had not been allowed bail, so I
had no fear of them coming after me. 

&nbsp;

My family had come down to see me after the
police had rang them to let them know what had happened. I had been feeling a
bit unsure of how they would react, but they were just
so grateful to see me again. They said they had been heartbroken when I had run
off and had not stopped trying to find me. They had spent three weeks with me
and Pete and by the time they had to go back home, I had promised to visit
soon. They had really wanted me to go back home to live, but I didn�t think I
was ready to face my hometown yet.� 

&nbsp;

Pete had been wonderful and over time I
learnt to trust and rely on him to be a shoulder to cry on and a friend to
laugh with. He had given me no reason to mistrust him and had not even tried to
touch me in any way but as a friend.� I
had been grateful to him, not sure yet how I would react to having sex again,
though I was starting to feel ready to try.�
I looked over at Pete, my smile wide and he looked up from the fish he
was preparing for our evening meal. �Hey, what is that look
for?� Anyone would think you didn�t have
a care in the world.�� 

&nbsp;

I crossed over to him and kissed him, not a
friendly kiss but the kind of one that makes your toes curl. Taking him by the
hand, I felt truly free and intended to share that freedom with the man I
loved. �Come on, I think it is time for you to be rewarded for your
patience.�� The look on his face was
priceless and I just had to kiss him again, before pulling him into the
bedroom.� Now I was finally free of Sean,
I wanted to make my own choices and Pete was going to be the first one to
benefit from my new found confidence, I just hoped he was ready for all the
love I had to give.
