BOUND TO ORDER!

By

Anne Gray

&nbsp;

It
was a dark and stormy night!

&nbsp;

No,
really, it was.� Well, in fact, it was
late evening but it was dark and the rain was pelting down as I waited for my
prey. The one I was after seemed to go for fashion rather than practicality and
obviously, as I had counted on, didn�t bother listening to weather forecasts.

&nbsp;

I
had watched her entering the office building earlier, before the forecasted
rain started; dressed in a very smart, fawn coloured hip length coat.� Smart yes, any protection in even a light
drizzle no. She was very beautiful and very vain about her appearance.� Now me, I was completely waterproof.

&nbsp;

Once
she was inside and would be, I knew, for five hours, I drove home and watched
the storm front approaching on the TV�s weather channel.� As soon as it was a certainty that heavy rain
was going to hit I started my preparations.

&nbsp;

The
black leather of my form fitting cat suit was supple and would not hinder my
movements.� The knee boots with 3� block
heels were also black but the material was rubber as were the three designer
fastening straps that held each one snugly around my legs.

&nbsp;

The
raincoat was a masterpiece and my pride and joy after my leathers.� From a standup collar the gleaming sleek
black rubber fell to just above my ankles.�
Buttons every 4� closed it down the left side to a few inches above the
hem.� The skirt was cut to allow full
movement of my legs yet fitted enough that it would not flap around too much in
a wind.� The wide belt pulling it tightly
it in around my waist had a double pin buckle and, inside each sleeve starting
at the elbow, was a second thin rubber sleeve that ended in tight black latex
gloves.

&nbsp;

The
wrist strap buckles matched the larger one on the belt and, even though only
the bottom ones showed, those on the boots.�
Yet another buckle closed under my chin holding the fairly stiff collar
in place.� It was higher at the back of
my neck and then gradually got lower, brushing my ears before dipping under the
sides of my mouth.

&nbsp;

The
wide brimmed hat matched the coat and was based on the sou�wester style.� It had a snug fitting crown and then the
longer back of the brim almost touched my shoulders so that I was fully
protected from any rain or wind on my back.�
The front brim curved across my forehead drooping down almost to my
eyebrows. The whole thing was held firmly in place by a delicate strap under
the chin.

&nbsp;

Oh
yes, except for the oval of my face, which was done with understated makeup, I
was waterproof and I loved wearing this outfit out in the rain. When every one
else was huddled against the weather I enjoyed it.� Tonight, however, the hat and coat were just
part of the equipment to get a job done.

&nbsp;

The
left slash pocket had strips of Velcro just inside that were easy to open but
made it airtight when closed, as it was now.�
I slipped a small wallet in the right hand pocket with my keys and a
couple of other things, picked up the large umbrella that matched the coat and
left to see what else I could pick up!

&nbsp;

A
taxi dropped me at the opposite side of the multi-building office complex and I
used the covered connecting walkways to reach the foyer of my target�s
building.� The timing was just right and
I only had to wait a few minutes before she came out of the elevator and walked
across the deserted foyer to stare out the glass doors at the heavy rain.

&nbsp;

I
moved over to stand beside her and, after a few moments, said, �Oh dear, you
are going to get soaked aren�t you?�

&nbsp;

I
almost held my breath waiting for a reply because, if I had misread her vanity,
the game could well be over.

&nbsp;

She
turned a worried face to me and replied, �I don�t mind about my coat or shoes,
they will dry, but I just spent a small fortune getting my hair done.�

&nbsp;

Bingo,
the game continued!

&nbsp;

�Well,
I am dressed for the weather; I�m not in a hurry and I have this big umbrella
so if you like we can both get under it and I�ll walk you to your car!�

&nbsp;

�Would
you mind, really, I�m parked quite a way away, it was the only spot open when I
drove in.�� I already knew exactly where
she was parked and the fact that it was well off to one side in the now nearly
empty lot.

&nbsp;

�Just
let me get outside to open the umbrella then you come out and we�ll see if we
can get you to your car with your hairdo intact.�

&nbsp;

As I
spoke I pushed open the door and stood under the overhang then thumbed the
button on the handle of the umbrella.�
There was little wind to speak of, even though the rain was very heavy,
so I could manage it with just my right hand.�
She came out and I beckoned her to my left side then put my arm around
her as she ducked under the umbrella.

&nbsp;

We
giggled like a couple of school girls as we splashed through the rain and
puddles.� When we got close to her car I
dropped my left hand to pull open the coat pocket and reach inside.� She had her car key ready and as soon as it
was in the lock I moved directly behind her, pushed forward flattening her
against the side of the car with the weight of my body then covered her nose
and mouth with the cloth in my left hand.

&nbsp;

At
the same time I thumbed the umbrella closed, dropped it on the roof of the car
and circled her body with my right arm.�
So much for the hairdo!� I reveled
in the feel and sounds of the rain bouncing off my coat and hat as her
struggles rapidly came to an end until she went limp.

&nbsp;

Holding
her in place with one arm I unlocked the door and reached in to pop the lock on
the back door.� A couple of moments and
she was sprawled face down across the back seat.� Taking a quick look around and seeing nothing
to be worried about I rescued the umbrella, threw it inside, shoved the cloth
back in its pocket and then joined her on the back seat.� The belt of her coat was quite long enough to
let me get a couple of turns around her elbows, pull them together behind her
back, then tie it off around her wrists.

&nbsp;

A
simple piece of cord held her ankles to the seat post looking after her legs
and the ball gag from my pocket was a tight fit but I managed to get it in her
mouth buckling the strap at the back of her head.� I didn�t expect her to wake up but, in my
business, you don�t take chances.

&nbsp;

Climbing
out in the rain again I rolled her to the floor between the seats, shut the
back door and climbed into the driver�s seat.�
Twenty minutes later I parked the car beside mine in the double garage
closing the automatic door to hide it from view.

&nbsp;

A
quick check told me that little Miss Vanity was still out cold and I moved
through into the house to towel most of the moisture from my rainwear then took
them off and hung them to dry in the laundry room.� I took the cloth out of the pocket, threw it
in a bin and then wiped out the pocket.

&nbsp;

Back
in the garage it took minimal effort to get the limp form out of the car and
settled in a wheel chair then push her through to my special guest room.� Checking the belt tied around her arms and
wrists was secure I left to change my boots.�
The over the knee stiletto heeled pair matched the leather of my cat
suit; I left my hands free of gloves until I finished working on my new
acquisition but did take time to brush my shoulder length blonde hair that had
been somewhat crushed under the rain hat.

&nbsp;

Untying
her except for the gag I stripped off all her clothes and fitted her neck in a
padded stock.� Her wrists clamped against
each end of the board that extended just passed each shoulder.� By this time she was giving indications that
the chloroform was wearing off so I hooked chains from a ceiling pulley to the
eyehooks near the ends of the board and thumbed the switch.

&nbsp;

Once
her body was hanging straight down I lowered it just enough for her bare feet
to touch the floor then buckled cuffs around each ankle hooking them to short
chains from two floor rings.� That done I
dried her hair, completely wrecking anything left of the expensive �do� but I
couldn�t have her getting a chill.

&nbsp;

I left
Gail, for that was her name; to finish waking up while I went to my home office
and contacted my buyer to advise her that the order had been filled and the
contract could be completed as agreed.�
She advised me that it would take a week or so to finalize the pickup
but they would add a nice bonus to the payment if I would look after the
package until then.

&nbsp;

I
thought about the girl in the other room; she was beautiful, very well endowed,
completely at my mercy and I was going to get paid to play with her for a few
days.� Some decisions just don�t take
much thought!

&nbsp;

Selecting
a few items from my collection I carried them through to the hidden room
leaving them on a table while I moved over to stand in front of the girl.

&nbsp;

�Well
now Gail, next time, if there is a next time, I suggest you just let your hair
get wet instead of accepting help from a perfect stranger.�

&nbsp;

Her
huge dark eyes looked me up and down, taking in the skintight leather covering
my body and muffled sounds came from behind the ball strapped in her mouth.

&nbsp;

�Never
mind Gail, I�ll answer your questions later, in the mean time it is getting
late and I want to get to know you better so I�m going to let you share my bed
tonight.� But, for that, we need to get
you dressed in something appropriate and, I�m afraid, suitably restraining.�

&nbsp;

I
pulled down another ceiling chain, buckled the strap at its end around her
right leg just below the knee and then, after undoing the ankle cuff, shortened
it until her foot was lifted almost to waist height.

&nbsp;

�This
is called a ballet boot Gail and they can be very uncomfortable if not fitted
properly.� So I�m going to slide this one
on your foot and then lower your leg.�
You will put all of your weight on the toe to settle it in place.� Do you understand?�

&nbsp;

She
was trying to shake her head in the stock so I grabbed a nipple and twisted
until she got the message and straightened the leg, putting her weight on it
until the foot slid the last inch or so into the shoe of the boot.� I raised her leg again and started the job of
lacing the boot to just below her crotch, stopping part way through to adjust
the ceiling chain to hold her leg up by the ankle

&nbsp;

That
done I hooked the ankle back to the floor ring and repeated the process on her
left leg. As I was working I held a one way chat.� �Oh I know it might seem strange to be
putting these boots on you to go to bed but they are such a turn on and,
believe me, you had better get used to wearing them.� I�ll fix things later so you don�t tear my
satin sheets.�

&nbsp;

The
corset was a thing of beauty in black leather with bright red leather trim and
I fitted it around Gail�s waist, closing the front zip from just above her
crotch to under those beautiful breasts.�
Moving around to the back I started closing the laces until she was breathing
in short gasps through her nose and the edges touched. 

&nbsp;

After
resting for a few minutes I started on the seven half body straps across the
front over the zip.� The corset was
already tight but I managed to get enough pressure on each strap until they
were all closed to within one notch of the maximum.

&nbsp;

The
effect of the corset and the boots on her already shapely form was quite breath
taking and I had trouble keeping my hands off her as I joined them together
with several leather suspender tabs from the bottom of the corset to the top of
the boots.

&nbsp;

�Now
then Gail, this little gadget is a nipple clamp but it�s a very special
kind.�� I held the cone shaped piece of
metal in front of her face.� �How it
works is that I tie a little piece of string around your nipple and feed it
through the cone.� Then I put the whole
thing over your nipple until the bottom is nice and tight against your lovely
breast and use the string to pull your nipple through this hole in the top. Now
this little ring at the top tightens to hold it in place, the string comes off
and then I take this threaded screw with a very sharp point and start it in
this hole part way down the clamp.�

&nbsp;

Her
shocked expression as she followed my pointing finger told me the message was
getting home.

&nbsp;

�Here
we go.� There, now with just one turn of
the screw you will feel the point against the base of your nipple, right?

&nbsp;

She
couldn�t nod but I could tell the sound coming from behind the gag was very
definitely a yes.

&nbsp;

�Good,
here is the second one.�� I rested the
other cone on the stock board right in front of her chin.� �And here is the deal.� I�m going to release your right arm and you
are going remain very still and do exactly as you are told.� If that second clamp falls off the board
because of you moving then I will take a complete turn on the screw of the
first one.� You can guess what that will
feel like and you don�t need any imagination to understand what it will do.�

&nbsp;

It
worked and she stood like a statue as I opened the clamp on her right wrist and
bent the arm down until it was in a position where I could work on the elbow
length kid glove, lacing it tightly in place.�
Following that I folded her fingers into a fist and laced that inside a
tight leather mitt.� A wrist strap
attached to a D ring at the side of the corset.�
She gave me no trouble as I repeated the process with her left arm.

&nbsp;

�That�s
a good girl Gail, now let me take off that nasty old nipple clamp.� You might like to know that if you had acted
up you would now have pierced nipples with nice big rings through them.� Just remember that they can go back on
anytime I feel like it so don�t get me upset.�

&nbsp;

I
released her ankles from the floor rings but kept them connected with a 8�
length of chain then lowered the tension on the ceiling chains and removed the
neck stock.� I steadied the girl as all
her weight came on the toes of the ballet boots and she had trouble balancing
without the use of her arms.

&nbsp;

I
led her over to the bathroom turning her so she could settle on the toilet.

&nbsp;

�You
have five minutes Gail and believe me, you are better off taking advantage of
them than spending the next few hours getting progressively more uncomfortable
so don�t bother being embarrassed.�� I
left her alone but stood just outside the door in case she was stupid enough to
try something; she wasn�t and when time was up I went back in, cleaned her up
and pushed the flush lever.

&nbsp;

�Good
girl, now let�s get back to work.�

&nbsp;

I
hooked a small padlock through the rings at the ends of the fist mitts then
released the clasps holding her arms to the corset.� A padded cuff went around each of her arms
just above the elbows and I joined them with a strap across her back pulling on
it until her lower arms and wrists were held tightly against her sides.

&nbsp;

As
she tottered along in the unaccustomed boots I held her elbow guiding her
towards the narrow leather covered table.�
Backing her up against one end I pushed at her shoulders until she fell
on the table and I could push her along it until it supported her body from head
to upper thigh.� Several straps kept her
from moving and then I released the ankle chain and used the ceiling pulley to
hook on the ankle cuffs and pull her legs up and as wide apart as possible.� Oh boy, it took all my resolve to concentrate
on getting her ready for bed instead of just diving on top of the beautiful,
helpless girl. 

&nbsp;

I
leaned over and stared down at her tear streaked face with its ruined makeup
and widely stretched mouth.

&nbsp;

�You�ve
had that ball gag in for some time now Gail but as soon as I get another couple
of things done I�ll take it out for you.�
I think you would make too much noise if I took it out right now.�

&nbsp;

I
pulled on a pair of tight rubber gloves and held the butt plug up where she
could watch as I coated it with lubricant.�
That done I ran a finger softly up and down her vagina.

&nbsp;

�I
bet you think that this is going in there, don�t you?� Well I�m afraid it is a little small for
there.� I picked this size because I�m
guessing this will be a new experience for you and I�m going to introduce you
to them gently.� It�s called a butt plug
Gail because it goes right in here.�

&nbsp;

I
settled the knob over the puckered rosebud of her anus and gave it a little
push, then a twist and a harder push.�
Her head was shaking from side to side and muffled grunts made their way
passed the gag.� Another twist and a
final shove and the smooth, hard rubber shaft slid home to the flange at the
base.

&nbsp;

�Now
this one is a much better size for your love tunnel.� Does it need some lubricant?� Oh Gail, you naughty girl, my fingers are
sliding all over the place and just look at that cute nub peeking out.� I guess the butt plug wasn�t so bad after all
was it?�

&nbsp;

As I
spoke quietly to the helpless girl I eased the large dildo in place and pushed
it home.� There was a narrow crotch strap
attached to the back of the corset that I pulled through, centered it over the
bases of the two toys and then fed it to the buckle at the front.� Once that was nice and tight I took the wider
leather crotch cover and attached it over the strap with the studs along the
bottom edge of the corset.

&nbsp;

Lowering
her legs I reattached the hobble chain and pulled her along the table until her
feet reached the floor and I could get her standing upright on the tiny toes
and sharp heels of the ballet boots.�
Guiding her over to a heavy straight-backed chair I told her to
sit.� I laughed as her rear end met the
seat, because of the surprised look on her face, as the butt plug made it�s
self known.

&nbsp;

Just
one strap around under her breasts and the chair back kept her in position and
I unbuckled the head harness, put one hand on her forehead and used the other
to work the ball from between her teeth.�


&nbsp;

She
didn�t say a word as she watched me cross the room to the sink and fill a glass
with cool water. �I also ran the water to
warm for soaking a face cloth, threw a towel over my shoulder and returned to
hold the glass so she could drink.

&nbsp;

The
glass empty I put it down and gently wiped her face to remove the tear stains
and damaged makeup.

&nbsp;

�Does
that feel better?� I�m glad you didn�t
start screaming and yelling because nobody but me would hear you and I do so
dislike unnecessary noise.� I guess you
are in a little bit shock with the last few hours aren�t you?

&nbsp;

She
looked up at me and then down to study her naked breasts, the corset and the
boots on her feet and then opened her mouth to speak.

&nbsp;

I am
an expert and as her mouth opened, I jerked her head back with a handful of
hair, slid the ring gag behind her bottom teeth, pushed down and then in so it
settled fully in place.�� The ring was
threaded on the inside and had a narrow leather band around the outside with a
strap that I pulled tight and buckled at the back of her neck.� That produced some weird and completely
unintelligible sounds through the mouth opening.

&nbsp;

Taking
my time I used a rat tail comb and a brush to get her hair into some semblance
of order.� There was nothing left of
whatever she had paid so much for but she did have a lovely head of long dark
hair and, after I had all the tangles out, I pulled it back into a neat
ponytail.

&nbsp;

�It�s
really getting late now Gail so let�s go and get some rest.�

&nbsp;

I
didn�t expect any trouble from her so I took off the ankle hobble then the
strap around her torso and the chair.

&nbsp;

�Come
on now Gail, stand up and come with me.�

&nbsp;

The
inserts were obviously bothering her but I put an arm around her and led her up
to my bedroom.� I peeled back the covers,
pushed her down on the bed and grabbed her legs to swing them up.� The soft sheepskin pouches covered the boots
to her ankles and then I added a short hobble chain hooking it, in turn, to the
rail at the foot of the bed.

&nbsp;

I
adjusted her body until her head was on one of the satin pillows, told her to
stay still and then went for a shower.�
My long satin nightgown rustled as I came back to the bed and looked
down at Gail.� I leaned over and stuck my
tongue in through the ring gag for a little tongue tag then picked up the
insert from the night table and screwed it in place shutting off the
whimpering.

&nbsp;

Climbing
in on the other side of the bed I pulled the covers up over the two of us,
pushed her over on her side and made like a pair of spoons.� My right arm pulled her tightly to me and I
cupped a breast, playing softly with the nipple and I whispered in her ear.

&nbsp;

�We
have at least a week to go together so get some sleep and we�ll have more fun
in the morning.�� I didn�t mention the
vibrator waiting on the night table!

&nbsp;

Then,
with the order filled, the contract complete, my bank account substantially
fatter and a week of fun ahead, I drifted off to sleep.
