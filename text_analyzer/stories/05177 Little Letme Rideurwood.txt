Little Letme Rideurwood

- Sam Darquesied



Dancing shadows played on the forest floor as Little Letme Rideurwood pranced and skipped through the woods. She had turned eighteen that day, and her years of seclusion were now over as she eagerly headed to grandmother�s house for the arranged match to the boy from Gottlotts. Little Letme�s isolation had kept her innocent, na�ve, and pure, the only acceptable pairing that a rich boy from Gottlotts would consider. Grandmothers from the poor village of Gottnunn have always been responsible for arranging these couplings for as long as anyone could remember.



Little Letme knew nothing of the outside world; her only joy was the forest and all the creatures therein. As she happily bounced along she came upon a man in a red suit and top hat�



�Hello, pretty young lass, how are you today? My name is Mr. Wolfe,� said the man in the red suit.



�I am very well, kind sir. My name is Little Letme Rideurwood,� said Little Letme.



�And where are you off to on this fine day, Little Letme?� said Mr. Wolfe.



�I am eighteen today, Mr. Wolfe, and I am off to my grandmother�s to meet my boy from Gottlotts.� said Little Letme.



Mr. Wolfe said, �Then it is a very special day for you, my dear, I trust you did well with your inspection?�



Puzzled, na�ve Little Letme said, �My inspection, Mr. Wolfe? I have had no inspection.�



A very concerned Mr. Wolfe said, �Oh dear. You are a very brave young miss.�



�I do not think I am brave, kind sir,� said Little Letme



Mr. Wolfe said, �Oh pretty miss, you do know that if the boy was to discover a flaw then he might reject you and your beloved grandmother would lose her standing in the community. Why, she�d probably have to move away!�



�Oh my, Mr. Wolfe, I would not want that to happen! I must find an inspector right away!�



�Well, as luck would have it, I am an inspector,� said the man in the red suit.



This made Little Letme very happy, �Oh, kind sir, I know it is a terrible imposition but, would you consider inspecting me?�



Mr. Wolfe pondered a moment then said, �Oh, Miss, I am very busy at this time of the year but� to protect your dear grandmamma� I will agree to inspect you now.�



�That is wonderful Mr. Wolfe, you are very kind and generous,� said a grateful Little Letme.



�Think nothing of it,� said Mr. Wolfe, �Shall we begin?�



Little Letme was very happy with her good fortune, �Oh, yes� please, Mr. Wolfe.�



�Very well,� said Mr. Wolfe, �please tell me what you are wearing.�



Little Letme said, �I am very poor, Mr. Wolfe, so all I have is this simple dress and my panties underneath.�



A perplexed Mr. Wolfe said, �Panties? What are panties?�



�Why, panties are undergarments which I wear around my middle.�



A concerned Mr. Wolfe said, �Please remove your dress so I can see these things you call �panties�.�



Little Letme quickly strips herself of the dress to reveal the white undergarment and the man in the red suit says, �Oh my! It is fortunate that we have inspected� this is a flaw, my dear; the boy would have been very upset if he had seen these. You must be rid of them immediately.�



�I am so sorry, kind sir, I hope I did not upset you,� said Little Letme as she removed the offending garment and threw it away.



A greatly relieved Mr. Wolfe said, �I was upset but I am better now� you must place your arms behind you so that I may inspect you closely, for physical flaws.�



Little Letme did as instructed and the man in the red suit began by inspecting her mouth and teeth. Declaring them satisfactory he moved to her shoulders, arms, and hands. Giving these a passing grade, Mr. Wolfe began to inspect her bosom and said, �These are very lovely, miss, but I think they may be too sensitive, for I do believe that you are feeling ill.�



�I do not think I am ill, Mr. Wolfe, but I do have a strange feeling in my tummy and, I think that I feel moisture betwixt my nethers,� said a worried Little Letme.



The man in the red suit said, �Ah, yes. I have seen this before. Please spread your legs so that I may examine this moistness.�



Little Letme spread very wide but the man in the red suit said it must be wider still. She spread wider and wider until she began to lose her balance and said, �I�m sorry, kind sir, but I cannot spread wider without falling.�



The kindly Mr. Wolfe said, �Yes, I can see that this is difficult for you, my dear� Although it is reserved for only very special young misses, I suppose we could use the official inspection station.�



�The official inspection station?� asked Little Letme.



Mr. Wolfe explained, �Yes, my dear, you see the official inspection station allows for easy examination of the subject while enabling the young miss to hold her position with very little effort. Only the very best inspectors have them.�



�Oh, please, kind sir, I know I am not special but I would be very grateful if you would allow me the use of the official inspection station,� said Little Letme.



The man in the red suit showed Little Letme to the official inspection station which was two trees and a great pile of rope. Mr. Wolfe proceeded to wrap several coils around Little Letme�s tiny waist and then attached two more lengths, both front and rear, to the waist rope. The man in the red suit tossed the ends of these two ropes up and over a high tree limb, and then instructed Little Letme to lie on her back. Mr. Wolfe then fastened the ends of two long ropes to the young Little Letme�s ankles.



�Now, Miss Rideurwood, if you are ready, I will lift you into the proper official inspection station position.�



Little Letme, ever so grateful that she was permitted to use the official inspection station, said she was ready and Mr. Wolfe hoisted the young miss until she was upside down with her lovely head three feet from the ground. The man in the red suit then pulled on each ankle rope until Little Letme�s legs were straight out to her sides. Lastly, Mr. Wolfe bound the hands of the young miss behind her and pulled until they were straight back from her shoulders. Little Letme now resembled the capital letter T which was the proper official inspection station position.



Little Letme asked, �Are you able to examine me properly now, kind sir?�



Mr. Wolfe replied, �Oh, yes, young miss, everything is perfectly accessible now.�



A beaming Little Letme said, �I am so glad and I cannot tell you how grateful I am for your generosity.�



�Well, let us examine the moisture between your legs and, do you still feel the odd sensation?� asked Mr. Wolfe.



Little Letme answered, �I am sorry to report, Mr. Wolfe, that the sensation in my tummy has increased.�



The man in the red suit said, �I see� now, you say it is in you tummy but,� placing his hand on Little Letme�s abdomen �is it not actually here?�



Little Letme said, �Why� yes, Mr. Wolfe, I believe it is, and� I�m afraid, kind sir, that it is continuing to increase. Is this a flaw?�



Mr. Wolfe explained, �It is, my dear, but it is one that we can repair. You see, this is not your �tummy�� inside you is your �vagina� and that is where the sensation is located. And here,� placing his fingers between her legs �is the opening to the vagina.�



Young Little Letme was beginning to pant and said, �Oh, Mr. Wolfe, I fear that the flaw may be very serious, as the sensation increased again when you examined the opening.�



 �Do not fret, my dear, I have had much experience with this you will be fine once you have received treatment,� Mr. Wolfe calmly said, �and the treatment is a quite simple, two step process. The first step is medication and the second is to direct the medicine to the proper location.�



Little Letme said, �Oh, kind sir, do you have such medication and how do you direct it to the proper location?�



Mr. Wolfe, placing his experienced finger on Little Letme�s clit, said, �I direct the medicine by tapping and sometimes rubbing this�it is called your �clitoris�.� 



�Oh my, Mr. Wolfe, I think I should be treated soon! When you examined my clitoris, the sensation increased yet again! May I have some of the medicine?�



�Yes, my dear,� said Mr. Wolfe, �you may have some medicine. Now, the medicine is inside me so you must drink it from my dispenser while I direct it to your troubled vagina. We must do this properly or it may not be successful.�



Little Letme said, �I am such a stupid girl, kind sir, I do not know where you dispenser is.�



Mr. Wolfe removed his red pants and held his dispenser in front of Little Letme�s face, �When the time is right, you will take my dispenser into your mouth and drink the medicine. You may need to suck quite hard to draw the liquid out and rubbing the dispenser with your tongue often improves the flow. I will direct it to the correct location at the same time. Are you ready Miss Rideurwood?�



�Yes,� said Little Letme, �I am ready and I am very grateful for your kindness.�



Mr. Wolfe said, �Think nothing of it, my dear� now let us begin.�



Young Little Letme parted her sweet, full lips and took the dispenser into her mouth as the kindly Mr. Wolfe indicated where the medicine should go by rubbing her clitoris and sliding his fingers into her� for added assurance.



The young, panting miss stopped for a moment and said, �Oh, Mr. Wolfe� the sensation is becoming very, very strong now!�



Mr. Wolfe, panting as well, said, �That is perfectly normal, my dear, but you must continue or the medicine will not work.�



Little Letme again took in the dispenser and, knowing that she must get as much medicine as possible, sucked very hard and rubbed with her tongue.



�You are doing very well, my dear,� said Mr. Wolfe, �is the sensation still building?�



Little Letme, busy with the dispenser, said, �Uh huh��



Panting very hard and realizing that his medicine would flow very soon, said, �Now� young � miss� soon you may feel� the sensation get� very strong and� change to a different� feeling. You must� tell me� when that� happens� but you must� suck even harder� at the same�time.�



Little Letme could tell that Mr. Wolfe was correct. The sensation was quite strong now� then suddenly it changed. The young miss felt her body tense and there were strange convulsions in her �vagina�. She sucked very hard because she knew she must have the medicine now... and she must tell the kind sir�



�Uh huh� uh huh� UH HUHUHHUHUHHUH!�



She was so happy when she felt the medicine gush into her mouth and she sucked and licked to get as much as the kindly Mr. Wolfe would allow.



Little Letme thought she must be cured as the sensations began to ebb because she could tell that she had received a great deal of medicine.



Mr. Wolfe withdrew his dispenser and said; �You did very well, my dear, I think we are well on the way to correcting this flaw.�



Little Letme asked, �Am I cured now, kind sir? Is the flaw repaired?�



Mr. Wolfe said, �It was a very good beginning but more treatment is in order. We will have to put you into a different official inspection station position.�



�Will I get more medicine, Mr. Wolfe?� asked Little Letme.



�Yes, my dear,� said the kindly Mr. Wolfe, �and the new position will allow me to deliver the medication directly to the problem area.�



�You are most munificent, kind sir�, said Little Letme Rideurwood.
