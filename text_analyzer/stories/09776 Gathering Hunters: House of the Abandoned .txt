_ Splitting Up _

Upon a small collective island of Cuba, we find a green lavishing weeded overgrown dirt path leading to a splitting crossroad with a massive amount of shadowing forest in its straight directive middle. While a group of armed, armored, talkative yet silently trained gathered men of unified strangers walk grouped together. Heading forward, with unparallel ambitions�

�Fig�uhhh, sir? Ummm�.�, a bearded man named Rocke speaks up near the groups backend, unable to meet their leader&#8217;s gaze. Intentionally he just peer into the dirt at their dusty boots.

�Come out with it Rocke�, their aged wrinkling skinned leader, Fig, demanded sternly with silent haste, halting the group several feet before the thick forest trees, stationed between the crossroads.

�How much further is this�.house�, Rocke sprouted, looking only once upon Fig&#8217;s leering eyed impatience, which the other six shifted their view up upon their leader in their comrades place since they all felt mutually in doubt.

�Please, oh please, don&#8216;t distrust this information of ours. Its extremely reliable, never have we once run into problems. We might be strangers yet the promised exchange rate should of covered everything right?�, Fig calmly explained, while everyone&#8217;s face still wore a heavy unsureness, giving his spine a annoying chill.

�Yeah, its not that, but�.we&#8216;re all a little uncertain�, Concer of a wide burned scar upon his right sided face, from his nose upwards into most of his missing haired skull top. He spoke cautiously yet glared. 

�Suspicious? C&#8216;mon, if anyone has second thoughts. Please speak up now. We have a time schedule, promises too keep�, Fig noted, rubbing his eyes, too avoid their seekings.

�We&#8216;re nearly a few miles from their little cavern home. Where a hefty exchange awaits us�, Fig continued confidently with a chuckling smile.

�Soooo, exactly whats the-�, still witnessing their unblinking doubt filled expressions of his newly hired crew, he frustratingly sighed before beginning to speak his mind till their group rookie poked in.

�No trust�. you old bastard!�, A shorter man of the group, younger indeed, a tattooed leering eye had been predominately placed next to that left socket upon his face.

�Look, no one has the balls to say it, but I know a beat up old fool when I see one. Obviously, if you could take these bitches down we&#8216;d not be needed. However, if you&#8216;ve looked in the same mirror-�, with his voice raging up amongst his sight towards Fig, everyone cleared the way for them too sprawl once again.

�Owwfh!�, in a flash, Covy was lifted up into the air by Fig&#8217;s hand alone, in the shape of punch denting stomach.

�Any other comments? Beyond this little shit&#8217;s!�, shaking in a phase, ridding the grin from Covy&#8217;s face.

�Yeah�Fuck you Captain-�, though in blinking pain, Covy managed to speak up.

�Ouch! Damni-�, before being thrown into the dirt, slammed with a stomp by Fig once again before another speech of confidence rolled off their overshadowing leader&#8217;s wrinkling tongue.

�Fine, I&#8216;ll leave you six to deal with these�.murdering fugitive women�, surprised they all waited to hear more, including the squirming Covy under his boot restraint.

�Theres over twelve so watch every step, remember, their quite skilled. They&#8216;ve been living in the wilderness nearly decades, long before the crack down, their keen awareness too survive surpasses our own. Even mine, yet I have a proposition for you all, that should cheek up some motivating smiles�, pecking a smile himself before carrying on, ensuring Covy was under lockdown without a chance too interfere anymore.

�While I am an older man, these muscles and senses are a bit warn. Thus I need a team, let me make this clear though. Before I get back, for every woman your able too�.secure alive, you&#8216;ll be given ninety-five percent of that particular slave&#8216;s future bounty and exchange rate when we sell her off. That&#8217;s forty percent higher then what I promised before our venture started. Same goes for any men, though their merely worth the thrill of killing, since the local officials are going to kill them away. Its still counts towards your favor. Overall I have business contracts that must be filled, even if I starve a bit, greatness can&#8216;t be achieved without sacrifice�, grabbing Covy by the hair, and pulling him along back the way they all came. Past their group&#8217;s crew, who we&#8217;re a bit overwhelmingly stunned in reaction.

�Hope that should be generous enough, now come on Covy. Time for us to meet eye to olden eye�, Covy kicking and resisting yet following along with struggling despair in the next disciplinary beating to come.

�Lets go then, you heard him, faster we move, grander the reward awaiting. I&#8216;m sure he&#8216;ll take his time, the kid&#8216;s had it out for Fig since we we&#8216;re hired on last week. Its hilarious actually�, Concer stated, laughing with his hand muffling such noise.

�Please everyone, tranquilizers out and ready, ensure your actual pistols are prepared too. We&#8216;re going up against Witches after all. More then anyone could count on their hands-�, Hokkin stated, a man emitting cold steel yet alluring as if full of heart warm freshly cried caring tears.

�Worry worry worry, Hokkin, your just too much. Besides, we&#8216;d use our toes if both hands we&#8216;re full�, C.M. chuckled along with his gold plated shining basketball shaped descriptive earrings bounced about, patting his comrade on the back. While Hokkin, merely gave a grave stare in return, ruining the mood.

�Still, do you really trust the old geezer�, Hokkin continued to mention, as their one handed dart guns we&#8217;re unbolted from their hips.

�Who in this world, can someone trust anymore?�, Zogh, brought up the thought, putting his dart clip into its placement as they continued walking into the forest between the crossroads.

�Can you tell us that-�, focusing the question too everyone in the group, before being interrupted by C.M.

�Hush! I hear two high pitched voices, two luscious younger sounding checks, walking straight towards us. Alright boys, quietly�, C.M. whispered, as they quickly maneuvered huddled below in crouches as they moved forward.



_&nbsp; Suspicious Findings _

We follow Fig and Covy, to their disciplinary scene beyond a hill not far from the dirt crossroad forest�.

�Let me go! Fucking dusty corpse�, Covy silently revolted, while Fig merely tugged him along. Nearly dragging him through their pervious footsteps on the dirt road. 

�You&#8216;ll in for it now, damn disrespectful little shit�, smiling, Fig punched Covy in the nose before continuing onward towards a stray hill near the path. Seeing their crew walking onwards into the forest, disappearing in a rush.

�Owh! Errrgh!�, Covy invoked holding his bleeding nose, going limp on his padded armored lower half. Yet while in the amidst towards being literally dragged behind their leader over the grassy dirt.

�Keep moving or I&#8216;ll throw your ass down this upcoming hill�, dragged up to his feet, Fig now began too push him along in front of him. Letting the bundled amount of hair from Covy go.

�Hold on�.�, Covy stated, giving Fig a slight chuckle to the taller man&#8217;s already worn smile, as they now both looked towards the forest, the very same their crew dived into while they stood near a rounded hill top.

�Are they still watching?�, Covy whispered, releasing his no longer bleeding nose. Breaking it back into place, wiping away his few actful suffering tears.

�Obviously not, nor do you sense them right?�, Fig asked, walking onward past Covy, who merely stared in absolute certainty. Laughing within as the images of thier brainless hired group wouldn&#8217;t know what hit&#8217;em.

�Thought so, mmmm�, Fig grinned, looking down the hillside at the army entitled truck being camouflaged behind a larger rock formation.

�Are you getting a new thrill Fig?�, Covy interrupted after catching up behind he.

�Never realized you enjoyed dragging a man by the hair with such a dandy smile worn sooooooo maliciously�, Covy giggled to himself standing next too and shadowed by Fig upon the hilltop.

�I wasn&#8216;t�smiling..was, I?�, Fig asked nervously, smiling again, knowing Covy was correct either way.

�Sure none of those fools figured it out yet anyhow. Stop worrying yourself Figgy. We got things to do after all�

�Yeah, your certainly right, just a bit paranoid perhaps. After Rocke&#8216;s little questing which everyone shared�
 
�You&#8216;d think, after twenty different assignments like this, it would be so easy to control your movements. Anticipate enemies and one&#8217;s crew. Yet-�

�Stop talking to yourself, freaks me out�, Covy chuckled, looking down and out at the wildlife surroundings in the distence.

��oh, right, your searching down the hill, my apologies�

�We&#8216;re standing on-�, all that had been said before Covy found himself tumbling down the hill into the long grassed dirt below.

�I&#8216;m standing on top of the hill, while your searching at its bottom. Seems that way to me at least, what do you think Covy?�, sitting on his behind, Covy looks up to Fig&#8217;s smiling self, giving a cold stare.

�This won&#8216;t be forgotten, ya know�, muttering too himself through a whisper.

�Quit talking to yourself. Its darn right creepy�

�Takes one to know one smuck!�, Covy wordly struck back, at a surprisingly empty hilltop.

�Did you find anything?�, words came up besides him without warning, causing Covy to jump amidst getting to his feet with Fig&#8217;s handed assistance after his less serious words followed with another deep chuckle. They calmly moved to the truck behind the natural rock formation.

�Yeah, we both saw it from atop of that damn hill!!! Moron!�, Covy finally bursted out among a little uneasy frustration, which caused Fig another cheerfulness.

�Uh, don&#8216;t sneak up on me like that either!�, Fig looked puzzledly at his comrade&#8217;s statement. He&#8217;s never complained till now that is, its always a pleasure to tease Covy, though. He takes thing too seriously, thus such priceless overreactions.

�Whine whine whine whine, lets just break in our new vehicle�, Fig teased, as together they pulled away the rock camouflage covering trap. Though Covy couldn't obtain the keys to open the doors, thus he began searching the vehicle.

�Let me find the keys-�, Covy explained bending down at the tucks backend, which in doing so he found Fig&#8217;s pinky finger managed too slip itself alerting tiny self into and up his rear, catching him off guard.

�C&#8216;mon, search for them, before you spill yourself�, Fig merely smiled at Covy's tenseness, through a few heavy breaths he managed too melt everything into a mixed pleasing discomfort.

�No fair, I wasn&#8216;t expecting-�, when Covy voiced his disapproval, Fig kept his distance far as possible yet began swiftly wiggling his pressuring squeezed finger within. Causing another tense dance by he, for one's viewing smiling delight.

�Move soldier, tick tock tick tock�, taking a more comfortable position behind Covy directly as he huddled down into the search, flustering at his leader&#8217;s tender grasps through the padded armor&#8217;s gaps over his dancing. Embarrassingly enough, something hanging not even an inch below that rear anal canal grew with a passionate hardening thickness which Fig's fingers found itself mindlessly touching over his armored pants, flinching its ever so stiffing completion with humble sticky drips out its tip.

�Screw you�, Covy mildly whispered, as they move around all around the truck. Covy's palms we're dity and wet from the grass and dirt mix. His frustration couldn't be contained yet was instead overwritten by a lustful pleasure that grew unsteadily without end. 

�Maybe later�.�, Fig finally replied giving his bent fingered dog a more blushing lost mind at hand and foot, adding a heavy flexing of his pinky. Growing himself in dwindling patientce that remained strudry at he patted silently the keys in that upper uniformed pocket within the shirt. Bumping himself purposely upon Covy&#8217;s armored rear ended ass, reminding them both of the memories they&#8217;ll create once this tedious deed is complete.

Surprisingly enough however, Fig stopped Covy and unlocked the drivers side door from the very key he fished from his uniformed jacket&#8217;s chest concealed pocket. Even jingling the metal at his comrade&#8217;s bent over amazed gaping expression, chuckling as he pulled Covy over too himself. Pushing him inside before hopping up in himself. All the while, never allowing that rear ended canal dug finger too drift from its grace. As he shut and locked the door, tapping the key back into his upper pocket,. �Now then, lets break this vehicle in while our boys are out at play�, Fig murmured with a tender swift grip over Covy&#8217;s neck&#8216;s hair felt backside, locking their lips, mutually beginning their relieving suckling.

Soon their hands found themselves wandering with lust peering in their lost eyes. Their minds, becoming lighter as the movement of every warmth touching act came and went leaving behind an ever growing delightful thickening stiffness. Both of their pant&#8217;s and armor were discarded laying upon the truck&#8217;s cleanly scented cab floor. After another maneuvering, both of they shared the passengers seat, sitting enmeshing both of thier bodies on the one mid size seat, locking their stare and puckering lips without end. As both of their hardened lower selves found the other&#8217;s hand stroking without end in utter passionate cressingness while shushing those dripping sticky white hand webbing seeds, smearing such affection up and down upon each other&#8217;s erected burning hardened statures.

Fig, plotted Covy&#8217;s elegantly lost self onto his lap from the shared seat, upon his one thigh halting those passionate strokes and instead fitted himself comfortably while spreading both legs steadily enough. Shifting him further down, till over his aroused dripping clear white slippery stroked thick length. Covy, wasn&#8217;t lost enough not to know what was occurring, about too give way. He stood up from Fig&#8217;s thigh, raising his ass high, nearly a few inches from his partner&#8217;s face. In which Fig only blew a strong warm current with his rounded focused mouthed lips between Covy's ass cheeks, onto that burning flitching slightly opened taboo rear entrance. While their aroused meaty thigh bound strength merely expanded, sweating silk in their building pressure.

Fig&#8217;s hands clenched Covy by the shoulders, leaning forwards, from which he began pulling his lover down onto his stiff self. Noticfitly giggling as their swords twinged against one another in the desired sitting, as if one wide unity had been formed. Though instead of getting up, Covy began the mutual count down. While Figs supported his lesser weighted self upon his stomach, seated oddly, yet then a sudden hand found itself heavily stroking both of them simultaneously. Patting their width's together at their bulged dripping sensitive top heads. Hard strokes stretched they outwards from their bases, in which Covy&#8217;s hanging warm sacks overwhelmingly sat upon Fig&#8217;s length&#8217;s origin from above. Adding a more desirable fuel too the fire.

Each hard gripping pull, splattered bits more over the trucks interior, besides his over already drenched palmed hands. Fig&#8217;s grasp tightened around Covy&#8216;s hips as a result of that pleasure building beyond his handle, both of his booted feet clenched while only able too witness the backside shadow of his partner. Amidst the uncontrollably felt distinguishing suspenseful pleasure, just on the other unseen side. Raising his thicknesses desire in spilling out further and further with each hesitantly stroke forward. Yet soon, Covy rushed his own erected length in several caresses, as the pressure became unbearable even for he. While feeling Fig&#8217;s own came close too exploding he halted every touch while feeling that body also shaking. An all tell tale sign, besides, there was only one chance he had at this.

Sitting up, allowing Fig too bare a mutual exploding witness upon their hardened selves rubbing up against once another amongst those sticky heavy fleshy strokings that continued. Covy bent himself downwards, his mouth over their lower thicknesses tips as both we&#8217;re vigorously pumped thoroughly in a rashful quickness, crossing the pleasured pressure. Both of their bodies shook in moans at the spilling white seed that flourishing outward over Covy&#8217;s face, shooting out into his upside down wide lipped gaping mouth. While dripping elsewhere, flowing over his eye tattoo, hitting the floor after smoothing over his face. Their glaring lust was only beginning. Slowly, in a few many sectioned gulps, Covy swallowed every drop of his own and Fig&#8217;s spilled white seed, smiling afterwards with such a evident coating slimed between as with around every tooth. This marvelous string of sights, drove their hardening selves into full swing once more.


_ Two Down _

Lets return too those six sneaking soldiers as they approach two young women in a&nbsp; forest clearing�.

�You know we can&#8216;t be this far away�, the white yellow bloodstained belt tightened robed, young woman pressed as the other of a dirty worn tank top, short skirt, and a surprising clean woodland camouflage cap with the extended outward heavily arched flap blocking the sun&#8217;s gaze from her face entirely.

�Complaining again? Just follow my lead�, the capped young woman responded as they lunged further into the forest clearing, till discovery of the rising morning sun shined down upon&#8217;em through amassed varied sized tree limbs hung from above.

�This&#8217;ll be enough, any further and we&#8217;ll risk being seen by travelers�, the white robed woman urgently stated, nervously shifting revoltly on a rotton log spreading herself out in a relaxing fashion. Soaking up the sun&#8217;s rays with both eye&#8217;s closed, sighing slightly, while a few soldiers near in waiting got a between thigh eye full at that pair of luscious lower lips.

�Fine by me�, the capped woman agreed, looking around while the soldiers remained ducked in cover, leering with their tranquilizer gunned sights at the ready. Shortly, she turned around heading back to the log where her fellow adventurer sat. At which time, she too enjoyed the luxury of the sun&#8217;s warmth and along side relaxing stretches.

�Could you at least look concerned Syrere, you were grounded by the Elder Sister for a reason�

�We have to train Isabel, keep our strength up. If those other brats get ahead of us, we&#8216;re not going to have much of a chance at having our way anymore�, Syrere continued explaining amidst thought.

�Or has that little mind of yours forgotten already�, pointing at Isabel with a giggling face, while refitting her cap.

�Its not that, concerning our disclosure deep with in the wood... like this�, turning towards Syrere, twisting her mouths lips nervously.

�Assumed you might�carry other intentions besides-�, upon those chatting mouthed lips from above, Isabel found Syrere&#8217;s own suckling tongue bringing too life their mutual desired assumptions.

�Any more noise and you might attract other people, so shhhhh�, halting their kiss, giggling, at the known audience watching around them. Both women drooped down from their seating upon the log, too laying over one another locked in their tongue pursuing handless eye shut peckerings.

Undoing Isabel&#8217;s white short reaching thigh robe, reveling her bare natural beauty along side her unshoed feet and pantieless lipped notch below her waist. Placing those, along side her own worn out pair of panties onto a near by logs rotting sticking out twing. Syrere climbed over Isabel, as she lied upon the ground and her head nearest the log. She above, positioned herself upon that very same rotting piece of wood, bending over, splitting both legs far apart over Isabel&#8217;s blushing red innocent face.&nbsp; Lowering herself, further and further, while her below's small tiny tongue flicked into the air. Herself learning upward, under Syrere&#8217;s approached legged spread arch, yet halting just when her tongue below contacted those tender sensitive wet lips.

Syrere&#8217;s mouth, eyes, and being, flinched tensely at the smooth saliva induced licking sensational slenders coating her virgin tight seal underneath. And those presently disgustingly sniffed intruders, excited her even more. Isabel continued, only her tongue&#8217;s tiny tip stroked that shadowed fleshy delight reigning from atop. Then a sudden thrashing shouted interrupting the scene, only a few feet away in the bushes.

�Arghh! Fovx!�, shouted Concer, as he rose up from the plant life concealing him, with a mother fox on her left arm. Sinking its fangs into his padded armor, till he threw her off elsewhere as the two young woman before them widened their eyes.

"Could I just shoot him now, and pretend that idiot didn't get seen...nor was with us?", Cerbustnn angrily joked in sarcasm, still ducking out of sight in the bushes near by while everyone else felt similar.

�Intruders!�, Isabel shouted with a horrify surprised expression, it was only at this time did she know others were watching. Her cupped hands and latching arms covered every nippled breast and aroused wet lower lip. Forgetting she even had a robe near by.

�Oh godsh...peepers�, unlike Isabel, Syrere knew all along there we&#8217;re others. It was a thrill on its own too see what would of happened next. If any of them perhaps decided too begin stroking themselves at the artful scene. So with a giggle, she undertoned this erupt annoyance that ruined such lovely fun, as with what could of been.

�Move in boys, secure both bitches before their able to even yelp�, C.M. commanded with his trained sight directly upon Syrere&#8217;s clothed self. While the rest of the five crew members rose up and rushed in from the bushes into the clearing. However, they halted at a contradicting directive.

�Hold on!�, Syrere boldly demanded, letting her frustration steam out in that raged voice.

�Why are you here? I&#8216;d rather not assume anything�, she continued, no one said a word yet merely waited, holding their ground as the sun above turned gloomy by passing clouds.

�Umm, well, we&#8216;ve come-�, Rocke began saying with a nervous creak.

�Don&#8216;t fucking chat, shoot&#8216;em�, C.M. interruptedly gave an order, in which all followed, however every single dart fired missed their targets.

�Dodged?�, Concer confusingly admitted in defeated astonishment.

�Hmmm, dart guns so� slave traders?�, Syrere mumbled to herself, amusingly dodging in dance.

�Nope, try again dorks�, Syrere giggled by the air chiming missiles passing through, while everyone loaded their last dart clips into their weapons yet never firing.

�They hit me! Damn!�, Isabel, fell onto her knees, quickly laying into an unconscious state.

�Relax, pull it out, I&#8216;ll protect us-�, despaired after noticing Isabel had been put down she looked upon the trees as the slave traders all reloaded. She thought of a plan, before the next shot had been fired.

�I declare a challenge against the leader of this pathetic crew�, Syrere commanded.

�On what grounds?�, C.M. growled as Hokkin approached him, dragging them both unspeakably into the woods.

�What did I say?�, Syrere snickered, while retaining a calm hand hipped face.

�No offense, your not our boss C. M.. And we don&#8216;t have a lot of darts too spare, we should investigate if not interrogate how many other hostiles there might actually be�, Hokkins whispered as Rocke came over as well.

�Do it then, rather not waste any more time. Obviously their not normal, we need extreme precautions�, C.M. stated.

�You, Rocke, I need a second alone away from this scene. As for your conversation with this�.Witch, stall her by any means�, Rocke nodded and returned out into the clearing with Hokkin, as C.M. remained unseen yet knowingly in the area.

�Alright�

�Whats your name miss� 

�I&#8216;m Syrere, Syrere Vjolk, and you sir?�

�Ummmm, my name&#8217;s�ummm, Rocke Fobbinoi miss Syrere�

�Manners? I&#8216;m rather delighted�

�However, sorry we had to meet under these circumstances. Yet your quite the delicious sight sir Rocke�

�Don&#8216;t tell me! You we&#8216;re watching during�.when my friend and I, mingled? And thus fluttered from a welcomed rock hard boiling with steam waiting to be freed. That about right?�

�Yes miss, and I was bit caught off guard by your compliant, as the same should be given. Your astonishingly��pretty. Goes without saying, if we could of met in another time and place, our own bodies could have mingled from dawn till rise�
�Sadly-�

�If that&#8217;s what you really want, then lets challenge one another. If your able to beat me down into the ground, I&#8216;ll be all yours�

�How would it work, theres no way a woman, a Witch, who would obey anyone other then themselves�

�Yes, sorry I should of explained. Which you would be interesting in knowing, right?�

�Continue�

�At our household, we have rules to live by. If your able to concur it, you&#8217;ll control it�
 
�Between two people, the first to flip their front or backside onto the ground entirely wins�

�Which explains why we&#8216;re out here, far from home. Due too troublesome�.anyhow, here we are�

�Do you accept my challenge or not, Rocke?�

�Ummmmmm��

�Yes, I&#8216;ll become yours fully without restraint, however. This is a one on one fight, and if it&#8217;s the other way around. I must have your word upon that life, don&#8216;t even think about breaking this agreement or rushing me. Look above us, on the limbs��

�Judging from your silence and blank stares, the shattered bones and punctured skulls, along side those fresh rotting remains were more then enough. Too prove, we are witches, worse is yet to come. These woods are possessed, any wrong moves towards me. And you&#8217;ll be dismembered into bits�, Syrere stated, moving her hands all around herself. Guiding the gazes of the slave traders too sweat even more.

�Including, rejecting my friendly hospitality�

�Rocke, please, step forward. Let me be the first to root you on, to being the first volunteer for-�, Syrere smiled and suggested before a downward man&#8217;s boot planted itself into her skull from mid air.

�Gotcha!�, C.M. shouted breaking a tree branched limp from high above Syrere in the clearing. Smashing himself upon the Witch, knocking her out cold, along side a few more painful hits ensuring a peace state remained while all others began gathering around their comrade and his two captive unconscious Witches.

�Don&#8216;t seem that surprised, you should of seen this coming, besides that tree business was a bluff. Had to have been, or we would have been sliced long before reaching this point�, C.M. gave confidence while smiling about, huffing and puffing in exhaustion.

�Yeah�yet we&#8216;ve all heard stories of those female Witches harboring usual capabilities�, Hokkin thought aloud, looking around at the sleeping young women nervously.

�That&#8217;s right! For concealment, defending their homes, and assaulting any foolish trespasser�, Zogh replied with an alarming jump in his voice, which others shared.

�Everyone be on your guard, don&#8216;t let anyone out of your sight, stay close�, C.M. commanded.

�Great job Rocke, distracting that blubbering bitch�, C.M. slapping hands with Rocke both of sharing a delightful accomplishing smiling.

�Thanks, now then, since she lost. Lets enjoy ourselves��, C.M. peered downward over Isabel&#8217;s naturally bare being at Rocke's words.

�Uh? Are you nuts!�, Concer exclaimed.

�The old man and punk could be back any second, I&#8216;m not going to lose my seventy percent cause you got your rocks off�, Hokkin brought their original motivation back too light.

�Exactly!�, Cerburtnn agreed, while others nodded yet looked upon the women with lust.

�Firstly keep your voices down and seems there are more of us who want to get laid then securing our financial interest. Sot lets make a wager�, C.M. cleverly thought.

�We&#8216;re listening�, Zogh spoke up.

�Since I scoped the area from the tree branch above, I saw a single unlively house up ahead. Thus here&#8216;s the deal, we&#8216;re going to do as we wish with these two, that&#8217;s a fact. However, it depends if your going to partake or not, which you must decide here and now�, C.M. explained with a seriousness.

�Why would we do that?�, Concer asked annoyed.

�Cause, those who partake will gain thirty percent of,&nbsp; those who stay out, exchange rate after we reach the house before the bastard shows up, giving some needed relief�, C.M. decided.

�Ohhh and what do those of us get if he shows up before that?�, Rocke asked.

�Seventy percent will be deducted from our exchange rate instead, if he shows up before we make it to the house in the clearing�, C.M. smiled, getting a few nodders and others who frowned in without approval.

�Sounds alluring enough or what?�, Zogh chuckled along side C.M.

�Agreed, who&#8216;ll be staying out of this fucking fiasco?�, Hokkin brought up.

�Guess just us, one�two�three. The three of us will keep watch, while everyone else carries on�, Hokkin decided for the group, walking from the women. Rocke and Cerbustnn joining him with their guns raised high and not those natural lengths from below.

�C&#8216;mon Rocke, join us? We all have more then a itch to scratch with Syrere right?�, Concer plead, as he merely continued walking off.

�Yeah, not only did we win against her as a team, we should celebrate as a team�, C.M. added, shrugging his shoulders, shaking his earrings.

�Wonderful outlook C. M.�, Cerbustnn grinned towards him.

�Thanks Cerbustnn�, C.M. replied with just as cheerful an outlook, till he noticed Zogh already rustling the unconscious Syrere Witch.

�Zogh, hold on, we&#8216;re not even finished confirming whos going in or-�, C.M and Concer sympathized against the actions one of their players chose.

�Fig will be back any minute, lets get down too business�, Zogh reasoned, shutting their complains out.

�Besides that, these Witches are not going to allow the disappearance of their family going unnoticed for very long. Thus we could be putting out lives at risk, not just a percentage�, Zogh finished, picking Syrere up in his arms and walking away from the cloudily yet lit forest cleaning.

�Got a bold point there�, Concer mumbled in awe of Zogh&#8217;s actions while C.M. still tried convincing his other on guard comrades. Finally understanding, someone needed too keep watch anyhow, yet regardless.

�Rocke, Hokkin, Curbustnn, you three sure you'd rather not just��join?�, C.M. questioned once last time.

�We&#8216;re absolutely certain�, Hokkin answered coldly, while he, Curbustnn, and Rocke secured the area with passing trails.


_ Frolic _


Finding a suitable thick enough based tree, Zogh pulled the Witch, Syrere, into the shadows out of the sun yet near his crew&#8217;s protected circle none the less yet far enough away to not be overheard. A heavy thud, she was still quite unconscious. Motionless, limp, but to his graving pumped lust&nbsp; filled eyes, still beyond lusciously edible. He spread her legs afar, till they gave off a popping sound from the short skirted exposed panties less lipped middle, however not enough for a cracking pain too occur. Taking his time through gentle caressing her clothesless smooth groves. Till his fondlings explored her left exposed tiny foot of the mouth watering pair, fingering through every naturally filthy toe. Even ticking over that ankle, with a glance towards a whimpful mumbled movement of Syrere tilting that once seen face&#8217;s side against the tree&#8217;s bark.

Filtering his hands, effortlessly in a sweeping glaze over her foot&#8217;s scared roughed up bottom&#8217;s curves, she shifted again at his ticking touch. Giving his mind, a playfulness, holding her foot in the air before him. His other fingered palm reached and undid his buttoned pant&#8217;s top half, revealing an enlarged hung hardened male member. Which shot up and out while he kneeled down, grasping her foot gently down towards his flexing woodened delight. Upon the touch over her heel, that sensitive cock&#8217;s head merely sizeed when squished up against it. He himself, shocked with a tingling enriched spurted a dripping of his sperm between his enmeshed shaft&#8217;s head and her delicately filthy foot&#8217;s heel. Soon the exctiment spilled out, slowly overflowing from between their mingling flesh. Dripping down her foot onto this armored padded leg. Yet his flourishing eyes didn&#8217;t stay away from this marvelously profound woodland taboo beauty.

Sore at his jointed knees, which had been digging into the grassy dirt, he laid on his side in the middle between her spread thighs. Taking Syrere&#8217;s foot through a bending inward into his nostril&#8217;s playing field, sniffing the aroma of absolute wishful paradise. Souring every sense of conscious fear, others watching, nor even she waking, fell out from his mindful reality. The only thing that existed had been this darling of naturally crafted rarity and he. 

Caressing the left foot&#8217;s every toe from pinkie to bigie, with a tickle in between switching every numb flaring felt sight as she above whimpered with an unconscious obvious mutual appreciation. Zogh continued, imagining the craven each portion of her mind must be experiencing. Each gleeful mumble she expressed only heightened his gentle caressings. Even that sleepily dazzed face blushed with a red blushing, easily matching Zogh&#8217;s held creation. His lower member flourished with a unattended amount of pre orgasmic drippings into the dirt and flowing down his impatient pulsating solid horn.

Still carrying her foot, listening too her every moaning whisper. Zogh silently crawled up further and further till their popping lips began twinging in a burning lust. Her feet, hands, began overlapping he. As she kissed the air before him. �A natural whore, even when asleep, and there&#8217;s nothing to be shamed of�, before kissing her again, their tongues ravishing one another amongst those fluidly sickness both mouths now shared.

His male member mutually began a conquest of its own, against Syrere&#8217;s footed curvy rough sole. Smearing warm trails of white, while swishing across from one side to the other, with assistance from Zogh&#8217;s hand holding their desired delight. Thrusting into such irresistible naturally fit groves of her left bare limbed underside, overflowing that seed as his climax began to grow nearer and nearer in pressure from within. Even she wished for the same spilling pleasurable end, so much that her own fingers dug in between her ragged skirts inner self, petting those exposed lips below ferociously. Relapsing the last unsuccessful licking by Isabel&#8217;s second tingling adventure only moments ago. Resting his body gently against her own upon that background tree, watching intently.

Fittingly enough, Zogh shifted positions once again, letting the Witch tongue the air before his face. Kissing her cheek from time to time, soon such pressured lips on both lists of desire halted completely. As his hand wrapped her toed left foot around his nearly exploding thick shaft. Looking back, Zogh suddenly noticed something a bit thrilling of fright. Syrere&#8217;s right eye peeped opened in a curious looking at the scene he portrayed, then closed without truly giving anything away. However, he knew it finally, surely no whore was this urge fully intense and also beyond emotionally accurate amidst dreaming. Zogh snickered into her ear. Then purposely leaned into her body&#8217;s raggedly torn shirt covered left breast. Though alarming, his male member below spurted up into the air with he gritting his teeth at the foreseen imagery of the pretending Witch whore wanting this forced fantasy brought into reality, instantly the white seed sprayed upwards and landed all over her legs as with his own.

As Zogh&#8217;s size shivered slowly back into a thick knob of its previous matured horn. His lips spoke into Syrere&#8217;s ear, a unsteady heart racing with fear towards the mystery reaction when she actually learns about his awareness about this false sleep routine. Just the thought, regardless, grew that poking horn too dig into her leg&#8216;s thigh. Which caused an uncontrollable flinch, a few sweating droplets found themselves maneuvering down that dirty face of hers second later. Which he only dwelled in hover, closer and closer towards such a embarrassing fluttered blush red face. Smiling in cheer at her perfected yet resilient attempt to stay in character, burning with a desire through each warm drip of his seed. Intermixing with the first spilling, which greatly gave off a squishing sounded lubricating slickness when he gently lowered her left foot down his shaft. Then bringing it up, so tenderly to its reaming top, pushing that natural slippery whiteness up between their flesh till spilling up, out, and over. Flowing all around her foot&#8217;s every curve, groove, spreading the warmth as it finally reached the grassy dirt that their lower halves laid upon. As she hastily mimicked, in rubbing her own slippery lower lipped thighs. Letting each moan of their adventure surface.

�Syrere, was it?�, he silently exhaled.

�Let me ask you something serious��how long have you been awake?�

��.since my head bumped the damn tree behind me�.�, she whispered calmly.

�Would you rather be sleeping?�

��no�.�

�Call me Zogh, sweety�

�I rather be awake, Zogh�

�Why? Explain this perversion in every�defined�.detail�

�I need this��to be widened, thrusted into without end, opened into a loose channel once more, filled with the only seed I should carry��

�Is that the reason, you brought such a girl out here? Pleasure?�

�No, no��

�Ummm, yes�, Syrere corrected herself.

�Secrets?�

�Yes, just-�, Syrere began shouting in defiance, till his hand over wrapped her mouth.

�Silent that howler and moan for me�, he demanded into her eyes.

�There&#8217;s one small condition, partaking in this fulfillment of yours�

�Hm?�

�You&#8216;ll have to become mine, my sole lover�, suddenly Syrere&#8217;s eyes blew wide open and her mouth unseemly gapped open.

�Close your eyes, this isn&#8216;t part of our little playtime�, both of her eye lids closed yet both ears listened intently.

�We both know the power within these secret clans of Witches, far exceeds humanity&#8217;s grasp in general, no matter the gender who holds it. This plant happens to be the key, which I know is correct. Right?�

�Yehs�

�Then you agree?�

�Huhm, I&#8216;ll�bre yogur�wiufe�

�That&#8217;s why I tagged along, its first time, don&#8216;t go dying on me through, Syrere. I know you&#8217;re the only one who can bring me back�

�Yuop�

�Adorable, that expression of alarming surprise�, Zogh snickered.

�I won&#8216;t hurt you�just tell me what you desire most�

�Do whatever feels right, Zogh. After which, I might consider bringing you back, once everything&#8217;s taken care of-�, his hand&#8217;s grasp unexpectedly tightened over her jaw.

�When I ask my woman something, she better express herself fully�

�Try again, Syrere sweety�, leaning his ear to her unhanded mouth&#8216;s lips.

�Go fuck yourself�, she whispered, before biting hold of his ear lobe softly. Ensuring no blood came through the indenting teeth marks, yet suckling slightly through her lips. Playing with adoring moans still passing through those reality lust over thrown eyes.

�A fist it&#8216;ll be then�, Zogh rose his three fingers into the air above her conjoined thighs.

�Huh!�, is all should could conclude, before one hand covered that mouth and the other plunged itself fully into her lower wet lipped womanhood.

�Mmmmmmghghgghghhgh!!!!!! Rugh!!!!!�, she muffled, grabbing hold of Zogh tightly, including gripping hold of his length by her wrapped foot.

�Careful with that foot of yours, squeeze any harder and I might�.pop again�

�You we&#8216;re much tighter then your looked, though, only three fingers were enough to cause discomfort?�

&#8216;Only three? Really?&#8217;, Syrere thought within, feeling a bit embarrassed, �We&#8216;ll have too��provide maintenance before our pre honeymoon�, yet at such words, both of their minds flooded back into that alluring blinding lust.


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Lets take a step back, too when Concer and C.M. strip their armor off on the separate path. Ripping the clothes from their second captive unconsciously sleeping Witch, Isabel. 

�C.M.?�

�Whats on your mind Concer?�

�Fetish?�

�Uh? Thats means what exactly?�

�Considering we&#8216;re sharing the last of the two Witches, I&#8216;d rather know where your starting first�

�Sharing? Don&#8216;t think so�

�Greedy comes to mind, besides, Zogh is taking his Witch away. So its only leaves, Isabel, hmmm�

�Whoa! Why does he get to hide out of sight, all alone, with a prize�

�Sure, go on after him, he&#8216;s probably planning to strangle the life out of her. After he&#8216;s finished�with hearing those muffled rhythmic screams�

�And I should be sharing with you because.. try again, its not clicking yet�

�If Zogh kills the bitch, we&#8216;re down a reward. It&#8216;ll be coming out from his exchange rate to the rest of us. Being involved, you&#8216;ll lose the same percentage. Even if you left early, being completely innocent when it comes too any harmful acts that took her life later�

�Bull-shit�

�Its in our contracts, experienced goers like me, got screwed many times over. So trust me�

�They say, honor among thieves doesn&#8216;t exist�

�Yet humility does, at least we&#8216;re our lives outside this profession are concerned. Ensuring a comrade doesn&#8216;t lose his share and thus apartment, putting his parents out into the street all due too a lack of intellect. Well, take what you want from that advice, but keep an open mind�

�Thanks, I guess�

�Soo�.�

�A plump ripe ass, basically anal, though the tearful stuffing expressions are desired more�

�And you�.�

�Hahaha! Fucking hilarious, yet you should also be given a laugh�

�My particular urge happens to find itself spilling over heels for lengthy silk felt hair�

�Huh? Lost me there Concer�

�Never known a person with a desire for a ass touching hung river of hair?�

�Nope, fucking bizarre�, C.M. chuckled.

�See you got your laugh as well, ummm�..by the way�

�Are you a bisexual?�, Concer asked curiously as they removed their upper padded armor and shirts, showing off their bare naturally sculpted muscle builds.

�No, are you?�

�Umm, only when the moods just right�

�Don&#8216;t be getting any ideas!�

�You stay at her head and I&#8216;ll remain in her behind�

�Considering you&#8217;re the one with a taste for ass, I should be a bit more wary�

�Same goes for that desire of this poor girl too cry and scream from the untouched body splitting agony�

�Shut up and lets dwell into pleasure. You&#8216;ve spoken enough-�

�Quiet, lets just get it on�, Concer stated right after C.M..

�Rgggrhhhh�, C.M. gritting in his teeth at the mockery Concer exclaimed as their reached their destinations upon Isabel.

Concer found himself situating her head upon a nearby log, wrapping every hip length head bound&nbsp; feathery hair strand was left untouched, except by he. Curled around his right forearm, she merely remained motionless aside fom C.M.&#8217;s interfering meddling upon her skirt less ass cheeks. Though Concer continued with gentle haste. Soon crouching down, leaning upon the log, his own limp statured erection fondled between his fingers, her feathers gracefully curled around his arm securely we&#8217;re unwrapped. Instead finding themselves flung into a on coming breeze that managed from the house laid clearing several feet away. Drifting down through the natural windfall force around thee, landing themselves over his outwardly extended hipped dripping down manhood. Finding themselves, gravating around its thickened elevating excitement that Concer shared, twitching it into a solidly blood filled towering length. Which he still felt envious of this Witch&#8217;s gift, not matter his achievement. He&#8217;ll never be satisfied no matter his own hair future reaches nor his attentive flesh thick thigh held mini bat. Draped in those feather felt overwhelmingly elegant stranded beauty&#8216;s. His control over a fulfilling spill into such youthful blessings sent blushing shocking cheerful chills throughout he.

C.M. on the other end, couldn&#8217;t keep his erected self at a standing. The other crew members wouldn&#8217;t keep silent nor stationary. Running every attempt, so, he took such frustrations through nail clenching grasps into her asses soft smoothed cheeks. Each now baring the bleeding slits where his hands once we&#8217;re. He desired to begin punching both tightly fit blood dropped sacks she wore behind that unshaved cunt in front. However, keenly, his limp self came too surface once again, drifting, sitting, mimicking C.M. own position. Just sitting, frustrated, though the odor of her kept backside. Calmed his soul from within, each sniffing whiff found him peace which he would regretfully lose again without end.

Looking up, for glances, seeing Concer basking in the closed eye pleasure they both sought. Just fueled his exploding anger, soon he kneeled into the rocky uncomfortable dirt. Spreading her legs around his waist, situating her ass high enough. C.M. decided to become determined in getting his urge satisfied, no matter the cost. Taking that limp unsurely excited yet distracted meat between both hands. He began to stoke, slowly, eyeing her buttocks edged up towards his face from her now belly laying leg kneeled positioned self.

Eventually, his mind began too slip reality all together as the pulsating beat filled that two handed held wooden plank. All that took for he, was imagining the acts he&#8217;d be doing soon enough. Her despair, tears, and expressed cryful attempts too escape, not only the reoccurring rising climaxing pleasure yet the unbiased ass splitting thrusts of pain. Soon as his sensitive hardened lower self leapt and stayed in place, C.M. allowed it a swinging celebrating dance into the air around them. As his palms found themselves gripping her two tightly formed smaller cheeks, smooching them together. Backing his hips up, he slipped the length between the profoundly forced clenched paired buttocks. Gracefully feeling her devine overlooked desire of his from months passed. The pressured squeezing causing a separation between the two at its centered burning hot holed base, immediately he began too drip his seed as he slowly reached through the marveled appetizer above a over passed unattended roasted main small dish. That tiny hole, merely asking to be slickly opened, roughly stretched, entered without end while waiting for a warm tip of his own to be deposited.

Though regardless, C.M. Didn&#8217;t quit, desiring the need for a warm lubricant, using her ass cheeks as cushioning pillows to his rising finish. Closing both eyes, focusing on the slippery vigorous stroking amongst the imagery of her mumbling breathless shouts from pure tortuous widening by he and he alone. Concer, sitting besides the silent sleeping drooling doll that she should have been, trying too ignore C.M.&#8217;s crude rash movements of captioning the perfect glance over the Witch&#8217;s face. Still carrying her strands loosely wrapped around his thickened lower self, he took both hands. Grasping certain portions of fluent flowing hair from that sweet snoozing innocently expressed faced head. And he began too pull, bit by bit, tightening the pressured hair from loose laces into ripping cords. Tighter and tighter, till his pulsating exploded through his moaning lips into air. Following a streaming flowing strand of white, painting not only her hair yet dripping its way onto that pretty face&#8217;s nose, as she flinched, twitched, and began too blink steadily. Yet, unnoticed by either, Concer lavished blindly in his pleasure entangled in her hair, while C.M. reached his own grunting splattering desired climax. 

She merely decided too wait, take her surroundings in before making a move. Though keeping motionless began a slight problem, for C.M. kept her kneeling ass high against his being while that hardened plank blew out its own stringy clinging droplets of stickiness. However, before doing so, he routed it downwards over and between both cheeks onto that tiny asshole of hers. Enjoying the swarming delightful sensational goodness, while dripping his warmth into her own hot dish. Giving that extra topping, personal needed choice in his case, dapping a finger the crack formed narrow puddle of his blown white seed. Twirling into the warm goo, little by little, providing that pressure of digging into her backside&#8217;s inner sealed untouched canal. At which point, while both dazed, unknowing to any others near. Isabel, the Witch, feeling her ass being violated entered bringing along an annoying dose of pain, she began screaming for her life.

Everyone&#8217;s eyes turned upon the screaming Witch under C.M.&#8217;s and Concer&#8217;s control, though surprised and shocked. That howling pain shirking screech, found itself silenced in moments of its breech into reality. Concer, prepared as usual, shoved his dart gun&#8217;s nuzzle into her mouth, till it touched her throats backend. She nearly vomited from the suddenly unexpected unpleasantness, merely held down by he and her hair tugged. Till she now met face to face with C.M. behind her, with his finger, nail deep within. A smile appeared over C.M. while she shuttered in fear of his intentional gleaming sinister pervertions burning from within those eyes of he. While helpless, Isabel, only watched as those horrors unfolded upon her being as with every sensational despair along with it as she utterly feared.

Taking that finger dug in already, C.M., never took his eyes out of the gaze the Witch and he shared. His lower manhood found itself already erected back into its fully hardened strength. All the while, he plunged that slightly sticky seeded finger all the way in, with all this muscle he could muster. Till his right hand&#8217;s knuckle literally punched into her ass itself. She winched in a clenching eye tearing closed teeth gritting over the gun, while muttering a screaming screech that only became a mere mumbling whisper. Though the pressure of forcing her wide open didn&#8217;t stop there, he carelessly pulled out quickly and rammed again and again. Every five cheerful diggings, opening the entrance with all his fingers, allowing the white ooze too slip down into her ass inner canal. Watching that frightful youthful featured face of Isabel&#8217;s weep at his advances. Though surely his hardened self dug its own appreciation, causing another destination of discomfort, at her thigh&#8216;s backside facing C.M..

Shortly, C.M. punctured her hairy lower lips which he felt his own wood between during the delightful digging tale. Naturally, being only slightly aroused, merely from the fearful blood rush she wasn&#8217;t prepared to take his length into her font lipped middle thigh held underside. Delivering unmentionable amounts of agony, coursing through the Witch&#8217;s every speck of awareness over any other sensational thought and feeling alike. Both C.M.&#8217;s finger and wooden plank found itself engrossed themselves, taking turns in penetrating Isabel completely without end. Concer, watched, sickened, yet held the girl down regardless.

Before spilling his seed for the second time, C.M. hearing her cunt&#8217;s releasing juices giving off that squishing melody nearing his own climax. He maneuvered his manhood between her ass cheeks once more, smothering it with her sacky fleshy back ended tight lumps, while grooving it into the creamy seed of his previous split climax. Goes without saying, both of they, stared into one another still. Her expression collapsed with endless pain wrenched fear as his own clapped at the uplifting spell she&#8217;ll mutter once again. At its height, for the audience of this last meal with him. That they&#8217;ll enjoy together, for he&#8216;ll make it so. 

Flexing his dripping cock of fresh streaming droplet seeds as with the Witch&#8217;s ass held whiteness he bared upon that innocent appearing flesh only moments before. Using his right hand&#8217;s palm as guidance, he nibbled at her resisting using his lower self&#8217;s hardened burning hot cum drenched stature mushroom rounded tip. Resting drippingly, without warning, plunging depth with all his thrusting strength in one bruising muffled scream scattering forwarding downward anal canalled venture. Her legs drug into backside in defiance, thrilling him even further. Turning his eyed delight into the ass which he fought her clenching squeezes before climaxing once more deep within her. Yet looking up however, that face couldn&#8217;t be seen any more as a white splattered seedy amassed hair had been put into the way. Concer, didn&#8217;t dare met C.M. frustrated woozy gaze, so he just stood up. Pulling out and walking around the sniffling Witch to Concer talking sweetly down to her.

Tapping Concer&#8217;s bare shoulder, C.M. found a fist knocking him head first into the rotten log where Concer and Isabel remained motionless. C.M. surprised, knowing all too wll his amusement was ruined intentionally, that his own painful detests now endlessly emitted from his knee cap and huffing face. He rose once more fist first, landing into Concer&#8217;s watching dodging being, merely hitting his shoulder. Soon their crew members rushed over, assisting in breaking up of the sprawl that popped up. Though mainly C.M. contained while Concer remained out of the fight besides defending himself. In fact, laughing had been his most obscure weapon betrayed. Sending C.M. into another fit when all seemed settled. As they both rolled upon the drity grass, their team members once again rushed into, intervening.

All the while, Isabel, crawled away, every movement caused a souring amount of headache based snorness in her jointed body. Searching the ground completely unnoticed by any other, while their distraction waged interruptible. Till coming near a stump, a few feet from her log held violation, next to it laid a small colorful wide topped mushroom. Learning into the ground, bowing to it, Isabel spoke into cupped hands. ��..warn the other sisters, our foreseen intruders have arrived��, after which she contained forward in her brisk sore stated escape attempt as she noticed someone approaching from the woods carrying a woman in his arms. 


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Returning too Zogh and Syrere, as if we never left them�..

Zogh, attempting too unsuccessfully retrieve his fingers from Syrere&#8217;s frontal thigh centered lips, went slowly. She not only hummed eye closed rhythms of echoing unrestrained open mouthed delight, purposely focusing on very muscle within her lower hipped set of lips we&#8217;re squeezing every bit of harbored strength they had. While he found himself thrusting with her filthy cum splattered cruelled wrapping foot stationarily pumping his cock&#8217;s loose fleshy self into a higher and higher glimpsing mind set towards another climax. In this case, they hoped a mutually shared explosion could be found between their mingling intimately bound heart pounding beings.

Nettling into each other&#8217;s tender tightening grasps as they hold onto the tree unconsciously at the shaking storm of tasty urgeful fulfillment drowning them out. Each heightening their proximity towards a drowning within a smothered exhausted messy satisfied state. Which they reached unfound potential lurking in the shadows of themselves, mainly brought about from his thrusted three bound fingers were shoving themselves through her helplessly spasmed inner slippery lipped canal. Allowing the burst of a gushing amount of warmth white over his hands and flow down her ass. As for his own, the sudden sight of a messy moaning Witch of his own. Drove his loaded amounts of stickiness too overflow from his manhood over that wrapping shaking foot. Syrere huffed, while Zogh puffed, in dazzling pleasure, soon their body&#8217;s found themselves laced amongst once another into the ground which held their exploded messes. Unwrapping his lowering cock, unplugging her cunt, they liad together enmeshing the warmth and mindful splendors which had been held within such mutual purity.

A restful silence rained down in the shadows upon the these two upon that witnessing tree, till the birds chirped, wind&#8217;s howling heard, till a rustle of his crew interrupted yet went unnoted. �Think your ready?�, Zogh whispered in her ear.

����.�, her gaze tensed into the ground, she was lost in thought.

He merely took a hand, turning her face into his with a startling surprise. Witnessing nothing in both of her suddenly purely dark hollow eyes. As they returned too normal through a sudden blinking, she shook herself away and out of his grasp. Yet continued to lay within such tender warmth of his, both of them startled, their hearts shaken. Syrere felt horrible, �Sorry Zogh�, she meekly stated, unable to meet his troubled unsettled gaze.

�Do I have to turn your eyes into mine again?�, 

�No! I mean, ummm�no�.. My sisters will be arriving soon, at any moment in fact�, 

�Ahhhh, we&#8216;re all going too die? I suspect, any intruder, especially a man will be killed regardless?�

�Once again, your right, however�� your beginning too scare me a bit Zogh. How do you-�, yet her thought was silenced when he picked her up and began walking back towards the forest clearing.

�Lets get moving then, no time too waste�

�Hold on!�

�Just shut up sweety, we&#8216;ll be sharing out pre honey moon soon enough�

��I can&#8216;t stand the sight, what if you die while we��

�Then hide my body somewhere safe till your able�to�.do your magic�

�Zogh, please, it won&#8216;t wo-�

�Pretend to be asleep, c&#8216;mon, they&#8216;ll do less hovering over us that way�

�Be careful, I&#8216;ll try and stall&#8216;em�for my own sake�, Syrere whispered as they reentered the forest clearing where everyone was quite startled to see both of them appear.

�That&#8217;s one&#8216;s escaping, c&#8216;mon are you people blind?�, Zogh used his gaze to show the escaping Isabel, Concer and Rocke retrievd the Witch.

�Give me some room, go stand over there or something�, Zogh asked, and his comrades backed away from the log. Soon he placed her gently upon the ground before the rotten large stripe of wood we&#8217;re another trail a few feet away stained the ground.

�Start opening yourself up, Syrere�, Zogh whispered, getting himself and her positioning for their honeymoon. As her left hand found itself rubbing her thigh sensitive lipped nose above and those gleaning lips vigorously. 


_ S.O.S. _

*NOTE: Change Concer, too Zogh! When dealing with Witch Syrere*
*NOTE: Add in Zogh&#8216;s scene with Syrere, that she was BEYOND tight and sqeezzing!*
*NOTE: Add, Syrere, yells Zogh&#8216;s name when he gets hit and slowly passes out. Also add she&#8216;s horrorified at the sight of him dying not smiling sinisterly*
*NOTE: When Isabel confronts C.M. she enjoys with a tear killing him*


Holding both of Syrere&#8217;s legs around his neck, he pursued thrusting into her eye closed, teeth gritting, expressed pleasured contradicting back laying squeezingly tight lower lipped self. Feeling the dirt, grass, twigs, and rocks blur themselves into her naked clothes scary torn backside. Yet deluded from the discomfort of the forced sensationally desired act, Syrere crosses her legs over his neck almost uncontrollably as the pressure rises from disgust into delight once again. Her effort in holding back each vented moan for more couldn&#8217;t be halted as Zogh&#8217;s thrusts became mutually addicted in a up hilled spurting lust. His hands each found themselves caressing in tightly over her right shoulder while the other wrapped around that splendidly enticing fit hip.

Feeling the tensed hold over his neck without the intent of harm his eyes marveled at her flustered whorish being, submitting to the curling pleasure imbued, Grasping the dirty grass around them, while following each other&#8217;s movements in every delicately roughening returned thrusting bump. That sloppy slippery mixture of juices found themselves mimicking the chirping of nature and footsteps of the birds watching from above as Zogh&#8217;s crew patrolled cautiously. Only allowing their untied between their legs too further while he kneeled into her widened loose opening, greeting with generous courtesy as the world around them dissipates till they are left alone. Lost, while waving in a drive into drowning lust. Zogh and Syrere we&#8217;re nor enemies nor wished for a violent revenge due to another past memorably despair. Yet they found themselves locked into purity, bare, firmly gentle, eventually reaching the top.

Freedom, found, she more adventurously began thrusting to the point where his we&#8217;re no longer relevant to be found occurring. Bringing their climax at the top, further and further into reality to be shared. Needless to say, all shame at her eye closed moaning mouthed being screaming before finding itself stuffed with his fingers, instead forming into a high pitched vibrating twitch of an orgasm which set himself off without a few seconds spared. Together their spill toppled out from their calm dripping carven into the dirt which their bodies conjointly began settling amidst embracing the quenching sought satisfaction.

As her legs limped, while his kneels burned, he backed away to rise. Hearing a sudden disturbance, looking up into the sky, a dose of immense agony split into his soul. Dropping too both knees as if nothing occurred before, gasp alerting searches found from his surrounding crew and Isabel unsettling shouting screams. A long pole found itself extendingly sitting upon his bare chest. Both of his hands grasped, unfelt, his speed of the world slowed. Upon tugging, a spinal sharp pain caused an unwanted bloodly mass to spill from his mouth in a hurling discomfort, the red stream down his bare chest going unfelt allowed a realization. A spear has ended his life, as the colors of light faded into blurriness, Syrere&#8217;s motions we&#8217;re eye tearing sadness, he fell forward atop upon her from a simple grasp. While standing up, holding his body as a shield toward Zogh&#8217;s comrades, who trained their dart guns without a shot in sight. Before C. M. could use Isabel as a hostage in halting the Witch&#8217;s horrid actions, they soon found themselves overrun with high pitched screeches.

Roche, found a very long haired bare woman falling onto him. Stabbing a knife into his stomach, while C.M. tried helping, he had one playing with his mind in delusional impossiblies. His aim, vision, waved out of his control, they were unreal. He was pointing to the sky shifting in doubt as the screeches continued. Hokkin tried shooting a few darts of his own, missing every time. Before his own obstacle occurred, a woman's tal self and hands, pointing the gun up into his mouth. Concer, laying shiftless, looked for his dart gun which disappeared from both sight and mind, till it was pointed down upon his skull by one of those very same Witches. As for the last, Cerburtnn, found a women undressing him upon his front buttoned armor, smiling, after a second felt dazing pain at his neck&#8217;s backside.

Three others waived in the background, one in particular, Hokkin noticed while in his struggle, sat upon a high tree branch holding a bow and arrow. As the woman&#8217;s fingers, who screeched with dark hollow eyes withholding their intent, pulled the gun&#8217;s trigger which still held its nuzzle against his mouth&#8217;s upper portion. A split second, later, it thudded against his forehead, bouncing up into the air. Not before leaving a horrid bleeding red bump behind. Through remaining hope, he continued in the struggle, pushing the gun backwards towards the noise emitting bitch who stood taller then he. Soon a arrow found itself colliding toward he and her. Thus a quick forward step and the metal sharpened end punctured her backside, soon it&#8217;s screeches ended abruptly, being filled with a weak loosened gap of time. Hokkins took this advantage, aiming the gun in their mutual grasps toward her head. However, she moved in an instant, dodging the missed projectile that later nearly hit C. M. as he danced by himself shooting into the sky. As his own captor walked steadily closer and closer. Concer, was hit in the shoulder by an arrow from a Witch archer, everyone else. Including Isabel and Syrere we&#8217;re hiding amongst the messy situation. Hokkins finally decided, money wasn&#8217;t worth their lives.

Rocke, still rolling into the dirty rock filled grass his gun dropped else where, he reached his belted knife. Once a securely blind grasp had been reached, he flung his reach into a swipe upwards at the woman&#8217;s neck. Missing, by only a graze over her skin, while their other set of fingered hands we&#8217;re occupied holding one another in a fierce exhausting power struggle. Her already blood dripping slicer, decided to twirl, allowing his own agony filled yells to match her exhaling screeches. Their eyes met again, yet her hollowness dark filled entrenched sockets couldn&#8217;t be read. Giving Rocke an even more fearful despair as he fell weaker to her assaults, the blood and pain overwhelmed him certainly at this point. Yet before dropping that mid aired held knife from the oncoming blurry shadowed death approaching. He thrusted downwards, gutting a gurgling pale of blood spilling out onto him from above as he slashed her again. Before the woman&#8217;s hands held the wound which spelled death, as he rose up, light headed. She merely fell onto the ground, slowing in her movements. Rocke watched intently, before stomping her skull, till finally hearing splitting crunch.

While turning around, another woman about to succeed in taking Concer&#8217;s life, he soured slowly to help. As his shadow found itself ruling over them, a sharp heaving force knocked him into the dirt. His hands reached up to its origin at his neck, finding a long spear managed in sealing his helpless fate after all.

Cerbustnn, unable too move, watches everyone&#8217;s plights and deaths alike, trembling in fear. At the hollow eyed Witch before him as she smiled with short screeches which didn&#8217;t cause discomfort yet invoked alluring soothing sleep. Falling unconscious, both of his eyes shut completely as her lips met his own. Then surprisingly, with a headache reached, she disappeared. His ability to move had been found once again, grabbing his armor. While closest to the eyeless Concer, who laid in his own blood. The women atop, pressed on with her sinister sliced scratching through his already bloodstained bleeding flesh, while both his hands we&#8217;re dissected from the bone within, only allowing a mere flinching. His pain couldn&#8217;t be spoken of, as his tongue had disappeared as well.

Dodging a on coming arrow, Cerbustnn moved towards the Witch upon Concer. Bashing her head in within a spinning kick, silencing that annoying glee filled screech. Continuing with several swift heavy fisted punches, still she bled out, motionless with a twinge onto the ground nearby. Once he became aware of Rocke&#8217;s corpse. Another Witch appeared before them, hovering, inches off the ground. Grinning without a single sound, before finally vomiting a spray over both Concer who laid in motionless screaming agony and Cerbustenn himself. Though blocking with his armor, luckily still in hand, he managed in an escape from death again. Sadly, Concer mumbled through steaming melted pools of what once had been his body which the bones gave reminder. As he faced the bitch once again, harboring a leap in his step. Before a gunshot, not a small zimmering dart, yet that of metal exploding forward into the air. Along side the Witch&#8217;s brains from who at one point, bothered Hokkin near death.

The floating Witch drifting with a howling screech, till Hokkins pointed his pistol directly between their connected eye sights. Pulling the trigger, twice, sending the naked bare monster silent as a mist of blood had formed out the backend of her skull. As that sinister missing eyed flinching copse died off. Hokkin continued eyeing up the battle field, dodging another annoying arrow. While another, without warning, dug deep into his padded armor, sending him startling backwards. He aimed, at the only visible women in the trees did just the same toward he. Both fired as Cerburtnn ran through, under the line of sight, toward C.M.&#8217;s missing position.

The women fell from the tree, face first into a stump down below, her arrow, aimed towards Hokkin's head. Hit, slicing into his left cheek before skipping off elsewhere, with a blood drenched grazing. For a second there he thought his life had ended. Two more women appeared from above, bringing him back into reality as they mutually lowered from the high above trees, yet not screeching as the others. Hokkin merely took aim, with a bounce in every booted step.

C.M. awoke into consciousness, the woman&#8217;s kneeling bodied mouth over the barrel&#8217;s gun, his hands and armored body, splattered in a massive amount of blood. Trembling in utter fear, lost deep in the woods he heard gun shots, back in the lighter cleaning. Soon he checked himself, thoroughly, then again, again, again, and again. Still trembling, fearful, crying, at the woman before him for an unknown reason. He wasn&#8217;t the one who bled but she, yet why, why! He asked himself in pure utter fright, looking down. Bones, upon bones, upon rotting bodies. Now he knew, why his senses stated to run, run, run at the moment of consciousness. Closing his eyes, slowing every breath, even as the gun shots continued. He turned around, walking with a steady beat, still shaken. Feeling a shiver in his being, this place, was death itself. They shouldn&#8217;t of come. Something worse then death, why oh why, would she have him kill her under her own control. Its fucking insane!

�Excuse me?�, a unknown, unheard high pitched voice spoke aloud down his chosen walking path.

�Ye�ye�yes?�, he answered shakeningly, about to run away with a step backwards.

�Are you alright?�, she asked politely, he kept his eyes shut, not wanting to disturb the Iron Moth&#8217;s messenger. He must have been dead, there was no mistaking it.

�Why..why are�who?�, C. M. asked a feeling a bit more comfort in short, realizing this was the new beginning into dreams.

�I&#8217;m the angel to set you free�, the sudden clicking metal of a handgun, assumingly a pistol sounded in front of his face. Causing his eyes to sprout open, in which he saw hell while still stuck in reality. A woman stood lower then he, holding a pistol&#8217;s nuzzle inches from his noise, carrying a deathly hollow pair of eyes amidst a dreadful expression.

Cerbustnn, searching found no trace of C. M.. In fact his own belted gun, had been lost. Watching Hokkins, who made him feel irreverently useless. Taking these women down almost instantly, their dodging must of slowed or something. Usually, even a shotgun blast, wide and spread couldn&#8217;t hit&#8217;em from a foot away. No, Hokkin&#8217;s must of found out how to manipulate their patterned movement, shooting where their going instead of where their presently. Once again, Cerbustnn found himself feeling helpful as shit. A gun blast fired behind he, he turned to find C. M. falling into his arms and a narrowed hole at his skulls dripping blood pouring backside. Surprised, both of them fell into the dirt. Hokkin, directed his attention away from the dead mass of corpses in the clearing. Walking towards Cerbustnn, C. M.s dead self, and a handgun welding young Witch. Also known as Isabel, who held a pair of hallow black eyes.

�Stay back, you fucking slaughtering pigs!�, Isabel stated, as every step furthered herself into the dense woods which those Gathering Hunters used too reach their homeland.

�You&#8216;ll die, Isabel�, Hokkin advised at the gun wielding Witch before his own iron sights.

�We still have two members coming this way, as it suits you and your murdering unfaithful clan�

�Don&#8216;t get self righteous, wicked man. Hokkins, isn&#8217;t?�, Hokkin didn&#8217;t budge, only remained stone cold too Isabel&#8217;s words.

�Your mistaken, miss, I must admit. The only reason I haven&#8216;t fired, happens to be your reassembly to my own daughter. If you promise not to shoot Witch, nor will we. But I-�

�SHUT IT! One more fucking word and I&#8216;ll�.I&#8216;ll��, Isabel expression and movements became radical trashed by emotion.

�Elder Sister has already been slaughtered, so its all over now. I will kill you both one day, till then don&#8216;t be dying before my vengeance, men. You two make me sick, not a tear shed for your brothers. At least us sisters know�know how TOO FEEL!�, Isabel spoke, nearing heself towards the forest direction where the slave hunters originally came from.

�Theres a time and a place for sorrow and self hate, on the battle field it&#8217;ll only gets one killed�, Hokkin advised.

�Hokkins, Hokkins Bohiobo, lets meet again real soon�, which finally shook Hokkin&#8217;s cold stone steel off as if snow. He saw her run off into the forest, lowing his weapon in hand, wide eyed in surprise.

�How did she know your full name?�, Cerbustnn asked, a few feet away.

�What part of the definition, &#8216;Witch&#8217;, don&#8216;t you comprehend�, he answered his comrade.

�Sorry sir, I� I�.�

�Hey! Cerbustnn! Get yourself together, grab a gun, get ready, there could be more�

�We&#8216;re not heading after her?�, Cerbustnn exclaimed alarmed.

�Nope, heading towards the house, its where Fig and Covy are going. Since we shot the reward too literal pieces we might as well see if our employers are good enough to match wits again their enemy�

�Staying out here, all alone soldier?�, Hokkin brought up, seeing himself furthering from Cerbustnn in the forest clearing.

�No, no, no sir. I&#8216;m c&#8216;mon, wait up!�

����to be continued��.
