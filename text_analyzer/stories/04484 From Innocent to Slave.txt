Karla groaned loudly in agony.� Her head was throbbing and she couldn�t
remember how she got here, wherever �here� was.�
She opened her eyes.� Blackness.� Nothingness.

&nbsp;

�Where am I?� She thought.�
Struggling to sit up, she felt her surroundings; she was in a small room
that seemed to be made of metal.� She
tried to stand up but found that the ceiling was just low enough so she
couldn�t stand up straight.� The only
distinguishing feature of the room was the small hole in the floor.� Karla knew immediately what that was for and
suddenly got very frightened.� She sat
down and tried her hardest to remember�

�

Her pounding headache was not helpful.� Karla swore loudly and then began to cry
softly.� What had started as a normal day
had turned into something from her worst nightmares.� Her memory of the day started to come back in
pieces.� She had errands to run.� Typical ones, nothing out of the ordinary �
the bank, the grocery store, a stop at the post office, and then off to a
coffee shop to study.� A
regular Saturday afternoon.� 

&nbsp;

Karla could not remember if she had made it to study.� The weather was so nice that she thought she
should walk to the coffee shop.� Along
the way, she started to window shop.� One
clothing store had a display in the window she could not resist; a cute summer
outfit was calling to her, a modest skirt and a bright colored strapless
top.� She couldn�t resist walking in and
trying it on.� This is where things got really
fuzzy, Karla�s head started to throb. 

&nbsp;

�She had been in the
changing room, or was it at the clothing rack.�
There was the nice salesman, who was probably a few years older than she
was.� He offered to set her up with a
changing room.� Karla thought she
remembered going into the changing room and trying on the outfit, but couldn�t
quite picture it.� Karla reached down in
the darkness and felt her clothing.� Yes,
she seemed to be in the outfit she had tried on, she had started the day in
jeans and this was definitely a skirt.�
But what had happened?� 

&nbsp;

She was in the changing room admiring herself
in the mirror.� The door burst open and
the salesman was there.� �Is everything
to your satisfaction?� he had asked as he grabbed her and put something over
her nose and mouth.� And now she was
here, in this cramped dark room.� She couldn�t
even figure out where the door was.�
Karla was scared. 

&nbsp;

Now panic and claustrophobia were setting in.� Karla started pounding on the walls and
screaming.� She wasn�t sure how long she
was at this, but she stopped when her voice was completely gone and her hands
were raw and bleeding.� There was no
response; there wasn�t even a sound.�
Putting herself in the fetal position in a corner, Karla started to sob
and rock herself.� She thought she would
probably die here.

&nbsp;

Without realizing it, Karla fell into a fitful sleep.� It was only a loud clang that woke her
up.� With a start, she opened her eyes,
but it was still pitch black.� She felt around
her �cell� and found a bowl of some sort of porridge and some water.� She drank the water and tried the porridge,
but put it down in disgust.

&nbsp;

�EAT IT!�� Came a voice so overwhelmingly loud that Karla screamed.

&nbsp;

�EAT or suffer consequences.�� Karla was still frozen.

&nbsp;

Suddenly a tingling sensation rushed through Karla�s
body.� She yelped in surprise and froze.

&nbsp;

�It WILL get worse.� MUCH worse.� EAT!�

&nbsp;

Karla picked up the bowl and took a tentative sip.� She gagged. 

&nbsp;

Another tingle, but this time worse and Karla felt her
muscles contract.

&nbsp;

�Do NOT hesitate.� It
will do what it is asked to do or suffer the consequences.�

&nbsp;

�Are you talking to me?��
Karla asked defiantly.� A strong
shock was the answer.� Karla
involuntarily convulsed on the floor.�
She had felt nothing like this before and it scared her.


Her heart pounding, Karla took the bowl and started to eat, ignoring the urge
to gag.

&nbsp;

�Very good, next time you will know to be
thankful for what you are given.��
Said the voice.

&nbsp;

Karla screamed, �What do you want with me?� Who are you?�

&nbsp;

She was met with silence.�
Karla huddled in the corner after relieving herself in the hole in the
floor.� She felt ashamed, but she wasn�t
sure why. 

&nbsp;

Several hours later, Karla began to learn that her life was
to change forever in ways she couldn�t possibly imagine.

&nbsp;

Whether it had been hours, days, or weeks since she had been placed in
this small and lightless cell, Karla would never know

Whether it had been hours, days, or weeks since she had been
placed in this small and lightless cell, Karla would never know.� She had eaten a couple of meals of the awful
porridge and water.� After the initial
reprimand she had gotten she always ate what she was given.� She was hungry anyway, so it wasn�t as hard.

&nbsp;

Karla hoped that people were looking for her and she would
soon be rescued.� She had long stopped
trying to look through the darkness to try to figure out where the door
was.� She had felt over the entire
surface of the cell and could not make out any distinguishing
characteristics.� Her voice was hoarse
after hours and hours of alternating between yelling at her unseen captor and
screaming for help.� Karla had stopped
crying.� She was sinking further into
helplessness.� She spent most of the time
lying in a ball on the floor.� 

&nbsp;

A BLINDING light caused Karla to yelp hoarsely and cower in
alarm.


Strong arms grabbed Karla and dragged her from the cell.� She was completely disoriented and the light
was causing her eyes pain, even though they were closed.

&nbsp;

�STAND UP!�� A voice
shouted as she was dragged to a standing position.� Karla hadn�t been resisting
intentionally.� She started to shake violently.� She managed to stand alone.� She still couldn�t open her eyes.� She wondered if they would ever be able to
readjust to this searing light.

&nbsp;

�Turn!�� Hands pushed
her and she complied.� After a moment the
order was repeated, the hands shoved her into the desired position so she was
standing in a different direction.

&nbsp;

�P-p-please��� Karla
croaked.

&nbsp;

�Shut up!� Do not
speak unless told to.� Where you told to
speak?�

&nbsp;

�N-no.�

&nbsp;

Smack, a hand fell sharply across her cheek.� �Were you told to speak?�

&nbsp;

Karla remained silent.�
She tried to open her eyes but found that the light was still too strong
for them.� She was then abruptly
repositioned for a fourth time.

&nbsp;

�Okay, got �em.� Came a male voice
from across the room.� �She�s all yours.�

&nbsp;

Karla could not figure out what this meant as the rough
hands grabbed her and started to move her somewhere else.� She was finally beginning to get her bearings
and was even able to open her eyes a little bit.� Karla began to fight back.� She resisted the guidance of the hands and
began to kick in the direction that they were coming from.� She made contact with something and heard a
groan.

&nbsp;

The voice from across the room laughed, �All the bitches
always get ya, you should know that by now.�

&nbsp;

Karla was grabbed tightly and her arms were pinned beside
her.� She continued to struggle when her
captor�s voice harshly whispered in her ear, �You have chosen the hard
path.�� After this, she was briefly let
go and then felt a strong jolt of electricity in her shoulder that sent her
falling to the floor.� 

&nbsp;

In the moment that she was incapacitated she was scooped up
off of the floor and laid on a cold table of some sort.� Almost as quickly as she was deposited onto
the table, her arms and legs were tightly secured with restraints.� A band was then tightened around her
forehead, which made her not able to raise her head or turn her head from side
to side.� After this was completed, the
man who put her there left the room.�
Karla knew this because she heard the retreat of footsteps followed by
the opening and closing of a door.� It
seemed she was now alone.

&nbsp;

Strapped to the table and feeling vulnerable, Karla did the
only thing she could think of to try to regain some control of her
situation.� She worked on adjusting her
eyes to the light.� It was hard, much
harder than waking up and adjusting to a bedside light.� She had been not exposed to light for longer
than one night.� Slowly Karla was able to
open up one eye and then the other.� For
the first time she was able to take her new surroundings and found that there
was nothing remarkable or revealing about where she was.� In fact, in a way it was almost like it had
been in her dark cell, except there was now light, harsh light.

&nbsp;

She was in a white room.�
There were no windows and she could not see a door (although she could
not look behind her).� There were no
shelves or cabinets.� Everything was a
�sterile� white.� Straining her eyes
downward Karla saw that she was on some sort of stainless steel table.� She could not see what was holding her arms
and legs down, but they were held down tightly enough that she could not move
them.� She tried to wiggle her hands and
feet around, but nothing budged.� Karla
tried to move her head around again, she couldn�t.� She began to cry for real this time.� Tears rolling down her
cheeks and onto the cold table below with hoarse sobs echoing in the room.

&nbsp;

A sound behind her made Karla jump in
spite of her tears.� A gloved hand
with a tissue reached out and a woman�s voice instructed her to �blow� which
she did.� The sound of high heels on the
tile floor and the woman revealed herself to Karla.� She was a severe looking woman who had a
mysterious magnetism about her.� She was
not ugly.� Karla couldn�t stop staring at
her and was rendered speechless.� The
woman�s dark hair was pulled back tightly.�
She was wearing dark red lipstick and some rouge that defined her high
cheekbones, but that was all the make up she had on.� She didn�t need more.� She seemed to be wearing a strapless leather
garment, but Karla couldn�t get enough of a glimpse to be sure.


�You are wondering why you are here.�
That will become more apparent in due time.� All you need to know now is that this is the
beginning for you.� Your life will become
all it was destined to be.� You have been
selected by important people.� You should
be honored.�

&nbsp;

After hearing this, Karla snapped back to her senses.� She found her anger and spat back �Fuck you,
let me go.�� The woman just chuckled in
such a way that caused Karla to immediately shut up.

&nbsp;

�I know that this is not how you feel, but that doesn�t
matter.� How you feel right now is not
important.� I know that this will
change.�� The woman said this as she
reached down and sounded like she was sliding open a drawer.� Raising her hand the woman showed Karla a
pair of scissors before she started cutting at Karla�s clothes.� 

&nbsp;

Karla started jerking at her arms and legs, �What are you
doing?� STOP it!�

&nbsp;

The woman laughed cruelly again, �And how are you going to
make me stop?� It seems that you are
pretty stuck there.�� She snipped up the
side of the skirt that Karla had been trying on in the store where she was
taken and then pulled the garment from her.�


&nbsp;

�Stop it now or I will scream!�� Karla croaked.

&nbsp;

�And just who will hear you?�
Even if they could you can�t scream, you have been screaming too much as
it is.�� The woman started cutting off
Karla�s top.� �Besides, these things are
pretty nasty, you have been in them for two weeks and we need to get rid of
them.� I don�t think they can be saved,
so it�s better to destroy them.�

&nbsp;

�Two weeks!�� Thought Karla.� It
couldn�t have been that long.� �You can�t
do this to me.� People will be looking
for me.�

&nbsp;

�It seems I can do whatever I want,� said the woman, �how
are you going to stop me?�� She snipped
at Karla�s panties but didn�t pull them off.�
�And I suppose people might be looking for you, but I doubt it.�� She snipped the straps and the sides of
Karla�s bra but didn�t remove it either.

&nbsp;

�People are looking for me and they WILL find me,� Karla
said with what she hoped was authority, but she was scared.

&nbsp;

The woman calmly reached below the table again and produced
some documents.� �Karla Wilkes.� Social Security number 077-00-9888.� Currently a senior at Williams College
majoring in Psychology.� Parents
are Bud and Linda Wilkes.� Two sisters, both younger, Dana and Laura.� You are employed at a bakery on
weekends.� Your GPA is 3.3 � pretty
decent, could be better.� You have one
credit card and a checking account.�
Would you care for me to give you the info on those?�� The woman paused and looked at Karla.� �It�s too bad you have such a bad drug
problem.�

&nbsp;

Karla reacted violently to this. �I don�t do drugs.� What do you mean?� You are just trying to mess with me!� SHUT UP!�

&nbsp;

From below the table the woman produced something that she
quickly shoved in Karla�s mouth.� It was
a hard ball with straps that the woman brought under Karla�s head, with some
difficulty, and buckled tightly.� Karla
continued to try to yell from behind this intruder, but she sounded ridiculous
both from the gag and from the fact that her voice was already hoarse.

&nbsp;

�I got tired of listening to you.� You have to learn about you place.� I am usually very patient at first.� I always give leeway at first, one chance to
break the rules without consequences.�
Unfortunately, you used that up when you kicked my assistant.� You are now earning punishments.� Keep this in mind.� Now, about your drug problem�.�

&nbsp;

The woman produced a newspaper article and began to
read.� ��College student Karla Wilkes�s
car was discovered late Tuesday night outside an abandoned building.� Police investigators initially thought that
it was foul play until they discovered trace amounts of cocaine in the
car�Wilkes�s apartment had been packed up and it appears that she has left
town.� Upon further investigation,
detectives have determined that Wilkes was dealing drugs and most likely had a
significant drug history.� They have
ruled out foul play and have determined that Wilkes most likely skipped town
with her drug supplier boyfriend.�
Wilkes�s father, Bud Wilkes, has publicly condemned his daughter.� Neighbors said that they the Wilkes family
was initially devastated by the news but then disowned their daughter once
presented with the evidence of her crimes.��

&nbsp;

Finishing, the woman looked down at the girl glaring at her
in shock.� �It�s not a well written
article, but now you know, people don�t care where you went.� You broke their trust.�� She laughed cruelly.� �And now you belong to me.�� She showed Karla the other documents she was
holding, Karla�s birth certificate, social security card, and other important
financial documents.� �I will take care
of these, you have no use for them anymore.�� 

&nbsp;

She then whipped off Karla�s bra and panties, exposing her
completely.� Karla had never been naked
in front of anyone she didn�t know before and she felt ashamed.� Her breathing increased sharply and she was
afraid she might hyperventilate.

&nbsp;

The woman drew her fingers from Karla�s naked breasts down
over her pubic mound and over her legs.�
�Now, we will prepare you for orientation.� Behave and life will go well for you.� Don�t behave and suffer the
consequences.� The choice is ultimately
yours.�

&nbsp;

As she said this, a young woman entered the room who was not much younger than Karla.� From what Karla could tell, she was naked
except for a collar.� She gave a tray
with items Karla couldn�t see to her captor and then left the room.

&nbsp;

Pulling on the hair of Karla�s pussy, the woman said, �We
will start with this�
