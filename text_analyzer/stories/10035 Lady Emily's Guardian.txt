Synopsis: Lady Emily Wainwright, orphaned at the age of four, has been raised by her father's good friend, Mr. Aaron Singer. As young Lady Emily grows up and attracts a number of eager young suitors, Mr. Singer finds himself forming a plan for his young goddaughter. He knows her secret desires, and plans to fulfill them, and his own.






Mr. Singer

I sat quietly at the office desk, gazing out of the large window at the snow-covered grounds of Wainwright Hall. The sloping acres were spotted with trees, now bare in the mid-winter chill. I had made Wainwright Hall my home for the past 12 years, but I still marveled at its beauty all year round. In the spring, the hills were covered in yellow and white wildflowers, and the trees were lush and green. Beyond the hills there was a small valley and a pond, a pleasant place in the warm summer. In autumn, the trees turned gold, and shed all upon the hills. And even in the dead of winter, the frost-covered trees and white hills had their own kind of haunting beauty. 

I should have been working that cold afternoon. I was an attorney, and though I mostly served the sparsely populated villages surrounding Wainwright Hall, I was kept plenty busy by the wealthy neighbors and local businesses. I had a successful practice, and adding that income to the small fortune that I had earned years ago in South Africa, I could afford to live comfortably enough. The fact that I lived for free in Wainwright Hall, a place that I did not own, made amassing my fortune all the easier. I owned my own estate, further south, but leased it to various tenants, which was enough to keep the house staffed and maintained in my absence. I had my practice near Wainwright Hall, and my own responsibilities right there at the place that I called home.

I had come to live at Wainwright Hall after the death of my good friend, Sir Peter Wainwright. He and I had been close friends since our boyhood at school, and had gone together to South Africa to secure our fortunes. Sir Peter came from wealthy noble stock, and when we returned from our fruitful endeavors, he married a young woman of equally good standing and decent looks. Sir Peter and his wife Anne had one daughter, the young Lady Emily. Lady Anne died in childbirth, and though my friend was a fine-looking and wealthy young man, certainly an eligible bachelor, I don&#8217;t believe he ever desired to find another wife. He confessed to me that he had loved his wife very much, and had taken her death very hard. He turned all his love to his young daughter, a lovely child.

I figured that in time, my friend would come to terms his wife&#8217;s passing and find another wife. I was ready to settle down myself. But Sir Peter&#8217;s illness changed everything. He wrote to me, requesting that I come to him as quickly as I could. Though I had been living on my own since we&#8217;d returned to England, Wainwright Hall was only a day&#8217;s train ride away, and I spent many holidays there throughout the year. I enjoyed the time with my friend, who had been very depressed since his wife&#8217;s untimely passing, and was quite fond of little Lady Emily, a polite but precocious girl. 

Of course, I went to Sir Peter&#8217;s side quickly. He had been struck by a mysterious and deadly illness, and was surely hours from death. Pale-faced and gaunt, he grabbed me by the arm and made me promise to care for my young goddaughter. �She has no family in this world to speak of,� he said. �And there would be many people eager to manipulate a child who has such a fortune in her name. You are the closest that I&#8217;ve ever had to a brother, Aaron�will you care for my daughter like your own?�

I gave him my solemn word, and he died the next morning. I held his sad child, the poor little orphan, in my arms as she cried, her mournful wailing dissolving into fearful whimpers until she fell into an exhausted sleep. She was only four-years-old. She needed protection, and I swore, to my departed friend and to myself, that I would be the one to provide it.

And so, I stayed on at Wainwright Hall. Young Lady Emily already had a nanny, so I kept the kindly old lady on to take care of the child&#8217;s day-to-day care and needs as I worked on building my practice. I had tried, and ultimately failed, to start up a business law practice in the south, and so I relocated and expanded my expertise to personal law as well. Though I stayed busy, I made the time to help educate the young girl. Like her father, she was intelligent, and could pick up new skills and information very quickly. She amazed me by learning how to read before the passing of her father; with my help, she mastered speaking, writing, and reading in French by the age of six. And though most people would say that it was unnecessary for a young lady to learn about math and sciences, I taught her in those subjects as well, keeping her up to date on new advances in science and medicine while teaching her arithmetic and even more complex mathematics. She was so incredibly bright, and I even debated sending her off to school to further her education. But she was a young lady, and the last of the Wainwright line, and her place was at Wainwright Hall.

Though she has always treated me with the respect of a daughter to her father, I have always emphasized that Wainwright Hall was her home. �I am only here to help you,� I would say. �I am your guardian, Emily, but I am also your friend.� By her teenage years, she was my most trusted confidant. Though I had a few friends with whom I enjoyed a drink or two at one of the village pubs on a weekend evening, Emily was the one that I trusted and cared for the most. Emily and I had always gotten along famously, and I can recall few disagreements between us. My plans to find a wife and settle down were put on hold, but I did not mind. I was happy enough at Wainwright Hall, and very comfortable indeed.

That snowy afternoon, Emily and I would have one of our few disagreements. As I sat daydreaming, gazing out at the gorgeous wintry scene before me, I heard a soft tapping at the open door. I turned in my seat to see the young lady herself, standing there patiently. At 16, she was the loveliest young lady in the area. I had thrown her an appropriately extravagant debutant ball only a few months before, and since then, she had received countless invitations to parties, some as far away as London. I rarely allowed her to make the trip just to attend a party, but I had accompanied her to a particularly lavish New Year&#8217;s Eve ball just the month before.

The pretty girl had also been entertaining a few suitors, many of them eligible young men of fine birth. I did not object to the courting, but I had feared where it might lead. My fears had come to fruition just a couple of days before, and I was sure that this was what my serious-faced goddaughter wished to discuss. 

�Excuse me, sir,� she said, ever polite when speaking to me, �I don&#8217;t wish to disturb you, but there is an urgent matter that we need to address.�

�You&#8217;re not disturbing me at all, Emily,� I said. �You have my full attention.�

I did not invite Emily into the room, but that would have been an unnecessary gesture. It was her house, after all. But she nodded and came in slowly, taking a seat across the desk from where I sat. 

�I do not want to throw any accusations at you until I&#8217;ve heard your side,� she began. I nodded and she continued. �I was just visiting with Miss Catherine Gainsley. You know that her older brother Mr. Maxwell Gainsley has been courting me for several months?�

I nodded. �I do.�

�When you and I have spoken of him, you were very complimentary of his character and social standing,� Emily said.

�Indeed I was,� I agreed. �He is a respectful young gentleman, not unintelligent, and his family has a fortune that is comparable to your own.�

�Some would say that Mr. Gainsley and I are evenly matched,� Emily pressed.

I nodded again. �I suppose they would.�

�But you do not think so,� Emily said, and it was not a question. �That is why, when he requested you for my hand in marriage, you refused him.�

I didn&#8217;t say anything for a moment. I examined Emily&#8217;s face. She is usually a carefree girl, not usually so serious. Her father had been the same way, always joking around, taking almost everything as sport. I enjoyed talking and joking with Emily as much as I had with her father. I had never seen her looking so serious, angry, even, as she did that afternoon in my office. I had to explain my reasoning to her calmly and carefully. I felt certain that she would see things my way when we were through.

�That is what happened, according to my friend Miss Gainsley,� Emily continued. �Can you explain this to me, sir?�

�Emily,� I said, �you&#8217;re absolutely right. I don&#8217;t think that you and the young Mr. Gainsley are a good match for each other.�

�Why not?� Emily asked.

�Do you remember last autumn, when you and I spent a month in South Africa? That was very exciting for you, wasn&#8217;t it? And when you came back, you wanted to tell all of your friends and suitors about the strange and interesting things you&#8217;d seen and done there, didn&#8217;t you?�

She nodded at the memory. I had taken Emily on a few trips away from her home, always using my own money to finance these excursions. I had taken her to Paris, America, South Africa, and to visit some friends of mine in Germany. She loved to travel. She was a modern woman, a bit before her time, but wealthy enough to do whatever she wanted to do.

�I remember,� I continued, �walking past the parlor while you were entertaining young Mr. Gainsley, only a few days after we had returned. You were telling the story of how we had taken that tour in the jungle, and the strange monkey that had stolen your hat, do you remember? And you told that story so well, each time with more and more enthusiasm. I daresay that you saved your best performance for him. But he could not be more disinterested in what you had to say. I found that very odd. Didn&#8217;t you?�

�I�� Emily paused for a moment. �I don&#8217;t remember.� But she did remember, I could tell that she did, and I smiled.

�This young man does not share your interests,� I said.

�But that doesn&#8217;t mean we can&#8217;t get married,� Emily argued, her voice hinting to whine. She was never a whiney or bratty child, so I knew she wouldn&#8217;t pout as I calmly explained my position.

�No, but it means that you shouldn&#8217;t. Emily, you cannot really love someone unless you have something in common with him. What do you and Mr. Gainsley have in common?�

�We both like riding,� Emily said firmly.

�Ah,� I said, �and how many times have you and Mr. Gainsley shared an afternoon ride together?�

�I like to ride alone,� Emily said.

I shook my head. �Not always. You&#8217;ve ridden with me countless times, and you meet your friend Miss Tatiana Howard every other week to take your horses to an open pasture. And the only time I&#8217;ve see young Mr. Gainsley on a horse is during the annual fox hunt, and his riding skills leave much to be desired.�

�You just don&#8217;t like him,� Emily accused me. 

�Not so,� I said, still as calm as ever as she began to boil. �I have no issue with the young Mr. Gainsley. And I meant all the complimentary things that I said. I do think he&#8217;s a fine young man�I simply don&#8217;t feel like the two of you are well-suited.�

Emily changed tactics. �But sir,� she said, �I&#8217;m 16. It&#8217;s time for me to get married.�

�You&#8217;re too young,� I said simply.

She practically did pout this time. �I&#8217;m not too young,� she huffed. �Mary Steepleton got married when she was 15, and had her first child at 16.�

�That&#8217;s all well and good for Mrs. Steepleton,� I said. �It was an appropriate time for her to marry. Her family was in financial trouble, and Mr. Steepleton was a wealthy widow. She married advantageously, saved the family name and property, and will live more happily than she might have. Good for her.�

�What difference does it make?� Emily asked.

�It makes all the difference, my dear,� I said. �You, Emily, are a very wealthy and intelligent young woman. You have a sense of adventure, and if you were to marry now, you would never get to see all the places or do all of the things that you&#8217;ve talked of doing.�

�We could travel,� Emily said, but her argument was weakening.

�I don&#8217;t know the Gainsleys to travel much,� I remarked.

Poor Lady Emily looked to be on the verge of tears. I had been relentless in my counterarguments, but she is typically a more worthy opponent. Her emotions had gotten the best of her. �Emily,� I said, more gently than before, �why do you love this young man?�

She looked at me, confused for a moment, her eyes brimming with unfallen tears. �Well,� she said, �he�he&#8217;s handsome, and kind, and he comes from a good family.�

�Perhaps,� I said, �you are buckling under some pressure that has been placed on you by some our well-meaning friends and neighbors. They may think that they know what is best for you, that you should marry young and well, and that will be your key to happiness. But my dear Emily, the times are changing, and our old-fashioned neighbors do not know what is best for you. They do not know what is in your heart. You are still so young, even if you don&#8217;t think so. Take it from an old man, Emily. You are wealthy enough to take care of yourself, and to do everything that you want to do in life. Marriage can wait.�

�All right,� she caved, �I acknowledge that Mr. Gainsley may not be the best match for me. But what if I do find the right one? Would you grant me permission then?�

I looked at my beautiful goddaughter carefully again. She could have any man she wanted. There would come a time when I would not be able to stop her from marrying. But, for the time being, I still had influence over her. �I&#8217;ll make you a deal, Emily,� I said. �When you turn 18, you may marry whomever you like, if you wish. Until that time comes, I will not allow you to marry�unless I feel absolutely certain that the young man is the best match for you.�

Emily nodded. She did not argue this. She thought that I was only looking out for her best interests. She trusted me. 

�Can we consider the matter settled?� I asked.

�Yes, sir,� Emily said.

�Good,� I said. �Why don&#8217;t we step into the parlor and have our afternoon tea? I don&#8217;t imagine that we&#8217;ll receive any more callers today, with the snow picking up.�

And we continued our afternoon pleasantly enough. Emily forgot her troubles, and was fully herself again as we had our tea. We spent the afternoon reading quietly in the study, as was our custom when going outside was impossible. But as I stared at my text, I was now the one with a troubled mind.

I had lied to my young Emily. Oh, I had not lied about thinking that young Mr. Gainsley was not a good match for her. That was the truth. But I had told her that at 18, I would allow her to marry. This was not entirely the truth. She would marry at 18, but it would be to the man that I had already selected for her personally. That man was me.

Yes, I had fallen in love with my young charge, but she did not know it. She may have suspected it, but I never asked her, and I will never know if this was the case. But I had been falling in love with her since she had started to become a woman. I would lie awake in bed at night, and would fantasize about going to her, climbing into her bed and waking her gently before giving her all of my love.

Such thoughts disturbed me at first. I had never looked at Emily with anything but fatherly love since the day she was born. I was not a lonely man; I had a couple of women in the villages that I would see regularly, and my whores kept me satisfied enough. But I began to think of Emily constantly, thinking about her soft dark hair and her lovely light skin. She looked quite a bit like her mother, as far as her features went, but while Anne had been passably pretty, Emily was stunningly beautiful. She had a special glow to her, and I was convinced that she had inherited that from her father. Like his daughter, he had been irresistible to the opposite sex.

As time passed, and I saw Emily with her suitors, I began to think of what life would be like with Emily as my bride. And over time, I began to realize that I didn&#8217;t want my life any other way. I needed my sweet Emily, my little girl, to be mine forever. Even then, as we sat together on that stormy yet pleasant afternoon, I was formulating a plan for her. The plan would go into effect on her 18th birthday; for the time being, all I would have to do was keep her unmarried and virginal. She was a virtuous young woman, and would not give herself away to just any suitor. She would be mine, all mine, on her 18th birthday.


My plans for Emily had started to take form during a trip to Paris. It was our third visit, and Emily knew all of her favorite shops to visit. I would give her money and send her along with her nanny; I financed her little shopping excursions, not wanting her to dip into her family fortune just to satisfy her girlish whims. She was much more conservative with my money; if I had allowed her free reign over what was rightfully hers, I was afraid that she would not be so responsible. She was still able to get everything she wanted; I ensured that she was a spoiled child.

She was 15 on that trip, and just starting to come into her womanhood. Her little breasts were forming nicely, and she kept a slim but womanly shape under a tight corset. I found myself looking her over much more than I had when she was young and undeveloped, and I would look away, embarrassed, hoping she had not noticed the extra attention. She knew she was pretty, and she was vain enough already, always glancing at herself briefly in any reflective surface. 

Little Lady Emily enjoyed staying with the latest fashions, and that trip, her mission was to find the perfect gown for her debutante ball, which, as she did not fail to remind me several times, was only two short months away. She succeeded on our fourth day there, and that evening, she excitedly modeled her evening gown for me in our large hotel suite. The gown was silk, a lovely sage green that complimented her light grey eyes. The neckline of the dress was almost scandalously low, and the straps upon her shoulders were thinner than was the style, decorated with silk flowers that draped around her upper arms. The gown flowed out only slightly, creating a slimmer silhouette than most ball gowns of the time. The train spread behind her elegantly. 

Had I viewed little Lady Emily as just my little goddaughter, I would have insisted that she return the gown and would have exchanged harsh words with her nanny for allowing her to make such a reckless purchase. But sweet Emily looked so beautiful and elegant, and I had to fight the urge to sweep her into my arms and kiss her deeply. The sudden urge made me flush, and she smiled.

�Is it too &#8216;Paris&#8217; for Wainwright Hall?� she asked anxiously. I could tell that she really liked the dress. It was forward, certainly, and might draw a few judgmental glares. I warned her of this, but she smiled. �Who cares? The sort of people who might judge this gown harshly are not the sort of people whose attentions I require, anyway.�

I grinned at her. �I think it&#8217;s lovely. To hell with the conservatives.� She laughed at my declaration, and because we were in Paris, we enjoyed a glass of champagne together while she strutted around the hotel suite in her gown. 

It was not at that moment that I decided to make her mine, however. This came very shortly after. After we had taken our dinner at the hotel and taken in a show, we went back up to the suite for the evening. The nanny, staying two floors below, had already finished putting Lady Emily&#8217;s new things away and had retired to her quarters. As Emily occupied the lavatory, I noticed one of her little shopping bags had been left out.

I went to the bag and took a peek inside. I was more than a little surprised at what I found. I recognized what they were immediately, for I am no stranger to sexual activities that many would call �deviant.� But to see them in my little Emily&#8217;s shopping bag was quite a shock. Inside the bag were little metal nipple clips. It was unmistakable. She could have picked them up at any number of back-alley shops specializing in such wares; I had visited a few myself. But how had she slipped away from her nanny long enough to procure them?

I was not to find out. I quickly put the clips back in the bag and sat down in an armchair, pretending to ignore the bag as Emily came back into the room. She had gone out in a more conservative dress that evening, but she still looked lovely, her dark hair styled in neat curls around her prettily flushed face. She smiled at me. �I think I will retire for the evening. Goodnight, sir.�

�Goodnight, Emily.�

She spotted the bag on the floor. �Hallo! Nanny must have forgotten to put this one away.� I noticed that her cheeks took on a deeper shade of red as she left the room with her taboo purchase. �Goodnight,� she said again, a bit awkwardly, as she went into her private quarters, closing the door.

I stayed up for a while. It was a cool spring evening, and it had started to rain. I lit the fireplace and sat in my armchair, enjoying a generous glass of brandy. As I stared at the fire and listened to the pattering of the cold steady rain against the windows, I thought about the events of the evening. First that sexy little debutante gown; she certainly would draw a number of disapproving stares, but she would draw many more appreciative ones. Then, on our evening out on the town, she had been just as charming and lovely as she always has been. A perfect companion in every way. Then the biggest shock of all, finding the nipple clamps.

I wondered what it could mean. Why would a girl so young have interest in such forbidden things? Perhaps for just that reason, just for the fact that they were forbidden. I remembered a conversation that I&#8217;d had with Sir Peter, before his wife&#8217;s death and his daughter&#8217;s birth. Over a private smoke in his library, the same room that later served as my office, he had revealed that the Lady Anne was a very sexually adventurous woman. Sir Peter, a gentleman, did not divulge any more details than that. Perhaps Lady Emily had inherited that trait from her mother. The thought made me smile.

I indulged my sexual fantasies about her, allowing myself to lie in bed and rub my stiff cock as I thought of sweet Emily, wearing her nipple clips under her pretty clothes. Over the next few months, I began to form my plans for her. But I decided to wait until she turned 18; it seemed appropriate, considering that it was the same age that her mother had been when she married. Yes; when she turned 18, she would be mine. Until then, I would simply have to wait.

But it proved to be very difficult, especially after her big debut into society. Her party was a smashing success, and surprisingly, her dress received rave reviews from all in attendance. She looked �sophisticated and lovely,� and she certainly did, wearing her gown and her mother&#8217;s jewels (and her own nipple clips, I hoped). I watched her dance with so many young men that evening. She saved one dance for me, and as we faced each other in our row, I couldn&#8217;t help smiling at her. She looked so happy and beautiful.

And I certainly wasn&#8217;t the only one who thought so. It was painful to see her flirting pleasantly with her many suitors. I could tell right away that she preferred the young Mr. Gainsley, though she frequently hosted other young men in the parlor as well. But I figured it was a necessary process. I would allow her a couple of years to be a young available lady, before making her my own. That was my gift to her. And during that time, I continued to provide her with the same care and loving guidance that I always had. She did not know that I was guiding her to my bedroom, to my arms.

After I got little Lady Emily to agree to hold off on marriage, I was faced with one last obstacle: the presence of her loving nanny. I considered dismissing her, providing her with a generous amount of money to retire on. But to do so would hurt Emily; she was so attached to her nanny, who had been with her since she was born. 

I was spared having to make this difficult decision. Nanny came to me and reported that her sister, a widow, was in failing health. �I must go to her,� she said urgently. �I don&#8217;t wish to leave Lady Emily alone, but��

�She is practically a woman now,� I finished for her. �It will be painful for everyone to lose you, Nanny. Wainwright Hall will not be the same without you.� And Lady Emily had certainly been upset, but she understood that her nanny needed to go. I gave her nanny money, as I&#8217;d originally planned, and she was out of our lives. That would make things so much easier.

A couple of months before the big event, I went to visit my friend, Dr. Yates. I complained of insomnia, and after reporting that my diet and amount of physical activity had not changed as of late, I admitted that there were circumstances that weighed heavily on my mind. �I find that I cannot sleep. My troubles crowd my mind; I can hardly get any relief.�

My sympathetic friend gave me a bottle of sleeping medicine, guaranteeing that a spoonful in a drink before bed would grant me a full night&#8217;s sleep. I thanked him sincerely and left after a cigar and pleasant conversation, and more than once on the way home, I reached into my coat pocket and felt the small bottle. I had pretended my symptoms; I slept like a rock. But the medicine would factor in to my plans for my sweet little Emily.

Her 18th birthday came. We had a private dinner at home, but she still wore one of her lovely new gowns from our most recent trip to Paris. She looked irresistible in the candlelight; as I gave her a glass of wine (with an extra special ingredient just for her), I reminded myself that in just a few short hours, she would be mine forever.

After dinner, we sat together in the study. She played on her piano for a little while. She took lessons when she was young, but had never kept to her practicing. So she only tinkered, until her groggy head forced her to sit heavily in the armchair opposite mine. �Oh, my,� she declared, �I feel so tired all of a sudden.�

�Close your eyes for a moment, my dear,� I said softly. �We&#8217;ll be retiring to bed soon. Would you like me to read to you?�

�Mmmm, yes, please,� she sighed. The drug was taking over. I picked up a book of poems by Alfred Lord Tennyson and began to read, glancing over the top of the book occasionally to see Emily&#8217;s progression into unconsciousness. The moment that I noticed that her eyes were closed and her breathing had gone shallow in sleep, I put down the book and gathered her in my arms. She is a light girl, having inherited her mother&#8217;s little physique, and I easily carried her to my bedroom, the master bedchamber of Wainwright Hall.

I would rape my sweet little Lady Emily that night. I knew that it was what she wanted; I knew her secret desires. Besides the nipple clips from Paris, I had found two other pieces of evidence that led me to my conclusion. I am still ashamed to admit that I went into her bedchamber, without her permission, when she was out calling on a friend. I did this on several occasions.

The first time, I found a piece of literature that startled and pleased me. It was a work by the controversial and perverted writer Marquis de Sade, his La Philosophie dans le boudoir. I found the book under her pillow, and it was clearly well-thumbed. I was not unfamiliar with the author, but I was fascinated by the content of the book. I so forgot myself in reading that when I heard the Lady Emily greeting her nanny downstairs, I swiftly replaced the book and hurried out of her bedchamber just in time to go unnoticed. I would later procure my own copy and would have various scenes selected, to try on her when the right time came.

On my second trip to her bedchamber, I found her personal diary. I sat at her vanity and flipped through it. Much of it was trivial and girlish, but there were some interesting entries. She would write out her sexual fantasies. She wanted to be tied up and taken by a strong, dark man. I remembered her flirting with a small group of black laborers in Paris, only briefly smiling and waving at them as we passed by. I knew she had enjoyed their appreciative stares. The memory made me smile.

I was pleased to see a couple of comments in her diary regarding feelings of sexual tension around me. She had written: �Mr. Singer, my guardian, is so kind to me. He is such a handsome and good man, and I hope that he will marry well. I will admit, only in this my private diary, that I have had forbidden thoughts about my dear old friend. Such an idea is a silly one, I know. And still�� Another comment in similar form, made just a fortnight before my reading, was found. Though I had often joked with Emily, referring to myself as �an old man� over the years, in actuality I was only 38 when I claimed her. I liked to think of myself as an attractive man still, and I was happy that my sweet girl felt the same. I left little Lady Emily&#8217;s bedchamber feeling very pleased, and set in my plans.

And so, on her 18th birthday, I carried Lady Emily into my bedchamber to rape her, just as I knew she craved. She would be in deep sleep for hours; I had given her a double-dose of Dr. Yates&#8217;s medicine, to ensure that I would have plenty of time to set my plans into motion. I laid her gently on the large bed, and slowly removed her gown. Her corset was tricky, as tight as she liked to pull it, but I&#8217;d had some experience undressing a woman before.

I was pleased to see her wearing the nipple clips under her corset. No, no�they were different ones. I smiled, wondering what sort of collection of taboo accessories she had been gathering over the years. I kept the nipple clips on, and nothing else, as I prepared her.

Before restraining her tightly to the bedposts, I brushed out her hair carefully. She wore it in tight curls, as was the fashion, but I preferred her hair long and loose. I didn&#8217;t often see her hair undone, but seeing her that evening, naked with her hair looking so wild and lovely, was nearly enough to stop my heart.

I tied her tightly but carefully, using silk ropes that I had purchased years ago for just this sort of activity. The bedposts were tall and sturdy in the four corners of the bed, made for tying up little girls, I suppose. She was spread-eagle, lying on top of the covers, completely exposed to me.

I examined her naked form carefully. Her pubic hair was neatly trimmed, forming a neat little triangle over her cunt. I was so tempted to touch her, to finger her virgin pussy. Because in spite of all of her sexual urges, I knew that she was still a virgin. She had kept her dark desires a secret, as far as she knew. A recent diary reading had confirmed this. She was certainly all mine.

I restrained my urges, and after shoving a wadded handkerchief into her mouth to serve as a gag, I prepared the room. I lit several candles on the bedside table and on the table by the large windows. I lit the fireplace; it was a chilly evening, unusually so for May, and I did not want my sweet little Emily to be cold in her nakedness. She would be spending quite a lot of time naked.

I sat and read another Marquis de Sade work as I waited for Emily to awaken. I looked forward to being able to share the book with her. She finally began to stir just after the clock struck 2. I put the book aside and sat at her hip on the bed, as naked as she, waiting for her to open her eyes.

When she finally looked up at me, she was confused at first. Then, her confusion quickly turned to fear as she weakly struggled against her restraints, letting out a tiny muffled cry. �Don&#8217;t be afraid, Emily,� I whispered, touching her face softly. �Happy birthday, my dear. I have a surprise for you. A very big surprise.� I stroked my cock, already hardening. Oh, God, I would have her so soon.

She let out another muffled cry, and I shushed her. �I know what you want, Emily,� I said. �I know what&#8217;s in your heart. You&#8217;re a dirty little girl, aren&#8217;t you, Emily?� She shook her head, clearly distressed. �Yes, yes, you want to be naughty. I know everything, Emily. I&#8217;m going to give you what you want tonight, my dear, because�I love you.�

She was quiet then. I had never said the words to her, nor she to me. We had always cared for each other. But this was so different. I loved her passionately, and I would make love to her passionately. I touched her face again, and I was surprised and displeased to see tears in her eyes. �Oh, no, my Emily, what&#8217;s the matter?� I removed the handkerchief from her mouth.

�Oh, please, sir,� she sobbed. �Please, please, I&#8217;m sorry, don&#8217;t do this.�

�Emily,� I said tenderly, �I&#8217;d like you to call me by my name.�

�Mr. Singer��

�No, my dear,� I said, still patient. �My Christian name.� Though I&#8217;d known the girl her entire life, and had raised her for most of it, she had never addressed me as anything other than &#8216;sir.&#8217; Never &#8216;Uncle Aaron,&#8217; as her father had called me in her presence when she was a young child, and only &#8216;Mr. Singer&#8217; to friends and acquaintances, and even in her own diary. 

�Aaron,� she said hesitantly. �Please, I&#8217;m sorry.�

�Why are you sorry, Emily?� I asked, genuinely puzzled.

�I know it&#8217;s bad to have the nipple clips,� she said. �I�I was just playing with them. I only just bought them in Paris last month, and was just trying them out��

�That is a lie, Emily,� I snapped. I&#8217;d never known my sweet Emily to lie to me before. �I know that you bought your first pair of clips over two years ago. And it was not the same pair as the one you are wearing now.�

Her eyes brimmed with tears. �Please, sir, I&#8217;m not�I mean, I don&#8217;t��

�Emily, I may as well be honest with you,� I said. �Since I saw that first pair of clips, I&#8217;ve been doing a little spying on you. I know that you are interested in sexually deviant activities. You blush, even now, only enjoying your private little thoughts by yourself in your own bedchamber. You need not be ashamed of your desires, Emily. Just as it says in your favorite book, you should enjoy your body. And as I am your oldest and dearest friend, I wish to aid you in that endeavor.�

She was certainly shocked. She was speechless. I slowly and gently began to touch her left breast, only stroking her soft skin with the tips of my fingers. Vain little Emily, the outdoorswoman that she was, kept her skin well protected from the sun, so her skin was pale and silky to the touch. She shuddered slightly, and her clamped nipples hardened, causing her to moan softly and arch her back very slightly. She was already reacting so well to my touch.

But she snapped out of her shock and declared, �Please, sir, we cannot do this!�

I stopped touching her, withdrawing my hand. I could indulge her for a while yet. I would have her soon enough, whether she was willing or not. �Why not, Emily?� I asked patiently.

She said in a hurried panic, �You are my father&#8217;s oldest friend. Don&#8217;t you feel that this is not right?�

�Absolutely not,� I said confidently. �I have thought this over for years, Emily. Your father is long gone; I am the one who has taken care of you. I have told you that I wanted to find the right match for you. All things considered, I believe that you and I are very well matched.�

�You do?�

I nodded. �Oh, yes, Emily. Have we not always gotten along well? We have many of the same interests in music, sport, and literature. We both enjoy traveling. And we both happen to have an interest in strange sexual activities.�

�I&#8217;m a virgin, sir,� Emily whimpered, and I smiled.

�I know it, my dear, and I&#8217;m so glad,� I said. I kissed her softly on the forehead. �Not to worry, my sweet little Emily. I will be so gentle with you.� I whispered in her ear. �I am your friend, Emily. I am only here to help you.�

I climbed on top of her, straddling her waist. She began to sputter weak protests, and I smiled and shoved the handkerchief back into her mouth after planting a kiss on her sweet lips. After gagging her, I kissed her neck softly, nibbling at the sensitive place between her neck and shoulder. I have found this to be a pleasure spot for some women, and was pleased to find it so for my Emily. Her muffled little cries of fear turned to soft moans as I kissed my way down her neck and to her chest. 

I licked and teased her nipples through her clips, and she arched her back again beneath me. This gave me an idea. I left her briefly and retrieved a thin chain from my own collection of toys. I was able to easily link the ends of the chain to the clips. I planned to grab hold of the chain and tug softly (and perhaps less than softly) while I rode her, but for the time being, I let it sit and kissed my way down her soft little stomach. She was such a tiny girl, but she had a delicious set of hips and a tight, shapely ass. I reached beneath her and grabbed at her ass; I felt her tighten against me, and I laughed softly. �Relax for me, Emily. I will know your ass very well, soon.� 

She let out another muffled cry, but relaxed again as I slid down between her legs. I first explored her virgin territory with my tongue. I found her hymen to be broken, but I was not displeased. This meant that she liked to play with herself, a fact that I had already verified in her secret diary. I found her little clitoris and took it gently in my mouth, sucking on the sweet bud. Emily shuddered wildly, moaning much more loudly than before. 

I brought her to the brink of climax, but I wanted her to experience it with me inside of her. I brought the tip of my ready cock to the opening of her cunt. She was mine, mine, mine. She looked up at me with fearful eyes. I touched her face tenderly as I began to slide into her. �Relax, Emily,� I repeated, and I felt her do so. She had been training her little cunt, and it was about to pay off for her. �That&#8217;s it, my dear, very good.� I thrust into her, full hilt, smashing the tip of my cock into her cervix as I fucked her as deeply as possible. Her virgin cunt was so tight and lovely around my suffering cock. I had not had a woman in weeks, in anticipation of my little prize, and the wait had been worth it.

I held myself inside of her for a moment. Emily moaned in pain, but relaxed after the initial shock. I began to thrust in and out of her, slowly but deeply, enjoying the feel of her. I watched her face for reaction. She winced as I stretched the walls of her virgin pussy, but again, began to relax under my prompting. I spoke to her as I raped her. �Emily, my sweet Emily, you are such a good fuck. I&#8217;ve never had a sweet little virgin like you. I&#8217;m going to give you everything, my lady, just relax for your friend and let me make you feel wonderful.� 

I put my hands on her hips and raised them slightly, angling her so that I could go deeper. I felt the walls of her pussy quiver wildly around my cock. Her breathing was becoming more and more rapid, wild moans escaping her lips, her chest heaving. I grabbed the chain in one hand and kept hold of her hips with the other. As I pulled on her tortured nipples, she let out a scream into her gag. Drool ran ungracefully down the corners of her mouth as she arched her back, raising her hips even higher for me. �Relax for me, my dear, and let yourself lose control,� I instructed, sensing that she was going to orgasm. I felt it the moment that she did; she screamed even louder, her eyes rolling into the back of her head. At the same moment, I allowed myself to release into her, filling her with my own cum. When I finally removed my cock from her, my semen leaked slowly from her now-gaping hole.

I smiled at my sweaty, panting Emily. I reached over and removed her gag. She only gasped for breath for a moment, saying nothing, and neither did I as I sat by her side, waiting patiently. She stared into my eyes. She still looked fearful, but there was something else there, a glint of desire. I had been right; she had wanted this, and she was so glad to have gotten it.

We talked it over as she lay, still restrained to what would now be our bed. We came to an agreement: she would be my submissive little whore. We would go away for a while, and while we were abroad, we would marry. We would return to Wainwright Hall and resume our lives, as husband and wife. She would be Lady Emily Singer of Wainwright, and I would be her adoring husband, Sir Aaron. She did not hesitate to agree to any of my terms, and seemed especially enthusiastic about serving me as my little sex slave.

I had her once more that night. After kissing her roughly for a time, I untied her and turned her around, her ass facing me. I tied her wrists together, binding them to an opening in the headboard. I had her bend her knees and tuck them under herself, so she was kneeling with her head down. I spread her legs and tied her ankles loosely.

Kneeling behind her, I rested the tip of my already hardening cock against her ass. Her cheeks were forced wide by her position, but her little hole was quite small. Some lubrication, and a lot of brute force, would be required.

I spoke to my Emily gently as I stroked her ass with my fingertips. �Your favorite book features many scenes of sodomy,� I said. �Is that something you&#8217;ve been wanting to try?�

�Yes, sir,� she said shyly. In spite of my request for her to call me by name, she would never do so again after her first nervous attempt. I would always be &#8216;sir,&#8217; and given our situation, it only seemed appropriate.

I stroked her ass cheeks softly. �You have a pretty little ass, my Emily. I am going to sodomize you. It will hurt, but I have a feeling that you will like it.�

�Yes, sir,� she said again, and I laughed softly. I lubricated my cock with lotion, and spread some onto my fingers. I would take my time and prepare her. I kneeled behind her again and raised my hand, smacking her ass hard enough to leave a red imprint of my hand. She yowled in pain, and I decided that I would leave her without her gag for this part. I had no fear of the servants hearing our activities; the married couple in our service lived in a cottage nearly a kilometer from the main house, and our other maid resided in town with her family. Her screams would only fall on my appreciative ears.

I smacked her again, harder this time, before shoving two lubricated fingers into her asshole. She yelled and writhed in pain, but did not beg me to stop, which prompted me to spank her even harder. Between blows, I would thrust my fingers into her, lubing her little asshole and stretching her in preparation for my cock. I am not a small man, by any means.

I said nasty things to her as I spanked her ass. �You are my dirty little whore, Lady Emily,� I hissed, spanking her again. I was leaving her ass red and raw, and it felt so hot to the touch. �You&#8217;re going to be a hot little fuck for your good friend.� I grabbed her hair and yanked her head back roughly. She gasped at this harsh handling as I nibbled on her neck, guiding my cock to her asshole and thrusting into her. She screamed, a little, a halted gasp of a scream as I thrust into her again, and began to fuck her roughly. She screamed for me, saying things that pressed me on and on.

�Oh, God, sir!� she cried, as I pounded into her. �Oh, it hurts! You&#8217;re so huge, sir! Oh, God!�

I reached down and found her clit, rubbing roughly as I continued to fuck her. She moved her hips with me, getting into a rhythm as I stroked her off. She came before I did, screaming and coating my eager fingers with her rich juices. As I licked her sweetness from my fingers, I groaned and came, filling her once again. When I removed myself from her, I licked her raw asshole, cleaning some of the semen that was leaking from her hole. She shuddered and moaned, and I knew she was feeling the pleasure and pain. Exactly what she wanted.

I groped her tortured tits as I came down from my orgasm-induced high. I felt dizzy as I leaned in to kiss her neck again. She smelled so sweet. I buried my face in the wild tangles of her dark hair. �I love you, my Emily,� I murmured in her ear.

�I love you, too, sir,� she whispered, and I turned her head to me and kissed her softly. 

I eventually untied her and took her into my private bathroom. We bathed together in the large tub, and as I washed her back gently, she confessed all of her desires to me. She even admitted that, in her little fantasies, I was usually the one she was with. �It all shamed me,� she said. �I thought that having such forbidden thoughts about my guardian was�immoral.�

�And what is morality, anyway?� I asked, and to this she had no reply. I continued, �We have but one life. That is all we are guaranteed, is it not? There is not guarantee of any sort of afterlife, or reincarnation, or any of those religious ideas about what happens after death. This is all. Why not live for pleasure? Who would it harm?�

My sweet Emily had no response to that, either, and was silent as I bathed her gently. Her body quivered at the slightest touch, so sensitive from the shock of our rough lovemaking. She whimpered and cried a little as I finished washing her. Poor child; she was physically and emotionally exhausted. After our bath I dried her quickly, and took her by the hand, gently leading her back to my bed.

I brushed her hair before tucking her under the covers. As I sat against the headboard, I wrapped my bare legs around her, and she sat with her lower back against my crotch. As I carefully combed through her tangles, she said, �Oh, sir, I&#8217;m so afraid.�

�Why, Emily?� She could not say. �Don&#8217;t be afraid,� I said gently. �Tell me honestly, Emily. Did you enjoy what I did to you tonight?�

�Yes, sir,� she answered without hesitation. 

�Did you like when I spanked you, Emily?� I asked. 

�Yes, sir,� she said, and I could tell that saying so embarrassed her. �It hurt, but I did enjoy it. Yes.�

�So you would want to do more of those things with me?� I asked.

�Yes, sir,� she said. �But I�I cannot put it to words, but it scares me so.� 

I set the brush on the bedside table and wrapped my arms around her tightly. I kissed the top of her head. �My dear,� I said, �You have no reason to be afraid. You know that I care for you very much�I do love you, Emily. We will do things together that will be frightening, but I will be careful with you. You are so, so precious to me.� I kissed her again.

I tucked her beneath the covers and blew out all of the candles. The only light in the large bedchamber came from the glowing embers of the dying fire. I climbed under the covers and wrapped my arms around her quivering naked body. I dimly heard the clock striking four when we finally fell asleep. I was satisfied; it had been a very successful first night together. And over time, I would soothe my little girl&#8217;s fears, and she would learn to find joy in serving me. The next morning, she would shyly offer her mouth to me upon noticing my painful erection. She was already learning; and I would have much more to teach her in the week leading to our departure for India.










Lady Emily&#8217;s Diary

17 May, 18&#8212;

So many strange, terrifying, and wonderful things have happened here at Wainwright Hall these last few days! In my wildest dreams, I never believed that my dear Mr. Singer, my guardian and beloved friend, would also become my master. Since he gave me my first sexual encounter as a birthday gift, he has been leading me down a strange and dark path of pleasure and submission. As terrified as I was at the start (and I will admit, I am still quite afraid), I am excited for what our future together will bring.

Mr. Singer has arranged for us to go away to India for a month-long tour. A friend of his and Father&#8217;s from their South Africa days will host us in Calcutta, and we will use that as our home base as we explore the country hand-in-hand. He says that we will marry during our time there. I have so longed to be a wife, so that I may know the forbidden love between a man and a woman.

I must confess that I carry a heavy burden of guilt in my heart, that I am deflowered before my marriage. My betrothed comforts me; I had not been given a choice. �If your god wishes to judge you for it, you may explain to him that you were forced,� he teased me, and I suppose that it is technically the truth. Oh, I was so afraid when I woke tied to his bed, with him leering hungrily over me. Had he given me the choice, I would have run from there and locked myself in the bedchamber. But I enjoyed it�so much, more than I can attempt to put into words. I find lately that words escape me in describing my emotions in this new situation. I may say that I am terrified and excited, but I do not feel that those words adequately illustrate the feelings that weigh on me. I can scarcely sleep (not that my new master has allowed me to do much of that lately), and every time I think about it, I feel nauseous. 

Mr. Singer is not a religious man, and has never made a point in hiding this fact. I had always attended church services in the village with Nanny every Sunday, but I had always viewed this as an opportunity to socialize with the other young ladies and steal flirtatious glances at my many suitors. I have stopped attending since Nanny&#8217;s departure months ago. I suppose that the teachings of the church have had some effect on me, as a part of me fears that I will burn in hellfire for indulging in these forbidden passions.

But it is not so much that which is bothering me. No; I cannot help but think of how my parents would feel about this situation. My father would most certainly be unhappy; I cannot think how he would approve of my fornicating with a man more than twice my age, his own friend and the man who raised me from the tender age of four. I was so young when I lost Father, but I remember him well. Or perhaps my hazy memories have been supplemented by my good friend, Mr. Singer. I do know that my father was a handsome man, and very intelligent. Mr. Singer has often remarked that I remind him of my father, and I have always taken pride in that fact.

My mother&#8217;s feelings on the situation would be more difficult to guess. She died birthing me. I have never felt guilt about this fact; it is unfortunate, but women die in childbirth quite often, and I had not done anything to cause her harm myself. Terrible circumstances, that is all. Anyway, I never knew her at all, and I don&#8217;t remember much that Father may have told me of her when I was so young. Mr. Singer did not know her very well at all, so he is no help in preserving her memory. I have, however, learned some things about my mother while exploring the house as a child. I will never forget the day that I found that curious, forbidden book among her things in a spare room, off the unoccupied east wing. I was twelve when I found that book, and I read it privately in my room, blushing at the lewd descriptions. I hid the book and referenced it often, when I was alone at night, touching myself under the covers�

I have a strong feeling that my mother would not necessarily disapprove of my activities. If she could enjoy a book so perverted (and it had been well-read, even before I laid my eager hands upon it), then she could certainly understand the desires that it stirred in me. But I did not know that my seemingly innocent little foray into nipple torture would lead to this.

But I have expressed my feelings of guilt, and even now, as I write this, I feel unburdened. I feel much more ready to enjoy the life that Mr. Singer is so graciously offering to me. And every day since the first has been more exciting. It has only been four days since we began our journey (I of course mean this metaphorically; our actual journey will not begin for a few days yet), but I feel as though we have lived this way for years, and we have always been meant to live this way. 

The day after our first encounter, Mr. Singer was gentle with me. He wanted to spend the day getting ahead on his work, closing out some cases, in anticipation of our long excursion. I spent the day alone, catching up on my reading and reflecting on the events of the previous night. We did not meet again until we dined together in the evening. Then, he took me by the hand and led me up to our bedchamber, and gently made love to me for the next couple of hours. Oh, it was heavenly. He restrained me, as he had the previous night, which made it all the more exciting. I&#8217;d had fantasies about being tied up, as I have laid out here in this very diary. But the reality of being completely at another&#8217;s mercy is quite a different thing from the fantasies, and my body shook uncontrollably with fear and anticipation. 

I of course have no basis for comparison, but my dear old friend is an expert lover. He has already brought me to the heights of pleasure countless times. I know that Mr. Singer has spent much time with other women over the years; every few weeks or so, he would stay out so late with one of his �lady friends� that he wouldn&#8217;t return to Wainwright Hall until the early hours of the morning. But he says that he is saving all of his love for me from now on, and that I am his one. I have never felt insignificant in my life; I have always been petted and adored by the people around me, Mr. Singer included. But to know that I am his only love, the object of his strange desires, makes me feel so special. I will give him everything that I have to offer.

I perform fallacio on him willingly. I remember giggling about this lewd act with two of my friends, Miss Tatiana Howard and Miss Victoria Simonson. One of them had read about it in a strange book, and we all laughed and swore that we would never lower ourselves to such a degrading act, never. But I remember thinking, at the time, that I could do that. I would, possibly, to my husband, if he so desired. The idea even made me feel a little hot, so much so that I had to excuse myself from the conversation and find the nearest lavatory. I was so pleased when Mr. Singer allowed me to do it. It was a bit frightening at first; I wondered how I would fit his large cock down my little throat.

But my dear patient friend, he helped me, putting a hand on the back of my head and guiding his cock to my waiting, wide-open mouth. He slowly forced himself deeper and deeper down my throat, and I worked to relax my throat muscles and not gag on him. Eventually, I began to bob my head, wrapping my lips tightly around his shaft and sucking him with enthusiasm. His moaning and the tightening of his hand in my hair assured me that I was doing it right.

The taste of his semen was a shock, but he instructed me to swallow, and I obeyed. On my knees before him, I looked up at him eagerly, and he lightly touched my face. I could see the adoration in his eyes. I know that he loves me. He told me that I was a good girl, his good little whore, before helping me to my feet and allowing me to dress for the day.

Our second day was relatively tame compared to yesterday&#8217;s adventures. I still blush, thinking of how my master degraded me in the horse stables. I did not know his plans when we sat down to breakfast. He declared that it would be a lovely day to take a long ride on the grounds, and I eagerly agreed. After changing into my riding gear (which I would soon find out was unnecessary), I met Mr. Singer down in the stables. I own four fine horses, and they all get frequent use. Though I am a young lady, I do not ride side-saddle daintily unless I am in town amongst many people. With friends, like my dear Mr. Singer, I may ride as I please.

But Mr. Singer had his own intentions in the stable that lovely morning. When I entered, the horses were still waiting in their stalls. He was examining the small collection of whips and riding crops on the far wall. We have them, but we do not use them much. I do not use them at all; my horses respond to gentle handling. The only fall I&#8217;ve ever taken from a horse was not from one of my own; as a matter of fact, it was one of the horses owned by my friend Miss Catherine Gainsley, near two years ago. Not a bad fall, but I swore never to ride any horse but my own ever again.

Mr. Singer turned when he heard me enter the stable. He smiled, and I immediately recognized the wicked glint in his eye. He had plans for me; my eyes fell on the riding crop in his hand. He beckoned to me. �Come here, Emily,� he said with a smirk. 

I had no choice but to slowly walk to the other end of the stable, trembling in anticipation. I have found that I enjoy the physical punishments. I know that most children are punished this way for their childish crimes, but I have not experienced such treatment. I find that it excites me, perhaps even moreso than the sex itself. As I approached Mr. Singer, I eyed him fearfully. He playfully slapped the riding crop against his open palm.

�Lady Emily,� he said, �Take off your clothes. You may leave your boots on, but that is all.�

I nodded and did as my master instructed. I slowly removed my riding dress, and he took it from my hands, draping it carefully over the empty stall. I was not wearing a tight corset that day, just a form-fitting slip, which I handed over as well. This left me in my near-nakedness, except for my brown leather riding boots and my nipple clips. Mr. Singer eyed me with approval, and I blushed. It was certainly one thing to be naked in our bedchamber, but it was yet another to be naked in the stable, with the door wide open. If any of the servants happened along�

�I have a surprise for you, Emily,� Mr. Singer said, and I couldn&#8217;t help smiling. His surprises these last few days have been so wonderful and awful, and yesterday&#8217;s gift in the stable was certainly so. He reached into his pocket, pulling out a short strip of leather. It was fashioned like a small belt, and even had a small brass buckle. Mr. Singer beckoned to me, and I stood before him, holding still as he fastened this homemade collar around my neck, buckling it at my throat. �Not too tight, is it, my dear?�

�No, sir,� I said. I trembled as he ran his hands down my shoulders, staring into my eyes. My nipples hardened, and the pressure against my clips made me moan. I wanted Mr. Singer to grope my chest, and I even pushed my breasts towards him, inviting him. He smiled, but instead reached around the back of my head, untying the haphazard knot that I&#8217;d tied. He let my hair flow down my back. He likes my hair worn loose, and has ordered me not to wear it in tight curls at home any more.

Mr. Singer ran his strong hands through my hair, pulling me to him in a tight embrace. He cupped my chin in his hand and kissed me roughly, his tongue plunging into the depths of my mouth. Before our first night together, the only kiss I&#8217;d given to a man was a small, shy peck on the lips to my former suitor, Mr. Gainsley. We had been walking in his family&#8217;s orchard. He had been talking about something�I don&#8217;t remember what, but I remember that he liked to ramble on about boring topics. I think I kissed him just to shut him up. I stood on my toes and kissed him quickly. We had stared at each other in surprise, and as my cheeks flared up, I turned and ran all the way to Wainwright Hall. I would not receive Mr. Gainsley for another week, and when I finally did, we did not speak of the incident. I was afraid that he would find me too audacious to wed. 

But Mr. Singer encourages audacity, and so I reached for his riding jacket, pulling it down his shoulders before he reached up and seized my wrists. He grinned in my face. �Eager for me, my Emily? Would you like to play a game?�

I nodded, and he instructed me to stand facing the door to the empty horse stall. I did this, and listened to him walk away from me. When he returned, he lashed my wrists to the bars of the stall door. He used a leather strip to restrain me, and it dug into my skin. I still have the ugly marks on my wrists. But that was nothing compared to what the riding crop did. Mr. Singer had dropped it while playing with me. I watched him over my shoulder as he picked it up and stood behind me. �Face forward,� he snapped, and I turned my head, staring into the empty horse stall through the bars. 

Mr. Singer came behind me and whispered, �Open your mouth.� I did, and he shoved his handkerchief in, to muffle my cries that his punishment would certainly elicit. I gasped as Mr. Singer kissed and nibbled on my neck. He has already found the places on my body that are the most sensitive, and he gives them attention whenever he can. I shuddered as he stepped back from me. I felt the tip of the riding crop against my back as he teasingly traced it over my bare skin.

�Spread your legs, Emily,� Mr. Singer instructed, and I did so, without hesitation. �Emily,� he said, continuing to trace the riding crop against me, �Is your little ass feeling all right?�

Truthfully, it had been a little difficult to sit since Mr. Singer&#8217;s rough treatment of me on our first night together.&nbsp; He had left my ass alone since then, but I knew that he wanted to have me again. I was determined to prove to him that I could handle him, so I nodded.

�Good,� he said, and the first blow of the riding crop was delivered to my ass. I didn&#8217;t scream that first time so much as let out a gasp into my gag. But as Mr. Singer continued to rain blows on my ass and back, my groaning turned to dull screams, especially as he quickened the pace. It is difficult to describe, because as badly as the beating hurt, I wanted it. I forced myself to hold still, but I was shaking uncontrollably when Mr. Singer finally tossed aside the riding crop.

He quickly came behind me, pushing me against the stall door. With one hand, he reached around and groped my breasts; with the other, he pulled down his trousers. He forced me to bow my head and bend forward, so that my back was in-line with my restrained wrists. Mr. Singer put his hands on my hips and began to rub his cock against my cunt. I realized then that I was very wet down there; he was using my pussy juices to lubricate his cock for my ass. I held my breath as he took his cock away from me. Then, he shoved himself into my asshole, full hilt. Though he&#8217;d taken me there before, I swore that I could hear the lining of my asshole tearing to accommodate him.

He fucked me quickly. His hands stayed at my hips. I longed for him to stroke and rub my clitoris, but he was waiting to please me. For now, it was about his pleasure. He has explained to me that it may be this way at times. That is what it means for me to be his sex slave; his needs always come first, before my own. I find that I like it this way. I enjoy pleasing this man who has given me so much over the years.

He thrust into me once more as he came, holding himself inside of me as he started to go limp. I groaned, gripping the bars to which I was restrained as he removed himself from me. He stood beside me for a moment, rubbing the cuts and bruises that his beating had left on my back and ass. �Ready to ride?� he asked.

I nodded, and Mr. Singer untied me and removed the gag from my mouth. He kissed me softly. �Go saddle up your horse.�

I reached for my clothing, but Mr. Singer seized my arm. He did not grip me too tightly; besides his rough treatment of me just a few moments ago, he is usually quite gentle. �Did I say that you could put on your clothes?�

�No, sir,� I said, and suddenly realized what he would have me do. I blushed at the idea, even after what he&#8217;d just done to me. �Oh, sir,� I said, �please��

He spanked me once on my bare ass, and I yelped out in pain. �Saddle up now, or you will get another punishment.�

I had no choice. The idea both excited and terrified me. �Yes, sir,� I said helplessly as I went to retrieve my favorite horse, a gorgeous black stallion. As I&#8217;ve written before, I do not name my horses. I don&#8217;t find it necessary to do so; they respond to my touch and to the sound of my voice, not the words spoken. I opened the black stallion&#8217;s stall door and coaxed him to me. 

As I prepared my horse&#8217;s saddle, I wondered how the saddle would feel on my bare, beaten ass. Not pleasant, I knew. But as I mounted my black stallion (after an approving nod from Mr. Singer), I found that if I leaned forward, putting the pressure on my pussy, then I felt better. Much better, in fact.

Mr. Singer had chosen the other stallion, the chestnut. He rode slowly up beside me. �Emily,� he said, �is this not a dream come true for you?�

And so it was. I had forgotten the dream that I&#8217;d had years ago, which I had recorded in this very diary. I dreamed that I was riding naked through the fields, past the villages, just riding on and on. No one was around; it was just me, in my nakedness, and the horse. Mr. Singer confessed to me that he has read this diary, and that he will probably do so again, with my permission or no. He is welcome to it; I will even insert a personal greeting just for him right here. Hello, sir. I hope you enjoy reading my recollections of our lovemaking.

Mr. Singer led the way as we rode from the stable. He had allowed me to place a blanket under my ass, to further ease the pressure there. It could also prove useful on the slim chance that we encountered anyone. I could not recall one time, in all of our years of riding on the grounds of Wainwright Hall, having ever come upon another person. At the very least, I&#8217;d be able to draw the blanket around my nakedness before riding quickly away. I prayed that it would not be necessary, as it would not do much to lessen my humiliation.

We rode slowly at first, as we usually do. We rode silently up the first steep hill, which leads out to a small valley and more hills for several acres. The hills beyond the pond slope gently, creating a pleasant ride. I found that this is especially so when each step of the horse set waves of pleasure through me. Mr. Singer noticed this, and he smiled at me.

�Enjoying your ride, Emily?� he asked.

I nodded. �Yes, sir,� I managed, and I bit back a moan.

Mr. Singer laughed and urged his horse faster. I followed suit and we quickened the pace to a full-out gallop. My breasts bounced freely, the clips pinching my nipples more than ever as the steady motion brought me to an intense climax. I screamed, resisting the urge to pull the reigns. The horse seemed to sense that it was time to slow down, and as he slowed to a gentler speed, I nearly collapsed on top of him.

Mr. Singer, several yards ahead, noticed that I had not kept pace with him. He turned around, and we stopped, meeting at the top of a larger hill overlooking much of the yard. Mr. Singer climbed quickly from his horse, a look of mixed amusement and concern on his face as he helped me (nearly pulled me) from my saddle. I weakly fell into his arms and he swept me up, he was so strong, and held me tight, kissing me.

I will have to continue my narrative at another time; even now, Mr. Singer calls me to his side. We have not played as much today, and I am eager to see what surprises he has in store for me now. 


19 May, 18&#8212;

I&#8217;ve had hardly a spare moment these past couple of days. Between preparing for the trip to India and paying last visits to my friends in the area as a single woman (won&#8217;t they all be surprised when I return as a married woman?), as well as spending time (lots and lots of time) with my dear Mr. Singer, I&#8217;ve hardly had time to even think. But Wainwright Hall is quiet now. Mr. Singer has gone to visit with a client, and now that all of my trunks are packed for the trip, I think this would be a good time to sit quietly and reflect on the last few days.

When I left my previous entry, I was describing my pleasurable ride on the grounds. When Mr. Singer and I stopped, we left the horses to run as they pleased (knowing they would quickly come back when summoned), and Mr. Singer spread the blanket out on the grass. He motioned for me to lie down, and he did, he lying beside me as we touched hands and looked up at the clear blue sky. A light spring breeze was in the air, and I shivered slightly, my nipples hardening again. I felt chilly between my legs, and realized that I was very messy from my climax on the black stallion.

Mr. Singer noticed my trembling, and he removed his riding jacket, wrapping it gently around my shoulders. �Better?� he asked. I nodded, and he kissed my forehead softly. We sat together, and I rested my head on his chest and closed my eyes. I felt wonderful. Mr. Singer ran his fingers softly through my hair. We sat this way for quite some time, enjoying the comfort of each other&#8217;s bodies. As my guardian, Mr. Singer had not doled out much physical affection. This is not so unusual; indeed, it would have been seen as improper if he had given me the hugs and kisses of an affectionate father. But how I craved it as a young girl, ever since he&#8217;d held me in his arms and comforted me after Father&#8217;s death. It is different now. I will get all the love that I need from my dear old friend.

After a time, Mr. Singer whispered in my ear. �I want you, Emily. Lie down.� I slowly but eagerly obeyed. Mr. Singer got up on his knees and smiled down at me as he slowly removed his shirt. I returned his smile, anticipating the pleasure that he would deliver. He did not fully remove his trousers, and he kept his boots on as he straddled my hips. I wrapped my legs around his waist, and as he fucked me, the heels of my riding boots tapped against each other. I rose up on my elbows and raised my hips higher to allow Mr. Singer to fuck me as deep as he could. I wanted to feel him all the way up inside of me.

Mr. Singer grabbed me by the front of the leather collar and pulled my face to his, kissing me roughly as he pounded me. He breathlessly whispered in my ear. �You&#8217;re my whore, aren&#8217;t you, Lady Emily?�

I groaned. �Oh, yes, sir!� I cried.

�Say it, Emily!� he cried, tightening his grip on my collar. I stared into his eyes; he looked crazed and wild, and I feared and adored him.

�I am your whore, sir! Oh, sir!� He released my collar and grabbed me under my knees, forcing me to put my legs straight in the air. It was difficult to hold them up with the heavy boots on, but I spread wide and allowed him to slide between them, fucking me harder and harder, and closer and closer to another climax.

It was almost, though not quite, as intense as the climax on the horse. We came simultaneously; it was beautiful to feel him relax inside of me. He carefully helped me to lower my legs. I felt weak, and I trembled slightly and closed my eyes, laying back and relaxing as Mr. Singer pulled off my boots and gently rubbed my feet. His hands did not travel up any further than my ankles as he worked them, but even that touch made me sigh contentedly. 

When Mr. Singer stopped rubbing my feet, I opened my eyes and gazed up at him. He was kneeling beside my feet, looking back at me with a smile. I always thought he was handsome, but at that moment, he was almost blindingly beautiful to me. It really is no wonder that my good friend Miss Tatiana Howard has been infatuated with him since we were young girls. Even now, the thought of her jealousy upon my return as Lady Emily Singer makes me smile. I am afraid that I am turning into a petty, wicked thing�and worse, I am enjoying it very much.

�Well, my lady,� Mr. Singer said, �are you ready to go home?�

I felt so exhausted. All I wanted to do was collapse onto my bed (or rather, our bed) and sleep the afternoon away. I nodded weakly, and he whistled for the horses while I pulled on my boots. I was still wearing Mr. Singer&#8217;s riding jacket, and he allowed me to keep it on as we traveled slowly back to the stables. I found that the ride back was much more uncomfortable than the ride out, since my pussy had gotten such a workout at that point.

Mr. Singer allowed me to dress while he put the stallions back into their stalls. I realized, as I finished pulling on my dress, that nobody had seen us. I&#8217;d ridden around the grounds naked, and nobody was the wiser. Mr. Singer and I had committed lewd acts, right there in the open, and only God was there to witness, if He cared to do so. The idea made me giggle uncontrollably, and I was in near hysterics by the time an amused Mr. Singer came to my side.

He wrapped his arms around me, and I calmed, my laughter dying down to a girlish giggle as he kissed me softly. �You had lots of fun today, Lady Emily, didn&#8217;t you?�

I nodded. �Oh, yes, sir,� I said, and I knew that the insane grin on my face told him everything that he needed to know.

�Good girl,� Mr. Singer said softly, and he kissed me on the forehead. �Would you like to take a quiet nap before lunch?�

I nodded. By now, I know the difference between a �nap� and a �quiet nap.� A quiet nap is just that, a quiet little afternoon snooze in each other&#8217;s arms. A �nap� is something entirely different, and much resembles the activities we&#8217;d just performed in the field. It&#8217;s hard for me to believe that our affair began less than a week ago; we&#8217;ve already gotten into the habit of �napping� after tea every afternoon, the time that I would normally reserve for receiving gentleman callers.

I told Mr. Gainsley of my betrothal this very afternoon. I would not say to whom, and he was terribly upset. It was quite an ordeal, actually; after explaining to him that I was going to India to make arrangements for my marriage, he nearly flew into a rage. Mr. Gainsley, usually so mild-mannered, stood from his seat and accused me of leaving him on a hook. �I was denied when I first proposed marriage to you, but I had hope that, when your guardian granted you freedom to marry, that you would choose me. I have waited for you, lady, and you care nothing for my feelings.�

I was very upset by then. I truly did not think that Mr. Gainsley would take the news so hard. I felt it only right to tell him, because he has courted me for so long. But since Mr. Singer first denied his request for marriage, his visits to me have been much fewer. I am surprised that he has not yet proposed marriage to Miss Beatrice Howard, whom he has been courting for some months. I told him as much, and he snapped back, �I care nothing for any other girl. I had to pass the time somehow while you�led me on.�

I had dissolved into tears, I am ashamed to say. Mr. Singer came to my rescue; he was preparing to leave for the village, and when he heard Mr. Gainsley&#8217;s shouting and my distress, he came into the parlor. In his calm way, but with anger in his eyes, he ordered Mr. Gainsley out. �You will not speak to the lady of this house in such a impudent manner. Especially after she has confided information to you, as a friend. Leave here now; do not return, or you will meet with the end of my revolver.�

Mr. Gainsley did not dare challenge my brave Mr. Singer, and with one last, contemptuous glance in my direction, he left Wainwright Hall. Undoubtedly, he will tell his sister all about the incident. Fortunately, the information will be delayed, as she is away visiting relatives in the south. I do not think he would risk hurting his pride by announcing it to anyone else. By the time the news gets around that I am betrothed to a mysterious man, we will be well on our way. 

Mr. Singer kissed me softly before departing to town. �You&#8217;re not upset, are you, my dear?� He always cares for me so. I assured him that I was all right. I was shook up by the confrontation, but otherwise, my feelings were intact. And so, Mr. Singer departed.

I am planning a surprise for him this evening. Rarely do I spend time in the kitchen, as we&#8217;ve always had a cook on hand, but when I was young, my nanny taught me how to make the most sumptuous tipsy laird, a Scottish variety of trifle. My nanny is Scottish, and I think of her now, far off in the Highlands, tending to her ailing sister. I do not know how I will break the news to her that I am going to marry Mr. Singer. I will wait to write to her upon our return from India, but I do not know what she will make of the situation. The odds are against my ever seeing her sweet old face again, anyway, but still, I do not want her to remember me ill.

But I will not worry. I will be happy in my newfound love. I cannot believe that, in just a few short days, I will be on my way to India, and on my way to becoming Lady Singer. My heart races just thinking of it.


22 May, 18&#8212;

We depart for India on the morrow. Mr. Singer and I came by train to London this very afternoon, and are only staying the night at the home of an old friend. We will set sail very early. I have been on ships for several weeks at a time, our longest trip being to America some years ago, but I am nervous. I don&#8217;t believe that it is the possibility of seasickness that worries me, but rather what awaits us in this mysterious land.

Mr. Singer knows that I am anxious, and he attends to me with kind patience. Our sleeping arrangements are separate tonight; our host, of course, does not know the nature of our relationship. But Mr. Singer has assured me that he will creep to my bedside in the night, and will hold me gently and listen to all of my concerns. He constantly reassures me that what we are doing is right. I am ashamed that he knows that I still have my thoughts of doubt, try as I might to hide these from him. But he knows me so well. He knows what is in my heart.

At times I feel that I may burst with love for him. Oh, my Mr. Singer is such a goodly, handsome, wonderful man, and I fear that I am not worthy of his worshipful love. I try so very hard to please him. Last night, after he finished tying me down and having his way with me for a time, I couldn&#8217;t stop crying, and I had no answers to his questions of why. I still am not certain of the cause of my outburst; my emotions are out of control as of late. I am usually a very controlled person, so this frightens me more than anything else. But around others, such as our host here in London, I am myself, smiling and polite and occasionally witty. It comforts me to know that I may show my true feelings to Mr. Singer. Even if we don&#8217;t understand them, he does not judge me harshly. He is still my friend.

I am exhausted, so I will leave this tonight. When I write again, we will be on the ship and on our way to India. Perhaps by then, the excitement of our adventure will overtake my apprehensions.

My Mr. Singer is at the door! Out with the light, and into bed we go. 


30 May, 18&#8212;

My head still spins with the events of last night, of the past week! My dear Mr. Singer is a wicked and wonderful man, and under his influence, I have done things that only a fortnight ago, would have made me dissolve into screams of horror. I do love him so, for he challenges me and gives me the wildest and most wonderful pleasure. I tremble now to think of it all.

I will come to the events of last night in a moment. Our first few days on board were not out of the ordinary, but were wonderful in themselves. We are onboard a small passenger vessel; there are perhaps 150 on board, not including the crew and the captain (oh, that wicked Captain! On that in a moment). Mr. Singer and I technically have separate quarters, but he does not fail to come to me in the night. His room is a decoy, really, as it would be most improper for an unmarried man and woman to share a room. During those first few days onboard, when we would sit amongst the other wealthy passengers at dinner, Mr. Singer would give me the most secretive, dirty little glances, enough to make me blush and giggle briefly behind my napkin. 

We do not know anyone on board, but Mr. Singer has quickly become a favorite among the ladies, married and single alike. It has always been this way; Mr. Singer is so handsome and charming, yet he does not become inflated with the praise as a lesser man might. I remember feeling a little jealous before, when I would see him flirt mildly with a lady at one of our neighbor&#8217;s balls. But it does not bother me now to see him talking with other women; indeed, it is all the better, as I know that I am the only one who belongs to him.

Last night, we had the honor of dining at the Captain&#8217;s table. The Captain (whose name, for reasons that will soon be obvious, I do not wish to commit to paper) is a young man, perhaps even a bit younger than Mr. Singer himself. He is Portuguese, but his English is very good. I was seated right beside him, and I could not help but notice how handsome he was. He is tall, like my Mr. Singer, but has a more solid, wide build. He has a lovely dark complexion�oh, goodness! I blush to think of him.

He regaled our small party with stories of trips he&#8217;d made all over the world. All the while, he would specifically address me, giving me flirtacious glances, and at one point, he reached over and lightly brushed my hand. I am no stranger to the advances of men; if you ask my dear Mr. Singer, I am the most beautiful girl in the world. I am not so convinced of that, but I know I am pretty. I am not blind. 

I cannot help myself; I do so enjoy the attention of men. I returned his attentions, but glanced frequently at Mr. Singer. He was attending to the lady beside him, and when our eyes met, he gave him a little wink and a nod. He approved of my accepting the attentions of the handsome Captain. And so I fully enjoyed what I had thought would be an innocent flirtation. 

After dinner, the other ladies and the older gentleman in our party departed for their rooms. The Captain invited Mr. Singer and me back to his private chambers for a nightcap. I was surprised by the invitation; it is not customary for women to enjoy a drink after dinner with the men (though Mr. Singer and I had always done that, well before we were lovers). I looked at my master nervously, but he was nodding his head. �I&#8217;m game,� he said. �What say you, Lady Emily?�

�All right,� I said. I smiled at the Captain. �Thank you.� 

He took us to his large chambers. His bedroom was separate from his sitting room, and that is where we sat, in high-backed chairs, enjoying coffee mixed with whiskey and cream, a drink that the Captain had been introduced to in Ireland.

�Lady Emily has done quite a bit of traveling herself,� Mr. Singer said. I gave him a look of surprise; it was almost as though he were trying to set me up with the Captain! He had a wicked glint in his eye, a look that, by now, I am very familiar with. What was he up to?

But the Captain began to question me with earnest, and I told him about the excursions that Mr. Singer and I had made to various points in the world. �I have never been to Asia before,� I admitted.

�This will be my third voyage to India,� the Captain said. �There is much profit to be made these days. This will be my last voyage as captain of this passenger vessel. I have been appointed to a trade ship.�

�Which do you prefer?� I asked. And the Captain and I talked on for nearly a half hour. I had almost forgotten that Mr. Singer was in the room, until he cut in. And his comment was most unexpected.

�Captain,� he said, �I do believe that you are attracted to Lady Emily.�

I nearly gasped. I glanced at the Captain, but he did not look at all fazed. He even laughed a little. �I can&#8217;t deny that,� he said. He gave me a familiar look, a look of longing. I had seen that look more than once, and on more than one man. �She is not only beautiful, but intelligent and fun.�

�She certainly is,� Mr. Singer agreed. �She is a lot of fun.�

I sat in shocked silence as Mr. Singer revealed our secret to the Captain. �Lady Emily is my whore, Captain. She does anything that I ask her to. Isn&#8217;t that right, my dear?�

I swallowed quickly. �Yes, sir,� I said quietly. Mr. Singer grinned.

�Captain,� he went on, �You are an attractive man yourself. I&#8217;m sure that you&#8217;ve had a few romps with some female passengers.�

�Well,� the Captain admitted, �Not as often as you might think. Many of the ladies on these voyages are stuck-up and pampered.�

�Lady Emily is pampered, to be sure, but she is anything but stuck-up,� Mr. Singer said proudly, and I could not help smiling at that, as mortified as I was. �Captain,� he said, �you have been very kind to us since we arrived on this ship. And I can tell that my Lady Emily, as devoted as she is to me, is quite taken with you as well. Isn&#8217;t that true, my lady?�

I had to confess; I had no choice. �Yes, sir,� I said, my voice faltering.

�Captain,� Mr. Singer said, �I would like to properly thank you by offering my whore to you for use. What would you like to do to this pretty young lady?�

I looked at the Captain as he eyed me. He looked both lustful and contemplative. �Would she�would she suck my cock?� he asked, addressing the question to my master, as was appropriate.

Mr. Singer nodded. �Certainly. Lady Emily, stand up and remove your clothes, please.�

I did so; the thought never even occurred to me to resist. I looked at the Captain as I removed my evening gown. When I was down to my corset, I turned around. �Will you give me a hand, please?� I asked. As the Captain awkwardly untied my corset, Mr. Singer gave me a smile of approval. 

Completely naked (save for my nipple clips, which the Captain eyed with curiosity), I stood before the Captain. I wasn&#8217;t certain what he would have me do next. Did he want me to remove his clothes? Get right down to it?

He looked a bit uncertain himself, until Mr. Singer resolved the issue. �She can take a little rough handling, Captain, but do not be brutal to her.�

The Captain nodded and advanced towards me, an eager look in his eyes and a grin on his face. He seized my shoulders and forced me to my knees. He pulled down his trousers, only enough to reveal his huge, stiff cock. Oh, God! He was even bigger than my Mr. Singer. The Captain seized the back of my head, and I knew what to do. I quickly swallowed his engorged member, deep-throating him with only a little difficulty. He fucked my mouth quickly, but I&#8217;d had enough practice with Mr. Singer at that point that I knew how to breathe properly. As he fucked me, he moaned in ecstasy; it had been a long time since he&#8217;d had it like this. As apprehensive as I&#8217;d been about my task, I felt good, knowing that I was giving the Captain this pleasure.

The Captain did not hold out as long as Mr. Singer, and he gripped my hair harder and grunted as he came. I swallowed him with his member still lodged down my throat; this was a trick I&#8217;d perfected with Mr. Singer, and the Captain moaned one last time, stroking my hair as he removed himself from me. He looked down at me, looking surprised and grateful for what had just happened.

�Thank you, my lady,� he managed. He helped me to my feet.

�You&#8217;re welcome, Captain,� I said. He leaned in and kissed me roughly, grabbing my face in his hands. I did not stop him; I leaned in to his kiss. His tongue was a little too active for my taste, probing my mouth intrusively.

I felt a pair of hands on my waist; Mr. Singer had come up behind me. As the Captain kissed my mouth, Mr. Singer kissed the back of my neck, left exposed by my elegant hairdo. He briefly addressed the Captain as he gave my neck some attention with his teeth. �Captain, you may have her ass while I take her cunt. You game?�

The Captain responded by grabbing my hand and leading us into his bedchamber. His bed was quite large. He grabbed my other arm and threw me on the bed roughly. 

Almost in an instant, he and Mr. Singer were on me. I did not know how to position myself to accommodate both gentlemen, but they resolved this for me by putting me on my side. Mr. Singer positioned himself to face me. �You&#8217;ll need lubricant, Captain,� he said. He addressed me next; �Spread wide, Lady Emily.�

The Captain seemed to be prepared for an impromptu sexual encounter, because he had a jar of lotion in his bedside drawer. He lubed up quickly, and positioned himself behind me. The men entered me simultaneously; I yelled out in pain before Mr. Singer put his mouth on mine, kissing me roughly.

The Captain&#8217;s huge cock tore up my ass; it is still in pain as I write this, laying on my stomach on my bed. I have not sat down all day; I don&#8217;t know how I will get through dinner tonight. To muffle my moans of pain and pleasure, Mr. Singer pushed my head against his shoulder, allowing me to scream against him. Oh, God, that Captain was very rough with me. He had seen the bruises on my back, and he knew what kind of treatment I was accustomed to. He came only moments before Mr. Singer and I; for a few moments, the three of us lay in our cum-soaked mess, sweating and panting. Mr. Singer reached for me, kissing me softly, and the Captain reached over and played with my nipples, fascinated with the metal clips.

Mr. Singer and I departed soon after. The Captain kissed me once more after I&#8217;d dressed. �We will have to do this again, very soon,� he said to me and Mr. Singer, as though we&#8217;d just enjoyed an evening of cigars and drinks, nothing more.

�That would be nice,� Mr. Singer said.

�Yes,� I agreed. �Goodnight, Captain.�

Because it was so late, and the only passengers still up and awake would be too drunk to notice us, we walked hand-in-hand back to my room. We said nothing, though, until we were in my room, with the door closed. Mr. Singer pushed me against the door and kissed me roughly. But as I thought he would reach for my dress to rip it off, he stopped and stepped back. �Did you enjoy yourself this evening, Emily?�

I must confess, I did not know what to say. I felt my face flush, as though I&#8217;d only suddenly realized what had happened. �Yes, sir,� I had to admit, but I was burning with humiliation.

Mr. Singer smiled. �You are an adventurous little whore, Emily. I like that. It turns me on to see you with another man.�

I had figured this much, but hearing him say so was still surprising. �Really, sir?�

He nodded. �You&#8217;re a very special girl, Emily. You enjoyed giving the Captain pleasure, didn&#8217;t you?� I nodded; goodness, it was as though he had read my mind! Mr. Singer smiled. �From now on, you may give pleasure to any man that you please�with my approval, and while I am present, of course. I will protect you from harm, and we&#8217;ll all get to enjoy ourselves.�

I nodded, not certain of what to say. My master would offer me to other men? The possibilities were nearly unimaginable; it frightened and thrilled me. �And,� Mr. Singer added, that wicked grin on his face, �Perhaps we might invite women to join as well.�

I giggled at the idea, and instantly, one woman came to mind. My very good friend, Miss Tatiana Howard. I&#8217;ve always thought she was so beautiful, and she was very attracted to Mr. Singer. It had also been rumored that she had had a brief affair with a young gentleman in London; though she had denied it publicly, she had confessed it to me in confidence. If any woman I knew would be willing to join us in our bedchamber, it would be my whorish friend.

The rest of our voyage will be very exciting. Though I don&#8217;t see any other men on board who would be much fun to play with, I know that my Mr. Singer and the Captain will keep me plenty busy. For now, though, I will enjoy my quiet time alone. I am quite exhausted from last night, and I want to be well-rested for the next time my master and I meet with our new friend.


1 July, 18 &#8211;

I have neglected my writing this past month, but I have been as busy as I previously predicted. My days and nights have been spent serving Mr. Singer and the Captain, ensuring that both men are fully satisfied at all times. They are never shy about returning the favor; however, Mr. Singer does not allow the Captain to have me in my pussy. �This little whore is to be my wife, and her cunt is my property,� he explained to our friend. Still, the Captain adores my ass. He has become fond of spanking me, while Mr. Singer watches. He has a heavier hand than my master, leaving me sore for days on end after a night together.

But now, my mind is preoccupied. We will be in Calcutta the day after tomorrow, and I am very excited to begin the next part of our journey! Mr. Singer has told me a little of his old friend, our host. Mr. Charles Morrison works for the British government. He and his young wife live on a large estate. As I previously noted, Mr. Morrison knew my father. But Mr. Singer recently revealed to me that he also knew my mother. In fact, �he knew her very well,� Mr. Singer said, with a wicked look in his eyes. I am eager to know exactly what he means. 

This morning, Mr. Singer and I sat down with a large map of India. He pointed to all of the places where we would travel. He has been eager to travel to India himself, and I am so honored to be taking this trip with him. He is especially eager to view the Buddhist temples; though he is not a religious man, he has a fascination with religions of the world, particular the eastern ones. His excitement is contagious, and I cannot wait to see all of these exciting things with him.

Tomorrow night, there will be a feast at dinner. I know that the Captain will host Mr. Singer and me in his chambers when the party is over. I am surprised that the other people on the ship do not even seem to suspect our activities; indeed, the other women (most of them older, and, as the Captain observed, snobbish) are impressed that I am such a frequent guest at his table. I fabricated a tale, that he and my father had served in the naval forces together. It makes me laugh to think of it; I do not know these people, and whether or not I encounter them again is of no consequence.

I will probably never see the Captain again, either, but I do not leave our voyage with any regrets. We have had our fun with him, but I will always have my Mr. Singer. I will confess, I have fantasized about being with him and a lovely Indian woman. I believe that Indian women are some of the most beautiful in the entire world, and if I am able to strike a friendship with a woman there, I may be bold enough to invite her to our bedchamber. Mr. Singer would be so pleased.

I think about my life two short months ago. I was a virgin then; though I was not innocent, I could not imagine that I would ever do the things that I have done. I find that my shame is leaving me; I no longer blush so easily when I stand naked before a man. I can hear Mr. Singer&#8217;s dirty remarks to me, and can answer him in kind. I am finding that my Mr. Singer is right: I am a whore, and I love it. 

I will rest tonight, to be fully prepared for a full night with the Captain and Mr. Singer tomorrow. The day after that, we will be in India�and my new life will really begin.











Mr. Singer

As I sat on her bed and watched her finish packing her last trunk, I observed a change in my Lady Emily. She has always been lovely, but right then, after several thrilling weeks together on the voyage to India, she looked radiant. She carried herself differently; she&#8217;d always walked with confidence and grace, but now she almost seemed to float. She smiled so easily�but hadn&#8217;t she always done so? And yet, a difference. She was more beautiful than ever.

She caught me staring at her, and turned to me with a smile. �I&#8217;m all ready, sir,� she declared, closing her trunk with a little difficulty. She looked elegant that morning, wearing a dark green velvet traveling dress and a matching hat. She was always an exquisite, fashionable young lady.

I smiled and took the trunk to load on the trolley. �Would you like to go and say goodbye to our friend the Captain?� I asked. I had not planned on sharing her with the Captain, or with any other man. But as I&#8217;d watched her flirt lightly with him, I had not been able to resist. I don&#8217;t know why, but it thrilled me to see her pleasing another man. 

Perhaps the idea had been put into my head by my friend Morrison, our host in Calcutta. Months before, even before Emily knew my plans for her, I had written to him, informing him that I would be bringing Lady Emily Wainwright to India and we would be wed. My friend had written back, and had mentioned that as much as he looked forward to seeing me again after all these years, he was especially eager to meet the young lady. He had written, in some detail, of how he had known Emily&#8217;s mother very well. I knew that my Emily would be surprised to learn all of this, and I decided to wait to inform her of this until she&#8217;d gotten to know Morrison and his wife a little better.

We only spent a few minutes saying goodbye to the Captain. I watched my Emily please him with her mouth once more. After they kissed goodbye, I caught a glimpse of the Captain&#8217;s face. He looked quite sad; he knew that he would never be with a woman as beautiful, adventurous or as sweet as my Lady Emily ever again. I shook his hand, and my beloved and I departed.

On the crowded piers of Calcutta, I held tight to Emily&#8217;s gloved hand and led her through the crowds of passengers, servants, traders, and sailors. I glanced at her, and she was looking around in awe at the sights. I had been planning an excursion to India long before I&#8217;d planned to make her mine, and I could scarcely hide my excitement myself. My father, Avery Singer III (my elder brother, who was Avery the IV, had died in boyhood), had left for India when I was a boy in school. He would write me letters and send postcards and fascinating gifts from the strange foreign land, and I had always imagined going there and joining him.

It was not meant to be. While in South Africa as a young man, making my considerable fortune with Sir Peter and Mr. Morrison by my side, I received word that my father had died in Bangalore. He had been buried with honor but in haste, and I was of course unable to attend services. I would be visiting my father&#8217;s gravesite for the very first time, with my sweet Lady Emily by my side. 

As we made our way to the street, I quickly spotted my old friend Morrison among the sailors and Indian people. He stood up straight, a shock of thick red hair neatly slicked back on his head. He had a small red beard, in the same style that he had worn it in when we were but young men. He was smiling at us, and he approached quickly, his eyes on the pretty young lady.

�The Lady Emily Wainwright,� he said. �I would know you anywhere; you look very much like your dear mother Lady Anne, God rest her soul.�

Lady Emily offered her hand, and Morrison stooped to kiss it. I held back a laugh; he was certainly eager for her. And I could not blame him. Emily blushed prettily and said, �I am pleased to meet you, Mr. Morrison. Mr. Singer tells me that you knew both of my parents. I should very much like to hear all of your memories of them.� I had to laugh a little then; my little whore was curious to hear about Mr. Morrison&#8217;s past relations with her mother, which I had hinted subtly at just days before.

�And so you shall,� Morrison said, and Emily smiled. My friend turned his attention to me, and gave me a hearty handshake. Morrison is a strong man, stocky and wide. He had hardly changed since our days in South Africa; he was still the loud, good-humored man that I&#8217;d shared many a pint with.

Morrison led us to his waiting carriage. �My wife is waiting for our arrival, so we best not keep her long,� he said. As we rode away from the piers and toward his estate, he asked about our voyage. I looked out of the carriage and watched the people as we rode along, allowing Emily to take the conversation. She gladly did so, telling Morrison that our voyage had been pleasant.

�How long have you lived in Calcutta, Mr. Morrison?� Emily asked politely. I smiled to myself, half-listening to their conversation as I stared in fascination at the streets of Calcutta. Emily would leave her own questions for later; she knew how to charm people, men and women alike, simply by asking them genuine questions and showing a sincere interest. And Morrison, an attention-grabber himself, would play right into her hands.

�Near a decade now,� he said. �I came after some of the violence had died down. Things have been fairly peaceful here since then. I cannot imagine myself living anywhere else.�

�Did you meet your wife here?� Emily asked.

�No,� Morrison answered, �she is from my home village. As a matter of fact, Lady Emily, she knew your mother as well.�

�Did she?� Emily asked, unable to hide her excitement.

Morrison nodded. �They were good friends. Like sisters when they were growing up. In fact, Lady Emily, I am the one who introduced your parents. Your father came to stay with me for a few months after your grandmother died, and they fell in love when I introduced them.�

�Oh!� Emily said in surprise. �Why, I thank you for doing so. I suppose I may owe my existence to you.�

Morrison laughed loudly. He clearly liked my Emily very much. I smiled again and turned back to them as Morrison said, �My Lydia�Mrs. Morrison�is very much looking forward to meeting you. Do you know, in all of my years of correspondence with your Mr. Singer, she always bade me to enquire of you. I do wonder why she did not just write to you herself.�

�I would have been happy to receive it,� Emily said. �I do hope that she and I will become good friends as well.�

�I believe you will,� Morrison said, and he and I exchanged a knowing glance. We had some wonderful, awful plans for both of our ladies. 

We arrived at the lovely manor. It was a fairly new house, built to Morrison&#8217;s own specifications just a few years before, after he had married and brought his wife back with him. The manor was surrounded by a high brick wall, and the attached wrought iron fence opened to allow our carriage to enter. The front grounds were filled with exotic flowers, and I could tell that Emily was as fascinated as I was by all the strange beauty.

Mrs. Morrison, a small woman with very pale skin and very pale hair (which made her blue eyes all the more shockingly bright), met us at the front doors. She was dressed in a light-colored dress and a wide-brimmed hat. �Hello!� she called enthusiastically. Though I knew she was hardly younger than her husband or I, she looked to be nearly as young as my Lady Emily.

The carriage driver helped Lady Emily from the carriage first. Mrs. Morrison dashed over to her, and wrapped her in a tight embrace. �My dear Lady Emily,� she cried (as small and fragile-looking as she was, she was just as loud as her husband). �Oh, you look so much like your mother. Doesn&#8217;t she, Mr. Morrison?�

�That&#8217;s just what I said, Mrs. Morrison,� her husband said, coming out of the carriage. I followed and we stood beside the ladies. Emily looked surprised by Mrs. Morrison&#8217;s immediate affection, but she was smiling broadly.

�Yes,� she said, �Mr. Morrison says that you and my mother grew up together.�

�We did!� Mrs. Morrison said. �We were the best of friends in girlhood. Anne was so much fun, such an adventurous and imaginative girl. We started to grow apart as we grew older, but I was heartbroken when I heard of her death, I really was. Oh, you poor child!� Mrs. Morrison declared.

Emily looked a little uncomfortable. I stood by her side as she said, �I look forward to learning more about my mother. Mr. Singer has been able to tell me about my father, but my mother feels like a stranger to me. She did not grow up near Wainwright Hall.�

�We had some wild times as girls!� Mrs. Morrison laughed. She took Emily gently by the arm. �Come in to the house, come in, please.� She hurried away with Emily.

Mr. Morrison shook his head after his wife. �I bring my old friend for a visit, and she ignores you. I apologize for her.�

�Unnecessary,� I said with an amused smile. �Lady Emily has that effect on people sometimes.�

�She is something, isn&#8217;t she?� Morrison asked, as we slowly followed the women inside.

I nodded. �She&#8217;s very special.�

�I don&#8217;t blame you for taking claim of her,� Morrison said in a low voice. �If I were in your position, I certainly would have done the same. She&#8217;s a beauty.�

�She&#8217;s very precious to me,� I said. �As she grew up, I treated her the way that I thought our friend, Sir Peter, would treat her.�

Morrison laughed. �I guess that&#8217;s gone out the window! Sir Peter had some wild ways about him at times, but not like this!� And we both laughed together. It was certainly true; my transition from viewing Emily as my goddaughter to seeing her as my lover had been swift. 

Morrison and I didn&#8217;t say anything more, for fear of Lady Emily hearing of our plans. It seemed to me that Mrs. Morrison had some designs of her own, as she kept the young lady occupied all afternoon. I did not see my young lady again until we all met for dinner in the large dining hall. A traditional Indian feast was served. Emily and I had tried some Indian food once in London, and I remembered some of the strange dishes described in my father&#8217;s correspondence. But we both marveled at the unfamiliar, strong-smelling spread laid before us.

�Our cook is incredible,� Mrs. Morrison said as she heaped some rice onto Lady Emily&#8217;s plate. �He is Indian himself, but he has spent some time in Liverpool, so when we are homesick, he can make anything that might ease the ache.�

�Do you often miss England?� Emily asked kindly.

Morrison answered for his wife. �We are not able to get home as often as we might like�only once since we wed, isn&#8217;t that so, Mrs. Morrison?�

With a sigh his wife answered, �Oh, yes. But we do keep ourselves occupied. Mr. Morrison is very busy with government affairs, you know, la-di-da, and I have my companions among the ambassadors&#8217; wives and traders&#8217; wives and such.� She turned to Emily, her blue eyes nearly ablaze. �Oh, I cannot wait for you to meet the other ladies at the party we&#8217;re throwing Saturday night.�

�A party?� Emily asked with great interest. I smiled at her; Emily loved nothing better than a party.

�Oh, yes,� Mrs. Morrison said. �In honor of you and Mr. Singer&#8217;s arrival. You know, we have never had family nor friends from home visit us here before, not in seven years, and we are so honored.� Mrs. Morrison took my Emily suddenly by the hand. �I have wanted to meet you. I&#8217;m so very glad you are here.�

I felt a very strong twinge at my crotch. Goodness, this was all going to turn out much better than expected. Morrison stood and loudly proposed a toast to myself and Lady Emily, and we all drank our home-brewed hadia and enjoyed the rest of our dinner.

Emily and I said goodnight immediately after dinner, and went to the guest bedchamber set aside for us. We did not have to worry about separate arrangements; the Morrisons both knew that we were betrothed, and we did not intend to go through the charade of having separate rooms, only to end up in bed together, anyway. Poor Emily was exhausted, having spent the day with the fast-paced Mrs. Morrison. Emily collapsed, clothed, onto the bed, and I sat beside her.

�Tell me honestly,� I said. �What do you think of Mr. Morrison?�

Emily sat up and smiled. �He&#8217;s very nice,� she said. �He has a sense of humor. I feel quite at ease around him.�

I nodded in agreement. �Your father and I met him on our way to South Africa, and by the time we made it to Johannesburg, we were all the best of friends. He has that way about him. Well,� I added, �What are your impressions of Mrs. Morrison?�

Emily giggled. �She is very energetic. Very talkative.�

�That is so.�

�I thought her to be somewhat glib, but I like her,� Emily concluded. �She is so friendly. She has been so welcoming to me all afternoon.�

�She likes you,� I said mildly, and decided to leave it at that for the time being.

Emily looked thoughtful for a moment. �They have only been married these seven years,� she said.

I nodded. �Yes. From what I understand, they had been &#8216;nearly&#8217; betrothed when Morrison left for South Africa years ago. Something prevented their marriage, and she wed another. She was widowed when he was home for a visit from his station here, and they married and returned together.�

Emily sighed. �That is romantic,� she declared. �Long-lost lovers. But I do wonder what prevented them from marrying the first time.�

I could not resist. �I will tell you,� I said. �It was your mother.�

Her shocked face amused me. How I love to surprise her. �My mother?�

�Yes,� I said. �Though I am sketchy on the details. You may want to ask them about it yourself; I&#8217;m sure that they would be most candid with you.�

�I believe I shall,� Emily said faintly, and nothing more was said on the topic that night. It would trouble my dear Lady Emily&#8217;s mind, but she would have all of her answers soon.

As we were both tired from our long day, we fell asleep without our usual nightly lovemaking. All the better; just as I had plans for my beloved, I knew that Mr. and Mrs. Morrison had their own respective plans for my sweet little whore. She would certainly need all of her rest.


The party, thrown in honor of myself and Lady Emily (moreso for her, really), was two nights after our arrival in Calcutta. In that time, Mrs. Morrison had invaded Emily&#8217;s wardrobe, and had lightly upbraided me for not ensuring that my beloved was properly clothed for tropical climates. �But,� Mrs. Morrison trilled, �all the more reason to shop!� Emily was eagerly indoctrinated into the world of Calcutta fashion among the females of British society, and by Saturday she was well-equipped with dresses of light-colored cotton and a couple of gowns (which I felt were unnecessary, until Mrs. Morrison explained that her husband was footing the bill).

In the privacy of our bedchamber, Emily put on one of her new gowns, a rose-colored off-the-shoulder number that fitted well around her perky little tits and flowed away from her hips and legs. When she came to help me knot my necktie, I put my hands lightly on her waist and was surprised by the absence of whalebone. �Mrs. Morrison said that it is not fashionable to wear corsets here,� Emily said simply. I approved of this immensely. Emily&#8217;s slim little body would be that much easier to access. Of course, that would wait until after the official party ended and the real party began.

�I have a surprise for you,� I said, and Emily beamed with pleasure as I took a rectangular gift box from my pocket. �Open it,� I whispered.

With trembling hands, she opened the top of the box, revealing a diamond choker. �Oh, sir,� she sighed. �It&#8217;s extravagant.�

�It would not be proper for you to wear your leather collar at all times,� I remarked, reaching from behind her and taking the diamond choker. As I clasped it around her neck, I said, �I think this is a lovely substitute, don&#8217;t you?� It fit just right, snug against her neck, but not too tight. Only the clasp (which contained a tiny hidden lock, which I had had specially made) would leave a small imprint on her skin after a night of use.

Emily turned to face me, smiling in her radiant way. �Thank you, sir,� she whispered, standing on her toes to kiss me softly. 

I resisted the sudden but strong urge to throw her to the bed. I returned her sweet kiss. My lovely Emily, my good little girl, my obedient whore. How I adored her.

It should be understood that if my dear Lady Emily had not wanted to do the things that I forced her to do, I would not have been leading her down that path. If she had said �no,� we would have stopped. Granted, I had raped her on our first night together, but that had been necessary. Even then I&#8217;d known that she wanted it. 

�Emily,� I said, �You do enjoy belonging to me, don&#8217;t you, my dear?�

�Oh, yes, sir,� she said eagerly. �I love you very much, sir.�

I kissed her again. �I love you, too, my Emily. I cannot wait until you are my wife.�

We went downstairs before we could become swept up in our passions. We found our host and hostess at the foot of the staircase, in a prime spot to greet guests while awaiting our arrival. When the Morrisons spotted us, Mrs. Morrison came and took Emily by the arm. �My dear Lady Emily, you look so beautiful tonight.� Mrs. Morrison looked lovely herself, in a blue gown that matched her bright eyes.

Mrs. Morrison immediately led Emily to a small group of her lady friends. I would not see her again for a couple of hours, as Morrison led me to a group of gentlemen, and we took our places at a large table on the patio to puff on our cigars and a large hookah set up in the middle of the table. We talked of politics in India and at home, trade prices and taxes and laws (where I could, at least, offer my expertise), while drinking strong Indian beer and wine. I was feeling a little tipsy when my Emily joined us briefly.

�Ooh, is that a hookah?� she asked, eyeing the contraption with curiosity.

�Here, my lady,� Morrison, red-faced with drink, said, offering his hose. �Take a puff.�

She took a small pull through her hose, only enough to make the water in the hookah bubble briefly. She let out her smoke slowly before smacking her lips, a quizzical look on her face. �It tastes like shoe leather,� she observed.

The men all laughed heartily, and I beamed at her. Such a charming little thing. �How are you enjoying the party, Lady Emily?� I asked.

�Oh, I&#8217;m having a lovely time. Everyone has been so kind.�

�Would you like to join us, my lady?� Morrison asked. A couple of our companions even stood to offer their seats.

�No, thank you, gentlemen,� Emily said, and I could read disappointment on the faces of the men in attendance. �Mrs. Morrison believes I&#8217;ve only slipped away for another drink, and I&#8217;m sure she is expecting me.� She gave me a little wink before strutting away.

I had the attention of every man at the table. �You are betrothed to her?� One of the government officials, a fat gentleman named Albert Norman, ventured to ask. �She seems quite young.�

�She is 18,� I said proudly. �I raised her up by hand when she was orphaned as a young girl, and we have fallen in love.�

This story spread quickly through the party. The women in attendance thought it sweet; the men were clearly jealous as they compared their own wives (most of them withering, even just at the edges) to my fresh flower of a bride-to-be. If these men had known the truth, they would have positively burst with envy�and would have clamored for a chance with her. But I would not offer her to just anyone.

The party finally died down after midnight. The four of us all convened on the patio when the last of the guests had departed. The ladies were wrapped in shawls as we took a drink together in the cool night air.

�Lady Emily,� Mrs. Morrison said, �We have some topics to discuss with you.�

�About my mother?� Emily asked softly. She had confessed to me that she had not yet questioned Mrs. Morrison. She would have all of her inquiries answered now, for better or for worse.

Mrs. Morrison nodded. �Yes, my dear. You see, Lady Emily, Mr. Morrison has given me some interesting information about the nature of your relationship with Mr. Singer.�

Though her face flushed slightly, my Emily did not seem too surprised. �Oh,� she said. I took her hand as Mrs. Morrison continued.

�Lady Emily, you know that your mother and I were quite close. But I would not say that we were as close as sisters. No,� Mrs. Morrison said, �It would be more accurate to say that we were more like�lovers.�

My sweet Emily was certainly shocked now. �You and my mother?� she asked.

Mrs. Morrison nodded. As her husband sat close to her and put his arm around her shoulders, she explained. Even as young girls, little Lydia and Anne would secretly play their �tie-me-up� game. One girl would be tied up while the other girl tickled and touched and tormented her. The game grew more sexual in nature as the girls grew older, with Anne more often playing the �prisoner� while Lydia played the �mistress.�

Both girls, being pretty enough and from wealthy families, became swept up in the rituals of courting. Mr. Morrison, prior to his excursion to South Africa, had been a favorite suitor of young Lydia. �But he knew Anne for what she was,� Mrs. Morrison said. �A whore. I do not mean that in a bad way,� she added hastily, for fear of offending my dear whore. �Bu they began having an affair. I adored them both�but I was young, I was confused.

�When Charles�Mr. Morrison�left for South Africa, I married my first husband and ceased my friendship with Anne.� Mrs. Morrison went on with teary eyes. �I was much too young to marry. But I was frightened, because I did not think that my feelings for your mother were natural.

�When my first husband died and Mr. Morrison and I were reunited, he gave me pleasure I had not known since I was with your mother,� Mrs. Morrison concluded.

We were all surprised when my sweet little Emily burst into tears. She covered her face with her hands and cried. Mrs. Morrison put her hand to her mouth, clearly distressed. She and her husband both leaned toward Emily, but I was the one who put a comforting arm around her. �My dear Lady Emily, what is the matter?� I asked.

Emily removed her hands from her face. She was actually smiling! �Nothing, sir,� she said, and she laughed. The tears spilling down her face were of joy. �I am so relieved! I�� She turned to Mrs. Morrison. �I thought that I was wicked and bad for some of the thoughts I&#8217;ve had, but to know that my mother was like me, and that she had wonderful friends who loved her for it�it&#8217;s so wonderful.�

Mrs. Morrison was glowing. She took Emily gently by the hand. �I loved your mother very much,� she said softly. �I knew that you were a special girl from the moment I laid eyes on you. Would you like to play with me tonight, Lady Emily?�

�Yes, please,� my beloved said softly, and Mrs. Morrison leaned toward her, kissing her softly on the lips.

I looked forward to seeing my whore with a woman. Mrs. Morrison was a lovely, attractive lady. Her body, like her face, appeared 20 years younger than her actual age. The ladies clasped hands, giggling, and Morrison and I followed them up to the master bedchamber. Morrison and I sat in armchairs, while Mrs. Morrison and Emily stood before us.

�You may remove your clothing and go to your knees, Lady Emily,� I instructed, and took another sip of my beer.

�Yes, sir,� she said, and did as she was told without hesitation. I halted Mrs. Morrison as she reached out to touch her.

�There are some rules for playing with my whore,� I said. �I am to witness any and all sexual activities that this girl participates in. And her cunt is my personal property; no one else may touch or have her there.�

Mrs. Morrison was ready to protest, but her husband cut in. �Your terms are fair,� he said, giving his wife a pointed look.

�Also,� I added, �and I know that this may be unnecessary to state, but do not be brutal to her, please.�

�Oh, of course not,� Mrs. Morrison said softly, advancing to Emily. Addressing her, she said, �Lady Emily, while we play, I&#8217;d like you to call me &#8216;Mother.&#8217; Can you do that, please?�

�Yes, Mother,� Emily said in a tiny voice.

�Hands behind your back, my pet,� Mrs. Morrison said kindly, and Emily swiftly obeyed her new mistress. �Mr. Morrison, can you fetch two lengths of soft rope, please?�

�Certainly, Mrs. Morrison,� my old friend said, rising to accommodate his wife&#8217;s request. He and his wife kissed briefly before Mrs. Morrison tied up Emily&#8217;s wrists and ankles. I involuntarily stroked my cock through my trousers, eager to see what would be done to my whore.

Mrs. Morrison touched Emily&#8217;s face. �Do you like to be tied up?� she asked.

�Yes, Mother,� Emily said.

�Have you ever pleasured a woman before, my pet?� Mrs. Morrison asked as she began slipping out of her own gown.

�No, Mother,� Emily admitted.

�Come, then, Mother&#8217;s going to teach her little pet how to do it just right,� Mrs. Morrison cooed. She beckoned to Emily. Emily awkwardly shuffled on her knees to her new mistress, who now stood as naked as she. Mrs. Morrison&#8217;s body had no sagging or wrinkles to betray her age; I wondered how she had kept her body as tight as a teenage girl&#8217;s. 

Mrs. Morrison put her hand on the back of Emily&#8217;s head. �Head back, my pet. Mother&#8217;s going to let you lick her pussy, won&#8217;t it be nice?�

�Yes, Mother,� Emily said, and I could tell she was excited as Mrs. Morrison stood directly over her, straddling her head and lowering her pussy onto the little whore&#8217;s face.

Mrs. Morrison&#8217;s cunt was covered in neatly-groomed, fine hair, so fine that it was almost transparent. �Use your tongue to lick Mother&#8217;s pussy, my pet. Oh, yes�� Mrs. Morrison put her hands on Emily&#8217;s shoulders to steady herself as my beloved went to work. As Emily wriggled her tongue into Mrs. Morrison&#8217;s hole and the older woman let out a series of loud, appreciative moans, I had taken my cock from my trousers and was stroking myself. Only a little; my turn with the girl would come soon, as Mrs. Morrison came quickly.

�Lick Mother clean, my pet,� Mrs. Morrison panted, squatting on Emily&#8217;s face. By the time Emily was through and Mrs. Morrison had climbed off of her, the lower half of her face was covered in pussy juices. �What do we say, pet?� Mrs. Morrison asked, as though she were speaking to a small child.

�Thank you, Mother,� Emily recited.

�You&#8217;re welcome, my pet. You are a dirty, messy little pet, aren&#8217;t you?�

�Yes, Mother.�

Mrs. Morrison retrieved a handkerchief and wiped the cum from Emily&#8217;s face before kissing her softly. �That&#8217;s a good little pet,� Mrs. Morrison whispered. She got down on her knees, and taking Emily by the shoulders, kissed her deeply. My cock was throbbing by then.

Morrison, in a similar state of arousal, asked, �May I have a crack at her?� He grinned wickedly. �I will not ask her to call me &#8216;Father.&#8217;�

�Certainly,� I said with a wave of my hand. Morrison stood and quickly disrobed. He had a paunchy gut, but otherwise had muscular features. Mrs. Morrison stood and kissed her husband with the same passion that she had my beloved.

�May I show my appreciation to our guest?� Mrs. Morrison asked her husband.

�Yes, dear,� Mr. Morrison said, as he positioned himself to be pleasured by my whore, Mrs. Morrison came and stood before me.

�May I suck your cock, Mr. Singer?� she asked.

�Yes, please, Mrs. Morrison,� I said, as she settled on her knees before me, eagerly taking my throbbing member in her hot little mouth. I put my hands on the back of her head, mussing her fancy up-do as I fucked her mouth quickly. Over her head, I watched my one please my old friend. He had his hands tangled in her hair, but was not forcing himself down her throat. He was groaning as Emily took him deep. She had become an expert cocksucker in the past few weeks, after spending so much time pleasing me and the Captain on our voyage.

I fucked Mrs. Morrison&#8217;s mouth harder, knowing that my balls would leave some evidence on her chin. No matter; she put her hands on around my waist and prompted me to fuck her harder and harder. She was a whore, too; Morrison had hinted as much in our correspondence, but I had no idea of her past with Lady Anne. The thought of watching Mrs. Morrison have her way with sweet Lady Emily, her former lover&#8217;s daughter, made me come quicker than I might have.

Mrs. Morrison cleaned my cock with eager strokes of her tongue. She was smiling up at me, I knew, but my attention was focused on Mr. Morrison and my Emily. He was allowing her to take her time, and she was bobbing her head, taking his stubby cock as deeply as she could each time.

Mrs. Morrison stood and went behind her husband. I watched her put two of her fingers into her mouth, then stick them into her husband&#8217;s ass. He grunted loudly, grabbing Emily by the back of the head as he came down her throat. I smiled to myself, proud of her for taking his cum so willingly. She grinned up at him as he gently wiped some stray cum from her chin. �Thank you, my lady,� he said quietly.

�You&#8217;re welcome, Mr. Morrison,� she chirped happily. 

Our play continued throughout the night, with the four of us ending up on the Morrisons oversized bed. Morrison and I fucked my whore simultaneously, while Mrs. Morrison fingered her husband&#8217;s ass from behind. Mrs. Morrison tortured Emily&#8217;s clamped nipples, nibbling her so hard at one point that she drew blood (for which she apologized profusely, saying, �Mother didn&#8217;t mean to hurt her poor little pet, poor dear,�). Looking back on that wicked night in Calcutta, it was the most fun that my Lady Emily and I had with other people involved. We could surpass it on our own, and we often did, but we enjoyed that night with the Morrisons.

When Emily and I were alone again in our bedchamber that morning, I held her close and we discussed the events of the night. �Did you enjoy being with Mrs. Morrison?� I asked her as I stroked her back.

�Yes, sir,� she said. �I&#8217;ve had thoughts about women, and�it was even better than I ever imagined. Thank you for allowing me to do that, sir.�

�You&#8217;re welcome, my dear. And what did you think about calling Mrs. Morrison &#8216;Mother&#8217;?�

Emily confessed, �I thought it strange at first. But�I started to like it. It made me really excited.� Her tone became a bit more serious. �You know, she told me that she was never able to have any children of her own. Poor dear.�

�Yes,� I agreed, �But I should hope that she wouldn&#8217;t do these sort of things with her own children.�

�No,� Emily agreed faintly, and we fell asleep soon after, not waking again until late morning. We would have a few more days of fun with our host and hostess before beginning the next part of our trip, taking the train down to Bangalore to visit my father&#8217;s gravesite. After that, we would travel a bit around the country before returning to Calcutta to be wed. Each day with my little Emily was sweeter as I led her further and further down a dark and exciting path. She wanted to be my slave, my whore, and I was more than willing to give that life to her.


The morning that we departed for Bangalore, Emily looked lovely but exhausted as we stood on the platform and waited for the train. And well she might; she had been put through her paces the previous night by myself and our host and hostess. We had spent a little more time in the �dungeon� that the Morrisons had set up in their basement, for their own personal activities. Emily, chained standing and spread-eagle to a tall rack set up in the middle of the cellar room, had been tortured, pleasured, and had done much pleasing throughout the entire night. 

I had continued to push Emily&#8217;s boundaries of tolerance for punishment. She had asked me to do this. �Please sir,� she had said, kneeling before me in our bedchamber, completely in the nude. �I know you like to be rough. You may do whatever you like to me; I want to please you.�

During our first week in Calcutta, I had encouraged Morrison and his little wife to play a little rough with Lady Emily as well. I was amazed at the sadistic side of her dear &#8216;Mother&#8217;; that final night in Calcutta, after we finished chaining the young lady to the rack, Mrs. Morrison had ducked briefly into a small root cellar, returning with a long leather whip. �May I use this on her, Mr. Singer?� she asked sweetly, twirling the whip in the air expertly. Her husband was eyeing her with admiration; I wondered if she was often the one wielding that whip in their private time.

�What do you think, Lady Emily?� I asked. I had not used anything more brutal than a riding crop on her tender skin, but the thought of watching her take a beating from her mistress turned me on. 

She could see it in my eyes, just as easily as I could read the fear (and the excitement) in hers. �All right, sir,� she said, without hesitation, and only the slightest hint of apprehension in her voice. I nodded to Mrs. Morrison, and I stood by and watched the show for a bit.

Mrs. Morrison stood before Lady Emily, touching her face softly before kissing her briefly. �Have you been a bad little pet?� she asked.

�Yes, Mother,� Emily chirped, and I noted the way that her toes curled. Her nipples were hardening against a new pair of nipple clips, a gift from her dear &#8216;Mother.&#8217; These clips dug painfully into her nipples whenever she became aroused�which was often. For a long time, she would refuse to wear any other pair.

�Mother has to punish her naughty little pet,� Mrs. Morrison said. She grabbed one of Emily&#8217;s tits briefly, causing Emily to yell out. Mrs. Morrison walked around behind Lady Emily, and, standing a few feet behind her, raised the whip expertly and lashed it against my beloved&#8217;s ass. Emily screamed out louder, and I watched small drops of blood begin to drip from the first wound.

Mrs. Morrison spent a few minutes beating my whore&#8217;s back and ass, allowing her time to feel the pain from each new would before delivering another. She stopped at ten; I might have stopped her at that moment, if she didn&#8217;t toss the whip aside herself. I was tempted to comfort my girl, as she whimpered and cried on the rack. But she had asked for this; I stood by, rubbing my crotch, standing beside my old friend as we watched our women play.

Mrs. Morrison stepped right behind Emily, tracing her fingers across the fresh wounds. �Good little pet,� she murmured. �Would you like a treat, pet?�

�Yes, Mother,� Emily whimpered. Mrs. Morrison began kissing and licking the girl&#8217;s neck. I watched her lube her two fingers in her mouth, and I grabbed my cock, knowing what she would do. Emily whimpered louder as Mrs. Morrison shoved her fingers into Emily&#8217;s asshole, and began fucking her roughly.

�That&#8217;s it, pet�you like it when Mother plays with your ass, don&#8217;t you?�

�Oh, God�yes, Mother,� Emily moaned. I took that as my cue to join in on the fun. I stepped forward, and stood in front of Emily. She smiled at me; her lovely face was soaked in tears. Returning her grin, I took two hooked fingers and shoved them into her cunt, clawing at the walls of her dripping-wet pussy as I dug deeper and deeper inside of her. I stroked her throbbing clit with my thumb, and she shuddered as she was finger-fucked in her holes, moaning loudly.

I could feel her coming against my fingers as I shoved a third one into her cunt. I felt the walls of her pussy flutter madly around me as she coated my fingers in her juices. I kissed her roughly before putting my fingers to her lips. �Clean them, my dear.�

She did so, and Mrs. Morrison stopped fucking her ass with her fingers, and kissed Emily softly on the back of the neck. She stepped aside and allowed her husband to take her spot behind Emily. We fucked her at the same time, and I allowed her to scream to her heart&#8217;s content as her ass was shredded by Morrison&#8217;s thick member. He grabbed her hair roughly and yanked her head back, and we both bit and nibbled at her neck as she cried out.

�Oh, Christ!� she yelled out. �Oh, God, oh, please, sir, oh Goooood!� she screamed, letting out an animal shriek as we pounded into her as hard as we could. I loved fucking her rough, feeling her tearing around me with each ungraceful thrust. After Morrison had come and released from her, I grabbed her by the thighs and rammed into her one last time, balls-deep as I came with a loud moan. The chains offered little slack, so I nearly threw my back out with the effort of holding her close to me. I released her quickly, and her three tormentors left her to drip for a moment as we regained ourselves.

At that point, we convened to the parlor upstairs. Lady Emily walked with much difficulty, wincing with each step, so Mrs. Morrison helped her along, wrapped her arm around her waist as we went up. We had cake and coffee, and Emily sat at her mistress&#8217;s feet, as her &#8216;Mother&#8217; fed her small bites from her own plate. But the young whore&#8217;s real dessert came after we had finished our coffee. Mrs. Morrison, still nude (as we all were) from our escapades in the basement, had taken a swipe of frosting from the top of the remaining cake, and had spread it on her pussy.

�Go ahead, my pet, lick Mother clean,� she coaxed Emily, and I watched my girl eagerly lap up the frosting from Mrs. Morrison&#8217;s cunt. After pleasing &#8216;Mother&#8217; thoroughly, Morrison followed suit, spreading frosting on his cock and allowing Emily to have at it.

She pleasured me next, but I did not coat my cock for her. �My cock is sweet enough for you as it is, isn&#8217;t it, my dear?� I asked.

She eyed my throbbing member hungrily. �Yes, sir.�

�All yours, Lady Emily.� And she gobbled me up, fondling my testicles (she always made sure to give them their due) with her soft hands as she sucked me. Having already come into her once in the past hour (and a few more times already that day), I held out for quite some time, and when I finally sent my seed down her slender little throat, she was utterly exhausted.

We allowed her a break as Morrison and I had our turns with his wife (he did not insist that I leave her pussy be, so I made some use of it), and our play continued thus throughout the night, ending only as the sun began to rise. Mrs. Morrison had made another pot of coffee, and we all put on silk robes and took it on the patio, watching the sunrise. 

After packing enough of our things for the next fortnight of our trip (as we would be returning to Calcutta, the Morrisons had kindly allowed us to board the rest of our things with them during our absence), we departed for the train station. Mrs. Morrison had given Lady Emily a tearful goodbye. �I know you will be back soon,� she said as she embraced my whore, �but I can&#8217;t help thinking how difficult it will be to let you go when you leave us again.�

�Goodbye, Mrs. Morrison,� Emily said kindly (she only called her &#8216;Mother&#8217; during playtime), kissing the woman softly on the cheek. �Thank you so much for your hospitality.�

Morrison saw us to the train station in his carriage, and even waited with us until the train arrived. He kissed Emily briefly before we boarded. �Goodbye, my lady,� he said, without the emotion of his wife. He liked Emily very much, but he viewed his time with her as play, and nothing more. He certainly was not attached to her the way that his wife was. 

I shook my friend&#8217;s hand, and Emily and I boarded the train. We were led to our private compartment, and as soon as we were inside, I pulled the blinds over all of the windows facing out into the narrow corridor. My beloved had already sprawled out onto one of the bench seats.

I smiled at her and sat next to her head. �Tired, my dear?� I teased.

Her eyes closed, she smiled a little and nodded. She moved back so that her head was resting in my lap. I stroked her hair, and we were silent until the train began to move. I could tell by her breathing pattern that she was not asleep yet.

�Emily,� I said, �I do wonder how much Mrs. Morrison would pay to own you.�

Her eyes snapped open. She looked up at me in surprise. �What do you mean, sir?�

I grinned down at her. Her cheeks were beginning to glow. �Your dear &#8216;Mother&#8217; adores you, doesn&#8217;t she?�

�I�I suppose she does, sir.�

�I bet she&#8217;d pay a whole lot of money to have you all to herself,� I mused. �I know how much she wants to play with your cunt. If I really wanted to, I could sell you off to her and add a considerable amount to my fortune.�

Emily&#8217;s eyes widened. �Oh, but�you�you wouldn&#8217;t do that, sir. You&#8217;re teasing.�

I raised an eyebrow. �Am I?�

�Oh, sir,� Emily said, looking distressed, �do not tease me so.�

�You mean you would not want to stay with your dear &#8216;Mother&#8217;?� I asked, almost mocking.

�Please, sir,� she said. �You&#8217;re the one that I love.� I smiled down at her, and assured her that I was only kidding. �Oh, sir, you are cruel,� she said, and I kissed her softly before she closed her eyes again, this time achieving sleep in a relatively short amount of time.

I thought of our past week in Calcutta. I had to admit; though I enjoyed watching my whore with another woman (particularly one as sexy as Mrs. Morrison), I was a little jealous of how close they&#8217;d become in such a short period to time. I had even worried about the time that they spent alone together; would Emily be able to stop her if she wanted to break the rules? Would my little whore even want to stop her?

I had expressed my concerns to Emily, but she had reassured me. �Sir, if she ever tries to touch me when we are alone, I will�I will scream,� she promised. �No matter where we are. And I&#8217;ll try to run away. I don&#8217;t want to break your rules, sir.�

I had kissed her softly. �I know you don&#8217;t, my dear.� And I realized why my sweet Emily was so special. It was not because she was so pretty; she certainly was beautiful, but there are beautiful girls everywhere. And it was definitely not because she was of the noble class; there are plenty of Lords and Ladies and Dukes and Duchesses and such who are not at all worthwhile human beings. No�what made my little Emily special was her unwavering loyalty. She was obedient and sincere; she had always been this way. This is why I loved her so.

As I stroked her hair and we began our long trip to Bangalore, I thought of the weeks ahead of us. My father&#8217;s gravesite�then many exciting sites around the strange foreign land�then back to Calcutta to be wed. I looked down at Emily&#8217;s face. My beautiful bride. My sweet, obedient, perfect little slave. I don&#8217;t remember ever being happier than I was at that moment, on the train to Bangalore, knowing that even though many men and women would admire and fuck and love her, she would always be all mine.










Lady Emily&#8217;s Diary

15 July, 18&#8212;

Finally, finally, we have arrived in Bangalore! The train ride took nearly three whole days, and I must admit that I have been going a little stir-crazy in our tiny (but thankfully private) compartment. The train was twice delayed on the tracks due to the heavy rains; Mr. Singer gave me a little book about the climate of India, and I have learned that we have arrived in the middle of what is known as the �monsoon season.� How dreadful! And as I write this, in our little (and most authentically Indian) quarters, the rain continues to pound against the windows, so violently that I am afraid they will shatter. 

But Mr. Singer reassures me. �These happen every year. The people are prepared for them.� Still, I had read in the little book that if the monsoons are too heavy, it could have devastating effects on the local economy. I suppose this does not concern me personally, but still�I do worry.

Mr. Singer is troubled as well, but it is not from the strange weather. We are going to visit his father&#8217;s gravesite tomorrow, and he has realized that he does not know exactly where it is located. I suggested contacting one of his father&#8217;s old friends. �Did he give you any names in his correspondence to you?� I asked. �Were any names mentioned in the message you received upon his death?�

Mr. Singer kissed me heartily, declared me a genius, and has been combing through the letters (which he brought with him, to reference any interesting points to visit), and jotting down names as he has come upon them. I am glad to have been helpful, especially to my dear old friend. I was afraid, as we started on our way to Bangalore, that he was displeased with me. His teasing about Mrs. Morrison troubled me all the way here.

I have avoided writing much on the topic of Mrs. Morrison in here as of yet. But now that I have some quiet time to myself, and have been out of Calcutta for a few days now, I can reflect on my experiences with a clearer mind. I do think that she is a dear woman, and I cannot deny that I have had lots of fun with her, her kind husband, and my Mr. Singer these past few days. However, I am�dare I admit this?...I am a little frightened of her.

Oh, yes! I am afraid of that tiny, lovely woman. Can I even begin to explain? There is a look in her eyes, a very intense look, whenever we are playing together. My Mr. Singer gets a similar look, but I feel so different with him. When Mr. Singer looks at me hungrily, I feel wanted, and I feel excited. But with Mrs. Morrison�her looks of lust cause me to tremble in fear. 

I&#8217;m not entirely certain why, really. She is rougher with me than my Mr. Singer, but I do enjoy the rough treatment. What made me cry the most, after she whipped me on our last night in Calcutta, was the idea that the marks of the whip on my back would never go away, that I would be scarred and hideous forever. But even now, I can see them fading away quickly. Mr. Singer spreads a lotion on them, several times daily, and they are now a light pink. I enjoyed the pain of being whipped�what is the matter with me, that I want to take such punishment? I am so lucky to be with a man who will indulge my dark fantasies�and who will introduce me to people who wish to do the same. 

I am still reeling from the news of my mother&#8217;s separate affairs with both Mr. and Mrs. Morrison. She must have been quite young when she was with Mr. Morrison! I do know that she was a couple of years older than Mrs. Morrison, who married very young herself. I think back to two years ago, when Mr. Singer refused to allow me to hastily marry Mr. Gainsley. I am so glad, so so glad, that he did so! I cannot begin to think that Mr. Gainsley would be so understanding of my needs as my dear old friend.

Mr. Singer expressed some jealousy of my friendship with Mrs. Morrison. I reassured him, and while I did not lie to him, I did keep a small bit of truth from him. That is why I was so bothered after he teased me on the train; I thought that he had found out my dishonesty.

I did not tell Mr. Singer of a conversation that I&#8217;d had with Mrs. Morrison. It was two days after our first night together; we&#8217;d only been in Calcutta less than a week, but already we were very close. She and I were walking together in the gardens on her estate; we had just taken tea on the patio, and she was showing me the exotic flowers growing all around the back of their vast property.

At one point, Mrs. Morrison took my hand. I did not wretch mine away; perfectly innocent to hold hands, I thought. We continued along for a short while, when Mrs. Morrison asked, �Lady Emily, would you like to stay here with me?�

I looked at her, surprised into silence. She smiled at me kindly. �I know we have only just become friends, but I adore you, Lady Emily. You remind me of that loving friend that I lost so long ago. Were you ever lonely for your mother as a child, my dear? You never got to know her at all.�

The sting of losing my mother at a young age had left me long ago. I answered honestly. �Yes, at times, I was,� I said. �But I always had my Mr. Singer. He was always good to me.�

�He is a good man,� Mrs. Morrison agreed. �Very handsome, very wealthy�and very sexy.�

The bedchamber talk seemed out of place in the bright lovely garden, and I know that I blushed a little. �Yes,� I agreed. 

�I can tell how much he loves you,� Mrs. Morrison continued as we walked along. �He&#8217;ll give you anything you want, won&#8217;t he?�

I nodded. �I believe he will,� I said, and I knew this to be true.

�I&#8217;m sure,� Mrs. Morrison said, �that if you told him that you wanted to stay here, he&#8217;d let you. He would not deny your wishes, would he?�

I did yank my hand from hers then. �But Mrs. Morrison,� I said, �I love Mr. Singer. I&#8217;m going to be his wife; I belong to him.�

She looked about to cry then. �You know, my dear, before I married Mr. Morrison I tried to forget about your mother. And I almost did. But being with him again, and remembering that he had been with her, and I had been with her�since we came here, I have wondered, what would our lives have been like if she were still alive? What if she were here with us? You do like me and Mr. Morrison, don&#8217;t you, Lady Emily?�

�Yes, I do,� I said. �But I cannot stay. I do not wish to stay.� Before Mrs. Morrison could say anything else, I said, �I am not my mother, Mrs. Morrison.�

I felt guilty for being so blunt with the dear woman, who is clearly still heartbroken over losing my mother. Perhaps that is what frightens me; she does not see me as myself, but as a substitute for my mother. As much as I adore Mrs. Morrison (and I do, I really do), I know that she could never care for me for who I really am. Not like my Mr. Singer, who knows me so well, who knows me better than I even know myself.

I begged Mrs. Morrison to forget our conversation in the garden. �We are friends, and I do adore you,� I assured her. �Please, don&#8217;t be upset.� And she had smiled, and apologized, and we did not speak of it again. But when Mr. Singer teased about selling me to her as we began our trip to Bangalore, it made me remember the conversation, and I felt awful again.

But Mr. Singer is not upset with me. No�he just returned to the room, after sending out his inquiries about three men he thought may still be Bangalore, and he has had success. An old friend of his father&#8217;s, a Colonel Phineas Faulkner (we shared a giggle at the name), is retired and living only a few blocks from our lodging. We are to call on him late in the morning tomorrow, and he will guide us to the late Mr. Avery Singer III&#8217;s gravesite. Mr. Singer seems so much happier now than he did when we arrived just hours ago. I will give him extra attention this evening, to ensure his happy mood for tomorrow.


16 July, 18&#8212;

Such a long day! But I am not tired yet; for once, Mr. Singer has retired to bed before me. I do not wish to forget the events of this day, so I will write them out now, until I am too tired to go on. As I write this, the clock strikes midnight, so we have technically entered into a new day.

We woke early in the morning. In fact, I awoke as the sun was just rising; Mr. Singer was already up, and dressed in a fine suit, sipping his morning tea. �Good morning, my dear,� he said.

I sat up. �Have you been awake long?� I asked.

�Yes,� he admitted. �I hardly slept.�

Poor man! The fatigue showed on his face. I rose from bed and went to him, planting a kiss on his cheek. �It is early yet,� I said. �You could lie down for a while; I will make sure that everything is ready for us to see Colonel Faulkner.�

Mr. Singer smiled. �I&#8217;m sure that you would, my dear, but I&#8217;m not tired. I have much on my mind today.�

�Tell me,� I said, and I sat on his knee. He put his arms around me and held me close; I was naked, as I always am when we go to bed together. He loves to run his hands over my soft body, and I love letting him do so. His touch is both comforting and electrifying. It makes me feel both safe and excited�I cannot explain it more succinctly than that.

He told me about his father. Some things, I already knew; his father had left for India only a few months after his eldest son, Avery Singer IV, died of an illness. He had not seen his father since; all he had were the correspondences over the years, and the strange gifts. His mother had been heartbroken over the abandonment, but had not remarried until his father&#8217;s death years later. She and her new husband had moved to America together (we had visited them in Boston, years ago; I remember hearing talk of war at that time, but Mr. Singer had reassured me that the fighting was not quite as north as we were). 

�But even before he left,� Mr. Singer said, �I did not feel like I knew my father. He and my brother were close, and Avery&#8217;s death really hurt my father, probably even moreso than it hurt me or my mother. I can&#8217;t help but wonder if he wouldn&#8217;t have gone, if Avery had lived.� He sighed, and looked so sad at that moment, that I wanted to make him feel better. I slipped off of his lap and went to my knees. Without a word, I pulled down his trousers and began to stroke his cock to hardness.

He smiled at me, his wicked glint back in his eye. �Trying to distract me, my dear?� I nodded and he grinned.

�Oh, sir,� I sighed, �you do have the biggest cock I&#8217;ve ever seen. May I please you, sir?�

�Of course,� he said, and when he was sufficiently hard, I took him in my mouth, slowly. I sucked him at a leisurely pace, lingering my tongue across his shaft, even leaning down to take his balls in my mouth. He loved that; he groaned loudly, but sat back and allowed me to do all of the work. I took my time. As I write this, I have pleasured four different men: Mr. Singer, the Captain, Mr. Morrison, and the nameless Indian conductor on the train (who had the loveliest eyelashes I&#8217;ve seen on anyone, man or woman), and while I enjoy the feeling that I can give to them, I only truly enjoy the feel of my master&#8217;s cock in my mouth. I could suck him all day long, like a child with a hard candy. I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;d let me, too, if it were possible.

So I took my time, and when Mr. Singer came messily into my mouth, I took my time cleaning him as well, licking the cum from his cock and swallowing it dutifully (I can even taste the difference between my Mr. Singer and other men, and I crave him all the time). For a couple of minutes, we sat just that way, me kneeling before him, he smiling and touching my face, until he said, �Bath time, my dear.�

He did not bathe with me, as he was already up and dressed, but he did fill the tub for me and wash me himself. We were silent as he washed me, and I knew that he was distracted by the events of the day. So I tried to distract him again by making a small request. �I really need to come, sir,� I whispered as he washed my thighs gently. �Will you help me, please?�

He put a hand to my cunt. �Indeed, you do. Your little clit is quite swollen.� He smiled and took his hand away from me. �Have you been a good girl, Emily? Do you deserve release?�

�I think I do, sir,� I said softly. I pretended to beg. �Please, sir? I need you so much.�

�You have been good, my Emily,� he admitted. He tickled my clit lightly, but even that touch made me squirm. With his free hand, he grabbed my wrist. �Hold still and relax for your friend, little girl. That&#8217;s right�� 

I leaned my head back against the rim of the tub and closed my eyes, raising my hips to meet his touch as he stroked me, taking as much time on me as I had with him. I shuddered as he took two fingers and shoved them into my cunt. �Oh, Emily,� he said, �you&#8217;re still so tight for me. Your little cunt is mine only, isn&#8217;t it, my dear?�

�Yes, sir,� I moaned as he slowly thrust his fingers in and out of me, stabbing the walls of my pussy roughly. He shoved his fingers in again and held them, before spreading them apart. I moaned as he twisted his wrist, back and forth, slowly, widening the span of his fingers and forcing me to stretch to accommodate him. 

He removed his fingers abruptly, and I let out a scream as I came. I had not even felt myself coming, so swept up was I in what he was doing to me. Mr. Singer loves to surprise me, and he certainly keeps me on my toes (sometimes literally) when it comes to our sexual activities.

�Was that nice for you, Lady Emily?� he asked mildly as he stirred my cum-tainted water with his hand.

I managed to nod, panting as I was from the intense, unexpected orgasm. He smiled slowly at me, a wicked grin. He knows my body so well. I wonder how long I will continue to be amazed by this fact. I hope that I never take it for granted; I hope I always remember what good my dear old friend does for me everyday.

Mr. Singer finished bathing me, and I put on a demure dress and a long, dark coat. The sky was grey, but it was not raining again�yet. We had breakfast at a small restaurant (eating sweet sabudana vada, which left me feeling quite full for most of the day), and then, armed with umbrellas, we made our way towards Colonel Faulkner&#8217;s residence, stopping to pick up a bouquet of exotic flowers from a tiny shop run by a wrinkled old Indian woman.

Mr. Singer handed me the flowers. �You don&#8217;t mind holding these, do you, my dear?�

�Of course not, sir.�

�You may lay them on my father&#8217;s grave for me,� he said with a distant smile, and I nodded. I hooked my umbrella over my arm and held Mr. Singer&#8217;s gloved hand in mine as we made our way up the crowded streets. We were accosted by beggars, particularly young children, but I had grown used to this in Calcutta. That is one thing I have not enjoyed about this trip, the number of poor little children that I&#8217;ve seen running around with no shoes and shabby clothing. I wish to stop and give bank notes to them all; I could certainly afford to. When I expressed my wish to Mr. Singer after our second day in Calcutta, he had shaken his head at me. �You wouldn&#8217;t be doing as much good as you might think,� he&#8217;d said, and we left it at that, and I forced myself to ignore the little children and to focus on Mr. Singer.

Colonel Faulkner&#8217;s gate was guarded by a young Englishman, who scared off a small group of beggars who had followed us there. He eyed us carefully, but without disdain or suspicion. �Mr. Aaron Singer?� he asked.

�Yes,� Mr. Singer replied. �And my betrothed, the Lady Emily Wainwright.�

�Welcome,� the young man (practically a boy, really) said, opening the gate to admit us. �The Colonel has been expecting you.�

I felt the boy&#8217;s eyes on me as Mr. Singer and I walked up the drive leading to Colonel Faulkner&#8217;s front door. We were greeted by the man himself, a big man with a barrel-sized chest and a carefully sculpted white beard. �Aaron Singer,� he boomed, �Put it here, young man.� I was surprised that the man had an American accent.

Mr. Singer shook hands with the big old man, then placed a gentle hand on the small of my back. �Colonel, this is my fianc�e, Lady Emily Wainwright.�

�My lady,� the Colonel said, and I gave him my hand. He kissed it much more gently than I thought a big man like him might. He smiled at me briefly before leading us into his parlor. �It&#8217;s not too early for a drink, is it? Hell, since I&#8217;ve retired, it doesn&#8217;t really matter. Join me, Singer?�

I was surprised when Mr. Singer said, �I believe I will. Considering the occasion, I think it is only appropriate.�

�And the lady?� the Colonel asked as he went to his mini bar and began to pour scotch for himself and Mr. Singer.

I shook my head, biting back a smile. �No, thank you, Colonel. Perhaps just a glass of water?�

�All the better,� the Colonel said, bringing Mr. Singer his scotch. �Better that someone in this little party keeps their wits about them. I&#8217;ll get a water from the kitchen.�

�I don&#8217;t wish to impose��

�Nonsense, my lady,� the Colonel boomed jovially. �I won&#8217;t be but a moment. And here,� he said, carefully taking the bouquet of flowers from my arms, �I&#8217;ll put these in water for you until we depart.�

As soon as he left the room, Mr. Singer leaned towards me. He whispered, �What do you think of my father&#8217;s old friend?�

�He seems very nice,� I said. 

�You think everyone is nice,� Mr. Singer teased, and I suppose that this is true. Or, to be more accurate, most people are typically nice to me. I know it is because I am pretty, and because I am wealthy and carry a title of nobility. Mr. Singer taught me, when I was young, that I had stumbled upon these by luck, not because I deserved them. �You have no right to be impolite to anyone. Even if they believe, for some reason, that you are better than they, that does not make it so. You are to treat everyone with respect; particularly myself, and the other adults who take care of you. Do you understand me, my child?�

�Yes, sir,� I had said in a small voice. I was being lectured for having a tantrum while we were in town. I was only four; my father had been dead but a month, and I had behaved like a brat. Mr. Singer had patted my head gently.

�You are a sweet little girl,� he had said. �You were not yourself today. I expect that you will not behave that way again, will you?�

�No, sir,� I said, and had earned a smile from him.

Just as Mr. Singer had taught me to be kindly to everyone as a child, so he was teaching me to be an indiscriminate whore.&nbsp; He would choose the men (and women) that I would pleasure, not I, though my opinion comes into play. Truthfully, I would not have chosen to be with the Colonel if I were given the choice. But I knew that my master would have me do it, and so I did. And all the better; it certainly was a strange and exciting experience, unlike any I&#8217;ve had so far!

Goodness, I think I have finally worn myself out. I will pick this up tomorrow; undoubtedly, Mr. Singer will have a long rest, so I will rise before he and give a more detailed description of my encounter with the Colonel in the morning. Goodnight!


19 July, 18&#8212;

Well, I have been more distracted these past few days than I had anticipated. But it has been so wonderful. Mr. Singer and I have seen so many exciting things together, like the beautiful Lalbagh Botanical Gardens, the lovely sultan&#8217;s palace, several Buddhist temples, and the Jumma Masji mosque (my personal favorite sight in Bangalore thus far). But I will not write at length of those; I do not believe that my words are adequate to describe the beauty and wonder of these places. I have never seen anything like it; everything in India makes Western Culture seem so bland, and dark, and grey.

Though the weather has been grey since our arrival, it is sunny today. But we are on a train again; we are leaving Bangalore and heading west, to Mumbai. It will be nearly two days on board the train again, but I finally have time to think again. Mr. Singer has left me alone in our private compartment; he is buying a drink for another Western traveler, a single woman whom he hopes to coax back to play with us. I am leaving him to it, as he instructed, and having a little time alone. I do not doubt his ability to seduce her, so I will get down to it.

When the Colonel returned to the room with my glass of water, he handed it to me and I thanked him sweetly. He raised his scotch in a toast. �To Avery Singer III, his fine son, and the young man&#8217;s lovely bride-to-be,� the Colonel declared, and we drank to that.

Mr. Singer and the Colonel spoke on for a time about the late man, and I listened politely, having no need to interject. I am usually the center of conversation (I do not plan it out this way; it is just so), so I actually find it nice to be able to just listen to the conversation, instead of having to move it along. 

Inevitably, the conversation came to sex. How does my Mr. Singer do that, I wonder? Such subjects are so taboo, and yet people are so open with him. Perhaps he has an effect on people, the way that he does on me. I find him irresistible; it would be no wonder if it were the same for others. 

The Colonel said, with another hearty laugh, �Your father and I enjoyed some wild times together, my boy! There are so many lovely young women in this city, and I daresay I have had my share of them.� He suddenly gave me a startled look. �I beg your pardon, my lady!� He declared this as though he only realized I were in his presence. Perhaps, if I were not accustomed to such talk, I would have gasped aloud to alert him of the presence of dainty ears.

I smiled. �Not at all, Colonel.�

�Lady Emily is not exactly an innocent little thing,� Mr. Singer explained. He turned to me briefly, giving me a wink. At that moment, the heavens opened up and the rain began to pour. It had been still only seconds before; now, the rain pounded against the enormous windows of the Colonel&#8217;s airy house.

�Well,� the Colonel said, his face deeply red (either from embarrassment or from drink, it was difficult to tell), �this ought to pass quickly. We won&#8217;t be able to be off to the graveyard &#8216;til then.�

Mr. Singer polished off his scotch before saying, �Why don&#8217;t we pour another drink and have a little fun, Colonel. You have shown us so much hospitality, and I&#8217;d like to repay you by helping you relive some of the good old days with my father. Would you like to play around with my young lady?�

The Colonel looked surprised for a moment, then thoughtful. He silently took Mr. Singer&#8217;s glass, and filled it, and his own. In fact, he drank back his entire glass and poured himself a third before bringing Mr. Singer his drink. But when he finally spoke, it was directed to me.

�May I show you something upstairs, my lady?� His face was so serious; prior to that moment, I had been uncertain if such a good-humored, flamboyant old man could ever be so serious. 

I waited for Mr. Singer to respond for me, but he did not. I said, �I will�but Mr. Singer must come along as well. He always accompanies me.�

�Come along,� the Colonel said, offering me his arm. I looked at Mr. Singer briefly, and he nodded his approval and stood up. He walked behind us as the Colonel and I walked arm-in-arm to his bedroom upstairs. Unlike the rest of the house (decorated in animal heads from many a hunting expedition), it was plainly furnished, with a large bed. The Colonel released my arm, put down his drink, and went to his closet.

I was not too surprised when the Colonel brought out a riding crop. I wanted to laugh; goodness, Mr. Singer knew a lot of people who kept implements of torment in their bedrooms! But I was surprised with what he said next. �Would you use this on me, my lady?�

I was shocked. Such a big, strong man wanted to be dominated? By a little tiny girl? I even asked, �You want me to punish you?�

The Colonel nodded eagerly. �Oh, yes, my lady. I have been a bad, dirty old man. You can give me what I need.�

I looked at Mr. Singer again. Would he approve of my doing this? I will admit, the thought excited me, but I had come to terms with the fact that Mr. Singer would never allow me to have control of him. Would he allow me to do this to others?

When he nodded, I couldn&#8217;t help smiling. He stood back and leaned against the closed door, casually watching as I took the riding crop from the Colonel&#8217;s hand. �Strip, old man,� I snarled, surprising myself with my viciousness.

Mr. Singer came up behind me, holding two neckties that he&#8217;d taken from the Colonel&#8217;s drawer. �Here, Lady Emily. Tie his wrists to the bedposts with these. Nice and tight, now.� I turned to him, and Mr. Singer grabbed me and kissed me. �When you&#8217;re done tying him up, strip for me, my dear.�

�Yes, sir,� I said. I turned my attention back to the Colonel. �Turn around and face your bed,� I told him. �Put your hands up on the bedposts�higher!� I lashed his wrists to the posts, slowly tying knots that I&#8217;d noticed Mr. Singer using on me. When the Colonel struggled, he was unable to loosen them, strong as he was.

I stood back a moment and examined the old man. He had a hairy back, covered in moles and sunspots. His ass and thighs were wrinkly and saggy. But I had caught a glimpse of his hard cock, and he was enormous. Bigger than Mr. Singer, even! 

On my master&#8217;s instructions, I stripped naked. I still wore the nipple clips gifted to me by Mrs. Morrison. The sharp edges dug into my nipples painfully; I was aroused at the sight of this sagging old man! I slapped the riding crop against my open palm. �Old man,� I said, �perhaps if you are very good, I&#8217;ll let you take me in my ass. You&#8217;d like that, wouldn&#8217;t you, dirty old man?�

�Oh, yes, my lady,� he said breathlessly, and I snapped the riding crop against his sagging ass. He let out a howl of pain (almost exaggerated), and just as I was thinking of gagging him, Mr. Singer came behind me and handed me another tie, this one waded up. 

�Go ahead, Lady Emily,� he prompted me, and I went to face the Colonel, jumping up onto the bed to shove the tie into his waiting mouth.

�You&#8217;re going to take your punishment,� I snarled, grabbing his cock roughly. He moaned into his gag, and I looked over his shoulder at Mr. Singer. He was grinning at me.

�Lady Emily, I daresay that you are quite mean,� he said, looking most pleased. I will confess that most of the pleasure in abusing that old man came from knowing that I was impressing my master. I wanted him to be proud of me.

I delivered twenty or so stinging blows to the old man&#8217;s back. The riding crop left ugly cuts and bruises on his already rough skin. I would have perhaps beaten him longer, relishing his muffled cries, if Mr. Singer had not gently taken the crop from my hand.

�My lady,� he said, �do you think that your old man has earned his reward?�

I jumped up onto the bed again, removing the makeshift gag from the Colonel&#8217;s mouth. �Dirty old man,� I said, �would you still like to have me in my ass?�

�Yes, my lady,� the Colonel declared. It was so strange and exciting to see a big, strong man whimpering and begging in his restraints. �Please, my lady, let me have you. This dirty old man needs you.�

�Very well,� I said, �so you shall.� I untied his wrists, and got down on my hands and knees on the bed. The Colonel positioned himself behind me, standing at the foot of the bed, his huge cock (already sufficiently soaked in his own pre-cum) just touching my asshole. At that moment, I had a sudden realization; I had offered my ass to a man with an enormous cock! I&#8217;d never taken anything bigger than Mr. Singer, and though he was quite huge himself, the Colonel had him beaten by a large margin. But there was no backing out, now.

I bit back a scream as the old man entered me. I couldn&#8217;t stop myself from letting out ragged grunts as he grabbed my hips and pounded into me. As my ass burned in pain, I feared that I would lose consciousness; my vision was beginning to blur, and I saw black spots with each vicious stab of his cock. 

Thankfully, so turned on was the Colonel by the beating I&#8217;d administered that he came with relative haste. When he finally released from me, I collapsed onto the bed, my chest heaving as I lay on my stomach, my face buried in the Colonel&#8217;s thick feathery pillows. I heard Mr. Singer and the Colonel talk briefly, but I did not hear what they said. Someone left the room.

I felt a gentle hand on my ass, and knew it to be the touch of my master. I forced myself, with great difficult due to the burning of my ass, to roll over onto my back and look up at him. �Good job, my dear,� he praised me, stroking my nipple. �This day is going to be as special for the Colonel as it is for us. I think you&#8217;ve given the old man pleasure that he hasn&#8217;t known in years. He&#8217;ll never forget it, I&#8217;m certain.�

�Where did he go, sir?�

�I asked him to go and retrieve his boy from the gate,� Mr. Singer said. �I saw him looking at you as we came up the drive. Since it&#8217;s still pouring rain, I thought we&#8217;d invite him to play along with us. Think you could take a little boy in your ass after having the Colonel?�

I was tempted to cry out, absolutely not! But of course, I didn&#8217;t. I even managed to convince myself that it wouldn&#8217;t be that bad as I said, �All right, sir.�

�It&#8217;s been quite a long time since I&#8217;ve had a man suck my cock,� Mr. Singer said thoughtfully. �Perhaps I&#8217;ll allow the Colonel to have a go at it�he confessed that he used to suck my father&#8217;s cock on occasion as well.�

�Really?�

�Oh, yes,� Mr. Singer said. Looking thoughtful again, he said, �I guess he is to me what Mrs. Morrison is to you.�

�Yes,� I agreed, sitting up a little. �I suppose you&#8217;re right.�

�Except,� Mr. Singer added, �that I would certainly not allow her access to that cunt of yours.� He reached down and touched me briefly. I was dripping wet, with my own juices and the Colonel&#8217;s cum as it leaked from my ass. 

Mr. Singer stopped touching me as the Colonel entered with his boy. The young man, perhaps my age or only a year older, was tall but gangly. His face was not unpleasant, but his long nose was crocked, as though he&#8217;d been in (and lost) his share of fistfights. His blond hair was a wet mess on top of his head. He smiled uncertainly, looking me over as I sat up.

�My little whore loves to play,� Mr. Singer said, running a gentle hand through my hair. �I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;d like to play with her, wouldn&#8217;t you, boy?�

�Yes, sir,� the boy said.

�What is your name, boy?� Mr. Singer asked.

�William Mosley, sir,� the boy responded, not taking his eyes off of me. I stretched luxuriously, allowing him a generous view of my pert (but small, too small for Mr. Singer&#8217;s taste, I fear) breasts. I noted the generous bulge in his trousers; he was not such a little boy, after all.

�Billy,� Mr. Singer said, �why don&#8217;t you come over here and spend a little time with my whore? Lady Emily would love to make your acquaintance.�

Young Billy approached me slowly, his clumsy, large hand absently rubbing his crotch as he advanced. Mr. Singer and the Colonel watched for a time as I beckoned the boy to me. �Come here, young man,� I said, cocking my finger. When he stood beside the bed, I got up on my knees and wrapped my arms around his neck, kissing him deeply.

The clumsy boy was as inexperienced as I had anticipated, but I kissed him slowly, enjoying the way that his hands trembled as he carefully touched my waist. I touched his face and smiled at him. �Want to fuck me, Billy?� I asked softly.

He stammered unintelligibly, and I put two gentle fingers to his lips, laughing softly at him. He reminded me of myself, just a few months ago, when I was so innocent. I thought I knew the ways of love and sex, but having experienced it (time and again) these past few months, I know how ignorant I really was. I would gently indoctrinate this young man. 

�You can fuck me in my ass, Billy,� I said sweetly. �Would you like that?�

�Y-yes, my l-l-lady,� he stammered uneasily. I pulled down his trousers and grabbed his cock (fair-sized; it certainly would add to my discomfort) in my hand and gave it a gentle tug.

�Big boy,� I whispered. I unbuttoned the jacket of his uniform, and he grabbed the bottom and tore it quickly off of his arms, tossing it aside. He seemed to realize what he was being offered, and he was eager to begin. I allowed him to prepare himself as I got down on all four again. I briefly spotted Mr. Singer and the Colonel; my master had, indeed, decided to take fallacio from the old man, and when he saw me glancing over at him, he grinned and threw me a wink.

I assumed the position, and the boy got behind me. �Take your time, Billy,� I said, sensing his hesitation. �I&#8217;m ready for you when you are.�

He put his hands uneasily on my hips. I pushed back against him, encouraging him as I felt his cock tentatively entering my asshole. �Oh, God, Billy,� I moaned, �You are so huge. Fuck me hard, Billy!� I had forgotten my pain, so excited was I to claim the innocence of this young boy.

He thrust into me easily, going too slowly. �Oh, come, Billy, harder!� I encouraged him.

�I&#8217;m�I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ll hurt you,� he confessed, continuing to thrust slowly, carefully.

I had to laugh. I had taken bigger than him in my ass�just minutes before! �Don&#8217;t worry, Billy, you&#8217;d never hurt me,� I cooed, and he began to get into it.

He did not last long�of course not, young boy that he was. I felt him come, and I said, �Billy, will you clean my asshole, please?�

�Of course, my lady, I&#8217;ll fetch a towel��

�No, no, silly boy,� I said, pushing my ass towards him again. �With your tongue. It will make me feel so good. Please?�

�Yes, my lady.� The boy complied, putting his tongue to my asshole and lapping up the cum (now his, and the Colonel&#8217;s from before) with gentle laps, like a small dog. I giggled as he finished cleaning me, and I turned over again, leaning back and looking up at him with hooded eyes.

�Oh, that was so nice, Billy,� I said, smiling at the still-shocked look on his face. �Come here and give me a little kiss.�

He gave me a crooked grin, and fell upon me, kissing me a bit more roughly than before, his hands feeling the roundness of my small breasts, toying with the clips. As his hands snaked down my stomach, I said, �No, no, Billy. You can&#8217;t touch me there.�

He immediately put up his hands. �I&#8217;m sorry, my lady.� But I smiled at him and pulled him back down on me, kissing him deeply. I closed my eyes, and for a moment, the boy was gone. Then, I was being kissed again, this time by my Mr. Singer. I opened my eyes and smiled at him.

�Well, my lady,� he said, �we can be off now. Ready?�

I nodded, and he helped me to sit up. The boy was already gone from the room as I dressed hastily, ducking into the lavatory to check my hair. It amazed me how quickly we went from being in the throws of passion to being on our way. The Colonel, blushing still from the treatment, brought me the bouquet of flowers. �My carriage is waiting. It will take us to the gravesite, and I will direct you to the grave before I depart.�

�You will not join us?� I asked, and I had to admit, I was disappointed.

Mr. Singer smiled. �I think we&#8217;ll make this little visit on our own.� I nodded; he always knows what is best, and besides, it was his father&#8217;s grave. 

The Colonel&#8217;s closed carriage took us to a crowded Christina graveyard, well landscaped. Most of the plots in the front were covered in bouquets of fresh flowers. �If my memory serves me, your father&#8217;s grave is under a large tree in the left corner,� the Colonel said, pointing toward the back of the cemetery.

The Colonel and Mr. Singer shook hands, and I said goodbye before Mr. Singer handed me down from the carriage. We watched them leave before Mr. Singer took me by the hand. �Thank you, Emily,� he said. �You have made me feel much better this morning. I&#8217;m very glad that you&#8217;re here with me.�

Silent and sober, we made our way as directed, and found the grave with much more ease than we had anticipated. Mr. Avery Singer III&#8217;s grave was simple, merely stating his name and the years of his life. But it was well-kept. I laid the flowers down on the grass before it as Mr. Singer stood in silence.

I said a quiet prayer for the soul of Mr. Singer&#8217;s father, but moreso for my master himself. He put an arm around me, and we stood that way for some time, not speaking. After a time, Mr. Singer said, �All right. I am through here.�

I was surprised, for I had expected Mr. Singer to give some sort of eulogy, or to make some sort of speech, about his late father. But it seemed that, between talking to me at dawn and the Colonel late in the morning, he had exhausted himself on the subject of his father. So I said nothing as we left the cemetery with relative haste, and when we were back on the streets again, Mr. Singer seemed to be in a much brighter mood. And this bright mood remained all through the day, as we toured the city, returning to our lodgings to dress for dinner with the Colonel. That evening was quite eventful (though the boy did not join us, much to my disappointment).

But it seems I have run out of time. The corridor of the train has been relatively quite outside my door for some time. But I can hear footsteps approaching, and perhaps the sound of a young woman giggling. My Mr. Singer was successful in acquiring the company of the woman he&#8217;d spotted in the dining car, then; I will have this pick this up another time.


4 August, 18&#8212;

I do not have much time to write, but I want to record this and remember it for all of my life. This evening, I married the only man whom I have ever loved, a man who has cared for me all of my life and would do anything to make me happy. And I am so happy. If my dear and loving husband reads this entry: I love you. I am yours for life. 


7 August, 18&#8212;

I wish to record as many details of my wedding as I can remember, though my mind is muddled with the events leading to it, surround it, and following it. Goodness! I feel as though I&#8217;ve lived an entire life these past few days. But make no mistake: I am still as happy as I was when I wrote my last gushing entry. 

After several days in Mumbai (where my master and I visited more Buddhist temples, the shrines of Elephanta Island, St. Thomas&#8217;s, and the High Court; we also viewed the glorious sunset off of the harbor, so indescribably beautiful it was! We also bedded two gorgeous Indian women whom I had seduced at a club near the harbor), we caught the train to Calcutta and were greeted, yet again, by Mr. Morrison and his carriage. He greeted me with a kiss on the cheek and a pat on the rump. After he and Mr. Singer shook hands, we headed back to their now-familiar house.

Mrs. Morrison greeted me warmly, embracing me and kissing me on the cheek. �My dear, I have scheduled for a dressmaker to come and see us this afternoon. Have you been considering any designs for your dress?�

Mrs. Morrison had sent me away with several wedding dress design books, and I had looked through them dutifully to find my perfect wedding gown, promising to run my top choices past her. When I answered in the affirmative, she whisked me away to the parlor to comb over my choices.

I showed Mrs. Morrison my favorite cut, a long-sleeved gown with a sheer neckline that would be demure enough for a church ceremony, but chic enough to satisfy my tastes. Mrs. Morrison concurred that I had chosen well, and prior to the dressmaker&#8217;s arrival, she had a large lunch served to us right there in the parlor. �You&#8217;ll be wearing your dress at your wedding feast, so you&#8217;ll want to get a true size. Eat up, my dear,� Mrs. Morrison instructed, and I did so, hungry as I was from the train, and glad when Mrs. Morrison had English-style sandwiches served. 

I was afraid that Mrs. Morrison would again declare her love for me, but all went smoothly until after the day of the wedding. The wedding was so lovely, a simple little affair, really. Mr. and Mrs. Morrison invited friends of theirs to attend, so the church was moderately filled with almost perfect strangers. Still, as I stood with Mr. Morrison at the alter, and looked into his loving eyes, I saw no one but him. 

The ceremony itself, I can hardly recall. There were lilies at the front of the church, and candles lit throughout. The setting sun shown through the stain-glass windows, and the colored light was dancing on the opposite walls of the church. The vicar was a small British man, and his performance of the ceremony was not spectacular. But it did not matter. The moment that I remember most is when, after we were declared man and wife, Mr. Singer threw up my veil and kissed me deeply, much moreso than would typically be appropriate in a church.

Though I flushed, I was pleased as Mr. Singer and I departed from the church together. We took a private (and fortunately, closed) carriage back to the Morrisons&#8217;; but first, Mr. Singer instructed the driver to circle about the city, so that we could consummate our marriage right away. Mr. Singer pushed me against the side of the carriage, pulling down the shades to ensure our privacy.

�Well, my wife,� he said, wearing his wicked grin, �there is no backing out now. You are mine, forever.�

�As it should be,� I responded, and this pleased him. He kissed me roughly, pulling the long skirt of my wedding gown up. He battled with the petticoats and garters, but finally had sufficient access to my cunt. I was buried in a sea of white silk as my husband fucked me, forcing my thighs apart as he had his way with me. I was trapped beneath the dress, so it was up to my master to do the work. But he did not fail in pleasing me�I don&#8217;t think he ever could.

We finally arrived back at the Morrisons, and they were waiting with our guests and our feast. We ate and drank and laughed for hours. When the four of us were all alone again, I wondered if Mr. Singer would want us all to play together again. But no; he took me by the hand and said, �Come, my bride. Tonight is our night.�

And oh, it was our night!

Mr. Singer surprised me the next day with some news. �Our ship will be departing on Friday,� he said, as he lay beside me in bed.

�Yes, sir,� I said. I already knew this bit of information.

�We won&#8217;t be going right home,� Mr. Singer said, and that was the surprise.

�We&#8217;re not?�

Mr. Singer shook his head. �No, my dear. We&#8217;re going to take our honeymoon first.�

�This trip to India was not our honeymoon?�

�Of course not,� Mr. Singer said. �We&#8217;ve only just married, and our trip is about to end. No, Emily, I want to take you someplace very special. Would you like to spend a month in Greece?�

�Oh, yes!� I cried. �Sir, that would be wonderful.� Mr. Singer knew of my life-long interest in ancient Greek culture. He had fed me books on the subject of their mythology, their philosophers, their city-states and wars, and I was fascinated. Finally, I would get to see some of the places that I&#8217;d read about in the books. And I&#8217;d always imagined Greece to be so beautiful, especially after my good friend Miss Tatiana Howard (whose mother is half-Greek half-Russian) visited family there years ago and bragged all about it in my presence!

Oh! I shall write to my friend now. I am bursting to tell someone everything that has happened. I shall censor much of it for now, of course, but if I can trust anyone with the information, it is my good friend. And, she will have the benefit of learning the identity of my mysterious new husband before any of our other friends, and would so relish to be able to spread it all around, as I will give her leave to do that much. 

One thing does weigh heavily on my mind now, and it is Mrs. Morrison. Since the wedding, she has been quiet, almost sullen, not at all her cheerful, chatty self. But I am determined not to take it to heart; I will focus on my happiness, at the beginning of what will (God willing) be a long and happy marriage.










Mr. Singer

During the first few months of marriage to my Lady Emily, I was happier than I ever thought I could be. She was sweeter than ever, and so willing and obedient. Any time I wanted her, she was ready and waiting for me. It was so tempting to push her boundaries everyday, but I knew that some days I had to be easy on her. But she never refused my requests; she performed well beyond my expectations of her, and I was quite proud.

Our honeymoon in Greece, in my memory, is a blur of sandy beaches, sights, and unbelievable sex. We met another honeymooning couple, from Holland, while we were staying in Crete. Lady Emily speaks a little Dutch, which they found charming, though they spoke English well enough. I do not remember their names, and we did not keep up correspondence with them, but it does not matter. That young married couple, both tall and lean and blonde, drank with us during and after dinner one warm evening, and we all went back to our honeymoon suite together. As Emily and the young woman took off their clothes and began kissing heavily, I turned to the young man and threw him a wink. He looked uncertain, but his cock certainly wasn&#8217;t; he had a generous bulge in his pants.

�What do you say?� I asked the young man. �Want to watch my wife pleasure your wife?� Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Emily eyeing me expectantly.

The young man was enthusiastically agreeable, and we watched Emily lay the other young bride down on the bed. �Just relax,� Emily said softly. �Has your husband given you an orgasm yet?� When the woman responded that she did not know, Emily smiled. �Then he has not; I may be able to show him a trick or two.� She turned and looked at us over her shoulder. She beckoned to the young groom. �Come and see,� she said invitingly.

We both stepped forward and watched Emily go down on the other woman. �Oh, your pussy has no hair on it!� Emily observed with a giggle. �So soft�� I grabbed my cock as I watched my wife stroke the lips of the bride&#8217;s pussy gently. After spending a minute or two fingering the bride (who was already breathing heavily, probably more in anticipation than pain, as her new husband had a generous sized cock himself), Emily put her head between the bride&#8217;s legs and lapped at her carefully, aiming at the bride&#8217;s clit. She swirled her tongue in slow, teasing circles before plunging it into the bride&#8217;s cunt, lapping at the walls of her pussy, pushing her head deeper and deeper into her crotch while prying her legs wider and wider apart.

The bride cried out in surprised pleasure, and I looked at her husband with a grin. �That&#8217;s how it&#8217;s done,� I said to him, as we watched Emily eat the other woman to an intense climax. As the bride came, Emily opened her mouth wide and covered her pussy with it, so that she took most of the bride&#8217;s cum in her mouth, licking her thoroughly to clean what was left.

As the bride recovered from her orgasm, I asked her husband if she had ever gone down on him. He answered that she had not, looking disappointed by this fact, perhaps wishing that his young bride were a whore like mine. �We can teach her,� I said. �My wife is quite an expert cocksucker, aren&#8217;t you, my dear?�

�Yes, sir,� she said. She had been wiping the cum from her face with a towel. She stood up and gave the groom a sweet smile. She brightened suddenly. �Oh, sir, I have an idea! I can show her how to suck cock by showing her on you, and she can copy what I&#8217;m doing on her husband.�

�Marvelous,� I said. I nodded to the groom, and we stood side by side, pulling down our trousers to reveal our hard cocks. I examined his, of course. Most men are not comfortable with this, but everyone looks; some people are just sneakier about it. I was pleased to see that while he had a generous-sized cock, perhaps good enough for his little wife, I was certainly the larger. I do not like that I need this reassurance about the size of my cock; the satisfied smile on my wife&#8217;s face every time I fucked her should have been enough.

Emily took the bride by the hand and led her to us, not hesitating to get down on her knees before me. The bride did hesitate, and Emily turned to look back at her. �What&#8217;s the matter?� she asked.

The bride frowned. �I don&#8217;t want to,� she said. �It�it&#8217;s disgusting.�

Emily frowned up at the bride and stood up. �That&#8217;s very selfish,� she said. �Your husband just allowed you to get pleasure. Didn&#8217;t you like what I did to you?�

The bride blushed. �Yes,� she said slowly.

�And your husband will be willing to do that to you, I&#8217;m sure, if you&#8217;ll do this for him,� Emily lectured. She gave me a smile. �Trust me, when you get better at it, it feels just as good to give as to receive.�

I reached out and grabbed Emily, pulling her to me and kissing her deeply. I touched her face before putting my hands on her shoulders, half-forcing her to her knees (she was already dropping to her subordinate position), and she took my cock in her mouth, sucking with more enthusiasm than ever. I have noticed that, when other people were around, Emily performed fallacio even better than when we were alone. It wasn&#8217;t that she was trying to show off; not exactly. It was more for the fact that having people watch her please me just excited her. If she didn&#8217;t get off on it so much, I perhaps would not have allowed so many people to join us in our activities.

I watched the bride hesitantly following suit, taking her husband&#8217;s cock in her mouth as she watched Emily out of the corner of her eye. Emily&#8217;s focus was on me, as it usually was when she pleasured me. I looked down at her and she was looking up at me, thoroughly enjoying her chore. I threw my head back and moaned as Emily took me as deep as she could; I could feel the tip of my cock lodging deep into her through, my balls against her chin. I put a hand to the back of her head, tempted to begin pumping into her frantically. But I held myself; Emily was teaching her new friend an important lesson.

The young man was groaning aloud as his wife got into her task. I smiled to myself. She had discovered the joy of being a cock-sucking whore, a joy that too few women experience. As the young man&#8217;s breathing grew heavier, I knew he would be coming soon. �Have your wife take it down her throat,� I instructed. �Don&#8217;t let her pull away; it&#8217;s good for her.�

The young man heeded my word, grabbing the back of his wife&#8217;s head and forcing himself deep into her as he moaned and came. �Now she is to clean you with her tongue,� I said, and as they finished up, I focused on my own whore, who needed no lessons or instruction anymore.

When Emily squeezed my testicles (the naughty girl had learned my weaknesses), I came. She cleaned me slowly, demonstrating for her student how to carefully lick up every drop of cum. When she was finished, she looked up at me with an expectant smile. I was pleased to see that her student was looking at her husband in the same way.

From Crete, Emily and I went on the Athens, and toured much of the country in that area. By the time we were on the ship, finally headed back to London, Emily looked tired from all of our adventures. �Oh, sir,� she said, on the first day of our voyage back, �I&#8217;ll be so glad to be home again.�

�Have you not thoroughly enjoyed yourself on this trip, my dear?� I asked.

�Oh, yes, sir, I certainly have,� she said. �But I miss Wainwright Hall. And I miss my friends. And I cannot wait to show you off to everyone!�

�Silly thing,� I said, �they all know me.�

�Yes,� she said slowly, �but they do not know you as Sir Aaron Singer of Wainwright. And,� she added with a giggle, �I can&#8217;t wait to see how jealous all your admirers are that you are my husband.�

We made a couple of friends on our trip, two young cousins who were traveling to London to work in the shipping yards. They were traveling in the lower class of the passenger ship, and we might not have met them at all if my sweet Emily had not spotted them whilst taking a solitary walk on the deck. She saw these young men eyeing her, not daring to speak to a fine lady as she. So they had been surprised when she had turned and given them her attentions.

It was Emily&#8217;s first time with three men at once, and I surprised my little wife by having all three of us fuck her at once (me taking her cunt, of course; it was, and was meant to always be, mine and mine alone), filling her fuck-holes with our eager sex. I even allowed the young men to take turns taking my wife over their knees and spanking her. This inspired me to try a new, fun punishment for my girl. I pulled my belt from my trousers. She has been beaten with a belt before, but not quite the way I had intended. I sat beside one of the young men on the bed; the other stood by the watched.

�Lady Emily,� I said to my wife, whose ass was already sore from punishment, �lie across this young man&#8217;s lap and put your face to my crotch.�

�Yes, sir,� she said, almost cheerfully, doing as she was told. I handed the belt to the young man.

�Whip her ass,� I said. �Stop when I tell you to, or when you see blood. Understand?�

The young man nodded, and delivered the first blow to Emily&#8217;s ass. She screamed, and I put my hand on her head, pushing her face against my cock. I felt the vibrations of her screams against my hard member with each fresh scream. The young man showed no mercy on my whore, and as he continued to beat her, I allowed her to put her face up for a quick breath before pulling down my trousers, revealing my hard cock. �Suck, my lady,� I instructed, and she did so. She was unable to stop herself from moaning each time her ass was struck, and would scream with my cock in her mouth. I felt just the slightest brush of her teeth against my sensitive skin, enough to make me groan.

�Stop, stop,� I groaned to the young man, and he did, with some regret on his face, as I came into my wife&#8217;s mouth.

We had other times together such as that, which distracted Emily (a little) from her anxiousness to be home again. When we arrived in London, Emily convinced me to get us to the train station right away. We were very fortunate; a train that would be stopping in a village near Wainwright Hall was departing that very hour. We did not secure a first-class compartment, but Emily did not mind. She spent the entire trip looking out of the window, as though she couldn&#8217;t quite believe that she&#8217;d made it back to England.

I took her hand at one point and whispered in her ear, �It has not changed much since we&#8217;ve been away.�

She looked at me and smiled. �No,� she agreed. �But I have.� She squeezed my hand gently, and we sat hand-in-hand for the remainder of the train ride.

When we finally arrived, Emily nearly leapt from the train, so happy was she to see familiar sights again. Right way, she noticed people that she knew at the train station, who were already flocking to her just as I was climbing down from the train to join her. I came and put my arm around her waist, smiling for our acquaintances.

�We want to be the first to congratulate you on your marriage,� Miss Albertson, a wealthy middle-aged spinster known for her loose tongue, gushed to us. �Everyone has been saying what a wonderful match this is indeed.�

�Truly?� Emily said. �I rather thought that people would be surprised.�

�At first, many were,� Miss Albertson&#8217;s companion, the widow Garrett, said. �But the general consensus is that you have both married well. A successful, wealthy, charming man and his titled, beautiful, young wife.� She and Miss Albertson both sighed.

Emily seemed much relieved by this news as we made our way to the carriage station. We would have to rent a carriage to take us to Wainwright Hall, as our servants had been expecting us the following day. But before we made it inside, we were accosted by none other than Emily&#8217;s friend, Miss Tatiana Howard.

Ah, Miss Howard. My wife had told me many wild stories about that young lady, and I could verify for a fact that many of them were true. Only the fact that her father was very wealthy kept her reputation in tact; were she a common villager with her openly whorish habits, she would be shunned by the community. Not that she cared much for reputation, not like my Emily. I knew that we would not be able to be as open and free as we were on our trip, but perhaps we had at least one willing friend to join our fun�

�Well, well!� the young lady called, �if it isn&#8217;t Sir and Lady Singer of Wainwright!� She and my wife embraced warmly before she turned her flirtatious eyes upon me. All of Emily&#8217;s young lady friends have been friendly to me, but Miss Howard most of all. �When did these newlyweds get into town?� she asked.

�Just a moment ago,� Emily said. �We will need to rent a carriage to get home now.�

�Nonsense!� Miss Howard declared. �My carriage and driver are waiting for me. I&#8217;ve just been to see a friend,� she explained, pointing to what were clearly a bachelor&#8217;s quarters above the bakery. �Let me take you home. I&#8217;d love to hear all about your trip!�

So we took up Miss Howard&#8217;s offer, and we rode the six kilometers to Wainwright Hall together in her carriage. All the way, Emily chattered away happily with her friend, telling her of all of the sights of India and Greece, and telling about the wedding in Calcutta. 

�There have been some exciting events here at home as well,� Miss Howard said. �My baby sister is wed!�

�Beatrice?� Emily asked. �To whom?�

�Why, to your old favorite suitor, Mr. Gainsley,� Miss Howard answered. I searched my wife&#8217;s face for her reaction; would she be upset? But no; her face even brightened at the news.

�Oh, I&#8217;m so glad,� Emily said. �They had courted for so long.�

�Well,� Miss Howard said, �I must be honest and tell you that I don&#8217;t like it one bit. And not just for the fact that my father is now asking me when I will finally be wed.�

�What&#8217;s the matter?� Emily asked.

�It happened so soon after you left,� Miss Howard explained. �When his sister returned from her trip, word got around that you were betrothed, but had not said to whom, only divulging this information to Mr. Gainsley.� Miss Howard said the last pointed, with a bit of hurt in her voice.

�We wanted to keep it a secret,� I explained. �My wife felt it necessary to tell Mr. Gainsley as a courtesy, so he would not waste time waiting for her hand any longer.�

Miss Howard nodded. �Well, he certainly did not wait any longer�not at all! He asked for my sister&#8217;s hand not a day after your departure; I did not even learn of your own engagement until after they&#8217;d already wed. I feel like my sister, and I, and our entire family, have been tricked.�

�Well,� Emily observed, �it&#8217;s not like there&#8217;s anything to be done for it now. I have seen the two of them together; he dotes on her. I&#8217;m sure it will all be well.�

 But Miss Howard shook her head, her agitation deepening. �He is much changed since they have wed. I see the way that your husband looks on you with adoring eyes, Lady Emily, and it is not the same for them. No; he is rather rude to her. My fine baby sister does not deserve that treatment!�

Emily did not know what to say to that, nor did I. Emily would confess to me later that she was gladder than ever that she had not married Mr. Gainsley, if he would have been a negligent husband to her. I did not realize, at that time, that this would only be the start of a different kind of drama, but it would not come to its frightening conclusion for several more years. I only felt contempt in my heart for Mr. Gainsley; I knew that Mrs. Gainsley was as lovely as her elder sister, and her cad of a husband did not treasure her as he should have.

We invited Miss Howard for dinner, but she declined. �We are hosting a visiting cousin, and I am expected home to sup with them,� she said. �Oh! But I shall inform my parents of your arrival back in town. I&#8217;m sure that they will be eager to be the first to host the newlyweds.� In fact, when she sent her driver back with the message of our arrival, she received word back that we were absolutely to come to dinner that evening, and no excuse would be accepted for our absence.

I nearly declined, concerned as I was for my dear wife, but her energy seemed renewed. �May we go?� she asked softly. I answered in the affirmative, and we set out in our own carriage to the Howard family home. We had been there many times before, as guests for dinner or parties, but never as man and wife. We were making our debut into society so soon, and as we rode along (Miss Howard ahead of us, in her own carriage), my wife confessed her anxiety to me.

�Not to worry, my dear,� I said. �If those old biddies at the station could receive us so warmly, I&#8217;ve no doubt that our friends will be most welcoming.� She nodded and was silent for the remainder of the trip, but the worried expression remained on her face.

We arrived at the Howard estate, and I helped my wife down from our carriage. Miss Howard led the way into the house, and when we entered, we found a group of our old friends waiting for us in anticipation. Mr. and Mrs. Howard were close acquaintances of mine, especially since I had assisted Mr. Howard in some legal trouble years back. They smiled and greeted us. Mrs. Howard kissed Lady Emily&#8217;s cheek while Mr. Howard shook my hand.

�A good match, indeed,� Mrs. Howard said, echoing the sentiments of the ladies at the station. To Emily, she added, �You&#8217;ll never have any doubt that he can properly take care of you.�

�Well said,� Lady Emily replied. 

�Lady Emily, Sir Aaron, you must remember my eldest nephew, Mr. Patrick Culver,� Mrs. Howard said, presenting the handsome, dark-haired young man. I did not remember him at all.

Emily, who always had very good memory for faces and names, said, �Yes, of course. We met here at the Christmas party last year. It is a pleasure to see you again,� she said, presenting her hand. I knew that she found him attractive, but I fought the urge to encourage a flirtation. We had to tread lightly, for the sake of our reputation.

The final members of the part were Mr. and Mrs. Gainsley themselves. Mr. Gainsley greeted my Emily with more warmth than I found to be appropriate, but I said nothing. Emily smiled, and allowed him to kiss her hand, but I could sense her discomfort. I stood close to her as I shook the man&#8217;s hand. He nodded to me coldly after speaking his congratulations; he had not forgotten that on our last meeting, I had threatened to shoot him.

Mrs. Gainsley greeted Lady Emily last of all. �It is so good to see you again,� the young newlywed said softly. I did remember the younger Howard sister being the quieter one, but she did seem sad. It was obvious to all in attendance, and I felt discomfort in the air, intensified with Mr. Gainsley&#8217;s attentions to my wife as he ignored his own.

Lady Emily remained cheerful in her greeting. �Mrs. Gainsley, I&#8217;m so thrilled for you. Congratulations, to the both of you,� she said.

We were led into the parlor for drinks. Hanging back, my wife put a hand on my shoulder to gain my attention. In my ear she whispered, �Do not leave me alone. I am afraid that Mr. Gainsley may wish to confront me.�

I nodded. �You just stay right by my side, my dear. I&#8217;ll protect you.�

She smiled a bit more easily. �Thank you, sir.�

It did seem that Mr. Gainsley was eager for my wife&#8217;s attentions, but as I remained at her side, he kept his distance, instead sitting on the other side of the room while Emily regaled the entire party with her stories of our travels. She chose the most charming, parlor-appropriate anecdotes, telling of the time we were lost in Mumbai on the way back to our hotel, how there were no carriage drivers in sight, and how no one on the street seemed to know a word of English. �Strangely,� she said in comical thoughtfulness, �some of them had no problem hurling insults at our backs in English as we hurried off to find someone more helpful.� 

The evening continued without issue, and we enjoyed a pleasant meal among friends. Mr. Howard got me up-to-date on some business dealings in town that occurred during my absence, alerting me to a couple of possible clients. Things would be getting back to normal; I would go back to work, and Emily would continue to study and socialize (though without the courting, of course). We had been happy before. But, I reminded myself with a smile, things would be all the sweeter, now that we were truly together.

We begged off after dinner, and made our way home again. Emily seemed anxious again. �What troubles you now, my lady?� I asked patiently. 

She shook her head. �That poor, dear girl,� she said. �I don&#8217;t believe that her husband looked at her once the entire time we were there. And when we were having a conversation, the three of us and Miss Howard, Mr. Gainsley made the most rude comment about a question that his wife asked of me. He called her ignorant. Right there, at the table. I never knew the man to be such a bully.�

�My dear,� I said, �I know that you do not wish to see your friend in such a position. But it is not your place to worry so. Mrs. Gainsley chose to marry him; she is the one who must deal with the consequences.�

�But if he showed her a false face whilst courting her,� she argued, �then it is not her fault.�

�Regardless,� I said, �it is still not your concern. Besides, Emily, you do not know what two people are like behind closed doors. He may be very sweet and kind to her when they are alone�you don&#8217;t really have a way of knowing this, do you?�

�No, sir,� my wife admitted.

�Consider ourselves as an example,� I continued (though I&#8217;d already won the argument). �You and I have a certain image that we wish to maintain in front of our friends here. Do you think that any of them would suspect, would even begin to dream, of our private activities? Of the things that we did on our little trip?�

Emily giggled this time, coming back to herself. �No, sir,� she repeated.

I put my arm around her and kissed her softly. �Emily,� I said, �I want to tie you up when we get home. I&#8217;m going to tie you to the bed and fuck you until you&#8217;re numb. Is that agreeable to you, my dear?�

She giggled again. �Yes, sir.�


A couple of months after our return to Wainwright Hall, I asked my wife at breakfast one morning, �My dear, when are you going to invite Miss Howard to play with us?�

Emily gave me a look of surprise. �You desire her, sir?�

�Not quite,� I said. �I desire to watch you with her. Do not tell me that the thought hasn&#8217;t crossed your mind.�

�Yes, sir,� she admitted. �I&#8217;ve been mulling it over, sir. I just�I just do not know how to go about it.�

�Miss Howard is a straight-forward young woman,� I said. �I&#8217;m sure that if you just came out with it, she would be most willing.�

My wife nodded with resolve. �All right,� she said. �I&#8217;m going to be meeting her for our ride later in the morning. I shall discuss the matter with her then.�

I rose from my chair to go to my office for a few hours of work. I kissed my wife softly before departing. �Express to her that we are both most eager to have her company. Encourage her to come right away; I will be in my office.�

I certainly was not bored with my wife, but I had been noticing, when we were in the company of Miss Howard, that she would sometimes have a look of longing in her eyes. She wanted her friend; I wanted her to have her friend. I will not deny that I found Miss Howard to be a very sexy young woman. She had a full chest, almost the largest I&#8217;d ever seen on a girl with such a trim waist. She did not have my beloved&#8217;s full hips, and stood almost a head taller than she. 

I never loved Miss Howard, but I did want to fuck her. I longed to shove my cock between her tits and cover her chest and face in my cum. A wild whore like her deserved such treatment. I wondered if she would take to be slapped around a bit.

Needless to say, I did not get much work completed in my office that morning, as I fantasized and waited for the girls to arrive. They did not keep me waiting for long; Emily&#8217;s familiar soft knocking stirred me from my thoughts at half-past ten, and I called them in.

My wife and Miss Howard entered the room. Emily looked a little flustered; Miss Howard looked excited. Neither said a thing as they approached my desk. I did not stand to greet them; I merely sat back and gave them a smile. �Good morning, ladies,� I said. �What can I do for you?�

�Sir Aaron, your wife has just informed me of your�invitation,� Miss Howard said. She narrowed her eyes and moistened her lips carefully. She knew exactly what she was doing, the little slut. �I am so honored�I only wish that the offer had been extended sooner.�

�My lady,� I said to my wife, �Would you mind going down to the kitchen and requesting tea?�

�Of course, sir,� Emily said, leaving the office briefly and closing the door behind her, leaving Miss Howard and I alone. I beckoned to the young lady, and she came and took a seat across from me at my desk, gazing at me steadily.

�Miss Howard,� I said, �what do you think of my wife?�

�Oh, Lady Emily is my very best friend,� Miss Howard said sincerely. �She is the kindest person that I know.�

�All true,� I agreed. �Do you find her attractive?�

Miss Howard blushed, her gaze shifting momentarily. �She is beautiful. I have always envied her little figure and her complexion.� 

�Miss Howard,� I said, �has my wife explained to you how I have helped her to become a whore?�

Miss Howard brightened. �Oh, yes,� she said, laughing a little. Not a dainty giggle, like my Emily, but a hearty laugh. �I never would have thought! Sweet Lady Emily�but she was never scandalized by my stories. She is one of the few people that I trust.�

�And she trusts you,� I said softly. �I raised her to be proud, and she has enjoyed a spotless reputation in our community. She wishes to keep it so; I believe that to be the cause of her hesitation in inviting you to join us. So before I allow you to do so, would you swear to me that you will keep the activities performed and discussed in Wainwright Hall to yourself?�

Miss Howard looked a little startled by my serious tone, but she suddenly laughed again. �Of course,� she said. �I can be discreet when I wish to be.�

�You are not so discreet in many of your personal activities,� I noted, perhaps harshly. But she took it in stride.

�I choose to take the company of men who sometimes have loose lips,� she said. She shrugged carelessly. �It does me no good to practice discretion in some situations, when the truth will be known, anyway. I may not care for my reputation as my good friend does, but I understand her, Sir Aaron. Her secrets, as well as yours, are safe in my care.�

I had to smile. I could not wonder, then, why Miss Howard and my sweet Emily had been such close friends all of these years. �Very well,� I said, just as Emily came back into the room.

�Tea will be along, presently,� she said, perching herself on the arm of her friend&#8217;s chair.

�Well, my dear,� I said, �Miss Howard and I were having a nice little chat about some of the things that we may wish to do to you.�

�Have you?� Emily asked.

�Oh, yes,� I said. �Miss Howard, why don&#8217;t you tell my wife what you have in mind for her?�

Miss Howard seemed to glow as she stroked Emily&#8217;s arm. �I&#8217;d like to tie her to a chair, and put her feet up over her head, so that I might lick her asshole thoroughly.�

We waited until the tea had been brought in before preparing Emily. She threw off her riding dress without hesitation. Miss Howard, still clothed, stepped forward and ran a gentle finger down her friend&#8217;s side as she leaned in and kissed her softly. I sat down on the couch and watched them for a couple of minutes as they made out in front of me. Then, Miss Howard took Emily by the hand and led her to one of the armchairs. Emily sat down and waited.

�Sir Aaron, do you have anything handy with which I might tie your wife up?� Miss Howard asked.

I stood. �I always have something handy,� I said, and went to the closet to get some soft rope. When I came back to the girls, Miss Howard was toying with Lady Emily&#8217;s nipple clips. 

�These are even bigger than the ones I wear!� she remarked. I handed Miss Howard the rope and stood by to watch her tie up my wife. She tied my wife&#8217;s torso to the back of the armchair, with a length of rope above and directly below her chest, leaving her breasts beautifully exposed. My Emily smiled up at me, and I returned her look.

I helped Miss Howard to position Emily&#8217;s arms and legs. Emily put her arms straight up in the air, and with only a little difficulty, Miss Howard helped her to raise her legs up, so that her ankles were tied to her wrists. I stood behind the chair and put my hands around her bound wrist and ankles, helping her to hold them up with a bit more ease as Miss Howard went down on her.

Miss Howard wasted no time as she knelt in front of my wife, stabbing her tongue into her asshole. Emily gasped and squirmed, and as she began to pant heavily, I pulled a handkerchief from my pocket and shoved it into her mouth. We did not want to risk the housekeeper hearing us (though I knew, at that point, that our servants had to at least suspect our activities), but mostly, Emily&#8217;s muffled cries seemed to urge Miss Howard on and on as she continued to lick my wife&#8217;s ass crack, frequently wriggling her tongue back inside of her.

I snaked one hand down Emily&#8217;s thigh, and, leaning over the back of the chair, rubbed her clit roughly as her friend tongue-fucked her ass. Emily shuddered from the sensations, and from the strain of holding her arms and legs up so high, even with the help that I gave her. I slipped two fingers into her, and I watched the rhythm of Miss Howard&#8217;s tongue-thrusts, so that I could keep the same as I played with her cunt. As Miss Howard shoved her tongue in one last time, I did the same with three fingers; Emily screamed into her makeshift gag and came, just as Miss Howard pulled her tongue from her ass. Emily let out a small, almost dainty fart into her friend&#8217;s face, and as Emily moaned in embarrassment, I had to laugh.

I untied her wrists from her ankles and allowed her to relax�for the time being. Still restrained to the chair, but with her arms and legs free for movement, she wrapped her arms around Miss Howard as her friend climbed onto her lap. As they made out again, Miss Howard began to tear off her own dress. I helped her with the buttons in the back, and when she was naked, I stroked her back with my fingers.

Miss Howard&#8217;s complexion was a bit darker than most ladies in the area. Her skin was soft and well cared for, like my Emily&#8217;s, and I leaned in and kissed the back of her neck while the girls pressed their clipped tits together. I reached around and grabbed Miss Howard&#8217;s huge tits in my hands, groping and squeezing as I leaned over her shoulder and kissed my wife.

My wish to fuck Miss Howard&#8217;s tits came true as I pulled her down to the floor. I kept my suit on, only pulling down my pants as I straddled her waist and shoved my hard cock between her tits. I took her hands and put them to the sides of her breasts. �Squeeze them together,� I instructed, and grinning, the whore did so. I smashed into her tits, and with each thrust, she would squeeze them around my cock. Miss Howard started saying dirty things to me, but I didn&#8217;t find myself getting turned on by them as I did when my Emily is naughty. So I slapped a hand over her mouth and fucked her harder, relishing her muffled cries.

I turned to look up at my wife, who was fingering herself and watching us with great interest. �You need it, my dear?� I asked between ragged grunts.

�Oh, yes, sir,� she moaned, and I stood quickly from Miss Howard, forgetting her as I leaned into my wife. She wrapped her legs around my waist and her arms around my neck as I fucked her. She moaned in my ear, whispering, �Oh, sir, fuck me harder. Yes�thank you, sir, oh, fuck me.� 

I was sweating, my eyes nearly bulging from my head with each hard, almost painful thrust. My wife screamed as she came, again, and I came heavily into her, filling her. I would give my cum to Miss Howard&#8217;s face another day.

Miss Howard, not accustomed to being ignored, was laying on her side, looking up at us with her sexiest look, one that I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;d practiced in the mirror many, many times. I motioned for her to stand, and I untied my wife from the chair, having her stand up as well. 

�Miss Howard,� I said, �would you like Lady Emily to pleasure you?�

�Yes!� Miss Howard cried with enthusiasm, and I had her lie down on the couch before Emily positioned herself between her legs. As my Emily did her magic, I rubbed my cock until it was hard again (as I think back on it now, I do miss those days when my cock hardened so easily, on command; I am far from impotent, but I do lack the stamina now that I had years ago). I debated shoving my cock into Miss Howard&#8217;s waiting mouth, or my wife&#8217;s tight little ass. I decided to allow Miss Howard to please me; I knew she&#8217;d want to.

And she sucked me with enthusiasm, but with a surprising lack of skill, though perhaps this was due to the fact that my Emily was leading her to the most intense orgasm of her life yet. After she screamed around my cock and came in my wife&#8217;s face, I had to make her keep sucking until I was finished.

After everyone was clean and had come down from their respective orgasms, we all sat down for tea, still at a drinkable temperature as my naked wife served us. She sat upon my lap on the cum-stained armchair, while Miss Howard sat opposite us on the couch. After a minute or so, I said, �Well, Miss Howard? What did you think?�

Miss Howard looked at us both with that steady gaze. �That was quite fun,� she said, but her voice was not as steady as her look. �I, um�I would play with the two of you any time. Any time at all.� She furrowed her brow. �But I&#8217;m really not allowed to play with Lady Emily&#8217;s cunt?�

I shook my head. �Not you, or anyone else,� I said. �That is my rule.�

Miss Howard nodded. �Very well. But I&#8217;m happy to offer up my cunt to the both of you.�

�We appreciate the sentiment,� I said, and my wife nodded in agreement. �I&#8217;m sure that we&#8217;ll get much use out of you.� And so we did. For a while, Miss Howard&#8217;s frequent appearances in our home were a fun time for all of us. But after some time, I sensed that Miss Howard had an ulterior motive. Though she paid my wife as much attention as ever, I suspected that she was trying to get at me especially. She even tried hitting on me, several times, when Lady Emily wasn&#8217;t around. I had scolded her each time, reminding her that she was a playmate to both myself and my wife. �I do not allow her to play around without me, and I grant her the same courtesy,� I got tired of explaining.

Still, I did not suspect the hand that Miss Howard would have in later events. Had I suspected, had I known, would it have done any good? Perhaps�I will forever be haunted by the possibility. But I never did suspect; I was a blind fool.


Several months after we returned to Wainwright Hall, my wife and I had fallen into a comfortable routine. I was happy, thrilled, with the way things were going, and I didn&#8217;t want anything to change that. But there was one possibility that I had not considered, and when it happened, I reacted with less grace than I am proud to admit.

One afternoon, almost a year after my wife and I became lovers, she tapped on the door to my office. I called her in eagerly; I had been thinking of going off and finding her to take care of the erection that had crept upon me. As she entered, though, the troubled look on her face caused me to go limp. �My dear?� I asked. �Is something the matter?�

�Yes,� she said. She shook her head. �Well, no, I suppose nothing is the matter, but�something has happened.�

�Sit down, Emily,� I said, startled. �Tell me everything.�

But she did not sit. She came and stood in front of my desk. �I believe�I am certain�that I am with child.�

I do believe that my jaw dropped. �You&#8217;re pregnant?� I asked.

�You seem so surprised,� Emily teased, a smile on her face. �Come, sir, did your parents not teach you about��

�Yes, yes,� I said impatiently, and the smile dropped from my pretty wife&#8217;s face. �I just don&#8217;t believe this,� I whispered.

�Well, sir, it was inevitable,� Emily said carefully, perching on the corner of my desk. �You are not pleased?�

I looked my wife square in the face. �I can say, with full honesty, that I am most certainly not pleased, my dear.�

Her face crumpled. �But, sir��

I stood up and without a word, walked out of the room. I hurried up the stairs as my wife chased me, calling to me. �Sir! Please, sir, let&#8217;s sit down and discuss this. Sir, what are you doing?�

I went into our bedchamber and threw the lock. As my wife knocked on the door and pleaded with me to come out, I sought my riding boots in the closet. �Sir, please come out, please,� she called. 

�Leave me be, Emily!� I called, with more venom in my voice then I intended. She was silent, but I felt her presence just outside the door as I pulled the boots on. Grabbing my jacket, and I went to the door. My wife looked startled. �I&#8217;m going for a ride,� I said. �I will be back soon.�

Tears filled my wife&#8217;s eyes. I was tempted to scoop her in my arms and carry her to bed, and confess to her all of my fears. But my stomach churned at the thought. I needed to get away, I needed to think. Before my wife could say anything, I added, �Do not follow me, Emily. I shall be very angry if you do. Stay here and wait for me.�

�Yes, sir,� she said helplessly as a tear slipped down her cheek. I wiped it away tenderly before turning away from her and storming out of the house.

As I rode Emily&#8217;s favorite black stallion away from the grounds of Wainwright Hall, I thought about the troubles that had crowded my mind since Emily had given her announcement. I had somehow allowed myself to be in denial, to believe that Emily was incapable of getting pregnant. Whatever had given me the idea? It was a secret wish of mine, that my wife would be infertile and could never have a pregnancy.

There was only one thing that I feared in the world, and it was losing my sweet little wife. As strong and healthy as she was, she was very small. And her mother, of a similar build, had died in childbirth. What would prevent the same from happening to Emily? I did not think that I could give the motherless child the same love that Sir Peter had given to his daughter. I knew that I would regard such child as a killer, the person who had stolen my beloved away from me. 

I rode and rode for miles, stopping only to give the stallion a break. I tied him to a tree branch and sat beneath the same tree. It was a chilly afternoon for springtime, but the cool breeze felt refreshing as I sat and considered our new situation. There was nothing that I could do, I realized. Short of shoving her down the stairs and killing the child (and risking killing my dear wife in the process), the baby would come. When I forced myself to think on it, I realized that I&#8217;d suspected a pregnancy. I was, after all, very well in-touch with my wife&#8217;s body, including her menstrual cycles. Yes�she had skipped her time that past month, and very well could be pregnant.

As I looked up at the cloudy sky, I suddenly felt ashamed of myself. Poor Emily; she would have thought of all those things herself, surely. After all, her own birth had resulted in her own mother&#8217;s death, and she was well aware of the risks. 

But little babies are born to healthy, living mothers every day, I reminded myself. And times had changed; it had been nearly 19 years since Lady Anne&#8217;s death, and Dr. Yates surely had ways to help my wife through her labor. And I began to think of what it would be like to have a baby. I imagined my wife breast-feeding, and I liked that imagine, I liked it quite a bit. We would be our own little family. Sweet Emily had never had a real family; she&#8217;d only ever had me, her good friend, to love and care for her. And I had lost my father to grief and adventure when I was still a boy; I would never leave my wife or child alone, never, I promised myself as I sat under that tree.

I went home, thoroughly ashamed of myself for my behavior. I found my wife waiting patiently in my office. I thought she would have been crying, but she was clear-eyed and calm as I came in. �Hello, sir,� she said pleasantly. �Feeling better?�

�Much,� I said. I beckoned her to the couch. �Come and sit with me, my dear.� She took a seat on my lap, and I wrapped my arms around her tightly. I kissed her neck. �I&#8217;m so sorry, Emily,� I whispered.

�Why were you so upset?� she asked.

�I&#8217;m afraid, Emily,� I said. I looked into her eyes, and I didn&#8217;t need to explain myself any further. She nodded.

�I&#8217;m afraid, too, sir,� she confessed. �And I&#8217;m not just afraid to die. What if I&#8217;m a terrible mother?�

�Oh, Emily,� I sighed, �that is impossible.�

�Perhaps not,� she said. �I&#8217;m spoiled, and I always have to be the center of attention.�

�And you&#8217;re also loving and sweet,� I said, kissing her again. �I wouldn&#8217;t want any other woman to bear my children.�

�I need you, sir,� she said quietly. �I need you to be strong for all of us.� She began to cry again, and she put her face to my chest. I stroked her hair and let her cry for a while before I soothed her with an image.

�Imagine, my dear,� I said. �Our beautiful baby, with your green eyes and your dark, lovely hair.�

�The baby will look like you as well,� Emily said.

�God willing, it will get most of its look from its mother,� I said, and she smiled at that. �And you&#8217;ll sit right here, with our beautiful baby in your arms, and you&#8217;ll feed our child while I watch. And when little baby has been put down to sleep, I&#8217;ll put my lips to your bare nipple, and I&#8217;ll begin to suck��

Emily slowly pulled down the front of her dress, revealing her breasts. She had removed her nipple clips, in anticipation of her new role as a mother. I leaned down and, just as I said I would do, took her right nipple between my lips and sucked hungrily. It would be several months before her breasts would produce any milk, but I imagined drinking her sweetness, and I sucked harder. She sighed, running her hands through my hair as I sucked greedily, finally biting her nipple just a little. She moaned, and I bit her a little harder. Her grip on my hair tightened. 

I planted kisses on the tops of her soft breasts. �Your tits will grow,� I observed.

�Yes,� Emily said. �That&#8217;s a good thing. I know you&#8217;re not fully satisfied with my breasts��

�Foolish girl,� I scolded. �I am fully satisfied with you as you are. But,� I admitted, �it will be fun to have some larger breasts to knock around.� I reached out with both hands and groped her breasts, squeezing her in a clockwise motion as I kissed her mouth possessively. �You are my perfect little wife-slave, aren&#8217;t you, my dear?�

�Yes, sir,� she moaned, tilting her head back. 

�You will feed our child well,� I said, �but you will save some milk for me, won&#8217;t you?�

�Yes, sir,� she moaned again, and I kissed her neck, drawing her to me. She straddled my waist and rode me right there on the couch, bouncing against my thighs faster and faster as she took me deep up inside of her. She leaned in and whispered in my ear, �I&#8217;m having your baby, sir. Oh, God, yes, I want your babies, sir. Let me have your babies,� she moaned.

I was pleased; pregnancy was making my little whore of a wife hornier than ever. And the next few months would be a lot of fun. Watching my wife&#8217;s stomach expand was an erotic experience, and I found her sexier and sexier as she got bigger and bigger with our child. In fact, our best sex was during her pregnancies; looking at her tied to our bed, with her huge pregnant belly sticking up, turned me on more than I can describe. I was easier on her when it came to punishments, only using my bare hand or a paddle to slap her ass and thighs. She asked me to use the riding crop, but I refused; it didn&#8217;t seem right to viciously whip a woman with child.

Still, as our child came closer to being born, I was troubled by the possibility of my wife dying in childbirth. I kept these thoughts to myself; Emily was so happy, glowing with excitement as she came to her last couple of months of pregnancy. So I bit back my fears, and sometimes had to force a smile to keep her happy, secretly wishing that the pregnancy were over and that both my wife and child were well. But I also prayed (yes, actually prayed) that if one of them had to die, to have it be the child. As long as Emily was alive, all would be well.










Lady Emily&#8217;s Diary

28 November, 18&#8212;

It&#8217;s snowing heavily outside today, for the first time this season. I have been housebound (practically bed-bound) on the orders of my husband, who is so protective of me. In only a few weeks, I will have our child, and my poor dear husband is quite worried. He does not vocalize his concerns, but it is quite obvious. I humor him by staying in my bed all day, allowing him to personally cater to my needs and desires.

So here I sit, alone in our large bed, enjoying the fire and having yet another lazy afternoon. Our good friend Miss Howard comes to visit me, though she is not as interested in playing around anymore now that my stomach is enormous. �You know I adore you,� she said about a month ago, kissing my cheek, �but I do not adore the extra obstacle.� All the better for my husband, who is thoroughly enjoying my expanding body, especially my tits. They&#8217;ve already gotten bigger (though they will really swell after the baby is born, and I begin breast-feeding), and they are a little sore. My husband is aware of this, and enjoys tormenting them, squeezing them until they turn blue in his grip, and I scream for him to stop. I still enjoy the pain, and my husband knows better than to stop the first time I ask him to.

As a whole, my pregnancy has been a happy time for me. Like my husband, I had my worries when I first realized that I was with child. But all I&#8217;ve been able to think about is how lovely it will be to have a baby, a lovely soft baby to hold and to love. I have a few friends who have married and borne their first (if not second, or in the case of Mrs. Steepleton, third) child, and I have seen how radiant these new mothers are as I&#8217;ve visited them. They have no mind or eye for anyone other than their precious little ones, so wrapped up are they in that perfect love of a mother and child. I do wonder about my mother at times like these. Did she have a feeling, during her pregnancy, that my birth would be the end of her? Or did she feel just as I do: excited and motherly and thrilled, thinking only of the future, with no idea of her fate? Am I clueless as to the risks? Will my death sneak up on me as I labor to bring my child into this world? 

Dr. Yates has assured myself and my husband that he will come right away upon word that I have gone into labor. My husband is taking no risks; he has even asked Dr. Yates to �not be afraid to look at what you&#8217;re doing� as he helps to deliver my child. You see, it is a common practice amongst the physicians of our country to avoid eye contact with a woman&#8217;s �nether-regions,� and they tend to blindly feel their way through a birth. We will have a midwife present (or rather, three midwives�as I said, my husband is taking no risks), and it&#8217;s considered acceptable for them to look. But as my husband explained, �I want Dr. Yates to be fully aware of what is happening to you. I don&#8217;t want to risk anything happening to you, or the baby, just because he was following some prudish tradition.� 

I am certain that I am in capable hands. I do not allow myself to worry; my baby can sense when I am troubled, and it begins to kick violently, as if to scold me for having dark thoughts. I rub my belly and take deep breaths when this happens, willing myself calm, for the sake of the baby as well as myself. 

My dear husband is not afraid of pregnancy, like most men that I know. Besides taking an erotic pleasure in my metamorphosis, he takes a genuine joy in the development of the baby. Just a fortnight past, we were sitting together in his office, having a quiet afternoon of reading, when I felt my baby stir inside of me. �Sir?� I whispered. He looked up at me over his book. �The baby moves. Come and feel.�

With a curious smile, my husband leaned close to me and placed both hands on my stomach. His eyes welled with tears. �I feel it,� he said softly. 

I placed my hands over his. He took my hands and squeezed them, our clasped hands resting on top of the baby. We sat in silence, feeling our baby inside of me. My husband put his lips to my clothed belly and gave me a soft kiss, and of course, this led to him tearing off my tent-like dress and moving inside of me himself. When Mr. Singer and I have made love during my pregnancy, I have fancied the thought of having both of my loves so close to me.

My husband scolds me for being so socially minded, but throughout my happy pregnancy, I cannot help but think about all of the women (particularly poor women) who have to hide their baby bellies out of shame. These poor women, raped or abused or used by men, often abandon their poor babies out of desperation. London orphanages are filled with such ill-fated children. My emotions got the best of me one day, and I couldn&#8217;t stop crying about it. My husband laughed at me, but held me close regardless, comforting me.

�What do you intend to do about the poor little orphaned bastard children?� he teased me as he held me close, rubbing my belly in a comforting way.

I sniffled and said, �I could make a donation.�

�Indeed?� My husband grinned at me. �You could spend your entire fortune feeding all the orphans�for a day. Who would take up the cause and waste their fortune tomorrow?�

�I don&#8217;t have to feed everyone,� I said, defensive. �Perhaps I could make a donation to one orphanage. One large donation.�

My husband could tell that I was serious, and as my financial advisor and attorney, he aided me in my endeavor. My fortune has remained untouched for years; my Mr. Singer has supported me from his own pocket (so grateful am I to his generosity!), and with the help of some clients, has found smart ways to invest my fortune. I become wealthier and wealthier by the day, without doing a single thing. It&#8217;s extraordinary, really. I should note that now the fortune really belongs to my husband, but he continues to regard it as being mine alone. 

I made a personal donation to a large orphanage in London a few months back, and received a lovely thank-you letter in return, from the head of the orphanage and personal messages from the older children who knew how to write. I was told that my donation would go to purchase more books for the school, and to buy heavier cloth for winter clothing for the poor children. I waved my letter in my husband&#8217;s face triumphantly. �Do you see?� I said. �It&#8217;s made a difference.�

�Just be careful, my dear,� my husband said. �This could open up a whole can of worms for you.�

�What do you mean?�

�You helped one orphanage tremendously. Those children will be more comfortable this winter, and will have a better education, thanks to your generosity. I sincerely say well done to you; I do not mean to downplay your actions. But,� he added knowingly, �this will not be enough for you. What about the other children? What about next year? There&#8217;s only so much that one little woman can do, Emily. Please do not fail to remember this.�

Annoyed as I was, I knew that my husband was right. I had already been thinking of ways to make other donations. It was true; if my husband had not been there to rein me in, I might have wasted my entire fortune out of sentimentality. But, not ready to give up, I started an organization, dedicated to aiding the orphanages of London. I call it the Sir Peter Wainwright Foundation, in honor of my late father, and when word got out, I began to receive donations from many of my friends and admirers. Mr. Singer is currently running the whole production, on his insistence, and more money has been sent to more orphanages since (though my husband deals with the paperwork, I always have the final word). He admitted to me that I was brilliant, and that&#8217;s all I really wanted to hear from him.

I have been further occupying my time by helping my husband to find a nurse for our child. I still doubt that anyone can care for our child better than I, but my husband insists that we must be prepared. He at first suggested that we call back my old Nanny. I did not tell him the truth; I had written to Nanny when we first returned to Wainwright Hall as newlyweds, telling her of our wedding. I never received a response, nor was my letter returned to me. I hate to think of what this means. Has my Nanny passed away? Or worse, does she disapprove of my union with Mr. Singer? I am afraid that I will never know the truth.

I put my husband off from this idea. �Perhaps we might seek out a younger woman to help us,� I said. My husband took this to mean that I wanted to seek a nurse who would also be willing to join us in our bedchamber escapades, and perhaps that was my intention. We have received applications from our ad put out in London, and I&#8217;ve been helping my husband go through these carefully. Mr. Singer makes a game of it; he claims that if a woman&#8217;s lettering is curly and fanciful, that she is a whore who opens her legs on command. If her lettering is wide and curvy, she has large tits. And on like that; we laugh so, imagining the women behind the applications, but have yet to respond to any.

Though I am mainly bedridden, I find myself tiring easily. I believe I will take a nap; if there is anything exciting to report, I will write again soon.



16 December, 18&#8212;

I awoke to a wonderful surprise yesterday morning. I found myself tied to the bed. This was not so unusual during the first few months of my marriage; my husband would tie me up in the morning, and would spend the entire day tormenting me. He hadn&#8217;t done this since my belly really started to show, so it was certainly a surprise, indeed.

I was naked, of course; even in my pregnancy, I do not dress for bed. I struggled against my bindings, and my heart leapt. I could hardly move at all; my master wasn&#8217;t going to be easy on me, even in my delicate state. I smiled to myself and closed my eyes, thinking of what my husband had in mind for me that day.

He came back into the room a short time later, with breakfast on a tray. He was only wearing his housecoat, which he quickly threw off his shoulders after setting down the serving tray. He came to me and sat on the bed, leaning down to kiss me lovingly.

�Good morning, my dear,� he purred in my ear, nibbling my earlobe. 

�Morning, sir,� I managed, biting back a sigh as his lips found the sensitive place on my neck. 

Mr. Singer touched my cheek. �I know I&#8217;ve been neglecting some of your needs lately,� he said. He kissed the tip of my nose. �Today is all about your desires, my precious cow. I&#8217;m going to make you feel so, so good.� He laughed at me softly as I struggled against my wrist bindings�I wanted to touch his face so badly. �Patience, my dear. You need your strength, and our baby needs nutrition.� 

Mr. Singer propped me up enough to feed me, and I ate quickly, hardly tasting the food, so eager was I to begin our game. Reading my impatience, my husband laughed at me again and insisted on taking the dirty dishes back to the kitchen himself, leaving me to wriggle and moan in longing. When he finally returned, after what felt like several days (but was probably only fifteen minutes), he removed his housecoat again and sat beside me on the bed once more.

�What shall we do first, Emily?� my husband asked, rubbing my swollen belly. �Do you want me to beat your calves with a broom handle? Clean out your dirty little asshole with my tongue? Or perhaps you&#8217;d like to try a new toy that I ordered for you?�

I wiggled my toes in excitement. �A new toy?�

Mr. Singer grinned. �I put the package under the bed. I&#8217;m glad that you didn&#8217;t notice it there.� He pulled out a small box and I watched as he opened it slowly (so agonizingly slow!). He pulled out a strange object, but I knew what it was. It was a phallus, covered in leather. It was longer than Mr. Singer&#8217;s cock (by several inches!), and almost twice the width. I gasped as he held it up for me to see.

�Pretty whore, I know you&#8217;ve missed the attentions of another man&#8217;s cock,� Mr. Singer explained. �I had this specially made, just for you. Care to try it out on your cunt?�

I was nervous, thinking about how such a long, hard thing would feel going inside of me, but I nodded. Mr. Singer smiled as he covered the phallus in lotion, lubricating it so that it would slide in with a bit more ease. As he positioned himself between my spread legs, he said, �Now, lift your hips the best you can for me, my fat little cow�that&#8217;s it.� 

I couldn&#8217;t see what was happening, as my large belly obstructed my view. That made it all the more exciting as Mr. Singer worked the phallus slowly inside of me. I relaxed, but it still hurt, stretching and tearing me. It almost hurt as much as our first night together, when Mr. Singer tied me up and raped me. 

Mr. Singer slowly slid the phallus inside of me, until it bottomed out in my cervix. I gasped as he began to move the phallus. He did not thrust it; no, he kept it deep inside of me as he began to turn it slowly, counterclockwise. The walls of my pussy stretched awkwardly at the strange motion, and Mr. Singer stroked my clit the same way as he turned the phallus. When he switched and started turning it clockwise, violent chills ran all through my body. I groaned as he changed the direction of his rubbing against my clit.

Because the phallus was so huge, and because of his own concerns for my body and health, when Mr. Singer finally began thrusting the phallus, he was gentle. I wasn&#8217;t getting into it as much as I usually did, when he was pounding into me like I was his whore. I arched my back and cried, �Oh, sir, harder please. I want it to hurt.� I was shocked at what I was saying. Though I could not see him, I knew Mr. Singer was smiling.

He granted my request, fucking me with the huge phallus harder than I would have dared to do to myself. I struggled to raise my hips higher, so weighed down was I by my baby belly. For a brief moment, I worried about the phallus harming our baby. But Mr. Singer had provided me with a number of scientific readings on pregnancy, and I knew that our child was all right. Our frequent fucking will not harm it, although we are extra careful about cleaning afterward.

Mr. Singer noticed my struggle, and he removed the phallus. I dropped my hips in relief, but looked at him in surprise. �No,� he said, holding up the phallus (now soaked in my juices, along with streaks of lotion). �Let&#8217;s find you a more comfortable position, shall we, my dear?�

I nodded, and Mr. Singer unchained me, helping me to roll over on my side. He stroked my belly lovingly and smiled gently. �That better, my love?�

�Yes, sir,� I said softly. 

He stroked my soaking pussy, inserting his fingers briefly. �Do you want the phallus, my dear? Or would you prefer to have me?�

�Oh, you, sir,� I said without hesitation. He would not hurt me so much (which I mean to note in the negative), but nothing compares to how wonderful it feels to be so close to him. And he knows how to make me feel so good. 

And he added, �You&#8217;ll have the phallus in your ass?� I nodded eagerly, giggling like a little girl. Oh, my dear husband can still make me giddy. I had taken nothing larger than Mr. Singer&#8217;s old friend, the Colonel, in my ass, and that was quite a long time ago now. But Mr. Singer did not hesitate in wrapping his arm around my hip (which required him to reach a bit more than it used to) and shoved the phallus into my waiting asshole. I groaned as he entered me from the front, rubbing against my belly as he fucked me hard from both ends. 

�That&#8217;s right, my whore,� Mr. Singer hissed as he kept perfect rhythm with his own thrusting and that of the huge phallus. �My little wife loves to get fucked in all her holes, doesn&#8217;t she? My precious whore, my little cow, come for me.�

I put my mouth to his shoulder and screamed against him. The phallus tore up my ass, it hurt worse than anything we&#8217;d ever done before, but it felt incredible. And my husband was fucking my cunt and playing with my clit, and waves of pleasure, mixing with the pain, made my body tingle, and my enlarged nipples harden�I screamed again and threw my head back, pressing my belly against him as I came. Oh, God, I&#8217;m playing with myself now just thinking on it. It was the best, the very best climax of my life. So far, of course�I couldn&#8217;t move when Mr. Singer removed himself from me, though I was no longer chained. I trembled violently, feeling the burning pain of my violated ass and coming down from the intense high of my orgasm.

Mr. Singer held me while I cried. Oh, God, it had moved me to tears. I sobbed and sobbed, and Mr. Singer stroked my hair and whispered to me lovingly. I was bursting with joy, just bursting with it, and I couldn&#8217;t hold it in. My sobbing gave way to giggling, and Mr. Singer held my head against his chest, shushing me and laughing himself as I burst into hysterical laughter, my belly shaking against him, as though our baby were sharing in our joy.

When I was calm, I lifted my head and looked my husband in the eye. Mr. Singer is a beautiful man, and is most wonderful to behold when he was happy. And never in my life have I seen a happier man than my husband at that moment, as he touched my face and smiled at me. �We do have fun, don&#8217;t we, Emily?� he whispered.

I nodded. �Thank you, sir.�

�Oh, no, my dear,� he said. �What I give to you, you give me back a hundredfold.� He kissed me sweetly, running his hands through my sweat-soaked hair. It made me feel so good to hear him say that. I have tried so hard, in the months that we have been together, to be worthy of him. And he more than thinks me so.

My husband allowed me to rest quietly for a short time. He understands that my stamina is not what it used to be before I got so large. He is patient as ever, perhaps moreso, and waited for me to let him know that I was ready to continue to play. 

I touched my husband&#8217;s face. �Sir,� I said, �Would you believe that you have given me the best experience of my life?�

He nodded. �I could tell, Emily. You know how well I know your body.� He touched my belly. �This experience will be trounced in only a few short weeks, I am afraid.�

I wasn&#8217;t sure what he meant at first, then I realized. Of course; the birth of our child. That would truly be the very best experience. But I smiled at him and said, �Well, you&#8217;re giving me that experience, too.� I put my arms around my husband, embracing him. �I love you.�

�I love you, too, Emily. Do you feel like playing anymore?�

�May I thank you, sir?� I asked, and he knew what I meant. He nodded, and helped me out of bed and to my knees. My belly jutted out in front of me, and I held on to my husband&#8217;s thighs to steady myself as I sucked his cock. He was not gentle as he fucked my mouth roughly, forcing his member down my throat. But I&#8217;m so good at cocksucking now, and I so enjoy doing it. Of course, my husband is my favorite one to please, but I have fantasized lately about sucking the cocks of many of the men in the area. As I&#8217;ve stood in public places and had pleasant and polite conversations with one of my former suitors or old friends, I would imagine taking him by the hand and leading him into a closet or behind a building, and going down on my knees for him to offer him pleasure that he&#8217;s never known. Of course, I would never do such a thing without my husband&#8217;s permission!

There are no men around whom I would feel comfortable inviting to my marriage bed. All of them are too close to us; it is for them that I must be virtuous Lady Emily Singer of Wainwright. Mr. Singer has promised that, after I have given birth and recovered, he will introduce me to a local man he has met who is guaranteed to be discreet. I do wonder whom he has chosen!

But for now, I will give my all to pleasing my master, my dear husband. I pleased him to the best of my abilities, straining to hold myself up. I tightened my grip on his thighs, my knees trembling under my extra weight, and my husband, sensing my discomfort, took pity on me and began thrusting more frantically, grabbing me by the back of my head and forcing himself down my throat so deep, I nearly did gag (but of course, I did not). He came, it seemed, directly into my stomach. I cleaned his dick not out of duty, but out of desire. I cannot explain it, but I do love the taste of his cum. Even Miss Howard, my equally whorish friend, does not understand it.

My husband helped me to my feet. �Sir,� I said, �Did you mention something about a broom handle earlier?�

�Whore,� my husband purred in my ear. �Have you been a naughty little cow? Are you looking for a punishment?�

�Oh, yes,� I sighed. Weak as I felt, I wanted to keep playing. My husband led me to one of the armchairs by the fireplace in our huge bedchamber. I was walking awkwardly, lumbering with my huge belly, but trying to keep my legs apart. The phallus had left me sore in my cunt and my asshole. My husband had me bend over the side of the armchair. He left me bent over awkwardly, my belly resting on the seat, as he retrieved a couple of ropes. He tied the ropes to the chair legs, and tied the other ends to my wrists. My head bowed over the side of the chair, I could not watch my husband as he walked to the other side of the chair, facing my ass as it stuck up straight in the air.

He grabbed a broom from the closet and brought it over to me. He touched my calves with the tip of the broom handle, poking me. �Up on your toes, whore,� he ordered, and I obeyed. I heard the sound of the broom handle slice through the air as my husband drew it back and hit me across my calves. He allowed me to yelp in pain, rising up higher on my toes.

I expected the next hit to be in the same spot, so I was surprised when he smacked the back of my knees. They buckled, and if I hadn&#8217;t been tied to the opposite end of the chair, I would have toppled over to the floor. �Up, up your toes,� my master said, and I obeyed before he hit me again, across the calves again. He delivered several blows to my calves, thighs, and the back of my knees one more time (which made me buckle again). I gasped as my husband knelt behind me and touched my burning skin, tracing his fingers over the forming welts.

That would be the extent of our play that morning, as my husband untied me and tucked me back into bed on my side, to alleviate the pressure on my back and my beaten legs. He climbed into bed with me and held me close, touching my face and my belly at the same time. He was wiping away the tears that I&#8217;d cried during my beating. �Eight months pregnant, and you&#8217;re still a tasty little whore,� my husband praised me. I closed my eyes and rested my head on his chest again. He ran a gentle hand through my hair. �I love you, Emily.�

I am becoming redundant, I know, but I cannot help but mention that I am so, so happy. I never believed that anyone could be as happy as I am. I am with the man of my dreams, I feel wonderful every second of the day, and I&#8217;m going to be a mother in only a few short weeks. I do hope that I am not tempting fate. I cannot forget that perfect happiness cannot last. No one has ever been that fortunate. But I will not worry; I will simply enjoy it while I have it.


25 December, 18&#8212;

Happy, blessed Christmas!

I am so close to giving birth that my husband almost would not allow me to attend church services this morning. But I begged him, and he relented. I did not argue about not being able to attend any of the numerous parties to which we&#8217;d been invited (it would be inappropriate for me to be there, with my hugely pregnant belly, anyhow), and I know that my husband would never deny me. 

He accompanied me to church, just as he has every Sunday and religious holiday during our marriage. He does not believe in it, I know, but he comes because he knows I want him to. He talks politely with our friends and the other parishioners, keeping me close at hand. I think he secretly fears that I will flirt with some of my old suitors, and while I wouldn&#8217;t ever do anything to betray him (at least, I hope he does�do you, sir?), I do enjoy that he is so jealous and protective. 

I am huge now, and I move with much difficulty. Mr. Singer had to enlist the aid of our driver just to get me up into the carriage, which humiliated me indescribably. But when my husband climbed in after me, he put his arm around me and kissed me softly. �Poor little fat cow,� he soothed me. �Do you miss being so lithe and graceful?�

�No, sir,� I said, and that was true. Fat as I am (my husband has calls me this with affection), I love my body. I am a vessel of love and protection for our dear child.

At church, the women fawned over my huge belly, while the men politely ignored it. �Lady Emily,� Mrs. Gainsley said, �You must be very close to giving birth.�

Mrs. Gainsley is pregnant herself, not quite so far along as I, but her small baby belly was noticeable under her Christmas dress. I hope that her new baby will bring happiness to her; poor Miss Howard, her sister, is more and more worried for her all the time, reporting her husband&#8217;s ill treatment of her. I couldn&#8217;t help but notice a small bruise on poor Mrs. Gainsley&#8217;s cheek. As much as my husband enjoys beating me on the back, legs, and tits, he&#8217;s never hit me in the face (and I believe he never would). We have an understanding that it would be of the utmost disrespect for him to hit me there. He may treat the rest of my body any way he likes (and I want him to do so, of course), but he is so tender to my face. 

Poor Mrs. Gainsley. I can understand Miss Howard&#8217;s rage toward her brother-in-law. When I noticed the bruise, I wanted to find him and hit him myself. But I merely smiled and complimented Mrs. Gainsley on her dress before waddling back to my husband and finding our pew. Miss Howard sat with us, rather then her parents or sister. She rarely attends services; perhaps on Easter and Christmas, and that is the extent of it. As the vicar began the service, Miss Howard took my hand and whispered to me, �Did you see it?�

I nodded, and my friend clenched her teeth. �I could kill him,� she snarled, so that only myself and Mr. Singer could hear.

Teasingly, Mr. Singer leaned over my belly and said to her, �Miss Howard, that is slanderous language to use in the house of the Lord. Especially on the baby Jesus&#8217;s birthday. Shame on you, sinner.�

I nudged them both. �Your souls are in peril,� I said with a straight face, and we three giggled most inappropriately. 

I was tired after the long Christmas service, so after briefly greeting the friends we had missed before church, my husband took me home. We have agreed that I will not leave Wainwright Manor again until after our baby is born. It will not be much longer now!

We settled into the parlor, where the servants had set up and decorated a Christmas tree the day before, before going off on their own Christmas holidays. We are without servants until after the New Year&#8217;s celebrations, but I know that my Mr. Singer will take good care of me. 

I knew that my husband would have gifts for me, and he did not let me down. He presented me with package after package, wrapped in gold paper. He gave me new books, a new pair of diamond earrings, and many items for the baby. Then, he presented me with one last package. It was shaped like a jewelry case, and inside, I found a new leather collar. This one was much, much finer than the first. In fact, I had defied my master by hiding the ugly, uncomfortable collar that he&#8217;d given me in our first days together. It chafes my skin terribly when I wear it; though I love it when my husband grabs the front of the collar and pulls me to him, it left terrible red marks on my neck. I believe that my husband knew this, and therefore did not make an issue out of it.

The new collar was made of smooth, dark green leather. The inside was lined with silk. As Mr. Singer fitted it around my neck, he said, �I think you&#8217;ll find this one quite a bit more comfortable than the other. I daresay this one will not go missing, will it, my dear?�

I giggled and blushed, my deception revealed. �Yes, sir,� I agreed.

He did grab the collar and pull me to him then, kissing me roughly. �You will wear this new collar all the time at home, from now on, unless we are entertaining any guests who are not our playmates. Are we agreed, Emily?�

�Yes, sir,� I said, and he kissed me again, gripping the front of the collar.

I wear it now, even alone, as I rest in bed. Mr. Singer took me upstairs and made me take an afternoon nap before supper. He is making a sizable feast for us, all on his own. He has cooked for me before, but I am still anxious to see how it turns out. I will not hurt his feelings and criticize him if it is sub par; he fancies the idea of being able to take care of all of my needs, so I will let him.

I did not give my Mr. Singer a present this year. Mr. Singer does not allow me to buy him gifts; he says that I give him enough, every single day. �I want nothing but your body and your heart, my sweet whore,� he told me last Christmas, our first Christmas together as man and wife. But his gift is coming, and very soon. It will be a couple of weeks late for Christmas, but our baby will bring us more joy than any amount of money or presents ever could.

I hear my master coming up the stairs. Happy Christmas yet again; I must pretend that I have been sleeping, so that my husband will give me a night of wonderful sex. I cannot wait for the excitement that the new year will bring to Wainwright Hall.


10 January, 18&#8212;

All of the months of loving and worrying and preparing have come to fruition at last. I awoke two nights before in pain, and I instantly knew what was happening. My husband, a light sleeper, woke with me. �Emily?� he asked, reaching for me in the dark. �Is it time for the baby to come, Emily?� His voice was shaking.

�Not yet,� I said knowingly as the pain faded quickly. I remembered what the books said; I was only at the beginning of my labors yet. 

Mr. Singer rubbed my stomach, frowning at me in the dark. �Should I send for the doctor? Do you need anything, my dear?�

�No, sir,� I said. �Let us lie still and go back to sleep.�

He wrapped his arms around me, burying his face in my hair and rubbing my belly as we fell back to sleep. The pain of my contractions woke me a couple of times before morning, and by dawn, Mr. Singer was out of bed and dressed. He helped me into a conservative nightgown, one that he&#8217;d purchased just for the occasion of the birth of our child. He made sure that I was comfortable, fluffing the pillows and wrapping me up gently. 

He kissed my forehead tenderly. �I&#8217;m going to send for Dr. Yates now,� he said.

�Sir, it&#8217;s still a bit soon,� I said patiently, but my husband insisted, and I knew he would have his way. 

But my husband had good foresight, because by the time the doctor and the midwives arrived (only two out of three in attendance, to my husband&#8217;s chagrin), my water had already broken. My husband was ushered from the room as I began going into labor. I could sense his presence just outside of the bedchamber doors as I screamed and pushed out our child.

The pain of child labor is a blessed, faded memory. When I think back to it, only two days ago, I remember the labor as a blur. Dr. Yates and the midwives&#8217; faces are unclear in my memory, and I do not remember the pain. And then, when the baby was out, everything was clear again. And so bright; the lights and colors of the room were radiant as Dr. Yates handed my baby over to one of the midwives.

�A baby girl,� Dr. Yates said. I heard the first cries of my child as air came into her lungs. �Congratulations, Lady Emily.�

I cried tears of joy as my baby was swaddled and laid in my arms. She is such a perfect, beautiful baby. She looks so much like her father, with her sharp little nose and her dark eyes. I refused to stop holding her and staring into her eyes as the midwives cleaned the mess of the birthing and prepared me for my husband.

Finally, Mr. Singer was called into the room. He was not smiling, but I could see the joy in his wet eyes as he sat beside me. Only to him, I handed over our child. He looked on her with adoring eyes. �She&#8217;s lovely,� he said, and cooed to her sweetly. He kissed her softly as she fussed in his arms. �Oh, she wants her mummy,� Mr. Singer said, handing her back over to me so that I could feed her.

We still have not hired a nurse, having never actually responded to any of the applications or inquiries, so Mr. Singer is caring for us himself as I recover from giving birth. Mr. Singer is leaving my cunt alone, allowing it to heal from having our large baby rip through it, and is making use of my willing asshole and mouth for his pleasure. But mostly, we hold our baby together and talk about our plans for her.

Mr. Singer confessed that he was relieved that my pregnancy was over. �I hid it from you, my dear, but I have been worried for months. I&#8217;m so glad that I have two healthy girls today.� I smiled and said nothing, not wanting to disappoint him by telling him that I was well aware of his fears. 

As a matter of fact, since I got through my labor with such surprising ease (even Dr. Yates commented that I was the easiest birth he&#8217;d aided in many years), Mr. Singer is already discussing having more children! �We have lots of time,� he said, �but I think it would be nice for us to have a large family. Do you agree, Emily?�

Having grown up an only child, I was sometimes lonely at Wainwright Hall, especially when Mr. Singer was working and Nanny was too tired to play or accompany me to call on any of my friends. I used to wish for a sibling, someone to play with all the time. And we have lots of room at Wainwright Hall for children. I love the idea of our children running around the grounds as we watch over them with loving protectiveness. 

My real mother&#8217;s milk has started swelling my breasts. They are engorged, much to my husband&#8217;s delight. They are even larger than Miss Howard&#8217;s now, but they are quite sore. Mr. Singer has not yet sampled my milk, saving it all for our sweet little child. He watched me feed her this morning, and said that he would have a taste of me tonight. My nipples are already hardening at the thought of him wrapping his warm lips around my nipple, nibbling gently as he sucks and drinks from me.

I couldn&#8217;t help but remember today that I never did taste mother&#8217;s milk. My mother died, and my Nanny was no wet nurse. I was fed a nutrient formula mixture, and I suppose it was good enough. Still, I am glad to be giving my daughter, my sweet little baby, the very best that I have. I am more obsessive now about my diet than I was during my pregnancy, and poor Mr. Singer scrambles to see to my needs.

I must also note that my husband and I have settled on a name for our precious little one. We will call her Anne Wilhelmina, after my late mother. Mr. Singer is not fond of our daughter&#8217;s middle name, but I think it is a beautiful, strong name. It was my grandmother&#8217;s name, and my mother&#8217;s second, and so it will be our daughter&#8217;s name as well. Mr. Singer and I have agreed that we will name our children alternately; he will name the next (probably Avery, after his own late father and brother, should it be a boy; perhaps Gillian Margaret for his mother, though she still lives), then I will choose the next (I hope I will be able to use the name Peter), and on and on like that for as many children as we are able to produce.

I have found myself calling our child Mina as I whisper to her affectionately, and my husband has agreed that that is a lovely moniker. And Mina she shall be. Sweet little Mina, our precious child, created by our strange, forbidden passions. I already wonder if she will grow up with the same sexual appetites as I have. If she does, I do pray that she will have a husband as loving and understanding as her own father is to me.


3 March, 18&#8212;

After keeping me housebound since the last few weeks of my pregnancy, my husband allowed me to attend a party last night. I was eager to show off my shape, for I have successfully managed to tighten my corset almost as much as I could before my pregnancy began. Mr. Singer has allowed me walks around the grounds since the week after I gave birth, and I have enjoyed the brief solitude as Mr. Singer spent time bonding with our daughter alone. There has been little snow this year, so I could move with haste and ease, getting the exercise that has helped me to shed most of my extra weight.

When I was able to put on one of the gowns I had purchased before my pregnancy (never worn since the fitting), my husband put his hands on my waist and sighed. �You are my fat little cow no more,� he said regretfully, and I kissed him playfully.

�I will be fat again someday,� I said comfortingly. 

Mr. Singer removed my green leather collar (we have decided that he is the only one allowed to do so), and put on the diamond choker that he&#8217;d gifted to me in Calcutta, just weeks before our wedding. He kissed my neck around the expensive collar, and I felt my pussy clench with desire. �I have a surprise for you tonight,� Mr. Singer whispered in my ear. �I&#8217;m going to introduce you to a new friend.�

I giggled at the thought, and after we left the baby with the new nanny (we finally broke down and hired a young woman from Liverpool�she seems very serious and not at all whorish, but Mr. Singer has taken on the challenge of turning her), we departed. I felt anxious about leaving Mina alone, but Mr. Singer kissed me and reassured me. �Not to worry, Mummy,� he said, �Our precious Mina is in good, loving hands.� Serious as Perpetua may be, she is very good with our child. 

Mr. Singer would not allow me to receive any callers after the birth of our child, wanting me to focus on resting and recovering for him (as a matter of fact, he still has not fucked my cunt, though I crave him so badly). When we arrived at the Steepletons&#8217; estate and walked through the doors, we were quickly greeted by all of the guests in attendance.

Everyone complimented me on how well I looked, how lovely my purple gown was. The ladies asked after the baby, and I reported that our little girl was healthy and wonderful. The men shook Mr. Singer&#8217;s hand, and as I watched my husband with our friends, I wondered which one of them he had selected for me. I had my favorites, but I would willingly please any man (or woman) that my master wants me to.

Miss Howard was in attendance, and I had not seen her since Christmas. When most of the crowd around me dissipated, she pulled me aside and congratulated me. But she looked troubled. �What&#8217;s the matter?� I asked kindly.

Miss Howard frowned. �What do you think? Nothing new; things are getting worse and worse for my sister.�

�What&#8217;s happened?� I asked.

Miss Howard sighed. �She is miserable,� she said. �She finally confessed to me everything that has been going on�everything. Oh, Lady Emily, her cad of a husband beats her mercilessly. Her eye was blackened when I last saw her a fortnight ago�and she, seven months on with child!� Miss Howard&#8217;s voice was rising, and some of the other guests turned to look at us. I got her to quiet down.

�You are fortunate not to have married him yourself,� Miss Howard said, but she almost sounded bitter. �Sir Aaron saved you a world of trouble.�

I nodded in agreement. I do not allow myself to forget how fortunate I am, everyday.

Mr. Singer pulled me away from Miss Howard not long after that conversation occurred. �No time for our gloomy friend tonight,� he said as he led me across the ballroom. �Very soon, it will be time for me to unveil your new friend.�

We socialized a bit, danced a little�just enough so that we were not missed when Mr. Singer took my hand and led me out of the ballroom and down a long hallway. I realized that we were headed for the servants&#8217; quarters. I wondered why we were going there, but said nothing as Mr. Singer led me to a door at the end of the hallway. He knocked quietly.

Mr. Steepleton&#8217;s carriage driver, a young African man with very dark skin and very white teeth, answered and beckoned us in quickly, closing the door quietly behind us. The small room contained only a narrow bed, two sets of drawers, and a bedside table. A few of the servant&#8217;s possessions were strewn along the tops of the tables. 

I stared at the man as Mr. Singer introduced him. �My dear, this is Alfonso Beaumont.�

�Hello,� I said shyly, offering my hand. Alfonso, educated to be a servant to gentry, kissed it with more grace than any other man ever has before. 

�Pleased to make your acquaintance, my lady,� Alfonso said, in a voice as smooth and velvety as his skin. I longed to touch him, but I waited on my master&#8217;s orders.

He did not wait long to give them. �You may strip now, Lady Emily,� he said, and I did so, turning to allow Alfonso to struggle in untying my corset. I giggled gently at his clumsy attempts, but he managed. I turned to him and pressed my breasts (they are huge, and I longed for them to be squeezed and held) against his chest. 

�Well done,� I purred, and I felt his cock harden against my leg. I asked the question that Mr. Singer usually asks our new playmates: �What would you like to do to me?�

Alfonso&#8217;s hand snaked around and rested on my ass cheek. �Your husband said, Lady Emily, that you like getting fucked in your ass.� I couldn&#8217;t help blushing, though I was very pleased as I nodded. Alfonso asked me to remove his clothes, and I carefully unbuttoned his work shirt, and he tossed it aside as I went for his pants.

Mr. Singer sat comfortably on the small bed, watching us with interest as I grabbed Alfonso&#8217;s huge, hard cock. Not exactly the size of the phallus, but quite enormous in its own right. Alfonso led me to his dressers and had me grip the back edge as he bent me over the cluttered dresser. As he had me spread my legs, I carefully pushed away some of his random items so that they would not impede with our fucking.

�Lube first, please,� Mr. Singer said from his place on the bed. �I don&#8217;t want you to tear up my wife&#8217;s ass�too much.� Alfonso complied, and when his cock was wet and slick with lotion, he rammed into me. Though he fucked me hard (obviously, he and Mr. Singer had talked quite extensively before this little play-date was arranged), he did so with as much grace as he&#8217;d kissed my hand. His hips bumped against mine, and I raised my ass higher, feeling his balls slap against my ass cheeks as he fucked me deep. I could swear that I felt him poking at my colon!

The burning pain nearly blinded me as Alfonso pounded me, but after taking the phallus in my ass more than once, I was well prepared. He kissed my neck (gracefully, with soft, full lips) as he fucked me, too, and I moaned, spreading wider and raising my hips higher, my head almost touching the top of the dresser as he came. I felt his engorged cock explode in my asshole, filling me with his cum. 

He kept his limp dick inside of me as he helped me to stand up straight. When he finally removed himself, I farted loudly and voided cum and shit onto the floor. I gasped in mortification; this had never happened before. But Mr. Singer only laughed, and Alfonso smiled and said he would clean it up himself, thanking me for the pleasure of my company with a sweet kiss. I put my hands on the sides of his face. His skin was soft, so amazingly soft, and I ran my hands up and down his back for a moment, caressing him.

We did not stay much longer, only long enough for Mr. Singer to shake Alfonso&#8217;s hand and to grab my dress and my hand. He led me naked down the hallway, and at first, I feared that he would force me to parade my nude, post-pregnancy body in front of the entire party. But no; he led me to the servants&#8217; bathroom and carefully cleaned my cunt and my asshole, wiping away the shit with a wet towel before helping me into my corset and dress once again.

We slipped back into the party, and our absence was unnoticed by all, so brief was our time with our new friend. I whispered to my husband that I longed to suck Alfonso&#8217;s cock. He laughed softly and said, �Another time, my dear. I&#8217;ve already arranged another play-date with our new friend. And perhaps Miss Howard would like to join us as well? We could double up on the fun.�

�Yes, that would be nice,� I agreed. �I think it would do wonders in cheering her up.�

We left the party not long after we made one final round to greet our friends. I blushed as I realized that I&#8217;d just allowed a servant to fuck me in the ass while all of our friends were only in the next room. Down a long hall, but still. But none of them had a clue, except perhaps Miss Howard, who winked at me as we said goodnight.

As soon as we got home, I went up to the nursery to check on Mina. She was sleeping peacefully, and I sent Perpetua off to bed. Though it is part of her job, I insist on caring for Mina myself in the night. Her nursery is right next to our master bedchamber, and I always hear her cries in the night, as does my husband. We sometimes rise together to go to her, and Mr. Singer will watch as I sit in the rocking chair in the corner of the nursery, feeding her until she is content. After Mr. Singer puts her back in her crib, he comes and kneels before me, sucking from one nipple while groping the opposite breast. He drinks from me hungrily, greedily; he cannot get enough of my milk. 

I will be eager to play with Alfonso again, and with Miss Howard, my poor neglected friend. But my love and devotion to my husband and to my child are enough for me. If my master ordered me to never flirt with anyone again, let alone let them play with me, I would eager follow his command. He truly is the only man that I need.


28 June, 18&#8212;

Such horrors that have taken place tonight! Neither Mr. Singer nor myself had any idea of what would happen when we were relaxing in the parlor for the evening, enjoying chilled white wine and a comfortable breeze coming through the open windows. Little Mina was on her belly on the floor. She is crawling along now, and is a big, healthy baby. Dr. Yates says that she is in fine condition for her age. She spoke her first word very recently, a sound like �Mummy,� much to the delight of myself and my husband (who seems to want her to love me more than she does him�I don&#8217;t know why I sense this, but I feel that it is true). 

Our peaceful evening ended with a rapid knocking on the parlor window. I looked up from my reading, alarmed, scooping up the baby as Mr. Singer went for his revolver in the bureau. �It&#8217;s me, Miss Howard!� We heard our friend call to us through the open window. �Do let me in the back way, please!� She sounded frantic, so I held Mina close as Mr. Singer (still holding his gun) hurried out of the room to let her in.

When Mr. Singer led a trembling Miss Howard into the room, I instantly noticed how disheveled and disturbed she looked�and that her white summer dress was spotted in blood. I gasped. �What&#8217;s happened?� I asked.

Mr. Singer helped Miss Howard to sit on the couch, and I sat beside her as she burst into sobs. Mr. Singer took Mina from me as I comforted our friend. After a minute of hysterics, Miss Howard whispered, �I killed him.�

My husband and I looked at each other, shocked into silence. Miss Howard continued. �Ever since my sister lost her baby, he&#8217;s been more cruel to her than ever, if you can believe it.� Poor Mrs. Gainsley had given birth to a dead baby, a new mother&#8217;s worst nightmare. Miss Howard was convinced that her brother-in-law&#8217;s rough treatment of his wife had resulted in the stillbirth, and with my knowledge of pregnancy, I couldn&#8217;t help agreeing. Miss Howard, trembling in my arms, explained that she had set out to even the score.

�I told you I would kill him,� she said to us. �And that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve done. I walked all the way over there this evening, cornered him in his study, and shot him in the face. That bastard will never hurt my baby sister again.� She smirked now, but tears still ran down her cheeks.

�But Miss Howard,� I protested, shocked at what she had done, �What about your family?� I didn&#8217;t know what else to say. I was worried that she would be imprisoned for life.

Mr. Singer, holding sweet Mina, was pacing in front of us. �As your attorney and friend, I will vouch for you, Miss Howard,� he said after a moment of silence. �I do not agree with what you have done, but I see where you are justified. When the police question you�and they will question you, and soon�I am willing to tell them that you have been with us here at Wainwright Hall all evening.�

I was shocked at the horrible lie, but when I was asked if I were willing to participate in the cover-up, I relented. After all, Miss Howard is my oldest friend (besides Mr. Singer himself), and I do adore her. I know that, as violent as her actions were, she only did them out of love for her sister. 

Mr. Singer questioned Miss Howard. Had anyone seen her go to the Gainsley estate? Had anyone seen her covered in blood as she ran over here? What time had she left home to go on her terrible errand? And where was the gun?

Miss Howard had a simple answer for the final question, lifting up the side of her dress to reveal a holster around her slim ankle. A small pistol was there. Mr. Singer took the pistol and hid it with his own weaponry, asking Miss Howard if anyone knew the existence of her gun.

I worry about the police. If Miss Howard is suspected (and her hatred for her brother-in-law is well-known in the area), the police may question myself and Mr. Singer as well, if we are to serve as her alibis. But Mr. Singer assures me that he will help me through, and all will be well. �We are doing a good thing for our friend,� he explained to me after we&#8217;d drawn a bath for Miss Howard and laid a dress out for her to wear home. She would go along in our carriage, to further drive the point that she had been our guest that evening. Mr. Singer could sense my trepidation, and he added, �I would certainly do the same for you.�

�Yes,� I agreed. �But I would never kill anyone. Ever.�

Mr. Singer kissed my forehead. �I know it, my dear. You are so, so good.� He said this with only a hint of bitterness in his voice.

I am sitting in the nursery as I write this, with only the dim light of a candle to aid me. I will go back to bed and lay beside my husband and attempt sleep, but I know it will not come. I have not even lied yet, and already, I feel extraordinary guilt.












Mr. Singer

Poor Emily was distressed after Mr. Gainsley&#8217;s death. For some weeks, she had difficulty sleeping, creeping from our marriage bed and sitting in the nursery for hours in the night. She did not know that I was aware of her absence, but the loss of her warmth against me jerked me awake each time. Every night I debated going to her, but I never rose from bed. When she would finally return, I would pretend sleep as she slipped back into my arms.

I knew it was not so much the loss of the man himself (for though she&#8217;d had soft feelings for him before, she had come to despise him as his ill treatment of his poor wife became more and more obvious), but from her guilt for covering up the murder. The poor dear girl always had a heavy conscience. It caused her many sleepless nights when we were first together (though that was somewhat in part due to our activities together), but she had learned to be happy and free of her guilt in time. And so, I allowed her to pull herself from her depression. After a while, she was herself again.

Mr. Gainsley&#8217;s death also served to restore Emily&#8217;s friendship with the dead man&#8217;s sister. Miss Gainsley had been resentful of my wife since our return from India, and would treat her with stiff, cold politeness whenever they met. But at the visitation, held at her parents&#8217; estate, their friendship was restored. As my wife and I, in our black mourning clothes, entered the parlor, Miss Gainsley excused herself from the company of her parents and came quickly to greet us.

�Oh, Lady Emily, I&#8217;m so glad that you are here!� she declared tearfully, throwing her arms around my beloved&#8217;s neck in a fit of uncharacteristic affection. �My brother&#8217;s horrible murder has given me a lot to consider, and one thing I&#8217;ve realized is that I&#8217;ve treated you ill. You are my dear friend, and I hope you will forgive me.� 

�Of course,� Emily said, as surprised as I, but gracious as Miss Gainsley led her to speak with her parents. I stood behind and glanced around the room. Most of our social circle had arrived to pay their last respects to Mr. Gainsley, who was laid in a closed black coffin on the other end of the parlor. His wife, in her black mourning clothes, stood alone beside the coffin. I approached her.

�Mrs. Gainsley,� I said gently, and she smiled at me.

�Hello, Sir Aaron,� she said, offering her hands to me and planting a kiss on my cheek. �Thank you for coming today. You&#8217;ve always been so kind.�

I looked her over briefly. She resembled her older sister, but looked so different from her, at the same time. More innocent than Miss Howard, to be sure; no doubt she&#8217;d been a virgin on her wedding night. She still bore some of her pregnancy weight, but it was flattering on her. She had pleasantly full cheeks and full, soft lips, much like her sister&#8217;s. I had to wonder�

�How are you getting on, Mrs. Gainsley?� I asked kindly. 

�As well as one might expect, I suppose,� she said, dropping her eyes sadly. �I have returned to my parents&#8217; home for the time being.�

I put my hands gently on her upper arms, in a comforting but not too intimate gesture. �If there is anything that you ever need, do not hesitate to call on us at Wainwright Hall. My wife and I are at your service.�

She smiled up at me then. �Thank you, Sir Aaron.�

My wife approached us then and paid her respects to the young widow. The visitation was pleasant enough, but there was tension in the air between Mrs. Gainsley and her late husband&#8217;s parents. Mrs. Gainsley had briefly been suspected in the murder, but fortunately for her (and for the true murderess), she had been supping with her parents that evening. 

Miss Howard had been questioned, of course, and subsequently, my wife and I were as well. Emily was very coy in her deception; she had turned on her charm for the investigators. As a matter of fact, one of the investigators stayed back and enjoyed the pleasure of my wife&#8217;s accommodating mouth. We were quite in the clear, especially when news came out that an escaped convict had been suspected to be hiding out in the area. It was concluded that the maniac had broken into the home, shot Mr. Gainsley in cold blood, and fled. Case closed.

Still, the tension was real, and Mrs. Gainsley stuck by the side of her parents and sister at the funeral the following morning. Who else but my dear Emily, nursing her own sadness, could be the one to break the tension and restore goodwill? She made it her mission, at the dinner held after the funeral service, to make things right between Mrs. Gainsley and her in-laws. I sat with Miss Howard and watched my wife talk quietly with the widow and the mourning parents, and saw the pleased look on her face when Mrs. Gainsley and her mother-in-law sobbed and embraced.

�I don&#8217;t know why she cares for those people,� Miss Howard said bitterly. �They knew what was going on, and did nothing to stop it. And that prude little bitch Miss Gainsley��

�Enough of that,� I whispered as Emily approached us. I must admit, I found Miss Howard&#8217;s irreverence to be quite amusing, but I knew my Emily would not take to it on such a somber occasion.

Restoring the friendship between the Gainsley and Howard families was my wife&#8217;s penance for her part in the murder, I suppose. As time passed, we were perfectly happy again, watching our child grow along with our love. We frequently hosted Miss Howard and Alfonso Beaumont in our home, and Alfonso had even brought along his visiting brother for a play-date with my whorish wife. After taking both dark men at once (while fingering her untouched cunt; I still would not allow anyone else to have her there, as it was my property), she would later giggle and admit to me that Alfonso&#8217;s brother Claude was the most handsome man she&#8217;d ever been with. Sensing my jealousy, she kissed me softly and amended, �Besides you, of course, sir.�

I worried not about my wife straying. As the first years of our marriage slipped by happily, she was as devoted to me as ever. I never have blamed her for what happened later on. I understand now that she had no choice, and she did what she had to do to protect her family, to protect me. As a matter of fact, other issues aside, I&#8217;ve never been able to stop blaming myself for it all. If I had returned home with her that night�if I had done a better job of protecting my precious one�all would still be well. 


About a year after Mr. Gainsley&#8217;s murder, our nanny left our home. I had been disappointed by her lack of interest in my subtle advances as she firmly put me off, and so I had bribed her to just go away. 

Besides, what was I doing overpaying this woman, when my wife took care of our child most of the time, anyway? When she was not doing her duty by me, she was constantly with our Mina. I make it a point to state that I loved that child. I never stopped loving her. But I must confess, I did not love her as I might have if she had more resembled her mother. In the beginning, this did not matter quite as much. She did not have her mother&#8217;s natural curls or soft features, or her lovely grey eyes. Mina much more resembled my family. She was always just as pretty as her mother (especially as she&#8217;s gotten older), but not quite like her. So different. Too different.

We did not even put out an ad for another nanny, but one was delivered to our doorstep, anyhow. It was most unexpected. On a warm July afternoon, I was lounging with my wife on our back patio while Mina toddled around the garden. I had to put my hand on my wife&#8217;s arm more than once, to keep her from chasing after the child. �Let her pick herself up, should she fall,� I would remind her. �That&#8217;s how your father taught you to walk.�

The heat of the afternoon was about to drive us in, when our housekeeper came out of the back door. �Mrs. Gainsley here to see you,� she announced, and in came the young widow. In the past year, she had still carried the sadness of her unhappy marriage and its sudden end. That afternoon, she still wore one of her heavy mourning dresses, in spite of the heat.

Emily and I both stood to greet her. �Mrs. Gainsley, what a lovely surprise!� Emily declared, leading her to our small table. �Would you care for something cold to drink?�

�Oh, no. No, thank you,� Mrs. Gainsley said nervously as she sat. �I am sorry to come unexpectedly��

�Nonsense,� I said. �You are always welcome in our home.�

�Yes,� my wife concurred.

�I am afraid that I come to ask a favor,� Mrs. Gainsley said quietly. She looked ashamed. �You see�my father is quite ill. He is very soon to die.�

�Oh, dear,� Emily said softly. �I&#8217;m terribly sorry, Mrs. Gainsley.�

�Thank you,� Mrs. Gainsley said. �I�well, Sir Aaron, you are aware of our situation with the property and will, are you not?�

As Mr. Howard&#8217;s attorney, I certainly was. By law, his property was to go to his late brother&#8217;s son, a young man named Trent Howard. The small fortune would be divided between Mrs. Howard and her two daughters, but they would be put out of their home. I had tried everything I could think of to put the property into Mrs. Howard&#8217;s name, but the law was not on our side. As I&#8217;d sweated through the unsuccessful case, I had thought how fortunate it had been for my Lady Emily, that her father had had no male relations to claim Wainwright Hall from her. The Howards were not so fortunate.

�My mother is going to London to stay with her uncle,� Mrs. Gainsley said. �She has invited me along, but I do not wish to leave the area. This is our home.� She was tearful then, and Emily put a comforting hand on her arm.

�Of course it is,� Emily said kindly. �We all adore you here.�

Mrs. Gainsley blushed. �I hate to bother you, as you&#8217;ve both been so kind to my sister,� she said. Miss Howard, our friend, was away in Greece visiting her relations, but no doubt would be called back before her father&#8217;s death. �I�I had heard around the village that you recently lost your nanny.�

�Why, yes,� Emily said. She realized Mrs. Gainsley&#8217;s intention. �Are you asking for the job, dear?�

Mrs. Gainsley nodded. �I am very good with children, you see, and�I don&#8217;t have anywhere to go, really. I would hate to be a burden to my in-laws, but they sold my husband&#8217;s house and he left me with nothing and�� The poor young woman burst into tears. I realized, as my Emily comforted her, how young she really was. She had married at 16, widowed at 17, and was only 18 as she sat sobbing helplessly on our patio.

�My parents wanted me to find another husband,� Mrs. Gainsley sniffed as Emily put an arm around her shoulders. �I&#8217;m not like Tatiana, I&#8217;m not independent as she is, oh, I�� She stood suddenly from her chair, burning with humiliation. �I&#8217;m terribly sorry. It must be the heat�I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s come over me�I&#8217;m sorry to have bothered you��

�Oh, Mrs. Gainsley, please stay,� Emily said, rising with her.

�The job is yours, Mrs. Gainsley,� I said, and that halted her. My wife looked at me in surprise, but she did not look displeased.

�Yes�yes, of course it is,� Emily agreed, and led Mrs. Gainsley back to her seat. �My husband and I were just discussing how we&#8217;ll be desperate for a new nanny soon, as we are trying to have another child.� This was a lie, but as my wife spoke it, I liked the idea. She&#8217;d come out so well from her first pregnancy that all of my fears were cast away. More children�fill the house. And keep my wife looking fat and lovely just for me. How I adored her in her pregnancies! And how I missed her sweet milk. She had recently stopped breast-feeding, and as a result, had stopped lactating. How I craved her sweetness again.

�Oh, you are both the kindest and most wonderful�� Mrs. Gainsley was overcome with emotion yet again, and my wife and I patiently waited out her outburst. As my wife looked over at me with a smile, I threw her a little wink. �It is no wonder that my sister adores you both so.�

�Do you know where she intends to go, when all of this is settled?� I asked, but of course I knew. She would take up residence at Wainwright Hall as well. My cock twitched suddenly at the idea; my own little whore-wife, and two sister-whores to play with us. Mrs. Gainsley, so pleasantly chubby and innocent still, would be a lovely treat. I even rubbed myself under the table, as subtly as I could, as we continued our conversation.

It was decided that Mrs. Gainsley would stay with her parents until her father&#8217;s inevitable death. Then, she would move into Wainwright Hall and begin her duties as our nanny. We worked out a generous salary for her, one that she first tried to refuse. �Oh, no,� she said, �Being able to stay here is more than generous enough.�

Emily laughed kindly. �We wouldn&#8217;t just not pay you, my dear Mrs. Gainsley! And besides, you are quite worth the price. Mina knows you, and she already likes you, so there won&#8217;t be any problems with you bonding with her. We know that our dear child will be in good hands with you.�

Mrs. Gainsley, with tears of gratitude, bid us goodbye soon after. As soon as she departed, my wife went to scoop our daughter up and bring her inside. As I waited for her at the door, I watched her carry our growing child, laughing and kissing the child&#8217;s soft cheek. �Well, my dear,� I said, �we better start working on getting pregnant, then. I think it&#8217;s nap time.�

�No nap, Daddy!� Mina cried, and Emily and I laughed.

�Yes, yes, time for a nap, my little one,� I said, taking the child from my wife&#8217;s arms. And though she fussed and whined, she was asleep by the time I laid her down in her nursery.

When I went into the master bedchamber, my wife was already naked and waiting for me by the bed. �How will you have me, sir?� she asked sweetly.

�On your knees, whore,� I snarled, and I saw my wife&#8217;s eyes light up at the harsh language. As I stepped toward her with my cock out, I said, �What do you think, my dear? Want to invite Mrs. Gainsley into our bedchamber?�

�She&#8217;s very innocent,� Emily said hesitantly.

�Do you find her attractive?� I asked, as my wife began to stroke my throbbing cock.

�Oh, yes,� Emily said. �Mrs. Gainsley is beautiful.�

�You were innocent once, too,� I reminded her. �And now you&#8217;re a perfect little whore. Suck my cock, my dear.�

�Yes, sir,� and she did so, gobbling me hungrily. My incredible little wife could sense exactly how I wanted it. She knew when I wanted slow, sensual fallacio; she knew when I wanted to ram my cock down her throat; she had a sixth sense when it came to my sexual appetites. 

She could tell that I was feeling adventurous that afternoon, so she spun around so that she was directly beneath me, putting her hands on my thighs as she took my testicles into her greedy mouth, sucking hard. I groaned, weak in the knees, as my wife encouraged me to squat down on the floor, where she laid herself down. I kept my balls in her mouth as she kept sucking sloppily and nibbling lightly, while jerking off my shaft with her sweet, soft hand. As she bit down on my testicles a little harder, she teased my asshole with the tip of her index finger. I have to be in a certain mood for ass-play, and I was in that mood that afternoon, so I cried out for her to shove her fingers in deeper. She obeyed, and as she wriggled her two fingers around in my asshole, I felt myself started to come. 

Biting harder on my balls, my wife pointed my cock at her own stomach, so that I ejaculated all over her. When she removed her fingers from me, I let out a little fart into her pretty face. �Sorry, my dear,� I said, and she giggled.

When I stood up, she stayed on the floor, slowly tracing her finger over the cum-mess on her stomach, sensually licking my cream from her finger. �Mmmmm,� she murmured with each lick, like a child sneaking forbidden tastes from a jar of preserves. �Sir, you are delicious.�

When she finished cleaning herself, I grabbed her by the collar (which she had slipped on after stripping for me, like a good little slave) and by the hair, pulling her to her feet. �Wasteful little whore,� I scolded. �You wasted my seed. How am I supposed to get you pregnant if you eat all of it?�

Emily giggled. �I&#8217;m sorry, sir. I have been a very wasteful girl. Will you punish me, please?�

�Of course I will,� I snarled, and still holding her hair and collar, led her to the far wall of our bedchamber. Months before, I had fastened shackles to the walls, two for Emily&#8217;s wrists high up on the wall, and two near the ground for her ankles (about three feet apart, forcing her to spread her legs). The servants, well aware of our bedroom activities at that point, politely ignored them during their daily cleaning.

I fastened my wife in with her back to the wall. �Look at those little tits,� I teased, cupping her left breast in my hand. �No more milk for your old friend?�

�No, sir,� she said. �I&#8217;m sorry.� She had even gone back to wearing her old nipple clips (just her very first pair, as her nipples were still sensitive from so many months of breast-feeding two hungry mouths).

�The only thing your tits are good for now,� I said, �are squeezing and flogging. Which shall it be today?�

�Oh, sir, use the cat-o-nine tails,� my wife begged, her nipples visibly hardening with excitement. In fact, her entire body had broken out in goose bumps, so excited was she. �Punish these useless tits, please, sir.�

�Very well,� I said, and retrieved the requested whip from our box of treasures in the closet. This was a new whip, one that we&#8217;d acquired from one of those taboo shops in London. I enjoyed taking my wife to those places, and having the raggedy perverts stare at the fine lady as she examined objects of torment and pleasure. When she had whispered to me how disgusted she was by the attention of these men, I made her offer her ass to one of them. Can&#8217;t have my sweet wife getting too uppity.

I also retrieved a blindfold and the handkerchief for a gag. We owned a few gags, but she enjoyed the handkerchief best. She said that it reminded her of our first night together, when I&#8217;d gagged her with it while sweetly raping her in our bed. I covered her eyes and shoved the gag in her mouth before delivering twenty painful blows to her tits, with a few on her stomach (now tight again, from her time outdoors walking and riding; I longed to see it bloated proudly with child again). 

The vicious whip left bloody cuts all over my wife, and she sobbed as I finished beating her and cleaning up her wounds. I covered her injured tits and stomach with soft kisses, and her whimpers of pain turned to moans of desire. Without removing her blindfold or gag, I fucked her right there on the wall, grabbing her by the shoulder and the arm and angling myself to thrust inside of her as deep as I could. I smashed my cock into her, rubbing my balls against her engorged clit as I fucked her. After I came, I licked up the mess of cum from her pussy as she moaned�I had denied her release, and decided to deny her for a while yet, leaving her naked and shackled for a little while as I went downstairs to attend to some paperwork.

I kissed her softly on the cheek before departing. �You stay here and be good,� I whispered teasingly. �Your friend will return to take care of you.� She moaned a protest, and I touched her cheek and laughed. �Patience, my sweet love, patience.� And I left her to wriggle and moan helplessly against the wall.

When I returned to her less than an hour later, she was near to explode. She had rubbed herself desperately against the wall, smearing her juices, but when I touched her pulsing clit, I knew she had been unsuccessful in getting herself off. I scolded her, �You naughty, messy whore. You&#8217;ve left quite a mess on the wall.� I removed her gag.

�Oh, please, sir,� she begged. �Please, I need it��

�Silence,� I ordered. �You will clean your mess first.� I unshackled her from the wall, and forced her to her knees, to lick up her juices from the wall. When she had finished, I took her by the hair and collar again and threw her to the bed. �Pleasure yourself,� I said. �I want to watch you.�

She bent her knees and lifted her hips, and began to rub her pussy desperately with one hand, while fingering her hole with the other. I grabbed my cock (not quite hard, not after two climaxes in the past couple of hours) and watched as Emily scrunched up her face in determination, finally giving herself an orgasm. An unsatisfying one at that; she sobbed in frustration, nearly having a temper-tantrum.

�Poor little Emily,� I teased. �She can please everyone but herself. Want your friend to help you?�

�Yes, sir. Please,� she sobbed, and I smiled and tied her up before eating her to a much more satisfying climax. I did not untie her, but did allow her to sleep when we were finished. I loved tormenting my little wife, and though she complained, she enjoyed it as well. Especially since she knew that she would get her pleasure in the end. As far as that went, I never let her down.


Following Mr. Howard&#8217;s death, Mrs. Gainsley and Miss Howard both came to stay at Wainwright Hall. They took rooms in the once-empty east wing, and I wasted no time in indoctrinating our new little friend into our routines.

Between the three ladies and myself, Mina was well cared for, and we all had our share of leisure time. When Mina was laid down for her nap the day after the sisters moved in, I requested that all three ladies join me in my office. They stood in line, my precious wife leading her friends, and awaited my orders. Emily and Miss Howard smiled knowingly, while Mrs. Gainsley looked puzzled.

�Well, ladies,� I said, pacing before them. �If we are all to be one happy family for the time being, we must establish order. Lady Emily, will you tell us who is the master of this house?�

�You are, sir, of course,� my wife answered promptly, and I nodded, addressing Mrs. Gainsley directly with my next words.

�My word is law in this house,� I explained. �I am a fair master, but I can be very tough as well. Now, my pretty ladies, off with your clothing.�

Mrs. Gainsley did not move except to open her mouth in shock as my wife and her sister quickly stripped off their summer dresses. �Well, Mrs. Gainsley?� I asked. �Are you part of this household?�

�Oh, sir, I don&#8217;t��

�Silence,� I said, and glanced briefly at my wife, who was giggling with excitement. �You will do as I command, or you are welcome to leave here. It is your choice, Mrs. Gainsley.�

Mrs. Gainsley looked desperately at her sister. �You never said��

Miss Howard laughed. �Don&#8217;t be na�ve, Bea. Why else do you think I&#8217;ve spent so much time at Wainwright Hall these past couple of years? You know my ways.�

�Lady Emily��

Emily kindly smiled at her shy friend. �Don&#8217;t be afraid, Mrs. Gainsley. We have a lot of fun here.�

�That&#8217;s right,� I said, stroking my wife&#8217;s neck affectionately. She had been wearing a high-necked dress that afternoon, so she already was wearing her collar. �I do enjoy an innocent young woman, Mrs. Gainsley. I have had my eye on you for some time now.�

The young lady blushed prettily, but said nothing, and made no move to remove her dress. I sighed, and decided to try another tactic. �Now, my dear Mrs. Gainsley,� I said softly, approaching her. �I want to make you feel good. Did your husband ever please you in bed?�

She flushed bright crimson, such a charming color on her, and shook her head. She looked more puzzled than ever. �I don&#8217;t��

�What was sex like, with your husband?� I asked. She still blushed, so her sister prompted her.

�Go ahead, Bea,� Miss Howard said. �Tell Sir Aaron what you told me.�

Mrs. Gainsley closed her eyes and whispered, �It was just�unpleasant. I would lie there, and he would grunt and sweat and pump into me, and�that&#8217;s all.�

My wife and I exchanged knowing glances. �Mrs. Gainsley,� I said gently, �Your husband knew nothing about how to please a woman. You do not enjoy sex, because you&#8217;ve never had a man properly make love to you. You&#8217;re a lovely woman, Mrs. Gainsley,� I said, and she opened her eyes and looked at me then. She was trembling. �You deserve to have a man who will please you the right way. And if I do say so myself, I am an adequate lover.�

�He is the best!� Miss Howard declared, and my wife nodded in agreement.

The young lady was softening, but she still made no move. �I&#8217;ll tell you what, Mrs. Gainsley,� I said. �Why don&#8217;t you watch what I can do to your sister? You and Lady Emily can sit on the couch, right there, and watch. Would you like to try that?�

�All right,� Mrs. Gainsley said hesitantly. Emily took her hand and led her to the couch, and they sat side-by-side (Mrs. Gainsley, in her heavy mourning dress; my wife, in her glorious nakedness) as Miss Howard stepped close to me and ran a gentle finger up my arm. That sexy little whore always knew what she was doing.

�Sir Aaron,� she whispered, �I&#8217;ve missed you so much while I&#8217;ve been away. I thought of you every time I was with a man.�

�Lady Emily and I missed you, too,� I said. �Isn&#8217;t that right, my dear?�

�Yes, sir,� my wife responded. She still held Mrs. Gainsley by the hand.

�Lie down on the floor,� I ordered, and Miss Howard did not hesitate to spread herself out on the expensive rug for me. I slowly removed my suit, and noticed that Mrs. Gainsley eyed my cock with curiosity (and just a touch of modest disgust). �Lady Emily,� I said to my wife, �Ask Mrs. Gainsley what you&#8217;ve wanted to know.�

Emily giggled and leaned close to Mrs. Gainsley to whisper in her ear. I knew what she was asking. Mrs. Gainsley, still blushing furiously, actually giggled. �Oh, goodness, no,� she declared out loud. �He was much, much smaller.�

The girls all laughed, and I grinned. �Well, Mrs. Gainsley,� I said, �Technique is often more important than size, but that does make an enormous difference. Watch.�

I climbed on top of Miss Howard, who stared up at me expectantly, biting her lower lip. I looked over at Mrs. Gainsley, who did not turn away as I plunged into her older sister. There was no need to prepare the whore with foreplay; she was more than ready. I held her wrists to the ground as she wrapped her legs around my waist and I knelt before her, fucking her with slow, deep strokes, getting into a steady rhythm. With my free hand, I groped her huge tits, squeezing them cruelly. And the entire time, I did not take my eyes off of Mrs. Gainsley, whose chest began to heave with excitement as she watched us.

I spoke to Mrs. Gainsley while I fucked her sister. �See how much she loves this, Mrs. Gainsley?� I grunted, pounding faster into Miss Howard. �I can do this to you, too, Mrs. Gainsley, I can fuck you like a whore and you&#8217;ll love it.�

�Oh, Aaron!� Miss Howard screamed, and I stopped groping her tits and slapped my hand over her mouth. I tore my eyes from Mrs. Gainsley for a moment to watch my wife, who was stroking herself with her free hand. I grinned at her.

�Lady Emily loves it to�she was an innocent girl like you, Mrs. Gainsley, and now she&#8217;s my good little whore.� As Emily grabbed Mrs. Gainsley and kissed her passionately, taking her hands and putting them on her clipped breasts, I thrust into Miss Howard frantically. I was about to explode�I had my own little harem of whores, it was a dream come true, my lovely wife and two beautiful sisters to play with us�Beneath my hand, Miss Howard screamed and groaned, and she lifted her legs higher, bending them back as far as she could, moaning as she came.

I kept thrusting, determined to hold out for a little while longer. I usually have good control; I can fuck my wife for well over an hour, but with three women present, I wouldn&#8217;t be able to go for long. Especially as my wife began slowly peeling off Mrs. Gainsley&#8217;s hideous dress, still kissing her roughly as she ran her hands down the younger woman&#8217;s shoulders.

I addressed Miss Howard directly for the first time since I&#8217;d started fucking her. �Relax for me, come now, Tatiana, come again for me�� And she did, so rapidly, screaming and drooling all over my hand as I released into her, groaning loudly myself. I kept my hand over Miss Howard&#8217;s mouth, even as I weakly removed myself from her. Her legs hit the floor and she did not move, only smiling at me as I sat up. We both stayed on the floor and watched the girls on the couch.

My Emily had successfully gotten Mrs. Gainsley naked, her black mourning dress in a discarded pile on the floor. Emily pushed her breasts against Mrs. Gainsley&#8217;s and began to finger her clit gently. I was amazed when Mrs. Gainsley began to open up her legs, slowly, to allow my wife access to her.

�Oh, Mrs. Gainsley, may I?� Emily asked softly. Mrs. Gainsley nodded fearfully, glancing over at me as my wife dropped off the couch and crawled between her legs. I smiled and nodded at Mrs. Gainsley.

�That&#8217;s it, let Lady Emily take good care of you,� I encouraged her. �She&#8217;s as good at pleasuring women as she is at pleasuring men, and she always leaves me satisfied.�

�Oh, God!� Mrs. Gainsley cried as my wife began lapping at her pussy with her greedy tongue. Her hands trembled visibly; she didn&#8217;t seem to know what to do with them as my wife began eating her cunt. I decided to help her, so I rose slowly from the floor and went behind the couch. I grabbed her by the elbows, and slowly ran my hands down her arms to her wrists, seizing them tightly and raising her arms over her head. I held her wrists with one hand and groped her large tits with the other as she moaned and shook.

�Come, now, Emily, really let her have it,� I encouraged my wife, and that prompted her to stab her tongue into Mrs. Gainsley&#8217;s cunt, wriggling it around as Mrs. Gainsley screamed in surprise and pleasure. Her screams took on a higher pitch as my wife tongue-fucked her and fingered her clit. Mrs. Gainsley&#8217;s nipples hardened, and I teased her left one, stroking it slowly before pinching it, just slightly, just twisting it enough to make her whimper between moans.

Mrs. Gainsley let out a whining scream, sounding almost pained as she had her very first orgasm. Tears ran down her plump cheeks as my wife lapped up her juices greedily. I let go of her wrists and went around to the front of the couch as my wife got to her feet. She offered me some of Mrs. Gainsley&#8217;s pussy juices that she&#8217;d wiped up with her fingers. I took my wife&#8217;s slender fingers in my mouth. �Mmmmm,� I sighed, and kissed my wife softly as Mrs. Gainsley trembled and sobbed before us.

I sent Emily to sit with Miss Howard in an armchair, and the girls sat together, their legs wrapped around each other as they watched me sit beside Mrs. Gainsley on the couch. When I put my arms around her, she laid her head on my chest, crying against me. I stroked her hair and comforted her, laughing softly. �There, there, Mrs. Gainsley,� I said. �Didn&#8217;t know it could be that wonderful, did you?�

�Oh, Sir Aaron, I never�� Mrs. Gainsley was at a loss for words. She looked up at me, a look of confusion in her dark eyes.

�It&#8217;s all right,� I said. �This is going to be a good thing, Mrs. Gainsley. We are all friends here, do you see? Me, and Lady Emily, and your sister and you. We&#8217;ll be a family, all of us together. And you&#8217;ll get to feel good like that every single day.�

�Are you going to�?� Again, the poor young woman didn&#8217;t know what to say.

I smiled at her. �If you want me to fuck you, Mrs. Gainsley, I&#8217;d certainly be happy to. I will tell you that I&#8217;m worn out now from your sister, and I want to save some love for my wife. We&#8217;ve all gotten pleasure here except for her. She certainly deserves it, don&#8217;t you think so?�

�Oh, yes, Sir Aaron,� Mrs. Gainsley agreed. I looked over at my wife, sitting so close to Miss Howard. She smiled over at me, looking expectant.

�After all,� I said softly, not taking my eyes off of my one love, �She is the reason we are all here together. It&#8217;s very important, Mrs. Gainsley, that you remember how much you owe to my wife, and that you think of her every time you get pleasure.�


When Mrs. Gainsley had calmed down a bit, I took my wife by the hand. �You ladies may have the rest of the afternoon to yourselves. We will tend to Mina when she wakes from her nap. My wife and I are going to spend some time alone now. Miss Howard?�

�Yes, Sir Aaron?�

�Gather up your sister&#8217;s mourning dresses and get rid of them.� I looked briefly at the two pretty, naked sisters before squeezing my wife&#8217;s hand and taking her upstairs. We walked naked through the house, not caring if the servants saw us, so high we were on our emotions. As I tied Emily to the bed, I whispered to her, �You have made all of my dreams come true, Emily.�

�You&#8217;ve done the same for me, sir,� she whispered back. I kissed her softly before gagging her and thanking her, the best way that I knew how, for giving me such a wonderful life.


The next couple of years with my little harem was like a dream come true. Instead of one little wife-slave to please me, I had three willing whores at my beck and call at all hours of the day and night. Mrs. Gainsley, such an innocent thing, was blossoming into a horny woman under our tutelage. What thrilled me most about her was that, even after all that time at Wainwright Hall, she still had an innocent way about her. She was certainly not an obvious whore, like her sister, nor an eager whore like my wife. She still blushed whenever I touched her breasts and whispered dirty things to her.

Mrs. Gainsley did not like physical punishment, and though I had threatened to throw her out if she did not participate during playtime, I did not push this issue. Emily was my one and only pain slut, so I saved it all for her. I never played with either Mrs. Gainsley or Miss Howard alone; Lady Emily was always present and active during our play. And my private time with my wife was more intense than ever.

The other ladies did not spend the night in bed with us; in fact, they never even entered the bedchamber. I often worried that my wife would become jealous about having two other women living with us and fucking me regularly, so I kept our bedchamber private. She never seemed discontented with our situation; indeed, when the three women were together (tending to the child, or tending to me), she looked happier than ever. She told me that she finally felt like she had real sisters of her own. �Except for the sex, of course,� she said with a giggle.

I should also note that Mrs. Gainsley and Miss Howard, being actual sisters themselves, did not play around with one another. In the beginning of our unconventional relationship, Miss Howard had teased her sister about this. If Mrs. Gainsley had not been so disgusted by the idea, I do believe that the sisters would have been together. The idea certainly turned me on, but sadly, it never happened. Still, we had plenty of fun together, and most importantly, with Alfonso occasionally thrown into the mix, I knew that my wife got all of the attention that she craved.

It would be a lie to say that I did not adore the sisters. I was particularly fond of Mrs. Gainsley, so sweet was she, and obedient (though it sometimes took a little prompting to get her to play along with some of our activities). And I loved her soft, chubby body. Sweet Emily had not been able to keep on any of her pregnancy weight, and though I always craved her little body and her tight ass, Mrs. Gainsley&#8217;s rolls and curves were a fascinating contrast. I particularly enjoyed watching my wife and Mrs. Gainsley, pleasuring each other on the couch in my office while Miss Howard sucked my cock.

Miss Howard was always a lot of fun, and very willing. I enjoyed her company, and found her to be amusing. But after everything that happened, I would find her presence to be an annoyance. I came to hate her, but I could see no way to be rid of her, and she would eventually become all that I had. Our happy times together, with my perfect wife and our two friends, would come to an end, much sooner than I ever would have feared. But, while it lasted, life was very good with my little harem.

A couple of months into my wife&#8217;s second pregnancy (it took her longer to become pregnant than we had anticipated), before she&#8217;d started to show, we were confronted with an awkward situation. One afternoon, while having some private time in our bedroom (I had Emily against the wall, her back and ass exposed to me as I whipped her with her favorite riding crop), we were interrupted by a tiny voice. �Daddy! What are you doing to Mummy?�

I turned, dropping the riding crop, and saw Mina standing in the doorway, tears in her big dark eyes. I scolded her. �Mina! You know the rules in this house. You are to knock before entering this bedchamber.�

�Why are you hurting Mummy?� Mina demanded fearfully. 

�I&#8217;m not hurting her, Mina,� I said, a bit more gently. I removed the gag from her mother&#8217;s mouth.

�It&#8217;s all right, Mina,� Emily concurred. �Daddy and I are playing a game, that&#8217;s all.�

I took my wife from the wall, and we both put on our robes and sat with Mina for a long talk. Mina, just three-years-old, sat curled in her mother&#8217;s lap as we told her about sex and love. �When adults care for each other, they want to make each other feel good,� Emily explained patiently. �Daddy and I play lots of games like that. That&#8217;s how we have fun and show our love for one another.�

�Doesn&#8217;t it hurt, Mummy?� Mina asked, referring to the gashes she&#8217;d noticed on her mother&#8217;s back.

�Yes,� Emily said carefully. �It does hurt. But�I enjoy it, too. It&#8217;s a game, Mina. Daddy would never really hurt me.�

We also explained to her that we liked to have fun with other adults as well, including her Auntie Bea and Auntie Ana. �Daddy and I like to make them feel good, too,� Emily explained.

�Daddy,� Mina said, �Do you love Auntie Bea and Auntie Ana?�

�Yes, darling,� I said softly. �I do love them. Not like I love Mummy, though. Mummy is my wife, and she is my soul mate. Auntie Bea and Auntie Ana are our special friends.�

�Now, Mina,� Emily added, �It&#8217;s very important that you not talk about what we just told you to anyone outside of Wainwright Hall. The things that adults do in their bedchambers are secret, and it is not appropriate to discuss it with others. We&#8217;ve just told you now so that you will understand and not be afraid. Can you keep this a secret?�

�Yes, Mummy,� Mina said cheerfully, and we both gave her a kiss on her fat little cheeks. �Will I play like that? When I&#8217;m an adult?�

Emily and I looked at each other for a moment. Emily looked startled at the idea; I bit back a loud laugh. �Well, Mina,� I said gently, �If you meet the right man, and marry him, you may want to play like that with him. But only if you really, really want to. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s fun, Mina. You should never let anyone make you do anything that you don&#8217;t want to do, or touch you if you don&#8217;t want to be touched. Do you understand?� I briefly remembered that I had forced her mother the very first time. Then again, I had plenty of evidence to show that in her heart, she had wanted to. If I&#8217;d never found those nipple clips�if I&#8217;d never read her secret diary or searched through her room�we never would have become lovers. I wondered what our lives would be like, if we were not together.

�Yes, Daddy,� Mina said. �I understand.�

�And from now on,� I added, �You must remember to knock before entering the bedchamber. Mummy and I do not wish to be disturbed during our private time together. All right, Mina?�

Mina nodded, and that was the end of it, for the time being. Mina would question her aunties on the subject later, and our friends recalled their own conversation to us (Miss Howard laughed hysterically as Mrs. Gainsley blushed with mortification). Though Mina&#8217;s interruption had caught us off guard, Emily and I had decided that, when she asked us about sex, we would be open and honest with her. That&#8217;s exactly what we had done, and we felt good about the discussion afterwards.

It would come back to haunt me, a few years later, after Emily was gone. Mina, nearly 10 at that point, had walked in on me and Mrs. Gainsley together, alone. I had chased after her, following the quick-footed child all the way to the stables before catching her by the arm and demanding an explanation for her invasion of my privacy.

�You don&#8217;t love Mummy anymore!� Mina accused me. Her words stabbed me in the heart; I slapped her, for the first and only time in her young life, and we&#8217;d stared at each other in shock before falling into each other&#8217;s arms and sobbing uncontrollably, right there on the grounds on Wainwright Hall.

�I do love Mummy,� I tried to explain. �I love her more than anything, Mina, I do, I&#8217;ve never stopped. I think about her all the time. But I&#8217;m lonely, Mina.�

�What about Mummy?� Mina demanded, but angry as she was, she still allowed me to hold her. �You said she&#8217;s thinking about us, and wishing she could be with us. How could you do this?�

�I&#8217;m sorry,� I said helplessly. �I&#8217;m sorry, Mina. I am a weak man.�

�When is Mummy coming home, Daddy?� Mina asked, and that was the question I&#8217;d been asking myself for over five years. When would she come home? When would our happy life together be able to continue? Life had gone on since her disappearance, and I wanted it all to stop, to stand still, until Emily came back to Wainwright Hall. I didn&#8217;t want her to miss her children growing up. I didn&#8217;t want her to miss anything at all.

�I don&#8217;t know, darling,� I answered truthfully, squeezing my daughter. �I don&#8217;t know. But I know that, wherever she is, she is trying to find the best and quickest way to get back to us. She never wanted to leave us, Mina, and when she comes home, we&#8217;ll all be a happy family again.� I desperately hoped�and I still desperately hope�that this was the truth.










Lady Emily&#8217;s Diary

3 June, 18&#8212;

It is the loveliest summer in years, the weather is so mild and comfortable, such appropriate weather to match the easy birth of my second child. A son. My husband, it being his turn to name our child, decided that our boy so resembled his late grandfather Sir Peter that he ought to bear his name. It is true that our son has my father&#8217;s light hair and complexion, and his cool green eyes. My Mr. Singer claims that my eyes take on a greenish hue when I cry, and he does enjoy looking at me with tears in my eyes. Particularly when the tears have been drawn through our rough play.

Or in times of great joy, like the birth of our sweet little Peter. He is the newest addition to our happy household, which now consists of myself, my wonderful Mr. Singer, our two perfect children, and two loving nannies to play with. I do enjoy having my two friends around, and they have been such a help since the birth of our boy. It is because of them that I even have time to write of more exciting news now.

My dear old friends Mr. and Mrs. Morrison are coming for a visit! I have kept correspondence with the dear lady over these years since my beautiful wedding in Calcutta, and she has often written of her desire to come and spend some time in her homeland. �I am particularly eager to visit with you, and to see your beautiful children,� she had written in her last letter, the one announcing their visit. �And,� she had added, �I cannot wait to play with you again, my sweet little pet.�

I do address her as �Mother� in these letters, I must confess. I do not fear them falling into the wrong hands, though our letters do often take on a sexual tone. I have been with several women over the years, and have spent much time with the sisters. But no woman has ever made me feel like Mrs. Morrison has. I confess that I have longed to be with her again, to take her brutally gentle (or gently brutal, pick your preference) treatment.

She and her husband (that dear, funny man) will not arrive for another four months, so I am certain that I will be recovered enough to my husband&#8217;s satisfaction for him to allow me to enjoy myself fully. He is ever careful with me now, just as he was for the first few months after the birth of our Mina. But he still enjoys suckling from my nipples, nibbling on me gently as he takes my milk. He never enjoys my milk in front of the sisters; no, only our sleeping child is present in the darkness of the nursery, as my husband kneels before me and takes my nipple in his mouth, squeezing my tit gently as he suckles.

I confess (again, such wicked confessions I must make!) that I would allow my dear �Mother� to drink from my breast. Oh, my dear husband, do forgive me if you happen to read this. I am ever devoted to you. You may punish me however you like for this.

One last confession, I am afraid. I do adore the sisters, I truly do. They are my very best friends, and their presence makes Wainwright Hall an even happier place, more full of love. But I do have some apprehensions about Mrs. Gainsley&#8217;s participation in our little games. She is not afraid to be with me; she gives and receives pleasure quite willingly (sometimes with a little persuasion from my dear Mr. Singer), but I feel that she does it more to please him than out of enjoyment for herself (or for me�after all, my husband believes that we all must have our share of pleasure). Mainly, I feel that she is not truly happy with us, but she feels that she has no place to go. I wish to set her up with someone, a nice man, but she politely puts each one of them off. 

My husband tells me to be patient. �If our dear Mrs. Gainsley were not happy with us, she would leave,� he says confidently. �She knows what her place is in this household, and if she desires more, she will have to look elsewhere.� I did not understand my husband&#8217;s meaning at first, but then I realized. She is resentful that she is not the lady of the house. Not outwardly, oh no. She is my very good friend, and has never treated me unkindly. Indeed, she falls all over herself to show me gratitude for my �kindness and generosity� in taking her in. But still�I get a strange feeling around her at times. I try to push it off and trust in my husband&#8217;s words.

Miss Howard is as fun and carefree as ever, laughing with us and with the children. She can become passionately angry at times, though this is rare. Mr. Singer insists that we maintain a household free of tension (sexual or otherwise), and arguments do not often erupt amongst us. But sometimes, late in the evening, my husband and I can hear from our bedchamber fervent voices coming from the east wing. We cannot often distinguish the words (the east wing being on the other side of the large manor), and my husband insists that we not pry in the quarrellings the sisters. It does not happen very often, perhaps a handful of times since the sisters moved in with us.

But only a couple of months before, the angry cries of Miss Howard rang so through the house that my husband felt compelled to see to it. I was in my final month of pregnancy with Peter, and he was angry that they were disturbing my sleep. �You stay right here, Emily, and I will try to restore peace,� he said, and to ensure that I would not follow him, he tied my wrists to the bedposts with a wicked smile on his face.

I was surprised, at one point, to hear my husband&#8217;s voice rise briefly in anger. I cannot recall ever hearing him yell so loudly in anger before, never, not in my entire life, and I feared that the argument had taken a turn for the worse. But the voices soon quieted, and near a half hour later, my husband returned to me, looking utterly exhausted.

�What happened?� I asked eagerly.

My husband gave me a reassuring smile. �Just a fight between sisters in close quarters, my dear. Siblings are that way at times, and our dear Miss Howard and Mrs. Gainsley sometimes succumb to their childish instincts. Not to worry, my dear,� he said, laughing softly at the worried look on my face. �Everything is fine.�

I know that I cannot understand the ways of brothers and sisters, as I grew up without any, but I cannot help but feel that my dear husband is keeping something from me. But I will have to wait and see; time has a way of revealing all truths, one way or another. For now, I will spend my energy preparing for the arrival of our dear friends. I will begin planning a big party for them, just as they threw one for Mr. Singer and me when we were visiting them in their home. I do intend to welcome them properly, and to show them what a lovely place Wainwright Hall really is. 

I hear my Mina calling to me from the stairs. It&#8217;s such a lovely afternoon, I will join her and the sisters in the garden for a while, until Mr. Singer calls me to his service. 


13 October, 18&#8212;

While everyone in the household finally goes to bed after a night of rough play, I will take some quiet time to recount the events of the past week thus far. I am not completely alone in the nursery. Little Peter, my sweet boy, sleeps quietly in his crib. He does not wake in the night near as often as his sister did at his age. He already sleeps soundly and untroubled. 

I am quite troubled, I am afraid. I will lay it all out here, and try to make some sense. Perhaps in my writing, my thoughts will straighten themselves out, as they often do.

Just a few short days ago, I was so looking forward to the arrival of our old friends. But I was quite nervous as well. You see, in all of the time that I&#8217;ve spent corresponding with my old friend, I did not confess to her my relationship with the sisters. She is aware of their presence, but only as help for the children. She does not know of our other activities, and I thought that it might be a shock for her, to walk right into the situation. I suggested to my husband that we meet the Morrisons&#8217; ship in London, and spend a couple of nights there �catching up� before bringing them home. Perhaps sensing my true purpose, my husband conceded.

I was determined to break it gently to Mrs. Morrison while we were all in London together, reliving the old days when the four of us would play together in Calcutta. I was so excited and nervous to see them again! My husband held my hand as we traveled by train. �Anxious to see your dear old &#8216;Mother&#8217; again?� he teased gently. I could only nod and smile.

When we arrived in London, Mr. Singer and I hired a carriage and rode to the docks, where we expected the ship to come in. It had already arrived, still docking when we pulled up, and we stepped out into the drizzling afternoon and stood by to wait on them. When the passengers finally began to climb down from the enormous ship, I carefully watched for my dear old friends. I spotted Mrs. Morrison, with her fair hair and fine clothes, almost right away among the other passengers. My husband, sensing my urge to go to her, released my hand from his. �I&#8217;ll wait here,� he simply said, and I hurried through the crowd to greet them warmly.

I spotted Mr. and Mrs. Morrison only a few feet away from me, and was almost taken aback by the sight of them. Mr. Morrison, the once-jolly man, looked sour-faced and much heavier than our last meeting. And my dear Mrs. Morrison, still lovely, was showing her age in lines and wrinkles. But still, I attributed this to the long trip (I remember how exhausting the travel could be), and rushed forward, smiling, to greet them.

�Welcome home, my dear friends,� I declared, and Mr. Morrison forced a smile, reaching to take my hand as his wife sprang forward to intercept me first. I found myself wrapped in her warm embrace.

�My dear, sweet Lady Emily,� Mrs. Morrison declared. She held me by the shoulders and smiled at me lovingly. �You look so beautiful, my dear. How are you?�

�I&#8217;m very well,� I said, a little surprised as Mrs. Morrison, completely disregarding her husband&#8217;s presence, asked of the children, of my husband, looking ahead in the crowd to wave at him as she took me by the arm and rushed me forward. I looked back at Mr. Morrison as we left him behind, to trudge slowly after us. Poor, dear man!

Mrs. Morrison greeted my husband with enthusiasm, but immediately gave all of her attention back to me as her husband approached. Mr. Singer gave his friend a proper welcome, and I saw the poor man smile genuinely for the first time. I found a way to interrupt Mrs. Morrison politely and extended my hand out in greeting. �How do you do, Mr. Morrison? It is so wonderful to see you again,� I said.

He kissed my hand. �I am well, my lady,� he said, but his pale continence suggested otherwise. �Tired from the journey, I am afraid��

�Oh, of course,� I said. �You poor dears. We must get you to the hotel and get you well-rested. We&#8217;ve gotten reservations at a wonderful place. Don&#8217;t you worry; we will take care of everything.� Mr. Morrison smiled at that.

�I&#8217;m not tired,� his wife declared. �Oh, I haven&#8217;t been to London in so long! I am ready to see everything.� She laughed at her husband, and though she tried to mask it in jest, it seemed more than a bit mean to me. �Let this old man rest up while we enjoy ourselves on the town. What say you, Sir Aaron?� 

�We have plenty of time in London to make sure that all of our�needs�are met,� my husband said calmly. He gave me a brief look. He could sense the tension as well as I. I realized then that in my frequent correspondence with my friend, I had been hinted to some turbulence in their marriage. I could not place the source, and she had not gone into very much detail. I made the decision, at that moment, to try to help my friends through their trouble during the time with us. I will recount here how I have failed thus far.

We took the carriage to our hotel, a newly-built place. We had two suites reserved, right next to one another, which would make our nighttime activities a bit more private. My husband and I left the Morrisons at their room and went into our own. As soon as the bellhop left our bags, my husband said, �Tell me what you are thinking, Emily.�

With my husband, I can be as candid as I like, so I did not try to pretend that everything was fine. �Something is different with him,� I said. �He looks so�old.�

My husband smiled, but it was a sad smile. �We&#8217;re all old, compared to you, my young one.�

�You know what I mean, though,� I insisted, and he nodded. �They&#8217;re different with each other, too.�

�I daresay,� my husband mused, �that they are not in love anymore.�

�How sad!� I declared. 

�Unfortunately, my dear, it happens all the time,� my husband said. He put his arms around me. �People fall out of love with one another, and spend the rest of their lives loathing the other&#8217;s existence.�

�But why, sir?� I asked. 

My husband shook his head. �Who&#8217;s to say? Love takes work, Emily, and some people get tired and don&#8217;t want to put in the effort anymore.� He kissed me in a comforting way, a way that told me that he&#8217;d never stop working, that we would never be so unhappy together.

�Can we fix it?� I asked.

My husband shook his head and stepped back from me. �It&#8217;s up to them, Emily. All we can do is show our friends a good time while they&#8217;re here. You&#8217;re very good at that.�

I nodded, but I was determined that I would find some way to solve this problem. As I wondered what to do, I unpacked the luggage that my husband and I packed. I decided that the following day, I would discuss the matter privately with my friend Mrs. Morrison. I had no doubt that she would confess herself to me.

Mrs. Morrison wasted no time in joining us, leaving her husband alone in their suite. �Mr. Morrison wishes to have his rest,� she said, rolling her eyes a bit. She grinned at me. �What do we have planned for this evening?�

My husband was very calm and friendly. He did not address Mrs. Morrison&#8217;s remarks about her husband. He suggested that the three of us take in dinner and a theater show, as we were staying quite close to the West End district. �Afterwards, we can come back here for a little fun,� Mr. Singer said, throwing me a little wink.

Mrs. Morrison looked at me as well. �I can&#8217;t wait,� she said.

We all changed for dinner, and while we were alone, I briefly served my husband with my mouth. Taking me gently by the hair, he remarked, �I won&#8217;t have you all to myself much longer, my dear. Our friends are going to keep you quite busy this next fortnight.�

So far, that has certainly been the case. That evening, we had a lovely dinner at the hotel, and Mrs. Morrison was her cheerful, talkative self at dinner, entertaining us with various stories of life in Calcutta. She then bombarded us with questions about the children. �Whom do they most resemble?� she asked at one point.

�Our little Mina has the features of my family,� Mr. Singer said. �And Peter looks like Emily&#8217;s father.�

�Neither of them resemble their mother?� Mrs. Morrison asked, looking a bit disappointed.

�They&#8217;re lovely children,� I added, feeling a little bit defensive. My children, in my eyes, are flawless.

�Oh, to be sure,� Mrs. Morrison agreed readily. �I cannot wait to meet them. Are they well-behaved children, or naughty little things?�

�Peter is still an infant yet,� I said. �He sleeps peacefully; I suppose that is as well-behaved as one so young could be, is it not?�

�Mina takes after her mother, in some ways,� my husband added. He gave me a mischievous look. �She is a good girl, but very inquisitive, and bold.�

I was surprised to hear these traits attributed to me. �I am this way, sir?�

�Most certainly,� Mr. Singer said affectionately, and I smiled at him. My dear husband is the most thoughtful man I&#8217;ve ever known. It is moments like these that allow me to remember, all over again, why I have given my life to worshipping and serving him. I know that he will always fulfill my needs.

I almost forgot that our friend was with us. I gave her a guilty smile, and we resumed our conversation. We went on to the show in another rented carriage, and it was delightful, but nothing special. My husband secured us the best seats in the theater. He did not do this by dropping his title (which, as he never fails to remember, came from me), or by putting down money (though he did tip the theater staff generously). Mr. Singer has such an impressive carriage. He just looks like an important man. He is so sexy, and has gotten even sexier as his hair has started to gray. His dark hair is graying evenly at his temples, and though he laments his aging, I find him more irresistible than ever.

As we waited briefly for our carriage outside of the theater, a beggar woman approached us. Mrs. Morrison, having years of practice ignoring raggedy beggars in the streets of Calcutta, did so here, but I cannot ignore the plight of a poor person. This girl looked to be my own age, and I wondered, as she implored us for a little spare change, if she were not an orphan like I. If I didn&#8217;t have my Mr. Singer to protect me all of my life, to keep me (and my fortune and title and home) safe from greedy hands, I might have lived this young woman&#8217;s life. I gave her a 10-pound note, an amount that my husband considered to be extravagant, and the poor woman kissed my hands.

�Ye are a fine lady, miss,� she said, tears running down her grubby face. �God bless ye, miss.� She hurried away with her newfound fortune, and I prayed that it would be of significant use.

My husband looked ready to scold me, but he must have read something in my face, and he softened. �Silly thing,� he said lovingly, putting his arm around me as the carriage pulled up to receive us.

As we rode back to the hotel, Mrs. Morrison expressed her surprise by my behavior. �My dear lady,� she said, �I know you mean well, but what do you think she will do with that money?�

�Perhaps she will purchase some food,� I said. �Or some temporary lodging. She was clearly in need.�

�Now, now, my ladies,� Mr. Singer said lightly. �None of that. As soon as we get back to the hotel, we should see to Mr. Morrison. Perhaps we&#8217;d all enjoy a little time together. It&#8217;s been so long.�

�Indeed,� Mrs. Morrison agreed sincerely, giving me another dirty look. I tried to put aside my annoyance and put my mind to the task ahead. I looked forward to having the chance to please my dear old friends again, and I smiled.

My husband and I went into our room while Mrs. Morrison saw to her husband. She joined us quickly, reporting that he was not feeling well. 

�Oh, dear,� I said. �Perhaps we should call in a doctor for him.�

�He only requires rest, the old thing,� Mrs. Morrison said. �He&#8217;s quite all right.�

I wanted to protest. I did not like the idea of poor Mr. Morrison, all alone and sick in a strange room. I wondered how his own wife, who had loved him so much, could be so cold to him now. 

My husband, sensing my discomfort, rubbed the back of my neck to distract me. �We&#8217;ll see to our friend in the morning,� he whispered in my ear. �Relax, my dear. Aren&#8217;t you in the mood to play tonight?�

If I had reported that I was not, my husband would have certainly granted me a reprieve. But I looked at Mrs. Morrison, my dear friend, and I had missed being with her so much. Yet again, I pushed my troubles aside, and resumed my role as &#8216;Mother&#8217;s naughty little pet.&#8217;

We had such fun that evening! As before, Mr. Singer first sat back and watched us together before joining in. Mrs. Morrison tore off my dress, and while she was still clothed, forced me to my knees before her. �Have you missed me, my pet?� she asked softly, stroking my face and looking down at me affectionately.

�Yes, Mother,� I answered, my voice naturally becoming smaller and more child-like. 

�Mother&#8217;s missed you too, little pet,� Mrs. Morrison cooed. It was just like old times. She lifted up her dress and instructed me to crawl beneath her, allowing the dress to hide my crouching form as I located her pussy. Mrs. Morrison wore no other undergarments under her petticoat, so it was easy to find. She let out a squeal of surprise as I began licking her enthusiastically.

�Slowly, my pet,� Mrs. Morrison instructed. �Nice and slow�oh, yes, my pet, good girl.� She squatted on my face, as she had before, and I was completely blinded by her thighs and her skirt as I followed her orders. My heart began to race as I lapped at her, stopping occasionally to tease her hole with my tongue.

�Naughty thing!� Mrs. Morrison scolded me. �This little pet loves to taste her mother. Such a good little whore. Lick Mother&#8217;s ass, now, that&#8217;s it.�

I don&#8217;t enjoy licking ass as much as others (like my dear friend Miss Howard, who cleans me out quite often), but I did so gladly, fingering Mrs. Morrison&#8217;s cunt (surprising tight; I wondered if she hadn&#8217;t been getting her share of pleasure lately). All I could hear were her moans of pleasure through the skirt. As I took in the smell of her clean ass, I wanted to make her come quickly. I was starting to feel a little cramped under her skirt, so I pleased her as my own master would please me, and got her to orgasm with relative haste. As my husband never fails to remind me, I am quite skilled when it comes to pleasing others. I have never failed to not only get someone off, but to give that person the best experience of his or her life. I take great pride in this.

When I was out from under Mrs. Morrison&#8217;s skirt again, I stayed on my knees and looked up at her, awaiting the next orders. She smiled down at me. �Still a good little girl, are you?�

�Yes, Mother,� I said. I watched as she began peeling off her dress.

�Sir Aaron,� Mrs. Morrison addressed my husband, �Is this young lady&#8217;s cunt still off-limits?�

�As it always will be,� my husband replied calmly. I glanced over my shoulder at him briefly. He was sitting back, a very relaxed look on his face, stroking his cock. �But have you noticed her tits, Mrs. Morrison?�

�They&#8217;re glorious,� Mrs. Morrison declared. She had stripped naked now. She put her hand under my chin, softly. �Stand up, my pet.�

I rose slowly and stood before her. Mrs. Morrison is a small woman, but I am always surprised by this when I am standing close to her. I am only a little taller than she, but I&#8217;m hardly ever taller than anybody. It feels more natural to sit beside her�or at her feet, or to be on my knees before her. 

Mrs. Morrison smiled at me and began groping my breasts. �You haven&#8217;t breast-fed all day,� Mrs. Morrison observed.&nbsp; �How are your tits feeling, my pet?�

�A little sore, Mother,� I answered truthfully. I was looking forward to some relief, and I have already confessed that I have fantasized about my dear &#8216;Mother&#8217; drinking from me. My nipples hardened at the thought, and Mrs. Morrison rubbed my nipples with her thumbs, a little too roughly.

�How does it feel?� Mrs. Morrison asked softly.

�It feels good, Mother,� I answered, pressing my tits against her, encouraging her to rub me harder.

Mrs. Morrison smiled at me, her groping changed to a soft nipple rubbing. �No, my naughty little pet. How does it feel to breast-feed a child?�

I was taken aback by the question. It seemed out of place during our playtime. �Oh,� I said, pausing for a moment. �Why�it feels really nice.� I was not at all certain how to put it into words, and I was terribly caught off guard.

Mrs. Morrison smiled at my discomfort. �You know that your dear Mother has no milk for you to drink, my pet.� I nodded uncertainly. �We&#8217;ll have to do this the other way around�if your husband will allow it.�

I glanced over my shoulder again, looking at my dear Mr. Singer expectedly. He seemed surprised for a moment, before he smiled. �My little cow has the freshest, sweetest milk,� he bragged, and I giggled before turning my attention back to my dear friend.

Mrs. Morrison decided that she wanted to tie me up and suckle from me, and I was not at all opposed to this idea. With my husband&#8217;s silk ropes, she tied me to one of the armchairs. My arms were up, my elbows bent, and my wrists tied behind my neck (and attached to my collar, which Mr. Singer kindly provided). This caused my engorged breasts to stand up a little taller. Another rope bound my torso to the back of the chair, just under my tits. My legs, of course, were spread wide and bound, allowing Mrs. Morrison to easily slide between them and take my left nipple in her greedy mouth.

She suckled me harder than anyone has, even nibbling on me a bit as she drank my milk. She was not able to extract much milk, so I timidly said, �Mother, you must squeeze my breast a little while you suckle.�

�Thank you, my sweet pet,� Mrs. Morrison said, and after taking my suggestion, she drank of me easily. She sucked so hard, it hurt. I grimaced and moaned, and she squeezed my tit harder. I don&#8217;t think she so much enjoyed the taste of my milk (as my husband genuinely does), but more the erotic experience of drinking from me.

My husband soon stripped and joined her. He took my other nipple in his mouth, and though he did not squeeze or suckle as hard as Mrs. Morrison, he was a bit rougher on me than usual. As he drank, he fingered my clit, stroking me. I squirmed in my awkward position, trying to raise my hips to meet his gentle stroking, but the rope around my torso constrained me.

I&#8217;d never had two mouths drink of me at once. Mr. Singer only drank from me when we were alone, never sharing the time that I spent bonding with our children. As they wrapped their warm lips around my nipples and pulled and sucked and licked me, I felt a sudden need to be fucked hard. I&#8217;d never needed it more in my life. I moaned, longing for my husband&#8217;s cock inside of me. �Oh, sir,� I murmured as he fingered me. �Oh, please�� I could feel that my inner thighs were already slicked wet with my own juices.

�What do you think, Mrs. Morrison?� Mr. Singer asked. �Has Lady Emily been a good little girl?�

Mrs. Morrison stopped suckling for a moment and looked thoughtful. �Perhaps she&#8217;d like Mother to play with her ass while her husband fucks her?� My toes curled with excitement at the thought. What did my wicked friend have in mind for me?

�I have just the thing for her,� my husband said, and he left briefly (while Mrs. Morrison stroked my aching nipple and eyed my cunt enviously) to retrieve the same large leather phallus that is so much a part of our bedroom play. Mrs. Morrison looked delighted.

�Mother&#8217;s going to tear up your ass with that monster,� she mused playfully, and she untied me from the chair as my husband prepared the bed. I was dismayed when Mrs. Morrison left my arms in their uncomfortable position as she led me in to the bedchamber portion of my suite, where Mr. Singer was waiting. They decided to attach my bound wrists and elbows to the ceiling, the room having low beams. 

When I was strung up securely, standing almost up on my toes, Mrs. Morrison showed me a surprise gift. It was a metal bar, about three feet in length, to which shackles were attached at the end. �You&#8217;ll wear this to keep yourself wide for Mother, little pet,� she explained, and as she forced my legs apart she said, �I picked this up at a quirky estate auction in Calcutta. It was from the home of this reclusive British widow, who only had the company of her Indian manservant. When she died, they found the man, thirty years her junior, chained up in the basement! He&#8217;d been her willing sex-slave, and they were legally married, too. The poor man.�

�Perhaps they should have had more playmates,� Mr. Singer mused, and I smiled. Before they fucked me, Mrs. Morrison expressed a desire to gag me, and my husband produced one of our many gag-balls, shoving it kindly into my mouth and fastening it carefully behind my head. 

My husband stood before me, stroking his cock. He touched my face, stroking my skin around the leather harness. �Good little girl,� he purred softly, and I trembled. He continued to tease me, stroking my slit softly, as Mrs. Morrison prepared the phallus. They entered me simultaneously, and my dear husband kept pace with Mrs. Morrison&#8217;s rough fucking of my ass. 

It still makes me flush to admit this, but I do love being fucked and used, especially by my dear husband. I love pleasing him in every possible way, giving him everything that he wants. I would do anything for him, anything at all. I wanted desperately to express this to him as he fucked me that night, pulling my hair and kissing me roughly as he wrapped his legs around me and thrust into me. I could only tell him this by my compliance�and by my moans of pain and satisfaction.

As Mrs. Morrison abused my ass with the phallus, she slapped my thighs and ass cheeks with her free hand, leaving me quite bruised and sore the following day. She can be quite vicious to me at times, but I find that I love it. I imagine my mother and young Lydia together, playing their whorish games, with my mother taking the abuse and loving it as I do. My longing for pain and punishment is the only real link that I have to my mother.

I threw my head back as Mr. Singer began stroking my clit, not ceasing in his hard, fast fucking. Waves of pleasure ran through my body. Mrs. Morrison, still thrusting the phallus into my ass (and sending waves of pain through me with the pleasure, simultaneously, it was so indescribably delicious), grabbed my hair and forced my head back. She kissed my neck, nibbling at me roughly in my sensitive places, biting me softly around my collar. 

I screamed into the huge gag, my bound body shaking in mad spasms as I came. My husband grabbed my shoulders and thrust into me one last time, releasing into me. I found myself hoping that I would get pregnant that very night, it had been so wonderful and intense. As my husband released from me, our juices spilled down my thighs, trickling onto the floor.

My husband kissed my cheek softly, caressing my rock-hard nipple. He whispered in my ear, �Good girl, Emily. Did you enjoy your playtime tonight?�

I nodded, letting out a muffled sound. I&#8217;m not sure what I was trying to say. Perhaps I was trying to thank him, for allowing me to be his whore, and for allowing me to play with others. He smiled at me lovingly, he was so handsome, and I was bursting with love for him.

My cruel master and my dear friend left me strung up for a short while, as they sat at the small table in the bedchamber and enjoyed another drink. My husband, looking my way with that same wonderful, wicked glint in his eye, held up his glass of whiskey and declared, �Let us drink a toast to our dear Lady Emily. She is our sweet little dear, is she not?�

�The sweetest,� Mrs. Morrison agreed, and they drank to me, laughing softly as I squirmed. My arms felt most uncomfortable, and my husband eventually took pity on me and untied me. But, in keeping with our play, he secured my arms behind my back, tying my wrists again in a much more comfortable position, and had me crawl on my knees to sit at their feet at the table. I still wore my gag as Mrs. Morrison reached down to stroke my hair.

�Such pretty hair,� she mused. �Your mother used to wear her hair shorter, but it was dark and wavy like yours, my pet. So pretty.�

After their nightcap, Mrs. Morrison departed to her room, but only after removing my gag and kissing me softly on the lips. �I&#8217;m so glad I&#8217;m here with you, my sweet little pet,� she murmured in my ear. 

�I am, too, Mother,� I whispered, my voice still trembling from the intensity of our play. Mr. Singer kissed Mrs. Morrison goodnight before she dressed hastily and departed to her room. I wondered briefly, as my husband untied me, how Mr. Morrison was feeling.

We fell into our bed, both naked, holding each other close. My husband stroked the soft skin of my breasts, avoiding my sensitive nipples. �Glad your &#8216;Mother&#8217; is here, Emily?� he asked softly.

�Yes, sir,� I said. �I have missed her.�

�I know, my dear,� my husband said, sounding a little sad for a moment.

�Sir,� I whispered, �I&#8217;m terribly worried about Mr. Morrison.�

My husband chuckled softly. �Not to worry, Emily. Morrison is a strong man. He was a little shaky like this after our trip to Africa years ago, but he recovered just fine. Perhaps you might see to him yourself in the morning?�

I smiled, knowing what my husband intended for me to do. �Yes, sir,� I said.

I fell asleep happily (I think it was the last time I&#8217;ve done so since then) in my husband&#8217;s arms, thoroughly exhausted and feeling much better. 

I wish to continue my narrative, but my husband is calling me back to bed. He and I have been quarreling, I&#8217;m afraid, but I will have to explain when I have another free moment. I do not wish to displease him any further.


15 October, 18&#8212;

As a couple of days have passed since I have last written, I do not feel much more at ease about the current happenings at Wainwright Hall. Let me write hastily and explain, though there is so much to be told! I have feigned exhaustion, and my husband has granted me a private nap, though I believe he knows my true intention. He scolded me lightly when I came back to bed the other night, after having stayed up writing for over two hours.

�You think I do not notice when you are not by my side?� he asked me as I slid in beside him. �The loss of your warmth beside me never fails to awaken me.�

I had not been aware of this. �I&#8217;m sorry, sir,� I whispered.

My husband kissed my forehead. �Poor, dear little Emily. Are you still troubled, my love?�

�Yes, sir,� I admitted timidly.

�Emily,� my husband said, almost sitting up a little in the dark, looking down at me, �This is why I ask you not to involve yourself in the troubles of others. It only causes you grief, especially if you are not able to provide them with your help.�

I was ready to protest, but this had led to our previous fight, the worst we&#8217;d ever had (not just as man and wife, but in all our time together as dear friends and companions). I swallowed slowly and whispered, �Yes, sir.�

�Do I need to tie you to the bed at night?� Mr. Singer continued to scold. �You are a nursing little mother. You need your rest.�

�Yes, sir,� I said again. �I&#8217;m sorry, sir.� I just wanted him to hold me and not be upset with me.

�Do not placate me, little girl,� my husband said, a bit more harshly than before. I wondered why he was so quick to anger.

�I&#8217;m not, sir,� I said desperately. I sat up with him and looked at him imploringly in the dark. �I know that you know what is best for me, sir. Please understand that I cannot help my meddlesome nature. Please do not be angry with me for it, sir. I do not wish to defy you.�

My husband softened, and he held me close then, as I wanted him to. �I know it, Emily,� he whispered. �You just care too much.� Oh, if he only knew the horrible truth!

I was relieved that another fight had not erupted, and my husband has been gentler with me since. I believe he feels guilty for exploding at me in London�allow me to explain what happened.

The morning after our first night in London, my husband and I woke early to bathe each other, making love in the large tub. We went down to breakfast, and were surprised to find Mrs. Morrison already sitting alone. Before she spotted us, Mr. Singer pulled me aside. �Emily,� he said, �You should go and see to our friend now. I will keep Mrs. Morrison company for breakfast. I&#8217;ll have a tray brought up for you.�

I kissed him softly. �Yes, sir,� I said, and went back upstairs. I knocked softly on the door to the Morrisons&#8217; room. 

�It is open,� Mr. Morrison called, sounding better than he had the day before. I entered and locked the door behind me, and found him sitting up on the lounge chair, covered in a blanket and propped up with a pillow, but smiling as he set the newspaper aside. �My dear Lady Emily! Good morning, my lady.�

He still looked pale, but some of his reddish color was coming back to his face. Smiling, I approached him. �I&#8217;ve been worried about you, Mr. Morrison,� I said.

�Come and sit with me, Lady Emily,� Mr. Morrison said. �It&#8217;s very kind of you to come and see me before you&#8217;ve had your breakfast.�

�I&#8217;m having something brought up for us,� I said, sitting at the end of the lounge chair, by his feet. �Could you eat?�

�Certainly, my lady,� he said. 

�You are feeling much better?� I asked.

�Well enough,� Mr. Morrison said, and for a moment, his smile almost resembled a grimace. Seeing my concerned look, he smiled again. �Now, my dear lady, I assure you that I&#8217;m quite fine. Just a touch of seasickness.� 

I nodded and forced a smile. �We missed you last night,� I said. I hoped that Mr. Morrison would pick up on my advances, but he kept his light, conversational tone.

�Well, I&#8217;m feeling well-rested now, and I&#8217;m eager to see some old friends today,� Mr. Morrison said, almost in a rushed manner. 

�How wonderful!� I declared, just as I heard a knocking on the door. I shot up to retrieve the breakfast tray, tipping the server generously before laying out the spread. I served Mr. Morrison his plate before going for my own.

�Thank you, Lady Emily,� Mr. Morrison said when I joined him. He looked thoughtful for a moment. �You know, you do not seem like a spoiled little rich girl.�

�I most certainly am spoiled,� I said with a smile, thinking of my generous husband, �But I was raised not to act like it.�

�It&#8217;s no wonder�� I looked at Mr. Morrison, waiting for him to complete his thought. But he merely smiled and dug into his breakfast, thankfully with a veracious appetite.

I hoped that after he&#8217;d had his fill, he would be in the mood to play. I still felt the tension in the room, though we conversed as easily as ever. But the conversation became serious when I put the dirty plates aside and served more tea. Mr. Morrison began telling me of the days in Africa with my father and Mr. Singer, speaking with such longing. He even said, �Those were the best days of my life. What I wouldn&#8217;t give to relive those!� He looked so sad all of a sudden, I wanted to find some way to cheer him up.

�Mr. Morrison, there are many happy days to come,� I said reassuringly, placing my hand on his leg.

�Yes,� he said, in a tone that conveyed quite the opposite meaning.

�Come now, my dear friend,� I said kindly, running my hand up his thigh, feeling him through the blanket. He was wearing only his bedclothes. �I was so glad at heart to see you and your dear wife again, but to see you so sad�Come now,� I purred, �let me make you feel better.�

�No, my lady,� Mr. Morrison said, with such firmness that I removed my hand and stood. He looked up at me, a darkened look on his face. �I&#8217;m sorry, Lady Emily, but I cannot be a playmate of yours any more.�

�But why, Mr. Morrison?�

He looked on the verge of tears! The poor man. But he pulled himself together. �I cannot say, Lady Emily,� he said, his voice determined. �I am afraid that that is between myself and my wife.�

�Do you�� I swallowed for a moment, afraid to ask. �Do you wish for me to stop seeing her as well?�

He almost smiled at that. �Please forget we had this discussion, my lady. Please do not speak of it to my wife or your husband.�

I nodded, uncertain of what to say.

�I&#8217;m going to get myself together,� Mr. Morrison said. �Thank you for seeing to me, my friend, and for breakfast. No, no,� he said as I reached for the dirty dishes, �Leave those.�

�I�I will see you later, then,� I said hesitantly, stepping toward the door. Mr. Morrison nodded. �Goodbye, then,� I said, and stepped out into the hallway. I nearly ran right into my husband, as he stood waiting for me.

�Well!� he said, a smile on his face. �Is our friend feeling better, then? What&#8217;s the matter, my Emily?� he asked, a concerned look on his face, having noticed the look of shook on mine.

�Oh! Oh, nothing, sir,� I said, forcing a smile. �Mr. Morrison is ready to see the city today.�

�Very good,� my husband said, still looking concerned. �Were you able to work your magic on him?�

�I&#8217;m afraid not,� I said. �He�he wasn&#8217;t feeling up for any of that today.�

Mr. Singer nodded, asking for no other explanation, and we went into our room briefly to prepare for the day. My husband and Mr. Morrison would go about visiting with old friends, and Mrs. Morrison and I would take in the city alone. After my discussion with her husband that morning, I was more determined than ever to unearth the cause of their marital strife. 

We agreed to meet the men for dinner, and after our husbands left us, Mrs. Morrison took my arm and gushed, �Just the girls again, as it should be. Shall we spend a small fortune, my pet?�

I am still a discretionary shopper, as my husband has always encouraged me to be, but I was planning to pick up some gifts and things for the children and the sisters. I thought it might be a good opportunity to confess my involvement with them to my dear old friend. Perhaps then, I thought, she would be more apt to confess herself to me as well. 

And so, Mrs. Morrison and I spent the morning shopping. As we browsed the stores, she was certainly her old self again, moving near a mile a minute and trilling loudly all the while, insisting that I try on this such thing and that such thing, insisting on paying for it all.

�Mrs. Morrison!� I finally cried, gasping at her decadence. �My dear, I assure you that I am in no need of new clothing.�

�Oh, but come now, you look so pretty in the well-fitting grey one,� Mrs. Morrison insisted. Softly she added, �Such a pretty little pet, come, let Mother spoil you.�

I shook my head and sighed, nearly resigned. �Mrs. Morrison��

�Oh, please, Lady Emily?� Mrs. Morrison cried. �Nothing would make your old friend happier than to spend her husband&#8217;s money on you.�

There was no stopping her, and she arranged to have all of the items delivered to Wainwright Hall. I wondered how I might put a stop to it before the delivery came, fearing what my husband would say (here&#8217;s a hint: he wasn&#8217;t very happy). I came out of the trip with nothing for the children, so engrossed had I been in Mrs. Morrison&#8217;s little dress-up fantasy game. Exhausted, I suggested lunch, and we found a place and settled in to a small, private dining room.

Finally, I got down to admitting to Mrs. Morrison my involvement with the sisters. I had already explained to her how Mrs. Gainsley had come to stay with us (though I still had not confessed Miss Howard&#8217;s involvement in the murder of her sister&#8217;s husband�nor my own involvement in the cover-up), merely saying that her sister, my oldest friend, was there to care for the children as well. When I finally confessed that we were all playmates, and that we all took turns serving my husband and each other, Mrs. Morrison&#8217;s eyes lit up.

�Oh, my dear,� she said, taking my hand on top of the table. �I&#8217;m not at all surprised by this.�

�You&#8217;re not?�

Mrs. Morrison shook her head, laughing. �My sweet little pet,� she said, �You are a whore. You�you need to give and receive love. And you do love women, don&#8217;t you, my pet?�

I had to confess it. I love the soft skin of a woman&#8217;s breast (particularly Mrs. Gainsley&#8217;s, so full and fat her breasts are), and the sweet kiss of a woman (particularly Mrs. Morrison). And I do love eating pussy�I had confessed as much to my husband years ago, and he laughed at me softly, instantly turned on. A nod of agreement was all that Mrs. Morrison required of me then.

She grinned again and nodded. �I look forward to meeting your friends. But�� Her smile faded, and she looked troubled. �I do have one concern about this little�situation.�

�Do tell, Mrs. Morrison,� I said.

�Well, my dear,� Mrs. Morrison said, �It would seem to me that you have made your husband the luckiest man in the entire country.�

�That is my goal,� I said proudly. I did not see where the problem would lie in that.

�Do you not think, Emily, that you could make him happy on your own?� 

Now, do not think that this thought has not crossed my mind, on occasion, over the last couple of years. I have sometimes found myself wondering why my husband sought the company of other women (though never without me by his side). But when my thoughts wandered there, I would remind myself how much I myself enjoy the company of others, men and women alike. I partake in their company willingly and gladly, knowing that it is my husband&#8217;s wish that I enjoy myself fully. This I explained to Mrs. Morrison at lunch that afternoon.

Mrs. Morrison nodded. �I have no doubt that your husband loves you, my dear. He worships you�I could tell, from the way he spoke of you at breakfast.�

I flushed to hear this. �He is very good to me,� I said.

�Only�do be cautious, my pet,� Mrs. Morrison said. �Your husband is a fine specimen of a man, and I daresay that many women would do most anything to get their claws into him.�

I nodded. I know this full and well. But I trust my friends. And I trust my husband, more than anyone else in the entire world. I decided to steer the conversation, and I said, �Mrs. Morrison�is everything all right with you and your husband?�

Mrs. Morrison said nothing for a moment, pausing to take a dainty bite of her quail, before looking at me again. She smiled slowly. �I did not want to tell you what had happened before we arrived,� she said. �I did not want you to think ill of him.�

�What happened?� I asked softly.

�Lady Emily,� Mrs. Morrison said, �You know better than anyone that my husband and I have some�unconventional ways about us. Sexually, I mean. But we had an agreement, you see, same as you and your husband, that we always play together. He broke our agreement. A few months ago, I found out that he was having an affair with a young Indian woman who worked in our kitchen. In our own damn house!� She cried this out loud, and I was grateful that we were in a private room.

�You poor dear,� I said. �I&#8217;m terribly sorry to hear this. And I am surprised at Mr. Morrison&#8217;s behavior. He always seemed so devoted to you.�

�I&#8217;m afraid, my dear, that it changes,� she said sourly. �With men, it changes. It happened with my first husband, and now it has happened to my second.�

I flushed at her words. She gave me a serious look, and shook her head. �I&#8217;m sorry,� she said. �I don&#8217;t want to upset you, my dear.�
�Oh, no,� I said quickly. �I&#8217;m quite fine. But I&#8217;m so, so sorry. What�what has happened, since you learned of the affair?�

�Well, I kicked her out, certainly,� Mrs. Morrison said. �As for him�it&#8217;s not the same now, my dear,� she said sadly. �I have been betrayed by him again.� I remembered then that when they had courted, years and years ago, Mr. Morrison had had an affair with my own mother. Somehow, it seemed that Mrs. Morrison had forgiven my mother�but I had a feeling (and I know it to be true, now!) that she will never forgive her husband.

�You both seem so miserable,� I said softly.

Mrs. Morrison laughed. �Me?� she said. �I am hurt by it, certainly, but I am far from miserable, my dear. I am happy right now, my dear. I&#8217;m very glad to be here with you.�

I forced a smile. �Yes,� I said. �But�I do believe that he is miserable. And�and he asked me not to say this to you, but he told me that he will not play with me anymore.� I looked at her carefully, but tried to make light of it. �No one has ever spurned my advances before, so I must admit that I am quite hurt.�

�Oh, you vain little thing,� Mrs. Morrison teased. She shook her head. �He has earned his misery. He knows what he can do to end it.� She would discuss it no more. 

I was left with a slightly ill feeling in my stomach as we made our way back to the hotel for a nap. Mrs. Morrison invited me to cuddle in her bed with her, but I did not think that my husband would approve of it�and I did not necessarily trust her to show restraint. So I napped alone in my own room, and was awoken a couple of hours later by a pair of familiar lips on my forehead.

My husband sat beside me in bed, his face looming over mine, smiling lovingly. �Worn out already, my Emily?� he teased. �What were you up to today?�

�I just went shopping and had lunch with Mrs. Morrison,� I said innocently, and my husband laughed.

�That is enough to wear someone out,� he said. 

�What time is it, sir?� I asked, sitting up slightly. 

�Not quite four.�

�You are early,� I observed.

�Yes,� my husband said. �I am afraid that our friend Mr. Morrison has deserted us for the evening.�

�What do you mean?� I asked, alarmed as I sat up straight. My husband smiled kindly.

�Don&#8217;t worry, Emily. He&#8217;s merely spending some extra time with some old friends of his,� Mr. Singer explained. �We got wrapped up in drinks and talking, and it was just going on and on. I was finally able to kindly excuse myself.�

�You did not enjoy yourself today?�

Mr. Singer laughed. �You know, my dear, since I&#8217;ve been spending so much time with women lately, I find that I don&#8217;t converse as easily with men. But then, these men have a history together. They were friends of Morrison&#8217;s in his school days, and we just happened to run into them at a pub.�

�Amazing,� I said. Remembering my conversation with him that morning, and my discussion with his wife over lunch, I suddenly thought it was better that he leave us alone�for now. �Well,� I said, �it&#8217;s good that he&#8217;s seeing old friends. Since he&#8217;s been away for so long, you know�� 

My husband said nothing for a moment. �Yes,� he finally agreed, his voice sounding almost hollow. He cleared his throat. �Emily,� he said, �Something is troubling you, my dear.�

I nodded. �You&#8217;re right, sir.�

�Then you must tell me what it is right away, my dear,� he said gently. �Let your friend make you feel better.�

I considered lying to my husband. I considered telling him that I merely missed the children, and that I couldn&#8217;t wait to be home with them the following afternoon. It was true enough, though not the source of my anguish. But I do not lie to my husband. There is still a part of me that wishes I had, in order to avoid the following discussion.

�Sir,� I said, �Did you know that Mr. Morrison was having an affair some months back?�

Mr. Singer looked puzzled for a moment. He frowned. �Of course not,� he said. �Such matters are none of my concern. Nor should they be yours.�

�But, sir!� I gasped. �They are our friends. Does it not make you sad at heart to hear this?�

�Emily,� my husband snapped, �Didn&#8217;t I advise you not to involve yourself in their personal matters?�

My heart sank. The aching in my stomach kicked in again. �But, sir��

�No, Emily,� he said firmly. He grabbed me by the shoulders and peered down at me, and even in the dark I could see that he was quite angry. �Listen to me, my dear. I do not wish to speak harshly to you, so understand this now. You will not involve yourself in the Morrisons&#8217; affairs. If you do so, your sexual involvement with your dear &#8216;Mother&#8217; will cease. Tell me that you understand me.�

Though he spoke quietly, his tone was fierce, his eyes ablaze. Never had I seen him so angry. I trembled in his grasp, shrinking from him. He tightened his grip on me and shook me slightly. �Emily!� he snapped. �Do you understand me?�

�Yes, sir!� I cried, and I was so frightened, I began to cry. My husband reached for me, his face softening, but I dodged him and hurried into the bathroom, locking myself inside. I sat on the edge of the tub, and listened silently as my husband spoke to me through the door. 

�You may pout for a short while, my dear,� he said, his tone much lighter, though not quite mocking. �But please, my love, do not forget that I do know what is best for you. I only look out for your best interests.�

�I know, sir,� I said, just loud enough for him to hear. I was ashamed of my tears. I was tempted to open the door and beg him to forgive me, to forget the whole thing. I wanted to go home. I heard my husband leave the door and bedroom, probably to sit and relax before getting ready for dinner. I filled the tub, hoping that the rushing water would muffle my sobs.

As you might imagine, the rest of our time in London was quite awkward, but I smiled and laughed and pretended that everything was fine. Mr. Morrison never joined us at all that night, and I did not see him until breakfast the following morning. We were eating early, and heading right for the train station to go home. By teatime, I would have my children in my arms again.

At breakfast, Mrs. Morrison spoke on about how excited she was to see the children. I felt an old ache for her renewed that day, remembering how she had never been able to have her own. She had confided in me that she had suffered multiple miscarriages in her first marriage, some leaving her bed-bound for months on end. �It is a wonder that I&#8217;m the one who survived that marriage,� she had joked. Still, I knew how much she had wanted to be a mother, and now that I know the joy of it, I understand her pain all the more.

On the train, Mrs. Morrison and I sat away from the men. Before parting, my husband had kissed me on the forehead. �Still upset with me, Emily?� he asked softly.

�No, sir,� I answered truthfully. 

�Do not let it worry you any longer, my dear,� he whispered. �Everything is fine. Let&#8217;s just have some fun with our friends this week.�

�Yes, sir,� I said. He kissed me again and we parted, to meet again only when the train pulled up to our stop.

I was disappointed to see that neither of the sisters had come to greet us. Then again, our nicest carriage isn&#8217;t all that big, and five people would be a tight squeeze. I was so anxious to get home and see the children that I hurried my friends straight to where our driver was waiting. �We will come and spend the afternoon in the village tomorrow,� I promised a curious Mrs. Morrison. �I am so looking forward to having you both see our home.�

As we rode the short distance to Wainwright Hall, I noticed that Mr. Morrison was looking a little pale again. �Feeling all right, Mr. Morrison?� I asked, trying to keep my tone light.

Mr. Morrison forced a smile (it certainly looked forced). �Only a little tired, my lady,� he said. 

�Yes,� his wife cut in. �Mr. Morrison did not return to our room until five o&#8217;clock this morning.� Her voice was dripping in distain.

�I was visiting with old friends, my dear Mrs. Morrison,� her husband protested. �You know that I would not, and could not, do anything more than that.� Husband and wife exchanged a heated glance then. My husband squeezed my hand slightly, and I worked to change the subject.

�Well, a room will be ready for you on our arrival, and we&#8217;ll all take a late lunch this afternoon,� I said kindly, and Mr. Morrison gave me a genuine smile.

When we arrived at Wainwright Hall, I restrained the urge to jump from the carriage, allowing my husband out before me to hand me down. I was pleased to see the sisters standing with Mina at the door. Mrs. Gainsley held sweet little Peter in her arms.

�Mummy!� Mina cried, rushing to me, and I gathered her up in my arms and held her close.

�Have you been a very good girl, sweetheart?� I asked, setting my daughter down.

�Yes, Mummy,� Mina said. She giggled. �We have a surprise for you! It&#8217;s�� She giggled as Miss Howard rushed forward and took her by the hand.

�No, no, Mina, no telling,� she said gently. My friend and I embraced and I kissed her cheek. After I had greeted Mrs. Gainsley and taken my little boy in my arms, I turned my attention to my friends. 

�I&#8217;m so happy that we&#8217;re all here together!� I declared, and though there was much tension still between the Morrisons, I was very glad at heart. My dear husband and my oldest and dearest friends together at my home. I introduced everyone, and soon after, I led Mr. Morrison to his room upstairs, bringing Peter with me for a feeding before his nap.

�Lady Emily, your children are lovely,� Mr. Morrison said kindly as we walked through the upper hallway.

�Thank you, Mr. Morrison,� I said. �They are wonderful, and they complete my life.�

�Children are a blessing,� Mr. Morrison said. He paused for a moment. �You know, my lady, I had a child once.�

�You did?� I asked, completely surprised.

Mr. Morrison nodded. �It was before I was married. It was with an Indian girl�I am sure by now that my wife has shared my indiscretion with you?�

I swallowed, taken aback by his bluntness. We had reached the door to the guest room, and I showed him inside. �Yes,� I admitted.

�Are you terribly upset with me, my lady?� Mr. Morrison asked desperately. �I did not mean to hurt my wife. I�I do not wish to justify what I did, but I want you to understand that�things had changed with us.�

�Please, Mr. Morrison,� I said quickly, remembering my husband&#8217;s anger the previous afternoon. �I do not judge you. You are my friend.� 

Mr. Morrison sat down heavily on the large bed. �The girl with whom I&#8217;d had the affair�she reminded me so much of the mother of my child, long ago. I&#8217;d met her�the mother, I mean, not the kitchen girl�at a pub. She worked there, serving drinks and food, you know. A flirtatious little thing, and we started seeing each other. I loved her, but I don&#8217;t think I knew it at the time.� Mr. Morrison smiled sadly. �I am quite a fool, my lady.�

I was silent as he continued. �She was gone from the pub one evening. No one would tell me where she had gone. Well, I dug for answers, and eventually located her on the other end of Calcutta. She was showing by then, my lady. She chased me away, and told me to leave her alone, that she would be dealing with it. I�I don&#8217;t know what she meant by that, my lady,� he admitted sadly. �Perhaps she had an abortion, or perhaps she simply�I do not know,� he said. 

I sat beside him on the bed. With one arm, I held my son. The other, I wrapped around the shoulder of the grieving man. �You poor dear,� I said softly.

�Do not hate me, my lady,� Mr. Morrison said, tears in his eyes again. When I had first met him, years ago, he was so good-humored. I never imagined I would see him in such a state.

�I never could,� I said. I blurted, �Please, Mr. Morrison, let me help you and your wife. I adore you both so much. Isn&#8217;t there any way that I can help you both?� I reached for him again, taking my hand and running it slowly from his knee, up his thigh. I felt him trembling�but just as my hand just reached the tip of his cock, he jerked away from me.

�No, my lady,� he said, his voice panicky. �I cannot.�

�Oh, but, Mr. Morrison,� I said. �Do you not remember what fun we had before? And how happy you and your wife were then? Can&#8217;t I help you relive those days? Are we not friends?�

�It is not that I do not desire you,� Mr. Morrison said, standing from the bed and backing away from me. �I mean I cannot.�

�What mean you, sir?�

Mr. Morrison did not speak his response. Instead, he unbuttoned and pulled down his trousers, revealing his cock. His testicles, the large glorious testicles covered in red hair that I had once taken greedily into my mouth, were gone.


18 October, 18&#8212;

I was so upset recounting the shocking scene with Mr. Morrison that I could not write any longer. But now the Morrisons have gone. Their week with us is up, and they are now on their way to visit their old village, where they (and my mother) grew up together. Mrs. Morrison had asked me along, but my husband had refused. In light of recent discoveries, I am glad he did so.

I never confronted Mrs. Morrison about mutilating her husband. Mr. Morrison and I never spoke any more of it. After seeing it, I ran from the room, in a daze as I wandered to the nursery and began feeding Peter. I had barely come back to myself when I laid him down for his nap (my quite little boy drifts to sleep so easily!).

I wondered what I would say. Would I tell Mr. Singer? He had ordered me not to be involved, but this�this was insane. Something surely had to be done. 

But so confused was I, my mind muddled, that I still did not know what to do as I wandered back downstairs. I found the sisters, Mrs. Morrison, and Mr. Singer chatting easily on the back patio, enjoying an unseasonably warm afternoon, while Mina wandered about in the garden.

I joined the party, and everyone greeted me warmly. My �surprise,� which Mina had spoken of, was a cake, which she had proudly baked with her beloved aunties. As we all sat and had cake and tea, I could tell that the ladies were all getting along well, and I was so pleased. Mrs. Gainsley and Miss Howard already knew of my relationship with Mrs. Morrison (Miss Howard had even teased me about going to see my dear old &#8216;Mother&#8217; before we&#8217;d departed for London), so there was no need to introduce the topic. In fact, they were all easily conversing about our sexual exploits.

We soon found ourselves in the privacy of Mr. Singer&#8217;s study, playing heavily together. Mrs. Morrison demonstrated some of her brutality as she whipped me, using one of the riding crops from the stable, in front of my husband and our friends. I was the only one naked as all the others, clothed, stood around me and watched me take my punishment. Technically, I am not a slave to either Miss Howard or Mrs. Gainsley, though Miss Howard does often dominate me in play. Mrs. Gainsley, like myself, is naturally submissive. Still, to have my master, and three mistresses, to torment me that afternoon, certainly took my mind off of my troubles�for a time.

Still, all during the visit, I have been troubled by the mounting tension between the husband and wife. I never did share with Mr. Singer the awful truth�I guess he will have to find out by reading this diary, for I will not speak of it to anyone. I do wonder how Mrs. Morrison could do something so cruel and horrible. I know that she is a woman driven by her passions, but did the poor man really deserve that?

I find, however, that I do not hate her. My goodbye to her this morning was sincerely tearful, and she kissed me softly, neither of us caring that we were in public at the train station. �Goodbye, my dear little pet,� she whispered in my ear. �I will see you quite soon. I love you.�

�I love you, too, &#8216;Mother,&#8217;� I answered with a giggle, and she kissed me again and departed.

I said goodbye to Mr. Morrison. The poor man had spent much time making excuses for his absence during playtime�he was feeling tired, or ill, or he had some paperwork to go over. I wondered, as I watched the sad man shake hands with my husband, what it would be like to never be able to experience the pleasure of sexual intercourse again. I think it would be quite awful. I simply don&#8217;t know how I would live.

My dark mood has been lifted, somewhat, by the news that my husband gave me on the way home. �My darling,� he said, �After Christmas, I think that you and I should take a private little trip somewhere.�

�Truly, sir?� I asked. �Where will we go?�

�I was seeking advice from our dear friends,� Mr. Singer said, �And Mrs. Morrison suggested that we take a trip to Spain. Would you like to go there, my dear? We can leave right after Christmas and make it just in time for the New Year&#8217;s celebrations.�

I laughed and kissed my husband, and he wrapped his arms tightly around my waist, pushing me so that I was lying beneath him on the bench seat. �Shall I take that for a yes, then?� he snarled, and I nodded, biting my lip.

My dear husband fucked me in our carriage (certainly not the first time for that, of course!), making me orgasm twice before we arrived home again (not the first time for that, either!). I am excited about the prospect of taking a romantic trip with my husband. Though it worries me that leave my children for an extended time, particularly my nursing little Peter, I know that they will be in safe hands with the sisters. I realize now that I have not traveled since I became pregnant with Mina. It will be thrilling to be able to see the world again.










Mr. Singer

I had always tried to make Wainwright Hall a safe, comfortable, and happy place for my Emily. That, combined with her presence there, made it so. Any squabbles within the household were quickly squashed, mainly through her patient and caring influence. Such a dear girl�I never did take her presence for granted, and I sorely missed her when she was gone.

I had had misgivings about keeping the Howard sisters in our home for an extended amount of time. I had allowed myself to forget that our past with them was a tumultuous one. But the past came back to haunt me the night that we heard them arguing loudly from our own bedchamber.

Sweet Emily was fat and ripe, pregnant with our son. Oh, God, she turned me on most when she was pregnant, and in the final months of her pregnancy, I only allowed her to play with me. And since I had vowed never to play with the sisters without her, they had been neglected. This bothered me little as I held her close, rubbing her bare, pregnant belly with the palm of my hand as I rubbed my cock, preparing myself for her. She sighed and rubbed herself against me (she never wanted it more than when she was pregnant), and I was so ready to slide into her and fuck her slowly, feeling her soft pussy and her fat thighs against me, when we heard Miss Howard yelling (unintelligibly, to us) from the east wing.

Emily stopped rubbing against me, putting her hand over mine to stay me. We both listened, and heard another cry ring out. Emily gasped. �Oh, sir,� she said, sounding quite distressed. I couldn&#8217;t have that, not in her home, especially while she was in a delicate state. Besides, it would put her out of the mood. I vowed to go and investigate, only after tying her up securely, smiling at her as I left the room. I wrapped myself in my housecoat and stalked through the upper halls, walking right into the suite shared by the sisters, without knocking to announce my presence.

The sisters turned to me in surprise. Mrs. Gainsley sat in a loveseat next to the fireplace. She had clearly been crying. Miss Howard was standing. Before either one could say anything, I scolded them, �My dear young ladies, it is quite late in the evening. Mina is sleeping, as are the servants, and my wife and I are trying to have some quiet time together.�

Miss Howard, wearing her undergarments with her long hair loosened, smirked. �I&#8217;m quite sure.�

Ignoring her jest, I demanded, �What is going on here?�

Mrs. Gainsley spoke up. �I might as well confess to you, Sir Aaron�I know the truth about my husband&#8217;s death.�

I was taken aback. �Do�do you?�

Mrs. Gainsley nodded. I did not know what to say. I looked at Miss Howard, the murderess, for guidance. Surprisingly, she looked rather annoyed. 

�Sir Aaron,� Mrs. Gainsley finally said, �I�I must admit that I understand my sister&#8217;s reasoning behind her actions. Though I certainly do not agree with them�I�well, I will admit that after a time, I was rather�relieved�� She looked away from me for a moment. The poor young lady. 

�Beatrice,� I said softly, �I am sorry��

�I certainly hope you are sorry,� she suddenly burst out. �I feel like quite the fool, Aaron, having been tricked by you all this time. You�and Lady Emily!�

�Oh, Beatrice, please,� I said, but I did not know what to say. 

Miss Howard, the voice of reason, spoke up. �No one meant you any harm by it, Bea.�

�How did you find out?� I asked.

Mrs. Gainsley flushed. �I am ashamed to admit this,� she said, �but I read it in your wife&#8217;s diary.�

I thought of where my wife kept her cherished and (mostly) private diary. On a shelf in her wardrobe�one would have to go looking for it to find it. It was my turn to flush. �How did it come into your possession?� I asked, trying to maintain calm.

�I�found it in the wardrobe��

�How dare you?� I burst. �Who are you to go sneaking through my wife&#8217;s things?�

�Oh, Aaron,� Mrs. Gainsley cried, sobbing again. I am usually moved by the tears of a woman, particularly the delicate Mrs. Gainsley, but that evening, I strode forth, raising my hand. Had I meant to strike her? 

Miss Howard rushed forward and grabbed my arm. �Sir Aaron, she told me that she was retrieving an object that Lady Emily had requested. She did not go in there without permission.�

I lowered my voice, trembling with anger. �But still��

�I meant no harm by it,� Mrs. Gainsley pleaded. �I am sorry, Aaron, do forgive me.� And in an instant, I did. I felt that our crime against her outweighed hers. I took a deep breath to calm myself and sat beside Mrs. Gainsley on the small loveseat.

�Can we come to an agreement?� I asked calmly, taking Mrs. Gainsley gently by the hand. She nodded, and I reached out and tenderly wiped the tears from her face. �Let&#8217;s not fight. We are all friends here. I hope you understand that what Lady Emily and I did, we did because we care for your sister very much.� 

Mrs. Gainsley nodded again and did not speak. �Beatrice,� I said gently, �I hope you are happy here at Wainwright Hall. Are you, my dear?�

�Yes, Aaron,� she said softly. �And I am so grateful to you and Lady Emily, for all you have done for me��

�I know,� I said with a wave of my hand. I had heard about enough of her praise over our &#8216;generosity&#8217; those past two years. �You give us much in return, Beatrice. My wife is particularly fond of you, and having you here adds to her happiness. Which adds to mine. We both care for you.�

�You are my family,� Mrs. Gainsley whispered, and I nodded in agreement. We were a strange family, certainly, but we were happy. Emily was happy, with her &#8216;sisters&#8217; and with me. At least, I truly believed that she was. �Aaron,� she said, �I hold no grudge against you or Lady Emily for what happened with my husband. I hope you will forgive me for invading the lady&#8217;s privacy.�

I gave her a wicked little grin. �Well, Beatrice,� I said, �I think that you will need to be punished for it. Eventually. But for now, I have to ask a favor, of both of you.� I turned to address Miss Howard, who had been standing by, silently regarding us with folded arms. �Do not speak of any of this to Lady Emily. I don&#8217;t want to keep any more secrets among us�but she is in a delicate state right now. Will you ladies do me this favor?�

Both agreed, and we left on generally decent terms. The ladies agreed to stop their fighting (though I am sure that they continued to bicker, much more quietly, throughout the night), and I bade them goodnight. As I said goodnight to Mrs. Gainsley, I gently touched her face as she stood to see me out.

�May I kiss you, Beatrice?� I asked quietly. She nodded, smiling for the first time that evening, and I kissed her softly. I gave a much filthier kiss to her sister, whispering in her ear, �Look at all the trouble you&#8217;ve caused, Tatiana.� I grabbed her tight ass briefly. �When Lady Emily feels up for it, I&#8217;ll have to teach you a lesson.�

�Oh, sure,� Miss Howard said facetiously, �I am always the one to blame. It has been like that all of my life, has it not, Bea?� To this, her sister had not response. I took that as my cue to depart.

I kept that conversation a secret from my wife. I would sometimes think of it, and promise myself, yet again, that I would tell her everything�another time. I always had an excuse. The drama with the Morrisons was enough of an excuse for a while; that entire visit had been a mistake, as it had only left my wife more troubled than I had ever seen her.

It was only after she was gone that I thought about that week with the Morrisons again. I had gotten so angry with Emily for caring so much about their marital woes. It wasn&#8217;t until after Emily was gone, and I&#8217;d read through her diary again (something I had not done in years, though she did not know this) that I realized the full extent of the situation. It all made sense then.

For the first few months, I went over that first (and only) day together in Spain, over and over again, trying to find answers. Emily disappeared on New Years Eve in Barcelona. She didn&#8217;t leave a note, nothing. She took nothing with her but the clothing she&#8217;d been wearing that night. There was no sign of a struggle. She was simply�gone. 

On our arrival in Barcelona that morning, Emily had smiled brightly as we&#8217;d left the ship. She looked happier than she had in months, since the Morrisons had left us. She had been her smiling, cheerful self since their departure, but I could tell that she was left troubled by their visit. Worse, she would not discuss it with me. I could not blame her, after I had snapped at her in London, and I hoped to restore her feelings toward me on this trip.

I did not allow myself to admit it, but I was jealous of Mrs. Morrison. I knew how much my wife adored her, but it wasn&#8217;t just that. My wife gave love to many people, the &#8216;sisters,&#8217; and our children, and all of her friends, and I never felt that she loved me any less for loving them as well. No; I knew that Mrs. Morrison fulfilled a need in Emily, a need that, try as I might, I could never satisfy for her on my own. I try to tell myself that I did not begrudge Emily for having these needs (for who I am, a man of such depraved needs myself, to judge the needs of anyone else, particularly my dear, lovely wife?), but I believe that I did. And even if I didn&#8217;t realize it, she knew. 

But she was genuinely happy that morning in Barcelona. I know her well enough to tell. She held my hand tightly as I led her from the ship. She was eager to have the chance to try out her Spanish, a language she had been trying to learn on her own (along with Hindi, having already conquered German and French). She spoke earnestly with the carriage driver, who smiled at her and spoke slowly to accommodate her, before revealing that he was proficient in English. 

Our rented chateau stood on a cliff overlooking the sea. Emily was dazzled by the view, standing in the sunny garden and looking out onto the sparkling waters. I would stand in the same spot only hours later, and wonder if Emily&#8217;s body were floating around in the beautiful, dark sea. But that morning, no such thoughts crossed my mind as I embraced my dear wife in that seaside garden, leading her to a sunny patch of grass, hidden from the house by a row of neatly trimmed bushes.

We sat on the grass, and I loosed Emily&#8217;s hair, letting it fall, so long and dark, down her back and arms. She sat still as I gently touched her face and ran my hands through her soft hair. �Are you glad we are here, Emily?� I asked.

�Oh, yes, sir,� she said, her voice trembling with excitement. �Thank you for bringing me here.�

�You&#8217;re welcome, my love,� I said, kissing her softly, briefly. �I only want you to be happy.�

�I am, sir,� she said, and she smiled, and I almost believed her. Well, if she were not completely happy, I would change that. I knew how to take care of my Emily. That&#8217;s why she belonged to me. If anything, I was confident in that fact. It was all shattered after that night, but even in the garden that morning, as I slowly seduced my wife, I still believed it. I believe she did as well.

I fucked her gently in that garden, holding down her wrists and nibbling on her neck as I slowly thrust into her. She kept the rhythm as she rocked her hips slowly, raising her legs to allow me to plunge deep inside of her. I gave in to the temptation to tear away her traveling gown, revealing her glorious (and sore, quite sore) tits. I&#8217;d been neglecting them, waiting for her to beg me to suckle, as she did that morning as I began squeezing them.

�Oh, please, sir, drink of me,� she gasped. �I have so much milk for you, sir.�

I would not have relished it if I&#8217;d known that my son would never suckle from his mother&#8217;s tit again. But I drank of her greedily, nibbling on her nipples, not very roughly, but enough to make her gasp and wriggle beneath me. And all that time, I did not cease in my thrusting, and I filled her with my milk as I enjoyed hers.

That would be the last time, before her disappearance, that I would ever make love to my wife alone. We left the garden (Emily, blushing as she pulled on her undergarments and held the tattered remains of her gown to her chest), and began to make our plans for the day, as though disaster were not about to strike. Emily had plans to meet with Se�ora Vivian Santos, the hostess of the lavish party that we would attend that evening to celebrate the New Year. Sra. Santos was an Englishwoman, and the niece of our neighbor Mr. Steepleton. Apparently, I had met Sra. Santos (then Miss Steepleton) some years ago at a party held by her uncle and aunt, but I did not remember her. Emily kept some light correspondence with her over the years (in fact, after my wife&#8217;s disappearance, I marveled at the number of people with whom she&#8217;d been in contact), and when she&#8217;d written of our plans to come to Barcelona for the New Year, Sra. Santos had not hesitated in extending an invitation to her party. 

Sra. Santos and Emily would be meeting for lunch, so I gave my wife the use of the rented carriage and decided to spend the afternoon relaxing. Had I known it would be our final day together, I would have wanted to spend those hours with her right by my side. Hell, had I any idea of what was to happen, I would never have allowed my wife to leave my side again.

Unsurprisingly, my wife came back from her luncheon with a new gown for that evening. It was red silk, embroidered all over with an intricate design. It was a close-fitting gown, with black lace at the bottom and a short black lace train in the back. It bared her shoulders, and when she modeled it for me with her favorite corset, I was pleased to see more than a hint of her soft, white cleavage. I plunged my head into her chest and kissed her, making her gasp. �Oh, sir, please don&#8217;t leave any marks on me, they will show��

And so, I left a small love-bite on her chest, just low enough to tell if one were looking carefully. But we did not play again that afternoon. Emily hung up her gown, and we had a short siesta. I ran my hands over her soft stomach, not as toned as it used to be (to my delight), though my Emily was still quite lean. Her tits, though�her tits were just perfect, sagging heavily with milk, her nipples hard and red constantly, the white skin silky soft to the touch. So deliciously swollen, and begging to be squeezed and teased and tormented. But I did nothing more than rub her tits softly that afternoon, and we did fall asleep for a short time.

We arrived at the Santos estate around eleven o&#8217;clock (the times would become significant to me as I frantically recalled the events of the night), and were greeted by Sra. Santos herself, and her husband Se�or Andres Santos, a wealthy businessman who invested in trading companies and ships. Sra. Santos was not a remarkable-looking woman. I knew that, like her uncle our neighbor, she had inherited a sizable fortune, enough to attract the still-young and quite handsome Sr. Santos.

Sr. Santos, a short, lean, and swarthy gentleman, had a thin mustache. I could see that my wife found him interesting, if not attractive, and they flirted mildly, of course. I made small talk with Sra Santos, but she was very distracted by the goings-on of her fiesta, and very quickly dismissed herself to greet other guests. She seemed rather stiff, and I wondered briefly if Emily and I might find a way to spend some time with Sr. Santos alone�

After greeting the host and hostess, we mingled for a time among the wealthiest people in Barcelona. Emily timidly tried out her Spanish, and she charmed everyone she met, of course. She has always been this way, even before she came under my care. I wondered if she did not come by her charming ways honestly (as I felt certain she came by her whorish ways, inheriting them from her mother), or if it were not somehow taught and practiced in her early years. Dear, sweet Emily never seemed to feel awkward or intimidated around anyone. I never did ask her how she did it. Of course, I had taught her to be polite and kindly to everyone, but her charm and sweetness�that was all her.

None of the other guests caught our interest quite so much as Sr. Santos himself. I questioned my wife teasingly. �Would you like to become better acquainted with our host?� After her disappearance, I felt terrible guilt over the need I&#8217;d had to whore her out. My own wife�the child whom I had raised by my own hand. Why had it pleased me so to see her with others? To see others rule over her, coaxing her to fulfill their lewd fantasies? But I reminded myself that she enjoyed the attention. She did it to please me, but she enjoyed it herself, and I thought nothing of it if all were getting pleasure out of it. But after she was gone, I swore to myself that if I ever got her back, she would be mine alone for the rest of our lives. I sorely regretted permitting her promiscuity, and unknowingly placing her in harm&#8217;s way.

Near midnight, my wife and I had made our way into the back yard, essentially a patio and small garden overlooking the sea. The view was dizzying, the estate being located on a seaside cliff even higher than the one on which our chateau was situated. Emily gasped and looked out over the dark sea. Far below, lights from boats along the coast were visible.

At that moment, Sr. Santos came upon us. �Your wife appreciates the view,� he observed, his English heavily accented. I nodded.

Emily turned and smiled at our host. �It is amazing,� she declared. �You and Sra. Santos are quite fortunate to wake up to it each day.�

�It is even lovelier in the evening, when the sun is setting,� Sr. Santos said, gesturing out toward the dark horizon. �You will want to stay right here until midnight. This is a good spot to see the fireworks over the sea.�

�Goodness!� Emily cried, unable to hide her excitement. Sr. Santos went to get drinks for us, and I put my arm around her. She giggled and I hugged her briefly.

�You are attracted to him,� I accused her kindly. �You&#8217;d like him to have you tonight, wouldn&#8217;t you, my sweet little whore?�

But Emily lifted her head from my chest. �Oh, but sir,� she said, �He is married. I don&#8217;t think I could play with him without his wife present�or at least without her permission.�

I frowned at her. �Do you see that happening?�

�No, sir.�

I sighed and planted a discreet kiss on her forehead. �Well, my love, I guess I will have to try to change that.� When Sr. Santos joined us again, I said, �Se�or, where is your wife? I would like our old friend to join us for a toast.�

Sr. Santos unenthusiastically waved his hand toward the house, and I took my drink and went in to retrieve her, throwing a wink at my wife as I left her with our host. I found Sra. Santos with a couple of other ladies (both older than she), and she smiled at me as I joined them, taking another champagne from a servant before coming to her side.

�Your home is lovely, Se�ora,� I said kindly, turning on my own (and certainly practiced) charm. We flirted lightly for a minute, before I said, �Lady Emily and I have procured a wonderful spot to observe the fireworks. It is very close to midnight. Why don&#8217;t you join us?�

And she came along, and the four of us stood together. All were silent when the midnight church bells tolled, and on the final strike, loud cheering rang up, and all toasted and drank of their champagne. I grabbed my wife and kissed her deeply as the first fireworks went off above the seashore. Emily was dazzled by it, the whole display left her as giddy as a young girl, and I was thrilled to see her so carefree and happy once again.

After the impressive fireworks show, the band began playing again, and many of the guests began dancing. We joined in, and I found myself dancing with the hostess, while my wife worked her charms on the host. After a time, the four of us found ourselves in the study as the Santos gave us a &#8216;tour&#8217; of their seaside estate.

The study had large windows overlooking the garden and the sea. Down below, we could see the other guests dancing and mingling. Sr. Santos poured us another round of drinks. And, well�it was not long before we were getting down to it. After a time (I will confess, after a few drinks I do not remember how we got to that point), Emily stood and stripped, revealing her red undergarments beneath her gown. I looked at Sra. Santos especially for a reaction, and it seemed that she was even more excited than her husband.

�Gentlemen,� Emily said suddenly, �We ladies must confess that there is a conspiracy afoot.� I was puzzled (and thrilled) as Emily giggled and Sra. Santos (suddenly much more attractive to me) stood and stripped down to her corset (also a deep shade of red). I glanced over at Sr. Santos, who looked shocked but not displeased as he took a trembling sip of his drink.

�Explain yourself, my ladies,� I said calmly.

�Well, sir,� Emily confessed, �Sra. Santos is no stranger to our good friend, Alfonso Beaumont.�

�Oh,� I said. �It is a small world, isn&#8217;t it?�

�Who is this Alfonso Beaumont?� Sr. Santos demanded, though he did not seem entirely upset by this information. 

�You remember Alfonso, darling,� Sra. Santos said. �My uncle&#8217;s driver, the strong African man.�

Sr. Santos nodded in remembrance, smiling slowly. I glanced at my wife, and she smiled knowingly. The truth was revealed, then. Sr. Santos enjoyed the company of men. And the ladies intended for me to use him for my own pleasure. Realizing this, I stood and went to Emily as Sra. Santos straddled her own husband. I put my hands on Emily&#8217;s tiny waist (such a small girl!) and pulled her to me, scowling in her giggling face. �Naughty whore,� I scolded. �It pleases you to see me with men?� The only man that I&#8217;d ever played with (in Emily&#8217;s presence) was my father&#8217;s old friend Colonel Faulkner. 

Emily shrugged. �It is a fantasy that Sra. Santos and I have built up for some months now�I admit it would excite me to see it come to fruition, if it pleases you, sir.�

Well! It certainly did please me. It is obvious that I much prefer the company of women (particularly soft, nubile women), but I did not hesitate to join in with the ladies&#8217; little game that night. My wife really asked so little of me, and to fulfill her desires would have been enough of a motivation alone. And looking back, I do not regret making my wife happy on our last night together. 

As I straddled a naked Sr. Santos (who lay on his belly on the floor of his study), guiding my stiff cock to the opening of his asshole (I do remember that he had a small, tight little ass), I grabbed his hair and pulled his head back. I kissed him once, only once. I do not like kissing men, but I shoved my tongue down his throat and felt his thin mustache against my upper lip. I heard my wife giggling uncontrollably, and I knew that she loved this. She would have been stroking herself if I had not ordered her to sit still and enjoy the show. She would be needed to thank our host and hostess for their generosity. 

I pumped into Sr. Santos roughly, pulling his head back and allowing him to grunt aloud with each deep, swift stroke. His ass was tight, tighter than my Emily&#8217;s, but he&#8217;d clearly been taken there before (by our own friend, no less�truly a small world). Sra. Santos joined us, wearing only her red corset top, her pussy (with a scarce tangle of hair as red as the wild hair that now fell past her pale shoulders) exposed. She lowered it onto her husband&#8217;s face, forcing him to lick and please her as I fucked him roughly. I looked over at my wife, saw her glowing, smiling face. Yes, she was quite pleased. I gave her a wicked smile, winking as Sra. Santos moaned loudly. 

I held out until I sensed that our hostess was coming, before I allowed myself to release into Sr. Santos&#8217;s ass. I climbed off of the small man swiftly and went to my wife, and she stood, allowing me to sweep her into my arms. I kissed her deeply, and whispered in her ear, �You enjoyed that, my lady? Are you ready for your turn, whore?�

�Oh, yes, sir,� she sighed, and I set her down. Sr. Santos, standing uneasily with the help of his smiling wife, came to us. I nodded.

�You may do anything that you like to this lady,� I said. �Her cunt is off-limits, but her ass and mouth are very accommodating.�

Sra. Santos, spent, poured herself another drink and sat by to watch as her husband pumped his stubby cock down my wife&#8217;s throat. Taking the drink that the hostess offered, I stood by and watched with approval, my cock in one hand and my drink in the other, and when my drink was finished and my cock was sufficiently hard, I set my glass down and positioned myself behind my wife. She was knelt on the floor, on her knees (such a natural position for her), expertly sucking our host&#8217;s member. She probably noticed me approach, but she still cried out in surprise as I swiftly stood behind her and entered her cunt smoothly. 

Having fucked our host quite roughly, and wanting to allow Emily to focus on her other task, I fucked my wife slowly, though I still came very quickly after Sr. Santos. After Emily had finished cleaning our host&#8217;s cock, I wrapped my arms around her neck and hold her tightly, whispering in her ear. �What think you, whore? Has this been a fun party?�

�Oh, yes, sir,� she murmured, and I squeezed her once more, before we stood and joined our host and hostess for one more drink. They did not seem to be in any hurry to return to their own party. Indeed, when we had all straightened ourselves out and joined the party a short time later, it seemed that no one had noticed our absence.

After midnight, more guests arrived. As my wife and I danced, we met more interesting people, some who even flirted openly with us. Having lost our host and hostess in the crowd, I could only wonder if our sort of activities were normal amongst their social circle. I smiled to imagine such a scenario among the neighbors of Wainwright Hall. We had formed our own little social circle, certainly, but on the whole, our friends and neighbors were quite conservative.

We had intended to remain at the party until dawn, as was tradition in Spain on New Year&#8217;s. Our host and hostess would be serving a large breakfast, and I was excited by the prospect of having more &#8216;playtime&#8217; before going back to our chateau. But not long after the clock struck three, I noticed that Emily&#8217;s countenance had taken on a pale shade. Poor dear, she was exhausted but smiling as I pulled her aside.

�My darling,� I said, �You are in need of rest. Shall we go back to our chateau together and retire for the evening?�

�I am quite tired,� Emily confessed. �But sir, I do not wish to drag you away. You&#8217;re not at all tired, and you&#8217;re having a wonderful time, aren&#8217;t you?�

It was true. I had not had such fun in a long time. All of the dancing, and the luscious Spanish women in their bright dresses, and the flowing drinks. I was quite drunk by&nbsp; then�I would later curse my drunkenness. What sort of old man such as I would indulge in this way, when I had such a precious girl in my care? But I thought nothing of it; I agreed to stay until after the breakfast had been served, with the goal of perhaps bringing a pretty se�orita home to play with my rested wife.

I walked my wife to our rented carriage, would stood by on the street crowded with like carriages. Our driver hastened over from where he&#8217;d been huddled with a group of drivers, who were having their own sort of party as they waited on their employers. I only allowed Emily to ride in the carriage alone with him after determining that he was most sober.

I kissed my wife goodbye. �Rest up, my love,� I ordered gently. �I feel that I will want to play when I come to you.�

�Goodnight, sir,� my wife giggled, and I watched the carriage drive away. I did not feel at all troubled as I went back into the party. I was a clueless fool, completely unaware that my wife would not be waiting for me upon my return.

I left after breakfast, as planned, and though no ladies (or gentlemen) accompanied me, I was expecting more than a couple of ladies to call on us quite soon. The driver took me home, and I was finally overcome with fatigue from our travels and the long, exciting night. I longed only to climb into bed with my wife, my dearest, and wrap my arms around her warm little body, and fall asleep for the remainder for the morning.

I would not know her warming comfort. I entered the chateau and went immediately to the master bedchamber. I was surprised, but not yet troubled, to not see Emily in the bed (though I would note, after finding that she was not in the chateau at all, that the bed was still made from after our nap that afternoon). She was not in the bathroom, nor in the kitchen getting breakfast. Only then, as I glanced out into the dewy garden, did I begin calling for her.

She was gone. I searched the entire chateau (I cursed how large it was as I became frantic). No note had been left. I went out to the carriage house and found the driver, who was still putting the horses away, and questioned him. He claimed that he had brought Emily back, as arranged, and had seen her into the chateau himself. He had noticed nothing strange, and on Emily&#8217;s insistence he had returned to the party to wait on me.

I was tempted to thrash the man, but I felt that he was truthful, and I left him alone. I searched the streets and the beach below the chateau and the cliff briefly, but I panicked that Emily might return to the chateau and find me out and leave again. As midmorning drew and the sun shown brightly, I returned to the chateau and searched it again, my heart sinking as I finally sat heavily on the (still perfectly made) bed. Emily was gone.


When Emily did not return by afternoon, I went to the police and put in a report. There was an investigation, and I myself spent tireless days and nights searching the streets of Barcelona, armed with a recently drawn picture of Emily, taking it from my pocket and showing it to strangers, questioning them desperately in the broken Spanish that I had picked up. No one had seen her.

The police questioned the people who had attended the Santos&#8217;s New Years fiesta, but could find nothing to lead them to believe that anyone would have been involved in Emily&#8217;s disappearance. When they dropped the investigation after a month, I was despondent.

I had written home and explained the events to the sisters. I had promised not to return until I had Emily safely in my care. But one evening, I sat alone, wondering what I might do. What had happened to Emily? Had she run away from me? Been kidnapped? Had she been murdered, her body still unfound as it floated in the sea? I was beginning to think that I should head back to England, and find a private investigator in London to take the case. I was completely lost�it had been six weeks. Was it too late?

There was a knocking at the door. I imagined that it was the police, with the news that Emily&#8217;s body had been found�or that it was Emily herself, locked out and only longing to be with me again. I hurried to the door, desperate hope filling my heart, and flung it open to see a sight that first disappointed, then elated me.

At the door, a calm but concerned look on her face, was my dear friend Mrs. Gainsley. �Sir Aaron!� she declared lovingly. �Oh, my poor sir.� I allowed her to wrap her arms around me and hug me close, not too tightly, but comfortingly. For the first time, I cried, and she led me into the chateau, closing the door behind us as I clung to her.

Struggling to regain some composure, I stammered, �Beatrice, my dear�how��

She smiled kindly, taking my hand and leading me to the table in the small breakfast nook. �We had not heard from you again,� she said softly. �Your daughter is most worried.�

Poor child. I remembered the anxiety that Emily used to suffer from in my absence. I recalled this to Mrs. Gainsley then, explaining how Emily had becoming my traveling companion at a young age. I had previously taken an excursion to South Africa. The dear girl was seven at that time, an intelligent but delicate little thing. I had thought nothing of leaving her in the care of her beloved Nanny, though I had not left her alone since the death of her father.

When I returned to Wainwright Hall some three months later, I noticed a change in my dear girl. Certainly she was smiling and cheerful, quite happy to have me home again. But she looked pale, her pretty little cheeks shrunken and colorless. In private, her Nanny revealed that while I was away, the poor girl had hardly eaten and had fallen into a state of unnatural melancholy. She had not been sleeping properly. Some of her hair had even started to fall out. Dr. Yates had declared it a slight nervous condition, odd for a child so small, but perhaps not for one who had already lost so much. 

Poor Emily! I swore never to leave her alone again�but how could I, a young single gentleman, remain bound to our rural home forever? 

I found a solution, one that might be thought unorthodox by some, a few months later. After our German lesson (a language that the girl was picking up almost as quickly as she had French) one afternoon, Emily and I had tea in my study. �Emily,� I said suddenly, �I have been invited to join a friend of mine at a law university in Germany for a month-long guest lectureship.�

Emily, who had been smiling cheerfully only a moment before, frowned. �You&#8217;re going away, sir?� she asked quietly.

�I am,� I said. �I almost turned down the offer, though.�

�Why, sir?�

�Because I don&#8217;t want to distress you again.� Emily and I had never spoken of her illness during my previous extended absence. She blushed deeply as I went on. �I am most impressed with how quickly you&#8217;ve learned the language, my dear. I&#8217;m quite pleased. I was hoping this would be so, so that you might accompany me on my trip.�

�Go with you, sir?� She looked very puzzled. She&#8217;d never gone further than London in all of her young life. 

�You&#8217;d like to, wouldn&#8217;t you?� I asked.

�Oh, yes, sir!� she declared, her grey eyes shining happily at the news. �I would love to go with you. Oh, thank you, sir!�

I smiled gently. �Now, Emily, your Nanny will not be able to come with us on this trip. It is quite a long way to travel, and we must think of her health. So I am trusting that, on this trip, you will be on your very best behavior at all times. Do you understand, my child?�

�Yes, sir,� she said, smiling still more brightly. The warning was unnecessary. We had a very pleasant time during our month in Berlin staying on the university campus, and during our fortnight-long trip to Brussels to visit with another old friend of mine. For the first time during that trip, I noticed what a charming effect Emily had on people. I had taken it for granted; I had loved my goddaughter all of her life, and the fact that all of our neighbors and friends loved her as well I had attributed to the love that they&#8217;d had for her late parents. But seeing her charm complete strangers, and not blush and turn away shyly, filled me with pride. My old friends and their acquaintances thought Emily a most precocious and lovely child.

As I recalled this story to Mrs. Gainsley, she nodded kindly and listened quietly. She only spoke when I had fallen into a melancholy silence again. �Sir Aaron,� she said, producing an envelope from her coat, �This letter came to you last week at home. It is in Lady Emily&#8217;s hand. I left right away to bring it to you in person.�

My hands trembling, I took the offered envelope. She was right; the handwriting was clearly Emily&#8217;s own script. I nearly cried with relief. She was alive! There was no return address on the envelope, but she was most certainly alive! I carefully but hastily tore the letter open and read quickly.


22 January, 18&#8212;

My dearest sir,

I apologize most sincerely for my hasty departure. My companion has allowed me to write a brief letter of explanation. I hope that this letter will quell some of your fears, and will keep the hope alive that I will return to you. I will come home, as soon as I am able.

My companion will be reading this letter, so I do not want to risk saying too much. Please, for the sake of yourself and for everyone at home, do not try to find me. My companion holds me under blackmail, and the information would be most damaging to someone at home�and to you, and to myself as well. I hope that will be sufficient explanation for why I was forced to leave.

I can give you no details. I cannot divulge the name of my companion (though this person believes that you already know), nor can I tell you where we are heading. I can tell you that I am safe. My companion means me no harm, I am sure, and assures me that while I am cooperative, no harm will befall me, nor anyone at home. I am warned, however, that there is a coconspirator closely connected to Wainwright Hall, whose identity I do not know and cannot think of. On the word of my companion, this person will strike and do harm�I am most afraid for the safety of the children, so do keep them close in your loving care.

I am going very far away, sir. My heart weeps. I wish to find a way to slip away, but I know that in doing so, I put myself and others in grave danger. I will assure you that I will do nothing rash. No matter how far away I go, and no matter what happens, I will forever be devoted to you. You alone are the master of my heart. 

Sincerely,

Your Emily


I frantically read the letter over the first time, then more slowly the second, taking in each detail with confusion. Her �companion� (or rather, her captor) believed that I was aware of his identity. I shook my head�I could scarcely think of who it might be.

�My sister asked me to give this to you as well,� Mrs. Gainsley said suddenly, holding out a yellowed newspaper clipping. The story, dating around the same time as the letter, described how the body of an Englishman had washed upon an African shore, the man&#8217;s throat slash and his testicles mutilated. He had been identified as Mr. Charles Morrison. His wife Lydia was presumed dead, or perhaps captured by vicious pirates or natives, but I knew the truth. Clever Miss Howard had seen it as well.

So! Mrs. Morrison had killed her husband (presumably on their way back to Calcutta), and had blackmailed my wife into going away with her. With what information? Of course, Emily had been referring to the murder of Mr. Gainsley, and of our involvement in the cover-up for the true murderess, our friend who resided under our own roof. But how had Mrs. Morrison gained this knowledge? Who had entrusted her with it? As far as I could tell, only four of us were involved: my dear Emily, myself, and our friends the Howard sisters. 

But for the time being, I was not so concerned with that particular piece of information. Mrs. Morrison had a coconspirator�someone close to Wainwright Hall, Emily had written. Who would plot against her, against our family and our loved ones? I racked my brain, but I had no enemies. Certainly gentle Emily, loved by all, had none. 

I allowed myself to weep, so confused and frightened was I by all that I had learned. Mrs. Gainsley, the dear woman, again comforted me. �What am I to do, Beatrice?� I asked desperately.

�Come home,� she answered gently. �Your children need you. Do not suffer alone; allow me to shoulder some of your burden.�

Such a dear friend she was! She offered me such comfort that night in the dark chateau. For the first time since our relationship began, she offered no resistance to my advances as I kissed her slowly. As I peeled away her traveling gown, I briefly realized that she would be the first woman that I&#8217;d been with, without Emily present, since I had raped and enslaved my beloved years before. Nearly six years�it felt like a lifetime. 

But though I felt some guilt, I fucked Mrs. Gainsley on the couch in the sitting room of the Spanish chateau. Her warm, soft body offered the comfort that I needed so badly. I straddled her and thrust into her slowly, enjoying her softness around me before pulling out and thrusting in again. Dear, sweet Mrs. Gainsley! I fucked her solemnly, without the playfulness that usually accompanied my lovemaking to Emily. Mrs. Gainsley could more than fulfill my needs, but not my deepest desires.

She was, however, quite accommodating that night. After filling her on the couch (and noting that she had not reached an orgasm herself), I offered her dinner. After we ate (or rather, she ate while I picked at my food), I showed her upstairs to the master bedchamber. The bed was unmade; I had discontinued the housekeeping services that came with the rented chateau, and had been doing a haphazard job of maintaining the place myself. Mrs. Gainsley and I agreed that we would stay until we could procure travel back to England, but would do so as quickly as possible.

She stayed with me in that master bedchamber, allowing me to bend her over the foot of the bed and fuck her in her ass. It wasn&#8217;t the first time I&#8217;d enjoyed Mrs. Gainsley&#8217;s fat fleshy ass, but it was the first time that she allowed me to spank her lightly. Mrs. Gainsley was not one for discipline, and she never would be. I felt that forcing her to take on Emily&#8217;s role as my pain slut would not only be disrespectful to my wife, but unfair to Mrs. Gainsley. While she was my lover, we maintained our previous guidelines of equality, each getting our share. But like Emily, Mrs. Gainlsey was so willing to give�not even really caring if she got her pleasure, just enjoying the giving itself. 

After a couple of days (and tireless nights of fucking) in Barcelona, we secured passage on a ship headed for London, which would depart the following morning. It pained me to leave Barcelona�a part of me still believed that in doing so, I would be leaving my Emily behind. But I remembered her letter (which I clutched on to through the duration of her absence), and how she had written that she would be going �far away.�

As Mrs. Gainsley and I boarded the ship that cold morning, I wondered where Emily was. Had Mrs. Morrison taken her back to India? Certainly not to her home in Calcutta�her servants there, having noted their employers&#8217; prolonged absence, had been the ones to report them missing in the first place. Had she dragged my love to Asia? Africa? America? My poor Emily could be in any part of the world, I knew, and with the threat of imprisonment or death hanging over our heads, there was nothing we could do about it. At least, not for the time being.

On our arrival back to Wainwright Hall, I was determined to maintain a cheerful continence for the sake of the children. Poor little Peter, who would continue to get his nourishment from a mixture rather than from his own mother, was too young to note his mother&#8217;s absence consciously, but as he grew older it would have a more profound effect on him.

Mina questioned me right away, after greeting me with a kiss. �Where is Mummy?� she asked, innocent to the truth. 

Forcing back tears, I gave her a smile. �Mummy went to go visit with some old friends.�

�When will she come home?� Mina asked, looking as frightened and confused as I remembered her mother being at that age, after being orphaned. I pulled my daughter to me in a tight hug, holding her close, not daring to let go. 

�I don&#8217;t know, Mina,� I said truthfully. �But don&#8217;t worry. Mummy wrote a letter and said she&#8217;s having a lot of fun. She&#8217;ll be home soon.�

My innocent daughter accepted my lie, and when the children had been laid down to sleep, I sat alone with the sisters in my study and discussed the situation. �Ladies,� I said, �As you are my dearest friends, I am asking for your help. I�I cannot care for the children on my own.�

The sisters exchanged a glance. �Sir Aaron,� Mrs. Gainsley said kindly, �We have no intention of leaving you in your time of need.�

Miss Howard nodded in agreement. �Wainwright Hall is our home, Aaron. You cannot easily be rid of us.� She smiled in jest, and though I was in no mood to joke, I returned her smile.

�I hope you ladies understand how much I care for you,� I said, my head bowed almost shamefully. �While you are here, all of your needs will be met, I promise you this. And if you are so willing, I would like to continue our relationship as�as we had before.� Even as I said these words, I was shamed that I would continue seeing these two ladies out of wedlock�because without Emily around, it felt wrong. But would she begrudge me my needs? I certainly did not think it so. But this did not stop me from experiencing the guilt.

The nature of my relationship with the ladies changed a little. We did not all play together; I was either with one sister, or the other. I favored Miss Howard for afternoon fallacio and quick, ferocious fucks throughout the house. With Mrs. Gainsley, I was much more sensual. With both women, I continued to use restraints occasionally, as it excited Miss Howard and frightened Mrs. Gainsley, both emotions leading to more intense sex. 

For several years, I kept my previous promise to not bring anyone into my bedchamber but my own wife. Allowing Mrs. Gainsley to join me there was a lapse of judgment, a weakness, and from there it seemed that there was no turning back. Still, even in the darkest of times, when I would think of my Emily and worry and miss her with a longing that ached, I held on to the hope that my Emily would return to me, would return to her home. It was that hope that kept me going, and that motivated me to continue making Wainwright Hall a happy and safe place, for the sake of the children. But my smiles were forced, and there were very few moments in Emily&#8217;s absence that I felt any real kind of joy, for even my sexual games with the sisters did not fulfill me. No�I knew, from the beginning, that nothing would make me truly happy until I had my Emily in my arms once again.












 




















Lady Emily&#8217;s Letters

22 January, 18&#8212;

My dearest sir,

As I have written the other letter, the one &#8216;Mother&#8217; has approved and allowed me to send off to you, I will sit down and write this one, though I know it will be a very long time before it will be in your hands. Still, I must write, for both being able to write out my thoughts, and being able to talk with you, have always helped me to ease my mind.

I miss the children dreadfully. My breasts ached painfully for the first fortnight of my captivity, but since they have received no attention, they have ceased in their swelling and leaking. It pains me to think that my dear son, my sweet little Peter, will never drink of me again. I fear that Lydia&#8217;s plans (for now I will address her by her Christian name, as I feel that no loving &#8216;Mother&#8217; of mine would drag a true mother from her children so cruelly) will keep me from my dear family for quite a long time.

I will explain all, while it is fresh in my mind, in hopes that you will someday have the full explanation for how everything has happened. As I&#8217;m sure you will recall, my dear sir, we parted outside of the Santos&#8217;s fiesta in Barcelona. My head was swimming with exhaustion and drink, and I thought of nothing but resting in our bed until you returned home to me. Our driver left me at the front door, and I bade him to go back and wait on you. The servants being out at their own fiestas, I was alone in the chateau. Or so I thought.

I went up to the bedchamber, with only a single candle to light the unfamiliar way. When I entered the room, I saw another candle already burning. Alarmed, I turned and saw (who else?) Mrs. Morrison sitting at the small desk in the corner of the large bedchamber. She wore a festive New Year&#8217;s gown, and looked as though she had been attending a party herself. She stood slowly to greet me, and though I was more than a little startled by her unexpected presence, I suspected nothing devious afoot.

�Why, my dear &#8216;Mother,&#8217;� I declared, smiling and going to the desk to greet her. �This is most unexpected. How�?�

Lydia gave me a strange smile. �I&#8217;ve been waiting for you, my pet,� she said. �I&#8217;ve been waiting such a long time for you. It&#8217;s time for us to go now.�

I shook my head in confusion. �Go? What do you mean, dear?�

�I&#8217;ve come to claim you, Lady Emily,� Lydia said calmly, though her words sent chills through me. �You&#8217;re going to belong to me now. It&#8217;s how it should be.�

�Mrs. Morrison!� I declared, uncertain of what to do. I backed away from her, but she stepped from behind the desk and advanced toward me.

�You will come with me, my pet,� she said. �I would hate to have to do anything�regrettable.�

I stopped and stared at her. �What do you mean?� I asked, my voice trembling, but sir, I believe that even at that moment, I knew the truth.

Lydia explained her plans of blackmail, and I was dumbstruck by her treachery. �But�how did you learn of this?� I asked.

Lydia gave me a briefly pouty look. �It hurts me that you would not divulge this information to me, my pet,� she said in a hurt tone. �Do you not trust your dear &#8216;Mother&#8217;?�

�Yet you would use this information against me,� I snapped back. �It is hateful.�

�What is truly hateful,� Lydia retorted, �Is the treatment that your poor friend, Mrs. Gainsley, has received at the hands of your husband. To be used for his sexual gratification, and to be lied to about her own husband&#8217;s death. And you do not deny your part in this.�

�How did you learn of this?� I asked again, my voice trembling now.&nbsp; I nearly dropped the candle, and to overcompensate, I held it tightly in my grasp, some wax dribbling down onto my hand.

�Why, Mrs. Gainsley herself informed me,� Lydia replied, looking a bit pleased with herself. I found this to be quite a shock, as I was not aware that Mrs. Gainsley knew. Did you, sir? Anyway, Lydia told me that one afternoon, during her visit at Wainwright Hall, she had been walking alone in the garden. I believe that I had been writing in my diary that afternoon�if I had been more attentive to our guest, sir, do you think that this would not have occurred? But I ease my guilt with this thought: she would have found some way to perform her terrible deeds, and I had merely offered her one additional opportunity to do so.

Anyway, on her walk in the garden, she came upon Mrs. Gainsley, who was sitting alone in sullen reflection. Lydia sat with our friend, and eventually, the two ladies made their way to the parlor for a couple of rounds of drinks. According to Lydia, drunkenness made our normally quiet friend quite talkative, as she divulged all of this to Lydia&#8217;s eager ears. Lydia confessed to me that, even then, she was planning some way to have me for herself. This had been a cause of contention between her and her late husband (whom she confesses to murdering, by the by�do not think to use this information against her in some way, as she has threatened suicide, and to still sully our names in the process). 

Lydia not only threatened to expose Miss Howard&#8217;s crime and our involvement, but as I wrote in the other letter, she also revealed that a coconspirator was prepared to do harm to our home. When I demanded to know the identity of the villain, she laughed at me. �That information is mine alone, my little pet. But if you are a good girl, it will not matter. I will feel no need to call upon this friend if you&#8217;ll only do as I say.�

I swallowed hard at that moment, sir. Oh, I was so afraid! I knew what was a stake, and I imagined the consequences of my disobedience to &#8216;Mother.&#8217; Miss Howard, hanged. You and I, separated and imprisoned, perhaps executed as �accessories to the murder.� Our children, orphaned and stripped of the Wainwright title, poor and destitute. I could not allow any of that to happen. So I asked my blackmailer, �What do you want of me, Mrs. Morrison?�

She asked me to go away with her. �I am a single woman, and I am not so old yet,� she said joyfully. �I have quite a lot of money. I convinced Mr. Morrison to cash out our accounts, so I have more than enough cash to allow us to live the comfortable lives that we so deserve.�

�Where do you want to go?� I asked in dread.

�I crave adventure,� Lydia exclaimed. �I wish to go somewhere and begin all over again�with my little pet right by my side. My darling, we are going to America.�

I had no choice. I hastily fled with her into the night, and in our party gowns, we blended in quite nicely with the other partygoers, and we passed unnoticed through the crowded streets. How I longed to reach out and ask for help! But if I did so, Lydia would certainly find some way of contacting her coconspirator�and that would be the end of us, my dear sir.

She led me to a carriage parked two streets over from our rented chateau. She ushered me in, and instructed the driver back to her lodging place. She was renting a small house, smaller than our rented chateau, and she led me to the larger of the two bedrooms. She ordered me naked, and I stripped down for her, shedding my red undergarments as well. She stood before me, still clothed, and ran a hand gently down my bare side before grasping my hip.

�You belong to me now,� she said again, looking into my eyes. �My dearest, sweetest pet�for years I have craved your cunt. I will have you now, any way I please. And I know that you want this.�

Oh, sir, I confess to you that a very tiny part of me has always wanted this attention from Mrs. Morrison. I do not begrudge you for keeping my cunt all to yourself�indeed, you are my husband, and I have been glad to follow your every order and fulfill your every desire, as you have made me so happy. I tried to defend myself against Lydia that night. I first told her that I would always belong to you, my dear husband, but she first laughed at this, then slapped me.

�Understand this, little pet,� she snapped as I held my cheek, reeling in shock from the violation. �I have given up much to have you as my own. I do not want to hear mention of your husband again.�

I know that she does not always play nicely, as you have witnessed yourself, but her cruelty over the next couple of days would have shocked you. She kept me tied down to her bed (which we have done as well, of course, but this was quite different), and delighted in the anguish that I was in from not being permitted to use the bathroom. In addition to this, she tormented my clit and cunt, of course. I wish to forget these events, but I also know that, though it will pain you, you will want to know these things for yourself. It is better for us to be honest with one another, is it not?

She lapped at me, like a mother cat cleaning her kitten, and I, gagged and exhausted in every sense of the word, moaned helplessly. She brought me to the brink of an orgasm, and though I&#8217;d been holding back, not wanting to allow her to give me the pleasure that I&#8217;d always willingly received from you, I finally gave in and relaxed, only for her to stop, stand, take off her own gown, and straddle my head, removing my gag and shoving her pussy into my face. �Mother first, that&#8217;s a good little pet��

What else could I do, sir? But it felt a bit more comfortable, as it was something that you&#8217;d always allowed me to do before. Though I still cried, I ate her with the same enthusiasm as always, imagining that you were watching me with approval. For a brief moment, I wondered if you yourself were not her coconspirator, if the two of you had not set up this elaborate ruse, a New Year&#8217;s Eve surprise for me. Hope fluttered in my heart�but no. No, if you were conspiring with Mrs. Morrison to tease me, and were secretly witnessing our activities, I know that you would not allow her to strike me, or to taste of my cunt. Nor would you have any part in the murder of your old friend Mr. Morrison. May the dear man rest in peace!

My thoughts are scattered, so I will continue with my narrative. With ease, I ate Lydia to what, from her cries, seemed to be a very satisfying orgasm. After crying out and instructing me to clean her thoroughly, she gagged me again and touched my face, wiping away the tears that continued to silently flow. �Poor pet,� she teased, smiling cheerfully. �Little pet wants her pleasure?� She plunged her head between my legs again, and again, I tried to resist�

And the game went on as such for what felt like ages. She would pleasure me, but would ultimately deny me an orgasm, only to force me to please her again and again. When she had exhausted herself, she gagged me once more and placed a hand on my swollen clit. It burned painfully as she rubbed it with a gentle finger. I wriggled and moaned, and sir, I was so desperate for release. I had even stopped resisting, and still she denied me.

Lydia laughed at me. �You&#8217;ll get plenty of pleasure, my pet�when you show Mother what a good girl you can be for her.� She yawned dramatically. �It has been such a long night, my pet. Let us sleep as long as we please; tomorrow night, we will be leaving Barcelona, so we must be well-rested.� Still naked, she kept me bound and wrapped herself around me, covering us with the soft blankets before extinguishing the single candle that burned. I was still gagged as she kissed my cheek. �Goodnight, my sweet pet. Mother loves you so much. I hope you understand how much I do.�

I remained thus tied to the bed until the following night. As Lydia dressed and hastily packed away her things (along with my gown from the previous night, the one thing that I had brought with me), I let out cries of distress behind my gag. I was so hungry, and I so badly needed to relieve my bladder. Lydia glanced over at me once, smiling sweetly. �Wait a moment, little pet. Mother&#8217;s almost finished packing.�

When she finally removed the gag, I whimpered, �Please, I really need to use the toilet��

Lydia laughed softly. �The poor little pet has to go potty, does she? Well, little pet, we don&#8217;t have much time to waste, so if you must go, you better just go where you are.�

It took me a moment to comprehend her meaning. �Do�do you mean for me to urinate in this bed?�

Lydia grinned at me, and her gleefulness at my humiliation frightened me the most. �You&#8217;ll just have to be a dirty little pet for this trip, because you will be traveling in this large trunk right here.� She gestured to an open trunk on the floor, which had been lined with blankets.

I balked at this. I cried and tried to reason with her. She merely smiled, gagging me again and looking down at me with that same grin. �I&#8217;ll give you five minutes, my pet. If you haven&#8217;t gone by then, you&#8217;ll just have to go in the trunk. And the train ride to Madrid is by no means a short one, my naughty little pet.�

It shames me to confess my humiliation to you, sir, but I imagine that you would not judge me for it. I did urinate in that bed, and I cried, and Lydia was quite deviously pleased. She then proceeded to tie me up in a folded and quite uncomfortable position. She forced me to place the bottoms of my feet on my backs of my thighs, bending my legs in half, before restraining them in this uncomfortable position with thin ropes. She bound my arms behind my back, my elbows nearly touching, and my shoulders were terribly strained. The gag stayed on, of course.

Lydia dragged the trunk to the side of the bed. You would be surprised by her strength, sir, as she picked me up (bundle that I was) and placed me inside. Belly-down, I struggled to look up at her as she smiled at me, with a look of mock benevolence. �Be a quiet little pet, now,� she instructed. �If you&#8217;re a good little girl all the way to Madrid, Mother will have a nice surprise for you.� Before I could make any tiny noise of protest, she slammed the lid of the trunk, and I heard the click of the heavy lock. 

Terrified, and exhausted from hunger and dehydration, I was silent when Lydia&#8217;s hired driver came and picked up her luggage, including me in the trunk. Needless to say, sir, the entire trip (the bumpy ride in the carriage, then the train ride, during which my trunk served as Lydia&#8217;s footrest) was most unpleasant. But I was preoccupied by my worried thoughts. What was going to happen? To me, to you, to our children�all of these worries clouded my mind as I waited in terrible discomfort in the darkness of the trunk. 

Having taken a night train, we arrived in Madrid in the morning (though time stretched on for me as I lay helpless and bound). I felt the train stopping, then I was being picked up and moved a ways, to another carriage. On the bumpy ride I heard no voices, and for a moment I feared that Lydia had tricked me again, and had handed off my trunk to a stranger, who would treat me even more cruelly than she.

I willed myself not to panic. The large trunk only had a small opening to allow for the flow of oxygen, and if I were to hyperventilate, I would surely lose consciousness. I think you would be proud, sir, of how calm I remained in the situation, all things considered. I imagined (and still do) that you are always watching me, which gives me pause to wonder how you would think of each and every one of my actions. Ever far away from you, and I still crave your approval as desperately as I did as a little girl!

When the trunk was finally laid down and opened, I found myself in an expensive hotel room in Madrid. Lydia looked down at me, smiling wickedly again. �Well, little pet, the first part of our journey is complete.� Hearing me whimper involuntarily, she cooed, �Poor little dear. Such a stinky little pet; you&#8217;ll be very good while Mother gives you a bath, won&#8217;t you?�

I was terribly thirsty by then, and my head ached. But I would have done anything to get out of that trunk and stretch my limbs. I nodded pathetically, and she hoisted me from the trunk, placing me unceremoniously on the floor. �Mother&#8217;s going to untie you, and you&#8217;ll be very good, won&#8217;t you, pet?� 

I nodded again, and let out a loud moan into my gag as my restraints were removed. When Lydia helped me to stand, I cautiously stretched. When she reached out to touch my face, I involuntarily recoiled�until I realized she was going to remove the horrid gag. This particular gag, sir, was in the shape of a large cock, and Lydia had forced it all the way down my throat! I coughed after she&#8217;d extracted it, and my coughs became dry spasms. Unable to support myself on my weak legs, I dropped to my hands and knees and resumed to have quite a coughing fit. When I had a brief reprieve, I looked up with bleary eyes and saw Lydia standing over me with a glass of water. �Here, pet,� she said gently. �Take a drink, slowly, that&#8217;s a good little girl.�

After slowly drinking half of the water glass, I handed it back to her. �Thank you,� I said softly, my throat scratchy.

�You&#8217;re welcome, my pet,� Lydia said, her voice dripping with honey. I dissolved into sobs again.

�Oh, Mrs. Morrison,� I cried. �Why are you doing this? You&#8217;ve always been a kind friend to me, but now you�� I sobbed, so confused and frightened by the whole ordeal. I only wanted to feel your arms around me again, I wanted you to hold me close and tell me that everything was fine, as you always do, sir. 

Lydia made her attempt. She helped me from the floor and sat with me on the soft bed. She stoked my hair and held me in her lap. �Emily,� she said gently, �I told you a long time ago how much I love you. You know that I&#8217;ve dreamed of being with you�I haven&#8217;t made this a secret, have I?�

�No,� I said hesitantly. Sir, I&#8217;m sure that you&#8217;ll have read all about it in my diary before you have the chance to receive this letter. I know that you&#8217;re already aware of the fact that Lydia is in love with me, and I know that, in some ways, this has been upsetting to you. I swear to you, sir, as I declared to Lydia that morning, I always knew of her feelings toward me, but I never dreamed that it would drive her to take such desperate and deplorable measures!

�You also know,� Lydia went on, her voice still warm and comforting, �That I have not truly been happy since the days when I was with your mother. And that being with you again has brought back all of those feelings in me�your mother made me feel beautiful, and strong, when all of my life I have been made to feel helpless. Well, I most certainly am not helpless. I have money, which is a power in itself, and I have my little pet, and that is all I will ever need, Emily.�

�But what about what I need?� I dared to ask, though I spoke with a weak timidity. �What about my h�my family? My children, Mrs. Morrison? I know what it is to have grown up without a mother��

�You said it yourself, in Calcutta, that you have fared quite well under your guardian,� Lydia said, almost a little mockingly, though with a tone that one might interpret as being envious. �If he can raise you up himself, I&#8217;m sure that he can handle his own children, with the help of your other friends. As long as you are cooperative and do not force me to contact my own friend, of course.�

Ah, yes. She had to remind me that the threat lay over my head constantly. But I couldn&#8217;t help remarking, �You are quite heartless to do this to me, Mrs. Morrison. I would never dream that a friend of mine would betray me in such a way.�

Lydia helped me to stand, untroubled by my words. �In time, my pet, you will be happy with me again. Do not forget the fun that we&#8217;ve had before, and not just the sex. You&#8217;ll learn to enjoy being Mother&#8217;s spoiled little pet.� 

But as she bathed me in the large tub, I vowed to never address her as &#8216;Mother&#8217; again. She still uses this in reference to herself while we play, but the sentiment only fills me with disgust. That I could become so intimately involved with one so cruel�and I imagine, sir, that if you have been successful in identifying her by now, you are grappling with your own guilt. How were we to know, sir? We meant no harm in our games, but look what I have done. I have not only brought about the end of one poor man&#8217;s life, but have placed the lives of others, the ones I hold most dear, in danger. I would do anything to bring Mr. Morrison back, and to make up for what l have unknowingly done.

Lydia fingered me as she bathed me, but again denied me release. The burning pain returned to my clit, and I still moaned as she helped me from the tub, slowly drying me and spreading lotion on my skin, fingering me still, denying me, tormenting me. �Please�� I whimpered at one point, and she grinned again.

�Be a good girl, and you&#8217;ll get what you need,� Lydia reminded me. She took me to the bed (I, still naked), and tied me down. She gagged me (this time, thankfully, with a gag that did not go down my throat) and touched me face, smiling lovingly, the same way I would smile at our precious children after tucking them in to sleep. �I bet this little pet is very hungry,� she said, and though I&#8217;d forgotten my hunger, it returned, ravenous. My stomach even growled audibly, and Lydia laughed. �I will go downstairs and get some lunch for us. Pretty pet�close your eyes and rest for a minute, that&#8217;s it��

I heard her leave the room, and opened my eyes. Alone, I sobbed again, wondering how long her cruel treatment would continue.

We stayed in Madrid for a fortnight. Lydia admitted to me that she heard tell of an investigation, seeking out a missing Englishwoman who had disappeared from Barcelona on New Years. When she said this, hope fluttered in my heart briefly once again, but she dashed my hopes by adding that, until we have left Europe, I will be kept locked away. Her treatment of me has continued much in the same way that I have described. When she is gone, I am tied down and gagged; when she is present, I am forced to satisfy her perverse pleasures, while mine are still denied. When she eats, I am at her feet, taking the little scraps that she offers, and finally eating what is left over from her plate after she places it on the floor, dipping my head in like a housedog. Lydia is doing everything possible to turn me into her �little pet,� and though it makes me burn with indignation, I am obedient in hopes that my family will continue to be safe.

When we took the train from Madrid to Porto, I was forced to travel again in the trunk. I didn&#8217;t even try to beg Lydia not to put me in it; I have found that, when she is determined in something, there is very little that will sway her. She promised that it would be the last time, and that when we board the ship to New York, I will not be so viciously confined�as long as I am a �good girl,� of course.

Feeling a bit more secure in Portugal, Lydia has allowed me to go out on the streets with her, and sometimes it feels a little like the old days, when we were in Calcutta or London together, just two lady friends out for an afternoon of lunch and shopping. She put in a rush-order on some dresses for me to wear while we are traveling. She has decided that she will introduce me as her daughter, and I persuaded her to allow me to go by �Mrs. Singer.� 

We have been here but a week. Yesterday, I convinced Lydia to allow me to write you the vague letter that I sent off to you just this afternoon. �My family may think that I am dead,� I argued. �Please, Lydia, if you have ever truly loved me, allow me this one small thing.� And she relented, leaving me tied to go and procure the necessary supplies for letter-writing. She also gifted me this notebook in which I write now, and is sitting and reading while allowing me, for the first time since she claimed me, to sort out my thoughts on paper.

Tomorrow, very early, we will be on our way to America. My imagination is filled with scenarios of my escape, and there is a small hope in me that I will find some way to slip away from Lydia, and to make my way home to you while she is bound on the ship. But even now, sir, I know that I cannot take such a risk. I think only of my loved ones, including you, in this decision. I will continue to be a �good pet,� and will satisfy Lydia&#8217;s whims and desires, in hopes that she will find it in her heart to allow me to return to my children.

I am quite exhausted, sir, and I know that Lydia will have me satisfy her far into the night. I hope that I can find some way to send this to you soon, but for the time being, I will simply continue to write, in hopes that someday, sooner or later, you will read this and understand the hardships that I have endured. I love you very much, sir, with all of my heart, and each time I think of you or our children or even our dear friends the sisters, my heart breaks again and again.

Love,

Your Emily



18 February, 18&#8212;

My dearest sir,

We are arrived in America this past week, after several weeks onboard the ship. I constantly thought of the trips that you and I have taken to far away places, especially the ones after you claimed me as your lover. This trip was certainly not so fun, and each day I reflected that I was traveling further and further away from my home, from you and my loves. 

An idea came into my head that we might make our way to Boston. I remember your mother&#8217;s address there, as I have kept contact with her over the years (moreso than you have, as she never failed to note), and I felt if I could find some way to her, I could get help�or at least find a way to get further word to you. But alas, Lydia has revealed that we will not be making our way to Boston any time soon, and as I am never allowed from her side in public, I find it difficult to execute any plans to procure my freedom.

Lydia&#8217;s treatment of me has improved since we boarded the ship in Porto, though she still keeps me restrained when she must leave me alone. She no longer denies me pleasure, and sir (for the sake of full disclosure), though the climaxes that she allows me are as intense as any I&#8217;ve ever experienced, I find that it is joyless. I must often hold back my tears as Lydia extracts the violating phallus from my cunt, or uses her tongue to clean the mess of my juices from my pussy and thighs. She has no patience for my sorrow, once delivering a sound thrashing (more brutal than any she ever delivered to me in our previous play, and certainly more heartless than any beating you&#8217;d ever given to me out of love and pleasure) after I began sobbing uncontrollably onboard the ship. She truly does not care for my feelings, and so I mourn in private.

While in public, Lydia treats me as she did before: as her companion, her friend, with the same open affection as ever. I try to smile and be as polite as ever. We have made few acquaintances in New York (though Lydia&#8217;s social circle is wider than I&#8217;d suspected, which I will explain soon). But in private, in the lavish hotel room that we are sharing, I am her pet. I wear nothing but the new nipple clips that she gave me (they hurt terribly when she first put them on me, though I find that I do enjoy the constant pull and dull stinging pain), and the collar that she gifted to me. It is as uncomfortable as the first collar that you gave to me, sir, in the early days of my servitude to you. But I know she would not be so understanding if it were to go missing.

I am forced to crawl upon my hands and knees throughout the suite. When Lydia takes her afternoon tea, she pours a bit into a saucer for me, and I unwillingly lap it up like a spoiled cat. She feeds me a pastry from her own hand, stroking my hair as I lick the remains from her fingers. This degradation, at first, made me cry silent tears as I ate, so pitiful I felt. But I am numb to it now, though I am always relieved when Lydia suggests going out for a meal, which allows me to dine like a human being.

Lydia enjoys going out in the evening, taking in a show or going to a social club to have drinks and flirt with gentlemen. I find that I am in no mood to be flirtacious, as I once so enjoyed (and you have witnessed countless times), and I sit in stony silence, smiling little, speaking less, knowing that at the end of the evening I will be dragged back to our hotel room to resume my role as Mother&#8217;s pet. 

It would appear that, even as a good little pet, I do not satisfy all of Lydia&#8217;s needs. Just this evening, Lydia had decided to go out on her own, and had tied me down to the bed, of course. She stooped to kiss me softly. �I will not be out too late, my little pet. I will see you very soon.� I dozed uneasily as the time passed, for by now I am used to my restraints (after all, I have had years of practice under your care, though you had never kept me restrained for such long periods of time), and was rudely awoken by Lydia&#8217;s return.

�Hello, my dear little pet,� she said, closing the door leading into the main room behind her as she entered our bedchamber. She was clearly a little drunk. �Mother has brought home a gentleman friend for the evening. Would this little pet care to join us?� She sat down on the side of the bed and removed my gag.

 I certainly had no interest in joining Lydia and a strange man for any cruel games, and wondered if she would force me to play along. �No, thank you,� I said softly, adding, �Please don&#8217;t make me��

�Oh, come, come,� Lydia said lightly. �You are my little pet, and if you wish to save yourself just for my enjoyment, I take no issue with it.� I was tempted to correct her, sir, and explain that I was saving myself for you, as best I could considering the circumstances. �You are not hurt that I would bring a gentleman into our suite, are you, pet?�

�No, Lydia,� I assured her. I hope that she finds some wealthy American gentleman to love, and perhaps allows me my freedom after finding new happiness. But I don&#8217;t believe that she is seeking out love or companionship from her gentleman caller this evening�simply a cock to play with.

�I hope that you will wish to join me sometime,� Lydia said in an offhand way as she untied my restraints. �Well, little pet, I will be entertaining my guest in the sitting room, and I will tell you honestly that we will be making our way into the other bedchamber. I&#8217;m going to lock the door and leave you untied, my pretty little pet. Do you need anything?�

�No, thank you,� I said again. I am still surprised, sir, that she did not leave me tied for the evening. 

Lydia kissed me softly before leaving me alone. �Goodnight, my pretty little pet. Mother loves you.�

�Goodnight, Lydia,� I said. Though I have told her that I love her in the past, I find that I cannot say it now. I will confess, sir, that though she has wronged me terribly, I do not hate her. I cannot hate her. It is quite difficult for me to explain, but I do feel certain that you will somehow understand me. You always understood me best, sir, and I do miss you terribly.

I realize that I will be sleeping unrestrained and alone for the first time since my captivity began. I will try to enjoy my private rest tonight, though I know that, as always, I will be disturbed by my restless thoughts. I think of you always, sir, and I know that you lay awake at night, as troubled as I, thinking on me and worrying as I do. I try to remind myself that it could be worse, much worse, and each morning I remind myself that I am alive. As long as I am living, I will find my way home to you.

Love,

Your Emily


2 March, 18&#8212;

My dearest sir,

The situation has gotten stranger, as if that were possible! Allow me to explain what has happened.

We have remained in our hotel suite in New York these past few weeks. Perhaps two or three evenings a week, Lydia goes out alone to meet with a gentleman, bringing him back to our hotel suite to play. I have not joined in any of her games, and am kept locked away in the other bedchamber as before. Prior to the events of this afternoon, I did not know if Lydia was consistently seeing the same gentleman, or had multiple playmates already. I have purposefully not asked her about this, simply for the fact that I know she wants me to. It has been my one little source of power in my subordinate position.

But this afternoon, I learned the true nature of these little playtime sessions. You see, sir, I had talked Lydia into allowing me to sit down and go through her finances for her. As you already know, Lydia has never been the most responsible with money, and she spends more on me than ever before. I already have a ridiculously enormous wardrobe of clothing (most of which I haven&#8217;t even had the chance to wear yet), everything that we consume is ordered in from the hotel or from nice restaurants, not to mention the cost to stay in our suite�I know that the Morrisons had a fortune, but I feared that Lydia was mindlessly squandering away her money, and we would be penniless in a strange country, so far from home and from you.

When I asked Lydia about the finances, she laughed at me at first. �My silly little pet,� she cooed, �Why do you need to worry about the money? Did I not say that Mother would take good care of you?�

�It would ease my mind to know the financial situation,� I said. And so, Lydia agreed to provide me with her bank records and receipts, and I sat down and made lists and calculations, the same way you taught me to when I was a little girl. As I worked, I thought of the first time that you sat me down in front of the records of my fortune and made me go over everything with you.

�Why do I need to know this?� I remember whining. At 10, I was much more interested in reading my fantasy stories and playing on the grounds and riding horses. You had given me a patient smile.

�My dear child, you possess a moderate fortune. You must be responsible for knowing what is happening to your money. Otherwise, what would stop someone from taking advantage of your ignorance?�

Your logic made sense, but I frowned. �But sir�you always said that you&#8217;d take care of my finances.�

�Quite true,� you replied. �But Emily, what if I were no longer here to do that?� Upon seeing the tears of worry brim in my eyes (for any thought of losing you frightened me more than anything), you smiled again. �I&#8217;m not planning on going anywhere, my child. But it is my responsibility, as your guardian and friend, to teach you how to be independent. Sit down, my dear, and let me show you what you own.�

I listened with rapt attention as you showed me all of the records of my fortune. My inheritance had been divided into two different accounts. One account was for the maintenance of Wainwright Hall, and the money there was used to pay the taxes and the servants&#8217; salaries, among other things. �Do you see what I&#8217;ve done with this account?� you asked. �I have listed out the costs of maintenance for each year, and the rest of it, I have invested to make more, rather than just letting it sit.� You showed me how you would dip into these investments to pay the next year&#8217;s expenses, and how the investments that you made actually allowed the account to grow, even though money was constantly drawn from it. You showed me the final tally of my account as it stood at that point.

The other account held the funds set aside for me personally. This money was never touched, unless you drew from it for further investments. You even showed me the paperwork for a trading ship that I owned, as well as the certificates for my investments in trading companies based in London, India, and Canada. I was wonderstruck by the time you showed me how much more I had than when my father had died a few years before. �You were already wealthy, my child, but look how much you have now.�

From then on, I looked forward to sitting with you every season and going over my accounts. I have no doubt that, even in my absence, you attend to my fortune with the same care as ever. Using the skills that you&#8217;d taught me, I went through Lydia&#8217;s records, and found that, while she still had the majority of the money that she&#8217;d started with, it would all be gone before too long if she kept spending as she did.

I explained this to her patiently, hoping that, in seeing her situation, she would see the light and change her plans. �With no money coming in, Lydia, you&#8217;re going to drive yourself to financial ruin.�

But she smiled at that. �Oh, but my pet, there is money coming in.�

I was puzzled. �Really?� Perhaps she had investments that I was not aware of.

She grinned. �The gentlemen that I&#8217;ve been seeing have been very generous to me.� She went to the safe in our suite and brought me the stack of money. In only a few short weeks, she had procured hundreds of dollars.

�Lydia!� I exclaimed. �All of this from your suitors?�

She smiled again. �They&#8217;re all wealthy gentlemen who will pay a high price for�my specialties.� I realized then what was happening. She was not seeing these men strictly for the fun of it, but was whoring herself. She revealed to me that all of these men (her �clients�) are powerful in their fields of work, but are submissive when it comes to sexual activities. She dominates them in the same way that she dominates me, and they pay her for the pleasure of serving her! 

After getting over the initial shock of this new information, I counted the money. �Well,� I said, �This resolves some of the issue. But Lydia, you&#8217;re still spending the money faster than you&#8217;re bringing it in��

�Yes,� Lydia said with a sigh, �I know. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve been considering how I might take my talents and turn them into a money-making venture.� She has dreams of opening up a �gentlemen&#8217;s parlour,� one that would specialize in the sort of activities that you and I have enjoyed for so many years. She had even been talking about it with one of her clients, a gentleman with investments in mines in California. �Such places as I wish to open are all over New York,� she said. �I have been thinking on it, my little pet, and I think that we will soon be making our way to California.�

I was dismayed by this news, to say the least, sir. There is already an entire ocean between us, and now there will be a continent between us as well!&nbsp; But Lydia has already set her plans into motion to travel to San Francisco. Her client, an older gentleman by the name of Robert Lagrange, will accompany us, paying for all of our traveling expenses, in exchange for Lydia&#8217;s company.

She assures me that my company is not part of the bargain. I believe, sir, I have made it clear to her that I have no wish to be involved in her games. As cruel as she has been to me, she has respected me in this regard, though I do fear that she will expect me to take on a role in her new business.

My head spins with everything that has happened in only a few weeks. After our discussion this afternoon, I sat alone and sobbed pitifully, thinking again of you and our dear children. Lydia left me alone to sob as she cheerfully began going over her own plans for her adventure. I am unwillingly being dragged along on this wild ride, and I fear where it may lead.

I am exhausted, and I find, sir, for the very first time, that I have gained no relief from my writing, though thinking about the happier times with you does cheer me up some. I pray that you are creating happy memories with our children, memories that you will be able to share with me upon my return (I pray to God that it will be sooner rather than later!). Until then and always, my dear sir, I am ever,

Your Emily


27 March, 18&#8212;

My dearest sir,

The dye is cast. We are on our way to San Francisco on the morrow. I still tremble with fear as we continue this ill-fated adventure. I do feel that we are bound for catastrophe.

Lydia and I had the most ferocious fight last night. I was sitting at her feet in the sitting room of the hotel suite, as she put aside our final boarding passes for the train and other necessary documents for our trip. I tried, one last time, to change her mind. �Lydia,� I said quietly (when I am at her feet, sir, I do feel quite powerless, and it is involuntarily expressed in my countenance and tone), �My dear friend, what would it take for you to reconsider this?�

She glanced down at me with a look of mild impatience, but smiled a little. �What are you chattering on about, little pet? Come now, we&#8217;re going on an adventure. I thought you were an adventurous little girl.�

As you&#8217;ve read in my diary, sir, I used to dream of dashing off to far away places and seeing the whole world. You fulfilled enough of that with our own little adventures, and I thank you heartily for giving me exposure to the world, for I feel that it has made me a more conscious and complete person. Again, words fail me to describe the good that you&#8217;ve done for me, in so many ways�it brings tears to my eyes to think of it, especially in my current pitiful state, but I will write on.

I said to Lydia, �I used to crave adventure, my friend, and you know this to be true. But Lydia�I have children and a family��

�Oh, that again!� she said with a flippant wave of her hand. �My dear pet, I have no doubt that they are faring well without you.�

This stung me, sir. Though I do not doubt that it is true (for they have you, and as I said, you always did so much for me), but to hear her say it in such an offhand way�I do not doubt that I have been a good mother and a good wife. I have been attentive to the needs of all of my loves, at least as best I could. The sisters have helped, and I hope that they continue to do so, as long as it fulfills them. I will never doubt that, with their father, our children will be in good hands. But I know that my presence is missed, and Lydia will not be able to persuade me otherwise.

I knew that to argue this point with her would be fruitless, so I replied, �But I am not faring well without them.�

She looked down at me silently for a moment, her pale face contemplatively. �Not happy with me yet, my dear?� she finally asked.

�You know that I am not,� I dared to retort. I winced involuntarily, fearing the back of her hand, but I continued, �My children mean the world to me, Lydia.�

�If it is children that you want, we can arrange for you to have another child,� Lydia suggested. I was enraged by the suggestion, and that is what sparked the fight and the punishment that followed.

�You would have to force me to carry any other man&#8217;s child but my husband&#8217;s,� I said, finding my ferocity as I rose slowly to my feet. �You may violate me, and I know that I cannot stop you, but I will never be with another man.�

Lydia stood as well, and that is when the slap was delivered. �Do you think that your husband is not enjoying other women in your absence?� she demanded. I, still standing, backed away a little, vulnerable in my nakedness, but I did try to stand my ground. 

�I hope it is so,� I replied. And I do, sir, and I know that it is so. I hope your needs are as fulfilled as possible while I am away.

�Stupid pet,� Lydia declared, and she slapped at me again, swinging her arm with such force that I did fall to the floor. She grabbed me by the hair and dragged me to the bedchamber. She tied me to one of the tall bedposts, my spine pressed against the thick post in a most uncomfortable manner, my arms forced behind my back and attached from my elbows to my wrists, my ankles forced together and bound. Lydia gagged me, and wrapped the strap around both my head and the post itself, leaving me almost virtually immobile.

�Your husband could never love you the way that I do,� Lydia said as she procured a riding crop from the closet. You see, sir, her largest trunk had contained me�the second-largest trunk contained her implements of pleasure and pain. �I know exactly what this whorish little pet needs. Your husband could not give you all of the attention that you crave, and turned you over to others to do what he should have done for you.�

Oh, sir, I do not believe these ramblings for a second! But her tirade continued as she viciously beat me, whipping my tits and stomach and thighs with that riding crop. You know how much I enjoy punishment, and for a while, I did enjoy this abuse. But Lydia pushed further, continuing to whip me without mercy, and the pain became almost unbearable. She did not comfort me when she had finished exerting herself. She left me alone as silent tears flowed down my face, and I wondered if she would bring in a man to rape me, to further her power over me and take away the one thing that I have left.

No. She did return a time later, with a large glass of water, which she threw in my face. Still gagged, I sputtered in surprise from the harsh treatment, wondering what sort of cruelties she had in store for me now. But she smiled, and removed my gag, and whispered, �It will be easier on you, pet, if you accept what is happening to you. Accept what I am offering to you. Accept your new life. You&#8217;ll be so much happier if you do.�

I nodded in compliance, but I refuse to accept anything in my heart. True, we will be on our way to San Francisco tomorrow, and there isn&#8217;t anything I can do about it. But I haven&#8217;t accepted it. I refuse to give up on finding my way home. But for now, I fear I must continue to cooperate, and continue to be dragged along on Lydia&#8217;s adventure. 

I will admit, sir, that a very small part of me is excited to see a part of the world where I have never been. Lydia, after untying me and allowing me to put on some undergarments for the evening, provided me with some information about California, and San Francisco itself. The city lies on a large and beautiful bay, and it has grown rapidly in the past few decades�first from gold mining (which Mr. Lagrange, Lydia&#8217;s �friend,� has successfully invested in), but railroad production has also led to a population spike. Many immigrants from Asian countries have made their home there. I suppose that, for the time being, I will be making my home there as well.

I do wish that I could send these letters off to you, sir. I do not doubt that I could, at some point, find some way to slip them into the post without Lydia&#8217;s knowledge (though no such opportunity has been afforded to me yet). But I also fear the unnamed coconspirator�who&#8217;s to say that this person would not have access to the mail for Wainwright Hall? What if this person sees mail come in from America (either from myself, or through some kindly assistant) and informs Lydia of my disobedience? The consequences keep me from the attempt. 

I may as well put it to paper, no matter when you&#8217;ll be able to read it: I do fear that one of the Howard sisters may be the coconspirator. Oh, yes! Lydia has not herself hinted to this, clever as she is, but I have this fear in my heart that one of our friends has betrayed us. But neither scenario makes sense to me. Miss Howard has so much to lose, as she herself committed the crime that hangs over our heads. And I cannot imagine Mrs. Gainsley to be so treacherous. They have both done so much for us and our children that I hate to have such suspicions. I do believe that they are caused by my absence and strange circumstances, and not by any sort of truth. But if you do receive this letter in a timely manner�do be cautious. I know you will be.

I love you with all of my heart, sir.

Sincerely,

Your Emily










Mr. Singer

When word got around to our friends and neighbors that Lady Emily had gone missing, Wainwright Hall was flooded with curious well-wishers. I had been tempted to turn them all away, but Mrs. Gainsley convinced me to greet them politely. �Would your wife want you to turn them away so rudely?� she asked gently, and of course, I knew that she would not.

After that initial tide of callers, however, social activity almost completely ceased at Wainwright Hall. After we had wed, I had allowed Emily to host an annual spring party for our friends, but the first spring after her kidnapping went by without a celebration. I declined all invitations to parties and social gatherings those first two years, but it seemed that this did not alienate me from my neighbors. Indeed, they seemed to view it as appropriate that I would abstain from social gatherings during that time, as though I were a widow in mourning. They of course did not know the truth about Emily&#8217;s disappearance, and wild stories and rumors continued to circulate for years after.

Miss Howard, when not occupied by her duties to the children or to me, was as outgoing as ever, attending all social gatherings with or without escort (and often, I was sure, sneaking away for a little playtime of her own). Her sister, on the other hand, was as much of a homebody as I, and when the children were laid down to the sleep on those warm summer nights, she and I would play in the study or even in the garden. During these times, I was briefly able to forget my grief and lose myself in fun. But alas! As soon as I was in my bed alone, I thought of my poor little Emily again.

I threw myself into my work, often conducting it right out of my office at Wainwright Hall in order to spend more time with the children. Mina, like her mother, was a sharp little thing, and before her mother had been gone but a year, she was reading quite well on her own. I remembered a discussion that Emily and I had had, only a month before that ill-fated trip to Barcelona, regarding our daughter&#8217;s education.

Sitting together in the study on a chilly evening, we had been delighting in how wonderful our children were. Emily had expressed that she wished for our daughter to be formally educated. �My dear,� I asked suddenly, �Do you regret not going off to school yourself?�

My wife looked at me steadily. �Well, sir, I do sometimes wonder�� she said, but could not proceed. So it was decided that Mina would be sent to school, when the right time came. I could now only hope that Emily would be home to help see our daughter off. I spent much time with the girl, as I had with her mother, teaching her languages (though it seemed that Emily had given her a good start on French and German), mathematics, history, and exposing her to the same writers and poets that her mother had read. I was determined to mold my little Mina into a replica of her mother, as close as one could be without as much of a physical resemblance. Mina&#8217;s resemblance to me had become more obvious as she became older.

My boy Peter would never know his mother at all, but as he grew, he did seem to miss her. He clung to his &#8216;Auntie Bea&#8217; ferociously, and I confess that I did not discourage this. If any woman were worthy of standing in the place of his mother, it was our dear Mrs. Gainsley, and she devoted herself to taking care of all the needs of the children more than ever. Even after everything that happened, I was quite grateful to her.

Some days were more difficult than others. Some days, I found no point in rising from my bed, and would spend the day dozing fitfully, thinking about my Emily, longing for her. On days like these, I was tempted to say, the hell with Mrs. Morrison&#8217;s threats, and head to London to find the best private investigator to bring my wife home. But I would think of Emily&#8217;s note again�my wife believed that the threat was very real, and I had no doubt that, after the damage Mrs. Morrison had caused already, she would not hesitate to bring us to ruin. 

Days like these occurred less and less often as time passed. In spite of what I&#8217;d lost, I still had more than most. I had two wonderful and healthy children, and two lovely women to tend to my sexual needs. And my law practice was thriving. For so many years, it had only been me on my own. But through correspondence with an old law school acquaintance, a year after my wife&#8217;s disappearance I took on a partner. Daniel Shelton was fresh out of Cambridge, and though he had grown up in London (a poor young man, as it were), he was eager to experience a quiet country life, and knew that a decent salary could go far there, along with the right connections. Shelton took up a room in a local boarding house, and after I&#8217;d shown him our small offices in the village, I took him up to Wainwright Hall.

The sisters joined us for drinks and dinner. When we arrived, Miss Howard was waiting for us in the parlor, and she strode forward in her cleavage-revealing gown and offered her hand to our guest, purring in greeting. �Mr. Shelton, Sir Aaron has told us so much about you already�he didn&#8217;t mention what a handsome young lad you were,� she said, not holding back. My new partner blushed.

�Where is your sister?� I asked, more annoyed than amused by Miss Howard&#8217;s whorish manners.

�She insisted on putting down the children herself,� Miss Howard said with a shrug. She went to the drink cart. �Whiskey for you, Sir Aaron? And what will you have, Mr. Shelton?� She served up the drinks (the poor young man taking his in a trembling hand). I sat at my armchair, leaving Shelton to the mercy of Miss Howard on the couch. She was hungry for him. I hadn&#8217;t gotten a feel yet for how willing Shelton would be to join in our games�but then again, I believe that any man would be most willing. Women are the same way, I should note, but usually require a bit more prompting.

I had been negligent to the needs of my whores, I must admit. Certainly, we had our playtime, but it lacked in the spirit, in the fun, of when we&#8217;d all played together, with Emily. Alfonso Beaumont had not joined us since my wife&#8217;s disappearance (though I knew that Miss Howard kept on with him from time to time); we were all forgetting what it was to lose ourselves in passion and lust, and were merely going through the motions. Yes, a handsome newcomer would mix things up, I knew, and when Emily returned she&#8217;d be delighted with the new playmate. Shelton, young as he was, still carried a bit of baby-fat on his face, though his body was of solid build. When he&#8217;d removed his hat, his brown curls had sprung wildly around his head. Emily would find his boyish looks to be rather endearing.

When Mrs. Gainsley joined us, Shelton and I both stood to greet her. Compared to her sister she looked most conservative, in her lovely but modest gown and her hair tied back tightly, as was her style. Oh, how I loved to grab her hair and pull it loose, watching it tumble wildly down her back. My lovely Beatrice.

I introduced my partner to my friend, and offered her a drink. As I poured her a glass of wine, I suddenly had an idea. Young Shelton and sweet, widowed Mrs. Gainsley�looking at them, as they talked politely, I thought they would make a handsome couple. For a moment, though, I only felt saddened that my Emily was not there to work her magic, she always had such a way of bringing people together. But I resolved that my partner and my dear friend would know each other, quite well. In some regards, I was most successful.

I distracted Miss Howard as we finished our drinks, not wanting her to bristle from being ignored by our guest as he talked with Mrs. Gainsley. He was mostly asking polite questions about what it was like to live in that area, though he certainly seemed more comfortable with her mild ways than her sister&#8217;s aggressive ones. We made our way into the dining hall for dinner, and Shelton dominated the conversation with his stories about life at Cambridge. Wine loosened him up, and by the time we went into the study for cigars (Miss Howard boldly lighting one for herself and her sister, as Mrs. Gainsley, light-headed with drink herself, giggled), I felt certain that the night ahead would be a memorable one.

�So, Mr. Shelton,� Miss Howard said, perching on the corner of my desk, �How many young ladies did you fuck at Cambridge?�

Shelton made the mistake of inhaling his smoke, so surprised was he by Miss Howard&#8217;s forward questioning, and proceeded to have a small coughing fit. Mrs. Gainsley rushed to get him a glass of water, and I mock-scolded my whore. 

Shelton, recovering himself, gestured that he was all right.&nbsp; �Well, Miss Howard,� he said, his face shaded crimson (certainly from both drink and embarrassment), �For a short time at school, I was celibate.� At Miss Howard&#8217;s disgusted look, he smiled a little and explained, �You see, my family grew up quite poor, in the slums of London. We had a large family, and my parents spent more time in debtor&#8217;s prison than free, so�things were very difficult.�

Mrs. Gainsley, who had taken a seat beside Shelton on the loveseat, handed him a glass of water and stroked his arm comfortingly as he continued. �I was the most fortunate of the lot. I became employed at the office of a lawyer, just as an errand-boy, later working at the front desk and keeping track of the accounts. I was able to work my way through school, with the help of my employer, and saved up enough to apply for college. At that point, school was all that I had, school and my job. I had lost track of my family. Even my twin brother, who had been by my side constantly from the day we were born�I haven&#8217;t seen him since we were 13. So when I started school, I made a solemn vow that I would devote myself fully to my studies and�� He smiled, embarrassed again, and looked down into his drink.

Mrs. Gainsley was visibly touched by the story. I had already known this story, as his former benefactor had been my old friend, but found it nonetheless endearing. Miss Howard looked a little amused. �What happened?� she demanded, not unkindly.

Shelton grinned. �Well, Miss Howard, a person has needs, as I&#8217;m sure you know. I saw some girls who attended Girton, Newnham, and Hughes, and there were plenty of ladies in town. As far as a final tally, well�I&#8217;m afraid I cannot provide you with the number.� Miss Howard hooted with laughter, while Mrs. Gainsley looked quaintly surprised. I smiled.

�Shelton, my boy, I think you will fit in quite nicely here.� I proceeded to explain the nature of my relationship with the sisters. Shelton did not seem entirely surprised.

�There are some�stories in the village that I have heard about what you do here at Wainwright Hall,� Shelton admitted. This did not surprise me in the least; since Emily&#8217;s disappearance, the Howard sisters&#8217; presence at Wainwright Hall had been under suspicion. I cared not about the rumors, nor did the sisters seem to mind, and so we carried on as before. �But if you don&#8217;t mind my asking�what happened to your wife?�

The question was not unexpected. I merely told Shelton enough to assure him that I had not killed my poor wife, she was indeed alive, and was abroad for an indeterminate amount of time. �I do miss her terribly,� I confessed in a moment of weakness. Mrs. Gainsley turned her concerned attention to me. �But my friends here comfort me so well. Shelton, would you like my whores to give you a proper welcome?�

It seemed that, in Shelton&#8217;s numerous sexual encounters in school, he did not have much experience with the use of restraints. Miss Howard was most willing to aid me in a demonstration. She set her cigar in the ashtray on my desk and quickly stripped naked. Shelton approached her hesitantly, and she drew him to her, placing his hands on her bare sides and kissing him sensually. 

I grinned knowingly at Mrs. Gainsley, who was flushing a bit (still so innocent, even after everything we&#8217;d done together!). �Will you get the rope from the closet, Beatrice?� I asked.

�Yes, Aaron.� She quickly followed my orders (such an obedient whore, just as Emily always was), and when she brought me the soft length of rope (how many times had I used this same rope on my dear wife?), I stood and joined Miss Howard and our guest. She already had his trousers very slightly pulled down, and was groping his cock (a fair size, and surprisingly, circumcised) teasingly. I ordered the whore to her knees, and she positioned herself with her thighs apart, her wrists joined behind her back. This slut always seemed to know what I wanted.

I handed the rope over to Shelton and watched him tie up my whore. His hands fumbled awkwardly, but his knots were expertly tied as he bound Miss Howard&#8217;s wrists and elbows behind her back. Limber as she was, these cruel bindings forced her head back slightly, and for a moment, her plump lips parted in surprise. 

Shelton did not fully unclothe himself (yet), but he did pull down his trousers enough to reveal the full length of his cock, and his smooth, almost perfectly rounded testicles. I watched, sitting beside my Beatrice on the loveseat, as Shelton pounded mercilessly into Miss Howard&#8217;s mouth. His cock was by no means enormous, but so rough was he that I heard Miss Howard gag at least twice. He had taken hold on the back of her head, forcing her head forward, and she moaned around his pumping cock at the strain.

 I was surprised, but not unpleased, by my partner&#8217;s brutality. Had he treated my wife so, I would have objected, but I felt that this was just what Miss Howard needed. I wondered if he and Miss Howard might have a little fun with a whip or riding crop some evening. Miss Howard had never permitted me to give her more than a rough beating on the ass with a paddle, but perhaps fumbling young Shelton could turn her. The idea so excited me that I pulled Mrs. Gainsley to me and kissed her roughly, quickly pulling off her gown and feeling her sweet, plump breasts, fingering her erect nipples, the skin baby smooth to the touch. I was tempted to lean down and suckle, and for a moment I imaged drinking from my Emily.

The reminder of my wife caused me to pause. Mrs. Gainsley touched my face with concern, and I gave her a forced smile, looking at the progress of our friends. Shelton was pounding even more roughly down Miss Howard&#8217;s throat, and let out more of a sigh than a grunt when he came, extracting his cock from the young lady. Miss Howard almost whimpered, and I grinned; for a moment, I could have sworn that an expression of helplessness crossed the wild whore&#8217;s face. I then altered my plans: Shelton was not for Mrs. Gainsley, but for Miss Howard. He would be the one to break that whore.

I did, however, allow Shelton to have Mrs. Gainsley&#8217;s ass that evening. She&#8217;d never given her ass to another gentleman, though she had allowed Alfonso to fuck her in her cunt numerous times. Both naked, we each bent a young lady over my desk. I kicked at Miss Howard&#8217;s ankles to force her legs further apart; across the desk, I watched Shelton as he carefully slid into Mrs. Gainsley, and she whimpered, putting her forehead against the desk, though Shelton did not thrust into her too roughly.

I did not keep pace, and poor Miss Howard got another pounding that evening. As I thrust into her smoothly (for that whore&#8217;s ass was by no means tight, not like her sister&#8217;s), I placed my hand on her back and pushed her down against the top of the desk, repeating the gesture, smiling as I watched her fat tits smash against the desktop roughly (and her own nipple clips, worn more for decoration than for any sort of pleasurable torment, dig ever more painfully into her). She squirmed helplessly beneath me.

I watched as Shelton, coming more quickly than I, knelt down and cleaned my whore&#8217;s ass with his tongue. Mrs. Gainsley, still leaning over the desk, propped on her elbows, cried out loud, and I imagined that Shelton&#8217;s tongue had found her lovely little clit. She looked up at me as I continued to fuck her sister, and I grinned at her. �Relax, Beatrice, does it feel good?� She nodded, shuddering slightly, moaning softly. �Enjoy it, my dear, you&#8217;re such a sweet girl.�

I grabbed Miss Howard by the back of the head, forcing her to stand up straight, her back pressed against my chest as I came. I nibbled on her neck and murmured, �You&#8217;re not so sweet, are you, Tatiana? But you still deserve to get yours.� As Miss Howard was already so turned on (and wet, soaking wet as I lapped at her greedily), she and her sister came at the same time. Miss Howard cried out in almost a low growl as she came, while Mrs. Gainsley let out more of a surprised, slightly pained cry. God, how I adored the sisters at that moment. Even after all the trouble they caused, I look back and remember that as being my favorite evening with them. Without Emily present, of course.

While Emily used to enjoy lounging around naked for a short time after playing, perhaps sharing the warmth and comfort of her body with one of the sisters or myself, after she was gone we all would dress hastily after playing. We did so, and the ladies joined us to finish smoking their cigars (Miss Howard, perching much more carefully on the edge of my desk). We did not talk much, simply enjoying the afterglow of our orgasms and the quality tobacco. The ladies bade us goodnight, and I walked with Shelton to the front doors, to wait on our carriage with him. Our driver would be taking him back to his boarding house alone.

�Singer,� Shelton said carefully (for I had insisted that my own partner in law not refer to me by my formal title), �I do believe that you are the luckiest of men.�

I sighed deeply. �So it would seem,� I said.

�Miss Howard�she is quite wild,� Shelton observed approvingly. �I have heard much talk of her in the village��

�I guarantee you, my boy, that all of it is true,� I said dully. �That, and more, I assure you.� I forced a smile (for I was dwelling on the bad luck that my poor dear Emily and I had been dealt). �Miss Howard is a very dear old friend. She is a very good friend to have�and I daresay, Shelton, she is quite eager to become a very good friend to you.�

�I would like to know her better,� Shelton said, almost shyly. My next smile was not forced.

�I care very deeply for my friend,� I said. �I love her, and her sister, very much. They were dear friends to my wife for years, and they take care of my children in her absence. I believe,� I said thoughtfully, �That Miss Howard would make someone a good wife, if she could have her ways tamed. And if I may say so, my boy, you showed a most firm hand with her this evening.�

�I had a feeling that she could handle it,� Shelton observed. 

�You read her well,� I said. As the carriage pulled round, I stepped off the porch with my partner and bid him farewell. �Be at the offices tomorrow promptly at 7:30,� I instructed. �I will be honest, my boy, there will be stressful times in our line of work. So please be assured that you are welcome at Wainwright Hall anytime to get what you need to unwind.�

My partner nodded goodbye, and I smiled as I walked back into the house. My Emily would have been proud of me, I was certain. In my own fumbling way, I was playing the matchmaker myself. And as the months passed, and Shelton and Miss Howard drew closer together, I understood the gratification that my wife had gotten from her well-meaning, meddlesome ways.


While getting Shelton into the routine at the office, I spent more time away from Wainwright Hall during the day than I ever had before. I found that the days passed more quickly than when I had been moping about at home, and the sting of missing Emily didn&#8217;t hurt quite so much when I was busy. For a time, I even fell into an almost comfortable routine: up early for breakfast (and a little pleasure from one of the sisters) before heading down to the office, visiting with clients or filling out paperwork for much of the morning. If I were to be in court (which has never been often, in the sort of law that I practice), that would take up much of the morning. If I were not, I could typically find time to spend at home in the afternoon, before returning to the offices in the evening and relieving Shelton of his duties before finishing up the day&#8217;s work on my own.

Shelton proved an eager partner, and most evenings, if I had to stay on past dark, he would stay with me and offer his assistance. He would join us at Wainwright Hall for dinner and playtime about once a week, and his preference for sexy Miss Howard was soon obvious. Needless to say, he was most delighted one evening when she suddenly arrived at our offices for a surprise visit.

She greeted Shelton flirtatiously, of course, though his cheeks did not flare up at her forward attentions anymore. At my encouragement, he was handling her with a firmer hand, and he had revealed to me just that afternoon that he intended to let her have the riding crop that evening. Having only a little work to finish, I encouraged them to go off to Wainwright Hall in the carriage.

�Don&#8217;t bother to send the driver back,� I added. �I am in the mood for a walk this evening.� I smiled at my friends as they left, but as soon as they were gone, I sat down at my desk and let out a heavy sigh. It was May 13th. The second birthday that my poor Emily had spent away from home. I had not even realized that it was Emily&#8217;s birthday until early that evening, so busy had I been that day. At one point, I had looked at the calendar on my desk, just glanced at it�and found myself thinking, My Emily turns 26 today.

I had been holding back tears since I realized. Now alone in my dark office, I laid down my head and cried, mourning my loss all over again. I had not received another letter from Emily. There was no sign of her�I didn&#8217;t know for sure if she was dead or alive. Though in my heart I knew. I didn&#8217;t believe that Mrs. Morrison, the damned bitch from hell, would do anything to truly harm her. Would she?

In a dark mood, I found that I could not focus enough to finish even the menial tasks that I had left to complete. In despair, I extinguished the lights, locked up the office, and headed home. It was a nice evening for a long walk. I remembered that the weather was always agreeable on Emily&#8217;s birthday. Never once did it rain; it was always sunny, with a comfortable breeze in the air. Now evening, the air was comfortably warm still, a perfect evening to have a drink on the patio�or to make love to your wife in the garden.

I was calm, though still unhappy, when I came upon Wainwright Hall. I found the sisters and Shelton in the parlor. Mrs. Gainsley stood to greet me, and I knew that she noticed my anguish. But I forced a smile. �The children are not in bed already?� I asked.

�They&#8217;re playing in the garden,� she said. �I was just about to gather them up and tuck them in.�

�I&#8217;ll do it tonight,� I said, and without another word, I went to the back of the house and called to the children from the back door. They were not playing far from the door, but it had grown so dark that I could only see their outlines as little Mina, now six, led Peter to the house gently by the hand. She was so very sweet to her little brother, not quite two and toddling with wobbling haste, that I was reminded again of her mother, and could not stop my eyes from filling with tears as I led the children into the house.

�Let&#8217;s go to bed, darlings,� I said affectionately, and took them each by a hand, leading them patiently to the stairs. I carried Peter, still holding Mina&#8217;s tiny hand as we made our way to the nursery. I changed Peter&#8217;s nappy skillfully (I did not often take on such chores, but even before Emily was gone, I would occasionally offer my assistance) before putting him into his bedclothes, while little independent Mina dressed herself. I tucked them into the large bed that they shared, and stooped to kiss their foreheads. 

�What&#8217;s the matter, Daddy?� Mina asked. She had noticed my anguish. Children are both intuitive and blunt, and I have always liked this about them.

�I am sad today, Mina,� I admitted softly. �Today is Mummy&#8217;s birthday.�

�I miss Mummy,� Mina said softly. Peter was silent during this exchange, watching us with wide eyes, and at that moment he resembled his mother more than his grandfather. I smiled at both of my children.

�I miss her, too, sweetheart,� I whispered. �And I&#8217;m very sorry that I haven&#8217;t talked about her more. Mummy will come home to us, and she&#8217;ll be very sad if her sweet children forget about her.� I picked up the small picture that sat on the children&#8217;s bedside table, the same picture of their mother that I had shown desperately to strangers in Barcelona. I showed it to them again. �Isn&#8217;t she beautiful?� I said. Mina nodded in silent agreement, and Peter continued to stare. �She loves you both so much,� I said, placing the picture in Mina&#8217;s hands. �She would do anything for you.�

Mina looked at the picture for a moment, before solemnly whispering, �Happy birthday, Mummy.�

�Happy birthday, Mummy,� Peter echoed uneasily. I smiled warmly at my children, and took the picture in my hands.

�Happy birthday, Emily,� I whispered, before placing the picture on the table again. �Goodnight, Emily. Goodnight, my darlings.�

�Goodnight, Daddy,� the children said, and I kissed them both again, extinguished the light, and left the room. For years after, I would have the children pay such reverence to their absent mother, sharing with them my pain, and the longing for her return. In time, Mina would almost grow bitter in her waiting, while poor Peter, rest his soul, would never live to see his deepest wish fulfilled, the wish that I had planted in his heart.

That evening, as Shelton whipped Miss Howard in my office, I sat back and watched. A naked Mrs. Gainsley perched beside me, and she rested her head on my shoulder. I stroked her hair absently. 

�You are distressed tonight, Aaron?� she asked softly. Besides my sullen mood, my cock was soft, even as I watched Miss Howard receive the punishment that I&#8217;d craved to administer myself. I nodded silently, and Mrs. Gainsley kissed my cheek. �I never wanted to see you this way, Aaron.�

I placed a gentle hand on Mrs. Gainsley&#8217;s thigh. �Shall we leave our friends alone for a time?� I asked. Mrs. Gainsley stared at me in surprise, glancing briefly at her sister, who was moaning (more with longing than in pain) into her makeshift gag (Shelton&#8217;s almost embarrassingly tattered handkerchief, wadded up and shoved unceremoniously between her plump lips) as Shelton took a short break from punishing her to rub her clit. She turned back to me, nodding uncertainly.

I took her by the hand and led her back to the parlor. I did not have her dress or even cover up her nakedness; by now, the servants were quite privy to our sexual escapades, and though they had no desire to participate, they had assured me of their silence when it came to the activities in our home. I believed them well enough, and did not suspect any of them to have any part of Emily&#8217;s disappearance as Mrs. Morrison&#8217;s damned coconspirator after I had questioned them. Oh, no; because Emily had always had the final word in servants&#8217; pay (the funds coming from her household account, of course), they had always been paid more than generously, enough to buy their loyalty. Having it all out in the open merely allowed us to practice less discretion.

However, to ensure our privacy, I closed the doors to the parlor. I motioned for Mrs. Gainsley to take a seat on the couch. �Care for another drink?� I asked, going to the drink cart. Without waiting for a reply, I poured two glasses of red wine. Mrs. Gainsley was lounging comfortably on the couch, and I realized that she&#8217;d never before been so relaxed around me in her nakedness. In spite of my low spirits, I was quite turned on.

She sat up to take her glass. �Aaron,� she said gently, �You may tell me anything that is troubling you.�

Suddenly, I was angry�at Mrs. Gainsley and Miss Howard both. �Do you not realize, my dear Beatrice, what day it is today?�

She was startled by my sudden anger, and I could tell that she now wished to be clothed. I did not give her the opportunity to answer. �How could you forget Emily&#8217;s birthday? She always remembered yours, and your sister&#8217;s. She always had such lovely little surprises for you on your birthday, and you forgot��

�Oh, Aaron!� Mrs. Gainsley gasped, clasping her hands over her mouth. She looked mortified. �Oh, I&#8217;m so sorry, Aaron, I truly did not��

�No,� I said quietly, regretting my sudden outburst. �I&#8217;m sorry, Beatrice. But it is weighing heavily on my mind today.�

�If I&#8217;d had any idea�� Mrs. Gainsley was flushed. Timidly, she stood and took me by the hand. �I suppose I am not as thoughtful as our dear Lady Emily.�

�That was not fair for me to say,� I admitted. I did not wish to be rude to my dearest friend. For Mrs. Gainsley had done so much for me since Emily&#8217;s kidnapping. Even now, after everything that has come to light, I cannot look back without feeling tremendous gratitude to my dear Beatrice. She had already done so much for me�and she would do so much more. 

�Aaron,� Mrs. Gainsley said eventually, �I do feel badly for being so thoughtless. Do you�do you wish to punish me for it?�

I nearly laughed. She asked so earnestly, with a touch of apprehension in her voice. But only a touch�how much punishment would this soft, still-inexperienced girl take? But at that moment, even the thought of bending her over my knee and reddening her ass with my merciless hand did not excite me. I instead sat heavily on the couch and made a confession to Mrs. Gainsley.

�Eight years ago,� I said somberly, �To this very night, I raped Emily.� I proceeded to tell her the story of how we became lovers. I had never shared the details of it all to anyone, and by the look of surprise on Mrs. Gainsley&#8217;s face, I could see that she had not read it in Emily&#8217;s diary (and since Emily&#8217;s disappearance, I had kept her diary locked in the desk in my office). �You may think I am a monster for what I did to her�after I did that, what other choice did she have but to marry me?� And I confessed to her a fear that had always lurked deep in my heart, one that I had never spoken to my Emily. �I do wonder, Beatrice, if she only married me because she felt she could do nothing else.�

�Oh, no, Aaron!� And Mrs. Gainsley fell all over herself, reassuring me that Emily had loved me, she had been devoted to me, had worshipped me, and who could blame her? I smiled at Mrs. Gainsley, and I had a feeling that she was speaking from her own heart. But with regards to my wife, I knew what she said to be true. I have never allowed myself to doubt for long that Emily and I were always meant to be together. However I might have felt about any other woman, at any other time�she was always my one. My only one. And thinking on it at that moment, it only made the pain of losing her worse.

Talking about it was not helping, so what else could I do but fuck Mrs. Gainsley, so naked and willing in the parlor? I fetched rope (tools of restraint were kept in nearly every room of Wainwright Hall, except the children&#8217;s nursery), and tied her to the couch; her wrists were bound, her arms stretching back over one arm of the large couch, the other ends of the rope wrapped around the sturdy legs. Her legs were forced up and back, her ankles tied to her wrists, her body folded double. She moaned at the strain; I&#8217;d never tied Mrs. Gainsley in such a harsh position before. But she was willing to allow me to be rough with her that evening, and I certainly took advantage of her hospitality.

As I fucked her and fingered her asshole, I thought again of my limber Emily, always willing to try new positions in our play, allowing me to bend and stretch and punish her body. My sweet little toy. I felt hot, turned on but enraged, as I fucked Mrs. Gainsley, and I ceased fingering her ass, instead slapping her ass cheeks enthusiastically, relishing in her little cries of pain. �That&#8217;s right, whore,� I snarled to her, as I once had to my dear wife, �You are my whore, you fat little slut, you want me to hurt you.�

�Oh, Aaron,� Mrs. Gainsley moaned, and I knew that she did not like the dirty talk, not as my Emily had. I encouraged her to play along.

�Tell me you love this, whore,� I demanded through clenched teeth, pounding into her. I slapped her ass hard enough to leave a deep red mark. �Tell me that you need this, Beatrice, say it.�

�Oh, God, Aaron, I love you!� she cried as we both came. As it turns out, she had loved it, even though she would not submit to rough bondage all the time. 

And so, for a time I was distracted from my sorrow. I untied Mrs. Gainsley, and we sat together for a short while on the couch. I closed my eyes and held her close, burying my face in her hair, and we did not speak. I heard her sigh softly, resting her head against my chest. I could never deny that I loved Mrs. Gainsley. It filled me with no small amount of guilt that I loved her almost as much as I loved Emily. But not as much. Not quite. 

We decided to join Shelton and Miss Howard in the office yet again, and when we found them, I could not resist smiling. Shelton was relaxing in one of the armchairs; Miss Howard, smiling contently, sat comfortably on the floor between his legs, resting her cheek on his thigh. In the past few weeks, I had been pondering the idea of Shelton marrying Miss Howard. Neither of them had mentioned such a plan to me, but I was delighted to see it so clearly: they loved each other. And they were so good together. 

We all settled in together, now more comfortable in our nakedness, and though we did not play for the rest of the evening (both ladies thoroughly exhausted from their respective punishments), we enjoyed each other&#8217;s company. As I went to bed alone that night, I would think, with more guilt, that I was having such fun without poor Emily. 

The longing for her that I had at night, alone in our bed, is unspeakable. 


To further distract myself from thoughts of Emily, I set about putting the idea of marriage into my friends&#8217; heads. I started with Miss Howard. A week after Emily&#8217;s birthday, I was working at home on a lovely afternoon. I called Miss Howard to my office, and she came to me, closing the door behind her with a wicked little smile on her face.

�I did not call you in for playtime,� I said, motioning for her to sit in the armchair. She looked curious but amused (she is always amused when I try to speak to her in a serious tone). �Tatiana, you and I have not really had the opportunity to discuss your thoughts on Mr. Shelton.�

Her face lit up at the mention of her favorite new playmate�she almost seemed to flush. �Aaron, you know that I like Mr. Shelton very much,� she said.

I nodded. �Of course. I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;d allow him to subordinate you if you did not.�

Her flush was no illusion now. �I am starting to understand Lady Emily&#8217;s desires. I used to find her tastes for punishment to be a bit�peculiar. But he�Mr. Shelton�he does something to me.�

�It&#8217;s indescribable,� I murmured, something that Emily had written in her diary about her feelings toward me, when our wicked little affair had started. Miss Howard nodded in agreement. �Would you marry Mr. Shelton?� I asked gently.

Miss Howard frowned slightly. �You will think I am awful��

�Tell me, Tatiana,� I said. �You are my friend, and you may be perfectly candid with me.�

�I have imagined being his wife,� she confessed. �I do�I do believe that I love him, Aaron. But he�well, he lives in a boarding house.�

I kept my tone neutral. �You would not marry him because he does not have family money?�

�It is not quite that,� she said. �You know me, Aaron. You know that I do not disregard a man if he is not wealthy.�

�But,� I said, �Sleeping with a man and marrying a man are two very different things. Especially to you, Tatiana.� 

She smiled a bit at that. �I do not want much,� she said. �I can take or leave the fineries of life�my interests are much more carnal, you know.�

�I do.�

�Eventually,� she said, �I would want children.� She gave me a sudden, anxious look. �Do you think I could be a good mother, Aaron?�

Never at any other moment did Miss Howard remind me of my Emily. But her question took me back to that cloudy day, when Emily announced her first pregnancy. She had anxiously implored me if I thought she would be a good mother, and I had given her my reassurances. And she had certainly proven those to be true. 

Before Miss Howard&#8217;s coming to Wainwright Hall, I would have never imagined her to have maternal instincts. It seems strange to me, looking back on it, that I, of all people, would have the idea that a woman with whorish desires could not possibly be a caring nurturer of children. Miss Howard had disproved this idea. She was never anything but loving and kindly to the children, and if either of them happened to prefer their Auntie Bea to their Auntie Ana, it was only because Mrs. Gainsley was so insistent in caring for all of the children&#8217;s little needs. Miss Howard allowed her sister to do this not out of laziness, but out of kindness, knowing how much her sister needed it. I could not think of anyone more ferociously loyal to her family and loved ones than Miss Howard. I told her this that afternoon in my office, and she beamed with pleasure. I was surprised by this; out of all of my whores, Miss Howard had never been one to need my reassurance, such a swaggering slut she was.

�I assure you, Miss Howard, that Mr. Shelton receives a most generous salary,� I said. �I am certain that, if you were to wed and bear a child, he would have the means to purchase a lovely home for your family.�

�I never imagined wanting to be a housewife,� Miss Howard said with a small giggle, but she frowned again. �I never imagined that any man would want to marry a woman like me.�

�You are a wild whore,� I agreed, and she gave me a wry smiling, knowing that I meant so with affection. �But Mr. Shelton delights in the idea of taming you.�

�Taming me?� Miss Howard laughed heartily, and was much herself again. �I may become a good little wife, but I will never quite be tame.� And to prove it, she came to my side of the desk and began to rub my cock through my trousers. And, well�we had our playtime that afternoon, after all.

I approached the subject with Shelton in a more roundabout way the following morning at our offices. �Shelton,� I said, �Have you considered investing any of your salary into real estate? Perhaps purchasing a fine home for yourself in the area?�

He confessed that he&#8217;d had a look at some houses in the village that were available, but that he was not currently in a situation that would allow him to make a purchase. �But surely your expenses at the boarding house are not so high,� I insisted. 

�I live quite frugally,� Shelton admitted. �But my personal expenses are not the only ones to consider.�

I did not want to pry and alienate my partner, but with some gentle prodding, he filled me in on the details. Since leaving school (the expenses of which were covered by his former benefactor, my old friend), he had been able to get in contact with a few of his brothers and sisters, all of whom lived still in London. �Most of my salary has been going to their care,� he confessed. �And you have paid me so generously that they now live in relative comfort. Five of them share a fair-sized place in a boarding house, and my brothers are now in school. The only ones I haven&#8217;t been able to support are my twin brother and youngest sister, whom I haven&#8217;t been able to contact.�

The oldest of the orphaned siblings was only 18. Shelton expressed a desire to send his two brothers to university, so that they might have the same opportunities as he, and to set his three sisters up with enough money to attract desirable marriage prospects. With the money he was making, his plans were by no means grandiose. However, he would be unable to provide himself with more than the base necessities.

I had an idea. Throughout Emily&#8217;s absence, I had been faithfully continuing the work of the Sir Peter Wainwright Foundation, taking in donations and distributing funds to various orphanages and organizations for children, keeping very careful track of all the records so that Emily would be up-to-date on her pet project when she returned. Surely the Shelton children could benefit from Emily&#8217;s generosity, and I was convinced that, if she were there, she would have come up with the idea herself.

I explained my intentions to Shelton. He was more than a little hesitant to take �charity� from his partner, but I was insistent. �I want to help you to be well-established,� I said. �You came out here to have a simple country life, with all that it entails: a wife, children, a nice little home.�

I did not mention Miss Howard by name that day, but Shelton seemed to catch my meaning. But even after the funds were distributed to the Shelton children (allowing them to purchase a small home of their own, and to put aside trust funds for the children), no more mention was made of marriage between Miss Howard and Shelton for a few weeks. I began to fear that Shelton had no intention of marrying her, and that her worst fear would be realized: she was too much of a whore to marry. I seethed at the hypocrisy of this double-standard on behalf of women; a man may do whatever he pleases, but if a woman has any sort of sexual affair outside of the bonds of marriage, she is a pariah. So upset was I that I became rather cold toward my partner. 

But one summer afternoon, as I worked out of home, I glanced up from my work to see Shelton in the doorway. �Shelton, my dear man,� I said with forced enthusiasm, �I thought I had given you the day off.�

�I am not here for business,� he said. �Not quite. May I close the door?�

�Please,� I said. I stood to pour my partner a cold brandy, though I resumed my place behind the desk, keeping a formal distance between us. His tone matched the ambiance that I created.

�I was not certain how to go about this,� he said nervously. �Her father is deceased, but she has never wed, and she has been living under your care��

�Employ,� I corrected, knowing who &#8216;she&#8217; was. I nodded for him to continue.

�I felt it only right,� he said, �That I ask your permission. I�well, I would like to ask for Miss Howard&#8217;s hand in marriage.�

�Of course,� I said kindly, and he instantly relaxed. �I was beginning to worry that I had read you wrong, Shelton. I thought perhaps that you did not view Miss Howard as the marrying kind.�

�I think that marriage is just what she needs,� Shelton said. �She told me once that she&#8217;s always felt aimless, untethered. Thanks to you, I am able to provide her with security and purpose. I signed the deed to the large stone cottage near the woods.�

I knew the place. Emily had admired it as a young child, enchanted by the way that the vines crept around the stone walls, and the wild flowers that grew around the property. �It&#8217;s like something out of a fairytale!� she&#8217;s once declared, and I&#8217;d found that most charming. 

I could never escape from Emily. Memories of her crept on me at the most unexpected times, wrapping themselves like vines around my throat, and for only a moment, rendering me speechless, forgetting what I had been doing. Shelton must have noticed my momentary confusion, because he rushed on. �It&#8217;s a fair-sized place, quite sprawling, more than a cottage really.�

�Yes,� I said, recovering myself. I forced a smile. �I&#8217;m sure that Miss Howard will be most pleased. When will you ask her?�

�This very afternoon, if I may,� he said. I led Shelton to the parlor, and left him there to seek out Miss Howard. I found the sisters alone on the patio, the children in the nursery having their naps. As soon as I announced that Mr. Shelton was waiting in the parlor, Miss Howard sprang up. 

�Oh, my hair is a fright!� she cried, rushing inside (probably to find the nearest lavatory before presenting herself to her beau). Grinning, I took a chair beside Mrs. Gainsley.

�It will soon be just the two of us,� I said. �Shelton is about to ask for your sister&#8217;s hand in marriage.�

A part of me was surprised with how thrilled Mrs. Gainsley was. She was not putting on an act to cover any sort of resentment or jealousy on her part; on the contrary, she was most pleased with this turn of events. �I always dreamed that Tatiana would marry a good man, and I don&#8217;t believe she could have done any better. Oh, Aaron,� she gushed, �This is your work. You brought Mr. Shelton into our lives.� She had turned the whole thing around to offer me praise, and though I do not embarrass easily, I flushed.

�Your sister is a charming young lady,� I said insistently. �And Mr. Shelton was smart enough to know a good lady when he saw her.�

�She is good,� Mrs. Gainsley agreed, though her voice was faint. �Aaron,� she said, �Does Mr. Shelton know about�?�

I instantly knew what she was referring to. �I would think not,� I said, �Not unless Tatiana has chosen to tell him. I do not know why she would do so. I believe that it will remain our secret, Mrs. Gainsley.�

I was struck with a sudden thought. It was not just our secret, not just between me and my wife and the sisters. Mrs. Morrison knew as well. I had not been the one to tell her, nor had Emily. Determined, I brought the question up for the first and only time. �Mrs. Gainsley,� I said quietly, �Do you know how Mrs. Morrison came to find out about�what happened?�

Mrs. Gainsley swallowed hard, and before she&#8217;d even made her confession, I knew. �I&#8217;m sorry, Aaron,� she said quietly. �It�it had been on my mind that afternoon, for some reason. I believe that it was Maxwell&#8217;s birthday,� she added, and I was reminded of my melancholy on Emily&#8217;s last birthday. �And, well�I was still feeling resentful about how the secret had been kept from me. I am no longer upset by it,� she added hastily, �No, if anything, I am grateful to you�and to Lady Emily�for being so kind to my sister. But that day, she�Mrs. Morrison�she manipulated me, Aaron. I&#8217;m so terribly sorry, I was drunk and I thought nothing of letting her in on it, I thought she was a dear friend to Lady Emily and I had no idea that she would��

She was so panicked that I struggled to get her to calm down. Though I was seething silently, I knew that becoming angry would do no good. Mrs. Morrison had her information�there was no changing that. And Mrs. Gainsley, like Emily, was trusting and na�ve. I decided to let the matter go, and we did not discuss Mrs. Gainsley&#8217;s accidental betrayal again.

Miss Howard and Mr. Shelton were married that autumn on the grounds of Wainwright Hall. Mrs. Howard came in from London with some family members to attend the ceremony, and many of our friends and neighbors came as well. In fact, it was the social event of the season, the first time we&#8217;d had guests in Wainwright Hall (other than Shelton himself) since Emily&#8217;s disappearance. 

Though Mrs. Shelton no longer resided at Wainwright Hall, she was still a frequent visitor, still coming to spend the day with her sister and the children. There was also an unspoken agreement, between myself and Shelton, that I was still permitted access to his wife, so our playtime continued much as it had before. Shelton joined us for dinner more often than ever, and when he and his wife would leave after some playtime (Shelton enjoying the use of his sister-in-law as well), Mrs. Gainsley and I would find ourselves alone again. 

It was two years after her sister&#8217;s marriage that I allowed Mrs. Gainsley to join me in the bedchamber that I had once shared exclusively with my wife. As much as the guilt pained me, the lonely nights had been worse. In the end, when everything came to light, it would be clear that all of us, even my pretty, sweet Emily, were guilty of betrayal in some form. 
























Lady Emily&#8217;s Letters

16 November, 18&#8212;

My dearest sir,

I have not written in quite some time, and though I am ashamed of this, do not take it to mean that I have not been thinking of you. When I have a moment to myself (which is rare anymore, as I will explain), I cannot stop myself from thinking of you, and our children, and our home. I recently begged Lydia to give me some news of Wainwright Hall. I know that she has been in touch with her coconspirator; I do not know how often, and I still do not have any clues as to who the traitor may be. 

Without revealing the villain&#8217;s identity, Lydia told me of some happy news, that our dear Miss Howard has wed. Glad as I am for her (though surprised, sir, quite surprised; I never thought that Miss Howard ever desired to be a wife!), I asked, �And what of my family?�

�Your husband and children are healthy and well,� Lydia said, rather flippantly, and would say no more on the subject. It was enough to give me the relief that I have needed, so I am able to carry on with one less trouble on my mind. I do hope that what Lydia claims is so, and that you and our children are well, and happy. Even without me, I hope you are all happy.

Lydia&#8217;s business venture has kept me quite busy. We reside and run our business (officially a �social club,� but I will give you the details on our many specialty services) in a handsome Victorian-style house, three floors. Though it is located in a moderately busy section of San Francisco (with an enormous new bank located just a few blocks away), the property is surrounded by a tall wrought-iron fence, and the front yard is so filled with trees that the house can hardly be viewed from the street.

The trees are necessary to ensure privacy. Our house (called &#8216;Lydie Smithwick&#8217;s Place&#8217; by our clients, as Lydia, for obvious reasons, goes by her first married name) is also the home to five young ladies who are under Lydia&#8217;s employ. The simplest way to put it, sir, is that these girls are prostitutes, and their various talents for giving or receiving pleasure and pain keep the bills paid and food on our table.

 I wish to note that I am not one of Lydia&#8217;s whores. You may say that I am more of a business manager. As I began in New York with Lydia&#8217;s personal finances, I keep books for the house, and I personally take care of all of the expenses: various bills, groceries, payment to the employees, police bribes.

Oh, yes! Imagine my fear, sir, when two San Francisco police officers first showed on our doorstep. The house had been open but a month; only three of the girls worked there at that point. Lydia was surprising cool. She knew that they only sought to line their pockets, and did not hesitate to smilingly hand over a handsome amount from the vault. She was entertaining a group of men in the large parlor (the d�cor is ghastly, sir, all soft pinks and silk and enormous pillows�you would certainly laugh, sir, but it is no longer amusing to me), wearing only a black corset under her open silk robe, with high-heeled shoes. I was a stark contrast in a more conservative dress. I find it necessary to take on a stern, almost schoolmarmish appearance, so that the drunken clients may not confuse me with one of the girls-for-hire. Not that this has stopped some of them giving me their attentions. I am interested in none of them.

I am not without my sexual urges, sir, and Lydia gives me more attention than I need to be satisfied. My satisfaction is mixed with terrible guilt, of course, sir, and for the longest time I have been terribly confused. But I think you will understand�I hope you will understand�that though my love for you is unwavering, I do have my physical desires. Of course I know you do not begrudge me this, though I do belong to you, but even your imagined forgiveness is of little comfort to me. And yet�

In the presence of the employees and the clients, Lydia always treats me as she did in public. She addresses me as �Emily,� and in front of the girls, I call her �Mrs. Smithwick.� The girls call me �Mrs. Singer,� though I do not wish to begin naming the ugly names that they call Lydia behind her back. They are not fond of their madam, who seems to save all of her kindness for the paying clients (and for me, of course). She is quite rude to them, at best, and almost abusive at worst. Under my influence, she does not treat them as badly as she might if I were not present. The girls view me as a protector, a confidante, and though I did not strive for their affections, I do treat them with kindness, if I am somewhat distant.

In spite of myself, sir, I have grown fond of these girls. They are no playmates of mine (except for an incident with Natasha, which I will recount to you in the detail that you deserve), though they are all attractive girls, in their own right. I should note, sir, that around here, people do not like to discuss their pasts. It is considered to be quite rude to question a person about family or former occupations, a social rule that Lydia in particular has taken quite a liking to. Yet all of these girls, one by one, have shared with me their stories. You might imagine, sir, that their lives must have been quite wretched for them to have come to work in such a place as ours, and you would be most correct.

Nancy and Maggie are, as they might put it, �skinny little white girls� from Missouri. They came together from a small town along the Mississippi river, and are quite uneducated and poor (though they are now some of the best paid whores in San Francisco). Lydia often scolds them for walking about the first level or in the yard without shoes, but as Nancy explained to me, �For the longest time, we didn&#8217;t have no shoes to wear at all.�

The girls claim to be cousins, and while this may be so (they do bear some resemblance to one another, with the same long build, and the same long blonde hair and smattering of freckles below their eyes), I know them also to be lovers. They do not keep this a secret among the other girls, and how could they? The five young ladies stay on the third floor, in the rooms that once served as servants&#8217; quarters, so I don&#8217;t imagine that their private activities would go unnoticed.

They both were not unfamiliar with the sort of master-slave games that Lydie&#8217;s Place specializes in. Nancy, the more talkative of the two, most often serves the submissive clients, and though she is always gentle with the meek Maggie (who was abused terribly by the man who was supposed to be her guardian�her story makes me ever the more grateful that I&#8217;ve always had you, sir), I have witnessed Nancy treat some high-paying clients with startling brutality, as though she were unleashing her rage upon them. Well�these men enjoy it, they pay more, and everyone gets what they need from the bargain, I suppose. Nancy takes no real pleasure in it, slumping down beside me in the office in exhaustion after such an encounter with a client, too weary even to move.

Maggie, shy as she is (particularly around Lydia; she practically cowers whenever she comes into a room), is more than willing to satisfy the needs of clients who enjoy abusing and tormenting her. I worried (and still do) about leaving her alone with some crazed, drunken man in one of the second floor rooms, or in the basement &#8216;dungeon,&#8217; and having the client lose control and really do something to harm her. But Lydia laughed off my concerns. �If you are worried about it, my pet, why don&#8217;t you watch over these sessions yourself?� She is always trying to get me to participate, even in some small way. There is one client who pays double just to have me watch Lydia give him a beating, but I only sit solemnly and watch, no longer impressed with Lydia&#8217;s power. 

I did witness Maggie with one of the clients once, in stealth. I hid in a closet in an upper room, where I knew Maggie would be bringing a man. As I watched the fat banker bend her over the back of a chair and beat her on the ass with his belt, I watched Maggie&#8217;s face. It was clear that she actually enjoyed what he was doing to her, much the way that I enjoyed taking punishment from you. So I do try not to worry about her so.

There is one other girl who plays the submissive role in our group. That would be the aforementioned Natasha, who is a beautiful Native American woman. She told me that she is of the Dine tribe, and that when she was very young, there had been much violence between her people and white soldiers. She and her mother had fled to San Francisco with a missionary group, but when her mother died, Natasha had started working at a brothel nearby, and had come to work for us for more money. 

Natasha explained to me why so many of the clients love to dominate her. �It&#8217;s the fantasy of conquest, and with me, they feel that they are not just conquering a woman, but an entire people.� It makes her smile when she says this, because in the end, she feels like she&#8217;s really the one in control. She truly is a powerful woman, with striking features. Her brown skin is beautiful, and her long, straight hair is so black that it almost looks blue in the sun. 

Natasha came to work for us after we had been open for a few months, so she has been with us for about a year now. It was a few months ago that she and I had our little encounter, and though we are still friendly, there is tension between us, and I am afraid that I am to blame for this. But before I tell all, I must describe the other �girls� and employees of our brothel.

Amalia and Jiao (though Lydia forces her to go by �June,� I address her by her proper name) are mostly dominant whores. They are closer to my own age, but I still lump them together with the younger ladies and call them �girls.� They&#8217;re both small, but are capable of satisfying the needs of the wealthy clients who crave being controlled. Jiao is especially popular with the handful of Chinese businessmen who frequent the place. Amalia, a sweet-tempered Mexican girl who was raised in a family of migrant workers, turns on the clients with her lovely accent and flirtatious mannerisms, but in the &#8216;dungeon&#8217; or the bedrooms, she is quite voracious. She&#8217;s so popular that I do believe Lydia is jealous of her.

However, Lydia is quite proud of the diversity in her place. �Our own American smelting pot,� she recently joked, to quote Emerson. �Something for every taste�as long as they can pay.� And pay they do, sir, and I am quite busy keeping the books, and�well, the rest.

There was some trouble, in the first couple of months, with a couple of clients who tried to skip out on paying their tabs. I almost got into a scrap myself, sir, though I believe that you would be proud of the way that I handled myself. I approached one client as he was leaving (after having his way with Maggie), holding up the written charges that he&#8217;d accumulated over five weeks. He was a regular at the place, and he had not only racked up quite a charge for �services rendered,� but a considerable bill for drinks consumed as well (Lydia serves as the �bartender� herself). �I am calling your tab, Mr. Lynch,� I said as the red-faced Irishman made for the door.

He barely glanced at the bill, and he did not take it. �I will have to pay when I return on Friday,� he said quickly. I dared to grab his arm to stay him.

�Sir,� I said, calmly but sternly, �You gave the same excuse on your last visit. The time has come to pay up, or you will not be welcome to return.�

He grew angry and wretched his arm away. He called me all sorts of ugly names, which I do not wish to recount here. Such verbal abuse would have once reduced me to tears, sir, as you have always thought me to be a delicate thing. I am hardened a little by my experiences, sir, and though I trembled in indignation, I did not cry or shout.

I was afraid, sir, that the large man would hit me. He was quite drunk. I did not know how capable he was of making his payment. Though he was a wealthy businessman, he owed more gambling debts than he did to our place. I insisted that he leave and not return without the full payment in cash, and I was fortunate that, as he made to strike me, a couple of clients intervened, hearing his cursing from the parlor.

Lydia came up behind them, and as the clients threw the man out of the door, she wrapped me in a tight embrace. �Poor pet,� she murmured softly, so that the girls and clients, watching with curious eyes from the now-open parlor, could not hear. �You needn&#8217;t worry about collecting payments, dear. We are doing quite well.�

�But these men must pay,� I insisted. �If we allow them to walk out on their tabs, we will go under.� We were only beginning to be established, and though our �specialty services� brought in more money than most well established whorehouses in town, we had many expenses. And I always insisted that our girls be reasonably paid. 

One of the clients who threw out the troublemaker suggested that we hire a strong-arm, a man who would ensure the protection of the house, girls, and money, and I found this to be an agreeable idea. I am not entirely sure how word of our need got around, but two days later, in the late morning, a young man arrived at our door. I was the only one up and about at that time, save the maid Mary who was busily cleaning the mess in the second floor rooms from the previous night&#8217;s debauchery. 

Lydia was resting in the room that we shared on the first floor, connected to the house only through our office, our little haven away from the rest of the house&#8217;s activities. She is in the habit of sleeping late after a night of �business,� and she does not like that I rise early. I am glad that she does not (usually) tie me down and force me to stay by her side; as a matter of fact, sir, it is morning now as I write this, and I am the only one awake on the property. Mornings are my favorite and least favorite times, both for the reason that it allows me time to think. 

I answered the knock at the door, and found the young man. I do blush to admit to you, sir, that he is most handsome. Almost adorable in a way, with a cherubic face, but a strong body. He smiled politely, and addressed me in a London accent. �You must be Mrs. Singer?� he asked. �I hear that you are looking for security here?�

The fact alone that he was from our home country made me invite him in quickly. �I would invite you into the parlor, but it has not been cleaned since last night,� I explained as I led him to the surprisingly small dining room. We do not often serve food to our �guests,� but every once in a while Lydia will be in the mood for a large party, and will have food catered to the place in the early afternoon, having it spread out like a buffet for the clients (the girls are not allowed to have any while they are �working�). But that sunny morning, it was bare, and he sat and I offered him a drink. He declined and we sat and talked for quite some time.

His name is Joseph. Everyone calls him Joe but I. He was a poor young man from London, orphaned as a boy (you know my feelings toward fellow orphans, and at that moment I decided to hire him). His siblings had been separated, his youngest sister sent to live with a moderately wealthy family. He kept close tabs on the young girl, and when he became convinced that she was being abused by her caretakers, he was determined to protect her. He learned that they were planning a trip to America, and his little sister Alice, only seven at the time, would be going along.

Joseph was frantic with worry about how he would watch over his sister, for he only worked odd jobs for the owner of a local pub, and had some of his pay docked for the use of the back storage room for his home. But he managed to secure passage on the same boat on which his sister would be traveling�as an employee. He worked below the decks, rarely coming up before dark, but he was still comforted in knowing that his sister was on the same ship. When the ship arrived in New York, he&#8217;d gotten his pay and rushed away with only his few possessions, and managed to find his sister in the crowd. He followed closely, and when the dreadful guardians were distracted, he took his sister&#8217;s hand and led her away in the crowd, never to see those people again.

I found his story to be poignant, but I was suspicious of this tale of kidnapping. �Where is your sister now?� I asked sharply.

�Why, she&#8217;s right outside, waiting for me,� Joseph said. 

�I should like to meet this girl,� I said. �No, no�she needn&#8217;t come inside. I will come out with you.� I did not want to expose a young girl to the influences of our house.

She was waiting outside of the wrought iron gate. The dark-haired, dark-eyed girl is quite sweet, a little shy, but very polite. She had been traveling with her brother for the past four years. He worked very hard to take care of her and protect her, �She&#8217;s a bright girl,� Joseph said as his sister flushed. �I want to settle down and allow her to go to school.� They&#8217;d only just arrived in San Francisco, after spending a little more than a year traveling with a camp of migrant workers (Alice attending the half-hearted schools in place for these children while Joseph worked all day in various fields). Joseph did not want his sister to come of age in such places.

�And do you think that this place is good for a young girl?� I asked carefully. But I was determined to hire them. I had an idea, and I led them both to the back of the property, showing them the guest cottage in the back. �It has not been cleaned out properly, I&#8217;m afraid,� I said, showing them around. �But if you make it habitable yourselves, you are welcome to it.� Alice could come through the back door to the kitchen for her meals, and would not be overly exposed to the activities in the place, and that&#8217;s exactly how her arrangement has worked.

A couple of the girls, upon learning of this arrangement, grumbled, for they had admired the cottage when they&#8217;d arrived. But I had extended to them the same offer, and they instead chose the lazy comfort of the servants&#8217; quarters. To maintain peace, it was decided that Joseph, with Alice&#8217;s help, would also tend to the gardening on the grounds. A beautiful garden once grew in the back, around the cottage, but when we&#8217;d arrived it was overgrown with weeds, and since the clients would not be served in the garden, Lydia did not bother to invest in having it cleared out. I made some half-hearted attempts at it in the first few months myself, sir, but I am lacking in the skill. I blame you in this regard, for you never forced me to work or complete any household duties, so my efforts were most useless. (I only jest, sir, and love you ever the more for allowing me a childhood of comfort).

Joseph is well-liked by the girls, and even Lydia favors him, though she was annoyed at first by my hiring him without consulting her. �You dragged me out here and expect me to keep track of the expenses for your business,� I snapped at her in private. �Therefore, I have the authority to make such decisions.� Lydia was shocked by my audacity, but she let it go, and Joseph has fit in quite well. Because the place is never overly crowded, except when large parties are thrown, it is not often that he has to break up fights. His main duties involve presenting the clients with their tabs (and they do not dare refuse to pay him�sweet as he is, his physique is quite intimidating) and �escorting� any clients to the door that have become too belligerent in their drunkenness. If Lydia had the good sense to stop serving them drinks past a certain point, this would not be necessary. When Joseph is not busy, he and I talk together in the office. 

I must admit, sir, that I do like Joseph quite a bit. As far as I can tell, the boy is most monk-like in his sexual activities. He is friendly with the girls, joking with them. With me, he was overly polite at first, but over time we have become good friends. I would not feel that I was being entirely truthful if I did not admit, sir, that I am attracted to him. But our relationship has never been anything more than friendly, and I know that he is not involved with any of the girls (though Amalia especially has her sights on him). He spends much of his time working, taking care of his sister, working in the garden (which has been restored beyond its former glory, I believe), and painting. You would not tell by looking at him, but he is an artist, and quite a talented one at that. He painted the obscenely huge portrait of Lydia that currently hangs in the parlor, and has been working on portraits of the other girls as well.

Though Lydia mostly ignores the girl, I have become close with young Alice as well. Her brother is quite strict with her with regards to her schoolwork, and she rarely goes out and about with children her own age. On Sunday mornings, she joins me for church. I attend services at a nearby Catholic chapel, a small building with a congregation comprised mostly of Mexicans. There are no Anglican churches in the area, and though I tried out a couple of Protestant ones, I was not well received. All of us associated with any of the brothels have a bad reputation among the �good� ladies in town (though they are few and far between), and the Mexican chapel, recommended to me by Amalia, is the only one that will receive me. Well, damn the hypocrites, anyway. The minister of the first Protestant church that rejected me is a frequent client at our place. If the Mexican Catholics continue to accept me in their congregation, then they will continue to receive my generous donations each week (and I make sure to hand them the money that I had received from the Protestant minister the night before).

I am not baptized Catholic, and I don&#8217;t believe that young Alice is, either (though I haven&#8217;t thought to ask the girl). The priest has not made an issue of this, though I have been attending confession. I am certain that you would laugh at this, sir, you would find the whole thing to be quite silly, but though I do not confess myself often, I find that after I do, and solemnly recite the prescribed prayers, I feel a little less burdened. In the same way, I feel that now I am confessing my sins to you.

The principle actors have been explained, so on with the drama. My encounter with Natasha occurred on the night of our wedding anniversary this past August. The significance of the date was in the back of my mind for much of the day and evening. Lydia, perhaps mindful of the day herself, kept me busy with errands: going to the bank, going down to the wharf to procure a particular type of fish, picking up a dress that she had ordered in for me. I did not complain at being given these tasks; on the contrary, during our first few months in San Francisco, I had to beg her to give me more to do around the place. I do enjoy the fresh air, and I find myself walking much of the time. I do acknowledge, sir, that these private sojourns about the city would be opportunities for me to stop by a post office and send word to you, and yet...I do fear that someone is watching the post, that any correspondence I send your way would not necessarily be secure. You will not read these words until I feel certain that they will be viewed by you, and only you.

It was a lovely summer day. The weather in San Francisco, and all around the bay, is typically mild all year. For a short time, I forgot myself in my chores and in enjoying the beautiful day, but as I walked toward home in the later part of the afternoon, carrying the heavy dress bag (having signed for the large order of fish and had it sent ahead in a delivery wagon), I felt deeply troubled. So much time has passed since we were parted, sir, and though I am told that you all are well, I do worry. For a moment, I considered dropping my burden and taking a carriage to the train station, getting on and heading back East, not stopping in my travels until I arrived home again. I even stood on the sidewalk a moment and contemplated this, and for a moment I was hopeful and happy again, thinking of our children and of you, my dearest sir. But I felt sick as I considered the consequences, for I know that Lydia would not fail to follow through on her threats, and for a moment, I imagined that my happy homecoming would be a horrifying scene: our children, dead or taken away by a terrible villain; you, arrested, with the police waiting for me as well. 

Oh, sir, I know you would not want me to dwell on such dark and terrible thoughts. These images creep into my nightmares, and more. I admit that I go through spells of insomnia, staying up all night while Lydia conducts her �business,� having �playtime� with her in our private quarters in the early morning, and lying awake while she rests, knowing that to attempt sleep will be futile, before rising with the sun to begin another lonely day. Well, you know of my insomnia. It comes and it goes, but more often than not, I am lacking in sleep. My concern for the girls, and the need to satisfy Lydia enough to keep our family safe, are the only things driving me to live now. That, and the hope (though it fades, sir, I admit it fades a little bit more with each passing day) that I will be with you and our children again.

So I was in quite a dark mood when I returned to the place. I found Lydia in our quarters, preening at the vanity. She was cheerful when I came in. �Oh, my sweet little pet, you&#8217;re such a good girl for helping me with the chores today,� she said, coming to me and kissing me softly. She ignored my sullen countenance. �Try on your new dress for me, show Mother how pretty you look.�

Wordlessly, I put on the gown, which reminded me so much of the fancy dresses that I wore in my previous life. I have no need for such finery now. An ordinary skirt with a blouse is good enough for me now. I have no life outside of the place and the church; there is no one for whom I am dressing or trying to impress. Lydia loved it, though, and she gushed, �Oh, my pet, you must wear this tonight,� she declared.

I forced a wane smile. �I don&#8217;t think it will be necessary for me to dress up to sit in the office, Lydia,� I said kindly. 

�But you must join us tonight,� Lydia insisted. �I&#8217;ve decided to have a party, my pet, and I want you right by my side. We&#8217;re going to have such fun tonight.� I feared that she would finally force me to join her with a client, but this was not so. 

Lydia had hired two young cooks for the evening to fry up all of the fish that I had purchased. Now that the garden was in presentable condition, Lydia had decided to host the party out back, it being such a lovely evening, with &#8216;guests&#8217; able to slip into the house to engage in their acts of debauchery. Champagne flowed freely, and Lydia was in such a festive mood that she even allowed the girls to partake. You know that I have rarely been drunk, but I&#8217;m afraid that that night, I drank as much as many of the sodden clients. 

For a short while, I was not a solemn drunk, but was quite merry. I believe that I talked and laughed with everyone, and perhaps in my altered mind I thought I was at a neighbor&#8217;s party, socializing as I always did. As it grew dark, the party moved indoors, and one client sat at the piano (in the parlor more for show than anything else, and it is terribly out of tune) and played the jaunty dancehall songs. I danced for what felt like hours, I danced with everyone, and at one point I found myself with Lydia yet again. �Why, Mother!� I cried. �There you are.�

Lydia grinned and pulled me aside. �You&#8217;re having a good time, my pet?� I nodded and she smiled, touching my face. �See, Emily? You can be happy with me.�

This reminder of the situation ruined my mood. I even felt guilty; I was carelessly indulging myself, on the day of our wedding anniversary! I soon quitted the party and returned to the office with a pot of strong tea, and I changed out of that horrid gown and into a high-necked dress, and sat brooding for some time. After about an hour, Lydia came to find me.

�What is the matter, my pet?� she asked. �Did you drink too much?�

I nodded. �Yes,� I said, �But that is not the problem.� With great difficulty, I looked into her eyes. �I have no doubt that you remember the date.�

Lydia sighed impatiently, as I expected her to. �This again, my little pet? What do you want of me? What can I do to make you happy?�

�You know what I want,� I said, my voice trembling. �But I know that you are not willing to give it to me. So there we are.�

�Stubborn pet,� Lydia scolded me. �I used to pity your sorrow, I truly did.� (I do not believe that for a moment, sir). �But now you are being willful. You know that you would be happy if you tried.� She angrily went to the door; she was returning to the party, and would leave me blessedly alone. But she stopped to say, �You loved me once, my pet, I know you did. Can you not find a way to love me again? You have so much love in your heart�let me have it, Emily.� For a moment, only a moment, she seemed helpless. It is rare that I have seen her look this way. �I need your love.�

�I do love you,� I said dully, and this is no lie, sir. �And I do everything that you ask of me. I can do no more.�

Lydia cut her eyes at me, but left with a sharp slam of the door. I would have to pay for it later, I knew (and I definitely did). But certainly it was not the idea of brutal punishment that made me lay my head on the desk and cry so.

The party kept the girls and Joseph so busy that I was completely alone for the evening. I retired to bed and did not sleep. When Lydia came in, perhaps a bit after three, she was quite drunk herself. I feigned sleep as she tenderly but clumsily touched my face. �Pretty pet,� she slurred, �Mother does love you, even when you&#8217;re a naughty girl.� She was out cold only a few seconds later.

I rose in the dark and looked at my captor for a moment. Lydia is still beautiful, sir. You would think that her erratic schedule would show on her face, but she looks as young as ever. She is truly happy with this life, just as I was truly happy with you. I thought it terribly unfair that I had to sacrifice my happiness for hers. You would not believe your gentle Emily to be capable of murderous thoughts, but sir, for the briefest of moments I considered smothering her in her helpless state. But I did not do so, of course. In fact, I undressed her tenderly, leaving her only in her slip, and tucked her in gently, as though I were tucking in our children. I left her to sleep into the late morning.

The house was quiet now, the last of the &#8216;guests&#8217; gone, Joseph back in the cottage with Alice and the girls all asleep upstairs (or so I thought). As exhausted as I was, I knew I could not sleep, especially in the bed with Lydia. I turned on the light on my desk in the office and attempted to read, but the words blurred in front of my face. My stomach rumbled, and I made my way to the kitchen to find the leftover fish wrapped neatly. Believing myself to be completely alone, I dug into a fried fillet without even using utensils. I heard laughter behind me from the small entrance.

�So this is what a proper Englishwoman does when she is alone.�

I turned and found Natasha, wearing her night slip, grinning at me. I smiled sheepishly as she joined me at the counter. �I thought everyone was in bed.�

�I couldn&#8217;t sleep,� Natasha said. �And I was hoping you would be up in the night, as usual. I wanted to talk to you.�

�Of course,� I said with genuine concern. Still a bit drunk, I fumbled as I started a pot of tea for us. �Is everything all right, Natasha?�

�That&#8217;s what I wanted to ask you, Mrs. Singer,� Natasha said. �You looked upset when you left the party this evening. Did you and Mrs. Smithwick have a fight?�

At that moment, I wondered what the girls knew of my relationship with &#8216;Mrs. Smithwick.&#8217; We never quarreled in their presence. �We did have a bit of a disagreement,� I admitted carefully. I tried to laugh it off. �Let that be a lesson to you. Don&#8217;t go into business with a friend.�

�She&#8217;s not really a &#8216;friend&#8217; of yours, is she?� Natasha asked, and from her tone, I knew that she knew, at least some of the nature of our relationship. �Mrs. Singer, if you don&#8217;t mind my asking�how did you end up here?�

All of the girls, as well as Joseph, had told me their stories. They did not know mine. I didn&#8217;t want to lie to Natasha�I hate to lie to anyone, ever, and I respected her. But of course, I could not reveal to her our secrets. When I said nothing, Natasha added, �Where is Mr. Singer?�

Mr. Singer. Hearing your name made me cry, and Natasha tried to console me. �Mr. Singer,� I finally managed, �Is alive and well, in England. With our children.� 

�Was he cruel to you?�

�Oh, heavens, no!� I cried, springing to your defense. �My husband is the gentlest, kindest man in the world.� I told her how you raised me, sir, and how you treated me as though I were your own child�until my 18th birthday. I told her this as well, how you gave me the greatest gift in the world, your love and devotion, and how I gave you the same. Natasha was silent as I told her all of this, and my voice trembled, and my tears did not stop flowing. But it felt wonderful to be able to speak of you again. Lydia scorns any mention of you, and I&#8217;ve only had my sweet memories to comfort me.

�Mrs. Singer,� Natasha finally said, �If your husband was so good to you, why did you leave?�

This is when I was forced to lie. �Poor Mrs. Smithwick was a friend of my mother&#8217;s,� I said, that in itself a truth. �She was recently widowed, and so terribly lonely. I agreed to come away with her� (there&#8217;s the lie) �and help her begin her life anew.�

�So you won&#8217;t be staying with us?� Natasha asked. I wished I could tell her that, no, unfortunately I would be leaving San Francisco by the next train and would never return. I smiled and gave her the truth, at least as I know it to be.

�I will stay as long as Mrs. Smithwick needs me to,� I said. �But then I will have to go.�

Natasha gave me a suspicious look. I had left too many holes in my story. Why would a wife and mother leave her loving family to help some mean old lady? I knew she could tell that I was hiding the truth. But when I asked her to keep the information to herself, she agreed, and so far she has kept her word. 

�But you and Mrs. Smithwick,� Natasha added, �You&#8217;re not just friends, isn&#8217;t that so?�

I did admit to her our sexual relationship, feeling very little shame in that. None of the girls seem to mind Maggie and Nancy&#8217;s relationship, nor do they treat them any differently for it. One thing to be said for prostitutes (at least the ones I&#8217;ve met) is that they&#8217;re not surprised by anything, nor are they very judgmental. I even admitted to Natasha that you, my dear husband, had not only given me permission to serve Lydia, but that you had been the one to introduce us in the first place.

Natasha said, �Among my people, you would be called n�dleeh�,� she said. �My grandmother was a warrior, and she lived with my grandfather and her female lover in their hut. I could see you as a warrior, Mrs. Singer.�

�Oh, no,� I laughed, briefly imagining myself in war paint, astride my chestnut stallion. Natasha smiled, and she took me gently by the hand. Her hands are large, sir, almost masculine, and I remember briefly wondering how they would feel on my body. I would soon find out, sir, I assure you.

�Mrs. Singer,� Natasha said, �You are a kind woman, but you are strong. I can see it. You&#8217;d have to be strong to deal with a woman like Mrs. Smithwick.�

I was tempted to come to Lydia&#8217;s defense. Or perhaps to tell Natasha that I was not so tough, that I was, in actuality, a prisoner, a hostage, very weak in my position, in fact. But I could not say it. It felt nice to have Natasha&#8217;s respect. I have always been adored, sir, by you and many others, but have I ever been respected? By you, certainly�you respect me enough to give me everything that I need. Lydia certainly does not respect me at all. 

I did not defend Lydia, and I certainly did not tell Natasha the truth. I merely nodded and smiled, and we enjoyed our tea as Natasha told me more stories of her grandmother the warrior. After we&#8217;d finished our tea, we were not eager to return to our respective rooms for the night. As I rinsed and set aside our tea things, Natasha suddenly said, �You have a lot on your mind, Mrs. Singer. Isn&#8217;t that why you don&#8217;t sleep well at night?�

I turned to her and nodded, comfortable enough with her to admit that much. �You need to find some clarity for your thoughts�you need to take on another perspective,� Natasha continued. She approached me slowly, almost seductively. �I have to admit that I have the same problem sometimes. There&#8217;s something that I like to do�a ritual, I guess you could say, and it helps me to think much more clearly.�

I was intrigued, sir, and I allowed Natasha to lead me up to the third floor, where the girls stayed. Natasha had her own small room, and she had pushed the two smaller beds together to create a large one just for herself. 

I perched on the bed as Natasha went to her dresser. �Do not be shocked, Mrs. Singer,� she said sheepishly as she retrieved a small snuffbox. �I do not do this often. But every once in a while, I partake. It clears my head. Jiao introduced me to it.� She opened the box to reveal fragrant green buds. 

�Oh,� I said, in faint surprise. �It&#8217;s marijuana.� I had seen some men (and Lydia) partaking in it in New York; I had declined. But sir (and I do imagine, if you are given the chance to read this, that you would smile and be most amused), I did smoke a little with Natasha in her bedroom. It made me feel light-headed, particularly since I was still recovering from drink, I believe, and I lay back luxuriously on the pillows. I had personally supplied the girls with comfortable bedding; I did not allow Lydia to be as stingy with them as she might have been.

Natasha smiled and lay on her stomach beside me. �Feeling better, Mrs. Singer?� she asked, smiling gently and laying a hand on my stomach.

�Oh, yes,� I said. �Thank you, Natasha. You&#8217;re very kind.� 

She sat up a little, her hand snaking up to my chest. We didn&#8217;t say anything more; I don&#8217;t believe that we knew what to say, but so giddy from smoking were we that we did not resist our carnal urges. Though Natasha plays the submissive whore with her clientele, she was the one to unclothe me and feel me up. I was not restrained, though I did grab hold of the pillow behind my head, and quite imagined that I were as she went down on me.

Oh, sir, I admit that I felt some guilt later on, knowing that being with Natasha, without your presence or approval, were my choice alone. With Lydia, I have been forced, as we both know and have acknowledged. It was my guilt that made me react as I did the following day, but that night, high and happy, we pleasured each other in her bed. I did not ask her to tie me up, nor did I do so to her. 

She tasted wonderful, sir, so wonderful! You know how much pussy I have tasted (for now I cannot even begin to remember all of the women that I have pleasured!), but I daresay that Natasha was the sweetest. I imagined, as I lapped at her (and she cried out in surprise, not expecting even sweet and prim little Mrs. Singer to be so skilled) that you were watching me, with approval, and I delivered the same pleasure to her that I have given to so many others. Natasha, panting in exhaustion afterwards, kissed me softly and thanked me, and we held each other, naked, and fell asleep, under the spell of the drug. I felt better than I had since being taken from you, sir.

Which brought on the guilt as I arose in the late morning. I dressed in haste and left Natasha alone. I blushed furiously when I came upon Maggie in the hallway, but the timid thing was too surprised at seeing me to interrogate me. I bade her a kind good morning and hurried down the stairs.

I smelled breakfast in the kitchen. Curious, I made my way back, and found Lydia herself, wearing only her little robe, humming cheerfully and frying sausages. �Oh!� she said upon seeing me enter. �Good morning, my pet. I did miss you when I awoke.�

�Good morning, Lydia,� I said carefully.

�Cup of tea, my pet?� she offered sweetly. I came to her, still wary (for, as you well know, sir, she never cooks). She kissed me softly before handing me a cup. As way of explanation, she said, �Our maid is still at her errands, so I thought I would make a late breakfast for you. I am sorry for upsetting you last night, Emily,� she said, smiling gently.

Oh, sir, I could not help but soften a little. It is not often when Lydia will admit herself at fault in any situation. �Thank you, Lydia,� I said.

�Have a seat, and Mother will serve you,� Lydia said cheerfully, and I did so. I sat at the same table at which I&#8217;d sat and talked with Natasha the night before. Lydia continued to talk as she prepared the eggs. �My pet,� she said casually, not looking at me, �Perhaps next time you play with one of the girls, you&#8217;ll consider doing so for the sake of one of the paying clients? Or myself?� 

I was most surprised that she had learned of my transgression (had I committed a transgression? Even then, I was not certain) so soon; I had not meant to keep it from her, by any means. �Are you upset, Lydia?� I asked.

Lydia laughed gaily, and I knew she was not at all upset. But she said, sweetly but seriously, �I do want you to be happy with me, my dear pet. And if playing with the girls makes you happy, then by all means, play. But do remember the welfare of my business,� she added. 

I was not so concerned with mixing business with pleasure (for what is it to me if the business fails? Though I will keep the books honestly and consistently until it does, or until I quit this wretched place), but I long considered Lydia&#8217;s permission, and what it meant. And I realized: she wants me to have emotional ties with the girls, or anyone connected to her �business,� and her new life, really. To further her hold on me. This is the conclusion that I came to by that evening, and I avoided Natasha for the next week or more. Cowardly, I know, and I believe you would be ashamed of me. I certainly am ashamed of myself.

I did eventually discuss the matter with Natasha, though it did not come out as I might have hoped. I asked her to come into the office one afternoon, and she was sullen and cold, too aware of my avoidance of her. I apologized for this, owning up to my behavior. �It is childish for me to have avoided you so,� I said. �I am quite sorry for it, Natasha, because I honor your friendship��

�Oh,� Natasha said quickly. She flushed, and looked startled. She seemed to come to some sort of realization, and she rose. �Mrs. Singer,� she said, �You have nothing to apologize for. And if you wish, we may not discuss that night again.�

I readily agreed, and did not reflect on her reaction until much later. I am afraid, sir, that that situation has never been revisited or resolved, and so I have had no repeated episodes with Natasha. A part of me is relieved in this, for I do not want to establish any ties here; I want to have no regrets about dashing home to you the moment that I am able. But I do feel guilty for hurting Natasha&#8217;s feelings.

As I previously stated, we are cordial and kindly but no longer are we friends, which is worse than losing her as a lover, I believe. Ah, well. I tire of writing now, sir. My troubles with Lydia remain much the same, in spite of her kind behavior that noted morning. I have been at my writing for some hours now, sir, from the very earliest breaking of daylight, and I know that Lydia will be rising soon. Like it or not, I will have to see to her needs.

Love,

Your Emily


25 December, 18&#8212;

My most dearest sir,

A very happy Christmas to you and ours. My mood is heavy on this light-hearted, cheerful day. It is business as usual at our place, and the house is crowded with clients, rollicking with drink. I am hidden away in the office, of course. Though my entire day was not so lonely.

I started the morning by attending mass, at that same small Catholic chapel that I had previously mentioned. Young Alice accompanied me. The chapel was more crowded than usual, and I expected that we would be forced to stand at the rear. Holding fast to Alice&#8217;s hand, I began leading her to an open spot along the back wall.

�Mrs. Singer,� the priest, my confessor, called to me, approaching. �The front pew has been reserved for you.�

�Oh, bless you, Padre,� I said, surprised by the gesture (though I know I am, by far, the most generous benefactor of the congregation). As Alice and I made our way to the front of the small, crowded chapel, we were greeted politely by the other parishioners. �Yes, Merry Christmas,� I echoed their greetings. �Feliz Navidad. God bless you.� The warmth of the congregation (and the sizable feast of delicious Mexican food afterward, especially the incredible tamales made by a sweet elderly woman whom everyone calls Mamita), and the uplifting service did put me in a festive mood, and even serious young Alice was cheerful as we made our way home again.

�Mrs. Singer, do come into our cottage and try the bread pudding that I made,� Alice begged, and how could I refuse such an invitation? She reminded me of myself at her age, how I would occasionally make some sort of baked good and present it to you for your approval. You would politely partake in it and declare it delicious (always so generous to me, sir), and I would beam, so pleased to have your favor. 

In spite of my decision to not encourage relationships with anyone here, I am still quite drawn to young Alice. She is so like myself, but she has not had my good fortune. She has suffered the hardships that I might have, had I not had your love and protection. Joseph does what he can for her, but I feel as though he is a lost child himself (though he is quite near my own age). I do what I can to help them both.

The young man was building the fire in the chimney when Alice and I entered. He turned and smiled. �Oh, happy Christmas, Mrs. Singer,�&nbsp; he said, politely but nervously. I have not spent much time in their cottage.

�Happy Christmas, Joseph,� I returned, giving him my warmest smile, and he gestured for me to sit. He himself built the small table in their little kitchen, and his artistic inclinations are revealed in the little intricate carvings along the sides and on the chairs. I recently sat in and watched Joseph work on a portrait of Jiao in the parlor, and I must say, sir, he is most skilled. He has asked to paint my portrait, and as of yet, I have refused him. I am beginning to waver, and I feel that if he asks me again, I will have to accept. Perhaps it will be a nice gift for you, when we are reunited. How much longer must we wait for that day?

But the mood in the cottage was cheerful. Joseph served sweetened warm milk with cinnamon (and with a comical wink, added just a nip of liquor to his and mine), and passed around the mugs. We enjoyed ourselves for a short time, but when Joseph invited me for dinner, I had to decline. �Mrs. Smithwick is expecting my company,� I said. She would be opening up the place later in the evening, but she had granted the girls and Joseph the morning and afternoon off. Undoubtedly, none had opted to spend their free time with her.

So by early afternoon I was in the place again, and I found Lydia in our bedroom, sitting at her vanity. When she turned to me, she was not smiling at first, and for a moment it seemed she was quite upset indeed. But she seemed to return to herself, and she smiled and said, �Happy Christmas, pet. Mother has surprises for you.�

In the community, mainly at the Catholic chapel, and amongst the girls and clients, I have a somewhat respectable reputation. Serious but kind-hearted Mrs. Singer. Yet for Lydia, I am still her pet, and I stripped off my dress and went to my knees for her, trembling as she stood and approached me. She ran her hand gently down my cheek, allowing it to drape lazily over my chest, and shoulders, and lower back, as she circled around me, as though inspecting me. She came around to face me again, smiling brightly. �Pretty little pet,� she said, �Have you anything for Mother this Christmas?�

�Yes, Lydia,� I said, and I could not help it, sir, my voice was smaller and more childlike, as it always is when I am her pet. 

Lydia was eagerly pulling off her bedclothes (though it was after one o&#8217;clock, she still had not dressed for the day). Her breasts are still surprisingly pert for her age, and her nipples were hard, as mine were. I expected that she would squat down on my face, as she so enjoys doing, but instead she joined me on my knees, and kissed me softly. I followed her lead, as I always do, and allowed her to slowly seduce me, running her hands all over my tits and stomach, back and ass, but barely touching me with the tips of her fingers.

But her sensual touch became torturous, and I reached up and began to massage her tits, perhaps with a bit more aggression than I typically would. You remember, I am sure, how much I used to enjoy playing with our dear Mrs. Gainsley&#8217;s tits, slowly rubbing and squeezing them, and suckling ever so gently on her nipple. Lydia has not Mrs. Gainsley&#8217;s generous breasts, as you know, and I do miss the warmth of a full bosom. Oh, and I still do blush to confess it, too, sir!

Lydia seized my wrists. �Naughty pet,� she scolded. �So impatient to play. Will Mother have to punish this little pet?�

�Oh, yes, please,� I murmured, pushing myself against her as I tilted my head back. Oh, sir, the idea of punishment still turns me on so much. Lydia has become fond of not only tying me up but blindfolding me as well, and she knows how much I have enjoyed that. I do not tell her that, wearing the blindfold, I am better able to imagine you on the other end of the paddle or riding crop. 

And so it was this afternoon, though in the position she tied me the blindfold proved to be most useless. She had me crotch down on the floor, with my knees tucked beneath me. She is so fond of folding me up in cruel positions and leaving me after a beating. She had my wrists bond behind my neck, and attached to the collar that she had gifted to me. You had given me a collar for Christmas as well, sir, as I did not fail to recall as she slipped it around my neck. 

My head touched the floor in this position, and I struggled a little to breathe, to relax my body, as she bound my ankles, using that same spreader bar that she had used when we played together in London. My ass, back, and pussy were completely exposed to her, and these all received attention from her wooden paddle. This paddle was a gift from a grateful client, and is fashioned with various holes to reduce wind resistance as she swings it back. She hit me over and over again, giving particular notice to my cunt, and I screamed freely, not wearing a gag.

I heard the paddle smack wetly against my soaking pussy again. Oh, it burned sir, and I thought of you and I cried, �Oh, please, Lydia, oh God!�

�You need Mother, pet?� Lydia demanded. She smacked my ass this time, and I shook, having to clench my stomach to keep from toppling onto my side. 

�Oh, yes, I need you,� I cried in agreement, and she smacked my ass and pussy again and again, laughing gleefully as I moaned and screamed. You know that I cannot resist her playful cruelty, and admit that I did enjoy myself this afternoon, particularly when she dropped the paddle and knelt down behind me, fingering my pussy and stroking my throbbing clit.

�You do need your dear Mother,� she observed teasingly. �But you remember the rule, don&#8217;t you little pet? Tell Mother the rule.�

�You first,� I said obediently, and she slapped my ass with her hand. 

�That&#8217;s right, my whorish pet, Mother first,� she agreed, and without removing my restraints, she helped me to unfold my body so that I could crawl awkwardly across the floor, to where she sat comfortably in her armchair. How many times have I knelt before her as she has sat in that chair (in which I am not allowed to sit) and pleasured her? Countless, countless, and add another one on from this afternoon. 

It was a terrible strain to lean in and lick her, as my wrists were still tied behind my neck, and I attempted to pleasure her quickly. She would not have that, and by the time I finally brought her to her climax (during which she squirted her thick juices all over my face), my neck and back were aching terribly.

Noticing my strain, Lydia was inspired to torment me further. She removed my restraints and allowed me to stretch uneasily. �Lie down on the bed, my pet, face down,� she instructed, and I knew what she would do to me. You see, sir, she so enjoyed playing with our leather phallus that she purchased one of her own (in fact, several, as she uses them on the clients as well), and this afternoon, she fucked my ass as she fingered my cunt teasingly, finally allowing me to come after I&#8217;d shat all over myself.

Playtime was exhausting, and after Lydia and I bathed together, I changed the bed sheets and we had a long nap. By the time I awoke, Lydia was gone, preparing for a night of business, and had left me a short note:

Happy Christmas, my lovely little pet. Mother is working now. Enjoy your quiet time, sweet pet�unless you wish to join the fun.

Well, of course I had no desire to do that, so I rose and dressed. I have been writing this letter to you, but have stopped occasionally to concentrate on my thoughts. It being Christmas, I cannot help but remember the lovely Christmases that we have always celebrated together, especially those after we were wed. Oh, sir, I am crying again now, I miss you and our children so terribly. I cannot stand it, so I will make one more confession to you. When I came out to my desk this evening, I found another note, along with a small, unwrapped box.

Mrs. Singer &#8211; In case you are lost in thought again. Merry Christmas.

Inside the box was a small pile of those same strong-smelling buds. Well, I&#8217;m afraid that I cannot resist, sir, and will partake privately. At the very least, the drug should put me to sleep.

Love,

Your Emily


26 December, 18&#8212;

Oh, sir, as dismal as my holiday may have seemed in my last letter, things became far, far worse after I wrote it! I&#8217;m trembling so much that I can scarcely write, but I promise that I will put it all down in detail. I&#8217;m sure it will all be on my mind for some time, and I am afraid, sir�I am terribly afraid�that I do hate myself. Damned day! Never in my life have I been so wretched! I cannot even put it to paper now�but sir, I will be willing to do anything, anything, anything for your forgiveness, which I am certain I will never deserve!

Love most sincerely,

Your Emily

P.S. I have made a resolution, sir; these letters will find their way to you, somehow. I cannot bear to be apart from you any longer. I will wait for you to come for me in San Francisco, if you feel it is prudent to make the trip. I love you most dearly, sir, and when you come for me, I shall tell you all!





















Mr. Singer

On a calm winter afternoon, I received a small package, the return address from the Salinas Valley in California. Mrs. Gainsley, thick around the middle with my child, brought it to me in my office, and was very curious as to whom it may be from. �Who is William Mosley?� she asked lightly.

It only took a moment to remember, thanks to my wife&#8217;s very detailed diary entries. Young Billy, Colonel Faulkner&#8217;s servant in Bangalore. How had the young man ended up in California? And why would he be getting into contact with me, after so long? I suspected what the package contained, and I was eager to get Mrs. Gainsley away. I merely said, �He worked for an old friend in India.� I put the package aside, feigning indifference, and said, �Thank you, my Beatrice.� I put my hands on her waist and pulled her to me. �How are you feeling this afternoon?�

�I feel wonderful, Aaron,� she said, smiling brightly. Like Emily, her pregnancy put her in a very sunny mood indeed. Though I was thrilled by the lovely expansion of her sweet body, I was not so happy, though I hid my moods better from her than I ever could from my all-knowing wife. I feared what my dear Emily would say when she came home to a strange child, mine but not hers. And, though I had pretended indifference to the opinions of our neighbors, I feared for our reputation. Mrs. Gainsley&#8217;s pregnancy was only yet known to those who resided at Wainwright Hall, and to her sister and brother-in-law, the Sheltons. But she was beginning to show. And what would happen then?

I had been toying with the idea of sending Mrs. Gainsley and the children away to my former home, Oakridge Manor. I had recently received word that my tenant would not be renewing his lease�rather then fill the place, I pondered, why not tuck my lover out of the way to avoid a scandal? But I had been afraid to bring the topic up with her. She was so happy, happier than I&#8217;d ever seen her, and I feared upsetting her. In only a couple of hours, I would no longer care about that.

In the two years since Mrs. Shelton had left us, I&#8217;d almost been happy again. I had my lovely Beatrice, so devoted to me, even though she knew that, while hope still lived in my heart of Emily&#8217;s return, I would never marry her. With Shelton by my side, my law practice was more successful than ever as we took on cases in neighboring counties, still dealing mostly with property disputes and estate wills. But, though my young Peter was growing into a well-mannered and intelligent (though small, always quite small for his age) little boy, my dear Mina was a thorn in my side. As she grew older, the girl seemed tempted to defy me at every turn, especially in my efforts to mold her into, I suppose, something of a replacement for my Emily.

I felt she could not have been less like her dear mother! Besides her looks (which I forgave, as I&#8217;d provided them; she was lovely, though, her bright smile balancing out her hawkish features), she was quite opposed to her mother in personality. Where Emily was yielding and obedient, Mina was stubborn, and at times wayward. Where Emily was polite and charming, Mina had a sarcastic streak, which had earned her a stern lecture more than once. Ah, but where Emily trembled and apologized profusely when chastised, Mina merely rolled her eyes and sighed with impatience, eager to get away from me and continue her mischief. I was at my wit&#8217;s end, and more than once had I lost my temper with the child�something that had never happened when Emily was a little girl.

We&#8217;d had one particularly bad row, only the week before I received the package from Billy. I was sitting in my office in an armchair, Mina in the other, a thick volume of poems by the Bront� sisters, published under their pen names, in her lap. She was reading aloud to me, and I sat with my eyes closed, remembering how Emily would read aloud to me as a child, and I to her.

But I was jolted from my thoughts by the thick slamming of the book. I looked in surprise at my daughter as she tossed it aside, her brows thickening darkly over her eyes. �What is the meaning of this?� I stammered, shocked.

�I will read no more,� she declared. �These poems are boring and worthless, Daddy. May I go out to play now?�

�Worthless?� I echoed in amazement. �But your mother loves the Bront� sisters.� Certainly it was true; as a matter of fact, Emily&#8217;s mother&#8217;s dying wish had been that her daughter be named after her favorite of the sisters, whose tragic life and death she&#8217;d found morbidly fascinating. I shared this information with my daughter, yet again.

�I do not care,� Mina said crossly. �It is obtuse and I hate it.� And the child burst into bitter tears! I attempted to comfort her, puzzled as I was, but she would not allow me to put my arms around her. �Leave me alone!� she cried. �You don&#8217;t love me because I cannot be her, and I will not be her!�

I did not pretend to not know what she meant. Upon later reflection, I would feel that the poor girl was justified in her outrage, but at the time, I was merely angered myself. �You are certainly not like your mother,� I scolded. I picked up the discarded book for emphasis. �Her most cherished volume, a rarity, and you treat it in such a manner. What would she say to that?�

�I do not care,� Mina declared again. �She will never return to find out.�

I felt myself blanche; my cheeks grew so cold that they stung, and I trembled. If ever I were tempted to beat my child, it was that moment. But I did not even strike her. I spoke more coolly than before. �For her sake, I hope she does not return,� I said slowly, an absolute lie even as the words left my lips. �Why would she want to come home to a defiant brat of a child? Saucy girl. I have treated you the same way that I treated her in childhood, and she never was such a terror as you.�

Such cruel words, and I immediately regretted them as Mina stared at me, cutting her eyes at me. Challenging me, she said, �Then perhaps you should beat me, Daddy. Perhaps I would not like it as Mummy did.�

�Leave my sight,� I said, and though the look on the girl&#8217;s face was taunting, she saw how serious I was, and she left with haste. I sat in a daze, holding that old book for quite some time, wondering what to do about my rebellious child. I thought of Emily�what kind of relationship might she have developed with our daughter? Though they were so very different, I began to think that Emily would have appreciated Mina&#8217;s humor. Perhaps I might have as well, were I not so serious-minded in Emily&#8217;s absence. Emily would not try to force Mina to be someone she was not; she would love and accept Mina for being Mina. 

I felt quite ashamed of my conduct, though I could not bring myself to apologize to the girl. Unfortunately, she inherited her stubborn streak from me.

But I was not thinking of Mina that afternoon in my office. I was thinking of how to get Mrs. Gainsley out of the way so that I might open the mysterious package. I pulled her onto my lap and kissed her softly on the cheek. �You should lie down for a little while, my dear,� I said. The children were off visiting their Auntie Ana and her little baby Joseph, keeping them company while Shelton was away in London. We would be joining Mrs. Shelton for dinner that evening, while her nanny cared for the three children.

It only took a little sweet-talking to get Mrs. Gainsley to agree to a nap. I waited until she had closed the door before rising and locking it behind her, to ensure my privacy. Slowly, I returned to my desk and took up the package again. I used my letter-opener to open the flimsy package, and pulled out a letter and a small, hardbound notebook.

The letter read, 


24 September, 18&#8212;

Dear Sir Aaron,

I wonder if you remember me. I was Colonel Faulkner&#8217;s gatekeeper in Bangalore. The old man is dead these five years, may he rest in peace, and since leaving India I have been living with my brother in California. He has a large farm, and I help him to run it. We are quite prosperous. But the reason for this letter is not to brag of my success to a man whom I&#8217;ve only met once. I have enclosed here a notebook, given me by your wife Lady Emily. 

I happened upon the lady when I was visiting San Francisco. Your wife remembered me instantly; I have never forgotten her, though I am married now with a family of my own. She was as friendly as always, and looked quite well�she wanted me to tell you that, so that you would not worry for her health or safety. She asked me to send you the enclosed notebook, and in keeping my promise to her, I have not opened it. She would not tell me of the circumstances of your separation, but she seemed quite anxious. 

I do hope that all is well. I send my sincerest regards, and I hope to spend more time catching up with the lady when I find myself in San Francisco once again. 

Sincerely,

William Mosley


Amazed, I picked up the notebook with trembling fingers. San Francisco! My wife was in San Francisco. In the years of her absence, I had pictured her in numerous places (some of them quite awful). But she was safe and well in San Francisco.

I spent the next hour reading Emily&#8217;s letters. The last one had been written the day after Christmas, two years prior; I suppose that Emily had waited until she was quite certain she could have it delivered to me discreetly. Certainly it was fortunate that she&#8217;d found someone she could trust; how long might she have waited if she had not happened upon our old friend?

She&#8217;d jotted down one quick note, much more recent than the other letters:

My dearest sir,

My sincerest apologies for not writing more. But writing is no longer a comfort to me; as the letters pile up, it only reminds me how much time has passed since we were together. As I wrote, I will explain all when (if) you come for me. Oh, sir, please do! I am in no better state now than when I last wrote. Please come for me, sir. I miss you more, not less, with each passing day.

Love,

Your Emily

I shed many tears upon those letters. My poor, sweet little Emily! She was so desperate and lonely, my dear little lamb. I vowed to go to her�run to her�come what may. Restlessly, I began to pace the office. Yes, I could send Mrs. Gainsley off to Oakridge Manor with the children, and while she was there, I would go for Emily. I&#8217;d kill that Lydia Morrison (Smithwick, rather) if I had to, but Emily would be mine again. 

As I pondered the situation, I realized something else. I had to look again at her descriptions of them, but I felt quite certain�could it really be? The Joseph and Alice she&#8217;d written of in the letters�they certainly had to be Shelton&#8217;s long-lost brother and sister! Realizing this, any doubts or fears that I had about running to my Emily were cast away. I wasn&#8217;t just going to be reuniting our family�I would be reuniting theirs as well. Yes, this was my destiny.

Elated, I took up the notebook and hurried upstairs to Mrs. Gainsley. She was not lying in bed, but was sitting at the desk, writing a letter of her own, and she jumped and stared, flushing, as I entered. I noticed not her countenance at first. �My dear Beatrice,� I burst out, �It is a miracle.� She stood, and I took her in my arms, squeezing her excessively in my excitement. She led me to the bed to sit, and I told her all.

Mrs. Gainsley was quiet, and though she looked amazed, she did not look happy. �So you will go for her, Aaron?� she finally asked.

�Why, of course,� I said. I only happened to note then that she was much less thrilled than I at the news. �Come now, don&#8217;t worry, my dear,� I said, touching her face affectionately. �I have no doubt that Lady Emily will be so happy with the addition to our family. And your sister and brother-in-law�won&#8217;t they be happy to have all of their family back again?�

�I&#8217;m sure they will,� Mrs. Gainsley said. �Oh, Aaron, I do not wish to distress you, but what of Mrs. Morrison&#8217;s threats?�

�Mrs. Morrison may go to the devil,� I declared with a mad grin. �I will deal with her.�

�But is she not conspiring with another?� Mrs. Gainsley asked anxiously. �Oh, Aaron, are you certain that you can take the risk?�

�She claims to be conspiring with someone,� I admitted slowly. I had not considered that aspect of the situation yet. �But�certainly only you and I know of the package from California, is that not so? And with you and the children departing for Oakridge Manor�could I not easily be accompanying you there? I��

I stopped, seeing Mrs. Gainsley&#8217;s eyes flint over to her desk. I had my second revelation that day, this one filling me with dread. I stared at her a moment, meeting her eyes, and I knew. I wanted to curse, scream, throw her from the window�throw myself from the window. Such I fool I was!

I stood slowly and went to the desk. She did not try to stop me, and I heard her begin to sob as I picked up the paper on which she&#8217;d been writing. It was not dated, nor did it contain a salutation, but only read:

On your request, I am informing you that he received a package from California.

I took up the paper and turned, holding it up. Mrs. Gainsley covered her face with her hands. Slowly, I asked, �Who is this for?� She did not answer, and I asked, much more loudly, �Who is it for, Beatrice?�

Her sobs were my only answer. I threw the paper aside and hurried to her, taking her by the hair and thrusting her head back. �Look at me, treacherous bitch, look at me!� Mrs. Gainsley stared up at me, her eyes wide and fearful. Her tears continued to flow, but they did not sway me. Holding tighter still to her hair, I shook her a little. �I want to hear you confess it, Beatrice. Confess! It was you who conspired against our family. Traitor! Confess it!�

�Yes, it was me!� she screamed, sobbing more loudly. I still did not let go of her hair. �Oh, please, Aaron, I only did it because I love you��

�Love?� I screamed. I let go of her hair at last, tossing her head back in the process. She let herself be thrown on her back. �Get up, whore! You claim to love me, and this is how you treat me? And what of Emily? Were you waiting for enough time to pass for her to be declared legally dead? Did you think you&#8217;d get to be my wife then? Damn you!�

I trembled in rage. Mrs. Gainsley made no other attempts to explain her treachery, and I would not have heard them, anyway. I paced the room and she watched me fearfully. I shook my head, forcing myself to be calm. �No,� I finally said aloud. �No, you&#8217;re not going to ruin this for me. Too much is at stake here.� I looked her square in the eye. �If you were not carrying my child, I would shoot you dead this minute. You owe your life to the child inside of you�remember that!�

She sobbed, and I decided to tie her up. She made no attempts to physically resist me, though she did beg, whimpering, as I tied the knots tighter than I would usually dare, not caring what marks they left on her wrists and ankles. �Oh, Aaron, please do not hate me��

�I do hate you,� I declared. Perhaps for the moment, it was true. �I never would have thought this of you, Beatrice, never.�

�What are you going to do to me?� she asked in a panicked whisper.

She was tied down. Were she not clothed, and were I not trembling in rage, this would have been quite a sexy scene indeed. But the thought of touching her made me recoil. �I don&#8217;t know,� I answered truthfully. I gagged her, fighting the urge to slap her hard. �I&#8217;m going to meet with your sister. She&#8217;s clearly the only one who can be trusted�unless she&#8217;s in on this, too.� Mrs. Gainsley shook her head vehemently. �Like I would take your word for it,� I spat in disgust. I left her alone, and through the closed bedchamber door I could hear her muffled sobs.

Though it was a cold evening, I made the walk to the Shelton&#8217;s cottage, running as much as the deep snow would allow. When I burst through the door, Mrs. Shelton was seated by the fire, nursing her son. She stared at me in surprise. �Aaron!� she cried. �I was not yet expecting you. Why, what has happened? Sit, sit�where is my sister?�

Mrs. Shelton attempted to usher me to a chair, but I was too excitable to sit. �Are the children in bed?� I asked.

�The nanny just put them down,� she said. �I was just going to finish feeding Joseph and put him down with them.�

�Finish feeding your child,� I instructed, and she obeyed, resuming her place by the fire as I, still anxious, flinted about the room.

�If you will not sit, Aaron, do come stand by the fire and warm up,� Mrs. Shelton said, her tone both kindly and annoyed. �You are making me so nervous!�

I did stand before the fire, and I told the whole story to her: the package, and what it meant, and my confrontation with her sister, when her betrayal was revealed. �Oh, Aaron!� she finally cried when my story was finished.

I looked her square in the eye. �You must tell me the truth, Tatiana. Were you in on this conspiracy? Were you aiding your sister and Mrs. Morrison?�

�No!� she cried. �No, God no!� And I certainly believed her; she was as shocked by it all as I was. When she went to lay her baby down with my children, she came back to find me slumped in a chair. My extreme emotions, and the run through the snow from Wainwright Hall, had exhausted me. She came and knelt before me, putting a comforting hand on my knee. �What will you do now, Aaron?�

I shook my head. �I know not, Tatiana.�

�I can help you,� she said. �I, and my husband. This isn&#8217;t just about you and Lady Emily anymore.�

�No, it certainly is not,� I agreed. I sighed heavily. �I cannot trust that Beatrice won&#8217;t fulfill her agreement to Mrs. Morrison.�

�Leave her to me,� Mrs. Shelton said. Her face darkened for a moment, and she stood. �Aaron, I must confess that I had the slightest suspicion��

�And you did not think to share this with me?� I snapped impatiently.

She shook her head. �It was ungrounded,� she said. �And I know you would not have believed it. Would you?�

�Certainly not,� I had to admit. Yes, sweet little Mrs. Gainsley had certainly pulled the wool over my eyes. All of her gushing devotion to me, her praise of Lady Emily�lies, lies, all of it! I was too worn out to even cry.

Mrs. Shelton stepped into the kitchen to prepare tea. She and her husband lived simply, the nanny their only hired servant. I was surprised at how well Mrs. Shelton kept their fair-sized cottage. She had confessed to me that she performed her household chores naked, when her husband was at home to watch. �It pleases him,� she&#8217;d said simply, without even the smallest hint of embarrassment. �And it&#8217;s much more fun for me than performing them alone, in the daytime, clothed,� she added with a little roll of her eyes. Still, domestic life and motherhood were suiting Mrs. Shelton quite well. I thought then that she had the life that her sister, who had always been the good girl who followed the rules, had wanted all along. Why the damned fool sought that life with me, when I loved another so deeply, I would never really understand.

Mrs. Shelton proved herself to be a true friend that evening. We never did eat the supper she had prepared herself; we merely sat and came up with a plan of action. �You could still send her and the children to Oakridge Manor,� she suggested. �And I could come along with Joseph and our nanny.�

�What about your husband?� I asked.

�He will understand,� she said confidently. She admitted, �He knows what I did. I couldn&#8217;t keep it from him. He sat right here and I knelt at his feet, begging him not to hate me for it, and he was so kind and understanding. When we explain everything to him, I&#8217;m sure he will be most compliant.� She added, �You do not know how many nights he&#8217;s spent awake, worrying for his brother and sister. Oh, Aaron, do bring them home to us! I want his brother to meet his namesake.�

It was thus decided: when we had Shelton&#8217;s approval, we would set the plan into motion. I would accompany the party to my home and see them settled; then, I would begin my travels halfway across the world. Mrs. Shelton promised to look after her pregnant sister, and the baby when it came, and would convince her sister to forego her sinister plan. �I don&#8217;t think she&#8217;d really have betrayed us,� she said, though she looked uncertain. �I think she was just�desperate.�

I shook my head. �She was ready to inform Mrs. Morrison of the package. I will never trust her again, Tatiana, and I do not care what happens to her after my child is born.�

�Well, I do care,� she said defensively. She shook her head. �Do not lay all the blame on her, Aaron. It is my fault. I&#8217;m the one who committed the crime in the first place.� As many tears had already been shed that day, Mrs. Shelton then added to those. I comforted my friend (I felt, at that moment, that she was my only friend in the world). She put her face to my lap and cried, �Oh, Aaron, please understand that Bea was always a malleable girl. And she loved you�she always loved you. Mrs. Morrison manipulated her, filled her head with lies, I know it!�

Mrs. Shelton&#8217;s pleas calmed my anger against her sister. But even as the clock struck midnight, I was not ready to make the long walk home to confront her. Though I worried for her (or, more accurately, for the baby), being tied up, helpless, and alone all night long, I accepted my friend&#8217;s offer to stay the night. I vowed to make my way to Wainwright Hall in the early morning; I did not expect that I would be getting much sleep.

After we had both calmed ourselves, Mrs. Shelton and I began to speak more optimistically about the revelations of the day. �You&#8217;ll finally have Lady Emily back,� Mrs. Shelton said, as she sat on my lap. �Perhaps you will finally be happy again.�

�Have I seemed so unhappy all these years?� I asked. I had always tried to hide it, mostly for the sake of the children.

�You used to jest and play all the time,� Mrs. Shelton said. �Not so anymore. Aaron, what are you going to do to Mrs. Morrison?�

Leave it to my dear Mrs. Shelton to get to the heart of the matter. There was no longer any question about my journey�but what would happen upon my arrival? Assuming that Mrs. Gainsley could be pacified, what of Mrs. Morrison? The threat of blackmail still existed. In spite of my thoughts of killing her, I knew I could do no such thing. I said, �I will have to find them first�but my dear lady&#8217;s letters were so detailed, I don&#8217;t believe that will be the problem. After that�I do not yet know.�

So many unanswered questions. What would I do with Mrs. Gainsley after I returned? Certainly, I could not allow the traitor to live under my care anymore. But I would not wish to abandon my child�and even if I did, Emily would certainly never forgive me for it. She would want to ensure the child&#8217;s care, such a big heart she had�

After some silence, I said to Mrs. Shelton, �I will find a way. My Emily will come home.� And the thought of being with my wife again, of touching her and holding her and fucking her�I would be fulfilled again, I would have no more nights alone, she would be all mine.

The thought of Emily turned me on so, and Mrs. Shelton could feel me as she sat on my lap. She rubbed me through my pants, smiling. �Yes,� she said. �You&#8217;ll have your precious Emily back. And my husband has a twin brother.�

Encouraging her, I said, �Emily writes that he is a strong, handsome young man.� Though Shelton himself was no weakling. �He has your husband&#8217;s boyish features.� 

The slut! She was imaging herself with two husbands, for her pleasure. Though she served her husband, she certainly got hers back as well. And certainly if Joseph Shelton had been exposed to the activities of &#8216;Lydie Smithwick&#8217;s Place,&#8217; he would not be so shocked by his whorish sister-in-law&#8217;s advances. 

Mrs. Shelton opened my pants. She did not take off her housedress, though she did unbutton the front, allowing her breasts (always generously sized; now lactating, they were the largest I had ever before seen) to spill forth and press against my chest as she guided her pussy to my throbbing cock. I was hard for my Emily, but Mrs. Shelton will always do in a pinch. She rode me, pressing against me, her eyes closed as she moaned. We fucked quickly, and I was all the way inside of her, my balls rubbing against her swollen, throbbing clit (I quite imagined that she had not received pleasure since her husband&#8217;s departure the week before). I put my hands on her waist and pulled her closer, putting my face down into her chest, allowing the warm mounds to envelope me as she rode. I imaged Emily, my nursing little Emily, riding me and slowly, carefully guiding her nipple to my waiting lips, to suckle...

I had never tasted Mrs. Shelton&#8217;s milk before that night, but she said nothing as I, eyes closed, found one of her nipples (smaller than my Emily&#8217;s, quite small on a woman with such enormous tits; her nipples were more brown than red) with my tongue, and licked it slowly, squeezing carefully, tasting just the slightest hint of her milk.

I did not ask permission, and she did not stop me. I began to suckle, and she did not cease in her riding. As she moaned, coming, I bit down on her nipple lightly. I could not pretend that her milk was my Emily&#8217;s; it did not taste the same. I freed her nipple from my teeth and murmured in her ear, �Keep riding, I&#8217;m not quite there yet.�

�Oh, I&#8217;m coming again, Aaron!� Mrs. Shelton cried. In fact, she would come three times total before I finally released into her, filling her. She carefully removed herself from my lap, standing up. I stood with her.

�Take off your dress and lie down, Tatiana,� I instructed. �I will clean you.� Her eyes flashed, a wicked little smile playing on her plump lips as she stripped for me. She&#8217;d kept on some of her weight from her pregnancy, and for a moment, I remembered how Mrs. Gainsley had been deliciously plump long after the birth of her dead child. I forced her from my mind as Mrs. Shelton lowered herself to the floor. 

I could not resist taking my necktie and using it to bind her wrists above her head. She spread her legs wide for me, and I slid between her soft thighs. Putting my head to her cleanly-groomed pussy (disappointingly stretched from birthing her boy, and years of unrestrained sex), I put my mouth to her cunt and sucked, extracting the cum. I thought of how many times I had sucked and licked clean my beloved Emily&#8217;s ass and pussy, swallowing as she giggled. For Mrs. Shelton, I spat my cum onto her stomach. She was a respectable married lady (her reputation in the county much improved since her union with Shelton), but she was still my whore.

I dove down into her pussy again and licked and sucked her clit, bringing her to another orgasm. During this play, I never disrobed. We ended our play abruptly when I untied Mrs. Shelton, and she went to clean herself up. I went to the chimney and rekindled the fire, and stood before it when my friend came back into the room, dressed only in her night slip.

�It is late, Aaron. Will you join me in my bed?�

�Not yet,� I said. I felt tired, but restless. �Go to bed, Tatiana. I&#8217;m going to sit up a while yet.�

She came to me, touching my face gently and kissing me on the cheek, such a sweet kiss for my wildest of whores. �Don&#8217;t worry, Aaron,� she said. �All will be well again. I will help you fix this.�

I smiled at her, loving her more than I ever had at that moment. I kissed her softly. �Thank you,� I said, and she went off to her small bedchamber. She was not so discriminate about sharing her bed, but as far as I could tell, she only shared it with her husband, myself, and a young woman whom Shelton had �befriended� in the village, a client&#8217;s daughter. 

When I went down the hallway an hour later, after some meditative thought, I did not go to her room. I carefully opened the door to the nursery. I crept quietly past the crib, where Joseph (who so resembled Shelton that it cast aside any doubts of his paternity) slept peacefully. The boy, not quite a year old, was a well-behaved baby, his mother proudly reported, and he very much adored her.

On the small bed lay my children. I stood over them and watched them in silence for a moment. Young Peter looked sickly in the dim light of the room, his little cheeks shrunken. I worried constantly for the boy&#8217;s health, though Dr. Yates said that all he needed were more sunlight and exercise. Well, he was an active child, though slower and less exuberant than his sister.

My sweet Mina. I put a gentle hand on her shoulder and gave her a small shake, just enough to awaken her. �It&#8217;s all right, Mina, it&#8217;s only Daddy,� I said softly.

�Daddy?� she murmured in confusion.

�Yes, love,� I said warmly. She reached for my hand and I took it gently. �Get up, dear, I need to have a talk with you.�

�I was sleeping,� she said, not in annoyance but in wonder.

�I&#8217;m sorry, love,� I said. �I&#8217;m afraid that this cannot wait.� I picked her up carefully. She was growing more than her mother had; not yet 10, and she was just as tall as her mother, I was certain. I could still carry her with ease, and I took her from the room, managing to close the door carefully behind me without disturbing the sleeping little boys.

I took Mina to an armchair before the fire and sat with her. I held her so close, enjoying our closeness, realizing that I had not held my little girl like that in some time. I had not been able to give Emily such affection when she was a girl�it simply was not appropriate. But Mina was my own�my own, and my Emily&#8217;s child, and I kissed her softly on the forehead and squeezed her gently. �I&#8217;m sorry, my dear,� I murmured.

�Why, Daddy?� my sleepy, confused child asked.

�I have been terribly mean to you,� I said regretfully. �You do know how much I love you, don&#8217;t you, Mina?�

�Yes, Daddy,� Mina said, surprised. �I love you, too.�

�I have good news, my dear,� I said, smiling. �I know where Mummy is.�

Mina&#8217;s eyes widened, and I was surprised to see them fill with tears. �Oh, Daddy,� she said, �You won&#8217;t tell Mummy I&#8217;ve been a bad girl, will you?�

�Mina, no!� I insisted gently. �Oh, no, love, you haven&#8217;t been a bad girl, not at all. But I&#8217;ve been very bad, and we both know it, Mina.�

�Mummy will forgive you,� Mina said quietly. �Mummy is good and kind.� I wondered if Mina really remembered how sweet her mother was, or if she was merely repeating the ideas I&#8217;d given her and her brother over the years. Certainly poor little Peter remembered nothing about his mother.

�She is good,� I agreed. �I will be going to get her.�

�Where is she, Daddy?�

�She is in California, Mina. Do you remember where that is?�

Mina looked thoughtful for a moment. �In the United States? Is that where Grandmother lives?�

�Same country, but they are far away from each other,� I said with a proud smile. My Mina was a bright girl, though she was stubborn about studying anything that did not directly interest her. �I will have to be gone for a very long time, but when I come home, I will bring Mummy with me. And while I&#8217;m gone, you and Peter and Auntie Ana and Auntie Bea and Joseph will go and stay at Oakridge Manor.�

�Daddy, may I go with you?� Mina asked. At that moment, she reminded me so of her mother. I&#8217;d allowed Emily to travel with me when she was only Mina&#8217;s age. I was even tempted to permit it; her presence would be soothing during the long travels, and wouldn&#8217;t her mother be thrilled to see her? But the situation that I was walking into was precarious, to say the least, and I did not want to expose the girl to anything that might have made her think ill of her mother. So I shook my head.

�No, darling. I need you to stay here and look after Peter. Auntie Ana is going to be busy with Joseph and Auntie Bea and her baby, so you must be a helpful girl.�

I expected that she would whine or put up a fight, but she again read how serious I was. �I will, Daddy,� she said, and I kissed her forehead. �Daddy,� she said suddenly, �Did Auntie Bea do something bad?�

I was far from upset about it, but I asked her a bit sternly, �Mina, were you eavesdropping on Daddy and Auntie Ana?� Mina nodded. �You were supposed to be in bed. Ah, why am I surprised that you would break the rules?� But I said this with affection, and Mina smiled, almost giggling. �Well, Mina, I don&#8217;t quite know how to explain it all right now, but�Auntie Bea is part of the reason why Mummy has had to stay away for so long.�

�And you&#8217;re very upset at her?� Mina asked carefully.

�Yes,� I said, not bothering to hide the truth from her. I did not know how much Mina had heard, and I did not know how much she had understood. I wondered for a moment if she had watched me and Mrs. Shelton playing�the thought almost made me laugh.

�Daddy,� Mina said, �I&#8217;m mad at her, too. I don&#8217;t want to go to Oakridge Manor with her. I hate her!�

�Oh, Mina, don&#8217;t say such things,� I said gently, recalling that I had said those words to Mrs. Gainsley herself only hours before. �What your Auntie Bea did was very hurtful, but�she is still family. Do you remember that she is with child, Mina?� My daughter nodded slowly. �Mina, that is my child as well, and so that baby will be you and Peter&#8217;s brother or sister.�

�Illegitimate,� Mina mumbled.

�That does not matter,� I said sternly, and my daughter looked at me in surprise. I softened a bit as I said, �Mina, when Mummy comes home she will want to take care of that baby. The baby, your little brother or sister, did nothing to hurt anyone, and we must give the child our love.�

Mina was persistent in her anger towards her once-beloved &#8216;Auntie Bea,&#8217; and was quite serious when she declared that late night that she would never forgive her. I wondered if I ever could. I still did not know what I would do with her. But after tucking Mina, exhausted from her own sudden emotions, back into bed, I knew I had to return to her and see to her care. By the time I returned to Wainwright Hall, the sky was turning to a dark blue; it was not quite dawn.

The master bedchamber was dark, and cold. I was glad that I had left Beatrice in her clothing. I went to the bed and stood over her; she stared back up at me with dry, bloodshot eyes, and I knew she had not slept either. I did not touch her as I said, �Are you all right?� She nodded calmly, not making a sound behind her gag. �I am sorry that I left you alone for so long, Beatrice, but I needed to get away from you. If I had stayed, I would have done something quite regrettable.� 

I left her side for a moment to get a fire going. I did not return to the bed until it roared with life, warming the room. I did not sit down; I merely stood over her, casting my shadow on her unmoving form. �I need to say some things to you, and you must listen carefully,� I said, and she gave me another calm nod. �I am going to San Francisco, and you and the children, with your sister and nephew, will be going to Oakridge Manor. I am bringing Emily and your brother-in-law&#8217;s siblings home, and I hope that, when I bring them back, we are all able to resume happy, peaceful lives. You are not going to do anything to prevent that from happening.� 

Again, a nod. I continued in the same calm, even tone, speaking matter-of-factly. �I intend to take care of our child, Beatrice. I will give it the love that it deserves. I have no doubt that my wife will be willing to do the same. As of now, I�I do not know what I will do with you. I should banish you from Wainwright Hall forever, and leave you alone at Oakridge Manor. Perhaps that is what I will do. But you wronged Lady Emily most, Beatrice, so I will allow her the final word in this. I have no doubt that she will show you more mercy than you deserve.�

She let out a small noise then, perhaps wishing to voice a protest, or to speak in her own defense. �No,� I said sharply, turning away from her. �No, Beatrice. I don&#8217;t want to hear your excuses now. Perhaps when my wife and I return, we will be ready to hear what you have to say.� I turned back to her, and with much difficulty, looked her in the eyes. �Perhaps you had a good reason for it. But you know that this was wrong, Beatrice, you know it, and I haven&#8217;t forgiven you for it.� She only nodded again.

I felt the sudden urge to punish her. Oh, God, I wanted to whip her viciously; I wanted to make her scream and bleed and beg. But in her delicate state, I settled for suddenly tearing off her clothing. She wore no corset in her pregnancy, making access to her tits quite easily. I slapped her tits roughly, listening to her muffled screams, wondering how much she enjoyed it. It was always hard to tell with Mrs. Gainsley. 

After making her scream and wriggle for a time, and leaving my burning red handprints on her pale breasts, I straddled her hips. I only pulled down my trousers, again keeping my clothes on during playtime. As I fucked her fast and hard, concerned not for her pleasure, I made her a promise. �This is our last time, Beatrice,� I hissed, pounding into her. �This is the last time I use your body for my pleasure, whore, and I&#8217;m giving you nothing back.� I said nothing else as I pounded into her, my vision blurring with my rage. Wanting to further her discomfort, I pulled out and came all over her face, something I had not done to Mrs. Gainsley before, always being tempted to be gentler with her.

Ha! My soft feelings for her were gone, and would never be restored. I untied her, and allowed her to stretch out her aching limbs. �You may stay in your old bedchamber,� I said, directing her from the room. �Get some rest. We will be leaving in only a couple of days.� I walked her to the east wing, in silence, and locked her into the room. Before I closed the door, she turned to me.

�Please, Aaron��

�Silence,� I said. �Clean up and go to sleep. I will bring you your dinner. You sister will be here to see you today, I&#8217;m sure.� Without another word, I slammed the door, locked it, and left her alone to sob. Again, I was quite unmoved by her tears.


I wasted no time. That afternoon, I spoke with Shelton and his wife together about the situation. He was amazed, and as Mrs. Shelton had predicted, most eager to go along with our plans. He even wanted to help finance my travels, as though I were in need of his funds. �I am leaving hastily, and you will have to pick up the slack for me in my absence,� I said, clapping a hand on my partner&#8217;s shoulder. 

�I&#8217;ll do that,� he said. �I&#8217;ll work round the clock, if you&#8217;ll only bring Joseph and Alice back!�

I accompanied the party to Oakridge Manor, seeing to the house that I owned and had not stepped into in years. The same couple of servants who had worked there for years were still under my employ, and would continue to keep the house for my family. I made sure to locate the best doctor in the area, for Mrs. Gainsley&#8217;s inevitable childbirth and in case any of the other children were to fall ill. 

Once I was satisfied that they were all settled, and that Mrs. Shelton would be able to exercise control over her sister, I was ready to be off. I kissed and hugged my children briefly, not knowing that I would never see my son again. In spite of his sister&#8217;s loving care and attention, we would lose him soon. Perhaps I sensed that, as he weakly said, �Goodbye, Daddy,� and how frail he felt when I held him. Had I stayed, would he have lived? I will never know this.

I went straight to London, and from there, my travels proceeded smoothly. I was quite grateful to be admitted on a large ship leaving for New York the following day, staying in a standard passenger cabin. I did not socialize or flirt during my travels; I kept to myself and focused on my plans. I even resisted the urge to pleasure myself, wanting to save as much love as possible for my wife.

My dear Emily! Each day I drew steadily closer to her. From New York, I boarded a train to Chicago, and from Chicago, traveled along the newly-laid passenger lines all the way to the West coast. I marveled at the drastically changing scenery, for I had not spent much time in the United States, and then, only in New England, where my mother resided. But I did not allow my fascination to distract me for long. I arrived in San Francisco just shy of a month after departing from Oakridge Manor, and as I stepped off of the train, I suddenly felt quite exhausted. And truly, I had only just begun.

I decided to have a rest, just a short one, only long enough to restore my strength and prepare for the next step. I made my way to a plain-looking inn, bringing along the only trunk in my possession. I checked in, slept through the night in the small room, woke in the morning, and put on the suit that I had paid to have cleaned and the shoes that had been newly shined. I felt clear-headed and determined. I would have breakfast at this inn, then make my way through the city. I figured that I would have my best luck in the evening, in a pub, if I were to ask around about &#8216;Lydie Smithwick&#8217;s Place.&#8217; Certainly it would be well known.

But I would soon find my plans to be unnecessary as I made my way downstairs. The small dining room, though filled with the smells of cooking breakfast, was nearly empty. The only other occupant, in fact, was a young man, and I knew I was not mistaken in identifying him as Joseph Shelton.

Well! I stood for a moment, unseen at the bottom of the stairs, and smiled to myself. It had all come together so easily, since that package arrived. In spite of the troubles with Mrs. Gainsley, everything else had fallen into place, and here it was. I almost felt a little afraid. Emily was so close now, after so long, and what would she say upon seeing me? I willed myself calm, summoning my usual confident manner, and went right up to the young man.

�Mr. Shelton?� I asked calmly. He looked up, surprised.

�Yes? Do I know you, sir?� 

�No,� I said. I stuck out my hand. �I am in law practice with your brother. My name is Aaron Singer.�

I almost could not resist laughing out loud as the young man blanched. �Singer, you say?� he asked, accepting my outstretched hand. He motioned for me to join him.

�Yes,� I said. �You are an acquaintance of my wife, Emily?� He nodded wordlessly, and I did laugh a little then. �Take a breath, young man, and let me tell you a very interesting story.�


Joseph Shelton was no less surprised when I finished explaining the situation to him. �I have come here to take my wife home,� I said. �And you and Alice would be quite welcome, and are most encouraged, to come along. Your brother has proven himself to be a friend of mine, and he would be very happy to have all of his family together again.�

The young man was eager to be home, to see his family again. He was most pleased when he learned that he first nephew was named for him. �When we were younger, and Danny started working for that lawyer, I had to just let him go his own way,� he said. He looked proud. �He&#8217;s made something of himself.�

�He wants to help you,� I said. �I&#8217;d like to help you as well�but you must help me first.� The first thing that I asked him to do was take me to my wife.

�She was at church,� he said thoughtfully. He checked his battered pocket watch. �Surely she would be finished with that by now?�

�It is important that I see her right away, but that I am not seen by Mrs. Morrison,� I said. At his puzzled look, I amended, �Mrs. Smithwick, rather.�

He leaned in close to me. �She really killed her husband?�

�Mutilated him, shot him, and had his body thrown into the ocean,� I said grimly. �She is a manic, and my wife has been her hostage.�

�I didn&#8217;t know any of this,� Joseph said. He had already heard all of this, but he was still in disbelief.

�How might you arrange for me to meet with Emily?� I asked. I imagined that he could bring her there, that she could stay with me in my little room while we came up with a plan. 

Instead he said, �She may be at my cottage. It is in the back of the property, and we wouldn&#8217;t have a problem getting you back there. You would not even be spotted from the house if you kept to the trees.�

I nodded, imagining that Emily would be having a pleasant afternoon tea with young Alice Shelton. I imagined her flushing at the sight of me, jumping up from her seat and rushing to greet me with tears in her lovely eyes. My heart began to pound.

I forced myself to eat, and I paid for both of our meals before Joseph led me out. The place was not far from the inn at all, actually, only a couple of blocks away. The streets that we passed were crowded; though the businesses were closed, people in their Sunday clothes were wandering about, and we blended in with the crowd. I had no fear of being spotted by Lydia Morrison, but I realized that, if I were to confront her, I did not yet know what I would say or do.

As Joseph suggested, we walked in the trees around the perimeter of the property. I could see the house somewhat through the trees, looking much as Emily had described. I wondered when I might see the inside of it, how I might ultimately get the run of it.

We arrived at the cabin. My heart was racing, blood pounding in my ears, as Joseph led me through the door. But no one was sitting in the small, open sitting room or kitchen. Joseph motioned up the stairs. �She may be up there,� he said without looking at me. The stairs led to a small loft and two doors, both closed. I climbed up the steep steps alone, slowly.

I entered the first room, and found it darkened, the heavy curtains drawn over the small window. A figure on the bed stirred and sat up. �Joseph, you certainly have kept me waiting!� she declared, sitting up and stretching, exposing her pert breasts. She yawned slightly, and looked at me. It took her a moment to register who I was, and she gasped, covering herself. �Sir!� she cried in surprise.

I smiled and closed the door behind me. �Covering yourself against me, Emily? Come and say hello.� I knew what finding her this way meant, and it explained her lack of writing over the past couple of years. But I was not angry, far from it, and I smiled warmly to show her.

She let the covers drop from her, but rose hesitantly, her eyes fearful. My own darling, afraid of me? I had expected a much warmer and excited welcome from her. But when she stepped naked from the bed, entirely exposed to me, I saw the reason for her fear as my eyes fell upon her swollen belly. I met her eyes, and they were filled with tears. �Oh, sir,� she whispered, �It wasn&#8217;t supposed to be this way.�

�Come to me,� I said, and she stepped into my arms, sobbing helplessly against me. When she began to attempt to speak, I quieted her. �We have much to explain to one another, my dear,� I said, holding her against me. �I daresay that we will be talking through the night. But let&#8217;s not say a word to distress one another until we have consummated our reunion.�

She lifted her head from my chest and looked at me in surprise. I tenderly seized her chin and kissed her softly, though my overwhelming lust overtook me, and we were very quickly on the bed. As I threw off my clothes hastily and my wife lay back, spreading her legs for me and biting her lip in eager apprehension, I remembered our last time alone together, in the bright garden in Barcelona. I had fucked her then with no restraints, and that afternoon, after so many years apart, it was the same.

I held down her slender wrists and for a moment, we stared into each other&#8217;s eyes. I could hardly believe what was happening; I think she felt the same way. I found myself whispering, �Don&#8217;t be distressed, Emily, your friend is here to help you. Are you not glad to see me?�

�Oh, sir,� she whispered, �I&#8217;ve longed for you. Oh, sir, please forgive me!�

�Silence, whore,� I purred in her ear, and I felt her hold her breath, anticipating my next words. �Right now, I do not care what you have done. What are you going to do for me now, Emily?�

�Oh, sir, I&#8217;m yours,� she whispered, tilting her head back, exposing her soft white neck. I nibbled at her, and she gasped, her hips pressed against mine. Her belly, though visibly pregnant, was not deliciously huge, not yet, but I felt her bump against my stomach as I leaned into her, running my hands over her breasts, her rounded stomach, her wide hips. 

�That&#8217;s right, darling, you&#8217;re mine,� I whispered. I briefly touched the gold wedding band around her finger. She still wore it, by God! The bitch from hell had at least not taken that from her, and I felt a surge of gratitude. No matter what, she had been mine all along.

�Have me, sir,� she begged, more pointedly thrusting her hips against mine, grinding against my crotch, �I have craved you sir, please, I need you.�

Well, if she&#8217;d been properly satisfied while we were apart, she certainly put on a good show of covering it up. Eager as she was, I wanted to drag it out a bit, make her wait. I took my time, grasping her wrists again and tasting her sweet body, suckling softly on her nipples for a moment, imaging that soon, quite soon, I would be drinking her delicious milk again. Was I dreaming?

I had to look up for a moment, look into her eyes, and make sure that I wasn&#8217;t pretending again, that it wouldn&#8217;t be an earnest-looking Mrs. Gainsley or hooded-eyed Mrs. Shelton looking back at me. It was wide-eyed Emily, smiling slightly, but looking just a bit distressed. I leaned toward her and kissed her softly again, tightening my grasp on her wrists until I felt that I was crushing her.

I released her wrists as I ran my hands down her arms, down her sides, as I kissed her stomach. She grasped the pillow behind her head and moaned softly, longing for me, her breath becoming shallow as my lips trailed down to her (still very well-groomed) pussy. From there, I felt I could waste little more time as I lapped at her in preparation, encouraged by her gasps.

As I prepared to enter her (she was so incredibly wet for me, it was glorious), she gazed up into my eyes. �Oh, sir, I love you. I have missed you so!�

�I love you, too, my Emily,� I said. I slid gently into her, and lo! It was a perfect fit, and I held myself inside of her for a moment, safely tucked in where I belonged. �We are together now, darling, everything will be good again, I promise.�

�Oh, sir,� she moaned, raising her hips as I fucked her slowly. She moved her hips enthusiastically, and we were in a perfect rhythm again. I held her wrists down once again, bruising her, as I began to fuck her more quickly. She encouraged me with her soft whimpers. �Oh, God, sir, fuck me harder, sir, I need it.� When I&#8217;d fucked one of my other whores and tried to invoke the image of my Emily I would close my eyes, and try to remember the details of her face in ecstasy. I was unable to take my eyes off of her as I fucked her in her lover&#8217;s bed, even as I began to massage her tits roughly. She lifted her legs, not without some difficulty, and I shoved myself deeper inside of her.

Our reunion was no disappointment, to be sure. Weeks of self-denial were relieved that afternoon, and when I made my Emily come twice before releasing my painful load into her, I knew she had enjoyed it as well. I could not resist the old game of cleaning after fucking, and I swallowed up her mess first, finishing off by licking her inner thighs as she giggled. She next went to her knees for me as I sat on the side of the bed, and cleaned me off with her long, eager tongue.

When finished with her task, she stayed on her knees and looked up at me, her gaze a mixture of adoration and uncertainty. �Oh, sir,� she finally said, �What are we going to do now?�

I gave my wife a brief, contemplative look. For the first time, I noticed that she did look older. Well, certainly, she was in her late 20&#8217;s now. She was no less beautiful, though. Her hair, worn loose (for she no longer bothered with curls or fancy styles), was as long and glossy as ever, and her skin was still soft and pale, with a slight warm flush. If possible, she was more beautiful now than ever, and I felt confident that she would only grow lovelier in the years to come. And she would do so by my side.

I touched her face. �My darling,� I said, �There is much to do, I know. We must formulate a plan against your dear &#8216;Mother...&#8217;�

�Oh, sir, do not call her that, even in jest!� Emily cried, and I chuckled softly. �I am serious, sir. I do hate her.�

I was surprised to hear these words, as she had insisted, even in her very darkest moments, that she could not hate the woman who had wronged her so. �We have much to discuss, much to plan,� I said again. �But before we get down to it, perhaps you would not mind sucking my cock?� For indeed, the mere sight of my darling, on her knees before me (pregnant at that, even if it were not with my child), had caused me to go hard again.

Emily grasped my cock lovingly in her hand with a smile. �Of course not, sir. I would love to taste you again.�

�You are still my slave, are you not, darling?� I asked softly. She looked up at me, and smiled sweetly.

�Yes, sir,� she said. �I&#8217;ve always been yours, sir.� And the warmth of her sweet mouth around my throbbing cock, after spending so much time apart�heavenly.




 

















Lady Emily&#8217;s Letters

11 January, 18&#8212;

Dear Tatiana,

It feels so wonderful to be able to freely write to you at last! I have so much to tell you, my friend, but I will begin with a greeting to my precious Mina, as it is her 10th birthday today. My little darling! Though this greeting with reach her late, let her know that Mummy was thinking of her, as I do every single day. Give my children an extra kiss for me, dear, and tell them that I love them so.

My dear friend! Many congratulations at all of your recent blessings, as my dear husband has filled me in. And to think, you are married and have bore a child with the twin brother of the man I have known quite intimately. Such a very small world indeed! My husband says that you were delighted to hear that your brother- and sister-in-law were both safe and well, and would be coming home to you soon. Though I must admit, I do not yet know when this will be.

I must tell you straight, my friend, as I&#8217;ve always been able to be so with you, that I am with child myself. And yes, the father is your own brother-in-law�making my new child your own son&#8217;s cousin. The idea of it makes my head spin. Though I know I will love this child, I am ashamed of how complicated I have made things. But I could not resist my urges, and I know that you understand that better than anyone.

My husband understands. He has been so forgiving of me. Indeed, he has begged forgiveness himself, for �allowing� your sister to fool us all. I cannot bring myself to write to her directly, but do tell her that I understand why she did it. I am still willing to consider her my friend, after all that has passed. I do not wish to write more on that; I will speak on it with her when we return. Do be sure that she is well in her pregnancy. I would prefer that you all were home, at Wainwright Hall, but my husband insists that you all stay where you are for the time being. It is him that we must all obey.

You aided him in his darkest moments, and for that I cannot thank you enough. I can admit to you that I find him more irresistible than ever. Imagine my mortification when he came upon me, waiting for Joseph in his bed! But we quickly came to terms with our respective indiscretions, and have agreed to forgive one another, and to raise each other&#8217;s children together and to be happy again. After our reunion in Joseph&#8217;s bedroom, and our long talk as we lay under the covers afterwards, I would have given anything to be home again, to begin all over. But my dear husband reminded me that we still had much to be done.

Mr. Singer says that he shared with you the letters that I had sent, so I will assume that you are familiar with my situation with Mrs. Morrison. We both agreed that killing her simply would not do, even if we could get away with it. I have so many reasons to hate her, and I often do, but�well, my friend, you know a little that my relationship with her was always quite complicated. 

Well, I saw the truly ugly side of Lydia late on Christmas, two years past. That was the night that I was driven into Joseph&#8217;s comforting arms by a tragedy. Natasha, my one-time lover and one of Lydia&#8217;s prostitutes, died alone in her bed, where she was resting alone after serving a client. At least, that is what we were all made to believe. I had a suspicion that the man, an overly enthusiastic dominant, perhaps, had killed her in play, and had stowed the body upstairs when no one was around. 

I was sitting alone in the garden when I heard the commotion, when Natasha&#8217;s body was found. I had been smoking marijuana (my husband says that you laughed heartily when you read that in the other letter�no, dear, I won&#8217;t be bringing any back with me!), and was sitting alone, just staring up at the night sky, I believe, allowing my thoughts to wander, but pleasantly. They did not plague me, but rather drifted, and I did nothing to chase them, just allowed them to float away without further reflection. I may have been humming a tune to myself, perhaps.

But I was snapped from my little reverie by shouting from the back door. I turned and saw Joseph coming out toward me. �Mrs. Singer,� he said, �There you are. Something has happened.�

�What is it?� I asked, reading the panic on his face. I instantly imagined a brawl too huge for him to handle, the police arriving to make arrests (or more likely, take a larger payout). Things had never gotten out of hand at the place before.

�It&#8217;s Natasha,� Joseph said. �Mrs. Singer, she has passed away.�

I was confused�surely I had not heard correctly? Joseph told me what had happened, that a wagon was coming for her, but the doctor had already declared her to be dead. I may have been hysterical, I may have been perfectly calm�I admit, I cannot remember, as I was quite high still. But I did eventually begin to cry, and Joseph comforted me until I had calmed myself.

By the time he accompanied me into the parlor, the police had come and gone, and only Lydia and a couple of the girls sat there, the clients having taken off into the night. �Oh, there you are, have you heard about it, darling?� Lydia asked, coming to embrace me. �So tragic and sudden! The doctor believes she was using laudanum��

I allowed her to hold me, but I was struck by her words. I knew Natasha to use her marijuana, but I never knew her to drink, let alone use opium. �Is that true?� I asked Maggie and Nancy, who were sitting by. Neither could answer.

�Lydia, who was with Natasha before�before she was noticed�� I could not bring myself to say the words.

Lydia looked thoughtful. She told me the man&#8217;s name, but I never did remember it. He was another one of the wealthy clients, whom she bent over backwards (quite literally) to please. Or rather, she had the girls do that for her. I quite imagined that the man had somehow caused her death, but Lydia brushed aside my concerns.

I had to wonder, as Lydia chased the other girls from the room, if Lydia knew more of what had really happened. Natasha had been so young. And she was healthy, never complaining of illness or headaches as the other girls sometimes did. I do worry for the health of these girls, Tatiana. I have sometimes imagined that you would enjoy a little time in this place, with some of the wild clients, but all the time, with so many men�it cannot be healthy, I am sure.

Lydia sat beside me on her hideous overstuffed pink couch and held me. �This is such awful luck, my pet,� she sighed. �And everything&#8217;s been going so well, too. What an awful thing to spoil our Christmas!�

�Poor Natasha,� I whispered.

�Indeed,� Lydia said. She sighed again. �Well, my little pet, I assume that you want to take care of the funeral arrangements yourself?� I nodded, for who else would make sure that the poor thing was properly buried? I knew that she was not Catholic, but I could think of no way to give her a ceremony honoring her heritage, for I knew nothing of Dine funeral rites. I correctly surmised that my priest and confessor would aid me in at least providing her with a respectable funeral and praying over her.

�Don&#8217;t be tempted to spend so much on her,� Lydia teased, cutting into my thoughts. �It&#8217;s not as though the girl had any family.�

�Lydia, please,� I snapped, for Tatiana, as you know, when I was just a tiny girl the same could be said about me. �Natasha has died, you really must be more sensitive.�

Lydia laughed lightly. �I&#8217;m sorry, my pet. I know she was your little playmate.�

�She was no playmate,� I said, and I stood from the couch. �Do you have to be so cold, Lydia? She worked for you, she died under your roof��

�I know this well, Emily,� Lydia said, rising as well. �Do you think I enjoy having the police coming in here asking questions? Oh, but I should have expected something like this to happen. She was a troubled thing�all these types are. I wanted to have fun and adventure, my little pet, and this has all been a terrible inconvenience.�

�A person&#8217;s death is an inconvenience to you?� I asked. Tatiana, my dear friend, I have never killed anyone (by the by, I will be concealing this letter quite cleverly within a package to Oakridge Manor, so do not worry for our privacy), so I do not know what it feels like. I do remember the look on your face, that summer night (so long ago!) at Wainwright Hall. Shock and despair, even in your victory. You did not revel in what you had done, but you knew that the ends, somehow, would justify the means. I wonder, do you feel this way anymore, after all that has happened? It is all so tangled, my friend�if we all come out of this well, I daresay that it was all worth it, that everything does happen for a reason, as my dear Mr. Singer has always been fond of saying.

But dear, I never saw any such mixture of emotions on Lydia&#8217;s face whenever she spoke of killing her husband. She only seemed to glow, as though killing him had given her some kind of high. It is somewhat like the look that she always gets when she has dominated me (those days are now over, as I will very soon explain). I used to be enraptured by that look, I thought she was so lovely and powerful, but now it scares me. She has no remorse for anything that she does, and I knew that she would not shed one tear for Natasha.

I left her in frustration, going back out into the garden. I intended to sit alone, perhaps to cry again. Poor Natasha! But I found Joseph there, sitting on the bench that I had previously occupied. He stood to greet me. I said, �She is a cold, callous, heartless thing!�

�Yes,� Joseph agreed. �Mrs. Singer, will you sit with me? I have something to tell you.� I joined him, and he revealed what he had witnessed. Lydia had gone down to the cellar with the client and Natasha; the three of them had been down there alone. �I was standing by the cellar door just outside the parlor, when Mrs. Smithwick came upstairs. Natasha was hanging on the client&#8217;s arm. I asked Mrs. Smithwick if she was all right, and she said, &#8216;Oh, she&#8217;s quite fine, just had a little too much to drink, I believe. We&#8217;re going upstairs for a little more playtime.&#8217; And she pinched my cheek in that obnoxious way of hers and�I did not see Natasha again until the men from the morgue were carrying her body down.�

I was reeling from the news. Lydia herself may have been�probably was�responsible for Natasha&#8217;s death! Had she done this on purpose, because she knew that I had feelings for her? Conflicted as I had been over Natasha, I knew that I could have loved her, if I had let myself. 

�Mrs. Singer,� Joseph said after a moment, after allowing me to gather my thoughts, �I have not yet shared this information with the police. I do not know if any of the other girls know what happened, more or less than I do�I believe that she threatened them not to say anything. But I didn&#8217;t want to go to the police until I had spoken with you.�

I was to decide! Well, my friend, I was in quite a bind then. If Lydia were sent to jail for her crime, I might be free of her. Then again, she might reveal our secrets, or order her coconspirator (I still cannot believe that it was Beatrice all along!) to go to the police in our county, and we would be ruined. How could I run that risk, especially when I knew that you were married, and that my husband and children were still waiting for me? 

�Please, Joseph,� I said, �Do not go to the police. I�I cared very much for Natasha, I hope that you know this.�

�But Mrs. Smithwick is your friend,� Joseph said, and I did not contradict him on this point.

�It would do more harm than good to go to the police,� I said, and I never did explain this to him further. He&#8217;s up to speed on everything now, thanks to my dear husband&#8217;s arrival, but until that day, I had not told him everything. 

He trusted my word, and he promised not to go. �I am planning her funeral,� I said, and he allowed me, in my shocked and grief-stricken state, to talk on about the types of flowers that I might purchase, and where I might find a decent coffin for her. How we went from that morbid talk to his bed, I cannot clearly remember, either, for much of that night remains a blur.

The next morning, I was so ridden with guilt that I wanted to die. That guilt, in many ways, has stayed with me since that day. I am still not entirely rid of it, though my husband has assured me that I entirely forgiven. You know that I regard my dear Mr. Singer as my owner, my master, and this has never ceased to be so, even in our time apart.

Well, when I told my dear husband about that awful Christmas night when Natasha died, and when I covered for Lydia to keep ourselves out of trouble, he was amazed. �And you have been seeing Joseph regularly since then?�

�Yes, sir,� I said, ashamed again. �Almost every day, these past two years.� I cried, for it has pained me to carry another man&#8217;s child, though I always knew that the risk was there. I did not yet know that I was pregnant when I&#8217;d sent that package off with Billy Mosley, back in September. I had not told Mr. Singer that I had been seeing another man. A part of me believed that he would not come for me if he knew this.

He laughed at me when I confessed my fear. �Not come for you?� he echoed. �Emily, you belong to me. I came halfway around the world to have you back, and I do not regret the journey.� Oh, he is the sweetest man, Tatiana! I owe him everything! 

�A long time has passed since that happened,� my husband went on. �Has anything else come of Natasha&#8217;s death?�

�No,� I said. �I tried to speak with Lydia about it a couple of times, but�she would always brush me off.�

�What about the other girls?� he asked.

I remembered one brief conversation with Maggie, perhaps a few months after Natasha&#8217;s death. We were alone in the kitchen. She had come upon me putting a kettle on, and had cried out, �Oh, excuse me, Mrs. Singer!� and had started to back away.

I laughed lightly at her timidity. �Come in, Maggie, dear, you are not bothering me,� I said, beckoning to her, and she joined me hesitantly. �How are you today, dear?� I asked kindly, and she sat with me at the table for a cup of tea. She seemed particularly nervous that day, and she revealed that she&#8217;d had a confrontation with Mrs. Smithwick, something that always left her shaken. I knew that Lydia liked to pick on the poor girl, knowing how timid she was. I do detest a bully, and I know that you share my sentiments in that regard.

�I try to stay out of her way,� Maggie said nervously, as though afraid that I would chastise her myself (as if I ever have!).

�I know,� I said comfortingly. �You know how Mrs. Smithwick gets. She has her moods�you mustn&#8217;t take it personally, dear.�

�She was nicer for a while, after Christmas,� Maggie said. �I thought she liked me because I helped her.�

�How did you help her, Maggie?� I asked lightly. I felt that she had something significant to say, but I didn&#8217;t want to scare her.

Alas, she caught her error. Her pale face lit up in a flush. �Oh, just by calming down all the clients, you know, and talking to the police,� she said. She was eager to leave then, and I allowed her to back away. I sighed, knowing that she would never tell me any more.

I did not think I would have any more luck with Nancy, so I did not make the attempt. Nancy is a bit bolder than her friend (cousin? I&#8217;ve known these girls for some time now, and I still have not been able to determine this one way or the other), but when backed into a corner, she becomes just as skittish, though she does not kowtow to Lydia as Maggie does. 

My husband began to ask me questions about the place since that night. I told him that Amalia was no longer with us, as she had run away to Los Angeles, but Jiao, Maggie, and Nancy still resided and worked in the house, as well as Ester, a young girl who also came from a family of migrant workers to San Francisco. �And, how does Lydia get along with the girls now?� he asked.

Her relationship is much the same with them, if not worse, I believe. Maggie still cowers; Nancy still avoids her. Jiao silently despises Lydia&#8217;s oppressive ways, and Ester is almost as timid as poor Maggie. �Not loyal to her, are they?� Mr. Singer asked. I would daresay that they are not; they are loyal to the generous pay that they receive, which, again, is in my control. �Darling,� my husband said, �I have a very wicked idea for our old friend, but it will require the cooperation of the girls.� He revealed to me what my role would be in this, and after we hesitantly dressed and went downstairs, we spoke with Joseph about it, and he (hating Lydia as much as anyone else) was eager to go along with it.

It was beginning to darken outside, and if I were to begin my part in the plan, I had to leave my husband for a while. I kissed him, right in front of Joseph (for though I care for your brother-in-law very much, he is not my dearest love). �I really will see you again in a few hours?� I asked, not wanting to go from him.

He smiled encouragingly. �I&#8217;ll come to you, darling. It&#8217;s all right, Emily. Do you want to go through will this?�

I did. It was an excellent plan, and I had no doubt that Lydia would fall right into my husband&#8217;s trap. I was laying out some very temping bait. I kissed him again, and parted, leaving the men to begin their part of the plan (namely, gathering the girls one-by-one to meet Mr. Singer and explain everything, and convincing them to go along with it) as I sought out Lydia.

I found her in our bedchamber, of course, in front of her vanity. �Ah, there&#8217;s my pet!� she trilled. �Did you have a fun afternoon with your little boy toy?�

�Yes, Lydia,� I said, sitting on the bed. She knew of my relationship with Joseph, of course. She was jealous, especially when she found out that I was pregnant, but she still allowed me to be with him. Still, I knew that it hurt her, and though I am ashamed to be so petty, I enjoyed making her feel badly. And I was going to be using that against her that very night. �We had a long talk this afternoon. About you.�

�Oh, I&#8217;m sure he had much to say on the subject,� she laughed. She knows that he loathes her; she pretends that she does not care.

�Oh, yes,� I said earnestly. �You know, Lydia, he&#8217;s always shown an interest in the games that we play together, but I have never been able to convince him to play along with us�until now.�

�What&#8217;s that you say, pet?� Lydia said with interest. She&#8217;d had her eye on handsome young Joseph for some time. 

I forced a giggle. �Lydia, he wants to join us tonight in the cellar, after the clients have all left for the evening. Oh, say yes! It would be so much fun.�

Lydia looked thoughtful. �It has been so long since Mother and her little pet had someone else to play with,� she said. �Would this make my horny little pet excited?�

�Oh, yes, Lydia, I would love it,� I said. My enthusiasm was not at all forced, for I was imagining a scenario quite different than the one I was painting for her.

Lydia kissed me softly. �Naughty pet,� she murmured. �Now I will be thinking of this all night. Well, so be it, dear. We will have our little playtime with Joseph in the wee hours of the morning.�

�Oh, thank you, Lydia,� I said. I beamed. �I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll ever forget this night.�

I will describe it all to you in detail in my next letter, Tatiana. I plan to write as soon as possible, though our plan is still in motion, and it keeps us quite busy. My husband is calling for me, so I must join him in the cellar. 

Take care, my dearest friend. Give my love to my children, and to your own little boy. And to Beatrice as well�I do still love her.

Much love,

Lady Emily


12 January, 18&#8212;

Dear Tatiana,

I had only just sent out the last letter (tucked into a package of clothing for the children), when, upon arriving home, my husband met me in the kitchen of the house. We have been staying in the room that Lydia and I have shared. She is alone in the cellar, as she has been for the past week. It was all fun at first, my friend, but now�I do wish that it were all over with, and that we were on our way home!

My husband bade me to rest alone in �our� room; I believe that he is now in the cellar, having a talk with Lydia, perhaps trying again to convince her to do what is right. My husband is trying to be lenient with her; he only asks her to let me go, sell the house and her business, and just go far away. He doesn&#8217;t even wish to turn her in for killing her husband (the poor, dear man). But she is being stubborn. I daresay that she is enjoying what we are doing to her.

Allow me to explain. That first night (only a week ago already!), I did as my husband instructed and went about my normal business while Lydia&#8217;s place was open. I sat in the office and pulled out the books, but I certainly could not concentrate on any of the numbers. It would not matter soon, anyway, as my husband would be barring the doors the following morning. I did not care if Joseph even collected any of the open tabs that night.

At one point, around midnight, Maggie came in to see me. I don&#8217;t believe she has ever come into the office to speak with me on her own, though Nancy frequently takes her breaks there. �Mrs. Singer?� she asked softly.

�Yes, dear,� I said, �Come in and close the door, will you?�

She did so, and came to my desk. Her face was difficult to read. Usually, she walks around looking frightened, but she didn&#8217;t look afraid as she came to me. �I�I just met your husband?�

I smiled at the mention of him (for just the idea of him never fails to brighten me). �You had a chance to speak with him, then?� She nodded. �What do you think, Maggie?�

�I�I want to help,� she said shyly. �Nancy will go along with it, too, I&#8217;m sure. She&#8217;s with a client now, but Joseph is going to grab her when she&#8217;s finished��

�I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re on my side, Maggie,� I said. I stood and went to her, taking her gently by the hand. 

�She&#8217;s a nasty old bitch,� she said, and hearing such harsh language from her was surprising. �She did such terrible things to you.�

�She&#8217;s done terrible things to many people,� I said sadly. �She has not been very kind to you, either. Did my husband tell you how he would let you get your revenge?�

�I can&#8217;t wait,� she said, and I saw a strange glow in her eyes, something I hadn&#8217;t seen before. She looked quite beautiful then. I always thought that Maggie was lovely, in a very delicate way, but she looked less delicate that night. �Mrs. Singer�Lady Emily�your husband��

�He&#8217;s wonderful, isn&#8217;t he?� I sighed, and she nodded in agreement. I had no doubt then that he would be able to get all of the girls to see things his way.

So as to not arouse Lydia&#8217;s suspicion, Maggie left me, and I anxiously waited alone. I even attempted to lie down for a nap, as I might usually do. No chance of that, though that was not unusual in itself. But that night, I was so excited for what was going to happen. I was soon up and dressed again, just in time for Lydia herself to pop in on me.

�Oh, my pet,� she murmured, approaching me, and as I stepped into her embrace, I feared for a moment that she had found out our plans. But she kissed me, and I knew she was clueless still. �I haven&#8217;t been able to stop thinking about you tonight, Emily. Touch Mother, pet, feel how wet I am��

Because she wore only a slip and her robe over her corset, I had easy access to her pussy. I did not hesitate in reaching down and stroking her, feeling her clit peeking out, and I swore I could feel it pulsing lightly. She was, indeed, soaking. The lightly groomed hair on her pussy was completely wet. Before I could begin fingering her, she took hold of my wrist.

�No, naughty pet. Taste Mother.�

Again without hesitation, I put my moist fingers to my lips. She smelled strong, musky, not at all unpleasant. I admit, my friend, I do take comfort in her scent, in a strange way. I put my fingers in my mouth and sucked away her tangy juices, and she grinned madly. My nipples hardened as I imagined what my husband and I had in store for her.

She kissed me again and said, �You&#8217;ll meet me in the cellar in two hours, pet? Do not keep Mother waiting.�

�I won&#8217;t, Lydia,� I said. �I promise.�

She left me again, and I was alone for only a short time. Another knock came on the door. I sat at my desk again, and called, �Come in.� I stood abruptly when Joseph entered with my husband, and I went to him as Joseph closed and carefully locked the door. I stepped into his loving embrace, feeling so relieved. A part of me had been afraid that the whole thing was a strange dream.

�All the young ladies are on board,� Mr. Singer said triumphantly. �They are kindly, wretched little creatures, aren&#8217;t they?�

�I want to help them, sir,� I blurted. �Oh, sir, can&#8217;t we sell the house and give them all the money? Couldn&#8217;t we?�

My husband laughed and kissed me softly. �My charitable darling. We&#8217;ll help your friends any way we can, if they are so willing to help us.� It seems to me that my dear husband has not changed at all, Tatiana, and I am so relieved of this! He is the same wonderful, handsome, strong, kindly man that I have loved all of my life. I am afraid, though I do not tell him so, that I am much changed. I still do not know how much, and I am very afraid of finding out.

Mr. Singer explained the next part of the plan. He would stay in the office with me while Joseph kept watch. He knew that Lydia would be with a client upstairs very soon, and when she disappeared, he would usher us to the cellar, where we would wait for Lydia to close up the house and join us. He would overtake her, and�well, from there, I will explain in a bit more detail.

When we were in the cellar, I showed my husband the implements of torment and pleasure that Lydia so often used on her clients (and on me). To the wall, she&#8217;d had built a large upstanding rack, with crossbars to allow for neck or head restraint. There was also a small platform that folded out from the wall, about three feet from the floor, which forced the bound prisoner to stand on his or her toes. My husband helped me up and I demonstrated for him, stretching out my unbound arms (the tips of my fingers hardly brushed the sides of the rack) and standing uneasily on my toes. Mr. Singer braced himself before me, ready to catch me if I were to fall. In fact, he encouraged me to jump down into his arms, and he caught me, placing me easily on my feet again. I am so safe with him.

I pointed out the various chains hanging from the ceiling, and showed my husband the tall bed with the thick mattress and the tall, sturdy bedposts. I refused to allow Lydia to place me on that mattress, knowing how many strange men had cum on it. The bed was covered with cotton sheets, faded from their frequent washings. My husband, grinning, stripped the bed of these, revealing the old mattress, covered in many nasty stains.

�Yes,� he said, �this will do for her.� 

I also showed Mr. Singer her trunk of toys. Much of these are similar to the ones that he and I have played with so often (and you are no stranger to, I know), though she does possess a number of wicked flogging devices that my dear husband wouldn&#8217;t have the heart to use. At least, I thought he wouldn&#8217;t have the heart to use them.

He looked thoughtful, and I knew that his imaginative mind was forming plans for his enemy. I was excited again, and because we had some time, he stripped me and tied me to that same rack, and fucked me quickly. I longed to tear open his shirt and feel his warm chest against my tits, my swollen belly against his bare groin. I even whispered, �Oh, sir, please take off your shirt, sir, I want to feel you��

He continued to fuck me gracefully, but he grinned at my request. Slowly unbuttoning, not ceasing in his rhythm, he murmured, �You do love me, don&#8217;t you, Emily?�

�Oh, sir, of course I do,� I moaned. He was bare-chested but leaning away from me a little, still fucking me, but just out of reach of my tits. Oh, you know as well as I that he can be a cruel master at times! �Sir, I love you, I need you, sir��

He looked at me almost gravely for a moment. �I need you, too, darling,� he whispered. He leaned into me, and I wriggled in my restraints, rubbing my tits against his broad, smooth chest as he nibbled on my earlobe. �Oh, Emily, I love you so much. You can&#8217;t leave me again, darling, you must promise me.�

�Oh, never, sir!� I cried, and moaned as he pounded me harder, rubbing against my clit. I continued to wriggle on the rack. �I promise, sir, I promise, I promise��

�You&#8217;re mine, Emily,� he grunted insistently, fucking me so hard that his face turned red. I had not been fucked so hard in so long and I groaned, screaming, knowing that nobody upstairs would hear us. He stared into my eyes, and I saw that familiar wicked glow, intensified as he said, �Say it, Emily, tell me that you&#8217;re mine!�

�I&#8217;m yours, sir!� I cried, and screamed as I came. Oh, Tatiana, I swear it was the most intense orgasm of my entire life, it felt so wonderful that for a moment I wanted to die, believing that it couldn&#8217;t possibly ever be so passionate or fantastic ever again. My husband filled me with his warm love, and it dripped from me when he extracted himself. He buttoned up his shirt calmly, though his hands trembled a bit, and he smiled at me lovingly.

�I think you&#8217;ll just stay right there for the time being,� he said, and I giggled as he stepped to me and ran his hand teasingly down my bare side. �Where does she keep the gags, love?�

�They&#8217;re in the same trunk,� I said, and was disappointed when he stepped away. He dug out a gag to meet his needs, but it was not for me. No; when he returned to me, he took his handkerchief from his pocket and stuffed that into my willing mouth. He touched my face tenderly. 

�My pretty Emily,� he cooed. �My sweet, sweet darling. I have dreamed of being with you again. We&#8217;ll be home soon, little girl,� he whispered, massaging my tits. I moaned and leaned into his touch. �We&#8217;ll be home with our children, and our friends, everyone who loves and adores you. And you&#8217;ll be all mine again, little Lady Emily, all mine. We&#8217;ll have our playmates, but you&#8217;ll only belong to your old friend, won&#8217;t you, love?�

I nodded eagerly. Oh, you don&#8217;t know how good it felt to hear these words. Nothing else that he could have said would have given me more comfort, would have made me feel more loved or wanted or understood. He put his hands on my waist and kissed my neck slowly as I quivered. For a little while, he rested against me, his lips brushing against the most sensitive part of my neck, and he held me, pulling away only when Joseph returned to the basement.

�We are closed up,� he reported. �Lydia will be along shortly. The girls will be standing by.�

I let out a declaration of excitement, muffled by the gag, and my husband laughed at me softly. Joseph did not look surprised to see me in that state. I will tell you that he is not inclined to such games, though I have had him restrain me at times. I admit that I have not made much effort to indoctrinate him. I have only sought him out for the physical and emotional comfort that he has generously offered, and while he is a more than suitable lover, he�well, he isn&#8217;t my dear husband, now, is he? Still, I do care for him.

You might be wondering what Joseph&#8217;s feelings are about Mr. Singer&#8217;s sudden arrival. Well, I had the chance to speak with your brother-in-law, the father of the child I am carrying, a couple of days ago. I know that he loves me, for he has told me so many times, and I can see it in his eyes. He is an honest man, much as your husband is, as Mr. Singer reports. If your husband has half the good-heartedness of his twin brother, then you are very fortunate indeed.

I have not made it a secret to Joseph that I am devoted to my husband. I am so glad that my leaving will not mean leaving him behind, for he and Alice are my dear friends, and I do love them so. On the subject of Alice, she no longer stays at the cabin with her brother. She has been enrolled at a boarding school in the city, though she still attends services with me on Sunday and joins the both of us for lunch at a restaurant afterward. She never comes to the place anymore, thank God, and we have decided to keep her in her school until we depart from San Francisco (and I still am not certain when this will be!). 

Anyway, Joseph knows that I belong to my husband. I would never even take off my wedding ring when we were together. When we discussed the matter a couple of days ago, he said, �I knew this day would come. I mean, I didn&#8217;t think it would happen like this, and I certainly did not think that your husband would be connected to my family.�

�He&#8217;s convinced that this was all destined,� I said. �If you were concerned that he might have hard feelings toward you, you may cast your fears aside.�

Joseph nodded uneasily. �Your husband is a good man, Mrs. Singer, I can plainly see that. I do believe that he deserves you.� He sighed. �I suppose that this would mean that my child will be raised by him.�

�It&#8217;s the only way,� I said, taking his hand comfortingly. �Oh, but you will be no stranger to it! Your sister-in-law is my very best girlfriend, and she lives very close. I think that you would like the countryside, Joseph. I hope you will love it as I do and you will decide to stay with your brother.�

Joseph smiled at the idea as I continued to describe our lovely homeland for him. I recounted my husband&#8217;s story of how you taught your husband to ride, and he was so awkward at first, but now he must ride every day or he is restless. I was not at all displeased to learn that my husband had loaned you two of my favorite horses, and I invite you to keep them as a belated wedding gift, my friend. I told Joseph that we would all ride together. The thought of it, riding freely as we did when we were young, makes me ever more anxious to return home again.

I believe that Joseph is hurt that he will not be raising our child. Ah, but what can I do about it? I do not wish to seem heartless�it is just that we have so much else on our hands right now, and our troubles will not cease once we leave San Francisco, I am certain. I hope that with time, he will accept the situation, and that his happiness at being reunited with his family will dull the ache. These ideas did not stop me from crying alone after our conversation.

But back to the night in the cellar, when we captured Lydia. The three of us (me, bound to the rack; Joseph, at the bottom of the steps; my husband, hiding to the side, waiting to strike) waited in silence, and the tension in the cellar was thick when Lydia opened the door and descended the stairs alone.

Noticing me on the rack, she grinned at Joseph. �You&#8217;ve prepared her for me�thank you, Joseph,� she said, pinching his cheek. �I did not know you liked to play this way. Oh, we are going to have such fun tonight.�

�Indeed, we will,� my husband said, stepping to her sight. She balked at him, taking a step back in surprise.

�Aaron Singer!� she cried, unable to believe it. Joseph took hold of her, forcing her to face my husband. He calmly assessed her.

�You look quite well, Mrs. Morrison,� he said. �Yes, quite a proper whore you are. My Emily&#8217;s told me all about you.� He stepped closer to her, and Joseph held Lydia fast, so she was unable to back away. �You had to know that this day would come,� he said, still speaking calmly. �You couldn&#8217;t have believed that I would let you get away with taking her from me.� I thought for a moment that he would slap her, but no�he continued to speak calmly, so cool that even I was frightened, and for a moment I almost pitied Lydia.

She did look afraid, for a moment, but even as Joseph held on to her she laughed coldly. �You&#8217;re a fool, Aaron. Beatrice Gainsley��

�I know all about that,� my husband cut her off. �I have Mrs. Gainsley quite under my thumb.� His confidence in this was a pretense, I know. He still fears that she may betray us yet. But I am not afraid that she will. I have full confidence in her, and I do hope that you tell her so.

�I should have known better than to trust that ninny,� Lydia spat bitterly.

�Be fair, Mrs. Morrison,� my husband said lightly. �She kept your secrets faithfully for all this time. Emily herself came into contact with me, and I had to force the truth from Mrs. Gainsley.�

Lydia looked over at me, and I saw the hurt in her eyes. I don&#8217;t believe that I felt guilty about it, not quite, but I was not entirely pleased. �Yes,� Mr. Singer continued, �Emily knew the risks involved, but she was so unhappy that she took the chance. And here I am. So, Mrs. Morrison, how are we to work out this situation, hmmm?�

Lydia said nothing; she had even stopped struggling against Joseph, though I saw that he did not relax his grip on her. My husband sighed impatiently. �I am taking Emily��

�Then I will be contacting the police,� Lydia said, trying to be calm, but I could note the tone of threatening hysteria in her voice. 

�Must it really come to that?� Mr. Singer asked softly. �Come now, Mrs. Morrison, your crimes surely outweigh ours��

�I don&#8217;t care about that,� Lydia declared, and she laughed, almost manically. �If I cannot have Emily�then I will ruin you both!� She glanced over at me; I am certain that I cut my eyes at her. How could she?

But my husband was far from upset. He was ready to set our plans into motion then. �And who will aid you?� he asked. �Joseph?�

�Not me,� Joseph said, still holding fast to his former employer. �I&#8217;m with you, Singer.�

�As are the other ladies of this house,� my husband said. Lydia stared as he went quickly up the stairs, returning a moment later with Maggie, Nancy, Jiao, and Ester. The girls glanced over at me, in my bondage, momentarily, but united beside my husband, facing their oppressor. �I knew you would be stubborn, Mrs. Morrison, so I&#8217;ve asked these young women to assist me in persuading you to see to reason. Ladies,� he said, addressing the girls, �Why don&#8217;t you help Joseph secure her to that bed?� The girls all giggled excitedly as they and Joseph forced a struggling Lydia to the dirty mattress, using heavy chains that Maggie retrieved from the trunk to secure her to the posts.

My husband untied me as they went about their work. �You get to go first, Emily,� he said, taking my hand. He led me (still naked) over to where Lydia lay bound, with the gag that my husband had selected for her firmly in place. She muffled loud protests that we all ignored as we conversed. �This bitch has hurt all of us, so we&#8217;ll all get a fair chance to teach her a lesson,� my husband announced. �But I feel that she has wronged Lady Emily most, so she should have the first go at her.�

Everyone agreed, except me. �Sir,� I said, �I&#8217;d like to allow Maggie to go first.�

Mr. Singer looked disappointed. �Are you sure, my love?�

�Yes, sir.� I looked right into Lydia&#8217;s furious eyes as I added, �She&#8217;s been horrible to these poor girls, and Maggie&#8217;s gotten the worst of it. I think it would be right.� I looked at Maggie, my friend, and asked, �Would you like to?�

She certainly did, and my husband consented, perhaps seeing how eager she was for vengeance. �Very well,� he said. �Maggie, the whole trunk of torments is at your disposal.� As she eagerly selected her tools, I dressed with relief. As much as I have hated Lydia these years, I didn&#8217;t know if I was ready to hurt her. I did remember how much I enjoyed tormenting old Colonel Faulkner, but he had enjoyed it as well. In fact, when I encountered William Mosley here in San Francisco, he said that for the rest of his days, the colonel would often mention that rainy morning wistfully. I remember that my husband had predicted as much, that the old man would remember my kindly cruel treatment of him for the remainder of his life.

Still, I have always been a submissive one, and I have always enjoyed receiving more than giving the punishments, as you well know. But Maggie�she looked so excited. My husband whispered to me, �You were right about Maggie and Nancy, my dear. They both told me of how they are lovers.� Ha! My husband just met these girls, and I have known them for several years now, and they have opened up their hearts to him! I was certainly not surprised.

Indeed, as though to verify my husband&#8217;s words, Nancy and Maggie kissed briefly before Nancy encouraged her friend to approach the bed. We all stood back a respectful distance; Maggie&#8217;s continence became quite serious as she stood over Lydia&#8217;s bound body, staring down at her, holding the riding crop that she had selected. 

�When you&#8217;re ready, Maggie,� my husband encouraged her kindly. �She knows why she&#8217;s being punished�I daresay she&#8217;s smart enough to know how much she deserves this.�

�I should hope she does,� Maggie agreed quietly. She didn&#8217;t take her eyes off her victim. Lydia stared back up at her, with pure hate in her eyes. Maggie still said nothing for a moment, before she burst out with, �You&#8217;re a horrible, horrible woman! If it weren&#8217;t for Nancy or Mrs. Singer, I might have killed you a long time ago. I didn&#8217;t even know of half of your crimes until this night. You&#8217;re a monster,� she declared solemnly. She raised the riding crop and let it fall viciously on Lydia&#8217;s breasts. But slapping the whip against her clothed form did not satisfy Maggie, and she proceeded to tear off Lydia&#8217;s slip and corset, with Nancy&#8217;s assistance.

When Lydia&#8217;s pale skin was exposed, there was nothing hindering Maggie from whipping her without mercy. Lydia did not want to give her the satisfaction of hearing her scream or cry, that was clear, but she wasn&#8217;t so tough. Never on the other end of the whip, I daresay she didn&#8217;t have an idea of how real and intense the pain of being beaten is, only the high of inflicting such pain upon another. 

Watching Lydia&#8217;s perfect skin desecrated with furious red gashes was incredible. My husband stood behind me, his arms around my waist, rubbing my belly comfortingly. I could feel his hard cock against my lower back, and I wondered what he would do to relieve it. But for the time being, he seemed satisfied in simply watching Maggie at her work, and she seemed determined to lash at every inch of Lydia&#8217;s body. I was afraid, though, that she would not limit her blows to Lydia&#8217;s torso, arms, and legs, and would aim for her head. I bit my lip a couple of times to hold back protests, and when I tensed up, my husband&#8217;s embrace tightened around me.

But considering the circumstances, Maggie showed a surprising amount of restraint. It was even fun, at first, to watch Lydia writhe and moan in torment. But then, when Maggie stopped to catch her breath (for she had been whipping Lydia nonstop), she suddenly burst into angry tears! Still staring down at Lydia, she cried, �I wanted that baby! I would have been a good mother!� And proceeded to beat Lydia more cruelly than ever, her tears flowing, sobbing and beating Lydia until she nearly collapsed, with Nancy there to hold her.

�What does she mean?� I whispered to myself in wonder. I wanted to go forth and comfort Maggie as she sobbed in Nancy&#8217;s arms on the floor. I wasn&#8217;t even thinking of Lydia, crying and uncomforted on the bed.

My husband turned me about to face him. �Maggie told me about an incident that happened a couple of years past,� he said gently. �She had been pregnant, and when Mrs. Morrison found out, she pushed her down the stairs.�

I gasped aloud, my face burning furiously. How had I not known? Why had nobody told me? And there I was, flaunting my pregnant belly around the house (not exactly flaunting, you know, but nonetheless�), while poor Maggie�

Well, if I&#8217;d any pity left for Lydia in my heart, it was gone at that moment. Dear Mr. Singer�even after so much time apart, he knows me better than anyone. Seeing how upset I was, he said, �Why don&#8217;t you take Maggie upstairs and have a break, darling?� I nodded, and my husband involuntarily stroked his cock through his trousers. I smiled a little; I knew what he would do while I was gone, and though I wanted to watch, I was more eager to speak with my friend.

Maggie, Nancy, and I went upstairs to the office. Nancy helped Maggie sit on the couch. Maggie was still in her �work clothes,� dressed as skimpily as Lydia herself had been, and her exposed skin was covered in a sheen of sweat. Silent tears ran down her face as she told me the whole thing. She had no way of knowing who the father of her baby was, but what did that matter? She and Nancy had both been planning on leaving together, taking the money that they&#8217;d saved and finding a place to take care of the child. They had not told anyone their plans; but Lydia somehow found out.

�She�she said that I was nothing but a stupid whore,� Maggie sniffed. �We�we were at the top of the stairs, on the second floor, and she slapped me and said that I hadn&#8217;t been careful enough, and I&#8217;d never be a fit mother, that it would be better just to�� Maggie was unable to proceed.

�She only did it to keep us here,� Nancy continued bitterly. �Amalia had just gone, and Ester hadn&#8217;t come yet, so it was just us three girls.� She addressed me directly and said, �When she&#8217;d�when the baby was�well, what else could we do, Mrs. Singer? She even took our savings��

�She did what?� I demanded. 

�She said she&#8217;d keep it safe,� Nancy said bitterly, �But she doesn&#8217;t give us a dime if we ask for it.�

�Don&#8217;t worry,� I said, trying to be calm, but my head was spinning. �You&#8217;ll get every last dollar back, and more.�

We didn&#8217;t seem to know what else to say. Maggie couldn&#8217;t stop crying, the poor dear, she hadn&#8217;t allowed herself to think of her loss in so long. She really is a delicate thing, and it had taken all of her strength to punish Lydia the way that she needed to. Before Nancy helped her to bed, I embraced her. �Thank you, Maggie,� I said. �You are quite a remarkable young woman, and I hope that you regard me as your friend.�

My words caused her to cry again, but she was smiling as she bade me goodnight. I made my way alone to the cellar, and found that Lydia had been moved. She was now dangling from a chain the middle of the room, and Jiao, laughing with wicked glee, was whipping her back and ass. She was taking her time, enjoying herself. She caught my eye and winked before lashing Lydia again, right across her already abused ass cheeks, and I could not help smiling a little to myself.

My husband and Joseph stood together against the far wall, leaning casually against it, watching Jiao with interest but still having their own conversation. It seemed that, for the time being, they had both been satisfied. Upon further inspection of Lydia, I could clearly see cum seeping down her bloodied thighs.

�There she is,� Mr. Singer declared, and came to me, wrapping me in a warm embrace. �And how are our friends?�

�They&#8217;re fine,� I said. �Maggie is off to bed. I am certain that Nancy will stay with her.�

My husband nodded. �We&#8217;ve skipped your turn again, I&#8217;m afraid. Perhaps you&#8217;d like to punish your wicked old &#8216;Mother&#8217; when she&#8217;s spent?�

I looked over at Lydia. Her eyes were squeezed shut, her face stained with her tears. Her white-blonde hair, usually so neatly and carefully arranged (even after an encounter with a client or playtime with me), was in disarray. With the deep cuts all over her body, she looked most pathetic. She did not even scream behind her gag anymore, only moaning loudly with each new lashing. Still, I did not pity her.

I decided to hold off on punishing Lydia that night. Not out of mercy�no, I needed to plan what I would do to her. I never intended for this all to be dragged out for so long. I wanted to give her one brutal punishment, and have it be enough to teach her. I explained this to my husband, and he nodded. When Jiao was satisfied with a job well done, he declared, �We should all be off to bed, I think.� 

He and Joseph were ready to move Lydia back to the nasty mattress, but I said, �No, sir�let&#8217;s keep her there tonight.�

My husband grinned at me and put his arms around my swollen waist. �Wicked thing!� he murmured in my ear. He nibbled on my earlobe. �As you wish, my love. Now, show me to your bedroom.�

We bade our friends goodnight (for a moment, I felt more than a little awkward as I watched Joseph leave the house and return to his cottage alone), and I led my husband back through the office, to the bedroom. It was very late; indeed, the sky outside the large window was turning dark blue. I closed the curtains as Mr. Singer took off his clothes.

He undressed me gently, and we lay together on the large bed, the bed that I had shared with Lydia alone for too many years. We did not make love again that morning, but before we fell asleep, we kissed softly, sweetly, under the covers. My friend, nothing feels more natural than my husband&#8217;s arms around me, our bare skin touching. In spite of all that has been happening, I haven&#8217;t slept so peacefully since we were parted. 

I will describe the one and only punishment that I gave to Lydia in my next letter. My best to all; my one wish is to be home with my loved ones again!

Much love,

Emily


14 January, 18&#8212;

Dear Tatiana,

The whole situation has gotten quite out of control here. I am still trembling so much that I can scarcely hold this pen. But my husband has a plan�he always seems to know what to do. Oh, God, if this had happened, and he weren&#8217;t here, what would I do? Though I wonder if it would have happened, if he hadn&#8217;t come�not that I would wish that!

I need to sort through my thoughts, and so, my friend, you will know everything first. Allow me to explain. You see, after more than a week of physically punishing Lydia, depriving her sexually, humiliating her, torturing her, and starving her, we came to the conclusion that these methods simply will not work on her. But they did cause her to bend, a little. The other day, only about an hour after concluding my last letter to you, I sat alone in the cellar with Lydia and had a long talk with her. In spite of everything, all of the people she has hurt and the terrible things she has done, I do still love her, in some way, and I was my gentle self with her.

I promised to explain how I had punished her before, and I will now. I admit that I felt guilty when it was over, but while I was in the midst of it, I found myself understanding why Jiao had been laughing, and why Maggie had cried. I had wanted to hurt her in a way that she would never forget, perhaps to make her pay for all the pain she&#8217;d caused me, and our family, and others. 

After a very restful sleep in my husband&#8217;s arms, I woke much later than usual. Mr. Singer was already out of bed. I left the room, and the office, and followed the sound of voices into the kitchen. I found my husband sitting at the table, talking with Nancy and Maggie as they made breakfast. They frequently cook together, and are very generous about sharing (especially since I&#8217;ve never made any of the girls pay for food in the house out of their salary). They all seemed rather cheerful; indeed, the late morning sun was shining through the windows, and it was a very pleasant scene.

Everyone greeted me warmly, my husband rising to kiss me softly. �Are you well-rested, darling?� he asked, touching my stomach gently.

�Yes, sir,� I said, smiling. He is still the same kind, loving guardian who has cared for me since I was a tiny, orphaned girl. 

The four of us sat together and had a pleasant breakfast, not speaking of our activities in the cellar. Mr. Singer said that he had closed up the house, locked the doors and put up a sign to ward off the usual clients. �Joseph will be at the door tonight,� my husband said simply, indicating that our continued activities would not be interrupted.

It being a lovely morning, with only a hint of winter chill in the air, Mr. Singer insisted that the girls go out and enjoy themselves that day. When they were gone, and I was seeing to the dishes, he said, �Joseph, Ester, and Jiao will both be out of the way today as well, so we&#8217;ll have Lydia all to ourselves.� When I glanced at him, he smiled. �If you don&#8217;t wish to punish her yourself, Emily, I won&#8217;t make you. We can just talk with her�let&#8217;s see if she&#8217;ll come around.�

But I had plans of my own. I took the leftover food and put it on a plate. �Best not to let her starve,� I said, and my husband followed me silently to the basement. He seemed to know what I would do, and he stood back and let me deal with Lydia myself. 

For a moment, I almost pitied her when we came into the cellar. Her head was hanging woefully against her chest. Her painful wounds were a garish red against her otherwise pure-white skin. From the smell in the air, it seemed that Lydia had urinated herself. I thought of that evening after Lydia had taken me, when she forced me to piss on myself in her bed. Well, she&#8217;d gotten hers back for that, at least.

She looked at me with red, bleary eyes as I placed the plate on the floor. �Good morning, Lydia,� I forced myself to chirp merrily. She moaned softly behind her gag. �Rough night, dear? It&#8217;s all right.� I carefully removed her gag.

I was surprised when she murmured, �Oh, you are a naughty pet, aren&#8217;t you?� I smiled at this, until she added, �But you never would have done this on your own.�

For some reason, I felt a flash of fury. My hand went to her throat. She stared at me, more in surprise than in fear, as I threatened to squeeze. �Bitch,� I snarled, with a viciousness that I&#8217;ve never felt before, that scared me even as I was feeling it. �How dare you? I&#8217;m not your weak little pet, and I never have been. True,� I admitted, removing my hand from her throat, �True, my husband has brought this about. But it was a long time coming, Lydia. You lived in India for years, you know the Hindu concept of karma, I am sure. This was coming.�

Tears in her light blue eyes, she demanded, �What did I do to you, Emily? I only loved you.�

I shook my head at her in disbelief. �You can&#8217;t�you won&#8217;t�you&#8217;ve hurt me more than anyone ever could! How do you not see that? How can you justify anything that you&#8217;ve done?� And I did slap her then, so hard that I could feel her teeth rattle in the follow-through. I backhanded her across the other cheek, and hit her again, and would have gone for more if my husband hadn&#8217;t taken me gently by the arm.

�That will do, Emily,� he said tenderly. �That will do for now.�

I nodded. I know that he was more eager to see what I&#8217;d planned for her. He wanted me to keep my cool, to be in control as I punished her. Knowing that he was right, I took a deep breath and steadied myself as Mr. Singer retrieved a glass of water from the small sink in the corner. I took a trembling drink before holding the glass to Lydia&#8217;s lips. �Drink,� I said, and she obeyed, water dribbling down her chin.

I managed to get her down from the ceiling without removing the chain. She moaned loudly as I moved her strained shoulders down, and her wrists were now chained behind her back. I kept a strong hand on her arm as I lowered her to her knees. I pointed to the plate. �Breakfast!� I said, forcing the same cheery tone.

She looked up at me wearily. �No, thank you,� she said calmly. One of her eyes was beginning to swell shut from where I&#8217;d struck her.

�Oh, but you must eat,� I said, taking on the same mocking, falsely kind tone that she has frequently used with me. �Come now, Lydia, all the times you&#8217;ve treated me this way�haven&#8217;t you wondered what it&#8217;s like to be treated like a dog? Let&#8217;s see how fun it is for you from the other end.�

I forced her on her hands and knees and sat down on her back and arms, pushing her down onto the cold dirt floor. I seized her by the hair, and forced her face into the plate. �Eat!� I commanded. I did not let go of her hair, but I did loosen my grip enough to allow her to raise her head slightly, so that she could maneuver about the plate. If she hesitated for only a moment, I said, �Every bite, bitch, let&#8217;s not be wasteful now.�

For only a brief moment, I looked over at my husband. He stood watching, and he looked very pleased. I returned his smile, so glad for his approval. If it weren&#8217;t for him, it wouldn&#8217;t have felt right, but with him watching, I was enjoying wielding this power over my oppressor.

When she&#8217;d licked the plate clean, I stood up and helped her back up onto her knees. She gave me a hateful look as I stood before her. Mockingly, I asked, �What do we say, bitch?�

�Thank you, Lady Emily,� she responded automatically, and I was confused to see a glimmer in her eye, for only a moment. Something like�pride? Could she really be proud of me for this? It made me feel ashamed, for a moment, and that shame made me feel angry again. What have I ever done, to be really ashamed of? Plenty, I know�but you are not one to judge me for it, and bless you for that.

Again, had it not been for Mr. Singer&#8217;s presence, I might have left the cellar right then. But with him watching, I was encouraged to continue with my plans. I knelt before her, as though she were a small child whom I was about to scold. �Now, Lydia, you know that you&#8217;ve been very bad, don&#8217;t you?�

She looked me boldly in the eye and said, �I&#8217;ve only ever done what I&#8217;ve had to do. You cannot say any differently about yourself.�

�So, then, you had to kill your husband?� I demanded. �And Natasha? And Maggie&#8217;s unborn child?�

�Natasha was an accident,� Lydia sniffed, not looking the least bit remorseful. �And he was the one who straggled her, not I. What else was I supposed to do, Emily? I have a business to protect.�

�Not any more,� I said. �The place is closed now, indefinitely. Do you understand your situation, Lydia?� I asked, my tone more serious than before. �I am asking you to tell me the truth: what did you want from all this? Why did you do all this? Why?�

�Because I wanted to,� she said, and refused to say more. My frustration was mounting, and my husband stepped in to comfort me.

�This bitch isn&#8217;t ready to cooperate,� he declared. He grinned at her. �I guess her punishment last night wasn&#8217;t enough. That&#8217;s quite all right. We all have more in store for her, Emily. What would you like to do now?�

�Can you put her on the rack, please, sir?� I asked. �Facing the wall?� While my husband fulfilled my request, I found a large leather phallus in her trunk. I knew exactly what I wanted to do�and I would use no lotion to aid me. You see, while we both have had more than our share of experiences with ass play, Lydia has not ever taken a man in her ass before. Not once; she confessed this to me not long after she took me, as she gleefully raped my ass with a phallus. I don&#8217;t know what I could have done to her to cause her more pain�

I did not even have her gagged. I wanted to hear her screams, I wanted her to beg for mercy. Her back facing me, I stood behind her. Remembering that Joseph and my husband had played with her last night, I briefly fingered her asshole, feeling for any tearing. None! My husband, reading my thoughts, said, �We kept it for you, my love. I knew what you wanted to do.�

I turned to him and kissed him, briefly but passionately. �Thank you, sir,� I said. �You really do know me better than anyone, don&#8217;t you?�

�Of course,� he said with confidence. My fears about him noticing any adverse changes in me vanished at that moment. I had already explained to him, shamefully, my affair with Joseph, and the evidence from that is quite clear. And still, my husband does not judge me. He has seen the worst in me now, and he still believes me to be his angel. Oh, I love him so!

I put my head to his chest for a moment, comforted that he was there. Goodness, only 24 hours had passed since we&#8217;d reunited, and so much had happened! I didn&#8217;t want to let go of him, but he gently stepped away from me. �Go play, darling,� he encouraged me. �I will watch.�

I nodded and went to Lydia again. I briefly ran my free hand over the wounds on her back, ass, and upper thighs. She moaned at the contact. �We&#8217;ll put a little cream on those later,� I promised. �But for now�� I resumed fingering her asshole. �I remember that Mr. Morrison enjoyed ass play, a little. Didn&#8217;t you used to shove your fingers into his ass, like this?� I did so then, sticking two of my fingers into her tight anal regions and wiggling them about. Even that caused her to moan and whimper, and I hadn&#8217;t even really started yet.

Putting my mouth to her ear, I whispered, �But you never gave up your ass for anyone&#8217;s pleasure. That&#8217;s been your one little sacred place, hasn&#8217;t it, Lydia? You&#8217;ll have your ass licked, certainly, but not penetrated. Now, that&#8217;s not really fair, I think. After all, you&#8217;ve expected your partners to give so much, and yet�� I forced my fingers further into her; my knuckles were against the opening of her asshole. She did not scream, but she moaned again.

I removed my fingers, and without a word, put the tip of the dry phallus to her asshole. I briefly felt her pussy�God, she was wet, soaking wet, and her clit was pulsating gently! She was turned on by all this! All the better, I thought. I had every intention of denying her pleasure. I did not even finger her pussy or use her wetness for lubricant. �Relax, bitch, it won&#8217;t be so bad,� I lied. I had difficulty shoving the phallus in, and she screamed and tried to push it out. 

My husband came to my aid. As Lydia&#8217;s legs were already forced apart on the rack, all he had to do was hold her ass checks apart, allowing her asshole to stretch a bit. This, along with brute force, got the phallus in. And did she ever scream! My husband and I grinned at each other as she cursed at us, and I began to fuck her ass, slowly. I swear, even over her screams, I could hear the lining of her asshole tearing! 

Encouraged by her screams of rage and pain, I increased the rate of fucking. I couldn&#8217;t stop pumping that phallus into her, going as deep as I could with each cruel thrust. I was sweating profusely after a couple of minutes of this, but her screams drove me on and on, her cursing turning to begging. My husband came up behind me.

�Take a break for a moment, Emily, and let your friend have a crack at it,� he suggested. I nodded, and as soon as I removed the phallus from her ass, my husband whipped out his hard cock and shoved it into her. Of course, though Mr. Singer has a more than respectably sized cock, it is not nearly as big as that monstrous phallus, and so her screams dissolved into helpless whimpers of pain. Wanting her to scream again, wanting her to know pain, I seized the back of her head and slammed her face into the stone wall, twice, perhaps three times. She screamed again, blood running from her now broken nose, as my husband pulled out from her and sprayed his cum all over her back and ass. 

She was quite disgusting to behold. After my husband came, she&#8217;d shat all over herself. Her thighs and ass were covered in shit, dried piss, cum, and blood; her face was bloody and swollen. Just the previous night, I&#8217;d been very concerned for her as Maggie had beaten her, not wanting any blows aimed at her head. But at that moment, I wanted to take the riding crop and beat her upon the head a few times myself. Instead, I merely stood beside her, and asked, �Well, Lydia? Will this game be continuing?�

�Is that the worst you can do to me?� she demanded. Though her voice sounded strange, wheezy from her broken nose, she still had her same confident, mocking tone. �You should have sat in on a few more sessions with me and my clients. I might have taught you a few things.�

�Bitch from hell!� I declared. My husband took hold of me, calm as always. 

�She&#8217;s stubborn now, but she won&#8217;t stand for this long,� he said. He put a vicious gag on her, the same type she&#8217;s used on me, the kind that goes all the way down one&#8217;s throat. �We&#8217;ll let her think on it for a while, Emily. She knows there&#8217;s no way out of this. She&#8217;s hasn&#8217;t a friend in the world. Let&#8217;s leave her be.�

I followed my husband from the cellar. It was early afternoon, and it didn&#8217;t seem very strange that the house was so quiet. When evening came, there would not be the same bustle about the place to prepare for a night of business. But for now, nothing was out of the ordinary. 

My husband and I sat together in the small dining room, and I began to cry. I had felt high while punishing Lydia, strangely out of sorts, and coming down from it left me feeling exhausted. And hopeless�after all the beatings she&#8217;d already received, and the vicious raping that my husband and I had provided�and she still refused to be cooperative? I couldn&#8217;t think of anything worse to do to her myself, and since that morning, I have not directly participated in her punishments.

But the girls, and Mr. Singer himself, have quite relished using Lydia as their pain slut. Joseph participates as well, but not with the same enthusiasm. He is a tame one, Tatiana, and I know this intimately. He is not exactly a boring lover, just�tame. Not to my taste, and I&#8217;m able to admit this after knowing the complete pleasure and satisfaction of being with my husband, my master, again�though perhaps his own sister-in-law might train him�

Nancy shoved needles into Lydia&#8217;s tits (including several stuck directly into her nipples), and those stayed put for days. The girls (and I, I will confess) have forced Lydia to pleasure us repeatedly, squatting over her face just as she&#8217;s done to me countless times. The first time Ester squatted on her face, Lydia had refused to comply, so Maggie had viciously beaten her with the deadliest whip in the collection. After that, she did not refuse to cooperate any more.

Still, even as the girls (for after a while, they took over the business of punishing and using Lydia, as my husband and I supervised) have done their worst to her, Lydia still refused to budge. She would hear nothing of letting me go, nor would she agree to close her business. She even seemed to be enjoying her punishments, the cruel depravity that was heaped upon her. The only time that she truly seemed hurt by her treatment was when I refused her. Jiao had been leading her about the basement with a chain around her neck, forcing her to crawl like an animal. When they came to me, Jiao asked, �Mrs. Singer, would you like this bitch to please you?�

Though Lydia had been bathed since I&#8217;d punished her, she was still a disgusting mess. I even felt some guilt as I looked down at her. She looked up at me so eagerly that I coldly had to reply, �No, thank you.� The disappointment in Lydia&#8217;s eyes was very real. 

I expressed my frustration to my husband the other evening. �All of this is getting us nowhere!� I said, when we were alone in the bedroom. �I am glad that the girls are enjoying themselves, but it is enough now! I want to end this, sir�I can&#8217;t��

�You can&#8217;t bear to see her like this?� he asked gently. He knows my complicated feelings for Lydia; he&#8217;s always known them. They used to make him feel jealous and ashamed, but now I think he really understands, or at least respects that I have no control over these feelings. 

�And it&#8217;s doing no good,� I said, not denying his words. �She&#8217;s loving this, sir.�

�Yes,� he agreed with a sigh. �I did not quite anticipate that part. She&#8217;s such a proud, haughty thing, I thought that degradation would break her quickly.�

�Perhaps she knows she deserves it,� I said softly. I could not allow myself to believe that she, or any human being, could be completely without remorse. �What are we to do, sir?�

He had no answer for this. I resolved to talk with Lydia, alone, and that is what I did. In the basement, there were now several chairs, as Joseph had brought these down for us to sit and watch each other pummel Lydia. I untied Lydia from the bed and helped her to sit in one of the chairs. I didn&#8217;t even bother to restrain her. She was too weak, too bent, to fight against me. She had been refusing food, and the girls had not been too concerned about this.

�Lydia,� I said gently. �I want to talk with you, as a friend. We were friends once, weren&#8217;t we?�

�I only ever wanted to be your friend,� Lydia said, the tears coming easily.

�But darling,� I said kindly, �You weren&#8217;t a very nice friend to me. You know that.�

She sobbed, covering her swollen, now ugly face with her dirty hands. �I&#8217;m sorry, Emily,� she finally managed to whisper. �I&#8217;m sorry, I really am so sorry��

I held her gently, in spite of her stench, and let her sob against me. My pity for her came flooding back as she tried to explain her reasons to me. I&#8217;d already heard it all before, but for the first time, I really heard the regret in her voice as she talked about Mr. Morrison. �I only wanted to be happy again, Emily,� she said pathetically. �I was only happy with your mother, that&#8217;s the truth, and when I met you�I knew I could only be happy with you!�

I listened to her confessions, letting her cry, comforting her. She finally knelt before me, sobbing into my lap like a helpless child, clinging to the folds of my skirt. �Please, Emily, please forgive me. Your love is the only thing in the world to me�nothing else matters. Oh, Emily, what can I do to make you love me again?�

I admitted, �I&#8217;ve never stopped loving you, Lydia. It&#8217;s true,� I added as she looked at me in surprise. I stroked her face gently, wiping her tears. �But I cannot ever love you as much as I do my husband, or our children. Can&#8217;t you let me have my life with them back?�

�Yes,� she finally said. �Yes, Emily, you may go home to your family.� She sobbed again.

�And the girls?� I said. �You must make things right with them. Sell the house, Lydia. We&#8217;ll leave you with enough to go and begin again.�

�Where will I go?� she asked hysterically. �There is nothing for me, Emily!� But she agreed to all that I asked of her, and when I left her alone in the basement again (tied to the bed, but loosely), I felt exhausted but triumphant.

�She has agreed,� I told my husband, and he praised me and kissed me. We decided to leave her alone for the night, to rest, and to clean her up and begin our business in the morning. We made love in her bed and went to sleep, waking the next day, determined in our plans.

I wanted to prepare a nice breakfast for Lydia. I asked Mr. Singer to bring her up, and I was in the kitchen alone, preparing our meal. The house was otherwise quiet, and I imagined that the girls, having gone out and enjoyed themselves the night before, were asleep in their rooms.

My husband came back into the kitchen alone, his face very pale. �Something&#8217;s happened, Emily,� was all he could manage to say. I hurried to the basement, my heart pounding, and perhaps I knew what I would find before I got there.

Lydia was not on the bed, where I had left her. She was dangling again from a chain in the middle of the room. She was covered in blood; her throat at had been slashed. She was dead, murdered. And upon a search of the house, Nancy and Maggie, and their few possessions, were gone.

You&#8217;ve always been good at drawing conclusions, my friend, so you understand the situation that we now find ourselves in. I&#8217;m certain that you can imagine the obstacles that have now been placed before us. Needless to say, our homecoming with be delayed somewhat, but as I write this, my husband and Joseph are already setting the new plan into motion. I will have to stop writing now and, once again, play my part. I have not yet mourned Lydia&#8217;s death. I am trying to turn off my feelings and do what must be done. I cannot forget my goal, to come home to you all, so we will do what we must. I will keep you up to date on what happens. God willing, I will see you soon.

Much love to all,

Emily
















Mr. Singer

Needless to say, Maggie and Nancy&#8217;s hasty and treacherous actions had complicated the situation immensely. As Emily trembled and sobbed helplessly in my arms, I cursed silently to myself. It had all been about to come together! Emily had successfully convinced Lydia to go along with our plans. After many days of treating her brutally (which left my poor little wife exhausted and guilt-ridden), we would be able to end things peaceably. I had been looking forward to hastily making our way home again�but now�?

�Oh, sir,� Emily sighed helplessly, clinging to me. We sat on Mrs. Morrison&#8217;s bed in her room, as I had quickly taken her from the cellar after she&#8217;d viewed the scene of the murder. I regretted allowing her to see it, so gruesome it was, but I had been so shocked myself, I had been unable to get the words out. But I forced myself to snap out of it. Emily was beside herself; I needed to keep a cool head.

�What are we going to do?� Emily whispered. I did not yet have an answer, but I knew where we needed to start. As calmly as I could, I went through the house and sought out all of its occupants. Ester and Jiao were in the latter&#8217;s bed together, hung over after a night out on the town. They got up quickly, sensing that something was very wrong, as I had not yet gone up to the girl&#8217;s quarters myself.

�Where are the other girls?� I asked, not finding Nancy or Maggie about the place. The other girls had no answer to this; they had not seen their friends since the previous evening, after we had all had an early dinner together. As the girls dressed, I went to Joseph&#8217;s cottage in the back.

I did not yet know what to make of Joseph. We were getting along quite well; he was a good-humored young man, and very much reminded me of his brother my partner, with whom I&#8217;d always gotten on famously. The fact that Emily adored him so only appealed him more to me, rather than stirring my jealousy. Even the fact that she was carrying his child bothered me much less than one might think. But I was unable to read how he felt towards me, and so I was unable to entirely trust him.

Well, he proved himself in that situation. He was in his kitchen, alone, preparing his morning tea. I explained what had happened, what I knew so far. Together, we started to formulate a plan.

It was decided that I needed to vacate the premises, as soon as possible. If anyone outside of the house saw me there after the fact�well, I was a stranger, and would be the first one suspected.

Joseph, artistic soul that he is, is no fool when it comes to business dealings. Through the place itself, and his own acquaintanceships, he has formed some significant connections throughout San Francisco. One of these men is a doctor. �For a fee, he may go along with our plans,� he said. 

Most fortunately, Joseph had been telling clients who had been coming by the place that Lydia was very ill, and that the doctor had ordered a quarantine of the house. This effectively kept curious eyes away, so there would be no witnesses to contradict our paid-off doctor. Lydia, cleaned up and in a high-necked dress, might just pass for a woman who had died of a sudden illness. Her emaciated form would support that. 

Emily, when calm, would later add to our idea by suggesting that we have Lydia cremated. �No one will examine her body and see the�wounds,� she said. �It is a common Hindu practice, and she lived in India for so long�it would be rational, would it not, sir?�

Poor Emily. Nothing seemed rational in this situation, and she had always enjoyed order and reason and goodness. Determined to be finished with this business as quickly as possible, Joseph went to see his doctor friend (with his pockets lined with money) while I began to direct the girls. �I know that it is dreadful, but the body needs to be cleaned,� I said. Jiao and Ester, knowing that when the business was settled they would be much wealthier women, obeyed my orders, and after wrapping up the body in a canvas that Joseph often used while painting, we got the body to the washroom on the upper floor, and they took over the job from there.

While they scrubbed the blood and mess from Mrs. Morrison&#8217;s body, I went to Emily, who was calmly sitting at the desk in her office, her accounting book open before her. She looked up at me as I entered, and though her countenance was pale, she granted me a small smile. I went to her and kissed her on the forehead, my lips lingering. The poor thing! Our reunion was not supposed to be like this!

�What I don&#8217;t understand,� I finally said after some silence, �Is why they didn&#8217;t just stay with the plan? They understood that they would receive a generous share of the profits after the house was sold, didn&#8217;t they?�

Emily nodded weakly. �Yes, sir,� she said. �The girls all knew that they would be paid for their part. We sat up one night and they talked of what they wanted to do and where they wanted to go with their money�� Tears filled her eyes. �Oh, sir, this is all my fault!�

�No, darling,� I said. I knew that my words could not comfort her then, but I held her. 

�Sir,� she admitted, �I had given Nancy and Maggie quite a bit of money. Just the other night.�

�What&#8217;s that?� I asked. �Why, Emily?�

�I thought nothing of it,� she said, a little defensively, but she sounded ashamed of herself. �Lydia had been hoarding their savings. They&#8217;d done so much to help us, and when Maggie came and asked me for the money to which they were entitled�well, how could I refuse her anything?� She showed me the entry she&#8217;d made in her book, just the night before. �She only asked for their savings, and we sat and tabulated it all out. I thought they were planning to, I don&#8217;t know, purchase some new clothing? Oh, sir,� she sighed, slamming her book shut, �I&#8217;ve made such a mess of things! Of everything!�

She did not dissolve into sobs, but sat morose, which was worse I think. I patted her hand, but she could not respond to my touch. I looked around the room, which I&#8217;d gotten to know well over the last few days. I knew that Emily was eager to leave that place for good, and I prayed for a moment that all of our plans would come together again.

As I paced the room slowly, I noticed that a slim envelope had been left on the windowsill on the far end of the room. I picked it up; it was white, not yellowed with age, only just placed there. Mrs. Singer, it read on the front. Slowly, I brought it to my wife. She looked at me in curiosity as I placed it in her hands.

�It&#8217;s for you, darling,� I said softly. She opened it with trembling fingers, and read it aloud to me:

Dear Mrs. Singer,

We are very sorry for what we did. We know that you wanted to end things agreeably with Mrs. Smithwick, but the thought of letting her go on, after everything she&#8217;s done�

We love you, Mrs. Singer, and hope the best for you. Thank you for all of the help. We can&#8217;t say where we&#8217;re going, of course, but we look forward to a happy life together, and hope the same for you and your husband. We hope we haven&#8217;t complicated everything for you by what we done. 

Love,

Maggie and Nancy

�Loyal to each other to the last,� she said, with the hint of a smile on her lips. �They won&#8217;t even reveal who actually did the deed.� But when we looked at each other, we both knew�not that it mattered anymore.

�Emily,� I said tenderly, and with much regret, �I have to go soon.�

She looked at me with wide, frightened eyes, but she nodded. �Yes,� she agreed quietly.

�Joseph and I have discussed it,� I said, �And I am going to help the girls arrange Lydia for the doctor. Then I will retrieve Alice from her school, and take her to Omaha. When this business is settled, you and Joseph will meet us there.�

Emily nodded, though even her lips were pale. �I hate the thought of being apart from you again, sir,� she said.

�So do I, Emily. But it won&#8217;t be long,� I said with forced optimism. There were still dangers involved; Joseph had insisted that I take Alice, just in case he and Emily came into trouble. At the very least, I could get the girl home to her family. �Take the time that you need to take care of things,� I said, gesturing to her meticulous accounting records. �Joseph will be here to help you. You�you may take comfort in him,� I added hesitantly.

Emily gave me a curious look. She shook her head. �No, sir,� she said. �I won&#8217;t do that. Never again.�

Her words pleased me; she was still all mine. �Very well, darling,� I said solemnly. �Then we will have to get our comfort from each other while we still can.�

She was eager for a distraction, and to have me once more before we parted again. Smiling a little, she led me back into the bedroom (I realized, as she removed her dress, that we would have to bring Lydia&#8217;s body there soon). She bade me lie down. �You have a long journey ahead of you, sir,� she said softly. �Let your darling slave do the work for you.�

I complied, and she unbuttoned my shirt as she straddled me, gloriously naked. I was certain that her belly had grown significantly in the past few days, her skin stretched taunt and shining with the oil that she rubbed on it. She ran her smooth little hands over my chest until I seized her by the wrists.

�I am afraid that we don&#8217;t have much time to play,� I said regretfully, and she frowned. I grabbed her head and pulled her face to mine, kissing her sensually, tasting her, sliding my hungry tongue over hers. I removed my trousers enough to reveal my stiff cock, already throbbing for her, and I seized her by the hips.

She rode me slowly, skillfully, grinding against me and allowing me to feel her all around me with each thrust. �Oh, God, sir!� she screamed, her tits (still so pert, and growing again in her pregnancy) bouncing with the rhythm of her movements. She threw her head back, coming so easily, though she did not cease in riding.

I ran my hands up and down her body, so soft and warm. I closed my eyes and sighed contently as I came. Emily stopped riding me, and I instructed, �Bring your little ass up here, my love, and let your friend clean you.�

She giggled, such a sweet sound, and sat upon my chest. I put my hands on her hips and she tilted back, her pussy right in my face. I was easily able to lick and suck at her, and I could feel her body shuddering against mine. I forced her thighs wider apart and thrust my tongue into her depths, tasting her tangy sweetness. God, I had missed it! She had a particularly wonderful taste, and for that, I would never have been able to find a substitute.

Troubled as she undoubtedly felt that day, I was easily able to coax another orgasm from her, and after cleaning her thoroughly, she dutifully reciprocated. Of course, my cock went hard again, and she pleased me with that sweet, soft mouth. Though we were running out of time, I allowed her to go slowly, not grabbing her by the head and pumping myself into her. After I came again, and she&#8217;d cleaned me slowly, we held each other briefly.

�The girls must be ready by now,� I said, rising from the bed. We both dressed quickly, and just as if our little sensual rendezvous had never occurred, we both went about with our plans. I went upstairs to the washroom, and found Jiao and Ester drying off the cleaned body. �Good timing,� I praised them, and examined Lydia for a moment. Her body nearly bloodless, even the ugly marks from her beatings were pale. Her lips were off-color, but that seemed just right. Still, I frowned at the body, the limp and pathetic form that had once been my worst enemy.

I would later regret my attitude that morning, how I treated that body as a prop, and not as a person once living. Though she&#8217;d hurt me, I felt that I had been properly avenged. I had not wanted her to die. Whatever thoughts I may have had before, whatever my feelings had been, I had never wanted that. But that was the situation, and that morning, I had to do right by those living, by Mrs. Morrison&#8217;s victims. 

Between the three of us, we carried the small (but strangely heavy) body back downstairs. Emily was not to be found in the office or the bedroom; undoubtedly, she did not wish to view Lydia&#8217;s remains again. With the help of the girls, I found a simple nightgown that would actually cover up the wound on Lydia&#8217;s neck. All cleaned out, it did not look so very deep; I imagined that she had been left to bleed and choke for hours, and the idea of it made me shudder. 

Jiao expertly arranged Lydia to look as though she&#8217;d been in bed for days. I stood back and looked down at her unmoving form contemplatively. Yes, the doctor would know the truth, but no one else would be able to tell the difference. She&#8217;d died of an illness�what else did anyone need to know?

When we left Lydia&#8217;s body alone in the room, we found Emily in the office again. I only noticed then that she had brought my trunk of things into the office. �I suppose you must be going now, then?� she asked quietly.

�Yes,� I said, but I did not move. I said my goodbyes to the girls, never to see them again, and they left us alone. Emily did not cry as I held her, but I could feel her trembling. �Everything will work out, my darling,� I promised her. �Joseph will bring the doctor by soon, I&#8217;m sure, and this whole thing will be straightened out forthwith.�

�Oh, sir,� she sighed, and I knew that that was not the extent of her troubles. Nothing to be done about that now, I thought, and then felt ashamed of my callousness. I did not want to part this way.

I kissed Emily softly. �I&#8217;m very eager to meet young Alice. You&#8217;ve spoken so highly of the girl.�

Emily had to smile a little at that. �You will like her, I&#8217;m sure. She&#8217;s a sweet thing.� She had met Alice for church services the previous week, and though she had told the girl about me, and about my connection with her family, I had not yet made her acquaintance. �She is very excited to meet her sister-in-law as well.�

�Her sister-in-law is not the best influence for a young girl,� I said teasingly, though I did not mean that at all. �I have no doubt that she and Tatiana will love each other.�

Emily kissed me softly. �You should go now, sir. Take to the trees until you are off the property, so as not to be seen��

I kissed her again, and looked into her eyes. �I love you, Emily. Come to me in Omaha. I will inquire at the train station for you every day until you do.�

�I love you, too, sir,� she said tearfully. �Goodbye.� 

Parting from her was too painful, and I could not stay to comfort her. But at least we got to say goodbye that time. She was not snatched away from me rudely. And, had I known that all would work out as planned, and that we would be reunited in only a fortnight, I would not have left &#8216;Lydie Smithwick&#8217;s Place&#8217; with such a heavy heart.


Alice Shelton was, indeed, a sweet girl. She was a few years older than my Mina, and though her inquisitive nature reminded me of my beloved child, she had more tact than my outspoken daughter. At least, she waited until we had been traveling together for a couple of days before she started posing any truly probing questions.

She was shy upon first meeting me, though she knew who I was. Her boarding school, a small Catholic school consisting of one tall, narrow building beside a chapel, had already been sent a message by Joseph that I would be retrieving her. Addressing me by my married title, the Mother Superior, a middle-aged woman who may have been sour-faced much of the time, was very polite and accommodating. �We are sorry that Alice will be leaving us,� she said.

�Yes, but she&#8217;s going home to her family,� I said. �They&#8217;ve been waiting for her for a long time.� The Mother Superior praised the Lord at the girl&#8217;s good fortune. As I waited for my beneficiary, I smiled, knowing that I was still able to charm women�even those who had taken vows of chastity.

The girl appeared, and I rose to greet her. She shyly contemplated me, giving me a polite curtsy. I went to her and pressed her hand. �I&#8217;m very pleased to meet you, Miss Shelton,� I said. 

The poor girl didn&#8217;t know what to say, and we had to leave with some haste. I bid goodbye to the Mother Superior, and led the girl to a waiting carriage, where her few things had already been loaded. We would be traveling light.

�Has your brother told you the plan yet?� I asked the girl kindly as the carriage made its way to the train station.

�No, sir,� she said hesitantly. �I�I only received word that you would be coming for me.�

�I am sorry to pull you away from school so unexpectedly,� I said. �Mrs. Singer told you that I am acquainted with your family, did she not?�

�Yes, sir.�

�We are beginning the journey homeward,� I said, and I was granted a shy little smile from the girl. 

�Are Mrs. Singer and Joe meeting us at the station, sir?� she asked.

�No,� I said, and she frowned a bit. �We are traveling ahead, and will be waiting on them. They�they have business to wrap up here, and your brother thought it would be better if you came ahead with me. Is that all right?� I asked. Not as though the girl had any say in the matter, but I did not wish for her to be uncomfortable with me.

�Yes, sir,� Alice finally answered. I remembered then that the poor child had been abused by a guardian once, so I imagined that she was wary of me. But I would earn her trust before too long. Knowing how much she meant to people who were very important to me, I was quite protective of her in our travels, and I spoke to her kindly, carefully, but was friendly enough. She eventually warmed to me.

On the way to Omaha, we sat in a large compartment together, and she told me about her studies at school. After a day of traveling together, I commented, �It must be a bit strange for you, though, going to a Catholic school and church.�

�Why do you say that, sir?� Alice asked mildly.

�Because you are Jewish.� Alice&#8217;s eyes widened in surprise, and I smiled at her. 

�Only on my mother&#8217;s side,� she finally replied.

�Ah, yes, but by religious doctrine, that makes you Jewish as well,� I said, and she actually smiled at that. She went on to tell me about her mother, who had come from a wretchedly poor family in Eastern Europe. Her father had once been a respected member of the British Navy, and had met her mother during a trip to Moscow when he was on leave. She had been working there (Alice seemed to believe that her mother had been a bar maid; I wondered if she hadn&#8217;t actually been a prostitute), and he had fallen in love with her, bringing her back to London with him to be wed.

�I don&#8217;t remember my parents very well,� Alice admitted regretfully. �I only know what Joe has told me.� She had been very young when they had died. Her father had been a good man, kindly to his family, and he was not a heavy drinker. But his vice was gambling, and his debts mounted so much that he and his wife were imprisoned.

I have always detested debtor&#8217;s prisons. Not only did I find the practice cruel, but also counterproductive. If I&#8217;d had the same passion and good heart as my Emily, that might have been my cause as poor orphans had been hers. And of course, the two often go hand-in-hand, as was the case with the poor Shelton children.

Their parents both fell ill and died, the elder Captain Shelton while still in prison, and his wife not long after she was freed. The poor man, decorated veteran that he&#8217;d once been, had been buried in a pauper&#8217;s grave. Alice recounted all this to me in a serious but somewhat removed manner. After all, she had been quite young. The only life she knew was the one she&#8217;d shared with her beloved brother &#8216;Joe.&#8217;

I told her about her brother&#8217;s home in the English countryside, and her sister-in-law and nephew. Though I&#8217;m certain she&#8217;d heard this all from Emily already, she listened politely, and smiled. She was glad to be making the journey. But, though we did not speak of it, and though she could not have had a complete grasp of the situation, we were both anxious for Emily and her brother.

We spoke of them the following evening. We were not far from Omaha by then, and the girl had slept, stretched out across her side of the compartment, for most of the day. I sat opposite her, trying to read, but I was too distracted by my worries. I looked out of the window at the passing landscape, the rolling fields. I wondered if Joseph&#8217;s doctor friend had taken the bribe, if Emily had been successful in having Mrs. Morrison cremated, the evidence of her imprisonment and abuse burned away with her body. I could not allow myself to believe otherwise, but still, I worried.

The girl still had not woken by the time dinner was to be served, so I hesitantly shook her gently to stir her. She looked at me with bleary, confused eyes. �We�we&#8217;re still on the train?� she asked.

�Yes,� I said. �You should get up and eat, Alice.�

For a brief moment, the poor confused child looked as though she might cry. But she shook her head briefly. �All right,� she agreed, and I helped her to sit up. She took a moment to freshen up before accompanying me to the dining car. Alice was picking at her dinner, not eating much. Though I was tempted to advise her to eat, I noticed that I was merely picking at my own dinner, so I said nothing.

We did not stay long in the dining car. I procured a bottle of wine and we went back to our compartment. I briefly recalled the train rides that I had taken with Emily in our past, especially after we had become lovers. How we would socialize and flirt with the other wealthy passengers, often bringing one or two back with us to play. But on my latest travels, I had not been doing such. I was glad, at least, to have the innocent company of a child.

I thought nothing of drinking my wine straight from the bottle. After my first swig, I saw Alice staring at me, and I felt my cheeks color. What would Emily say to my behavior, around a young, impressionable child? The thought of her disapproval made me smile a little, and Alice smiled as well. �May I try a little, sir?� she asked.

I shrugged. �Why not?� She, too, drank from the bottle, awkwardly, careful not to spill any on the uniform she still wore. I smiled and said, �That&#8217;s right, have your sacrament.�

She laughed a little and handed me back the bottle. �I only attended Catholic church to spend time with your wife,� she admitted.

In a more serious tone, I said, �She cares for you very much, Alice. I know she&#8217;ll be glad when we&#8217;re all reunited, and back with our families.�

I took another drink, and we said nothing for a moment, for the same fear weighed heavily on our minds. After a moment, Alice said, �May I ask you a question, Mr. Singer?�

�Certainly,� I said.

�Are you�� She didn&#8217;t seem to know what to say, and I waited patiently. �I mean�your wife is having my brother&#8217;s child�do you�?�

I knew what she was driving at, and I smiled. �I love my wife very much. She&#8217;s a very special woman.�

�Yes,� Alice agreed.

�We were apart for a long time,� I said, not able to look at Alice. I was speaking more to myself, I suppose. �We didn&#8217;t want to be away from each other, but�well, we both sought comfort with�others. And I cannot begrudge her that,� I said simply.

When I looked at Alice, she nodded. �Joe does love Mrs. Singer, but�he&#8217;s not in love with her. He couldn&#8217;t be.�

�Oh?� I was wondering, how could he not be? �Why&#8217;s that?�

�Well, she�Mrs. Singer is the first woman that I know of him�� Alice flushed slightly. �He&#8217;s always been more comfortable with�other men.�

�Ah,� I said with a nod. Well, well, Alice seemed to be a very intuitive young girl. She seemed to have picked up on something that my Emily had not mentioned (perhaps she was not aware), and something that I had only felt in his presence. Alice and I did not speak for some time after that admission, as my worried thoughts turned to very perverted ones indeed. After nearly finishing the bottle of wine (with some assistance from Alice), I excused myself to the washroom. I hoped that the girl could not hear me pounding away at my stiff cock like an excited schoolboy.


Omaha was a bustling, growing city in the middle of vast prairie and farm lands, connected to other large cities by the rails. Alice and I found rooms in a nice but simple inn, not far from the train station. We had our separate daily routines. She was fond of exploring the city, and though I accompanied her in the first days, I found her to be savvy enough to trust out on her own. I wondered one afternoon, as I sat in the parlor at the inn, if I would have allowed Emily out alone in a strange city at Alice&#8217;s age. I don&#8217;t believe I would have; she would have at least had her Nanny along with her.

But Alice was satisfied with her distractions, which is more than I could say. I would spend my days sitting around at the inn, reading the newspaper with little attention, or going to the train station (I had memorized the schedule, and waited for each passenger train coming in from the West). In my quiet times alone, in my room, I would return to the still-unanswered question, the question of what to do with Mrs. Gainsley.

Having taken my aggressions out on Mrs. Morrison (and I felt that Emily was correct in her assertions that the whore had enjoyed it, in spite of everything), and having been reunited with Emily, my feelings toward Mrs. Gainsley had softened. Still, while I nursed the idea of keeping her at Wainwright Hall, allowing her to live under Lady Emily&#8217;s forgiveness and protection, I had to wonder if I would allow her to stay, if Emily were not to come back to me. If anything happened to Emily�if she were imprisoned, tried, executed, what have you�I knew that I would not be able to forgive Mrs. Gainsley. So the question remained unsettled until I had Emily in my arms again�not that our decisions would matter in the end.

I had left my contact information at the train station, and one cold, bright morning, while Alice and I were still having breakfast, I received a telegraph. All of my worries were gone when I read it: Emily and Joseph would be in Omaha that afternoon.

Alice stayed by my side that day, eager to see her brother and beloved friend. We went on a brief errand to pick up a couple of dresses that I had purchased for her. She had admired the designs in a shop window in our first days there. Simple, floral dresses, and I felt they would be perfect for her to wear at her new home in the country. As she flushed, I&#8217;d offered to have them made and fitted for her.

Though she&#8217;d been hesitant to accept my gift, she was eager to wear one of the dresses to the station to greet Emily and Joseph. �Do you think Mrs. Singer will like this one?� she asked, trying it with the hat I&#8217;d gotten for her.

I nodded. �You look very charming, Alice.� I could imagine the girl in a few years. She had her brothers&#8217; rounded cheeks (certainly from their Anglo-Saxton father), and her mother&#8217;s dark coloring and sharp nose. With her big, dark eyes, she would be an exotic beauty. I had to push aside these thoughts; it would be a long time yet before she&#8217;d be old enough to play, though she was a pretty young thing.

We arrived at the train station promptly at 3, and the eastbound train had not yet pulled in. We waited anxiously, but not for long. We stood aside as the passengers streamed out, and Alice and I both watched for Joseph (knowing that little Emily would not be visible above the crowd).

He stepped off the train and spotted us, waving with a smile. He handed down my wife. Emily looked worn out, but she was smiling radiantly, and she saw us immediately. She did not rush to us, but walked briskly, and Alice went to meet her. Emily wrapped her in a tight embrace, kissing the top of her head, before she took the girl&#8217;s hand and came to me.

�Hello, sir,� she said softly. I took her by the chin and looked carefully at her face. Yes, the poor dear was exhausted, and in spite of the ideas that would sometimes interrupt my dark thoughts over the past few days, I knew that she needed nothing more than rest. I kissed her softly, briefly, and she wordlessly took my hand.

I offered my other hand to Joseph to shake. He was wearing a fine suit, much nicer than anything else he owned, I knew. �Have we a cab, Singer?� he asked after we exchanged greetings. Though the inn was not far, I had anticipated that they would have heavy luggage, and so we had one waiting. As the trunks were loaded, I noticed a large frame wrapped in canvas.

�Ah,� I whispered to my wife, who had not let go of my hand, �I will finally get to see the portrait?� Emily had teased me back in San Francisco, telling me that Joseph had painted a portrait of her, but that she would not show it to me until we had left the city. She smiled at me coyly then, saying nothing. But I noticed her frowning slightly as Joseph assisted the driver in lifting their luggage onto the carriage.

�Sir,� she whispered, �When is the next train heading east? I believe that we should begin our journey home right away.�

I was startled for a moment. �Has something gone amiss, my dear?� I asked, trying not to show my alarm.

She shook her head. �Oh, no, sir,� she said. Almost bitterly, she added, �It all came together quite handily.�

�Good,� I muttered vaguely, troubled by her anxiety.

�Please, sir,� Emily implored, looking me in the eye. �Please, can&#8217;t we begin our travels homeward now? Please, sir��

�Emily,� I said gently, taking her by the arm. �You&#8217;re exhausted, my dear. You must relax, you must rest��

�I can rest on the train,� she insisted urgently. But I could not let her have her way, and seeing that I would not, she glumly allowed me to help her into the carriage. She forced a smile for her friends as we all rode back to the inn together, but when we were alone in our room (Joseph was bunking with his sister, but not for long), she sighed heavily and sat, morose, upon the bed.

�There, now, my darling,� I said patiently. I sat beside her and wrapped my arms around her, my hands resting on her thick waist. �I know you are anxious to be home again.�

�Oh, sir, I don&#8217;t think I can be at ease until I&#8217;m with our children again,� Emily sighed. 

�The children are quite safe,� I assured her. �They are with Tatiana, and she loves them so. They are fine�besides, darling, there is another child to consider,� I added, rubbing her sweet belly affectionately. She was silent, almost smiling, and I buried my face in her neck, kissing her softly, taking in the sweet scent of her. Mine again! Mine forever, I swore to myself.

Still, she was tense as I held her, rocking her gently. �You will raise my child, sir?� she asked softly.

�Yes, Emily,� I agreed. �I will raise and love your child as much as our other children, as long as you will raise mine.�

�Oh, yes, sir,� she agreed. Ah, but only brought up the question of Mrs. Gainsley, and I did not yet want to put my wife through that exhausting conversation. I managed to comfort Emily enough that she agreed to rest, and that we would stay in Omaha for only a couple of days, to get our bearings straight, before resuming our travels. I stripped her, but did not play with her, only holding her close until she slept deeply.

I hesitated to leave her, but I needed to speak with Joseph. I locked her securely in the room, and sought him in the dining area of the inn. It was going on suppertime, so I joined him in the near empty room for our meal and a conversation. He filled me in on the details of how the plan with Mrs. Morrison&#8217;s body laid out. His �friend,� Dr. Connors, had agreed to the bribe, and had filled out the necessary paperwork to have her death documented as the result of an illness. There was no police investigation, Joseph revealed. The only difficulty had been in disposing of the body itself, but Emily herself had found someone who would discreetly transport and cremate the body�for the right price, of course.

Only after Emily had settled the affairs of the place (which had come together quite handily as well, as Jiao and Ester had decided to take on the place themselves for their own &#8216;business venture&#8217;) had she disposed of Mrs. Morrison&#8217;s ashes. She had privately gone out to the bay and scattered them into the water. That had been the day before their departure; Joseph did not see Emily again until very late that evening.

�I am worried about her,� he admitted. �She&#8217;s hardly eaten.�

I frowned, and put in an order for her own dinner, which I would force her to eat after I was finished with Joseph. �So the business is completely settled, then?� I asked. �All of her ties with that place are cut?�

Joseph confirmed this, and I felt assured. Emily would be fine, perfectly fine, once we were home again. I was convinced of this. I didn&#8217;t want to hurry the trip, for the sake of her health, but I felt sure that she would be back to her old self when she was back in her home, with her children. I knew that the past six years had changed her, had hardened her a bit, but she was still the sweet, soft Emily that I&#8217;d always loved. It pained me that one so sweet, so giving and kind, would have to go through such terrible ordeals. And I was supposed to have protected her.

I distracted myself by bringing up a much lighter topic of conversation. The dining hall cleared of other patrons, I said, �Joseph, I&#8217;m sure that my wife has told you about how our relationship has always been somewhat�open. Sexually, I mean.�

Joseph nodded uneasily. �Still, I think that she did feel guilty for our�indiscretions,� he said.

I waved my hand. �I am not one to judge her,� I said. �You know that I have a pregnant mistress back at home? And this being the same woman who betrayed us. But,� I went on, �for the most part, our relationship has been quite a blessing, and we have shared our love with our friends. She has always been very generous,� I added, and Joseph nodded in agreement. �So, that being said,� I continued, �I&#8217;m sure you won&#8217;t mind my asking this: How many women have you slept with, besides my lovely wife?�

Joseph was startled by the question, to be sure, but he knew that he could not deny me an honest answer. He knew he owed me at least that much. �It&#8217;s only been her, and�and a young lady in London,� he confessed. �A girl friend from my younger days as a street urchin.�

I nodded. �I see. And, how many men?�

�I�I beg your pardon, sir?�

I smiled. �You understood my question perfectly, Joseph. How many men have you been with? Or have you lost count?�

Joseph went pale for a moment. But slowly, a smile played on his lips. �I&#8217;ll say, it has been several,� he admitted, his voice very quiet. Seeing that I was not passing judgment, he relaxed a bit. He explained that, while a young, poor boy in London, he had pleasured men in back alleys for a pittance (but enough to survive). While staying in the back of a pub, he&#8217;d been very intimate with the pub owner&#8217;s son�but had ended that relationship when he&#8217;d gone after his sister to America. He&#8217;d had a few trysts with men that he&#8217;d encountered in his travels, even making quite a few �friends� in San Francisco�including Dr. Connors.

As he explained all this, unraveling his sexual history to me, I silently nodded and kept my expression neutral. But the fantasies I&#8217;d been nursing became more vivid�yes, I was going to please my sweet wife, and I would make her forget her troubles for good. When Joseph was finished with his story, I finally ventured a question.

�Out of curiosity,� I said casually, �Why Emily?�

�Singer,� he said laughing, �You know the answer to that one. You see, at the place, she always tried to be as�discreet as possible. Asexual. But for me, it had quite the opposite effect, and I think it was the same for others. Her pretended severity and her soft-hearted nature�she glows with sexuality, don&#8217;t you agree?�

�Oh, yes,� I nodded. She&#8217;d been giving off that same glow since she was a curious little lady of 15. 

�I do happen to prefer men,� Joseph said, unnecessarily. �But I�I never had any other men with Mrs. Singer, I promise you that.�

�Did Emily know of your interest in men?� I asked.

�I daresay not,� he admitted. �I think I was afraid to admit it�not because of her religious ways, for I knew she would not disapprove, but because I�I thought she&#8217;d want someone else to join us.�

�She is adventurous,� I admitted with a sigh, though I could not allow myself to believe that she would be with two men (such a wild whore!) without me. �But she is a good girl.� I thought of her again, so distressed, not eating, exhausted, and pregnant, and I knew that my fantasies would have to wait. I gave Joseph what I hoped would be a seductive, knowing glance, before I stood. �I will see to her now. Goodnight, Joseph.�

�Goodnight, Singer,� he said, looking a bit disappointed.

�She&#8217;ll need a good night&#8217;s rest, I think,� I said, taking on my same pretended casual tone. �Perhaps you might call on us in the morning.� I left without another word, and I could feel the young man&#8217;s eyes watching me as I left the dining room.

I had not felt an attraction to another man since�well, since Sir Peter Wainwright. For you see, I had a sometimes-sexual relationship with my old friend, the best friend I&#8217;d ever had (besides his daughter, my own wife). We were not in love�I would not even say that we had been lovers. But occasionally�especially after the death of his wife Lady Anne, when I would go to spend a long weekend or holiday at Wainwright Hall�we would have some intimate time together. I blushed, actually blushed, as I thought of it again. I had not thought of that in so long�and yet, had it not always been in the back of my mind, as I&#8217;d been fucking his daughter?

I had not told Emily about these trysts with her father. How could I have told her about them when she was a little girl under my care? But as I went into our room, I decided that it was time to reveal any secrets that we&#8217;d been keeping from each other�and what better way to start than with that?

Emily was not sleeping when I entered. She rolled over and looked at me sadly, not rising from her pillow. �Hello, darling,� I cooed, and she forced a small, sweet little smile.

�Hello, sir.�

�I have supper for you, dear,� I said. I noted how pale she looked, how her little cheeks were slightly shrunken. My poor little angel! Before she could even think to protest, I added, �You will eat, my love. You must.�

�Yes, sir,� she said, and her smile did not look so forced as she sat up a little. I helped her to prop herself up on her pillows. I could not resist kissing her, a bit forcefully, before using my necktie to bind her wrists behind her back. She was giggling, so giddy�even after all she&#8217;d been through with her cruel &#8216;Mother,&#8217; she still enjoyed playing with her best friend. I kissed her again and ran my hand down her bare chest, giving her tit a little squeeze before breaking away to get her dinner plate.

My teasing proved to be enough to distract her, at least long enough for her to realize how hungry she was. She ate her entire dinner, allowing me to feed her as I lovingly rubbed her belly. At one point I felt her little child stirring inside of her, and I looked into my wife&#8217;s eyes, knowing she had felt it, too. I kissed her briefly and murmured, �Parentage aside, this is my child.�

�Yes, sir.�

�All the better,� I added in jest. �The child will be lovelier without my biological influence.�

Emily sighed and shook her head. �Oh, no, sir.�

�But Joseph is a handsome young man,� I said, and she looked at me in surprise. I smiled. �Yes, quite handsome. Almost�pretty.� I made my wife take another bite of her supper, and she chewed slowly, staring at me in curiosity. �Emily,� I said, �Don&#8217;t you think it would be fair if we both enjoyed the pleasure of Joseph&#8217;s company? We&#8217;ve always shared, haven&#8217;t we?� 

She swallowed and whispered, �You would, sir?�

�Yes, darling,� I said. �I would.� And I told her everything, of Joseph&#8217;s urges, and of my secret relationship with her father, which had started when we were still in school. She said nothing as I revealed this, and when I&#8217;d finished, she giggled in pleasure.

�Oh, sir, I knew it,� she said breathlessly. �I knew that you had my father��

�Actually, my darling,� I said, smirking (yet blushing again at the confession), �More often than not, your father had me.�

Emily gasped. So worldly she was, so far from innocent, yet I could still surprise and delight her. �Oh, sir,� she sighed.

I pushed her dirty dinner plates off the bed and leaned into her, keeping one protective hand upon her belly as I touched her face and kissed her. �Your father was a sometimes-timid man, but when we were alone�well, Emily, I can only imagine the fun that he and your mother had together.�

�Sir,� Emily said in surprise, �Surely you must have known my mother.�

I shook my head. �No, darling. I always told you that I did not know your mother well, and that is the truth. Sir Peter would not allow that. He wanted to have Lady Anne all for himself.� Had it been better if I had only allowed Emily to be mine? That question had haunted me for years, during our time apart. Together again, though, I knew we would not be able to resist our urges, and Joseph would be joining us quite soon.

I told Emily that I had invited Joseph to play with us in the morning. �But tonight, my angel,� I said, kissing her again, �You&#8217;re all mine.� She nodded and allowed me to untie her wrists, in order to reposition them behind her head, secured to the bars that made up the headboard. She pushed up her hips to meet me, craving me, moaning loudly without restraint. She needed me so much, her arousal revived by her short rest and the meal�and the shocking news that I&#8217;d given her.

I was not even tempted to tease her. I tore off my clothes and I fucked my pretty little wife well into the night, keeping her tied down and enjoying her body with my lips, my tongue, my hands, my cock. Every inch of her received attention, and after I&#8217;d covered the front side of her thoroughly with kisses and love bites while fucking her slowly, I flipped her over (on her side, so as not to crush the baby inside of her) and enjoyed her backside, fucking her ass while tracing my fingers over the faded scars on her back, and nibbled at her neck. She moaned and whimpered and begged for pleasure, and I fingered her clit, and when I&#8217;d finished fucking her ass, I went down on her, licking her to another orgasm as she gasped and screamed.

We were both exhausted and quite satisfied when I put her on her back again. Her chest still heaving, she looked up at me, smiling brightly. I loomed over her, snarling in that same teasing way that always turns her on, though my heart was bursting with love for her. I&#8217;d never let her go.

�Filthy whore,� I said lovingly. �Does this nasty slut need her friend to give her a bath?�

�Yes, sir,� she panted. �Please, sir, I&#8217;m a dirty little whore.�

�Yes you are,� I agreed. �So dirty,� I snarled in her ear, kissing and sucking on her neck as she giggled again. I would never grow tired of that tinkling little sound. Even in her later years, whenever Emily would giggle like that, she seemed so young and sweet again. But she was always sweet, always my precious, nasty little cunt, and at that moment, I loved her as much as I ever had.

We bathed together as we had so many times before, with my legs wrapped around her waist as I washed her belly and her tender breasts, teasing her nipples as she sighed. We said nothing as I washed her body, and her hair. We needed no words; as we held each other, we knew everything would be all right in the end. Even with so many unanswered questions, it would be all right. We were together.

After toweling my wife dry and spreading lotion on her soft body, I combed her wet hair as we sat in bed together, and I remembered doing the same on our first night together. So long ago�yet my feelings for her had not changed. If anything, I felt that I loved her more. We were pleasantly silent as I tucked her under the covers, and extinguished the lights before joining her. Her expanding body was still warm and slightly moist from our bath, and she smelled so sweet. I kissed her and held her, And as we slept peacefully that night, I felt that I was in heaven.


The next morning, I woke early to find that Emily had left my side. In a moment of panic, I turned over and looked around the room. She was sitting, already clothed, at the small desk in the corner of our room, busily writing. She felt my eyes upon her, and she looked up. �Good morning, sir.�

�Emily,� I scolded, �What are you doing up?� I took up my pocket watch from the bedside table, and noted that it was before six.

�I&#8217;m sorry, sir,� she said, rising from her seat and coming back to the bed slowly. �I am so used to getting up early.� I sat up and opened my arms to her, and she fell into my embrace, giggling sweetly again as I held her.

�What are you working on, my restless darling?� I asked, kissing her cheek.

�I&#8217;m just writing a letter to Tatiana,� she said. �I wanted to let her know that we will be coming home soon. I�I want to tell her to go back to Wainwright Hall.�

I frowned. �Beatrice will be showing. I have no doubt that she&#8217;s larger than you are now.� I knew how concerned Emily had always been for her reputation among our old friends and neighbors. 

She sighed. �Oh, sir, people will talk. They&#8217;ll talk when we return, you know they will. And as Tatiana has always said, what are we to do about it? I want our children to be home, sir,� she said, almost firmly. �I want Beatrice to be cared for by Dr. Yates. He�� she asked hesitantly, �He&#8217;s still practicing, isn&#8217;t he, sir?�

She didn&#8217;t have the heart to ask if he were still alive. After all, Dr. Yates was an old man. He had already been practicing for 20 years when he&#8217;d delivered Lady Emily herself. I smiled and said, �Dr. Yates is quite well, and he has been seeing to Peter all these years.�

�Peter?� Emily asked, very concerned. I regretted my words; I had not yet hinted to Emily that her son had not been well. �What is the matter with our Peter?�

�He&#8217;s only a little small for his age, darling,� I said gently, but her face fell. She was clearly very distressed. �Not to worry, Emily. Our boy is quite well. He&#8217;s a good boy, and he always plays well with his sister. He&#8217;s fine, darling.� I felt that I was lying to her as I said this, and when we returned home, my lies would be revealed. But at that moment, I was most concerned about Emily. 

�Oh, sir, we must get home,� she said helplessly.

�We will, my love, don&#8217;t worry,� I said. �You may write Tatiana and send everyone home. I think you are right, my dear, Wainwright Hall is the best place for all of us. It will be lovely for them all to be home, waiting for you.�

We still avoided the topic of Mrs. Gainsley, though Emily had expressed that she wanted her to return to our home as well. My big-hearted Emily! I resisted the urge to play again, and I allowed Emily to return to the desk and finish her letter as I rose and dressed myself.

Around seven, we were ready to seek our breakfast, but there came a knock at the door. Emily opened it to find Joseph, holding an enormous platter of breakfast foods, and he hurried in and placed it on the small table. Emily greeted her friend with a warm kiss on the cheek. �Good morning, Joseph. Where is Alice?�

�Still in bed, I daresay,� Joseph said. He shook my hand in greeting, and I could feel him trembling slightly. �I thought you would like some breakfast.�

�Thank you, Joseph,� I said, motioning for he and Emily to sit at the table. But Emily turned to him with imploring eyes.

�Joseph, would you mind getting the portrait? I think it&#8217;s time to show it to my husband,� she said, and when she turned to me, I saw a mischievous look in her eyes. What kind of surprise did my darling have for me?

Joseph nodded and went back to his room. Emily came and sat upon my lap at the table, and I kissed her cheek. �Naughty little girl,� I said lovingly, and she gently ran her hands through my hair (much greyer than when we were first parted).

�Oh, sir,� she murmured, �You are so handsome. You ought to let Joseph paint your portrait.�

�Let&#8217;s see yours first,� I said. �Will I be pleased with it?�

�Oh, yes, sir,� Emily said, smiling wickedly. �I think you will enjoy it.� She rose from my lap when Joseph entered the open door with the canvas-draped frame, and she closed and locked it as he sat the portrait down on a chair, propping it against the back. I stood, and my wife joined me at my side, as Joseph carefully removed the canvas from the portrait.

It was a pleasant surprise, to say the least. Joseph&#8217;s talent was evident in the way he had captured my beloved&#8217;s beauty, and he had painted her as though she stood in the shadows in front of a dark window, wearing absolutely nothing, turned away so that her entire ass, and one perky little tit, was visible, as she peeked coyly over her shoulder. I gaped at the painting and approached it slowly, wanting to touch it.

My wife embraced me. �Oh, sir, I knew you would like it.�

�I love it,� I said weakly. I imagined hanging it on the wall in my office�ah, but how could I get any work completed with my naked wife teasing me so? As much as I adored that painting, and as much as it turned me on that morning, it would end up in an unused room at Wainwright Hall, hidden away for our private pleasure.

�Joseph,� I finally managed, turning my attention to the handsome, shy young man, �How can I thank you for this gift?�

�If it is not offensive to Emily, I�� Joseph was timid, but when my wife, clinging to my arm, gave him an encouraging smile, he said, �If you&#8217;d allow me to suck your cock, I��

His eyes widened as I lowered my trousers, not even hesitating for a moment. I could feel my wife tensing up at my side; she would be very excited to watch this. Indeed, I ordered her to sit down as Joseph approached me, eyeing my hard cock. He met my eye and gave me an approving nod. Knowing as many as cocks as the young man had seen (and sucked, surely), I took this as a compliment.

He did not hesitate in going to his knees. I could sense him looking up at me as he slowly took my cock in his experienced mouth, but my eyes were on my Emily. Her chest was heaving, her eyes shining with desire, as she watched me receive pleasure. And though I admit that I found Joseph strangely attractive, I was most excited by the prospect of really playing with my wife again. The same naughty but harmless games we had always enjoyed with each other and others.

�Take off your dress, Emily,� I grunted, moaning as Joseph ran his tongue slowly under my shaft, before taking my large balls in his mouth. �Oh, Christ,� I hissed, seizing my cock as the young man sucked my testicles. The boy knew what he was doing�undoubtedly, he had honed his skills while earning his bread on the streets. 

As he took my shaft fully down his throat again, I seized the back of his head, taking his curls in my hand, and rammed my cock into him, staring at my wife. One small hand rested on her belly; the other was stroking her slit, waiting for my permission to pleasure herself. I grinned. �You like this, Emily? Your lover is a good cocksucker, my love, he might teach you a couple of tricks.�

�Oh, he has, sir,� Emily assured me, letting out a moan of desire. I saw her fingering her clit, the sweet bud peeking out, visible to me as my wife spread her legs wider, invitingly. 

�You want me, Emily?� I asked. Ah, but Joseph was craving me, and I could not resist pulling out from him and spraying in his face. Indeed, he relished in it, opening his mouth wide and devouring me. I laughed aloud, almost giddy with power, as I watched my wife eyeing me with desire. 

�Joseph,� I said, �Wash your face.� The young man obediently went to our bathroom, and I went to my knees before my wife and stuck my head between her legs, lapping at her slowly. She ran her fingers through my hair, moaning, but not begging me to go faster. She was enjoying it so much, though I couldn&#8217;t imagine that she was enjoying it more than I�had that been so, she would have literally burst.

She did scream and explode into my mouth, and I drank up her sweet juices. My darling, my only one�I made a decision at that moment, and after wiping my own face, I sat with my love and our lover, and gave them my orders. 

�Joseph,� I said, �You have known Emily better than anyone else, other than myself. I am grateful that you offered her comfort. But I am her husband, and her master,� I said, and I turned to Emily. She smiled at me, adoring me, and I knew she would not be opposed to my decision. �You may play with us, but her sweet little pussy is mine. All mine.�

Emily put her head on my shoulder. Joseph nodded in agreement, and I understood that his attachment to my wife was an emotional one, more than a physical one. He smiled when I added, �You may, of course, have access to her ass�as long as she is so willing.� I ran a hand through my Emily&#8217;s hair and she looked up at me, smiling, and I knew that she would be happy again, that she did not regret my coming for her.

As though to seal the terms of our agreement, Joseph and I shared my wife on the bed. Joseph lubricated his circumcised cock before entering my wife&#8217;s willing ass (I knew that he&#8217;d had her there many times before). Emily was on her hands and knees, kneeling with her legs spread and her ass stuck up in the air. Joseph fucked her at an angle, to the left, and I positioned myself to the right and thrust into her gaping, dripping cunt. Emily groaned as we pumped into her, her forehead resting on the thick pillows as we thrust awkwardly into her. We eventually found our pace, both fucking her hard, and she whimpered and cried for more.

I understood my wife very well as her lover and I fucked her simultaneously. She so enjoyed giving pleasure to others, to people whom she loved. She loved Joseph; that was a fact, she did not hide it and I did not mind. She offered him pleasure, as she had offered pleasure to so many others, and to me especially, for she loved me best. There was nothing for her to be ashamed of. She used her body to make others feel good.

Joseph had the pleasure of cleaning Emily&#8217;s ass with his tongue after we both came. I sat beside Emily and stroked her back with one hand and teased her clit with the other, feeling her tremble with desire. �Oh, please, sir,� she whispered. �May I come again, please?�

�Does my whore deserve to come?� I asked, rubbing her just a little more roughly. �Have you been my good girl, Emily?�

�Oh, sir, I&#8217;ve tried,� she sighed, sounding distressed. I had not meant to tease her.

�There now, whore, you are my good girl,� I assured her, fingering her gaping, dripping cunt. �Your friend would like to make you come, please do, just for me, love.�

I rubbed her as Joseph wriggled his tongue in her asshole, and she moaned and came with a short, choked cry. When I helped her to turn and sit up, her pretty face was stained with tears. I took my handkerchief and wiped them gently. �There, now, my dear,� I said with a smile. �We&#8217;ve had our proper playtime again. We still have our fun, don&#8217;t we, Emily?�

�Yes, sir,� she said, smiling, though I still was not certain if she was truly pleased. �Thank you, sir.� She smiled at her former lover, who stood awkwardly by, still naked. �Thank you, Joseph. I&#8217;m so glad that we&#8217;re all friends now.�

Joseph nodded. I stood and kissed him briefly, which surprised him and made Emily giggle a little. �Thank you, Joseph,� I echoed my wife. �We will see you for dinner this afternoon?�

Joseph took the hint, and he dressed quickly and left with a smile. He certainly seemed pleased with our new arrangement�but how did my wife, though physically satisfied, truly feel about it? I joined her on the bed, and put my arms around her. �How are you feeling, Emily?� I asked.

�Oh, sir, I really am glad that we&#8217;re all friends,� Emily said. �That&#8217;s all worked out better than I could have imagined.�

�But what&#8217;s troubling you, Emily?� I asked. I noticed her hesitation, and it shamed me. �Come, now, my dear,� I said gently, stroking her face. A part of me still couldn&#8217;t believe that I had her again. I was determined that she would trust me completely, that she would know that I would never harm her in any way. �You can tell me anything, Emily. Open up to your friend.�

�I just feel so awful about how things ended,� she whispered, and I knew that she meant with Mrs. Morrison. �I was angry enough to kill her, at one time. More than once,� she admitted. �But after she was really dead, I thought�well, sir, if I could change it all, if I could go back, I would have wanted it to end peaceable. It almost did, I suppose�I know I wanted her to have the chance to redeem herself.�

�I know, my love,� I said patiently. �But there is nothing to be done for it now, is there?�

Emily sighed. �No, sir. It is too late for Mrs. Morrison, and that&#8217;s�that&#8217;s just how it is, I suppose.� She was on the verge of tears again, but I allowed her to continue. �But sir, that&#8217;s why we must be merciful to Beatrice.�

I was not surprised by this declaration. Emily continued, �I have been thinking it over, sir, and Beatrice is our friend. In spite of what has passed,� she plowed on, as I almost spoke a protest (for what friend of ours would treat us in such a way?), �I think that we ought to let her stay with us. I�I do love her, sir, for taking care of you and our children while I&#8217;ve been away.�

�But if it weren&#8217;t for her,� I said, a little less patiently, �you wouldn&#8217;t have been away.�

Emily shook her head. �Not necessarily, sir,� she said. �Somehow�somehow Lydia would have gotten me. That was her way, sir. She always took what she wanted.� She sighed again, and I took her hand. �The decision is ultimately yours, sir, but I have forgiven Beatrice for everything, and I hope you will do the same.�

What else could I do? In spite of my anger towards her, I loved Beatrice. Emily knew this, and she understood me as I understood her. �My dear, I have always said that Wainwright Hall is your home. And if you wish for Beatrice to remain there with us, then so be it.�

�Oh, sir, this really is the only way,� Emily said, smiling a little. �After all, your child would remain with you, and a child should never be without its mother.� She frowned a bit. �Oh, sir, we really do need to hurry home.�

�We will leave tomorrow, Emily,� I promised her. And so we did. Our party of four left Omaha, and just as I had been fortunate in my smooth travels westward, we were able to secure passage back east with ease. My travels were much more enjoyable this time around, with both Emily and Joseph to play with on the ship, while Alice was distracted by everything else that was going on around her.

As our ship finally arrived in London, my Emily (bigger now, so big that I swore to put her to bed as soon as we were home, and not let her rise again until she&#8217;d given birth) trembled with excitement, so much so that she could not pack our things. I had her sit down as I did it myself, and she chattered excitedly. �Oh, sir, I cannot wait to hold our darlings in my arms again!� she declared happily. I could not resist stopping to kiss her, for she was so radiantly beautiful that morning. Glowing with happiness, with hope. Her cheeks were full and back to their normal coloring, thanks to my strict care. I felt that our troubles were behind us for good.

Ah, but we were in for an unpleasant shock upon our homecoming, one that would ruin Emily&#8217;s perfect dream for our lives together.


 I was surprised when Emily proposed staying for one night in London, rather than taking the first train home. �I think that is a good idea, my dear,� I said. �But why the change of heart?�

�Sir,� Emily said quietly, pulling me aside from Alice and Joseph as they stood near our rented carriage, �Joseph told me that he wishes to see his old friend.� I remembered what I had learned about Joseph&#8217;s former lover, the pub owner&#8217;s son. �I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s too much to ask, and I don&#8217;t wish to leave him behind and proceed homeward without him.�

�Fair enough, Emily,� I agreed. I did not speak of this to Joseph, but as our carriage took us to a hotel, I noticed how excited he looked. Ah, but this was nothing compared to Emily, or Alice for that matter.

I addressed the girl as we rode along. �I&#8217;ve had word sent to your brothers and sisters about your arrival. They don&#8217;t live far from the city.�

�Will we have time to see them, sir?� Alice asked.

�I&#8217;m afraid not,� I said. �We&#8217;ll be leaving tomorrow, but I imagine that you&#8217;ll be paying them a visit quite soon. You&#8217;ll get to meet your sister-in-law and nephew tomorrow.�

�Tatiana,� Alice said, remembering what she&#8217;d been told. She said to Lady Emily, �She&#8217;s your best friend, Mrs. Singer?�

�Oh, yes, she&#8217;s wonderful,� Emily said, and though she&#8217;d told the girl the same thing many times since we&#8217;d left Omaha, she spoke with as much enthusiasm as ever. �We grew up together in the countryside. You&#8217;ll never meet a more loving person than your Tatiana.� Tears filled my wife&#8217;s eyes briefly, for I knew she had missed her friends deeply, but she was happy that she would be reunited with them soon.

At the hotel, we secured two adjacent suites. Joseph stayed only long enough to see that his sister was settled, and he stopped into our rooms briefly before parting. �Depending on how it all turns out, I may not return until morning,� he admitted with blushing cheeks. �But I swear that I&#8217;ll make it back in time to take the first train out.�

�We&#8217;ll see to Alice,� Emily promised, and kissed him on the cheek on his way out. �Goodnight, Joseph.�

After closing the door, Emily turned and looked at me, smiling radiantly. �Oh, sir,� she declared, �everything really is going to be all right, isn&#8217;t it?�

�Oh, yes, darling,� I promised (a lie, a damned lie). I opened my arms and she stepped into my embrace. How do you suppose our evening progressed from there?

As promised, Joseph joined us the next morning in time for an early breakfast. The girls hardly ate, they were both so excited, but I did manage to coax a little food down Emily&#8217;s throat. We made our way to the station, unburdened by our luggage, as it was already waiting for us there. We secured passage and were on our way home, to arrive by the afternoon.

Emily did not leave our compartment at all during the train ride, though I could tell by her discomforted expression that she needed to relieve her bladder. I knew she was afraid to run into anyone we knew, and her fear mounted as we came closer to home. I took her hand and squeezed it, and neither of us said a word.

Emily would later admit that she&#8217;d been tempted to wear a black veil and to take Alice&#8217;s hand, to cover up her identity as we arrived at the train station. But she held her head up and did not let go of my hand as we stepped onto the platform. If we were seen by any acquaintances, we didn&#8217;t know it; we hurried from the station to a rented carriage, and Emily finally looked at ease as we left the busy village and made our way to Wainwright Hall.

�Your sister-in-law ought to be there waiting for us, and she&#8217;ll send for your brother,� Emily told our friends. �Oh, I really cannot wait for you both to meet her, to be home again. Oh, I&#8217;m so happy!� She still had not let go of my hand, and she turned to me, smiling brightly. I knew she was happy, perhaps happier than she&#8217;d been in a very long time, even before we were first parted. If only it could have lasted!

When the carriage pulled in front of Wainwright Hall, I had to keep Emily (pregnant belly and all) from jumping out of the carriage. She allowed me to hand her down, and she eagerly led Joseph and Alice inside. Mrs. Shelton, having heard us coming, was waiting for us alone in the hall.

�Lady Emily,� she said, smiling and embracing her friend heartily. �I received your letters, dear, I&#8217;m so glad that you&#8217;re home.�

�Sweet Tatiana,� Emily said, crying tears of joy and kissing her friend&#8217;s cheek. �Meet your brother- and sister-in-law, my darlings Joseph and Alice Shelton.� 

As Mrs. Shelton tearfully greeted her lost family members, I saw Emily looking about anxiously. �Tatiana,� I said, �Where are the children?�

At that moment, Mina appeared. I was startled by how much older she seemed at that moment, as she came down the hall. But, seeing her mother, her face crumpled. �Mummy, is it you?� she asked.

�Oh, my dear little Mina,� Emily cried, and Mina fell into her mother&#8217;s arms, crying pitifully. �There, now, my precious love, I&#8217;m so sorry for all of it�I won&#8217;t ever leave you again, Mina, Mummy is here now, don&#8217;t cry.�

�Mummy, it&#8217;s horrible!� Mina managed between sobs, crying against her mother&#8217;s shoulder. I glanced at Tatiana, who held young Alice&#8217;s hand; her face was pale. �Mummy,� Mina said, �Peter died, he&#8217;s dead!�

Emily blanched as Mina stepped away from her, still crying. �Oh, no,� Emily whispered. �No, no, it can&#8217;t�no.� I stepped toward her at the right moment, as I was able to catch her as her knees gave out, and she fainted into my arms.





















Lady Emily&#8217;s Diary

27 March, 18&#8212;

After a fortnight of being confined to our bed, my husband has finally allowed me to take out my diary and put my thoughts to paper. Since our disastrous homecoming, he has insisted that I remain still and quiet at all times, and he has Dr. Yates&#8217;s wise opinion to back him up. But he knows that I cannot stop myself from thinking, and as we agree that I should not take medicine to sleep in my condition, he has relented.

I have not stopped mourning the death of my dear little Peter. I had not seen my sweet little boy since he was a tiny baby, and now he is dead and buried. I have not known such pain since the death of my father. I have cried so much, and my dear Mr. Singer, my loving husband, has held me and tried to comfort me, though he grieves himself.

Poor man! He was not honest with me about our son&#8217;s condition, but I know that he believed in his heart that Peter would be all right. Mr. Singer is mostly a level-headed man, and this is one of the qualities that I most admire in him, but he can delude himself at times. I am afraid that I have the same weakness.

Dr. Yates revealed the truth to me. We had a long conversation when my husband sent for him, after I collapsed in the foray upon our arrival. My husband picked me up and put me to bed, and here I have stayed. I came to my senses before the doctor arrived, and my husband was sitting beside me. I had never seen him so distressed.

�Our Peter,� I whispered, and he nodded, touching my face.

�Tatiana says that he died three days ago,� he said. �He is going to be buried tomorrow, beside your parents.�

�I want to see him,� I begged, but my husband would not allow that. I cried, I am certain that I became hysterical, and my husband straddled my waist, seizing my wrists and forcing me down against the pillows.

�Be calm, Emily,� he said, so patiently, though his grip on me was very tight. I struggled against him weakly, but he held me, and allowed me to cry. �Emily, my love, think of your child��

�My child is dead,� I cried, and I quit my struggling and allowed my husband to hold me. I tried to calm myself, knowing that the doctor would be coming, but my husband was still drying my tears when he arrived.

Mr. Singer hesitantly left me alone with Dr. Yates, and I knew that he was standing right outside the bedchamber door the entire time. Dr. Yates sat beside me and examined me calmly, asking me questions about my pregnancy. I have had no pain, hardly any illness. It has been my easiest pregnancy of my three. I could feel Joseph&#8217;s child moving inside of me as I was being examined, and Dr. Yates seemed assured that I was well enough.

�Dr. Yates,� I said, �Please, what happened to my son?� 

The doctor, who has known me longer than anyone, even my dear Mr. Singer, spoke gently but honestly. �Peter was always small for his age, Lady Emily, and more prone to ailments, but�perhaps only a little more than his own mother.�

I was not a sickly child, but I did have that recurring nervous condition. It tapered off as I grew older, and especially after I came to belong to my dear Mr. Singer, though I suppose it has manifested itself in my frequent insomnia. Dr. Yates continued, �His symptoms were quite similar to those that your father exhibited before his death. I do believe that he was struck down by the same illness.�

�Poor Peter!� I declared.

�Lady Emily,� Dr. Yates said calmly, �From what I understand, you have been through quite a traumatic experience. You have been�abroad, these past few years?�

�Yes,� I said uneasily. �Yes, and�it was a most unpleasant experience.� That&#8217;s all I would say to that, and Dr. Yates did not pry.

�That, with the shock you have suffered upon your arrival home, is an enormous amount of stress to bear. For the remainder of your pregnancy, you must stay in bed and rest as much as possible. No physically strenuous activities,� he said with a knowing look, and I felt myself blush a little. 

Dr. Yates was about to leave, but I asked, �Please, and how is Mrs. Gainsley?�

�She came out of it quite well,� he replied. �The fate of the child was uncertain for a time, but it seems that the danger has passed. She was born so early.�

�Her child has been born?� I asked, amazed. Dr. Yates went to give his orders to my husband, who has been following them strictly ever since. When Mr. Singer came back to my side, I said, �Sir, have you seen to your daughter yet?�

�Mina has calmed down,� he assured me. �And I will allow you to see her again tomorrow, after you&#8217;ve had a chance to rest.�

�Thank you, sir,� I said. �But I meant the baby. Beatrice&#8217;s baby.�

He frowned. �No,� he admitted. 

�Go and see her,� I insisted. �I am fine, sir, really, I&#8217;m going to rest quietly here, I promise.�

My husband was hesitant, even afraid of seeing Beatrice again I think, but he kissed my forehead and left me alone. I lay quietly, and when I thought of my poor Peter again, I cried. I was tempted to leave the bed and go to the parlor, where his casket would lay, but I did not want to disobey my husband. 

The door to the bedchamber opened, but it was not my husband. My Mina came to me, looking so distressed, the poor dear. �Do you feel all right, Mummy?� she asked carefully.

I forced a smile. �Yes, Mina, I&#8217;m all right. Come and lay with me, darling.� And she did, and I was at least able to fall asleep for a little while with my daughter in my arms. Since my arrival home, I have tried to be cheerful and happy around her. I am truly happy to be with her, I remind myself to be grateful that she is at least alive and well and I know she has missed me and has been waiting for me. I don&#8217;t want to spoil her happiness.

I awoke briefly when my husband entered the room. It had grown dark, but he did not light any candles. He came and spoke to Mina quietly, not realizing that I was awake. �Stay with Mummy, all right, angel? I&#8217;m going to have a long talk with Auntie Bea. You&#8217;ll come and find me if Mummy needs anything?�

�Yes, Daddy,� Mina responded, and I felt him kneel down and kiss Mina on the forehead.

�You&#8217;re a good girl, Mina. Mummy is so glad to be home with you again.�

�She&#8217;s very sad, Daddy.�

�She&#8217;ll be all right,� Mr. Singer said, sounding confident. �We&#8217;ll be all be fine, darling. We&#8217;re together again.�

After he left, we slept a while more. I knew that my husband did not return to us until very early in the morning. I woke when he entered and we looked at each other briefly; the poor man looked so tired. We said nothing as he climbed into bed, our daughter lying between us, and we slept for a little while longer. 

By midmorning, I was awake again as Mr. Singer sent our daughter from the room. He kissed me softly. �Good morning.� He rose and began preparing for our son&#8217;s funeral, which I would not be attending. As he dressed and I watched him silently, he explained what he would tell the other mourners, regarding my return (as I had surely been spotted in the station or the village by someone we know). �I will simply say that you were forced to go abroad, and that you&#8217;ve had a troublesome experience. We&#8217;ll let everyone get used to the idea�you&#8217;ll be tucked away for some time, anyway, so��

�Oh, sir,� I said, �I truly do not care what anyone else thinks.�

My husband, straightening the cuffs of his shirt, smiled weakly. �I had a very interesting talk with Beatrice last night.� He promised to give me all of the details after the service, but he added, �She stayed right by his side as he lay dying.�

�She&#8217;s always loved Peter,� I said. I did not regret my decision to treat her mercifully, though she&#8217;s had a very different idea about what that means, as I would soon find out. 

I was upset that I could not attend my own son&#8217;s funeral, but my husband reminded me of the doctor&#8217;s orders. I am now grateful to have been spared the misery. When my husband returned, bringing lunch for me, he was completely pale, and cried a little even as he forced me to eat. I obeyed him readily, knowing that he did not have the strength to fight me, so weighed down was he by his sorrow. We lay together quietly�that&#8217;s all we have been able to do, with my condition, but even that feels so good. Even with all of the pain we have suffered, we are still together, and it is still wonderful.

That evening, after we&#8217;d had our dinner (for my husband has taken every one of his meals in our room with me, not wanting me to be alone too often), Mr. Singer wanted to discuss his conversation with Beatrice. I knew that he wished to take our minds off of our tragedy, and I eagerly listened, and was more than surprised by what I heard.

�As I&#8217;m sure you may imagine, she claims to feel awful for the way she has treated you,� Mr. Singer said, his tone a touch mocking.

�Do you believe she is, sir?�

He frowned slightly, thoughtfully. �I do,� he admitted. �But she is no idiot�I still cannot understand why��

�Has she tried to explain herself, sir?� I asked, though I needed no explanation. I understood Beatrice&#8217;s motives completely�understood them, and sympathized whole-heartedly. 

My husband sighed, clearly agitated. �I cannot understand her excuses, Emily. But,� he added, finding his poise, �I have forgiven her.�

�As have I.�

�She has not forgiven herself,� he continued. �She wants desperately to make it all up to you. She begs to speak with you herself, but�I think that must wait. But I want to tell you her proposal. I must confess, darling,� he added, �I am quite pleased with it myself.�

My curiosity peaked; I bade my husband to continue. �In exchange for your &#8216;merciful kindness&#8217; (her words, not mine, dear), and for you to raise her child as your own, she wants to give herself to you. Completely.�

I gaped. �I&#8217;m afraid that I don&#8217;t��

�Don&#8217;t you, darling?� Mr. Singer asked teasingly, smirking. �She wants you to have her the same way that I have you�or more accurately, how damned Mrs. Morrison had you. But she is willing, Emily, she is quite willing, and eager to be yours.�

�I don&#8217;t believe this.�

�I couldn&#8217;t, either,� my husband declared, and he could not resist laughing. I could see the humor in it, the once-timid Mrs. Gainsley offering herself up to me as my little toy, but I was too shocked to laugh. �Emily, you are not offended by this, are you?�

�Oh, no, sir,� I answered truthfully. �I am quite surprised, though. She�do you think she is sincere?�

�We spoke on the subject all last night,� he said. �Though she was able to fool me for a very long time, I�I have no doubt that she wants this. Or rather, she has convinced herself that she needs it. She needs atonement.�

�But I have forgiven her,� I protested. �I do not wish to exploit her guilt for our pleasure. That would not be right.�

�Oh, no, darling,� my husband agreed. �No, you&#8217;re absolutely right, my dear. The fact of the matter is, this is the only way that she could still be with me as well.�

I thought on this. I feel honestly that Beatrice has every right to love my husband. Why shouldn&#8217;t she? After all she&#8217;d done, he&#8217;d never want her again for himself, but�if she were mine, she would get to stay with us, in her rightful home, among her real family. For a moment, I pitied her�but then, I could not resist thinking of the fun we might have with such an arrangement�

�And you do like this, sir?� I asked. My husband admitted that he liked it very much. Ah! He still loved her, he really did, and I smiled at that. We could keep our strange little family together and add to our happiness, not take any more away from it. �Sir, I�I think I&#8217;d need to speak with her myself before I can decide.�

�Let&#8217;s give it a couple of days,� my husband said with a nod, and so it was. Over the next couple of days, only my husband and Mina were allowed in the room. Mina enjoyed being with me, but in short intervals after that first night. She has an abundance of spirit, and must run and be active, and when she grows restless sitting and talking with me, I dismiss her with a smile, knowing that I will see her again soon, that she is happy playing on the grounds of Wainwright Hall.

Ah, but such images bring to mind the loss of my son, and I shed an impossible number of tears those first couple of days. I was crying in such a way, in tiny sobs that I muffled with my hand lest my husband hear them and worry more, when Beatrice came to me. I looked at her in surprise, my vision blurry with tears. �Lady Emily, may I�oh, what&#8217;s the matter, my lady?� she asked, startled by my crying. She knelt down beside the bed and placed a comforting hand on my forehead. I seized her hand in my own and held it as I sobbed. She said, �Oh, Lady Emily, I&#8217;m so sorry for everything! This is all my fault, I��

�Oh, Beatrice,� I said with a smile, even as my tears still flowed. �Peter&#8217;s dying is not your fault. Mina told me how you stayed right by his side, and�I&#8217;m so grateful to you, my dear.�

She was crying now as well. �I don&#8217;t deserve your kindness, none of it!�

�Please be calm,� I said, and I sat up a little and wiped my own tears. �Come, Beatrice, sit on the bed with me. My husband told me about your offer, and I wanted to speak with you.�

She obeyed me, and I took her hand again. �I want you to understand,� I said, �That you are still my dear friend. No, do not speak yet, dear. I forgive everything, I really do. Don&#8217;t�don&#8217;t think that you have to do anything to seek my forgiveness.�

�For what I&#8217;ve done, I&#8217;ve damned myself,� Beatrice said. She always had a way of being overdramatic, but I listened as she said, �You and Sir Aaron have shown me more kindness than anyone ever has. I�I was angry, Lady Emily, when I learned the truth about my husband,� she admitted, not looking me in the eye. �But I realized�it was for Tatiana, and she&#8217;d done it for me, and if she hadn&#8217;t, I�well, I don&#8217;t know what my life would be like.� She looked into my eyes again. �But it would not be as good as the one you have given me!

�You know this well, but I am in love with your husband. In another sense, I am in love with you as well. Lady Emily, I�I really did think that you loved Mrs. Morrison the most, and that you wanted some way to be with her. Or rather�� she said, looking away again, �I made myself believe it.�

�Oh, I did love Mrs. Morrison,� I admitted. �But not more than my husband, Beatrice. I&#8217;ve never loved anyone more than I love him.�

�And he loves you most,� Beatrice added, almost a little bitterly. �And my husband loved you&nbsp; most. And I was jealous, Lady Emily, terribly jealous. Yes, it was jealousy that drove me to do it,� she said, as though it were a revelation of sorts, and not something that I already knew well.

�And what right have I, to envy the one woman, besides my own sister, who has been kind to me and has loved me?� she continued sadly. �God is punishing me for my envy, Lady Emily. I have no milk to give to my child.� She sobbed, and I held her, and could not image the horror of her situation. How much pleasure have I had in providing my children with my loving milk, in giving the same to my eager husband? 

�Tatiana has been providing,� Beatrice continued. �But she has her own nursing child, and she is with child again, and she has been away from her husband&#8217;s home for so long already! The fact that you&#8217;ve come home with child, and will be nursing again�and the child belongs to your husband�it&#8217;s the only way. I want you to have my child. Please have her, Lady Emily,� she begged, crying more.

Oh, how I truly pitied her then! She did not want me to be a wet nurse, she wanted me to be a mother. The one thing she&#8217;d longed for, and waited so long for, and she was giving it up. But there was no talking&nbsp; her out of it. She also presented her case for becoming my slave. �I want you to treat me the way that Mrs. Morrison treated you,� she said. �Tatiana allowed me to read your letters�I&#8217;m terribly sorry if I wasn&#8217;t meant to do so��

�Oh, no, that&#8217;s all right,� I said. I was glad that she had a grasp of my situation. 

�I didn&#8217;t know�I really didn&#8217;t think she would be so cruel,� she whispered shamefully.

�Beatrice,� I confessed, �I�I hated being away from my family, from my husband and children and you as well, but�what she did to me, I didn&#8217;t�I enjoyed much of it�� I knew I was blushing, and I felt a tingle run through me. I couldn&#8217;t let myself get too excited, as there was nothing to be done about it, doctor&#8217;s orders.

�But dear,� I added, �I have no desire to be cruel to you. You are my friend, Beatrice, and I love you.� I smiled, and she looked so surprised, as though she&#8217;d never quite believed in my love for her until that moment.

�Would you have me, Lady Emily?� she asked softly. �Would you let me stay here and be yours?�

I leaned forward (with some difficulty, due to my expanding belly), and Beatrice leaned in to me, and I kissed her softly, a tender, loving kiss, and I was so happy to have her. If she thought that it would save her, well�all the better. I do not yet regret my decision to keep her, as I will soon explain. 

But I must cease in my writing; my husband has silently come into the room, and is sitting and looking at me sternly, though allowing me to finish. I will explain the terms of our new situation when I am permitted to write again.


4 April, 18&#8212;

It is a lovely spring afternoon, and my husband has opened the windows in the bedchamber to allow me a little fresh air. He knows I am becoming stir-crazy, but I try to remain calm. Beatrice has been very kind to entertain me, and I am not simply referring to the sexual shows that she puts on for me with my husband (as I will explain). On quiet afternoons, as I lay with my eyes closed (on my husband&#8217;s insistence, I snooze or feign sleep for much of the day), Beatrice reads aloud to me. Her voice is so soft, so soothing as she reads quietly, just loud enough for me to hear her. 

The other morning, she was reading aloud from a rather poignant scene in a novel, in which a child dies. I noticed a subtle change in her voice, but she did not cease reading. Opening my eyes, I saw her tears flowing, and I reached out and took her hand. �I know, dear,� I said softly.

Beatrice sniffled. �Oh, my lady, please forgive me, but I did love little Peter as though he were my own��

�I know it, and I&#8217;m so glad, my friend,� I assured her, and it was true. At least in my absence, my son was well loved. �You were more of a mother to him than I was.�

�And look how he turned out,� she moaned briefly, but she shook her head and calmed herself. �I&#8217;m sorry, my lady. Sir Aaron warned me not to upset you��

�You may speak with me, Beatrice,� I assured her. �Unburden yourself to me, my friend, do. My dear husband means well, but I am not quite so delicate as he wants to believe me to be.�

At my insistence, Beatrice told me stories of Peter growing up. He took after me in some ways, sometimes melancholy, always polite and kindly, never disobeying his aunties or Daddy and always getting on with his older sister. I am quite proud of my sweet little boy, but even more sorry that I did not ever know him myself. Only as a tiny suckling�I only have those sweet memories of my lost child.

But just as often as I am saddened by the loss of my child (and admittedly, everything else that has happened these past few months, these past few years�I do not know how I have come through it all right), I am delighted by some of the aspects of our new arrangement. I am quite fond of the sweet little baby, Beatrice and my Mr. Singer&#8217;s daughter.

The poor little dear had not even been named when we had arrived home. Beatrice had not wanted to give the girl a name without our approval, though it was not until the death of Peter that she became resolute in her decision to give her up. My husband had taken to calling the little girl after her mother, and so she is young Beatrice. She is a darling little thing, so tiny, for she was born at seven months. But she has a healthy coloring now, a slightly darker shade like her mother&#8217;s side of the family, and is even beginning to fill out a bit (a chubby thing, as her mother is). She has some of the same sharp features as my husband, his chin and nose, and big dark eyes like her mother. She is beautiful.

My husband allows me a little time to bond with the child each day, for he has felt all along that I should raise her as my own. She is still nursed by her Auntie Ana, but I will be with milk again soon after my own child is born. I cannot wait, not only so that I will finally know my newest little love, who has been with me through some very difficult times, but also so that I might get up from this bed! And so that I might really get to play again�I do feel terribly restless, though my husband tries to keep me satisfied without putting strain on my body, licking me sweetly while I moan, grinding my pussy into my master&#8217;s face. 

As noted, my husband plays quite a bit with Beatrice, and always in my presence. This was my idea. After I&#8217;d first spoken with her, and we had an agreement about our arrangement, I recalled the conversation in private with my husband. He looked very pleased; it had all worked out just the way he&#8217;d intended, and I was happy to comply. �Sir,� I said, �While I am bedridden and unable to play with you, I&#8217;d like for you to get your pleasure from Beatrice.�

�As you wish, my dear,� my husband said with a grin. He pronounced that anything they did would be done before me and at my command. �I must tell you, darling, that when I learned that she&#8217;d betrayed us, I told her that I would never please her again. And I am going to keep my word at that.�

�Very well, sir,� I said. He meant that, just as my pussy was all his, her cunt would be my personal property. Well, I have no intention of being a cruel mistress, but while I am in my current state, she will go unsatisfied. But she has been eagerly participating in all of our little games.

That evening, Mr. Signer invited Beatrice to join us in the bedchamber. She was timid as she looked at us, having not been in the presence of both of us together in so long. I held out my hand to her, and she knelt beside the bed, taking the proffered hand and giving it a gentle kiss. I couldn&#8217;t help giggling, and when I looked to my husband, I could see that he was unable to hide his grin.

�You may tell Lady Emily your good news,� my husband said, and I looked at Beatrice in surprise. She smiled.

�A letter came for you, not two days before your return. It was from Rebecca Flannigan�do you know her, my lady?�

It took me a moment to recall, but I did. �Why, yes...� I looked at my husband. �She is my dear old Nanny&#8217;s granddaughter�do you remember her, sir?�

He shook his head. �I&#8217;m afraid not, my dear,� he admitted. �You know I don&#8217;t have much of a mind for names, not as you do.�

�What did the letter say, dear?� I asked Beatrice.

�She and her brother had been cleaning her mother&#8217;s cottage�she had recently passed.�

�My dear Nanny&#8217;s only daughter?� I asked sadly. �Oh, my, the poor dear.�

�Oh, but my lady, your old Nanny passed herself. Just over a decade ago,� Beatrice said. I was more than a little surprised. I had never heard from my old Nanny again after she&#8217;d left us. I had written a letter to her, announcing my marriage to my guardian, and I thought she had disapproved, as I had never gotten a response. As though she read my thoughts, Beatrice continued, �Miss Flannigan found the letter in a box of her grandmother&#8217;s things. It had never been opened, my lady. She saw from the dates that it had arrived not long after her grandmother&#8217;s death, and it must have been put away and forgotten about.�

�How extraordinary,� I said, and I felt a sense of relief. I would sometimes think of my old Nanny over the years, the other person who helped to ensure my happy, safe childhood. It had broken my heart to think that she did not love me anymore, that she was disgusted with my dear kindly Mr. Singer. She had never known about it all�if she had, perhaps she would have been happy for us. We would never know.

�Miss Flannigan wanted to write and send her greetings,� Beatrice said. �She is quite young herself��

�Yes,� I remembered. �She&#8217;d be no more than twenty, is that right?�

Beatrice nodded. �She inquired about a position as a nanny. I�I took it upon myself to reply and to encourage her to come. She has responded, and her letter arrived today.�

�Oh!� I said. I turned to my husband. �May I read it, please, sir?�

Mr. Singer smiled gently. �Why yes, my dear. And here it is, not even opened yet,� he said, taking the envelope from his inner pocket. He went to the desk to use the letter-opener, and brought the letter back to me, still folded. �Here you are, darling.�

As he knelt down to hand it to me, I kissed his lips in gratitude. He returned my kiss, his tongue briefly sliding into my mouth, but he pulled away, teasing me. �Will you read it aloud for us, Lady Emily?� I nodded and began.

Dear Mrs. Gainsley� �Oh, it is for you, dear,� I said. Beatrice only nodded, encouraging me to continue.

I am terribly sorry to hear of the troubles at Wainwright Hall. �How much did you tell her, dear?�

�I informed her of Peter&#8217;s death,� Beatrice admitted. �I�I also told her that you had been ill. I thought that you would not react well to��

I nodded, and hastily read on. I must say, though, I am glad that I am able to offer my assistance at such an opportune time. I am planning to quit the Griffins in August. I looked at Beatrice questioningly.

�She has been the nanny for a wealthy family in London,� Beatrice answered. �The youngest child will be going off to school, and in her first letter, she&#8217;d written that she was seeking a new position.�

�Ah,� I said. I noticed then that the second sheet in the bundle was a letter of recommendation from Lord Griffin himself. I set it aside and read on. I would be very honored to work in the same home that my grandmother worked in for so long. She always spoke of her time at Wainwright Hall, and she loved Lady Emily very much. She saw me once in London when I was a small baby, but of course I do not remember the encounter. Still, I very much look forward to meeting the young lady and her family. I hope that she is well.

I will be eagerly awaiting a response about the position. 

Very best regards,

Rebecca Flannigan

�Why, we certainly must hire her on, sir,� I said, and my husband nodded.

�I agree. When you have some strength, you may write your response,� he said. He took the letter from me, and kissed me again, another cruelly teasing kiss. Oh, but he was only just getting started with me. �I think this letter proves,� he said, as he went to put the letter on the desk, �that we must be very grateful for our blessings. Even in our grief, we have so much to be thankful for.�

I nodded in agreement. �Beatrice,� my husband continued, and she, still kneeling by the bed, looked up at him in eager surprise. He crooked his finger, beckoning her. She stood slowly, hesitantly letting go of my hand as she went to him. As she stood before him, he took her chin in his hand and lifted it, forcing her to look into his eyes. �So,� he said softly, �You really are going to be my wife&#8217;s slave from now on?�

�Yes, Sir Aaron,� she murmured. They were silent for a moment, and my husband, still holding Beatrice&#8217;s chin, turned to me.

�Well, sir,� I said, suppressing a giggle of delight, �What would you like to do to this whore?�

That same wicked glint, the one that I have always loved, shown in my husband&#8217;s eyes. His lips parted slightly, it was not clear if he was snarling or smiling. �I may have her ass?� he asked, knowing my response.

�Of course, sir. Beatrice?�

�Yes, my lady.� My little slave (I am still getting used to the idea!) did not need me to say anything more. She slowly began to remove her dress. As she stripped naked, my husband came to me and straddled my waist. I instinctively pushed my hips toward him, inviting him, but my husband frowned at me and shook his head.

�No, no, my naughty cow. You remember what the doctor said?�

�Oh, please, sir�� I had been denied for too long already�and I must admit, it has been torment over the last few weeks.

�Silence, whore,� he snarled, and I giggled but stopped my protests. Of course, he was right. He took from his pocket a short length of soft rope. �I know that while I am playing with your slave, you will want to touch yourself, perhaps even remove your nightgown.� For I have been clothed in my captivity, so that we are not tempted to play (any more than we already are). �Nasty little cow. I know you need my love, but we must be patient. Am I right?�

�Oh, yes, sir,� I agreed, nodding, and I put my hands behind my back. He carefully tied my wrists together, no tighter than necessary. I being so large, it was a bit of a strain just to keep my shoulders back. My husband smiled, at least allowing me that small amount of pain, for he knew I so loved it.

My husband placed a pillow behind my head to ensure my comfort, and I watched as he approached a naked Beatrice. �Sir,� I said. He turned to me, smiling. �Please, sir, will you take off your clothes while you fuck my slave? Please, sir�your body is so beautiful.�

I couldn&#8217;t have pleased him more. He even flushed with pleasure as he had Beatrice undress him. She knew to run her fingertips slowly over his bare chest and only slightly soft stomach (my dear husband is quite fit for a man of 50); she had been his lover for quite some time, and she undoubtedly knew how to please him. For a moment, I felt a little sad, only a little. But the feeling subsided.

It is difficult to explain how it felt, watching my husband bend Beatrice over the arm of a large chair (which he brought to the foot of the bed, so I could watch more closely) and viciously fuck her ass. It was thrilling, especially to know that they were partly doing it for my sake, as well as their own. I was also frustrated, mostly due to the fact that I could not participate. Needless to say, by the time my husband came all over Beatrice&#8217;s exposed back and ass, and began spanking her with a swift, open palm, I was dripping wet beneath my nightgown, and moaning softly, biting my lip to silence it. 

My husband spanked Beatrice&#8217;s ass and thighs until they were burning red. He looked at me the entire time, one hand slapping Beatrice, the other holding her long dark hair in his fist, and he grinned at me, relishing my torment. 

He finished with her, and left her hanging over the side of the chair (for he had restrained her to the legs of the chair, of course) as he came to me. He smiled calmly. �Thank you, my love,� he said sincerely. He sat with me and touched my face, kissing me softly, his tongue teasing me again.

When he pulled away briefly, I moaned. �Oh, please, sir��

�How can I thank you, my darling? What can I do?�

�Let me come, sir,� I begged. �Oh, please, sir, do let me come, I need to��

�I think it would be good for you to come,� he agreed. �We will have to be gentle, though.�

�Oh, yes, sir,� I agreed. �Yes, but please, do hurry.�

He laughed softly at my impatience, as he always did, and I knew I was flushing all over. He straddled me again, and kissed me, more deeply now, and I only realized then how much I had missed his hot, hungry kisses when we were parted. When he kisses me in such a way, I know he needs me, and loves me more than anyone ever could. He could not resist groping my tits through my nightgown, but he restrained himself and did not bare them for his pleasure, perhaps knowing that if he started playing with them, he might wish to torment them�no sense in further teasing each other.

He did crawl between my legs and pull up the skirt of my nightgown, exposing my bare pussy. �Spread as wide as you can, my lovely cow.� I did so, and raised my hips, so eager for him. He went down on me, plunging his tongue into my depths, and I sighed when he slowly swirled his tongue around my clit. I shuddered. I so loved the feel of his moist tongue inside of me that I held out a bit longer than I might have. He did not scold me, but kept licking and probing, not changing his sensual pace, even as I panted and moaned louder.

After I came, my husband cleaned me, and carefully pulled my nightgown back into place. He wiped his face clean before coming to kiss me again and hold me close. �You&#8217;re so pretty, my little cow,� he said, tears in his eyes. Since we&#8217;ve been reunited, he will sometimes look at me as though he can&#8217;t quite believe I&#8217;m really there, like I am a strange miracle. He gave me that look, and rubbed my belly softly. �I love you, Emily.�

�I love you, too, sir,� I said, and perhaps it is the fact that he was crying a little himself, and that I am a bit overemotional whilst pregnant, but I began to cry. I had cried a lot over the last couple of days, but these were tears of joy, of relief. I realized at that moment that no matter what happens, I will always have my dear husband, my wonderful Mr. Singer, my very best friend. Perhaps I have known this all along, but that feeling came to me then, and we held each other for a minute, until we heard Beatrice let out a timid groan.

I smiled at my husband. �Would you might untying my slave, please, sir?�

�Not at all, darling,� he said, and he went to Beatrice, and did untie her. �All right, Beatrice, playtime is over. Say goodnight to your mistress.�

Beatrice, still naked, her ass and the back of her legs raw and her back covered in drying cum, came and knelt beside me again. She was smiling cheerfully, and she took my hand and kissed it again. �Good night, my lady.�

�Good night, dear.� We kissed briefly, the sort of kiss that sisters might exchange, and she rose. 

�Good night, Sir Aaron,� she said. My husband smiled at her, so kindly that I knew he really had forgiven her, and that our situation was all right.

�Good night, Beatrice, dear,� he said affectionately, and she left the room (and boldly so, wearing no clothing at all!). This made my husband chuckle briefly before he came to me, untying me and laying me on my back. �Time for you to rest, love. You&#8217;ve had quite enough excitement.�

�Sir, may we play like this all the time?� I asked. It certainly is better than not playing at all, even if my participation is minimal.

My husband smiled. �Oh, yes, Emily, we may. If you&#8217;re a good little girl and get your rest.�

I nodded, and I did feel quite tired as my husband extinguished the lights and joined me in bed. He held me, rubbing my belly comfortingly, and I slept much better than I had in years.

We do play with Beatrice almost every evening, and she seems to enjoy it as much as we do. She has been subjected to a number of harsh punishments, my husband doing to her what he wishes he could do to me. Just the other night, he shackled her to the wall (for those same shackles, which my husband had built in years ago, are still here) and viciously whipped her tits, unable to resist yanking himself as he did so, smiling over at me before he grunted and came on her leg. 

I have basically explained the routine of my days in confinement. Meals with my husband, frequent visits from him, and Mina and Beatrice (and of course, the precious baby, a miniature Beatrice for certain) throughout the day, and quite a bit of sleep. I do feel tired much of the time, and am often still weighed down by my grief at losing my poor little Peter. Though I have been comforted with an image of my boy in heaven, united with his long-lost grandparents, and that my little angel is cared for by my mother, who never got to take care of me herself.

Ah, as much as I have lost in my life, my husband is very right. I must be grateful for what I do have. Two healthy little girls, and another child on the way soon. My sweet Beatrice, and many other good friends. And of course, my Mr. Singer, my husband, the man who raised me and loves me so much. I am also very lucky to have my fortune, and to be able to help others. My husband reminds me that in time, the pain of losing Peter will fade into something manageable. �Do you remember how heartbroken you were when you lost your father?� he asked me the other day, after I&#8217;d cried in his arms again. �You were a very strong little girl. You were sad for a while, so sad, inconsolable, but you found a way to move past your pain. You made me strong as well, for I felt very lost after losing my good friend. You helped me, Emily, and I want to help you.�

�You do, sir,� I assured him, taking his hand. He helps me more than he can ever realize!


8 August, 18&#8212;

We&#8217;ve only just arrived in St. Tropez, and my husband has already ordered me to bed! We have come to spend the later part of the summer here. My husband says that it is for the sake of my health, though I know it is more for Beatrice. She still participates eagerly in our playtime, and when she is serving me she is all cheerful smiles, but she does seem terribly melancholy. I hope that our vacation will be good for her.

Over the last few months (and especially after the birth of my sweet little girl, my precious Charlotte, who greatly resembles her little Auntie Alice), I have started to feel more like myself again. My husband does a very good job of keeping me distracted, and he knew that a trip to France would raise my spirits. I was hesitant to leave Wainwright Hall again so soon, after being away for so long, but I have my family with me.

Rebecca, our new nanny, has joined us, having taken leave of the Griffins early in order to accompany us on this trip. She reminds me a bit of my nanny, sweet but a little stern, and she and my dear Tatiana butted heads a little when she first arrived. But I completely trust the children to her care, though I take an active part in their care as I always have. Two little baby girls can be quite a lot of work, but I still care for them myself in the night, with my husband to aid me.

My Mina is an independent girl. I cannot believe that she will be old enough to attend school in another year! I have been determined to make the most of our time together. I very much look forward to riding with her for the first time, and my dear husband has promised that he&#8217;ll allow me to do so upon our return home. I cannot help but regret all the time we have missed together, but I suppose that such feelings are not productive. I must continue to focus on the present and future�so much ugliness needs to be left in the past.

So it is myself, my dear husband, my Beatrice, the three girls, and our new nanny Rebecca here on our vacation. My husband is more outnumbered by women than he&#8217;s ever been, and he certainly loves it. He is already in the process of turning Rebecca on to our little games. She is a pretty thing, very lean and fair skinned, with vibrant red hair. I imagine that my Nanny had red hair before she went grey. Rebecca speaks with a lovely accent, Scottish but softened by her time in London (the Griffins were also Scottish, acclimated). She is good humored much of the time, though she is strict about keeping the young children to a schedule. I cannot yet tell if she would be willing to play our games, but I will certainly be glad if she does.

Since Rebecca joined us, Beatrice has spent little time with the children. I know it hurts her to be around her little daughter, her own namesake. I do not wish to take her child away from her, but she is determined to distance herself, and devotes all of her time to me alone. Though I&#8217;ve received more than my share of attention from my husband since recovering from an easy childbirth.

I know that my husband is expecting me to truly rest now, and if he is to catch me at my writing, he surely will not allow me to go to the beach this afternoon. So I will add the details of our vacation here when I can.


21 August, 18&#8212;

Such strange events that have transpired! And I must say, I feel terribly hurt by what has happened, though my husband comforts me as best he can (as he always does). He claims it is no big loss, that it will be for the best, but I cannot help having my doubts.

Beatrice has left us. Just this evening, she has packed her few belongings and has departed, and I fear that we will never see her again. Needless to say, this vacation has not cured her mood. Indeed, she had only grown more anguished over the past couple of weeks. She has always been prone to such fits of melancholy, but her downward turn since our arrival here has been most alarming.

Allow me to explain. As I&#8217;d previously noted, my husband had been eager to get to know our young Rebecca quite well. He was successful in swaying her interest, but we were left with one little complication. If we were playing with Rebecca, who would care for the young girls?

Mr. Singer felt Beatrice should, and I thought nothing of asking her. She was most courteous in her response. �Of course, my lady,� she said, smiling a little. Ah, but something was not right, and I felt a little uneasy about making the request. 

But our first evening with young Rebecca was quite fun. She told us, as we lounged on the patio just up from the sea and enjoyed cool drinks, that she&#8217;d carried on an affair with both the Lord and Lady Griffin. �Only, we did not all three play together,� she admitted. �I saw them each separately�and they never did know about each other&#8217;s affairs!�

A strangely amusing but sad story! �Why did you not ever think to bring the two together?� I could not help asking. My husband gave me a briefly stern look, but he would not scold me for my meddlesome ways, never again. 

�Oh, I did think of it, my lady,� Rebecca admitted. �You must understand, my lady, these two were not suited for one another. Quite a pity, they had such lovely children and such possibilities. But they were not meant to be together.�

�It is for you to determine this?� my husband asked, to my surprise. Rebecca&#8217;s pale face flushed pleasantly, but she was not afraid of being challenged.

�It was not my place to question their sleeping in separate bedchambers, sir,� she said, a bit defensively. �And they were happy with their arrangement.�

�Fair enough,� my husband said with a wave of his hand. He threw a wink to me, and I knew that we would never end up in separate bedchambers, that we could never be happy that way. �So you enjoy your fun, Rebecca?�

�Who doesn&#8217;t, sir?� she asked, polishing off her drink. Having left the children to Beatrice&#8217;s capable care, she was enjoying a night of freedom. My husband liked her immediately, and I respected her for her intelligence. She revealed (after a couple more strong drinks) that she wanted to further her education, and of course, I have started thinking of a way to help her along with her plans. I certainly do enjoy helping others.

But a sodden Rebecca helped us that evening. She was quite a merry drunk, red-faced to match her hair, and was quite enthusiastic in our playing. She was disappointed at my husband&#8217;s rules, for she seems to pride herself as being as much of an expert lover as I, and was eager to prove herself to me. But she was quite pleased (and I was very surprised) when my husband suggested that she give me a paddling.

�My dear Emily was not punished much as a child,� my husband said teasingly as he stroked my rock-hard nipples, squeezing my tits gently, enjoying their swelling. �And she does not believe in the corporal punishment of children, but my naughty girl needs some discipline now. Come, little Nanny,� he coaxed her, �Give my little cow what she needs.�

I&#8217;d kept on some of my pregnancy weight, at least for the time being, and I knew that he wanted me to keep it on. He ran his hands over my soft stomach and thighs, teasing me, standing before me and rubbing his hard cock against my opening, before he spun me around and bent me over the foot of the bed. He tied my wrists together, my arms over my head. He instructed Rebecca to retrieve the spreader-bar from the wardrobe, and proceeded to shackle my ankles, spreading my legs wide apart.

Goodness! Such a thrilling punishment�I had not had such fun with my husband in far too long! And Rebecca, well experienced from the punishments she&#8217;d administered to Lord Griffin, used the paddle with holes that I&#8217;d brought back with me from San Francisco. I quite enjoyed my bare-ass paddling, and when Rebecca paused to shove two fingers into my gaping asshole, I was reminded of Lydia, of the times when we had real fun together, before everything became so complicated.

My husband replaced Rebecca when my ass was burning, and he shoved his cock into my prepared asshole. He fucked me hard as I moaned, grabbing my hair tightly in his fist and whispering to me. �Nasty little whore, you love getting a punishment from Nanny, don&#8217;t you?�

�Oh, God, yes, sir!� I cried. His balls slapped against my ass as he fucked me harder, his grip on my hair tightening, and I sobbed. �Oh, God, sir, please��

�You&#8217;re a naughty girl, Emily, so naughty,� my husband snarled, and I moaned, wanting him to touch me, finger me, please me just a little bit. �Nanny, does my little bitch cow deserve pleasure?�

�Not yet,� Rebecca responded cruelly, and I knew what she would have me do. My chest, pinned to the mattress, heaved, and my ass clinched. My husband grunted, and slapped my ass in gratitude as he came inside of me. I groaned, grinding myself against the edge of the bed, my clit burning as much as my punished ass.

My husband seized me by the hair and lifted me to my feet. He removed the spreader-bar, then positioned my arms behind my back. He remained behind me, snarling teasingly in my ear as he gently put a hand around my throat. �My little cow loves pussy, doesn&#8217;t she?� 

�Oh, yes, sir,� I nodded. His hand tightened, ever so slightly. I shuddered and stood up on my toes. Oh, God, I love it when my master is just a little bit cruel, just a little bit mean to me as he teases me. 

�Look at your little Nanny, Emily. Isn&#8217;t she pretty?� Rebecca, her pale naked skin shining in the moonlight that came in through the open window, gave me a seductive look. She pushed her vibrant red hair, blanched in the moonlight, behind her pale shoulders, and spread her legs wide.

�Yes, sir. She&#8217;s beautiful.� She smiled at that, shyly, and beckoned to me. My husband helped me to my knees, and watched me crawl to her. She did not say anything as I, without hesitation, shoved my head up between her legs and shoved my tongue into her pussy. 

Rebecca moaned, grabbing me by the hair (my head was throbbing a little after that particularly rough playtime!) as I licked her quickly, sucking on her when I located her oversized clit. As I lapped at her teasingly, I noted the tangled red hair around her pussy. But she did not leave me much time to examine her by sight as she grinded herself onto my face while shoving my head further against her thrusting crotch. My tongue explored her, circling about along the lining of her pussy walls, and she cried out loud, unable to resist me as I nibbled on her clit, and I was rewarded with a face full of sticky cream.

I licked and cleaned her, dirty as I was, and she returned the favor by toweling off my face and kissing me softly. Her lips are thin and pale, but so soft and warm. She stood and turned to my husband. �I think she&#8217;s deserved her pleasure, sir.�

�As do I, Nanny,� my husband agreed, and approached me. I smiled up at him, and he looked down at me, his look loving and tender before that same wicked glint appeared again. He put a hand on my arm. �Stand up, my child,� he instructed me, and I giggled, standing with his gentle help. He put a hand between my legs and stroked me as he whispered, �You are my naughty one, Emily, but you&#8217;re so good, darling. So, so good.�

�Just for you, sir,� I whispered, and this pleased him greatly. He dismissed Rebecca for the evening before throwing me to the bed and having me, again and again, for the remainder of the night. 

My husband enjoys watching Rebecca punish me, just as I know he enjoyed watching Lydia do so, back before everything changed. And so, over the last couple of weeks, Rebecca has joined us regularly, and Beatrice has been left neglected. I felt some small guilt about it, but she continued to smile and obey my requests, and I deluded myself into believing that all was well.

Then, last night, the truth was revealed. My husband and I had spent a pleasant evening alone together. We were walking along the beach at twilight, enjoying the quiet. We have kept mostly to our private portion of beach and sea since we&#8217;ve been here, and have not socialized with other vacationers, though they are around. I am not lonely for the company; obviously, I&#8217;ve not been able to spend adequate time with everyone in my own party.

But none of this was on my mind as my husband held me by the arm and we walked together in bare feet, our shoes left by the door to our villa. The sand was pleasantly cool and we walked close to the gently lapping waters, and talked pleasantly together, strolling along. We talked of our friends, the Sheltons, who were so happy to be reunited. I knew that Tatiana was getting on well with young Alice, and getting along very well with my dear Joseph. I have missed them while we&#8217;ve been on vacation, but knowing that they are safe and well, at least, makes me feel better.

We have not all yet played together, but my husband promises that we will do so upon our arrival home. Of course, with Beatrice gone, I don&#8217;t know if Tatiana will be able to forgive us. �She knows her sister&#8217;s ways,� my husband assures me. �She knows that Beatrice has been unhappy for quite some time�she won&#8217;t begrudge us for it.� But I have my doubts. I know how much Tatiana loves her sister, and I would hate for her to blame us for all that has happened�

But on the beach that evening, my husband and I were perfectly carefree. After we walked along for a while, we were quite away from any other houses. Nobody was around for miles, it seemed. My husband stopped and turned to me, touching my face softly. �You are happy again, my Emily?�

�Oh, sir, I�� I had to be perfectly honest with him, as I know I always should be. �I am still sad about our son, to be sure, but�yes, I am happy. So happy.� And I smiled, and my husband did not frown with worry anymore. He kissed me deeply, hungrily, but only briefly.

�The water is quite warm this evening,� he observed, and I knew what he meant to do. He helped me to remove my white dress, and I helped him out of his shirt and trousers, and he carried me naked into the water as I laughed. The waves were not very high that evening, so we went out further than we might have dared. My toes still brushed the sandy bottom as I expertly treaded, and Mr. Singer stood easily, a protective hand near my waist as he bent his knees to submerge himself to my level.

He took me by the waist, and I wrapped my legs around him securely as we kissed again, laughing as the water lapped around our faces. My strong husband stood a little higher, holding me up while kissing me with the same intensity. I could feel him going hard against me, and I was thrilled at the thought of finally fucking my husband in the sea (we had not had an opportunity yet!). 

We drifted to shore, and my husband positioned me beneath him, just above where the water was breaking, so that we were frequently soaked while we fucked. As thrilling as it was, the sand was a bit uncomfortable, though not necessarily unpleasant (cleaning up afterward proved quite difficult, though!). When my husband finished with me, we walked naked back to the villa (not even bothering to retrieve our clothing!) and went to our room to clean up.

We were diverted by the sound of arguing voices coming from the nursery. Alarmed and irritated, my husband took me quickly to our room to dress (for how could we confront them in our current state?), and he went to squash the argument while I tidied up. I only washed my hands and ran a comb through my hair before covering it with a lace veil, and I joined my husband to find out what the trouble was.

In the nursery, I found my husband and Rebecca each comforting a baby; Beatrice stood alone by the window, looking out at the sea. No one was speaking; the only sound was the squalling of the awoken baby girls. I took little Beatrice from my husband and held her close as I asked, �What is going on here?�

�My lady,� Rebecca began defensively. �Your friend here��

�Now, calmly,� my husband said, in his masterful way. He looked troubled, though.

�We were caring for the girls,� Rebecca continued, not much calmer than before. �She began to complain about our�arrangement.�

Beatrice turned to me with narrowed eyes. �I&#8217;m sorry, my lady, for not being forthright, but I have been dissatisfied��

�Ingrate,� my husband spat, to my surprise. �Your mistress asks so little of you��

�I thought it was understood,� Beatrice plowed on, her hands visibly trembling. �I thought it was understood that I was to be her�plaything. And this girl is the nanny,� she said, gesturing to Rebecca spitefully. �Not the only way around!�

�Oh, but Beatrice��

�No, my lady,� Beatrice cut me off. She burst into tears. �You know it pains me to be around this baby, and yet you insist��

I clutched dear little Beatrice more tightly. I did not know what to say. My husband angrily approached Beatrice, and she pressed herself against the window fearfully. �I told you, Beatrice, that you were welcome to go at any time. You are unhappy? Then go! And stop plaguing us!�

I gasped as Beatrice hurried from the room. My husband gave me an apologetic look. �I&#8217;m sorry, Emily.�

�Sir, you must not speak to her in such a way.�

�I only say what is true,� he said, his face red with his sudden fury. He reached out to me. �Come, give me the child. Rebecca and I will finish putting them to bed. Leave Beatrice alone, Emily, and take a bath. We&#8217;ll sort this whole mess out.�

I fought the temptation to go to Beatrice&#8217;s private room and obeyed my husband. I took a warm bath, and scrubbed away the sand and sea from my hair and skin, but I could not relax. By the time I&#8217;d put on my lotion and combed out my hair more carefully, my husband still had not returned to our room. I waited for him, uncertain of what else to do, and he came to me finally, as I sat restless and naked on our bed.

�Rebecca has told me that Beatrice has been quite hostile towards her,� he said quietly. �She had not wished to say anything before, as she was uncertain of the nature of your�relationship. But Beatrice was being particularly insufferable this evening, and I&#8217;m glad that Rebecca let her have it��

�And so did you,� I added, not quite able to forgive his harsh words. He smiled sheepishly and came to me. I did not resist his touch as he took my face and kissed me.

�You know I am quick to anger at times,� my husband said. �And you understand that my feelings toward Beatrice are�complicated.�

�Yes, sir,� I acknowledged. �Do you really want her to go?�

He sighed. �Things can never be as they once were, Emily. I do still love Beatrice. I want her to be happy, and�she is not happy with us. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything we can do to make her perfectly happy, try as we have for so long.� It was true. Even in our early days together, she had always been dissatisfied, in some way. I sighed deeply.

�What is the fair thing to do, sir?�

�You are the one to decide,� he said, the answer I did not want to hear. But he added, �I will help you, and I will support anything that you decide. Shall we go speak with her and try to work things out?�

I nodded, and he helped me to dress and took me to Beatrice&#8217;s room. My husband knocked, but still entered without waiting for her to respond. She sat morose on the balcony, for her little room had quite a dazzling view. She turned to us sadly, and came back into the dark room to speak with us. Looking only at me, she said, �I&#8217;m so sorry, my lady. I do not know what came over me. Please, do forgive my behavior.�

�Of course, dear,� I said uneasily as she knelt before me. As much fun as it had been to have my own little slave at first, I find that the role of mistress does not suit me. Perhaps if Beatrice had truly been happy and satisfied under my care, I would have taken to it. But it was not right. �Please, get up, dear, we must talk.�

She was evasive, but after some time (during which my husband sat in silence and merely observed, never interjecting, and I appreciated that more than I could ever hope to express), the truth came forth. Yes, she loved me dearly and sought my forgiveness and love. No, she was not happy in our situation, though she did try, she wanted us to know. After finally getting to the heart of the matter, I said, �Beatrice, I know what you want more than anything in the world. But you know that it is impossible, don&#8217;t you?�

I was referring, of course, to her love for my husband, how she wanted to be his only one. She nodded sadly, sneaking a short look at him, the only time she&#8217;d dared to look at him since we&#8217;d all sat down together. He wore a neutral expression on his face, and she crumpled to see it, and seemed to realize then, truly, how impossible her dream really was. �My dear,� I went on, �I&#8217;ve always loved you, and I&#8217;ve always wanted to make you happy. All things aside, what do you think would make you happy? What do you want?�

�I�� Beatrice was hesitant. But she finally said the truth, the harsh truth, for the very first time. �I want to begin my life again�and I never want to see you again, my lady.� She sobbed at these words, mortified at even thinking them. �Oh, do forgive me, my lady, I know how it must sound�but I can never measure up to you, don&#8217;t you see? And I want a man to adore me as your husband adores you, I want that, and I never will around you because�� 

That was the end of the discussion, for all practical purposes. I tried to offer Beatrice money; she refused to take a cent. She said that she intended to be gone the next day (and she has kept her word, having departed only hours ago). �It will be better this way,� she said tearfully, the same words that my husband would echo later. I did not, and still cannot, believe that it is so.

But what is to be done? Beatrice made her choice, I suppose, and I wish her all the best. I hope that it is not the last that I see of her. We have such a history together. A rocky, unpleasant one, to be sure, but I love her as much as I could love any sister. I knew that this whole slavery business was a mistake, but I think I agreed to it because I was desperate to hold on to her.

My husband, it seems, knew all along that her time with us would not last. �Why do you think I named the child for her natural mother?� he asked later. �We&#8217;ll at least have something to remember her by.� He seems to believe that she will never return, and perhaps he feels that it is for the best as well, that she disappears and never comes back. I cannot believe him to be so heartless, but then again, we have had such terrible times�

My head is spinning with it all again, and my husband will be coming to me soon, I am sure. Why can we not find our footing again? Why must things become complicated again, just when they&#8217;d started to be so good? I had thought that I was happy again, that I could be happy as before, but now�perhaps we are cursed. But what have we done, what have I done, to deserve all of this?




























Mr. Singer

I had deceived my Emily. I felt guilty for it, long after the deed was done, but I never stopped believing that the ends justified the means. For though she grieved the loss of her friend, I did know that Beatrice&#8217;s leaving was for the best. I had made it happen.

While Emily bathed in our suite, I had left the baby girls to Rebecca&#8217;s care and had gone to Beatrice alone. I had found her sobbing on her bed. The sight of her crying annoyed me to no end, but I merely sat beside her and waited for her to speak. She had finally turned to me slowly, sniffling pathetically. �You don&#8217;t love me, Aaron?� she asked.

I sighed impatiently and stood. �What do you wish for me to say, Beatrice? Yes, I love you, I love you very much. Damn you.�

A hint of a smile played on her lips, even as they trembled. �But you will never love me as you love Lady Emily?�

�Of course not,� I said, and her little smile disappeared. �You are a foolish girl, Beatrice. I&#8217;ve never said or done anything to make you believe differently. You&#8217;ve known the truth all along.�

She covered her face with her hands. �I&#8217;m so ashamed, Aaron! I&#8217;m humiliated!� She sobbed more, and I did pity her then. Her reputation was in ruins, and she had resorted to living the life of a slave, in a desperate bid to stay with me. Even after all she&#8217;d done, I pitied her.

I proposed that she should go. �I wanted to keep you with us so that you would know your child,� I said. �You do not wish to know her, anyway.�

�I don&#8217;t deserve her.�

I waved my hand impatiently. There was no talking her out of her twisted logic. �I feel that it is no use, Beatrice. Some part of you refuses to allow you to be happy with us. And to be perfectly frank, I do not want your poor spirits to affect my wife. Her happiness, her well-being, has always been my top priority. She will be upset to lose you, certainly, but in time, it will be the best thing, for her sake. And for yours as well.� I did not add that it would be the best for me; while I had not quite forgiven her betrayal (and I never would), I had had her for so long. And I never did stop loving her, or wondering about her when she had left us.

She cried, but did not beg me to allow her to stay. She accepted my offer of money. �I will bring my wife in to speak with you on the subject,� I said. �This conversation that we&#8217;ve just had is between us�you will tell her that you want to go, that it was your decision, do you understand?�

Beatrice readily agreed. I felt that Emily would be angry with me if she knew the truth, and for a very long time, I kept it from her. Beatrice played her part well, and when I took Emily back to our bedroom for the night, I knew she had believed it all. I didn&#8217;t want any more lies or deception between us, but�this was for the best. I knew it.

After Beatrice departed, Emily did not enjoy her time in St. Tropez as much. So we cut our vacation short and went home again. On the train from London, I took her hand as she stared vacantly out of the window. I whispered in her ear, �I did not show you the message that Tatiana left for us in London. She is quite eager to have us in her home upon our return.�

Emily turned to me in surprise. �She knows what has happened, sir?�

I nodded. �I wrote and told her everything. Rest assured, darling, our friend doesn&#8217;t lay any of the blame on you.�

She smiled a little at that. I knew that this would not relieve all of her troubles, but knowing that her oldest, dearest friend (besides myself) was still on her side helped her mood, and she was quite cheerful by the time we arrived at our station. Her mood was further lifted when, upon alighting from the train, we were approached by some old acquaintances. Emily had not spoken with any of our neighbors since her return from her wild adventures, and I knew that she was worried that her reputation was in ruins as well.

But these neighbors, conservative as they were, greeted her warmly. �It&#8217;s so good to see you again, Lady Emily,� Mrs. Winthrop, a relation of the Gainsleys, said, most sincerely. �You look very well. And your girls are quite adorable.�

Just like that, my dear little Lady Emily was back in the center of society in our little corner of the world. She and I would marvel at it in private, how quickly she had been embraced again. �Well, my dear, consider: you&#8217;re very wealthy, and titled, and you&#8217;re just as pretty as you ever were.�

Though she flushed, she said in disappointment, �That&#8217;s true.�

�But you&#8217;re also a lovely person,� I added sincerely, kissing her softly. �You&#8217;re wonderful and kindly�you know how your charity work has continued, even in your absence. Why shouldn&#8217;t everyone adore you? You&#8217;ve done nothing to earn their derision.�

Emily took comfort in my reasoning, and she enjoyed attending parties by my side that season. I was tempted to be selective about which invitations to accept, but being around others distracted her. It also gave her the chance to become reacquainted with Alfonso Beaumont, and surprisingly, widowed Mary Steepleton, who had taken her big, black driver on as her lover after her husband&#8217;s passing. We had some times with them, and I began to feel like the wild social life that I&#8217;d briefly dreamed of in Barcelona would still be a reality.

Certainly there were rumors about Emily, about her mysterious time away and about the two baby girls, but over time, everyone pretended that the babies were twins, not noting that their birthdays were several months apart, and the other rumors simply faded away. Things really can go back to the way they were, I thought to myself one cool evening, about a month before Christmas (our first Christmas as a family again). But things had changed, to be sure, and some of the changes were much easier to cope with than others.


Emily recovered quickly from giving birth to pretty little Charlotte, and was as hearty and energetic as ever as winter approached. One afternoon, after the first snow of the season had prevented me from going to the office, my wife and I were alone in my study. The fire roared, filling the otherwise dark room with a warm glow as my naked wife straddled me. Having kept on some of her extra pregnancy weight, her little body had tightened considerably, but she&#8217;d still left me plenty extra to grab around her waist.

I was naked as well; we&#8217;d been lounging about that afternoon, enjoying one last day with Rebecca before she left us for an extended holiday. As much fun as she&#8217;d been having with us (though she&#8217;d been often neglected since we&#8217;d &#8216;lost&#8217; Beatrice), she desired to see her family in the Highlands, and Emily, of course, did not refuse her. The little babies would be our sole responsibility until after the new year, and such a handful those little darlings were. We would not have the chance to play all day like that while our nanny was away.

That afternoon, we took our time in our playing. I kissed Emily&#8217;s soft neck slowly, caressing the back of her ear with my tongue, groping her tits as she shuddered. I felt her getting wet against me, soaking wet, and she let out a tiny moan, �Oh, please, sir��

I nibbled on her earlobe. �Patience, whore. Tell me, darling, would you like to host a little Christmas party for our friends?�

My wife eyed me curiously. �A Christmas party, sir?� We had not hosted any parties since her arrival home. The last party at Wainwright Hall had been for the Sheltons&#8217; wedding. 

�Nothing too extravagant,� I said. I smiled at her teasingly. �Just for our very close friends.�

Emily giggled and knew exactly what I intended. Though I had been tempted to guard her close after all of our time apart, we could not resist playing our games with others. And we had so many friends now to play with. �Who will we invite, sir?�

�You know,� I said. �Our dear friends the Sheltons��

�And Joseph as well, sir?� She still enjoyed spending time with her lover, and he (along with his brother and sister-in-law) was a frequent guest in our home.

�Of course, my silly thing,� I said affectionately. �And Mrs. Steepleton, and our dear Alfonso��

�Oh, sir, we have not introduced Joseph and Alfonso yet,� Emily observed, and I grinned, knowing what my nasty little wife had planned for her friends.

�No, we have not,� I agreed, and added, �Mrs. Steepleton told me that her husband&#8217;s niece will be coming to visit her for the holidays. You must remember our old friends the Santoses, from Barcelona?�

Emily blushed then; any mention of that disastrous trip to Spain distressed her. I forced a smile and said, �Sra. Santos speaks most fondly of you, my dear, and is very eager to be reacquainted.� Emily said nothing to this. �Well, my dear? Would you like to have a little party? It is up to you��

�Yes, sir,� she finally said. She wrapped her arms around my neck and hugged me in gratitude. �I think it will be a lot of fun. Thank you, sir.�

�It will be fun, my dear,� I agreed, squeezing her. �It will be a very happy Christmas indeed.�

We had our own little pre-holiday fun that afternoon, and I thoroughly enjoyed my wife&#8217;s tits (even with two babies to feed, she still had plenty of milk left over for me) as she ground her pussy against me, in a slow rhythm to accompany my gentle suckling. I wanted to properly enjoy her milk, the sweet nectar that sustained the girls and sustained me, and I took my time. As much as she enjoyed allowing me to drink from her, I knew it was tormenting (and part of the reason why I was not hasty).

When I detached myself from her sweet, hard nipple and kissed her softly, she pulled away and moaned in my ear, �Oh, sir, please let me��

�Hush, now,� I teased, and to further her delicious impatience I had her go to her knees to please me first. She smiled up at me, though she trembled in her longing, for I knew she longed to please me even more. My dearest Emily, the most unselfish lover I&#8217;d ever had, my precious little slave. 

She did not rush to please me, but took her time, running her tongue slowly along the underside of my shaft as I moaned. I held the back of her head, but allowed her to maneuver freely, worshiping me slowly, planting sweet kisses along my sensitive hard member before taking me fully down her throat. My hand tightened in her hair, but I still did not rush her as I panted, my toes curling as she slowly drew her mouth away, never quite removing me, slowly swirling the tip of my cock with her tongue before it went plunging down her throat again.

After several minutes, I could stand no more of her torment. �You teasing little whore, Emily�� I moaned as she took me fully again, and gave my sensitive testicles (which she&#8217;d been stroking slowly, in rhythm with her sucking) a gentle squeeze, and�well, my wife has never failed to please me, and I daresay that I had never filled her stomach with so much cum in her life. Now she&#8217;d had her nectar, her sustenance.

I could not stop myself from grinning at her as she cleaned me. Having done her duty, she looked up at me eagerly, waiting for me to give my orders. How could I resist touching her face softly, my pretty little Emily? Still as fresh and sweet at 30 as she&#8217;d been at 18. I told her this, and she flushed prettily, giggling softly, though not quite believing me.

�And I,� I joked, �I grow older by the minute.�

�You do, sir,� she agreed, rising to her knees. I bent and allowed her to kiss me. She wrapped her arms around my neck. �Older and more handsome, my dear sir.�

�You are desperate to come, aren&#8217;t you, my little slut?� I teased, and she laughed gaily, and I knew she spoke the truth, at least in her view. I was always handsome, and getting older was not easy for me, for I could see my looks deteriorating�and with them, I was afraid, my charm. My dear little wife, always adoring me, kept up my confidence, so convinced was she that I became a better man in every way, all the time. I certainly tried to, for her sake.

I pulled her to my lap and finally allowed her to ride me (for how could I not grow hard again, with my darling Emily, huge lactating tits and all, on her knees before me?), even holding out so she could come several times before I filled her. I buried my face in her neck, tasting her sweat, teasing her sensitive places again. Still holding me inside of her, she shuddered, very sensitive from her rapid orgasms. I knew she was exhausted, and normally I would not push her limits so, but I felt as energetic that afternoon as I had when we were first wed, and Emily was very quickly riding me again, and coming over and over until it was sweet torment for her.

Lying with her on the floor in front of the fire, holding her naked, exhausted body close as we enjoyed the afterglow, was the sweetest part of all. As we both faced the fire, I was surprised when Emily turned to me with tears in her eyes. But she was smiling. �Oh, sir,� she said, �I really am so glad to be home. You do make me so happy, and I�thank you, sir.� 

I wiped her tears, almost frowning, not certain how to express my thoughts. What could I say? How could I tell her what I hadn&#8217;t already said, that she was my everything and that I could never do for her all the good she did for me, it was quite impossible, and I could not understand how she could love me and need me so�

But those troubling thoughts, which had bothered me especially in our extended absence, flinted away. I kissed her and said, �You&#8217;re welcome.�

Emily was quite busy with the three girls after Rebecca left us for the holidays, and I was kept away from home in the office, working with Shelton to contact our clients before taking a break for a few weeks. We had all come up with a plan for our holiday. A week prior to Christmas, we would send Mina and Alice (who was home from the boarding school that Emily had selected and paid for) out to stay with the other Shelton children. All of them were older than Mina, but my wife figured that she would enjoy herself more in their company than with the little babies and the adults.

�Mina is a good helper with the babies, to be sure, but she is restless,� my wife observed as we changed the nappies of the little girls one evening. �And the rest of us would join them after the party, right before Christmas�do you think that plan is viable, sir?�

My wife&#8217;s planning and reasoning all made perfect sense, but I was surprised that she would propose to send our daughter away, even for so short a time. She smiled at this and answered, �She will be going away to school in only a few months, sir. Don&#8217;t you think it is important that we encourage her independence?�

Independence. Throughout Emily&#8217;s childhood, I, as her guardian, had done my best to encourage certain values in her. Patience, sympathy, respect, kindliness. Certainly I had neglected to foster her independence, to a large extent. I wondered if I had done so, if I had allowed her to go off to school and to have her own life outside of Wainwright Hall, away from me, would we have ever become lovers? Would we have married? It is not a topic that Emily and I had ever discussed, for I believe we both felt that the outcome of such a discussion would not be pleasant. I suppose you might say, it is what it is. Emily never went off to school; she became my wife. There isn&#8217;t really any way to prove or disprove the cause-and-effect relationship there.

It pleased me that Emily saw such a different future for our daughter, for reasons that I cannot readily explain. Perhaps she was proving my theory, that though Mina was such a different person from her, she would appreciate and love her regardless�or rather, because of it. Mina craved independence, and Emily was willing to allow it to her. Mina saw this in her mother, how her mother loved and appreciated her, and she came to love her more than she ever loved me. That seemed right; I wanted it to be so.

On the night of our little party, the only children in the house would be our little girls, and young Joseph. Our dear Tatiana would provide the services of her nanny, so all was settled on that front. Our other servants were staying on until the day after the party, so all would be prepared for an impressive feast, after which they would clean up and be off to their own quarters before the real &#8216;party&#8217; began. My Emily was excited for our little orgy, and she saw to all of the details the same way she would have for her annual spring party for the neighbors. She made sure that there were enough chairs, restraints, pillows, flogging devices, toys, and plenty of firewood and alcohol in the parlor. She fretted over what she would wear (for she would be clothed for the first part of the evening, at least), and eagerly sought my approval for a very low-cut dark-blue gown. 

�I was going to wait until Christmas,� I said, going to my wardrobe, �But I have just the thing to go with that gown.� I removed a gift box (one of several filled with jewelry, all for my darling for Christmas) and presented her with a new collar. I had not collared her since we&#8217;d reunited, but she was eager to have me put the dark blue collar around her neck. The lining was very soft and the texture was very fine and smooth. The thin silver buckle sat at her throat like a fine choker. I tenderly stroked and kissed the soft white skin around the collar, and my wife sighed.

�Oh, sir, this collar is so lovely,� she said. �Will you allow me to wear it for you all the time?�

My dear little wife always knew the right things to say to please me. She thanked me properly, wearing that gown and her new collar, and she was very careful as she sucked and cleaned me. Of course, on the night of the party, she would take off the dress while we all played together.

On the afternoon of the party, Tatiana, her baby, and the nanny arrived early to set the children up in the nursery and to talk with my wife. I left the ladies to their gossiping and saw to the dinner preparations before preparing to take a bath. Just as I was thinking that it would be nice to have my wife there to bathe with me, she appeared in our bathroom, wearing nothing but her new collar, which she slipped off before climbing into the warm water with me and allowing me to bathe her.

�Tatiana is in her old room in the east wing, preparing for the party,� my wife reported as I washed her small white neck. She giggled. �She does have some naughty surprises for her brother-in-law this evening.�

�I&#8217;m sure that she does,� I said with a laugh. I had recently spoken with Shelton and his brother about their activities at home. Wild Tatiana, who had once declared that she would never be fully tame, had enjoyed some wild times with Joseph. I had heard tell of a strap-on phallus, which Tatiana would sport while fucking Joseph in his ass. Fascinating. I hoped that she had brought it along for the party (and I was not disappointed).

My wife and I did not play during our bath, wanting to save our energy for our friends that evening. I did tease her a little, tickling her sensitive clit while I bathed her huge tits. They were bigger than they&#8217;d ever been, and I imagined that her efficient little body, knowing how many hungry mouths depended on her milk, was producing more than ever to meet the demand. My obsession with my wife has fueled in me an interest in the female body, all of its little complications and nuances, how everything works (and for the most part, knowledge has been power, as knowing all about my wife allowed me to please her thoroughly�or to torment her lovingly). I never grew bored with my little wife�on the contrary, I marveled to learn new things about her, about her body and her mind and her heart, every since day.

I learned a little about her that night during our party. After dressing each other, I left my wife alone to finish preparing herself. �I will meet Tatiana and will see to our guests,� I said. �Take your time; see to the girls, if you must.� Emily already planned on taking a break after supper and feeding the little girls (Tatiana joining her to feed young Joseph), but I knew she would want to see to their care before allowing herself to be a carefree little hostess.

By the time Emily joined us in the parlor, the Shelton brothers had arrived, and drinks were already flowing. My partner, enamored with my wife since he&#8217;d first met her (and who could blame him?), quickly stood and offered her a drink, and she responded that she would retrieve it herself as she affectionately touched his cheek. I was correct when I&#8217;d predicted that they&#8217;d enjoy being playmates, and I had enjoyed watching her please him (especially since it meant returning the favor, after using his wife so often). 

The maid announced Alfonso, Mrs. Steepleton, and Sra. Santos, and my wife hurried to greet them all as they came through the door. Her uneasiness about seeing Sra. Santos again seemed to have completely vanished as she greeted her friend with a kiss on the cheek. �It is so wonderful to see you again,� she said sincerely. 

�My husband and I were so relieved to hear that you were well!� Sra. Santos replied. I remembered, with some mortification, how the police had questioned the Santoses about the whole ordeal in Barcelona. But they had been most gracious and sympathetic, and had seen to me several times during my stay there.

�And where is your husband?� Emily asked, leading Sra. Santos to a seat near me (I stood to greet her warmly).

�He had to stay on at home. Business,� she said with a roll of her eyes, knowing that it was untrue, and caring very little. They had not changed, it seemed. 

Emily set about introducing Alfonso and Mrs. Steepleton, as well as Sra. Santos, to Joseph. The shy young man had not attended any parties since he&#8217;d arrived, only staying in his brother&#8217;s home or coming to Wainwright Hall, or going to his siblings&#8217; home outside of London (where we would be spending our holiday). His bashfulness surprised me, as he&#8217;d had many �friends� and acquaintances in San Francisco, but he explained that he&#8217;d acquired these out of necessity. He was really quite introverted.

Well, my Emily was determined to help him break out of his shell, and she eagerly introduced him to Alfonso. The big black driver, who had known my wife&#8217;s ass quite well many times, had only a few traces of grey in his short-cropped black hair to betray his age; otherwise, he had the face and build of a very young man. He was now dressed in a fine suit, purchased by his wealthy lover, and seemed perfectly at his ease in our crowd (though Mrs. Steepleton would not dream of bringing him as her escort to any of the more conservative social events). 

As big as Alfonso was, Joseph had a build to rival his. As they got to talking, my wife caught my eye, and I knew what she wanted to happen. I found myself eager to see the two men have at each other�but our real fun would wait until after dinner.

The drinks poured freely, and Emily and Tatiana served as the little bartenders. My wife and I had agreed that we would have fun that night, let loose, though the two nursing mothers did nothing more than drink a bit of wine (with pregnant Tatiana hardly partaking) as the rest of us became quite drunk before dinner. Still, Emily&#8217;s face bore a healthy flush as I escorted her into the dining hall. One gentleman for each lady, though we certainly wouldn&#8217;t be pairing off in quite that way during our after dinner playtime.

Already a bit tipsy, I kissed my wife&#8217;s neck softly before helping her into her seat. �Might we skip our dinner and go straight to dessert, hostess?� I whispered teasingly.

�Oh, do sit down, sir,� she scolded me with a smile, and I sat at the head of the table, with my wife by my side, as our friends took their seats. We ate to our fill, the food sobering us up a little (though we continued to drink throughout the meal). At one point, I unsteadily stood and proposed a toast to my wife.

�I feel comfortable telling you all here, that this little woman is the best thing that I have in my life. She has brought us all here together this evening, to celebrate the love and friendship that she provides. I am very grateful to have her home.� I looked down at her, and she up at me, with tears in her eyes as she touched the fine buckle of her collar. �To Lady Emily.�

�To Lady Emily!� the guests declared heartily, and she flushed as they drank to her health. 

After dinner, we decided to forego dessert until the games had started. Emily and Tatiana departed upstairs to nurse, and though I would have wished to join them, I accompanied the rest of the party back to the parlor, for cigars and more drinks, and to begin some of our playing.

Emily and Tatiana laughed heartily upon their return to the parlor to already see Alfonso and Joseph having their fun. The rest of us watched as Joseph went down on Alfonso, sucking his huge cock expertly, and I could tell that Alfonso was impressed with his skills as I&#8217;d been. When my wife sat beside me, I prompted her to begin removing her dress. She stood, and said to Sra. Santos, �I was very proud of myself, that I was able to fit back into the corset that you got for me in Barcelona.� And so she was wearing that same red corset, which I had not seen since that horrible night (for she had disappeared while still wearing it!).

Emily flushed as she saw the look of appreciation on Sra. Santos&#8217;s face, and the look of shock on mine. She wore this, and her collar, as she coaxed the red-haired lady into allowing her to lick her pussy for my enjoyment. Tatiana, always wanting to be the center of attention in such situations, offered to suck my cock, and so I received my pleasure as well. Undoubtedly, Mrs. Steepleton and Shelton began playing together; all were active throughout the course of the party games.

Our activities were not limited to the parlor that night. Drunk, laughing, high on orgasms, we went through the house, playing in different rooms. I took Alfonso and Shelton to see the portrait of Emily that Joseph had painted, in one of the spare rooms (my wife accompanied us, of course, for she was never far from my side through that whole night). Shelton nodded appreciatively. �One of Joe&#8217;s best, I daresay, though the one he&#8217;s working on for Tatiana could give it a run for its money.�

�I would love to see that!� Emily declared.

�If I were bold, I would hang it in front room for all to see,� Shelton said. �I know my wife would love that. But it will have to go in the bedroom.�

�I wanted to hang this in our bedchamber,� I said, �but humble little Emily wouldn&#8217;t have that.�

My wife flushed. �Would you want to see yourself, staring at you, while playing bed, sir?�

�Better that than a picture of your mother,� Alfonso joked, and we laughed at that. While in that spare room, Emily removed her corset (and would be naked for the remainder of the party) and had all three of us on the small bed, taking Alfonso&#8217;s huge black cock in her ass while sucking Shelton&#8217;s cock. While I fucked her cunt, I teased her. 

�Emily, you&#8217;re looking at yourself, but you can&#8217;t see it with all of this flesh surrounding you. Yes, three big sweaty men to fuck you, what a dream come true for a tiny whore.� Emily muffled a weak protest around Shelton&#8217;s cock, and we all laughed at her and pounded into her, managing to come in short succession. My poor wife was gagging down Shelton&#8217;s huge load while dripping from both of her holes, and she gave us all a weak, watery-eyed smile, kneeling on the bed as we all stood and loomed over her.

�Sir, you&#8217;re cruel, quite cruel,� she said, the smile never fading from her lips or eyes.

�And you love it, don&#8217;t you, whore?� I demanded. She held up her arms for an embrace, and I held her while our friends started from the room. I kissed my wife and picked her up, carrying her easily back down to the parlor to join the rest of our friends. We still had plenty more playtime ahead of us.

Tatiana did not disappoint me that evening. For not only had she brought her own strap-on phallus, but she had also brought a new one, as a Christmas gift for my Emily. �Fit it around your waist, dear, and let the phallus dangle,� a naked Tatiana demonstrated for her. Mrs. Steepleton, though used to her lover&#8217;s huge black cock, was fascinated by the device. Emily, wearing her strap-on, swung her hips and let the phallus swing, and she giggled. I couldn&#8217;t help smiling.

�Mary,� I suggested, �Perhaps you&#8217;d like Lady Emily to try her new toy out on you?�

Mrs. Steepleton eagerly bent over the edge of one of the side tables, and Emily, with me standing close by, fucked her in her ass. My wife was hesitant at first, thrusting awkwardly, but her whorish friend encouraged her to pound harder. �Come, Lady Emily, you know how hard Alfonso can fuck�oh, come, Lady Emily, fuck me hard!�

My wife eventually got into a rhythm with her thrusts, and grinned, perhaps reminded of when she&#8217;d raped Lydia&#8217;s virgin ass in San Francisco. As Emily fucked her, she was fingering Mrs. Steepleton&#8217;s clit, and successfully made the lady come.&nbsp; When she pulled out and stepped away, I replaced my wife and she stood by, hands on hips, shit-covered phallus still dangling, and watched.

Meanwhile, Tatiana had started to make use of the restraints. She had tied her brother-in-law to the back of a chair, and he straddled the seat of it awkwardly as she fucked him with her own strap-on, jerking him off as she pounded expertly. When he tilted his head back, moaning, it was clear that he had been blindfolded. After filling Mrs. Steepleton&#8217;s ass, I sought a blindfold for my Emily, removing her strap-on and forcing her to her knees.

I motioned to Tatiana, who was spent from fucking Joseph. She sat on the couch, her legs spread, and I took my wife by the collar and guided her between Tatiana&#8217;s legs. I tied her hands behind her back before I allowed her to begin pleasuring her friend. I watched the girls together (though my attention was briefly caught by the sight of Sra. Santos beating her naked aunt with one of the riding crops). When Emily had made her friend come, and had cleaned her as lovingly as a mother cat cleaning her kittens, Tatiana said, �Well, Lady Emily, you know that your husband will not allow me to return the favor. But what I can do to please you, my friend?�

Blindfolded, lightly bound Emily made a surprising request of her pregnant friend (for Tatiana was quite large in her nakedness, only a couple of months from giving birth to her second child). �May I drink of you?� she asked shyly, flushing slightly.

Tatiana looked at me in surprise, and I could not suppress a grin. My dear little Emily had never had a woman&#8217;s milk before, never, I realized. Oh, she did not know�she could not possibly imagine how lovely it tasted. Tatiana, always generous, did offer up her nipple to her friend, and Emily suckled contentedly for a couple of minutes as I stroked myself. When I helped my wife to her feet and asked her how it tasted, she admitted, �A bit strange, sir.� I had to laugh at that, and I kissed her.

�Naughty little girl, I&#8217;m sure that some people here would love to punish you,� I said, and led her, still blind and restrained, to the larger table. I had her kneel, and I lashed her wrists to one of the sturdy table legs. Her back exposed as she knelt, I gave all of the guests a chance to beat her with their choice of flogging device, and blind Emily had no way of knowing who, or what, would be hitting her next as her friends lovingly reined blows on her back and ass. Her backside was a garish red, and her face was streaked with tears, by the time her punishment was finished.

While Emily was being abused, I enjoyed a little pleasure from Joseph while Sra. Santos teasingly fingered his ass (for she is the only woman I ever knew who was more turned on by two men playing than my own wife), and even that was enough to cause the sensitive boy to shoot his load all over the couch. He, in many ways as submissive as my wife, proceeded to lick up the mess himself.

The party was a success, to be sure, and our friends all went home thoroughly satisfied. After dressing, Emily (the calm, happy hostess again�one would never guess that she&#8217;d just been used as a nasty little pain-slut for the past three hours) led Shelton and his wife, and Joseph, to their quarters for the night, for they would be staying with us and going on to the train station with us in the morning. I was already in the room, undressing again, when she came back in from the nursery, having checked on the quietly sleeping children one last time.

Though Emily smiled radiantly, very pleased with herself, as she undressed to join me for bed I observed, �Dearest, you did not come very much during our little party.�

Emily looked thoughtful for a moment. �Twice,� she said thoughtfully. �When you fucked me, of course, sir, and while I was being whipped.�

I laughed again. I knew that she had always enjoyed her punishments, much more than would seem natural, but I could not recall a time when she had come just from punishment alone. She flushed again, grinning, knowing my thoughts. �My nasty little exhibitionist whore,� I teased, for I knew that being around others, having them abuse her for their own pleasure, turned her on so. �We will have to have more parties for our friends, won&#8217;t we?�

�Oh, yes, sir.� And though she felt she&#8217;d gotten her share of pleasure, I had her ride me one more time, and gave her more of the pleasure that I knew she so deserved.


I would have preferred to spend Christmas more quietly, but I knew that Emily was quite in her element at the Shelton&#8217;s large country house. There was more than enough room to accommodate us, with some of the siblings (many of them attending school themselves, and off for their break) doubling up in the rooms. They kindly offered us the master bedchamber, but Emily gave it up to the Sheltons, for she felt that it was their family home (though she&#8217;d been the one to pay for it). Such things never mattered much to Emily, and she was just as happy in the slightly smaller corner room, looking over the lovely little duck pond in the backyard, frozen over with the winter chill.

The house was perfectly warm and comfortable, and full of bustling activity. Emily got on well with the older Shelton girls, and teenaged Alice was glued to her side during our entire week there. Alice was absolutely in love with Emily, and the relationship that developed between them later was no surprise to me at all. I would even say that, though I was her husband and loved her for all of her life, Alice was, in many ways, her true soul mate. Of course, it would be years after this Christmas celebration that they would begin any such relationship, and all was perfectly innocent at that time. Still, I could see the future, and it pleased me.

Though they had resided in the city for most of their young lives, all of the Shelton boys had taken well to country life. The day before Christmas Eve, all of us men set out early to hunt for geese. Emily saw us off in the early morning, packing our provisions and wishing us luck. As we set out, the next oldest Shelton boy, who was in his first year at a respectable university, commented, �Sir Aaron, your wife is a fine woman.�

Shelton and his twin exchanged knowing glances, and I smiled modestly. �Thank you,� I said, and we left the subject there. I had no intention of sharing my lovely wife with the entire Shelton family. Whore that she was, I was still the one to choose her partners, and I certainly wouldn&#8217;t have her bending over for any good-looking young man who showed his attentions. Our stay at the Shelton house, on the whole, was quite tame. Emily and the other girls saw to the care of the young children, and Mina ran about as usual, while I spent time with the Shelton men, enjoying the company of other gentlemen for the first time in far too long. Our conversations did often veer into sexual territory, particularly after a few drinks, but these discussions were still fairly mild.

We enjoyed a lovely Christmas feast, with the geese that we had bagged on our trip (most from me, being the most experienced hunter in the group). After exchanging gifts (I had saved all of the gifts for Emily back home, waiting to give them to her in private), we all went to our rooms. Emily and I kept the curtains parted, and with a full, bright moon and the snow-covered grounds, the room glowed strangely as I tied her to the guest bed and fucked her sweetly. We slept while bathed in that glow, whispering to each other, �Happy Christmas, my love.�

We parted for home a couple of days before the New Year, the Sheltons staying on with their family. The rest of our holidays were quiet, compared with our wild party and the busy Christmas with the Sheltons, as we stayed in Wainwright Hall and cared for the girls and for ourselves on our own. I always did enjoy those solitary holidays with Emily, alone in Wainwright Hall, no servants or friends around, just the two of us. And our girls�ah, but they were good girls, demanding as they could be at times, they did give us just enough peace and quiet to enjoy each other properly.

Our lives continued as such for quite some time, and we were perfectly happy and contented once again. For the first time ever, I did not doubt my Emily&#8217;s happiness. I knew that her smiles were not forced, that she was not dissembling for my sake, or for the sake of the little girls. Our babies grew up healthy in our loving care, and Mina started to become a young woman, as bold and inquisitive as ever, and ready to go out and begin her life.

Emily did not allow herself to cry over Mina&#8217;s going to school until our daughter&#8217;s train had pulled away from the station in London. In the weeks prior to Mina&#8217;s departure, Emily had seen to all of the details, that she had her uniforms ready and her undergarments and other clothing, the proper footwear for any occasion, the proper toiletries, her correct schoolbooks. She seemed as excited as she would have been, if she were preparing to go off to school herself. But when the train left, and I put my arm around her little shoulders, she sobbed. �Oh, sir, our little girl!� I embraced her and laughed softly as she cried against my chest. �Our only child, sir, and she&#8217;s grown now.�

The poor dear was thinking of Peter again, our lost son who would never get the chance to go to school. �There, now, darling,� I said. �We have our little ones, our collective children, and we love them so.�

�Oh, yes,� Emily agreed readily. At that point already, we each had our favorite of the little girls. We each favored the other&#8217;s child, perhaps to compensate for our lack of blood relation. Emily doted on chubby little Beatrice, and I adored sweet little Charlotte, whose peaceful manner reminded me of the time I had held her mother in my arms, when she had only been a tiny baby herself.

�And we may have more children yet,� I reminded her. And so we did, as she would soon learn that she was pregnant with our last child, our dear little boy Avery. Emily was equally devoted to all three of the youngest children, in part to make up for what she viewed as her failure to care for our first two children. She never could completely rid herself of her guilt, the poor little dear. But she was genuinely happy with our family.

Emily always devoted herself completely to me as well. For the rest of her life, she was my dedicated little sex slave, my darling whore, my only one. She&#8217;d give herself to others, certainly, with my prompting and approval, as happy with our little games as she ever was. She&#8217;d even fall in love with Alice. But she was all mine, always, and while I don&#8217;t think that eternity would have been enough time for me to enjoy her thoroughly, I still appreciate the years that I had with her.



























Lady Emily&#8217;s Diary

3 June, 18&#8212;

Our little routine here at Wainwright Hall was disrupted by the arrival of a guest. My dear little Alice Shelton has come to visit us! I cannot believe that the dear girl, whom I have known since she was a little precocious girl of 10, is now 18, and finished with her schooling. Though we have been in frequent correspondence, and have seen one another at least twice a year since she went off to school, I still could not believe that the lovely young woman who came into our parlor this afternoon was really her.

My young friend looked quite smart in her traveling dress and hat as we sat down for tea. Rebecca and I had been playing with the children, and when my guest arrived, the dutiful nanny had scooped them up (after Auntie Alice had the chance to give them each a little kiss) and led them up to the expanded nursery. �I cannot believe how big the children are getting,� Alice remarked. �Little Avery looks just like his father.�

�Indeed he does,� I said proudly. Yes, my little boy is the image of his father, through and through. And dear little Charlotte looks more and more like her Auntie Alice each day. All three of my young children are lovely, as is my little Mina, a teenager herself now. She is on holiday with the family of a school friend, and will be joining us at the end of the month. I do miss my girl, but she is as independent as ever. As long as she remembers to write (and she does not often forget to keep in touch with me), I am at least assured.

Alice and I talked for a while about her family, her sister Bernadette&#8217;s upcoming wedding, and we talked a bit about Tatiana, who is currently in bed (by orders of Dr. Yates) as she approaches the end of her fourth pregnancy. Her children have all been born healthy and well, thank goodness, and though her current pregnancy has not been accompanied by any especial complications, she is carrying twins. Alice had been to see her just this morning, and reported that the poor dear could hardly move under the weight of her belly. �She&#8217;s very impatient. You know how active she&#8217;s always been,� Alice said simply, only hinting slightly to her sister-in-law&#8217;s activities.

I do wonder how much Alice knows of all of our sexual activities. Certainly she is not a stupid girl. After all, she lived adjacent to a whorehouse for several years. But it is not something that she and I have ever discussed�at least, not yet. I&#8217;m sure that my husband, for one, would say that it is time to have such a discussion with her, as she is now a grown woman, and very sexy herself.

I do blush to admit it, but Alice is so lovely. I do adore her; in fact, I love her very much and regard her as my very dearest friend. Though I feel a motherly protectiveness over her, as I always have, there is a part of me�a very strong part, and growing by the minute�that desires her. My dear husband, who knows me so well, is aware, and this evening he began to gently encourage me to seduce her. �It would not be very difficult,� he observed. �She is devoted to you.�

True, which gives me pause. I do not wish to manipulate her feelings for me. I know that she adores me as well, has always looked up to me, and I&#8217;ve always tried to be a good role model for her. I do not wish to do to her what Lydia Morrison did to me. I do not want to exploit her longing for affection for my own pleasure. My sweet Alice is like me in so many ways, intelligent but very trusting, and like myself, has lost so much. I&#8217;d never do a thing to hurt her.

I must pause in my writing; I snuck up for a private moment before sitting down to a late dinner with Alice and my husband. We had invited Daniel to join us, but he is very devoted to his invalid wife, and when he is not at the office he is right by her side. Joseph would be with us, no doubt, but that he is currently in London for an �extended stay.� He writes to me that he is happy there, that he has found a new love�he is too shy to write very many details, so I cannot wait to see him again and hear all of his good news. If anyone deserves happiness, it is my dear friend Joseph.

I am off to supper, then. Goodnight!


16 July, 18&#8212;

My husband has done the strangest and most wonderful thing. I cannot even begin to think of what a generous, loving man he is, and surely I do not deserve all of the kindness that he gives to me. How does he know me so well? How can he see what is really in my heart? He has always been able to do this.

For a while, my husband&#8217;s amazing ability to know me completely frightened me, as I had thoughts that I wanted to keep from him (particularly with regards to Lydia Morrison), for when he knew these, they would hurt him. But since we have been together again for these years, he has not judged me for my thoughts or desires, not once, and now he wants to give me what I have truly, secretly wanted. Such a dear man! I know that I have been dealt my share of bad luck, but I cannot deny that I am so very fortunate to have him. I am gladder than I have ever been that I gave myself to him, all those years ago (our sixteenth wedding anniversary is approaching very soon, I can hardly believe it!). He deserves my all, and no less, and I do try so hard to be worthy!

I must explain. It should be no surprise that Alice and I have become intimate. My husband, though wishing for it to happen, did not instigate it. No�during dinner that first night when Alice came to stay with us, he behaved himself, and was thoroughly charming and not at all naughty. He even dismissed himself not long after supper. �Your brother and I have a very busy caseload, and I am taking on as much as I can so that he can see to his wife,� he explained to Alice by way of apology. �Dear,� he addressed me, �I will see to the little ones and dismiss Rebecca for the evening. Goodnight, ladies.�

I was surprised by my husband&#8217;s hasty departure, as he is often as eager as I to socialize, but I was grateful to have more time alone with Alice to talk. Especially when the subject of her future plans came up. �So, dear, you graduated at the top of your class,� I commented proudly. �You have not told me what your plans are for university.�

An eager look came into Alice&#8217;s eyes; she&#8217;d been waiting for this. �Well, Mrs. Singer,� she said (addressing me as she always had, which is somehow a comfort to me), �I wish to follow in my brother Danny&#8217;s footsteps and go to Cambridge. I have been accepted.�

�Oh, my dear, why haven&#8217;t you told me?� I asked, but I was very happy for her indeed. She admitted that she wasn&#8217;t sure if she could afford to go. Ah! I read her completely then; she&#8217;d come to ask for the money for school, knowing that her brother, though he was making a generous salary as my husband&#8217;s partner, would now have a wife and five children to care for. I scolded her lightly. �Alice, my dear, you do not ever have to ask me for favors. You are my friend, dear, and I am happy to get you anything that you need. Your tuition must be paid? It is done�no, dear,� I said, smiling as she tried to protest, to negotiate some terms of repayment, �Don&#8217;t you dare even think of trying to pay me back. The money is nothing to me; it will not make a dent in my fortune, I assure you, and I am always happy to help.�

Alice stared at me in wonder. �Mrs. Singer, you really are the kindest, most generous��

�Please,� I said, flushing, �Don&#8217;t say that. I am very, very fortunate. It is my responsibility to help others.� That is something that my dear Mr. Singer has always taught me (though even he has been surprised at how far I have taken his lesson at times). 

Alice knew that her praise would only fluster me, and so she settled back in her chair. �Thank you, Mrs. Singer.�

�You&#8217;re welcome, my dear,� I said. And we began to chat pleasantly about her excitement to begin school, about what she would study. I briefly imagined her meeting boys (she, like my Mina, attended an all-girl&#8217;s school, though I doubt that her exposure to young men has been limited), perhaps finding a nice young man to marry. I still have such thoughts, for she is not my property, she is not my pet, only my lover and friend, and she will still be leaving me to pursue these dreams. I only wish her all the best.

Well, that night our talk did not turn sexual, though we did stay up quite late, simply talking. We have always been able to do so, even when she was a young girl. My darling Mina, who is a young woman herself, does not have the patience to sit and talk on, and so we bond in other ways. It feels very nice to regard Alice as a friend and an equal�and now, of course, as a lover.

I&#8217;ll explain how it all came about. When I bade Alice goodnight and showed her to her room, I went to the nursery and found my husband sitting alone with the sleeping children. I was surprised to see him, reading by the light of a single candle, and he looked at me as I quietly entered, smiling. �I knew you would come in here first.�

�Sir, is something the matter?�

My husband was surprised by my startled look. �Why, no, Emily, nothing is the matter at all. I could not sleep, so I thought I would sit in with the children and wait for you.� He smiled, as I&#8217;m certain that a look of relief came to my face. He can read me so easily, though again, I hardly feel the need to hide anything from him anymore. He stood and came to me, putting his hands on my waist. �Let&#8217;s go into our room and have a talk.�

And so, as we were naked in our bed together, he touched me softly and convinced me to go after Alice, to seduce her into playing our little games. �I know you want to do it, Emily,� he teased me, tracing a gentle finger over my hard nipple. �So to cast aside any hesitation, I order it to be done. And so you must.�

I giggled, for no other logic that he could have presented would have been more sound. �Yes, sir.�

�Good girl,� he praised me, and that settled the matter for the time being, and he tied me up and had me the way that he likes best. 

Though I had my master&#8217;s orders, I still could not think of how to bring up the subject with Alice. But the very next day, I was inspired with an idea. She and I were walking alone on the grounds of Wainwright Hall, enjoying a comfortable summer afternoon while Rebecca saw to the napping children. She and I were talking about travel, and I mentioned that, besides excursions to London and to the Shelton home, I had not gone anywhere since that disastrous trip to St. Tropez.

�Mrs. Singer,� Alice asked, �You&#8217;ve been to so many places. Do you ever grow restless at home?�

Had anyone else, even my dear loving husband, asked me such a question, I would have quickly denied it. But with Alice, I could be honest as I said, �Sometimes. There are still places I wish to go, but the children are so little still. But you know, more than actually seeing new places and meeting strange people, I miss the anticipation of getting to a new destination. The traveling�I used to enjoy it so much.� I had never even had these conscious thoughts; they just came forth. Alice is able to extract secret truths from me, somehow. 

I continued, �While you&#8217;re still young, and unwed, you should go out and see the world. In fact,� I said, suddenly forgetting my goal with a new inspiration, �Perhaps you might want to spend the summer traveling abroad? I&#8217;d be happy to set you up with��

�Oh, no, thank you, Mrs. Singer,� Alice hurriedly cut me off, flushing. �I do want to travel, but�I&#8217;d really just like to spend the summer with family.� She slipped her hand into mine, smiling shyly, and I said nothing more of her leaving.

I added, �I do stay occupied. The children keep me very busy, then there&#8217;s Mr. Singer to see to, and we do have a busy social calendar. I&#8217;m afraid that you&#8217;ll be subjected to a number of parties while you&#8217;re here.�

�I certainly wouldn&#8217;t mind,� Alice said. I had another idea, one that I knew she could not refuse: I offered to host a debutante ball in her honor. �Oh, Mrs. Singer, that would be wonderful,� she said, flushing again. 

�I can have one ready in short order,� I said. �It&#8217;s a busy season, but we can host your party in a couple of weeks. Oh, it&#8217;ll be very good timing, there are fragrant flowers in bloom in the garden this time of year, it&#8217;ll be the perfect time for an outdoor party.� And we talked on about the plans for her party, while in the back of my mind a different plan was forming.

Just as my master schemed to claim me on my birthday, so I intended to seduce Alice on the night of her debutante ball. I would not claim her by trickery or deceit, which my dear Mr. Singer used on me (and bless his heart, I was such a shy little thing that no other method would have been effective). No, I would simply share with her my intentions, and if she rejected them, well�

I was terribly afraid that she would reject me, that she would be shocked and repulsed by my advances. I was mostly afraid that she would feel compelled to play along, as I had been so generous to her. I certainly did not (and do not) want her to feel obligated to be with me. On the night of the party, as I played the smiling hostess for all of our friends and neighbors (and many eligible young men for Alice), I was still anxious about how I would bring up the subject.

My husband, of course, read me clearly. He was privy to all of my plans, and he knew that I was feeling less than confident. He tried to distract me as we stood watching the young dancers. �This puts me in mind of your debutante ball,� he said softly in my ear. �I was in agony that night. All those young men�I was already in love with you.�

My husband is still the center of my world. I looked at him then, and noted, as I frequently do, how very handsome he is. His hair, though it continues to grey, is as thick as ever, and I do love to run my hands through it. The lines on his face are deepening, but it makes his face appear even stronger than ever. When he looks at me intently with his deep eyes, everything is so clear. One such look from him and a squeeze of his big hand holding my small one were enough to calm my nerves.

The party ran very late, and when the last of the guests departed, I was afraid that little Alice, who had danced and flirted all night, would be eager to go to bed. But no; she smiled at me with a look of renewed energy. �Oh, Mrs. Singer, it was so wonderful! Thank you.� She kissed my cheek softly, a familiar gesture, but the brush of her lips was so warm and soft�

I took her hand. �We may leave the cleaning for the servants in the morning. Come, join me and Mr. Singer in the study for one more glass of champagne.� Alice eagerly followed me into the house, and my husband, anticipating us, already had a bottle opened in his office.

�Well, Alice,� he said conversationally as he handed her a glass, �Are there any young men whom you are interested in?�

Alice flushed only a little at my husband&#8217;s forward questioning. Though her relationship with him is not nearly as close as ours, they certainly are friends, and she is not unfamiliar with his sometimes blunt ways. �They were all very nice,� she said evasively. Knowing that such an answer was unsatisfactory, she added, �Do you know Thurston Mangrich?� 

�Why, yes,� I said, �he is Mrs. Phillips&#8217;s nephew.� Of course, I knew the names of each of the attendees, whether or not I had previously made their acquaintance, and I knew their connection with the people in our county. My husband laughs at my little talent for names all the time.

Flushing more, Alice admitted that she found him very interesting. �He&#8217;s starting his third year at Cambridge, and we&#8217;ve already made arrangements for him to show me about the campus.�

I expressed happiness at her success, but I felt dejected. Would I never have my chance with her? Had all of my hoping and planning been for naught? My husband glanced at me briefly, and easily understood my feelings, and in his way, he expertly steered the conversation. Alice, light-headed with drink, laughed and answered my husband&#8217;s questions about any previous involvement she may have had with boys in school.

�I was a good student,� Alice said, her tone only lightly defensive as she smiled and took another drink of her champagne. �Some of the girls in the dormitory liked to sneak out at night and go into the village to see the young men at the pub�I did not often join them.�

�Often?� My husband grinned at Alice, and I saw that same glint in his eye. Oh, he was luring her in, how could he always do that? I could not help smiling.

Alice looked at me, and seeing my smile, continued on in her same casual tone. �Sometimes, I would go out with my friends. It was mostly innocent, you know, a little dancing and just a little drinking.�

�Just dancing?� My husband&#8217;s tone was a bit more serious now.

�The other girls often took boys out back�there were stables behind the pub�and, well�� She did flush again. �I&#8217;m sure that you can surmise the rest.�

�You never spent any time alone with a young man?� Such a personal question, but my husband asked it in such an off-hand way. He asked it in a way that seemed so careless, but looking at him, I wondered how Alice could refuse to answer.

She didn&#8217;t. �There was one,� she admitted, having taken another drink. �A young man who had come into the village with his grandfather for farming supplies. He was a country boy through and through, but very sweet.� She looked at me again and added, �He reminded me a bit of Joseph, I suppose, just a little bit na�ve, or I should say that he appears to be that way.� I knew what she meant; Joseph and his twin brother Daniel are both so boyish in appearance it makes them seem so safe and innocent. In many ways, both of them are safe, though certainly not innocent or na�ve. I nodded and smiled, and she continued. �I was at the pub with my girl friends, and he came in alone. My friends and I were receiving the attentions of some eager young men from the adjacent boys&#8217; school, but�well,� she admitted, �I suppose that those boys are not really my type. So foppish, you know��

My husband had to laugh at that. �You&#8217;re quite right about that, my dear,� he said, for the boys&#8217; school adjacent to hers was his own alma mater. �We were more than a little pampered there, it is quite shameful.� To me he added, �Your father and I were able to break those habits during our adventures in Africa.�

�Undoubtedly you are quite manly, sir,� I said, wearing a grin of my own, for this fun conversation had turned my mood right around. I said to Alice, �So this rugged young farm hand must have been an interesting sight.�

�Oh, indeed,� Alice said, flushing again. �He quite reminded me of a boy that I had a little crush on, back when Joseph and I lived among the migrant workers in California. He was wearing what must have been his nicest shirt, though the cuffs and collar were more than a bit frayed, and he had these big, strong shoulders�� It was so strange and thrilling to see that look in Alice&#8217;s eyes, for she had clearly been turned on by this strong young man, and the memory of him excited her as well.

Somehow, her hand slipped into mine, and she had slid closer to me on the couch (my husband, perching more than sitting, in one of the arm chairs) as she continued her story. �He sat down at the bar, away from our little party, and I�well, I don&#8217;t know what came over me, but I stood right up and went right over to him. We started talking�his name was Samuel, Sam, and he told me all about how he lived and worked on his grandfather&#8217;s farm, how his grandfather was very successful, but had been unable to pass his land on to any of his sons as they had both died. Sam and his mother lived on the farm, and Sam&#8217;s life had but one course to follow�to take over the land upon his grandfather&#8217;s passing.� A wistful look came to Alice&#8217;s eyes for a moment. �I pitied him. After he&#8217;d had more than a couple of pints, he admitted to me that when he came to town with his grandfather, he liked to come into the pub and see the school boys. He wanted so badly to go to school, to have a chance to do anything other than what he&#8217;s being forced to do.�

�Poor thing,� I murmured, for to some extent, I can relate to his plight (not that I would ever say that I did not want the life that I was given, that it was not truly my destiny), and Alice squeezed my hand.

�So we talked, and I told him a little bit of my experiences, and he found it so interesting. Sam had never been anywhere, really, not even to London. I thought about him the other day after our conversation,� she admitted to me. �What it would be like to never go anywhere�I cannot imagine.

�The crowd in the pub became very loud and boisterous as the other students drank more and more, wanting to get as drunk as possible before having to sneak back to their dorms.� I wondered briefly if Mina, such a young girl still, would ever partake in such activities at her school. Undoubtedly the opportunities exist�I still have not been able to bring this topic up with her, though I know she would speak with me honestly.

Alice went on to explain that she and Sam left the pub. They did not go to the stables, which would be crowded with other young couples, but walked along the streets, then out onto a country road leading back to her school. He walked her all the way back to the gates, where she knew to sneak in, and they talked quietly the whole way. Before he helped her over the fence, he kissed her softly. �It was awkward, and we both stank of beer,� she admitted with a sigh. �But it was a sweet kiss, and he was a nice boy.�

�Was that the last of him?� Mr. Singer asked, not too eagerly.

�We met one more time, a few months later,� Alice said. �Every time I ventured out with my friends, I hoped to see him. When he finally appeared, looking just as I remembered him, I thought I was imagining him at first. But he smiled over at me, and I approached him again, and we got to catching up.

�We did not stay at the pub very long. We took a walk, but instead of going back to my school, we went to the small house that his grandfather owns in the village, for his stays there were frequent. He revealed that his grandfather was out with friends, and we went upstairs�I didn&#8217;t imagine before that moment that I would really do that, with him, but it happened so naturally, I didn&#8217;t even think about it, and�� She smiled, and blushed deeply. She put her free hand to her burning cheek while continuing to grasp mine in the other.

�That was only a few months ago,� Alice admitted. �Last autumn. I never did see Sam again. When we were finished, he took me up on the rooftop. It was a cool night, and the sky was so bright and clear, and we just sat together, and we didn&#8217;t say anything. I think we&#8217;d already said everything necessary.� The wistful look came to her eyes again. �He walked me back to school, and that was that. Perhaps I�I was trying to avoid him, because I hardly went out at all for the rest of the year. I don&#8217;t know why�I would think of him sometimes, wonder how he was doing. I never heard from him, and I would not have known how to get in touch with him.�

I stroked Alice&#8217;s hand comfortingly. Mr. Singer comforted her by saying, �Your story sounds like a typical tryst for a young lady to have. You&#8217;re not ashamed, are you?�

�Oh, no,� Alice said, with no hesitation. �It isn&#8217;t anything to be ashamed of�isn&#8217;t that so, Mrs. Singer?�

And the conversation continued from there. Alice revealed that she knew of some of our sexual activities, which I had always suspected. �The church always said that such things were wrong,� Alice said. �But�but if Mrs. Singer does those things, and she is such a good person, then it couldn&#8217;t be wrong, could it?� It seems that, though she&#8217;d grappled a bit with her morality after her encounter with Sam, she had come to her conclusion quite easily. It was not shame in her desires that caused her to avoid Sam. That, she could not easily name. She knew that she had not loved him�the feelings that she did have for him were much more difficult to identify.

�But that is in the past now, I suppose,� Alice said. �And I really am more eager to become better acquainted with Thurston Mangrich.� 

�Not a foppish fellow, is he?� my husband asked, a look of amusement in his eyes.

�I daresay not,� Alice said. �He&#8217;s a country boy himself, though a wealthy one at that. He&#8217;s very smart. I hate nothing more than making a clever remark to a man and having it go right over his head. I don&#8217;t have such awkward moments with him.�

My husband and I both briefly nodded in agreement, and as I fretted over what to say next, my husband asked a rather shocking question. �Alice, I&#8217;ve always been a little curious, so if you&#8217;d please indulge me�?�

Alice gave him an inquisitive look. �Certainly.�

�You and your school friends,� he said. �Did any of you ever�you know�play together, in the privacy of your dorms?�

I held my breath in anticipation of Alice&#8217;s response, for it would determine all. To my very great relief, she laughed loudly. �Mr. Singer,� she said, �Why should I not be surprised that you would ask me such a question?�

�Because you know that I am a dirty old man, Alice.� I giggled and flushed as my husband threw me a wink. �Out with it. Tell us all, we&#8217;re all friends here.�

Alice sighed, smiling brightly, though her cheeks were colored as well. �I was shocked by some of it at first, but�I came to figure that it was perfectly normal. You know, the &#8216;practice&#8217; kissing and the touching under the covers�again, I came to see that there was nothing truly wrong with it, it just isn&#8217;t something that people discuss. I mean,� she said, laughing a little, �Unless they&#8217;re talking with the Singers, of course.� Her grip on my hand tightened.

�Alice,� I said, �How did you feel, kissing and touching the other girls in the dorm?� She was very close to me then. It would have taken very little physical effort on my part to lean forward and kiss her.

The laughter was gone from her voice as she answered me. �I felt very safe with the other girls,� she confessed as she looked into my eyes. �It should be understood, Mrs. Singer, that I shared a room with three other girls. All of us became extremely close. You even met them at my graduation, do you remember my little group of friends?�

�Of course,� I said, and I could clearly see them in my mind&#8217;s eye, a small group of bright, beautiful young women, ready to go out into the world and get what they could out of it. They seemed like sweet girls, and I could see that Alice had been very happy with her friends at school. Again, something that I missed out on was forming such very close relationships with other girls. The closest that I came was my dear Tatiana, and our little explorations didn&#8217;t begin until after I was married. I felt a small amount of envy for my little friend Alice, that she could have already experienced so much, but�well, I remember again my dependency on my husband, how happy he makes me. I cannot have it all, that is certain, and I have come to accept it. But I do have so much.

And that night, I finally had Alice. Offering up more champagne, my husband continued to encourage the conversation, asking Alice about her little friends, asking what they had done together, and very soon, she was demonstrating for him with my aid. I slowly removed her white debutante gown, my fingers trembling with excitement as my mind was reeling. My dear little Alice, my innocent friend, was not only was not a virgin, but had already had several encounters with other young ladies. I look at her and smiled approvingly, and her look was so eager that she certainly reminded of myself yet again. My dear, lovely Alice!

I barely caressed her naked breast as I looked into her eyes. �Oh, Alice,� I whispered. �You know that I do love you very much, don&#8217;t you, dear?�

�Of course, Mrs. Singer,� she said. �I love you, too.�

�May I kiss you, Alice?�

I was startled to see the tears that sprang in her eyes, but her next words were just what I&#8217;d imagined her saying in my sweetest of dreams. �Oh, Mrs. Singer,� she said, laughing even as her tears flowed, �You may do anything that you want to me.�

I leaned in and kissed her softly. She tasted very sweet, her lips were so soft and her tongue was so graceful. She certainly knew what she was doing there. I could not resist leaning in and kissing her neck, and I felt her breathe in sharply. I reached out and grasped her breasts; her little tits are just the right size for my little hands to squeeze, but gently. I played with her nipples as I continued to kiss her neck and mouth.

We were interrupted briefly by my husband when he said, �Lady Emily, do take off your gown, please.�

I tore myself away from my new lover and gave my husband a smile. �Yes, sir.� As Alice helped me from my gown, I said, �You know that I am my husband&#8217;s property, don&#8217;t you?�

Alice looked at me a little uncertainly, but did not stop helping me undress. �I know that�um, well�� She had some grasp of our situation, but did not understand what it meant for her.

I smiled at her gently. Now naked myself, I took her hands and placed them on my breasts (small now, and I am beginning to fear that they will never swell with milk ever again�). �You may touch me here,� I said. I slid her hands down to my waist. �And here, certainly.� Further down, to my ass. �You may play with my ass as well. But you must understand that my pussy�it is his alone, and no one else&#8217;s. And he must always watch and be present whilst we play.�

�All right, Mrs. Singer.� She seemed to understand this, and did not question it. Though now, thanks to my dear loving husband, one of his rules (at least in her case) is now irrelevant�I will explain that in a moment.

�Alice,� I said, �Did any of your girlfriends at school ever eat your pussy?�

Alice flushed again, mostly to hear such terms come from me. �Yes,� she admitted. �Not very often, but one of my roommates and I�her name was Nelly�would occasionally play like that together.�

My husband cut in, �Alice, I give you my guarantee that my wife has an extraordinary talent for giving pleasure to others. Will you allow her to do so for you?�

From the way her face lit up, I could tell that nothing would please her more. I advised her to lie back on the couch. �Just relax, Alice, and spread your legs for me, dear�so lovely.� Her little cunt was well-groomed, and I could see that she was very tight. I could also see the little bud of her clit, slightly engorged, eager for some attention, which I provided. I leaned in and darted out my tongue, lapping at her clit while she shuddered.

I went slowly and gave as much careful attention to Alice as possible. I&#8217;ve never left a lover unsatisfied, but no one else but my husband has received such dutiful attention from me. I teased her pussy lips before penetrating her with my tongue, kissing her cunt as I had kissed her mouth. I gradually increased the rate of tongue thrusts as her groans and cries urged me on. She got to begging, which turned me on most. �Oh, Mrs. Singer, please�let me come, Mrs. Singer, oh, God!� 

I&#8217;d never deny pleasure to my little Alice, and I teased her clit roughly while shoving two fingers into her. I felt her body tense up in anticipation, which released in a lovely spastic burst. Alice cried out for me wordlessly, and as I cleaned away her juices, she panted, �Thank you, Mrs. Singer�oh, God, thank you.�

I sat up and my husband (his cock visibly hard in his trousers) brought me his handkerchief to wipe my mouth. He kissed me briefly, smiling as I trembled. Alice soon replaced him, and she kissed me hungrily, so eager to show her appreciation. But, though I was turned on, there was no way of allowing her to do so...but my husband had an idea for including her in our playing.

Alice and I, both still naked, held each other while my husband explained our use of restraints and implements of punishment. This was a bit more of a surprise to young Alice than the rest of it. �Did your brothers or sister-in-law ever tell you about our nasty games?� he asked.

Alice shook her head. �Tatiana&#8217;s told me a little�but never the details.�

I stood and turned to show her my bare backside. �Do you see all of these scars and marks, Alice?�

�Oh, Mrs. Singer!� she gasped. �They are ghastly.�

I laughed softly, for I have long since stopped worrying over my marred back. My husband strokes my scars affectionately, and says that they tell the story of my tumultuous love life. �The worst of them are from Mrs. Smithwick,� I explained. �She was very brutal. My husband is more gentle, and gives me just as much pain as I want.�

�Want?�

I nodded and sat with Alice again. �Ever since I was a young girl, I&#8217;ve craved punishment,� I said. I giggled and made a confession, one I have never told anyone. �I used to be tempted to break Mr. Singer&#8217;s rules, so that he might actually punish me. But I was too afraid of displeasing him!�

�You were always a very good girl, Emily,� my husband said with affection. I turned to him and smiled. He recently confessed to me that he sometimes misses those days when I was only a child in his care. He loves all of our children so much, but he has not been able to form the same sort of bond with our girls. �Of course,� he mused at the time, smiling, �One might say that it&#8217;s probably a good thing.�

Alice smiled at my story, for she understands how much I love my husband. �So, Mrs. Singer�you do enjoy being abused?�

�Abused?� I said. �Oh, goodness, no. No, my dear, it isn&#8217;t abuse.� I explained it to her patiently, the same way that my husband and I had once explained it all to young Mina. 

�Perhaps, Emily, it would be better to show Alice rather than tell her,� my husband observed, and I readily agreed. I stood at his command, and he sat in the armchair. �I think my little wife needs a good old-fashioned spanking. Come, Emily, lie across my lap, that&#8217;s a good girl.�

I draped my body over my master&#8217;s lap. My vision was obscured by my loosened hair, so I could not see Alice&#8217;s reaction as my husband spanked my ass with his solid palm. I cried out freely, though I did not exaggerate my cries of pain as I might have with other playmates involved. Still, I was growing wetter by the minute, and with each smack on the ass, I involuntarily rubbed against my husband&#8217;s clothed thigh. 

When my ass was stinging and burning red, my husband had me stand. Alice, sitting wide-eyed on the couch, didn&#8217;t seem certain of what to say. I was worried for a moment that she was disgusted with me, shocked, but a little smile finally came to her lips. My husband pointed out the wet spot on his pants. �Do you see how much she loves this, Alice? She needs it. Care to give it a try?�

At first, I wasn&#8217;t certain what my husband meant. Did he wish to spank Alice himself? But no�Alice sat up tall on the couch and gestured to her lap invitingly. Eagerly, I spread myself across her lap. Alice seemed to hesitate a moment; I felt her tensing up. �Alice, hit me as hard as you like, dear,� I instructed her.

She did not do so the first time, though her little smack on my stinging ass still elicited a cry from me. She eventually got into her task, and I quite voluntarily rubbed my crotch against her bare leg, moaning more in longing than in pain at the stinging blows. Alice also gave some attention to the backs of my thighs, a very sensitive place indeed. As she did so, I heard my husband say from behind me, �Spread wide, Emily.� He was kneeling behind me, and when I spread my legs, my husband began fingering and teasing me expertly, taking his time while he allowed Alice to paint my backside red with her harsh blows.

I came with a scream just as Alice delivered another stinging blow to my ass. My husband instructed her to stop, and he forced me to my knees before her to lick my juices off of her leg. I looked up at Alice as I completed my chore, and she was smiling brightly, so thrilled to be a part of our games, and at that moment, I knew that it was right.

I stayed on my knees before Alice as my husband asked her, �Well, do you enjoy our little games?�

�I do,� Alice answered. She looked at me, and I up at her, but I said nothing. 

�As long as you&#8217;re here,� my husband said, �You are welcome to play with us. I&#8217;ll confess that our games tonight were relatively tame compared to what we&#8217;d usually do, so you may want to brace yourself for some surprises.�

I giggled and Alice said, �I look forward to it.�

And since that wonderful evening, we have played together almost every evening since. Alice will be staying on with us until a couple of weeks before her term at Cambridge is to begin; then, she will go and spend time with her brothers and sisters outside of London. I will miss her terribly, and I hate the thought of losing her, even temporarily. But my husband recently comforted me with his big surprise, and of all the �surprises� he&#8217;s ever given me, I do believe that this one is the most shocking of all!

I must explain. Alice and I have been good and have followed my husband&#8217;s rules. We never play without him�we don&#8217;t even kiss or flirt openly if he is not in our presence, though we are often alone during the day while he is working. In fact, when we are alone, it is almost as though we are not lovers at all, but are just the same close friends that we always were. I suppose that it is for the best, especially with Mina spending so much time with us. She, like her father, is very good at reading others, and I have no doubt that if we weren&#8217;t as discrete as we&#8217;ve been, she would suspect everything. She knows how I like to play, and I know that it would not be shocking to her, but she and Alice are only a few short years apart in age. Somehow, I feel like her knowing that Alice is a sexual being will encourage her to do such things�and she is far too young yet!

Though my husband is always active in our playing, I recently came to realization that he and Alice have not played together themselves. Not even once! I brought the subject up with my husband first. He looked a little surprised by my asking, and only gave one answer. �Why, my love, Alice belongs to you.�

Not long after, I spoke on it with Alice in private. �I wonder that you have not been with my husband,� I said.

Alice also looked surprised. �Would it please you to see me with him, Mrs. Singer?�

�Would it please you?� I asked in surprise. �Do you not find him to be an attractive man?� I was surprising myself with how defensive I sounded.

Alice smiled a little. �Oh, yes, Mr. Singer is a very attractive man.�

�Yet you do not wish to play with him, on your own accord?�

�I don&#8217;t know why,� Alice said. �I regard Mr. Singer as a very dear friend, and he is a handsome man. But I have no desire to play with him, Mrs. Singer�not when I can play with you instead,� she added with a little grin.

I had to laugh. Alice is, perhaps, the first woman I have ever met who has not been in raptures over my husband. Even Lydia Morrison found him sexy, though she viewed him as her nemesis and competitor. I did not dare recall the conversation for my husband, for I knew that he would be insecure. I know he does not like getting older, and he would view Alice&#8217;s opinion as further proof of his deterioration. Poor, silly man! I find him more attractive every day.

Only the other day, my husband and I were sitting together in his study. It was a very hot day. Alice and Rebecca took the little ones to see Tatiana, for though she is very close to giving birth now, she is very eager for company. My husband and I visited her just a few days ago, and she had to send him from the room. �He&#8217;s so eager for me in this state,� she said, sounding both amused and disgusted. �I&#8217;m a big fat cow, and he&#8217;s never wanted me more.�

I shrugged, unable to defend my husband&#8217;s strange tastes. �He is very attracted to pregnancy,� I could only say, and we laughed a little at that. But as I said this, I felt a sense of dread. For you see, my pregnancy with young Avery was my most difficult, and I was bedridden for some weeks even after he was born. Since then, I have been pregnant twice�but have not been able to carry either one past a few months before losing it. I was in despair some months ago, after the second miscarriage, and my husband held me as I cried. �Oh, sir,� I sniffled, �I&#8217;ll never be able to give you another child!�

He assured me that it was quite all right, that he would have been just as happy all along without any children. �I love our darlings,� he assured me. �I couldn&#8217;t love them more. But if you cannot give me any more�it is just as well, my love.�

Still, I know that he misses my milk. He would have kept drinking of me himself, had we realized that Avery would be our last. I feel that it is certain that I will never have another child, though my husband is not ready to give up on that yet. Anyway, the other day in his office, we were lounging about lazily and reading to ourselves. I could feel my husband&#8217;s eyes upon me, observing me in silence as I read, but I dared not look up until he spoke.

�Emily,� he said, �You seem happier now than you&#8217;ve been in quite some time.�

I did look up at him then (for, in anticipating him to speak, I had lost my place in my reading, anyway), and I smiled and spoke truthfully. �I am very happy, sir.�

�It&#8217;s because of Alice, isn&#8217;t it?� He did not seem hurt by this. He looked rather pleased.

�Yes, sir,� I admitted. �Her, and you, and our healthy children��

My husband nodded. �You have everything that you want, my Emily?� I nodded. �You certainly deserve to�but I&#8217;m afraid that you are missing something.� As I gave him a puzzled look, he said, �I know how much you care for Alice, how much you want her. And I certainly understand. She&#8217;s beautiful, and the two of you have a very special bond. I daresay that you love her as much as you love me.�

�Oh, sir�� I said, wanting to deny it.

He put up his hand to stop me. �It is true, and it is all right. You have such a capacity for love, my dear, and it&#8217;s only right that you spread it around.� I remembered that Lydia Morrison said something like this to me once, when I confessed to her that I had relationships with the Howard sisters. So long ago�yet even after all that, I realize that I have not changed very much at all, not as much as I first thought. I am still the same, and it makes me feel so good to know it.

�Emily,� my husband said, and I was surprised at how nervous he looked. �I want to give something special to Alice, to thank her for making you so happy. I want to give you what you really want. So, my dear�if you wish for Alice to have complete access to you, I will allow for it.�

I could not comprehend his meaning at first. �Sir,� I said, �Do you mean allow her access to my pussy?�

�Yes.�

I gasped. �But, sir, it is��

�It is mine to do with as I please,� he finished, smiling. �And I wish to give it to Alice, for her pleasure. And for yours, of course.�

�Oh, sir.� I had nothing to say as I cried. He came to where I sat on the couch and held me, kissing me softly as my tears silently flowed.

�You must still only play when I am around,� he said.

�Of course, sir.�

�You&#8217;re still mine, Emily.� It seemed that he wanted to reassure himself more than tell me. 

�Always, sir.�

And I am so glad of it! For he was right in what he said. I have craved Alice as I have craved no one else. As of now, I have not told her of my husband&#8217;s generous offer, and our naughty playtime has continued as before. But tonight, I think, I will present it to her, as my husband watches. Though I know she will be thrilled (I know she has wanted it as much as I!), I find myself feeling nervous again, as I never have with one of my other friends.

Goodness! I just glanced outside and saw that the sun is beginning to set. I have been at my writing for quite some time. It is quiet in the house today; it is another hot day, and everyone has been snoozing. I will see to the children, and seek out my husband, for surely he will be returning from his offices soon. Tonight is the night that Alice will know me in a way that very few have before.



25 May, 18&#8212;

It has been so very long since I have written. My husband and I have just returned from a fortnight of traveling about the country. First, we attended Mina&#8217;s graduation from her boarding school. She will be off to Oxford in the fall, my clever little girl! Not so little�she is a woman now, and bigger than her little mother. She reminds me more of her father all the time, with her sharp features and her intent looks. She is still an active thing, but has gained an interest in chemistry, and when she is at her studies in that subject she is quite a focused person. I am very proud of the woman she is becoming.

Next, we went on to Cambridge for my dear Alice&#8217;s graduation. It has taken her three years to earn her degree in literature, a course of study that she found endlessly fascinating, but she confesses that she sees no practical use for her degree. No matter. She will soon be married to her Thurston Mangrich, who has a comfortable job with the government in London. She will live quite well.

She announced her engagement to us during our visit. I will admit, while I have known that she is Mr. Mangrich have been very involved the last three years, I was still surprised by it. I am quite happy for my dear Alice, for she could not be more excited to begin her life in London. She lived there in her younger years, first as a beggar girl on the streets, then as the downtrodden ward of a pair of sadists, but she will be returning in triumph. 

The downside to all of this�and it is a big downside�is that our love affair is over. She said to me in private, �Mrs. Singer, as much as I love you�I want to be completely faithful to my husband.� I smiled and told her that I understood, and we kissed briefly. But I am very hurt by the news that we will be lovers no more. I shared this with my husband, and I sobbed. He knows how much I love Alice, perhaps he even realizes it more than I do, so he was quite sympathetic indeed.

�We&#8217;ll have one more night with our Alice,� he said. �We&#8217;ll make it really, really count.�

Since my husband granted Alice complete access to me, we have had more and more wild times together. During the summers, her winter breaks from school, and during the handful of visits that we&#8217;ve made to Cambridge over the years (such a lovely campus!), we have played roughly and tenderly, satisfying all of our whims while my husband watches in pleasure. 

On our last night together as lovers, Alice allowed me to tie her to a chair and please her. She has not shied away from the use of restraints; indeed, she enjoys them as much as I do, and loves tying me up just as much as she loves being tied by me. I wonder if she will do such things with her Mr. Mangrich, but I am afraid to ask such questions. But that evening, it was just the two of us (for I find myself forgetting my husband&#8217;s presence as I play with Alice, though he is always watching). I ate her again and again, and she came over and over until she begged me to stop. 

After she was untied, she next tied me to one of the bedposts. We were playing in the hotel suite that my husband and I were using, adjacent to the campus. She tied me with my back against the pole, and proceeded to smack my tits with a small paddle, with my husband&#8217;s encouragement. She then fingered me lovingly, kissing me as she shoved her slender fingers up inside of me. I spread and encouraged her to go deeper. �If you have your strap-on phallus, Mrs. Singer, I&#8217;d be happy to��

My husband eagerly presented our friend with the favored toy, and she put it on and fucked me, while using her bare hands to slap my tits. She groped my tits roughly as she kissed me again, fucking me expertly, and she even cleaned me lovingly after I came. I couldn&#8217;t help crying, and while I told Alice that it was from the pleasure she&#8217;d given me, it was my knowing that we&#8217;d never play together again�

My husband knew the truth about how much Alice&#8217;s announcement distressed me. He is always so good at cheering me up, and as we rode in our carriage to Wainwright Hall this afternoon, heading home again after all of our travels, he said, �Our little Mina will be spending the summer traveling.�

�Of course, sir,� I said, for her little expedition had been my own idea. She will go to places in Europe that I have not been to myself, and I envy her little trip.

�I think it would be very nice for the little ones to get to see Amsterdam,� he said, but he really meant that he wanted to take me there. �Mina is scheduled to be there next month�perhaps we might take a family trip there to meet and surprise her. Wouldn&#8217;t that be lovely, Emily?�

�Oh, yes, sir,� I said. �She would love it.� And so will I. My husband has successfully distracted me again, and now I am looking forward to the trip so much. I have not traveled abroad in such a long time, and my husband added that, now that our little ones are getting older (I cannot believe that young Beatrice is now seven, and dear little Charlotte will turn seven later this summer!), it will be time for us to travel again, and bring them along. 

My time with Alice is over, though she will always be my dearest friend. But my adventures with my dear husband continue, and I know that we will have fun and excitement for the rest of our days. My husband will continue to give me everything that I want, and everything that he knows I need. The dear man! At the worst of times, I am most grateful to have him, and I know that it will always be so!











Mr. Singer

I was taking a leisurely stroll down a busy street in London. It was a late summer afternoon, and though the talk of war with Germany had been increasing over the past months, everyone on the streets that afternoon was carefree, enjoying a lovely Sunday. I had just come from a meeting with my son-in-law, my late Charlotte&#8217;s husband, always an exhausting affair. 

I had approved of Geoffrey Winslow when he had come to Wainwright Hall to ask Emily and me for Charlotte&#8217;s hand in marriage. He had been a young, lower-ranking government official at the time, but he came from a wealthy family, and he had many prospects. Though Charlotte was barely 18, Emily had given her consent, and I always left such matters to her. Besides, I knew that our Charlotte, my favorite child, would be in good hands, and she truly seemed to love him. Her sister and lifelong competitor, Beatrice, married an extremely wealthy and spoiled young man only months later.

Though I had initially approved of, and even liked, Geoffrey Winslow, I had grown to dislike him as the years passed, and even more so after my dear Charlotte&#8217;s passing. The steady loss of his family&#8217;s fortune, through poor investments and the negligent spending of Winslow&#8217;s sisters and in-laws, was only one reason for his ill manners. He had called upon me at my townhouse, on the pretense of a friendly visit, but of course, talk had turned to the will. The will, the damned inheritance�I had been saying the same thing to my impatient in-laws for the past decade. �Lady Emily decided all of those matters prior to her death. She arranged that her fortune be split evenly between all of her successors. My fortune is pooled with hers; the details will be given by the executor of our estate upon my death. And, as I do not intend to die for some time yet, let us put this tedious subject aside.� 

It angered me to no end that Lady Emily&#8217;s judgment should be questioned, even posthumously. I had been quite impressed with the way she&#8217;d handled finances for Mrs. Morrison&#8217;s whorehouse, and had allowed her to take over our personal finances herself. She had decided the matter of the estate as fairly as she could, and had included all of the children and grandchildren (even Beatrice and her three, though they were not technically her family by blood). What more did those people want? 

And so, annoyed at the conversation, I had set out for a relaxing walk to ease my nerves. I still walk about easily, with the assistance of a cane, even at my age. Well into my 80s, I&#8217;m always mistaken for a man at least 20 years younger. I might attribute my graceful aging to the activities that I&#8217;d always found such pleasure in, for I had been active right up until Mrs. Shelton&#8217;s death (not quite a year past by that summer afternoon). Yes, in the end she had been my only one, and while I sometimes still loved her, I would often grow resentful that she, and not Emily, were still with me, after so long. Emily had gone too soon, and even after a decade, I felt the sharp sting of her loss. Mrs. Shelton&#8217;s presence had been some comfort to me, I suppose, because after her death, I was lonelier than I&#8217;d ever been.

That afternoon, I walked along a busy shopping district. I noticed a pretty young woman, her curvy hips and ass visible under her form-fitting dress, wearing a wide-brimmed, fancy hat as she examined the contents of a department store window. I stopped and held my breath in anticipation, and the girl finally looked in my direction. It was she, certainly. Sweet little Emily, 18-years-old, window-shopping on the streets of London.

I smiled and approached her as she recognized me. �Why, it&#8217;s my dear old Papa!� she declared, and she stepped into my embrace, kissing my withered old cheek.

�I just met with your father, not an hour ago,� I said. �He did not mention that you were in London.�

�I am visiting with a friend before I go to Cambridge,� she admitted. Young Emily, the namesake of her grandmother, would be starting her first year at school. Her cousin and lifelong competitor, Monica Almond (daughter of Beatrice and her late husband), only several months older, was starting her first year at Oxford. Their rivalry was certainly like that of their mothers&#8217;, and it seemed to me that Monica, sensing that her cousin bested her in nearly every way, perpetuated much of the competition. 

I noted that young Emily&#8217;s cheeks were flushed; she was hiding something. �Your father does not know that you are in town?� She shook her head. Young Emily did not have a very good relationship with her overbearing father. When she was a child, especially after the death of her mother, she loved to spend her summers and holidays with me at Wainwright Hall. Though her two younger brothers, Edwin and Edgar, got on well with their father, young Emily had a much closer relationship with me. And because she was the exact image of her late grandmother, I favored her openly.

I did not question Emily deceiving her father, for I&#8217;ve always understood the nature of their relationship. She respects him, though now that she is a young woman, she does not feel that it is necessary to inform him of her every move. She added, �Papa, I rather thought you&#8217;d be in the country. I certainly would have called on you by now had I known you were about.�

�No matter, my dear. I have not yet had my lunch; would you care to let me treat you?� Young Emily took my proffered arm, and we strolled together to a nearby hotel. We had a leisurely lunch, and as she chattered on about how excited she was to begin school, I could still tell that she was hiding something, even from her dear old Papa. But it would be several months before I would learn all.

I only stayed in London until the middle of October. Many were in a panic over the possibility of the Kaiser&#8217;s �zeppelin raids,� and so, more to appease my family than for my own personal safety, I retreated back to Wainwright Hall. Though I had not stayed there much since the death of my wife, I still had not allowed Avery and his family to move in. Avery is the rightful heir to the Wainwright title and estate, and these will go to him upon my death. But until that day, I cannot bear to think of his brash wife and their two bratty daughters reigning over Lady Emily&#8217;s peaceful home. My son&#8217;s resemblance to me ends with his looks, as he allows his wife to walk all over him. I have given up trying to advise him on that front, but I can see that he is most unhappy.

Of all my children, Mina seemed to marry most happily. My eldest is like me in many ways. She is also the dominant one in her relationship. She is married to a modest but well-educated businessman named Thomas Reinhold, whom I have always genuinely liked. He makes my Mina very happy, and together they had four healthy children, three big young men and one tiny girl. My wife, to whom the children spoke more openly about their sexual encounters, revealed to me that Mina was her husband&#8217;s mistress, and that he happily served her as she&#8217;d always served me. Emily had been so proud of Mina.

Eleven living grandchildren (for Edwin had died the previous year of an illness, and I suspect it to be the same that struck down his Uncle Peter and great-grandfather), and three living children, yet none of them came to see me in the months that I lived at Wainwright Hall alone. Mina and two of her boys came briefly for Christmas, only staying a couple of days. As I spent my New Year alone, wearing my housecoat as I drank watered down whiskey in my old study, I thought of the Christmases of years past, when my Emily was living. She especially enjoyed the holidays with the younger children, and the grandchildren who were born when she was still living, and she always made the holidays special for everyone. Christmas at Wainwright Hall had been a family tradition, but it had ended abruptly after Emily and Charlotte&#8217;s deaths.

Mother and daughter had died only a few months apart. Emily had been sick with a lung infection for months before her death. She had been steadily weakening during all that time, but until she was on her deathbed, coughing so hard that it broke my heart, I did not allow myself to believe that she would die. As I sat beside her, comforting her after her coughing fit, she&#8217;d smiled weakly at me, her eyes bleary. �Poor sir,� she said softly.

I laughed humorlessly at that. �Poor me!� I cried. 

She nodded, taking my hand and settling back on her pillows. �Very soon, sir, I will have nothing left to worry about,� she said. �But I will be leaving you behind. I&#8217;m sorry.� The tears in her eyes now were not just brought on by the intensity of her coughing.

�Don&#8217;t talk that way,� I said. �It&#8217;s not supposed to be that way, my Emily. I&#8217;m supposed to be the one leaving you behind.�

�Oh, I wouldn&#8217;t be able to bear it!� she cried. She squeezed my hand as hard as she could (no more than a gentle squeeze, so weak she was). �That&#8217;s why I must go first, sir. I could not be without you. But you��

�No, Emily, I need you,� I insisted. But I realized that I was only distressing her. So I tried to comfort her, as best I could. She died a few days later, calm and happy, a little smile on her lips. I was the only one at her side. I knew that my wife did not die with any regrets, and as glad as I was of that, I still wished that I could have gone first.

Only months after Emily&#8217;s death, poor Charlotte succumbed to an illness. Her husband sent her to a hospital in London, but it was too late; she died quite suddenly, leaving behind three little children. In keeping my promise to Emily to take care of all of our descendents, I took an especial interest in Charlotte&#8217;s poor children, seeing to their care and education. Their father was not exactly negligent, but he was not a very warm person, not the sort of loving man that I would have wanted my Charlotte to be with.

But there had been many happy times amongst our family. While in London, I could keep close contact with Mina and most of her children, and the Winslows. Beatrice Almond lived in her late husband&#8217;s estate in the country, hosting many male callers (taking after her Auntie Ana for certain), but she made her way to London frequently. She is a lazy socialite, enjoying her money and her lovers. But she is happy, and I am certain that Lady Emily would be glad to see it. I saw much of my family in London, and back at Wainwright Hall, I felt very much cut off, though I received frequent letters from young Beatrice, and Mina and her two eldest sons, Byron and Stephen, and young Emily. My favorite granddaughter&#8217;s letters talked of her studies, the friends she&#8217;d made in school, and made inquiries about my health and well-being. She wrote that she regretted not being able to come for Christmas, but she had a prior engagement in London. 

Young Emily&#8217;s secret was revealed early that spring. It started with a trip that I made to London. Going stir-crazy after a lonely and inactive winter, I spent a fortnight in the city. Winslow came to see me during that time, and it took nearly an hour of enduring his boring stories about his work in the government before he got to his true purpose. He hated to ask for money, though I&#8217;d never denied it to any of the children or grandchildren who asked. There was more than enough to go around; my smart investments and Emily&#8217;s careful planning had seen to that. Still, my son-in-law is a prideful man, and his face turned red with indignation as he revealed the truth about his debts. He was not entirely responsible with his money, but he was no cad, and without putting too much of a point on it, I offered up the money.

Still glowing, Winslow snarled, �Goodness knows all the money I&#8217;ve given to Cambridge has been a waste!�

�I beg your pardon?�

Winslow sighed. �I received word that Emily&#8217;s grades have plummeted this term. Nearly failing all of her courses�she almost managed straight A&#8217;s last term! I could bash that foolish little ninny.�

I frowned to hear such violent talk directed at my sweet young Emily, but I was distressed to hear the news. �What was her behavior, her mood, during her winter holidays?�

�I&#8217;d have no way of knowing that,� Winslow spat in annoyance. �I haven&#8217;t seen her since this past summer.�

I was shocked. �She told me that she spent her holiday in London.�

Winslow gave me a helpless look. �If she did, I knew nothing of it. Her communication with me has been minimal.� We did not delve into the topic of their suffering relationship, though I had to wonder why it only now seemed to be bothering him. Perhaps his remorse had been triggered by the loss of Edwin. But I shared his anxiety; what was happening with young Emily, that she would feel the need to lie to and deceive her family?

I waited until my return to Wainwright Hall before contacting her. I revealed that I knew of her troubles at school, and, motivated more than a little by my loneliness, I prompted her to take time off and come see me. I mentioned that I had been lacking in visitors, to stir her conscience. Be a good girl and come pay your Papa a visit, I&#8217;d written. Your presence would be such a comfort to me. A week later, she was at my doorstep.

When I invited her to stay with me at Wainwright Hall, I had fantasized about our becoming lovers. After all, she was so young and pretty, a little replica of my dear late wife. And this pretty young woman was not really my blood relation. But I had not imagined that it would really be so. Still, old man that I am, it seems that I have not lost my charms. The poor girl had also inherited her grandmother&#8217;s bouts of insomnia, and I noticed in the first week (as she stayed in her grandmother&#8217;s childhood room) that she was restless in the night. I am often awoken in the night by my various little aches and pains, particularly the ones in my hands. Since my wife&#8217;s death, my arthritis has become more burdensome, to the point where I can hardly tie or tighten any knots�quite inconvenient when it came to my sexual activities with the widowed Mrs. Shelton.

Awake one night, I found that I had forgotten my jar of pills in the parlor. I would not attribute this to oncoming senility, simply a moment of forgetfulness to which we are all prone. I put on my housecoat, took up my cane, and made my way down the hall. The idea of an extra trip up and downs the stairs made my knees ache, but I knew I would not sleep again without the aid of my medicine.

As I passed young Emily&#8217;s bedchamber, I noticed the light shining beneath the heavy door. I stopped and listened a moment�certainly the poor girl wasn&#8217;t crying into her pillow? My hearing has not failed me much, and I knocked lightly. The dear girl did not hesitate in answering, having pulled on her own housecoat, and was still wiping away tears as she smiled sadly.

�I&#8217;m sorry, Papa, have I wakened you?� she asked.

�No, dear. The walls and doors are thick,� I said kindly, to hide the fact that I knew she&#8217;d been up crying for the past few nights. �What is the matter, darling?�

�Oh, Papa,� she sighed in despair, and stepped into my welcoming arms. She cried quietly against me for a moment, and as I stroked her hair, I had my own Emily back in my arms, my darling, the love of my life, my universe. 

But I came back to myself, and I comforted my beloved granddaughter. �It&#8217;s all right, Emily. Come now, love, I was going downstairs to retrieve my pills. Why don&#8217;t we sit in the parlor and have tea.�

The generous little dear was mindful of my knees, and she suggested, �Why don&#8217;t I get your medicine and the tea, Papa?�

I agreed, and went to wait for her in my own bedchamber. My intentions were not so scandalous, not yet. I merely intended to sit with her in the chairs before the fire, and have a long talk. I thought that the girl was distressed about her schooling, and I decided to find out what had happened at Cambridge. I did imagine that it could have something to do with a young man, a boyfriend, perhaps�I just did not imagine how tragic it was. 

When young Emily returned, she poured the tea and dutifully brought me my pills with a glass of water. �Thank you, angel,� I said affectionately. She knelt and I touched her face gently. �Sit and tell your papa what is troubling you.�

She sighed deeply as took the armchair beside mine. She took a slow sip of her tea before she began her story. �Papa,� she said, �When you came upon me in London last summer, I�well, I was there in London to get married.�

�Married?� I cried in surprise. 

Emily nodded. �I didn&#8217;t tell anyone about it.� She told me about how she had met Dr. Tristan McElder during her last year of boarding school. She had been on a break with some schoolmates in London, and had been attending lectures there. She and Dr. McElder crossed paths, and she had been smitten by his calm charm and patient ways, very unlike her father. �He reminded me in some ways of you, Papa,� she admitted, flushing brightly. 

Dr. McElder was several years her senior. They wrote each other regularly while she was still in school, and upon her graduation, they began courting while she stayed in London with her father. Winslow never met Dr. McElder, as Emily knew that her overprotective father would not approve of the relationship. �He was so much older,� she said. �Also, his family isn&#8217;t very well established��

�That snob,� I said in disgust. What would the high and mighty Winslow say if he knew that his late wife was a bastard? But I wanted her to continue her story. �What happened, Emily? Where is your husband now?�

Emily&#8217;s eyes filled with tears again. �He&#8217;s dead, Papa,� she said. She explained that before they had met, he was enlisted as a medic in the armed forces. They had decided to marry before he went to France. While he worked at a field hospital, they had written back and forth for several months. They&#8217;d even gotten to spend Christmas together in Paris. �It was the best time of my life,� she said, her tears flowing freely as she continued. �I loved Tristan so much, Papa.� 

Not three weeks after they parted and she returned to school did she receive word of her husband&#8217;s death. He had died when their base was bombed. His body had been found, so there had been no hope that he was missing in action; he had been buried somewhere in France. 

Poor widowed Emily, distraught, had given up on school and withdrawn. Only two months later, she was still in grief. Wanting to comfort her, I asked her questions about her late husband. Upon my questioning, Young Emily&#8217;s face brightened a little. �Oh, you would have liked him, Papa, I know you would have. I so wish you could have met him!�

�I do, too, darling,� I said with a smile. And she went on to describe her lost love&#8217;s qualities, and while they were undoubtedly and forevermore enhanced in her mind by his early death, he sounded like a suitable young man, just the sort of man I would want my favorite granddaughter to marry. 

After a time, our topic of conversation turned to the late Lady Emily herself. �Papa,� young Emily asked timidly, �Is it true that I am not really your granddaughter?�

Charlotte had passed when the girl was still quite young, so I doubted that she&#8217;d ever had the chance to share our family history with her. Lady Emily and I had eventually discussed the matter with our three youngest children, so it was not exactly a family secret. Still, I could not think of how the girl would know this. �Where is that coming from, angel?� I asked carefully.

�It is something that Monica wrote, in a letter that she sent to me before I came here,� she confessed. I was both annoyed and amused at this. Undoubtedly, she was triumphant in her cousin&#8217;s failure in school, as she (according to her mother&#8217;s gushing letters to me) was excelling at Oxford.

�What did spiteful Monica say?� I asked. 

�It was terribly cruel, Papa,� young Emily said. �She mocked me for coming to stay with you. She said that I was trying to worm my way into the inheritance, or some such nonsense, and that I didn&#8217;t deserve anything anyway, nor my brother, because we are not your relations.� The poor thing was distressed again.

I smiled warmly. �Oh, my dear child,� I said kindly. �Don&#8217;t you listen to a word that your cousin Monica says. She is envious of you. She always has been.� I thought of Monica&#8217;s real grandmother&#8217;s jealousy of her adopted grandmother�so intense had her jealousy been that she&#8217;d betrayed the very people who loved and cared for her. Was Monica capable of such treachery herself? I could not doubt it.

�It is not true, then?� 

I sighed, and tried to explain to her the complicated truth. �I&#8217;m sorry to have kept this from you,� I said. �I had always thought that your mother would tell you all about it. And after she was gone��

Emily smiled at me. �Don&#8217;t be sorry, Papa,� she said. �So that means that Monica and Lucy and Timothy are not Lady Emily&#8217;s grandchildren?�

�Not by blood,� I said. �But Emily, your grandmother loved them as much as she loved you, and your brothers, and the rest of your cousins. And I love you as well. We are all family. Your grandmother wanted it to be that way.�

�She was such a good woman, wasn&#8217;t she, Papa?�

I sighed. �What I wouldn&#8217;t give for you to have known her better. She had the biggest heart. But angel, you remind me so much of her.� Young Emily flushed with pleasure. 

�She used to tell me that,� young Emily said. �She called me her little doppelganger.�

I was inspired by a sudden idea. My medicine doing its job, I was able to stand more easily. �Let me show you something,� I said. I led a curious young Emily to the spare, unused bedroom, where the naughty portrait of Lady Emily, painted by young Emily&#8217;s true grandfather, still hung proudly. When I turned on the lights to show her, she gasped. Not so much in shock at the nudity of her grandmother, but in surprise at how much she resembled her. �Papa, it&#8217;s like looking in a mirror,� she exclaimed, and when I looked up at the portrait again, I saw more than ever how right she was. It really was my sweet, lovely Emily standing before me. I smiled at my granddaughter�who was not really my granddaughter�

�I loved Lady Emily very much,� I said softly, and those words were most inadequate in describing my feelings. It was then that I had the idea, that the young woman in my possession, my little Emily reincarnate, could be my lover, that she could fill that void in my heart for the rest of my days. 

Perhaps she read my mind, for she held my hand and walked with me back to my bedchamber. Once there, I sat and she knelt at my feet, resting her head on my knee. �Papa, tell me about how you raised Lady Emily yourself,� she said softly. And though that story, the simplest version, was well-known in the family, I confessed to her how I had raped her grandmother, how I had made her my love slave. I began to tell her everything. As I spoke, she kept her head on my knee, looking up at me with such a familiar, adoring look. I would take a break in my storytelling to reach down and touch her face tenderly. 

Near dawn, we were both too tired to talk anymore. I did not ask young Emily to stay with me, but she removed her housecoat and helped me into bed while wearing only her white silk slip. She climbed in beside me and I held her. That&#8217;s all we did that first time in bed together.

But the following night, I claimed her. I presented her with the box of Lady Emily&#8217;s personal documents, and she read the diary entries and letters with interest, often blushing and giggling at the lewd descriptions. As young Emily sat on the floor in front of the fire in my office, I sat on the couch and watched her, with an ignored book in my lap, pleased with her reactions. 

Young Emily looked up at me once. �Papa,� she proclaimed, �I cannot believe how wild you and Lady Emily were!�

I laughed heartily. �We certainly had fun together, my dear. And all those &#8216;naughty&#8217; things�that&#8217;s what made our marriage so happy, for all those years.�

Young Emily also read of Mrs. Gainsley&#8217;s betrayal. �So Mrs. Gainsley�Beatrice�she is my Auntie Beatrice&#8217;s mother?�

�Yes,� I said patiently. �But remember, my darling, you agreed that what we discuss here is between the two of us.�

�Yes, Papa,� Emily agreed readily. �I would not think to rub this in Monica&#8217;s face.�

�I certainly would think not.� Young Emily came and sat beside me on the couch. �That was a very dark time for our family. But it&#8217;s reminded me that everything happens for a reason. It&#8217;s really so. For if we had not been separated, we may not have had your Auntie Beatrice�and we certainly would not have had your mother.�

Young Emily was intrigued by the whole story, and she promised again to keep it to herself. When she had stopped her reading, and carefully put Lady Emily&#8217;s papers back into their box, she sat beside me again. I asked her frankly, �So, my dear, what did you think of all those stories? Of all the things that your grandmother and I did together?�

Again, she flushed (so pretty!). She didn&#8217;t seem to know what to say. I smiled at her encouragingly. Just as I&#8217;d always done with her grandmother, I allowed her to take her time to collect her thoughts. Finally, she whispered, �I feel curious, Papa. I wonder�� She had not the words to finish the thought; she flushed more deeply.

I assumed a stern expression. �Emily,� I said in a serious tone, �You know that you have been a bad girl, don&#8217;t you?�

She gave me a puzzled look. �What do you mean, Papa?�

�You were dishonest,� I said, and though I spoke the truth, I still had to stop myself from smiling. �You lied to your family, and caused your father to worry.� Her face flushed, this time in mortification, as I continued. �I was quite worried as well.�

�But, Papa��

�Do not interrupt me,� I snapped. Her eyes wide with both fear and curiosity, she slid off of the couch and knelt at my feet. I seized her chin and looked into her eyes. �I was quite worried,� I repeated in a gentler tone. �You should not cause your old Papa to worry in such a way. It is bad for my heart.�

�I&#8217;m sorry, Papa.�

�I know,� I said, and I did allow myself to smile then, for her remorseful look reminded me so of Emily, in the rare moments when she would be chastised as a child for some small infraction. �I always thought you were just like Lady Emily, but I do not think she would have ever lied to me the way that you have.�

Though tears streamed down her face, she seemed to understand my intentions, and she almost smiled a little. �Must I be punished for it, Papa?�

�Certainly you must,� I said, �If you want atonement.�

�I do, Papa.� She was trembling, and I wondered if she would enjoy it as much as her grandmother had, if she were really that much like her.

�Emily,� I asked, �Do you wish for me to punish you properly?� Her permission was necessary. Though she resembled my own Emily so much, I could not be so certain about her willingness as I had been about my bride&#8217;s. My darling Emily�she had always been mine, and we had both known it.&nbsp; But I could not take her granddaughter entirely by force; I had to hear her say it.

�Yes, Papa,� she whispered, giving me a gaze that was both lustful and imploring. �Will you please punish me, the way that you used to punish Lady Emily?�

It was with some difficulty that I knelt down, slowly, and kissed her trembling lips. Soft little rosebud lips, just like my wife&#8217;s. My wife�Emily crawled up onto my lap, not resting too much of her weight on my fragile knees. I seized her little wrists and kissed her again, and as I trailed kisses down her neck, I heard her whimpering softly. Her little murmurs and moans�oh, Emily�

It should come as no surprise that, as an old man, my virility was not what it once was. Still, I already felt my cock stirring as I asked young Emily to undress. She removed her skirt and blouse, and I watched the sway of her little breasts and her wide hips as she peeled off her stockings. She gave me a teasing look as she wiggled a little for my benefit, giggling as I gave her an approving smile.

�Papa?� Young Emily stepped between my spread thighs, allowing me to put my withered hands on her tender skin. �Do I really remind you very much of Lady Emily?�

�Oh, yes, my child,� I murmured, as I began to grope her sweet little tits. Oh, God, so much like Emily&#8217;s before she was first pregnant! A sudden thought made me smile; the only thing that could have made that moment any more spectacular was if my young Emily were pregnant. Even with her late husband&#8217;s baby, for I knew that I could enjoy my fine pregnant bitch, regardless of who sired the child.

�You could pretend,� young Emily whispered. �You can pretend that I&#8217;m Lady Emily.�

I ran my hands down her sides and seized her hips, drawing her crotch to mine. I looked into her eyes, my own Emily&#8217;s same grey-green eyes, but I knew I could not pretend. I told her this. �I want you because you do remind me of her,� I confessed. �But I will not pretend. You are you�and I do want you, my sweet young Emily.� She flushed and I touched her face, kissing her again.

�I only want you to feel good, Papa. You deserve it,� she said sweetly.

�It would make me feel very good to give you the punishment that you&#8217;ve earned,� I said, and she flushed more deeply. �I think it will make you feel good, too, my dear.�

She nodded, and I had her go to one of the armchairs and bend over one of the arms. This was a familiar position for my own Emily. As I retrieved the familiar ropes and tied her up, I felt a renewed surge of energy, such as I hadn&#8217;t felt in years. And perhaps I was able to pretend, a little, as I touched young Emily&#8217;s unmarred back, thinking back to many many years ago, when my wife&#8217;s back was still a smooth white canvas. Perhaps I could pretend a little when I shoved a handkerchief into her sweet mouth, and beat her with a paddle. 

Her pretty back and ass was a lovely shade of red, and burned to the touch when I stopped to stroke her. Young Emily cried, whimpering a little, shedding some tears. It was enough for the first punishment; if she would allow me, I would find ways to make her howl in delightful pain. I imagined having the chance to relive my own Emily&#8217;s first ass-whipping, in the horse stables�

My dear young Emily was very surprised when I offered to fuck her in her ass for the first time. Had she refused, I might have raped her; she was in no position to refuse me, with her arms and legs all bound to the legs of the chair, her tits pressed against the seat of the chair as her ass stuck up deliciously. But I wouldn&#8217;t do that, not to dear young Emily. I asked her if her precious doctor had ever fucked her in her ass, and she shook her head. I merely asked, �May I?&#8217; For a moment, she made no sound. I waited patiently, and she slowly nodded. �Are you sure?� Another nod. �Very well, Emily. You know how much your grandmother enjoyed being sodomized; perhaps you will as well.�

I grinned to myself, my heart pounding and my old cock throbbing. I was ready for her, at last, but she wasn&#8217;t quite ready for me. My cock in one hand, I stuck two fingers of my other hand into my mouth before shoving them into young Emily&#8217;s waiting asshole. She was impossibly tight, and I knew that, if I were to fuck her ass properly, I would not be able to be gentle. I smiled as she moaned and wriggled a bit.

�Hold still, my little slut,� I instructed her, slapping her ass cheek once. Though her ass was already raw, I could see the faint outline of my handprint. �Now, relax your asshole for Papa, that&#8217;s a good girl.� 

I lubed up for her, as I&#8217;d never failed to do for my own Emily. I took her by the hips and prepared to thrust into her, stopping only to briefly finger her cunt. Very, very wet, and when I drew my fingers away and stuck them in my mouth, I was pleasantly surprised at the taste. She almost tasted just as my own Emily had, she almost had that same tangy sweetness, almost�

I murmured my approval, so that she could hear me. �You are delicious, my sweet little girl.� I stroked her curved backside lovingly. �Do you understand, Emily, that you&#8217;re giving your Papa a very loving gift? You are an angel to do so much to make this old man happy. Thank you, darling.�

Emily nodded slightly, and I felt her tremble in anticipation as I took her by the hips again. �Now, relax for Papa again, Emily, that&#8217;s right�� I shoved into her, knowing that to go slowly would only prolong her pain. She screamed into the handkerchief gag, but I stayed inside of her until I felt her relax. I fingered her cunt again as I continued thrusting, first going at a moderate pace, as mindful of my heart rate as I was of the lining of her asshole. Ah, but I pushed the both of us, and as I pounded into her, I closed my eyes, and could see myself fucking my own Emily&#8217;s virgin asshole, as she knelt before me on my bed, the bed that had belonged to her own parents, the bed that she and I would share for so many years�

As I liked to do with my own Emily, I thrust as deep into the girl&#8217;s ass as I could whilst coming, filling her with a substantial load, though a fraction of the seed that I used to leave deep inside my wife. I had gotten into a nasty habit of comparing my old self with my younger self, and being with young Emily didn&#8217;t help that matter. Though she could sometimes make me feel as though I were young again, there were too many reminders to the contrary.

Still, I felt thoroughly satisfied after having my young not-granddaughter. I was highly amused when, after slowly drawing myself from her, she farted loudly and voided, liquid shit running down her thighs. She whimpered and sobbed, humiliated, and I laughed softly and left her tied while I cleaned her lovingly with a wet towel.

�Poor Emily,� I laughed, rubbing her cleaned thighs and calves. �Poor little darling, it&#8217;s all right. You know that your grandmother had her share of humiliations following ass play.� I cleaned her ass crack and hole thoroughly, and teased her. �You are Papa&#8217;s dirty little bitch, aren&#8217;t you?�

Young Emily nodded weakly, giggling a little into the handkerchief, and I finally untied her. She was trembling as she stood, and my aches and pains were beginning to return, so we sat together for a while, just as I used to hold my own Emily in my arms after playing with her. I did not realize that I was crying a little as I kissed the girl&#8217;s neck, until she gently brushed away my tears.

�Thank you, my dear,� I said, and she kissed me briefly on the lips.

�You&#8217;re welcome, Papa,� she said. 

�So, what did you think, Emily?� I asked.

�Well, I think I did enjoy the punishment,� she said, flushing but a little, the same sweet way that my own Emily would blush for me. �I do not know about having my ass�� Her flush deepened.

I smiled patiently. �That&#8217;s quite all right, my dear. Not every woman takes to it.�

�Perhaps we might try again sometime?�

I gave her a questioning look. �Does this mean that you want to continue playing with me, Emily?�

�Of course, Papa,� Emily said, kissing me briefly again. �I&#8217;ll stay with you for the rest of your life�if you&#8217;ll have me.�

I held the dear girl close. �I love you very much, Emily.�

�I love you, too, Papa.�

�Shall we to bed, my love?�

Young Emily remembered to get my pills, and we went together to my bedchamber. She stayed with me again in my marriage bed, though we played no more that night. In my younger days, I would have had her again and again, all night. But I was spent, and after taking my medicine, I slept quite peacefully with the soft, warm young Emily in my arms. My dreams were very, very sweet that night.


Over the next few weeks, I would sometimes feel, upon waking, that I had died and was in heaven. What else could explain the presence of the angel in my bed, my sweet Emily, as she looked when I first made love to her, when I first made her my bride? But, coming to myself, I would remember the truth of my circumstances. I knew that I was quite fortunate.

Though young Emily expressed willingness in playing with me, I did not push her limits. The harshest punishment that I gave to her was the imagined beating in the horse stables, though I found it to be less enjoyable without any horses to watch us, nor any for her to ride naked upon afterward. Still, I enjoyed walking with my young Emily on the grounds of Wainwright Hall, or in the lovely garden, and laying her down on the grass to fuck her sweet young body. And when she would bite her lip, and tilt her head back and moan�she was my own Emily, for a short moment of ecstasy. 

Having the girl in my home, and in my bed, reinvigorated me for a short time. But I found it difficult to keep up with her, and she was ever so playful, as my Emily had been, patting my crouch encouragingly when she wanted attention. She was patient with my old body, more patient than I myself could be, but by the beginning of summer, I was worn out. Receiving a letter from Winslow one morning (in which he inquired about his daughter, revealing that she had not written him directly herself), I was inspired with an idea.

Emily came to me while I sat in my old office. She looked especially fresh and youthful that day, wearing a light summer dress that fit quite well around her pert tits and shapely hips. She smiled warmly at me. �Good morning, Papa.�

She came to me and kissed me softly, and I resisted the urge to pull her onto my lap. She was so bright and pretty, and I knew that I truly loved her. So I knew that I did what was right when I told her about her father&#8217;s inquiry. �He is worried about you,� I said.

�But you will write to him and tell him that I&#8217;m quite well, won&#8217;t you?� Emily asked, perching on the corner of my desk.

�Don&#8217;t you think it would be better if you informed him yourself?� I asked gently. �Or better yet, Emily, don&#8217;t you think you should go and see your father?�

Young Emily bit her lip apprehensively. �I don&#8217;t know��

�Darling,� I said, �I must say, if one of my children wouldn&#8217;t speak to me, or write to me at all, it would break my heart. Don&#8217;t you think that you&#8217;re hurting your father?�

�He doesn&#8217;t care.�

�Of course he does,� I insisted. �No, your father is not a warm man, and he does not easily express his love. I know that you&#8217;ve always needed that from him. But he does love you, and you must never doubt this, Emily. He misses you.�

The poor little dear began to cry. �I don&#8217;t want to hurt him��

�Think of Lady Emily,� I urged her. �The poor thing was an orphan when she was but four years old. If she&#8217;d ever had a chance to know either of her parents, or to even just see them and speak to them one time, she would have given anything for it. She never had that chance, Emily. You lost your mother, but you still have him. Please, for my sake, and in the memory of Lady Emily and your dear mother, will you go to your father and make amends?�

I have rarely ever failed in getting someone to do what I wish, and I was most successful in convincing my young Emily to go to London, the very next day. I had one more night with her, and I made the most of it. I had found that I liked to hear her call out for me, �Oh, Papa!�, while I fucked her in ways that would have made her dearly departed doctor turn crimson. There was no denying that I was a dirty old man.

Young Emily was to be away a fortnight, but I was never to see her again. I perhaps felt this, as I kissed her on the cheek at the train station, having gathered up my strength to see her off myself. She noticed the troubled look in my eyes as she placed a soft, gentle hand on my withered cheek. �Are you all right, Papa? You look so tired.�

�I am, my dearest. You&#8217;ve worn out your poor old man.�

She giggled a little and grinned. �Get plenty of rest, Papa. I will come back to you.� I forced a smile as I watched her board the train. But my melancholy was forgotten as I rode back to Wainwright Hall in the back of my new car. I actually looked forward to some solitary time. Perhaps I would read through my wife&#8217;s diary again, as I had not gone through it myself since right after her death�

I was not even given enough time to become lonely. Only two days after seeing young Emily off, a guest arrived at Wainwright Hall. I was in my office, reading (though not my wife&#8217;s private diary), when the young maid came in and announced that Contessa Garzelli had arrived. I smiled and stood, with a little difficulty, as a lovely middle-aged woman entered my office. She wore a very flattering traveling suit, in the latest fashion, and the dark hair under her hat had only a touch of grey. Her blue eyes sparkled, a little mischievously, as I came to greet her.

�My dear Alice,� I declared. �You look quite well.�

I took her offered hand and kissed it gallantly. She kissed my cheek. �I am sorry to drop in on you without warning, Mr. Singer.�

�It is a pleasant surprise,� I said, and it was certainly true. I had seen Alice only briefly the previous year, following her beloved sister-in-law&#8217;s funeral. I was always glad to see Alice, for I could never forget how much love my own Emily had had for her, and I knew that it would have pleased my wife that we maintained our friendship after her passing. I bade my guest to sit, and I poured drinks for us.

�My husband and I happened to be in London, and I called on my favorite little great-niece,� Alice revealed. She shared my affection for young Emily. Though she had lived abroad in Italy most of the girl&#8217;s life, she always made it a point to keep in touch with her. She had been close to Charlotte in the same way, for Alice had never had children of her own. I had boldly asked her once if she regretted it, not having her own children. She had responded, �I know how much motherhood has brought joy to Mrs. Singer, and to my dear Tatiana, but�I am content, Mr. Singer. Besides,� she had admitted with a smile, �I have gotten used to being a pampered, spoiled baby of the family, and my husband likes to treat me the same way.�

She&#8217;d been referring to her second husband, Conte Garzelli, whom she had met only a few months after the death of her first husband, Thurston Mangrich. I knew a little of the story of how she&#8217;d met the Conte whilst abroad, for my own Emily had been the one to introduce them. But I would learn more, much more, of the events surrounding that story soon enough�

Bringing Alice her drink, I said, �Your timing is excellent. Young Emily had been staying here with me, but is now in London seeing her father.�

�Yes,� Alice said. �She told me all about it.�

I eyed her carefully as we both sipped our drinks. She still had the mischievous look in her eyes. �All?� I finally asked with a little smile.

�Yes, you dirty all man. All.�

I laughed aloud. �Well, can you blame me?�

�Oh, Mr. Singer,� Alice sighed, smiling even as she reproached me. �What do you think your wife would say to it?�

�I would daresay she&#8217;d be quite flattered,� I said, her words affecting me but a little. �It is for her resemblance to my wife that I want the girl. I&#8217;ve always favored her for it, as have you, Contessa. And young Emily knows it well.�

Alice nodded, but her face looked suddenly grave. �She adores you, Mr. Singer, but�I am concerned. For both of you, for you know that I have always cared for you very much.� I nodded as she continued, �I think that the girl is confused about the whole situation. She loves you and wants to please you, for certain, but��

I sighed, my heart sinking. �She does not want to come back to me.�

�She is eager to return to you,� Alice insisted. 

�Has she made up with her father?� I asked.

Alice smiled at that. �They&#8217;re both trying at it. I spoke with Geoffrey briefly. He is still an insufferable bore, but he loves his child.� Her eyes brimmed with tears, for poor young Edwin, and I realized that the best place for young Emily was in her father&#8217;s home. When I admitted this to Alice, she said, �I advised the girl not to plan on coming back to you any time soon. I believe you will thank me for it, once I&#8217;ve shared with you my real reason for coming.�

I was intrigued as Alice took up her small traveling bag and took out a small notebook. She handed it over to me without a word, and nodded for me open it. As soon as my eyes swept across the first page, my heart leapt. It was my own Emily&#8217;s handwriting! 

I gave Alice a questioning look, holding the book in my trembling, arthritic fingers as she explained. �Mrs. Singer kept that diary during our trip abroad, when she and Tatiana came out to meet me at the health spa in Italy. Do you remember that, Mr. Singer?�

I nodded. She&#8217;d taken that trip with Tatiana only a few years before her death. She had returned from her month abroad in high spirits, though she had missed me, and Wainwright Hall, terribly. I thought that the trip would be good for her, as we had just sent Avery, our youngest, to university the previous fall, and she&#8217;d been as a mother hen without her little chicks for months, at times more melancholy than I&#8217;d ever seen her.

�There were some events that occurred on this trip that Mrs. Singer wished to keep secret from you,� Alice said frankly. �She recorded them in this diary, and had resolved to give it to you upon her return, and to tell you all. But she found that she could not do it, and at the last moment, left the diary with me. Before she died, she sent me a letter, asking me to give this to you sometime��

�And you waited 10 years?� I asked in disbelief. In my younger days, I would have raged. But as an old man, I was not so quick to anger. I merely shook my head. �What sort of events?� I asked weakly.

�You will know, if you read it,� she said. �You know how carefully Mrs. Singer kept her personal records.�

�Yes.�

We sat in silence for a moment. I stared at the first page of the diary, not reading it, my eyes blurring over the words. I flipped through it, and saw that the small notebook was nearly half filled with her words, with her secrets. Secrets that she wanted me to know, but could not share with me herself.

I gave Alice a desperate look. �I don&#8217;t know if I can read this.�

�It&#8217;s up to you, Mr. Singer,� Alice said, not unkindly. �She wanted you to read it.�

And so I did. Alice merely sat beside me, not saying a word, not moving, as I read through the entire little diary in silence. I never would have thought my sweet Emily capable of keeping such secrets from me, of betraying me in such ways. I trembled in anger, in deep sorrow, in remorse as I read it, but I could not stop until I reach the end, until I&#8217;d read Emily&#8217;s final apology to me, her begging for my forgiveness, even as she lay on her deathbed.

I could not speak for some time after reading of the events in Italy. I closed the diary and held it in my lap. I had nearly forgotten that Alice was beside me until I turned, and saw her sitting there, looking at me in concern. I surprised myself by chuckling a little, a bitter chuckle. �Well, I certainly am a delusional old man, aren&#8217;t I?�

�She never loved you any less than she claimed to,� Alice softly. She tapped the hardbound cover of the diary. �Do you love her any less for this?�

There it was. My Emily wanted to test my love from beyond the grave. She&#8217;d always tried so hard to be my good girl, my perfect little slave, my obedient darling. She&#8217;d never truly displeased me; I had never thought that it was possible. But she had proven that she was able to deceive me, and she had hidden feelings of bitterness towards me. The illusion of my perfect Emily, only strengthened in the decade since her passing, was shattered forever. 

But no. I was relieved to find that I did not love her any less for it all, but perhaps more. Perhaps now, I could finally feel worthy of her, as I never truly had. In the back of my mind, I had always felt like a perverted man who had manipulated a young girl into loving me. She had served me and had allowed me to degrade her, and she had worshipped me. But Emily was intelligent, not na�ve in the least, and she had loved me, in spite of my many many flaws, with her eyes wide open.

I spoke of all this with Alice, the only person who had loved my Emily as much as I, the only one who would understand. She was pleased that I had taken all of it so well. �Mr. Singer,� she said, �Your wife asked one more favor of me, and I am happy to do as she wished. She wanted me to finally offer myself up to you for your use.�

I laughed aloud at this. Alice, the one woman who had ever rejected me, the one woman that I could never have, was finally in my possession. And now, I was too exhausted to do anything about it. I admitted this to her. �I wish you had made this offer years ago, my friend. But it&#8217;s too late for any of that now.� 

Alice stayed for an early dinner, as she had to be on the next train back to London. �I will stop in to see young Emily before we go back to Florence. Do you still think it is best for her to remain in London?�

I did. The delusion being shattered, I knew that I could not play pretend with my young Emily any more. And thinking on it, and talking it over with level-headed, Alice, I realized that my poor (not-)granddaughter was a very confused young lady. She&#8217;d suffered so much heartache, losing her dear younger brother and her husband within the span of a couple of years, and never having recovered the loss of her mother. And I, who had only ever wanted to take care of her and ensure her happiness, had manipulated her. I felt that there was no doubt in that.

�She loves you,� Alice assured me again. �She told me that you helped to heal her grief from losing her husband. I cannot believe that she got married behind everyone&#8217;s back, but I think that she is remorseful of her recklessness, and she wants to begin school again next year.�

I was glad to hear it, and resolved to write to young Emily the next day, to send her my sincere love, my blessing to go out and pursue her dreams and desires, but an open invitation to return to Wainwright Hall any time she pleased. It was the right thing to do. It was what I had sometimes regretted not doing for my own Emily�

In spite of my heavy thoughts, I felt strangely happy as I kissed Alice goodbye. �Mr. Singer, please, you must come and spend your winter with us in Florence. It is lovely there, and the weather would be good for your joints. Please say you will.�

It was a kind invitation, but we both knew that it was never to be. I said, �I am not traveling while there is a war is going on. And by the by, perhaps you might tell your husband that his people need to pick a side and stop wavering.�

�War!� Alice declared with a disgusted shake of her head. �We are neutral, and I hope it stays that way.�

�It won&#8217;t,� I said knowingly, and I would not live to learn that I was right. �Be safe in your travels, my friend.�

I kissed her goodbye again, and noted tears in her lovely eyes as she turned away. She got into the back of my car, and was off quickly to town to catch the next train. I slowly made my way back into my office.

Ignoring the coming of my usual aches and pains, I took up the small diary again, the one that Alice had brought to me, the one that had shattered all of my illusions. I smiled bitterly to myself, shaking my head. Foolish old man! As I made my way slowly up the stairs, I imagined what Emily, my own Emily, might say to all of this, had she had the nerve (the poor dear always had been more than a little afraid of me) to share it all with me herself.

What would I have said to it? I knew, honestly and truly, that I would have said, �I care about none of it, except that you would keep it from me for so long. And I am sorry for having lied to you�do forgive me, darling, and let&#8217;s forget it all. Our love is so perfect, my darling, so complete, and none of the rest of it matters.�

I realized with a start that I was mumbling these words as I went to my bedchamber door. But this is not where I wanted to be. I went instead to the room containing the portrait of Lady Emily, capturing her glorious beauty. I stood before it in the darkened room, looking up at her, asking her again to forgive me. �Forgive me, Emily,� I whispered, and I knew that she had. 

Though the bed in that room had been unused in quite some time, the young maid kept fresh sheets on it, in case of the unexpected arrival of Mina, with or without her husband. I knew that they took some pleasure in the portrait themselves, so it never had to come down. And I was able to lie in a clean, not at all uncomfortable bed, and look at my lovely wife, and think of her, and our life together, and our children, as I lay in that dark room. 

I forgot about our mistakes, about the lies that we&#8217;d told. It had all come out in the end, as it should have. Emily had played it all so well. �You always knew what was best, didn&#8217;t you, darling?� I whispered to her in the dark. She would never agree with such a statement, and I could almost see her lying beside me, blushing at my praise (�Oh, sir, really��). I felt happy and comforted, knowing that when she died, she had not been troubled by anything, knowing that I would know the truth myself in time. Yes, the truth, and the only truth that really mattered was that I had loved her, and she had loved me and had wanted to belong to me all along. In that clean bed, before the glorious portrait of my almost-perfect wife, I could die remembering only our almost-perfect love.
