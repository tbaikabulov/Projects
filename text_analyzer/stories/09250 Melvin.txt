Synopsis:   She would be perfect for him, quiet and shy as she was at work. He would kidnap her, keep her in the hidden room and once she saw she would be safe, he would remove the collar.  They would fall in love, he was sure once she calmed down she would see that.






Melvin had worked the plan over and over in his head, and when he saw her he knew&nbsp; she was the perfect one.&nbsp; Mary was plain in almost every way.&nbsp; She rarely looked people in the eye at work and appeared almost afraid to speak to people. Her clothes and appearance were both awkward.&nbsp; Her desk was in an obscure corner and she ate lunch by herself.&nbsp; Her badge showed she was a temp, just like Melvin.
He had taken the job just to search for the right woman, he already had his inheritance and the house, but he needed a companion.&nbsp; Someone he could talk to, go riding with, go walking by the lake with. At five feet ten inches tall and 180 pounds he was trim enough even if he did not have the social skills or the looks.&nbsp; It was like that even in high school.&nbsp; He tried to fit in but never found a clique to hang with, no real friends and girls were not interested in him, even the few he asked out.&nbsp; He saw Mary and him as the same type.&nbsp; They would be soul mates in their little paradise.
In college he could get laid but no real relationship developed with anyone and by the time he moved out of the dorms he was a loner once again.&nbsp; He did not like the parties, drinking or drugs everyone was doing.&nbsp; Melvin liked the quiet of his family&#8217;s house in the hills, the openness he grew up in.&nbsp; Twenty minutes away from almost anything with a beautiful view of the valley and the lakes.&nbsp;&nbsp; He could go for long bike rides or walks and barely see a soul.&nbsp; He loved the isolation and there was no place in Montana with better views.
The Wright family went back generations in Montana.&nbsp; His great grandfather had built the original house and bought 10 acres; his grandfather built the hidden room for the still. They made a fortune bootlegging during Prohibition and more than once had to hide out down there.&nbsp; The FBI searched the house and grounds, but never found the roomand they bought another 20 acres.&nbsp; His father bought Apple and got another 100 acres. They would be safe and alone there.
After his parents died his small circle got even smaller and soon it was just him.&nbsp; Casual nods from a store clerk he saw each time he went shopping, a hello from the mailman, no one ever called him by his first name, a Christmas car from his only cousin.&nbsp; Except Mary.
He would deliver the mail to her desk and she would glance away and ask politely �Melvin could you see that this goes right to�? Or &#8216;please wait for the answer and bring it right back&#8217;.&nbsp;&nbsp; It did not matter what she asked him, he did it as soon as she asked, always too shy to look him in the eye.&nbsp; Melvin tried to ask her to lunch but she blushed and refused each time.&nbsp; He was sure they would be perfect for each other.&nbsp; 
He followed her home one day and was sure she lived alone, and like him had few acquaintances or friends, and not even a hint of a husband or boyfriend.&nbsp; She drove home the same way every day to a remote section just outside of town.&nbsp; There was a long stretch of a little used highway, once the main road, now an unpatched, underused side road.&nbsp;&nbsp; That would work perfectly for the plan.&nbsp; Mary would learn to love him.
She saw him standing by the bike in the near dark.&nbsp; At first it looked like she would pass him by, but as he stepped into the road she finally stopped.&nbsp; He lied about his wheel being bent and asked if she would give him a ride to a bus stop.&nbsp; As soon as he slid into the front seat next to her she felt a sting on her thigh, and then nothing.
Melvin had decided that a collar and chain would work the best.&nbsp; Mary would not be able to slip out under any circumstance and she would have a comfortable room.&nbsp; He could sit in the area just outside her reach and the chain bolted to the concrete floor gave her free access to walk around.&nbsp; There was a private toilet and sink, cable television, music and books and a queen size bed.
Mary would have to stay there until he had her trust, then they could go riding like a real couple.&nbsp; They would be happy once Mary understood; she would learn to love him once she gave him a chance.&nbsp; By now she would be awake and he would have to explain everything to her.&nbsp; It would be fine once she calmed down and understood.&nbsp; He would talk calmly to her and soon she would accept him and her home.
He could hear moaning from outside the room.&nbsp; As he raced in fearing she had somehow hurt herself she was lying on the bed, fingering her clit and getting ready for an explosive orgasm.&nbsp; Melvin had never seen a woman masturbating before and it shocked him.&nbsp; She continued on to climax as if her were not there. 
Finally, sounding exhausted, she said �Great set up Mel.&nbsp; I had no idea you were such a swinger or I would have said yes to you weeks ago.&nbsp; Nothing gets me off like a steel collar, how did you know?&nbsp; Have you been talking to someone at the club about me?�
Melvin stood there stone faced.&nbsp; This was not what Melvin had expected at all.&nbsp; He was coming in to comfort her, to make her feel everything would be ok, to get her to stop crying.&nbsp; Instead she was having sex by herself and as talkative as she had ever been.&nbsp; She was happy.
�Come on Mel, who have you been talking to?&nbsp; Was it Johnny, he&#8217;s a sweetheart, he knew I was down.&nbsp; It is so sweet of you to do this for me.&nbsp; I hope I wasn&#8217;t supposed to wait for you, was I?&nbsp; Sorry, I just got so excited when I woke up I couldn&#8217;t resist.&nbsp; Not easy to spring surprises like this on me.&nbsp; Be a darling and get me a cigarette out of my bag, I&#8217;m a little tied up at the moment.�&nbsp; She started tugging on the chain and laughing as if she had not a care in the world.&nbsp; Melvin backed out of the room and closed the door.&nbsp; He did not know what to say.
About an hour later he went back to the room.&nbsp; It was probably a reaction to the drug he had used, she would be sobered up by now and he would see the scared and fragile Mary, the soft gentle Mary.&nbsp; There was the moaning again as he walked in.&nbsp; �I had forgotten what a good finger fuck felt like.&nbsp; Once you start using a good dildo you forget about the basics.&nbsp; But you knew that didn&#8217;t you Mel.&nbsp; Forget my cigarette?&nbsp; Come on Mel; go get it like a good boy.&nbsp; I promise not to do anything else until you get back, and don&#8217;t forget the lighter.&nbsp; And bring a joint if you have one, and maybe some iced vodka and let&#8217;s get this scene going.&nbsp; Go now.�&nbsp; She waved him off as she caressed the collar.
Melvin left the room again.&nbsp; He had made a great mistake; she was not at all like he thought.&nbsp; She was loud and course, liked to drink and smoke.&nbsp; But now he had kidnapped her and couldn&#8217;t just let her go.&nbsp; All of his plans were unraveling.&nbsp; He got her a cigarette and went back to the room.
She sat on the bed smoking the cigarette.&nbsp; �So Mel, how long have you been into this?&nbsp; I bet you rent this set-up for what, $250 a night?&nbsp; Worth every penny compared to some of the dives I&#8217;ve seen.&nbsp; Get a couple of toys and you can get even more.&nbsp; What&#8217;s the matter Mel, you don&#8217;t say much?�
�Y..yo..you&#8217;re not at all like you are at work, y..y ou are so quiet and shy there.&nbsp; I thought you would be afraid, scared of me.�&nbsp; 
�Scared, for this little scene?&nbsp; All I had planned was TV all weekend; instead I am getting off like nothing in months.&nbsp; I cannot wait to tell the guys at the club about you and this.&nbsp; You are about to be famous fast.�
�No, nn.no.&nbsp; This is wrong, you are all wrong.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know about any club.&nbsp; N..n.no. �
She shook her head.&nbsp; �Still mad at me for masturbating before you got here, aren&#8217;t you Mel?&nbsp; And here I am using all the good collar time.&nbsp; You want to wear it for a while?�&nbsp; She had the chain in her hand, offering it to him.&nbsp; Mary was speaking too fast for him.
�No�no!!�
�Thanks Mel, you are so sweet.&nbsp; Did you find any pot?�
�No, I..I don&#8217;t...�
�Good to keep a sober head huh, nice discipline.&nbsp; I could never stay straight for long, prison showed me that.&nbsp; Five years is a long time to go without a fix.&nbsp; Prison heroin sucks, not worth the money no matter how strung out you get.&nbsp; Right Mel?�
�PRISON!&nbsp; No...no.&nbsp; For what?�&nbsp; Melvin&#8217;s mind was spinning out of control.
�Don&#8217;t worry Mel, that bastard deserved it.&nbsp; They dropped a nickel on me for a stinking twenty stitch slice.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve had worse paper cuts.&nbsp; �Nic�wha�who?�
�No thing Mel.&nbsp; He was just some junkie I was crashing with.&nbsp; Attempted manslaughter my ass, if I wanted the fucker dead, he would be dead.&nbsp; You can&#8217;t let a junkie start using your shit, once they start they never stop.&nbsp; Fucker needed to be cut.&nbsp; I got a male judge and I never had a chance.&nbsp; Did three of the five and sure don&#8217;t want to do the final deuce.&nbsp; You know what I mean Mel?�
 �You sure you don&#8217;t want the collar for a while, you look pale.&nbsp; Better hurry up, we don&#8217;t have that much time.&nbsp; Definitely do not want to see the cops tomorrow, do we?�
�Wha�what?&nbsp; Cops?�
�My parole officer is already going to be pissed that I didn&#8217;t drive straight home.&nbsp; Bitch is just looking for a reason to bounce me back up.&nbsp; I cannot miss my next phone check or they will definitely start looking for me.&nbsp; You know how home detention works, got to call from home�
�No�n..no one knows you are here.&nbsp; They can&#8217;t find you.&nbsp; I �I was very careful.�
�It&#8217;s that fucking GPS shit they put on my car. Computers take all the fun out of everything, face it, fucking satellite tracking sucks.&nbsp; No damn privacy.&nbsp; Those assholes can find out exactly where I&#8217;ve been like their criminal asses shouldn&#8217;t be behind bars.&nbsp; Where did you stash my car by the way, could do with a blast right about now.&nbsp; This latest batch of meth came out great.�
�G..G..garage.&nbsp; H..Here?&nbsp; You?&nbsp; METH?&nbsp; Tracking syst�&nbsp; �
�Yeah, pissed me off when they told me about that too.&nbsp; Invasion of my rights and everyone knows it, but when you&#8217;re on parole they treat you like shit.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s cool; we have at least 24 hours before she will call it in, plenty of time to make it right.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll tell her about the bike and how I helped you and you swear to it and everything will be cool.&nbsp; Got it?&nbsp; Now give me the key.�
�I can&#8217;t let you go, you will tell the police I kidnapped you.&nbsp; I will go to prison.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t go to prison, I..I..?&nbsp; No..no police, no.�
�You got that right brother, cops never did me no good at all.&nbsp; No cops, they would just as soon send my ass back up to state as look at me.&nbsp; Absolutely no cops.&nbsp; Anyway I don&#8217;t want to leave yet, we got time.&nbsp; I just like to hang and hear the sound of that lock clicking shut.&nbsp; Come on Mel, you tried this before, no point denying it.&nbsp; You know that feeling. �
�CLICK.&nbsp; And you&#8217;re locked in steel.&nbsp; Not those weak ass police cuffs, like we can&#8217;t just slide them right off.&nbsp; Should give that shit away in cereal boxes.&nbsp; Not like this iron you got.�
She grabbed the lock. �That&#8217;s when I feel it deep down inside and I just want to fuck someone&#8217;s light s out.&nbsp; But who am I talking to; I could never pull a place like this off.&nbsp; Mel, sit down, you look worried.&nbsp; Talk to me.&nbsp; What&#8217;s wrong sweetie?�
�I..I thought you were different.&nbsp; I just wanted a quiet girl to love me.&nbsp; Someone polite and and innocent.&nbsp; Bondage, you like bondage.&nbsp; I ..I.. n.n.no�
�You&#8217;re not into any water sports or animals are you Mel?&nbsp; Is that what has you upset?&nbsp; Rule #1, I am definitely not down with other species.&nbsp; And no golden showers either.&nbsp; And no cutting.&nbsp; I mean that, no blood at all or I&#8217;m out of here.&nbsp; Understand that Mel?&nbsp; Otherwise we can still do a lot honey.�
�Yes..no..cutting, n..no.�&nbsp; He could not even understand everything she was talking about.&nbsp; She was making him very confused.
�Aw sweetie, its ok we got different kinks.&nbsp; First thing I think we get someone to work with you on that stuttering problem you have, I never noticed it at work, you talk much better there.&nbsp; Is it a stress thing?&nbsp; My cousin was like that and she found a guy that worked wonders for her.�
�Anyway you have this cool dungeon thing going on. Don&#8217;t worry you&#8217;ll meet Ms. Right.&nbsp; Get it, that was a joke Mel.&nbsp; You know, your last name is Wright.&nbsp; Never mind, lots of women at the club would just love to meet you.&nbsp; You&#8217;re not having any problems getting umm, aroused, are you? �
Melvin could not look Mary in the eyes.&nbsp; �It&#8217;s ok to talk about it sweetie, happens to everyone once and a while, even women.&nbsp; This little scene helped me break a long slump and look at me, I got my mojo back.�
She was slowly wrapping the chain around her waist&nbsp; �The guys at the club just put themselves into a good session.&nbsp; If you don&#8217;t want me I can call one of the guys.&nbsp; It&#8217;s pretty obvious how much you want to get laid right now but take it from me, you need to release some tension before you pair up, don&#8217;t you think Mel?�
The chain was now between her legs.&nbsp; � I can make you touch yourself in a way you have never imagined before. You know that, don&#8217;t you Mel?�
And he did.&nbsp; �Damn I still cannot get over you being so open to all this.&nbsp; Mel digging on the steel bondage scene.&nbsp; Beauty. �
�I..I�I need to think.&nbsp; G..Ggg�Goodnight.�
�Bring me an orange juice for breakfast honey, the fresh stuff too.&nbsp; I need to replenish my sugars.&nbsp; Multiple orgasms always drain me. And it feels like it will be a long night.&nbsp; And not too early either.�&nbsp; Mary was pulling the chain slowly up and down between her thighs, enjoying every link.&nbsp; 
Mel was entranced by her presence and lost in her motions with the chain.&nbsp; She was so relaxed.&nbsp; He had never seen sex talked about so casually and she was doing it right in front of him.&nbsp; There was something about her.&nbsp; One side so sweet and pure, one side so reckless, even dangerous.&nbsp; He wondered what it was like.&nbsp; He did not masturbate often and found he could not get it up as he laid there; he had to see her again.&nbsp; All he could think about was the chained ex-con, knife wielding, drug addicted, satellite tracked women in the basement he really wanted to have sex with.&nbsp; He had to have sex with.
He held out the orange juice as he entered the room, once again to her groans of delight.&nbsp; �You know, every time I think I can&#8217;t do it one more time, it turns out I can.&nbsp; You are the man.&nbsp; My OJ, thanks sweetie.&nbsp; How did you sleep?&nbsp; As you can see, I pretty much haven&#8217;t.�&nbsp; Even with her matted hair she looked better than he had ever seen her.&nbsp; She was glowing.&nbsp; Her smile was so alive.&nbsp; �We have got to hook up again next weekend.�
Melvin held out the key.&nbsp; �Just a couple of hours longer honey, do I have to take it off now?�
�N.no.�
�You&#8217;re gonna let me click it back on aren&#8217;t you.&nbsp; You are so thoughtful.�&nbsp; With that she grabbed the key, unlocked the padlock, put it back on and clicked it shut.&nbsp; He could see a shudder run up and down her body as a gasp of satisfaction leaked out.&nbsp; She unlocked it again and did the same again, each time pausing to hear the click and shuddering with delight.
Mary looked over at Melvin.&nbsp; He was frozen watching her.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m so sorry.&nbsp; It has been all about me hasn&#8217;t it.&nbsp; You want the collar back, don&#8217;t you?�
�Nno.&nbsp; No.�
�I can see it in your eyes, you were up all night, weren&#8217;t you Mel.&nbsp; Still had a problem getting off don&#8217;t you?&nbsp; We saved all the good stuff for me. So here please, put it on, I know you want to.�
�No. No. No coll��
�But you do. Ever the gentleman, you want some privacy while you get off, that&#8217;s it isn&#8217;t it Mel?&nbsp;&nbsp; That&#8217;s why the girls are gonna love you Mel. Really thoughtful.&nbsp; Most guys are such pigs. You really never have tried it before, have you?�
He just shook his head no.
�It&#8217;s alright honey.&nbsp; The first time you don&#8217;t even have to lock it.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t even use the lock.&nbsp; Just put on the collar and feel the chain.&nbsp; Feel what it does to you.&nbsp; If it doesn&#8217;t get you hard, nothing will.�
�N..n�n�.�&nbsp; He could not take his eyes off the collar as she rubbed it gently between her breasts. 
�Look, Mel, I will put it down on the bed and put the lock on the pillow.�&nbsp; She walked towards him with the key and pushed it into his pocket as she unbelted his pants, unzipped them and pulled them down.&nbsp; I am going to go outside the room for five minutes to let you decide without anyone watching.&nbsp; I will bet you dinner at a nice place that when I come back you will have just had the best jerk in the pants you have ever had.&nbsp; Trust me Mel.�&nbsp;&nbsp; She whispered in his ear �mmmmClick.�
She smiled such an enticing smile, licking her lips as the door closed.&nbsp; Melvin knew he had to feel what she did, that unrepressed bone shaking orgasm she had.&nbsp; He knew he shouldn&#8217;t, deep down he was afraid of what he was doing, but he had to know.&nbsp; First the collar and it had an immediate effect but still not to the point of where she was.&nbsp; He picked up the lock and thought of her shudders as she clicked the lock shut.
CLICK.
He was now rock hard and pumping on his dick until it exploded as he fell back on the bed.&nbsp; She was right, it was the best sex he had ever had.&nbsp; Not just the best jerk off, the best orgasm ever.&nbsp; He knew life would never be the same.
It was the next day before Mary came back.&nbsp; By this point Melvin was in tears, searching frantically for the key.&nbsp; �Mary, W..where have you been..I..I.. lost the key. It&#8217;s not in my pockets or in the bed.&nbsp; I know I had it but I have been locked here all night I�I can&#8217;t get this off.�&nbsp; He was pulling hard on the collar.
�Oh that&#8217;s too bad Mel.&nbsp; That is a pretty strong chain and a real quality lock.&nbsp; If you don&#8217;t find that ket you could be here for a while.&nbsp; The downside of metal bondage is you really need to control the damn keys.&nbsp; You need to trust the people you give them to.�
�Please, I want to take this off.�
�Didn&#8217;t enjoy yourself Mel?�
�No, you were right, I got very excited and came It was great.&nbsp; But I can&#8217;t find the key.�&nbsp; He was near tears as he yanked on the chain.
�Is that all that&#8217;s upsetting you Mel?&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t have the key either and I am fine now.&nbsp; I woke up chained by the neck in your little prison here.&nbsp; I wore that damn collar all night until you were gullible enough to let me go. I was terrified by that collar every moment it was on so now you know the pain you caused.�&nbsp; For the first time she showed anger, real anger.
�You low life piece of garbage.&nbsp; I was already home when it dawned on me that if you did buy that clicking bullshit, you would be stuck and probably die of starvation.&nbsp; I&#8217;m no saint, but I am not about to kill anyone, even a sicko kidnapper like you.�&nbsp; She held out the key.
Melvin was straining on the chain frantically grabbing for release.&nbsp; �Wh..wwh.. what are you talking about?&nbsp; Give me that key. �&nbsp; He&nbsp; said it as sternly as he could but she just smiled standing just far enough away.
�You know Melvin, I just knew if I started out pleading with you like that and demanding things I would still be chained there.&nbsp; So I did that whole bondage queen parolee orgasm act and you just could not get enough of it.&nbsp; My lucky day, my kidnapper is a chump.&nbsp; Fifteen years on the con and I had no clue what you would do; I gave you a good reason to kill me.&nbsp;&nbsp; But as soon as I saw you this morning I knew you had taken the bait.&nbsp; I never really thought you would lock it on until I saw the look as I unzipped your pants.&nbsp; Then I was pretty sure.&nbsp; But what to do with you?�
 �But you parole officer, the tracking��
�All bullshit Melvin.&nbsp; I have never even gotten a ticket.&nbsp;&nbsp; The only true thing I told you was about the cops, in my line of work I avoid any contact with any law enforcement.&nbsp; I&#8217;m on the con Melvin.&nbsp; I was setting up a phony account on this temp job but now I think I better just move on.&nbsp; A waste of six months in this miserable town, better to dump it if something like this goes wrong.&nbsp; Too bad, it was a great scam, tough to do these days.&nbsp; At this point I can point out the errors at work and even get a good eval for it.&nbsp; Then I am out of this backwater.&nbsp; But what to do with you Melvin?�
�I won&#8217;t tell anyone.�&nbsp; He was pulling on the lock and staring around the room like he was there for the first time.
�I am sure you won&#8217;t.&nbsp; I am not about to let you go out and kidnap some other poor woman and chain her up down here.&nbsp; That is just wrong Melvin; you are a real sick one Mel.&nbsp; Not real bright either.�
�I won&#8217;t do it again, I..I�&nbsp; He was now putting everything he had into pulling the bolt off.&nbsp; It did not budge.&nbsp; �Let me go, you can&#8217;t keep me like this.�
�It&#8217;s&nbsp; your chain Mel , your lock, and you put them both on.&nbsp; And it has only been a day.&nbsp; Calm down Mel you are damn lucky I came back, no one would find you here.&nbsp; Any food in the fridge?&nbsp; I&#8217;ll go look, you stay here.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll be back tomorrow.�&nbsp; She could hear him pulling on his chain.
By this point Melvin had been reduced to sitting on the bed crying.&nbsp; That is how she found him the next day.&nbsp; Mary looked excited when she came in.&nbsp; �You didn&#8217;t sleep well again did you Mel?&nbsp;&nbsp; Stuttering, insomnia, sexual dysfunction, you are a mess Mel.&nbsp;&nbsp; So sorry about that mattress, the beds upstairs are so much nicer.&nbsp; Is the collar comfortable enough for you?&nbsp; Can I get you a couple of more links for your chain?�
�What are you going to do with me?�
�Let&#8217;s get one thing right here Melvin, I would love to see you ass in a prison cell.&nbsp; I was going to break my own rule and call the cops, then I saw your bank accounts.�
�Melvin, you have money, lots of money, and stocks, lots of stocks and flat out own land, lots and lots of nice land.&nbsp; This is a beautiful house, great furniture, artwork being wasted by a guy who has to kidnap women to get a date.&nbsp; So sad.�
 �I have been through your computer and I must say you are quite organized.&nbsp; Hint: If you ever get out of here learn some decent passwords.�
�Then I found all of those pictures of me, you were stalking me for a while you naughty boy.&nbsp; Then I found our wedding picture.&nbsp; Nice photoshop work, but not my style of dress.&nbsp; And our honeymoon pictures, very nice.&nbsp; Hawaii.&nbsp; Then it hit me, why not?�&nbsp; 
Melvin&#8217;s eyes lit up.&nbsp; �You want to marry me?�
�No Melvin, don&#8217;t be stupid.&nbsp; But I am a pretty good forger, handwriting, especially left hand writing like yours.&nbsp; Yours looks pretty easy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Marriage certificates are easy and I have a friend in the County Clerk&#8217;s office, a notary at that, no problem there.&nbsp; We already have the pictures.&nbsp; Your signature won&#8217;t take much work.&nbsp; I have to go forge our new lives, you want to come with me?&nbsp; Sorry, that joke might never get old Mel.&nbsp; Still, I don&#8217;t want to spend my life being a nursemaid to you locked down here.&nbsp; What to do, what to do?�
She would come down twice a day to bring him meals and talk, never getting close enough to touch.&nbsp; As she sat in the sitting room she would read some books and write furiously in a book, looking at him, and writing some more.&nbsp; It became obvious she had some sort of plan.&nbsp; Melvin had tried everything he could think of, but she would not relent, she kept him chained.&nbsp; Mary felt he should be imprisoned, and there he was.&nbsp; He had not had an erection since he locked the collar on.
�They gave me a wedding shower at work today Mel, everyone was sorry you couldn&#8217;t be there.&nbsp; And I gave notice, to my landlord too.&nbsp; No point in paying rent when we will be officially man and wife tomorrow.&nbsp; Your lawyer wanted you to sign the new will.&nbsp; I told him it would be in the outgoing mail.&nbsp; Now all we have to do is put you somewhere safe.�
The book Mary spent so much time with was a diary, his diary and was written to look like his hand writing.&nbsp; The more she wrote the better she got at it.&nbsp; It would have fooled anyone.&nbsp; She even changed the writing styles over the years to match the real diary he kept until college.&nbsp; 
�This is your secret diary and you are saying you did some very bad things, especially to children.&nbsp; That incident outside your orthodontist office when you forced the 10 year old girl into the bushes.&nbsp; You should be ashamed Mel, you were 16 at the time.�
�That never happened.&nbsp; I never did anything like that.�
 �Not what you wrote here Mel.&nbsp; Turns out you did the same thing 8 months later with a little boy, only 11, and your orthodontist wanted to get a restraining order for those things and the &#8216;other time&#8217;.&nbsp; Your parents made the whole thing go away.�
�No one will believe any of that,&nbsp;&nbsp; you have to let me go.�
 She just talked on.&nbsp; �Mel, you are the classic loner, you have no friends and no close relatives.&nbsp; Once they read these confessions in your own hand, there will be no one to deny it for you.&nbsp; And the more you deny it, the sicker they will think you are.&nbsp; Shall we go on?&nbsp; That rape your parents covered up for you in college, a 14 year old girl that time.&nbsp; She also wore braces Mel, seems you&#8217;re hung up on them.�
�I am not.&nbsp; You can&#8217;t just make up things.�
�Sure I can Mel.&nbsp; Here&#8217;s a good passage from your college years:
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Spent the day at the mall.&nbsp; The boys looked really good today, much better than last week.&nbsp; The girls all look like little sluts today and last week, their mothers should be raped in public as a lesson, then they will see the evil they do.&nbsp; Last week they looked so sweet and pure, now I must go back to the boys for a while.&nbsp; I got that one boy in the headgear in the dressing room.&nbsp; I touched him on the way out, he was still too small for fun, but they don&#8217;t understand why I am grabbing them there.&nbsp; I felt good when he shied away and went back to his mother.&nbsp; He never pointed to me, that means he liked it.&nbsp; Grabbed two other boys but they did not react.&nbsp; Problem with boys is they get too big, girls are easier to handle.&nbsp; Still, it was a good day, the mall has lots of young talent.&nbsp; Wish they had swings and slides, can&#8217;t wait for spring.&nbsp; Goodnight little boy in your headgear, I hope you remember me. I will come back next week, will you?&nbsp; I wish I could keep you for a week.&nbsp; No one knows me around here this should be easy.
�That&#8217;s sick, I never did that.&nbsp; Stop writing that.�
�Here are more good entries from ten years ago�
I cannot help it.&nbsp; I tried the drugs and the treatment; I just do not see anything wrong with teaching children true love at an early age.&nbsp; I know I can&#8217;t tell anyone this, they will want me to go to a hospital and if I get caught , prison.&nbsp; I saw one guy will not get out even after his sentence is up.&nbsp; I would get raped there, I should be the one in control.&nbsp; She knew that last week, she was older but still small enough.&nbsp; She did not scream when she saw that I was just spreading my love.&nbsp; The new drug worked well on her.&nbsp; I will try it on a boy next time, maybe a small high school boy, I am starting to like them more at that age.&nbsp; Maybe one with braces again.&nbsp; Maybe I can add another chain downstairs&nbsp; and get a mixed pair.
�Stop it, stop, none of that is true.&nbsp; I just wanted you.�&nbsp; He was straining to get to the diary.
�Ah yes, me.&nbsp; You should love this part:
It is her, the one at work.&nbsp; She makes me feel like a man, boys and girls don&#8217;t matter around her.&nbsp; She asked me to escort her to a wedding.&nbsp; I trust her, she does not know about the money, she thinks I am a low paid temp.&nbsp; The Dr. was right I just needed to get out and meet people, the job was not important.&nbsp; I dare not tell her about my special devotion.&nbsp; I do not want to scare her but she might set me right.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t go on like this.&nbsp; What I am doing is wrong, I know it is and I know I will never stop. They can&#8217;t make me and I don&#8217;t want to.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe Mary will be the one who will relieve me of this burden.&nbsp; I know I said last time I would commit myself if I touched one more child, and already have done four more.&nbsp; That last girl was scared I hate having to leave that fast.&nbsp; She was pointing at me.&nbsp; But Mary will help me stop.&nbsp; We have dated for three months.&nbsp; I will ask her at the wedding, she will like that��.
She said yes, yes.&nbsp; I am so happy and so relieved.&nbsp; I wish my parents were here to see I made it, I can be normal.&nbsp; Mary has made me feel whole, she is the one who can help me��.That littlegirl in the blue dress wanted me, I could feel it.&nbsp; It was too crowded but I almost tried.&nbsp; Thought I had her in the bathroom but that bitch of her mother showed up.&nbsp; Now I wish I had showed her, them both my love.
We are married and I am so relieved.&nbsp; She was amazed when she saw the house.&nbsp; She is very happy and I will keep it that way.&nbsp; I love her and she loves me, which should be enough.&nbsp; She wants me to meet her friends.&nbsp; I feel good finally��good that a wife makes me less suspicious, she has friends with children, they will never suspect me. They let me diaper a little girl, that was fun and she will never be able to tell anyone, my pinky was the perfect size.&nbsp; 
It was her friend&#8217;s daughter.&nbsp; I was fine until she had to say it &#8216;Cathy gets her braces next week.&#8217;&nbsp; Now all I can think about is Cathy, she is twelve and very cute. No hassle with diapers either. I have to find a way to spend time with her.&nbsp; Cannot let Mary find out, I should not have given her that letter.&nbsp; I should be able to express myself with children.&nbsp; It is not like cheating on Mary, it is not really sex.&nbsp; But I know one day I will find the right girl for the room.&nbsp; I will train her, she will grow to love it.&nbsp; The chain will keep everything safe.&nbsp; Mary has not found the room yet, she has walked past the door dozens of time.&nbsp; I fear if we get pregnant she will not understand the love I will show our children��&nbsp; 
I reread yesterday.&nbsp; I need help, I am glad she has the letter I cannot stop.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t tell Mary, I love her so much.&nbsp; She will make the right decision for me.&nbsp; That thought keeps me sane.&nbsp; I do not want to hurt anyone else but I know I will.&nbsp; I have to�..
She is perfect.&nbsp; It will be a long drive but she is still riding a bike at dusk and that will make it easy.&nbsp; She wears a retainer so I will not have to worry about that.&nbsp; I will set it up for next week.&nbsp; I did a sound check on the room. It is completely quiet.&nbsp; Once she is drugged and the hood is on I can keep her for a while then drug her and put her back.&nbsp; No harm done.&nbsp; Next I will grab a boy.&nbsp; Just be careful and everything will be fine��drive to Idaho, they will never look here.
�You are making me look insane.�&nbsp; He was right, I was.
�Exactly Mel, when they read all about your history, and going to playgrounds so you can try to fondle little girls, all sorts of other nasty stuff they will want to lock you up.&nbsp; People hate pedophiles Mel, they want them locked up as tight as we can.&nbsp; As tempting as it is to send you to prison, the diaries cannot make a legally tight case with no known victim.� 
�And the best part is when you keep saying you don&#8217;t know what they are talking about, you actually won&#8217;t.&nbsp; And the more you say that the worse off they will think you are.�
�You wrote me a letter and gave it to me on our wedding day.&nbsp; Want to see a picture? Here, read this.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t bother tearing it up, I can always write another:
Dearest Mary,
I love you dearly and know you love me.&nbsp; You are the only one I trust.&nbsp; I have hidden it well but I know I am a very sick man.&nbsp; I know I will never be cured and I must not be allowed to hurt anyone else.&nbsp; I have committed rape on both women and children, including boys.&nbsp; I know how evil that is.&nbsp; The enclosed document will give you the power to help me and save me and others from myself. I am not strong enough or I would have committed myself long ago.
There is a hidden room down in the basement, behind the shelves and down the tunnel.&nbsp; I keep a diary there that will explain more.&nbsp; I have installed a collar and chain in the room and fight every day not to kidnap some innocent child and chain them there.&nbsp; If only to teach them my love.&nbsp; I know it is wrong and I have done it before.&nbsp; My only hope is you because if I am ever caught I will kill myself.&nbsp; The only thing more certain than that is that I will eventually violate some child&#8217;s innocence or wreck my vengeance on the women who raise them so poorly.&nbsp; Even your strength and trust cannot save me.&nbsp; It might be the most difficult thing I can ask you to do, but if you are reading this letter it means I have strayed and you must take control of my life.&nbsp; I am incompetent to make decisions on my behalf.&nbsp; Always have been.&nbsp; As stated on the form, I give you the authority, with or against my will, to have me treated by your choice of doctors and/or medication or to commit me to any hospital or institution as you see fit.&nbsp; I waive any legal time restraints or legal rights to challenge your decision.&nbsp; Let them read what I have done.&nbsp; I can never be free again and you must suffer for what I have done.&nbsp; 
Your Loving and Devoted Husband,
Melvin

�Basically Mel, when I show the doctors your diaries in your handwriting, the pictures of the playground and little girls I took with your camera, pictures of this room and the letter and psychiatric advance directive you signed, you will be locked up for a very long time at the state hospital in Warm Springs.&nbsp; I am sure they will insist.�

�I..I never committed those things, they will see.&nbsp; I am not guilty of anything.�

�Wrong again Mel, that&#8217;s the point.&nbsp; You kidnapped me but we won&#8217;t talk about that. They give 25 years in prison for drugging, kidnapping and chaining people.&nbsp;&nbsp; You don&#8217;t want to go to prison, do you Mel?�

�And you don&#8217;t have to be guilty of a crime to be committed, it&#8217;s called civil commitment.&nbsp; I have already given you a sleeping pill in your breakfast.&nbsp; When you fall asleep I will give you an overdose, call the paramedics, discover the room and the diaries and the system will take care of the rest.&nbsp; I will tell them you came to me, showed me the pictures broke down and tried suicide.&nbsp; Lucky for you I was here to save your life.&nbsp; I will visit you, occasionally anyway.�

�I�I..�

�Goodnight Mel,&nbsp; I will see you at the hospital.�

�Ms. Wright, I&#8217;m Dr Ganz, chief resident of the psychiatric department.&nbsp; As you have probably figured out your husband is a very sick man.&nbsp; Pedophilia is difficult enough to treat, but with his history, I must be honest here, I do not believe he can ever be totally cured and it will take exceptional luck to even get him well enough for outpatient treatment.&nbsp; He is in a state of denial at the moment, accusing you of forging the whole thing.&nbsp; It will be a long and difficult treatment and I cannot guarantee the results.&nbsp; I am sorry.&nbsp; This must be a great shock to you, can I suggest someone to talk to?�

�No I will be alright.&nbsp; May I see him?�

�Since you are here, yes.&nbsp; I am afraid though he might be transferring his problems to you.&nbsp; He might be very hostile.&nbsp; If that continues I am afraid I will have to ask you to refrain from visiting him until he improves.&nbsp; I have had two other doctors study his case and we all agree, and we are sure a judge will too, he is a clear danger to himself and others.&nbsp; I know this is difficult for you and we are all impressed by your strength.&nbsp; His room is this way.�

�The Advance Directive speaks for itself.&nbsp; I see that you and your husband have very good insurance and are, shall we say, well off financially.&nbsp; The State Hospital does the best that they can to deliver treatment but your husband, in my opinion, is a rare case and requires special treatment that we simply cannot give him.&nbsp; There is a very secure facility in Idaho that handles pedophiles and rapist, I am sure we can convince the judge to transfer your husband on a long term basis.&nbsp; Your husband&#8217;s instructions are very clear.&nbsp; The choice is yours to make.&nbsp; It is very safe and acknowledges the high level of recidivism among men with your husband&#8217;s particular problems.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is certainly a more expensive option, but if you can��

�Thank you for telling me.&nbsp; Money is not a concern at the moment.&nbsp;&nbsp; I want him, and everyone, safe.&nbsp; Before I see him can I do a little homework on the Idaho option.�

�He will be here until Tuesday before he has to see a judge.&nbsp; I could arrange a tour by then.�

�How is he today Dr.?&nbsp; He rages on and off between calling you sweet and gentle and the most conniving woman in the world.&nbsp; He rants about how he does not love children and how he chained you up and tricked him.&nbsp; He is delusional at times.�

�Is the transfer all ready?�

�They are about to administer the sedatives for the trip.&nbsp; The judge has signed off on everything.�

Melvin was lying down with his wrist and ankles cuffed to the bed with lined leather straps.&nbsp; He struggled to get free when she walked in.&nbsp; �Can we have a moment alone Dr.?�

�Well this is goodbye Mel.&nbsp; They want me to stay away for a while.&nbsp; Are those cuffs better or worse than your collar?&nbsp; I would not try telling about that, they think you are nuts already.&nbsp; You will get the best treatment available from doctors that understand your life long struggle and your realization about possibly never being safe enough to let out.&nbsp; No drugs or real modification stuff and they understand that long term commitment is sometimes the only answer.&nbsp; They wanted to put you in a regular locked ward, but I told money was no object and they agreed to a high security section for only a little extra money.&nbsp; Only 12 patients on that wing, you&#8217;ll be safer there sweetie.&nbsp; I hope you will all become very good friends.&nbsp; You will spend a lot of time together.&nbsp; It has a nice window, don&#8217;t let the bars scare you.&nbsp; I will make an effort to stop by if I go skiing.�

�I am not insane, you have to tell them.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t go to that place.&nbsp; I just want to go home and be alone.�

�Sorry Mel, too late for that.&nbsp; I am sure you will learn to adjust.&nbsp;&nbsp; You will lead a quiet peaceful life.&nbsp; Did I mention they suggested an all-male section, with your history of sexual violence and everything.&nbsp; I might be the only woman you ever see again.&nbsp; Thanks for the house and the money and all of that land, I will live very well.&nbsp; Did I mention I&#8217;m retired now, thanks sweetie.&nbsp; Just remember one thing Mel.�

�Wh... what?�

�Click.�
