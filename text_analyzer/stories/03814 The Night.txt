? ONE ? 
He slipped into the tight black sleeveless dress. Pulled up the shoulder length
  gloves. Stepped into the 5&quot; stiletto heeled pumps. Make-up. Jewelry. And
  feeling the taut electricity of the ruse caressing his body, walked about his
  hotel room. His every move calculated to heighten his sexuality, to project
  her sensuality. 
It felt so good to be a woman. Even if only in his head. Feeling the dress
  embrace his sexy waist and hips formed by the corset. The silky gloved fingers
  gliding over his nylon sheathed legs sending a shiver up his spine. His long
  hair tickling his bare back with every move. 
The tension building inside his head and sex... Yes, to be a woman. A beautiful,
  long legged, sensual woman. To tantalize men. To have the ultimate power over
  them. To make them beg. To do anything just to look at her, be with her. Oh,
  to be a woman! 
He walked slowly to the full length mirror. Afraid to look lest the image
  there shatter the fantasy. Then stealing a glance at the sensuous woman he
  was pretending to be, the sensuous woman he had become. Partly in his own head,
  partly in reality. 
It was hard to separate the fantasy from the reality. Which was more of which
  didn't really matter. This was his private fantasy. Not meant for the public.
  Not meant for anyone but himself. This fantasy. This beautiful woman he had
  become for tonight. Taut. Sensual. Erotic. 
A dangerous thought. Daring. �Must be seen by some one. Some man.� Make them
  believe he was real. Yes. How? Go to the bar? No, no. Much too dangerous. Someone
  might see him. The hotel staff might recognize him and throw him out. Worse,
  they might not know him and think he was a call-girl. A trollop. A Hooker.
  Picked up by the police. Humiliated. No, no. Never go out. Never be seen. This
  is private. If he was caught it would mean public ridicule or jail, or both.
  But ... 
But to feel like a woman. To wander outside where the cool breeze could caress
  his shaven legs. Creep up beneath his skirt and kiss the nether land between
  his legs. Yes. The thrill. The sensations! Could he pull it off? Could he really
  pass as a woman? 
Another look in the mirror. Yes! He could... No, he couldn't. Too many people
  he would know. What to do? 
He strolled around his room catching glances of himself in various mirrors. &quot;Act
  like a woman. A confidant woman. Be a woman.&quot; Who would know? 
He found himself walking to the balcony doors. It's dark outside. No one would
  see him. No one would know it's him. They'd only see a very sexy womanly form
  from afar. 
He stepped through the curtains. Adrenaline pumping. Opened the sliding glass
  doors. Searing electricity. And he was suddenly outside. The breeze doing exactly
  as he had imagined. His nipples hardened. A chill of excitement rippling all
  through his body. His every nerve alive. 
The area below his balcony was deserted. Empty and dark. He wrapped his arms
  around himself against the cool breeze. Feeling the weight and shape of his
  breast forms against his arms. Slipped a gloved finger beneath them and teased
  his own nipples. A shiver of excitement! 
Oh! To be a glorious woman. To always be allowed to feel this excitement.
  To feel this good. To have these sensations! To have men want him. Or for that
  matter, beautiful women. Lipstick lesbians. Yes. Oh yes. Please God. Why can't
  this one wish come true? 
The roar of a car coming to a stop. He quickly returned to the safety of his
  room. It was late and his first meeting was too early. Time to shed the dream.
  Sadly. To become boring old Richard again. The responsible worker drone. Time
  to satisfy his manly urges and go to sleep. 
? TWO ? 
When he returned to his room after a day full of endless meeting chatter and
  mediocre meals, he was feeling to tired to even indulge in last evening's fantasies.
  Too tired to think. Too tired to fantasize. He opened his door expecting to
  fling his coat onto the bed and collapse into a chair by the phone and call
  the office. Instead he was surprised to find an envelope on the floor. 
It was not addressed to anyone. It had no markings on it except his room number.
  He opened it and read: 
Beautiful woman: 
Please come to the penthouse tonight at 11 PM dressed as you were on that
  balcony last night. A vision. A dream. Do not be afraid. I know you. I know
  what you want. I can grant you your deepest wish. 
Just come. Or you'll never know what could be. 
Love 
He was stunned. He was afraid. He was appalled. He was also just a little
  bit excited. Someone had seen him and thought he was a beautiful woman! 
Of course going to anyone's room was out of the question. Especially dressed
  as a woman. It was ridiculous. Best just to forget the whole thing and be a
  bit more careful in the future. 
He phoned his office and while talking saw another envelope slide under his
  door. After hanging up with them (almost on them), he retrieved the envelope
  and opened it. 
A hand drawn likeness of the fantasy of himself as he had been last night
  on the balcony. Long flowing hair, short tight dress, beautiful long legs with
  an attractive face. There was only one word hand-written on the page: 
&quot;Please&quot;. 
He could not even consider going. But none the less, he showered and shaved
  and powdered. He glided into the room and lay luxuriantly on the bed and fantasized
  about what might happen... 
A knock on the door. Footsteps. It swings open revealing a tall attractive
  man dressed in a tailored suit. Tension. Fear. Then he takes your hand and
  leads you into the suite. He strokes your hair. Caresses you chin, offers you
  a glass of champagne. A romantic embrace, then lifting you into his strong
  arms, sweeping you off your feet, and carrying you into the fire-lit bedroom. 
He woke with a start. What was he thinking!? He wasn't a homosexual or a public
  cross-dresser. He could never go through with this meeting. Not even consider
  it! Had he lost his sub-conscious mind? 
He turned on the television and watched a report on the latest fashions: Corsets
  and heels are back. Shape and feminine lines. Good. 
He rose to go to the bathroom and there on the floor by the door was yet another
  envelope. 
Inside was a key and a note which read: 
&quot;Be not afraid. Come.&quot; 
He looked at the clock. Eight PM. Maybe he did have the energy to dress again
  tonight. He would not be attending his mystery man's party, but that didn't
  mean he couldn't have fun by himself, did it? 
? THREE ? 
He was �Her' again. Every fiber of his body seemed charged. Transformed. The
  sensations of the tight clothing. The smells of the make-up. The perfumes and
  tingles. The jangles of the long earrings and bracelets. The feel of the stockings
  under his gloved caresses. 
Yes. He was definitely �Her' again. And he found himself out on the balcony
  again. Soaking in the sensations of the night. Drunk with the feel of it all.
  With the taste of womanhood he was experiencing. And knowing that on this very
  balcony some 'Don Juan' had fallen for this image of a woman, only made it
  all that much more intoxicating. That much more erotic. That much more powerful.
  He was a woman. A believable, passable woman. And he had proof! 
He stoked his bare arms. Let the breezes caress his legs. Let his long black
  hair fall onto his shoulders and cascade down his back. 
He jumped when there was a knock on his door. Retreating into the shadows
  as the danger of his situation flooded back to him: A man dressed as a woman
  in a foreign city. 
The knock came again. &quot;Room service&quot;, a voice said. 
Room service? I didn't order any room service. He crept to the door and looked
  out the peephole. A bellhop with a tray on his up-raised hand, &quot;Room service&quot;,
  he repeated. 
&quot;Um, yes. Just leave it by the door, please.&quot; 
&quot;You must sign.&quot; 
&quot;O.K. um. Give me a minute... OK just bring it in. I'll be in the bathroom.&quot; He
  leapt into the bathroom as he unlocked the door. The bellhop did not see him.
  He listened at the door as the tray was put on the table accompanied by the
  soft sounds a glass and stemware being arranged on a silver tray. 
&quot;Please sign sir?&quot; The Bellhop asked through the closed door. 
&quot;Right. Uh� Just slip it under the door here?&quot; 
The bill slid under the door with a pen. He signed and put on a generous tip,
  slid it back out and listened as the bellhop left. 
He cautiously opened the bathroom door, peering around, to find that he was
  alone again. And on the table was a dark smoky drink in a cut crystal glass,
  a vase with a single red rose and a note. 
&quot; Come .&quot; was all it said. &quot; Come .&quot; 
He was a bit un-nerved and angry all at the same time. Who does this guy think
  he is?! Who was this guy?! The nerve! 
He sat, crossing his legs. Then noticing how effortlessly he had just impersonated
  a feminine move. How shapely his legs were. The feel of the stockings rubbing
  against one another. He absent-mindedly picked up the drink. Sipped it. Angry
  again suddenly at the intrusion of this phantom man. 
Scotch? No. He tasted it again. Not quite. But similar. Tasty. He drank again.
  The warmth of the liquor spreading through him as his absent-minded stroking
  of his leg began to send sensual waves up and down his spine. Make him feel
  erotic. 
He picked up the note. &quot;Come&quot;. Come indeed he thought. He stood
  and crossed the room to the key that had been sent, catching a glimpse of himself
  in the full length mirror. He paused and looked. Really looked. Could he pull
  off this deception in public? Could he pass? 
He felt he could. He thought he might. &quot;Why not?&quot; he said out loud.
  Hearing his own voice brought the entire affair to a crashing halt. The voice
  of a man. Not the sultry voice of the woman he thought he was seeing in the
  mirror. 
He sat back down and took another drink somewhat disappointed that he could
  not pull off the deception. That he could not go on this mysterious date. He
  sipped again. The drink would give him courage or at the very least, make him
  drunk enough to believe in the mirror, not his voice. He gulped the drink.
  All gone. 
Time to fix his lipstick. To feel the clothing constricting his body. Feel
  the sensuous sensations as he moved. To experience being a woman, the ultimate
  experience in his mind. 
When he came out of the bathroom he found another note on the floor. Boy!
  This guy was really persistent! He opened it. 
&quot;Come. Have no fear. Come. If you are afraid then meet
  me in the bar. I will be there for twenty minutes beginning at 10:40. I will
  make myself known. Please, do come, pretty Lady.&quot; 
This time it was signed with an initial, &quot;A.&quot; 
&quot;Go to a public bar&quot;, he thought. &quot;Not bloody likely!&quot; 
? FOUR ? 
He paced his room restlessly. His stiletto heels clicking occasionally on
  the wooden floor by the door. This dressing in his room was losing its thrill.
  Maybe just once down the hotel hallway. Who would see him? 
&quot;That's a stupid thought&quot;' he said trying on a more breathy voice,
  hearing it and shaking his head at the attempt. 
He went out onto his darkened balcony. The cool night air caressing his smooth
  legs. That unmistakable thrill of electricity blazing up and down his nervous
  system. 
&quot;I'm like a junkie who needs bigger and bigger thrills &quot;, he said,
  and this time, without trying, he thought his voice was not his. More feminine.
  He smiled. &quot;Ooohhh God! Make me a real woman. Even if just for one night!&quot; And
  his voice was that of a woman's, a little husky, but definitely feminine. 
He resolved to venture once down the corridor. Throw caution, and intelligence,
  to the wind. It was about 10:30. Time for the bar meeting with his unknown
  admirer. No one would be in the hall. Would they? 
He peered through his door peephole. No one in the hall. He stood, straining
  his hearing for any sounds that might signal approaching danger. 
He cracked open his door. Silence. Pause. His heart beating faster and faster.
  Slowly he opened it. No one in the hallway. Dead quiet. 
He was scared. He was alive! He was a woman. He strode out into the hallway.
  Every nerve end buzzing. Every molecule of his body straining to hear someone
  coming. He strutted down the length of the corridor. &quot;Relax. Be a woman.
  Smaller steps. Sink into it. Squeeze the thighs together. One foot directly
  in front of the other. Move your arms. Loosen those hips. Yes. Sensuous.&quot; 
He stopped to study himself in the mirror covered elevator doors. He was a
  woman if you didn't look too closely. The corset pinched in his waist wonderfully.
  He had sexy hips, a tiny waist. A proportioned chest, long dark hair falling
  to one side revealing one long dangling silver earring. His full red lips.
  His beautiful blue eyes. Sexy eyes with the make-up on. Yes he was passable. 
&quot;DING!&quot; The sound sent an electrical shock through his body! The
  elevator doors slide open. He turned, frightened, and began to hurry down the
  hallway. Back to his room. The two young men who exited the elevator said nothing.
  He was afraid to look back. Too see if they were looking at him. Did they know?
  Of course they did. They had too. Who was he fooling? 
At his door he turned the handle. LOCKED! Of course it was locked. When was
  it ever not? The key? OH MY GOD! THE KEY!!! He had forgotten the key. 
What was he going to do now? The two guys were approaching. What to do? 
&quot;Having trouble miss?&quot; one of them said as they stopped to help. 
He shook his head no. He had never had to have a female voice. Now was not
  the time to try his new one out. 
&quot;Locked out?&quot; asked the second one. 
&quot;Um, excuse me.&quot; He said as he turned his back on them and walked
  back towards the elevators. He could feel their eyes upon him. Or her as the
  case would appear. 
Then he heard the rise and fall of a 'Wolf' whistle from the first guy. 
He heard the second guy quietly say &quot;Whoa!&quot; as he turned the corner
  to the elevator. 
&quot;What to do? Call the desk? Go to the desk? NO. Oh God! What a mess.
  What a mess!&quot; He stood at the closed elevator doors trying to figure out
  what to do. Where to go for help. &quot;Oh God� What a mess. What a mess!&quot; he
  said without even trying, in a wonderful female voice. 
&quot;I think I can help you&quot; said a low sultry voice. By habit he turned
  but he wasn't prepared for what he saw: A tall beautiful auburn haired woman.
  She was stunning. She was everything he had always wanted to be. Sexy. Sure
  of herself. Magnificent breasts. Tiny waist. Long exquisite legs. High heel
  shoes. Leather over-the-elbow gloves. Tight, short sexy black dress. And her
  features were perfect. A small, full mouth. A perfect nose and two of the most
  beautiful sensuous green eyes he had ever seen. They were glowing with sensuality. 
She put her hand gently on his arm and said, &quot;Come with me, Dear.&quot; 
He did. The elevator door opened and they stepped in. She pushed 'L' for lobby
  and as the doors slid shut she said, &quot;Where you coming to meet me?&quot; 
He was stunned for the second time in as many minutes. This woman had seen
  him as a her and wanted to meet with him? Um her. &quot;I mean who am I?&quot; he
  thought. Did she know? What was going on? 
&quot;Yes&quot; he lied. 
&quot;Men can be a bit scary, can't they?&quot; She said with a slow sexy
  smile. 
&quot;Yes.&quot; 
She slid an arm tentatively around his waist. The warmth that it radiated.
  The sensuous luxury which flowed from it tantalized him. She leaned closer
  and nuzzled his ear. &quot;You are beautiful, my dear,&quot; she said, &quot;Shall
  we have a drink to loosen you up?&quot; And she kissed him on the lips. A wild
  wet sensuous tingling kiss. Lipstick on lipstick! More sensual and erotic than
  he could have ever imagined. She pulled back, smiled. &quot;I think I may have
  found heaven&quot;, she said. 
? FIVE ? 
The doors opened and he found himself in the lobby of the hotel. People were
  at the desk. Others were just coming into the lobby from the night. They all
  stared at him. Or them. What a sight they must make. 
The reality of where he was and how he was dressed came crashing in on him.
  What the hell was he doing!? He could feel every eye in the lobby on him as
  he crossed it. Or was it her? Them together? Walking with their arms around
  each others waists. A transvestite and a sex goddess. What a sight they must
  be. 
He took another quick glance around the room. Yes they were all stopped in
  their tracks. Some Encino housewife was pestering her husband to close his
  mouth and stop drooling. And as they continued through the lobby, he tried
  to shrink into nothingness. To disappear from the face of the earth. His embarrassment
  rose quickly to his face and even through the make-up he turned red. 
She steered him into the bar and to a table by the window. As they sat down,
  she leaned close and whispered, &quot;You are very beautiful. They are staring
  because we are quite a pair. Two incredibly sexy woman. Either of us could
  stop traffic alone. But together...Well, we are quite a stunning sight. Just
  watch what happens next.&quot; 
And exactly on cue the waitress came over to them and put two white wines
  down before them. &quot;Compliments of the gentlemen at the bar,&quot; she
  said, indicating with her head. He looked and his gaze was met by two young
  guys smiling and staring at them. They raised their glasses. 
She turned his head gently back to the table with her hand. 
&quot;I am Alexandra. My friends call me Alex.&quot; 
&quot;Pleased to meet you,&quot; he said quietly afraid his voice would give
  him away. He stared around the room. Yes, everyone was  looking at
  them. As his gaze would meet theirs they would glance away, or worse, raise
  their glass and give a smile. 
&quot;And you are?&quot; 
�I am�� What do I call myself, he thought. He had never named this incarnation
  of himself. &quot;Heather.&quot; Heather? Why not? Yes. &quot;Heather&quot; 
He leaned back and crossed his legs. She leaned closer and under the cover
  of the table, lightly stroked his knee sending waves of electric chills all
  over him and ending in his sex. 
Alex raised her glass, &quot;To women.&quot; She sipped it and he sipped his.
  He felt the warmth of the liquid travel down. He relaxed a bit and took another
  sip. Before he knew it his glass was empty and he was feeling a bit more 'normal'. 
Alex said in a low sultry voice, &quot;You are a stunning girl, my Heather.&quot; 
He replied, &quot;You are the stunning one, Alex. I wish I was you.&quot; 
&quot;Why?&quot; she asked. But before he could answer, the waitress was hovering
  over him again and putting two more glasses of wine on the table. &quot;With
  the compliments of the two gentlemen over by the fireplace,&quot; she said. 
Alex and Heather looked and two good-looking guys by the fireplace raised
  their glasses in a toast to them, smiling. 
&quot;And so it goes,&quot; Alex said. 
Heather didn't have time to think about it. It was all happening just too
  fast. Too wonderful. Too much like a fantasy. 
The guys came over to the table and asked if they could sit. &quot;What do
  you think, Heather?&quot; she asked. 
&quot;Um. Sure I suppose,&quot; Heather replied, not sure how to get out of
  this. It was now getting scary again. Could they tell? Could anybody tell? 
&quot;I'm Mark and this is Dan,&quot; the dark haired one said. 
Alex replied, &quot;This is Heather and I'm Alex.&quot; 
&quot;You girls are very beautiful&quot; Dan said as he turned to Heather. 
&quot;Thanks,&quot; said Alex. &quot;Would you excuse us for a moment. Powder
  our noses you know.&quot; She rose and pulled Heather with her. Once in the
  relative safety of the powder room Alex turned to Heather and said, &quot;Are
  you interested in these guys?&quot; 
&quot;No. Absolutely not,&quot; He said. &quot;Listen. I've got to tell you
  something.&quot; 
&quot;I know,&quot; Alex replied. &quot;You are good, but not that good, Girl.
  I knew from the first kiss. Your pores. Too big. Easy to fix. You do make an
  absolutely incredible looking sexy woman and the perfect solution for my special
  addiction. Women. God, I love women.&quot; 
He was stunned yet again. 
&quot;Come on. Let's at least have fun with these guys. You know, tease them
  with a little smile, a little cleavage. Drive 'em crazy, and then leave 'em
  to their own devices.&quot; 
&quot;I don't know. I've never been out before. How do I act? What do I do?
  How is my voice?&quot; 
She looked at him with hot lust in her eyes. She pulled him to her and embraced
  him. 
&quot;My baby,&quot; She kissed him with those sensual luscious lips of hers. &quot;My
  sexy little girl. I'll teach you all you ever need to know.&quot; 
Her embrace was electric. The chills. The waves of sensuous pleasure caressing
  his body. Clouding his mind. Her smell filled him. He became drunk on her.
  This woman. This stranger who knew his darkest deepest secret. And it was O.K. 
She forced her tongue into his mouth, prying his teeth apart. Taking him.
  Being the aggressor. A huge jolt of power made him shudder. She felt it and
  played him like a fine instrument. He surrendered to her. A lick, a nibble,
  a caress. She ran her hands down his back to his butt. He swooned. She continued.
  He let his head fall back, his hair dropping even lower to tickle new areas
  of his bare back. She let one of her hands roam to his erect nipples. Lightly.
  Back and forth. Feeling it's hardness. And then a pinch. He moaned and felt
  his body ripple with pure sexual thrills. He was a woman in this moment. He was  a
  woman. 
She gathered up his head and brought it close to her neck. &quot;We have two
  very eager gentlemen at our table. Should we return or go up to the Penthouse?&quot; 
He opened his eyes slowly. Pulled back to see her incredible face and said, &quot;I
  am completely yours. Do with me as you will...&quot; 
She said, &quot;First to lose the guys. Then to the Penthouse.&quot; She fixed
  her make-up and his too, then, they went back into the bar to thank the guys,
  tease them with the promise of a maybe, and then say their apologies. 
When Alex began to make their excuses, Danny began to stroke Heather's arm
  and shoulder with a sad look in his eyes like he'd just missed Christmas. And
  as they exited the bar Heather could feel every eye in the place on then. On
  these two stunning women. One of which was him! 
? SIX ? 
Richard was in heaven. He was crossing the lobby and getting into an elevator
  with the most beautiful woman he had ever even dreamt of. And he was dressed
  as a woman too. Not a clumsy drag queen. Not an embarrassing guy pretending
  to be woman which everyone but he can see. No. He WAS a woman. A desirable,
  beautiful, sexy woman! Alex proved it. The guys in the bar proved it. Everyone
  in this lobby who was clocking them proved it. 
The elevator ride up to the penthouse was matched only by the rise in his
  nervous energy. His sexual tension. His complete attraction to this woman.
  No. His total addiction to this women. 
As the elevator doors closed, Alex pinned him against the wall and kissed
  him again. Again her tongue snaked into his mouth sending shivers of pleasure
  up and down his spine. She gently but firmly forced her knee between his legs.
  Her nylon stocking rubbing against his, forcing his legs apart. The slippery
  sensation electrifying him still further. She lowered her kiss, slowly, until
  she was licking and teasing his nipple, which she gently exposed with her long
  slender hand, keeping him pinned in the corner of the elevator. 
He was experiencing the most intense feelings of his life. They weren't quite
  all male. They weren't centered in his cock, but were running rampant all through
  his body like wildfire, generally centering on his nipples and pelvic area.
  Rings of hot and cold. Emanating out, overlapping. He trembled and was becoming
  weak in the knees. 
&quot;This must be what it feels like,&quot; he thought as he continued to
  fall into this magical oblivion. 
She released him to his disappointment. Stood back and smiled a knowing smile.
  That she had him totally. That she was fulfilling his fantasies. That this
  gorgeous female creature, with a cock, was completely hers. The power. The
  thrill. The realization of her own private fantasies. 
He remained frozen in the position she had pinned in him: arms behind his
  back, legs apart, eyes closed, least he break the spell. She ran her long slender
  fingers lightly down his arms, from his bare shoulders to his hands. Then,
  outlining his tiny waist and flaring hips, she brought them down further. Down
  his shapely thighs, the backs of his knees, his calves and then slowly up the
  inside of his legs and thighs. Slowly, deliberately pushing his skirt up. Gently,
  lightly caressing as her fingertips rose closer to his crotch. Wave after wave
  of sensuous energy mounting until he thought he would scream out. Pressure
  building. 
Her red polished finger nails glancing across his crotch, continuing up over
  his stomach. Gently circling his breasts through his clothes. Tracing his collarbone,
  the sides of his neck. Finally, firmly holding his head, eyes still closed,
  experiencing this ultimate erotic sensation, and culminating with her soft
  lips caressing his face. Kissing his eyelids, his nose, his lips. Tongue once
  again forcing his mouth open and snaking in, as her hands dropped to tingle
  his nipples, her stocking sheathed leg sliding up and down the insides of his
  thighs, pressuring his crotch at the top. 
He thought he would die of the pure, powerful, sensuous, erotic, fantasy come
  true, pleasure. To say he was swooning would be a gross understatement. What
  he was feeling was just too powerful to describe. Too personal to explain.
  He was totally taken up in his fantasy that this woman somehow seemed to know
  intimately. 
The elevator bell chimed and the doors opened. Alex gently guided him to the
  penthouse. Once inside she turned to him and said, &quot;We have only just
  begun, My Love.&quot; 
? SEVEN ? 
She led him by the hand into the dining room. A large dark polished wood table
  in the center. The room was dark with a warm smokiness which crept away from
  the yellowed light flickering from the candelabra. 
She spun him gently. &quot;Now where were we?&quot; she purred. She pulled
  him to her as she leaned back against the table. Her beautiful bare arms wrapping
  around his tiny waist, her long sexy legs squeezing his legs together. Nylon
  on nylon. Electric chills. A kiss. Long. Deep. Erotically sensual. Colors exploding
  in his brain as his temperature rose, his heart thumped and his sex throbbed. 
She put his hands behind his back and held them there with one surprisingly
  strong hand, wrists crossed. &quot;I know you. I love you.&quot; She reached
  up with her free hand and began to stroke his nipple. 
He was overcome. His head fell back. His breathing became deeper, a moan escaped
  his lips. 
&quot;Yes My Darling. Indulge yourself.&quot; 
She released his wrists and lightly began to trace his torso. She licked his
  exposed nipple lightly. He shuddered. She licked it again while her hand danced
  over his thighs. He quaked with the physical sensations. He thought he would
  cum. He was so close, yet not like any other time he could remember. Deeper.
  Stronger. But how could he? She hadn't even touched his cock that was still
  tucked between his legs. 
She pressed the wide flat part of her warm tongue against his breast. Gently.
  Up and down and up and down and he was racked with pleasure. Weak knees, trembles,
  gasped breaths. Erotic. Enticing. Incredible. 
And she stopped suddenly. �No, no, my Sweet,� she whispered, her hot breath
  kissing his ear, �Come with me.� 
She led him into the bedroom. Pushed him down onto the bed. Pulled his heels
  off and messaged his feet. Slowly, sensually. For a long time she rubbed and
  soothed him, working her way from his feet over his ankles, caves, thighs,
  crotch. She pulled off his skirt. Un-zipped his top, threw out his breast forms
  and really began to play him. 
Her rubbing became nibbling and licking, tongue teasing. His crotch. His nipples.
  His neck and ears. Long deep kisses. 
Time had long ago stopped for him. He could not believe this incredible woman
  and what she was teaching him to feel. Making him feel. He tried to return
  some of the attention to her, but she forced his hands or mouth away as she
  continued. �Lie back. Just let Heather come out.� 
She pulled his stockings off and produced two belts from under the bed with
  which she bound his wrists to his thighs. With another belt she bound his ankles
  together and then blindfolded him. 
This sent him to the next level of sensual eroticism. To be a woman with another
  beautiful sexy woman who had tied him up ...Oh God!!!! A fantasy come to life!
  And he was feeling everything he had dreamed he would and more. She was tuned
  into his nervous system and played each ending to its fullest potential. 
She tingled, licked his bare legs. Always stopping just short of his crotch
  or going around it. She was driving him mad with desire. Desire for her. Desire
  to cum. Desire to be a woman ... always! 
Finally she pulled her own skirt up revealing her hairless sex, nestled between
  her garter straps, which were attached to her stockings. She straddled him
  and on her knees worked her way up until her crotch was just above his mouth. &quot;Now
  my darling.&quot; is all she said and he didn't hesitate. He gently licked
  her wet sex, a long slow lick that sent shivers up her spine. She moaned, &quot;Yes.&quot; He
  probed her with his tongue to find her spot. &quot;Ooohhhh, yes.&quot; He licked
  deeper. He circled her lips. She squeezed him with her legs. He could feel
  her as a woman would feel her. 
He licked, nibbled and kissed her like a woman. Like a woman who knows what
  a woman loves, what a woman feels, what a woman needs. She moaned and squeezed
  him and took short gasping breaths. She leaned all the way back sinking into
  her own world, teasing her own nipples and moaning. He brought her to climax
  after climax. She shrieked and moaned and finally pulled away from him. Exhausted
  she fell sleepily next to him and he loved it. 
She groggily promised, &quot;We're not through yet. My beautiful Heather.
  I think you have earned something special.&quot; 
? NINE ? 
When he woke up, it seemed like it had all been a dream. 
He was alone in bed. He was in a hotel room. His hotel room. Could it just
  have been a really good dream? A very real dream? 
Last night. Mmmmmmm. A dream come true. Fantastic. The whole thing was just
  unbelievable but had it happened? He wished that he could dream it again. Be
  a woman again for just one more night. Feel those feelings again. He had loved
  it and it had been more than he had ever believed it could be. 
He sat ruminating for a long time. Finally, it was time to get dressed and
  leave he supposed. No need to spend the weekend here. He could just go home. 
But wait. On the dresser was a single long stemmed red rose. And a note. 
&quot;Heather, my love, 
You are truly a beautiful woman. 
If you enjoyed last night then please come and meet me again tonight. Same
  time. Same place. 
Love, Alex&quot; 
He was very excited. He could hardly believe that it had been real. That he
  hadn't dreamed all those things but had actually lived them! 
The rest of the day he spent on cloud nine. He soaked in a bubble bath, shaved,
  primped, powdered, perfumed and made up. 
Unfortunately he only owned that one outfit. He realized that he would need
  another but was afraid to go out into the real world dressed as a woman to
  buy them. Not in broad daylight. And this one outfit had taken him years to
  assemble. 
He watched television, ordered room service with wine and waited for the day
  to pass. 
And slowly it did pass. After what seemed like hours he decided he could at
  least go window shopping. He got dressed and walked down to the main shopping
  area and wandered about. 
He saw a few things in windows that he liked, here and there: A body suit
  made of almost see through knit lemae; an artist's blouse in silk; a great
  black dress, turtle necked and sleeveless, very tight; a form fitting black
  leather jump suit with lots of zippers; thigh-high black leather spike heeled
  boots; a linen business suit, skirt and matching jacket with a nipped in waist;
  pleated kilt skirt; He even found a rubber shop that had the sexiest latex
  body top and skirt. 
If only he could buy any of it. He signed deeply and stared into the window
  of one of the shops. If only... 
&quot;Why not,&quot; Alex said. 
Started, he turned to find she was standing beside him. 
&quot;Why not just go in and buy what you'd like?&quot; 
&quot;I, ah, I...I, um. What size do I wear?&quot; he asked trying to recover.
  Her beauty was even more powerful in the light of day. He was lost in her gaze:
  those deep green eyes. Pools of infinite calm, yet a fire was clearly present
  in them. 
&quot;Depends on the maker. Come on, Let's go in.&quot; And she took his arm
  and guided him into the shop. 
Some time later they left the shop with several bags in tow. &quot;Gifts for
  the wife,&quot; the store clerks assumed� he hoped. 
She lightly kissed him and said, &quot;See you later ... Sweetheart.&quot; And
  she was gone as quickly as she had appeared. 
He returned to the hotel buoyant. Lots of new things and best of all, he now
  had a fair idea of how to go about buying more. 
As a matter of fact, after trying on all the things he had bought, and loving
  it, he went out and purchased more! Lingerie, Bras, stockings and even a latex
  number that fit so tight and felt so good he could hardly conceal his growing
  erection. 
Back to the hotel for a late afternoon fashion show! A quick meal. Another
  bubble bath and a nap and then...

Back to the hotel for a late afternoon fashion show! A quick meal. Another
  bubble bath and a nap and then... 
? TEN ? 
At ten-thirty he was in the bar, sitting at a table, dressed in one of her
  new outfits. Alone. He felt magnificent in her skin-tight, zip down, knit-top
  and red plaid &amp; pleated skirt, which stopped a generous amount above her
  knees so as to show off her beautiful long legs. 
At 10:33 the waiter set a drink down in front of him and indicated a guy over
  at the bar, who toasted and smiled at him. 
The fear that had once (only yesterday) kept him from appearing in public
  as a woman immediately blossomed into an all consuming paranoia. The old questions
  suddenly bloomed and badgered him. Dressed as a woman and in a public bar.
  His business associates could very possibly be in this bar� at this very moment! 
&quot;Have to get out of here. Must leave!&quot; his mind screamed. 
He stood to leave and the guy who had sent the drink over cornered him at
  the table. 
&quot;Hi. My name's Ted. Mind if I join you?&quot; 
He (Heather) was stunned. He was afraid to speak, lest his voice give him
  away. He was afraid to let this guy join him, lest he be found out. The moment
  seemed to hang in the air for eternity, when, from nowhere, Alex appeared. 
&quot;Ted. I see you've all ready met Heather. Won't you join us?&quot; 
The events began to swirl in Heather's mind as Ted sat down at the table. &quot;Big
  mistake! Don't let him sit down with us,&quot; he heard somewhere in the back
  of his head. Heather crossed his long shapely legs. Ted gave a long admiring
  look at them, then shook himself out of it. 
&quot;You didn't tell me she was this beautiful, Alex,&quot; Ted scolded good
  naturally. 
. 
&quot;I didn't have to. And would you have believed me anyway?&quot; Alex
  asked with assured confidence. 
&quot;No. I guess not,&quot; he replied. &quot;So Heather, What do you do?&quot; 
&quot;I...I'm in copiers,&quot; he stuttered, still stunned. He looked at
  Ted more closely. He was tall, muscular in build, dark short hair, expensive
  suit. Armani. Good taste. �Whoa! I am checking this guy out!!!??� 
'But I'm a confirmed lesbian', Heather thought as she/he began to relax just
  a bit. 
&quot;That is she is presently in copiers. She is considering coming to work
  for me,&quot; Alex interjected. 
Heather looked to Alex for a clue; but instead was once again swept away with
  her intense beauty. Her perfect shape. Her swelling, luscious breasts. Her
  long beautiful legs. Her tiny waist, deep green eyes and long luscious auburn
  hair. He became totally lost in her, as always. 
Ted took advantage of Heather's apparent confusion to slip his arm around
  her shoulders. 
He turned to stare at Ted with bewilderment. Things were out of control. Going
  fast. Through the haze, as if coming from a far distance, he thought he heard
  Alex saying good night. Good Night!? His attention snapped back to his present
  situation just as Ted was pulling her chair out for her. Was this all in his
  imagination? 
As Heather stood, Ted put his arm around her again and pulled her close to
  him. Alex leaned in to kiss her good-bye and whispered in her ear, &quot;This
  is a test. Pass it my Love. Come to the penthouse when your date is over.&quot; And
  she was gone, abandoning him to Ted's care and firm grasp. 
Ted gently guided Heather out of the bar and into the hotel elevator. As soon
  as the doors closed and the elevator began to rise, Ted pulled Heather into
  a tight embrace and kissed her. Long and deep and on the mouth. Heather was
  disgusted. She resisted, but couldn't withdraw. Ted's embrace was very tight.
  He nibbled her ear, his hot breath tickling her neck. His strong arms pinning
  her arms to her sides. Finally she could do nothing but surrender. She tentatively
  kissed back. Still disgusted, but not as much. She closed her eyes and surrendered
  more. Then something rippled all through her body. A chill, goose bumps, a
  cold hot wave. A mass tingle. She didn't know exactly what, but it was something
  major. Something cataclysmic. And then everything changed� maybe forever! 
When the doors opened on Ted's floor, they were still kissing. He did not
  release her from his embrace and the doors closed again. He gently pushed her
  arms behind her back and leaned against her, pinning her arms behind her. He
  began to lightly caress her thigh through her stockings. Rising slowly but
  surely to her crotch. Sending out the same wondrous sensations as Alex had
  the night before in almost the very same situation. 
She shuddered again then swooned. Everything in her body tingled with hot
  cascading erotic sensation - against her will! She could feel something drawing
  her inexplicably towards him. Forcing her to return his kiss deeply and passionately.
  She fought it but lost when his hands lightly graced her inner thighs, close
  to the top of her legs, close to the �Garden of Eden.' She surrendered finally
  and completely. Whatever Ted had in mind� it was OK with her. 
The next thing she knew, she was in another luxury suite, staring up at the
  ceiling and not knowing how she got there. 
? ELEVEN ? 
She remembered the magnificent kiss, the lightly creeping hand sliding slowly
  up her thigh, under her skirt, and then...well here she was. 
She moved to swing her legs to the ground and was shocked to find that they
  were tied together. Her arms were tied together and to something above her
  head. She wriggled and discovered that she was still clothed but completely
  immobile. There were bonds holding her waist, head, knees and shoulders in
  position 
Ted floated into her field of view. &quot;God! You are beautiful. But even
  beauty must be tamed,&quot; he said. 
He sat next to her and lightly stroked her breasts. Heather was very afraid
  and surprised that his light strokes on his phony breasts were sending incredibly
  intense sensuous waves throughout her body causing her to squirm a bit. She
  tried to raise her head to see what was happening and saw that Ted was stoking
  her through her top. How could she be feeling these feelings? 
Ted's hands moved down her torso, thighs, legs and removed her high heeled
  shoes. He focused his attention on her feet and Heather responded as if he
  was the master of sensation, of erotica. She writhed in pleasure, squirmed
  with intense erotic sensation. She lost herself to him for the second time
  that night. 
He played her first from her feet and then moved to her breasts. He slowly,
  sensuously, unzipped her top and began to suckle her breasts. Firm, beautifully
  shaped breasts with electric nipples, sending deep, intense and wonderful waves
  of new sensual over-powering pleasure through her. 
&quot;BEAUTIFULLY SHAPED BREASTS!!&quot; Heather's mind screamed out. On him...her!?
  His?! What!? She had to look again, to fight her way through these erotic tidal
  waves of pleasure, strain against the bonds, and look at what he thought she
  felt. Heather raised her head as far as she could, straining, slowly opening
  her eyes while gasping from the sensations Ted was creating in her, and saw
  two perfectly shaped, medium sized breasts rising from his chest where the
  forms should have been! 
Ted licked one of the exposed nipples playfully causing her to throw her head
  back and gasp out loud at the intense pleasure. Ted pinched the other lightly,
  rolling the nipple between his fingers. 
&quot;Oh my Gosh!&quot; Heather screamed inside her head, &quot;Yes. Never
  stop.&quot; 
But Ted worked his way back down to her feet, tantalizing every square inch
  of her body on the way. Heather was lightly sweating with the effort of straining
  against her bonds as she writhed from the sheer ecstasy of it all. The feelings,
  sensations. Ripping and crashing waves of erotic, electric sensations, causing
  her hips to thrust into the air uncontrollably against her bonds. 
Ted grabbed her ankles and pulled himself up her, slowly, licking her legs
  through her stockings. Slowly he climbed her, coming closer and closer to her
  garden of delight. 
Heather began to quietly panic as Ted came closer and closer to discovering
  that she had no 'garden of pleasure' but instead a large, erect surprise. 
Ted's hands rose under her skirt and pushed it up around her waist. He pulled
  her panties down with his teeth and ... very slowly ... very deliberately ...
  very lightly let his wide, warm tongue slide over Heather's sex. Sending new
  and even more intense waves of pleasure, causing Heather to moan her pleasure
  out loud . 
He licked her again, slightly deeper but still gently. Heather writhed violently,
  hips shooting into the air as she half gasped, half shouted out. He licked
  again, slowly, with a widened tongue so as to hit all her areas. He dragged
  its moist, soft surface, its perfectly tuned texture slowly over her sex until
  it touched her clitoris. 
Heather lost all control. She had never felt anything like this. Nothing so
  all persuasive, all controlling, completely intense and so very wonderful.
  She cried out. Guttural panting, screaming and moaning. 
Ted continued his slow, maddening licks. And she was driven deeper and deeper
  into her private ecstasy. Just as she thought it couldn't get any more intense,
  he reached up with both hands; one stroked her breast, the sensation of which
  combined with is tongue forced her into all out shrieking/moaning, the other
  hand forced its fingers into her mouth and she tasted something warm, sticky
  and salty. She lapped it up eagerly, silencing her, even as her uncontrollable
  pelvis continued its thrusts into the air. 
She desperately wanted to open her legs to him, to have him inside her but
  she couldn't separate them even an inch. Instead she begged him, through his
  fingers to put his cock in her mouth. 
He stopped everything and left the room. Heather was afraid that she had done
  something wrong. And then it hit her. She seemed to be missing her own cock!
  Either that or Ted was really good with his mouth. She once again lifted her
  head as far up as she could to see and, ignoring her new breasts, tried to
  see her crotch. She could not see her cock from this angle. 
Before she had any time to begin to wonder, Ted returned, released some of
  her bonds, but not the major ones, and forced a ball gag into her mouth. As
  he tightened it behind her head he told her not to worry but to just lay back
  and enjoy. Then he undid the straps holding her still bound arms and feet to
  the bed, rolled her over, pulled her knees off the bed and very slowly began
  to massage her juicy sex with his deft touch until she was moaning through
  her gag. 
When she could no longer stand the pleasure, when she thought she would die
  for it all, when she could not even imagine that anything could feel this good,
  she quaked and erupted with a completely unexpected orgasm the depth and strength
  of which she had never ever dreamt of. She thrashed and writhed and screamed
  into her gag until her body when rigid, every sweaty muscle straining against
  each other, poised on the peak of the mountain, and then collapsed. 
Panting heavily, she slowly opened her eyes as Ted began to kiss her neck
  gently and repeatedly. 
And then she felt it for the first time. An erect cock knocking at her sex
  from behind. Ever so slowly, it penetrated her, sliding gently into her bit
  by bit and sending new sensual waves through her exhausted body. 
Ted murmured into her ear, &quot;Your tiny waist and sweet, sweet breasts
  are mine. Your cavern of pleasure is just for me tonight.&quot; 
And he slid his cock all the way into her and began to slowly pump it out
  and in. He reached around her chest and began to lightly message her breasts
  and she began to ripple with erotic sensations. Sensations she had never known
  before. Sensations a thousand times more intense than even last night. Her
  new breasts controlled her while the cock sliding in and out of her, filling
  her and retreating, slowly building another mountain of ecstasy. 
And then she was shocked to realize that his sex was pumping in and out of
  her differently than the one from last night. A different and much more intensely
  erotic and sensual feeling. Not like last night. This was feeling tremendously,
  intensely, incredibly more wonderful. Closer to her pubic bone, not towards
  her ass. In and out, he continued and she was swept away from her wonderings
  by the sheer power of the sensations. 
And this continued until she was forcing her hips back against his. Until
  she was straining and tensing with the impending orgasm. Building bigger and
  bigger with each passing second until she was begging him through her gag to
  make her cum. Make her fall into the deep cavern of love, lost in the waves
  of pleasure. 
And he kept pumping her, faster and faster, kept tingling her breasts until
  she was screaming into her gag to push her over the edge. 

And then she felt the first strong spurt of warm, luscious liquid, burning
  deep into her depts. And she once again rocked uncontrollably with the wave
  after wave of gigantic orgasm, tensing her and controlling her completely.
  All she could do was scream her joy into her gag and let it happen. Until it
  was over� all to soon for her� and they both collapsed into a sweaty heap. 
? TWELVE ? 
When she awoke it was still dark outside and she was alone. She rolled onto
  her back and stretched. What a great dream she had this time! But wait. It
  was no dream, was it? She looked down at herself and the two magnificent breasts
  were still there. Her crotch was smooth and when she felt for her cock it was
  gone! How could this be?! What had happened? 
She was panicked! Scared! And then suddenly ecstatic! This was not a dream!?
  She jumped up and ran into the bathroom to look at herself in the mirror. What
  she saw stopper her cold in her tracks. There, in the mirror before her, she
  saw an incredibly beautiful auburn haired woman. Petite little waist, long
  luscious legs, magnificent breasts and a face of intense beauty. Oh she could
  still see her old self in there, but now he was beautiful. 
She looked around the suite to find Ted but he wasn't there. Just the thought
  of Ted made her want to do things to him she would have never even thought
  she could before. To tie him up and pleasure him! To lightly run her hands
  over his body. Lick his long velvety hard sex. Mmmmm. 
She got dressed and looked at herself in the mirror for a long time. Waiting
  for Ted to return. Studying her sensuous curves, her full sexy lips, long slender
  neck, enticing shoulders and arms, and those hips! She loved herself very much.
  She would have loved to make love to herself � her old self and her new incredible
  self. 
She looked at the clock: 1:30 AM. She began to touch herself sensuously. Erotically.
  MMMMmmmmmmm. She thought of Alex. MMMmmmmm. How sweet to make love to her!
  Yes! She decided to go to the penthouse and see her. Her wet sex throbbed for
  her. 
She knocked on the door. Waited. Knocked again. Finally, it opened. Slowly.
  Revealing not Alex, not Ted, and not one but two very, very beautiful women
  wearing nothing but black thigh-high, very high heeled boots and shoulder length
  black gloves. They both were wearing very thick and black eye make-up and a
  thin silver chain around their waists which had another thin silver chain coming
  down the front and disappearing between their sex lips. 
They motioned Heather into the room. The suite was dark and her eyes took
  their time becoming adjusted to it. 
She heard Alex before she could see her. Those soft sweet moans, echoing through
  the empty halls. Heavy breathing and the sound of love making seeping from
  somewhere. 
The two girls came up behind Heather silently, each taking her by an arm,
  and leading her into another darkened room, lit only by a single candle. As
  Heather's eyes adjusted she could make out, she thought, many people, naked,
  spread-eagled against the wall. Or was it just the wallpaper pattern. The girls
  began to unzip her front, revealing her new breasts. One of them locked her
  mouth Heather's nipple sending a shock of electricity straight to her crotch
  and causing goose bumps to rise all over her body. The other girl attached
  Heather's wrists to something and then walked away. 
Heather was lost, enthralled with; the sensations ricocheting around inside
  her body from the first girl's mouth on her breast. She quivered with sensation,
  quaked with the passion that was building so suddenly within her. She felt
  her arms rising, being pulled up and apart by the attachments. 
The second girl came back and proceeded to cut the top off her upper torso.
  Then undo the skirt from her waist, leaving Heather standing in only her garter,
  stockings and pumps. The first girl buckled straps to Heather's ankles and
  disappeared into the shadows. Heather stood still, realizing for the first
  time that she was naked in the room and in the process of being pulls spread-eagle
  by the ever tightening chains attached to her cuffs. 
&quot;No.&quot; she said with little conviction. 
Her arms continued being pulled upward. Her ankles being pulled apart. She
  knew she was being spread-eagled like the pattern on the wall. She tried to
  get free but was soon being held in position - tautly and securely. 
The first girl returned to licking and sucking Heather's nipples. The second
  girl came up behind her and gently but firmly slid a butt-pug into her. Cool
  and greasy it slid home filling her up. Next she slid a dildo into her all
  ready dripping sex. And then she fastened a slim silver chair around Heather's
  waist and ran the chain through both the dildo and butt-plug, fastening it
  to the back of the waist chain. 
Heather struggled futilely, fighting off the sensations and eventually losing
  to them when the dildo came to life and began to move and vibrate inside her.
  Her struggling became writhing. Her protests became moans. And she became completely
  lost in the sensuous situation. 
She did not know how long it was before she erupted convulsively, long and
  hard, in the throws of another deep orgasm that went on for hours, days, weeks. 
And when it was over she hung limply from her bindings, sweaty and exhausted.
  But it was not long before the dildo began its machinations again, forcing
  her to begin quaking and writhing all over, deeper, quivering and shaking with
  the building erotic waves of sensuous, tingling, powerful waves. She was performing
  a dance. A dance to the erotic gods of sensation. 
It wasn't too long before she hung limply again, panting, sweaty and very
  happy. 
&quot;Hmmm. What do you say now?&quot; Alex asked stepping from the shadows.
  Walking around Heather, dragging her finger across Heather's back, around her
  ribs and across her erect nipples. 
Heather flinched first from the sound of her voice and then from the fingernail
  across her nipples. &quot;I love it. But how did all this...&quot; 
&quot;Let's just say I know how to pick 'em, shall we,&quot; Alex purred. &quot;I
  know a thing or two about what true desire and the right body can do with a
  little help.&quot; She smiled a deeply sensuous smile at Heather. Alex's hands
  rose to Heather's displayed breasts and began to play with them while she talked. &quot;Do
  you want to know what this will cost you? This 'dream come true'?&quot; 
Heather was becoming distracted again by the sensations. Alex played her so
  well. She remembered that from last night. So well. 
&quot;Ohhh,&quot; she panted between waves of pleasure, &quot;anything you
  want. Anything &lt;moan&gt; you want &lt;moan&gt;. MMmmmmmmmmanything you ask
  of me&quot;. 
The dildo came to life again and Heather began to writhe and dance as she
  hung/stood in the room. Alex fixed her mouth on a breast and added into the
  building pleasure. Heather moaned loudly and bucked wildly. Her moans growing
  into long screams of sex. Alex reached down and began to stroke Heather's clitoris. 
Immediately Heather screamed as she came hard, violently, powerfully. She
  came again and again, all the while Alex played her nipples and clitoris, orchestrating
  each successive orgasm, bigger, larger and more powerful than the last. When
  Heather thought she could stand no more, when she thought she would die of
  pleasure, when she thought her entire body would surely go numb from it all... 
Alex grabbed the dildo and pumped it in and out while continuing to lick and
  suck Heather's breasts. The chain's increasing and decreasing tension against
  the butt-plug forced it in and out in syncopation with the dildo. Heather shouted
  out her orgasm to the universe. Long, hard and loud, second after second, minute
  after minute , seemingly hour after hour, until she fainted. 
? THIRTEEN ? 
Heather woke with a start. Alex's two girls were waving smelling salts under
  her nose. The pungent smell snapped Heather's head back. She tried to cover
  her mouth as she coughed but could not as she was still tied spread-eagle. 
&quot;Ahhh. Too much, too soon,&quot; Alex stated. 
&quot;No, no. Please. Oh God. Oh God, no. Its ... its never too much,&quot; Heather
  said with her new deep velvety voice. 
&quot;Well, now that I've got your attention, do you want to know what's going
  on,&quot; Alex asked? 
She slowly walked around her bound beauty, still strung tautly before her.
  She tugged at the waist chain as she spoke sending new waves of sexual surges
  through Heather, who threw her head back to feel it all deeper.. 
&quot;The drink I sent you last night? It did this,&quot; Alex said as she
  indicated Heather's magnificent body. &quot;It and something else. Something
  that no one believes when I tell them. 
&quot;What has happened to you? Well, you have your wish, that's what. You
  are a sexy, beautiful woman now. Lovely in every respect. A Woman in every
  respect, except�&quot; Alex tugged the chain again causing a low moan to seep
  out of Heather. 
&quot;One: You are not able to become pregnant. No children will come forth
  from you. No period. A double edged sword, as you will eventually see.&quot; Alex
  pointed with a special gesture and both black booted girls began to suck Heather's
  breasts. Heather again threw her head back, her long Auburn hair matted with
  sweat against her body shook free to fall half way down her smooth slender
  back. 
&quot;Two: Your mind is still your mind. That is male, at the basic level.
  That means you will begin to see that being a woman is a bit harder than you
  fantasized. A few walls will become evident before you as your male ego tries
  to succeed. You may eventually wish to become male again. But there I can not
  and will not help you.&quot; And she pumped the dildo several times throwing
  Heather into a frenzy of twitches, moans and groans, and pelvic grinds. 
&quot;You see, I was a lesbian trapped in a male body too. Don't be surprised,
  because you are exactly like me. The same burning dream coloring your entire
  life. I saw it as if it was a bright flame on the balcony that night. A beacon
  to those that can see. When you walked out there to drink in the night �en
  femme' it was like pouring fresh blood before a Vampire's door. You called
  out to me in your own way� like many before you have. And like many more will
  do. And now you have the same beauty, the same body and almost even the same
  face. The only real difference is your face looks a bit like you and mine looks
  a bit like me. 
With that she kissed the stunned Heather on the lips and gave a pull of the
  chain. Heather's hips rocketed forward as her eyes closed with the pleasure. 
&quot;Yes, sex will always be this good and you will always want it. Anyway
  you can. And that is where this whole scheme comes together, for you. I can
  help you there... for a small price. 
Heather opened her eyes as the sexual pleasure receded away from her. Her
  eyelids were thick with sensuality. &quot;What do you mean.&quot; she simply
  asked. 
&quot;I mean,&quot; Alex replied as she rested her hand on the chain, &quot;that
  you need the sex to survive. To stay female. If you stop for more than 48 hours
  you will become your old self... forever. No going back. This is a once in
  a lifetime gift I have given you� and, of course, that is the third and most
  binding way you are different from genetic females.&quot; 
The two girls were causing Heather great distraction. She was in the throws
  of a building orgasm. She wanted Alex to keep pulling the chain but was afraid
  to interrupt her to ask. Her hips began to rock of their own volition. 
Alex clapped and the two girls withdrew into the shadows. Heather was too
  close to stop now. Her body continued to writhe and pulse with the impending
  orgasm. It was with great frustration that the feeling began to ebb away. 
She slowly opened her eyes and looked at Alex. Her sensuous body so close
  she could touch it, if she wasn't bound. Her face, her legs, her waist. And
  then it sunk in: They were exactly the same. Heather and Alex - Twins. 
Heather felt pure joy well up within her as the tears began to well up in
  her eyes and she began to smile. 
&quot;Too that end, my Heather. Too that end I can supply you with all the
  sex you want and every type of sex as well, if ...if you stay with me.&quot; Alex
  smiled a small seductive smile, &quot;Stay with me. Be with me. Become one
  of my girls.&quot; 
Heather spoke for the first time. &quot;A Prostitute?&quot; 
&quot;Not a cheap Prostitute!&quot; She shouted angrily. Alex paused for a
  moment in thought, then, &quot;A sophisticated call girl at worst. And you
  will be well paid. Paid for taking your �medicine.&quot; She chuckled to herself. 
Alex then tugged the chain and Heather immediately exploded with the orgasm
  she had thought was long gone. Heather was totally and completely addicted
  to these wonderful, massive, erotic, sensual feelings� and Alex kept her going.
  The dildo and butt-plug sending wave after wave of writhing, shivering sensation
  throughout Heather's body. 
Alex brought her face close to Heather's and then kissed her. A deep, wet,
  long, passionate kiss. She stepped back and the two girls rejoined them, licking
  and biting and sucking and rubbing. 
It was too much for Heather. Her moan became gasping, shrieking, pleading
  . Finally ending in a long &quot; Yeeeesssssss!&quot; 
She whispered &quot;Yes&quot; again after she collapsed against her bonds,
  her head on Alex's shoulder. Alex kissed her again and said, &quot;Please,
  Heather, don't let this gift die. It can only work once in a person's life,
  and not for everyone. Say 'yes' one more time. And mean it. Because that is
  what you will have to do to live the rest of your life like this.&quot; 
&quot;Yes,&quot; Heather panted, &quot;Yes, yes, yes.&quot; 
Alex had Heather released from her bonds and taken to her new suite, where
  she was instructed to bath, sleep, and then pick out something to wear from
  the extensive wardrobe provided. Then she was to join them all for brunch at
  the hotel restaurant in the morning. 
Heather bathed and then got into the deep, frilly bed and tried to sleep.
  But the thoughts of what she had committed to were running around her head
  keeping awake. 
Too be a woman was wonderful. Great. A dream come true. She would never go
  back. But giving her life to Alex as a call girl? Well, maybe, for a while.
  Maybe just for a short time, until she got the hang of this. After all, Heather
  wasn't that kind of girl, was she? 
But then she realized that she was masturbating. Stroking her own body, exploring
  it sensually. Letting her hands drift lightly over her shoulders and breasts.
  Savoring the swelling mounds of flesh and tantalizing her nipples. Yes, to
  be a woman. That was the thing ... at any cost. 
She was giving herself thrills and chills as she ran her hands down her torso,
  sensing her tiny waist with the backs of her fingers and running them over
  her hips to her crotch. She squirmed with the extraordinary sensations, the
  cascading waves of erotic thrills. The expected cock was still missing and
  the breasts were magnificent, both to the eye and the touch. 
She ran her hand back up her body to her face and circled her delicate mouth,
  seeing the full lips in her head. Seeing them part for a lovely velvety hard
  cock, which pushed into her warm moist mouth just as her finger slid in in
  real life. She sucked and licked as her other hand rode the crests and valleys
  of her body. Her body. And then she touched her sex for the first time with
  the finger from her mouth. Warm, moist and slippery and her body flew into
  jerky contortions. She tried to stifle her own moans but gave into the luxuriant
  orgasm, which rushed over her like a 1000 foot tidal wave, and kept her tumbling
  in the warm infinity of its power until it gradually, slowly subsided, leaving
  her drifting into a deep peaceful sleep. 
? THE FINAL CHAPTER ? 
In the morning Heather did not appear at the brunch. Alex went to back to
  the suite to find her gone. Only a note lay on the bed that Heather had been
  sleeping in. 
Alex sat down on the bed, all ready knowing what it said without reading it:
  She had left and would not return. Thanks for the fantasy but it wasn't her,
  him. Love, so on and so on, bla-bla-bla. It had happened before. 
Not just anyone could actually handle the change. &quot;Be careful what you
  wish for because it might come true&quot;. Being a woman was harder than any
  mere transvestite might think. Harder than a cross-dresser could ever imagine.
  Even harder than a real woman could dream before she grows into one. 
Alex understood and was sad only because Heather made such a magnificent woman.
  So striking and sexy. Only lacking the confidence to pull it off with the power
  that she had. She could have had any man willing to do her bidding. To be showered
  with riches just to be seen with them. 
And the sex... yes, the change brought heightened sexual ability. Deeper more
  profound orgasms. And that intense sexuality never failed to ignite the passion
  in any partner - man or woman. A true gift. And the only thing which was more
  than any genetic woman had. 
&quot;Oh well,&quot; Alex thought, &quot;Win some, lose some. There would
  be more Heather's to add to her stable. There were many more cross-dressers
  and transvestites out there than anyone imagined. The number of business suits
  which hid bra and panties underneath. The secret dreams and fantasies of the
  masses were many and amazingly similar in the end. Yes, plenty more Heather's
  to come. 
&quot;By tomorrow night Heather would be just another guy with a secret. Running
  through his life, looking for those moments when he could dress again and fantasize,
  because you never stop. Oh you always tell yourself that you will, and you
  might for a span of time. But you can never get away from the dream. 
&quot;And to have lived it! Too have actually lived it and turned it down.
  Alex could not understand how anyone could not regret that decision. But that
  was Heather's problem not Alex's. A great gift had been given and rejected.&quot; 
Alex sighed and stood up. She straightened herself in the mirror. Fixed her
  lipstick. Struck a sexy pose for herself, laughed and walked out of the room,
  leaving the remnants of her Heather creation rumpled on the bed. 
In another part of the city, Heather, wearing a short, black-knit, sleeveless,
  turtleneck dress with a belt, sheer silky stockings and high-heel patent-leather
  pumps, walked down the street with a happy sexy swing to her step. She carried
  several bags of new purchases. 
She smiled at the men who stumbled into things as they stared at her. Ignored
  the whistles and wolf howls yelled out from the passing cars. She was feeling
  her power and glory as a handsome man ran to catch up with her carrying several
  more bags of new clothes and things. 
&quot;Heather. Would you like to get some lunch now,&quot; he asked. 
She put her arm though his and drew herself close to him. &quot;Francesco,
  we still have a few more stores to see before they close for lunch. Be a dear
  and put the bags in your limo and meet me in Tiffany's. I have always wanted
  a few little baubles from there,&quot; she paused to look at him. &quot;You
  are so wonderful to me. We've hardly known each other and you buy me all these
  presents! Well when we get to the hotel I'll just have to make it up to you
  some how, my Darling.&quot; 
Francesco watched her go. That walk of hers. That body. An Angel from heaven.
  He would give her anything in the world to keep her with him. She was so incredibly
  beautiful and sexy. And the way she made him feel� it was like a drug! 
He tossed the bags to the chauffeur and went into Tiffany's. While Heather
  was busy choosing a ring he secretly purchased her a $200,000 dollar diamond
  pendent he would hide under her pillow tonight. 
Heather chose a matching bracelet, ring and earring set. Kissed Francesco
  as they left. This was going to be easier than she had imagined. Much easier. 
And she smiled as they drove off to brunch and her new life.
