Prologue

&nbsp;

����������� When
did this begin?� Some people date it to
the end of the War, going on twenty years ago now.

����������� Me,
I date it to that day five years ago when Roger Spencer called me into his
office.� I�d been working with the
Department of Administration for four years, ever since I�d completed my course
at the Academy.

����������� I
had chosen Administration because I liked order, and I liked working with the
Citizenry.� Sometimes the two don�t
really coincide, but the last thing I wanted was to become some kind of paper-pusher,
sitting on my fat ass behind a desk every day.�
Field Work, out with the Masses � that�s for me.

����������� Anyway,
there I was, Mike Wilson � 23 years old, with brown hair, a cleft chin, and the
start of a few wrinkles around my eyes.�
No girlfriend, but then again few of us men wanted or needed a steady
woman back then.

����������� I
was sitting at my desk that morning, drinking a cup of coffee and chatting with
Jimmy, who worked down the hall in the Information Studies division.� His job was to keep an eye on underground and
radical newspapers.� Not that we talked
about work that often � he was a huge TV fan, so that Monday, as usual, the
talk focused on the latest episode of the Government Broadcasting System (GBS)
program Wife Swap � the number one
hit back in 2251.

����������� Jimmy
disagreed with me about the best part of the show.� He claimed it was when Linda got dropped off
in the alley at 12:30 AM.� Still wearing her tennis whites, it took this
rich bitch at least 10 minutes to realize that the swap she was experiencing �
from suburban trophy wife to inner city crack whore � might not be as fun as
she had thought!� 

����������� Me?� I told Jimmy he was full of it.� The best part was when the lesbian feminist
from SF got swapped to the polygamist in Utah.


����������� �She�s
going to love being Wife Number 11!�

����������� �Come
on � at least she�s got a roof over her head.�

����������� �Yeah,
I�ll give you that.� But she hates cock �
really hates it.� Linda was probably
getting it a bit at home already.�

����������� �Whatever.�

����������� Just
then the hologram console on my desk came to life, and up popped my boss�
head.� Roger Spencer was a Marine war
vet, and he looked the part still.� 53
years old, not an inch of fat, with an iron-gray crew cut and piercing brown
eyes.� 

����������� �Wilson!�
he barked.

����������� �Yessir.�� He liked his team to sound military.

����������� �You
can read Government documents, can�t you?�

����������� �Um, yessir.�� 

����������� �They
taught this to you at your fancy Academy?�
Then get in here, double-time!�

I grimaced to Jimmy and headed out
the door.� I didn�t run, because this was
our office building, but I didn�t waste time either.� As I got near to Mr. Spencer�s office, his
door swung open.� The boss must have been
watching me through one of the in-house cameras.

����������� �Get
in here, Wilson, and take a
chair.�� I sat down across from his
immaculate desk, marred today by one fat binder of papers.� �Look at this crap.�� He gestured towards the binder.� �This is the sort of thing that I have to put
up with now.�� He got a distant look in
his eyes, and I knew we were in for a reminiscence
about the days of the War.� I tried to
get in ahead of that.

����������� �What�s
in the binder, Sir?�

����������� �What�s
that?� Oh.� It�s the latest report from the Department of
Rehabilitation.�� �Rehabilitation� �
that�s what we call the department in charge of our prison system.

����������� �What
does it say, Sir?�

����������� �Our
prisons are overcrowded, Wilson.� And with the terrorist attacks still
continuing, we need to make some room.�

����������� �What
is our role in this?�

����������� �We
are the Department of Administration.�
Our job is to do the job.�� I
nodded, wondering whether the boss was being sarcastic when he repeated the
Department�s official motto.

����������� �And
what does that mean this time?�� I asked.

����������� �Simple.� We need to come up with some Alternative
Incarceration Methods, and do it by yesterday.�
We need to find a way to get the non-violent offenders out of prison.�

����������� �The Government getting soft on crime?�

����������� �No,
that�s just it.� These women still need
to be punished, just not by prison.�
Here.�� He handed me a ScanDisk.� �This is
my plan.� Go home, review it, and
tomorrow we start implementing it.�

����������� �Go
home now?�

����������� �No
time like the present.� I like you
Wilson.� If you can get on board with
this Program, you�ll go far.�

����������� So,
home I went, and what I saw that night changed not just my life, but the lives
of tens of thousands of women since.

����������� At
home in my pod, it was a simple matter to insert the ScanDisk
into my retinal feed.� I settled back
with a squeeze bag of dinner, and watched the show.

&nbsp;

����������� A
government logo faded out on the screen, to be replaced by a shot of the center
of Washington DC 150 years ago.� The
voice-over began:

����������� In the dark years before the advent
of our Glorious Leader, shameless women walked the streets of power, taunting
men with their sexuality.� Men became
weakened, and women grew in power.

����������� The
screen changed to show a montage of clips from the early 23rd Century.� By
2300, women were in the ascendant.� Our
people, blinded by the evil temptress�, were led
astray, and managed to elect a woman � Blanche Finley � to be President of the United States.

����������� Even
though I had grown up seeing her face in news reports and history books, I
still gasped at the sight of the Evil Bitch (as she was known!) being sworn in
at the old Capitol building.� The voice
over continued.� Within months of her election, funding for our military had been
slashed and destroyed.� Brave men,
warriors one and all, were cast adrift.� The
screen showed images of homeless men dressed in remnants of military
uniforms.� But among these poor, impoverished souls, arose a bright light � the
light of our Glorious Leader.

����������� I
pressed fast-forward, skipping through the bits of more recent history I knew
so well � the valiant revolution led by General Johnson � the overthrow and
execution of Evil Bitch Finley � the removal of women�s suffrage, followed by
the restrictions that banned women from most professions � then the War, and
the increased need for internal security � all around the country, women were
rounded up and given ID tags and restricted to local areas � by now we were
almost to the present day � women were removed from school at 13 years old, and
worked as domestics or day laborers until the age of 18.� At 18, they were sold as wives.� Those who did not receive offers as wives
were placed into the State Brothel System, where they worked to service unmarried
men, as well as married men who were growing bored.� Even with the reintroduction of polygamy, men
liked to wander.� Once married, women
were expected to bear three male children and two female � genders were
naturally pre-selected.� The girls were
placed in State Homes to be educated, and the boys stayed at home until Academy
Selection.� At 35, women were
automatically divorced and returned to work as domestics and day laborers.� A decent and understandable
system.

����������� Nevertheless,
according to this Disk, and my boss, the system was breaking down.� Although men were encouraged to discipline
the female members of their households, the State still played a large punitive
role.� Any serious breach � women who
refused sexual favors, who tried to escape State Brothels, or refused to be
bred � resulted in incarceration.� 

����������� While
this seemed like a reasonable solution, the end result was chaotic.� Our prisons were bursting at the seams and we
needed to find a way to leave prison for the truly wicked � women who were
caught in secret education programs, or who struck a man, or committed any
number of old-fashioned crimes such as robbery or assault.

����������� And
this was the genius of my boss� idea � an Alternative Incarceration Method
(AIM) � run by the Department of Administration.� Why lock up women who could be punished
swiftly and publicly, without the expense and bother of creating a prison
system?� 

This would be the
start of a new career for me.

&nbsp;

Chapter 1

The Chamberlain Wedding

&nbsp;

����������� So
here I was, five years later, an official AIM Facilitator for the Department of
Administration.� I had a few more
wrinkles, a few more pounds, a bigger pod, and a bright assistant named Harry Yarrel working under me.

It was a Monday,
and I came into work by Jet Pack around 8:15
to check e-mail and catch up on the weekend news.� 

First though, I
double-checked my day screen.� Sure
enough, there was the Chamberlain Wedding listed for 10 AM at City Hall Plaza.�
I loved facilitating Wedding Ceremonies � it was one of the best parts
of my new job, and, if I can boast for a minute, it was one of the areas of AIM
that I had helped develop.

Before long, a
good chunk of the morning had passed, and it was time to get changed for the
Chamberlain Wedding.� Ten minutes later,
carrying my official briefcase and wearing the white-banded collar of an Facilitator, I left the office and lined up at the
nearest Jet-Pack stop.� Even now, in
2247, the Jet Pack is still the best way to get around downtown.� Moments later, the hack at the stand was
helping me fit my arms into the straps of a fairly new Pack, and punching the
destination � City Hall
 Plaza � into the Pack�s console
device.

The familiar kick
in my pants was felt, the ears popping as the pack soared up to 500 feet, and
for a brief moment, my city�s downtown hung below me.� It�s not the most scenic place in the
country, but at least most of the damage from the War has been repaired.� Even at 500 feet, I could see the crowd
forming in the Plaza.� As the Pack
dropped down towards City Hall stop I could see more and more details.� At the front, lining the ropes, were a couple
of classes of Academy students, brought by their teachers to witness the
ceremony.� These young men � 18, 19 years
old, were among the best and brightest of our youth � and, incidentally, the
same age as our blushing bride, Lisa Chamberlain.

Behind them were
gathered the curious � the crowds that always gathered, even though the
Government provided close to 100% employment these days.� I guess some bosses had decided to let their
workers take a break for the Ceremony.

In front of the
ropes were the pews for the families, mostly still empty, the central aisle,
and then the platform itself.� Above the
pews soared a beautiful white canopy, matching the lovely flowers that trailed
down the sides and twined along the oaken seats.

As I landed and
shucked the pack, I squinted up at the sky � it was a beautiful blue, 70
degrees � perfect for a wedding � I was sure that Lisa would be happy to get
through this.� Harry Yarrel
loped up.

����������� �Hey,
Mike.�

����������� �Morning,
Harry.�� I craned my neck and looked past
him.� �Is the van safely locked up?�

����������� �I
just opened it up a few minutes ago.�
Everything�s still in there.�

����������� �Good.�� About six months ago, a couple of colleagues
doing a Wedding had their van broken into just before by protesters, and the
entire event had to be cancelled.� They
had both been demoted.� We take our jobs
seriously.

����������� �You�re
looking good, boss.�

����������� �Thanks.�

����������� �How
long do you think this will take?�

����������� �Well,
they�re a lot of people here � but I think she�s just having the 30 minute
Ceremony, right?�

����������� �Are
you counting the Reading as well?�

����������� �No,
sorry � just the Ceremony.� The Reading
will take about 15 minutes.� Let�s plan
on an hour, Harry.�

����������� �You
got it, Mike.�

����������� �Alright,
let�s get our stuff unloaded and set up.��
We went over to the van together and Harry slid open the side door and
pulled down the ramp.� As usual, the
lectern was a devil to move into place, but we managed.� 

����������� �How
many different Types are we doing in the Ceremony, Mike?�

����������� �Um, two.� No,
three.� Better get the stuff for Types 1
to 3.� Nothing fancy.�

����������� �You
got it.�� Harry rolled out three large
flat brown packs, and pushing them over to the platform, unlocked and began to
assemble the material.� In the meantime,
I glanced at a small knot of protesters beginning to chant.

����������� �WHAT
DO WE WANT?� JUSTICE!� WHEN DO WE WANT IT?� NOW!�

Annoying.� What did they think this was?� I was pleased to see a small squad of Peace
Officers moving towards them, recording devices running.

Just then, I saw a
small group of people coming towards the ropes.�
An older couple walked in front, the man�s arm wrapped protectively
around his wife, who was shorter and frailer than him.� This was clearly one of the family�s in the
wedding party.� I approached them.

����������� �Good
morning, Sir, Ma�am.� My name is Michael
Wilson, and I am the Officiant at today�s
ceremony.�� The older man reached out and
shook my hand with a firm grip.� 

����������� �Good
morning, Michael.� We have looked forward
to this great day for a long time now.��
The older woman bestowed a shaky smile on me.

����������� �Michael,�
she whispered.� �Do you think this will
be a special day?�

����������� I
smiled back at her.� �Don�t worry, we�ll all do our best.�

����������� She
raised her gaze to mine.� �I can never
forget what occurred between them � but I know this is what should happen.� I just wish Bill could be here to see it.� I
nodded.� Secretly, I agreed with her, but
I couldn�t say that.

����������� �I
don�t make the rules, Ma�am.� The
Government does.� I am just the
Facilitator.�

The family moved
down the aisle and took their seats on the right side of the aisle.� That was one family taken care of � now where
was the bride�s?� Ah, here they came now
� the Mother of the Bride wearing a violet dress and hat that must have cost
six month�s salary, and assorted other relatives.� I moved towards them, reaching them as they
arrived at the start of the aisle and looked around nervously.

�Mrs.
Chamberlain!� I cried, joyfully, reaching out and embracing Lisa�s mother.� �What a wonderful day!�� She stiffened a bit, and then hugged
back.� She seemed nervous.� 

����������� �Don�t
worry,� I told her.� �It�s normal to feel
nervous and emotional at this moment.�
But it will be over before long!��
She gave me a shaky smile.

����������� �I
just wish � I just �� she began to cry.

����������� �There,
there.� I said.� �Did you get a chance to
see Lisa this morning?�

����������� �Y
� yes,� she gulped.� �She looked �� she
burst into sobs again.� I laughed kindly
and guided her towards the front row on the left.� 

����������� �Here
you are, Mrs. Chamberlain.� You�ll get a
perfect view from here.�

I looked at my
watch � 10:13 AM.� I looked over towards Harry, who had seated
himself at the Electrics Console and was checking various feeds.� �The Groom?� I
mouthed towards him.� He saw me, grinned,
and gave a thumbs-up.� We were set.� It was time for Lisa Chamberlain�s special
day � Right on cue, the bells in the clock tower of City Hall began to peal the
Wedding March.� The crowd in the back
towards City Hall itself gave a cheer, and there she was � the beautiful bride.

����������� She
was about 5�3�, a blonde rose.� Some men
like women with huge breasts, but not me � she was just right, from what I
could tell under the dress.� Breasts that were young and firm, without wobbling too much.� She wore a classic white wedding dress � a
fairly demure sweetheart neckline, scalloped with the finest lace.� On her golden hair lay a
jeweled tiara, from which descended a silken, filmy veil that just barely
obscured her features before falling behind her elfin neck to descend halfway
down her back.

����������� On
her feet she wore small shoes with just enough heel to
tauten her legs and calves under the long train of her dress.� Her dress came down to just above her ankles,
which were encased in white silk stockings.�
In a slightly daring touch, her arms were bare.� Not one bit of excess fat could be seen on
them, and they glowed with a healthy tan.�
Clearly, Lisa was one of those young ladies who had worked hard to look
her best for this important day.

����������� Her
father, dressed in a top hat and morning coat, held her arm.� He stared grimly ahead, white-faced with
embarrassment and suppressed rage.� I
always felt sorriest for the fathers of the brides � but you know what?� If they had been more involved with making
sure that their daughters were well-trained at the State Schools, then they
wouldn�t have to do this.

����������� I
stood at the head of the aisle, my hands clasped in front of me, a beatific
smile of welcome on my face.� Lisa walked
with small steps, her eyes downcast and a slight flush tinting her pale
skin.� When the pair reached me, I held
her briefly by the shoulders and smiled down at her veiled face.

����������� �What
a blooming bride.� What a wonderful day
for you and your family.�� My words,
amplified by one of the many microphones hidden in the platform, reached the
crowd. �I nodded imperceptibly at Harry
and raised one eyebrow.� He fiddled with
a knob on the console, and the volume went up slightly.� The crowd, meanwhile, having heard my words
of welcome, roared appreciatively.

����������� In
the old days, and at some traditional weddings now, the groom is already there
when the bride walks down the aisle.� But
at AIM Weddings, we reverse this, and like for the bride to be standing on the
platform when the groom arrives.� And now
that moment had come.� I gestured towards
Harry, and he pressed a green button on his console.� I kept my eyes focused on Lisa.

����������� She
saw the groom, and gave a gasping moan, stumbling slightly, so that her father
had to hold her up.� Her father in turn
looked ready to murder somebody.� The
crowd, in contrast, broke into sustained applause, as did the groom�s family.

����������� Well,
maybe I should be clearer.� The groom
didn�t really have a family.� The groom
today was a seven foot tall robot, with pneumatic wheels for feet, pincers for
hands, an insectoid head, and a smooth cylinder for a
body.� The GR-115 Model was one of the
Department of Administration�s finest creations.

����������� Looking
at Lisa, I knew � I just knew � that she was finally regretting her actions of
a year ago.� Back then, Miss Lisa
Chamberlain was an 18 year old Certified Virgin, on the auction block for a
husband.� Since she came from good stock,
Bill Harper�s family paid excellent money -- $500 New Dollars � for her to be
their son�s bride.

����������� He
took her to Upstate New York for a honeymoon at a Pony Girl Resort, and there,
on their wedding night, she refused to pleasure him sexually.� Some men would have dealt with this in their
own way, or asked for their money back, but Bill�s family was Government
through and through.� Bill had evidently
turned around, left the resort, and within three hours, Lisa was in custody.

����������� She
was a classic example of someone who didn�t need to be in the prison system,
though.� No previous offenses, low grades
in academic subjects (therefore less of a future threat), and with the chance
of rehabilitation.

����������� After
six months in isolation, she was ready to plead guilty and receive her
sentence.� This sentence, in fact, was
what I was about to read.� I cleared my
throat.

����������� �Dearly
Beloved, We are gathered here today� I began.�
The crowd shouted with laughter.� �To witness the marriage of Lisa Chamberlain and GR-115 Serial
Number 83450968.�� The crowd and
the Harper Family stood and cheered.� Lisa,
as well as her mother, were sobbing silent tears.

����������� �Lisa
Chamberlain.� You have plead
guilty to one count of Refusing Matrimonial Privileges, a felony under the laws
of the New States of America.� The Court, having heard your plea, has passed
sentence.� Today, that sentence is Facilitated.� Miss
Chamberlain, you are sentenced as follows:

15 Minutes Type 1 interaction with
GR-115

15 Minutes Type 2 interaction with
GR-115�

����������� The
crowd jeered and hooted gleefully, while Lisa shook with fear.� I hadn�t been present today at the
pre-ceremony explanation, but I knew enough to imagine exactly what her lawyer
had told her.� Type 1 was straight
missionary-style fucking � Lisa would be on her back on the platform, legs
spread, while her �husband� ploughed her deeply.� Probably, the GR-115 would take her long legs
and lift them above her head, so that it could stick its 10� animatronic penis as far as possible inside her virgin
pussy.� A Type 1 ended after the allotted
time with a lovely orgasm for the GR-115.�
She probably wouldn�t enjoy the feeling of her husband�s cum, however �
it was a blast of half a pint of scalding fluid.

����������� Since
Lisa had plead guilty, she would get a spray of Nu-Skin 5 minutes after the first orgasm, so that the burns
inside of her would heal immediately.�
Lucky little devil.

����������� Type
2 would be next.� Many brides hated this
Type the most.� Their lucky husband would
recline on the platform, and they were forced to mount the phallus and push
themselves up and down, at the rate of ten thrusts/minute.� Rather than have an orgasm, the GR-115 would
send an electric pulse at random intervals, frying the delicate inside of Lisa�s
once-virgin pussy.

����������� It
could have been worse � much worse.� Lisa
could also have faced Type 3 � anal sex.�
And worst of all, if the Ceremony was set to last longer � 60 or 90
minutes, then Lisa might end up with permanent genital damage.� Some women found themselves
unable to ever orgasm again after their wedding, while others were able to
orgasm but suffered from serious pain during intercourse.� 

����������� The
decision to sentence her to a 30 Minute Ceremony was made far above my pay grade.� But I can only imagine that some Judge took
pity on something � either her truly virginal looks, or her family�s
money.� Either way, Lisa was getting off
very easily.

����������� She
probably didn�t think so right now.�
After all, her marriage was about to be consummated.� And worst of all, perhaps, was that she was
not going to be forced in any way.� Since
this was a Wedding Ceremony, bondage and restraint devices were not used.� Rather, the blushing bride was supposed to
take her new husband to bed, attempting to be as romantic and loving as
possible.

����������� I
nodded to Harry and stepped back.� �Let
the Ceremony Commence!� I cried, and the crowd roared back its
appreciation.� Harry manipulated a lever
on his console, and the Hovercams closed in, zooming
in to catch all the detail for those who preferred to watch the live feed on
their consoles at work or home, or were too busy and had to wait for the
highlight show at 11 tonight.

����������� Lisa�s
hands were shaking.� Her father stepped
back and collapsed into the front pew, barely able to look at the scene before
him.� Lisa cried �Daddy!� as her father
pulled away, but he could not help her now.

����������� With
a hiss of air, GR-115 rolled forward.� It
and Lisa were now standing at the foot of the bed that dominated the front
platform.� I, meanwhile, retired to the
side, where I could keep an eye on both the happy couple and on Harry, who was
running the Console today for only the 2nd time.

����������� Lisa
blushed as the crowd whistled.� She knew
that if she didn�t begin soon, the sentence would be cancelled, and she would
be remanded for trial.� A trial that
could result in 20 years imprisonment � imprisonment that would make even the
horrors she was about to endure seem a walk in the park.

����������� Trembling
hands lifted a gauzy, silken veil from a blushing face.

����������� She
reached out and caressed the cold metal of GR-115�s frightening features.� I began to count backwards from 100.� When I reached 1, I signaled Harry, and he
pressed the first of three buttons on the top row of the console.� GR-115 responded smoothly.� Its pincers reached out, arms telescoping
upwards, and closed none-too-gently on the zipper at the back of Lisa�s ivory
dress.

����������� She
shuddered as the zipper was pulled down.�
The pincers retracted.� She took a
deep breath, and shrugged out of the dress.�
This was one of the great side-benefits of the job � the view of
virginal bodies like Lisa�s.

����������� Her
breasts were close to perfect � 34B, by the look of them, pale and slightly
freckled.� At the moment, a red dash of
shame was spreading across them, matching the look on her face.� Her nipples were upturned, proudly erect, and
had been rouged, as per orders.

����������� Her
dress continued its slow fall to the ground, revealing a flat, taut stomach,
whose muscles rippled slightly as Lisa struggled to control her breathing and
maintain some composure.

����������� And
then, the most glorious slight of all � a plump mound of venus, surmounted by only the faintest of rosy-blonde
curls � and a pair of perfectly formed legs encased in white silk
stockings.� 

����������� As
for a normal wedding, Lisa�s family had to go into debt to pay for the
Ceremony.� It would probably take her
family six months at least to pay off the cost of her dress and lingerie.� 

����������� There
she stood in her virginal glory, waiting to be violated.

����������� Harry
pushed the second button, and GR-115�s pride and joy emerged from a hidden hole
in its torso.� 10 inches long, modeled
realistically, the robot�s phallus was designed for maximum impact.� Long and wide, knobbed and ridged, it
contained attachments that could vary depending on the sentence.� Today, I could see, along with the console
viewers watching through the Hovercams� eyes, a
plastic canister underneath carrying the bubbling Type 1 orgasm liquid, and
immediately next to that, a TENS-type unit set at Level 6 for the Type 2
shocks.� A small wire led up to the
phallus� head from the TENS unit, and I knew that the plastic canister
contained a nano-pump and flow-valve inside of the
canister.� The liquid itself I had helped
Harry decant last night � it was a mixture of capsicum, cinnamon oil, and
filtered water.� It would be heated to
exactly 195 degrees Fahrenheit before ejaculation, enough to cause serious
internal burns.� 

����������� In
a way, not having restraint devices was worse for Lisa.� She actually had to seduce the robotic monster
that stood before her.� And on top of
that, the only lubrication she would have when losing her virginity was
moisture her body provided on its own.

����������� She
walked, swaying slightly, to the large double bed with white satin sheets
bolted to the platform.� She glanced back
at her parents, and an opalescent tear cut a path down her rouged cheek.� Her eyes went to the sky, hoping for some
miraculous intervention.� But there was
none.� Our Glorious Leader had no desire
to see her pardoned.

����������� Desperately
mastering her tears, she lay on her back and spread
her legs.� I could see a muscle along the
inside of her smooth right thigh twitching with tension, and small
goose-pimples all across her flesh.� She
raised her head from the pillow.

����������� �Darling,�
she murmured.� �Darling, I�m ready for
you.� Please, love, take me now.�� The crowd�s noise rose even higher as her
amplified voice echoed around the Plaza.�
I knew that this moment would reach every highlight show in the New
States tonight.

����������� GR-115�s
processors took over, and it began to roll towards the bed, its pincers
snapping excitedly, and its phallus glowing.�
In a pained simulacrum of ecstasy, Lisa began to spit on her hands and
rub them against her pussy.� She had
clearly been warned by some veteran brides inside of the necessity of creating
lubrication.� Unsurprisingly, her body
itself could not yet create sexual lubrication.�
Her saliva would help somewhat, although the next 30 minutes would still
be bloody awful for her � probably the worst 30 minutes of her heretofore
sheltered life.

����������� Lisa�s
groom levered itself on to the bed and braced itself on top of her.� Cameras mounted on the head of the bed
swiveled and zoomed inward to give Console watchers a bride�s-eye view of the
violation.� Other cameras focused on the
close-ups of the imminent penetration.

����������� �Lisa
Chamberlain,� I cried in my best Facilitator voice.� �Let the Wedding be consummated!�

����������� GR-115
thrust its phallus forward, and there was a ripping and sucking sound.� And then Mrs. GR-115 screamed, long and loud,
convulsing on the bed.� I glanced back
towards the family pews and saw that the mother of the bride had fainted.� GR-115 paused, its 10 inches thrust fully
into Lisa�s flower.� I knew that the
phallus� end was pushing roughly against the entrance to her womb, forcing the
inelastic cervix to dilate more than this young lady thought possible.� Then GR-115 withdrew.

����������� And
the crowd saw the first-hand evidence of why this particular AIM was limited to
certified virgins.� Glistening along the
ridged edges of GR-115�s phallus was Lisa�s hymenal
blood � her pearl, her price beyond prices, had just been given away to this
robotic instrument of torture.� 

����������� Closer
to the action, I could see that the GR-115 had done its duty brutally and
coarsely.� Flaps of Lisa�s hymen,
literally torn apart, hung as far as her inner labia.� Losing virginity was never pleasant, but this
� this was agony � and that was just how it was supposed to be.

����������� The
robot began to penetrate again and soon picked up a rhythm.� The bed creaked and groaned as Lisa gasped
with pain.� I noticed that the new bride
seemed unwilling to respond to her husband, lying fairly passively under his assaultive thrusts.�
Her legs, while spread, were not using their strong, aerobicized
muscles to thrust the pussy upwards, and I knew from the Console readouts fed
to my wrist pad that she was not using her internal muscles to squeeze
GR-115.� This was unacceptable.� She had been trained in Kegel
exercises at her school, and knew very well that she was to use these
techniques on her Wedding Day.� I spoke
into my wrist pad.

����������� �Harry,
are you seeing what I�m seeing?�

����������� �Yes,
boss.� She�s pretty still.�

����������� �Let�s
give her the corkscrew for two minutes � up it to level 8.�

����������� �You
got it.�� He began to manipulate
levers.� I approached the head of the
bed, and knelt down next to her tortured face.

����������� �Lisa,
listen to me.�� My voice was still
amplified, and the crowd hushed to listen.�
Viewers loved when Facilitators had to intervene.� �I�m afraid this isn�t good enough.� This robot is your husband, and I expect to
see you show your love, even before Type 2 begins.� Now, in about 30 seconds, you are going to
have a couple of corkscrew minutes.� That
is going to hurt you even more.� If you
can start responding sexually, then we�ll go back to what it�s doing now � if
not, then we may have to cancel this AIM and send you back to Court.�

����������� She
opened her pain-filled eyes and nodded her understanding.� �Please sir,� she murmured.� �It hurts � it hurts so much.� Please.��
I shook my head. �

����������� �This
is your decision.� Two minutes of the
corkscrew, and then I want to see some results.�

����������� I
straightened back up as GR-115 withdrew.�
It turned to the crowd, giving it a perfect view as the sides of its
phallus attachment slid to one side, and a twisted piece of poly-metal
appeared, shaped like an antique corkscrew.�
As the crowd screamed, it began to spin, faster and faster.� The sides were blunted, so Lisa would not be
cut to shreds, but she would still feel agonizing pain for two minutes as the
spinning poly-metal was forced past the sensitive nerves at the lip of her
vagina.� 

����������� �Oh,
God,� she prayed, and then her prayers turned to inarticulate screaming as the
corkscrew entered her.� GR-115 swayed its
hips from side to side as it pummeled her, maximizing the impact zone.� The corkscrew combined fast down-thrusts with
agonizingly slow pulls out, scraping across the labia.

����������� Somewhere
in her deepest limbic brain, however, Lisa remembered how to get the corkscrew
to stop.� Desperately, hopelessly, Lisa
began to rub her clitoris with one hand while the other played with her
nipples.� After 45 seconds or so, she
began to buck slightly underneath the GR-115.�
I didn�t expect miracles � I knew she was a virgin � but this was still
more like it.� And the readings backed me
up � somehow, someway, Mrs. GR-115 was beginning to get sexually aroused from
her horrific experience.

����������� Happily,
therefore, I was able to signal Harry after two minutes, and GR-115 withdrew
and showed the crowd the corkscrew disappearing back inside the phallus.� The crowd hissed good-naturedly, but they
were pleased that I had not stepped in and ended the AIM early.

����������� But
while Lisa might have been pleased to see the end of the corkscrew, her agony
of Type 1 had not ended by a long shot.�
I looked at the countdown on my watch pad � she still had 5 minutes and
30 seconds to go.

����������� The
next minutes must have seemed like an eternity to her.� As the crowd whistled and her ex-husband�s
family cheered, GR-115 reached its level 6 pace � 80 TPM (thrusts per minute)
and grabbed her ankles in its pincers.�
Without any discernible effort, the GR-115 lifted her legs above her
head, raising her ass completely off the bed and turning her young body into
the shape of a capital �L�.� Without
forgetting to respond sexually, she began to moan quietly and rhythmically,
beginning to lose herself in the pain and embarrassment.� 

����������� This
was one of the glories of the Wedding Ceremony � because the woman had a
minimum of three different positions, she couldn�t zone out for too long.� In fact, it was about time to get the fluid
heating.� I glanced towards the console
and saw Harry already pressing the heat button.�
He was on top of things today � I had to remember to compliment him
after, and possibly even tell Mr. Sinclair about his performance.

����������� Thirty
seconds to go, and Harry gave me the �OK� sign to show that the robot�s �Cum�
had reached appropriate temperature.� I
nodded back, and the GR-115 increased its pace to a frantic 140 TPM.� I saw fear flash across Lisa�s face, and then
she remembered the lessons, and began to coo at her husband.

����������� �Yes, darling, yes.� I
love how you feel inside of me.� Now,
love, now.� Cum for me.� Cum deep in me.�� The crowd roared with laughter.

����������� The
GR-115 model paused, and then drove further in than ever before, reaching into Lisa�s
womb itself.� The canister of fluid
glowed red, a little trick that I especially enjoyed.� And then, in a foaming torrent, out poured
the GR-115�s cum � and the screams began and went on and on and on as the hot oils
and near-boiling water scalded her womb and flooded down and out through her
vagina.

����������� The
robot withdrew and sprang backwards off the bed, its phallus retracting.� It began to roll around the platform waving
to the crowd, as hundreds of flash cameras went off.� Strangely, the GR-115�s had numerous fans �
tech-heads and webbies who filled the Nanonet with bulletin board postings comparing the
performance ratings of different models and traded Holocards
of the best �performing robots.� 

����������� GR�s bride, meanwhile, writhed screaming on the bed.� I liked to give her a minute or so of the
pain � not long enough to go into shock, but enough to make her welcome the Nu-Skin spray I was scheduled to deliver.� Nu-Skin was a
wonderful invention, although I used a modified form.� Law-abiding citizens were able to receive Nu-Skin sprays and injections at full strength, which
bonded a replacement enzyme to the wound site, reducing infections by 95%, and
blocking out an equal amount of discomfort.�
Developed during the War, the commercial application of this device has
led to a 72% productivity increase, since people injured in Jet-Pack wrecks
etc. now did not need to miss as much work to recover.

����������� The
modified form we used was watered down to approximately 50% strength � it would
place a layer of protective skin over the wound, and cut the pain, but left the
recipient with severe itching for approximately three weeks after
application.� Nevertheless, I had never
known a bride refuse the chance if they had been awarded a Nu-Skin
spray, and a couple of them were even so grateful that I had to stop them
giving me their Nanonumbers!

����������� �Lisa!�� I stood near the foot of the bed.� �Lisa, spread your legs for me.�

����������� �But,
but � please Sir, I can�t do this.�

����������� �You
have no choice.� But this will help, I
promise.�� She nodded.� I leaned in and pressed the nozzle of the Nu-Skin into her torn lips.�
She screamed, and I pushed the spray release lever.� Her eyes rolled up in her head as the
narcotic and ply-skin bonded.� I drew a
knobbed device out of my belt.� It had a
cylindrical shape to it, and was designed to test the Nu-Skin
and the elasticity of the wounded area.�
A few times, a woman will not heal properly with the Nu-Skin,
and the Ceremony has to be cancelled.� If
these women are lucky, the burns will heal on their own without too much
lasting damage.� If they are really
lucky, the Court will take mercy on them, and allow them to have another
Wedding Ceremony.� If not, it�s off to
incarceration.

����������� Luckily
for Lisa, the EMD showed that her vaginal muscular structure would withstand
the remainder of the ceremony.� It
wouldn�t be that much fun for her, but hey � she could have been happily
married to Bill Harper!

����������� The
crowd was already starting to get impatient.�
I leaned down and helped Lisa sit up on the bed.� �Go on, sweetheart,� I urged her.� �Your husband�s waiting.�� She shuddered.

GR-115 turned eagerly and rolled
back towards the bed.� She knew that she
had to seduce him, and didn�t know what it would take.� In large part this depended on how merciful I
was feeling.� I wanted to see what she
would do.

As in Type 1, she
began by caressing the robot�s shiny exoskeleton.� I stifled a laugh at how differently she
already looked from the proud virgin who had stood defiantly 15 minutes before.� Now, her stockings laddered, her makeup
ruined by tears, and her inner thighs streaming with her own blood, she could
barely stand on her high heels.

And this time,
caressing would not be enough.� The
throat mike she wore, cunningly disguised inside a jeweled locket, carried her
words to the waiting crowd.

����������� �Please,
dearest.� Please.� Let me take you.� Let me feel � let me take you deep
inside.� I want you in me.�

����������� GR-115
did not respond.� I knew what I was
waiting to see.

����������� And
slowly but surely, realization dawned.�
She knelt down in front of the machine, further soiling her white
stockings, and began to kiss and lick the covered hole from which GR-115�s
phallus had emerged earlier.� Now she was
getting the idea.� 

����������� Harry,
thinking laterally, had GR-115 reach out and grab her
nipples with his pincers.� It twisted,
hard, and she shrieked, but kept licking and cooing to the monster.

����������� I
looked at wrist pad.� Time was marching
on.� I signaled to Harry, and after the
right buttons were pressed, GR-115 pushed her back, and majestically lay back
on the bed.� Its phallus emerged, cleaned
by nanobots inside the robot, and, (just for effect),
its electrified end spat sparks into the air.�
Lisa yelped, but brave girl that she was turning out to be, still
approached the bed.

����������� As if in a trance, she scooted her body up the robot�s �legs�, and
straddled its phallus.� What was
going through her mind?� Did she remember
when she refused Bill the same favor a year before?� Did she have second thoughts and regrets?� Did she even hope against hope that she had plead innocent, and ended up one of the 1 in 200 women who
was acquitted?� Perhaps � I doubt she
realized that women in the prisons field-tested the GR robots � and other,
worse things, as well.

����������� Whatever
she was thinking, I saw her bite her lip and begin to lower herself inch by
painful inch upon the giant pole.� She
began to cry as the phallus rubbed against the Nu-Skin
interior of the vagina.� Structurally
functional it might be, but still pretty damn sore.� 

����������� Finally,
she had taken the entire monster phallus inside of her.� The tip rested actually inside her womb, and
I could actually see a swelling alongside her pubic bone.� 

����������� Being
a virgin, as I�ve said before, I didn�t expect a filmstar
performance from her.� And that was half
the reason we often saved the electroshocks for Type 2 ceremonies.� 30 seconds after the phallus came to rest in
her womb, the GR-115 discharged the first 70 volt shock.� Imagine taking the batteries out of your
wrist pad, rubbing them in salt water, and then pressing them to your tongue �
now replace your tongue with the inside of your most intimate area, and you
have some idea of the pain that must have coursed through Mrs. GR-115�s body.

����������� The
shock had the requisite effect � she leapt into the air, naturally dragging the
phallus along the inside of her birth canal.�
And once she was at the top, gravity took over, and plummetted
her back down.

����������� And
so it continued, for 15 minutes � the GR-115 lay back, and if a robot could
smile with an insectoid beak, it smiled.� Lisa screamed and cried, struggling to
remember to keep on acting convincingly as if she was madly in love with her
husband.� Meanwhile, her womb pulsed
visibly from the repeated shocks, and muscles up and down her legs rippled with
the after-effects.

����������� Finally,
a bell sounded.� Lisa continued to thrust
up and down, up and down � lost in a world of pain and shame.� The crowd yelled with glee at the sight, and
I half-wished that I could just let this continue.� But I had a job to do � a responsible job for
the State, so I signaled to Harry, and he pressed a large red button.

����������� With
a sighing thump, the GR-115�s phallus retracted, spilling Lisa in a naked pile
on the bed.� She lay there,
chest heaving as it slowly dawned on her that her wedding was over at
last.� The robot levered itself to its
wheeled feet, and moved smoothly along the platform as the crowd chanted �G-R,
G-R�.� It reached the console, and Harry,
as the junior Facilitator, began the post-ceremony electronics check.

����������� My
job was to deal with the post-ceremony bride check.� Most of the time, like
today, that involved three simple things.� First, Lisa shakily signed a parchment
acknowledging the completion of her Wedding Ceremony.� Next, I assisted her into a hover-chair.� Once seated, which she did most gingerly,
poly-mesh bands snapped themselves around her wrists, ankles, waist, and
throat.� She was, of course, still a
prisoner � her out-processing would occur momentarily in the Detention
 Center underneath the Plaza.� In fact, I could see the two Judicial
Marshals coming through the crowd now to take possession.� Finally, and unnecessarily, I spent a few
minutes talking with Lisa�s parents.�
This was never required of me, but I thought it wise to go the extra
mile so that the family did not start to have any anti-State feelings.

����������� �Well,
Mr. and Mrs. Chamberlain, you should be able to take Lisa home in about an
hour.�

����������� �What
will she be feeling, Sir?� asked her father, struggling to maintain his
composure.� Her mother was too upset to
speak.

����������� �That�s
a fair question.� The Nu-Skin
will give her a very bad rash for a few weeks, and unfortunately, as an
ex-prisoner, she won�t have access to medical care in that time.� I might suggest that you keep her arms tied
to avoid her doing any further damage to herself.�

����������� �But
this � this rape � I apologize � this lovemaking � will she ever be whole
again?�

����������� There
were women who never recovered.� But I
like to look at the bright side.� �That�s
statistically likely.�

����������� �So,
she can get married?� To
a real human?�

����������� �Absolutely.�

����������� What
I didn�t need to tell them was just how unlikely a third marriage was for Lisa.� Her parents didn�t realize that she was
likely going to be the cover girl for Robot
Bride magazine this week, and that the Nanoweb
was already filling with pages dedicated to her Ceremony.� 

����������� More
likely, Lisa would be known as Mrs. GR-115 for a few years to come.� Her parents would find themselves
unable � unwilling even � to bear the burden and the shame of having an
unmarried felon in the house � and would cast her out.

����������� And
that would mean only one thing:� the
State Brothel System.� Had Lisa decided
to enter the State Brothels at 18, she might well have found a fairly congenial
house that catered to normal tastes.� But
few men would enjoy her pussy now, it having been malformed by a robotic
phallus.� Lisa, most likely, would live
out her days in a Fetish House, catering to the oddest and most depraved of
male desires.

����������� All
in all, she should have married the boy, and gotten on with life.

The Facilitator

&nbsp;

Chapter 2

&nbsp;

The Harris Service

&nbsp;

����������� Lisa�s wedding had
gone very well, for everyone but the blushing bride.� Within 30 minutes of the post-ceremony check,
I had returned to my desk and was reviewing the monthly report on pre-trial
semi-custodial inmates.� There you go �
anyone who thinks that the life of a Facilitator is all public ceremonies and
wild experiences should sift through just a small percentage of the paperwork
crap that I have to put up with every day.�
Whoever said that the HoloWeb would decrease paper?� They must not have worked for the Government!

����������� To
tell the truth, though, I often enjoyed these reports.� This month�s report focused on private
contractors who had recently begun running pre-trial centers for the
Government.� This was a system known as
the �Harris Service� after Francis Harris, the high-level bureaucrat who first
designed the idea.� It was a simple but
effective process � rather than have every pre-trial detainee cluttering up the
system, why not let those who have actual jobs to remain in the community, with
restrictions?� Most of the time this
worked very well, and since the private contractors had gotten involved, the
style and quality of the monthly reports had greatly improved.

����������� This
month�s was no exception.� Behind a
glossy cover showing a young woman racing towards a door while looking
anxiously at her watch, the report promised that it would contain the full
account of Melanie Barren�s first month in pre-trial custody.

����������� Melanie
Barren was one of those rare phenomenons in today�s society � the female
celebrity.� A weather girl with GGBN
(Global Government Broadcasting Network) she had become part of the background
of the morning news report for many people.�
Dressed in frilly tops, she spun and twirled her way across the screens,
managing to make even the gloomiest November day seem like a passing cloud.

����������� Naturally,
she attracted the attention of many male suitors, and since she was already the
property of the GGBN, the network soon decided to auction her off on air.� The viewership numbers for the auction were
among the highest the Government had seen, and Melanie quickly became the fifth
wife of Roger McMalley, one of the wealthiest media tycoons in the area.

����������� McMalley
enjoyed his wife for about six months, until one day he awoke to find his
morning holo-screen covered with an interview Melanie had given to a rival
videopaper.� In it, she claimed that
McMalley allowed her great freedom, and that she didn�t even listen particularly
hard to his stated desires.

����������� Within
moments, Melanie had a civil contempt order slapped on her.� She was lucky that she was not charged with
Criminal Breach of Contract, since this would have landed her in immediate
detention.� Since she was only being sued
in civil court, she would have access to semi-detention options for pre-trial.

����������� But
what would this be like for such an attractive, spoiled young woman?� I turned to the first page, and chuckled out
loud.� On the left was a photo of Melanie
taken from the publicity spread of GGBN 18 months ago.� Wearing a string bikini made of a see-through
polymer, Melanie was caught at the moment of orgasm, gasping backwards as the
first jets of a warm summer rain played upon her body.� I smiled at the memory of her �Summer
Special� weather reports.� On the right
was a photo of Melanie taken today, one month into her pre-trial
experience.� Her brunette hair chopped
roughly short, her eyes lowered demurely to the ground, and a rough sack-like
garment covering her body.� She was
reaching out towards a pole that had a pair of handcuffs dangling from about
six feet, and I could easily tell from the hollows and smudges on her cheeks
that she had neither slept nor washed very much recently.� 

����������� The
report itself was set out as an interview between Melanie and the Manager of
the Home in which she had been housed.�
Rather than attempt to summarize it, I�ll just let you read the
interview in its complete form.

&nbsp;

Q:� Good morning,
Melanie.� 

A:� Good morning, Madam. (Melanie then stood up and curtsied, keeping
her eyes fixed on the ground).

Q:� On GGBN, you were known
for your sexy and outrageous outfits.�
I�m sure that everyone reading this would like to know what you think
about your current outfit.� Let�s start
by telling them what you wear every day.

A:� Ma�am, next to my skin I
wear a one-piece woolen girdle that goes from my neck to my ankles, and has
long sleeves.� It is purposefully one
size too small.

Q:� How does it feel?

A:� May I be honest?

Q:� Of course.

A:� Terrible.� It itches constantly, and I can�t breathe
very well.� And I hate, just hate how I
must look.

Q:� There�s something else
you�re wearing under the girdle, isn�t there?�
That�s one demerit for forgetting.

A:� I�m so sorry.� I am of course wearing a chastity belt.� It�s made of poly-metal, which softens only
when I evacuate waste.� It stops any
attempt at penetration, and I can�t touch myself down there at all.� Not that I would want to anymore.

Q:� Why not?� I thought you were highly sexual.

A:� I am.� Or, I was.�
But I have an internal inhibitor emplaced now.

Q:� What does this do?

A:� If my body temperature
rises too far, it begins to send electric shocks to my clitoris.� And if anything ever penetrates me, needles
insert themselves into my inner labia.

Q:� Has anyone penetrated you
since your arrival here?

A:� You�ve been kind enough
to not force me to sleep in the common dormitory.� But my husband still has marital rights, so
once a week he has taken me.� The pain is
really awful.

Q:� Let�s get back to your
clothes.� What do you wear over your
underwear?

A:� I wear thick black wool
stockings, and on my feet I wear these horrible sand shoes.

Q:� Sand shoes?

A:� Yes.� They are two sizes too small, and have
sandpaper lining.� Not to mention that
one sole is 2� thicker than the other, so I limp all the time now.

Q:� That�s a really ugly
dress you�re wearing.

A:� Yes Ma�am.� I�m learning to hate my appearance.� It is made of jute, which is a rough fiber
and colored gray even when it is clean.�
As you can see, I cut the neckholes and arm holes myself, so they are a
little rough.

Q:� Are you wearing any
jewelry?

A:� Only the wristband that
marks me as a civil pre-trial designee.�
I am not allowed to wear jewelry, makeup, or perfume.

Q:� What happened to all of
your jewelry?

A:� I think it was automatically
forfeited to my husband.

Q:� And your hair?� Is that a new style this year?

A:� Um, no.� I had it cut off two days ago because I had
earned five demerits this week.

Q:� Do you mind?

A:� (crying quietly) No.� It � it was starting to smell pretty badly
anyway.

Q:� You do smell.� When do you wash?

A:� Your Home supports HSD
(NB: �Historical Standard Detention�).� I
wash fully once a month, and well, I suppose the readers want to know how often
I change my clothes?� Once a month as
well.� So hopefully tomorrow I�ll be
allowed to wash myself and these clothes.

Q:� Do you wash at all
between the official washing days?

A:� I take a turn at a bucket
with the other detainees once a day, but usually I can only clean my face and
hands a little.

Q:� What about using the
toilet?

A:� Well, I am only allowed
to use the toilet four times a day, and naturally I understand that a flush
toilet is too good for the likes of me.�
I use a chamber pot, and you are very kind to provide me with newspapers
and rags to tear up for the paper.

Q:� Tell us about your
typical weekday.

A:� I get up at 5 AM.� I
don�t need to get dressed, so I can immediately begin sweeping my room.� I finish that by 5:20, and then it�s time for breakfast, which I get
delivered outside of my door.

Q:� What�s your normal
breakfast?

A:� Cold mutton, a tin of
water, and stale bread.

Q:� Pleasant!

A:� I used to be a
vegetarian.

Q:� Then what?� 

A:� Luckily, I am allowed out
from 8 AM to 4 PM every day for work.�
Of course, I lost my job when this suit was brought against me, so I am
now employed as a casual day laborer.�
Most days this means working at the bookstore.

Q:� What do you do there?

A:� I am in charge of copying
the dictionary out by hand.

Q:� And lunch?� You used to be famous for your gourmet
tastes!

A:� �I don�t eat lunch, since I have no right to a
bank account anymore.

Q:� What happens at 4 PM?

A:� If I am not home by 4 PM exactly, I become a Violator, and can be
collected and sent to prison until my trial.�
So I make absolutely sure to be home by 4 every day!

Q:� And what do you do at
home?

A:� Evenings are always
stressful.� I owe 3 hours a day on the
post, so I try to get in a line to do this before dinner.

Q:� Tell the readers about
the post.

A:� This is one of your
innovations, Madam.� It teaches me
patience.� I handcuff myself to a
six-foot tall post, and stand there with my arms over my head for three hours,
thinking about how silly I have been to let myself get into this mess.

Q:� Do you get dinner?

A:� Yes, unless I am on the
post.� It�s the same as breakfast � cold
mutton, water, and stale bread.

Q:� What do you do during the
weekends?

A:� My husband doesn�t think
I should be allowed out at the weekend, so I spend the weekend in Close
Confinement.

Q:� Tell us about that.

A:� On Friday evenings I have
Oral Practice, where I have to spend four hours on my knees licking a fake
vagina.� This is filmed, and can be seen
on the GGBN Late Late Show every week.

Q:� Are you a lesbian?

A:� No, Ma�am, but I�m
learning.

Q:� Why is it so important
for you to learn this?

A:� It�s quite possible that
the Court may order me to be lesbianized as part of my civil penalty.

Q:� What happens after Oral
Practice?

A:� I am locked in an
isolation cell for the weekend.� These
are 6�x8� metal rooms, with only a mat on the floor.� The lights burn all the time.

Q:� Do you get much rest?

A:� No, not really.� Every few hours loud sirens ring out, and
meals are served at irregular intervals, so it�s very hard to keep track of
time.

Q:� We�re nearly done
here.� Tell me what happens when you get
demerits.

A:� We get punished according
to the Demerit Chart, and are count is reset every week:

&nbsp;

One Demerit:� One week in an
isolation cell, one meal a day.

Two Demerits:� One week in an
isolation cell, four hour session with Mistress.

Three Demerits:� No food for
two weeks (water allowed), anal dilation to 15�.

Four Demerits:� Washing Day
cancelled, 100 lashes, toilet privileges revoked for one month.

Five Demerits:� Hair removed
200 lashes a day for one week.

Six Demerits:� Automatic prison
sentence of one month following trial.

Seven Demerits:� Transfer to
prison for remainder of pre-trial period.

Eight Demerits:� Isolation
cell for remainder of pre-trial period, one meal a day.

Nine Demerits:� Larynx
paralyzed for 12 months, tube-fed for 12 months.

Ten Demerits:� Immediate 10
year prison term.

&nbsp;

Q:� What is the highest
number of demerits you have received in one week?

A:� Five, Madam.

Q:� That�s all for now.� Now get up, Melanie, because you owe me one
week in an isolation cell on one meal a day.�


&nbsp;

����������� I
closed the issue, sighing with pleasure at the economic efficiency of this
system.� It gave sadists like Lucinda
Marples, the owner of Melanie�s �House� a chance to vent their ideas, and in
turn kept civil detainees out of the prison system.� I like to think that when I retire from this
job, I may well find myself a place in the private system, running one of these
Houses for wayward girls.

����������� Now,
it�s jumping ahead a bit, but those of you who followed Melanie�s trial will
know the outcome � and those who didn�t are probably curious about what
happened to her.� I refer all readers to
the following account from the Government
Gazette:

&nbsp;

EX-WEATHER GIRL FOUND RESPONSIBLE
ON ALL CHARGES

Melanie Barren escapes
prison term for civil contempt

&nbsp;

METROPOLIS, June 13:

&nbsp;

����������� In
a packed courtroom today, The Honorable Judge Wilhelm Franklin found Melanie
Barren, the ex-weather girl star of GGBN�s Morning Show responsible on a charge
of Civil Contempt filed against her almost five years ago by her husband, media
tycoon Roger McMalley.

����������� When
Judge Franklin read the sentence, Melanie�s shoulders drooped slightly, and
this reporter saw a sigh quiver through her skinny frame.� The once gorgeous defendant, standing nude as
is the custom when a verdict is to be read, had appeared throughout the trial
to be much less sure of herself than the girl some remember from the
HoloScreens of yesteryear.

����������� �I
take some responsibility for this,� claimed a well-turned out Lucinda Marples,
manager of the Harris System Home where Melanie has spent the past four and a
half years as a pre-trial detainee.� �I
always do my utmost to instill in my girls a sense of guilt and responsibility,
as well as shame for their actions.�

����������� Indeed,
Melanie, who represented herself, barely questioned any of the Plaintiff�s
witnesses, preferring instead to apologize repeatedly to her husband and the
court.

����������� Unfortunately,
the silly girl must have forgotten that when a defendant is a woman, the burden
of proof rests with them � she had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she
was innocent of the offense charged.

����������� Judge
Franklin, a college roommate of Roger McMalley�s, nevertheless stated that he
felt some �sympathy� for the defendant.�
Her actions, however, had given him no choice but to pass a sentence upon
her.� Having been advised by Mr.
McMalley�s lawyers that a humiliation sentence would be preferable to a
custodial sentence, Judge Franklin stuck to a well-known path in passing
sentence.� �Melanie Barren,� he intoned.
�You are hereby sentenced as follows:�
You are to have the Inhibitor Device permanently installed, and are to
be employed for a minimum period of six years as Scullery Maid to Mr. Roger
McMalley.�

����������� Mr.
McMalley, who had advance notice of the sentence, smiled broadly and shook his
lawyers� hands.� �She�ll be doing more
than cleaning my plates,� he told this reporter.� �And the Inhibitor just makes the penetration
more fun for me.�

����������� Melanie
Barren, as a convicted female, is of course considered immediately divorced,
and is banned for a period of 25 years from possessing a bank account, a lease,
or a jet-pack.� When this reporter
attempted to interview her, he was stopped by one of Mr. McMalley�s employees,
who informed him that Mr. McMalley had already gone ahead and paralyzed her
larynx, since he preferred not to have to listen to the sound of a servant�s
voice.

THE FACILITATOR

&nbsp;

CHAPTER 3

&nbsp;

The Walker Birth

&nbsp;

����������� I
looked at my holoscreen, which had begun to chime an
alarm.� Where had the afternoon
gone?� If I didn�t get it together, I
would be late for the Birth Ceremony at the Government
 Maternity Hospital.

����������� Once
again, I found myself strapping into the jetpack, and shooting out across the
city.� When on official Facilitator Duty,
the paths are cleared, so I had a clear flight to the GMH, reaching it by close
to 4 in the afternoon.� I landed on the
rooftop pad, and made my way by podlift down to the
basement where the Ceremony was being held.�
Halfway down, I changed my mind, and commanded the Pod to stop at the
Fifth Floor, which was the Maternity Ward.

����������� Getting
out of the Pod, I strolled along, absorbing the atmosphere of this most special
place.� Here, women came when it was time
for them to fulfill Clause II of a standard marriage contract � the production
of a child.� Here also could be found
women who were serving contractual periods as Standard Breeders � producing
children every 10 months for a minimum period of five years.� Standard Breeders were used by wealthy men
who had infertile wives, or who wanted to expand their personal families but
completely preserve their wives� looks.�
Women came to the Maternity Ward for both Type I and Type II
pregnancies.� I walked past a typical
Type I delivery room.� Painted in soft
pastel colors, a comfortable bed with real sheets stood at the middle.� Five nurses and two doctors hovered, and in
the background could be seen some of the most advanced medical machines
currently on the market.� Women who
carried boys had access to the best doctors and nurses.� Pain medication was liberally dispensed during
delivery, C-Sections were done with nanolasers so
that scarring and post-operative complications were minimized, and, best of all
for many women, the delivery service and post-natal hospital stays were
completely free.

����������� Type
II deliveries were somewhat less comfortable.�
Women performed the delivery of female infants in wards.� They were attended by nurses but only one
junior doctor covered every five births.�
C-Sections were available for emergencies only, and were done with the
old-fashioned scalpel and gut stitching.�
Pain medication was limited to a single dose, although additional doses
could be purchased at cost price.� A
standard delivery and stay in the hospital ward for two days cost $100,000,
while C-Section prices could raise that cost into the millions.� This was why many females started their life
already in debt.� Nevertheless, women who
managed to deliver girls were still cared for � in a humane way.

����������� Arguably,
this was not the case for those women unlucky enough to be given a Birth
Ceremony.� And it was to one of these
ceremonies that I was running late!

����������� I
returned to the Pod, and ordered it to take me to the basement.� I emerged into gloomy darkness.� Cinderblock walls, painted a dull green,
stretched out on both sides in front of me.�
The cracked tile floor had puddles of water, and the few nuclear lights
were purposely shielded so that they let out only a smear of yellow
lighting.� I didn�t need light to find my
way, however.� All I had to do was follow
the screams.

����������� I
pulled down some info on the patient from the NanoWeb
as I walked, catching up on the sentencing and progress of the pregnancy.

����������� Miriam
Walker was the fourth wife of a school principal.� Widowed at 28, she had been left as a bequest
to the principal, who wished to have another set of children now that he had
retired.� Mrs. Walker had been
unsuccessful in conceiving a child for six months, and was sent to her doctor
for investigation.� The physical exam was
inconclusive, so Mrs. Walker was given truth serum.� Under further questioning by the doctor, she
revealed that she was illicitly taking birth control pills, a Class B criminal
offense.� Mrs. Walker could have been
sentenced to 15 years in prison, but Mr. Walker did not want his new wife to
spend time in prison.� Instead, he asked
that she be given an AIM choice.� Mr.
Walker selected a Level IV Birthing Ceremony.�
This meant that from the list of potential symptoms, Mr. Walker chose six
for his wife, and she would not be aware of any of the choices until they began
to occur.� I blinked to the next page in
the file, and saw the document in which they had selected her choices,
highlighted in bold:

&nbsp;

Mr. Walker�s Selections:

16 month pregnancy:� Woman
will remain pregnant for 16 months, growing at normal rate.

Pre-eclampsia:� Woman will have symptoms of pre-eclampsia (high blood pressure, dizziness, discomfort, swollen feet) throughout pregnancy.

Third Degree Tearing:� Woman
will have third degree inter-anal tearing during delivery, resulting in fecal
incontinence and sexual discomfort for 9 months after delivery.

Lactation:� Woman will breastfeed for 18 months after delivery.

Morning Sickness:� Woman will
suffer from severe morning sickness (cramps and vomiting) throughout pregnancy.

Clothing:� Woman will wear
normal clothing and high heels throughout pregnancy.

����������� In
addition, of course, Mrs. Walker had been collared for the past 16 months, so
that any observer would know that this was a Birthing Ceremony, not a normal
pregnancy.� And now her �due date� had
come, and the birth was being induced.

����������� I
walked into the next room to greet the mom to be.� She was positively grotesque.� Her belly, swollen to almost unimaginable
proportions, strained against a lycra
miniskirt.� She was tottering in
four-inch pumps, her ankles so swollen that they disappeared into her
calves.� Every ten seconds or so, she
doubled over, screaming, as a particularly nasty contraction cramped through
her insides.

����������� �Good
afternoon, Mrs. Walker,� I said.� �My
name is Michael Wilson, and I am happy to tell you that you are within two
hours of delivery.�

����������� She
attempted to smile.� Surely, I thought,
she should be relieved.� She had been
here for almost 24 hours now, and the only medication she received in that time
was designed to induce and increase contractions, cramping her terribly.

����������� �Please,
sir, may I at least sit for a moment?�� I
checked the file.

����������� �No,
Mrs. Walker,� I replied.� �Your file
doesn�t say anything about being allowed to sit or lie down during
delivery.� Would you like me to get a
chain and lash you upright?�

����������� �No
� no � I will keep trying.�

����������� �Good.� How are you feeling?�

����������� �It
hurts, really badly.� But I suppose I
should be grateful that this horrible time in my life is coming to an end.�

����������� �The
birth of a child is a wonderful moment,� I admonished her.� �It�s a shame you�re not having a child!�

����������� She
grimaced, blushing from the shameful knowledge of what squirmed inside of her.

For the real beauty of the Birthing
Ceremony wasn�t just the humiliation and discomfort that the �pregnant� women
underwent while carrying.� It was what,
exactly, they carried inside their wombs.

����������� Before
it was time for the delivery, I had to ask Mrs. Walker a few official questions
for the file.� Checking to make sure that
the camera in the room (otherwise empty except for a metal sink, a post for the
mother to grip, and a chair for an observer to sit on) was operating, I printed
a document from my wrist terminal and began to read the questions, recording
Mrs. Walker�s responses for later transcription.

����������� �How long have you been pregnant, Mrs. Walker?�

����������� �Ages.� I � Aaargh!�� She screamed as a wicked pain shot through
her gut.� �I, I think it�s been longer
than normal.�

����������� �Has
it been sixteen months?�

����������� She
stood there quietly for a moment, thinking, and went pale as the realization
hit her.� �Yes, Sir.�� I checked the first box on the sheet.

����������� �Have
you had the following symptoms � high blood pressure, dizziness, and swollen
ankles?�

����������� �Yes, sir.� My blood
pressure is consistently high nowadays � 150/92 at my last check.� I feel dizzy and have terrible headaches.�

����������� �That�s
good.� You have had pre-eclampsia.� Luckily it
can�t hurt what�s inside you, and should clear up in the next few months.�� She smiled weakly.

����������� �Next.� Have you had any morning sickness?�� She groaned.

����������� �It�s
been pretty awful.� I throw up three or
four times a day, and can�t eat much anything.�

����������� �Have
you been on a special diet?�

����������� �No
sir.� Mr. Walker has kept me eating spicy
foods throughout the past few months.�

����������� �Just one last question.�
What size are your breasts at the moment?�

����������� �They
are 42-FFF, Sir.�

����������� �And
what size bra do you wear every day?�

����������� �Mr.
Walker has not allowed me to purchase new clothes, so I am still wearing the
35-B bras that I used to wear.� He has
been kind enough to allow me to attach elastic to the back, but it really,
really hurts.�� I nodded.

����������� �Do
you have any questions for me?� I asked her.

����������� �Yes
Sir, if I may.�� I nodded.

����������� �Sir,
will � will my body go back to normal?�

����������� �I�m
not sure � the file isn�t clear.� You
should talk to Mr. Walker and see if he has any plans.� Certainly your body will not go back to what
it was without surgical intervention � FFF breasts don�t shrink, so you�ll have
some serious sagging there, and all that excess skin around your �pregnant�
belly � that will take some time to go away, if ever.�� I noticed that she was crying even harder
than she had been when I first came in.

����������� �Sir,
it really hurts.� This is hell for
me.�� I looked at my watch.� 

����������� �The
final contractions should begin soon, and then you�ll get to see your baby.�

����������� �Sir,
what is it that�s inside of me?�

����������� �You�ll
see.�

I attached a monitor to her
disgustingly swollen middle.� Bending
down in front of it, I set the timer to 49 minutes, and set the contractions to
grow in duration and frequency.� I also
set the timer for the Tearing, which would take place 90 seconds before birth.

����������� I
patted Mrs. Walker on the cheek, and went out to get a cup of coffee, locking
the door behind me as I left.� Mrs.
Walker wasn�t going anywhere, and I needed my caffeine fix.� Besides, I could always watch the progress of
her delivery on the NanoWeb.

����������� About
40 minutes later I returned.� Normally at
a birth we would have doctors and nurses standing by, but at a Birthing
Ceremony none of this was necessary.� The
timing devices had very small medical probes that inserted into the woman�s
pregnant flesh, and while this was not very comfortable, it ensured that
medical disasters were unlikely.� 

����������� Mrs.
Walker was pale, her skin ashen and her eyes swollen from crying.� Her voice, when she spoke, was hoarse.� �This� is eating me alive,� she said.� 

����������� �Yes,�
I replied.� �Your baby is very active,
and wants out.� Now, spread your legs, so
I can insert the probe and check the baby�s progress.�� She nodded weakly and spread her legs,
grimacing as I inserted a rounded probe that I had brought with me in my case.

����������� The
probe showed that the baby was less than four inches away from birth, and that
Mrs. Walker was fully dilated.� Any
minute now, she would be a mother at last.

����������� �Mrs.
Walker,� I warned her.� �In about a
minute, you�re going to feel a sharp pain inside your vagina and rectum.�

����������� �But
I hurt already down there � what�s going on?�

����������� �It�s
nothing to be afraid of, Mrs. Walker.�
Mr. Walker chose you to have a Tearing, so that is what you will be
feeling.� The baby is going to split your
vagina and perineum, and, I�m afraid, part of your anus.� The feeling is, well, I don�t really
know.� But I�m told the feeling is quite
uncomfortable.� Be brave.�

����������� She
nodded, shaking.� �What will happen
after?� she quavered.

����������� �Oh,
you should be able to go to the bathroom normally again in about a year or
so.�� She moaned.� �And adult diapers are fairly cheap, so
hopefully Mr. Walker will buy you some.�

����������� �What about �� she stopped, weeping.

����������� �Sex?� She nodded miserably.

����������� �Some
husbands release their wives from that requirement, but that tends to be if
they are injured giving birth.� I doubt
Mr. Walker will want to stop having intercourse with you.� I suggest you ask him for pain medication.
And �� I stopped as she began to scream at the top of her lungs.� Blood suddenly poured out from between her
legs, pooling in a slick and sticky mass on the floor.� The Tearing had occurred.

����������� �Alright,
Mrs. Walker, you may sit down and raise your legs for the final push now,� I
said.� Still screaming, she sat on her
ass in the pool of blood and raised her legs.

����������� �Push,
Mrs. Walker, your baby needs to come out!��
She gasped, grunted, and with an almighty heave, trembling in every
limb, pushed again.

����������� Out
popped a shiny black oval, covered in spiked knobs and coated in blood.� Mrs. Walker screamed and screamed at the sight
of the monstrosity.

����������� �Here�s
your baby!� I said, unable to control my laughter.� �This is the creature that has made your life
hell for the past 16 months.�

����������� That
is what happened with Birthing Ceremonies.�
16 months ago, just after sentencing, Mr. Walker inserted a vaginal
suppository inside Mrs. Walker while she slept.�
Inside of the suppository was the Nanoseed of this robot, which quickly implanted itself
inside her uterus.� Over the next 16
months, the robot grew to its birth weight of 13 pounds. �It was capable of, and had indeed performed,
numerous feats of dexterity inside the womb.�
It could imitate kicks like a human fetus, and every few days either
released a small burst of neurotoxin that caused nausea and weakness to its
host, or, in the alternative, a set of powerful electric shocks that mimicked
labor pains.� I knew from her file that
Mrs. Walker had come in to the GMH regularly over the past 7 months, convinced
that she was going into labor.� Each time
she underwent a humiliating and uncomfortable pelvic exam, before being sent
back to her husband with a bill for $5,000.

����������� I
approached Mrs. Walker, cradling the robot in my arms.� She scuttled away from me, whimpering.� �Take it away from me,� she pleaded.� �I never want to see it again!�� I shook my head.

����������� �Take
off your top, Mrs. Walker� I ordered.�
She shook her head, but her trembling fingers undid the buttons.

����������� �And the bra, Mrs. Walker.��
She actually looked relieved to remove the pinching, cutting lace from
her massive breasts.� They flopped
forward obscenely, welted from the pressure of her old bra.

����������� �Mrs.
Walker, your husband selected lactation.��
She looked at me, puzzled.

����������� �That
means you�re going to be breastfeeding for the next 18 months � 30 minutes,
every 2 hours, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.�

����������� �But,
but, I don�t have a baby!�

����������� �Yes
you do.� It�s just not human.�

I approached with a large
syringe.� �This will hurt, but it�s
necessary to induce lactation.�� It was a
cocktail with an acidic base and a mixture of female growth hormones.� I injected half the syringe into each nipple,
and they immediately began to puff up.� I
handed her the robot, and she began to moan as her exhausted arms supported its
weight.� I flipped a switch on a remote
control I carried, and deep inside the robot, circuits switched on and its Nanobrain took over.

����������� A
cover slid back on one side of the oval, and a two-pronged metal rod
emerged.� One prong ended in a pincer,
the other in a hollow tube that was lined with diamond-capped points.� The pincer shot out and grabbed hold of Mrs.
Walker�s right nipple, pinching and twisting.�
She screamed, but this was comfort itself compared to what happened next
� the tube slid forward and fastened to her left nipple, where it began a
rotating suction.� Within moments, a pink-tinged milk began to flow into the robot.

����������� �15
minutes each side, Mrs. Walker.� If you
fail to switch the robot, my Department will be immediately warned, and you
will become eligible for completion of your 15 year prison sentence.� The robot will play an alarm every 30
minutes, and if you do not have it fastened to your breast within two minutes
of the alarm going off, then we will be notified as well.�

����������� �What
about my job?� she asked.

����������� �You
had better quit,� I replied.� �Or take
your baby to work.�

I gathered my things and began to
head for the door.� As I reached, I
turned back to see how the new mother and baby were bonding.� The robot suckled away contentedly, while
Mrs. Walker rocked back and forth, blood still pooling beneath her ruined genitalia.

����������� �Oh,
one last thing,� I remarked, over my shoulder.�
�You have about 10 minutes to clean this room up and clear out.� We have Mrs. Jefferson coming in at 5:15 for
her birth.�
