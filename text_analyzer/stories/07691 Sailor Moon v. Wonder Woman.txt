Title: Sailor Moon v. Wonder Woman

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Wonder Woman choose to fly her invisible jet to Japan. She was more than a woman, she was an amazon and she deserved better than to sit in a crowded plan next to a fat man and a crying kid. Peanuts and a soda? No thank you. Wonder Woman would enjoy the abundant leg room of her private jet and land it in a semi-secluded air strip in Japan. She was on her way to visit the Sailor Scouts. Wonder Woman wasn&#8217;t so much excited as curious. She was not 100% sure she could believe that high school girls could fight off hordes of evil characters, and certainly didn&#8217;t approve of what she felt was inappropriately revealing outfits for girls of that age. But all that was going to change. Wonder Woman was going to take this opportunity to steer these girls in the right direction, and to make them into better and classier super heroes. Wonder Woman put her jet into autopilot and took out the invitation she received from the Sailor Scouts.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dear Wonder Woman/Diana 
It would be an honor if you would visit us. All of us Sailor Scouts have heard of your adventures from the past and we cannot wait to meet you in person. It seems as if you have a lot of free time on your hands, so I (on the behalf of all the Sailor Scouts) humbly invite you to spend a weekend at our house. Please call us at your earliest convenience and we will set aside time from our busy schedule and show you around Japan�(the rest of the letter had a phone number and was signed by all of the sailor scouts).

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Wonder Woman did not like the tone of voice in the letter. She was Wonder Woman after all and an amazon princess. She had a lasso that could force anyone to tell the truth. She was a member of the super friends. And what was this snide comment about �our busy schedule�. What have the sailor scouts done recently. Sure they had a live action show, but wasn&#8217;t their anime more popular anyways. Wonder Woman thought the sailor scouts have been laying low since the late 90&#8217;s or 2004 if you count the live action. It didn&#8217;t matter to Wonder Woman, she is a dignified woman who was fighting the axis powers of World War 2, long before anyone even thought about high school girls with magical powers.

Several hours later�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Wonder Woman landed her invisible plane and changed her clothes into her Diane appearance. She was going to be out in public and didn&#8217;t want to draw attention (as if somehow an invisible jet was discreet). Diane gathered her bags and spotted a cabbie holding a sign that said �Diane� on it. The letter included that the Sailor Scout&#8217;s would have a cab waiting for her. Diane introduced herself to the cabbie, showed her i.d and got into the backseat. The cabbie made some comment that Diane reminded him of someone.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Have I seen you before, you look a lot like that actress from some 70&#8217;s show� said the cabbie

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve never seen you before, this is my first time in Japan�, said Diane

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well, there was this show I watched back in the day. Had this American floozy in it. Me and my dad liked watching her boobs jiggle� said the cabbie.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m glad to hear that you and your dad get along� said Diane.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I remember the actresses name now, it was Lynda Carter. I use to watch her on that one show. I can&#8217;t remember the name of it. Back when I was a boy, I use to have fantasies about her�, said the cabbie.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Do you mean a fantasy that she saved you from some evil villain?� asked Diane

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No, usually that we got naked in my bedroom and had dirty sex� said the cabbie.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m sure she would never do such a thing and besides, what about the sailor moon girls? They wear those schoolgirl outfits that show a lot of thigh. They run around in at all hours of the night and day. And did anyone notice that when the girls transform into sailor scouts, they change into their outfits right there on the spot. Do they have no shame, undressing and dressing right there, in front of everybody?�, asked Diane.

�Ok, then tell me this, why does a woman run around by herself in a brightly colored bathing suit with a rope. If that doesn&#8217;t say please tie me up and do things to me, then what does it say?� asked the cabbie.

(awkward silence)

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The cab dropped Diane off at her destination. Diane offered to pay the fare, but the cabbie said that the fare was already paid. Diane thought she heard the cabbie call her a bitch as he drove off.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Diane checked to make sure she had the right address. The house looked like a typical middle-class home. The house had a gate and an intercom. Diane liked that the Sailor Scouts were smart about their security. Diane buzzed the intercom and announced that she had arrived. Sailor Moon told Diane that she would be out in minute. Diane asked why she could not just be let in, since she was expected and it was obviously her. Diane heard laughing on the other side.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All of the sailor scouts came outside and stood about 10 feet away from the fence. They all said hi and introduced themselves (Sailor: Moon, Mercury, Mars, Venus, and Jupiter).

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Hi, I am Diane, but please, call me Wonder Woman� said Diane.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�How de we know you are the real Wonder Woman, you came dressed in civilian clothes?� asked Sailor Moon.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Are you serious? You guys invited me. I am Wonder Woman. You can look up my picture online� said Diane.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh we&#8217;ve seen Wonder Woman&#8217;s picture online many times, but you don&#8217;t look like her� said Sailor Mercury.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�We can&#8217;t let you in until we have a positive i.d that you are who you say you are. Just show us an i.d and we can let you in� said sailor Jupiter.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Diane knew she could use her bracers to knock the gate down, but she was not a criminal and therefore would not damage private property. On the other hand, Wonder Woman did not have an i.d. That was one of the drawbacks when you are in superhero mode more often than you are under the disguise as a regular person. No one believes you are who you say you are, unless you are dressed accordingly. Diane had an i.d, but Wonder Woman did not and there was not a nearby public restroom to change in.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I know you might find this beneath you, but why don&#8217;t you transform into your Wonder Woman outfit, right here on the spot. I&#8217;m sure you don&#8217;t mind undressing and dressing in front of everybody, if you don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s too shameful.� said Sailor Mercury.

Diane was getting red in the face. She was about to give these girls and earful. The sailor scouts started laughing. 

�Don&#8217;t be so uptight. Just show us the lasso of truth and we will know its you� said Sailor Moon.

Diane pulled out the lasso of truth. The Sailor Scouts looked at it and pretended to not be impressed.

�Here it is girls, so can you let me in?� asked Diane.

�And how do we know it is the lasso of truth, you might be lying to us?� asked Sailor Jupiter.

�Would you be satisfied if you tied me with the lasso, and I was FORCED to tell the truth� asked Diane.

All of the Sailor Scout girls nodded their heads. Diane passed the lasso to Sailor Moon through the gate and then Sailor Mars let Diane walk in. Sailor Moon held the lasso in her hand and started to twirl it.

�Look at me, I&#8217;m a cowgirl, and I&#8217;m gonna tie me up a big ol super hero� said Sailor Moon.

Sailor Moon tossed the lasso and it landed around Diane&#8217;s neck. 

�Are you Wonder Woman?� asked Sailor Moon.

�Yes, I am Wonder Woman, now can I take the lasso off?� replied Diane.

�No, I don&#8217;t think so. This is too cool. Your telling me, that as long as this lasso is around you, you have to tell the truth?� asked Sailor Moon.

�Yes, that is correct� said Diane as she reached under the lasso in an attempt to remove it from her neck

Sailor Moon pulled on the lasso and it tightened around Wonder Woman&#8217;s neck. Wonder Woman&#8217;s hands were held to her neck by the lasso, so her hands were immobile.

�Look dammit, I am your guest and more importantly an amazon princess and I deserve respect. I have bracers that could blow a hole in the wall of your house.� said Diane

�And where are those bracers now?� asked Sailor Moon

�In my bag, along with my power belt and the rest of my Wonder Woman outfit� replied Diane.

�Thank you for telling me that. You won&#8217;t need to be blowing up our house while you are here, so I will make sure you don&#8217;t have access to those things�, said Sailor Moon.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Diane realized that she had gotten off on the wrong foot. She insulted the Sailor Scouts before she even arrived at their house, and she just made a threat to blow a hole in their home. She wanted this to be a successful meeting of super hero women, therefore she was going to be on her best behavior.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Your right, I don&#8217;t need my bracers or power belt to visit with your girls. Please feel free to hide it away in your house from the big bad Wonder Woman. Even look inside to make sure I am the real Wonder Woman. And I will happily wear the lasso and answer all your questions, truthfully� said Diane as she slipped her hands free from the lasso, but leaving it around her neck.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Sailor Venus, please take Wonder Woman&#8217;s bag up to her room, everyone else, please follow me� said Sailor Moon. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Everybody walked inside the house. Wonder Woman spotted the comfortable looking couch in the living room and was walking straight toward it, until she felt a tug on her neck.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Wow there Bessy, slow down. In Japan, when you enter a home, you take your shoes off. Speaking of which, did you make a point to learn Japanese culture before you visited?� asked Sailor Moon.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No, I don&#8217;t really know anything about Japan or its culture. I was more interested in being a role model for you girls. How old are you girls? High school age, so about 17? You&#8217;re out fighting big tough monsters and wielding magic that I&#8217;m not sure you don&#8217;t fully understand. Your not even old enough to vote; yet you are all risking your lives. You need a strong adult female presence to guide you into womanhood.� said Wonder Woman as she unlaced and removed her trademark red knee high boots (the only part of her Wonder Woman costume she was wearing).

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sailor Mars picked up one of the red boots and held it up beside Wonder Woman, so that the heel was just beneath her hip and the top cuff was at about the middle of her breast.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Excuse me, what are you doing?� asked Wonder Woman

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I noticed something. One of your boots is the same length as your corset, that means your boots are 50% of your costume. That means if you were in your Wonder Woman outfit, you just took off half of your clothing, you&#8217;re practically naked.� Said Sailor Mars.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I also have a tiara, don&#8217;t forget that� said Wonder Woman.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The girls walked into the living room. There was a 5-seat couch, room for each of the Sailor Scouts. Wonder Woman waited to be offered a seat, but realized she was going to have to sit on the floor.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Now that we are all settled, I can get down to business�� Wonder Woman was trying to say, before she was interrupted.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Actually, we have something to offer you. We don&#8217;t have time to cook dinner or clean the house. We need an extra pair of hands around the house� Said Sailor Jupiter.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Ah, you poor girls, you miss the comfort of home. Don&#8217;t worry, Im sure the five of you can find a way to split the chores and help each other out� said Wonder Woman.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Actually, what we had in mind was, you would become a live in maid. Your last movie, or should I say attempt at a movie was a flop. I really think you need to find a new occupation, don&#8217;t you think so?� asked Sailor Mercury.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes I do�I mean no. I mean, lets stop talking about me and talk about you five� said Wonder Woman

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Was the movie released in theaters?� asked Sailor Moon.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No, it was direct to DVD� said Wonder Woman.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�And when a movie goes straight to DVD, isn&#8217;t that a red flag, that the movie isn&#8217;t very good, or at best, not that popular?� asked Sailor Jupiter.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes, that&#8217;s right. But look at the last Superman movie. That movie was horrible. The older Superman movies were so much better� offered Wonder Woman.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That&#8217;s right. But atleast Superman has some good movies, how many live action movies do you have?� asked Sailor Venus after returning from dropping off Wonder Woman&#8217;s bag in one of the bedrooms.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�None, but I am a comic book icon. I fought Nazi&#8217;s. I have been fighting evil since 1941.� said Wonder Woman.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�But what are the popular American comic books right now? Watchman is the only graphic novel to have appeared on Time&#8217;s 2005 all-time greatest novel list, not to mention the movie that it is based on did very well. Sandman is the only comic to ever win the World Fantasy Award. Have the Wonder Woman comics come close to winning any accolades?� asked Sailor Venus.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No, they haven&#8217;t, but how about the Sailor Moon series. What awards have they won. What message do the Sailor Scouts offer to the world?� asked Wonder Woman.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�We never said we won awards, but we never pretended to be role models either� said Sailor Mercury.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�In fact, we are getting out of fighting monsters. All of us Sailor Scouts will soon be out of high school and it will be time to find full-time jobs. We won&#8217;t have time to be Sailor Scouts. We already run our own clothing business part-time, and plan on going full-time once we graduate, which is in about 2 months.� Said Sailor Mars.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You can&#8217;t give up fighting evil now, you are in your prime.� said Wonder Woman.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Are you serious? This house does not pay for itself. We&#8217;re struggling to make the house payments as is. Fighting evil does not pay the bills.� Said Sailor Jupiter.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Tell me. Is Steve Trevor your sugar daddy? Does he supplement your wage as a side kick on the super friends in exchange for your �company�?� asked Sailor Mercury.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes he is. But why should that matter, I like to be treated like a lady sometimes� replied Wonder Woman.

�And what will happen once he learns you are 68 years old, what if he finds a younger woman?� asked Sailor Mars.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I don&#8217;t know. I could go into modeling� offered Wonder Woman.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�But, there is already an abundance of erotic fan fiction and fan art out there. There is nothing the fans have not already seen or imagined� said Sailor Mercury.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�And what makes you think I want to become your maid. Would you even pay me minimum wage? Hah, I am a princess. I will never do manual labor.� said Wonder Woman.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�We thought you might say that. The thing is, we don&#8217;t plan on paying you. We just thought that your room and board would be enough. Three meals a day, we have a room for you and since you will be busy with the house chores and not leaving the house that often, you won&#8217;t need much of a wardrobe.� said Sailor Moon.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While Sailor Moon was talking, Sailor Jupiter walked up beside Wonder Woman and slammed her knee into the side of her head. Wonder Woman was knocked out and was now taking a nap on the floor.

(20 minutes later)

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Wonder Woman woke up with a headache. The last thing she remembered was falling sideways onto the floor (she didn&#8217;t get a good look at who hit her). She noticed two things. She was tied to a bed and she was naked. The lasso was no longer around her neck, but now tied her hands to the corners of the bed. The laces from her boots were used to tie her toes to the bed (this was done with each lace tied to a corner of the foot board and the other end tied around a toe, which is more painful and more restricting that tying it around the ankle. This also forced her legs to be spread open). She saw model planes hanging from the ceiling, a poster with several American super heroes including Wonder Woman and legos on the floor. She figured she was in the bedroom of a 12-year-old boy, but she only remembered seeing girls in the house. Was she still in the same house?

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The door opened and two people walked in. She recognized Sailor Moon right away, but not the young boy beside her. Sailor Moon was still dressed in her schoolgirl clothes, but the boy was only wearing a towel around his waist and wore a gold belt like a sash. Sailor Moon walked up beside Wonder Woman and started to rub the inside of Wonder Woman&#8217;s bare thigh. This felt good and uncomfortable at the same time and caused Wonder Woman to twitch.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What the hell is going on, I demand you release me. I plan on reporting this to the super friends� said Wonder Woman

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I don&#8217;t think so. See this charming boy here? His name is Shingo and he is my little brother. And because I am such a nice sister, I am giving him his first girlfriend� said Sailor Moon.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I doubt that boy can penetrate me� said Wonder Woman.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Your half right, he can&#8217;t penetrate you on a normal day, but today is not normal. He is wearing your power belt. I always wondered what would happen if someone had sex while wearing your power belt� said Sailor Moon

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I don&#8217;t know, but I think it would give the person amazing sexual energy. The person on the receiving end would have an earth shattering orgasm. But that doesn&#8217;t matter now, because I refuse to have sex with a minor� said Wonder Woman, still unable to lie because she was still wearing the lasso.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Your hardly in a position to make demands. What if this belt makes me bigger than any man you have been with? I bet you will be begging for my cock by the time I&#8217;ve nailed you� said Shingo.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�AAhhhh. You two are so cute together. I&#8217;m going to leave you two alone, so you guys can get to know each other better� said Sailor Moon as she left the room. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shingo dropped his towel and was completely naked, except for the belt. Wonder Woman gasped at the size of his junk. It had to be 10 inches. It would have looked comical on such a young boy, except that she knew she was going to be raped very soon.
Shingo, while still a virgin and did not understand the delicate art of foreplay, therefore decided to get right down to business. Shingo crawled into the bed, got between her legs and started pumping away. Shingo did penetrate her and then some. Wonder Woman was use to the strength that the belt provided, now she was without it.&nbsp; She has never been fucked by a boy, much less one with a hard on of mythical proportion. 

Shingo loved hearing Wonder Woman scream. The strings that held Wonder Woman&#8217;s toes to the bed eventually snapped, but this allowed Shingo to put her legs over his shoulders. He fucked her for 2 hours straight. He couldn&#8217;t decide if he liked fucking her in her sleep after she passed out, or while she was awake better. Once Shingo was done, he got dressed and left to get a snack. Wonder Woman didn&#8217;t have several orgasms, she had one epic orgasm that came in waves. Her body was still squirming from pleasure long after the ordeal. Wonder Woman slept through the rest of the weekend. Shingo didn&#8217;t mind sharing his bed with her, she was a quiet sleeper and her breasts made nice pillows. Shingo did not know what Wonder Woman dreamed about, but he knew what he was dreaming of. He imagined taking her to the beach, her in a string bikini, and using his new found strength to strip her and chase Wonder Woman, her breasts flapping like crazy on account of running bare foot on hot sand.
