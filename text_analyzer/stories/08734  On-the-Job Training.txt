On-the-Job Training

By Didmaker


Madelyn Patterson sat at her desk in the cubical assigned to her. After a rather messy divorce that left her with almost nothing since her dead beat ex husband had moved their assets out of the country and her lawyer had not made the effort to track it down, she was now working as a low level assistant at a large export import company. The pay check was too small to support the life she grown accustomed to during her marriage and she gritted her teeth over her situation. At 36 she had suddenly been replaced by a younger version of herself and her husband had simply cheated her out of any alimony as well. 

To hide her shame from her old friends she had moved out of state and taken this job. She broke all ties with her old life in an effort to cope with her new life as a minimum wage office worker. She felt humiliated by the whole situation and wanted nothing more than to get back at the man responsible for it. She hadn't yet made any friends in the city and she felt no real connection with her co-workers in the cubicles around her. They where for the most part younger than her and was working their way up the corporate ladder. Madelyn felt no such ambition in her soul and after 3 months at this desk she felt as if it would be her place the rest of her life.

As the day wore on she continued to look at the clock, wishing it to reach magic hour. Not that she particularly relished in the thought of going home to an empty one room apartment. The solitude had begun to eat at her nerves and she found herself putting on weight as she spent her nights and weekends in front of the small TV while trying to fill the hole inside of her with snacks. Her old clothes still fitted but if she continued to comfort eat she would soon need a new wardrobe. She looked down on her round belly as it showed through the dark blue fabric of her blouse. Maybe she should join a gym again, she had loved going to the gym back home. Home, she thought, no this city was home now. Could she even afford a gym? Probably not a nice one anyway. She sighed and glanced at the clock for the umpteenth time this afternoon and found it just a few minutes shy of magic hour.

Gathering her things and turning of the computer she took her large shoulder bag and left her cubical. Saying empty goodbyes and see you tomorrow to her co-workers she made her way over to the printer room. After a quick look to the sides she stepped inside and closed the door behind her. She opened her back and moved over to the supply shelves and grabbed a few nick knacks she could use around the flat such as pens, notebooks and other office supplies. Suddenly there was a flash and she froze, her hand almost in her bag holding a couple of pencils. She spun around her as her heart thumped hard and sweat beginning to form on her forehead. Her head felt cold and numb.

Standing in the corner, obscured by a large cabinet stood the young man that pushed the mail cart around the office. He smiled humourlessly at her and he was holding a camera.

- Well well, caught you red-handed eh? 

He took a step out from the corner and took another picture of her as she stood there feeling her stomach turn. 

- Now, what should I do about this huh? I could report you to the floor manager and that would mean you get sacked right away.

She felt tears welling up as her body trembled. Fired? No, this could not be happening.

- Please, I...

- Quiet.

His voice was still low but the steel in it made her close her mouth again.

- Now, I could turn you in for stealing from the company and the pictures would prove it. He waved the camera in front of her. Or...

He smiled at her and she felt liek a deer in the headlights of a speeding semi.

- Or we could simply solve this between us. After all, what would be gained by you loosing your job. 

She felt herself grow numb all over. Her brain not really functioning and panic was building. What did he want?

- So, do you want to keep your job, Ms Patterson?

She swallowed hard and looked away from him. Her voice trembled and seemed to come from a long way away.

- yes

- I can't hear you, Ms Patterson. 

She raised her voice and answered him again, looking into the floor.

- Yes.

- Yes what?

- Yes, I would like to keep my job. 

She trembled as the words hit her. She needed to keep this job. She had been lucky landing it since all her training was old and practically useless. If she got fired her and because of stealing, what chances had she of another job? 

- Good, if you do something for me I will in turn not do something. 

She nodded, dreading what ever it was this young man wanted from her.

- Excellent. Put down your bag on the floor.

She hesitantly let the bags shoulder strap slide down her arm and land on the floor beside her feet. It fell over spilling some of her things. 

- Now, I want you to look at me and smile.

She raised her head and tried to smile but it felt hollow, a tear ran down her left cheek.

- Wipe that tear and try a bit harder please.

She used her hand to remove the tear and then took a deep breath and did her best to shine a smile at him.

*flash*

- Good girl. Now, unbutton your blouse please.

Her mind reeled and her head shot up and she stared at him in disbelief. He was not smiling anymore.

- I will not ask again. 

She lowered her head and with humiliation stinging her she slowly started to unbutton her dark blue blouse. 

*flash*

- Good, now drag it apart and show me your tits. 

With hands trembling and ice-cold dread in her stomach she pulled her blouse open and revealed her tits, tightly enclosed in a bra.

*flash*

- Nice, you have quite the pair there, Ms Patterson. Pull them out of the bra.

Shame and humiliation burned on her face as she drew her shoulder straps down to make it easier to free her breast from the confines of the bra. She knew she had a decent pair, the 38D twins had been her ex husbands favourite playthings until he got himself a younger and larger pair on that bimbo. Her breast fell free of the bra and wobbled a bit as they enjoyed their freedom.

*flash*

- Very nice. Now, with your hands, grip each tit and then look at me smiling. And hurry up; someone might come in here any moment.

She hadn't thought about that, someone else coming in here and seeing her like this. She hesitantly placed a hand under each breast and held them as she raised her head and looked straight at him forcing a smile to her blushing face. 

*flash* 

- Your a natural, Ms Patterson. 

She stood stil awaiting the rest but was puzzled by that he now pocketed the camera. He smiled at her again and she felt an odd tingling in her by the way he looked at her.

- Ok, that's it for now. 

He stepped forward and reached out a hand. He stroked her left breast with a single finger and the touch shot like electricity through her. She hadn't been touched by someone else for over a year now. She found her self wanting more but the man withdrew his hand.

- You are not to wear any bras to work again, Ms Patterson. 

- What..?

- You heard me the first time. No bras in the future. 

She blushed deeply and lowered her head again. 

- Ok, button up again and get out of here. 

He turned around and walked over tot he door, placing a hand on the doorknob he looked over his shoulder at her.

- See you later, Ms Patterson.

And with that he opened the door and walked out, leaving her standing there with her breast hanging out over her bra, her blouse open wide. She heard footsteps and quickly drew her bra up and turned away from the door as she started to button the blouse. She then stood there just breathing a while feeling the room moving under her. What had just happened?

----


The next morning while getting dressed, Madelyn hesitated when grabbing the bra. She stood by the closet and held the garment in her hand, staring at it as she relived the events in the printer room yesterday. After a quick deliberation with herself she put it on and finished dressing, thinking no more of it. The little creep had gotten what he wanted so there was no more to say about it.

Later that morning the mailman pushed his trolley by her cubical and didn't even look at her. He went about his routines like nothing happened and Madelyn found herself looking after him. She shook her head and continued working feeling relaxed over the fact that everything was back to normal. She promised herself not to steal again from the company. She really needed this job. 

Late in the afternoon she went down to the archives to get background material. Walking along the rows of boxes on the shelves she soon found herself in a dead end. Looking down on the paper she had with the register number of the files she sought she walked in deeper to find the corresponding box. 

- Did I not instruct you never to wear a bra again to work?

She spun around and saw the mailman standing a few feet behind her. She hadn't heard him walk up behind her. His arms were crossed over his chest and his eyes slightly narrowed as he looked at her with a stern determination. She straightened herself and tried to steel herself.

- You have no right to demand anything like that.

He smiled humourless at her defiance.

- Oh, don't I? I seem to recall someone stealing and that there are photos to prove it? Or you might want that to become public knowledge together with the other photos?

His voice trailed of and Madelyn went pale. "The other photos?" she thought as ice gripped her heart, "Oh, god yes, he took photos of her when she....", Madelyn couldn't say it even to herself. 

- I...

- Didn't think so. Now, take of the bra and give it to me.

Her jaw dropped as she looked at him. Give him the bra? This was not happening. 

- I'm waiting.

Her shoulders sank and she started to unbutton her blouse, her head tilted forward. She felt her cheeks burning with the shame and she hoped no one else would turn up down here at this moment. Her mind was reeling with what she was doing. She was actually going to take of her bra and give it to him, wasn't she. He could get her fired and also publicly humiliated now. 

*flash*

Her head snapped up seeing him leering behind his camera, her blouse unbuttoned and her bra clearly visible. 

- Just a few more pictures for my collection.

"Oh, god. Not more pictures" she sobbed silently. 

- Continue.

She reluctantly took of her blouse while he continued to take pictures. He made her pause and smile, berating her when she wasn't smiling enough or it looked too strained. She removed her bra and blushed at the humiliation, standing there in the archives with her upper body nude, her breast slightly hanging in the glare of the lighting. 

- Excellent, now grab hold of your tits for me, Madelyn.

She shuddered at the command, at the same time she wanted to scream and run and yet, something held her there. She hesitantly reached up with her hands and cupped her breast's undersides. Several more pictures was taken of her humiliation.

- Very nice, you're a natural.

Natural what she wondered to herself as she smiled to the camera holding her breast. 

- Now, I want you to pull them upwards and lick them. And don't forget to smile for the camera, Madelyn, or I will have to report your criminal activities to the company.

Madelyn stared at him, she couldn't believe she heard him right. He wanted her to do what? The man sighed.

- I don't have all day. Get moving or you can start clearing out your desk. Your choice really.

Swallowing hard she started to raise her breast to her mouth and she leaned forward holding out her tongue. The flash kept popping and she wished she never had started to work at this company. Her outstretched tongue made contact with the bare skin of her left breast and she felt the smoothness against the tip of her tongue. 

- Excellent, now lick it.

She tried to smile bravely as the camera clicked over and over again as she gingerly licked her own breast. She felt the world changing around her, she had no control over what happened and she felt herself being drawn along on dark currents. It felt not half bad as her tongue dragged over the soft sensitive skin of her breast.

- See if you can suck on your nipples, Madelyn, there's a good girl.

Madelyn felt unable to prevent herself as she pressed her left breast upwards higher and sucked in her now hardening nipple in between her lips. It felt so good and her mind recalled how her ex husband had nibbled on her oh so sensitive nipples when they where making love at the beginning of their marriage. She couldn't help let a moan escape her as she teased her own nipple. Without instructions she dragged up her right nipple to receive the same treatment leaving her left breast glistening by her saliva. 

She felt herself getting warmer and her pussy was starting to tingle with pent up needs. She moaned again and massaged her breast as she licked and sucked on the nipples. Her breath was getting harder and her mind called her slut over and over again. She suddenly realised she was alone. The flash of the camera had seized and when she looked up the mailman was gone. Gone was also the bra. She blushed and quickly put on her blouse again, embarrassed and humiliated at her own reactions to that mans treatment of her. She stood there for a few minutes feeling her heart slowly return to normal and then located the files she needed and returned to her desk.

--------------

The next day Madelyn turned up for work without a bra. She found the feeling of her breast swinging free against the fabric of her blouse quite exhilarating. She had this morning sat on her bed and stared at the drawer containing her underwear for a good 20 minutes before deciding to not wear it. She had said to herself it was because the mailman might just steal it again and they did cost money. She said that it was just the practicality of the whole thing and as soon as he stopped pestering her with his so called evidence she would start using them again. Yet she had the night before masturbated while thinking of the days events down in the archive, it had left her wanting as if something was missing.

She glanced at the watch and noted that the mail would arrive soon to her floor of the building. If not anything else the mailman was at least punctual. When she heard the elevator chime a few meters away she quickly got up and made her way over to the water cooler to get some water. Walking out of her cubical she saw the mail cart emerge from the depths of the elevator and she walked towards it. When the man pushing the cart emerged she made a pointed show of not noticing him and walked by him towards the water cooler, her breast moving under her blouse to the rhythm of her walking.

"With a little luck that will be the end of it" she thought to herself and helped herself to some water. Returning to her cubical a few internal messages awaited her and a package. She frowned and studied the box for a second. It was not marked with any sender and it had only her name on it. She cut the tape and opened the lid, inside was her bra from yesterday and a stack of photos. On top of the things was a short handwritten note that she picked up and then closed the lid again before anyone would happen to see the contents.

"I see you are not wearing a bra today. Very good. Find your way to the archives again at lunch hour. I will send copies of the enclosed photos to every mail account in the company if you are not there at 12.05"

It was signed Carl. She just stared at the note. This was not happening. She had done what he asked, hadn't she? She wasn't wearing a bra. That was what he had asked of her. She swallowed. This would have to end, she would tell him at lunch. Oh, yes - she would tell him alright. Enough was enough. She grabbed the box and stuffed it into the bottom drawer on her desk and slammed it shut.

Working with her anger fuming she made quite a dent in her workload and when lunch hour neared she felt more than ready to tell "Carl" where he could shove his photos. She looked at the watch and left her cubical since it was 10 minutes to 12, more than enough time to go down to the archives in the basement. Arriving just after 12, she found the large archives empty. She stood at the entrance and saw a small envelope taped to a bookcase nearby. She went over and tore it down, pulling out the note inside she read it.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You know where I'll await you. Don't be tardy. /C"

She tore the note and envelope in pieces and threw it in the wastebasket by the door before walking over to the dead end amongst the cabinets and shelves of the archives. Anger fumed in her and she walked with heavy determined steps that echoed through the large room. Turning the corner she found him standing there in the dead end with a smile on his face.

- Are we upset over something?

- You little dip shit. 

- Tsk tsk, such language.

- Language my ass, this has gone far enough. You will hand over the photos or so help me god.

Carl took one step forward and slapped her over the face with his hand. It was not a particular hard slap but it left her momentarily stunned as the light pain travelled through her nervous system. Carl slung around her and positioned himself behind her, blocking the only way out of the dead end. She raised her hand and touched her cheek where he had slapped her and spun around. He didn't smile.

- I do not take kindly to threats, dear Madelyn. I think I will post the pictures from yesterday on the company website showing the world how good you are at sucking your own tits.

He turned around and started to walk away. Madelyn stared at his back trying to focus on what he had just said. "Post it on the company website? Anyone could see them there".

- No, please. I'm sorry. I didn't think, I...

Carl stopped; when he spoke he still had his back towards her and his voice cut through her soul like a knife, tearing her anger to shreds. She felt her resolve to stand up to him dissipate.

- No, you didn't now did you? Do you want me to post those pictures of your slutty behaviour?

She swallowed hard.

- No, please. I'll do what you ask, just don't post them I'll...

- Quiet then.

Madelyn closed her mouth.

- That's better. Remove your blouse.

Lowering her head she started to unbutton her red nylon blouse. She removed it and laid on a shelf beside her. 

- Very good, Madelyn. I think there is hope for you after all. Now lick your nipples for me.

With shaking hands she grabbed her breast and raised them up to her lower mouth and started to lick her quickly hardening nipples. Her mind swam in a sea of humiliation and desire. She moaned and her breath was quickening again. "oh god" she thought, "I'm getting turned on again by it, what's wrong with me? He's humiliating me and I get aroused?". She moaned some more and her breast was getting slick and shiny with her saliva.

- Very nice. 

Carl took a few pictures of her, the flash leaving dancing points in front of her eyes. She didn't really care. What would a few more pictures do?

- You can stop now, Madelyn.

Reluctantly she raised her head and let her breast sag down again against her chest. 

- Unbutton your slacks, Madelyn. 

She blushed again; hands trembling as she reluctantly raised them to her waist and started to unbutton her grey slacks. When done she held the slacks closed and up trying to hold on to some shred of decency, but Carl had other plans.

- Let them fall to the floor now. 

As she released the slacks they fell down and lay around her feet on the floor. Carl took a series of photos as they fell.

- Lovely. Now, stroke your pussy through your panties and do try to smile at the camera this time.

- I, I cant. Please, don't make me do it, please. I'll do anything else. Please.

- Shut up, and start.

She hesitated for a few seconds and then as her mind screamed she reached up with her right hand and rested the fingers on her panty covered pussy. 

- Good, now stroke it.

The flashes popped as she moved her fingers up and down over the contours of her outer lips, clearly sen through her white cotton panties. A wet patch began to soak through the fabric as she felt her sex start to swell under her feather like touch. She raised her head and tried her best to smile. It felt so good. She found herself whishing he would touch her instead. She longed for to be touched, if not him then anybody. It had been so long, to long by far. She closed her eyes and moaned, face blushing from the shame and tears forming under her eyelids as she realised she needed this. Her fingers started to work more forcefully over her sex and she felt the wetness of the panties.

- Pull down your panties, Madelyn. I want to see your snatch.

She shuddered as she hooked her thumbs on the inside of the panties and pushed them down. A tuft of hair came into view and then her swollen clitoris. More photos taken and Madelyn had stopped noticing. Her right hand went to her pussy and continued to stroke her engorged sex, sending trembling waves of arousal through her body. Her mind was burning and she only wanted to cum at this point. Suddenly she felt her body starting to spasm as she was hit by an orgasm that tore her sanity to shreds. She groaned and flung her head backwards, eye closet and moaned with her mouth open as the ripples of ecstasy moved through her entire being. It felt so good. Her legs buckled under her and she tried to hold herself up against a shelf, slowly sinking down on the floor.

She knelt by the shelf, chest heaving with exhaustion and tears streaming down her face. What had she done? She looked up and found that Carl had left. She cried and hugged herself feeling miserable and ashamed for her wonton sluttish behaviour. She whished she was home and never had to go back here. She whished her marriage hadn't ended and that she was back in her house, chatting with her friends instead of working for her livelihood. Suddenly she herd dimly and far away the elevator chiming. Did somebody come down here? "Oh, god" she thought, "Please don't let them see me like this."

She dragged herself upright and pulled up her panties, noticing that they were soaking wet. The humiliation burned on her face and she pulled her slacks up, quickly buttoning them. She heard steps somewhere beyond the shelves and quickly put on her blouse again. Drying her tears with her hand she quickly grabbed a few folders on a shelf nearby and then walked briskly towards the elevator, trying hard to look as calm and natural as possible. She met an older man who looked at her questionably and then she was past him and into the elevator. Her body racked with sobs as the elevator rose to her level.

Leaving the elevator she walked straight over to the lady's room, locked her self in a stall and sat on the toilet shivering, face buried in her hands as the events played over and over again in her head. She hated herself for getting aroused again by the memories. 

Later that night she masturbated again, lying in her narrow bed as the memories flowed through her mind. She wished it was his hands instead that invaded her body. That night she dreamt of being his lover and how he made her do things, things of highly questionable nature. She woke in the small hours of the night with her hands between her legs, her sheets stained by her second orgasm that night.

-----

The next day the mail was delivered as usual by Carl, but he didn't even look at her. She found it left her empty, wishing he would look at her. She blushed. 

The day wore on without anything other than the mind numbing repetition of her work. Every time the elevator chimed she looked over at it, hoping it to be Carl stepping out of it, but he didn't show up. When she returned to her cubical after short errands she always walked faster than usual, hoping there to be a note or a package. Nothing was delivered.

By the end of day she felt herself strangely relieved that the day had passed without Carl's degradation of her. "It's over and that is for the best" she thought, yet feeling a sliver of disappointment in the depths of her soul. Something had been awoken in her and she wanted more even if she would never admit to even herself that this was the case. 

The next few days went by and Madelyn's thoughts were less and less on what that transpired between her and the black mailing mail man. At the following Monday she even put on a bra again and it felt good not to have her breast swinging free against the blouses she wore. That had really messed with her concentration. 

She did however masturbate every night and sometimes in the morning. She didn't always remember her dreams but they left her needing release. She fantasized about degrading and humiliating situations, where one or more persons used her for their own pleasures. She felt dirty and ashamed afterwards, humiliated by her own dark desires.

A week after the last degrading encounter with the mail man, Madelyn found a letter addressed to her personally in the daily company mail. She felt a sinking coldness in her stomach at the same time as her heart soared. She didn't know what to make of it, was it from him? What did he want? Wasn't it over? If not, why wait a week? She hid the envelope under her keyboard and then proceeded to take care of the rest of the mail. She found it hard to concentrate and several mails had to be re-read to get some sort of coherent understanding of the contents. The mundane work of handling her work felt oddly uncomfortable and she wanted to drop everything. She felt she should be somewhere else. 

After half an hour, she was done with the pile of mail and leaned back in her chair. She stared at the keyboard and felt almost as she could stare right through it and onto the envelope under it. Her hand trembled slightly as she lifted the keyboard again and drew out the letter. On the white envelope was simply written Madelyn in upper case letters. She felt her self go cold and a shiver raced down her spine as she used the letter opener to cut open the envelope. Inside was a single sheet of paper. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"15.00, Second door on the right after elevator in archives."

There was no signature, but who else could it be from? She dropped the sheet of paper on the desk, gripped the desk with both hands and as her head sank to her chest she shuddered with dread and anticipation. What would he do?

Lunch dragged on forever and Madelyn found it hard to follow the conversations around the cafeteria table. There was the usual gossip about who was getting a promotion, who had slept with who and what plans people had for the upcoming holidays and such. She made appropriate remarks at the right places, but was other than that, miles away. 

The afternoon had the minutes move in slow motion as she performed her assigned tasks. She tried hard not to think about three o'clock. She didn't want to think about a room in the cellars or what Carl was going to do. She contemplated ignoring him; after all he had not said or done anything in a week. Her dark desires voiced a veto and she knew she would have to find out what was going to happen or else she would spend the rest of her life wondering what would have been. She also knew that if she didn't go she would have to quit her job and quite possible leave town. Those pictures would eventually find their way out onto the web and she would never be free from the degradation of them. She found that strangely appealing in all its horror.

At ten minutes to three she left her cubicle and went over to the elevator. She was thankful that the ride down was a solitaire one for her legs were shaking and she held herself up by a hand on the wall. When the doors opened with a chime she looked out in the main corridor of the first cellar, it was deserted. Under this cellar was a two level car park and a few more areas with machines and such for the office buildings maintenance. She walked out into the corridor and turned right. There was a door right next to the elevator and this was the archives. She looked further down and about twenty meters down the corridor she saw another door. 

She felt almost sick to her stomach as she walked with slow reluctant steps towards the closed door. Reaching it she stretched out her hand and tested the handle, the door was unlocked. She opened it slowly and saw a dimly lit room with a few old pieces of furniture around the walls. It looked like some sort of storage room that the janitors used for surplus materials. She stepped inside and looked around and found that she was alone. The room smelled of dust and old wood and faintly a hint of something else. She couldn't place it but her mind found it familiar. Her eyes adjusted to the dim lightning and she saw a folded sheet of paper on a desk by the wall. 

She swallowed at picked it up, recognising the handwriting se read the short command stated on it.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Remove your blouse and slacks and put them in the bottom drawer of this desk. You will find a blindfold in that drawer; you will put this on and then wait in the middle of the room until I arrive. Failure to comply will result in the launch of a new webpage on the company's server."

She felt cold and her body got heavy and hard to hold up. She staggered and leaned on the desk, paper in hand. After contemplating the order she opened the bottom drawer. In it was a black silk sleep mask with an elastic band and a red soft inside. She picked it up and placed it on the desk. She then unbuttoned her blouse and took it of, folded it and placed it in the drawer. She then removed her shoes and took of her slacks. They soon rested, folded up, on top of the blouse inside the open desk drawer. She trembled and the rooms low temperature made her shiver in her semi nakedness. 

She reread the order and then frowned for a second before putting on her low healed leather shoes again. She closed the drawer and heard a small clicking sound as it shut. She pulled at it and found it now locked. She froze and felt her heart stopp. She had just locked her only clothes inside a desk drawer and she had no key to the lock. She was in her underwear in a room in the cellar at work and anybody could be walking in on her at any moment. She felt a groan well up as she was thinking 
"no no no no". She tugged on the drawer but it was not budging.

She hung her head and felt tears burning in her eyes. "How stupid can I be?" she thought bitterly. Taking the blindfold she moved with heavy steps to the middle of the room, faced the door and put on the blind fold sending her world into darkness.

The minutes started to tick away and she shivered in the cold air in the room. She could hear the whine of the air vents but not much else; occasionally the fluorescent light above here would hum or crackle. She had her arms crossed over her chest in some sort of protection against anyone walking in and seeing her. She bit her under lip and hoped that no one else but Carl would have a reason to enter this room in the near future. The thought of being discovered by anyone else made her mouth go dry. She couldn't imagine what to say. What could one say in that situation? No amount of explaining would hide the fact she was in her underwear, wearing a blindfold in a storage room in the cellars of the building.&nbsp; 

Time dragged on and it felt like almost an hour had gone by when she hear the door handle creakingly move. She swallowed and silently begged it to be Carl. At least he had already seen her in humiliating circumstances before, it made it strangely enough easier to face him like this. She listened hard but heard no other noises. If there was anyone else in the room they where really quiet. She raised her voice and with a trembling cracked voice she voiced her question.

- Hello? Is anybody there?

She heard a sound to her right and swung her head in that direction. There was a faint smell of something else, a faint mix of strange yet familiar smells.

- Is that you, Carl? 

Her voice barely carried. She felt exposed and vulnerable and she hugged her upper body, covering her bra encased breast. Her mind screamed "You're wearing a bra". She felt her heart sinking as she realised she had broken his rule about bras. Was he mad at her, would he leave? Would he post the pictures now? She groaned.
 
She heard soft footsteps in the room moving away from her. It was followed with a large click and then silence again. Had he left? She didn't think so; it had sounded more like a lock. Had he locked the door? If so she was actually thankful for that. That meant no one else could come in, unless they had a key of course. But it also meant she was locked inside her with him. She was at his mercy now. She shuddered.

The silence pressed on her mind and she wished that who ever it was would say something, to acknowledge their presence and end her isolation. Suddenly a voice spoke and it sounded like thunder in her ears.

- Arms at your sides.

It was Carl's voice; she felt relief run through her body. She slowly lowered her arms and felt yest more exposed. She imagined his eyes roaming over her naked skin and she felt he body responding to the thought. She clenched her hands. 

- I see your wearing a bra. My mind might play tricks on me, but I seem to recall giving you instructions not the wear them anymore? His voice was heavy with a disapproving lecturing tone. 

- I...

- Quite. You will only speak when given a direct question. Is that understood?

Madelyn felt cold again. She nodded hesitantly again.

- Good. Remove the bra and your panties.

Madelyn felt her heart stop. Naked? Her whole body trembled with a mix of excitement and fear as she started to remove her bra. When her breast came free of their under wired white prison she dropped the bra to the floor beside her, not knowing what else to do. She then paused, hoping against all knowledge and logic that he would let her keep the panties on.

- And the panties, Madelyn. Don't make me repeat myself again.

She made a small pitiful noise and then slowly reached up and hooked her thumbs in the lining of the panties. She slowly pushed the down and felt the soft fabric brush against her skin. Bending she pushed the panties down her long full bodied legs and when she reached her knees she simply let gravity drag them down around her ankles. She bent down awkwardly as the blindfold jumbled her directions a little making keeping the balance harder than she would have thought. She lifted her left foot and slided of the panties and then repeated with her right foot. 

As she straightened up she covered her now naked pussy with her left hand and held her right arm lower arm over her breasts.

- Arms at the side. 

She slumped her shoulder slightly and reluctantly dragged her hands to her sides leaving her front wide open and exposed in all its naked glory.

- You broke a rule, Madelyn. You leave me no choice but to make good on the threat now. Had you but obeyed the rules then I wouldn't have had to do this, but it's out of my hands now.

Her mind reeled, he would publish the pictures. It was over.

- Please. She begged in a low voice.

- You just keep breaking the rules. I didn't ask you anything did I?

"Oh god" she wanted to cry. "It's over. Everyone will se me pleasure myself in those sordid pictures. It won't matter what I say or do, no one will believe I was forced to do it". Her body shook in a sob.

- Now, by right I should leave her and put the pictures out on the web. Shouldn't I, Madelyn?

She had never felt more alone in her life.

- Yes.

- Yes, I should. 

As his words trailed of and died she felt the silence yet again start pressing on her. Her head snapped at his next statement.

- Would you like a second chance to make things right, Madelyn?

Hope? Before she had time to think she bursted out her answer.

- Please, I'll do anything, just please don't show those pictures to anyone, please. 

She almost cried, her voice cracking and trembling. Falling silent she strained her ears, was he still there? She hadn't heard the door. It felt like an eternity dragged by in the darkness behind her blindfold until he spoke again.

- Good, now move over here.

He's voice was from her left and she turned in that direction and took a trying step, fearful of falling over. A few steps more and she felt a hand against her stomach. She almost screamed as she felt it. 

- Stand there, hands at the sides.

His voice was directly next to her now. His voice was low and almost hypnotic as it gently stroked her ears and mind.

- You broke the rules and there fore you have to receive some sort of punishment, but since publishing the photos on the web would be a bit harsh I think we can figure out a more appropriate one.

She felt his hand slip over her stomach, its touch leaving read searing lines in her mind.

- Reach out with you hands and bend over at the hips. In front of you is desk and I want you to place your hands firmly on that and stand with your arms straight. 

She wondered over this and gingerly stretched out her arms. As she slowly started to bend forward her hands soon touched the top of something wooden. The height was approximately that of a desk. 

- Now, try not to make any sounds, Madelyn.

She almost asked what he meant as her mind exploded in pain. She stood up straight again and let out a loud yelp as her hands flung backwards towards her stinging right ass cheek. 

- Hands on the desk top, Madelyn. It will only get worse if you fail in such trivial things.

Her mind tried to comprehend what had happened just then as she bent over the desk again, fear gripping her soul. Her ass burned with a low mulling pain that was quickly fading. Had he hit her? Suddenly another sting smashed her other ass cheek. She steeled her self and only tried to pull her ass away from him by her body arcing forward while her hands were flat on the desk top. She gasped.

- Better, but not good enough. Do try to stand still this time. 

She felt stunned by the events, he was spanking her? He was spanking her like she was a misbehaving little child? She wanted to rip of the blindfold and scream at him. She wanted to get dressed and leave. She wanted to... another hard smack landed on her ass and she screamed. 

- Quiet!

His command was low but forceful; she closed her mouth and whimpered. She heard him move behind her and soon she felt him standing beside her.

- Since you can't keep quiet, open your mouth.

She opened it and immediately found something soft being pushed into it between her lips. It felt like some sort of cloth and she felt him press ore of it inside her mouth and press against the tongue. She gagged as it reached the back of her tongue and she was about to reach up and pull it out what ever it was when his voice stopped her.

- Stand still. Since you can't keep quiet when asked to, your panties will have to do that job for you.

She hung her head and soon felt the fourth hard smack land on her behind, sending ripples of movement through her flab. Tears ran and was soaking the blindfold as he continued to land smack after smack on er naked exposed behind. Every time her whole body shook with the impact and she whimpered into her make shift gag. She lost count and the spanking blurred into a series of loud impacts of his hand against her soft warm skin. After a while it stopped and she just stood there shaking and crying. 

She felt his hand touch her burning ass and slowly start to caress it instead. 

- Good girl.

His voice was low and soothing. It reached her through a fog of tears and pain. She felt his hand slip in behind her legs and touch the other parts of her pussy. She felt her self responding to the touch, her lips and clitoris swelling as her mind screamed for more. She moaned.

- Oh you like that, don't you.

She blushed with her whole body at his words. She felt him stroke her most private spot and fire spread though her crotch, muting out the pain from the spanking. The pain was fading to a memory and this new sensation was so much nicer to concentrate on. He slipped a finger in between her lips and gently touched the inside. She shuddered and felt her self getting wet. 

- Well aren't you the slut, Madelyn.

Her voice was almost choking as she stuttered a yes. Her mind burning with arousal and her body screaming for more. He continued to stimulate her and she stood still as best she could, hands on the desk, body bent forward. She tried to grind herself against his hand, but every time he simply withdrew his hand a she groaned in despair. She felt tugging on the gag and it was withdrawn from her open moth as it hanged opened. She moaned louder and a string of drool hanged down her chin.

- Do you want to cum, Madelyn?

- Yes... she moaned in answer

- Are you going to obey me in the future, Madelyn?

She couldn't almost hear his voice any longer, her mind was almost gone, swimming abandoned in a sea of pleasure. 

- Anything, please... she pleaded with him.

- Are you my little slut, Madelyn?

- Yeesssss, anything. Pleeeeaseeee.

She was crying again, his hand torturing her with the promise of blessed release. Her body shaking in response to the passion and the desire filling her fevered mind.

- Very well.

She felt him move his hand and then starting to massage her in earnest. She almost fainted as the orgasm hit her head on a few minutes later, her legs buckling and she sagged to the floor, body convulsing as his hand gently continued its invasion. She almost screamed out, but only a low guttural groan escaped her mouth as she felt ecstasy like never before. Her ex husband had never been able to give something like this. 

In the haze of the afterglow she heard him stand up, leaving her lying on her side on the floor. She heard a small metallic clink beside her.

- Here is the key to your clothes. I expect you to never again disobey the dress code and in the future you are not to wear pants or slacks again. From now one I will expect you to wear only skirts. Is that understood, Madelyn?

She grunted a low yes as she started to regain some self control again. 

- Good. Get dressed and return to your post then.

She heard steps and the door lock click open and then the door open and close as he left the room. Unable to move she just laid there for several minutes, her thoughts probing what had just happened, his words slowly sipping into her conscious mind. She felt it in her bones, she was his slut now. No turning back. She felt a few bitter tears run being soaked up by her blindfold and yet her body yearned for more.


--------------

The next day Madelyn turned up for work dressed in tune with Carl's orders. She was smartly dressed in a dark grey pencil skirt reaching just below her knees and her breast moved freely inside her white satin blouse. She had spent time in front of the mirror to do her hair and make-up. She had masturbated and cum several times while thinking about yesterdays events. She had blindfolded herself with a scarf and found it enhancing the pleasure. 

She sat eagerly at her desk awaiting the mail carts arrival on her floor and had trouble concentrating. She hopes Carl would be pleased with her and that he would make her cum again. She felt her self getting warm and tense thinking about his strong hands on her soft body. "Oh, god" she thought to her self, "Is this what work is going to be from now on, me unable to concentrate because I want the mail man to use me as his slut? I'll loose my job anyway". She groaned to herself and fought of the urges to touch herself.

Trying hard to concentrate on work, she repeatedly glanced at the watch on the wall. Minute by minute her new magic hour got nearer and nearer. She felt herself getting wet between her legs as the clock showed ten minutes before the mail cart would appear and Carl would walk past her cubical. She would endeavour to meet him in the corridor and let him see for himself that she obeyed him. She felt her face burn with shame. She truly was a slut now or had she always been that? She couldn't tell. 

She jerked her head up as she heard the elevator chime. He was early. Her heart sang. She stood up, straightened her skirt and then stepped out into the corridor. Walking towards the elevator she saw the mail cart appear out of the confines of the small box like transportation. She tried her best to walk slowly and gracefully. Suddenly she froze in mid step as a young woman pushed the mail cart out of the elevator. Madelyn stared at the overweight freckled little redhead as she started to hand out mail to people in cubicles along the corridor. Her head spun and she found it hard to keep her balance. Where was Carl? She walked in trance over to the water cooler and while drinking some she overheard the young woman talking with one of the senior assistants near by.

- Back on cart patrol then, Stacy?

- Yeah, pretty boy has moved on. Can't say I miss him down in the mail room, but it did get me off this part of the job.

- I hear ya. 

The small read head moved on down the corridor. Madelyn tried to think, to get a handle on what she just heard. Moved on? What did that mean? She saw the mail cart stop at her cubical to collect her outgoing mail and dump a new stack of work to be sorted out. Madelyn walked back with heavy steps, her whole world crashing down around her. Carl had left and what had been almost like a fantasy had ended without him saying goodbye. She felt like crying. Abandoned again, just like when her marriage went down the drains.

She sat down at her desk and a flickering hope came to her. Had Carl sent her a last note? She quickly looked through the mail and even that hope died. Nothing but work in the pile today. She sat there for a couple of minutes just staring at her desk. What had started as something dreadful had turned out to be a blessing in disguise and now it was gone. She felt numb and all thought of her desires turned to ash. She started working and tried not to think about Carl's absence. The rest of the day went on in pretty much 

Two day's later she was called over to her supervisor's room, further down the corridor. She knocked at the door and was told to enter. She opened the door and stepped into Mrs Chavez office. Mrs Chavez was reading something on her computer screen and just glanced at Madelyn, indicating to her to sit and wait. After a minute or so she turned her attention to Madelyn. 

- So Ms Patterson, the reason I wanted to talk to you is that the personnel department want to see you. I have no idea why but I wanted to give you a heads up anyways. As far as I know there are no complaints about your work and I am more than satisfied with your work here the last seven months. You are to go to the seventh floor and see Mr Crumbley at two o'clock this afternoon. He's a old hard ass and usually handles the hatchet jobs so good luck. Mrs Chavez gave her a sympathetic smile and then indicated that it was all. 

Madelyn returned to her desk not knowing what to think. She had heard gossip about Crumbley, how he always handled the nasty part of the work such as layoffs and dismissal of unwanted staff. She was going to get sacked. She didn't need to question why since it was obvious. Carl had sent in the pictures after he left his job. She wanted to cry but steeled herself. She would go out of this with her head high at least. 

At a quarter to two she took the elevator up to seventh and went over to Crumbleys office, being a few minutes early she stood outside waiting before knocking on the door at precisely two o'clock. A man's voice told her to enter and she opened the door and stepped in. An older man with grey thinning hair and a face to scare of children with looked up at her as she entered. He looked over at his computer screen and smiled as he turned back to her.

- Ah, yes - Ms Patterson. Well, this won't take long.

She felt her stomach turn to ice and she barely managed to remain standing. The man tapped the keyboard, grunted something and then looked back at her.

- So, Ms Patterson, Something rather unusual has happened and your name came up.

- Oh?

She tried to keep her voice steady. He had clearly seen the pictures.

- Yes, when this sort of thing usually happens then normal channels provide the solution, but not for you it seems. He cooked an eyebrow and looked at her.

- Um.

- Anyways, have your desk cleared out by end of the day and...

Madelyn tried not to show any emotions, but her face betrayed her efforts. She felt tears stinging her eyes and her vision got blurry. She was fired. Crumbley looked at her and he wrinkled his fore head in concern.

- Are you alright, Ms Patterson?

- I... 

He looked at her and then a smile spread across his face. "He really enjoys this" she thought miserably. Crumbley cleared this throat.

- Do you know why you are here, Ms Patterson? Didn't Mrs Chavez tell you?

- Tell me what. That I'm fired? Her voice was hollow and low.

- Fired? What gave you that idea? You are being reassigned.

- Reassigned?

- Yes, to a new job. The old personal assistant of the head of the Logistics Department has been moved over to Sales and you are to replace her. Surely you knew that? 

- No, no one said...

- Oh, I see. Well I suppose then that you would think... sorry about that, a clear breakdown in communications then. Anyway, you are to go over there right after we finish here to meet with the head of the department, a Mr Etlanth, to get instructions. Then you will clear out your desk down at sales so we can get a new assistant in there ASAP. 

Madelyn's head spun. Had she just been promoted?

- Um, thank you sir.

- Don't thank me. It is quite unusual this, normally the position gets filled with the most senior assistant in that department, but there was a specific request for you? Any idea why?

- Um, no sir. 

- Hmmm, anyway. Sign here and here for your transfer and here is your new contract with the company. You may note the increase in wages, quite the bump after being with us only seven months, eh?

He smiled at her as she stepped up to the desk to sign of on the papers. She almost gasped as she saw the salary, almost four times as much as she made now. She took her copies and then left Crumbley's office. A promotion? She wanted to dance, scream, laugh or at least hug someone. She took the elevator up two levels to the Logistics Department. She had never been there before and looked around. It looked pretty much as Sales with the same configuration of cubicles, offices and other areas. She walked over to a cubical and knocked lightly at it. A young man raised his head and looked at her.

- Yes, can I help you?

- Yes, I'm here to se a Mr Etlanth? Can you tell me where I can find him?

- Ah, the boss man. Yeah, he's office is down on the corner. The man pointed in the rough direction of one of the large corner offices on the floor.

- Thank you.

- No sweat.

Madelyn walked over to the office and was about to knock when the door opened and a woman came out. 

- You Madelyn Patterson? 

Madelyn nodded.

- Go right in, he's expecting you.

The woman left and Madelyn walked in to the large office, closing the door behind her. The large leather chair was turned away from the door and the occupant was reading some papers. Madelyn stood there waiting. Suddenly she heard a familiar voice.

- Are you in violation of any rules at the moment, Madelyn?

Her heart missed a beat. 

- No, sir.

Her answer was almost automatic. Carl swivelled the chair around and smiled at her.

- Good. I'd hate to start of with having to punish you.

She blushed. 

- Now. You are here because I'm offering you a job. The job is my personal assistant. You can decline and there will be no blotch on your record. If you want I can even get you a transfer to another part of the company. And to prove that you are free to choose as you wish.

He threw a large envelope on to the desk in front of her and she looked at it.

- That is all the material, all photos - both printed and the memory card from the camera. It also holds a letter written by me stating that you where indeed blackmailed to take those and that there are no charges against you. 

He looked at her as the words sank in. 

- But if you choose to remain and take the job you will be my assistant and my slut. You will be introduced to more than before and I will use you. You can at any time quit your job and you will get good references from me. But all in all, I do think you will stay. Do you need time to think it over?

Madelyn stared at him for a couple of seconds and then lowered her head and shook it. 

- And your answer?

Her mind was dragging her in all directions at once. If she walked she would be free from him. She liked that idea, but another part of her whispered the same thing and that made her despair. She closed of her thought and swallowed. Slowly she raised her hands and started to unbutton her blouse.

- Excellent! Leave the top and bottom buttons on the blouse and just pull it open.

Madelyn followed his instructions and the blouse soon strained open in front with her breast hanging out.

- Very nice. Hands behind your back and grip your elbows.

She put her arm behind her and then awkwardly gripped her left elbow with her right hand and vice versa. This left her lower arms horizontal behind her and her chest sticking out. She felt her nipples harden and she tried not to tremble. 

- No come over here and kneel, Madelyn. 

She walked with hesitant steps around the desk and then, without letting go of her elbows, awkwardly lower her self down onto her knees, facing him as he sat in the chair. Carl smiled at her and unzipped his pants. Reaching in he dragged his cock free from the confines of his shorts and it stood up, ready to serve. He motioned her closer and she reluctantly inched closer to him as he spread his legs, leaving her space to come up close to his glistening hard-on. 

- I do think it's only proper for my slut to thank me for her new job and quite substantional increase in pay. Do you agree?

She swallowed hard looking at his cock in front of her. She nodded.

- Good, you may begin.

No other order was needed, Madelyn knew what she was expected to do so she leaned forward and opened her mouth, and started to suck him. Her head bobbed up and down and she couldn't help to compare the cock in her mouth with the other cocks she had sucked through the years. There had been a few boyfriends in collage and then of course her husband. She felt the taste of him and loved it, she closed her eyes and there was a low slurping sound as she tried her best to please her boss. She felt him stroke her head like she was a favourite pet.

- Very good, I'm pleased that you know how to suck a man, Madelyn.

She continued to suck him and soon felt him stiffen, his cock jerking and then the hot fluid filling her mouth. She swallowed as best she could and slurped. 

- Very good. Make sure to clean me off properly and then you can get up and walk back in front of the desk. And keep your ands on your elbows the whole time. 

Madelyn tried her best to clean him of and then with shaky legs managed to get up on her two feet again, never letting go of the elbows. She walked back and stood before the desk looking at him. Carl tugged his cock back inside the pants and zipped up. 

- Well, I think you deserve some explanations for that. Short of the thing is, my grandfather founded the company and my father runs it. They had this notion that before they gave me a management position I had to work somewhere on the lower tiers for a year so I chose the mail room. But my year there is over and this is where I will be now.

- Congratulation, sir.

- Thank you, Madelyn. Now, your office is next door. You will need to fetch your stuff from downstairs and move in as soon as possible. He paused. I will require you to dress for your new role as my assistant and slut. 

He laid another smaller envelop on top of the first one. 

- Here is a credit card and a list. You will take the rest of the day of and go shopping for work clothes; you'll find all you need to know in the envelope. Now, button up and get going. I'll expect you in here 9 o'clock sharp tomorrow morning. Dismissed.

She pulled her blouse closed over her breast and almost moaned as the soft silky fabric dragged over her erect nipples, sending waves of pleasure though her body. She picked up the envelopes and turned to leave.

- Oh, and one more thing, Madelyn. 

She stopped and turned.

- Yes, sir?

- You will not masturbate outside of the office again. From now one you are only allowed to cum in my presence. Is that understood?

Her voice trembled and she fought to keep it steady.

- Yes, sir. 

- Good, off you go then.

Madelyn left his office and returned to her cubicle on level three for the last time. As she begun to empty her desks meagre contents into a cardboard box people started to notice her actions. The elderly woman sitting in the next cubical over came around with a worried face.

- They didn't fire you, did they?

Madelyn looked up, seeing who asked and smiled at her. 

- No, they transferred me over to Logistics.

- Oh, that's nice.&nbsp; 

Madelyn tried not to blush.

- Yes, I think I will like it over there.

She collected the last of her things, said goodbye to those she had worked with and went over to Mrs Chavez office to hand over left over paperwork and keys.

- Transferred huh? Not bad since almost everyone thought you were going to be fired.&nbsp; 

- Why?

- Meeting out of the blue with "hatchet" Crumbley. Not many people come back to tell their tales of that meeting. Chavez winked at her. Any idea why they transferred you over there?

Madelyn battled with her instincts, she wanted to confess everything and to let the woman know what she would be from now on, but she decided against it in the end. She shrugged.

- The department head asked for me. 

- Carl Etlanth did? I heard he got that department after his stint in the mail room.

- You knew who he was?

- Everyone knew.

Madelyn looked away from the woman.

- Not everyone.

- You didn't? Chaves paused, thinking. No, that's right; you started here well after he begun down there. The gossip must have died out by then. So he asked for you personally?

- Yes. 

- You must have made quiet an impression on him then. Chavez grinned at her.

- I... she managed to control her voice, I suppose so.

- Good for you. Well, don't be a stranger now and good luck.

Madelyn left Sales and ascended to Logistics and a somewhat brighter if not pleasurable future.



The End?



We will just have to see if the further adventures of Madelyn is anything to write about. I make no promises on the fact. There are a few loose ideas that could fit the bill, but they could just as easily end up as another story or part of something else. 

H�sten l�gger sig �ver landet och skrivandet f�r sig alltid en uppsving denna tid av �ret. Ha det!
