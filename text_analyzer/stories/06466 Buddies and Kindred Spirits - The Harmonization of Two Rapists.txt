 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Harmonization of Two Rapists

Page 1.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was a long way from home.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I needed to rest from my pursuit of madness and was taking a vacation break in Ithaca, a resort town in the Finger Lakes region of west New York state. It was a hot, humid summer and I wanted to recharge my batteries from all the raping and pillaging I'd initiated over the last several months. Five victims in all, including a mother and her teenaged daughter. My graveyard was a heck of a lot fuller but in no danger of filling up yet. I had over fifty remote acres at my hideaway where they met their ends. It took a lot of energy and concentration to mutilate and murder diligently and intelligently and I wanted a respite where I didn't have to keep performing or have the nagging worry about the cops catching on and catching up with me.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And so it was, in the most likely places, very often what could be reasonably expected never materialized and every so often, in the most unlikely locale, the unimaginably perfect popped right up.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was relaxing over a leisurely, late morning breakfast at a really nice eatery. Not expensive but lots of imagination and sort of a western atmosphere and the nicest husband and wife team, the owners and the proprietors. They were always there and loved what they were doing which was a blessing and was something I understood well. I loved my life and all the adventure my crimes afforded me.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My eggs were scrambled to perfection and the toast golden honey tanned and my orange juice iced cold. I was quietly minding
my own business reading a local morning paper and sort of off in a corner by myself but next to the aisle that led to the rest rooms. All of a sudden the peace was ruptured by the three amigos.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Three bimbos, about thirty-five, who were all professionals and thought the world, or at least this restaurant, was their oyster, came lambasting into the quiet space. They were cutting up and horsing around and if I'd had to have guessed, I think they were high on something. They certainly were high on themselves and didn't care who it put off. They were spirited, I supposed someone who appreciated that kind of raucous behavior would say, but to me they were just rude, inconsiderate bitches disturbing my peaceful enjoyment.

Page 2.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At first they seemed an odd bunch, like an odd match, but then as it became apparent they were all cut from the same arrogant, entitled bitch-cloth, so their dynamics made more sense.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The most striking one was raven haired and really fucking tall. Six foot two, as it turned out. She was high waisted and full breasted and quite pretty with her jet-black long hair framing her face to her shoulders. She stood out and above the others and turned out to be the oldest at twenty eight.&nbsp; She also seemed to be, like their leader or mentor. Some manner of authority figure.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The brunette was an enigma, She had a saucy challenging face and always wore her fucking eye glasses. She was so near sighted she couldn't find her clit without them. She was a good eight inches shorter than the giraffe and had the most boobs. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was special bright. She was studious and a corporate lawyer and at twenty-five was already being considered for partner, but not at TV's Boston Legal.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Saffron Burrows would have to do instead if I was going to pursue that bunch. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Visit:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://www.celebritypictures.com/celebs/Saffron_Burrows/all/711597.jpg

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The dirty blonde was the youngest, but just by a few months and she was a beautician. Actually that's how she'd met the other two. They were clients of hers at her own little, but thriving salon, She was the mouthiest of them and wouldn't take no guff from anybody, but quite liked dishing some of her own out. She had the smallest two of the six tits but was still plenty, good and plenty enough to give lots of satisfaction.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They all shaved their cunts but not bald. They'd taken turns at various martial arts disciplines and even all together for some Karate training. They loved when they could spar with some male opponents and especially one guy who didn't like women. They could all tell, so they tormented him more and picked him and picked on him on purpose. Blondy loved to give him, one last parting shot as his back was turned and the instructor wasn't looking, and she'd act all innocent like the wuss couldn't take it. He was Jerold, an odd spelling for Gerald, and I think he would have liked to have joined us on the fun we ended up having in store for them.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So that was them, the three mouthy amigos.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They plunked their tight asses, they all had short shorts and tank tops on, into a booth and had a little tug of war, or was that a tug of whores, over the single menu that was there, until a waitress got to them with two more. She could see they were almost going to tear it in three and they were tossing it too, so the waitress thought she should speed up the normally relaxed service. It was summer time and the livin' was easy and they all had coffees. No one was in a hurry.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I pretended not to notice and kept my nose buried in the paper but my eyes glancing over the top of it, discretely I thought. They were all real lookers and knew it and the whole world, especially men, owed them a living&nbsp; and at the very least homage and deference to boot.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They slapped the table and each other and went on about different guys I assumed they'd fucked. And I heard Bill mentioned, like in Bill the pill and they started a silly little rhyming game. Like Jake the rake. Oh yeah, he was a stud and Bud the dud. He couldn't get it up and when he did, it wouldn't go the distance anyway. What a useless prick he was. There was Chad the cad who'd tried to bed all three of them at different times and when they found out, they set up a trap for him where he ended up with the tree of them at once, in one bed, as they virtually attacked and humiliated him. They left him tied to the mattress for the motel morning cleaning lady to find. I'd have to say, the stories of their exploits were somewhat entertaining.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After about ten minutes and their breakfast would be another five (They rudely kept asking the owners how much longer?) they all had to go to the ladies room. I don't know why they were going there. They weren't ladies at all, but mouthy, self-absorbed sluts. Just my opinion, I'd add, but then when I had victims, my opinion was all that mattered. It carried the weight of the world, so to say, and of rational thought, but not necessarily actions to match.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I'd heard them say they all had to go and went into my paper to hide and as they sashayed by, the youngest of them smacked my paper. As it turned out her name was Sally, the dirty blonde.

Page 4.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They didn't like being ignored and the youngest one, who I supposed was the best looking in a brassy, arrogant way, would abide it the least. They wanted everyone to be looking at them, like they were Hollywood celebrities and especially the men and ostensibly I wasn't paying attention or paying them their dues.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was startled and sort of jerked aback, like a bit of a wuss, and they all laughed, especially the paper slapper.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So what's with you cowboy?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I don't know where she got that vision from other than I had thin denim on and it was a wild west themed spot.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'What's in that little old paper that's so interesting?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I wasn't sure what to say so said. 'Nothing.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'My haven't we got a live one here.' The mouthpiece extolled. 'Nothing interesting and you're still reading it. What you do in your spare time, watch grass grow? Why don't you read the comics? They should be at your level.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I wasn't really up for a fight with them and wasn't into taking their bait, so the same cunt cuffed my paper again and then disappeared into the washroom, to their choruses of 'loser, loser, fucking loser'.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was a little embarrassed and self-conscious as I felt everyone was looking at me, but only a few were. Some shook their heads and others, I think, mocked me a bit, but I really didn't give a crawling shit. I wasn't up for murdering cunt on my vacation, not even those three who fully deserved it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They came spilling back from pissing and whatever else they did in there and breezed by my table like I was invisible. No fun to be had with me. What a dud and dead beat I must be, no balls, no dick.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was another guy sitting by himself and they decided to focus their exuberance and harassment onto him. He looked to be about twenty years my junior and for some reason, I liked the guy right off. I had when he'd come in, polite and unassuming and looking somewhat studious, but not geeky to me. And he totally minded his own business. I believe he'd describe himself as quite generic (the perfect disguise).

Page 5.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The three of them figured him for weak and went in for the humiliation kill.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So what's your story?' 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The oldest of the three pretty well demanded a reply from him. Like she challenged him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'My story?' He quizzed them back.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Yeah, you know. You like girls? You like girls like us?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They so assumed they were so beautiful, sexy and desirable that any man being truthful would have to answer in the affirmative.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You seem OK. You girls are having a great time, aren't you? Really enjoying yourselves?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So what? What if we are? What's it to you?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He'd been verbally sucker punched. They'd led him into talking and then gut punched him for presuming to do so.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'No. No, nothing. I didn't mean anything by it. It's just you're all so happy and excited.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'And good looking too. You think we're good looking?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Well yes, I guess. Anyone can see that you're very pretty.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Just pretty. Like f. How about drop dead gorgeous and beautiful?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Yes. OK. Yes that too, I suppose.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You suppose. You suppose. Is that all? How'd you like to go out with us, with one of us? You'd like that wouldn't you?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I don't know you but you'd seem like fun so I think it'd be fine. I don't know, I never met you before. We just met now.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'No we haven't. No we aren't. We're not meeting now. My, oh my, what a sharp tack we have here and guess what loser, eat your heart out because you'll never get to go out with any one of us, not ever or even my little sister. Looser, dreamer. Creep.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And one of them whispered 'asshole'.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They crashed back into their food stall and breakfast came and they made a merry party of that.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The alone chap looked really hurt, almost injured, but there was another look I caught. Something in his eyes, steely and hidden but hardened. And I could swear he had his cell phone pointed in just such a way he was getting some pictures of them.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The three bitches were going on about how elegant the place on the lake was they'd rented and they had another week to go. The whole fucking restaurant knew that, they volumed it so loudly.

Page 6.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I watched the guy alone and something in me wanted to avenge his (public) humiliation. The three of them waltzed to the rest room again, like a band, and the middle one, Julie the brunette lawyer, grabbed my paper right up off the table. I'd pretty well finished it so she could have it if it meant that much to her to try to seize the upper hand with me. Fuck her, I had another mission in mind.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I got up quickly and went to join the other guy.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Hi. How ya doin?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I'm OK, I guess.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Yeah, I saw. I guess everyone did.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I.. One of them just scooped your paper. That was sort of rude too, wasn't it?' He spoke softly and like he felt for me too.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Yeah, sure. I suppose. But I was pretty well done with it, so what you gonna do? You know, three to one?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Tell me about it. I know just how you feel.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I paused to size him up and he seemed big enough.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So, if that's true, you want to get back at them?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'What? How?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You wanna get them back?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I dunno. I mean how? What?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I leaned forward to him across the table.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You tell me. Now you tell me, what's the best way you know. That you can think of?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I had to tread very lightly and cautiously then. I needed him to lead the idea. He might be thinking to let the air out of their tires and I was thinking to let the air out of them.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He seemed to reason into his darker secrets.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Oh yeah, I know one way but I can't say. Not to a stranger at least. So I can't say.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So my name's Jim, and yours is?' I said as I extended my hand.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Brad. It's Brad. Actually Bradley the Third but that sounds a bit stuffy and over the top doesn't it?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I laughed, 'Yeah a bit aristocratic, so Brad'll do?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Yup that me. Just Brad.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We shook hands and his grip was firm.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So now we're not strangers anymore, so what about getting even? How you couldn't say?'

Page 7.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We both knew what didn't have to be said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I picked it up again and pressed him. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You wanna get even? Or don't you?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'How? When? Where?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Let's pay and get out of here. My van's outside and if we want to do some payback, we gotta follow them to where they're renting a cottage.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It seemed like for a moment he was going to pass on my offer (of revenge) and then all of a sudden he decided to toss the dice and see how it played out. Throw caution to the wind and let events sweep him along. But he was still a very unknown quality to me as was I to him. We paid and tipped generously, and were out to my van before the cunts could see we'd left. Their playthings were a.w.o.l.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We settled into the front which was closed off from the back, from the cargo area and I really liked Brad even more instantly and afterwards. He reminded me of me, a decade ago and something unspoken was passing between us. Kindred spirits, I supposed and they do have a way of finding each other.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad spoke first about what we were (supposedly) up to.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You're serious? You want to get revenge on them?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'She owes me a paper, doesn't she? She should pay for that. So yeah, I'd say I am. Put them in their places. Don't you?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Fucking right. For certain. More than you can ever know. And look, I even got some pictures of them on my phone.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now that sounded promising and honest.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So we're on the same page here then?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Yeah. Yeah, I think so.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'We need to know so, so there's no misunderstanding.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Yeah, OK. I wanna hurt them. They made fun of me and they should pay, feel what it's like to be humiliated. I didn't do anything to invite it or deserve it, so they deserve it.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I couldn't agree with you more. I totally fucking agree, so we're good to go then?'

Page 8.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I could see his demeanor change slightly and it appeared as if he was getting excited, sexually aroused at the ideas and he took the final step of initiation.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So this is it. This is the punishment?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He said it as he took a good hold of his crotch, coddled the package, so to say.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Fucking right man. Fucking right on. You got it right on.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I grabbed my swelling crotch too and we punched out fists together in the air. Like an instant alliance and life long friendship had just been consummated.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Shit man. Shit. I never expected this when I went in for breakfast. Talk about destiny. Oh fuck, what next?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Open up the glove box.' I said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He did and my twenty-two pistol was to the back under some papers.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Oh shit. Shit, you always carry that? What if you get stopped? Shit, so this is for real. You're for real?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You never know when you'll need it for something like this.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That was the most loaded leading thing I'd said to him up until that moment.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You get my meaning?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was mulling in his head and rocked back and forth a little and then started to nod his head, like with purpose. He was both arranging and setting his own fate.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Yeah man. Yeah, I think I do. You've done this before? Is that it? More than once before?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So I know you're not a cop. I know that, but I'm taking a big risk here. You know?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He just nodded his approval and his understanding.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Tell me outright you're not a cop.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You said you know and I'll tell you anyway. I'm not a fucking cop. The fucking cops will be looking for us when we're done so OK, your secret's safe with me. You've done it before?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I nodded that I had.

Page 9.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Oh man, what was it like? What did she look like? How was she? Did she beg and cry?' And then he really gulped deeply, 'Did you hurt her?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And that was significant.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was time to open up to get the ground rules on track.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The track rules on the ground.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Brad, this is serious. You need to understand something before we go any further with this.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'OK, yes I'm listening.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I could tell he was excited, getting right to pumped up and his imaginations and fantasies were all bubbling to the surface and localizing in his pecker.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Yes. I hurt them. I fucking hurt them good, like mean. I'm not a smash and grabber. I'm meticulous and a holder. I like to draw it out and make it last and last.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Last? How long?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I sort of avoided the answer.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Come on. A few hours? A day?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Days. Days and weeks.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Man. Man get out. Shut up. You're going to make me cream my pants.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Good, then good. That's a good sign, a good reaction. You never&nbsp; can be sure of another guy's ideas about how to do it. What's a turn on for the other guy.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So you hurt them? Can you tell me, tell me how? What you did or some of what you did?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'What would be your idea of hurting them? Of hurting one of them, the three cunts?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Can I tell you? You won't think I'm a sick puppy? I've never told anyone before.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'That's why I'm asking. I want you to share so I can see how much of the same page we're on.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I have a thing for nipples. Oh man, do I. I love the idea of getting them hard and, and I love getting them hard.'

Page 10.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was reluctant to reveal what he felt was deep perversion as in a deeply demented perversion.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Getting them hard and torturing them?' I said it for him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Oh man, yeah. Fucking yes. Yes, yes, yes.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Like stick needles and nails through them. Pierce them and puncture them and maybe even crush them with pliers?' I said it for him again.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Fuck. Right on man. Oh shit. Are we gonna do that to those three bitches? Six fucking nipples to torture?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'If you want. If that's what cranks you.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Oh man. Oh man. Oh shit, shit. Here they come.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They were prancing and circling each other and kicking their legs in the air like they were chorus girls on the Vegas strip. They all had short shorts on and tank tops and lots of tit meat was bouncing around.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We looked at each other, shook hands across the seat and got into dead serious stalking mode.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They piled into a brand new Mustang convertible, of course red, and didn't pay any attention to my grey van to the back of the parking lot. They headed out onto the main road and I headed out along after them. The driver was the one who'd smacked my newspaper and she drove the same way. Fast and aggressive and a couple of times she made the car weave back and forth on the road for no apparent reason. Just for the thrill of creating like an amusement park ride. These bitches were dangerous. A menace on the road and a menace in the bedrooms and they needed to be hauled up short.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After about fifteen minutes they turned onto a gravel road with a dead end sign at the entrance. I drove right on by.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'What? Why? Why aren't you following them any more?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'What for? We don't have to. They have to be down there somewhere.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Yeah but what if we can't find them. Maybe they put their car in a garage or it's just hidden.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Trust me. We'll get them. We have a fucking week.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Oh? Oh we're not doing it now then?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Not this minute, if that's what you mean. Oh, I see, is that what you thought? We'd be raping them in the next hour?'

Page 11.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'No. Yes. What? I don't know what I thought.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So we gotta talk then. We have to talk some more.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You haven't changed your mind have you?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He seemed genuinely worried and upset that his dream might be slipping away, evaporating before it solidified.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Now you are kidding? Tell me you're kidding.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Yes, sort of. But what then?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Like I said, we got to talk and not about fairy tales and fantasies but about some real deep-shit stuff.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I had his full attention and interest back.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I want to show you something but we have to pull over somewhere private. Watch for a side road.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Five minutes later we pulled up into a secluded opening off another gravel road and got out of the van. I went around to the back and asked him, 'You ready for this?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Fuck man, what you got in there?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I opened the solid windowless double back doors.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What he saw was a completely padded (I'd used surplus high school gym mats.) mobile cell with restraints and all, and closed off completely from the front driver's compartment, but with a sliding access door. Everything was built like a tank.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'God damn. Shit damn. Look at this and this. Oh shit. Man, this is some serious shit. Like serious kidnapping shit.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I nodded my head in agreement. He was fast to understand the purpose.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You mean you kidnap and hold them? You transport them and take them somewhere else?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I nodded.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Federal. Fucking federal, like the electric chair or the needle. You're sure it's safe, like we won't get caught?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'We won't get caught. I'm extremely careful and I haven't yet.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I gotta ask. How many? How many others? How many before?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I didn't really want to let that pussy out of the bag yet, but he picked up on my inference.

Page 12.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Shit. Shit, I see. That many. Oh shit, like the rape jack pot.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I loved his terminologies.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Let's just say more than ten and fewer than a hundred.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Fuck man, more than ten? You've had more than twenty nipples to torture? How the fuck do you keep sane?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now he was impressed and almost overjoyed. He could see the unlimited possibilities and the long road ahead of us, leading right through the center of cunt county, if we just kept carefulness always out at the forefront.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So what's next?' He asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'What's your time table like? I'm on holiday, but I'm self- employed anyway so my time's my own when I want or need it to be. What about you?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I'm unemployed right now but I have money from a trust fund. Not Bradley the Third for nothing. I rent a small apartment but I have no family close by so I'm easy. I'm free to move about for as long as you want. If that's what you mean?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'That's good. That's just fine then.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I gave a bit of a pause and decided he was the right guy, the right accomplice and decided to go for it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I'll tell you what, don't bother looking for a job. I've got lots of money and you can stay with me and we can hunt cunt full time and together. That'll be your job. The big game dame hunter. What better&nbsp; job in the whole wide world is there than that?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I'm tired. I'm hungry. God I've worked up an appetite again. What do we do next?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'First thing is to go and find their car and scout where they're staying.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now I was talking. Getting into the real doing.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Oh, yeah. I almost forgot. I love it. I fucking love it.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And I could tell he did and, of course, so did I, but it wasn't nearly so novel to me as for him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We back tracked to the dead end road they'd taken, and in twenty minutes, we heard them before we saw them. They had loud music on and were dancing in their bathing suits, to the side of the cottage. All except one, and she was topless. The water was too wet for them right then and all they wanted were their beers and to shake their booties and make their jugs flop around. The red Mustang was right in front of the opened attached garage door.

Page 13.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Good. Excellent. Perfect. We'll come back tonight when it's dark.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Jim, I gotta jerk off. Do you mind if I go in the back and hammer myself? Did you see her bare jugs bouncing around?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Let's get out of here first and then you can go to it all you want.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Geeze, I've never been so comfortable with another man, in my life. In my entire life. Not even with my brother. But then I could never tell him what I want to do to women, to beautiful ones. They have to be beautiful. Or even what I'd like to do to his wife. She's a fucking hot knock-out and she doesn't like me. I think she smells something funny about me like why I stare at her nipples. She likes to go braless and I'd like to cut them off, bite the hard little fuckers right off, and show them to her.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have to say, it was as if I myself was speaking, we were so on the same wave length.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He continued, 'But I have to say one more thing, my&nbsp; new intriguing friend, I'm not gay. Not at all.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I laughed a good hearty guffaw.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Well that's good. That's just great. You don't appreciate my well honed body? Or my fucking puny pecker?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We laughed like buddies.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So good. That's good. I'm not either, not even a little so we're going to be boyfriends without the normal benefits.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He laughed too and gave me a playful cuff across the head.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So good then, That little detail's out of the way, and oh, by the way, you really want to do your sister-in-law?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He looked totally fucking shocked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He'd wanted to rape and bash her for five years at least, maybe even ten.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'But? But, get out man. But if I did. If we did, she'd know who I was.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So. So? She'd tell the cops. She'd rant and rave and send us to jail forever.'

Page 14.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now it was entirely crucial. The last big cat, like a super lion, had to be let out of the bag.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'No. No, not if.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'No, you don't know her. She's the mouthiest bitch I've ever known or seen. She'd never keep it a secret.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Unless?' I posited the totally loaded leading question.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Unless?' He quizzed me confused.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Unless she couldn't talk.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He started to nod his head back and forward, like rocking himself, almost mechanical.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He didn't say a word out loud for about a minute, but was debating furiously with himself inside.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At last he spoke.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Are you suggesting what I think you are?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Do you think I am?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I think you are. I fucking think you are.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He paused for long again and I wasn't sure which way he was going to go. Maybe I'd misjudged the depth of his dedication to realizing his fantasies. Or maybe he just wasn't a natural born killer and it might be a taste he could never acquire. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Everything hung in the balance.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If he wouldn't kill them we couldn't rape them. That was my hard and fast rule. I'd never once left a participant nor a witness alive.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Yeah. Yes, shit does she have it coming. She shouldn't be alive and I'd like to wring her cunt to death.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Not much doubt about those sentiments, I mused to myself.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He continued, 'The way she thinks she's better than everyone or at least she thinks her cunt's too good for me. I know she thinks that, but she loves to tease me with her braless tits. And you would? You would kill her?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Wouldn't you?' I asked him back.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Yeah, if I thought I could get away with it. I would, but I don't want to go to prison for life or get the needle.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Do you see any needles in me?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad's brain was reeling and he couldn't believe his extraordinary fortune.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You're. You're something else. Fuck, shit. You're a character right out of my wet dreams and fantasies. You've wasted cunt?'

Page 15.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Every one I've had.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He did the arithmetic.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Oh fuck. Shit. Shit man, that means over ten. That's what you said before. Where do you put them?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You'll see. But I can assure you they'll never be found. So we've turned the page and we're still on the same one then. For those three too?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'All of them? We're gonna kill all of them?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I nodded with a grin and a twinkle in my eye.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad grabbed his balls and asked, 'Fuck, how? How?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Slowly. Really slowly and really painfully and you know what? They'll beg for it, beg to die. And you know what again? Death, when it comes, will be a blessing.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I can hardly believe it. I just can't.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Look, lets go back to where I'm staying. We have to stay out of public as much as we can. We'll make us something to eat there and then try to get a bit of sleep. We're going to have a long, challenging night tonight. That's for sure.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For the next twenty miles we drove pretty well in silence, each playing over what we'd said and what we intended to do. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Pensive. We were both deeply pensive.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And there was no sense of guilt to be found.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I did break the silence, just to be sure he wasn't having second or third thoughts.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So tell me. Tell me about your sister-in-law's nipples. You said she goes braless to tease you.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And then he cemented our bond, our friendship forever.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad pulled out his folder, and he had a small, wallet sized photo of her topless. He'd managed to scoop it with his cell phone camera and carried it everywhere with him and jacked off to it often. He said he had a much bigger print at home he'd made using a computer programme called Posters. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Visit:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; www.postersw.com

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He'd made an almost life-sized cut-out of her and loved to throw target darts at it or shoot his pellet gun at it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So the die was cast and isn't it funny how things repercuss. Our chance meeting had just signed her death warrant, but we had three others to execute first.

Page 16.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When we got there late, about eleven pm, we were disappointed as all get out. There was a party going on with a bunch of other girls and guys and I figured our trio were passing their cunts around. But it wasn't quite the lost cause that it seemed. When they came up missing, the party goers would be the prime suspects, so that part was good. It just meant we had to put off what we were pumped up for. I figured some of the guys would get so drunk they'd have to stay the night, so to-morrow was our new snatch snatchs date.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The morning came in about six hours and we'd had four hours sleep. The day was wet and windy and that was just perfect as far as I was concerned. I'd often used inclement weather as a foil, as a partial cover since people trying to avoid the nastiness of it, usually weren't paying that much attention to what was going on around them.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad was sleepy-eyed and not being gay at all, I'd still have to say he was adorable. He was a really pleasant soul, upbeat and willing (to learn) and disheveled first morning thing.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We got past the pleasantries, to what out mission was.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I suppose it's good we couldn't get them last night. It gives us a bit better time to round out our strategies.' I said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Yeah, I guess. What have you in mind?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'The first thing we have to watch is the tallest one. The one who had the yellow shorts on, with her nipples out her matching top.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Yeak, fuck man. Wasn't she something else. I mean her fucking nipples were like rockets. They'd pushed out so far, like into orbit.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You think you can hurt them?' I foolishly asked him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Her? Her nipples? Oh fuck yeah. She'll wish she never had them.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad talked just like I thought, so he was perfect.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So we gotta watch out for her. I think she's pretty tough and like a leader. The leader of the pack, you could say, so we have to neutralize her right off. Try to get to her first.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Neutralize? You're going to, you know? And he made his hand into a gun he was firing.

Page 17.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'No. No fucking way. We need to overpower her and beat on her a bit. That way the others won't think they're so invincible if they see her busted up and taken down.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I love the way you talk. I love the way you think, and how 
you describe things. Beat on her. Fucking, fucking right. Take her down. Take her cunt down.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He paused pensive and a little uncertain.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Can I ask you something?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Sure. Anything. We're partners, so nothing's off limits. Like a good marriage should be.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Beat on her. Do you mind if I slug her in the cunt?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Mind? Why would I mind? I'd do that myself, but now you've spoken first for it, so you get to do it, but I get to watch. Let me make this clear. You can do whatever you want to her and to them. To any of them. Nothing's off limits and your most perverted imaginings are at your beck and call and at your pecker's call too. It's not up to me to tell you how mean or vicious you can be. It's up to you to find out what you're capable of and to dream up new, and Brad get this, I mean it in the fullest sense of the word, to dream up new tortures. Extended and horrible tortures.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Fuck Jim. Shit Jim, I'm going to cum in my pants. Fuck, where have you been all my life?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Fate buddy. It's all fate, so let's go partake of some, and oh yeah, if you cunt slug her, I get to rupture her tits.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We high-five fisted each other and were off on our way to score them. All the other cars were gone but one and that was a damper again, like a roadblock. How lucky could they keep on being?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Across the road from the driveway, not the water side, was a vacant lot for sale. Well not quite vacant. There was a falling down old log cabin with pretty well no roof. We pulled the van in beside it and used the spy glasses to spy on them. In half an hour, we were amply rewarded. A guy and two girls exited the cottage and were away in the last car there, other than the Mustang. Two of our target cunts had been outside seeing them off and they were loud and still pretty much trying to carouse. I'm not sure they weren't trying to fake it, like I'll have fun even if it kills me, since we could tell they were pretty hung over and what could be more perfect than that? Their senses and reflexes were impaired and ours were sharpers than an Italian switchblade stiletto's tip point, which I had one with me.

Page 18.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We let the car be gone for a couple of minutes and then gave each other the look that said, 'the go ahead'.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'OK, Brad, I wanna get the gun into the tall one with the black hair, into her face and we gotta get her fast. I've only got one set of handcuffs so we'll have to use the nylon cord, so we tie up the others and we'll gag them until we see what we're dealing with. You good to go?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Sounds like a plan to me. Like a fucking great rape plan so let's go get ourselves some prime, primed pussy.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I decided to drive my van right to their garage. It looked like a contractor's vehicle and I could use that approach to ruse them if anybody came outside. They didn't know we weren't locals and I could say we had some maintenance work we were supposed to be doing on the property and that the owner had hired us some time ago. Once inside the house, I figured it didn't matter what we said since my handgun would do the talking, or at least the indicating.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But I had my whole outside scenario rehearsed and of course as is so often life's decide, it didn't happen that way at all. The best laid plans of rats and men and men who were rats.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The cunts were so immune to any sense of their own vulnerability or mortality that they not only had left the garage door open but the door leading into the house was unlatched too. They just thought nothing bad could possibly happen to them in such a lovely setting, not while they were holidaying and besides&nbsp; who would dare? Who would have the nerve when there were three of them, sluggers all. At least in their own eyes. They were powerful, savvy women who could go head to toe with any man, or so they thought. Or, maybe they were just plain skunk drunk hung-over and no one thought to pay attention because no one could think straight period. That would be, no one other than Brad and me and we were focused sharper than an eagle's eyes and talons.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The first thing we heard was a stereo or CD player some where off in the background. That could be a negative or a plus but we'd really have to be extra vigilant.

Page 19.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We crept like thieves in the day into a fairly long hall and could see the general layout of the cottage. The first room, to the left was a mud room,&nbsp; laundry room and as best we could tell, no one was in it, but that wasn't a certainty either. I motioned to Brad, my fingers to my mouth, like ssshhhh, and got way down to the floor and peered into the room from the door way bottom. The coast was clear and we both slid into that little hide-away to catch our breaths and suck in some more courage. We had officially illegally trespassed. I supposed it was like 'break and enter' without the break part.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So Brad looked absolutely radiant, like he couldn't believe he was being the hunter he'd always fantasized about being. He was not the least bit scared but still needed an extra shot of adrenalin to pump up his cock. I had a healthy respect for the unexpected so was a little more cautious.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We gave each other the go ahead nod and he crept along the hall to the first doorway on the other side and it was a bedroom with a bed and one of the cunts sprawled, like passed out on it.
It was the brunette and she was fucking topless but had skimpy silk panties covering her business. Brad almost spunked his load and signaled to me pretty urgently. I peered in too and my spunk load almost joined his.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was what I considered the middle one of the three and who hadn't counted for much yet. She'd been there to see the car people off and it'd taken all her energy and concentration just to walk the few steps for those moments and now she was pretty much passed out. But not completely. And incidentally, she had two of the biggest jugs of the three of them.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There were five empties of the hard stuff, we could see and too many beer bottles to count, strewn about. She was on the bed like fucking Joan of Arc tied to the stake. Her arms away up above her head, lolled onto her side and the curve of her hips shoving down into the mattress while pushing up to the ceiling as well. Her pussy was facing us, and we could see she was a bit shaved through her transparent panties. Her eyes appeared half open but seeing nothing until she caught a glimpse of us as me moved out into the open doorway.

Page 20.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of all the good luck, she thought we were two of the guys from the night before and invited us to the bed to join her. Her brain was addled and she was still horny so I supposed she wanted to be fucked again and who were we to disappoint her. She got really aroused when she drank too much and couldn't get enough of the dick and sometimes two of them at once.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Come on you guys.' She slurred her invitation. 'Don't keep a lady waiting. But oops, then I'm not a lady so don't keep me waiting either.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad and me just looked at each other. I'd put my pistol in my&nbsp; pant's pocket because right then I didn't need it. Brad had the large briefcase with all the restraints and kidnapping sundries in it. She was waving her arms about like a lazy octopus and her legs too and started to cup her own genitals like to massage them and jerk herself off, or at least get herself all wet for the cocks she thought she was going to get. She squeezed her own tits and pinched her hardened buds. It was like we'd paid for a private lap dance, or one of those hidey-hole viewing booths where the tramps played with themselves, and issued all kinds of disgusting animal grunts simulating sex, all for money. As much as it was great fun and entertaining to watch, we had to neutralize her because things could always be different than they seemed. Piece of cake, so far, so we had to be vigilant.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We both approached the edge of the bed and her eyes were trying hard to focus. She didn't remember us from the party but she remembered us from somewhere and it was cutting through the fog of her drunken stuporness.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was close enough that the moment she made the connection, the restaurant one, my fist connected with the top side of her head and then Brad sprung into action like a vulture. He had all this pent up rage and anticipation boiling within him and he really went to fucking town on her. Her head snapped way off to the side from my slug and Brad grabbed her by the hair and pulled her head way the fuck back like to touch the back of her spine. Her whole front was arched backward and I knew what he wanted me to do. He didn't even have to say. I put my hand to her stretched belly and punched her full drill into her awaiting stomach.

Page 21.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her eyes bulged open so wide and she tried to double over but Brad wouldn't let her and he got his arm locked around her throat from behind and used the crook of his elbow to choke-hold her. He hoisted her to standing up and I was around to face her. She looked nonplussed, like what the fuck? She was so drunk she still wasn't sure she was being attacked. Like maybe some really rough sex fore play. I took her gasping face between my hands and knocked her out cold with a fist to the temple. Brad let her sink to the floor and we cuffed her up and gagged her with no trouble.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad just had to see. He rolled her onto her back and shoved his thumb into her unconscious cunt, pulled it out and licked it and then gave me the thumbs up high sign. I supposed it had double meaning, like a meaning within a meaning.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Not to be outdone by his invasion of her, as I moved by her to get on with our mission, I cold cocked her tits a couple of good sucker punches and Brad just loved it and so did it. Fuck did they ever jiggle and splat because they were the biggest and I hit pretty hard, like a steel hammer.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We were so satisfied. We'd been such an efficient team and then things got hairy.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The youngest one, with the dirty blonde hair, the paper slapper, somehow she'd come in behind us and at the same time she saw her friend trussed up on the floor she saw us skulking along the hall. She wasn't as drunk as we'd hoped and she was far from out of it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She screamed out. 'Julie. Julie, what the Hell? Are you OK?' And in the same breath she said, 'You fucking bastards, get out of here. Get the fuck out of here.' And pretty well in the same breath again she called out, 'Beth. Beth, get in here. Where are you? We've got trouble.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And so did we. Brad and me.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My gun was still in my pocket so it wasn't evident yet and she, the dirty blonde one, was coming at us like a runaway freight train. She wasn't afraid of anything and knew lots of the martial arts, multi-disciplines you might say. At the same time, Beth, the tall one, and the one I considered the most dangerous, was responding.

Page 22.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Sally, what the? What the fuck's wrong?' And she seemed to be charging our way also. We couldn't see her but we could hear her. I motioned to Brad to go for Sally and I'd deal with Beth.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But Brad wasn't exactly a match for Sally's first Karate kick and she landed a good one to his chest and he went sprawling. At about the same moment, Beth appeared all anxious and full of fight and I just managed to get my pistol out and it ended up jammed under her nose.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She wanted to slug me out cold but wasn't sure she could before I could pull the trigger. She walked backwards, the way she'd just come, ever so slowly and I commanded her, 'On your fucking knees or I'll shoot. And tell her to back off or I'll shoot again.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad had righted himself and he was doing fairly better. She had come for a second kick and he side stepped her nicely and landed a good gut punch to her sweet soft belly that winded her. He grabbed onto her shoulder and landed a strong smack to her tit. She didn't like her jug being bashed. Her eyes exploded more than her jug did and she cradled her arms around herself to try to prevent a second blow. She needn't have worried about that. Brad was a fucking pit bull. He'd dropped to his knees and sent her a rifle fist right into her majora lips and you want to see a bitch stagger and hunched over before she threw up and passed out. Man, oh man, was Sally a sight, like a drunken sailor who'd just been castrated with a dull can opener. And I was so proud of Brad. He looked so pleased and self-satisfied, like he always knew he could do it, and now he had.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now mine, Beth really got dangerous and didn't give a flying fig or a crawling fuck about my piddly gun. Seeing her friend ruptured and disrespected like that had sent rivers of adrenalin streaming through her veins right to her outrage center.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She grabbed me like a banshee, like a killer crab in her claws, and locked onto my throat. She was trying to crush my windpipe&nbsp; and was doing a pretty fair job of squashing my Adam's apple. I took a few ineffectual swings at her, but I couldn't connect and was fast losing consciousness and the battle. I could see it in her eyes, the hatred and intent and the willingness to kill me. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And she was about to smash my testicles with her knee.

Page 23.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When, fuck.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She just hung there like she'd been electrocuted, like she'd been shot and I supposed she might as well have been.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad had come prepared with a nice boning knife, from my rape/kidnapping kit, about a four inch blade, and now it was stuck up in her ass, just missing her rectum and her vaginal opening too. He'd used a swift upward thrust arc and the point was lodged into her pelvic bone, maybe half an inch in deep. As much as she didn't want to, she had to let go of my throat.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I coughed back to being in control but fuck did my throat hurt and she was sunk to the floor and out cold too. Brad looked so proud of himself that he'd saved my neck.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I rolled her onto her side because I hadn't see how Brad had stopped her, but now I could see why she'd quit. Fuck all mighty, that had to hurt.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Man. Fuck. You nailed her good. We'd better take a look to see if she's going to bleed to death. I'd prefer she didn't.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I didn't do wrong, did I?' He was genuinely concerned.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'No you still don't get it. There is no wrong. Just what you want to do when you do it. You're the captain of that ship. But I'd just prefer she not bleed to death, yet. But if she does, so what, there's still two more. But if we can stabilize her, she'd got lots more good fucks in that cunt. So let's see if we can fix her.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We secured her hands in front using nylon cord but didn't gag her or the other one yet. The only one who couldn't screech was Julie, the brunette in the bedroom, the first one we'd encountered.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The two of us pawed at Beth to get her shorts off, The knife was right through the weave of the fabric and her pink shorts were fast turning a deeper shade.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Get a towel. Get a couple of towels and see if you can find any band aids.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now wasn't that rich? A woman stabbed like that and I wanted to aid her with a band.

Page 24.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad didn't want to miss any of the good stuff but he knew he should do what I asked. He was off like a jack-rabbit and I could hear him tossing stuff into the sink and onto the floor in the bathroom. Fast and proudly he re-appeared with a role of elastic tape, like tensor stuff for compression dressings and two big bath towels.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I couldn't get her shorts all the way down because of the way the knife was pinning them to her and I didn't want to pull the knife out until I saw where it'd gone in. She could easily bleed to death if some artery had been sliced and that would be too soon for her to die. Handling her and seeing how beautiful she was up close, Brad agreed with me about that now too.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Brad, find some scissors. Ones that'll cut fabric. We gotta get her shorts off.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He rocketed off again and was back with the snippers in what seemed like all of ten seconds. His eyes were big and his pecker bigger. He'd never seen such great shit before, barely even in his fantasies and now he was going to see a knife stuck in a pussy and he's stabbed it in there.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It took a bit of doing to snip around the knife and get her shorts off. I handled her gingerly and the blood had stopped some so that was encouraging. While I was concentrating, Brad had fished one of her tits out and was making great suckling sounds as he tried to drink her and it was the hardest thing he'd ever done not to bite right into her nipple. He expressed her pretty good and got about a tea spoon of liquid out of her and into him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her shorts were aside and her silk panties punctured through too. Boy had he used a baseball bat swing when he shot the knife into her, looking for a home run right off, I guessed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her ass was almost bare and her tit was out and she was starting to come to.

Page 25.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was all set to scream about her pain.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Opened how they were, her eyes were wider than the Grand Canyon and her cunt pain just as deep, like a mile. I took hold of her cheek and forced the gun barrel between her teeth.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You're hurt. You're fucking hurt and we have to fix you, or I can just shoot you now. You want me to do that?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now her wide open eyes pleaded without reservation.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And she shook her head.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'No? No, I didn't think you'd want that so I'm going to take the gun out of your mouth and you don't fucking scream. You can cry and beg all you want, but no fucking screaming. Understand?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She nodded again and out popped my pistol.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. What have you done to me? What? What? Oh God.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I assumed she was feeling it in her down below.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Oh God. Why'd you do that?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Don't look at me, look at him. He did it.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Not that I wouldn't have, but just not so soon.)
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad looked proud and accomplished and had a hold of his boner.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So listen to me, this is fucking going to hurt. I can tell you, where he got you it'll hurt, but we have to see where the knife actually is.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Knife? Knife, he stabbed me? You stabbed me? You bastard. You stabbed me&nbsp; - there?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad nodded his pride and self-approval.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So we gotta look, you understand? You have to spread your legs.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So wasn't that the richest detail? She had to spread them so we could find where she'd been stabbed in the pussy and was it likely to be fatal, and both of us would be staring into her bared vagina. No privacy nor dignity there. It was like I was playing doctor or surgeon or like I cared when all I wanted to do was keep her from dying so we could slowly kill her later, like protracted.

Page 26.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She couldn't believe that or even think about it. All she could think was that the pain was unbelievable and intensely personal.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Brad, buddy, you old cunt stabber, get some booze, some hard stuff. She's gonna need it and it might help her.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He saw the sense in that and so did she when he returned with a quarter full bottle of rye whiskey. She downed three good shot glasses and Brad and I had two each. I went back to cutting her panties off from around the knife.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad seemed to know instinctively to comfort her. He brushed her cheek and stroked her hair and even kissed her quivering lips gently. Her chin quivered too and she was so on the verge of tears. It was when he fingered her nipple, almost absent mindedly, that she didn't appreciate it nor him. She started to rear up, just as I had her panties cut freed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Hold on buddy. Give her a rest. I have to clean this mess up. Hold her fucking legs apart.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The only way to see how the knife blade was lodged in her was for her to be laying full faced down with her ankles east and west. We twisted her into position and despite her squawks, she ended up just as I needed her and Brad pinned the back of her calves of her legs by kneeling on them. Man had he been two hundred percent cunt lucky. Lucky in that he hadn't killed her so we'd still have her to rape and torture along with the other two. From a purely greedy cock perspective, three were so much better than two.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The knife had caught neither her rectum nor her vaginal canal but had just punctured the fatty part of her outer labia and had driven into her pelvic bone at the under part, pretty well a harmless slice. Certainly plenty painful but far from life threatening.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I'd forgotten to ask Brad to soak one of the towels and he hadn't thought to do it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I need this wet, soaking wet in hot water.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He could see the logic again and was up off her outspread legs and she tried to clamp them shut.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I needed to straighten her out.

Page 27.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I got up to her head and twisted her face to confront me.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You need to pay attention, like really listen. You're tough. I'll give you that. You think you're tough but I'm tougher. And my new friend, my new found partner, I have no idea what he's capable of.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad had returned and was mesmerized by my words to her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I mean, he fucking stabbed you and he could have killed you, so you listen up. You belong to us. You have no fucking rights, not even to consideration and neither do they. But right now it's you, and your ass is ours and your fucking cunt and tits too. So here's the deal. I'm gonna get that knife out of you and you're going to let me and you're gonna let me clean you up too. You understand?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was sort of resistant but more understood.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Good. So good, you're being smart and just to reward you, you know what's going to happen when I'm all done? Like reward you for your co-operation?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She barely indicated she didn't know, nor did she want to know.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I suppose you don't, but my buddy here, my good friend here, he's going to fuck you, That's your reward.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Oh man. Man thanks Jim. Oh man.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He couldn't have been more agreeable nor Beth more disagreeable.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You up for than, my friend?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Oh man shit. In the cunt or in the ass?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Yours to chose. Whatever your little pecker head's desire is.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'The cunt. The cunt, I want her pussy. I'll do her ass later.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;None of our conversation was sitting well with Beth. The pain had subsided in her labia, only in that it had been anesthetized by the natural pain killers in her blood stream. She'd be dammed if she was going to let herself be fucked without putting up a fight and the next sequence of events were beyond credibility, like were incredulous and stretched all rational belief and logical capabilities.

Page 28.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She had acrobatic training, like gymnastic and she curled herself up tightly into a front rolled ball and then exploded open like a reversed bear trap. She fired herself to the side and up-righted herself and bent way down, grabbed onto the knife handle and yanked it out of her pubic bone. Like fucking feeling no pain super woman. The knife was sharper than a honed razor and she sliced through the nylon cord binding her wrists, like it was wet spaghetti, and now she was a heightened threat, like defcon one. (the US military defense readiness condition) 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She completely surprised both of us and I think even herself.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was one of the most spectacular acts of courage I'd ever seen and involved a complete disregard for her own pain she might induce. She didn't give a fuck if it killed her. At least then it'd be her doing it to herself and not us doing it for her. Same results, I supposed, but different significance, at least for her. Or so she needed to believe that it mattered, like some how then she'd retained some honor. And what do they say for the terminally ill? - 'Death with dignity.' And she had a terminal illness alright, us.  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They just didn't know she had it yet.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She waved the knife in our general direction like it was a magic wand to make us disappear, or at least retreat, and Brad knew exactly what to do. He was fast over to Sally who was still unconscious and he hoisted her to her dangling feet and pulled her to face Beth. He held her under her armpits, let go of her and at the same moment kneed her square in the clit. Everyone could hear the cracking sound, like something spinal or special breaking.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Want me to do it again?' Brad challenged Beth's knife.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I'll really hurt her next time.' He continued.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'No. No, God no.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Then drop the knife. Throw it over here or she's history.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I looked at Brad with absolute approval and respect, even admiration. He'd taken the initiative and oh, what an initiation it'd been. He must have had a fucking sore knee cap.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She looked at me for help.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Better do what he says. I think he means it.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I held my hand out for the knife and ever so slowly she surrendered it (along with her life).
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I wiped the blade in the wet towel and she just stood there unsteady and tottering.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then Beth sank to the floor resigned and tending to the cut in her cunt, trying to see how deep it was, which was difficult because it was sort of inaccessible. She whimpered as she pried at the slice. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Brad, buddy? Your knee still OK?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He nodded.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Think you can break your knee cap this time?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He could have kissed me, or at least given me a nice friendly back pat.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He fired his leg so hard into Sally's pussy, I think he dislocated her spine at the bottom. 

Page 29.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beth screamed out, 'No. No, you said. You promised. No.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad's knee had acquired a taste for mashed cunt, for smashed cunt lips.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her body convulsed upwards two more times before he let her collapse in a broken crotch heap to the floor.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You wanna fuck her or her?' I asked him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had never had such an abundance of choices and his pants and briefs were off in a jiffy. He was a pretty decent specimen of a man. Well endowed you'd have to say, at least I would and I had no homosexual tendencies at all. Just calling a dick a spade, I guess, and he was well pumped to employ it but didn't know who the lucky lady was going to be. And then as if he didn't surprise me again.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He'd taken a shine to Julie, off in the bedroom still, since hers were the first bare tits he'd seen when he got in the cottage, so he took off to retrieve her and she'd awakened so he pushed her stumbling into where the other two were.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'This one. I want to fuck this one.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So why aren't you? What are you waiting for then?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Julie had sobered up because of her terror and she didn't want his cock, nor mine for that matter either. But when Brad had absolute control, he wasn't one to be refused. She should have seen that right off from the other two piles of beaten female flesh her friends were, sprawled on the floor like so much spilled garbage&nbsp; and all the fucking blood from between Beth's legs. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But Julie wasn't in a seeing mood.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Hold her Brad. Hold her under her arm pits from behind. I wanna soften her up for you.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He knew I needed my fun too. He couldn't hog all the breaking, bashing and mutilating.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He held her hoisted the way I'd said and I confronted her, face to face. I had the boning knife from Beth's cunt in my hand.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Remember me at the restaurant. You took something of mine. You stole from me, so I'm going to take something of yours.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She tried to wriggle but Brad was strong and kept her stretched still.

Page 30.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'The paper. Your paper. You mean your newspaper?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Fucking right? You remember. You thought it was all a big joke.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'But I'm sorry. I was just horsing around. Kabitzing around. It was only a paper.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I smacked her cheeks.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'But it was no ordinary newspaper. It was a ticket.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'What? Uh?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'It was a ticket for us to come and get you and her and her. You should have minded your own fucking business because now we're going to mind it for you.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad's boner was starting to work its way inbetween her ass cheeks. He couldn't control his pecker head much longer.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'No. No. No, stop it. Don't. No.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Fuck man, you doin' her in the ass?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He looked sheepish.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Can you wait?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I dunno?' He replied like he was suffering.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Tell you what. Can you just shove it in her, like impale her but don't start thrusting or pumping until I'm done with her, done making her chose.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His eyes lit up like a kid in the cunt candy store and he buggered his bat into her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I could see her gulp a deep breath and almost pass out but she knew better than to do that. But she was getting to the incoherence, like she had been drunk, but still she wasn't. I pinned her face in my fist and gave her a really sweet kiss and then continued.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So you owe me for my paper and you have to pay up.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her eyes were defiant and she wanted to say fuck you, to me and I supposed to Brad too since he had his flag pole still stuck up her ass hole into her bowels.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So you fucking chose?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'What?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I put the knife tip to the tip of her nipple.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I want this.'

Page 31.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I could feel Brad give her a little pump thrust. He almost couldn't help himself from starting when he heard that. It was one of his all time favorite fantasies, cutting off a woman's nipples and now that's what he was hearing about from the new guy with a knife in his hand.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'No. No, God no. You can't be serious. No.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Do I look like I'm kidding? Does this look like a toy knife?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Choose? You said I had to chose. Please, what else?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I kissed her again and slowly slid the knife point over to her other nipple and the scope of her choices became apparent.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad gave her three fast pumps.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And I don't know how he kept from cumming.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Julie started to bawl, like really cry and tremble and shudder. Great gobs of sobs and I back handed her hard across the face to straighten her out and to stifle her. I wouldn't even afford her her right to tears.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So you fucking chose, or I'll take them both.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Listen. Listen. You don't have to do this. I really know how to fuck. Let me show you. Let me please.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Does he know how?' I meant Brad with his pecker still up her ass, trying like stink not to ride her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her mouth started to tremble and quiver.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Come on. How does his prick feel in your ass?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Pretty well every victim that I'd ever had, knew at some point, that a particular abuse she was trying desperately to avoid was become inevitable and Julie could feel it at that point. She had to chose a nipple to be cut off or lose two of them. Not Sophie's Choice (The movie - 1982 - Meryl Streep)&nbsp; but Julie's Choice, like in the now and then and for real.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She retreated back into her catatonia but I wouldn't let her refuge there.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You stay lucid, you fuckling stay with us or with me as I swear, I fucking swear I'll cut your cunt apart.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad couldn't help himself any longer. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was all too much.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was all too sweet and delicious.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He barely moved his sacks but he spunked her rectum.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Fuck man, you just do her?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Couldn't help it. You talk about cutting her cunt - apart, fucking apart and I couldn't help it.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Not to worry buddy, how long for you to recharge?'

Page 32.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Half an hour? No twenty minutes, can you give me?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Hey this is your rape fantasy come true. Cum true as in c.u.m., ha ha. Take as long as you want besides we better get the bitch's cunt patched up.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He could tell we were going to be life long buddies using the buddy system or I supposed the buddy systematic, would be more accurate.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He extracted his spent boner out of her juiced ass and she was barely lucid but she knew she'd been buggered. Not violently, but quite effectively no matter.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We both turned to face Beth with her punctured labia.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And began to advance on her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She looked meek and vulnerable, even though she was so tall, and her eyes just pleaded with us to leave her alone. She could tend to her injury herself and that's what she wanted to do. She didn't want a bunch of grubby probing, hungry fingers messing around inside her privates.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What the fuck she wanted, didn't matter two fucks to us.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We both stood over her and Brad's rod was half way across her torso, he was so elongated and erect. I could have hung a flag, a big red one from it. She needed to hang a flag of surrender, from it. That's what would have served her best, but Beth wasn't one to go down without a fight either.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I went to crawl up between her legs to start to spread them and she lashed out with her foot. She missed me but she caught Brad a good one to his shin. I guessed he shouldn't have been crowding in on her like he was. He didn't take kindly to that and managed to snag the offending ankle and be damned if he didn't ram her leg straight up so that her foot fairly touched her head.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You want her spread so you can see?' He asked me.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I nodded.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Is this spread enough?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Actually it was and the half inch long slice wound was clearly visible for me to address.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I nodded again.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I think you meant no.' Brad said as he really pulled and rammed down on her stretched up leg and then her foot was above her head touching the floor.

Page 33.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'That's good. Fuck man, yeah I can really see where she's sliced. Let me get the tape.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I bounded the few feet to where we'd thrown it on the floor and came back with it and the scissors too. I cut a small patch&nbsp; about an inch square and then Brad let go of her foot. He leg retreated downward and I couldn't see the patch spot anymore.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Fuck, what're you doing. I can't mend her now.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'No. No, fuck, I want to see too. I made her injury I want to see it up close.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He said it like the injury belonged to him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beth was less resistive as we pulled her legs apart in the regular fashion and Brad got down to her business like a bug inspector and feasted his eyes on his handywork.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Geeze, I really just missed all the good stuff, didn't I. I could have killed her. Geeze were we lucky.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He ran his finger along the cut and I handed him the little pussy patching patch. He went to apply it just right and then we would be done.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At least I thought we were almost.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But then Brad way surpassed even himself.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Shit man, that's a pretty deep cut. Right to the bone. I don't think the tape'll be enough.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Yeah. it should be OK. She's not bleeding that much anymore.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'No. Why don't we sew it?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Uh? How?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You saw that sewing machine, didn't you?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Yeah, I think so.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'In the corner, on the table. All the stuff on it?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'OK. OK, yeah.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Well?' 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad was playing twenty riddles.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Well what? How we gonna get her cunt up onto it to stitch her?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad really laughed, right from the belly. He was visualizing us trying to do that. I joined in giggling with him since it was so utterly impossible and ludicrous.

Page 34.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So dummy, there has to be other sewing stuff. What do you call them, condiments?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'No, that's what you eat.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Notions. That's it. There have to be sewing notions, so use a regular needle and thread.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Man, man. What could be more perfect?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Yeah, see? I was right.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'For sure. See if there are any.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It didn't take him long to re-appear with just what he thought we needed. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What we needled 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And then Brad whispered in my ear.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Oh fuck, shit, you're bad. You're fucking really bad to the bone.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Right to this bone I am.' He enthused as he hauled his pecker into first gear and smacked its engine back into life. He wasn't stalled any longer.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I spoke right to Beth and her buddies listened intently.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'My friend here, he is my friend you know. We're bosom buddies. So what's that make all you and your tits. Bosom, bosom buddies?' 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There I was, trying not to be facetious again. I needed to go to remedial class for that. Geeze, guilty again and again.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So as I was saying, my friend here, he wants one of you two, to be a friend and help her out. One of you stitch her up.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You could have heard a pin drop but a needle would have to do, or in a pinch, a hat pin. I always had a little clear plastic box of a hundred of those three inch, pearl headed suckers in my rape briefcase, my kidnapping kit. And up until then had forgotten about those nicey nicies.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So who's the sewer? Whose machine is it?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sally was a dreaming, wanna-be fashion designer and it was a cut-throat business. It somewhat dove-tailed with her beautician enterprise and she had made a few decent contacts.

Page 35.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It sort of got me thinking, sort of speculating. If vaginas had lips which we all knew they did, did the lips form a mouth, like the mouth of the canal. So if there's a mouth, is there a throat?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Just think, if there was a vaginal throat, and connect it to a cut-throat business and the many ways to wring it. My notions were wandering all over the silly places.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sally didn't want to say, but Julie wasn't up for sewing Beth's cunt and she sort of indicated Sally with a glance.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You. You know how to sew?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She couldn't see any point in lying and nodded.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So it's you then. You do the honors.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I.. No, I don't want to. I don't know how to.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You can do it if we make you, so don't make us make you.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She pretty well knew she'd be left no choice, eventually.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad passed her the needle and spool of red thread and try as she might, she was shaking and trembling so much she couldn't come close to threading the needle, beside she could barely see it through her gush of tears.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I slid up behind and ran my hands down the sides of her head, down to around her throat. I leaned close to her ear and whispered. 'Fucking thread it or or I'll sew your cunt up instead. I'll sew your fucking lips together.' I gave her a tissue and she wiped the flood from her eyes and had the thread in second try.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Bingo babe. Right in.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I slapped her cheek and gave her a juicy kiss.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So good. We're good to go. Good to sew, ha ha.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I pulled Sally, by her hair, over to Beth and they mewled at each other, like baby kittens that didn't have their eyes open yet. They really liked each other, even loved, and had only tried the lesbian thing once. They both found they preferred a live stiff cock to a dead stiff dildo. But the upside was, Sally'd already seen and handled Beth's cunt up close. She stroked Beth's cheek tenderly and then slid down to face her crotch and the task at hand. Brad and I each grabbed one of Beth's ankles and pulled her way too wide apart giving her the super splits.

Page 36.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'For God's sake. Stop it. You're hurting her.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We tugged harder to make her more spread.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Stop it or I won't do it. I swear I won't do it if you keep hurting her like that. You don't have to.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sally really had to remember where she was. Like what her situation was and who was in charge.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I looked at Brad.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He looked back at me. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And her defiance and attitude had tweaked his pecker too, and his retaliation center.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We didn't say a word but got up at the same time and descended on Sally. Brad slugged her in the lower back aiming right for her kidneys and I punched her up the side of her head at about the same moment. She didn't pass out but fell right to her side and begged for no more.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Pull her fucking legs apart. And keep her still.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He did his best and I found the needle and thread and headed for her crotch with it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was set to really fight when she got the standard warning when there were other potential victims handy.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You hold still, or they die. They both fucking die.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She settled down and I picked the spot where I was going to give her the first vaginal lip closing stitch. Shit did the needle sink in easily, but it was when it had to puncture out the other side of her first lip to head back into the second one, fuck did that freak her. She knew she was risking all their lives but she couldn't help herself from trying to protect her soft tissue. I managed to get the needle right in and through, and the thread along with it and was tying it off to complete the first stitch. She had to howl and wriggle so Brad clubbed her belly and then her temple and she was fully knocked out. Sort of a one-two punch you could say. 

Page 37.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now it was easy to put five more stitches right through her labia, and I let Brad do two of them. Each stitch was an individual one, like a knot tied off and it looked fucking fantastic when we were done. She'd have to piss through a straw but that would be OK too. We wouldn't be fucking her for any time soon, but that was just ripe OK. It meant she'd be saved for later. I supposed they were like chastity stitches so we didn't need a belt and Brad had belted her enough for then.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now we went back to Beth and sewed her cunt cut up ourselves. It was a cinch to do and she didn't struggle much after she saw how Sally was all sewn up. Brad figured he should still use the elastic patch and finally applied it just right and we were done, at least I thought we were until he shoved his index and middle fingers so far into her vagina her eyes bugged open and he scratched at her cervix.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Fucking bitch.' He muttered beautifully. 'Fucking cunt bitch.' He repeated himself even nicer and then he pulled his fingers out of her, licked them off and punched her lightly to the top of her labia where her clit hung around. It wasn't a clit rupturing smash, more of one just hard enough to make her pass out.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She buckled forward and flopped back quite unconscious. Brad got up and looked extremely satisfied with himself.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I figured when you were fingering her you were going to fuck her too.' I suggested to him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'No, I'm saving the next one for her, remember?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And, of course I did.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was such a pleasure being able to rest while I watched somebody else do the fucking and raping. For me a totally new form of spectacular spectator sport.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But, then again, I was never not up for an open invitation.

Page 38.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Julie had watched in horror as we messed with Beth to patch her snatch and now Brad was ready to consummate her cunt, but he wanted to share lots of the pleasure with me. He got behind her and just felt like hoisting her. He gripped his eager hands into her arm pits, from behind, and pushed up strong, under them and elevated her right up above his head.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'How's this for weight lifting? For the clean and jerk?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Yeah, more like the dirty and jerk off.' I joked it back at him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had his arms fully extended holding her suspended high above his head. She was facing me full, trying to wiggle and kick so I locked onto her ankles and shoved my chin right into her gyrating labia. I shot my hands up to her crotch and did a simultaneous double thumb probe of her twat and then stretched her as wide open as a basket ball hoop. Talk about new meanings for 'shoot some hoops' and a slam dunk. I near tore her opening open and then I pushed as hard up into her as I could, raising her even further than Brad had her, all by her cunt. She twisted, trying to get away and teetered forward and we all lost our balances. She toppled forward onto and over me and Brad followed along from behind and we ended up pancaked, the bunch of us, right on top of Beth.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You've never heard so much female screaming and male laughter. I mean we had hands and cocks everywhere and they had tits and cunts all around to be grabbed and grabbed onto and smacked. It was like a kid's school yard, on the slippery ice, pile on
free for all and Brad and me just hooted and hollered mostly as they increased their wails.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Talk about the sexual divide, the difference between the sexes, like shit man, we kept at it and at them. Like wresting with them for a good five minutes and we totally forgot about Sally.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She knew she was in the hands of a duo of murdering psychopaths who seemed to enjoy their work way too much, and who had had the temerity to stitch her vagina closed, so she had to make a try for it. To make a run for it to save some lives.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad noticed first.

Page 39.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'The other one. Where's the other one?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We both dumped our two pile-mates off onto the floor and took off trying to see where she'd run away to. It hadn't been very long but a 911 call, how long does it take to push a phone button on speed dial?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad realized pretty quick we couldn't leave the two of them alone, so he was back in to corral them.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I'd have to look by myself.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How could we be so careless? So preoccupied?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What the fuck now?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have the funniest gift.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Call it a knack or a seventh sense, but a terrified woman gives off a smell, a vibration, whatever you want to call it and all I had to do was be still for a moment and see where the nose led me.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She'd heard us notice she was trying to go.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I honed my gift and focused on the bedroom where Julie had been. There were no vibes, no cunt in there. There were two more bedrooms and one I was drawn to. I peered in and rolled my eyes all around the room and no clear sign, but a little mouse between my legs told me there was a pussy in there somewhere.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad called out, 'You find her?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'No. Not yet. You got everything under control there?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Yeah, it's good. They're not going anywhere.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That sounded promising and I wanted to see how he had them so I stepped out of the doorway to look at them piled on top of each other and Brad sitting proud as punch, bare assed and stiff dicked again, right on top of them. Talk about king of the hill, or prince of the mounds. He fucking loved the throne he'd ascended.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As I did, as I cleared the bedroom doorway, I'd caught the smallest glimpse of the littlest movement under the bed. She wasn't going fucking anywhere. As I went back to flush her out I called out again, 'No. No, I don't see her yet. She didn't get outside, did she?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'No, I don't think so. Come on man, don't shit me. You gotta find her. Our balls are on the line here.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His balls were on the pile of cunts and mine were on the line of sight to where Sally was.

Page 40.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I'll tell you, when I do, the bitch is dead. Dead. I'll fucking slice her cunt into little pieces, little bits, and fry them and eat them. I'll cut her fucking tits off and make them eat them except for her nipples. We get one of those each.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I knew she was hearing every delicious, appetizing word of it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You better find her first before you can do that.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Yeah, I suppose. You're right. That only makes sense. No body, no chewy.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Hurry up, but hurry up. I can't keep these two whores down forever besides I want to fuck one again. I'm so ready.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'She's here. She's here somewhere. I can smell her juicy cunt. Her trembling vagina and I know she's scared shitless. Maybe she even shit herself. Her fucking CJ, you know what that is?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Uh, what?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Her CJ? You know what it is?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I should, but fill me in.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Like OJ for orange juice, but cunt juice, CJ.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Right on man, I love it and I'd like to get some right about now.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Her CJ, it's spilling right out of her, probably in a puddle on the floor.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'More likely she's pissing herself if she can hear you.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Oh she can. I'm sure of it, she can and she'd listening very intently, like we have her fullest attention.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You're too much man, just go and finish finding her. You checked all the bedrooms?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I'm in one now and like I said, she can hear me, like she's fucking trying not to, but she can.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad was so bright and brilliant.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So why don't we find out? Why don't I kill one of her friends to get her to come out?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Which one?' I asked as if it was immaterial.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I don't care. You got any preference.'

Page 41.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Yeah. I got it in for Julie. She still owes me so I'd like to be the one to finish her off, if you don't mind.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So Beth it is then, if you want to off Julie.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Good, go for it then. Kill the fucking cunt. You stabbed her in it once, now shove the knife right through her cervix.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'OK, Jim, I'm good to go. On the count of ten.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was some heavy hitting and lifting and then he called out, 'One, two, three.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He enunciated and exaggerated each number.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Four, five, six, seven. - Shit is she ever going to bleed out nice.' He called out and I could tell he was excited. He was that close to murdering his first woman.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Eight, nine.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And at that point a little bit of her appeared peeking out from under the bed. She squirmed out from under the mattress.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Hold it. Hold it. I think we've got something here. What have we got here? Shit for fuck, it looks like our runaway cunt. Brad buddy, right on buddy, I've got her here. If you still want to cunt stab her, go ahead but why don't we leave that for later?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Ten-four buddy. Breaker, breaker out and away.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I loved his truck humor.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My bitch looked out from under the bed, up at me, with the most begging eyes I'd ever seen and I was in no mood to pity her. I hadn't fucked anyone yet and she'd do just as good as any of them. I sidled over, to crouch down over her terrified face. She could tell I wanted to be mean, as in extreme. I had a pretty big load of rocks to get off and I wanted to bash her over the head with them, after they'd battered her cunt.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Hey Brad, you wanna watch. You want to see me in action? Bring them down here so they can watch too. You need some help?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'No. Shit, what a great idea. I can handle it. I can handle them.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And I was sure he could because in about three minutes they came stumbling and tilting into the bedroom and Brad after them like a range rider on a cutting horse. He corralled them like an expert and I could see I could learn a thing or four from him also.

Page 42.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So now there was five of us in one medium sized bedroom and still it wasn't a crowd. But it sure was a party, a rape party and all the bodies were present.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Fuck it.' I said, 'Let's do this different. Lets line them up, like an inspection.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad looked eager.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'We gotta talk anyway. They gotta know.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad didn't know where I was headed but he trusted me implicitly by then and relished the surprise I probably had in store.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It took some doing and lots of gun and knife waving, and slapping around, but at last they were lined up just as we'd pictured, shortest to the tallest.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Julie, Sally and Beth and prime cunts all with fantastic tits still.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I strolled back and forth across in front of them being sure to feast my eyes on all their good bits and being sure they could see it. It was no sneak peak at that gathering. I took their sweet time and then proceeded to pronounce.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So here's the deal, the real deal. You're coming with us. We're transporting you from here to somewhere else.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They looked so alarmed and really concerned and started to mutter, 'no, no' amongst themselves. They thought I was done.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Shut up and listen, the best is still to come.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They snapped back to my attention.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So we're moving you, but only two.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then there were some really wide open eyes staring at me in disbelief.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'No. No. What?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Yeah, that's right. You fucking get it. One of you gets done here and then we leave with the other two. We're not feeding three of you. We don't care which one, but you chose and if you don't, or won't, we'll kill all three of you right in this room.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad was ecstatic.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The bitches had to chose who would die. It was the most perfect scenario he could have dreamed up, even by himself, in the privacy of his own room and perversions.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But that was the beauty of two attuned malignant dick-heads being so much better than one lonely one.

Page 43.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As it turned out, it seemed our party girls weren't into killing each other. But it only seemed that way for quite awhile.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But then I remembered I still had some unfinished business with Julie concerning my stolen newspaper.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Oh yeah, shit, before you choose, I got a cunt to fuck and I wouldn't want it to be a dead one.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They looked a little shocked but relieved. If I was fucking I wasn't murdering which was sort of better.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'God my prick's getting thirsty for some juice. Anybody got any cunt juice to spare?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'CJ. CJ, oh yeah, CJ.' Brad enthused.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I laughed, then we both did.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'How about a clit or two? What say we roast a clit or three?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We laughed even louder.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'No volunteers. What, you bunch of sissy pussies don't even deserve to live.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All of a sudden Beth reared up and exploded in indignation. She would not be dehumanized that way and she wouldn't let it happen to her friends. Not as long as there was an ounce of fight and courage left within her. And dignity. We should never be allowed to forget their dignities.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But that was just the thing. I was into indignities and Brad was coming along just fine too.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As part of one of her assertiveness training courses, Beth'd been taught to look defiant, as if she couldn't do it naturally, didn't come by it honestly. She'd even had coaching to augment her natural affinity for it further. The idea was to repel a would be attacker by not only showing no fear, but by assuming the role of aggressor, like steal the initiative from a hopeful rapist. She was fuming furious, that erupted into a tirade. She wanted to kill me, both of us with words and reasons.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You little mealy mouthed useless dick. You think you can terrorize us like this? Terrorize me and get away with it? You fucking deluded little prick. Let me loose and I'll show you. Oh, sure, you're strong, you're a big macho man with me tied like this and us constrained, but let me loose and I kick the fucking crap out of your balls and face and I'll snap your useless prick off.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I didn't think it was useless. It was good for raping her and for pissing in her face the way she was trying to piss in mine with her invective.

Page 44.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The thing with Beth was she was spewing forth because she thought she'd never have to deliver on nor defend her outburst. But I loved fighting with women, especially when lives were at stake and I had a fucking great idea and Brad just had to be apprised.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I called him aside, just outside the door to the bedroom.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You think she meant it?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Fuck, for sure. Is she ever pissed with you. Pissed at us.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'She looks pretty strong, doesn't she?' I said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'She's fit and lean and you can see she's worked out. You know she's taken defensive training and that assertiveness shit.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Yeah, you're right.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So? So, what? What gives?' 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad was eager to find out what I had up my sleeve or down my pant leg.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I'd like to fight her. Like she said.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Get real, like she could beat you, maybe even kill you.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I know but that's what makes it so exciting, that added risk.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I get you there, but what about me? What do you want me to do?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Shit no, I'd never fight her alone. That would be too risky. It could even be suicide. No, the two of us together. Two on one. We fight her like that.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He started to giggle like a naughty schoolboy looking at dirty pictures and gave me a warm approving back slap.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'How do we do it?' He asked eagerly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'We tie the other two up good and tight, but they have to watch and we close the door. We close ourselves in with them, with her and we remove all her restraints. All of them and then we fight. She fights us.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'OK, yeah but what if it gets out of hand? What if she starts to win?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'What I'll do. I'm gonna stash the gun under the bed. I'll do it so none of them sees and if either one of us cries 'uncle', OK? We call out the actual word uncle, the other guy dives for the gun and starts shooting, like blasting to kill, no questions asked. Just fill their brains with lead.' I paused to repeat. 'Uncle. So that's the word. Other than that we have a great slug-fest. I bet you can't wait to slug her tits. But think about it. We don't take her down too fast. We want to draw it out, even let her think she's winning. So pull your punches for some of it. And don't kick her too much. Some'll be OK but don't over do it. And don't always aim for her pussy either.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fact that he could kick her at all was a miracle come true to him, let alone hoof her in the twat and tits.

Page 45.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad was really smiling and took in all I said intently.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I continued, 'We pull our punches. Yeah like give her a three knuckle sandwich rather than five knuckles or a fifty mile an hour swing rather than a hundred. You hold back. You know, hold back but don't let her know you are. That way she won't know you've got more. Always keep the element of surprise in your back pocket. It's never let me down yet and it's even saved me a few times, saved my boner and my ass. And oh yeah too, remember this, you'll see my friend. I'll have a sweet surprise or two for you too.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'God. Shit, this is fantastic. Fuck man. Anything goes? Nothing off limits?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Punch her and kick her and bite her where ever the fuck you want. Everything goes, not just anything. But make it last. Don't smash her to bits right off.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So Brad was apprised and now Beth needed the same.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We went back in and closed the door behind us. Beth was as defiant as ever and her chin was way up and her tits way out.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I marched right up to her and slapped her cheeky cheeks and pinched her mouth into a silly looking o.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You're going to get your chance. You're so tough and determined so we'll see what you're made of.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If she was surprised she didn't let on and she didn't really look afraid either. Defiance, always show defiance. That was the mantra of her fight-back training. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am woman. I am strong. I am defiant.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Brad would you head off to the kitchen and find two chairs and bring them here.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Sure OK.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'And bring some nylon cord, the roll&nbsp; in the case, and oh yeah, some scissors.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Like was there anything else I wanted? The kitchen sink too maybe?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This was to be a staged fight and there was no reason we couldn't stage it perfectly if we just took the time.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While Brad was fetching, I had a couple of extra nice surprises I set into place for him.

Page 46.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was back with his shopping list of items.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We closed the door again, like locked ourselves in the cage with them and set the chairs for the other two non-combatants in front of the doorway. That way they'd present an effective blockade if Beth tried to make a run for it out through that door. She'd have to climb over them first and push them aside since the door opened inward. Brad grabbed on to Sally to get her over to tie her to the chair reserved for her. It had her fucking name and cunt on it and she didn't want to go. I went for Julie and she was rearing up too and didn't want to have to watch what she sensed, somehow, was rigged. She pulled back like a mule at the bridle and I felt like thumping her a bit first before we got to Beth.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Come on. Don't be like that. Be nice and co-operate. Look at Sally, she's all settled in and half tied up already.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But Julie was Julie and Sally was Sally and Julie wanted me to know that. She still wanted to play tug-of-war, or was that tug-a-whore?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Stop being such a cunt and get over there.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She didn't take kindly to my slur and tried to give me a body check with her shoulder. She sort of grazed me sending me a little of balance but her momentum carried her right forward and she fell down like a duck flat on its bill.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I didn't need that. What did I need that crap for?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She ended up with her ass in the air and her cheek to the floor and her ample banana labia were protruding out below her bum crack.&nbsp; I was never much of a foot ball player, but a sock-her player, man I was the greatest. I drove my big toe, attached to my driven foot, right into her crease, of course from behind her behind. She howled up like a whooping crane and then felled fast to the floor, pancaked flatter than a cancelled stamp.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That was short and sweet. One good cunt kick, one well placed labia crunch and she was done for. Fucking weakling.
What was she good for if I couldn't take my time kicking the shit out of her and one big toe did her in?

Page 47.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beth wanted to decry my actions but she knew she didn't have to. She'd get the chance to get even with me, if I'd just follow thorough and fight with her, keep my intentions focused on her. She'd get the chance to hoof my balls around like they were loose marbles after she'd detached them from my gunny-bag.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I hoisted Julie onto her chair and tied her securely to it. All the while she remained unconscious and a small trickle of blood had worked it's way out of her cunt and down her leg to her knee, but on the inside of her thigh. Something got busted, that was for&nbsp; sure and evident. Even a quack doctor could have seen that and it sort of went without saying she was going to be good and sore for the next ram fucks, but I liked to say it anyway. And I eagerly anticipated her regaining her consciousness and her sense of pain that went along with it. Localized and focused pain, you could say. I was sure she would.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I still needed to stash our insurance gun and needed to be sure it really was insurance. Beth was acutely aware of her surroundings and of all that went on around her. Sally was tied and trying to comfort Julia even though she wasn't awake yet.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I nudged Brad and whispered to him, 'the gun'.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He slightly nodded and I told him quietly again, 'Go distract Beth.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He didn't have to be asked twice to carry out an assignment like that. He paced his response to our whispering, not to create suspicions, and then meandered over to Beth who was fully inflated to be defiant. Her ego just wouldn't quit her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So you're going to fight him, are you?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She wouldn't say.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Yeah, I bet you can put on a pretty good show. You look strong to me. But smell isn't everything, ha ha.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You're disgusting. Shut the fuck up. You're pathetic you little scum-bag weasle.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'How about I have a little smell then to see if I'm right?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And his ruse was perfect in that it fully distracted her but it wasn't really a full ruse either since he got his nose buried almost in her up to her cervix with her labia pinched on each side of it. Like his nose was a weiner in her bun.

Page 48.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As she protested profusely and tried to expel his snozz, I slipped the cocked and fully loaded gun just inside the bed post leg, under the bed, at the top, on the floor.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I still needed to tell Brad, but that wouldn't be too hard besides he was otherwise occupied. Occupussied was more like it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The free-for-all and the none-for-free was about to begin.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He still had a rock-hard firm grip on Beth's hips and was ramming his front teeth against her clit trying to mash it against her pubic bone. She jerked her crotch wildly and that made her substantial tits undulate after they'd stopped flopping. I came up to her and steadied her nipple with my mouth and went to suckle on her. Brad had got half a teaspoon and now I wanted the other half.
Beth wasn't amenable. It wasn't that her jug was dry, she just didn't like having it's little tap bitten on. Brad popped his face out of her soggy cock toaster and looked so endearing with CJ, or this time CS, that would be cunt slime, dripping from the tip of his nose and his chin.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You ready man?' He sort of gurgled through the mouthfull of jelly he had from her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'When ever you are, but don't stop on my account.' I egged him on. To Beth I said, 'Is he any good at cunninglus? Although I prefer to call it cuntinglus, what about you?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It wasn't that, that he was doing and we both knew it. He was raping her with his teeth, not using his regular member, and we all three knew that too.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But regardless of the semantics, the labelling, the show was set to go on. I just had to get Julie conscious again so she could watch. We didn't want her missing any of the good parts of the party action. And it would be the most intense, right at the beginning, because then all the parties still had their full contingent of energy and get up and go.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I slapped her five minutes, every few seconds across her cheeky face and finally she started to moan and then shrieked. She had a well busted cunt. After her first shriek, she went into a low guttural moan which slowly morphed into a howl, but not really loud. More like plaintive, as in, look what I've lost, like the integrity and constitution of my vagina.

Page 49.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Geeze, Jim, you hear that? Too bad we didn't bring a recorder or a digital movie camera. We could put it on the internet. Geeze, she's doing it again.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And she was.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She sounded most like a cow that knew it was going to die. Not one in the slaughter house queue, all terrified and bug eyed and anxious, but one trapped for days without food or water that was drawing its last breath. Low and plaintive and resigned, that's how Julie moaned, over the death of her in-tact cunt. It wasn't an orgasmic moan at all, although she'd been pretty good at faking those when it suited her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But the thing was, nothing was missing from her pussy yet, there'd been no actual mutilation yet, so she still could heal, so I didn't have a lot of sympathy for her. When they're crying and moaning because they've been mutilated and the missing stuff is pointed out to them, then I supposed they were deserving of sympathy or consideration or even grudging respect. A woman who see's her own nipples missing from her tits, in her reflection in a mirror and who tries to keep on going, now those were the sexual martyrs and heroes. Trouble was nobody knew it but me. But now Brad would know too so that made it a hundred percent better, like twice as improved. Two for one appreciations.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I tended to Julie to coach her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Look, I get it. We all get it. It hurts. It fucking hurts.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I kissed her open mouth.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'But it'll hurt a fuck of a lot more if you don't buck up and shut the fuck up too. I'll take a fucking steel hammer to it. I'll splinter your pubic bone into shards. You want that?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There were a few choice words in my threat that resonated with her, right into her terror center and she just barely could indicate, no, and sucked in her tears and didn't make with another moan. Not even a hint of one. Good for her, but my hammer's head was disappointed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So now everything was exceptionally perfect and good to go, as the cliche speakers say.

Page 50.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'OK, Beth baby, we're good to go. You good to go?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Uh, what? No, what?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'We're all set. You ready to start?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'No. What? You said you'd fight me. I'm not fighting with him.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Brad. His name's Brad. Remember?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I'm not fighting with Brad too.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I beg to correct you, but yes you are.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'No. No, you said you. How can I fight Brad and then you?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I gave her a dumb, pleasant look.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Then? Then? And then me?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Yeah, I'm not. No.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So you got that right. Together sweets. You fight us together.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Oh no. No. No. That's not fair.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You didn't really think I was going to go one on one with you? Fuck, you're all full of hate and murder and out for revenge. Oh no. I'm not that stupid. Brad's there for my insurance and I'm there for back-up for him.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'No, I can't do that. It's so unfair.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Come on. Stop being such a cry baby. It's two against one for Christ's sake, only two for one. It's not like an army or a platoon where you see twenty guys train a woman. Train her, like fucking teach her, yeah that'd be good too, teach her to suck twenty cocks after they'd all been in her, so stop whining. It's time to cut you lose.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So now with the new odds, and the new numbering system, she didn't want to be lose.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'What, not so eager to fight now? What happened to all your macho feminist talk, like you're a female Rambo. Rambra, would be more like it. Ram-bra. Bra. Bra, I love it.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Please let me think. Let me think. Let me work it through, please.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Sure, work it out baby. Work it out. But let's get you freed.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I stalked over to her and Brad was right there like my body guard, my right hand man, and I cut her lose, wrists full unsecured and she was free. She could have run the three minute mile if she'd had the room.

Page 51.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I took hold of Brad's wrist and drew him back and away from her. He was ready to punch into her right off. She retreated into a corner and kept her back to us, but looked over her shoulder just to be sure of what we were up to. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We had both undressed, so only our peckers were up to anything. She was naked too. They all were, in case I forgot to mention such marvellous details.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beth was devising a plan. She had to get rid of the weaker one of us right away and she figured that was me, which it probably was. I was the one with the little girlie gun whereas a real man would have had a magnum forty-four or at least a bazooka or maybe a rocket launcher. My rocket launcher was between my legs but she failed to comprehend that yet.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And besides, what does size or agility have to do with how deep a scalpel can be made to cut or how many bullets a sissy gun can fire from point blank range?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I supposed it would be called a falsity of economies of scale and there was nothing false about my prick. It was all willingness.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad was moving towards her, sort of circling like in an Indian dance, but she wanted to get to me. She needed to slug my balls out of the park with her first swing. To hit her first chance at a home run and didn't she understand it'd have to be a double, like two balls off one bat?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As Brad aimed for her, she bolted and tried to clear past him, coming right at me. She didn't quite make it. He snared her wrist and yanked her back, like he'd reeled her in. She tugged her arm at his wrist and her jugs hung down like pendulums and they were swaying as much as grand mother clock's pendulums do.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He tugged harder, dragging&nbsp; her away from my direction and I ran and leapt on to her back like a leap frog but I didn't get all the way over her. I latched onto her from behind, to ride her, like to have her carry me around the way she would piggy back a little kid and she protested out quite loudly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I wrapped my forearms around the front of her face and Brad got his first good punch in. He came up under her tit and sent her nipple flying for her shoulders and she wheeled around fucking screaming in new found tit agony and threw me, the monkey,&nbsp; right off her back. She'd found jungle warrior strength.

Page 52.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Good shot. Fucking great aim.' 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I congratulated Brad on his precision. He knew not to punch her full frontal, like into her nipple, but up and under, to split all kinds of the fatty tissue against the ribs underneath. He knew a thing or two about what he'd fantasized about. He set his sights on another tit crusher but more to the top, over her heart and he was so focused he didn't even see the foot that hoofed his package. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He doubled over and staggered three steps and folded to the floor like a washed up boxer. She pounced like a demented she-lion and grabbed his head by the ear and tried to strangle him from behind. She was totally intent on killing my new found friend and that wasn't fair at all, not when our friendship was just in its infancy.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad clawed at her wrists trying to loosen her strangle hold and he wanted to cry 'uncle' but he couldn't so I didn't go for the gun.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I went for Beth instead.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I crashed into her, my knee smashing her back just above her tail bone. She really felt it but still didn't let up on murdering my friend and then I had a stroke of genius. I'd seen it in a movie called Closet Land, staring the eminently fuckable Madeleine Stowe and when the interrogator in the movie tortures Stowe, he does it so effectively.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I boxed her ears.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Closet Land

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A few words about this excellent torture movie with a first rate beautiful woman receiving the abuse.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The first eight minutes of Part 1, it is all just sound since Stowe is blindfolded so the screen is black.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For this finest example of sophisticated mental torture, pick up Part 3 at the three minute mark
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For an excellent example of her vagina being electric shocked, pick up Part 7 at the two minute mark.

Page 53.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I boxed Beth's ear drums.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Well you'd have thought I'd set dynamite off in them. The pop of air pressure smashed in on her drums and then smacked her brain and finally her balance center and she was so stunned, she froze and reeled at the same time. Brad was free and clutching his throat apple&nbsp; and he turned around and slugged Beth a good one to her heart tit for retaliation.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beth barely seemed to notice, her ear drums were ringing so loudly so I pulled out on her tit, hard from the nipple and he gave her a good well-aimed upper cut. I swear her tit bounced up to her eye level before it disapeared down to her navel. It surely gave new meaning to the notion of floppy tits.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You OK, Brad? Your throat OK?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Fuck yeah, but never mind about it, my balls, my fucking weapon, she got me good. Fuck does that hurt. She's gonna pay. The cunt's gonna pay. Her cunt, I want a shot at her cunt. A good clear one.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beth jolted out of her stupor when she heard them fighting words and she knew if they landed a decent cunt punch she'd probably pass out and how would she be when she came too? If she ever even did come too.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They had rendered her pretty well feral and she started to hiss. Long low bouts and fast little gulps and the steam seemed to be coming out of her flared nostrils.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She could not let Brad slug her vagina and was hell bent on distracting him and me.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But the thing was it was time for me to distract her. It was time for one of Brad's surprises.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When we'd first got control of them all, and they were secured, I'd checked the cottage out top to bottom. I didn't want any surprises and in the partial basement I'd come across a stack of old nylon fishing rods. Now they make the most fantastic whips for flaying women's flesh with. So I detached the reel assemblies from two of them and pulled all the line out. I'd stashed them in the closet of the room we were doing battle in. I slid the closet door open and yanked out the rods and tossed one to Brad.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'What's this for? Where'd you get these?'

Page 54.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Earlier, I found them in the basement. And they make great - watch.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I laced Beth across the calf. Her leg exploded on fire and she hopped up and down and further down. She was crouched over gripping her welt. It didn't take Brad two seconds to catch on. Monkey see, monkey do. (Sorry buddy, I know you're no ape.)
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His first swish caught her upper arm to the side and then she had two places she tried to hold onto at once and we both were making false wooshes at her and jabbing at her like we were fencing. This was a serious wrinkle and she couldn't get close enough to stop us. The rods were about eight feet long and I liked the logo on mine, Steelhead. Fucking right, and I was a pretty good aim with it too.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I poked at her eye and Brad poked at her clit and her arms wind-milled around, trying to keep the sharp tips away and then I saw the perfect arch. Her one arm was up defending her vision and the other one down trying to protect her crease and her tit was rounded out. My aim connected in a flash and the rod laced right across her nipple.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Well fuck and shit and fuck again, we both had to step back in awe, just to watch. You'd have thought I'd sliced it off. Her fingers clawed at her areola. She was sure her nipple was split, but unfortunately it wasn't. She basically bashed her own breast trying to get the pain to subside. She dropped to her knees, like how a building starts to fall when the demolition guys first set off the charges. Ever so slowly she sank and picked up momentum and then keeled over in a tight little fetal curl up full on the floor.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad and I looked at each other and smirked and were even a little bit elated. How could a woman cave in so beautifully, like gracefully, a ballet dancer, you might ask?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Enough?' We sort of implied to each other.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Naawhh. No fucking way. Not by a long shot and it'd certainly been a good shot, my nipple lace.

Page 55.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We both strolled over to her and knelt down and put our hands on her trembling body. I had her at the ass and he, to the side in line with her jugs. We tried to roll her onto her back but she resisted fiercely and was coiled into herself too tight to pry apart. Brad moved around to the top of her head and rubbed his pecker to her face. He wanted her to suck him off but she was in no mood.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I moved down and pulled up on one of her legs so her crotch was rightly exposed and accessible from behind. There were so many things I could have done to her at that moment, with her in that stretched position, but she never expected what she got.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And neither did Brad. It was the second one of his surprises.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of course she never saw it coming, never expected it. But she never saw me aiming it, she couldn't, not with Brad's pecker blocking her view.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beth had no idea that earlier I'd found her stun gun in her purse and I hadn't mentioned it to Brad either. I knew I wanted to thrill him by zapping one of them by surprise. I'd set it under the bed, to the bottom, not the top where our insurance hand gun was still waiting to save us, if need be, and the stunner was within easy reach. I buried the electrodes half up to her cervix and arced the fire. You could smell her pussy roast and sizzle and it was lucky Brad didn't have his knob in her mouth. She'd have bitten clear through it and off.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her hips exploded and she warped back into circular spirals.
Her legs were waving like flowers in the wind and her face was contorted beyond twisted.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I yanked the Taser out of her and tossed it to Brad.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Just jamb it into her tit and press the trigger.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was mechanically inclined and roasted her nipple with the white light in no time and now her arms convulsed in circles the same way her legs had started to do. It was a regular swaying garden. Fuck she almost could have flown, unassisted and wouldn't that be a turning point in history? Unaided human flight.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We both stood up.

Page 56.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Shit man, you're full of surprises. Fuck. Shit. Where'd you get that?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'One of their purses. I think it was hers.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'We sure made it hers, now didn't we.' Brad chuckled. Or it was more like chickled and ownership was ten tenths of the pain.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You smell that? You smell her cunt burn? You wanna fuck her?' I asked him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Are you nuts? You have to ask? Don't you?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Fucking right on. Let's say we do her together on the bed?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He didn't have to pause to react. He knew I had it just right.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We hoisted her up under her arm pits and propelled her onto the mattress. She wasn't much of a fighter now. Her canal was too seared.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Where do you want?' I asked him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Look Jim, you're the man. I wouldn't be here doing this if it wasn't for you, so you chose first. You're the man.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Fair enough. I fried her cunt so I'd like to fuck it too, sort of finish the measure. You wanna get in her asshole, first cummer?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad shoved so far up into her rectum that her turds got shoved back into her stomach and he gripped onto her jugs from behind. He flipped over onto his back and she was properly impaled and there was her pussy for the taking and I suppose I did a stupid thing, at least an unthinking thing.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I shoved the stun gun unto her and fried her again but the thing was some of the jolt got into Brad's bare wet pecker head. Well my buddy wasn't so up for that.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Stop. Stop. Stop. You're frying my cock. You're roasting it.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And his wasn't an Oscar Meyer weiner, by a long shot. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;More like a monster brat-worst.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brat-worse.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad-worst.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brat-worst.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Which was it?

Page 57.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I managed to get the lightning stopped and Brad's eyes were rolling around a bit but Beth's were positively spinning, like tops.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Can you hold it? Can you keep her stuck with your prick?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Yeah, but don't electrocute her cunt any more, at least not while my cock's in her ass.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You got it Pontiac. Can you hold it while I take the plunge?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He nodded and groaned at the same time he could.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I rode into Beth like a polo pony, swiping at her cunt walls and scored a good goal against her cervix. Then Brad and me got out thrusts synchronized and we rode her together, off into the sunset, like in the cheap porno movies.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She wasn't much conscious for most of it and certainly not for the cum quarts she got. We were both spent within ten minutes and within ten seconds of each other. Talk about stamina and timing and simultaneous orgasms.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We laid there after satiated, and like cuddling and I asked him, 'So, everything you expected?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I'm died and gone to heaven. I fucking swear it. I am. What next?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Well I suppose' I drew it out. 'We should get our meat out of her meat.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I hadn't had much of a go at her tits. Brad had clutched on to them so clamped&nbsp; and I wanted a little.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Let's roll her onto her side. I want to see if I can jizz her again.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Sure that's easy. Whatever. You think you got it in you?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'We'll soon find out. In me to put in her.' We both laughed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was out of her anus wiping his pecker across Julie's face and I was getting primed to pump Beth again.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Brad, give me the stunner.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Uh? What?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'The stun gun, give it to me. I want to feel what you felt.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Oh sit man, no you don't. It fucking hurt, like my testicles were boiling.'

Page 58.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Yeah, but you're still standing, so I wanna see.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'OK. Sure OK, if you're that perverted.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You don't know the fraction of it, this is fucking nothing yet.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad literally beamed. He just knew he was in for the best period of his entire life and he was giddy with appreciation.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He handed me the slippery, well juiced gun and I could see right off, I needed his assistance.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'OK, time to get up close and personal. I want you to help.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'OK, what? How?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I'm going to pump her. I can do her again. I've still got a good half load and when I say, just as I'm set to cum, I want you to zap her just below where I've gone into her. Give her a good long blast as I blast my spunk into her.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Oh shit Jim, shit man, I never. Nobody ever. God, fucking never.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I started to pump and grind and pinched Beth's nipples like they were flies I was trying to kill and after about five minutes I could feel the squirt load collecting. I measured my thrusts and as the load started to travel, Brad got the word.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are almost no words, ineffable, that's what it was, to describe what happened next. The sperm wanted to go back the way it'd come (cum) but the male body isn't designed for that. The physiology thing and all that. The juice was boiling hot as it leapt forth from my dick head's eye and it burned my own pisser hole and then it burned her fucking fuck hole. I wasn't sure if I'd had an orgasm or a reverse one. Both our hips went into simultaneous convulsions and she near tore my shaft off at the top, where it joined up with my pubic hair. I'm pretty sure my sack would have come off along besides.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beth convulsed and twitched for another few minutes and I stayed in her for every arch and spasm. She was fucking my cock again and I didn't even have to move. It was like she was in charge of the action but she wasn't. It was only from the charge discharge.

Page 59.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She should of just pretended to be dead.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since she seemed to want to go again, I had to bang fuck her and I got pumping. I had to ram fuck her to give her the regular sperm juice and Brad was almost stunned at my stamina and ferocity. I hadn't really opened up my throttle with him there yet, but now I didn't give a shit. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was just Beth and me and I owed her my best master fuck. I'm not sure she'd sensed I'd been holding back but she sure knew it then. I near busted her pubic bone by bashing mine against hers and I dislodged her cervix at the other end of her fried fuck canal. It got tore open to one side, clean. I'd say, it was an air-crash shattering, earth-shattering, clit-shattering moment.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I yanked out of her and wailed on her pussy. I pummeled her labia and sent my knuckles smashing into it's delicate balance. It was like I was trying to kill her by murdering her cunt and Brad was near almost in awe. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The thing with him was, and it was such a big thing, he knew he never had to hold back (again) in front of me or ever. He'd wanted to chew on a clit, like a vampire would, but felt embarrassed and self-conscious about doing it, but not the fuck anymore. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He charged over to Julie, knocked her flying sideways off her chair and buried his teeth into her pussy. He growled and grunted and twisted and shook his face and finally came up for air, blood, lots of clit blood dripping from his noble chin and a little piece of sponge meat stuck between his teeth hanging out.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Julie has shrieked unconscious at his first taste.
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He looked a sight, a majestic monster and we both knew for certain then, destiny had bound us together.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If that was his idea of eating a woman out, where the fuck had he been all my life?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In Australia, I presumed. Otherwise we'd have met and hooked up much sooner.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hat's off to you, and you're not even Larry.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hats off to Brad.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The master muncher.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We were winding down but still had one item of business before us. The matter of them choosing who was going to die.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The three of them comprised a pretty banged up bunch and we'd taken a few lumps too. Brad's scrotum was still bruised and tender and I had a headache from all Beth's hollering which I supposed was on a par with a hang nail in the scheme of injury levels in that one room.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was time for him and me to get out away from them for a bit. We needed a break from all the gore and bodily fluids and besides we were plenty hungry. I don't know in the exercise guidelines how many calories burned would be attributed to a healthy rape and rape lifestyle, but it had to be quite a few since it was such a good work-out exhausting lots of energy.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After clearing the doorway of the chairs and the cunts that were tied to them, we headed out for the kitchen.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Neither one of us was saying much and I wasn't sure if Brad just didn't feel talkative or if he was fussed a bit at the prospect of one of them dying soon. He liked all three of them equally then and didn't see the need to eliminate one third of our supply.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was almost as if I could read his mind.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So, when do you want them to chose the victim?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Are you really going to make them do that? Chose one to die?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You don't want to?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'It's not that. It's just too soon to get rid of one, you know what I mean. Right now we can each be torturing one and there's still another one watching and waiting in the wings. Doesn't that make your pecker want to sing? Knowing the other one has to watch and know she'll be getting the same any time soon?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I never thought of it that way.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Yeah, well I know I do. I mean three cunts are better than two, any day of the week. I mean there was a time, a very short time ago I would have thought it a miracle to have just one cunt to bugger and now we're talking about throwing one away. It doesn't fit for me. And by the way, how long are we going to keep them? I never asked you that?'

Page 61.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Day of the week, you said. How about month of the year. That sounds better.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'No fucking shit? A month?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Or more, no reason not to.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Fuck, my cock might break or at least wear out. Where's the Viagra. You got any?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Don't need it. We take our time. We set things up and even take rests. It's not all as intense as to-day, fuck, we'd burn ourselves out to say nothing of them. We have to give them time to heal and adjust and accept and, of course, clean them up to keep them attractive. And rest and eat, all that regular day to day minutiae. It's just that they get tortured and raped in the intervals.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'God, I never thought I'd live to see the days and nights when I lived out those fantasies of mine, but here it is and here we are, so I've got a better idea.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Shoot.' I invited his idea.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Yeah, we do it. We make them chose one of their own to die. Talk about the power, the control. But she's just the one to die first. Like you said, we'd kill them all eventually, so even though we mislead them to think we're going to kill the chosen one before we leave here to transport the remaining ones, we don't actually do it. And then when the real killing begins, we start with the loser. That work for you?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I gave him a big hug across his broad shoulders, as we were fixing ourselves up some viddles and I joked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You mean we actually lie to them? Like it wasn't a mortal sin? Thou shall not lie. Thou shall not kill. But I suppose there is nothing about, Thou shalt not lie about killing.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We both laughed and appreciated my reasoning and became agreed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So, that's it then, we put them through the process but delay the results.' Brad reiterated.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Sounds like a devious plan to me. After you.' I enthused.

Page 62.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We'd scarfed down a couple of egg salad sandwiches on brown and a quart of milk each. So wasn't that just a coincidence too? Two grown men who still loved milk. It was my favorite drink of choice and I even liked it chocolate better. When ever I was out on a date, like a regular one at a restaurant, or setting some woman up, and we ordered coffee and chocolate milk, the waitress invariably presumed I'd be getting the coffee and the lady the brown milk. Even sexual stereotyping took place at that innocuous level. Anyhow, what the fuck did it matter?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It's just that a guy who ordered brown milk, how dangerous could he be since it was a kid's drink?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We were going to fry their brains and their friendships, but just not one of them until later.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad was a genius, a sexual sadist genie and he was out of his bottle and almost out of his gourd with happiness. He'd never felt so well adjusted and at peace with himself and I knew exactly how he felt. It was when I fought my impulses that I felt the most agitated and out of harmony with my nature so finally I'd just stopped the internal struggle and relinquished my will to my inner beast. Then everything smoothed out and ran well in my life.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then I ran into Brad and everything ran a whole lot smoother and I'd have to say the harmonization and the buddy system agreed with my aspirations. It just made it easier to perform and I could watch a woman being attacked without having to do it all myself.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'How are we going to work them into choosing one?' He asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad wasn't so sure about what approach might have a chance of working. I had quite a few good ideas since I'd done a number of mothers and daughters plus other multiples.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You'll see my friend. You'll see.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was time to re-assemble them for the selection process. We decided to ferret them out of the bedroom we'd all occupied for the last several fleeting hours and re-collect them in the living room. It was spacious and quite rustic and we wanted to play our mind games with them in comfort.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was a long brown leather couch that would accommodate them nicely so we hustled and muscled them into place how we wanted them arranged. We wanted Beth in the middle because, even though she'd really taken a shit kicking and licking,&nbsp; she was still the strongest and the authority figure for the other two. She knew she was their mentor, and in this most difficult circumstance, we wanted her to assume her natural leadership role again.

Page 63.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We had Sally to her right and her cunt was still all sewn up and funny thing, it hardly hurt anymore and to boot, it'd saved her from being vaginally penetrated while her friends were being wonked in a variety of evil manners.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Julia settled in on Beth's left and we were pretty well good to go.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad and me pulled up a couple of comfortable easy chairs about eight feet back from our cabal and were all set to play the lord and the master.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They were sitting stiff and uneasy and kept looking down to the floor, but not at each other and certainly not at us.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So, you know why we're here then? You know why you're here?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My friend and I'd found a big bag of chips and we were munching away as we passed the snack back and forth. I waited a couple of minutes and then tried again.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Come on, somebody speak up. Somebody say something.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As to be expected, Beth broke the tension.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'We want you to let us go. You've done enough to us here and we don't want to be transported to somewhere else. You've had your fun and you've hurt us and assaulted us, so let us go. Just let us go, please.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was pretty well a standard plea, with not much of the bargaining, and close to what I'd expected, from my previous experiences with women pleading for their initial freedom.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Please. At least you know how to say please. You two feel the same way?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Julie looked up sadly and nodded and Sally was preoccupied with looking at the stitches in her labia. They were making her itchy but she dared not scratch herself there, in front of us.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'What about you Sally, honey, you feel that way too?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Yes, of course, I do. You don't even have to ask.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Yeah, I guess you're right. What do you think Brad? Did I have to ask?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'She's mouthy still, isn't she? Maybe she needs some stitches in her other lips too, besides in her cunt, or maybe we should just cut her tongue out and see how she wags it then.'

Page 64.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Sally, I think you better tone it down a notch or two, my friend here, he's got some new ideas. Some crazy ideas I don't think you want to hear about. You think you can do that?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She nodded meekly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So, anyway Beth, I know you're serious but you can't think that we'll take you seriously, like in any way grant your request.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She simply looked at me more defiant, then for quite awhile. I don't know if she praying or plotting but neither one was doing her much good. I let her have her meditation for a few minutes.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So, why don't we get on with it?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Again that increased, more intense, pregnant avoidance silence hung like magic in the air.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Ladies, I want one of you at least to tell us, to tell me, why you're here?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Julie started to say a little and Beth shot her a look. It was like they had some unwritten pact, and now one was about to break it. The first crack in the armor or chink in the wall.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'No, go ahead, Julie. Pay no attention to her. What were you going to say?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Julie was so nervous, afraid and pent up she just had to spill it all out.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You said we had to chose one of us to not go with the others, that you were going to..'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And she choked on the word at that point in their sentence.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'That I was going to? No, that's not right. Don't forget my friend here. It's that we're going to.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beth stepped right up assertive and in control.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'If you think you're going to get us to turn on each other, to chose one of us to die, you're sadly and grossly mistaken. We're good friends. deep friends and we'll never do that.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So, I suppose I don't have to ask you two if you agree?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They both nodded their heads but Julie was a little less indicative of it than Sally. I suspected she was the weak kneed link and that would play out just perfect,
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was just waiting for Beth to proclaim it'd be all or none. They'd all volunteer to die but not one of them alone. Not one would point the finger at any other one alone. She wasn't one to disappoint for long.

Page 65.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'We'll never turn on each other, so if you're going to kill one of us you'll have to kill all of us.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'That's OK then.' I replied.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I got up with my little handgun pointed right at her head. I'd had it waving in their general directions as we'd been getting the non-debate going and between taking hand fulls of chips to munch.  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The chips were all gone and so was Beth's life just about.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her friends cringed away, to the back of the couch, but Beth held her defiance.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So, if it's going to be all three of you, you're volunteering to go first? Have I got that right?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The gun barrel was square between her flaming eyes.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Just nod, I'm right, and I can shoot your lights out right now.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As much as she wanted to be noble and a hero-ine, she couldn't bring herself to suicide by gesture. I let the gun drift down to her crotch and was barely parting her labia lips with the barrel tip.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Come on, fucking come on.' I barked so sharply she jumped away and pissed herself all over their nice clean couch. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So, what the fuck you pig. You sloppy cunt, what's that all about?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You scared me. You're scaring me. Please don't. Just don't.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So here's the thing, if I shoot you now, it'll hurt but it won't kill you and it's the best offer you're gonna get, isn't that right Brad?' He had been sort of feeling left out.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You listen to him cunt. If he shoots you in the cunt, if you tell him to, then you don't die. Anywhere else and you're history.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I hadn't even had to coach him to finish my thoughts, he was such a natural born interrogator and terrorizer.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beth squirmed and tried to muster an ounce of strength and dignity but could not bring herself to get cunt shot. She wasn't sure if it would be lethal or not. She supposed it depended where the bullet ended up and its trajectory through her insides. But she was pretty sure it'd hurt too much to bear and finally she just blurted out a big held-in sob and looked embarrassed at her weakness and having a gun tickling her clit. She wasn't one to snivel. She'd never done it in her entire life and now she was crashing pretty close to doing it. She hated herself for her apparent weakness but the heart wants what the heart wants, and hers wanted to go on beating. I put my hand sort of softly to her tear stained cheek and shoved her head back meanly.

Page 66.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Fucking pussy wuss. You're a big fucking disappointment. I should shoot you for just being such a big let down, and to your friends too. Don't you think you're letting them down too?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She blubbered, 'I don't see how?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'How? How? You don't see how? You stupid cunt, if you'd taken a bullet in yours, nobody would have to have died. But no, oh no, you're a big fucking chicken so now one still does. Fucking cry baby. Fucking slacker.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I smacked her cheek and sat back down eight feet away from her ridicule. The others seemed upset with her, like they wished she'd been shot, even if it was in the genitals. And so, as was always the case, eventually, the first cracks were appearing, and it wasn't their cunt nor bum cracks.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'What do you think she should have done?' I motioned to Brad.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'She should have agreed, fucking right. What's the big deal about having another hole in her cunt? And a little blood and pain? Fucking right she should have agreed but it's too late for that. Only one chance she had, so we better leave them alone for awhile so they can work it through. I think us sitting here intimidates and inhibits them. Don't you think?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'That could well be right. That's a good idea. So ladies, we have an errand, we have to get out of the way, so why don't we leave you here alone for awhile and you can hash it out. We'll have to tie you to the couch, but that won't take too much doing. So what do you say?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Any opportunity to have us out of their presence, and possibly effect an escape, was a blessing as far as they could see ahead.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Oh, by the way, you'd better use the time to work out your choice because we can see you through the picture window and if we see you're struggling, trying to get free, and not discussing your plight, it's game over. It's all over then and there'll be no more need for you to discuss anything. You get my meaning?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They were adamant in their refusal to accept, but they understood.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So that's it then. We'll be watching you from outside, every so often, so talk up a storm.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We fixed them to the couch with long cutting pieces of thin nylon cord and it hurt to try to pull too hard against it and we loved looping the line arounf their necks while kissing them and copping copius tit feels and a few cunt sliders. We were done and ready for our grand exit. 

Page 67.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As we headed away, Brad got to rooting around in the bedrooms and it looked as if two of them shared one room and the other one was off by herself.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I wandered off for a piss.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He went into their closets and dressers and in the latter there was quite an array of under-things plus some marital aids still in their original boxes. I supposed that was the proper name for them, but fucking jerk off shit, that was more to my liking.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Somebody was a neat freak.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There were a couple of non-descript vibrators, but it was the dildos that showed some imagination.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was the Clingon Glass Probe

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Visit:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://www.vibrator.com/sex-toys/clingon-glass-probe.html

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And the Colt ten inch super cock. I loved a dildo being named after a gun

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Visit:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://www.thegoodiesack.net/product.sc?categoryId=3&amp;productId=735

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And another was the Manhandler, ten inch insertable length with a police baton style handle.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Visit:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://www.thegoodiesack.net/product.sc?categoryId=3&amp;productId=693

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Somebody really had a thing for dildos.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The one that really fascinated him was the Clingon Glass Probe and it looked expensive being made out of glass and all. It was a two pronged affair that had a cock head for the cunt and a tapered appendage for the anus.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who and how did one of them (or more) use that?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I just had to see but that was only after he came running to me all excited.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You have to see. You have to fucking see what I found.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I traipsed after him into the middle bedroom&nbsp; and he'd strewn the bras and panties all over the floor with nary a thought to tidiness or good house keeping. I loved woman's underwear, the look and the feel of it and I loved even more to wear it. Some would call it cross-dressing , but for me, it wasn't that at all. What it was, was standing there talking to, sizing up a potential beautiful victim knowing all the time my boner was in silk panties and a sweet bra cradled my nipples and knowing even better that if she was selected,&nbsp; when she became my eventual guest and victim I'd wear the underwear she had on when I captured her right in front of her. That always&nbsp; freaked them, seeing a boner sticking out of a leg hole of their knickers.

Page 68.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad was enthused as he tripped the switches to make the vibrators go, first one and then the other and then both at once like a two-handed gun-slinger as he pointed them at me and then to his crotch. It was childish but amusing to watch, but I was more fascinated about the two holer.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Fuck, man. You ever see one like this? And all glass?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He hadn't either.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I wonder whose it is? Who gets her rocks off with this?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Why don't we find out? Why don't we watch while she does it?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Some ideas are just so perfect, it was like it was in the natural order that their time should come. I supposed some called it - what was meant to be, like destiny or doom. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I just called it fucking great hulking luck.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We hauled the stash to the living room where they were all lined up, like ducks in a row, only chicks in a row, on the couch and we started to make fun of the paraphernalia. He zapped the vibrators in front of their faces and poked at their cunts and I fixated on the glass double banger.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So ladies, we didn't expect to be back so soon but we found something. So, ladies, whose is this?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No one wanted to answer and they all looked guilty. It almost seemed as if it'd been in all of their holes, two at a time.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'What? No owner? No one to claim it?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They were adamant, but someone got it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'OK, let's try again. Like who the fuck bought it then? Let's try&nbsp; that on for size, ha ha. Never mind who uses it, who fucking got it?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Still no real acknowledgement but Sally gave a flicker of guilt. She didn't think I saw but I saw everything, especially the endless possibilities for its use.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'OK, last fucking time and no more fucking around or we'll try it out on all of you. Whose the fuck is it?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I knew I'd seen it and I was dead right. Sally owned up.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She nodded meekly and looked sheepish.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So? It special for you? You bought the others too?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Just one vibrator, the pinkish one.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Pink for girls?' I joked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What a lame cliche.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Pink for the pink.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That wasn't so lame and she was disgusted since it was almost the same shade as her vaginal interior and it would take me to notice it and make stupid jokes about it.

Page 69.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So how abouts you give us a demonstration?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sally looked coiled and reeled back.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He and I smirked at each other, knowing Brad had had such a great idea.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I went behind her and corralled her head into my arms and hugged her face. I kissed her to the side of the head and twisted forward to kiss her lips. She resented that more than me pinching on her hardening nipples.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I whispered in her ear. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So sweet thing, you gonna show us or we have to show you?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was all tense and twisted inside. It would be humiliating and degrading and she wanted to shatter the glass thing into bits.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I rubbed it to the side of her face and guided it around to slip into her mouth. She scratched her teeth across it as I slid it back and forth.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was on the end of the couch so I easily took hold of her hair and pulled her to the side and then off the couch to the floor in front. She was like a reluctant puppy on a leash, not yet trained to obey. I pulled her along and down until she was pretty well laying flat on the floor in front of her audience.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad had the gun and knew to point it at her without being told.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I held our knife up high for all to see and cut the ties that bound her and then passed her the Glass Probe.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She didn't want it but had to take it but wouldn't look at it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Anytime you're ready, we're ready.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I could see she was struggling with a little plan she'd hatched but she couldn't decide whether or not to risk it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She got herself up onto her knees with them spread and I could see in a flash she intended to throw it, and not insert it, in the hopes of shattering it. She wound her arm back and just as she went to snap it forward like a baseball pitcher, I snagged her wrist and held it fast, way back of her head.

Page 70.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You stupid fucking cunt, what do you think you're doing? Trying to do?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She struggled and strained to break free her hand, to still toss it, but I twisted it out of her grip and handed it off to Brad.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was safe but she sure as fuck wasn't.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I got my foot dead center into her back and shoved her forward with a mighty heave. She pancaked to the floor and tried to twist around to fend of any further blows she assumed were coming. Normally I would have rained a few on her but there was no need. I had a better idea.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I hiked over to Beth and bounced her onto the floor beside Sally. Brad handed me the gun as I held my hand out for it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I stuck it under Beth's wagging chin.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'We're gonna cut you lose and you're gonna do her. You fucking plug both her holes at once.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now Sally was pissed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'No. No, give it here. I'll do it. I'll do it myself. I'll do it to myself.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Too fucking late for that, cunt. You had your chance. Now it's her turn.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Just try something when I cut your wrists loose and see where this knife ends up and where a bullet end up. You get my drift?' I addressed it to Beth.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She nodded and Brad cut the wrist cord and offered her the double dildo.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We could tell she'd had it in her hands before.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She touched her gently to assume a doggy position and Sally crawled around onto all fours and then set her chest and face to the floor so her ass and cunt labia were high to the ceiling. Beth approached her all expectant and asked us for, 'There's some lubricant. There was some in the drawer with.. Did you find it?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We hadn't really looked for it and it'd slipped our attention.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'No we didn't.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Well please find it. I need it. She needs it.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad went to trundle off to retrieve it.

Page 71.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Hold it. Hold on.' I advised him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'What? I was going to find it.' He was almost defensive.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'No, we don't need it. She doesn't need it.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Everyone looked sort of puzzled, especially the two participants, so I cleared up the riddle.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Stick you thumb, you fingers into her cunt and get her wet. Massage her. Fucking get her squirting like a river and then use it to lubricate her anus. Smear it all over and inside her pucker.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beth was about to rebel and started to ignore my instructions and aimed the double banger at her to stick it in dry.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You fucking have a hearing problem? Do what I fucking say, or we'll have her do it to you.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That was an idea she liked even less.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her thumb slid back and forth pressuring her clit and she twisted her index finger along just inside her labia. It looked as if they'd done each other before.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It didn't take that long for her thumb to glisten with slime and she applied it, like garnishment, to her anus.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And the crazy thing was Sally didn't mind all that much. Beth knew how to handle her so it was exciting her and she tried to hide her satisfied little groans.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad and I looked right at each other, like wow.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Just imagine when she pumps her with the thing.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And that was the next order of Beth's business. She guided the longer appendage into Sally's cunt from behind and got her nicely skewered and then she butt plugged her with the other arm.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She got up onto her knees and started to thrust and pull back on the device while gyrating it a little in circles. Sally's sweet ass circled too and she rocked back and forth making her hang-down tits jiggle and rock and roll. That was becoming too much for me to bear, or at least ignore.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We left Beth to her pumping for a good five minutes and Sally groaned and wiggled her ass to grab more pleasure out of what was being done to her. She'd give little contrary thrusts to increase the clitoral contact and she was in rhythm with Beth's techniques. I'd fucking had enough. I couldn't stand watching her tits like pendulums screaming out to me for attention.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Calling out to my foot.

Page 72.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was a total distraction and no one saw it coming.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Not even Brad expected it and her bouncing tits were turning him on too.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I kicked her like a football player looking for a field goal from fifty yards and her chest flew up, a tit cracked against her rib, and she sprung straight out along the floor and Beth had to yank the dildo out of her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beth screamed out. 'What'd you do that for? God. For God's sake, I was doing what you asked. You didn't have to kick her like that.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad could see there was a similar opportunity in the midst of it all.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He came at Beth from the side and caught her a sweet boot almost to her nipple.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We both piled onto them, me on mine and Brad on his, and we smacked at their heads and roughed them up and Brad latched onto the glass probe and double banged Beth. He was ramming at her like a billy-goat trying to bust down a door and I supposed that's what he was up to. Trying to bust into her cervix, the door to her womb.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was a bit of a melee, but fantastic confusion as they tried to scare us away from the gratuitous assault with their penetrating screams and objections. We were up for a good wresting match and kept at them for ten minutes before out strength and ardor started to wane. I knocked Sally out first with a temple punch and Brad followed shortly with a gut punch and then a pussy smash to Beth.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We were both tired and got them re-tied and hoisted back up onto the couch to join Julie who had stayed opportunistically silent thorough out the whole episode. Like she might be able to avoid being included it she kept the fuck shut up.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I poked the dildo to her lips and let her know.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Your turn's coming. You can be fucking sure. Your turn's coming.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We left it on the couch on her lap and headed off to the kitchen to find something to eat. We weren't just winded, we were calorie starved and needed a good shot more of energy. We were only just begun, as the song goes, and we needed to rest up for at least ten minutes. We probably needed half an hour but our patience would only span a third of that time. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And then we had other timely decisions to make.

Page 73.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You still have to decide who's going to be shot. Remember what I said before? You'd better use the time to work out your choice because we can see you through the window and if we see you're struggling, trying to get free, it's game over. It's all over then and there'll be no more need for you to discuss anything. You still get my meaning?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Even after the glass dildo they were still adamant in their refusal to accept, but they understood.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So that's it then. We'll be watching you from outside, every so often, so talk up a storm.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Again we fixed them to the couch with the long cutting pieces of thin nylon cord and it hurt to try to pull too hard against it and we loved looping the line around their necks while kissing them and copping copious tit feels and a few cunt sliders. We were done again and ready for our grand exit. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The thing was, sometimes a small investment can yield oodles of fun and enjoyment. And technology was creating the most wonderful of capabilities, things that were strictly CIA stuff, like James Bond stuff, were now available to the average schlub and it didn't even cost that much any more.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I had the most marvellous listening device for hearing conversations from a distance, like from even across the road and it'd play through a recording device so we could both record what was being said while we heard it in real time.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Visit:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://www.rkdm.com/listening/

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We were going to be flies on the wall during their deliberations and they wouldn't even think we were inside the cottage still with them. We scooted out of the room and I'd told Brad already what the play book called for. He zipped out side and made a big deal about starting their car, revving the engine and all and pulling it into the garage.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While he was out doing that, I pulled up the other two kitchen chairs just out of sight where the hall spilled into the living room, or was that the dying room, where they were. The first two chairs were sort of bent up from all the violence that went on in the bedroom. I had my gadget all at the ready and it's tail was wagging straight up waiting for some action and to hear a tale to tell and it was incredibly delicious. Right away Beth started to struggle with her bindings and Sally spoke up.

Page 74.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You better stop that. You heard what he threatened. He said if he saw us, and I assume that meant any one of us, it'd be all over. So please stop it.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beth defended herself. 'We have to get free. This may be our only chance we have to get free. God damn it, don't you want to get free?' She was trying to ignite them, like incite them.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Of course we do.' Julie defended Sally. 'But the ropes, the cords, they're already cutting into me. He tied me across my breasts and it hurts, so please don't struggle so much. It hurts more when you do.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Me too.' Sally said. 'He has it buried into the stitches in the crease of my vagina and he was mean about it. I don't know who's worse, the Brad guy or the old guy.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now my ears perked up. I hoped they picked up and stayed with the thread.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I think you have to watch the old guy. There's something deeply sinister about him. He seems placid but there's a rage burning in him and he tries to keep it hidden and in-check, but it's there and if it ever comes out in all its furry, I'm sure he will kill us or at least one of us.' 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beth had pontificated about my soul and it wasn't that I didn't appreciate her opinions it was just that I was never angry at any of them. I supposed that's what made me so lethal. I was at peace with all my exploits.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You don't think he will otherwise?' Sally seemed hopeful. 'You think this could just be idle threatening?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I don't.' Julie observed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This was so fucking great. They were getting into the talking and passing on the wriggling trying to escape.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They seemed startled, and were thankful they were placid, when Brad rapped loudly on the outside of the picture window and waved at them all friendly. They hadn't been caught disobeying, but now couldn't be sure when and if he'd do it again so escaping faded right into the background, I believe they called it 'fade to black' in the movie scripts. Brad had snuck back in and was sitting quietly on his chair beside me and could hear their deliberations too. It'd been a brief tiny interval since they'd started on about who was the most dangerous of the two of us, so they were still on the topic.

Page 75.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Julie questioned, 'Brad, does he sound Australian to you?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beth offered, 'A little I guess, but not a lot.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sally offered more, 'He's a long way from home to be doing this, if he is and I think you're wrong. He's as dangerous as the other one. I don't think he's had the experience of him and so he has a lot more saved up that he's never tried, so I think we, you really have to watch out for him. He's a sleeper and they can be the most unpredicatble.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Yeah, it was his idea to sew you up, wasn't it? And he really seemed to love it. Are you OK, Sally? How bad does it hurt?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Not now. Not so much. Just when he did it, but I thought he was going to drive the needle and thread my clitoris, but he didn't so it doesn't hurt that much now. But I don't think they've known each other very long. Remember the restaurant, when we were cutting up? He was the other guy. Brad, the young guy, he was the other one we teased&nbsp; and they weren't sitting together but when we came out of the ladies room, they were both gone. I remember, because I was going to hit the other guy over the head with his paper to give it back to him. But he wasn't there and neither was the other one.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You know, now that I think of it, you're right. That is what happened.' Beth confirmed Julie's memories.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sally picked it up, 'If they've just gotten together, they must have followed us to find where we're staying and then planned all this. They plotted and planned and now they want us to do the same. What are we going to do? And what are they up to now? Do you think they're listening?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They went all quiet to listen for us listening and I handed Brad the eavesdropping device and skipped outside quietly to rap on the window like he had done, maybe about twenty minutes before. We were losing track of time it all was so riveting and enjoyable.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They looked startled again and craned to see through the reflections in the glass. Which one of us was it now? They relaxed because they weren't fighting their restraints and I was back beside Brad, like I'd never left. It set them at ease about us listening.

Page 76.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad whispered in my ear, 'They're talking about it.' And he sort of gave a little juvenile tee tee giggle. 'They're talking about dying.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Oh great. Oh fucking great, the payoff was there.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beth was leading the speculation again. 'I don't think they intend to kill any of us and certainly not here.They can have too much fun hurting and raping us and look what he did to Sally. I think they're just trying to freak with our minds and our spirits, like the ultimate control.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I liked that, freak with their minds, as well as fuck with them.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So what if you're wrong?' Julie asked. 'What if they come back in and demand to know which one? What do we do then?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'We all volunteer. That's the only thing we can do and that throws it back to them and we haven't turned on each other which is what they want.' Beth stated categorically.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Geeze was she just too too smart for her own good and the goods of the others?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sally wasn't quite so convinced and was worried. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'What if that doesn't work? It won't work? What if they demand a choice, a clear one be made? What do we do then? They kill all three of us instead of just one?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Just. Just one? Just?' Beth exploded. 'Do you hear yourself? That's exactly what they want, for two of us to think that it's just one of us, the other one is just one.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'No, no, I'm sorry. I didn't mean that. But should three of us die instead of one? If two can be saved, shouldn't we explore those possibilities as well, that possibility?' Sally defended herself.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'How are we going to do that?' Beth demanded. 'Tell me how? How? What's reasonable about that?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'We should arrive at a decision. We should use some kind of reasoning or some kind of chance and arrive at a..' Julie got cut off by Beth.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Victim. You want us to name one of us as victim? I won't do it. I won't be a part of it. No, I refuse.' Beth was pissed and about to be a little self-righteous masquerading her self-interest.

Page 77.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'But if there's no choice, wouldn't that be better?' Julie asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Well you've obviously got something in mind and you must think it wouldn't be you or you wouldn't be talking this way.' Beth was approaching hostile. They were starting to fight.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Julie continued. 'I guess I do. In a way, Sally started it all. If she hadn't insulted that first guy and had just not been so mean..'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sally cut in, 'I don't believe it. You want to blame me? You want to sacrifice me so you can stay alive? You stole his fucking paper. Why did you do that, if not to show off? He said you owed him for the paper so if you hadn't done that he might just have let it go. But no, you were the big&nbsp; mouth so you're just as much to blame as I am.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beth could see her chance to gain a bit of leverage.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I didn't do any of it. I never interacted with either of them.' 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As if that somehow made her superior and entitled to some luck which shouldn't be directed their ways.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They both looked at her and sort of glared. Of course, she was right, so if someone had to be picked, it shouldn't be her which narrowed it down to two. Now they weren't so anxious to continue the debate as the odds had been considerably narrowed, fully by a third.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'This isn't getting us anywhere. We have to think of something else.' Of course, it was Sally seeing it that way then.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'How about chance? What about pure luck. What if we have them flip a coin to eliminate and decide it?' That was Julie's idea.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'No, I don't think they'd go for that. They want us to decide. That's part of their game and power.' Sally replied.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'OK, so we do it by chance then.' Julie said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'How? How can we?' Back from Sally.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beth was conspicuously not a part of their exchanges.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She wasn't so agreeable to that. She figured she had a right to be left off the high stakes gambling table and balked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I said I didn't start any of this so you two should decide. Just one of you two.'

Page 78.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Beth, that's not fair. We're in this together. You said so yourself, before.' Sally was really irked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'That's just my point. We wouldn't be in this together if you two hadn't antagonized them. You weren't satisfied with taunting just one guy, you had to go two for two and now the two of them are together. That's what I'm saying. You were probably the catalyst for them hooking up at all.' Beth reasoned well with her sharp insight.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So that's what you're saying too? You won't be part of any discussion based on chance?' Julie repeated Beth's position.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Yes, that's right. I won't. I don't deserve to be.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Deserve? Well neither do we. None of us deserves this. So what else can we do?' Sally was indignant but conciliatory.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Nothing. We do nothing and let them play it out. Put it back in their court and we do nothing. Don't you see what's happening? Just what they want and we can't give them that power and satisfaction. So let's agree. Please let's swear, we don't play their game.' Beth had resumed her mentor role and they were relieved she hadn't become their enemy.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They mumbled their oaths to each other and then they all fell silent, to review their prospective positions.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With nothing else to hear or record it was time to go back in to visit them.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Both our cocks were little wiry wiggles and a bit wonky and we almost wanted to blurt out laughing as we occupied our judgement-day thrones awaiting our return in front of them.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We were joined at the penis.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And those heads could talk to each other without words.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Everyone looked at everyone else but no one saw anything, at least they didn't.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'OK. Decision time.' I said with authority but no levity which I was feeling inside. 'Who's the lucky cunt?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Lucky?' Beth muttered.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You betcha. She doesn't get to go to our house of horrors. Her ordeal ends right here.' I teased her.

Page 79.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They looked startled at each other, like none of their speculations had been the least bit accurate.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So, so give us a name.' Brad enthused.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then the really afraid parts of them all wanted to volunteer. What if it was true? The lucky one would be the dead one? The thing was though, the thought of the uncertainty was so much more&nbsp;&nbsp; an obstruction than the knowing of it. Their hope and God beliefs, that their prayers had to be heard, got in the way of their analytical appraisals of what was and what was likely and they couldn't beg to die at that moment. They couldn't bring themselves to say the words.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Shit, I don't believe this. We've given you all the time in the world and been completely reasonable with you and still no answer. Perhaps we need to talk to you one on one and see if that makes a difference.' Brad had come up with that on his own so as I said we were fused at the prick. 'What do you think of that, Jim?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Fucking right. That should work, like do it.' And I was enthusiastic and supportive. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They did not want to be divided, like divided and conquered, but that was of no consequence to us. We cut Sally first out of the pack and got her cords loose and re-secured the others and trundled her off down the hall by her lonely self. With our out dicks following along behind her, we had to shove her and prod her to keep on walking forward, sometimes even with our boners. She so wanted to reverse, to get back to her allies, but finally we propelled her into the bedroom where all the previous action had taken place. And locked the door shut behind us.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She stood there all trembling and swaying, like an innocent little red riding hood and the wolves were already in her house, in her bedroom, slobbering from their grinning chins. Before we talked, she knew she was going to get raped. She could smell our peckers getting ready so this wasn't going to be the civilized reasoned discourse she'd hoped for. She'd wanted to plead her case and maybe get an edge up on the other two but now she'd just be pleading for her cunt, which by the way was still all sewn up.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We maneuvered her towards the bed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Listen. Please listen.'

Page 80.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We started to take our clothes off again. We'd put them back on so that we weren't running around outside naked, as it might raise some suspicions. Our flies had been opened for our boners to jut out of.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'No. No, stop please. I have to talk to you. That's what we're supposed to be doing.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I'll tell you what, we'll tell you what, the one who fucks the worst, she gets to live.' I advised her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'The worst? You mean the best?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'No stupid, I say what I mean. The worst. Any woman can fuck great when her life depends on it, but how does she fuck badly. No, no, the worst.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'But no, I don't know how. That's nuts.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'And it'll soon be our nuts, look at these.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We both proudly fondled our erect peckers and shook them at her like we were pointing and wagging our index fingers.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad asked me politely, 'You want the ass or the cunt? We do her at once?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'No, God no, not together. Please not like Julie. Not together again.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I started to sing that line of the song. 'Together again. Together again.' And my voice wasn't half bad. Maybe even an American Idol contender except I was way too old. Talk about age discrimination.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Visit:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=zY7eu-tGyZg

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She rolled of the bed and made a bolt for the door. Brad intercepted her and swung her around by an arm and I gave her a nice little pop right between her tits in the hard part of her valley, her breast bone, you would call it, except there wasn't a breast actually on it there. I shook my fist, from the hurt, she was so hard and then I charged her wrapping my arms full around her, still facing her, crushing her body to mine. I hoisted her feet off the floor and carted her onto the mattress. I was so set to fuck her but she was all sewn up still.

Page 81.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Fuck, Brad, she's still stitched.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Yeah, I know. Don't you want to leave her that way?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Nawh, she's getting out of being fucked. She needs to be fucked.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'How about in the ass?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Sure that too, but I want her cunt.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'OK, I'll get the scissors and we can open her up.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was out and back with them faster than two blinks and Sally didn't want her stitches removed then.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She tried to slap us away and we belted her back and soon she was laying there with her legs wide spread and the scissors nipping at the thread. She held her breath for each snip and the moment she was opened again I pounced into her. My cock really wanted her pink. I assumed Brad would have to go for her asshole since I've never seen two cocks in one vagina which got me to thinking. Could it be done?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He started for her mouth instead of her rectum.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'First move over a bit. I want her to suck me off.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Brad. Brad, stop for a second. I just thought of something, I've never had the chance to do before because I never had a helper, a buddy like you to help me.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Uh? What? What? She's going to suck me off.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Later, lots of time for regular stuff like that later. We gotta try this.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'What? What the fuck?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You'll see. I'm going to get out of her and I want you to get into her cunt from behind.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Shit, sure, I ain't got no problem with that. Anything else?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Just get into her deep. Really plug her and hold it.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It didn't take long for him to be in her right to his hilt. He gripped onto her tits to stabilize her from squirming off his cannon and it looked perfect to me.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'OK, here goes. I'm going to turn the two of you together onto your backs. Keep it hard in her. Grab onto her hips and keep her pinned.'

Page 82.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I rotated the two of them and Brad ended laying flat on his backside with Sally pined to him by his cock way up into her cunt, from behind.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Don't take this personal, buddy, but I gotta handle your prick a bit. So don't start to pump her yet.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Whatever turns you on.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My cock was out like a night on the town, and I pulled up on the top of her plugged opening and pushed down on his shaft at the same time.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad could see where I was headed and so could Sally.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She mewled and protested but Brad wrapped his forearm across her yap.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Oh man. You going to put yours in her too. With mine in there. Our two cocks in her one vagina.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Don't know, if it can be done, but I'm sure going to try.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And the thing was, it wasn't that difficult.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I had to wriggle and jab quite a bit, and pull really hard up on her labia split. I mean her clit really got yanked, but my cock slid in right over top of Brad's, as I lay down full along her strained body with Brad pancaked under the two of us.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Now fuck isn't that something else?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'How do we fuck her?' Brad couldn't get moving.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'We'll have to thrust at the same time otherwise our cocks will bind against each other. We have to thrust as one big dick with two heads.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'OK, I'll give it try.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He started to push up in further and I matched his thrust. He slid back and so did I. And in no time we were synchronized and it was more than spectacular. As our strengths and urgencies increased, it finally didn't mater if we were coordinated and we&nbsp; were each just blasting away at out own paces. Sally was a pinned rag doll and we both clawed at her tits, with our hands ending up gripping each other's at times like we were shaking hands. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Fuck man. I'm ready to cum. How about you?' Brad asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Hold on. Another half minute.' I urgently replied.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I rammed harder than I had to in a long time and gave Brad the count down, but he could pretty well tell by my ecstatic groans.

Page 83.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Anytime. Anytime you want.' I called out.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And within five seconds of each other she got two spunk loads for the price of one.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Shit, have you ever felt anything like that before?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Felt it? Fuck no, I never even thought of it. You're a fucking, no that's a fuck genius.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Thank you very much. It was a bit original, wasn't it?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'What now?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Lets stay in her awhile. It feels so fucking good and look, she's half out of it anyway.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We wiggled about in her for five minutes and then I drew out first and Brad followed my lead. She was conscious but barely and Brad went back to her open mouth. He shoved what was left of his erection down her throat.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The others had heard the crashing around and were calling out their objections but they didn't seem quite as sincere nor intense as they had been earlier. Perhaps it was better that Sally was getting busted than either of them. They should have realized it didn't matter. Their turns would come, but that's how hope works.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Surprisingly, Sally sucked Brad pretty good, I suppose because, I swear, he had the thing ten inches down her throat and he was just over six inches erect so it was some feat. I couldn't see any of her face. I'd decided to slide into her all by my lonesome and as I slopped away inside her again, I couldn't see any of her face, the way he had his sack jammed onto her nose. He was fucking smothering her with his package and she suddenly fell limp.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We both looked surprised and pulled out of her at the same time. I checked for a heart beat and it was faint but still chugging along.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Fuck, shit. That was sweet. So now you finish her in the cunt and I'll do her ass.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was like a 'to do' list, only it was a 'to do her' one.

Page 84.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was a fuck-a-thon, mar-a-thon and he was totally amenable.
I smacked Sally back to full consciousness and she protested mildly while she was being double dosed again but in a much more conventional manner, traditional, you might say. It took us ten minutes of doing our duet and she got very well spunked again, but the thing was she was a good fuck and not a bad one so she had a problem, like a potentially fatal one.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We both extracted from her and sat her up on the edge of the bed and sat on each side of her with our arms around her bare, trembling shoulders, like two loving fathers. I tilted her face up to face me and told her, 'You'd better do some fast thinking. That wasn't bad at all, none of it. No way you'll be the worst fuck.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad tilted her lips to his and kissed her. 'Sweets, you were fantastic. I bet you never thought you could handle two cocks in your cunt at once. I never heard of that before. Had you?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You're both filthy scum. Scum. Scum.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Yup, that's us, the scum brothers, but you better do what he says. No way you're going to be the worst fuck. That's not possible.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She couldn't fathom how to reason her way out of this. She hadn't even been able to think about how to ruin a fuck and now it was over and too late.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'No. No, please. Don't you see, if you liked it, we can do it again and again. Even both your pricks at once. You don't have to kill me. If you kill me, we can't, but we can lots if you don't. Don't you see?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Something came over us both at the same time and we were about to descend upon her. Whiny little sniveling bitch, she deserved it. Trying to shuck with us. Trying to jive our minds.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We each cupped one of her breasts and squeezed away. We lowered our heads together, like synchronized swimmers and got to suckling on one of her nipples each. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She senses a catastrophe building. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I tenderly raised my hand to cup the under fullness of her breast as Brad did the same thing. And then simultaneously, we both bit down and through. We had to saw a little with our incisors, but the cunt lost two nipples in the space of ten seconds. Her scream was so piercing the other two shit themselves and of course Sally was out cold for relief.

Page 85.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Keep it. Don't swallow it or chew it.' I told Brad.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had no idea about my severed nipple collection.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He fished the lose bud out of his kisser and I did the same and we laid them carefully on a bed side table. Sally had areolas but no buds, not a fucking one and Brad and me looked at each other both pleased and surprised. It was like it'd been choreographed, but it hadn't been. It had been spontaneous and instinctive and it deepened our wonderment of our understanding of each other. To repeat my own cliche, we really were joined at the prick. So talk about bosom buddies, we were nipple decapitating&nbsp; buddies and who'd ever heard of that before?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sally wasn't much good for anything right away after that so it was on to candidate number two.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We stashed her in another room, all trussed up and went for Julie. Of course, Beth would be the last. The best for last or the Beth for last. Whatever.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Julie fought from the moment we tried to free her from being tied to the couch and to Beth. She was the strongest of them all, with a slightly more solid build and she sported the biggest tits. The moment I had her hands cut free, she tried to wrestle with me grabbing for my hands and the knife that was in one. She was the fucking hot-shot lawyer and she liked pushing men around, especially in litigation negotiations she often chaired when she knew she had the upper hand. As she clawed to relieve me of the knife, I pulled her arms way above her head and Brad shot in for the fast jab and her tit crunched to her breast plate.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He set his fist to fly again, drew it way back like for a super bash, 'You want another one?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was still sputtering from the first blow and croaked out, 'No. No. OK. No. I'll come with you.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As if there was ever any doubt in any mind other than hers.

Page 86.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We chugged her down the hall and she tried to see into the doorway where we had Sally stashed. She'd started to come to and was begging to herself that it not be true. That her nipples not be missing. She wailed but softly and whimpered more loudly. She was more than conflicted, she was afflicted with missing nipple syndrome which fucked with her sexual identity besides setting her pain center on fire. We goosed Julie past the doorway, so she had to stop being nosy, and shoved her into the bedroom where all the raping and pillaging was being staged. As we closed the door behind us, and I turned to lock it, she charged right for me. She'd gone in almost to the bed, but then turned her mind around and thought she might bust right through the door. It was solid hardwood, so that was ultimately unlikely, more apt was that she break her shoulder.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We both dodged aside at the last split second and she body checked right into her way to freedom, except it wouldn't give, not even a fractional inch. She recoiled and gasped and grabbed onto her almost dislocated arm and bent over sort of moaning and cursing. How could she be so stupid to ram the door and miss me? The idea was to jam me to the door and then hopefully get a few cheap shots into my testicles. It didn't unfold that way at all and now she was stuck with the two of us, with out dicks at the ready, and her upper body discombobulated as she sunk to the floor in defeat. But we didn't let her go all the way down. We grabbed her upper arms, one each side to the fleshy part and propelled her right on to the bed. She tried to break her landing on the mattress by dropping to the floor but that didn't work either. I grabbed her long hair and used it for a handful of pull. Her face was contorted and she squawked out and Brad started to booting her. He gave her calf and upper legs a few boots and now all she wanted to do was get out of his way onto the bed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We didn't care how she got there, just so long as she landed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He leapt up onto the mattress and onto top of her. He wanted to rumble and tumble with her for a few minutes so I just settled back amused to watch. He wasn't trying to kill her or anything. He just wanted to rough her up and slap her around and punch her along with a few sexual intrusion violations. When ever he got his thumb into her crease, she tried to slap his offending hand, the hand of an offender, away and his other one would take up the cause. She was slap happy but wanted to be punchy, like punching his gonads and I needed to put a stop to their antics. It all was making me unbearably horny.

Page 87.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'OK, enough. Enough. We have some stuff to discus.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I stuck the nose of my gun right under hers and she tamed her fighting spirit which enabled her to settle down.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was sputtering and wondered to know, 'What did you do to Sally? We could hear a lot of crashing and then we know you raped her, but her scream. It was such a horrible, pitiful sound. What did you do to her?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We looked at each other, the two amigos, as if to say, What in earth was she talking about? Or, Who? Us? Little old innocent us?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Don't tell me you don't know. You don't remember. You have to know. Nobody screams like that unless it's pretty terrible.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Pretty terrible?' I repeated. 'Well it wasn't pretty and you don't want to know the rest, like how terrible, how horrific, so let's get on with your situation. Tell us what you think. How you want to solve this impasse. Come on, you're the lawyer. You have all the big words and judicial visions, the sense of propriety, so give us something to work with.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I know what I think. You want to know what I think?' Her tone was not conciliatory, more defiant with an air of finality.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'That's what we're here for.' Brad informed her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I think you're a killer.' And she pointed to me. 'And that you are not, so I think you should back away from this now so you don't end up in the electric chair or strapped on a gurney with a needle in your arm.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'There's no more electric chair, old sparky. There hasn't been for years. You should know that.' I taunted back at her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You're right. Of course you are. Lethal injection now. It's just a figure of speech, a carry over from the old days when they fried guys like you. But the death penalty. That's on the table here. You know what I mean. You're setting yourselves up for that.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I clapped enthusiastically.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Very good. Excellent, excellent, counselor. You think that all up on your own? So, tell me you care. Tell me you care what happens to us and it isn't just about what happens to you. Go ahead, make my day and tell me that lie.'

Page 88.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She hated being derided. She hated being belittled, especially in court when some sleaze-bag lawyer who wanted to get into her pants, and couldn't, used those same underhanded tactics and tones.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Fuck you, twerp. Don't you dare ridicule my acumen.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'And fuck you back. You figure my friend here should abate me, pull me up short so no one gets killed, especially not you?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You're using the word wrong, idiot. Abate doesn't apply in this context.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I does if I say it does. Moderate, deprive, nullify my intentions, sure it applies.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'It's slightly off the mark, so you're just trying to appear smart when you're really not. But to answer your question, yes, that's what I think, no one should get killed.' 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She said it directly to me and then rooted around at Brad's resolve, but that was the thing too. He didn't have any because he didn't need any. Resolve implies need for determination and what he was up to came naturally, like breathing and jerking off.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Natural born maimers and tamers, that's what we were, what he was. The indomitable duo.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You hear me. You don't have to continue with this and it's not too late to stop. Talk to your friend. Reason with him and you can still stop yourself and hopefully him too. You don't have to maim and kill.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Fuck you, bitch, I'm in the room. Don't you yap as if I'm not here, you stupid superior cunt.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I back handed her manipulating mouth.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But Brad was pissed even more, that this fuck ass bitch, high falutin lawyer cunt, would presume that he couldn't maim and kill just as well as me. It was an insult to his manliness and his character and he flashed hot angry. He didn't see red, he saw white. He stormed out of the bedroom, barely opening the door to get out, he near went through it instead. I could hear Sally protesting and Brad thumping her and then he burst into where we were, where I was, with Sally in tow, but out front. He marched her right up to Julie and pulled her arms high above her head and her nippleless tits hung down forlornly in front of her friend's disbelieving eyes.

Page 89.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'It's a bit late to avoid that maiming thing, wouldn't you say? And don't you think she'd be better off dead?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I came up behind Sally and pounded her ass. She gave a little shot up onto her tippy toes and then started to sag and buckle. Brad let go of her upheld wrists and she crumpled down right on top of me. Of course, I'd sort of laid down so she could end up on top.
I pushed up on her tits and rolled her over and climbed all over her like a bear eating its child victim and I poked at her nippleless areolas.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So what do you think, counselor? What do you think our sentence for this should be?' I taunted her gain.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her legal jargon had dried up, had deserted her and she had gone mute and she was starting to tremble from fury and hating.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Get her out of here.' I asked Brad, but more like told him. 'I think she gets the picture now.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad hauled her along by her hair down the hall to the next room and I could hear him administer her a few good smacks and thuds. God he loved kicking them when they were down. He'd always thought he should have been a punter.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I faced Julie alone.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You know, you might be right. You know. I don't know him that well. We just met in the restaurant, yesterday, where you and her taunted us and that's why we hooked up to get revenge on you all. Think we're doing a fairly good job of it?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'No, no please. No. We didn't mean anything.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Sure you did. You know the power of words, you work with them all the time, twisting meanings. Don't fucking lie to me. You liked it. It made you feel superior to make us feel small and that's what you do in court, isn't it? Isn't it?' I shouted louder.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She shook her head in denial.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So this is our court now and we're the judge and jailors and executioners and that's both of us, you got it? And it doesn't matter if he's not up for it, if he's never done it before, I have lots of times before, so that's what you have to work with, to worry about.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You're a monster. That's all I can say, You're despicable.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'If that was all you could say, why did you add despicable? So see you're not so smart after all.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was a moot point, Brad had returned with blood on the end of his pecker.

Page 90.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'She thinks I'm a despicable monster. What do you think?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He paused for a moment and marched right up to Julie and gripped her defiant cheeks in his fist.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'He's a prince. He's a hero, my hero and he's given me opportunities I never thought I'd get, not in the real world anyway and not just in my fantasies. So you insult him, you insult me, bitch.' 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And he slugged her really hard across her vulnerable bare tits. He took a few more sparring punches at her but seemed to be holding back.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She could see she'd miscalculated trying to set one of us against the other but that was exactly what we intended to do with her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So do you want us to do the same thing to you we did to her?' I suggested.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We both moved in on her and each grabbed a tit with both hands and aimed out lips for her sizeable hard buds.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'God, no. No, Don't.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then we got out lips latched onto her and were suckling up a storm and she continued to wheedle and wail about it all.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'No. No, I'll do anything. No. No, for God's sake, no.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We both popped off her nipples, them still intact and attached.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Anything? Now that's what we want to hear. Took you long enough. What took you so long?' I was leading her down.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So isn't it just the most delicious thing when a woman says she'll do anything? Because you just know it has something to do with her cunt? That's what the anything is. They think to offer what they already know you can take. She was such a predictable twerp, she was almost boring, but we could play it well against her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'By anything, you mean you'll chose one of the others to die?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She'd meant she'd sacrifice her cunt and now we were back to her sacrificing one of he friends.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I asked Brad. 'You pull your punches with her?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Yeah, I did after the first one.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Why?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'She looked sort of sad and hurt, like she couldn't take anymore. She was vulnerable and almost sweet.'

Page 91.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Yeah, she did look pathetic, didn't she. So compassion, it's in your vocabulary too, in your bag of tricks?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Well I suppose, but if you think about it, it just means she'll be in a little better shape to be hurt worse later. Make sense to you?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Only about two hundred percent. Right on, perfectly logical right on. Geeze you're a natural at this.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And I wasn't being servile or obsequious. He had a genuine knack for knocking knockers right out of their bras and skin.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Julie was abject.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She knew right what was next.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So you'll do anything? You said you would, So chose. Chose one of the others or your nipples will join these.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I sauntered over to collect our budding trophies from Sally and held them first and forefront before Julie's vision. Her brain almost seized as I popped them into my mouth, rolled them around and then sort of spit them out into my opened hand.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Now you try. But don't chew them or swallow them.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I held my offerings to her reluctant, sealed lips.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'It's very simple, cunt, either you have a taste of her's, or you get to taste your own.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I pinched the harder one of her two erections.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And pulled way out on it like I was getting it ready for my teeth. Brad came around to assist me with her other one.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She accepted Sally's severed buds into her mouth and swilled them around as her face contorted in virtual disbelief. How could this be, that she was sucking on her friends nipples, but they were no longer attached to her. They felt like two small Smarties but had no place in Candyland.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Give 'em back.' I held out my hand and she spit them away.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We had to scuffle along the floor to be sure we didn't step on one or both, but we found them, one near rolled all the way over to the doorway, which was bared.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So chose, chose or we continue and you lose yours too.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her mouth quivered and her chest shook and her mind almost seized as she whispered, 'Beth.'

Page 92.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Beth. Beth.' We both repeated it back to her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She just barely could nod her head she was so paralyzed by her betrayal.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You know, Julie wouldn't chose. It didn't matter how much we threatened her, she wouldn't give one of you up. So Beth it is.
Why her?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She didn't want to say. She didn't want to talk about it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Come on, we have to know your reason. I mean you've probably just cost her her life, so what gives? Why?' I persisted.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'She.. When we were talking by ourselves, she..'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'She did something. What the fuck did she do?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'She said she, we were going to try to use chance to decide, and she said we were to blame for all this happening and she wasn't so she shouldn't be a part of..'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Oh, I see. She wanted it to be just between you two, then and not include her.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Julie nodded.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Yeah, I suppose that could do it then. Her not accepting an equal chance.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'OK.. OK, that should do it then. I guess we should go talk to Beth.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Julie looked relieved and sheepish and cast her eyes to the doorway she so desperately wanted to get through. She was done, at least for now and she was almost away.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You want to fuck her again?' I asked Brad.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She recoiled and whimpered, 'Please, I don't want any more. Please.' And she cried about it pretty convincingly too.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I moved over to her and stroked her cheek and collected the tears that were running down. They tasted salty and were full of vitamins. She got all soft and meek and just wanted to pull far away from me. I cuddled her shoulder and slid her face up for a tender, decent kiss. Her lips were even softer as they trembled and tried not to part.

Page 93.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Come on, baby. It's not that bad. You did good, you don't have to cry.' I soothed her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'It is that bad, and I don't want you to rape me again.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I know. I know. And I don't want to either.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She seemed confused but assumed that meant she was safe.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'How about we make love?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She shot her face up to plead with mine and whimpered into her tears. I cuddled her shaking shoulders a little tighter and started to raise her up for our short trip to the awaiting mattress.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Brad, buddy, do you mind leaving us alone? I think my little sweetie here would like some privacy.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He knew exactly how to cue into my sentiments and didn't object at all. In fact, he wanted to mess with Beth, a little by himself, with her way off in the living room by lonesome. He had some ideas and experiments of his own he wanted to try out.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'No problem. Treat her good and give her one for me.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He grabbed his dick as he swaggered out the doorway to commiserate with Beth.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We were alone and Julie wasn't sure if that was good or bad.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'No listen, please. I don't want to.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You don't want to make love with me? Shouldn't I be offended?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'No, you know that's not right. Please be honest about it.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was still walking her to the mattress and she pulled her steps, so to say, like she wanted to go the other way. I hugged her firmer and she had to travel along with me.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was right at the edge of the mattress but wouldn't sit down. I took her face in between my two hands, not fists this time, and straightened out her gaze so she had to look me straight in the eyes. There was still defiance buried in her pleading.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I kissed her mouth nicely and slid my tongue about her lips which she didn't want to part. I squeezed her just hard enough to give her my insistent message and she parted her lips and my tongue darted in and played with the tip of hers. She tasted clean and warm and everything about her was inviting. Except that she wasn't inviting me in.

Page 94.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was as if she preferred to be raped.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That way the lines of power weren't blurred.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I pressed&nbsp; her harder to the edge of the mattress, trying to tip her onto it and I could feel the sinews in her leg muscles fighting and straining.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My chest was nudging her breasts and her nipples had grown hard but still she didn't want to lay down with me. I held the little push-of-war for a few moments longer and then let complete hold of her. I stepped back and walked around to the other side of the bed and crawled up onto it, like a little innocent kid would do. She never took her fixed gaze off me for even a moment. That was until I got settled in the center of the bed, resting my head on my arm and hand, like Lady Godiva, and patting the mattress for her to come and join me.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She shot her glances to the unguarded doorway and had such a snap decision to make. I just watched her pummel her own impulses, as she held back and didn't try to make the run for it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At least she was that smart. She'd only get worse if she didn't make it and those chances were slimmer than none.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I'm glad you resolved that.' I let her know, I knew she had.  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'That was a good and wise choice and now you have another one to make. Come here. Join me. Don't be afraid, I won't hurt you. We really do need to make love.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Please, please just let me sit here for a awhile. I need time. I need to think.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I motioned OK. I was in no hurry. Love is patient and doesn't try to hurry itself or another. At least wasn't that how those soppy sayings plaques said it? All the mushy crap that had nothing to do with real rape and often less to do with real relationships.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She selected a chair, the one she'd been tied to earlier, even though it was a little bent out of shape. When she'd been keeled over onto its and her side, the one leg got worst bent so now it was wobbly. She rocked back and forth on it, but it was more like tipping it to and fro and she hugged her arms to herself across her chest, I supposed to hide some of her tits, probably mostly her nipples. She knew I had a thing for them in general, so hers in specific were an attraction.

Page 95.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How else to account for the reality that Sally was missing hers. And maybe if I didn't keep on seeing them, I wouldn't keep on wanting them. She secretly hoped.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You know regardless of what you say, it'll still be rape. I can't make love to you, and you can't make love to me.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I'm glad you didn't say, irregardless.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'What? Uh?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Irregardless, it's not a word. Regardless is the word and I hate when I hear people, even some educated ones, mis-speaking it that way.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She looked at me like, Who the fuck cares? - She certainly didn't.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Whatever.' She muttered.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You know, if you'll give me a chance, even half a chance, you'll find I'm not half bad. I know what a woman wants. I know how to please a woman. I know how to stimulate your clitoris. How to handle it right. I don't have to hurt it all the time.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As if that was some kind of accomplishment, she thought. Any fool could find an engorged mass at the top of a vagina, even a drunken one. So she wasn't much impressed with my declaration of acumen and she had to let me know it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Big deal. You think you're a stud, a stud muffin. A Casanova. I've had teenaged boys who could do that and all I had to do was tell them how and they were great.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was a bit piqued and pissed at her. I was trying to be inviting, non-threatening and conciliatory and she was putting me down and even running me down.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'That's not very nice. No, that's rude and inconsiderate and inconsiderate of my feelings.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She really didn't give a fuck, in fact, she totally didn't give one and it was quite the opposite. She wanted to hurt my feelings and more than them, but she was wise, she didn't show it, right then.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'That's too bad.' She was flippant.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'No, it's not too bad. Say you're sorry.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She gave me a blank, knowing stare as if to say, even if I do, you know I don't mean it, like how a lot of married couples interact after countless isolated years together.

Page 96.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Oh, OK. OK, I'm sorry.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She sounded about as sincere as a used car salesman about to lose a sale.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I gave her a self-satisfied, smug look and it lit her fuse.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'No. No, I'm not. I'm not sorry. You know if you have to ask for it, it doesn't mean anything. What kind of sorry is that when it's not spontaneously given? Unless it's freely offered?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now it was my turn.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I don't much give a fuck, flying or otherwise. You can say you're sorry and not mean it, or I can make you sorry and you will mean it, so what'll it be?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She looked at me, not at all loving.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Say you're sorry. I make you sorry. So which?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'And you call that making love? Making threats like that? Under duress. What kind of love-making is that?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I already told you I don't want to force you. I don't want to rape you, so why don't you just count your blessings and get your sweet ass over here.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I patted the bed anew.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All of a sudden we could hear a commotion, from the living room, like something had fallen. Brad was at Beth and she was yelping and almost begging. It startled Julie and that special look of fear ran across her face once again.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So you see, that's always the other alternative. I could ask him in here instead.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She knew that would probably end in a two-some, like the two of us piling on her, ganging up on her, which for her would make it a threesome.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You want me to see what he's up to and bring him back here?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She shook her head meekly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I just can't though. I can't do what you're asking. I know myself and I can't.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And she seemed sincere and resigned.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You know what? I think I've got an answer.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She perked up, like morning coffee, and like she thought it wasn't going to happen. That was my idea, something else would suffice.

Page 97.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'What you need to do, is act. Like an actress in a movie role. Like how they make love for a scene. That's what you need to do.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She wasn't stupid. I was giving her an out where she couldn't see one, although, I supposed for me, it was more of an in.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'If I did, you'd know. I'd just be acting. We wouldn't actually be making love.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was biting the bait.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'But you could be pretty convincing, couldn't you? So I could hardly feel the difference?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was a world of difference, as far as she was concerned and figured she better do something before my patience ran out and besides she could see my boner'd built and was probably looking for some instant satisfaction.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Can't get no satisfaction, wouldn't be a good tune to be playing in that bedroom.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Have you ever acted before?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Nothing like this.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'But ever before?' I persisted.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'A bit in high school, the drama club.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her mind drifted back to a love scene she'd been the maiden in and how the pretend kissing had led to her getting involved with the guy for quite some time after the play'd ended.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She remembered she could detach herself from the activity, since it was role playing and she realized, that's what she had to do then. Make me the teen-aged guy and her the innocent girl and just stay focused like that. And that was the thing too, about the dynamics of what I was proposing, she still was innocent. She would bear no guilt for whatever level of participation she finally succumbed to. That was survival at its mitigated all.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad must really have been doing her because Beth cried out from the living room with more pain and urgency and it jolted Julie again.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'OK. I'll try. No guarantees, but I'll try to act as if we're making love.'

Page 98.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I motioned her to the mattress again.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I'd almost patted a hole in it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ever so slowly she pulled her self up off the chair and shuffled over to the edge and just stood there, her spectacular tits afraid and her crotch trembling. How could she be allowing herself to walk over, to allow herself to be raped even if it was under the guise of love making? She was ashamed of her complicity but then heard Beth's anguished shrieks again.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;God, I wanted to see what he was up to, to make her terror like that, and would have to find an excuse, but that wasn't for the moment.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I reached gently and took her arm at the wrist and tugged ever so little. She started to fold onto the bed. I thought she was going to crawl to me, like on all fours, but she saw the imagery of that and the subservience it contained. Instead, she sat down with her back hunched forward and sort of cuddling herself. I could see the notches of her spine, of her vertebrae, right down to her tail bone and it cranked my turn on.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I reached across to her and stroked her down her spine, stopping at each notch and then moving on down. When I got to her bottom one, I started to slide my fingers under her lily white bum.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She jerked away and looked around at me as if to say, What do you think you're doing? Leave my bum alone.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But I knew what I was doing and wanted to do, but what was she doing and what was she willing to do to make love?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I stopped with her ass and took hold of one arm, at the upper muscle, and drew her towards me. I was firmer like than it was optional and she started to roll around to face me. Her feet were finally off the floor and her legs onto the mattress.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I maneuvered down to tickle her feet and play with her legs, like playful kids would do. At first she didn't seem to mind it too much as I kissed her toes one at a time. But then ever so imperceptibly I started to spread her legs.

Page 99.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I had her feet almost two feet apart and had been avoiding it, solely for dramatic effect, but now I started to look right into her vagina. I slid my hands up her legs to above her knees and she started to not make love again.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I let go of them, her legs, and went right up to encircle her shoulders. I pulled her head to me gently and tilted her sweet face up to kiss mine. I gave her a sweet dry one. She was OK with that then, until my hand drifted onto her breasts headed for her areolas. I had to handle her firmer and her muscles tensed and fought but she wasn't out of control. It was all just under the skin and she was trying not to show it hoping I wouldn't feel it. Reluctance is a natural born enemy of love making that seems so natural to some beautiful, overly entitled women. They were too good for the dick, but Julie wasn't superior to mine. She just had to be made to realize it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Come on, you have to do a better act than that. Remember you said you could act.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'OK. I'll try harder.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'No, don't you see, the secret to convincing acting is not to try harder. It's just the opposite. You have to lose yourself in the role so you're not acting at all. You have to become the person whose role you're playing. Think you can do that?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I'll see. That's what my drama teacher used to say, so I'll see.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The words had barely cleared her tongue and I gave her nipples the lightest pinchies.. She was coal hard already from fear and being naked and pinching her only made her harder like diamonds. I caressed the underside of the fullness of her breasts and headed my mouth for a suckle or two.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Very, very nice. God, you're beautiful. God, you've got great tits.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I cupped her one tit, two handed, and finally got my teeth to pulling out gently on the hard bud. I couldn't see it, but I could sense her face was contorted in disgust and loathing but still she had to act like she liked it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I rolled her over to be on top of me and her tits mashed to my chest and I could feel my boner against her pelvic mound sort of fishing for her lips. I encircled my arms around her back and kissed and nibbled on her ear, the lobe too. I licked her temple.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I wanted to eat, to devour her face and her mind.

Page 100.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I took hold of her skull and pushed her face just far enough back to slide in for a few more soft kisses. Geeze could she kiss nice when she was really acting up a storm.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You OK? You ready?' I asked politely.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She desperately wanted to scream out at me, no, no, never and fuck off, fuck you and fuck off, but she meekly nodded her face.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I'd been ready for half an hour.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And half an hour after we first saw them in the restaurant.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You wet yet?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She looked at me all disgusted, like a gentleman wouldn't ask 
that. Not one who knew his way around women and their sensibilities. And why wouldn't I just find out for myself? Why'd I have to go and ruin it by asking? But she sensed that was just it, to ruin it. That it was control, still an almost rape and the big bad wolf still throbbed in my cock and the devil owned my heart. He could never have my soul but I didn't care if he owned my nature.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Sorry about that. I guess that was rude.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Yes it was.' She retorted but softly. It was a rebuke in the making.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My hand was drifting down over her belly to the tip of her bush. Now I was going for the gold and she realized how much she didn't want me anywhere near to messing around with her pink. But she had to act, better than for an Oscar. She had to marshal her&nbsp; resolves and focus her distractions. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It wasn't me. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It wasn't her. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It wasn't happening to her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'No, please don't.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She begged it so genuinely and heart felt and it was just barely a whisper.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'How am I going to make love with you if I don't touch you there?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Don't use your hands, please. Just your penis.'

Page 101.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'No foreplay? What kind of love making is that? With no foreplay? I thought women always wanted that and more of it.
And it's one of my strong points, patiently arousing a woman. You wouldn't deny me that, would you?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She wanted to deny me my life. She wasn't saying anything, like answering any of my questions but she was surrendering even in her silence, by her lack of objections.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I slid my fingers to the very tip top of her slit and was ready to consummate out first love making vaginal contact.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She must have found some well of courage or escape because she went all relaxed and I slid my fingers along her labia. Wasn't that part of the assertiveness training shit? If rape was inevitable, don't fight it. Relax yourself to the highest degree possible and go out of your body, like it's not happening to you. I sure as hell wanted her spirit present for our making love. I didn't want her floating around supposedly watching it from above. Who believed in that crap anyway? Escapism. Useless escapism and it was going to be useless for her since there was no way for her to flee my descending teeth.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I slid my face down and in no time was eating her out.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was fantastic. No, that doesn't even half describe it. First she was wet but not sloppy and she was barely acidic. She must have douched not too long before, I thought but I couldn't see how she'd have done it. Of course, everything was mushy soft and warm and her nut hadn't started to harden yet, like fill up and get firm engorged.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The funny thing was, she didn't mind my face in her. She could tolerate that but she didn't want me looking inside her with my greedy, beady little red eyes. And that's just what I wanted to see. Her clit before it engorged and the difference of its appearance once it'd filled up. To her it was like I was using a magnifying glass, like a schoolboy would with the sunlight on a lady bug. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But I didn't see it that way. Lovers weren't supposed to have any secrets from each other so why shouldn't I see that secret part of her where I was going to bury my pecker? Maybe even if only to be sure it would be safe and no harm was awaiting it, like maybe she had sharks teeth in it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And she wasn't stupid.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Some of my assumptions may have been, but none of hers were. She knew to fear and the consequences of underestimating my danger and greed.

Page 102.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She knew I was only acting too.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I could tear that part clean out of her any time I wanted.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I insisted to pry her labia apart.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'OK. OK, please just, please don't hurt me.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Why would I hurt you? We're making love.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She laid herself flat to the bed, bit her lower lip and let me explore her, and she prayed. I could tell she was talking to someone.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And how did that work then? At one point she would have prayed to Him, or probably for Her, Her, not to let me see her naked. And that hadn't worked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And then she would pray not to be molested and that wasn't working, so what was the point? Unless she was begging that I not get all fired up and torture her cunt in a fit of misplaced passion. Now that might work right then because I wanted to try the relationship side of sexual intercourse and not just the mechanics of doing it. It didn't take anything to rape a woman. To make her truly fear it and trick her into fooling herself she didn't, now that was the master of the matter.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I got to stroking her slit crease at the top pretty aggressively and she was starting to expand. I slid two fingers along inside her canal and turned my wrists all about to softly ream her. She wasn't so accepting of that and tried to shut the whole thing down, expecting me to insist. But the good thing about good love making, the finer point was the moment you sensed your partner's objection, you backed off. You acknowledged without words the resistance and you went to another approach.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I'd so wanted to connect to her cervix it took every ounce of my play acting not to bump into it hard. I slid my fingers right out of her and she un-tensed and I gripped her about the hips and rolled her right over so that she was on top of my face with her crotch.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I shifted her back and forth a bit, moved her body back and forth and nuzzled my face, pretty well my whole nose into her lips.
I wriggled side to side and then opened my mouth, to suck on her soft inner lips, but also to let her clit grind against the hard edge of my two front teeth.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She'd try to pull up and I'd guide her down until her clit was split, but not cruelly. Now she could control how much sharp pressure she wanted against her g spot and how much she wanted to relieve it and how much she wanted to gyrate a little bit too. And if she didn't want it at all, she'd pay for that later and she knew it.

Page 103.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I held her ass from the back and pulled and released, and bumped and nuzzled, and her nut got harder than my cock. She was surprised I got her so worked up, and didn't know whether or not to let herself enjoy it. It's the old saw about a guy not being able to prevent himself from having an erection if a beautiful woman handles him just right. That was one of the war-time tortures, wrap piano wire tightly around a guy's flaccid cock, just one loop, and then have a woman tease the hapless sap until his dick expanded and the wire cut right into his shaft. This was not dissimilar in that she could not order her physiological responses to cease or desist.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I knew I had her and I could have her anytime I wanted, but did she know it, really deep down in her mushy core? Did she know she was being made love to, and she was starting to do it back? There was only one way to find out for sure. I had to finger her cervix.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I got my teeth off her clit and rolled her onto her side and cupped her breasts together and got two of her nipples into my mouth at once. She was pretty nicely endowed so it wasn't hard to do. My tongue flicked from nipple to nipple and she liked this more than she should too.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She snapped back from the physical pleasure to her mental displeasure and rolled away from my mouth. I was up to cradle her face and traced my fingers down her nose to her lips and onto her teeth. I gazed her deep in the eyes and underneath the hatred there was loathing and underneath that revenge was lurking, but not an ounce of love for me, so how could she make me love?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I laid my&nbsp; head on her beating heart, and it was ticking pretty fast, and I mashed about on her tits a bit. I wasn't crushing her or anything. It was just like two superb pillows to rest my weary perversions on.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was back down stroking her vagina at the top and sliding along to the bottom almost to her anus and she was more tensed than she needed to be. I wasn't assaulting her, in that I wasn't&nbsp; abusing her or hurting either, so she needed to relax, and accept it for what it was, passive control. Even though she tried not to, she still thought she was being raped. Shows what she knew.

Page 104.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You want a drink? You need a few to help you unwind?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She wasn't about to say no, only in that it broke my delusions I was making her love and she was being mildly raped in return and she never for a second saw or felt it differently, but if this was going to end well, she needed to sublimate her revulsions and accentuate her instincts for survival, like do whatever it took. And she could do it, she knew she could. She knew I wanted to contact her cervix by then and had to abide by my building urgency to do so. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Please. yes. I'd like something. It'll help me. So please.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was up off her and got into the living room for a minute to see what Brad had been up to to make Beth scream like she had, several deep piercing ones. What had he been subjecting her to? And I couldn't believe my fucking eyes.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had her hanging upside down, strung up by one leg, from an overhead, old-fashioned, ceiling vent. He'd done some rooting around and found a coil of yellow nylon rope about one quarter inch diameter and got it through the vent to secure it to a second story floor joist where some wiring went through, and he'd fastened it off securely. He'd found an aluminum step ladder. After he'd fixed one end of the rope, he made Beth climb the ladder to the top, the 'do not stand here', top and had her sit there while he tied her ankle off to the secured rope and then pulled the ladder out from under her. It's worked beautifully and efficiently and that was the first magnificent crash we'd all heard and he was quite pleased with his engineering ingenuity.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He looked surprised to see me and me even more surprised to see her like that.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Fuck, fuck, geeze man. Fucking brilliant. You're fucking brilliant. How'd you get her like that all by yourself.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He explained, what I just said, and I gave him a firm handshake and a firmer slap on the back. His ego was pumped up to match the way his cock had been for quite awhile by then.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beth's eyes pleaded with me to intervene.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For an intervention. For a rescue.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Please. Please, help me. Get me down, please. It hurts my ankle.' It was much more of a whisper than a cry for help.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I bet it does. Fuck that has to hurt plenty.' I acknowledged her suffering, at least at a verbal level, not as if I'd do anything about it. That was Brad's show and he was the director and producer. He owned the sole credit and any awards and tokens that would flow from it.

Page 105.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her other leg was dangling loosely to the side and she was so asking for it, and I just had to give her a quicky cunt nuzzle with my teeth.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Fuck man, don't get me started on her. I really gotta go, but I need some of this.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I scooped up a half full bottle of Smirnoff vodka and was retreating back to Julie. I had to get away from the incredibly erotic sight of Beth hanging like that and I could still smell her cunt on my nose and it fired me up.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Was I going to continue making love to Julie after seeing and tasting Beth like that?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad got me just as I was leaving the room.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'How's it going in there? You doin' her good?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Oh, it's going alright. She's about to cum and cum and fucking cum. But it's nothing like you've got going down in here.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'She's a multiple one then?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'If I have my way, she'll set a new world record, and then when we get working on her together again, she'll have to cum without her clit. Is that even fucking possible? To remain orgasmic with her g spot tore out, like bit out?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I love the way you talk.' Brad complimented me in so many ways. He had come over to see me and smacked the side of my head and I disappeared back off down the hall sort of humming and skipping with my cock bounding in front of me.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was going to make love to Julie and she to me, like her fucking life depended on it, and she was going to fake it perfect.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was back&nbsp; in with her with the refreshment.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'How's Beth? What's he doing to her? What? Why did she scream?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You don't want to know. She's just hanging around waiting for me. They both are, so we better get on with what we're doing.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She had no idea of the literal content of my words and gulped down three stiff shots, one fast after the other. I think she'd have drunk the whole half bottle if I'd allowed for it. I had a couple myself, just to be polite, mustn't drink alone and all that conventional shit and we were ready to resume, at least she was.
She was eager to get it over with.

Page 106.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I couldn't get the sight or the aroma of Beth out of my head, both of them.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I needed Julie to get innovative to distract me.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Can you give me some head? A little bit of fellatio. That'd be nice and cozy, like for real lovemaking.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She just shook her head side to side and it was a pretty adamant gesture. She wanted to dig in on that point and wasn't about to facilitate me juicing her mouth.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I won't do that and if you try to make me, then we're not making love anymore. Any pretext of that will be totally gone.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As if any of it had ever been there except in her hopes that she was fooling me.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I nodded that I understood and she took it to mean that I accepted.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I suppose anal sex is out of the question too?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was different.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I wasn't being so careful to be couth and she felt a chill in her region.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Look, stop it. Stop it please. Don't talk like that. That is no way to make love.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I knew she was right but I was starting not to care. The cock wants what the prick wants and right then, cervix soup was on the menu. And I wasn't sure I had the patience and endurance to work her up to orgasm again, or at least have her be in the first throes of one. I wanted the soup served hot and chunky and she could feel my meanness creeping back. Her body, her intuition was calling out to her and she had to go into full deception mode. She had to fake it better than the real thing.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Come here. I'm sorry, come here.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was so sincere, and gently inviting.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She spread her legs and guided my face to her pussy pat. She moved my nose against her clit and started to gyrate her hips, but subtly, not wildly at all.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I want you. I want you inside me.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I had visions of a lit fire-cracker in there instead, but they were only fleeting thoughts.

Page 107.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She'd meant my cock which was up like a soldier at attention, like those English bobbies guarding Buckingham Palace and she was unprepared for my thumb to crush in against her vix. She was confused. I was supposed to be cock fucking her (making love to her) and I was thumb, like finger fucking her. She started to resist and then had to resist her impulses to resist. It sure made for a lot of resisting. I pressed hard into her donut and I knew it hurt, it was totally fucking supposed to, but it wasn't unbearable yet and she screwed up her courage and drew my hand out of her and inserted my prick. There was no way I could resist pumping her but I did so like it was slow motion and shallow waters. I only moved an inch back and forth inside her, and maybe a cycle every ten seconds. I'd give a little go. Stop, it seemed as if to rest, and then give her a little jolt jab anew. I could feel every flex of her tightened muscles. I nuzzled her face to her cheek and kissed her lightly. She could smell Beth, only in that she knew it was that distinctive cunt odor and it wasn't hers. Still kissing her, I smoothed across her nipples. I gave the littlest grunt and shot her a load towards her womb. It was like it almost hadn't happened but she felt the burning sticky warmth and me go limp and harmless, or so it seemed to her then.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I wasn't in a hurry to draw out of her and we just laid there in each other's arms, like an embrace, for a few minutes and I must say it was refreshing and relaxing and almost intimate.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I stirred up and got us another couple of drinks. I was spent and the time had been well spent and it was time to guide her back to reality.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I stirred some more, like we'd almost fallen asleep from the booze and exhaustion, but each of us was hyper aware of the other's presence and I kissed her thoughtfully, almost thankfully and slid off of her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She'd done it. She'd gathered her courage and inner strengths and risen to the needs to preserve her life and she should be plenty proud even though she was disgusted and revolted.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'How was it?' She had to ask.

Page 108.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Pretty fucking fantastic. You'd make some guy a great wife? A great lover. You want to be my wife?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She knew it was an impossible question with no right answer and I gave her a weird look.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She tried to remain calm but was panicking inside.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I'm.. I'm glad you enjoyed it.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'That I did. Fucking right, I surely did but I'll enjoy this even more.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'What? Uh? What?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I didn't even give her a hint that I was going to punch her or where. She didn't have time to react, or really clamp her legs tight shut before my knuckles smashed into her just-loved labia.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her shriek was high and sharp and short as she passed out all together.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I wanted to join Brad again so I trussed Julie up and dumped her in with Sally, dear sweet nippless Sally.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beth, in the living room, really needed both out attentions.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad had proved a mechanical genius, the way he'd gotten Beth up the ladder to hang her upside down, suspended by one ankle. The thing was she was a fair sized woman, not plus sized or anything, the euphemism for fucking fat. It was just that she was six foot two and had some real meat on her bones so she weighed in at over one hundred and fifty pounds. And all that weight was hanging by a thread looped around her single ankle.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It fucking hurt more than stink and she had to get us, it had just been Brad up until then, but she had to get us to listen. She so needed relief for her ankle. Plus all her foot circulation was cut off and that could lead to gangrene and all that amputation shit.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She just had to beg for us to get her down. She needed for at least one of us to listen.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Please, God, please get me down. It hurts my ankle so much. Just let me down.'

Page 109.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She didn't want to beg. She didn't want to cower, but what choice did she have? She knew that cower and coward were implicitly connected so she put on her bravest face she could. Even braver than when she'd first found a lump in her tit and was convinced it was cancerous. Nothing benign about it for her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As it turned out, it wasn't the big C, but now she had a far more lethal form of tit tumors. That's what we were. Fucking walking tumors, crawling cancers with forethought and medical malices for selective areas of infestations and malignancy.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What a fucking mouthful of words that was.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We were the ultimate lethal diseases and toxic substances and many apt warning labels came to mind.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Keep out of reach of children.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Do not allow to come into direct contact with skin.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Do not overdose.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lethal when ingested.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Not for human consumption.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Just to rhyme off a few. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of course, I could round out the basic warnings with some additional qualifiers of my own.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Keep out of children's reach, especially good looking pubescent girls who had mothers to match, one of my all time favorite scenarios.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No direct skin contact. I supposed inner pink and erectile tissue should warrant special mentions, like under no circumstances should it ever be allowed. I mean just visualize battery acid being funneled onto a cervix and the convulsions and whining that would accompany that.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No overdoses. How many rapes, rape sessions would constitute that? Do not overdose on rape. How utterly perfect the idea that that could be realized.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lethal when ingested. I supposed it had some semblance to the direct contact warning, but then again, I don't think Brad and me had enough jizz and cum juice in us to prove lethal, so it would have to be augmented with additional measures and catalysts.

Page 110.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And one of my all time favorites, not for human consumption and I supposed that's what severed nipples would be classified as.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beth had to prevail if she had any hope of surviving and it wasn't so easy with the two of us prying into her cunt leering at her exposed clit and canal. We were trying to see up to her vix but it wasn't so easy for us either. There were two sets of hands, like twenty greedy sausage fingers fingering her and pulling apart the folds of her labia and pushing together at her privates. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There were surely too many fingers in that cherry pie.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I dropped to the floor level where her head wasn't quite touching it and greeted her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Hi Beth baby. Geeze, you don't look so good.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Please get me down. Please, he's had me this way for the longest time and my head feels like it's going to exlode.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'He's not treating you so well then?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'No. No, you can see for yourself.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I could see in your cunt for myself. What did you think of that?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Stop being such a bastard and just get me down. My ankle, the skin's being torn, it's cut into.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Awh, isn't that a crime. And I suppose it is, what we're doing to you, but I'll see what I can do.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I joined Brad back up at her labia and asked after him, 'You cut her or burn her yet?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'No, I was gonna save that for both of us.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I appreciate that.' And I did.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beth didn't appreciate hearing it though.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Cut her. Burn her, burn her yet? What do you think of that Beth baby?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She squawked anew.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Not so keen, eh,&nbsp; I guess that's to be expected, but we are. We sure are. Right buddy?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Yeah, But you know what else I found?' He enthused.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I shook my head, no. How could I?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'In the garage, I looked around for myself and the guy who owns this place, he must be into old cars and trucks.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Yeah, OK. So?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So he has one apart, that looks like it's being restored and a fire truck. There's stuff all over the place.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So what'd you find?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I found, I found a six volt battery for the truck and some jumper cables.'

Page 111.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Trucks back then used six volt? I know a lot of cars did.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Some did and some didn't and some even used eight volt. Imagine trying to find those batteries to-day and how much they'd cost.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Yeah, so what were you getting at.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So six volt, it's not as lethal as twelve.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Yeah, I think that's true but it's the amps that count more. Yeah. So?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Oh. Oh, whatever. So there's jumper cables and there's a battery. We take the jumper clamps and we bite the teeth into her labia and after she stops screaming about that, we touch the other ends to the battery terminals.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Fuck man, that's mean. That's super vicious. You want to give her a boost, like charge her cunt?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad's eyes shone and his grin was even brighter.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You don't think it'll kill her?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Nawh, not that far away from her heart besides we don't have to leave it on long. Just for a few seconds and then we break the circuit. What do you think?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I think you're a fucking genius and if you want to fry a cunt, we fry a cunt. Go get the stuff. No, wait a minute, let's get the peanut gallery's opinion.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So what do you think of his idea. He wants to give you a charge. Give your morale a boost, ha ha.' I chuckled wickedly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For Beth it was like re-wind of a bad movie. Everything was working backwards and she couldn't find the reverse button to go forward. She didn't believe I would let Brad follow through on his horrible ideas and she felt I was somehow in control, like the senior partner, just because I was older.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But that was her big missed point. It wasn't up to me to let, or not let Brad do anything. It didn't work that way, which was why we were such compatible buddies together, why we were so harmonized. What ever his pecker wanted his prick got and the same for me. And the only thing different was when the two of us ganged up to co-operate and inflict then it got even more than doubly as worse. The whole was more than the sum of its parts.

Page 112.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad was back and winded.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The battery was much larger than I'd expected. It must have been for all the accessory requirements of the antique fire truck. He had the jumper cables around his neck like an electric scarf, like electro-cutioners.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Geeze, that's a big enough sucker. Let me give you a hand with it. It must be off the truck.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Yeah, he's working on the fire truck. I think it's about a nine-teen fifty-nine Mercury King Seagrave, at least that's what the repair manual says, and it's in pretty nice shape, ladder and all.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Shit, this'll be pretty strong. You sure it won't fry her?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Oh, it'll fry her alright, it just won't kill her.' 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad was quite sure of his facts and the fact was, Beth had to shit herself, which meant her turds had to ascend and she'd already let a little squeaker slip out when Sally'd screamed so terribly (nicely) when her nipples got bitten off. Brad had cleaned up after her and didn't mind doing it at all. But he wasn't into the scat shit, neither one of us was. But Beth was about to scatter her shit all over the ceiling if she couldn't go regular.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Please, I need the bathroom badly.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'How long's she been saying that?' I asked like I was concerned.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Twenty minutes, maybe a half hour tops.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'We better get her down then unless you want a big mess to clean up. We can put her back up after. When they get scared like that, they can get the shits, like diarrhea all over the place and her.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Yeah, I guess you're right.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I know I'm right, so I'll hold onto her as you cut the rope. I'll catch her.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad paused for a moment, like he had something on his mind, like a better idea.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'No. No, just let her fall. I want to see her crumple to the floor with a crash.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Sure. Whatever turns your crank. Get the step ladder.'

Page 113.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beth had taken in every conceivable word and meaning we had passed between us. We weren't being quiet nor secretive about it. We wanted her to know, to anticipate the terrors to come. She knew it might be the only chance she ever got to smack back at us. It was one of those things where she didn't think she could do it but how could she not try?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad was up the ladder, spry as a chimp, and readied his sharp knife. He sawed back and forth a couple of saws and down she crumbled like a collapsing upside-down hung woman in a house of cards.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad's imagination knew its stuff.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Boy was it entertaining to watch her flopping and squirming around like a fish out of water being stepped on. She executed the predictable gyrations and gripped onto her ankle with two hands and then exploded into the unpredictable.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She summoned up an adrenalin explosion and went nuclear. Before either of us knew what she was up to, besides six foot two, she grabbed onto the leg of the aluminum ladder, which was tossed off to the side, and used it to steady herself to get herself upright and then started to wield it like an unwieldy base ball bat. She had murder in her heart and veins and she swung with a few extra g forces.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She teetered as she lashed out, but not enough to fall over and she swung so hard she almost found her balance on the floor.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was trying to knock by block off and I objected.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Woah, Nelly. Take it easy. Shit. I didn't suggest we electrocute your cunt. He did. Why you so mad at me?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad had a sheepish, guilty, startled grin on his face, but not for long.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Yeah, bitch. It was me. Stop trying to kill him. Here I am instead.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beth was too smart or desperate to fall for our good cop, bad cop, Laurel and Hardy, routine. We were both dunderheads worthy of having out peckerheads wacked off. Besides, we weren't taking her entirely serious which infuriated her more. She was already a raging bull then dumped into a sea of red. She added piss and vinegar to her adrenalin cocktail and became like Wonder Woman all super strong and righteous and fighting evil where ever she found it.

Page 114.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fuck, could she swing that ladder. Too bad. Brad had my little gun except he couldn't get to it because she was between it and him. But I wasn't, at least that's what he tried to tell me.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'It's under..'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And that's as much as he got out before the hard top platform of the step ladder crashed into his groin just above his pubic hair. Fuck, did he double over instinctively and I couldn't hear what he stuttered out. Chair? Couch? Chair and ouch? Couch? 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I dove to see under the couch and the gun cupboard was bare.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beth was so fast she was trying to hack away at me with the ladder then too. Brad was no fucking good for anything right then and would remain so for a couple of minutes. He wasn't sure his nuts hadn't been compromised but then again if she'd slugged him full to his package he'd have been tits up and lights out. As it was, all he was doing was staggering around like a drunk sailor on the 
wharf, trying to keep from falling down into the drink. He was wheezing pretty good too and was trying to cradle his groin which wasn't the easiest place to reach to do that.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I had scrambled away from Beth, gunless, and she almost smashed my hand and trigger finger.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was a fool's game. That's what it was turning into and something else incredible and unbelievable had happened.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sally had got Julie untied and Julie was doing the same for her. She fumbled furiously at the cord. It was like her fingers were become wet noodles, but she was nearly successful. They could hear the battle royale emanating from the living room and the ladder and had to send reinforcements.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Julie scrambled her fingers even more furiously to get the last wrist knot confining her friend loose. And then it was done.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They should have snuck up on us to surprise us, but they didn't. They charged full tilt like a couple of female bulls, balls and all, right into the fray. 

Page 115.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sally was a chain saw on wide open throttle.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We'd bit her nipples off and she intended to bite some dicks off and she intended to make the Texas Massacre look like a kid's lemon-aid blood-bath party.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And Julie was so incensed at the indignities I'd forced her to initiate, making love, making fucking hate, that's all it'd ever been even if her cunt did respond to my massaging stimulus. She hated her clit too, at those moments, but no where near approaching the loathing and contempt she held for my dinky balls.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was up for making them into dinky boy toys and juggling them right to the ceiling and nailing them to a barn door if she could find a big enough sledge hammer and even longer, bigger spikes.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But then too, it wasn't as if she really wanted to sever them. She wanted to get them into a car crusher with me attached. She was fucking turned pure evil and it didn't faze her, it didn't even scare her but it scared me some, and Brad too. She needed to collect some qualms or we'd be dead for sure and we needed to collect our asses out of there with some due diligence and urgency.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And Beth. Beth saw Sally's missing nipples for the first time and decided upon cold blooded murder.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad was a bit nonplussed. What had I gotten him into?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He'd been minding his own business, in the restaurant, and they minded his business and then I did too. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What was written across his fore-skin?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Putz. Sucker. Spineless weakling?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Right then, 'Pecker Power' it wasn't.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad and I were sorely outnumbered both in numbers and intent. The bitches, the three amigos were advancing on us like a plague of feminist hatred and just retribution and there's nothing more dangerous than self-righteous, full of indignation vaginas hell bend on bending some macho masculine balls all out of shape and twisting them clean off.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fuck, was this the end of us and we'd only just started?

Page 116.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sally had lost the most so it seemed she felt she had the most to gain from revenge. The others were a fright and a danger but she was become an unholy terror and she also felt&nbsp; I was the bigger risk so she should aim the full strength of her rage at me while she still had it. The only thing, not in her favor was, she was the youngest and the lightest, which I supposed counted for two disadvantages and her chest was burning sore again from where her nipples had once been.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was scrumping around flailing my arm under the couch for the gun that wasn't there and I was pretty well prone with my belly to the deck. She saw her chance and charged and leapt into the air and came down her full weight on her knees into the small of my back trying to break my gutless spine.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I can't say it didn't injure me, because it did. It's just that it didn't hurt, at least not that it registered but what did hit home was she had grabbed my noggin between her fists and was clubbing it to the floor. She was trying to bust my nose, to bloody it, and I managed to turn my head to the side just enough to keep her from busting it but she smashed my cheek and hurt my forehead. She wanted to stamp on my foreskin.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And then as if I didn't have enough predicaments, Julie wanted a piece of me too. She wasn't about to let the phony lovemaking session go unavenged and she charged for my feet to grab my ankles and spread my legs. They both wanted my foreskin.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The one thing my balls knew for sure was she wasn't about to go easy on them, if she could get at them, and she was in a position to do a pretty good job of that and I not in one to stop her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And then Brad,&nbsp; you had to love him, like Lord love a duck, even though he had his hands full with Beth trying to murder him, he saw my dire circumstance and made a break away from Beth and managed to tackle Julie about her shoulders while he was on the run. I suppose the rugby guys would call it a classic flying tackle as he propelled her off my ankles and rumpled her into a rolled up ball on the floor. Sally had to look see what he was up to and that was her first big mistake of many little ones. She should have stayed concentrated on numbing my skull instead of seeing if she could help Julie out.

Page 117.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I had just enough maneuvering room to draw my arm, my fist back and pop her a little jab to her mouthy mouth. I split her lower lip in two places and her upper one only once but it all mashed up against her hard front teeth so the blow almost knocked her out too. She was still conscious but pretty stunned, and she had the dumbest pissed-off look on her bloody lips, but of course, it gave me my second punch and it was a doozy, a real hay maker.  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fuck the niceties.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I aimed right for her throat and smashed into her larynx. It sounded like I'd slit her throat instead of just bashed it. Her esophagus clamped in on itself from the shock and she couldn't get a drop of air. She wheezed and strained to suck some life in and her face was near turned blue and white with fear. I needed to be sure she wasn't going to rise to the occasion, so I upper cut her so hard into her gut her stomach threw up a moment later. She could choke on her vomit too, so she was doubly imperiled.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As bunged as my back was, other things took priority.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Julie had righted herself and came charging back at me all she-devilishly and I just managed to deak her. I was a pretty decent soccer player so it came to me naturally, to side step her, and I planted a good thump, a good round hard fist into her pussy.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Well talk about a drunken stagger and a drunken stooge. She managed four steps forward and three back which was really quite heroic, I thought, before she collapsed on top of Sally, pretty much incapacitated.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I hadn't heard from Brad and peered around to see his face redder than a beet. Beth, the six foot plus, amazon had him right off the floor by his gullet and his legs dangled uselessly trying to relieve the pressure. His eyes were froggy, like bulged right out and he gave me a pleading look. I whirled about and charged Beth right at her knees. I crashed into her sideways and it jimmied her kneecaps and twisted the joints. She fucking howled out and let Brad drop, but the big lug fell onto me instead of the fucking floor. Even with him momentarily aiding their cause by being tangled up on me, Beth figured she was better to flee than to keep fighting and she had long, powerful legs that could sprint faster than our short stubby ones. She flew past us like an express train and headed right for the door to the outside. The only thing she hadn't counted on was I'd nailed it shut, a nail through the bottom into the floor. It was just a prudent simple precaution that didn't take much doing. She'd heard the pounding but thought it was one of the others getting hammered.

Page 118.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She yanked on the knob, twisting it furiously and couldn't jar the door. She saw us rumbling after her down the hall, like a two part Godzilla advancing, and she gave up on getting outside and stormed into the bedroom where we'd all been before. She managed to get that door closed and locked from the inside.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad didn't even say a word. He took off into the living room, retrieved the gun from under a really intricately carved antique side-board and raced outside for the window for the bedroom Beth was confined in. It was a good thing he did. The window was small, but Beth could fit through, but not easily and her legs and ass were half out, hanging there, when Brad jammed the gun barrel right into her labia. She was dismayed and paralyzed. Her hopes of escape being dashed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You fucking freeze or you're gonna lose it. I swear I'll blast your cunt right up to your tits.' He'd yelled it so loud I could hear it from within and I loved how he threatened.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She wailed a little and then went limp and hung on the window ledge half in and half out of the room. I'd shouldered the door open, breaking the jamb, and couldn't believe the welcome sight that hung there before my relieved eyes.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was like she was snared and I could see Brad's head bobbing and weaving outside the window as he twisted the gun barrel deeper and deeper into her pussy. God, he wouldn't have to shoot her to puncture her womb, the fucking barrel was going to do it for him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Everything was better. It all was becoming under our control once again. I strode right up to her and took hold of her hair hanging all down around her face.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I yanked her head up to see me.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So what do we have here? A rabbit? A fucking jack rabbit? You think you're bugs bunny or the road runner?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She didn't think anything of the sort. She felt she was doomed, they all might be.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I wasn't about to be gentle with her. There was too much at risk.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad called to me through the window.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I got the gun jammed in her cunt. Should I blow her apart?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As tempting as it was to say yes, I figured we could save that for later.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'No, don't. I think I got her here. She's not fucking going anywhere. At least not alive, now.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I'd just owned up to, just revealed that we were going to kill them but Beth was too fazed to respond. At least she didn't show it and I suspected she stored it away for the next time they got to fight back at us.

Page 119.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Why can't life be predictable?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Why can't life be dependable when you need it to be?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All of a sudden, Brad wasn't there. What the fuck? The gun was out of her twat so I had to deal with her alone and he was no where to be seen from inside the bedroom.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beth thought it was a bit of an opportunity and angled wildly trying to free herself out of the window. She was like a teeter-totter trying to get her feet to the ground outside and me pulling on her head like a pump handle trying to drag her all the way into the room. It was a bit of a stand off but I certainly had the advantage of position and leverage. I gave her a mighty tug by the hair and budged her another foot in onto my side of the line. Her arms strained at the window frame and her feet jerked all about but she was being dragged into the maw instead of escaping it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And then just as suddenly, I heard Brad before I saw him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Try anything, one fucking thing and I shoot your brains out. Do you understand?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For a moment I was confused until I saw another cunt standing there all up tight at Brad's gun point.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They hadn't said anything about expecting another friend dropping by. I guess in the hope she would rescue them or at least get to the cops for help.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was pretty well a double for Evangalene Lilli, of Lost fame.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She had the same serious know it all attitude and evident superiority. She was better looking than the others so I supposed, in retrospect, life had done us a favor. She was convinced, regardless of the situation she'd walked in on, she would be able to fix it. She would prevail. No man had ever gotten the better of her and it wasn't about to start then.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Fuck man, what you got there?' I called out to Brad.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Another one. One of their friends. She says there's a party tonight.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Another drunken bash, I assumed, and they'd already had one the night before. Had these bitches no shame or self-restraint?

Page 120.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We both knew that was a big and significant deal.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'When? When the fuck when?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was anxious to know.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I don't know for sure. She says she's early but I don't know if I believe her.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I didn't believe her. She looked like she'd lie in an eye blink to save herself and the others.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Fuck man, we gotta get them out of here then. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then Brad and I experienced synergy as we sprang into compelling action. He seemed to know instinctively not to fuck around with the new one and clubbed her across the back of her head with the pistol butt and she folded to the grassy earth. He bagged her up and carried her into the house.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We got them into the living room, all laying face down and proceeded to re-secure them and things got a little bit hairier.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad was at Beth.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He'd spied the battery and jumper cables all at the ready.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'What are you doing?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was arranging the sparky stuff.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I don't give a shit. She's got it coming.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He wanted to electrocute her labia and it wouldn't take long.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It wasn't a wise thing to do, but he asked me to give him a helping hand and I couldn't resist. Some requests aren't meant to be denied.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was like when a bag of money falls off an armored truck and the guards don't know. Should you keep it and spend it or turn it in? Keep it. Who in their right mind wouldn't keep it? And I'd be fucked if I was going to deny him, or me, his re-newly found focused pleasure.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We both got hold of Beth's head and pulled at her face. She was snapping like a turtle trying to bite one of our hands off or at least a few fingers. Brad knelt on her throat and compressed her enough she had to concentrate on breathing (again).
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Punch her. Punch her in the gut.' Brad encouraged me,
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I could see the eminent sense of that and gave her three good stomach thumps. Then she really couldn't breath and Brad gave her a good head shot for safer measure. And she was pretty well a stunned broad but she wasn't unconscious yet.

Page 121.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We jerked her legs apart. Brad hadn't tied them when he was securing her, so he must have had some idea what he still wanted to do with the cables. We pinned her ankles by kneeling on them and Brad aimed the first jumper clamp with the nice big hungry teeth right for one half of her labia. He pulled out on her lip to elongate it and then let the jaws clamp shut into her meat, bite into it, you might imagine. Well holy shit and mother of multiple fucks, did she holler. She screeched and wailed but didn't have the good sense to pass out.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now it was my delicious turn.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I stretched her other labia lip out two inches and sunk the clamp's teeth right into her crease. I was trying to nail some of her clit too.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her eyes rolled in their sockets like spinning tops and she went into a freeze inside her body. She was rigid like a good stiff dick, paralyzed with fear and pain and the realization of what was to come next as we headed for the other ends of the jumpers and the battery.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The air was alive with the anticipation of electricity as Brad looked at me and I focused on him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Should we or shouldn't we?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As if there was ever any real doubt.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Talk about a shower of sparks and frying meat. It was just like the electric chair when it failed to electrocute to death and the poor schlub attached, convulsed in spasmodic agony and smoked and sizzled. Her bush near caught fire as it smoldered and hissed&nbsp; and both her lips turned coal crisp black like onyx. She was conscious only for a couple of seconds after the current found her but still she twitched and convulsed involuntarily. The brain works on minute electromagnetic impulses and our six volts way overloaded her system and reached right into the heart of her reflexes center.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now six volts might not sound like much, but to the nervous system it might as well have been a mighty lightning strike. But it was the amps and this one was a heavy duty battery for a fire truck's needs. I mean, a six volt&nbsp; transistor radio battery, the sort of rectangular ones, you can touch the terminals to your tongue to get a tingle and, in fact, to see how much juice they have left. How much of their life has already been used up. And I supposed, in a way, that wasn't dissimilar, in that we were using a good bit of her life up too. A tenuous connection but it had some validity, at least it did to me, and I was the one whose outlook determined how their futures unfolded and for how long.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And that was ever the bitch, when they felt they had no future, they weren't nearly the fun, nor as entertaining. As long as they had hope, they had real fight, but when it was mutilated out of them, then their sporadic flare-ups were more reflex and instinctive than any concentrated plan to break free. It was both a pity and pitiful how they languished in destitute hollowness even long before they actually died. They were spiritually dead, emotionally deprived but still had lots of orifices to penetrate and to rearrange. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anyhow, Beth was a sight for sore dicks and Brad and I looked at each other in satisfied amazement and the other three of her friends were appropriately horrified.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Lilly star look-alike (I'll call her Lily) was almost out of her gourd in disbelief. She wasn't sure at first she'd seen it right but then realized she couldn't be that wrong, that it couldn't be faked, that Sally's nipples were missing and now Beth's vagina was roasted and fried dry to a crisp. She'd never lubricate again and fucking would be plenty painfilled.

Page 122.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since she hadn't been buggered or beat up yet, other than a knock out clout to the back of her head, she still had all of her unabated strength, fury and determination.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since Brad had captured her, he got to do the honors of tying her up and spanking about her pussy for the first time. She'd been semi-conscious when he'd done that and then came wide awake to witness the other horrors I just mentioned.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad hadn't paid as much attention to securing her as he did molesting her and her wrists weren't properly secured. She gave a hard wrenching tug and freed her fists to come at me with them pummeling like an insane boxer on steroids and LSD.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The bitch was strong and fit and knew she had nothing to lose because she had everything to lose. She leapt onto me like a chita and sank her teeth into my shoulder at the top. She was aiming for my neck, even my throat, like the jugular, but she missed. But still she knew instinctively to go for my balls and cracked me a good knee right into my groin. Well, Brad hadn't been much good for anything before when Beth was strangling him, hoisted by his throat off the floor, but now I was good for absolutely nothing, good for fucking fuck all. The bitch wasn't satisfied she'd bit me and nailed my testicles, she wanted to gouge my eyes out too and was shoving her thumbs right into my eye ball jelly sockets. There was a good chance I'd never get to see another mutilated or regular cunt again.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I wished the fuck I knew where Brad was and then I did.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lily's head was yanked back violently and he thrust the point of his knife right up under her chin. She strained to keep the tip from piercing her throat but a trickle of blood was already working its way down to her tit valley. He stepped back with her, to distance her from me while I tried to recover. I scrunched my own fists and the palms of my hands into my eyeballs, trying to get the pain in them to subside or at least settle down. A couple of minutes later I could passably see again but fuck had she given me a headache, like a dozen compounded, pounding migraines. And that was nothing compared to the pain in the balls in my sack and my shoulder was like it was on fire as it bled quite remarkably.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad called out to me through my fog.

Page 123.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You want me to kill her? I'll fucking slit her throat for you. Just give me the word.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I had to be careful I didn't give him a false signal since I could barely speak coherently and I didn't want her dead that easy. I had so much pay back I owed her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I shook my head to say no, and sort of croaked it out.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'She's mine. The fucking cunt's mine. Don't kill her. I want to kill her cunt.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He dragged her back further from my agony and belted her a good spine shot and then knocked her out cold for a second time. He was fucking good at that, one punch to the skull and she was burnt toast.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This time he tied her wrists proper behind her back but he left her legs loose. He thought I might have some revenge staying on the end of my penis and if I did, I'd want her conscious for it so he smacked her cheeky face until she was revived. She spat and hissed at him and let out with the longest line of invective and string of profanities imaginable but they were only words and didn't hurt either one of her rapists.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I staggered to my feet and sort of did aerobics, like a work out to get myself back together again and collected. Brad had rifled off for the elastoplast bandage tape and he patched up my shoulder. He was a pretty decent male nurse.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I sat me down on the couch and had a few stiff drinks before I was ready to exact my prick's revenge.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finally, I got up resolutely and marched on over to my attacker. She was rolled onto her back, with her wrists jammed off to the side and her eyes murdering me with the intensity of her hatred. Standing over her like a trophy hunter towering over a fresh kill, I stripped off all my clothes, every last stitch.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I grabbed my package and fondled it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'So you wanted to rupture this did you? You fucking cunt, you wanted to bust this?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The past tense didn't apply.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She still wanted to.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Very much so.

Page 124.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I put my foot onto her belly like I owned her and she recoiled and squirmed under my touch. She didn't expect it, but I stood my full weight, one hundred and seventy pounds right into her bread basket and her fucking stomach ached right away. Her face had puffed up like she was trying to blow up a balloon and then I dropped down onto her to straddle her hips with my bare crotch and pin her shoulders to the floor.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I moved in to kiss her yelling mouth and she snapped her face side to side to prevent me from doing so. It wasn't hard to grip her cheeks to force her head to be still and I gave her the smacker I was up for. She did not kiss me back at all and was intent on trying to bite my mouth.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I pulled her head forward, from behind, until her chin almost touched her throat and I smacked her skull back with a decent thud. She was dizzy, like dozzy but not knocked out and it did hurt. Even her eyes and ears hurt from the near concussion.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Want another one?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She wasn't quite so defiant as some of the shit and vinegar was knocked out of her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Brad, give me the gun.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Like lickety split he handed it off to me and I made a big production of cocking it and placing the barrel tip between her teeth into her mouth.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now she was froze.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She didn't fight a stitch.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And all she could see was murder in my burning eyes.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It appeared as if I was struggling with myself whether or not to actually shoot her but that was only what seemed to be. I knew I was going to rape her and do it good, and like eminently and I only wanted her good and scared more shitless.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After enough terror time passed I let her know.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I'm going to fuck you. I'm gonna fuck you now and you're not going to do a God damned fucking thing about it. You get it?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The gun was still jamming her tonsils, or where they would have been since she'd had them out as a kid.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You fucking understand?' I barked it at twice the volume and three times the command.

Page 125.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She didn't want to die. She didn't want to fuck either, but it was the lesser of two evils and if she could stay alive she could repay me when she seized the chance.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She nodded that she understood and I extracted the gun from her yap.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I went right back down and kissed her and she kissed me back as much as her pragmatism would allow.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I started to fondle her breasts and she was a fucking princess. Her tits weren't large but they were the nicest of the whole bunch&nbsp; and her nipples hardened as I yanked her jugs out from under her tee shirt and out of her bra.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You saw her, didn't you? You fucking saw her?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I motioned to Sally with the missing ones and she didn't say but her look did.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I'll do the same thing to you. The exact same fucking thing if you fight me. If you fight me at all, yours are gone too.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was like my words were frying her cognitive powers and she sort of glazed over, like tranced and something inside her broke. She loved her breasts, considered them one of her best features after her cheeky face and didn't want them mutilated. She wanted to keep her nipples (as if Sally hadn't) and the unreality of it all just sunk in like a stone going to the bottom of the sea, even seven miles down.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It couldn't be happening to her, to them her friends, but it was and now she had to let more and worse happen. She zoned out to calm herself and I had no trouble getting her jeans off and into her panties.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her cunt was like a silent offering, a silent sacrifice to my cock and she was willing to put it up, to give it up to the cause.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In fact she was a bit too willing and I had to, we had to, do something to unwilling her and what better way than the boosters?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I pushed the palm of my hand to her crease and rubbed pressure back and forth until she lubricated up nice and sweet wet. She smelled like a cunt sundae. I fingered a bit into her labia taking little stabs at her clit but nothing mean or too invasive. She could tolerate it and willed herself too. But her face said she hated it and me to boot.

Page 126.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad could read my twisted mind. It was like he could read my crotch too.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Out of the blue, he asked. 'You want them?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I supposed there were a number of possibilities for the 'them' but he just seemed to know what I'd been thinking.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Sure, why not? Why the fuck not? Let's see what she's got.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lily perked up since my fingers weren't probing her anymore and I was looking over to Brad retrieving the jumpers.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The thing about them was they were still imbedded in Beth's fried, crisp labia lips and Brad just knew they'd be a hoot to extract.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You wanna help?' He invited me.' &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Fuck, sure. Sure. This should be fun.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beth was catatonic, but not unaware, as she watched the two of us lumber towards her like little ape neanderthals with our knuckles dragging on the floor and it all seemed like in slow motion.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We dropped down to her groin and smoothed her thighs out and kissed her each, to the side of her face, and I got one onto her lips and we both groused a tit and then kissed the jumper clamps, biting into her. They were a part of her now, fused to her flesh and she never thought about how much it would hurt if they were unattached.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I took gentle hold of one and moved it slightly and her face freaked into a twisted mess and mass of horror. I tugged on it slightly but hadn't made any effort to open the clamps and the teeth they included. She was brittle and I thought a little black chunk broke off, like a burnt pie crust. Brad watched in fascination as I went to open up the jaws. As they released, her labia wouldn't pull free of how they were imbedded. It was like a burnt marshmallow on a stick, all crisp but gooey too underneath and I wasn't sure if a fast rip or a gradual easing off, was the route to go.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Fuck, is she ever stuck to it. Look how she's fused right onto it. Fuck is she buggered.' Brad was amused as he let her know.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And as if I had to tell him to look. His eyes were glued wide open in amazing disbelief how erotic it all looked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'What do you think? Should I just rip it loose?'

Page 127.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Sure, why not? You do it that way, and see what happens and I'll do mine slow.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Wasn't that so rich. One of her labia was his. It belonged to him and not to her, what was left of it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And, of course, her other one was all mine.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Pin her. She's going to fucking freak.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad used his upper body weight to fasten her hips to the mat and I opened the clamps as wide as I could. They were pretty strong like most jumper cable clamps are, and I tore away on them.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tore away, I couldn't have chosen more apt words.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My half of her fucking labia came right along with them.  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Torn away.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fuck.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Geeze.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fuck and geeze.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How do you describe a missing labia lip?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And one that was still there but clamped?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The crazy thing was, how much of her was hanging of my side of the jaws I held in my hand.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was like road kill in a rat trap.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And Beth had twisted to the side and exploded into awareness.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her hips gyrated and thrust as she tried to shake loose the other side. Brad could see there was no point in trying to extract it slowly because she wouldn't stay conscious long enough for him to enjoy her feeling it. He repeated my actions and now she had no fucking lips to fuck or lick or kiss or piss out of.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And she was dead-stone, out-cold unconscious.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We both looked at each other with smug satisfaction knowing she was going to be some specimen to fuck when we got back to doing that to them.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lily had watched in complete disbelief and now did even more so as we approached her with the flesh dripping from the clamp claws. We couldn't possibly believe we were going to get away with putting them on her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Your turn bitch. What did you think of that?' We mused and joked at her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now she didn't give a fuck about her nipples anymore. She'd seen what'd happened to Beth's labia, she'd smelled it when she was being roasted and now this. She was torn asunder, at least her feminine part was. She'd be all damned to Hell if the same cruel fate was going to befall her pampered and tailored cunt. She was a neat freak about shaving her cunt into a tidy pattern and she was about to truly freak.

Page 128.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She went into flying conniptions, like flying fits as she saw me heading, the first clamp jaw for her labia lip and I never, in twenty victims, saw anyone flap and flop about so much. She was like quicksilver. Like the loose end of a snapped crane cable jerking in the hurricane and we could not get her calmed down. A greased pig with WD40 added would have been an easier target so the only thing we could do was hoof her, boot her to put the boots to her. It didn't take many cracked ribs before she was subdued.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We punched her like a bag a few more body shots and she was enough incapacitated we could do whatever we wanted with her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My cock was up, and up for it, so I wanted to fast rape her before her clit got fried.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad could sanction that since she'd done such a number on me and it took me five minutes to spunk her cervix.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She protested the usual volley of no's and don't's but nothing special nor original. She didn't even think to threaten me anymore as I thrust her and kissed her squirming mouth.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I eased out of her, my cock all slimy.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You wanna do her before?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Tell you what, I'll do her after?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I gave him a big grin. He never let me down.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We clamed the first jaws onto her labia and the teeth sunk in and she moaned sharply. It was a scream but muted and constrained like she couldn't get all of it out. It was trapped in her gut, in her brain where all thought originates.
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beth's meat was still attached so it was a meeting of the meats, so to say. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We connected the other jaws and now it all escaped. Her moan turned into a full blown thrashing shriek and her face was so twisted it looked like a wrung wet towel and her mouth was so wide open we both could have stuck our dicks in at once for some buddy, buddy fellatio.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She tried to but didn't pass out.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We circled around to the battery and he was all ready to make the remaining connections.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Hold on. Wait a sec. I wanna see this right up close. The moment of destruction, so to say.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The cables were fifteen feet long so they had lots of slack.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I sat on the couch and motioned to him.

Page 129.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Get her here.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He dragged her over by one ankle and we hoisted her onto the couch and onto my lap so she was laying across my knees and thighs. She was strung and slung across my lap to perfection. Splayed and displayed for all the heavens to see and certainly our greedy, beady little red eyes. Fuck was she opened up for business.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her upper body was resting, twisted onto the couch and her legs dangled spread onto the floor. I fastened my hands to her hips like vice grip pliers and looked right down into her crease and how complete she still was and motioned to Brad.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I gave him the nod.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He touched the other ends to the battery terminals and I swear her cunt near exploded so much it blinded me. I guess I had my nose too close to her clit because some of the sparks and flying meat shit showered me with little pock mark burns and even though I had to squint to protect my eyes, I could see her labia flesh boil and bubble and sizzle and glow ruby red before it fried black just like Beth's.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was so out cold and buggered to the nth degree but I motioned to Brad.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Another one. Give her ten seconds.' &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As he did, I shoved in on one of the clamp handles to get it further up into her canal so there was some fresh meat to fry.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her hips bounced wildly, her ass slapping my lap and she pissed and crapped herself a full load of shit and a gallon of urine. Why can't these terrified bitches do one or the other? Why do they so often have to mix the two together? No stamina, I supposed. No fucking tolerance for genuine pain, for real cunt felt agony.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Awh God. Awh shit, that's disgusting. Look what you made her do.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And we both laughed at her sudden incontinence and degradation. We left the clamps imbedded in her so it took a few extra minutes with the pails of hot water and towels to get her pristine again but we enjoyed doing it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Things had settled down and I asked him, 'You still want to fuck her before we take them out of here?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As if that was ever in doubt. He'd wanted to fuck her from the moment she'd first crossed into his view and he'd pointed the gun at her nipple which poked through her stretchy sweater. She thought he was aiming it at her heart, but he wasn't. He wanted to bud blast her right from first sight.

Page 130.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He got his boner to the ready but Lily wasn't readied yet.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'We'd better get the clamps off her. You won't get you pecker into her between them.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was thinking he might like to try but one look and any fool could see that was impossible. The clamps dominated her opening and blocked our views of her labia but we both knew they were fried good. It wasn't quite as difficult, for some unknown reason, to extract the clamp jaws from her meat. We just snapped the teeth open and they came free which surprised us both after what Beth had endured, being torn apart and all.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was already but the stubborn thing was, he couldn't get his bat into her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When I'd shoved the arcing, sparking clamp up into her, I'd fused her fuck canal closed and ram as he might, with all his might, he couldn't penetrate her enough to satisfy his knob head. He fumbled about for as few jabs and was like an inexperienced kid, and he was a bit embarrassed at his folly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'OK. OK, later. Enough already. We'll fix her later and then you can, we can do her.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He accepted the inconvenience and we were near ready to go but Brad just couldn't be done with her quite then.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He snapped one jumper jaw onto one of her nipples. It actually got a good chunk of her tit too, and one of the teeth was nicely imbedded dead center in her bud. And then the other one onto the other one.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He looked to me for the OK, like permission.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He still didn't fully understand he didn't need it, but I nodded and he connected.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. No doctor, tailor nor candle stick maker.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tits can boil.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Figure it out. They're full of liquid. The milky shit and all that stuff, and ducts and lobules which are the little sacks of fluid. Indeed, as surely as a cunt can be ruptured with a steel hammer, the little milk sacks would super heat and sizzle. And it helped that her tits weren't that big, maybe a 34b, so there wasn't so much flesh for the current to travel through. Less resistance, so it retained greater intensity which I believe is basic to your elementary electrical engineering and physics. It was excellent tit torture etiquette anyhow.

Page 131.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So it all can boil and do it very nicely together, I'll thank you, like two tits at once about the same amount.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Steam fired out of her nipples, like a steam iron with a pulse setting, burning them from the inside going out and her breasts expanded rapidly, like to a 36dd as the liquid boiled inside her skin. I do believe if we'd left it any longer her balloons would have burst and their guts blown out. And then she's have two flat tit tires.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We disconnected the juice and her jugs stabilized and now there was a visible black fry line directly connecting where the clamps had made inroads into her nipples and they looked like black beetles. They weren't reddish anymore so we figured, incorrectly, she wouldn't be much good for suckling. But it would just take her forever to heal and we all had forever. Except ours would be longer than theirs. But that was a whole other story.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We looked at each other in sheer amazement and amusement and I commented a wise crack.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I bet her bra doesn't fit anymore. She needs bigger cups.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He chuckled and gave me a good natured back slap and we knew we were done. Time could be getting short.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'We'd better get a move on before any others arrive.' I suggested.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'What am I going to do with this?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He looked puzzled as his prick pointed straight out to the wall. It was a delicious dilemma which I didn't share at the moment. My flaccid Freddie wasn't at the ready.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I dunno. Stick it in her ass. There's nothing wrong with it. Nothing yet, ha ha, but hurry.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was a speed demon. He flopped her face down, spread her cheeks and butt fucked her inside of three minutes and it eased the ache in his loins. All he'd needed was a hole to jerk off into and that's pretty well how he'd handled it and her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bang. Bang. Very much thank you, ma'am.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It took us another twenty minutes total to finish up and get the four of them trussed up and secured in the back of my van. It was quite a weight for it, six bodies, but I drove carefully and was considerate of it almost being overloaded and nothing went wrong driving the four hours to my hideaway.

Page 132.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now Brad was a bit of a hound, even by my standards. But that was just fine with me. He'd been saving up for years while I'd been doing it even longer.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had to go visit them in the cargo area. I'd constructed a sliding, strong wooden door to block off the back from the front and I suppose if I hadn't mentioned my ingenuity he would have just gone along for the ride with me, until we got there.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But I'd bragged a bit how I'd made up my rape-mobile, or more accurately, my kidnap-mobile and then he knew he could get to them while we drove merrily along our ways.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I'd installed an overhead light so the windowless compartment could be lit up bright, by flicking a switch under the dash.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Let me go back. I want to mess with them. That fucking last one. I still want her cunt.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It never occurred to me not to agree but I had one condition.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Sure. Sure fine, but leave the trap door open. I want to hear you fucking with her. I want to hear what she has to say. Pull her fucking gag off if you're going to mess with her.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He lumbered into the back and had such an abundance of targets but he did focus on Lily after a few smacks to the others. What a sweet sound that was, hearing him belt them. Their eyes were all squinty from the harsh new light that illuminated their horrified faces all.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He got to Lily and after some fumbling I could hear her meek pleas.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'No. No, please don't. You hurt me already. You both hurt me and my rectum hurts. Did you assault me there?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I don't know if I assaulted you, but I sure as hell fucked you there. So I guess. yeah, it was an ass-ault. Ha, ha get it an ass ass-ault.' Brad loved playing with words just the same as me.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lily mewled. 'Why? Why? What did I ever do to you?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Why? You stupid cunt. Why because I couldn't get my prick into your cunt. It's fused shut, like there is no hole.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She started to go hysterical and wailed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'No. God, no. How? Why? Please.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As it turned out, things hadn't been going so well for her lately.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'No, please. I can't. My sister, my twin sister, she was just killed in a car accident by a drunk driver.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'No shit.' I called out from the front.

Page 133.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now she knew I was hearing every word as I drove and she didn't like that either.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Fuck when?' I asked more.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Two days ago and we're still arranging for her funeral. That's why I came early to let the girls know they should cancel the party. So please, have some consideration.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Shit, you.. A drunk driver. Should kill all the bastards.' I exclaimed self-righteously. But one thing I could attest to, I never drove drunk. Why invite the cops to notice me for that discretionary reason?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Yes. You're right and he killed two of her friends.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Oh shit man. You said your twin sister, so she looked just like you. Was as good looking as you? What about her friends? Were they good looking too?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She had no idea of the significance of that and was pissed at the question. How could I be so insensitive. And she wouldn't answer, but I wanted to know.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Brad, make her answer.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'You heard him. You want me to belt your cunt?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Oh, God please no. Yes. They were beautiful. One was a catalogue model and the other, just a mother. But she was beautiful too, she could have worked with her friend if she'd wanted to.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'God damned it. What a fucking waste. All that prime cunt meat wiped out in a blink. Geeze, now that was a genuine waste, don't you think Brad?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He didn't answer but I could hear some struggling.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Brad. Brad.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He grunted.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Brad? What you up to?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He finally got back to me.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Fuck man, I was eating her out, or at least I was trying to. I can't even get my tongue very far into her. What did you say?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'I said it was a fucking waste, three cunts being wiped out in one smack. Don't you agree?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Sure. Shit man, of course. Can I get back to her french fried lips?'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Yeah, eat one for me.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I paused to reflect.

Page 134.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Just leave some for me.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was amused at the sounds of him trying to slurp her and her groaning in abject disapproval and I got to thinking about how life was treating her so badly, sort of all philosophical or what.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I mean, her friends, her dead friends, shit. Oh the nipples, the abundance of nipples and none of them pierced at least not by me and of course all the unmutilated cunts. Now that was a crying shame. Talk about lost opportunities.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And Lily. Sometimes it seemed to her as if the hand of God, that was guiding her, was the backhand of God and He could cuff with the best of them. And it really just pissed me off that three prime pussies should get off scott free from being wrecked and ruined. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I figured the same indiscriminate principles applied to air liner crashes when everyone was killed. I mean some of those stewardesses are pretty hot and take Rick Branson and his Virgin Airlines, I mean what a fucking name for an enterprise and I'd bet my ball sack the beautiful women just flocked to him like bears to honey, all that money and power plus he wasn't half bad looking. Many would say rugged and handsome. And I'd be really surprised if there was one ugly or fat stew tending even one of his flights to Siberia if he had planes headed there.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One wumph, and all the cunts dismembered, just like the car crash.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Many years ago, I once had occasion to visit a plane crash site just hours after the incident. I had a fake press pass and used it judiciously to clear past the cops guarding the perimeter. It was the crash of July fifth, nineteen seventy of an Air Canada DC8 and a hundred and nine, all on board, were killed.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Visit:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://www.super70s.com/Super70s/Tech/Aviation/Disasters/70-07-05(AirCanada).asp

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I don't know what I'd expected to see, but then again I supposed I did, morbid curiosity and all. I thought there'd be an airplane laying there recognizable, perhaps with a wing or two broken off. What I saw was a fucking garbage dump, a municipal waste site. There was no piece you couldn't have fit into a standard sized shopping bag and many were smaller than that. And the body parts hanging out of trees and at all odd angles. The plane had slammed into a wooded area and then shattered into an open field. And believe it or not, some early arrivers had been stealing wrist watches off severed arms and that was pretty low. If they'd been up for stealing random and loose tits, and the odd vagina or two, that would have been a different matter. Oh, the political incorrectness.

Page 135.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Incidental to that, a friend of mine had been golfing, not two miles from the crash site when the plane careened wildly overhead about two hundred feet off the ground. Now the plane is about a hundred and ninety feet long with a wing span of a hundred and fifty feet and it's pretty well at a right angle to the earth so the main body, the fuselage,&nbsp; is only a hundred feet up. There's an engine missing and the wing is flaming fuel and just after it passes him, the wing explodes right off. He fell flat to the ground peering up in his own terror as it thundered barely overhead.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He swore he could see lots of passengers all stacked up on each other against the port hole windows and even see the terror on some of their stricken faces. One pretty young girl, with blond curly hair, just embedded in his brain and nightmares and thirty seconds later they were all smithereens. Of course, being the sick fuck I was (and am still) I wondered what her little cunt would have looked like before it got obliterated.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So enough of my socially incorrect, and some would go so far as to say, morally incorrect rantings, back to Lily in the back of the van and Brad wanting to poke her fused-shut cunt.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As he got down to mess with her again, she started to revolt and they all tried to mutiny. Even though they were trussed up pretty good, they still could kick out and squirm and when you got four of them doing it at once, it destabilized the van.&nbsp; It was sort of rocking and lurching side to side and I almost went into a fish-tale.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I hollered back with concern.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Shit. Get them stopped. Either stop them or you stop. I'm gonna lose it.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Again he more than proved his worth and consistency.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He sighted on Beth and slugged her out cold with one punch to the cheek.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He aimed for Sally and flattened her unconscious with another excellent powerful skull smash.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And Julie took an extra jab to her face before she joined the others in sleepy slumber land.

Page 136.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then he could focus on Lily and do her the justice she so deserved. And I wished I could watch.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And the sounds were so intriguing I couldn't resist.
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I had to watch and be of help.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I took a small risk and pulled off into a deserted spot just off a deserted road.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I tumbled into the back to give him a helping hand and dick if need be. But he already had a helping hand in his hand.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I didn't realize he'd brought along the longest of their dildos, the Manhandler with the police baton style handle and ten inch insertable length, and he figured he could get her opened up again with it and then pecker poke her. The thing was like a pipe and almost as firm so his idea proved pretty well accurate.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Hold her fucking feet apart.' He urgently asked me.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I had no problem with that.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He punched her a couple of times just above her labia to soften her up and then worked the massive black knob of the dildo into her lips and right off hit the fused portion of her canal.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'OK. Fucking hold her tight. I'm gonna ram her. I'm gonna shove it into her belly.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And I'd barley strengthened my grip and hold on her when he tore it clean up and into her. Her eyes exploded open wide and she fell back unconscious and then it was easy for him to get his boner all the way into her. It only took him five minutes to spunk her and then he suggested I do a follow up. It took me another seven minutes to add to his gizz load.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We congratulated each other on our determinations and&nbsp; headed back to the front seats where we made small talk for the rest of the journey. We were relatively quiet and subdued, anticipating what we'd be doing next to them and eventually the only sound disturbing our silence was a re-awakened Lily hollering bloody murder about her ruined cunt. It got a bit tiresome after half an hour so I motioned to Brad and he slipped back and pounded her a couple of labia grunts and asked her if she wanted more.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That she didn't so she shut up for the rest of our peace filled drive.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And that was pretty well it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We were there.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And they were there, more or less in one piece.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And everything in our worlds was perfect.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Everything was in harmony.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And we truly were the harmonized rapists.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With a lifetime of friendship ahead of us.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Salute Brad buddy.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Couldn't have written it without you.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anon and.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
