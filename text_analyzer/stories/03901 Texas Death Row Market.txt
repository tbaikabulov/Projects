Texas Death Row Market
Provided By: BDSM Librarywww.bdsmlibrary.com
Synopsis: In the year 2014, state of Texas, was the first state to abolish death penalty. State of Texas would no longer maintain a death row; instead the inmates who committed violent crimes and homicide would be sold to anyone as a slave for the rest of their lives.She was driving through the open space, wondering whether she would make it
  on time. The speedometer of her sedan was showing about 50 mph on a two way
  road just off the highway. There was nothing but dust and dirt on each side
  of the road. She was not used to this kind of a terrain. She was from Eastern
  Massachusetts where one quickly gets used to seeing trees on one side of the
  road, and the ocean on the other. Being in Texas or the first time of her life
  really was a great experience for her. Before going on this business trip,
  she did her research about the state. She spent countless hours on Texas '
  history, its judicial system, death row, climate, people etc� She loved to
  do research since she was a kid, but now doing a research was part of her job
  and she loved it. She lived with the motto &quot;one should learn as much as
  possible&quot;. Therefore she always investigated, traveled, learned and saw
  a lot of things on first hand. 
When she found a new interesting story, no matter how scary or dull it might
  seem to her readers, she was there. Now another interesting story came up.
  This new occurrence did not only interest her but the whole world. She was
  now going to a house where the inhabitants were the first ones to buy a slave
  freshly from the death row market. That's what it was called now between the
  residents of Texas . &quot;Death row market&quot; initially consisted of 12
  inmates. First household to buy a slave of this market was living in the suburban
  town of Los Ebanos . This household was consisted of a woman and her 16 year
  old daughter. She couldn't imagine why they would want a slave in their house
  where there was no man around at first place. She also thought about the danger
  of having an ex-death row inmate around your house in the middle of nowhere.
  She actually had a lot of thoughts and questions in her head and in her notebook
  to ask, but now her first goal was to reach there on time. 
She considered herself a lucky journalist since she was going to be the first
  one to enter these people's home and interview them. She was also lucky because
  she asked the mother whether she could spend two full days with them to observe
  and see their new slave's behavior and how they react to it. So it was definitely
  more than an interview for her. She was going to experience the first ex-death
  row inmate's slavery first hand with the owners of him. She was very well excited
  and also nervous. Her work-mates called her crazy before leaving for this job.
  They considered it to be an extremely dangerous work to spend couple of nights
  with a death-row inmate under the same roof. But it didn't matter her, besides
  she always liked scary and dangerous jobs that no one dared take. 
When her sedan passed Los Ebanos sign, she looked at her watch and saw that
  it was just about the right time. She took the next right at the sing which
  said &quot;Calloway Residence&quot; and her sedan started its bumpy ride on
  a dirt road. The three story house of the Calloways were probably about a mile
  off the main road but it felt like it was about 10 miles off for her, since
  the dirt road was terrible to drive on. That's probably why they don't drive
  sedans around here she thought. When she came closer to the house, she saw
  a police car on the side, and immediately after, a police officer signed for
  her to stop. 
Officer: �Excuse me Madam; I am sure you know where you are going?� 
Caroline: �Yes of course. I have an appointment with Ms. Calloway, here is
  my ID� 
She grabbed her purse which was on the passenger seat, and took her ID out
  and handed it to the officer. 
Officer: �Alright madam; carry on please, they had been expecting you� 
Caroline: �Thank you� 
As she parked her car next to the garage, she saw two old pick ups parked
  in it. She thought I am really going to look like a rich snobby town girl in
  front of these people. 
She nervously came out of her car, took her stuff and closed the door of her
  sedan. As she turned to face the house, she saw the daughter of Ms. Calloway
  on the window. She waving her hand so she waved back. She went to the front
  door of the house went up couple of steps and saw both the mother and the daughter
  standing behind the door, smiling. Ms. Calloway was the one to open the door
  for the Boston Herald newspaper journalist. Her daughter stayed on her right
  hand side to make way for the reporter to come in. 
Ms. Calloway: �Welcome to our house� extending her hand. 
Caroline: �Thank you very much� extending her right hand. 
They shook hands. Caroline was especially surprised at how firm Ms. Calloway
  shook her hand. She must be one strong of a woman, Caroline thought. �She could
  have easily broken my hand� she said to herself. But being a reporter, whatever
  she thought, always stayed inside of her. She would never let her facial expressions
  or her body language to tell the story of how she was feeling inside. She learned
  that through being in this business for quite sometime. 
She let go of Ms. Calloway's hand and she extended hers to Helen's. Helen's
  hand felt much better after her mothers. Helen's hand shake was soft but firm,
  the smoothness of her skin was astonishing. Caroline could not help but think
  to herself that, she must be growing old for sure. For a moment she wanted
  to hold Helen's hand for longer to feel her skin. Caroline immediately thought
  of her days, when she was 16. She tried to go back, but she couldn't because
  Ms. Calloway broke the silence. 
Ms. Calloway: &quot;Would you like to have a seat in our living 
  room Caroline?&quot; 
Caroline nodded with a smile and moved towards the larger area where she thought
  was the living room of the house. Caroline asked Ms. Calloway to address her
  with her first name. She was going to spend a long time with this small family
  so last thing she needed was formalities on her side. But Caroline was sure,
  Ms. Calloway was going to formal no matter what. Just as Caroline was moving
  towards the room, she was also looking around, being aware of her surrounding.
  She was searching for a sight of a male, but she could not find any. 
Ms. Calloway: &quot;He is not here Caroline don't worry just yet&quot; with
  a smile. 
Ms. Calloway was not only strong, but also smart Caroline thought. &quot;What
  a woman&quot; she said to herself once again. 
Caroline: �No problem, I was just examining by looking around, we reporters
  tend to do that often, sometimes unconsciously&quot; 
The first thing Caroline noticed in the house was the paintings on the walls.
  From where she was standing she could see portraits of several women on the
  walls. They all looked very beautiful. She was impressed by the beauty of these
  women as well as the quality of these paintings. 
    
  Caroline: &quot;Who are they&quot; while pointing to a wall where 3 of them
  were hung 
    Ms. Calloway: &quot;Ohhh they are great aren\'t they? To tell you the truth Idon\'t know who they areeither. They are just some randomly painted women. As you can see thepaintings are wonderful.They cost me a lot of money&quot; smiling.Caroline: &quot;I am sure they are quite expensive, where did yo get them from&quot;Caroline was now totally concentrated on the paintings. They were sobeautiful that she was aboutto get hpynotized.Ms. Calloway: &quot;They were actually given to me by my mother. But after mydivorce, I wentbankrupt and they were taken away from me and put into your Boston Museum ofFine Arts&quot;looking a little irritated.Caroline felt a little anger in her voice. Ms. Calloway probably hatedNortherners she thought.She wasn\'t too sure of that but one thing was sure, Ms. Calloway was atypical Southern Bible Belttype of a woman. She was an attractive blonde with green eyes. She was verywell toned, despiteher age, her muscles looked firm and tight. That explained why she was stillso strong. She waswearing a tight mini- skirt which displayed her long beautiful legs andtight round ass. Sheloooked astonishing and no matter what the age, she could be the dream ofany men.Helen looked exaclty like her mother, only a little smaller version of her.It was a shame that Helenwas not as tall her as her mother. She stood about 5 feet 5 inches whereasher mother lookedabout 6 foot 2.Caroline: &quot;At least you managed to get these lovely paintings back. II amsure it was not easy totake them out of Museum of Fine Arts&quot;Ms.Calloway: &quot;Yes indeed it was not easy but there is nothing money can notbuy these days. Youcan even buy a man if you would like&quot; laughing.",1]  );    //-->
  side by side. 

  Ms. Calloway: &quot;Ohhh they are great aren't they? To tell you the truth
  I don't know who they are either. They are just some randomly painted women.
  As you can see the paintings are wonderful. They cost me a lot of money&quot; smiling. 

Caroline: &quot;I am sure they are quite expensive, where did you get them
  from&quot; 
    
  Caroline was now totally concentrated on the paintings. They were so beautiful
  that she was about to get hypnotized. 
    
  Ms. Calloway: &quot;They were actually given to me by my mother. But after
  my divorce, I went bankrupt and they were taken away from me and put into your
  Boston Museum of Fine Arts&quot; looking a little irritated. 
    
  Caroline felt a little anger in her voice. Ms. Calloway probably hated Northerners
  she thought. She wasn't too sure of that but one thing was sure, Ms. Calloway
  was a typical Southern Bible Belt type of a woman. She was an attractive blonde
  with green eyes. She was very well toned, despite her age, her muscles looked
  firm and tight. That explained why she was still so strong. She was wearing
  a tight mini- skirt which displayed her long beautiful legs and tight round
  ass. She looked astonishing and no matter what the age, she could be the dream
  of any men. Helen looked exactly like her mother, only a little smaller version
  of her. It was a shame that Helen was not as tall her as her mother. She stood
  about 5 feet 5 inches whereas her mother looked about 6 foot 2. 
    
  Caroline: &quot;Oh I am sorry. Well at least you managed to get these lovely
  paintings back. I am 
  sure it was not easy to take them out of Museum of Fine Arts &quot; 
  
  Ms.Calloway: &quot;Yes indeed it was not easy but there is nothing money can
  not buy these days. You can even buy a man if you would like&quot; laughing. 
    
    Calloway actually alreadydid buy a man, and she looked as if she was really happy by her decision.Caroline finallystopped staring at the paintings because of this jke, and saw a largecomfortable sofa where shecould sit down.Caroline: &quot;May I sit?&quot;Ms. Calloway: &quot;Of course dear, please relax our home is your home&quot; smiling.Caroline: &quot;Thank you&quot;Ms. Calloway: &quot;We will leave you alone for minute. We are going to kitchento fetch some snacksand drinks. I don\'t know hwo you fellows do up north but hospitality is veryimportant aroundhere&quot; looked very proud.Caroline: &quot;It is no problem, thank you&quot;Ms. Clooway and Helen left the living room and moved away from Caroline\'svision. This forcedCaroline to examine the surroiindgs a little more. There was nothing specialabout this houseCaroline said to herself, besides the paintings of course. It was a mediumsized home, with whitewalls, glass tables, grey chairs and a sofa. It looked likeMs.Callowey andher daughter was reallyinto electronics. They had a top class home entartainment center. One ofthose streous which hada funky shape with its small size, but could play quality sound and loudmusic. There were 3remote controls on the side table next to the sofa and Caroline did not dareto touch any of them.They looked way too complicated to be fooled around with. The house ingeneral as very bright.There was sun coming in from every direction. It had a very nice andrelaxing atmostpehere. Itdefinitely did not give any impression that it belonged to a slave owner andher daughter.After couple of minutes Ms. Callowey and Helen came in, each carrying a tray",1]  );    //-->
  Helen and Caroline both started laughing too. It was definitely true. Ms. Calloway
  actually already did buy a man, and she looked as if she was really happy by
  her decision. Caroline finally stopped staring at the paintings because of
  this joke, and saw a large comfortable sofa where she could sit down. 
    
  Caroline: &quot;May I sit?&quot; 
  
  Ms. Calloway: &quot;Of course dear, please relax, our home is your home&quot; smiling. 
  
  Caroline: &quot;Thank you&quot; 
  
  Ms. Calloway: &quot;We will leave you alone for minute. We are going to kitchen
  to fetch some snacks and drinks. I don't know how you fellows do up north but
  hospitality is very important around here&quot; looked very proud. 
    
  Caroline: &quot;It is no problem, thank you&quot; 
  
  Ms. Colloway and Helen left the living room and moved away from Caroline's
  vision. This forced Caroline to examine the surroundings a little more. There
  was nothing special about this house Caroline said to herself, besides the
  paintings of course. It was a medium sized home, with white walls, glass tables,
  grey chairs and a sofa. It looked like Ms.Callowey and her daughter was really
  into electronics. They had a top class home entertainment center. One of those
  stereos which had a funky shape with its small size, but could play quality
  sound and loud music. There were 3 remote controls on the side table next to
  the sofa and Caroline did not dare to touch any of them. They looked way too
  complicated to be fooled around with. The house in general was very bright.
  There was sun coming in from every direction. It had a very nice and relaxing
  atmosphere. It definitely did not give any impression that it belonged to a
  slave owner and her daughter. 
After couple of minutes Ms. Calloway and Helen came in, each carrying a tray
    Calloway put a glass of coffee to the side table next to Caroline and Helenput a plate full ofpastiries. They laid the trays on the glass table right in front of the sofaand each took their seatson a chair right in front of Caroline. They were just staring at her withcurious eyes. This madeCaroline get a little uncomfortable however as always her actions did notgive it away. Carolinewas a 5 foot 9. In frontof these Southern women, Caroline did look a lotdifferent. She had amuch darker skin than the two women staring at her. She actually looked muchmore LatinAmerican than an American from MA. She haddark black hair and big browneyes. She was thinbut fit. Her body looked a lot like Ms. Calloway\'s only it was weaker andless toned.Caroline reached for the cup of coffee and brought it to her lips. Coffeetasted really good. It wasdefinitely a different coffee from the ones she used to drinking.Caroline: &quot;This is great. What brand is this?&quot;Ms.Calloway: &quot;Well dear it is a Mexican one. Is it the best. I am sure youfolks up North do nothave this kind&quot; smilingCaroline: &quot;We certainly don\'t. I need to get a box full of these before Ileave here&quot;They all started laughing at this joke. They all started drinking and eatingand Ms.Calloway brokethe silence once again.Ms. Calloway: &quot;So tell me, this is the first time for you in Texas right?&quot;Caroline: &quot;Yes, that\'s correct&quot;Ms. Calloway: &quot;So how do you like it so far?&quot;Caroline: &quot;Well it is an interesting state for sure. It is much differentfrom Northeast that\'s for sure.It is going to be great experience for me to be here. I should travel thecountry much more&quot;",1]  );    //-->
  full of goods. Ms. Calloway put a glass of coffee to the side table next to
  Caroline and Helen put a plate full of pastries. They laid the trays on the
  glass table right in front of the sofa and each took their seats on a chair
  right in front of Caroline. They were just staring at her with curious eyes.
  This made Caroline get a little uncomfortable however as always her actions
  did not give it away. Caroline was a 5 foot 9. In front of these Southern women,
  Caroline did look a lot different. She had a much darker skin than the two
  women staring at her. She actually looked much more Latin American than an
  American from MA. She had dark black hair and big brown eyes. She was thin
  but fit. Her body looked a lot like Ms. Calloway's only it was weaker and less
  toned. 
Caroline reached for the cup of coffee and brought it to her lips. Coffee 
  tasted really good. It was definitely a different coffee from the ones she
    used to drinking. 
      
  Caroline: &quot;This is great. What brand is this?&quot; 
  
  Ms.Calloway: &quot;Well dear it is a Mexican one. It is the best. I am sure
  you folks up North do not have this kind&quot; smiling. 
    
  Caroline: &quot;We certainly don't. I need to get a box full of these before
  I leave here.&quot; 
    
  They all started laughing at this joke. They all started drinking and eating
  and Ms.Calloway broke the silence once again. 
    
  Ms. Calloway: &quot;So tell me, this is the first time for you in Texas right?&quot; 
  
  Caroline: &quot;Yes, that's correct&quot; 
  
  Ms. Calloway: &quot;So how do you like it so far?&quot; 
  
  Caroline: &quot;Well it is an interesting state for sure. It is much different
  from Northeast that's for sure. It is going to be great experience for me to
  be here. I should travel the country much more&quot;
    Ms. Calloway: &quot;Yes you should. This country is not only made up of couple ofstates in Northeastas you know, but I am sure you have been to states like California,Florida.Everyone loves thoseplaces. And when people visit Texas, they never come near this ghost townanyway. It is way toofar of from any other interesting and entartaining town really.

  stupid. A lot of people actually called her decision to spend couple of nights
