Synopsis: An English man is sick of illegal immigrants taking money from the economy. He needs to find a solution to the problem ....






�No use to society� by andy28_rl@yahoo.co.uk

James had never met another person who had the same extremist views as himself.&nbsp; Usually people didn&#8217;t like illegal immigrants and the detrimental role that they played on society.&nbsp; Usually people agreed with him that they added no real value to British society.&nbsp; But he had never met anyone who had the same singlemindedness and determination to eradicate them from society as Matt appeared to do.&nbsp; James ran his finger around the top of his pint glass and contemplated if this was the person he had been seeking.&nbsp; If he felt confident enough to show Matt what no-one else had seen.&nbsp; If Matt would like what he saw, and not go to the authorities.&nbsp; With Matt on board, James could step up his operation.&nbsp; He could increase his productivity and his profit.&nbsp; It was all well and good to have a 100% profit on everything he produced, but he needed an overseer who would push those profits to higher and higher levels.&nbsp; He felt sure that Matt would be the man&nbsp; to help him do it.
It was an hour later.&nbsp; James and Matt were driving through the heart of England in James&#8217;s battered old range rover.&nbsp; The picture postcard setting of the English countryside, rolling hills as far as the eye could see under the dark rain cloud of an Autumn afternoon.&nbsp; Only the sound of the windscreen wipers punctuated the silence as James contemplated if he should warn Matt of what he was about to see.&nbsp; He had told him already that he went out into the streets of London to actively seek out illegal immigrants.&nbsp; That he selected only those men who were young, desperate for money, fit enough to work hard.&nbsp; That he worked them so that they could contribute in a meaningful way to British society.&nbsp; And that their idea of the golden opportunities to be made from the British taxpayer were soon revealed as a pipe dream to them: their reality in working for James was very different.
Matt wanted to see it for himself.&nbsp; He didn&#8217;t know the full reality of life for the illegal immigrants in James&#8217;s employment.&nbsp; But, as the range rover drove under the mechanised gates of James&#8217;s estate, he realised that James was a man of considerable wealth and land.
The rain dissipated as the two men exited the range rover and walked towards a large cinder block building, located behind the manor house in which James lived.&nbsp; James smirked to himself as he considered that Matt was about to discover his secret.&nbsp; At last he had a kindred spirit who could share in his world and understand the reasons for his activities.&nbsp; He approached the computer keypad and typed in the six digit code that opened the heavy metal door to his factory.&nbsp; �Welcome to my world!� he smirked, leading Matt inside the cold and damp building.
Matt had expected an office.&nbsp; A reception area.&nbsp; Instead, he was confronted with a bare concreted room.&nbsp; Its only adornment a shower in one corner.&nbsp; James walked briskly through the cold, dark room and reached a second heavy door.&nbsp; With a further punch to the keypad, he stepped through the door into an inner chamber.&nbsp; Matt walked in behind his host and the door closed behind them.&nbsp; With a whir, Matt felt a ceiling fan creak into action and bright fluorescent lights lit up the scene before him.
At first glance, the room looked like a prison block.&nbsp; Matt stood at one end a long central passage.&nbsp; The floor was again concrete, with drains at either side of the central passage.
�I&#8217;d like you to meet our illegal friends Matt,� James smiled and motioned Matt towards the first cell.&nbsp; Matt walked towards the dimly lit bars of the first cell and peered inside.&nbsp; His mouth dropped open as he stared at the creature inside the cell.
The cell itself was not long enough to allow its occupant to stretch out.&nbsp; The man inside sat in the corner of the cell, his legs hunched up before him.&nbsp; James produced a long cane from the wall next to the cell and wordlessly prodded the inhabitant of the cell.&nbsp; With a yelp and a start, the man stood up before his captor and spread his legs as far as his chains would allow.&nbsp; Matt looked at him in amazement.
The man inside the cell was stark naked.&nbsp; Of Eastern European descent, his head had been shaved down to a stubble and his pubic hair had been shaved away, making him look young, vulnerable and subhuman.&nbsp; The miserable young creature looked pitifully at Matt, and Matt stared at the large �1� which was tattooed both on his forehead and his chest.&nbsp; He stared at the boy&#8217;s face and stepped closer to look at the contraption locked on his face.&nbsp; A metal ring through his nostrils pulled down his septum and was attached to a further heavy ring pierced through his tongue.&nbsp; The result was that he was unable to speak, his tongue pulled out of his mouth and upwards, rendering him a mute and an animal.&nbsp; Matt smiled.&nbsp; This young man had experienced the removal of his humanity.&nbsp; He was not going to trouble the British people: he was nothing more than an animal, a piece of cattle.
James smiled as he recognised Matt&#8217;s excitement.&nbsp; He resisted from making any comments and drank in the humiliation of his animal slave.&nbsp; He recognised a flicker of hope in the animal, as it saw another human being for the first time in over a year.&nbsp; Other than its fellow animals, it had not seen anything new in twelve months.&nbsp; Certainly not a free person.&nbsp; Matt continued to examine the body of the animal in front of him, moving his eyes over the heavy metal collar around the animal&#8217;s neck down to the animal&#8217;s shaved genitals.
James beckoned the slave to approach the bars and it did so quickly, afraid to incur the wrath of its owner.&nbsp; Only too aware of the consequences of doing this.&nbsp; With a smile, he reached inside and pulled the slave next to the bars by its imprisoned penis.
�The filthy animals used to wank themselves off when I wasn&#8217;t looking.&nbsp; Suppose it was inevitable being kept permanently naked and no access to any sexual stimulation.&nbsp; So I decided to take away that possibility: doesn&#8217;t interfere with their work any more.,� James stated in a matter-of-fact way, before encouraging Matt to explore the slave&#8217;s genitalia with his hands.
Matt gripped the slave&#8217;s penis and felt how stretched it was.&nbsp; He realised that the dampness of the penis was because the slave had pissed itself and he looked down in disgust at the shit running down the back of the slave&#8217;s legs.&nbsp; The head of its penis was adorned with a&nbsp; heavy metal ring which reached inside the piss slit of the animal.&nbsp; This heavy ring was then embedded deeply into the animal&#8217;s flesh, using its belly button as an anchor point.&nbsp; The result was that the animal&#8217;s cock was stretched permanently upwards, flat against its stomach.&nbsp; 
Matt looked deep into the eyes of the animal as he explored its penis.&nbsp; He felt his own cock lurch inside his trousers as he noticed the utter dejection and humiliation of the animal before him.&nbsp; As he watched tears sting the corner of its eyes, and heard the heavy chains around its ankles.&nbsp; The slave raised itself on tiptoes, trying to avoid the pain of its penis being stretched too far.
Sergey had long given up any notion that he remained a human being.&nbsp; He had come to England to find money for his family.&nbsp; To work hard and return home rich so that his son could be given an education.&nbsp; He was only 20 and his wife and 2 year old son were no doubt desperate for some news of him.&nbsp; He didn&#8217;t know how long he had been an animal, but it was months.&nbsp; Probably over a year.&nbsp; All he knew was that his cruel owner had taken everything from him.&nbsp; Everything.&nbsp; His humanity and his life.&nbsp; And now he had lost all hope.&nbsp; His life as a free man was over.&nbsp; He knew that escape was impossible.&nbsp; He accepted that he was destined to spend the rest of his life in abject misery, living as a naked slave inside this prison.&nbsp; He stood naked before the two free men and hung his shaved head in shame.
Matt turned to James and smirked.&nbsp; �How many of these have you got?�
�Twenty two.�
�Fuck man.&nbsp; Awesome.�
�No use to society� Part 2 
�Want to see them?� James asked with a smirk.&nbsp; �Want to see my herd of slaves?�
Matt pulled away from the bars and nodded, unaware of the fact that he licked his bottom lip in anticipation.&nbsp; This was turning into a most stimulating afternoon, and he adjusted his eyes to the dim light as he stared down the long room in front of him.
James turned behind them and pressed a large button on the wall.&nbsp; The room was filled with the sound of metal grating along the concrete floor, as the front bars of each tiny cell slid to the side.&nbsp; There was also the unmistakeable sound of movement from the cells, as slaves got to their manacled feet.&nbsp; James reappeared at Matt&#8217;s side, and waited until the sound of the doors had ceased.&nbsp; With a smile, he walked down the centre aisle, with Matt following behind him.&nbsp; The sound of their boots as they walked down the aisle was now the only sound in the air as both men walked slowly through the slave shed.
Matt looked into the small cages as he travelled down the aisle.&nbsp; Each one contained a young male slave.&nbsp; Each slave facing the rear wall of their cage, their legs spread as far as their ankle chains would allow and their hands spread against the wall to the side, equally manacled by their wrists.&nbsp; Each slave&#8217;s face touched the wall in front of them, each waiting no doubt for permission to be able to exit their cage.&nbsp; Matt noticed the filthy colour of each slave.&nbsp; Clearly they were not allowed to wash, their arses and legs coated in filth, their own excrement and thick mud coating the lower halves of their legs.&nbsp; The brands of their ownership numbers clearly marked on their arses and standing out amidst the filth.&nbsp; And yet every one of them was in prime physical condition.&nbsp; Their bodies were youthful and athletic.&nbsp; Their backs showed a perfect musculature, their arses were pert and their legs perfectly formed.&nbsp; These were men in the prime of their lives, reduced to prime livestock.&nbsp; Their lives wasted in absolute misery as nothing other than animals.&nbsp; Helpless.&nbsp; Degraded.
�They&#8217;ve been trained what to do from the moment their cell door opens.&nbsp; They know better than to piss me off,� James growled.&nbsp; �They learn that obedience is the only solution if they want to avoid punishment.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t accept any free thinking from these animals.&nbsp; If they forget that, they are punished severely in front of the rest of the herd.�
Matt nodded in appreciation and chuckled to himself.&nbsp; �This is awesome.&nbsp; They are basically just animals then aren&#8217;t they?� he stated, his eyes widening at the possibilities of owning twenty two naked animal boys.
�Totally, yes.&nbsp; That&#8217;s how they are treated and how I expect them to be at all times.&nbsp; They learn that they are not human anymore.&nbsp; They can&#8217;t communicate now of course with their tongues chained to their noses, and they don&#8217;t have freedom at any time.&nbsp; Their cocks and legs are always chained up.&nbsp; The number tattooed on them also enforces their status.&nbsp; They are under no illusion of what they are.�
Matt and James reached the end of the room and James entered a small ante-chamber, returning into the room dragging behind him a large plastic container filled with a dark mushy substance.&nbsp; As he spoke to Matt, he poured the substance into a channel that ran along the concrete floor, in front of the cages.&nbsp; He then moved to the other side of the room and poured the same amount into the opposite channel.
�I love looking into their eyes.&nbsp; They are so ashamed of what they have become.&nbsp; A mixture of fear and hatred in their eyes when they look at me.&nbsp; They were all prime hunks in the prime of their lives.&nbsp; They thought they were invincible and had beaten the authorities.&nbsp; Crept over the border in the backs of lorries without any identification.&nbsp; Agreed to come and work for me when I promised them riches.&nbsp; And look at them now, naked and in chains.&nbsp; No longer tough macho guys any more.  I know they would overpower me if they could.&nbsp; They would try to regain their freedom if I gave them half a chance.&nbsp; But it won't come.&nbsp; They are destined to a life of slavery for the rest of their lives.&nbsp; I have many ways of controlling them."�
James chuckled aloud, and Matt jumped as a shrill whistle pierced the air.&nbsp; Two naked slaves appeared from their cells, shuffling down the centre aisle towards their Master as fast as their chains would allow.&nbsp; Number 3 from the right hand side, and number 14 from the left.&nbsp; Their anxiety to please their owner making them look ridiculous as they stumbled forward, their numbers prominent on forehead and chest and their cocks stretched upwards in front of them, mocking the fact that they were once men.&nbsp; They reached their Master in tandem, and fell to their knees before James, head facing up towards the man who owned them and had sentenced them to a life of degradation.
�They never get treated with compassion or any acknowledgement that they are human.&nbsp; I always treat them as dumb animals,� James sneered, looking down at the two naked men who grovelled in front of him.
Matt looked down at the two slaves in front of him.&nbsp; Both were muscled, well built young man.&nbsp; He estimated them to be in their early twenties.&nbsp; Their handsome faces looked up and Matt noticed the fear and humiliation in their eyes.&nbsp; He wondered how such virile young men must feel, so enslaved and beyond any hope of release into the free world.&nbsp; He noticed the fact that their feet were black, the soles engrained with thick dirt.&nbsp; These men had forgotten the luxury of clothing, of footwear.&nbsp; They had clearly become hardened to a life of naked hardship.
He noticed that the slave on the right, number 3, had an erection that was causing him considerable discomfort, pulling on the chain link attached to his belly button.&nbsp; Matt knelt down before the miserable young creature and reached down to its erect penis.&nbsp;&nbsp; Feeling the dirt engrained on the slave&#8217;s cock, he recoiled back at the smell of the unwashed animal.&nbsp; Living in filth, the animal&#8217;s body reeked of earth and of shit.&nbsp; Forbidden any cleanliness.&nbsp; The slave gasped as Matt touched its cock, pulling it away from the slave&#8217;s body and relishing the total shame in its eyes.
�When do they get to cum?� he asked, looking at the blushing of the young straight boy who was powerless to stop this free man pulling on his cock.
 �Occasionally I let one of them cum for my own amusement, or as a reward.&nbsp; It's a good motivator for the others when one of them is placed on a bucket in front of them and allowed to cum.&nbsp; Of course, they lick up their cum afterwards - I don't like waste.&nbsp; But it doesn't happen very often.&nbsp; Some of them haven&#8217;t cum since they were enslaved.&nbsp; You cant think of yourself as a man if you are not allowed any access to your cock can you?�
Matt laughed as his eyes made contact with the wretched creature kneeling naked before him.&nbsp; Once a proud jock boy no doubt.&nbsp; Free spirited and adventurous.&nbsp; Once the girls would have flocked around him, such a handsome young stud.&nbsp; Now reduced to a nothing.&nbsp; An animal.&nbsp; A subhuman piece of meat.&nbsp; Nothing but owned property.&nbsp; He ran his finger along the bottom edge of the slave&#8217;s cock, eliciting a groan of desperation.&nbsp; With a sneer, he pouted a face of mock pity and stood up again.
�Their wrist manacles makes it impossible for them to touch their cocks: their hands are held up and away from their genitals.&nbsp; No doubt they try to cum when alone in their cells at night by rubbing their cocks against things but it must be agonisingly painful.&nbsp; I am a heartless bastard, but they know what a whipping they will get if I see any evidence of cumming.&nbsp; Cumming is for free men, not for animals.�
The two free men laughed openly, looking down at the two humble animals naked at their feet.&nbsp; �Watch the power I have over them,� James chuckled.&nbsp; He reached forward and touched the slave&#8217;s mouth in front of him.&nbsp; Obediently, the slave tilted its head back, its mouth already open with the cruel rings exposing its tongue.
Matt watched as his friend hawked some phlegm, before leaning over the slave and spitting the phlegm into the slave&#8217;s open mouth.&nbsp; The thick goo rested on the ring through the slave&#8217;s tongue, before slowly dripping down over the animal&#8217;s tongue and into its open mouth.&nbsp; Matt chuckled, and made eye contact with number 3.&nbsp; In seconds, he felt the complete power over another man as he spat the contents of his mouth into the waiting slave before him.&nbsp; The two slaves were incapable of doing anything other than allowing their Masters waste to wash down their throat, their tongues stretched out in cruel pain.&nbsp; They knelt there and accepted their fate, powerless to resist their superiors.
James nodded to the slave boys in front of him, and both of them scurried to their side of the room.&nbsp; Using a brush which they held before them in their manacled hands, they pushed the pile of food along the channel so that it was spread before all of the cells before returning to their own cell.&nbsp; With a sharp whistle signalling food time, each slave knelt down in front of their cell and manoeuvred their heads down into the channel before them.&nbsp; With heads fully in the foul looking mixture, the slaves used their tongues as best they could to ladle food into their mouths.&nbsp; A long and time consuming process that was not over until James was satisfied that the slaves had eaten to his requirements.&nbsp; No slave looked up or moved its stubbled head above the channel as James and Matt watched the scene.
Twenty two muscular naked men, filthy and enslaved.&nbsp; Twenty two animals with no free will. Their individuality removed, now only a slave animal with a tattooed number on its forehead reminding it that it was forever an animal, never to return to the safety of its homeland and family.
 �No use to society� Part 3 
James looked down at the muscular naked animals, rasping their chained tongues along the dirty floor in front of him.&nbsp; He decided that the animals had eaten enough.&nbsp; With a blow of his whistle, the slaves leapt to their feet and stood, heads bowed, in front of their betters and Masters.&nbsp; Not one of them moved or spoke.&nbsp; Heads bowed.&nbsp; Humiliated young men who were once in the prime of their lives.&nbsp; Matt looked in amazement at the twenty two naked hunks in front of them: naked abused former human beings, their faces smeared in the filthy food mixture, their bodies caked in filth and their exposed bodies on full display with penises chained upwards for maximum degradation.
The slaves stood silently and still, their shaved heads bowed forwards so that they stared at their own filthy bare feet, as one of their number worked for its owner.&nbsp; One sweating hunk of naked flesh moved along in front of them and attached a heavy chain through the chain link in the front of their heavy metal slave collars.&nbsp; For the first time Matt noticed that the slave&#8217;s necks were rubbed red with the heavy iron around their necks and he realised how heavy their collars must be.&nbsp; How unfair it was to wear a heavy metal collar permanently locked around your neck, just for the amusement of your owner.&nbsp; Helpless to resist anything, living in naked misery.&nbsp; He approached the slave nearest to him, and pulled the boy&#8217;s head forward.&nbsp; Behind the collar was a crude bolt, rendering the metal collar permanently closed around the unfortunate naked slave animal&#8217;s neck.&nbsp; There was nothing they could do to remove the torturous symbol of utter slavery around their necks.
Matt smirked to himself at their total loss of any dignity or humanity.&nbsp; This was so perfect.&nbsp; Treating these hunks of male flesh like beasts.&nbsp; What they deserved.&nbsp; He looked down the line and noticed that every body was muscular and athletic, every face young and manly.&nbsp; Every man had a perfectly chiselled torso and legs under the grime of their slavery.&nbsp; Looking behind them he noticed the beautiful curves of their exposed arses, all lined in a row.&nbsp; How unfair they must find it to be taken from their youth, and transformed into owned cattle.&nbsp; How ironic that these symbols of unadulterated manhood would never feel the rewards of their hunky body.&nbsp; Unloved by anyone, let alone the female company that they must by now so desperately crave, and without any prospect of even being allowed to speak, let alone display any human characteristics to their fellow captive slaves.&nbsp;&nbsp; He imagined what it must be like to be alone in their tiny cells all night, their naked flesh shivering with cold, nothing to occupy their mind but thinking of their once free lives.&nbsp; Unable even to play with their chained cocks.&nbsp; A totally miserable existence, their young lives wasted away in slavery.

Twenty two young men sweated naked before Matt, silently living a life of pure misery.&nbsp; They truly lived a life of beasts.&nbsp; Here he was amongst a host of virile men and yet no one spoke, no one showed any sign of wilfulness, of youthful life, of humanity.&nbsp; Instead they stood silently, conditioned to total obedience.
�There are some pretty handsome fuckers here James,� Matt called, turning to look at James.&nbsp;&nbsp; The slaves who had been attaching chains to necks locked themselves onto the end of the lines,&nbsp; using a heavy duty padlock.&nbsp; Matt turned back to the gorgeous guy in front of him and raised the boy&#8217;s face to his.&nbsp; A beautiful stud looked back at him, chiselled jaw and perfectly formed facial features.&nbsp; Matt looked into the eyes of the boy in front of him.&nbsp; 
He could not be older than nineteen, his pale blue eyes flashing in his youthful face.&nbsp; Matt looked deep into his eyes and sensed his total humiliation and desperation at being so enslaved.&nbsp; He looked down over the boy&#8217;s naked body and grabbed his cock in his fist, pumping it up and down and feeling its warm girth.
The boy held Matt&#8217;s gaze.&nbsp; A mixture of desperation, denial and anger in his blue eyes, until the misery of his situation hit home, and tears misted over the blue eyes.&nbsp; A single tear ran down the boy&#8217;s cheek.&nbsp; A sign of his loneliness and degradation.&nbsp; Matt considered that this boy should be out drinking with his mates, should be playing football and taking home his pay to spend on his girlfriend.&nbsp; And instead he was here, destined to a life of miserable slavery.&nbsp; How terrible to be enslaved so young, to lose your freedom and your life to slavery.&nbsp; To know that animalhood was your eternal destiny.&nbsp; To not be able to hide your naked teenage body from the clothed men in front of you.
James chuckled.&nbsp; �I see you&#8217;ve found Nathaniel.�
�Nathaniel? Doesn&#8217;t sound like a foreign name.�
�No it isn&#8217;t.&nbsp;&nbsp; He&#8217;s English.�&nbsp; James came and stood before the naked boy.&nbsp; He ran his fingers down the boy&#8217;s cheek and under his chin, lifting his eyes to meet those of James.&nbsp; Nathaniel could not look at James, his utter shame apparent as his face blushed crimson and his body shook involuntarily.&nbsp; Matt sensed a bond between Master and slave, a strange bond that linked them in a terrible way.
�Nathaniel&#8217;s shame is utter and terrible Matt.&nbsp; He could have been a free boy.&nbsp; He could now be out living his life as free as you and me.&nbsp; He chose to become a slaveboy.&nbsp; I am sure he regrets it now.�
Nathaniel hung his head and Matt watched as the young boy sobbed, heaving with shame and misery.&nbsp;&nbsp; Matt&#8217;s mouth opened as the young man knelt to his knees, pulling the chain taut around his neck and causing the two bucks either side of him to bend at the neck.&nbsp; He looked up at James with desperate wild eyes, clasping his hands together in the form of prayer and begging for his freedom.&nbsp; He tried to form words but his nasty tongue-to-nose rings made his words unintelligible and so he wound himself into a frenzy of desperate tears.
Matt watched as James looked at the distraught boy, smirking.&nbsp; Nathaniel sensed the utter lack of compassion for his plight in these two bastards and uttered a desperate wail.&nbsp; Unlike the others, he knew every word that they uttered.&nbsp; He could understand them and it made his misery more complete.&nbsp; It made his reduction to an animal more unbearable.
�Why is he here if he&#8217;s English? He&#8217;s not animal stock,� Matt ventured, a pang of guilt and pity in his mind despite his rock hard cock.
�He&#8217;s my nephew Matt.&nbsp; I have always been like his father, always his hero.&nbsp; Spoilt him from being a kid.&nbsp; This was all meant to be for his profit too.&nbsp; I was sure he would help me.�
James looked at the sobbing young man at his feet.&nbsp; His eyes unblinking and his gaze unforgiving.
�He could have got a new car.&nbsp; Instead, he tried to threaten me.&nbsp; Said it was inhuman what I was doing.&nbsp; Threatened to go to the cops.&nbsp; So he disappeared.�
Matt wrinkled his brow in amazement and his mouth dropped open.&nbsp; �You enslaved your own nephew ?&nbsp; Made him into this?�
�Yeah, his parents are pretty devastated at his loss.&nbsp; They think he has disappeared.�
Nathaniel screamed a desperate cry and moved out to his uncles leg, wrapping his manacled arms around the jeans of his uncle before plunging to the floor and kissing his muddy boot.&nbsp; James looked down at the naked boy sprawled on the floor.&nbsp; He turned to Matt and smiled.&nbsp; Then turned away and walked towards the back wall, shrugging his leg free from the naked slave sprawled on the filthy floor.
�Saw your mate Dan last week Nat.&nbsp; He got quite tearful, telling me how much he missed you.&nbsp; He&#8217;s got a nice girlfriend now, he tells me.&nbsp; Pity you will never know what its like to have a girlfriend boy.�
He turned and smirked at the poor defeated boy, a former straight boy who now faced a life of hell shuddering in absolute despair at the thoughts of his former life.&nbsp; �I so wish Dan could see you now boy.&nbsp; See that cock chained up against your belly, all on display for your Masters.&nbsp; Now, you&#8217;d better be on your feet in ten seconds slave or you get the electric cattle prod,� James menaced.
And with a frightened squeal, the hunky teenager rose to his feet and assumed the position of his fellow slaves.&nbsp; Reduced to a frightened little naked boy, despite his bulky frame that now belonged to a young man.&nbsp; Naked and in chains, his chained penis shrivelled against his stomach and his legs caked in both mud and his own shit.&nbsp; The slave property of his uncle, no chance of regaining his freedom and the life of an English boy.&nbsp; His misery compounded in the double knowledge that he could have had the choice of freedom, and he was the only English slave amidst this pitiable sample of young human slaves.&nbsp; If only he had known what would become of him, he would have undertaken the role of Master.&nbsp; But it was too late now, he was destined to eternal misery and degradation as a humble farm animal.&nbsp; And the certainty of this knowledge rolled down his handsome face in fresh tears as he considered his free friends only miles away in the free world.
�He&#8217;s a good looking lad as well.&nbsp; Such a waste of a once promising life, living like an animal, isn&#8217;t it?�&nbsp; James stood before his former nephew again, whip in hand.
�He&#8217;s gorgeous,� Matt intoned, feeling his cock twitch again inside his clothes.&nbsp; Clothes that were so symbolic of the difference between him and the young animal before him.
�You can fuck him later if you want mate,� James stated, still staring at his slave nephew&#8217;s face.&nbsp; �He&#8217;s just one of the herd as far as I am concerned.�
Nathaniel looked up, his eyes wild in terror.&nbsp; He shook his head and pleaded with his eyes at Matt.&nbsp; Matt reached towards him and placed a finger behind his mouth chain.&nbsp; Pulling the boy&#8217;s face to his own so that he could smell the rancid breath of the naked beast in front of him, Matt stared into the reddened eyes of the miserable wretch of a boy.
�I&#8217;ll take you up on that later James.&nbsp; Something for me to look forward to.�
Nathaniel heaved a dry sob of despair.&nbsp; They had taken his life, his dignity, his humanity.&nbsp; And now they would take away his virginity.&nbsp; Fucked up the arse by his uncle&#8217;s mate.&nbsp; Nothing but a piece of meat and a degraded fuckhole.&nbsp; He snivelled and hung his head in shame,&nbsp; He felt his arsehole tighten involuntarily at the thought of its impending violation.
Nathaniel&#8217;s horrific image of himself as fuckboy ended as he screamed in subjugation.&nbsp; His uncle roused him from his misery, as he lashed across his chest and genitals with the whip.&nbsp; �Shut the fuck up slave boy and stand in your place with the other animals.�
And Nathaniel did, his mind numbed.&nbsp; A naked, helpless and vulnerable English boy in a sea of despair.
 �No use to society� Part 4 
Matt languished on his high stool, looking down at the activities before him.&nbsp; A host of twenty two naked animals, formerly young men, working silently in slavery under the whip of his friend James.&nbsp; James had definitely found a new way of treating illegal immigrants that made Matt happy inside.&nbsp; No longer would these illegals sponge from his tax money, from the country and from his hard earned wages.&nbsp; They were better off as naked animals, destined to eternal slavery in chains.&nbsp; Not even allowed the freedom to play with their penis.&nbsp; Matt reached inside his trousers and stroked his own engorged penis.&nbsp; He chuckled as he thought of fucking the young teenager Nathaniel later that evening, Nathaniel naked and helpless as his free cock plowed deep inside the young boy&#8217;s arse.
Below his balcony, Matt watched the naked animals scurrying around.&nbsp; Mute in their chains, they worked ceaselessly.&nbsp; Each one assigned a menial task in transforming vegetables from a raw produce into a ready-for-sale item.&nbsp; No slacking off or taking breaks for these animals.&nbsp; Each knew his simple role and carried it out with an urgency that reflected the desperation to avoid punishment.&nbsp; To avoid the heavy bullwhip that James carried menacingly in his hands.
Outside the factory doors, Matt watched the incessant rain as it poured over the glistening naked bodies of the slaves.&nbsp; He noticed the shivering of the former jock boys, as they carried in the armfuls of carrots and potatoes, backwards and forwards from the pile in the field into the factory.&nbsp; He laughed at their awkward gait, jogging along in their ankle chains through the muddy field and inside through the factory doors, depositing the vegetables before turning and running out again.&nbsp; A stream of eight naked men, helpless in slavery and freezing in the winter rain.&nbsp; Hours of their day spent in an endless monotony of running that could easily have been avoided had the tractor been driven for a few minutes more to the factory gate.
But James did not use machinery when slaves were cheaper.&nbsp; It cost nothing to have these slaves working endlessly for him.&nbsp; Their only cost was the food to make them survive: food that was ultimately only a mushed form of the vegetables that the slaves themselves planted and harvested for him.&nbsp; An endless conveyor belt of profits for James, and an endless life of humble misery for his animals.
Outside the doors, a pile of potatoes skidded across the ground as an exhausted slave stumbled in the thick mud of the field and landed face down in the thick, cold mud.&nbsp; Matt chuckled as he watched James lash the animal&#8217;s back with his whip, watching as the animal collected every potato from the ground and continued its toil.&nbsp; The creature was caked in thick mud and Matt noticed the tears and drool from its mouth as it continued its toil, no mercy from James.&nbsp; It dare not beg for forgiveness.&nbsp; It dare not scream for mercy.&nbsp; Like a frightened animal, it continued its work.&nbsp; Desperate to escape torture.
Across the factory floor, the slaves worked silently in their misery.&nbsp; Washing and scrubbing, peeling and then processing the vegetables into packaging.&nbsp; No-one spoke of course, none of them ever released for even a second from their eternal misery.&nbsp; Naked animals, working relentlessly for the profit of their owner.&nbsp; No prospect of ever attaining freedom from their eternal slavery.&nbsp; A day of silent work, before a night locked in their cells.&nbsp; No release from constant humiliation and degradation.
Matt smirked at the scene before him.&nbsp; Perfection.&nbsp; A system of slavery that had already made James rich and would also make him rich.&nbsp; He would help James to build up more slaves, to turn more human beings who were no use to society into beasts of burden.&nbsp; An empire of human animals to serve the economy and make them rich.
Matt stretched his arms into the air and savoured the thought.&nbsp; Savoured the absolute power that he held over these animals.&nbsp; And with a sickening crunch, he felt his insides burn before he crumpled to the floor in agony.
Staring up, he saw a fully dressed young man above him, the blue electricity from his cattle prod charging the air as he frowned at Matt, convulsing at his feet.&nbsp; Confused and dazed, he closed his eyes and felt the vomit rise in his throat.
On the factory floor, no one noticed that Matt was not sitting watching them.&nbsp; The slaves were too occupied in their silent misery, shivering in the cold and working relentlessly.&nbsp; If the slaves noticed the dark figure creeping through the shadows towards their Master, as he stood in the doorway of the factory, no-one made a sound.&nbsp; As the cattle prod burned into his spine, James had no warning.&nbsp; He crumpled to the ground and his face landed on the cold concrete.
Triumphant, Dan stood behind James and wrenched the whip from James&#8217;s fingers.&nbsp; Standing in the silence, he turned to the dazed slaves.&nbsp;&nbsp; The moment settled.&nbsp; The silence lasted.&nbsp; The slaves froze and dared not hope that this was real.
And only Nathaniel recognised his former friend.&nbsp; Nathaniel, the English teenager and now naked slave beast, stared at his friend in astonishment.&nbsp; His heart lurched as he thought of what he had become.&nbsp; He looked at his abused naked body, at the shit covering his bare skin.&nbsp; For the first time in months, Nathaniel thought of freedom.&nbsp; He thought of a life beyond slavery.&nbsp; Could it be possible that he would attain freedom ? Would Dan even recognise him?&nbsp; Startled and with a hesitating step, he stumbled forward towards his friend.&nbsp; Towards freedom.
