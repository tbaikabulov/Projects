His foot Goddess
By stryker53
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For as long as he could remember Max had wanted to be near female feet.&nbsp; There wasn&#8217;t a particular reason for it.&nbsp; He wasn&#8217;t abused by his mother or anything.&nbsp; In fact, if he even tried to touch her feet he was forbidden.&nbsp; The same thing happened with any of her friends or his other female family members.&nbsp; Most boys would take the hint, but not Max.&nbsp; Each rejection only made his desire for feet grow stronger.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As time went on and he entered high school and his looks improved.&nbsp; He could grow hair on his face.&nbsp; His long side burns drew the attention of plenty young women.&nbsp; Max found himself having the pick of the litter when it came to dating.&nbsp; All these women yet not one appreciated his passion for feet.&nbsp; Many of them knew each other and before long Max was known as the HS foot pervert.&nbsp; So much for the dating thing.&nbsp; No one wanted to be seen with him anymore. 
Snickers and sneers and haunted laughter followed him until he graduated.&nbsp; Then at 18 he decided to join the military.&nbsp; He learned of hookers and the likes.&nbsp; To think that women would actually have sex with him for only some money?&nbsp; How interesting he thought.&nbsp; Max was single and lived on base in the barracks.&nbsp; He ate in the chow hall, and they bought his clothes.&nbsp; He got paid every two weeks with nothing much to spend it on.&nbsp; So he decided to investigate this hooker option.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A buddy told him of a hot line where hookers put add on line.&nbsp; Max used his computer to find them in the local paper.&nbsp; He bought a paper and searched for a lady he thought might be able to feed his foot passion.&nbsp; It was ugly at first.&nbsp; He&#8217;d selected and called a woman who said they could meet.&nbsp; When he got to the restaurant and bought her an expensive meal she got around to asking him what he was into.&nbsp; Max whispered �feet and stuff,� to which the woman laughed and sneered at him.&nbsp; Max was brought back to high school again.&nbsp; He got embarrassed and stood to leave.&nbsp; He could still hear her laughter as she shouted, �A foot freak, what a looser,� behind him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That was it for Max.&nbsp; Not only could he not find a woman who understood his foot fetish, he couldn&#8217;t even buy one.&nbsp; He was crushed.&nbsp; Alone in his room he&#8217;d dream of such woman and masturbate.&nbsp; At least that way, he would be satisfied and not laughed at.&nbsp; It was frustrating.&nbsp; Once he went to a strip club with some buddies.&nbsp; They were all hooting and hollering over the half-naked women on the stage.&nbsp; One girl came out bare footed. Max whispered to his buddy that she had cute feet.&nbsp; The guy turned to stare at Max like he just broke wind.&nbsp; Then he yelled to the other guys, �Hey Max likes her feet, what a freak.�&nbsp; The men laughed long enough to fluster Max, and then continued tossing dollar bills toward the girl.&nbsp; That was the last time Max mentioned his foot fetish in public, to anyone!
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;About a year later, Max took a part time job driving cabs.&nbsp; He&#8217;d just about learned the town the base was in.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not that he needed the money.&nbsp; Max was bored.&nbsp; After work he had no friends.&nbsp; He was not happy drinking in the base bar.&nbsp; His last roommate got shipped out.&nbsp; He heard the money was easy to make.&nbsp; He only worked from 9pm until 3am the bar shuffle so why not?&nbsp; It occupied his time and put easy cash in his pockets.&nbsp; Besides, with all the army guys spending cash in the local bars, there were plenty trips back to the base, or to some gold digging girl&#8217;s house.&nbsp; Either way, he got good tips.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One night he got sent to an alley downtown.&nbsp; A door in a dark wall opened and out stepped a woman dressed to the nines.&nbsp; She had long blonde hair.&nbsp; Her face was made up.&nbsp; She had ample breasts and a knock out figure.&nbsp; Black silk stockings with red spiked heels that sparkled when she walked climbed in the back door.&nbsp; She gave an address which Max noted and the car drove forward.
Silence was the order of the day.&nbsp; Every once in a while Max peered in the rearview mirror only to see the side of her face as she stared out the window.&nbsp; He thought she must own the place he&#8217;d gotten her from.&nbsp; She had jewels and gold on her neck and arms.&nbsp; She wasn&#8217;t the ordinary west pacific widow he was used to.&nbsp; As he drove up to her address, his mouth dropped open.&nbsp; It was a large two story home.&nbsp; The fare was nearly 23 bucks.&nbsp; She threw a fifty over the seat and got out not saying anything. Max shoved the bill in his pocket and backed down the driveway.&nbsp; He never expected the large tip, yet he offered her no change.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Two nights later the dispatcher blared on the radio.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You got a special Max, be on time.�
The address was the same alley he&#8217;d picked up the classy blonde before.&nbsp; He was there the same time as last.&nbsp; Then that same dark unmarked door opened and she stepped out.&nbsp; She was still dressed up only this time in total black leather.&nbsp; Her long leather boots were knee high and as shiny as a new coin.&nbsp; She was dripping in pearls and gold around her neck.&nbsp; Even both wrists could fetch thousands.&nbsp; As she got in the back, again, not a word was spoken.&nbsp; Max remembered where she lived and drove in that direction.&nbsp; She was the most beautiful woman he&#8217;d ever seen.&nbsp; An angel fallen from above, he thought as the car rolled on.&nbsp; As he pulled to her front door, she tossed another crisp fifty over the seat to him.&nbsp; He started to tell her the actual price, but only heard the door slam in his face.&nbsp; She was mysterious and sexy at the same time.&nbsp; Without even admitting it to himself, Max knew, at her word, he&#8217;d surrender to her.&nbsp; If only she&#8217;d ever speak to him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;During the next two months Max was at the same pick up point collecting the tall blonde.&nbsp; It had become nearly a two or three time a week affair.&nbsp; Always the same destination, always in silence they drove.&nbsp; Oh Max had so many thoughts in his head about her.&nbsp; She seemed not to know he was even alive.&nbsp; In all the times he drove her, he&#8217;d never seen her wear the same clothes twice.&nbsp; She must really be loaded, he thought.&nbsp; She was always beautiful.&nbsp; She never had a hair out of place.&nbsp; Sometimes it was worn up on her head. Max loved it better when she&#8217;d wear her hair down over her shoulders.&nbsp; It was to him, her crowning glory.&nbsp; When the street lights shone through the back window, her lovely blonde hair would appear to take on a special glow.&nbsp; Max would just about give anything to touch it. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once as he&#8217;d snuck a peek at her in his mirror he caught her eyes.&nbsp; The moment he knew she too was looking at him he began to sweat.&nbsp; His hands jerked the wheel and the car swerved to the left.&nbsp; He gained control quickly enough.&nbsp; After the car was safe, he almost crashed it again when he heard her say,
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Careful Maxwell, I used to think you quite the good cabbie.�
Her voice, even in warning, was like that of an angel.&nbsp; Soft, sweet yet a tone full of intention.&nbsp; Max felt his heart skip a beat at the sound of it.&nbsp; He broke out in a sweat and gasped for breath.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Are you alright Maxwell?&nbsp; Do you need medical assistance or something?� she asked softly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh no Ma&#8217;am,� he stuttered, �I&#8217;m fine Ma&#8217;am.&nbsp; I was just, I mean, you never, well I mean Ma&#8217;am, ah, hmm�� He could not put a sentence together to save his life.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Smiling softly now, the lady said, �Its ok Maxwell.&nbsp; I think I understand.&nbsp; Without wishing to sound uppity, you are a man, and I&#8217;m beautiful.&nbsp; I astounded you by speaking to you so abruptly, I know.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Max began to settle down.&nbsp; She spoke so softly and spoke the truth.&nbsp; It was more than what she said, but how it sounded to him.&nbsp; And the way she said his name, Maxwell.&nbsp; It felt like she was his equal instead of his boss or something.
He cleared his throat and agreed saying, �Yes Ma&#8217;am you truly are.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I am what Maxwell, abrupt or beautiful?� she mused.
Flustered Max spurted, �No Ma&#8217;am you&#8217;re not.&nbsp; I mean yes Ma&#8217;am you are.&nbsp; Oh I mean you are beautiful Ma&#8217;am not abrupt I meant.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Shh, I know just what you mean Maxwell.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been called both from time to time.&nbsp; I&#8217;m somewhat of an enigma that way.�&nbsp;&nbsp; She smiled in his mirror.&nbsp; Max melted into his seat.&nbsp; She continued, �Have you ever wondered why it&#8217;s always you who picks me up at night Maxwell?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No Ma&#8217;am, I mean I&#8217;m the lucky one of the bunch to do so Ma&#8217;am.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No Maxwell, luck had nothing to do with it.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve had other drivers from you outfit. Most of them don&#8217;t get a block before they leer and grin and try to run their lame lines on me.&nbsp; As if I&#8217;m some piece of flesh for their trophy case or something.&nbsp; Foul mouthed no class beasts. The night you first drove me was the night I called your dispatcher.&nbsp; I warned that if one more, filthy mouthed, driver came for me, my friend the mayor would be calling his company.&nbsp; That was our first night together Maxwell.�
Max was confused.&nbsp; He knew nothing of this before.&nbsp; He thought how could anyone dare be rude to this heavenly creature?&nbsp; He apologized to her for the idiots.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No need to apologize Maxwell,� she soothed, �I&#8217;ve always been able to take care of myself.&nbsp; Besides, you&#8217;ve been the perfect gentleman, so young and neat and clean looking.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m twenty two Ma&#8217;am� Max said in defense of his age.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Outstanding Maxwell, you are indeed grown.&nbsp; Your only problem is you keep addressing me as if I were your grandmother.&nbsp; Tisk Tisk, all this Ma&#8217;am business.&nbsp; You make me feel so old.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve not passed 30 yet Maxwell, so how about you take to addressing me as Trudi instead of Ma&#8217;am?&nbsp; Would that be alright with you?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This was a night to remember.&nbsp; For months they&#8217;d rode in silence.&nbsp; Max&#8217;s only contact with her had been in his masturbating fantasies.&nbsp; Now not only was she speaking like they were old friends, she&#8217;d offered her name for his use.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes, Miss Trudi, thank you Ma&#8217;am, err I mean Miss Trudi.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She sighed and warmly said, �Then it&#8217;s settled, pleased to know you Maxwell.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Very pleased to know you too Miss Trudi.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�So Maxwell, are you gay?� Trudi shot out of the blue.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Shit no, ah I mean, that is, no way Ma&#8217;am, or ah, Miss Trudi.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t even think about that stuff.&nbsp; I mean some of the guys are and that&#8217;s cool for them, but no way, not me Miss Trudi.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�So very defensive Maxwell. I wasn&#8217;t belittling your manhood, rather only trying to figure out what makes you different from the others who drove me.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I can&#8217;t speak for them Miss, I only figured anyone who dresses and looks as fine as you do and who lives in such a large house has earned her respect Miss.&nbsp; I sure don&#8217;t earn lots of money.&nbsp; However, you always treated me nice.&nbsp; You must surely know it doesn&#8217;t cost fifty bucks to get to your home.&nbsp; Yet you always give me the same.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not a money worshipper but I sure would never disrespect my way out of it either Miss Trudi.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well-spoken Maxwell.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure your girlfriend is as proud of you as I am becoming.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Humph, that would be the day Miss Trudi.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve never been a pick em up easy sort of guy I guess.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Why Maxwell, I would have thought you to have a completely full little black book in your pocket, and well used at that.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yeah, right,� he sighed sadly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh poor poor Maxwell, straight, but not quite the ladies&#8217; man ehy?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This new found friendship had taken a rather strange twist all of a sudden.&nbsp; All this time she&#8217;d never paid him any attention, and now she was standing on hallowed ground.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now she was delving into his relationships with women, or lack thereof.&nbsp; Yet somehow Max felt it no threat.&nbsp; Her directness was buffered by her softness in speech.&nbsp; It was as if they&#8217;d known each other for years instead of months.&nbsp; She wasn&#8217;t attacking him.&nbsp; He felt he could trust her and share his entire life with her.&nbsp; There was still a remembrance of the pain and shame he&#8217;d felt when discussing his desires for women&#8217;s feet.&nbsp; He wouldn&#8217;t go there.&nbsp; Yet she was on the verge of finding out, if she kept on with her questions.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What&#8217;s troubling you Maxwell, why the long face?� she asked innocently.
It was that obvious, he thought to himself.&nbsp; Then he figured, what the Hell?&nbsp; He might as well spill it.&nbsp; She could do little more than those he&#8217;d told before, laugh, ridicule and dismiss him.&nbsp; So he&#8217;d lose her fare and the tips?&nbsp; Too bad, if she really wanted to know, he&#8217;d take a chance and spill the beans.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Miss Trudi,� he began, �this is rather personal and I hope it won&#8217;t spoil our new relationship none.&nbsp; You see, I&#8217;m not like most men I guess.&nbsp; When it comes to women, I fall to pieces.&nbsp; I mean all my equipment works and such, but just plain intercourse does nothing for me.&nbsp; No, I&#8217;m not gay or nothing.&nbsp; The thing is Miss; I can look at naked pictures all day long and not get excited.&nbsp; However, just one glimpse of a pair of soft sexy female feet and I&#8217;m like a kid in a candy store.&nbsp; I know, I know, I&#8217;m weird, I&#8217;m a freak!&nbsp; Believe me Miss Trudi; I&#8217;ve heard that song before, many times.&nbsp; Actually, that&#8217;s why I joined the service.&nbsp; To get away from hearing it like I did all through high school.&nbsp; I&#8217;m from a small town and word spreads like wild fire.&nbsp; Also I work nights now to get off the base some.&nbsp; I told a few buddies once in a strip club and now I&#8217;m known as the foot freak or called old hoof and mouth boy.�&nbsp; Tears began to stream down his cheeks as he continued.&nbsp; �Now I&#8217;ll probably lose the only highlight of this job, driving you home.&nbsp; It&#8217;s alright Miss Trudi, I know you&#8217;ll be calling your mayor friend and have me fired for being a freak, but remember, you asked.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Trudi wasn&#8217;t laughing at him at all.&nbsp; In fact she was enthralled at his admittance and at the deep feelings he shared with her.&nbsp; She wasn&#8217;t quite expecting this.&nbsp; She figured this would be the point where he expounded his pro male ability to bed any woman in sight.&nbsp; She found a nurturing place and smiled softly toward him and said, �It&#8217;s alright Maxwell.&nbsp; There is nothing at all wrong with a man admiring a woman&#8217;s feet.&nbsp; Indeed it should be practiced by more men.&nbsp; Women are not pawns in the chess game of sex.&nbsp; To be appreciated so is the dream of many Maxwell.&nbsp; You just haven&#8217;t found the right ones yet.&nbsp; It is grand you and I met though.&nbsp; I think I&#8217;d like to explore more of your desires, and I know several others who would find it quite interesting as well.&nbsp; That is if you are interested.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Max could not believe his ears.&nbsp; What she serious? IF he was interested?&nbsp; It&#8217;s been his wildest wet dreams to imagine what her feet would be like to lick and sniff.&nbsp; She had friends who liked a man at their feet?&nbsp; The Holy Grail had been found.&nbsp; No wanting to spoil the mood, he said only, �Yes Ma&#8217;am very much so.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As the cab pulled into her driveway Trudi handed him her card.&nbsp; �Tomorrow&#8217;s Saturday, call me after 1pm Maxwell, we&#8217;ll talk more about your most interesting fetish.�
She got out and stood by his window. He opened it and said, �Yes Miss Trudi and thank you for understanding Ma&#8217;am.�&nbsp; She handed him a crisp fifty, turned and went inside.&nbsp; He sat there until he tasted his dry mouth which hung open.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1pm sharp Trudi answered his call.&nbsp; Max was surprised when she greeting him so expectantly.&nbsp; �Hello Maxwell, I knew you&#8217;d call,� she smiled into the phone.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Miss Trudi I hope you are well today,� he replied.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I am thank you Maxwell.&nbsp; I believe in getting right to the point.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve been thinking about our little talk last night.&nbsp; You seem to have revealed your passion for women&#8217;s feet. �
Max gulped at her directness yet listened intently.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I think I can help you get to the embryo of your desires.&nbsp; In doing so thus you&#8217;ll gain a better understanding of it, thereby learn to control and enjoy it better.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t interrupt me Maxwell as I&#8217;ve no time to repeat myself.&nbsp; I merely wish to enlighten you as I find you worthy of such educating.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Firstly, you had a nurturing relationship with your mother.&nbsp; Most foot people do as mothers usually, but not always, love and are warm and kind to their offspring.&nbsp; To show you innocent appreciation you grew closer to her at her most available body part, her feet.&nbsp; You could crawl to them, sit and lay down near them, and at times you developed a desire to kiss and caress them.&nbsp; At such a young age, it was not a sexual approach you displayed.&nbsp; Rather a return of your love and devotion to her.&nbsp; Of course, as in most cases, shortly after your first physical encounter with her feet, she rejected your advances.&nbsp; Perhaps out of disgust.&nbsp; Perhaps out of guilt, who knows?&nbsp; The point is Maxwell, when she spurned your attentions at her feet it created such confusion in your brain that you felt you must have touched wrong.&nbsp; So you tried another approach to her feet and again felt rejection.&nbsp; Most likely at this point you stopped trying to touch her feet again.&nbsp; However the desire to do just that grew with intensity deep inside you.&nbsp; To satisfy you, each time you viewed her feet your eyes remained glued to them.&nbsp; She may or may not have noticed, that mattered little to you.&nbsp; All you thought was if you gazed at them hard enough, she&#8217;d have to know you appreciated her motherly charms.&nbsp; After a while you may have thought of little else but her feet.&nbsp; Not to say you had sexual intentions with your mother, rather it was through her feet you hoped to find her nurturing aspect.&nbsp; Then, the more you did not gain it from her, the more you craved it.&nbsp; As you matured the transference of the lack of such nurturing developed into a search for it at the feet of any female you encountered.&nbsp; A classmate, a teacher, the female crossing guard, any woman would do.&nbsp; You likely withheld you craving to actual attempts at being physical with any of these women, yet alone, in your bed, they were foremost in your mind.&nbsp; They would tempt and tease you with their treasured feet.&nbsp; You would succumb and try in vain to gain access to them, yet your attempts would always fail and you&#8217;d fall short of their approval.&nbsp; I&#8217;d wager a bet Maxwell that at this point you&#8217;d either awake to a wet dream or be pounding yourself to orgasm.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Do not feel awkward over this passion for female feet however.&nbsp; You are not quite the freak your non foot loving associates have banned you.&nbsp; To be sure almost all people find some part of somebody&#8217;s body erotic.&nbsp; We all have out sexual, and even more intense, sensual aspects Maxwell.&nbsp; The fact that you have yet to find a proper way to satisfy you in this respect is unfortunate.&nbsp; It is not however, impossible in the least.&nbsp; To be sure, I for one know exactly how to lead you to foot nirvana Maxwell.&nbsp; It would require dedicated attention to detail to achieve though.&nbsp; The end would certainly justify the means.&nbsp; You simply require a refocusing of you desires, a new attention to detail as it were.&nbsp; I, my new friend, just happen to be in a position to aid you in this endeavor.&nbsp; The journey will test the very core of your being.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll be subjected to strange and difficult situations, many of which I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve never considered before.&nbsp; Yet I assure you if you display half the dedication you carry towards attaining satisfaction at the feet of a woman as you expressed to me, it will all prove to be worth it Maxwell.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I know I&#8217;ve talked a lot, and your lack of intrusion to my words prove to us both your interest.&nbsp; I know the military allows you to take 30 days a year off.&nbsp; If you wish to embark on the journey I&#8217;ve described, put in for your vacation starting the first of next month.&nbsp; I am leaving for Europe tomorrow and shall return here then.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll expect you, bag and baggage on my front door step at 9am sharp in two weeks Maxwell.&nbsp; You have until then to decide if you&#8217;re actually worth my time or not.&nbsp; Now I must adieu.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The phone line went dead. Max sat with the receiver still glued to his ear.&nbsp; She&#8217;d just spent a quarter hour dancing through his mind.&nbsp; It both impressed and intrigued him.&nbsp; It was as if she knew exactly what he&#8217;d hidden deep in his soul forever.&nbsp; He did not grow stiff in his groin area as she revealed him, however he could not dismiss the passionate overwhelming feeling she&#8217;d engulfed his senses in.&nbsp; One thing Max was sure of though was the fact that on Monday he&#8217;d be first in line at the personnel office requesting his vacation papers.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On the appointed date and time Max rang the doorbell of Miss Trudi&#8217;s home.&nbsp; The large door opened and he stepped in.&nbsp; Before he could take in his surroundings, a hand from behind him covered his face with a chloroform hanky.&nbsp; When he awoke Max was sitting in a straight back chair.&nbsp; His wrists were bound with rope behind the chair.&nbsp; He tried standing but found his ankles held taught to a spreader bar.&nbsp; A door to his left rear opened at which time a chill covered him.&nbsp; It was then the fog in his head cleared and Max noticed he was completely naked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A woman not much older than him strolled and stood before him.&nbsp; She had short red hair, and wore a black shiny corset.&nbsp; Bare legged she adorned her feet with stylish black leather heels.&nbsp; From head to toe she exuded a �don&#8217;t fuck with me� attitude about her.&nbsp; Max could but sit there wondering what happened to him and even more so, what was about to?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With a cold harsh tone his host stared straight through him and spoke,
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I am to be called Teacher by you worm.&nbsp; Call me anything else and your reward shall be this.�&nbsp; With that she slapped Max hard on his left cheek.&nbsp; His head spun and he winced yet held his tongue.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�For reasonswhich are not of my concern, I&#8217;ve be assigned to teach you the proper ways to become a useful foot slave.&nbsp; I am not interested in failing.&nbsp; You will be taught and you WILL learn, is this understood worm?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Ma&#8217;am, I think so Ma&#8217;am� Max stuttered.
Another resounding slap landed on his right cheek.&nbsp; The woman then asked curtly,
�What the fuck were you told to address me as worm?�&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Teacher, I&#8217;m sorry please forgive me Teacher� Max pleaded.
A sly smile formed on her lips.&nbsp; She took a sofa chair and dragged it before him.&nbsp; When she sat, she crossed and lifted her right shoe to his face.
