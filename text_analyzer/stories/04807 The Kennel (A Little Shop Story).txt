The Kennel

Phoebe
smiled. �Soapy, I think I�m going to leave Nolan down there in the Kennel for
another week.� The now platinum blonde giggled, and her full breasts bounced a
bit in the violet halter top. Soapy tried not to drool behind the counter. Damn
she�s looking good he thought, just like the tramps in my Narcotics Anonymous
meetings.

&nbsp;

�But I
thought your original bargain with Nolan was he stayed a week, wasn�t it,
Phoebe?� Jesus, Soapy thought, Nolan had actually agreed to stay in the Kennel
for a week if she�d let him suck on her tits for twenty minutes, something
Nolan should have been allowed to do anyway�he had a right as her husband.

&nbsp;

But Phoebe
hadn�t allowed Nolan to touch her precious boobs in over a year, and Soapy had
seen quite a lot of them in his employment at the leather BDSM store. The
Little Shop (�We Serve the Pervs�) had lots of people like Phoebe and Nolan
coming in and out, and Soapy had gotten quite used to this.

&nbsp;

So from what
Nolan had told Soapy during gruel time, Phoebe had agreed to this bargain, but
she�d not really let Nolan enjoy her naked, pure pink nipples (Soapy had sucked
them, as had many other men). Instead Phoebe had dunked a brassiere� in urine and put it on and made Nolan suck her
boobs through that till all the urine was gone, and the bra was dry.

&nbsp;

Good God!
And then Nolan had been locked in the Kennel. He�d been miserable through the
last six days, and was looking forward to leaving the cage, and he�d asked
Soapy how many days were left every morning, before Hydrotherapy.

&nbsp;

Soapy felt a
little guilty, because he�d had Phoebe AND their 19 year old daughter Clarice
to� his little apartment, fucking them
both every which way, and Nolan wasn�t really a bad guy, and quite wealthy.

&nbsp;

�I know the
agreement was for a week� Phoebe said, breaking Soapy�s reverie. Phoebe
smirked, her glossed lips crinkling a bit. �I have a new um, friend coming over
a lot now, our oldest son�s soccer coach, and Nolan would be in the way. I
think Nolan needs more training.� Phoebe bent over the counter and Soapy took a
quick intake of breath�what a cleavage.

&nbsp;

�Nolan�s on
Code Orange right now, isn�t he? Move him to Code Blue, take away his radio
privileges and make him take two hydrotherapies instead of one, put it on our
Visa�oh, and three extra days. Then two days on Code Purple� Got it?�

&nbsp;

Soapy noted
all this on a pad. Whatever else, the customer was always right at the Little
Shop. And as Code Purple cost three hundred a day, what were you going to do?
The Little Shop�s proprieter gave Soapy a 5% commission as well as his
salary,� so he had to look out for his
best interests. And of course he might get to visit Phoebe and Clarice again�

&nbsp;

Phoebe gave
Soapy a nice tongue kiss and pirouetted out of the Little Shop.

&nbsp;

Soapy tired
to focus on inventory taking, but it was hard. Out of� the Concord state prison for nearly a year, all
he could think about was what he couldn�t have. Codiene, Dilaudid, Demerol,
Dolophine, Dexedrine, Seconal, Benzedrine, Percodan,Valium, Fioranol, heroin,
Percocet, morphine, Tylenol 2,3,4,5� Oxycontin and all the other powders and
pills Soapy had been �free� from since his reform. And instead he had to
concentrate on how many dildoes were in stock at the Little Shop.

&nbsp;

The door to
the basement opened, and Plato, one of the huge blacks came up. �You got the
cattle-prod, Mist� Soaperstein?� Plato grinned. �Bubbles be acting up again.
You know what work for him.�

&nbsp;

Soapy sighed
and handed Plato a large bag. �And don�t forget the new package of fire ants
has come in from the Cricket Farm, Plato. Don�t over-use the cattle prod on
him, it�s not safe is it?� Plato�s response was just to laugh uproariously and
go back down stairs with the evil cattle prod.

&nbsp;

Masochism
mystified Soapy, who had spent nearly thirty years seeking drugs to make him
feel great�why would people want to feel worse? 

&nbsp;

Soapy looked
up, somewhat disgruntled as the bell to the Little Shop rang, and a very tan
middle aged couple came in, accompanied by a fetching strawberry blonde. Before
they approached the counter, the man whispered to the girl, who laughed and
tossed her red curls. She gave the older woman a spiteful look and flounced to
the back, where she fingered leather vests with interest.

&nbsp;

The older
woman looked at the floor, and the two older people came to the counter. Soapy
chuckled, thinking that people shouldn�t bring their kids to kink stores. This
would be a disruption to the inventory that he was trying to take. 

&nbsp;

�There was a missing dildo, but someone had
spirited it out without Soapy realizing it�how? An idea popped into Soapy�s
head, and he became somewhat nauseous. Soapy looked up at the approaching
couple with a game face.

&nbsp;

�How�re you
doin�� the man said in a Southwestern twang. Wonderful. Soapy, who had spent a
month in an Austin hoosegow once on suspicion of having burgled a
drugstore was already put off.

&nbsp;

The man
grinned, showing extensive tobacco stains on his molars. There goes lunch,
thought Soapy. �I�m Garland-Fitzhugh Simms, and this is my wife Jody, and we�re
wondering if the Kennel has opened yet. We read about it in the online Little
Shop newsletter?�

&nbsp;

Jody smiled
at Soapy, and he tried to smile back, but it was somewhat of a grimace. What a
nice lady, with a degenerate husband. She must wonder what sort of person Soapy
was for working there. He had to start television-repair school at night or
something to get out of this dreadful industry.

&nbsp;

�Is-is the
Kennel not up yet?� Jody asked, toying with some new models on the counter
nipple clamps display. As she lifted one wicked looking pair of clamps,
Garland-Fitzhugh grinned again.

&nbsp;

�Them clamps
would make you howl, baby�we might git um.� Jody blushed and her eyes closed
for a moment. Soapy felt sorry for her. She wasn�t bad looking, about fifty,
with a fairly good figure and stonewashed jeans over her shapely bottom. 

&nbsp;

�Yes, the
Kennel�s done� Soapy hastened to say, �And there are already um residents,
occupants�� Soapy didn�t know how to describe the inhabitants of the Little
Shop cellar.

Soapy
thought of the basement filled with twelve cages with naked people in them, at
least one of whom he had to deliver a Wall Street Journal to every morning.

&nbsp;

�And it�s
true�you serve �em gruel three times a day, and the hosin� down in the mornin�?
We saw a picture of that on the Internet.� Garland-Fitzhugh�s tobacco stained
grin seemed to tilt, like a jukebox as he thought of the �hosin��



But
politeness reigned for Armistead St. Leger Soaperstein, clerk to the perverts.
�Yes sir, the gruel�s Quaker Oats, actually, and we give the Kennel
participants� what Mistress Georgette
calls hydrotherapy, with a fire hose, in fact.�

&nbsp;

Soapy�s mind
wandered back to six a.m. when he�d gone downstairs with Mistress Georgette and
Plato and Cato, the huge blacks. Soapy had prepared the� fire hose as Georgette and the Negroes had� walked around banging the cages briskly with
rubber South African riding whips. 

&nbsp;

The screams
of �Get up, scumbags� had invaded Soapy�s ears as they did every morning, and
usually he couldn�t calm down until around nine-thirty in the morning.

&nbsp;

One of the
longer term Kennel residents, Mister Shimmelfarb had had a bit of trouble
waking up this morning, and Mister Shim�s mother had authorized Code Purple
treatment. This authorized Cato to drag the skinny accounting exec out of the
cage by his pubic hair, and to bitch-slap him awake.

&nbsp;

Cato had
whipped poor Shimmelfarb�s narrow ass for about ten minutes as Soapy had had to
endure Mister Shim�s New Jersey tones howling �Jay-zus! I�m wakin�
up, please lay orrff � But the rule was that everyone must be awake at five-forty-five
when the Hygiene Crew came down, so they could leave their cages, not
lollygagging around, and Cato, who was not much for words, had meted out� strict justice to Mister Shimmelfarb.

&nbsp;

Cato had
also skull-fucked Shimmelfarb�s fat lips to a quick cum before tossing him with
the others by the far wall of the basement. Then Soapy had turned on the high
powered fireman�s hose�the water bills were incredible�shooting the high
pressure stream, knocking down the six naked, trembling people as Georgette and
Plato had tossed soap flakes all over them, creating a sort of lava lather.

&nbsp;

Not much of
a group this week, four men and two women, and �Bubbles� who was a pre-op
something or other. All seven of them were flabby and out of shape, watching
their skin bounce as the brutally cold water hit them almost made Soapy ill.

&nbsp;

Last week
Miss Yates, the model everyone called �Eyesore� had been there, and Soapy� had really enjoyed making her perfect 36C
breats bounce with the cold water. At first Soapy had tried to be nice to her,
but she�d obviously been so much more attracted to the brutal black men, that
Soapy had finally just been really nasty.

&nbsp;

Soapy had
really enjoyed it when Georgette had ordered the Eyesore to lick his boots, and
especially when Miss Yates had given Soapy an �around the world� in the Little
Shop attic. But most of the slaves were not too cute.

&nbsp;

After the
hosing of course, the slaves were ordered to lick up all the lather and clean
up the hosing area before returning to their cages for the morning gruel.

&nbsp;

Soapy tried
to explain the whole thing in a monotone, and Garland-Fitzhugh seemed quite
happy.

&nbsp;

�That�s real
good� said Garland-Fitzhugh enthusiastically. �Y�all are strict with em? I�d
love to watch the water knockin� people down!�

&nbsp;

Soapy watched
with distaste as Garland-Fitzhugh spat some tobacco chaw on the floor. He tried
to continue the discussion. �Uh, we have a system of codes of strictness.�
Soapy pulled out a sheet and handed it to the Texan couple, who viewed it with
interest, as the little strawberry blonde came away from the vests casually and
joined the perusal.

&nbsp;

The sheet
read:

&nbsp;

�WLECOME TO
THE LITTLE SHOP HOUSING KENNEL!

PARK YOUR
SUBMISSIVE WHILE ON VACATION, WITHOUT WORRYING THAT SUBBIE WILL GROW �SLACK�!

&nbsp;

IN ADDITION
TO THE VALUABLE BEHAVIOR-MODIFICATION CODES THAT YOU SEE BELOW, WE ALSO HAVE
NIPPLE-WEIGHT TRAINING EXERCISES, LESSONS IN FORCED EDGING��

&nbsp;

�What�s
that? Forced Edging? Garland-Fitzhugh asked Soapy, looking up from the sheet.
Soapy made a face. �Um, that�s when guys are made to jerk off without having a
release�they have two or three hour sessions of jerking off at a
time�frustrating, I guess.� 

&nbsp;

Garland-Fitzhugh
laughed. �No relevance to us, I guess.� Jody said nothing, but the little
strawberry blonde laughed out loud. �You�re right about that, dude�guess we
could have Fatso here�� she prodded Jody, whose lip began trembling�do herself
with a vibrator.�

&nbsp;

Oh, thought
Soapy. She�s not their daughter then�or if she is, that�s waaay perv.

&nbsp;

Garland-Fitzhugh
read on�

�THERE ARE

WITHOUT MAKING EXCESSIVE NOISE. HERE IS A TESTIMONY FROM MISTRESS OLIVE B. FROM

�What�s a
Spencer paddle?� asked Jody faintly. Before Soapy could open his mouth,
Garland-Fitzhugh gave a stained grin. �It�s a paddle with holes all through it,
darlin��because, uh�� 

&nbsp;

The little
strawberry blonde interrupted the vague Garland-Fitzhugh. �Because the air
sails through the holes and you can hit faster�we have one, honey�I used it on
Fatso here last week!� The post-adolescent giggled and Garland-Fitzhugh laughed
heartily. Jody looked pale. They returned to the flyer�

CODE
PURPLE��

&nbsp;

Jody gasped
and dropped the sheet. �I-I don�t know that I want to read anymore.� 

Garland-Fitzhugh,
however picked up the sheet and continued perusing it, the little strawberry
blonde at his side. Soapy at this point was unpacking a St. Mark�s Cross that
had just been shipped to the Little Shop from Bavaria. Soapy looked keenly at Jody. �Well,
I can�t blame you for not wanting to read it. It�s not my idea of a vacation.�

&nbsp;

Garland-Fitzhugh
patted Jody�s cheek. �But honey, I cain�t just leave y� on yer own while I go
to Ber-muda with Jillian here. I�d be worried about you, y�know?� Jillian
smirked and Garland-Fitzhugh tapped Soapy on the arm. �I�m a dentist back in Laredo? And Jillian here is my hygienist?
Real purty but hard t� get t� know, we not speakin� the same generation
language.�

&nbsp;

Jillian
smiled at Soapy. �Garlie did take me to a Goo Goo Dolls concert in Houston.�

&nbsp;

�Yeah, but I
want to do more for you, baby.� Garland-Fitzhugh said earnestly, as he nibbled
the girl�s multi pierced earlobe. �I�m taking Jillian to th� Kay-Ribean Islands
for her twentieth birthday?�

&nbsp;

As Jody
sobbed silently, Soapy wiped his brow. �That�s awfully good of you as an
employer, Mister Simms.�

&nbsp;

Garland-Fitzhugh
postured generously. �Way-ul Jillian is real good with the patients, and she
sucks mah dick five times a day�� the girl playfully slapped Garland-Fitzhugh
on the arm�� en whut a pair of pink ass-cheeks she got! And so I want to give
back, like the Communists say.� Garland-Fitzhugh began industriously poking
tobacco off his gums with a solid-gold toothpick.

&nbsp;

Jody wiped
her tears and smiled bravely. Soapy was fascinated with Southern middle aged
women and their frosted hair, and hers was no exception. But he felt sorry for
Jody, especially when she said �Couldn�t I just visit my mother for a week,
Garland-Fitzhugh, honey?�

&nbsp;

Garland-Fitzhugh
dropped the toothpick back in his breast pocket. �You know hon, I would go for
that? But you�re kinda slackin� off lately, and lotsa attitude? You whine when
I make you take yer punishments in the front yard, cause you�re PTA president,
an you say that the Garden Club will come by, see you with your panties down,
my cane across your flabby butt? And Sonny Boy, said you didn�t suck his
friends off when he came by last weekend? When Jillian and I were in Vegas?�

&nbsp;

Jody
screamed, �Sonny�s our CHILD! Or at least my stepchild, Garland-Fitzhugh!�

&nbsp;

Garland-Fitzhugh
turned to Soapy. �Sonny�s mah son from m�first marriage? Niice boy. Newland th�
Fifth. Mah Daddy was called Trey? Sonny�s a real nice boy, wish you could meet
him. Doin� agronomy at A&amp;M back home.�

&nbsp;

Soapy took a
Tums as he watched Jody�s face collapse.

&nbsp;

Garland-Fitzhugh
turned to Jody, who was now weeping anew. �Sonny and his friends came over and
you gave them some beer, but when Sonny wanted you to do a little mouth
servicin� you said it was inappropriate or some shit you got from them
therapist talk shows? And you�re just a worthless slavehog, honey. Who you
think you are?�

&nbsp;

Jillian
slapped Jody across the face, laughing. �Get your clothes off and kneel, you
old bitch! We�re signing you up for the Kennel if I have to use my savings for
it!�

&nbsp;

Soapy went
to the front of the Little Shop and locked the front door, drawing a curtain.
As Jody disrobed, with tears streaking down her face, Jillian grabbed and
twisted her ear.

&nbsp;

Soapy began
processing the order for one week at Code Purple for Mrs. Josephine Simms,
watching out of the corner of his eye as Jody�s husband and his mistress tried
out the new shipment of canes on her old, wrinkled ass. Soapy whistled. Maybe
Grandma Cohen was wrong. Maybe there is something worse than dying with� a needle in your arm.
